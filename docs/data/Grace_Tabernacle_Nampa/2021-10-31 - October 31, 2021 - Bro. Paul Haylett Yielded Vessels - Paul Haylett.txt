hear him say [Music] sitting at the feet of jesus oh what words i hear him say [Music] happy place so near so proud just may i find him there each day sitting at the feet of jesus i [Music] for his love has been so great just it has won my heart at last [Music] sitting at the feet of jesus where [Music] [Music] when weary fights we rest sitting at the feet of jesus there i [Music] and comfort everything they sing the last verse for the paul to come bless me o my savior bless me as i sit low oh look down in love upon me let me see thy face so sweet give me lord the mind of jesus [Music] who is all my righteousness [Music] well i just want to start by saying thank you um the gifts are wonderful but i just have to tell you saints the love of the body is much more precious to me than the gifts to to be able as it is with my brothers and sisters to have such a a unity a camaraderie as it were that we can literally stand and say we are by the grace of god becoming one body in jesus christ and that is very special to me and as i spoke to you last night those short words truly saints our whole reason and purpose of being is to come into that fellowship with our lord jesus christ amen no other to names to be lifted up no creation of great uh kingdoms and and things and uh truly i believe that we are together on that and so i say once again from sister jerry and i thank you so much and um you know thank you brother trevor for the kind words i i was visiting with a brother here a few days ago and i just want to be honest i don't want i don't want to you know just create a false image and the brother was sharing with me a situation that went through their church and as a pastor he says brother paul he said i had to repent before the lord because i just got angry at those individuals for what they were doing and i thought lord i'm not exempt from that there's there's times that you get frustrated and you do that but brother adam's kind words i'll just tell on brother adam many many many years ago we were doing some work together and we were fighting brother adam looked at me in total disgust and said you're emotional more emotional than any woman i ever met you see there's a side to us that we have to deal with but by god's grace we can project the life of jesus christ and in our good days and our bad no insult sisters but you know sometimes we live in our own little roller coaster and uh all i want to say is is thank you for your obvious grace and mercy that you give back because i doubt if there's a one here that hasn't watched brother paul on the roller coaster i remember an unnamed person in this church one time made a comment to me after a service he goes brother paul things are tough things are difficult and i said uh well you know the big bold man well uh he goes no i could tell by the way you preach today you're having problems and you know we you realize that we are just human but by god's grace we can come together and as grace abounds in the church my brother and sister to whom much grace has been given much grace is bestowed in i say the lord has been so gracious to me has been gracious uh beyond measure in my life and i just pray god disappoints each and every one of us that if you have a decision and we'll be talking today a little bit on this you have a decision to make offer grace amen offer the olive branch as it were and uh this judgment my brother and sister when meated unwarranted is harsh but love i hope you catch this but love given when we don't believe love should be given is called grace amen thank you lord for grace hallelujah so thank you very much for for the lovely time yesterday i have to admit i was with brother adam as he was the first one that was bumped out of your little uh cake walk and uh i caught a revelation right then and there from brother adam i was like i'm next and uh so i made a much better spectator than i did a participant and especially when i got to see the brother start knocking it down and pulling the chair out and some of those little uh i won't call him aggressive but um anyway please pray for aaliyah sister jolene and leah went home malia just here this morning and all of a sudden not feeling well and got to pray with her on this step there but she still uh just um i think had a very severe stomachache so please please lift her up in prayer um i want to bring greetings to you from brother jewell those of you uh that follow social media might have caught this i think it was brother jason sister emmy brought the note brother jason's like brother jules in town well brother jewel was in town about that long he was with some friends and uh they were on a little vacation in montana and the sister needed to fly home i don't know if it was emergency or what but they drove into boise they called us i was still working covered head to toe in greece and we weren't able to meet together and they left the next morning to go back to montana and uh but he wanted me and i could hear sister vanessa in the ground background and brother jewell says now i want you to know that i love you and we miss you and we care for you and sister vanessa in the background me too uh so i bring a love and greetings from brother jewell sister vanessa to you today and uh greetings also from brother barry johnson uh most of you won't know brother berry brother david sister diane sister ruth with no brother barry and his wife's sister lisa but uh when our brother ken boyer passed on uh brother barry um is now the pastor of the church there in calgary alberta and uh we were just discussing uh some things and he wanted to uh extend uh greetings and love uh from the saints there in calgary to you uh and i took the liberty of sharing your love back with them amen now um before we go into the word just one last thing here you know we we got to be celebrated yesterday as the ministry or pastor appreciation and the ministry of the church but one portion of the ministry of the church that didn't get celebrated yesterday and um um because they're minimalists we didn't buy them any gifts we didn't uh figure that they would need anything more than what they have now but uh i just uh want to say thank you to brother jason and sister emmy amen and uh brother sean uh for their contribution to this assembly and i was just joking about not getting them something uh that please just take that as humor but um you know they make a great difference and every brother that has i mean let's just look at this when we think about ministry uh the brothers in the sound booth uh brother alex um translating uh brother mason i know where's mason he's sick okay okay well brother mason how's it just a desire and starting to work in the sound booth brother alex working in the sound booth each and every one doing their part is what contributes to this as a little group of people and uh and god has blessed us and so i say brother jason sister emmy sean god bless you for your your efforts um um i yes [Applause] now i don't i don't want to say this wrong but i i just want to share this perspective that sometimes you don't see there's been many a wednesday night that brother jason has come into the office i'm telling on it and he's come into the office and he has sat down in the chair looked over at me paul i'm bagged i don't know if i have enough strength to lead songs and then he comes out here and saints this is not showmanship but there's an anointing comes and the man who walks out that door on that wednesday night and stands right here you would have thought that he would all day was doing spiritual calisthenics preparing himself for the service praise the lord i'm gonna you know why because he just put the flesh behind him he said lord i have a duty to do so as we have musicians and song leader and whatnot that do this i i just want to say this to you young people um i'd be really happy to add your name to the list of those that contribute some of you know how to play instruments and for some reason or anointed of a spirit not to no i'm not just speaking to heidi i'm speaking to vika and donna whoever might be gifted in that fashion uh we were here recently in a house i won't say whose house but the piano is being played and some brothers and sisters are gathered around and they were singing so beautifully and i i didn't really look to see who was singing or all of this but i thought man i wish they would come to our church you know it'd be just so awesome if you know they didn't have a visitor spirit and would just think this is my church and i would sing and no i don't think i'll call him out brother jason but anyway so god bless you saints we love you so much sister sophie so glad to have you back uh we were missing you amen and uh so uh yes welcome home amen god bless you saints before we get too forgotten of what i'm doing here let's just stand and go into the word of god today um you know i preached this last wednesday and it really you know i felt led to preach that sermon but really it was kind of meant to be a sunday service and so those of you who weren't here wednesday i'm preaching part two to a service you never heard uh but i just want to continue on in this thought of the power to lay down and uh god has just given to us saints a supernatural ability uh in the hour that we live in you know the prophet of god speaking he's talking about it would be an age of rights that the people would declare i'm an american i have rights i i'm this i have rights and the prophet of god declares that as a christian we lay our rights down amen and we take up the calls of jesus christ and what he says and what he guides we are happy with we can say lord thank you because we just simply desire to be in his perfect will and so it's in this that i i want to continue in this spot and for a title today uh i uh i would have to say there were several thoughts that come to my heart but i just in reading the word i just uh come forth and and for a title today i want to speak on yielded vessels so it takes very much a yielding to the holy spirit not to determine that we know best to know that we can give ourselves fully to the word of god now saints you know two thoughts in the world we live in today and uh in that you know those two thoughts uh are very parallel right so the prophet of god shows us how that the wheat and the tares dwell together very parallel life they rejoice when it rains they suffer as it were in the drought they're drawing their their uh nutrition and they're drawing their needs from as it were the earth and so all this parallel but in that vein what the yield is one is gathered into the garner and one is gathered and burned so in these two thoughts or two veins entirely different results comes from that all i can say today is lord i am wheat i confess i'm wheat i will live like weed i will walk like we i will talk like wheat amen because that's by revelation who i am amen so let's go to luke the 12th chapter and uh verses one through five uh and by god's grace today we will we will be able to present this in a timely manner uh i had much more scriptures i had much more quotes but just felt led to by the grace of god i believe we chose correctly to condense it down because you know we can take and certainly sometimes it's necessary to drive the point home but you know saints almost want to ask you as believers how many scriptures do you need to convince you you're the bride of christ we could come and give you hundreds or as believers we could look at those few scriptures and realize that is me because the preponderance of scripture may be taken and say i have overwhelming evidence but did you know to a real believer one simple portion of scripture is enough to convince you this is the truth some people say i need more evidence i need more evidence i need more evidence but the real believer says i know what the spirit of christ is it's anointing me i'm living in that and and therefore we don't have to have some great ream of evidence to convince us of who we are amen luke the 12th chapter in the meantime when there were gathered together an innumerable multitudes of people and so much that they showed one upon another almost sounds like a riot he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that shall not be known therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which you have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and that after have no more that they can do but i will forewarn you whom you shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto that you fear him heavenly father we ask for your guidance today father you know my heart my prayer we just ask you to come move in our midst today lord let the word of god be so real to us we walk out today lord in our hearts being able to say was it not good to be in the house of the lord today lord every need you know into the very deepest of our person father what our hearts cries are what our needs are we ask you father lord as your saints reach out to you today to express their praise their worship and their needs lord that you would meet them in their place lord we thank you for your grace and mercy amen you may be seated now i'm going to take today's saints by god's grace and we're going to use this scripture and oftentimes uh we'll read a scripture and we'll take it and maybe correctly so we'll take it in a certain fashion but you know i want to just make an emphasis today if i may upon these scriptures we'll look at the parallels that there are between what god is doing in our lives and what satan is trying to do you'll see that in that that satan has nothing original right and so it's there that he is following and and i could just be so redundant with a list of these things that we see going on in the world today that are coming over in the natural reflecting a spiritual light i have spoken to you uh many occasions of the identity crisis that is taking place in the world today uh men and women don't know what gender they are people are identifying in all forms and fashion but my brother and sister the real root of that comes right down in this parallel because the world today wants to be christians my brother and sister they truly do they want to be christians but there's an anointing that is there that they cannot see the light and that's why we as sons and daughters of god should rejoice that god has opened our eyes amen so they are there and end up under this anointing of the age that we're living in it's not the person never look down upon that person because my brother and sister without the holy ghost falling on you and i we would be in that same exact boat but there they are under this identity crisis saying oh we are holy ghost-filled christians but yet there is so many things and this is not judgmental this is just dealing in the realm of fact so many things that do not line up with scripture but the spirit of the age has come in such a fashion that they have been a given permission to discount portions of the word of god because it's not relevant to our day so as they look at the bible they see it now as a historical book because if you can't take those portions of scripture and apply it today then that means it didn't apply but the word of god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever john 1 and 14 my brother and sister the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and he's the same yesterday today and forever so there is no expiration date on the word of god so you see because the reason i say there's no expiration date i hope you catch this now because if there was an expiration date on the word of god then satan could just delay and wait till the word expired because what do you do with something expired i watch my dear wife sometimes you know kind of with a little regret say oh you know i thought we would eat this but because it's been in the fridge too long or whatever it might be with regret right over to a garbage can so the devil you just wait wait and wait and wait right it's not how the word works my brother and sister the only one that controls that is god amen so what satan's trying to do in our life my brother and sister is always an imitation of what god is already doing on the earth and so you start to find yourself in a circumstance where satan is is is uh messing as it were i'll just put it that simple messing with your mind messing with your life realize that just right next to you is the original is the uh the fulfilled word of god coming past right there next to you but satan often puts this and i mentioned it here in the church how that the us military now is working on this hologram stuff that literally could project an image that would look just like this pulpit and would look like a singular person behind it but there could be ten people here and they're developing this technology but i want you to understand now that's because when jesus christ looked at the true believers the bride of christ you know what he saw himself yes he didn't see a bunch of sinners he didn't see a bunch of losers he didn't see a bunch of people unworthy he looked at that and saw himself because it's his blood that covered us and his blood is you might say in essence part of his identity and so then he looks at you and i and all he sees is himself how beautiful that is so the world now is coming out and reflecting all of these things brother brown says you know that science had invaded god's laboratory so what satan's trying to do my brother and sister is just follow a very parallel pattern now the holy spirit moving in your life moving in my life my brother and sister is moving us into a transparent life see god doesn't want a bunch of believers that are very adept at hiding things he wants a group of believers that when they look and come face to face with the word the very first thing that they would do is say oh lord forgive me amen never trying to hide that now look at the anointing we won't go into that today but when you look at that whole picture of what happened in eden so as it is that adam is here in this position the serpent is there as it would be a court he's courting is what he's actually doing he's courting eve he didn't just come and say eve i'm going to cause you to fall i'm going to cause you to lose your place in the garden i'm going to cause you to lose this and to lose that so what he did is he courted her until she started to lose her transparency it didn't take place in just one moment so there had to come a time that eve walked in the garden with the lord god and she's hiding something in her heart now this is what's interesting about the plan of god saints you can't hide one thing from god so here is eve walking in the garden with the lord god right go back into genesis 3 you'll see how satan comes the serpent comes and what he does is he removes the lord god and reduces it down to just god which is impersonal and so now eve's starting to have an impersonal christian relationship there's god in heaven and we're down here doing our thing amen but now here's eve walking in the cool of the evening hiding something she's lost her transparency she's hiding something now this spirit my brother and sister now i'm not defending brother paul okay i just i am who i am and if i made mistakes lord forgive me and saints forgive me but this is where when it becomes so real to you that everywhere you look you see this see it's not about individuals it's about spirits amen and so you come now and as they were walking with the lord god because regardless of how satan presents him he is the lord god he'll never lose his position to a believer he is always the lord god even in our transgression in our sin in our lowest point of life he needs to remain the lord god and so as we're walking in the cool of the evening this spirit that is on eve where she is losing her transparency now that spirit my brother and sister slowly works in such a fashion that it comes over and starts to anoint adam and you say how do you know that brother paul because you see when it come into the cool of the evening one evening the lord god's walking through the garden adam where art though where art thou under a spirit of transparency adam and eve would have run to the lord and said oh lord god forgive us but under this veil that has now come upon their soul we're going to hide this we're going to hide what we're doing we're going to hide what we're thinking or etc i'm going to take the time to go into it but you look at that and see whatever it is it's there so losing that veil of transparency or that anointing of transparency my brothers and sisters what caused them to run and hide themselves so the holy spirit in our day is moving in the lives my brother and sister sons and daughters of god and i hope you can say amen to this and we are becoming more transparent each and every day we can't hardly go through a day of something that we've said or done or a behavior in action whatever it is that we're not oh lord forgive me i just can't even go to bed tonight lord forgive me because that is what god is desiring to do is bring us into a transparent life now my brother and sister it's the holy spirit it's simply that the holy spirit going back into the message you'll see where the prophet of god talks about that when that holy spirit that sweet spirit moves down upon you don't resist it repent isn't that beautiful amen i'm preaching to believers today amen but we still live in this present world and this present world is getting darker not lighter amen so you look at that what god's doing now is giving us a spirit to deal with our problems he is not leaving us anointed under a spirit of condemnation but he's bringing deliverance and uh thank you lord for that now my brother and sister as we've already kind of touched on this but uh just to come back satan anoints people to hide their transgressions and uh so in that uh satan uh anointing them to hide their transgression but look at this now the individual is hiding his transgression but just like in the court where they have the stenographer is that what they call that stenographer i know i wasn't saying that right the stenographer sitting over there it's pretty amazing i've been in court a couple times as a witness fortunately not being in that chair but just to witness that the person in that chair did it but that's what satan's doing scottish stenographer here and everything that's happening have you ever watched their fingers it's incredible and they're recording every word and even really good ones can put in parentheses things like they sighed because it has to be an accurate record of what took place and so while satan's anointing in the day we live in people are hiding their transgression satan's stenographer is over here recording every drop of it and he's like here's the evidence you did it and under that my brother and sister people then are like i i i don't want the church to know whatever it might be i'm not here to speak as it were in that but just to remind you of the world we live in so the devil is here anointing you amen who was it preached that said you know the devil's the one that anoints him to rob the bank and then the devil calls 9-1-1 and here's the stenographer recording every last thing well people are like oh my it kind of scares me to think that that god's got a record of even our very thoughts well i tell you what if our thoughts got boom put on that wall or this screen right here a lot of us would be just like oh my goodness that you see by the blood of jesus christ you say oh my thoughts my thoughts my thoughts oh what lord help me but the blood of jesus christ isn't that beautiful so it isn't that we'll never have those thoughts that's it that's right but the blood applied quickly not after weeks and months and years but the blood applied quickly amen delivers us and satan's stenographer looks down there and they're like where did it go it's not recording the devil says but i heard it and i saw it and i'm going to bring it back to your remembrance and then you can say what's in that's it what's him that song song always disturbs my heart what sin are you talking about now look at this my brother and sister satan's keeping a good record to expose it at a later date that's what he wants to do he doesn't just keep this for for effort he wants to expose it at a later date he wants it to uh control people and i think right here in our midst there will be a few folks that'll say yeah i know i know what you're talking about brother paul the devil wants to come back and just beat me to death with my past but remember what sin now look i actually feel sorry i hope you can take this with a sense of humor this morning i actually feel sorry for politicians because look at what's happening in the world we're living in today my brother and sister they're running for an office they're running for a judgeship or this or that and all the way back to kindergarten somebody's dredging up every single thing they ever did i'm like how how do people how do they do that they don't know this guy's going to be a judge someday so it's like if he's going to be a judge i'm going to keep a record of his life they're just living what is it the word of god coming to pass god said whatever was done in darkness shall be shown in the light and whatever was done in street secret will be made known and so we're seeing this manifestation taking place in the natural my brother and sister that people doing and saying things i just watched the other day a little deal about some woman that's uh being put to uh to be a position in the uh uh uh biden administration and uh you know they're coming back and saying did you not say in 1978 did you not say in 1985 did you not and they're naming off all these dates and i'm like wow the devil keeps a good record but is it really the devil or the word of god being vindicated right it's there in that realm but god's word must come to pass amen do you understand where i'm standing so you look at that now they're anointed to transgress and then they're destroyed by the very evidence but look at the difference that our lord jesus christ has done yes there is a record but instead of the evidence destroying the individual the blood of jesus christ destroys the evidence amen and turns us sets us free i say thank you thank you thank you lord hallelujah now you know satan is the author of blackmail you see god's word has said yea thou has said and opens the door for forgiveness i'll just you know it's interesting this come to me and i was like well do i do i not do i do i knew i'm not i run out of daisies picking the petals off but i just want to just give you a little brief glimpse of how satan can come and try even in the life of a young man to to bind and control and uh this young man which happens to be me i worked in a feed mill when i was in high school and my dad had a pickup i believe i remember correctly it was a 1956 uh chevy pickup and and you know when you drove that thing uh you know it sounds kind of dangerous i guess but if you wanted to stop you had to pedal the push the brake pedal two or three times kind of pump the brake have you ever drove something like that i want to stop there's a stop sign down yonder i'll start pumping the break now and so i was driving this this pickup and felt happy that my dad would let me drive it to school so i could have this after school job and one day i was all in a hurry and i run out after work and i jumped in the pickup fired it up and i backed up and as i'm backing out of the parking space i had kind of an afterthought i need to start pumping the brake and i didn't pump it quick enough and vehicles parked on the other side of this driveway i hit this car in the tail i busted the whole taillight out fortunately didn't do any damage to the actual car just busted their taillight out and now i want to bring this back of what i've spoke to you into the real sense because i'm speaking something from a first-hand basis the very first thing that come over me was to look around and see if anybody saw me sin [Music] and i didn't see anybody i put it in first gear i'm going i go home that night and it's troubling me it's troubling me it's troubling me but i'm thinking my daddy's gonna be so mad at me i go to school the next day i go to work the next day and there was a little guy that really in real life if a character was drawn of him you would say that looks like a ferret because that was his nature and after work he's like hey paul i want to talk to you i'm like hey what do you want i saw what you did last night i'm like somebody did see me sin are you with me 20 bucks a week i won't tell anybody well hello i only made 80 bucks a week and he says i'll give you a couple days to think about it and if not i'm telling on you i went home so troubled what do i do what do i do well you know we have terms like little man syndrome and things like that right that are reflecting of the nature of people my whole life i'm not proud of these things but my whole life i i've been anointed with this and somebody's like well we're going to pound your head in and this is i hope the unconverted paul and nature would rise up in me and say you're going to die trying now i say that i share that because i want you to see that something in me was saying i'm not letting this guy blackmail me after supper that night i sat down with my dad and i said dad i hope you're not upset with me but and i give him the whole thing and he says i am upset with you and i'm like i'm sorry i'm not i'm not upset with you that you had the accident i'm upset with you that you hid it from me are you with me since i said what do i do dad he goes what you will do is you will go to school tomorrow and then you will go to work tomorrow and before you're going to ask your boss because that business this business closed at the same time you're going to ask your boss for just a few minutes and you're going to walk over there and walk in the front door of that business and say who drives that little red car and then you are going to stand in front of that individual whoever they are and you are going to tell them the truth amen i walked in that business that day receptionist at the counter and i said um who drives the little red car receptionist looks at me well it's so and so could i have a moment and talk to him other eyebrow goes up yep the man comes out and i said sir i backed into your car yesterday and i got scared and i drove away and i sent him here today to take responsibility and he looked at me and he goes well thank you young man a little short guy i don't know what that has to do with it but [Music] little short guy and he looked at me i said thank you thank you so much and i was taken back by this gratitude that he is showing after i've smashed his car and he's like we had no money to fix it and i said i have no money to just pay you and he said i'll tell you what we do i'll take the car to a body shop and then you pay me just as much money as you can maybe even twenty dollars a week walked out of there no contract nothing more than a handshake and the man saying you know what this will be fine i can drive the car i never like this oh this is personal i'm sorry to take your time but i always saw you know you see a car driving down the road and they have red tape over your tail height and i was like lord i never want to be a person like that but when you realize that while i may never be that person i can call someone to be and that struck me deeper than being the one with red tape over my taillight i caused this person i caused this person to doubt jesus christ is alive and real and manifest in the church i caused this person to be upset i caused this person to maybe even doubt god's real exactly right that's worse than having the red tape on her own self that's right and i remember my daddy just a few days later he goes i shared with him that night and he goes you know son it's not right that man just had liability on his car only way to fix it would be out of his own pocket i remember my dad saying you know what son your mama and i talked about this and prayed about it the man gave me the the body shop deal and i took cash to him that my daddy loaned me and i laid it all out and you know fathers can be rough my dad said every dime of your paycheck is mine except for gas money no snickers no zingers no pepsi all the necessities of life are just gone my dad told me i hope you're catching the underside of this my dad told me he says sometimes when a lesson is painful is the only way we remember the lesson i want you to think about it our god makes no mistakes and have you ever had a painful lesson amen did you forget that lesson i say no amen so i'm back at work this little man i describe as a weasel comes after work comes up have you got money for me i said no and he said i'm gonna go tell them i said you're welcome you see the blood of jesus christ takes all shame takes the stain of our transgression and now the devil is free to run around the earth and say they were a sinner they were a sinner they were a sinner you're free satan just go ahead tell them i was a sinner but the blood of jesus christ has set me free hallelujah and i can walk in liberty now i don't care the man looked at me and he says what do you mean and i said i went yesterday or days before that wasn't actually yesterday and i told them myself the guy looked at me and just turned around walked off you see every bit of leverage that he thought he had you realize that would have been twenty dollars a week for like ever isn't that what the devil wants he wants to hold us hostage not for a week or two not for a time of here and there he wants to hold his hostage to emotion bitterness and resentments and all these kind of things forever but i'll tell you i'm not gonna be a hostage to the devil forever and i'm gonna go and say lord forgive me lord i have done wrong and i take possession of my failure and i committed to you lord i'm lifting my soul as the psalmist david said i'm lifting my soul to you oh god and of thy mercy i seek amen and it's gone amen hallelujah and you know it kind of changed my relationship with this little guy because he was constantly the one that just weaseled here and weaseled there and afterwards i hope you think i'm just being spiteful i hope you don't think i preach like this but after that we're working they used to bag a lot of grain in the afternoon right towards the end of the day and whatever hadn't went out is bulk cattle feed they instead of it spoiling or not spoiling but setting up and being immovable because had molasses with it they would put it in these 80-pound bags and we would be there and they just loved to make paul run the bagger and the reason that mattered is because you see them bags were these big coarse paper heavy-duty bags and the way you had to handle them when i first went to work there have sympathy for me on this one in one day the first day i ever worked there chewed every knuckle in my hands to blood and bags were so coarse over time you developed calluses you know calluses are good but they're not because the devil wants to form a callous on your heart because you become hardened but god wants to keep your heart tender and i remember just a few days after that i'm there running the bagger and actually i got to rejoice on it these young men i'm going to call you out gideon shawn brother alex exercising feel this well when you get older it's more like feel this but i was young once in that thing you're doing this repetitive 80 pounds 80 pounds 80 pounds and this little guy makes a comment and i resented it and i just turned to the rest of the guys that were working there and i said you know what he did i run into the car across the street and he tried to blackmail me and every one of these guys i worked with said did you drag him out to the railroad tracks and deal with him and the little guy from that day on never said one word to me always just kind of why i hope you see the type saints i've been set free this no longer bound me i knew this man had no control over me and we as sons and daughters of god do not have to live under condemnation we have been set free and we can declare to the world he made me a liar he made me an adulterer he made me a thief but i'm set free and i'll tell you what sons and daughters of god can look at the devil today and say you know what somebody ought to drag him out by their tracks amen because that's what he deserves because he's a liar a cheating a thief amen see what it is is the devil is the author of blackmail he's tried to keep our sins against us forever but i tell you thank you lord that our sins are in the sea of god's forgetfulness and they can't even be found amen and the sting of death hell and the grave is gone because he says you were once this brother trevor and you don't fight with him you're absolutely right trevor the old man used to be that but trevor the new birth in the spirit of oneness oh hallelujah under the spirit of oneness with god i am no longer identified as a sinner i'm now identified as bride amen oh hallelujah hallelujah so look at this real quick i need to hurry so in verse 2 it says there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that shall not be known now i want you to look at this and we understand the context of the scripture here but don't think that i've lost the context but look at this my brother and sister nothing covered think about the word nothing covered that shall not to the bride of christ be revealed so there'll be people that will tell you this was for the prophet only it's not what my bible says my bible says in the last days the son of man shall be revealed amen the mystery of jesus christ i'm just paraphrasing the south the mystery of jesus christ shall be made known absolutely why would a minister of this message try to keep you from all of the truth see there's there's got to be an ulterior motive could it be they're anointed i'm not speaking against individuals could it be they're anointed and satan says if i can keep them from seeing all of the truth that's it then i can keep them bound up that's it but if they ever see all the truth i've lost everything that i could ever hold over them amen oh my brother and sister i say this to you again it's not my thought today but i say this again to you it's your job to take everything preached in this church back to the word of god don't let satan give you just a cloudy fuzzy little understanding the mystery of christ has been revealed amen he is being made manifest in the body of believers in the hour that we're living there'll be people with ideas you're leaving the prophet behind are you kidding me we would not have a clue except for god ordained him to preach that word and now we see the truth is that leaving him behind no that brings us to a place of the highest praise for him as a messenger to our day that brings us to the place of thanksgiving wailing in our hearts because god loved me so much he anointed a man to sacrifice to bring the word to me amen that's not leaving him behind that's placing him in his proper position that's us recognizing that without him amen just as it would be imagine all that paul preached that's it we cut from the bible i'm sorry i don't want my bible missing what paul preached because there's truth there's life there's deliverance there's invigorating power in this gospel and it was preached in our day as a living word not a historical word a living word i say thank you lord jesus hallelujah so the devil tries to cover up everything the word says you know everything that's covered is going to be revealed but i want you to also come and realize the devil's trying to hide this revealed word even today amongst us as believers right here in this assembly he would like you to not catch the very intrinsic value of the revealed word but when we find the value of the intrinsic word did you know oh i know i'm surmising here people tell you you can't put line upon line but even the prophet put it that way do you realize as i've said before i was heartbroken you guys didn't vote for my pie yesterday i didn't even get an honorable mention in fact i got no mention at all sister sarah was sure i bribed him i felt like sister sarah's pie spoke for itself what if sister sarah she won't tell me what's in her pie so i can't really name the ingredients but let's just say sister sarah made a pie and it needed one pinch of salt she put in two pinches she didn't put in a pinch at all would the pie be the same absolutely not i hope you can catch where i'm going god said sister nadia she keeps sitting on the front row i haven't got her cured yet but the word of god says sister nadia i know what you need and here's just a little pinch and sister nadia goes home and rejoices because god spoke to her heart not the preacher and for another one we needed a handful of this and another one of that and god knew exactly what he was doing now what if my brother and sister we just took this message of the hour and removed revelation from it we wouldn't even have a message we would be presbyterians and lutherans and pentecostals and catholics and that's it god knew i'll put that pinch in there for you that'll make this word real to you amen now i want to go to verse 3 real quick i honestly thought i would oh man i'll be done so quick today and somebody's stole the time again therefore what you have spoken in darkness now we can look at this my brother and sister and there's different theologians they break this down in different fashions but i'm just going to take it as in darkness as in night and day amen not necessarily as spiritual but as night and day now it says whatever you spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light now if you can catch this we were just talking about it the other day there's things that god deals with your hearts and you come to church and the preacher reads that scripture he reads the same quotes that you're doing goes into the same message that you were listening or studying the very same thing what is it you sitting in as it were the dark night of your own house of your own life and thinking lord i don't understand and it's preached on you like lord i need a deliverance here an encouragement here and it comes forth what is this god revealing what was spoken in your heart in your private life amen revealing that i'm listening to you but it's never the negative like the devil it's never coming and saying oh sister what you thought or said i'm going to use against you always growth always grow amen the holy ghost never cuts down in the sense of the devil the devil destroys sometimes god has to dismantle things in our life can you say amen because it's not correct and he needs to correct that and bring it back but you know he always does that with loving kindness he always brings up with revelation that we understand i need to let go of this amen isn't god wonderful that's right amen so you look at this i want to just move on behind that beyond that which you have spoken in the ear in closet shall be proclaimed upon the housetops amen this is positive and negative saints amen and you know while all of this is happening there's a yielding taking place think about this there's a yielding taking place and whether it's positive or negative there's always a yielding taking place there's some people it's like well you know i've heard these words they've been spoke to me actually they weren't spoke to me they were thrown in my face you're preaching me well if you were sitting down there facing this direction i was right unless you would like us to act like you don't exist but this is deeper saints this is a spirit that's pushing back and say that's not of god you're preaching at me when we say god said now have any of you ever in your life made a statement in the nature of i was praying and the lord spoke to me do you know when you voice that you're saying thus saith the lord now if you're thus saith the lord is contrary to the written word of god nobody needs to judge that spirit it's obvious it's just plain and simple this is not the word so the revealed word cannot speak that because brother branham clarified he said god will never the holy spirit will never lead you away from the word it will always draw you to the word so then when someone says well the lord spoke to me and it is contrary to the word no one needs to judge that even i'm sorry saints no one needs to judge that it's the word judges that and the urum thummim would declare that wasn't true no flashing on the life on the life no flashing on the life because god cannot honor something that's contrary to his word so this yielding that's taking place my brother and sister is the spirit that's yielded to the word revealed word living word or revealed and anointed and manifesting a god of history did not our fathers and jesus turns right back on them it says you kill them and then you garnish their tombs yes sir right yes sir but they could stand and say are we not of abraham's seed are we not believers of the end time message you are if you yield to it that's it that's it but if there's no yielding to it it then becomes your cloak am i preaching too hard okay i just don't want your whole sunday to be ruined now romans 6 6 6 16. now look at this my brother and sister when you read the book of romans doesn't it give you a warm fuzzy feeling the roman church stood up and declared we believe the word for our day they had pool parties they had mixed bathing they even exchanged wives oh that's a stunner you all look like oh my goodness brother paul said that there was a pope in our church i can't believe that no it's the truth yeah and they did it all in the name of christianity yeah paul comes along and says god sent me here straighten you out amen i'm not here to make you feel good i'm not here to rub your back i'm here to tell you that that is wrong that is wrong that is wrong that is wrong and no doubt the romans must have thought do we do anything right he's preaching at us but there was some real believers that were there yes sir that voice amen that's the truth and preaching at us no he wasn't preaching with my flesh go go listen to one don't listen to oneness it's good this old byproduct flesh that wasn't what they were looking at amen they were looking down to the soul and they even then had a revelation that their soul belonged to god from the beginning and would belong to god at the finish and they chose by a yielding to reverence the call of the word amen and that word becomes so real to them no ye not that to whom ye yield yourself servants to obey his servants to whom ye obey whether of sin and to death or of obedience unto righteousness now this is going to be a little lap over i don't know the lord kind of laid on my heart and i haven't really moved forward on it but just maybe you can study and think about it the two sides of obedience it's right here based out of this scripture right here there's anointing of laodicea if you're obedient to it it yields one thing the holy spirit moving in this day you're obedient to it it yields something entirely different but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh the apostle paul declared i have a thorn in my flesh and history has said well it was it was because he was beaten we're pretty sure that this thorn was because he's beaten every other theologians say well we think it was his eyesight it's it's recorded in history that paul's eyesight was failing him but my brother and sister i want to take you into the realm of the spiritual now the physical infirmities that we have must be born god heals us but i personally let me put this note i personally think that paul was describing paul dealing with paul amen paul's seeking deliverance from himself that's right amen paul going through life just like you yeah amen and happened to say lord forgive me for my thoughts and my deeds and my actions and my words lord forgive me because i think it'd be much simpler to accept the fact that you're back you know some people said all you had you know maybe i forget what the term is not scoliosis but hunchback uh you know whatever the proper medical term others said this others say this others say it was eyesight i say it was a devil assaulting him yeah god be thanked that you were servants of sin but have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as you have yielded your members see this is not talking about you poor guy with a club foot or you person here with this or that the infirmity of the spirit paul was dealing in the spirit realm if god was so much worried about their physical bodies my brother and sister god would anointed paul to pray for them and every one of them would have been healed but sometimes we need a physical infirmity to remind us [Music] to remind us for as you have yielded your members to uncleanliness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness see so he's he's laying this down now we know what iniquity is we can put it anyways brother branham puts it like this he says iniquity is you knowing to do right and not doing it amen other definitions there's several of iniquity posts it under the realm of presenting yourself i'm paraphrasing presenting yourself as something you are not even so now yield your member servants to righteousness and holiness for when you were servants and you were free from righteousness some people say whoa i'm glad i was free from righteous but that's not the heart of the believer that's not the life of the believer the nature of the believer you crave righteousness amen hallelujah what fruit had ye then in those things whereof you are now ashamed isn't that right i tell you what i'll go into it but i can tell you i've talked to a lot of brothers in a lot of places on a lot of continents and men tell you maybe because you're a minister maybe because our friendship was such and men tell you of what they were before yeah and then tell you no one in this church knows no one in this church knows what i was before i was effeminate i was this i was that amen sister jerry and i met a brother back east in a prison hands this big man tries to stab him with some kind of chunk of metal he strikes the man down actually kills him struck him so hard the man hit a wall or whatever and that was the end of him did they look at that and say we're happy you defended yourself no he was already the outcast and they put the cuffs on him and led him away and charged him with murder see the spirit of laodicea doesn't like you and will fight against you and ever did but when he's all caught up his old pastor faithful oh brother he's like pastor they're talking about sending me to prison like a common criminal this pastor says you know what you just believe and watch god perform hallelujah the same couple i find it humorous can i share this humorous moment they come in church i'm preaching in this little church all all black church except for one white sister and this brother and his wife are sitting right here on the front row he's this great big guy like i said i'm not exaggerating hands this big and the whole service brother trevor he's sitting there with his arms crossed and every once in a while he'd nod his head and his wife had her hands in her lap clasped really tight and a couple times during the service a little amen come out and i thought well i don't know what's going on with them but praise the lord we go to a restaurant after the service and we're sitting there turns out this brother is so funny just had us laughing great big black brother and he just he'd start laughing [Laughter] finally the pastor turns to him and says hey so what was your guys's deal in the service tonight puts his head down his wife sitting just right back puts her head down we fought all the way to church pastor says well are you delivered brother paul was preaching at us but we received it didn't we honey come on my brother and sister god is going to give you fruit unto holiness beyond the human element of who we are beyond satan's accusation he's going to pour the fruit of holiness into his bride and you are identified by the word today as his bride hallelujah amen but the gift of god is eternal life through our lord jesus christ we don't even have to now i'm not saying we ignore this but we don't even have to go over here of what the wages of sin is because god has delivered you and i from the wages of sin and satan's accusation has been taken away his shame has been taken away and the life and the liberty of jesus christ has been poured into us oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus oh can i have just a couple more minutes saints and brother mason's not here so he can't do that on me you believe he had the courage to do that last night now i'm gonna be like the ministers i'm closing i was like slap you silly boy but he has such a little charm about him what is it about brother mason sister carrie i don't know where you found him but i'll tell you what that boy is one special boy look me right in the face oh brother paul you know you love me yeah mason i love you but regardless can i have a few more minutes now look when it comes to authority of what's being spoken here john 19 10 then saith pilate unto him our lord jesus speaketh thou not unto me to see jesus never answered him who are you what are you what's going on here explain it to me i'm the judge that's it speaketh now not into me sorry devil i'm not obligated by the word to answer your accusations i don't have to defend myself i am trusting holy on the grace of my lord jesus christ i am trusting the blood of my lord jesus christ and eternal predestination has declared i am his regardless of your accusation i don't have to answer you but look at this pilate says know us thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee you know what it's the devil that was anointing pilates right here today telling i got power over you i got power over you and i can let you go but look what our lord jesus says thou couldest have no power at all against me except for given thee from above amen amen let me just bring a little reminder from wednesday night i want to bring a little more clarity here's job living his life godly life a prosperous life i even was going to bring a scripture to this morning out of the out of the bible that's talking about when i give thee wealth god will bless you joe sitting there in all his wealth his children all around him and the devil comes and says you know i torment him i tempt him but you got a hedge around him god doesn't say well i got a hedge around him because otherwise you know you just tear him up and throw him out and god says oh no no no no i've got a hedge around him but i'll tell you what i'll do i'll open the hedge and you can tempt him and try him you can do anything you want to him you just can't take his life i want to bring this clarity in case there was any misunderstanding on wednesday you see with that you can't take his life god put a hedge around the devil he just limited what the devil could do to job did he say you can't do this to him you can't do that to him you can't kill his children no he was talking because god the author of eternal life said i'll restore all the rest of this it's job we're talking about right now now look at that when god put that hedge around the devil he limited right i hope you guys can catch us he limited satan's authority [Music] while the devil still had a lot of liberty he brought job down to the point he even questioned who am i what am i doing here and why is this i serve god faith you must be a secret sinner no i tell you i guarantee you saints if we were there job didn't say no i'm not i can declare job said i am not a secret sinner i know my righteous life before the lord i hope you catch this it got to a point it's starting to ebb his spirit is declining he's under such a great burden even his own wife thank god for godly wives and even his own wife was like you know what maybe you ought to just curse god because you're a miserable wreck and then god speaks to him joe where were you there you are there you are where were you joe when all of heaven was rejoicing the angels were singing and all of this was taking place where were you joe hallelujah and you know job had a revelation of predestination my brother and sister because it stroke struck his heart and he said oh amen i've always been in you lord i always was a part of you i am a son of god where were you when the sons of god sang for joy and job cut a revelation and said i was in your presence that's where i was at because if the sons of god were gathered around you singing in the heavens i am a son of god i had to be there oh and it struck him deep in his soul and right there you see a change connected in the scripture you see it change job starts looking at this differently [Music] i've heard people condemned by their own words brother branham said don't speak the devil's language condemned by those words i'm not a very good sinner brother paul every time i feel like i just get raised up to do something seems like i get slapped back down to the ground well praise the lord that hedge around you didn't let the devil take your life and you will find deliverance when the day you can stand up and say i was a son daughter of god and i was there the israel of heavens all of the galaxy and all of that was there i was in his presence singing praise to him and when you come to that place when i come to that place the devil has lost his ability to accuse you oh but as long as we stay in flesh and live in flesh and think in flesh and worship in flesh we'll never catch the intrinsic eternal value of who we really are oh hallelujah hallelujah forgive me for getting excited saints oh hallelujah yeah look at this can we say this morning would you say with me our god is in control hallelujah amen i'll tell you the devil has to ask permission for everything we ever catch that my brother and sister it'll change our approach i'm closing right here this last quote it's only 72 paragraphs long he looked down he looked at his city talking about david and he remembered when he was a little boy he used to take the sheep out by this certain pool there it was a great great water country and also bread country known there really bethlehem means a house of god's bread and then when david remembered going by there and drinking that good cool water and here he was laying up here now a fugitive away from his own people he had no place to go i'll tell you what i feel like right now i feel like a fugitive from that out there i don't understand their humor i don't understand their reasoning i don't understand their behavior i don't understand their desires we're fugitives from that yes he had no place to go and his soul must have cried for that good cool water he had some servants there my just the least of his desire was a command and they three of them fought their way through that line of philistines 15 miles seven miles or something down and back cutting their way through and brought him a drink of that water but the soul first amen now look at this it expressed oh how long to drink of that water again and these men brother trevor we could make this happen come on pulled their swords left the safety of camp marched right through amen sometimes you have to just kind of work your way around the devil he's got his little centennials out sometimes you just have to stop and say lord this world's not my home father i just need you i need you lord and god just makes it happen have you ever had that happen yeah i'll tell you i i can i could take up your whole afternoon and evening to tell you of the things that god has done that i would declare to you is impossible soul thirst something greater than what his natural desire his body he was up there probably had to drink out of anything he'd get a hold of some old goat skins and things with some old hot water in there on a hot day and he thought if i could just lay down and quench this thirst that i have if i could just go down there to bethlehem and lay down by that spring and drink and when they went down and got the water and brought it back his soul thirst come on saints his soul thirst was greater than his natural amen amen now look at this brother bud southwick you know the story tried and tried and tried to quit smoking he just couldn't i know brothers that knew him personally and he'd tell him i would just make this declaration before god and you've done it too lord if you'll just deliver for me i'll never this i'll never that and it was there then he would find himself with this craving and maybe things were stressful and he was nervous and and he would find himself lighting a cigarette smoking it again and in his heart saying oh lord i'm sorry i told you i'd quit but the soul thirst my brother and sister amen wasn't dependent on this flesh [Music] and the day come we find that story with humor well brother bill i'll go up one last time and check the horses now look at this i want you to think about this go out of the tent go out here stand way over here behind the horses the smoke doesn't go to the tent it goes off over here that's called premeditation but beyond the premeditation of the flesh brother branham was anointed of the holy spirit my brother and sister that was not william branham a man standing there sitting there laying there that was the holy spirit amen brother bud when did you quit smoking well brother bill i haven't i've tried to do this but i guess i'm just destined to be a failure i can't do this i can't do this nobody was a catalyst a spark come down struck his soul why now if you can catch what i'm saying right here here's brother bud with his soul lifted up to the lord in one hand and a cigarette in the other does that make sense to you but his heart's cry his souls cry that's it that's it was greater than his natural amen amen amen brother bud when did you quit smoking just now brother branham just now never craved another cigarette in his life amen amen what is it soul thirst sulfur saints what is it the yielding of the soul amen to god my thirst lord is for thee oh lord amen his body was up there probably had to drink out of anything he could but what was come down here look at this all happening he's looking down he's thinking about the past he's thinking about his life remembering my brother and sister all of the things god has done for him and what his desire was his soul thirst was greater not for bethlehem but from jerusalem his soul was so he sacrificed the water and said i i wouldn't even drink it now imagine brother trevor you and i must have had a real hard time when we watched this man that we love so much take this that we fought for he had no right to do that that one guy just about stabbed me through and through and this was we're so weary why but god poured out revelation and it was there that david said what's more important right so i'm going to take this thing that i just longed for in my flesh and i'm going to sanctify it i'm going to sanctify it before the lord and then i'm going to pour it out and to the human thinking they think what was that that's a god he looked down on david and said there it is he has fully yielded himself he has fully submitted himself that he will go beyond the need and desire of his flesh to give it to me oh i tell you today saints i want to be that man i want to be that believer that would take all the things of this life all the things of this world and would say lord it's more important that i pour my life out to you than it is to satisfy this flesh on the things of this earth i tell you my brother and sister that is when we have died to the flesh when we can pour our self out amen i wouldn't even drink it he poured it upon the ground see his soul was more thirsty for god was to satisfy the quench of a good his thirst of his body with a good cool water he poured it upon the ground now let's just finish this up see the house of god the soul cooling waters of jerusalem which is above jesus said in john 6 33 i am the bread of life i am the bread of life bethlehem house of god our church earthly church of god the church that's here on earth we love to go to church here on earth but greater is jerusalem that above which is above which is god jerusalem above which is god greater is that soul's thirst to be there with him yes than it would be just to satisfy yourself with joining a church somewhere see joining a church don't satisfy that thirst david proved it here the waters right from the house of god see he poured it out upon the ground to find favor to get good cool drink from god amen amen hallelujah sister emmy would you come even on that greater the thirst that's in you is that thirst of the soul thirst for god hallelujah oh to yield ourselves saints to the soul thirst the thirst of this flesh of this man of the world we live in to be able to just give ourselves yield ourselves entirely my brother and sister do you realize you know the whole story i remember reading a book many years ago amen and it was talking about the basic principles when a young man goes into the military and we wouldn't agree with their uncouth and very vile ways of doing things but their goal their goal is understandable saints they take these young men from all these backgrounds they bring them in and they insult them and they they make them tired and weary and realizing they're unable to even exist without this mechanism called the army and they just break them down and bring them to the place if they say attack that hill their answer is not well the probabilities are this and this that i'll die and there'll be this many men and this will happen and that will happen they break them down and then build them back in an image that they go yes sir and they go take the hill do you see what god's doing yes sir oh saint he's not going to insult you he's not going to break you down he's not going to tear you up but he will bring you to the place that you have submitted your life 100 to him and when he says you know i don't think you ought to do that you're going to say yes lord and when he says i want you to rise up and do battle on behalf of a brother or a sister i want you to stand in the camp for them and you'll be saying yes lord because that my brother and sister is the army of god men and women fully submitted to the word bringing to pass the word for our day oh hallelujah we will not go to heaven with our own mind [Music] only way we'll make it to heaven is the mind of christ i say my brother my sister i encourage you today as your brother is your friend just quit holding back that's right just let go you know one thing i'd say about the lord in military history there's many instances where they've set young men knowing that they would all die they sent him anyhow but you can't be that man for them because god's already that's it come on saints already imparted eternal life to you so god can't send you out on the battlefield just as a diversion [Music] because he's already given his life for you and placed it in you and that life oh get this that life will reproduce itself oh hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah oh my god i didn't give this to the brothers here this last little quote the unveiling of god that word must grow in order to grow it's got to be in the right kind of ground see and god makes a promise and it hits that heart that's it it can't fail hallelujah i'm glad the word of god has hit our heart today my brother and sister amen let's just stand and sing a song or two to the lord just a little worship amen i was so convinced today saints that i i just would do this so short but i'm telling you the lord is just laid on my heart and i just i

lives you share them but i just want you to stop and look back push recall prayers that are answered god dealing with our hearts speaking to our hearts making the way before us miracles taking place saints the body of believers is the manifested word of god in this hour hallelujah god's not going to raise up someone else that's going to show the glory of god you're it i say lord help us to be the manifested word when i think of the goodness of jesus [Music] and all he has done for me [Music] [Music] praise god for saving i want you [Music] [Music] and all he has done for me then my soul cries

to just follow that when is our next youth meeting [Music] second friday of november okay and i asked that because while you need to know i'm in the dark myself amen so be praying for our young people look good november 12th amen so i see look states i see god moving in our midst can someone say amen to that we are not just blindly stumbling along in laodicea god's in our midst and i want god to be so real in our young people that if the world says this is what i've got to offer they'll say i'm give me a moment give me a moment i'm going to run this through the filter of god's word and if it doesn't come out whole i'm rejecting it that's what i want our young people to be i don't want him to be going well do i do this do i do this where should i go what should i oh no you might be attracted to the things of the world but god will place in you the original word and you'll say i'm going to run this through the filter of the word and if it won't go through the filter not for me oh when i think of the goodness of jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] one last time and all he has done for me [Music] and my soul cries out hallelujah praise god for saving me [Applause] amen [Music] i was sitting there and i was my thoughts went off and i was like lord take my thoughts just cover them amen where the paul goes then you sit there and you have thoughts you ask the lord to come they're covered by the blood i believe he's here this morning amen i say thank you lord nadia reminded me next weekend is time change i know we all have smartphones some of us aren't as smart as our smartphones so let's just remember uh fall back so we had an hour is that right we get rid of it thank you lord so let's just remember that so i guess that would mean people if they don't do it
