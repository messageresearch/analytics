for me hey man let's just sing that chorus once i love that song [Music] whatever wherever [Music] [Music] i know that you know what's best my lord and i won't [Music] i want you amen amen that uh i watched a thing the other day about the uh one of the pilot that was supposed to be in the driver's seat for the uh the 20th commemoration or yeah 20th commemoration of 911. it was the pilot that was supposed to be in the driver's seat um of that first plane that hit the world trade centers headed for from boston to l.a and uh good good testimony um but he he ended it with what he'd written the day before prior to him taking it prior to him signing up for that flight and then getting bumped in the last 20 minutes but um he said it was his life um his life i don't know what he called it but but he said um to seek trust and glorified god through humble service and continual prayer to raise up qualified disciples and as quickly as possible so that one day i might hear god say well done my good and faithful servant amen so he wrote that the day before he was supposed to be on that flight i thought that was quite something this guy i believe god hadn't been where he was needed to be obviously so amen let's just sing that little chorus um before brother paul comes i love him i love him because he first loved me [Music] i love you [Music] because he [Music] first loved me [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] i [Music] me [Music] tell him how much you love him this morning i'm [Music] so [Music] [Music] aren't you glad today that you can sing that song with a heartfelt conviction in your soul not just words that we would we would sing not just something that we were taught but it has become revelation to us so thankful for the revelation that god has given to us in this day my brother and sister i think if we just i try not to limit as it were what you would think or have or understand but as we're going to speak a little bit further in our service i think sometimes we don't comprehend the fullness of what god is really doing in the day that we live in doing in our lives i just want to uh just to share a couple things i'm assuming because now if you'll remember sister yulia's brother depends on how you determine him and i uh communicate on the paul level but i think he's called pasha and would that be right as would be his native um he has i think announced to me so i think that's to the world that uh he is now engaged uh to a sister joy ronnie and from pennsylvania and so i'm really happy for him what a wonderful young man and i believe god's got tremendous things in store for him he has an absolute burning zeal for the gospel amen and that's one thing i just love about him and so just happy for that so we just send our congratulations and uh a beautiful young lady sent me a picture and uh just a beautiful young sister and we just pray god's blessings on them now we reported this i think or shared this i think on a wednesday night so many of you would not have uh have known this but we've also received a report back the great appreciation uh from the families that you helped send to the meetings in the ukraine and uh so they have been uh just very happy very uh uh blessed in those meetings and uh i just want to say thanks to you and supporting this church this assembly that we could help those those families many of them uh are are poor enough and we certainly don't speak that you know some people think well you know it's just terrible they're so poor but uh some of us might be a little better off if we were a little poorer we'd probably have to have a prayer life uh to see uh you know our daily needs met instead of our comfort you know taking over our our resources uh making the difference and so god just blessed that to many young people and their parents and that's how it was presented to me were focused on the young people and their parents need to travel with them but uh that god bless them so thank you for supporting the word of god and this assembly amen i want to speak to you today on redemption's manifestation once again and uh i want to as a as a title i want to um uh title it this morning interpreting the vision and uh you see my brother and sister there's other visions besides as it would be the visions that god would give to a prophet would give to seers as it were through the ages the apostles etc you see you and i have to have a vision and as we'll go right into the word this morning we will take this right out of the book of proverbs thank you sister ruth uh amen so we want to uh take this in proverbs the 29th chapter the 18th verse just a simple single scripture to start our thought today and uh proverbs 29 18 says where there is no vision the people perish but he they keep of the law happy is he heavenly father ask your blessings on the word today in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now as we look at this we understand through the ages that uh god always wanted his people to be focused my brother and sister god is not wanting us to wander to and fro or lose our vision and and uh just to give a little uh thought as it were of what we're going to speak on today the definition of the word vision is eyesight the ability to see or the ability to think about or plan the future and so we'll look at this and realize what god is giving when he wanted to give to his people a vision that they could see it's not just about as i said prophetic vision coming to prophets and apostles etc but my brother and sister it is that the people you and i need a vision for the day that we live in amen we see in the word that every time the church lost its vision uh it wandered into trouble and we'll see and i use for an example today goshen amen so here is a time that israel now has come and maybe it was lost in the time maybe it wasn't i don't know exactly but you know the word of god was that after that i will let them dwell in the land for 400 years and then he said i will deliver those people and so in goshen god made a covenant to them that he would deliver or take them into the promised land and my brother and sister you know it seems simple as you read the scripture and i didn't include all of them today certainly you can look them up and read them but you see those things were a promise that god made many years so more than 400 years before and god says you know i'm going to deliver you i'm going to deliver you out of their hands but it's not that god just called you out when god calls you out he has some place for you to go amen so he didn't call us as a people out just to leave us sitting out here wondering what our future is but he whatever he has called you out of he has called you to enter into and so it's there as we'll see that how that in goshen uh this covenant is starting to take place and the supernatural my brother and sister they had no ability as it is to deliver themselves out of the hands of pharaoh or out of the the kingdom of of uh pharaoh and and so but god made this promise and so we see these things start to come and they're coming to pass and here is this promise amen to deliver now being fulfilled it is a prophecy that is coming to pass and i say we need to we have my brother and sister the scope of all the years of prophecy all of this scripture through the ages has spoke of this day and we need to be aware and when i say aware don't go try and just study this out but by prayer let revelation show you that the prophecies are coming to pass we are witnesses today if we are paying attention amen if if we're not we can look and say oh my what is happening in our nation look my brother and sister prophecy right in our day right within you know generations of us right here prophecies that said we will see the fall and we'll see the rising and we're seeing that we're seeing corporations and we're seeing nations now looking as it is to the church the one true and only church for advice my brother and sister but yet you see that one true and only church has its own scandals and its own issues and whatever you see what the anointing is they're looking it's the prophecy that's pointing them back it's not the leadership or the value of that leadership it's the prophecy that's causing them to turn and look back to that it is there my brother and sister that the prophecy should be causing you and i in the day that we live in to stop and look to what the promise to you and i is it is not my brother and sister that just simply oh these things are taking place this is prophecy fulfilled this is the word coming to life in our presence amen so you see many of these people coming out of goshen in that day you see the promise was there but these people had a different vision of what was taking place all they cared about brother branham talks about this mixed multitude that was coming out of egypt he talks about the mixed multitude that's in the midst of the church but you see many of these people's vision was simply to get out of egypt it was not a deliverance from their own self not a submission to god almighty to jehovah but it was simply lord i want out of my present circumstance and i will follow this i will follow this plan this program and i'll just be a little bold this morning to say there's too many people around the message that weren't happy in denomination so they followed the message out but they're not looking for where the message was called to take them they just want it delivered from as it were their own self or their own denominational things and it's there that they're not looking they didn't have a vision of where the word for our day said i'm taking you amen oh god help us because you see people have different vision of what is taking place this mixed multitude this vision that was revealed as it were in that land now i want you to just follow because i want to move quickly today you see the vision look saints i'm talking you this morning not not someone else not another place the vision that we have god will test you to prove your vision their vision was started to be revealed the minute they got to the red sea where was the people that rose up and said praise the lord i got an obstacle called the red sea in my way but i've got a god that said he's delivering me to a promised land so whatever this obstacle is it must be removed in the name of jesus christ but instead an obstacle come and it started the red sea started to reveal the vision they held and the revision they held did not cause them to come and have a great revival and crying out to god but it was words of doubt and fear and i just read a little dear deal my brother and sister then that it was on the internet or whatever and it's there and look at the spirit that is in the land today they have no fear of god but they fear the plague that was a spirit of egypt they feared the plagues but they did not have there was no revival broke out in egypt there was no crying out to god they were angry at god but they were terrified of the plague you see the bride of jesus christ was not called to be afraid of the plague they were called to be concerned as as brother isaac just read that it struck my heart it's that i would be pleasing i want to hear the voice can you say amen i want to hear the voice well done my good and faithful servant i don't want to hear any other voice out here no other voice even matters amen and so we see the red sea revealed the vision that they held and the serpents in the wilderness revealed a little bit more of their vision you realize my brother and sister god never brings judgment well giving us as it is a warning but he gives us a way out of judgment god will never judge a people without having provided them do you realize that those people that were dying in the wilderness had a brazen serpent they could look to but that wasn't their vision and they died because of it you say how can that be all they had to do the word of the hour was look to the brazen serpent and you shall live but they could they wouldn't they didn't and then we see my brother and sister the golden calf revealed even more of their vision they come to a place moses is on the mountain and they're like moses is gone we don't know what happened to him we don't know where he's at but what we want to do everybody you know my my this is not a real ring it's it's a it's a but you know they had their rings of gold and they took their earrings it says off and their bracelets and their rings and they cast them in the pot and they melted them down and they poured them and made a brazen calf so quickly from the removal i hope you get this so quickly from the removal of the prophet from their presence telling them day by day what they must do day by day giving the leadership so quickly when he is in the mountain that they said hey let's go back to what we were doing let's go back to where we were from this leadership is not getting us to the land it never was moses leadership it always was god's leadership and i want to say the same today my brother and sister people are saying we're waiting for brother branham to come back look why do we need brother branham to come back it was the leadership of almighty god in our day a vindicated word that a prophet faithfully brought to us and why do we need to go back because he himself said he is here he is here and he is in his people once again amen amen so we didn't need to go back but so quickly so quickly removed that the people their vision was not of the promise that god had given but of the circumstances that surrounded them and you know what comes to a head at katy's barney and you know i've often spoke of this because this strikes me as very real because my brother and sister once again please forgive me for my redundancy but once again we'll see this that the negative had come out so often that the people themselves were doubting what god had in store for them and when the spies went into the land they come back with everything that the word said they would come back with but the ministry amen said you know what church brothers sisters young people it's so hard to live the message in september of 2021. so hard we can't do it laodicea is such a giant in our midst so what we're going to do is reinterpret the vision we're going to restructure it and when we go out and we do these things we're going to just say god understands [Music] but my bible says in acts 2 that you repent you don't say yep god understands see they've changed the vision to god understands when god said repent amen and so it's there the restructuring and the kadish barnia the people had been so under an influence and you say now brother paul why are you making influence well i will here uh make a point here in a minute but my brother and sister they had a choice on that day to listen to what the truth of the promise was which was joshua and caleb right representing christ and his uh support or ministry amen and so they had a choice between believing that or believing the multitude of ministry amen and all they had to do i made this i don't know why i'm making the point quite this way but you see all they had to do that day and i want to say this please hear me all they had to do was not they didn't have to explain it they didn't have to have all the bullet points and the references and be able to speak it all out well this is why that happened this and this is coming like this all they had to do is come to a point and say amen to the word so be it lord you called me out and i know that you call me in and i say amen to that lord that's all they had to do saints amen and god would activate that in their life and they would have walked across but they come to the place they no longer were able now get this it wasn't that they were unable to say amen to the preaching they were unable to say amen to the word see it can be preached brother branham says even falsehood has an element of truth what happened kadis barney of the people responded it says all of israel cried that night and and we know that joshua caleb and those with them they cried because the people had just rejected god not in their mind though their vision was they were still israel we're god's chosen people but in god's vision they had to stand on the word not wavering not fearing not backing away from not parrying it down not trying to oversimplify it or make it over complicated just simply take the word say amen to it and let the power of the word move in their life and that's all we have to do in the hour we live in my brother and sister we don't need to over complicate this we don't need to oversimplify this we need to just look at the word and what the word says we say amen to that and then let the word change our lives amen and so this happens there at cadiz barney all because they had not gotten god's vision they had their own vision they had their ministry's vision you see they failed to see god's mighty hand they didn't realize that all that had happened up to this point was god's mighty hand on their life and you'll see my brother and sister 17 times in the bible that uses the words mighty hand and you'll see every one of them is talking about the power of god not one single word about the mighty hand of satan but we got to stop and say you know what the power that's behind me the power as it were that controls my life the power that guides me is not satan it's not his dominion it's not his right it's jesus christ it's the word in you coming to life is the guiding bride amen now we look at this i want you to see as we go to revelations uh the first chapter 17 through 20 and we'll look at this here and when i saw him this is john now this is the revelation of the end time are you with me this is not revelation for days gone by this is revelation of the end time the apocalypse amen when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i'm the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore right so this right here my brother and sister is god declaring to the world i am eternal life amen so this is our you know controversy in the in the religious world when brother branham says that hell is not eternal yes sir that would mean hell had to come out of god not so i'm alive forevermore amen and how keys of hell and death write the things which thou hast seen now my brother and sister you can take this and move this that thou has seen over to take and write the things you saw in the vision see it's what he saw right there it was the vision and what we have now in the book of revelation is the vision that god revealed to john and john wrote it and become the written word to you and i so my brother and sister if we get in the spirit do you believe in getting in the spirit just to read your bible amen it doesn't do good to just read it like some carnal thing you know like we're reading a romance or we're reading a western or we're reading history or whatever it is it won't do you any good to just approach it that way you need to get in the spirit when when you get in the spirit my brother and sister you start to see in the word much deeper than the old carnal flesh can ever see amen so it's there that it without revelation and getting in the spirit the very thing that john wrote was meant not to just be seen by john but written in the in the pages of our bible now that revelation is being witnessed or seen by a bride in our day you realize that you are seeing the same vision that john saw on that time the same mystery revealed that was revealed to john in that day was not to meant to remain hidden but it says that in the last days that the mystery of christ should be revealed i'm just paraphrasing this should be revealed to his bride so it's not just uh something to go on that our mystery remains and we go through life wondering what god intended god intended for you in the spirit to be able to see in the word what john saw otherwise the mystery past with john that's right so if the mystery passed with john there would be no need for you and i to read it but that's not what the word declared to us it declared to us we take the book we eat it and it's going to be sweet in our mouth come on come on preach with me this morning it's going to be sweet in our mouth but the minute i have to live what i said amen to it becomes hard it becomes bitter to us but we don't quit do we that's not what we were called we're not called to be quitters we're not called to go back amen i'm not called you know my my daddy come from a catholic background my mama come from actually uh very far back you might say through my grandmother and lds or if you take it right at what my grandmother was bible missionary i'm not called to go back to that i'm called to go to the word you are called not to go back to what you come out of but to go to the word so we're not called to go back we're called to go forward we're called to keep marching keep moving amen so he's there declaring i am he that liveth and was dead talking to the resurrection behold i'm alive forever more talking of eternal life and have keys of hell and of death in other words i control it the devil has not one thing my brother and sister we have to be afraid of now i hope when you catch this you can bring this down further in the service right to things which thou has saw in the vision and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter and i put verse 20 on there but you can read that uh speaking of the uh seven star seven golden candlesticks now as we look at this my brother and sister john what did john see the unfolding word see john didn't have just one flash that god tried to imprint upon his mind but he saw an unfolding taking place he saw something coming to pass he saw revelation being revealed and it comes down and it might be pardon me for putting it this way it would be as though we were seeing a love story unfolding you see when we are looking in life and we'll just use a young man and a young woman for example we'll see them they're first introduced and my brother and sister you know i kind of believe in love at first sight but we won't go into that but you see true love cannot really honestly be manifested until it spent about 30 40 or 50 years together there is the true manifestation of love the endurance the test of time the nature as it would be being revealed and opened up to where somebody would say what would your wife do now most men would say i don't know i wouldn't understand my wife but the truth of it is people be able to say what was your wife doing this and you'll know because you've seen her and watched her and lived with her all these years what would your husband do well you can just say well i don't know he might do this he might do that no really what would he do well i he would do this because it's a revelation that is there and so we see how that this book of revelation is showing it has a lot of negative things god doesn't want us to be naive god doesn't want us to sit here look my brother and sister you want to entertain yourself sorry i have a very sick mind when it comes to entertainment you want to entertain yourself just go on the internet what is the antichrist it's biden it's trump it's this it's that it's it's a monsanto it's this over here and it's that over there you see my brother and sister you won't find the truth of that because the revelation of revelation of the apocalypse amen the book is not revealed to them they're not seeing the vision coming to pass they're not following the timeline they're looking at what they think is evil their vision of what is evil i find it interesting talk to a catholic that says monsanto is the antichrist now you don't have to like monsanto that's fine but you see my brother and sister they don't have revelation of what the underlying spirit is that's it they don't have revelation of what is what is what are you with me so john's seeing this vision but let's look at this there's a lot in the book of revelation that concerns the antichrist and the spirit in those churches and those people and what they will do and what they will say and how they will behave but let's focus my brother and sister on the portion of the book of revelation this is john's vision that he has written out and that come from god and now we're looking this uh the only part that really should matter to you is in this vision john sees the bride john saw the bride a living breathing people not figurative not historical but a living breathing people that were manifesting the word of god for their day that's what the whole vision was about my brother and sister the vision was not to warn you of what will be the antichrist because god promptly said i'll be with you right that means he's here i'll be in you amen that means he's here to the end to the end come on saints somebody get excited about this you might be struggling with things in life you might have discouragements you might have whatever but he said you can look down to the end and i'll be there and not just as a witness i'll be in you in other words do you know what that means that means that you carried christ as though you were birthing a child you carried christ to the end it's in you and it's living it's not aborted it's not dead it's alive hallelujah you see john's seeing the bride john saw you imagine now look some people say this is a bit too far for their taste and that is just fine but did you know when the prophet of god went beyond the curtain of time right have you read that story enough to really be able to just recount it in your mind right now if you haven't go back and read it again you see when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time and he's there and these multitude of people now people focus on all these sisters and there was no physical attraction no whatever and they hugged him and all of this they get all this but my brother and sister do you realize the prophet of god what he's seeing there is seeing the bride amen now he's seeing the saints of the ages right we don't have an exclusive right because of laodicea as the bride see the bride is all those through the ages that god gathered together so he's seeing the bride and in that realm of the bride the prophet of god get this now the prophet of god is speaking in a present tense because he's speaking of that 90 some year old woman that sister that he led to the lord she's there so this is not my brother and sister just the saints of ages gone by but this was a very present time a very present uh of vision or revelation to the prophet now my brother and sister let me exp exfoliate this and take this over the prophet of god has the vision and here comes the worldly church and she's mincing to the spirit of rock and roll it's not always about the music young people or maybe even old people that still have music problems there's a spirit behind it because if there wasn't a spirit behind it there wouldn't be that kind of music so it's there that you be careful please i just asked you as your brother as your friend as a pastor and be careful of the spirit of the music that you listen with you say well i only listen to christian music my brother and sister there's christian music now i hope you find the humor in this there's christian music that i'm listening to not directly or intentional or every day because i just not a music person but i'm hearing that and you know what happens i spent my time in the world the words that go through my mind to that music are not christian words you say well brother paul there's only so much music to put it to the spirit behind it and i'll get in trouble and rightfully so if i start hunting or speaking anything out and i don't want to be i don't want to be punished for that but you see my brother and sister what they've done satan is so clever he just put new words on the same spirit and the same music and the same beat and called it new music called it christian amen that you listen to it and it will bring the same spirit that it would whether it was of these others and i'm trying to restrain myself from even naming names but you see my brother and sister it's that spirit it don't matter the words that's put to it it's the spirit that underlines or carries it and so that's what satan has done he's put these new words and called it christian but my brother and sister it never brings the spirit of god you want to judge the music you're listening to you listen to that and see if it actually truly speaks of jesus christ lord and savior and actually brings the presence of god to you and if it doesn't do that my brother and sister you know there's some of this music out here don't know why i'm on this but some of this music out here that's called christian music you listen to it objectively and you will find it does not speak specifically of one thing concerning god it's a lot of repetitive words that makes you feel good it gets you in the mood it gets you in the motion it gets you into the deal and people jump and shout and twirl and raise their hands but my brother and sister that same words could be then spoke of the devil and would bring the exact same results you see this vision that john saw concerning the bride john's seen you oh let me take this back i got sidetracked there amen look when the prophet of god looks out there and he sees the worldly church and he comes and they are mincing young ladies i'm going to speak just real bold this is why brother paul is very much against the high heels the prophet of god was against the high heels and you do this but you look in the vision are you with me is it okay this is not my vision but the prophet of god said he saw that christian church and they were mincing they were walking in such a fashion anyway i won't go there there was something seductive about it okay i might miss this forgive me i'm just getting i realize i'm just getting a little old but i tell you what you take the same girl you put her in a pair of flat type shoes i'm not talking i'm not against heels just be reasonable you put it in that and then you put them in some big old toe heels and video it moms if you want your daughters to know what they look like you put them in a pair of flat shoes and you video them walking and then you put them in a set of high heels right before you throw them in the dumpster and uh you video how they walk in them high heels and you'll see there is a change same girl might be the same girl reading her bible you know praising the lord thanking god for good but there is a change that comes with that i don't know where that come from that was free today but you look at this my brother said it's the spirit behind it and john has a vision and what he's seeing is the bride of christ and here comes the worldly church he's mincing along amen barely covered horribly i just you know we see that and brother branham's grieved in his heart and he's like oh lord is this all my ministry has produced is this all the preaching of the word that god is gracious that we then see oh this real bride of christ dressed as it was in their native clothes amen which is going to be with the bride of christ holiness regardless of what you call native it's hopeliness my brother and sister the prophet of god talking about being in africa and preaching and there is those blanket natives that are naked they didn't know any different they're just what they are them sisters they're just dressed that's life this is the way history has been forever but at the preaching of the word covered themselves up and so god dealing with that and when god saw he sees a bride and what's she doing she's not i won't mention names i said i wasn't going to she's not listening to modern christian music she's not listening to satan's version christian music she's listening or singing onward christian soldier why because she identified who she was she knows who she is i'm not a spectator i'm a soldier i was called to fight and i have fought the good fight of faith can we say that testimony i have fought the good fight of faith amen because you see this vision is so much greater than satan wants it to be to you you see if satan can just keep this and intellectual eyes if he can intellectualize the word to us if he can formalize the message that's right turn it into an old cold letter that's it you know what i'm afraid saints look i'm going to be a little blunt today forgive me but i'm afraid too many of us have a little checklist i've done that there's no moving of the spirit there's no outpouring of the holy spirit there's no sincerity and and dedication and uh you know surrendering of ourselves we just i did this and i did this and i did this and i did this until oh it's all done that's not what it's about it's about the outpouring of the holy spirit in our life amen which is christ himself the word made living amen so satan's trying to intellectualize this to us he's trying to formalize it to us where we just say i went to church i participated amen i sang every song they sang when they clapped i clapped when they did all this and you know what that is bringing about that's called the traditionalizing of the deal oh when we come to do this we do this and when this happens we do this and and uh well look i'm not against this saint you ought to know by now i don't know why i shouldn't even defend myself here but when we come to the point that we can only sing three songs and then introduce the minister and this and that because that's what it says in church order we've totally lost what the prophet of god was talking about he was talking about the leadership of the holy spirit not turning the pre-service into a giant specials and song service and i'm going to sing so people will see me today and i'm going to do this and we're going to do that and we're going to tell folk stories and give history amen i've got some stories to share with you i would love burning in my heart the grace of god what he's doing but you see we have to do those things at the right time in the right order we don't just do it because we feel like it amen so you see satan wanted to traditionalize amen in other words we could publish a message-wide book on how to hold church oh wait we already have that it's what people have done to the church order book you guys sing too many songs your pre-service is too long the prophet of god said you could preach 15 20 30 minutes and the people come prayed up they would get it well good sometimes we have to preach 15 20 30 minutes just to break the ice so those that are criticizing at least the time of the service and how that is going too long don't realize it took that long to break through their laodicean shell they brought to church [Music] see we've got to get it right and i'm not preaching against your anxious saints i'm just telling you amen so it comes down to we've we're traditionalizing you know what traditionalizing was it's a sign of a denominational spirit entering in now this church triumphant that john was preaching to right john wasn't speaking to the church defeated was he and we didn't come here this morning i pray as the church defeated we come here as a church triumphant today amen you don't have to lift your hand but i hope you can lift it in your heart and say absolutely i come today and was not bound by the spirit of laodicea when i come to church this morning amen i am triumphant amen so john is speaking of these things and what is he seeing he's seeing the church triumphant is also seeing because of the word and the nature of god the church triumphant is seeing the unfolding of the word just as john saw the unfolding of the word and he wrote it i want to ask you this morning maybe i'm being blunt what would you write when you look at the vision pretty quiet around here your vision of who you are as a message believer if it was asked to be put to the page what would you write we should be able to write i am sad discouraged weak no sir i am triumphant i am an overcomer i am the word made flesh on september 19th 2021 amen and i will be the same tomorrow morning and the morning after in the morning after and the morning after that is my story this is my song this is my story hallelujah amen you know what's happening satan's coming you know believe it or not it was actually quite pretty i'll use it for an example you know after it rained the other day the very next morning looking out from behind our house just a fog bank going up through the little draw little valley right there just to fog back you couldn't see anywhere you know too many of us walk around with our head in a fog bank because satan is doing his best to cloud your vision i i couldn't possibly be the bride i couldn't possibly be victorious i couldn't because if i was honest with you see sometimes it's good we're supposed to share you know our faults with one another but sometimes it's probably good that we're not that honest because otherwise we'd be speaking the devil's language all the time i failed here i failed there and i snapped at the wife and i snapped at the children i snapped at the husband i snapped at the children i think my mom and dad are horrible why because our vision is clouded all we're doing is looking right here we're struggling to even see what this is all about saints and satan don't mind that you believe the message and you believe god sent a prophet satan don't mind any of that if he can cloud your vision to what the true uh vision or the true prophecy was for our day amen so you see brother brown shows us clearly through the word that god interprets his own word by bringing it to pass now the fact that you're sitting here this morning and you have a desire to serve god is the word coming to pass in the day that we live in because satan is doing his very best to bring us to a place now come on i think somebody will probably have to say amen if you really believe this in your heart every one of us comes against obstacles that we don't have a clue how we're going to deal with it and we feel like we failed the the the trial we feel like we come so short of this and we look at that and if we're not careful we dwell on that can someone say amen we dwell on those things and that is not god's vision of who you are that is satan's vision of who you are and he's clouding your vision that all you see is someone who continually falls short of what god has called them to do but there's that spark that's down in the soul there's something that's stirring us and we can't quit we can't walk away we can't lay down and give satan a victory we're gonna stand because there's something that's in you amen and so god is interpreting his word in your life by bringing the very life of christ to stand as a pillar in the laodicean age the word says to those that overcome will i make a trash can in the house of god no sir he said i will make them a pillar what is a pillar is not blown by winds of doctrine a pillar is not tossed to the side a pillar is an integral part of the very structure of the building of the church of almighty god and god said i'm going to put you right there in my house and i'm going to make you solid and strong to stand the test of time amen and when so many are falling away my brother and sister you look at this come on i don't want to speak negative of them i don't i pray they come back but my brother and sister if you are not a pillar in other words an overcomer the day will come when the perfect storm will toss you to the side that's right and you say i wasted my whole life i've heard it out of their mouths i wasted 30 years of my life following this message what is that somewhere along the line they never got serious enough with god and dug in to the vision to realize who they were because you see my brother and sister this message now i don't hold don't hold me judgmental to these words this message is not about all these doctrines it's not about god sending a prophet it's not about all of this and that and what church and what part of the world and how big these things are and how well we're known this message is all about you seeing who you are in jesus christ because if you never see that you will never see the true vision of the word revealed in our day you have to see who you are oh our pastor he's this most spiritual man i will do you a bit of good won't do you a bit of good he could be a holy ghost-filled man the power of god dwelling in him exuding that everywhere he goes but if you don't see who you are all you'll be able to do is acknowledge how great they are and the only one we're supposed to acknowledge how great he is is christ and the word says christ in you is the hope of glory hallelujah see so we look at this he's trying to do this now amen don't let satan interpret the word for you you know it's interesting let me just use this little example meet him one man walks out says he called me a buzzer and then you walked out someone say amen then you walk out and you're happy hope you don't mind a little dancing i'm not trying to become some pentecostal but i'm telling you as i get older it's just a little harder to keep from just getting loose in the joints and oh thank you lord because i walked out you've walked out and our testimony our vision was he called me an eagle hallelujah i'm not a buzzard i'm an eagle oh people all that yeah well that was just a point he was trying to make i think it's revelation i think it's revelation because too many people be i'm a churchgoer sorry i don't care you're a church-goer you're either a buzzard or an eagle because there's only two spirits in the church and you're eating the dead things or you're eating a living word hallelujah well amen don't satan interpret the word deal and don't let him mold your vision that's right have you ever had any setbacks come on somebody can say amen to that have you ever i want to get down and just dig right in your rubbish pile have any of you ever yesterday fought said watched read did and then today the wheel falls off the car and you're like god's punishing me for yesterday well there's a few honest people around you know god doesn't work that way no sir praise the lord did say well yeah lucifer that one right there inside the hedge you can do everything you want to him oh how many of you want to be a job i don't see any hands i don't see any amens i don't see anybody jumping up and saying me lord but i want to be a job regardless of what comes with it why because god said my servant job will stand the test i have confidence in my servant job and you can do anything you want but take his life hallelujah you know what that wasn't god trying to see if a social experiment would work that's a god with confidence and he knew that joe would sit there and go my what's happening to me why did i do wrong and all these friends you secret sinner you did this you must have done that and job my brother and sister read the words you'll see for a little season he believed but god said now my servant job is flesh he's human that's right and so what i'm going to do is come down at the right time i could sit back and say we'll just see what god what's going to happen here whether he'll continue to serve me what's he going to do god knew what he do the right time he put just a little word down to job job my servant where were you amen thank you lord hallelujah in a minute we're going to get if i'll just preach and be quiet we'll get to the point of where were you amen hallelujah well you know what satan interprets the word or tries to interpret it to you he's trying to mold your veer and i hear people say oh i'm sorry to bring this out this way but i hear people say i do this because of this i'm living like i do because of this i'm doing what is because of this i am living or doing what i'm doing because of a bad ministry that i set under i do this because the ministry i sit under is so wonderful have you ever noticed that when you have a service evangelist been down on his face praying anointed of god to bring a word and his word to you is praise god we're the bride we're overcomers we're strong the devil's defeated he's underneath my feet and people just jump oh praise god hallelujah and aisles are full and the people oh praise god i just love this ministry i feel so strong in a month or two another evangelist comes that's got a different anointing and he says it's time for you to get in your closet under your bed and get the sin out the reason god's not moving in your midst is because of the little things and all them people that were in the aisle dancing oh praise god just love this you don't hear a single word out of them why one anointed the spirit and the other one is dealing with the actual soul amen and one give them a vision how glorious they are with the true vision see both of these brothers preach the truth but the other one says look you've got to keep if my wife was sitting here i would use it for an example just not quite the same in a wafer but the other one says i want you to pull up the hymn and i want to see if your hymn's clean or not because the true bride's vision is not even one smudge amen oh god help us god help us not even one smudge on the hem of our garment but we so love that ministry that's telling us we're all going in a rapture glorious hallelujah the devil's under our feet but the one who says i want you to look at the hem of your garment today every one of you i want you to look in the closet i want you to look under the bed i want you to get all the dust bunnies out of your life i want you to take the time to clean the hem of your garment and it's a little harder to deal with that because that doesn't really anoint us to sing and shout but it should it should because it's god loving you so much see we think the one is loving us so much and the other one's so hard on us he's legalists my brother and sister do you know the one over here that's correcting you is actually a greater sign of god's love to you because he wants you to be right he wants you to come and be able to be presentable to him he doesn't want to see you fail hallelujah let me go back to this i do it because of bad ministry i do it because our pastor our ministry is so awesome i do this because of someone so said to i do this because the word said to that should be our resting place bad ministry i don't know about your history i think i could be like the apostle paul amongst you i have seen it all i've heard it all i've experienced it all and i wanted to quit i thought i had quit i ran away i come back i gotta see it happen all over again and i couldn't quite because if it was about bad ministry i don't know where i'd be oh i i don't think it was my nature i won't be out here in a bar room or a dance hall i'd probably be on a dirt bike or a jet boat or you know up in the mountains somewhere on a four-wheeler you know worshiping god in the woods that's a doctrine in the message i'm telling you it's a doctor and messy i'm not talking about going camping going hunting those things i'm talking about those people are like no i don't go to church because i i go up in the woods and i've got the message and i commune with god find me a scripture for that one i'm not stomping on anybody's toes and if i do let me know i'll step on them harder what i do this because the word says so that should be what motivates us now let's look at the absolute hope you guys didn't put a roast in the oven the absolute brothers amen now look at this how did michaela know he was right he waited he had a vision they had a vision too but the vision didn't compare with the word and today the same thing see brother brown takes us out of history puts it right back in our day and so michaela knew he was right because he waited and he had a vision but they had a vision too i tell you what if i had a dollar for every time somebody's told me well i prayed about it and the lord told me to do this and you can sit there dumbfounded and say um that's contrary to the scripture but you see they won't move this there's a young man i i cared about him very much had a connection with him all the years and and he had got divorced and was going to get remarried and to a divorced woman and i i begged him in the name of jesus christ don't do this and he looked me in the face and said you don't know what god's doing in my life but i know what the word says see i i don't know honestly i don't know what's happening in your life but i know what the word says see so it becomes very difficult and people say they feel like they've got a green light i prayed about this my brother and sister the division man and today the same thing make a paired his vision with the word and then he seen he and the word was together today if your vision is contrary to the word leave it alone because it's the wrong absolute michael's absolute was exactly with the word so he could stand and say he and what he said and believe it i like that you know i'm really sad to say this and i don't want you to feel sorry for me but i had a brother tell me brother paul you're getting a reputation as a hardliner legalist am i a legalist church i don't think i am you know why i couldn't speak with confidence and say i'm not a legalist because i'm only saying i'm only saying amen remember i joked here a few years ago about the deal i got in the mail the church building program just three simple payments of i forget what it was 675 dollars through three simple payments triple the size of your church in a few months on the program i could give you names of message people they said brother paul we're going to move to idaho and attend your church and this moment right now they don't even serve god now you might think i'm a hardliner all right when i say thank you lord they never moved here because then we just have to go through the grieving process of them leaving and walking away from the word of god you don't think god's hand of mercy is upon us god's hand of mercy is upon us saints why because we're going to take a stand and we'll stand with that long enough that we can with all of our hearts amen not with some little doubt that's hanging in the background about is this the truth but we know because it lines up with the word hallelujah now you see let's see god's god's vision of you let's just go real quick into uh oh did i skip over that amen one was the absolute perseverant let's let's do this i want to just reiterate this sorry you see perseverant brother brown once again says uh when there was 400 well-dressed prophets standing there saying to ahab and them go up the lord's with you michael said go on up if you want to but the lord told me and i seen israel scattered like sheep on a hill and let me just say this saints i i want to drive this home to you you'll know where i'm at i don't want to see you scattered i want to see you gathered around the word of god i don't want to see you going helter skelter because this was a flavor that you lack and that's a flavor that you like we ought to be men and women enough to stand on the word and hold on to the truth even if we have to say ouch i see israel scattered like sheep on a hill why when 400 prophets prophesying contrary to what he was how could he be so sure because his vision compared with the word of god that's the reason he noted oh how i wish i had about an hour now to preach right there if your vision don't compare with the word forget about your vision my name's not jim jones i'm not taking you down to always get them mixed up diana yeah guyana and when everything's falling apart i'm not going to ask you to drink the lemonade why because the word won't let us go there this is not a man's idea this is not a man's program this will not be a man who makes this fulfill or fail it is god himself he said i've come in laodicea i hope you catch this i've come in laodicea to take you to the promised land no different than coming down to egypt into goshen and saying i have come to deliver my people he has made the same covenant covenant in the day that we live and i've come to deliver my people amen all we have to do is catch god's vision and we will see exactly what's going on amen god has a can anyone show me scripture where god ever was sloppy did god ever lower the standard no sir the priests walked into the holiest of holies and if everything was not in order you want to know the attention to detail that be there you know how men we stand our wives will say well how do i look sometimes there's no right answer but if you knew it was life and death you'd be telling your wife i don't think that's appropriate that's right but it is life and death yes sir imagine the high priest going into the whole list of hopeless how he must have stood there with his contemporaries and so brothers go down through the list what did god say we have the thread we have this we have the pomegranates we have this we've been anointed with the oil it's dripping off of our head down our beard running down and dripping on the floor everything is over and the final must have christ himself upon him amen you know what their solution was knowing that anyone unclean cannot go in there instead of having tradition of perfection in christ we tie a rope around their right foot so we can drag them back out would it be much better that we would look through god's word and say lord i caught your vision that's it you don't want me to look like leo to see you you don't want me to act like a legacy of talk like leo to see a sing like leo to see him you don't want me to dance like laodicea you don't want me and people go oh it's this old-fashioned yeah it is i'm sorry it's just really old-fashioned dates back before the foundation of the world that's pretty old-fashioned isn't it reason you know how i wished about about an hour if your vision don't compare with the forget about your vision when you know your vision is lined in the word you talk about a confident saints see now right along this my brother and sister will look let's see god's vision of you are we okay can i can i kind of finish this morning i i don't want to mess up anybody's plans but i'll tell you what my plans are to make a rapture and i got to feed on the word of god so i'll be ready strong enough to make it amen now when their eyes were opened they knew him brother branham says here he says and as i said last evening god has lauded that his scripture from the beginning before there was any time when he was eternal he he'll he is the eternal one now i want to say right here my brother and sister let me put this out this is god's vision of you okay this is not a man's this is not brother branham's this is god's vision he is the eternal there was any time when he was eternal his eternal one and when these things is happening now are only the attributes of god's thinking at first it has to be a thought then a word and a word when a thought expressed is a word and then it's spoken it has to happen amen amen we shall overcome i shall overcome by the blood of the lamb by the spoken word that's not the correct version but there comes a time that you have to speak and then it's spoken it has to happen and the whole thing is god unfolding himself in his attributes and then god being made material tangible that we can talk to speak with in his whole church body and everything therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life you can't have it any other way you see we were in his thinking from before the foundation of the world my brother and sister this isn't just something happening here oh look with this message people have an established date for the message of the hour i understand human thinking brother brother branham's ministry started here 1933. i'm sorry the message i believe started before there was even an earth well see you can't have it no other way amen brothers clicked to the other side that quote if you got eternal life you can somebody read it for me if you got eternal life you always was see if otherwise you can't just say well i belong to church i do this no sir see this is back to it i belong to the church and that's why i do what i do because i belong to the church no i'm sorry i don't know why i'm going to say this lord do i shall i say this do you know if you were mormons they'd walk right down and they'd knock on your door god bless you brother our research shows you made a hundred and five thousand dollars last year give us your tithe most of you would rebel scream and hauler but you wouldn't if he was a mormon because according to mormon teaching you ain't making it to heaven unless you pay your tithe now look at the view of free moral agency god opens the door for you to decide what you want to do nobody's knocking on your door see so it isn't because i belong to the church that i do these things no sir eternal life never had uh he started to say beginning i'm quite sure anything that was eternal never did begin and cannot end so you were only in his thinking your name who you are and what you are that's the only way you could ever have eternal life because you always love i think i'm just gonna praise the lord i always was hallelujah it was not the day that i got over my rebellion it wasn't the day i did this the day i did that it was god's ordained plan that i always was a son of god hallelujah that ought to make you happy when you look back on yesterday or last week or whatever struggles you've had disappointment you've had how you critically thought about yourself and the devil's condemned you i want this to rise up in your thinking devil it wasn't just because of this is the reason i am it's because i always was part of god i always was his position he always claimed me and it won't be some failure on my part that will kick me out of the kingdom of god because the word will come and change me oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh you see the whole thing is god unfolding himself in his attributes god being made material now what's this deal around the message saints of these people that almost act like when brother branham's reading the word and talking about god in you that that's just a reference to the holy ghost and you have to reference it as the holy ghost it can't be any other fashion because he's he said how many times go look it up how many times the prophet of god speaks of god in you if it been once we might have put it off to a figure of speech twice repetition of the figure of speech in the hundreds i think he knew what he was talking about but yet there's spirit that has invaded the message you know what i think it is i think it's a denominational spirit i think it's people that want to be whatever they was before and believe the message at the same time amen that's right well hallelujah hallelujah this is what satan's trying to hide saints that's right he's trying to cloud your vision that if you ever had eternal life it's because you always was and the reason that you're here and you believe the word in your life has been changed is because god gave you eternal life you're not here by a mistake it's not some accident that you accidentally just got into this and i'm hanging out with this fellowship god's shaking those out do you know i do you want to know a timepiece would you like a little timepiece today not a deep revelation did you know that the first initial spirit that was amongst the apostles and amongst those early believers and those early preachers is when they saw a tear they wanted to go right out there and jerk that thing out of the ground and god says no don't do that don't do that lest while you jerked a tear out of the ground you would uproot the true wheat you want to know timepiece the tares have come to maturity it's where we're at saints the tares have come to maturity you know what that also means somebody speak it for me it means the wheat has also come to maturity we're no longer looking at green plants we're looking at people and you say brother paul you've been preaching harder and harder you've kind of been a little more critical brother paul that's right saints we're going to because the days of nonsense the days of all the immaturity all of that is now behind us and as the song says i can hear the combine let me just skip back so so we can move on you see this word my brother and sister is a supernatural vision it's empowering the bride this little look down on lady i got some friends that are just brutally outspoken not being disrespectful in a sense but just how they communicate they just can't believe paul why do you make your wife dress like she does and i'm getting a little blunt as i get older i'm sorry it's so she won't look like your wife okay can i put it real blunt will y'all forgive me for being real blunt 50 plus year old women 30 pounds overweight in spandex and flip flops and their daughter's t-shirt and they think they're attractive it's an anointing no one would go out in public now now forgive me i got i got just boiled and grilled and toasted and went up in flames over the fact that i said something about we're message believers and we fellowship around food and we're all fat i i got roasted over that i i didn't even remember ever saying that but i got roasted over that you call this all fat i'd uh okay i'm sorry i didn't mean it like that i didn't mean it like that but you see my brother and sister the spirit of the age what it's doing they don't see themselves according to the word they see themselves according tradition and their church has come to accept it i've told you about my friend larry and how their church has a break halfway through and he loves that break because he doesn't like sitting that long plus he needs to get outside and smoke a cigarette and visit with his pastor come on saints it's not what we're called to be we're not called to be and we start lowering the standards in this assembly we won't be long till we look like them only way you could ever have eternal life is because you always was amen see this little look down lady that christ calls his bride right prophecy is declared prophecy is coming to pass now let's look across this right here just my very last quote and then we'll come sister ruth if you just come that'll prompt me not to carry on amen so look at this now look what the prophet has said right here saints this is a quote i have quoted over and over again through the years maybe not so much lately but it is something that just strikes it rings resonates in my heart it is a permanent if i could say it my little ipad i study on it is a permanent locked in quote in my quote deal there i have just a handful of them this one is permanently locked in there because it means that much to me now look at this when a man once catches that vision right not theological not teaching not this or that but a real vision where he sees and can insert himself into the vision you know this is a whole other sermon but look at this saints you realize when john's talking about the vision when paul is talking the vision paul says look i was faithful to the heavenly vision oh king agrippa i'm just going to let you know right now whatever you think i have been faithful to this vision amen oh i hope i can say that at the end of my life when a man once catches that vision of the invisible god and know that he's always present right there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his action and in the time of prosperity and comfort the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the unseen yet what did god give israel in goshen amen a promise amen yet by promise and now how abraham not only did he see the unseen and the reason he believed it i like this and i apply this to my life saints i'm telling you this is a and i've got a lot of ouches if you guys was around paul a day in and day out of his life you would hear paul say ouch a lot but it is here my brother and sister why do i believe it why do you believe it the reason he believed it is because god said it amen and if we being dead in christ we are abraham's seed and if the spirit that was in christ dwells in us it does the same thing it takes every divine promise of god that's in his bible and calls it present tense and rests itself upon there amen go forward brothers where if you look out with your eyes and you see now that our nation is shaking and trembling this quote just fits our world war clouds are flying everywhere do you know that that our highest military leaders one of them spoke out a turn in a interview our nation which is said to be the strongest nation on earth is afraid this is what the man said we are afraid of a frontal attack from china you see where we're at no longer a nation that can stand and say we are the superpower what's it doing trembling that's it trembling shaking it down you know what it's doing for the bride yes letting her know there's only one place of refuge you're not going to be able to run and hide your bunkers no none of that will work every sign jesus said is happening amen oh let me go back i want to war clowns are flying everywhere every nation under distressed and perplexed of time every sign that jesus said would happen is happening there would be signs in the heavens above and in the earth below and great things would be taking place like flying saucer and mystic things taking place now look i think this is funny most of you would never be up at this time but in the middle of the night there's a guy on the radio sometimes you have to do whatever you got to do to stay awake when the ac down at 50 degrees don't keep you awake i hope brother sergey you don't drive a truck like this and brother vasily but i drive a tractor in the middle of the night like this there's not a lot of traffic out there and there's this guy on the radio and you talk about it just weirds me out because he's talking about oh we have these reports of these little men and one of them they landed they landed their ship there's a big oval in the parking lot of the walmart in las cruces new mexico and one of those men landed his ship and got out and asked the people who's your leader that keeps you awake for a while wow are these people weird or what but then the prophet of god said oh don't worry about them they're just investigating angels and if one of them landed in your front yard and said who is your leader would you be going uh i guess it's joe biden no sir if it's an investigating angel and you're the bride of christ you could be going well i'm here to tell you little man in the saucer jesus christ is my leader hallelujah well identified once and for eternity who my leader is amen i don't have to worry about what's happening in the white house what they did right or wrong my brother and sister because i'm not of this earth and neither are you hallelujah so look what's happening if you want to do that go in the middle of the night art bell you'll just hear the weirdest things you ever heard in your life guys talking about well now we mystically blah blah blah and we've done this and we did this and we bent these straws and i believe them unbelievable i believe them all kinds of mystic things but those mystics my brother and sister under the ministry of the apostle paul got converted to be real christians amen so all they need to do is hear the gospel i'm sorry i said i was just going to be done and i just can't help myself amen great things would be taking place like flying saucers mystic things taking place but he commanded his church hey hallelujah did anybody know his church amen lift up their heads in that day and to look up for the unseen christ will be appearing pretty soon but if we only walk by sight we would be children of darkness sure enough now but i'm so glad to know that there is a life that shines in every believer's heart until the eternal day when jesus christ shall come hallelujah saints look at your vision make sure satan is not clouding your vision well so caught up with children were so caught up with work and paying a mortgage and buying a nicer car and worrying about where we're going on vacations look i'm telling you we discuss those same things in our household amen we discuss things like oh well we want to buy this can't afford it we want to do this can't afford i want to go on vacation can't afford it we want to go here want to go there oh this is that you can't do this don't want to fly i don't know brother ivan sister nadia you flew i mean hopefully they didn't lock you up in the janitor's closet because you didn't qualify or something i don't know but look saints we're looking at a time it's not happening the way we thought it would they are closing down nations they are closing down economies and they are even in the place of california you can't even go in a grocery store in some of those more liberal cities now without showing your card reminds me how we've been trained all you costco members can't get in the door without the card can't pay for your food without the car and it said it'll come a time when you won't be able to buy or sell amen without the mark see how it's all training and some of you say but we love costco i do too their trail mix is absolutely the best trail mix on the face of the earth otherwise who needs 10 ketchups who needs to buy socks by 40 of them but you see what they're doing saints they're training and we're now seeing that beast rising up the three largest denominations on the face of the earth have joined together with the pope that we must be the ones that take control of the environment you see what that is they love the creation more than they love the creator it's all coming to pass saints now i want to know what you're going to do there is a thousand acre ranch that's in the middle of nevada not even the sheriff goes out there we could all sell everything we own go down there live in the middle of nowhere would that protect us but i'll tell you what catching god's vision being filled with his spirit the word living in us says that they walked through the fire and come out without even the smell of it amen they faced the lions they faced all of these things without death hebrews 11 12. amen read the scripture they've done all this what is it saints let's not get afraid let's get filled up let's get more of christ amen god bless you love you today amen sorry i spoke so long i was just a little faster lord help us or maybe if i didn't have such a big appetite amen let's just stand and sing a song or two before we go today or three or four or five amen hallelujah i hope you don't mind i'm just happy go to bed

know what you're going to make mistakes and that's well and good and i've already made a propitiation for you i've already come and paid that price and you yes pardon me for saying it this way you're

his victory sing this verse again because some of you are just not into reports i guess or maybe the devil gave you a negative report let me just tell you how report cards are when i was in school i had a teacher she said paul i need you to come sit down talk about your report card okay i sat down and says paul you've done everything there is to do wrong in my class you're tardy thirty sometimes you don't pay attention you don't do your schoolwork and right there in front of me took a red ink pen and in my final grade in my last year of school no not my senior year school my last year i put this great big f in the box and i said but you just told me a few days ago that i had a d minus minus minus she said let this change you because i know that there's more in you you'll be a success in life but you're going to have to focus i remember walking out that class that day and said i know where that teacher's cars are and i should just make all four of them tires go flat i should die should i should i should i [Music] and it struck me this same teacher just told me they thought i'd be a success in life i looked at that report card i hid it from my mother i told her i said mom i don't know i think i misplaced that day my mama never went to the teacher you know meet the teacher class thing but i just remember that teacher this is what this report card is but i believe you'll be a success now saints you'll walk out of here today you'll have a decision to make whose report you will believe satan just gave you an f well god said i see so much potential in you you're going to be a success you're going to make a rapture you're going to live for me so much so i'm declaring to the world that it will be me in your flesh not just a representation and not just a figurative not just some kind of uh words but literally me in your flesh do you ever see our lord fail neither will you see yourself fail amen because christ is in you well his report says i am here his reforms i am seen his report says i am free his report says victory [Music] for his report says i am healed and his report says i am sealed and his report says i am free his report says i have victory hallelujah i feel like running the isle of this church hallelujah saints god bless you amen i pray lord just deal with your heart still kindly if you have any other vision than the vision of what we have just shared with you from the words of a prophet today i want you to put that vision away put it where it belongs and see this vision that god had all the way from before a foundation of this world he said i've made the way i'm your provider i'm your protector i'm your refuge i'm everything you know some people get kinda well to use this individual's words creeped out paul you say jesus christ is our lover and that just creeps me out well i'm sorry my brother and sister it doesn't creep me out it makes me excited i can't wait to throw my arms around him i can't wait to just just pull myself up so close to him knowing this is the one that's been with me even in me all of my life everywhere i went oh my i feel like preaching part two god bless you saints hallelujah hallelujah you're dismissed
