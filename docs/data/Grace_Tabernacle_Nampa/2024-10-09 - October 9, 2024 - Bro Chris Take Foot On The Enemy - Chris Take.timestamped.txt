[35:15] please stand with me I want to read from
[35:17] James chapter
[35:19] 1 amen our hearts are with the dean
[35:21] Hearts
[35:22] tonight we know that uh this is the
[35:26] greatest moment in brother Bob's life
[35:30] but uh also the hardest for his
[35:32] family James 1:
[35:38] 18 while you're turning there I want to
[35:42] read from 1 Corinthians 13
[35:45] verse1 says when I was a child I spake
[35:48] as a child I understood as a child I
[35:51] thought as a child but when I became a
[35:52] man I put away childish things James 1:8
[36:02] of his own will he begot he us with the
[36:05] word of truth that we should be a kind
[36:08] of first fruits of his creatures so
[36:10] James pulling directly from the ministry
[36:13] of
[36:13] Jesus he understands that by the New
[36:16] Birth the new
[36:18] birth of his own will the new birth to
[36:22] us through the word of
[36:24] truth because it was with the word of
[36:27] truth that we receive the new birth and
[36:29] then by the fuit fruits of that we
[36:32] become a kind of first fruits of his
[36:35] creatures so we are New Creation in
[36:38] Christ Jesus to look and act like Christ
[36:41] himself verse 19 wherefore my beloved
[36:44] Brethren let every man be swift to hear
[36:47] slow to speak and slow to
[36:50] wrath Lord help us for the wrath of man
[36:54] worketh not the righteousness of God
[36:58] you know one of the biggest things that
[37:00] disappears with anger is
[37:02] patience so right here let us not let it
[37:05] be swift to hear slow to speak slow to
[37:07] wrath when we get in a hurry that's
[37:10] where we deal with anger the most
[37:13] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[37:16] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[37:18] with meekness the engrafted word which
[37:20] is able to save your
[37:23] souls but be you doers of the word and
[37:26] not hearers only deceiving your own
[37:28] selves for if any be a hearer of the
[37:31] word and not a doer he is like unto a
[37:33] man beholding his natural face in a
[37:36] glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth
[37:39] his way and straightway
[37:43] forgetthe into the perfect law of
[37:46] Liberty and continueth therein he being
[37:48] not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the
[37:50] work this man shall be blessed in his
[37:53] deed If any man among you seem to be
[37:55] religious and bridleth not his tongue
[37:58] but deceiveth his own heart this man's
[38:00] religion is vain so don't just talk it
[38:03] walk it pure religion and undefiled
[38:06] before God and the father is this to
[38:09] visit the fatherless and widows in their
[38:11] Affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[38:14] from the world may the Lord bless the
[38:16] reading of his word you can be seated
[38:17] tonight I my my subject this evening is
[38:22] or excuse me my title this evening is um
[38:25] foot on the enemy
[38:27] and my subtitle is avoiding the Trap of
[38:29] a self-centered
[38:31] life James here is referring to looking
[38:35] in a glass and and this is where we draw
[38:37] from from text that of the uh the
[38:41] subject on looking in the mirror of
[38:43] God's word and I and I and I have uh I
[38:46] have come to find out that the hardest
[38:49] part in the journey as a Christian is
[38:52] seeing yourself truly in the mirror of
[38:56] God's word and and seeing your
[38:58] discrepancies coming face to face with
[39:01] your inadequacies coming face to face
[39:03] with the realization that you are not
[39:05] all you thought you were and that's uh a
[39:09] place of
[39:11] humbleness humility
[39:14] Brokenness it's it's not
[39:16] easy and brother bham says in perfect
[39:20] strength by Perfect
[39:22] weakness he says I've often said the
[39:24] greatest enemy I got is William brandham
[39:26] he's the one that that gets in God's way
[39:29] he's the one that gets lazy he's the one
[39:33] that gets to a place sometimes where he
[39:35] thinks he can do something about it and
[39:37] when he does that shoves God right out
[39:41] of the picture but when I can get rid of
[39:44] that guy when I can get to a place that
[39:47] he is out of the way then God can come
[39:49] over and do things that William brandham
[39:51] knows nothing about that's when God can
[39:54] use you that's when he can use any of
[39:57] you he can use anybody when we get out
[40:00] of the way but as long as we get
[40:02] ourselves in the way then we
[40:05] cannot
[40:08] so there's there's there's a couple of
[40:10] different ways we we we have
[40:13] self-centered is is is in our subject
[40:16] and what does it mean to be
[40:17] self-centered well the natural
[40:19] definition is a focus on one's own needs
[40:22] desires and interests above those of
[40:25] others involves prioritizing personal
[40:27] goals Comforts and opinions without
[40:30] regard for how one's actions affect
[40:32] others a self-c center person tends to
[40:35] view situations primarily from their own
[40:37] perspective we have we because we are a
[40:42] self we all are self we all are
[40:46] humans um do not Pitchfork this
[40:49] definition to anybody else this is us
[40:50] every single day of our life I was
[40:53] listening to questions and answers and
[40:54] brother benham's he's preaching along
[40:56] and he says he says you backslide every
[40:59] day he says that's why Paul said I Die
[41:02] daily so in order for it us to lead a
[41:06] successful life then as a Christian
[41:08] every day we must commit ourselves back
[41:10] to God we must surrender ourselves back
[41:12] to God we must we must lay oursel down
[41:15] at his feet and and and every day we
[41:18] must remember now you can you can
[41:20] reflect on your personal mistakes
[41:22] without it being a hindrance to your
[41:24] self-esteem
[41:27] that is the trick the trick is that is
[41:30] where we need God the most because lots
[41:33] of people have an understanding of their
[41:35] mistakes perhaps and in doing so become
[41:39] become low in self-confidence and have a
[41:42] low self-esteem they won't look you in
[41:43] the eye they they don't have any courage
[41:46] to do anything in life they just feel
[41:48] like they're miserable wretches but the
[41:51] problem with that is that you they saw a
[41:54] discrepancy in themselves and instead of
[41:57] realizing that that's an attribute and
[41:59] that is not them that is an attribute of
[42:01] them that is that is a characteristic of
[42:03] the of themselves but that is not
[42:06] something that is permanent nobody has
[42:08] to stay bad nobody has to stay bad we
[42:11] have the blood of Jesus Christ to fix
[42:12] that so there there's two ways you can
[42:15] come face to face with yourself and and
[42:18] if you and if you receive it in such a
[42:20] way where where you you say well I'm
[42:22] just no good you're actually you're
[42:25] actually not accepting though you though
[42:28] you are by by appearance accepting this
[42:31] m this discrepancy in your character
[42:33] this flaw in your character though you
[42:35] are accepting it you're actually
[42:37] accepting it through a selfish motive in
[42:39] that you now you take that discrepancy
[42:42] and you say see I knew I was worth
[42:44] nothing and now you want somebody to
[42:46] come along and tell you no you are
[42:48] amazing you are worth everything you are
[42:50] all of this instead of coming instead of
[42:52] coming to a place where you see it and
[42:54] you say God help me fix that so see
[42:57] there's two ways you can receive it and
[42:59] I've seen this in my own self now I'm
[43:02] just going to preach at myself tonight
[43:03] because this is this is a slippery slope
[43:06] to begin to point fingers I I think I
[43:09] think tonight the the subject that we're
[43:10] speaking on on I I would ask that you
[43:12] don't wound the effect uh this
[43:14] Revelation can have on your life by
[43:16] casting it onto someone else that's the
[43:19] first thing we can do when we begin to
[43:20] talk about self-centeredness and
[43:22] selfishness we can think we think of
[43:24] somebody but if you're thinking of
[43:26] somebody somebody's think thinking about
[43:29] you we all have this this this this
[43:32] thing and so so I'm going to preach that
[43:33] myself tonight so I have done this where
[43:35] I have I have someone has come to me and
[43:37] said you know brother Chris you are
[43:39] doing this and we don't appreciate it or
[43:42] it's not correct now it is my job to
[43:45] take it to the Lord and say Lord is this
[43:47] something I need to change because as a
[43:49] minister you know you're public facing
[43:51] people won't always agree with what you
[43:52] have to say but as long as you know you
[43:55] said what God put in his word then
[43:57] that's for something for them and that's
[43:59] not something you need to go change but
[44:01] if if it's something that is a
[44:02] discrepancy in your character it is your
[44:04] obligation to God and to the public and
[44:07] to your brothers and sisters to take
[44:09] that to the throne of grace and say God
[44:11] change me but it if you take it and then
[44:14] and then it causes self low self-esteem
[44:16] where you get you get you put yourself
[44:18] down and I'm I'll just say this one more
[44:20] time cuz I'm trying to get it out
[44:23] correctly instead of saying I need to
[44:25] fix this you just hold on to it you say
[44:27] well this is who I am nobody likes me
[44:29] but that's not the way we should do it
[44:31] so self-centeredness is often lacking it
[44:34] empathy humility or consideration for
[44:37] the feelings and needs of others you
[44:39] know the world that we live in today
[44:41] everybody's telling you you know you
[44:42] need a day
[44:45] off you need to um you know take a hot
[44:48] bath with epsom salt you need to you
[44:50] need to go to the spa you need you need
[44:52] to treat yourself you need to take care
[44:53] of yourself when actually the the the
[44:56] greatest antidote
[44:59] to uh to depression is living for other
[45:03] people says if you're doing if you're if
[45:05] you're if he said if you're if you're
[45:07] always that one that you know you want
[45:08] your way and all these things he says do
[45:10] the direct opposite start to give out to
[45:13] others so we see that the Rich Young
[45:15] Ruler in the scriptures this was the
[45:17] biggest thing he struggled with because
[45:18] if he was not self-centered he would
[45:20] have had no issues giving everything he
[45:22] had away but he was he thought he was
[45:25] important because of the money that he
[45:26] had so he was identified by the the
[45:29] quantity of what he held on he was he he
[45:32] had he had wrapped his identity into an
[45:34] object money is an object he had wrapped
[45:37] himself into into into this thing and so
[45:40] that can be applied to many things in
[45:41] our life even discrepancies we can wrap
[45:44] up our our identity into something uh
[45:47] that is that is a flaw in our character
[45:49] we can become identified by that thing
[45:52] and if we're not careful when that thing
[45:54] becomes challenged and we and and and we
[45:56] realize it's it's somebody says this is
[45:58] wrong because we have identified oursel
[46:01] with it for so long we will look to that
[46:03] person and say you have something
[46:05] against
[46:06] me because God uses one another uses
[46:10] each of us to show us and you know it's
[46:12] the old old adage that says the thing
[46:14] that bothers you most in somebody else
[46:16] is probably the main problem you
[46:18] have so self-centered individuals may
[46:21] have a difficulty considering how their
[46:23] actions affect those around them and may
[46:25] seek constant atten attention or
[46:27] validation now I pulled this these
[46:30] definitions kind of from online and and
[46:32] this really this really struck a chord
[46:33] for me in my studying it says may seek
[46:36] constant attention or validation you
[46:38] know you would think it that you
[46:40] wouldn't think it a a bad thing to look
[46:42] to someone and say you know did I do
[46:45] okay but yet that is that is that is a a
[46:49] characteristic of being self-centered
[46:51] now not in the not in the way of saying
[46:53] like to my wife like honey in that
[46:55] conversation did I handle myself
[46:56] correctly that's different right you're
[46:58] now you're you're looking for feedback
[46:59] you go to your manager you say hey how
[47:01] did I handle that that that that meeting
[47:03] we had or you go to your your your
[47:05] friend your buddy and say hey you know
[47:06] what when I talked to that person and
[47:08] you were there you know did I how did I
[47:10] handle that right that's that's getting
[47:11] cultivating feedback saying Hey did I
[47:13] did I do it right did I have a did I was
[47:15] I respectful but but instead of but
[47:17] that's not self validation that's
[47:18] checking to see hey am I handling myself
[47:20] correctly we need friends around us to
[47:22] to to do that for us but this validation
[47:24] here is is looking saying you know am I
[47:27] cool enough did I did I did I you know
[47:30] it's it's it comes from a place of
[47:32] they're unsure of themselves they're
[47:33] they're they're not and
[47:37] and it really is it really is a
[47:41] paradox how characteristics of
[47:45] selfishness some of them R hide
[47:49] themselves in the fact that that we just
[47:52] need to be nicer to each
[47:54] other but that's not not the problem the
[47:58] problem is we are
[48:01] selfish we we should be able to stand
[48:04] knowing hey God put me here should be
[48:07] able to stand and and and and and have a
[48:10] conversation and and witness and do your
[48:14] job and and take care of your family and
[48:17] and come to church because you have a
[48:19] desire to please God if if we're going
[48:22] to church to please other
[48:25] people even in trying to please other
[48:27] people we can be selfish because because
[48:30] what we're trying to do is make
[48:33] ourselves look
[48:34] better you say well going to church is a
[48:36] good thing encouraging our brother is a
[48:38] good thing but what is your motive and
[48:40] objective the objective is to encourage
[48:41] your brother all right we can all agree
[48:43] that's a good thing but what is the
[48:45] motive behind it why are you wanting to
[48:48] encourage encourage your brother is it
[48:49] because you want him to say you
[48:51] encouraged
[48:52] me why do you want to why do you want to
[48:55] you know sorry Titus you walked up why
[48:57] do you want to play the violin is it to
[48:59] just simply Express the gift to God or
[49:01] do you want someone to see you playing
[49:02] the violin why do you clean the
[49:04] church because you want someone to know
[49:08] hey they clean the church see objective
[49:11] many many many times we have the
[49:13] objective correct and because we have
[49:15] the objective correct we think the
[49:17] motive is correct by
[49:19] proxy but it's not you can have the
[49:21] right objective and the wrong motive you
[49:23] can have the right motive and the wrong
[49:24] objective
[49:28] now on the spiritual side of that's kind
[49:30] of the natural thing and and now we're
[49:32] all feeling a little bit bad right
[49:34] because we're thinking about being
[49:35] selfish but on the spiritual side you
[49:37] know just just to thinking about this um
[49:41] this is kind of pulled from a couple of
[49:42] different sermons brother Brandon
[49:43] preaches perfect strength by perfect
[49:45] perfect weakness and the greatest battle
[49:46] ever fought you know relying on your own
[49:51] strength relying on your own now we're
[49:53] talking spiritually relying on your own
[49:55] strength your own intellect
[49:57] your own achievements rather than
[49:59] surrendering to God you are a selfish
[50:03] disciple you say God I got this I'm
[50:06] going to handle this not even realizing
[50:08] you are displaying the attributes of the
[50:10] flesh under the cloak of spiritualism
[50:14] you are displaying the the the the the
[50:17] characteristics of of what you want
[50:20] rather than what God wants God doesn't
[50:22] want let me put it like this God doesn't
[50:24] want what you have to offer
[50:27] if you what you have to offer is other
[50:29] than
[50:30] yourself he wants you to lay yourself at
[50:33] the altar he wants to surrender your
[50:35] body he doesn't want your abilities he
[50:37] doesn't he doesn't want what you
[50:40] have he doesn't want he doesn't want
[50:42] what you think you can do he wants you
[50:46] you see we we can do things we all have
[50:48] talents right and we talk about talents
[50:49] oh use your talent for God use your
[50:51] talent for God and if we're not careful
[50:53] we use our talent for God but we won't
[50:56] give him
[50:57] ourself and when you do that you got the
[51:00] cart before the horse and you might
[51:02] sound good you might you know people
[51:04] might enjoy
[51:06] it you might you might you might be a
[51:08] good speaker people might people might
[51:10] enjoy it but it did you give God
[51:14] yourself the the three men in the
[51:15] scriptures one was given five talents
[51:17] one was given two talents one was given
[51:19] one Talent they all knew knew the heart
[51:22] of the master they all knew the heart of
[51:24] the man the king because the one had one
[51:27] Talent said I knew that you you you you
[51:29] reap where you didn't plant and he says
[51:32] well you should have just put it in the
[51:33] bank so I could gain in interest on it
[51:36] so but instead he buried it but the the
[51:38] five and the two all he did was give
[51:39] them the talents and they surrendered
[51:43] themselves to his will by going out and
[51:46] saying he would want us he would want us
[51:49] to do to to double this he would want us
[51:51] to to invest this to use this for
[51:54] something good so they they Sur rendered
[51:57] themselves maybe they wanted to take the
[51:58] five talents and go spend it on
[52:00] something but because they were given
[52:02] five God knew their
[52:04] heart so because he knew their heart he
[52:06] knew in in their heart was the right
[52:08] desire and so they took those talents
[52:10] and they surrendered them to the market
[52:13] they surrendered them to the to to
[52:16] to well to the
[52:19] market and in doing so they took a risk
[52:23] they took a calculated risk that this is
[52:26] going to
[52:27] return this is going to return on my
[52:29] investment because they they knew that
[52:32] the master would want them to give the
[52:34] talents up give it up and they did they
[52:37] said we spent the five and we got five
[52:39] more in return I spent the two and I got
[52:41] two more in return they took a risk
[52:43] giving it
[52:46] away right they took a
[52:51] risk they didn't go and use it for
[52:54] themselves everything they did with the
[52:56] Talent was for the master except for the
[52:58] guy who had W he acted selfishly cuz he
[53:02] said you he pointed his finger at the
[53:06] man who gave him the talent and said you
[53:08] you
[53:09] know you reap or you didn't plant so in
[53:14] his fear in his selfishness he just
[53:16] buried it instead of going out and doing
[53:18] something with what God had given
[53:24] him selfishness spiritually presents a
[53:27] barrier to spiritual growth because it
[53:30] pre prevents full dependence on God's
[53:34] power and it it limits our ability
[53:37] selfishness limits our ability to serve
[53:40] others selflessly you say we we want to
[53:43] do more for the kingdom of God we want
[53:45] to we want to we want
[53:47] to I think I hope we all have that
[53:50] desire to do more for God and the the
[53:54] first the best thing you can do for God
[53:56] is surrender yourself because as soon as
[53:58] you do suddenly doors
[54:01] open you you you can't make something
[54:05] happen you can't make it happen in the
[54:07] kingdom of God we're we're not a we're
[54:09] not a denomination it won't work if
[54:12] you're a child of God it won't work
[54:13] remember remember that that thing from
[54:15] um that that brother I always forget his
[54:17] name but brother Sergey has it over his
[54:19] mantle but it's the it's this it's this
[54:22] thing it's the um what's it called
[54:24] brother
[54:25] sery a higher calling right it's the
[54:28] desire say I want to go make something
[54:30] of myself I want to go have success I
[54:32] want to go I I I but as it says in the
[54:36] quote God won't let you so I do not
[54:41] believe me and my wife we're talking
[54:42] about
[54:44] this you can be
[54:47] poor financially you can be poor and
[54:50] have the same attitude the Rich Young
[54:52] Ruler
[54:53] had because his Focus was the money I
[54:57] need the money you can be poor and
[55:00] always think I need more money I need
[55:02] more money if I had more money if I had
[55:04] more money I don't believe God's
[55:08] children whether poor or Rich should be
[55:10] in that condition I think believers who
[55:14] are in a poor position because God put
[55:16] them there to hold to hold a testimony
[55:20] they're going to have the they're going
[55:21] to take care of themselves they're going
[55:23] to take care of what they own they're
[55:24] going to have the attitude of a good
[55:26] Steward and they're going to give off
[55:29] the impression that they're
[55:33] rich they're not going to closeth
[55:35] themselves in garments of the poor and
[55:37] and sackcloth and Ashes remember Jesus
[55:39] talks about the Pharisees who would who
[55:41] would fast and they would change the way
[55:43] change their demeanor and change their
[55:45] clothes so everybody knew they were
[55:48] fasting the only one who needs to know
[55:51] your poor is God himself
[55:56] the only no one who needs to know your
[55:58] rich is God himself now there are
[55:59] certain things that just they attributes
[56:02] and let me say it this way if you live
[56:05] that way God will show what you're
[56:07] capable of to those who need
[56:10] it God will show forth what you can do
[56:13] for the kingdom of God if you will lay
[56:15] those things on his on his altar but we
[56:18] shouldn't go around saying well you know
[56:19] what you know I just you know I'm just
[56:21] you know can't pay my bills
[56:24] and wowy woo and feel bad for yourself
[56:27] and cast off this demeanor that you you
[56:30] know you go down to
[56:32] the I think you understand what I'm
[56:34] saying I hope so because you're scowling
[56:36] at
[56:39] me the world has a secular world I spent
[56:43] some time in my career life a few years
[56:47] in the uh in the um research of of
[56:50] self-help of self self- embedment uh
[56:53] that's the right word and uh the the
[56:55] company I was working for the the the
[56:57] boss the CEO there he he really pushed
[57:00] that and so he had books and all this
[57:01] stuff and and I went through it and I
[57:03] found out it's it's more headache uh
[57:05] than help and um because I realized that
[57:08] as Christians the way we get better is
[57:10] so so let me say this so the world they
[57:12] have this this concept 1% better every
[57:15] day 1% better every day so what's one
[57:17] little step you can make every day to be
[57:19] a better
[57:20] person and and I and I I and I looked at
[57:23] that and after some time God dealing
[57:25] with my heart I realized as a Believer
[57:27] 1% better every day is 1% more
[57:31] surrendered to Christ every morning you
[57:34] get up you say God what is the thing I
[57:36] can surrender to you
[57:37] today every day you have to surrender
[57:40] yourself will for one thing your self
[57:42] will you have to surrender but a
[57:44] Christian who is pursuing surrender
[57:47] every day of their life finds themselves
[57:50] further down the
[57:52] journey finds themselves closer to
[57:55] Christ finds themselves closer to the
[57:57] goals you know as you climb a mountain
[57:59] because we're climbing a mountain it's
[58:01] called a pyramid it's called the statue
[58:03] of a perfect man as you climb the
[58:05] mountain The View gets better and
[58:08] better sometimes there's hikes you know
[58:10] that are climbs that'll start off in the
[58:12] trees my wife and I uh um we we we went
[58:16] up and we were hiking there's a peak and
[58:18] Flagstaff um I think it Peaks out at 12
[58:21] or 14,000 ft um and so we said hey let's
[58:24] let's do it and um we got up the Tre a
[58:27] little ways and and and while it it
[58:29] Peaks out really high and and for a long
[58:32] time up there it's just rock and and
[58:34] gravel and everything for the first
[58:37] several miles you're in the trees and
[58:39] you can't see
[58:40] anything so you're in your journey as a
[58:42] Christian and you're just like I don't
[58:43] know what's going on you know it's just
[58:45] the same old trees I'm just walking
[58:48] along you know and it's the same old
[58:49] trees and and if we're not careful we
[58:51] get discouraged and we say this is too
[58:53] hard and we keep stopping for a break
[58:55] and we stop for a break and we stop for
[58:57] a break but as you know those of you who
[59:00] hike is when you stop for a break what
[59:02] keeps
[59:04] going
[59:05] time and the longer you spend break
[59:08] taking a break the less light you have
[59:11] for your
[59:12] journey so those who take breaks often
[59:15] but they still have the desire to finish
[59:17] finish in the
[59:18] dark and then did you bring a headlamp
[59:22] nope right so these things happen but so
[59:26] that's the same way the Christian
[59:27] Journey you got to keep on walking
[59:28] brother says you can only go forward or
[59:31] backwards you can't there's no pause and
[59:34] that's because time doesn't stop for
[59:36] anybody time does not stop for anybody
[59:38] so the longer you sit in a on a as a
[59:42] bump on a log along the Christian
[59:44] Journey the longer you sit there the
[59:46] more time goes by and guess what the
[59:48] more complicated things in your life get
[59:51] if you struggle with things in your life
[59:53] and you sit down with instead of
[59:54] continuing on those those struggles get
[59:57] harder and harder to shake it's kind of
[59:59] like when you're tired you know your
[1:00:01] body hurts your muscles are sore the
[1:00:03] worst thing you can do if you're doing
[1:00:05] something strenuous is sit down for too
[1:00:07] long because your your muscles they say
[1:00:10] okay it's time to break and they they
[1:00:14] tense up or they or they just say hey
[1:00:16] well let's chill and then all of a
[1:00:18] sudden their legs don't work like they
[1:00:19] did you know before so in a Christian
[1:00:22] Journey the same thing happens you sit
[1:00:24] down for too long your faith gets weak
[1:00:26] and when your faith gets weak your
[1:00:28] relationship with God struggles and it's
[1:00:31] all because we were too
[1:00:32] self-centered we said I need a break God
[1:00:36] didn't say you need a break if God says
[1:00:39] you need a break guess what you'll come
[1:00:41] to a downhill on the
[1:00:44] trail in Joshua chapter 10 we're going
[1:00:47] to read here where I got my title and um
[1:00:50] Joshua chapter 10 ver14 definitely is
[1:00:52] not a conventional way to approach this
[1:00:55] subject but NE nevertheless the point
[1:00:57] still stands John Joshua
[1:01:01] 10:14 and there was no day like that
[1:01:03] before it or after it that the Lord
[1:01:05] hearkened unto the voice of a man for
[1:01:07] the Lord fought for Israel and Joshua
[1:01:09] returned and all Israel with him unto
[1:01:11] the camp to gilgal but these five Kings
[1:01:14] fled and hid themselves in a cave at
[1:01:16] maada and it was told Joshua saying the
[1:01:19] five kings are found hid in a cave at Ma
[1:01:22] and Joshua said roll great Stones upon
[1:01:24] the mouth of the cave and and set Men by
[1:01:26] it for to keep them and stay you not but
[1:01:29] pursue after your enemies and smite the
[1:01:31] hindmost of them suffer them not to
[1:01:32] enter into their cities for the Lord
[1:01:34] your God hath delivered them into your
[1:01:36] hand now this is the
[1:01:38] battle as we'll read where Jerusalem was
[1:01:41] delivered unto the
[1:01:43] Israelites who was one of these Kings as
[1:01:45] the king of Jerusalem for God hath
[1:01:47] delivered them into your hand and it
[1:01:49] came to pass when Joshua and the
[1:01:50] children of Israel had made an end of
[1:01:51] slaying them with a very great Slaughter
[1:01:54] till they were consumed that the the
[1:01:56] rest which remained of them entered into
[1:01:57] fenced cities and all the people
[1:02:00] returned to the camp to Joshua and M in
[1:02:03] peace none moved his tongue against any
[1:02:05] of the children of Israel then said
[1:02:07] Joshua open the mouth of the cape and
[1:02:10] bring out those five Kings unto me out
[1:02:12] of the cave and they did so and brought
[1:02:14] forth those five Kings unto him out of
[1:02:16] the Cave the king of Jerusalem the king
[1:02:18] of Hebron the king of jarmuth the king
[1:02:20] of Lish and the king of Elon it came to
[1:02:24] pass when they brought out the those
[1:02:26] kings unto Joshua that Joshua called for
[1:02:28] all the men of Israel and said unto the
[1:02:30] captains of the men of War which went
[1:02:31] with him come near put your feet upon
[1:02:34] the necks of these Kings and they came
[1:02:36] near and put their feet upon the necks
[1:02:37] of them and Joshua said unto them fear
[1:02:40] not nor be dismayed be strong and of
[1:02:42] good courage for thus shall the Lord do
[1:02:44] all do to all your enemies against whom
[1:02:46] you fight and afterward Joshua smote
[1:02:48] them and slew them and hang them on five
[1:02:51] trees and they were hanged upon the
[1:02:53] trees until the evening it came to pass
[1:02:55] that the the time of the going down of
[1:02:56] the Sun that Joshua commanded and they
[1:02:58] took them down off the trees and cast
[1:03:01] them into the cave wherein they had been
[1:03:03] hid and laid great stones in the Cave's
[1:03:05] mouth which remain until this very
[1:03:09] day now interesting part here about
[1:03:12] these Kings these Kings and and and we
[1:03:14] have you we have heard this if we've
[1:03:16] been in any any number of meetings or
[1:03:18] any number of services in our life we've
[1:03:20] heard this subject brought up about
[1:03:22] putting our foot on the neck of the
[1:03:24] enemy and that enemy can be cancer the
[1:03:26] enemy can be all these different things
[1:03:27] and brother bam lists the greatest enemy
[1:03:29] he he talks about the greatest enemy of
[1:03:31] the Gospel is is doubt he says the
[1:03:34] greatest enemy excuse me he says the
[1:03:35] greatest enemy of faith is doubt and he
[1:03:38] says he says uh he also gives a
[1:03:40] definition of the greatest enemy of the
[1:03:41] Gospel but he said when it comes to the
[1:03:43] greatest enemy of ourselves it is
[1:03:46] ourselves for the Christian the greatest
[1:03:48] enemy of the Christian is ourselves so
[1:03:50] now we have the children of Israel who
[1:03:52] are on I'll try to slow down here on the
[1:03:54] other side of the River Jordan fighting
[1:03:57] for their rights of the promised land
[1:03:59] they are under the leadership of Joshua
[1:04:00] who is a type of the Holy Spirit now as
[1:04:03] the children of Israel were fighting
[1:04:05] they fought Jericho great battles they
[1:04:07] they had the situation with aan and they
[1:04:09] saw how God deals with with trouble in
[1:04:11] the church and and uh they went on to
[1:04:14] fight more and more battles and in this
[1:04:17] story brother Bram talks about this and
[1:04:19] he says it's the only time God ever paid
[1:04:21] attention and listened to a man and that
[1:04:24] was when Joshua said Sun and Moon MO
[1:04:26] stand still I've heard it said I don't
[1:04:29] know if it's true that there's a day or
[1:04:31] two missing and that in in the in the in
[1:04:34] the calculation of time but nevertheless
[1:04:36] that's for a different time
[1:04:40] so they have this great battle
[1:04:43] now we all understand leadership to a
[1:04:46] point uh as men with with families we
[1:04:50] understand leadership from another
[1:04:51] perspective than perhaps a young man who
[1:04:54] is a son and he's living at home
[1:04:56] men especially understand leadership
[1:04:58] because we are called to be leaders once
[1:05:01] you're born you grow up if you have a
[1:05:03] good father he will teach you how to be
[1:05:04] a leader because you are a man and that
[1:05:06] is a characteristic that you should hold
[1:05:09] so we have five Kings now these five
[1:05:12] Kings decided hey we're going to attack
[1:05:16] Joshua and the reason that they attacked
[1:05:18] is because they found out that the
[1:05:20] gibian made a uh pact with Israel and
[1:05:25] through the through a you know the Shady
[1:05:27] business deal and the the five Kings
[1:05:30] said hey let's go and take gibian
[1:05:32] because they turned their back on the
[1:05:33] rest of us and uh
[1:05:35] because uh G Israel gave made a pact
[1:05:39] with gibian Israel said we're going to
[1:05:40] go defend gibian gibian also called for
[1:05:43] the help and they said hey we'll come
[1:05:44] because we gave you our
[1:05:46] promise and so they have this great
[1:05:49] battle and now these five Kings they you
[1:05:53] know we've heard them
[1:05:56] labeled in it labeled different things
[1:05:59] and those are all good there scripture
[1:06:01] has compound meaning but there's there's
[1:06:03] there's a part there's a enemy in this
[1:06:06] story that is hidden it's not it's not
[1:06:09] mentioned in name it's mentioned in deed
[1:06:12] and we read in James basically that you
[1:06:15] know by your fruits you are known he
[1:06:18] says if you hear and you do you're child
[1:06:20] of God James is basically preaching the
[1:06:22] same sermon Jesus preached in the book
[1:06:24] in the gospels talking about those that
[1:06:25] hear my word and do them they are part
[1:06:27] of me and James says you know it's
[1:06:29] important that I know I'm going to jump
[1:06:32] back so I don't misquote it here he says
[1:06:34] if any if hearer of the word and not a
[1:06:36] doer he is like unto a man beholding his
[1:06:38] natural face in the glass and when he
[1:06:39] behold himself and goeth away he forgets
[1:06:42] what he looks
[1:06:43] like so here in this scripture we see
[1:06:47] another enemy that is hidden hidden and
[1:06:50] it is it is the the enemy of self
[1:06:53] centeredness
[1:06:55] here here you have five
[1:06:57] Kings they made a pack together they
[1:07:00] said hey we're going to attack now they
[1:07:02] they are they are they the final
[1:07:04] leadership for their Kingdom you know
[1:07:06] leadership goes up in stages right if
[1:07:09] it's in a family you know there's a
[1:07:11] situation the the the the children you
[1:07:13] know they look to Mom mom looks to Dad
[1:07:16] dad looks to God right there just this
[1:07:18] and to the then the pastor then they got
[1:07:20] the deacons to the pastor so on and so
[1:07:22] forth so leadership moves up until it
[1:07:24] ends with god well leadership that moved
[1:07:26] up in each of these kingdoms there was
[1:07:27] captains there was generals there was
[1:07:29] all of these things but where it ended
[1:07:30] was with the Kings he they are the
[1:07:32] ultimate leader so in other words they
[1:07:34] are the ones who much must pay the
[1:07:36] biggest
[1:07:38] sacrifice for their
[1:07:41] decisions but instead of instead of
[1:07:44] laying hold of the decision that they
[1:07:45] took and the defeat that they were
[1:07:47] experiencing all five of them left their
[1:07:50] army left their duties and tried to save
[1:07:54] themselves and doing so were completely
[1:07:56] cornered long before Israel defeated the
[1:07:59] rest of the army armies they knew where
[1:08:01] these five Kings were hiding so they
[1:08:03] abandoned their post of Duty and in a in
[1:08:05] an act of selfishness they ran to the
[1:08:08] caves and hid themselves now we're not
[1:08:10] here to preach about the Kings because
[1:08:11] those kings are those kings and they
[1:08:13] answered for their sins and they're not
[1:08:14] part of the part of the plan of God as
[1:08:17] far as living on the other side but me
[1:08:19] and you are and the children of Israel
[1:08:21] were God's people so Joshua calls them
[1:08:24] and says put your foot foot on their on
[1:08:26] their necks and this is what you'll do
[1:08:28] to all of your enemies against whom you
[1:08:33] fight all your enemies against whom you
[1:08:38] fight little did they know that the
[1:08:40] number one enemy in their this new
[1:08:44] promised land was they
[1:08:47] themselves Joshua gives each of them
[1:08:50] they fight they finish fighting Joshua
[1:08:52] gives each of them their portion he
[1:08:54] assigns to them some of them had some
[1:08:56] more fighting to do Joshua goes on to
[1:08:59] glory and we have the Book of Judges and
[1:09:03] now these are the children of Israel and
[1:09:04] how does the Book of Judges open Daniel
[1:09:08] excuse me Daniel Dan commits
[1:09:13] idolatry the greatest enemy in the Book
[1:09:16] of Judges was not those infidels who
[1:09:20] surrounded them it was themselves
[1:09:25] through the Book of Judges you will
[1:09:27] watch the children of Israel
[1:09:29] simultaneously commit
[1:09:32] self-destruction yet they were given a
[1:09:34] promise by Joshua put your foot on the
[1:09:36] neck of the enemy and I fear that we in
[1:09:39] the church will only look to those
[1:09:41] outside enemies and say I put my foot on
[1:09:44] the neck of cancer I put my foot on the
[1:09:46] neck of pornography I put my foot on the
[1:09:48] neck of of lust I put my foot on the
[1:09:50] neck of whatever it might be bad books
[1:09:52] or bad movies I I put my foot on the
[1:09:54] neck of the
[1:09:56] enemy but the reason you do those things
[1:09:59] is because yourself has not been
[1:10:01] conquered it is it is an attribute of a
[1:10:05] self centered life sin in your life is
[1:10:09] an attribute of a self centered life you
[1:10:12] say how can you make such a statement
[1:10:14] because if it wasn't you would be
[1:10:16] surrendered to God he says brother B
[1:10:20] says the number one thing you have to
[1:10:21] surrender is your
[1:10:23] self-will that's it he says God can't do
[1:10:26] anything with you until you surrender
[1:10:28] your self
[1:10:29] will God in his grace and his Mercy has
[1:10:32] ministers and has the Bible and all
[1:10:34] these things to encourage you and direct
[1:10:36] you and give you feedback and give you
[1:10:39] Direction but you will make no Headway
[1:10:41] in your life until you surrender
[1:10:44] yourself so sin though you say oh you be
[1:10:47] crestf fallen when you make a mistake
[1:10:49] and you look down on yourself and you
[1:10:51] say oh I'm such a terrible person
[1:10:53] instead say God let me surrender this to
[1:10:56] you Lord what about myself is what what
[1:10:59] about me is so selfish how what am I
[1:11:02] holding on
[1:11:03] to sometimes sin is an attribute of a
[1:11:06] hurt in your life you did not
[1:11:10] forgive they've scientifically proven
[1:11:12] that a problem and we're in a mixed
[1:11:14] audience i w go to details problem that
[1:11:16] young men can have can be directly
[1:11:19] related to the displeasure of their
[1:11:23] father directly related to an emotional
[1:11:26] instability so they find stability in
[1:11:29] other things again we're mixed mixed
[1:11:31] audience they find stability in these
[1:11:33] other things and it's simply a byproduct
[1:11:36] of emotional
[1:11:39] damage so now because of that emotional
[1:11:42] damage they don't give that to God you
[1:11:44] see that's why we need more teaching in
[1:11:47] the house of God we more teaching for
[1:11:49] for young men and young women around
[1:11:51] these things cuz many times it's not
[1:11:53] that you need a preacher to lay hands on
[1:11:54] you and say say you know be delivered
[1:11:56] it's that you need to recognize actually
[1:11:58] this is not the problem this is the
[1:12:00] problem over here brother Brandon when
[1:12:02] they would come to him in the line he
[1:12:03] would discern them and says he wouldn't
[1:12:05] just say oh you have an ulcer let's pray
[1:12:07] God delivers you from an ulcer he would
[1:12:09] says oh you have an ulcer cuz you're
[1:12:11] really stressed and you're really
[1:12:13] stressed because there was a dog that
[1:12:16] chased you when you were younger and you
[1:12:18] it put a fear in you now what did he do
[1:12:21] he exposed the real
[1:12:23] demon he SPO the ulcer was just the
[1:12:26] byproduct of the real issue many times
[1:12:30] cancer is just the byproduct of the real
[1:12:33] issue because it's a bruised Spirit
[1:12:35] brother mam
[1:12:42] says but if we're not careful when we
[1:12:44] try to we try to release the pressure
[1:12:47] that we feel through the things of the
[1:12:49] world that's being selfish because the
[1:12:51] things of the world give us pleasure but
[1:12:54] the things of God give him
[1:12:58] pleasure that is selfs surrendered when
[1:13:01] you had the desire to give and make the
[1:13:04] other guy have the better deal you are
[1:13:07] fulfilling the scripture that says no
[1:13:08] greater love hath any man than this that
[1:13:10] a man would lay down his life for his
[1:13:13] friend that is not just in battle saying
[1:13:16] I'll jump in front of the
[1:13:17] bullet and you hope your heroics made it
[1:13:21] to the cinema that is not what it's
[1:13:23] about laying your life down for your
[1:13:24] brother brother is saying I'll take the
[1:13:27] blame even though it wasn't me I won't
[1:13:31] correct them because it would damage the
[1:13:37] reputation I'm not saying you go out and
[1:13:39] say it was me it was my fault and lie
[1:13:41] I'm saying if blame is indirectly put
[1:13:44] upon you don't defend yourself put it in
[1:13:46] God's hands God will deal with it lest
[1:13:49] you damage brother B many many times in
[1:13:52] in in his opening statements his the
[1:13:55] preliminary of a sermon many times and
[1:13:58] just talking he would say oh this but I
[1:14:00] would have damaged that brother's
[1:14:01] reputation and the man didn't even agree
[1:14:04] with him didn't even didn't even agree
[1:14:06] in the godhead didn't even agree in
[1:14:08] water baptism yeah brother bham didn't
[1:14:11] shame him and correct
[1:14:14] him slow to
[1:14:17] wrath quick to hear slow to speak slow
[1:14:20] to
[1:14:21] wrath these the attributes you know I've
[1:14:24] been think thinking a long time about
[1:14:28] things in well about people I think a
[1:14:33] lot about
[1:14:35] people and about myself because I
[1:14:37] realize I'm preaching at myself tonight
[1:14:39] Saints I need to hear this I need to
[1:14:42] hear this because if I want to be any
[1:14:45] effect I can't do anything he has to do
[1:14:52] everything but you have to remember that
[1:14:55] good men can speak and not
[1:14:58] act we do not judge a man's ability or
[1:15:02] his character or his beliefs or his
[1:15:05] Revelation on what he can
[1:15:08] say we judge all of that based on the
[1:15:12] fruits of his life somebody can be very
[1:15:17] anointed but the fruits don't point to
[1:15:22] Christ that's where we judge
[1:15:25] if my peach tree had Peach has by all
[1:15:29] appearances I have can we you guys know
[1:15:31] we have Peach Tree got the leaves of a
[1:15:33] peach tree it's got the the shape of a
[1:15:35] peach tree it's got the bark of a peach
[1:15:37] tree if you cut it you know it's got the
[1:15:39] smell of a peach tree now what if it put
[1:15:42] out
[1:15:43] plums boy we'd all be really
[1:15:46] confused what would we say oh we were
[1:15:49] mistaken that's a plum
[1:15:53] tree so what happened a
[1:15:55] Believer a member of the message
[1:15:58] Community says he believes says right
[1:16:01] and then it comes down to the harvest
[1:16:03] season and instead of God fruit it's
[1:16:06] devil
[1:16:07] fruit we're going to say oh it's a devil
[1:16:11] tree we were mistaken we are not going
[1:16:14] to say oh yes this tree brings for devil
[1:16:17] fruit even though it's God
[1:16:23] tree always judge by by the fruits now
[1:16:26] what did I say
[1:16:28] earlier don't cast this sermon to
[1:16:31] someone else we're going to bring it
[1:16:32] right back to
[1:16:34] ourselves we say we believe we come to
[1:16:37] church but can I look at my life and see
[1:16:40] the fruits of the Gospel can I see my
[1:16:43] look at my life and see the fruits of
[1:16:44] the
[1:16:45] spirit that's probably the least
[1:16:47] preached on scripture in the Bible in my
[1:16:52] personal perspective of of of things you
[1:16:56] hardly ever hear the fruits of the
[1:16:58] spirit preached on we'd much rather hear
[1:17:00] about the Seven Seals they much rather
[1:17:02] hear about the the be behind the veil we
[1:17:05] much rather hear about you know the the
[1:17:07] the Tabernacle in the wilderness we much
[1:17:09] rather hear about these things yet we
[1:17:12] cannot be with Christ unless we are like
[1:17:19] Christ
[1:17:21] so James puts it this I can't read write
[1:17:25] the
[1:17:26] Bible pure religion and undefiled before
[1:17:30] God and the father is this to visit the
[1:17:33] fatherless and widows in their
[1:17:35] Affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[1:17:38] from the world James defines pure
[1:17:43] religion in this way how do we Define
[1:17:47] pure religion we say pure religion is a
[1:17:49] belief that God sent a
[1:17:53] prophet and we adhere to a message
[1:17:55] Community culture and a code and we say
[1:18:00] you're it you got it cuz you act like
[1:18:02] the rest of us and we say hey I got it
[1:18:05] CU I act like
[1:18:07] you then we've just adapted to some
[1:18:09] moral code guess what Germany did that
[1:18:11] on the the regime of Hitler and they
[1:18:14] murdered innocent people
[1:18:18] so what's
[1:18:21] truth what is truth
[1:18:25] everybody sister R everybody has to
[1:18:27] adhere to her moral
[1:18:29] code everybody has to adhere to her
[1:18:31] moral code everybody picks something to
[1:18:34] follow everybody picks unless you
[1:18:37] misunderstand she had a question on
[1:18:39] Sunday sun in Sunday
[1:18:40] school everybody has has something that
[1:18:44] they're going to live by they're going
[1:18:45] to pick and and and and they're going to
[1:18:48] be a lot of it has to do with how
[1:18:49] they're raised you know if they're
[1:18:52] raised to be Christians and they go to
[1:18:53] college they're going to going to be
[1:18:55] atheists if they raised to be atheists
[1:18:58] and they go to college they going to be
[1:19:00] Christians because when kids hit that
[1:19:02] age they want to do the opposite of what
[1:19:05] their parents did because yuck that's
[1:19:07] stale look at them they're
[1:19:10] old it's the desire of the Next
[1:19:12] Generation to to put new life and and
[1:19:14] that's a god-given
[1:19:15] desire channeled in the right direction
[1:19:18] that's what brings positive change in
[1:19:21] the church and and everywhere else in
[1:19:22] our communities but it has to be direct
[1:19:24] directed by
[1:19:26] God so everybody has something that
[1:19:28] they're going to
[1:19:29] follow so what do we
[1:19:32] follow what do we do well I choose to
[1:19:36] follow the word because I think the word
[1:19:37] brings the best
[1:19:40] fruits that's actually all it comes down
[1:19:43] to it all comes down to
[1:19:46] that
[1:19:48] so James says Hey bear the
[1:19:51] fruits so if you bear the fruits you say
[1:19:53] you're a peach tree come Harvest we're
[1:19:55] expecting
[1:19:56] peaches come Harvest God is expecting
[1:20:01] wheat amen trying to do God of service
[1:20:03] without it
[1:20:04] without 1965 he preaches this sermon
[1:20:08] title is too long he says that's the way
[1:20:10] God sees you it ain't what you see your
[1:20:13] own self it's the way God sees you you
[1:20:15] know there's that scripture in Proverbs
[1:20:17] I think it's Proverbs see the Proverbs
[1:20:19] or Psalms where it says every man is
[1:20:20] right in his own eyes that scripture has
[1:20:23] been bringing through my my head
[1:20:25] probably every day the past few weeks
[1:20:29] I'll think of something I'll think of of
[1:20:31] a situation and I'll and I'll judge it a
[1:20:34] certain way and then I remind it again
[1:20:37] you think you're right because it's your
[1:20:41] opinion you think you're right because
[1:20:43] you are talking to
[1:20:46] yourself you are agreeing with yourself
[1:20:48] the world calls that an echo chamber
[1:20:54] because all you are is surrounded by
[1:20:57] people who agree with
[1:20:58] you brother B said today in in the the
[1:21:01] tape I was listening to he says you need
[1:21:03] to be surrounded by people that
[1:21:05] challenge you that challenge what you
[1:21:08] believe he says you need people to
[1:21:10] disagree with you you need it lest you
[1:21:14] he says lest you become
[1:21:17] stale so it ain't what you see your own
[1:21:20] self it's the way God sees you so it
[1:21:23] therefore it is imper ative that we look
[1:21:25] ourselves into the mirror of God's word
[1:21:29] he says no man sees himself wrong when
[1:21:32] you look in the mirror of God's word it
[1:21:34] tells you whether you're wrong or not
[1:21:37] you see back to the word look to the
[1:21:40] word of God say the fruits I see are
[1:21:44] they of the word and if they are praise
[1:21:46] God the fruits you see if they're not of
[1:21:48] the word you need to kill that
[1:21:52] tree and don't use this water down stuff
[1:21:55] that's all natural from you know Walmart
[1:21:58] go to the farm grade Roundup and poison
[1:22:01] that thing so it shrivels up and dies he
[1:22:04] says oh we just you know we'll throw a
[1:22:06] little watered down religion on this
[1:22:09] issue you know we we won't really we
[1:22:11] won't really we don't want to get too
[1:22:12] harsh you know we don't we don't want to
[1:22:13] get too pointed in our in our statements
[1:22:16] we don't get too pointed in what we
[1:22:17] preach we don't want to get too pointed
[1:22:19] in in our worship song so we'll keep it
[1:22:21] vague we you just water it down and and
[1:22:24] there's still some poison in there to
[1:22:25] kill the devil but but but not
[1:22:28] enough not enough when the rain comes
[1:22:31] down it washes away you know what
[1:22:33] happens when you spray round up and it
[1:22:34] rains it kills everything
[1:22:36] else it doesn't wash
[1:22:40] away the real power of God is in our
[1:22:44] lives to destroy what is not of
[1:22:48] God because where God is there is light
[1:22:52] and darkness can't exist as simple as
[1:22:55] that it isn't that there's some magic
[1:22:58] behind it it's just simply that the more
[1:22:59] of God the less of the devil to put it
[1:23:02] in denominational
[1:23:07] terms the the more of God the less of
[1:23:10] you more when you look in the mirror of
[1:23:13] God's word it tells you whether you're
[1:23:15] wrong or
[1:23:17] not had this conversation with my my
[1:23:19] daughter the other day I said sweetheart
[1:23:21] you're like your dad and I'm sorry
[1:23:25] I said you have to learn to be more
[1:23:27] honest with yourself about
[1:23:31] yourself because I have a tendency to
[1:23:34] say
[1:23:35] well and talk myself out of something
[1:23:38] that I did well you know I just this
[1:23:40] that and the other it's like
[1:23:43] no this is why you did it be more honest
[1:23:47] be more
[1:23:49] honest and it's the same thing look in
[1:23:51] the mirror of God word of God's word be
[1:23:53] more honest hon with yourself say don't
[1:23:56] become
[1:23:57] legalistic don't become legalistic don't
[1:24:00] become a Pharisee you have Grace you
[1:24:02] have the blood of Jesus Christ to cover
[1:24:03] those things you don't even know you did
[1:24:07] wrong but there's always room to grow
[1:24:10] there's always room to grow but don't be
[1:24:13] legalistic things that are to be he says
[1:24:16] now they say oh I've done this I've
[1:24:17] shouted the spirit I've spoken tongues
[1:24:20] but look there is something lacking in
[1:24:21] my life I look in the mirror of God's
[1:24:23] word I know there's
[1:24:25] something I go to church but I'm not
[1:24:27] what I should be see that shows that
[1:24:33] something now if you can look at
[1:24:35] yourself and see that you're not lined
[1:24:36] up with God's word and there's nothing
[1:24:40] in there that'll cause you to raise your
[1:24:42] hand then you know there's something
[1:24:44] wrong he's making an alter
[1:24:48] call so he's saying you act like a
[1:24:51] Christian you act like the message in
[1:24:53] church
[1:24:57] but then you look in the mirror of God's
[1:24:58] word and there's something
[1:25:01] lacking he says now that shows that
[1:25:04] something but you recognize it the key
[1:25:07] is here the difference between the two
[1:25:08] is one sees himself in the mirror of
[1:25:10] God's word recognizes the error and says
[1:25:13] God help me the other looks at
[1:25:16] themselves not lined up with the word of
[1:25:18] God and there's nothing in their hearts
[1:25:20] that'll cause them to go to repentance
[1:25:25] sometimes a true child of God can be so
[1:25:27] wound up in Pride that that's what holds
[1:25:29] him back sometimes they're just not
[1:25:31] children of God but I believe I'm
[1:25:34] speaking to the children of God so don't
[1:25:36] let Pride hold you back when you see
[1:25:39] you're in error don't don't don't take
[1:25:42] it don't take it as correction from a
[1:25:44] man say is it God is it God is God
[1:25:49] directing me to you know there's so much
[1:25:52] in our lives that that you know there
[1:25:54] there's so many blessings that God have
[1:25:55] in store for us know God's been dealing
[1:25:57] with my heart saying Chris I've got so
[1:25:59] much more for you if you'll just give me
[1:26:01] more
[1:26:02] time should I then should I then say
[1:26:05] well you know that's just Brother David
[1:26:06] or that's just brother
[1:26:08] Paul if the man is behind the pulpit and
[1:26:10] you're sitting in the congregation then
[1:26:14] that means you agree with the
[1:26:17] ministry if you don't you shouldn't be
[1:26:19] here find a different church but if you
[1:26:21] agree with the ministry then you agree
[1:26:23] to say that God is speaking through that
[1:26:25] man then if God is speaking to that man
[1:26:28] don't pick and choose take what he says
[1:26:32] back to the word of God with an unbiased
[1:26:35] perspective when a brother get up here
[1:26:37] you think he's being too harsh take what
[1:26:39] he says back to the word of God Is it
[1:26:41] true if it's not true then I know that
[1:26:44] myself Brother David brother Paul we
[1:26:45] would want you to come and say you said
[1:26:47] this and I can't find it in the Bible
[1:26:49] can you please help
[1:26:50] me by by all means please do I love I
[1:26:54] love talking about the word of God
[1:26:56] anyways but you see then there there in
[1:26:58] lies now back to leadership there in
[1:27:00] lies the the the the the sacred
[1:27:02] responsibility we have as leaders in our
[1:27:05] home in our church in our in in in in
[1:27:08] our business we have to cultivate a
[1:27:11] approachable
[1:27:13] character getting up and telling you
[1:27:16] give me feedback please give me feedback
[1:27:18] tell me when I'm wrong oh I'd love to
[1:27:19] hear it but then your fruits are not the
[1:27:23] fruits of a person who is approachable
[1:27:25] you can kiss whatever you say
[1:27:27] goodbye somebody can ask you and tell
[1:27:30] you that that they'll take your feedback
[1:27:32] they long their if their characteristics
[1:27:34] are a man of of like nope it's got to be
[1:27:37] this way or or the highway nobody's
[1:27:39] going to tell that man you're
[1:27:41] wrong it's going to take a special
[1:27:44] anointed man especially in the church a
[1:27:46] special anointed
[1:27:48] man who is Led of God given the strength
[1:27:51] and courage of God to go and talk to
[1:27:53] them
[1:27:55] feedback is not is not requested
[1:27:58] feedback
[1:28:01] feedback feedback shouldn't be requested
[1:28:03] shouldn't have to be requested feedback
[1:28:05] should just generate from the atmosphere
[1:28:08] that you create as a leader in your home
[1:28:11] especially in your home especially in
[1:28:14] your home Lord I I pray all the time God
[1:28:15] help me to be more approachable because
[1:28:17] I remember growing up and different
[1:28:19] times in my life you know different
[1:28:20] situations you just he go through things
[1:28:22] that brother Ben mccaffery most of you
[1:28:23] know know who he is you know he said the
[1:28:25] best thing I ever heard and never forgot
[1:28:27] it he says he says don't worry about it
[1:28:29] he says no matter what you do when your
[1:28:30] kids become adults they'll need therapy
[1:28:32] because of
[1:28:34] you and it's true because you have an
[1:28:36] imperfect human raising an imperfect
[1:28:39] human and for a large portion of their
[1:28:42] life as you were raising them they are
[1:28:44] completely unconverted and they're
[1:28:47] heathens cuz they don't have God yet you
[1:28:49] apply the token to your home and you
[1:28:51] have an atmosphere in your home that
[1:28:53] that draws
[1:28:54] th those those those responses from them
[1:28:57] you'll see the response and then that
[1:28:59] response to to the moral code of the
[1:29:01] word of God will lead them to Christ
[1:29:04] himself then they have a new birth so
[1:29:07] they'll they they'll act like God
[1:29:09] because you're they're in your home if
[1:29:11] you are creating that kind of atmosphere
[1:29:13] they'll act according to the word of God
[1:29:15] because you're training them up that's
[1:29:17] the Bible says train a child in the way
[1:29:18] they should go and they will not depart
[1:29:20] from it that is not commanding them how
[1:29:23] to live like God that's showing them how
[1:29:25] to live like God and creating an
[1:29:27] atmosphere in your home that promotes
[1:29:29] Godly behavior and then they as they
[1:29:33] live in that atmosphere for a while
[1:29:34] they'll begin to see there's a
[1:29:35] difference between home and the world
[1:29:37] there's a difference between home and
[1:29:39] church and the world and they begin to
[1:29:41] ask themselves do I want that and if
[1:29:45] it's the right atmosphere and it's the
[1:29:47] right guiding and leading along they'll
[1:29:50] receive it that is training a child in
[1:29:53] the way they should go go it is creating
[1:29:55] an atmosphere that promotes Godly
[1:30:02] Behavior so we as Leaders we must create
[1:30:05] that atmosphere where our children can
[1:30:07] come to us and say I'm having a hard
[1:30:09] time with
[1:30:11] this and and even even you can do the
[1:30:13] best that you can and you can create a
[1:30:15] positive atmosphere and there are just
[1:30:16] certain things that kids deal with that
[1:30:18] are just very hard to speak they're just
[1:30:22] just takes great courage on part of a
[1:30:24] child to speak you know kids are born in
[1:30:28] the world you know shaped in iniquity
[1:30:29] come in the world speaking
[1:30:31] lies you know your your kid is your kid
[1:30:34] is is until converted is unconverted
[1:30:36] simple as that and we think we have to
[1:30:38] remember that we have to remember that
[1:30:40] we're dealing with
[1:30:45] them but you're dealing with them you
[1:30:47] know sometimes you say Hey you know you
[1:30:49] told the truth all right thank you right
[1:30:53] this is where I with thank you for
[1:30:54] telling me the truth now you're in
[1:30:56] trouble but there's a balance sometimes
[1:30:59] kids need to be encouraged say thank you
[1:31:01] for telling me the truth the sacrifice
[1:31:03] you made to tell me the truth was a
[1:31:05] punishment enough to correct the
[1:31:08] error talking about when somebody lies
[1:31:10] then they make it right so there's all
[1:31:13] these things that we have to deal with
[1:31:14] you know I think all of us know who Dale
[1:31:16] Carnegie is he was an American writer
[1:31:18] from lived from 1888 to 1955 and he was
[1:31:22] one of the the Pioneers for self
[1:31:23] selfimprovement and and and and you know
[1:31:26] public speaking and he wrote the famous
[1:31:28] book How to Win Friends and Influence
[1:31:30] People and um he just he's a classic
[1:31:33] when it comes to personal
[1:31:35] development and he he had this folder he
[1:31:39] kept that he Acron as
[1:31:41] DFT and um basically it was a collection
[1:31:44] of his blunders and mistreatments of
[1:31:46] others so he maybe having a conversation
[1:31:49] maybe got upset with somebody and you
[1:31:50] know spoke down to them he would write
[1:31:53] that down
[1:31:54] and put it in this folder and every once
[1:31:56] in a while he would bring the folder out
[1:31:58] and he would so this is direct quote he
[1:32:00] says reread the criticisms I have
[1:32:02] written of myself they do more to help
[1:32:05] and direct me than anything Solomon
[1:32:06] could have written this is a this is a
[1:32:09] man I don't don't believe was converted
[1:32:11] I don't know you know back in them days
[1:32:13] things were different but he says they
[1:32:16] help me to deal with the biggest problem
[1:32:19] I shall ever face the management of Dale
[1:32:22] Carnegie
[1:32:24] and that just struck me I I just
[1:32:26] happened to read this this blog post and
[1:32:29] talking about this this man reflecting
[1:32:32] on on these mistakes and I thought how
[1:32:34] powerful a man who who who who perhaps
[1:32:37] did not even have a relationship with
[1:32:38] God didn't I don't his life didn't seem
[1:32:40] to reflect that but wasn't a Christian
[1:32:42] he's just a man of self-improvement he
[1:32:44] laid hold of the the the the the the
[1:32:46] biggest principle and the thing we
[1:32:48] struggle with the most the management of
[1:32:51] ourselves he says that is the biggest
[1:32:55] problem I shall ever
[1:32:57] face that is the biggest problem you and
[1:33:01] I will ever face is the management of
[1:33:04] Chris take the management of Trevor Cox
[1:33:07] the
[1:33:08] management of
[1:33:12] VI I'm trying to use the feminine
[1:33:14] version gas right that the management of
[1:33:17] ourselves that's the biggest problem
[1:33:20] we'll ever have to
[1:33:22] face yet we treat problems in others
[1:33:25] like the world's ending we got to fix
[1:33:32] them but here's what happens let's say
[1:33:36] in the church there a situation and it
[1:33:38] doesn't line up with the word of God
[1:33:40] whatever is
[1:33:42] happening and you say I have the
[1:33:46] scripture right here to show and I'm
[1:33:48] closing soon the scripture right here to
[1:33:50] show that they're wrong I better get the
[1:33:53] pastor we better go to them or I better
[1:33:55] go to them personally cuz that's also in
[1:33:58] the scripture right says go to your
[1:34:00] brother okay so by all means of the
[1:34:03] scripture you are in the correct
[1:34:05] position but your objective is is
[1:34:09] right what's your
[1:34:12] motive motive is is the the vehicle that
[1:34:15] gets you to the objective if your
[1:34:17] objective is to to get to Denver
[1:34:19] Colorado the motive is the
[1:34:21] airplane it's a simple way of describing
[1:34:24] so the motive well you the objective is
[1:34:27] is to say Hey you know we want we want
[1:34:28] peace in the house of God we want things
[1:34:30] in order in the house of God it's all
[1:34:32] true it's all bible-based but what is
[1:34:36] your motive are you going because
[1:34:39] they're wrong and I need to correct them
[1:34:42] here's the
[1:34:43] thing many times that's the case
[1:34:46] unfortunately so what we should do is
[1:34:49] take it lay ourselves before God for the
[1:34:52] bandom there's a quote where brother
[1:34:53] brandham see if I can pull it up really
[1:34:55] quickly he talks about being
[1:34:58] neutral he's talking about going to
[1:35:00] prayer I don't I don't have it here uh
[1:35:01] Gideon he talks about going to prayer
[1:35:04] and I have this this little reference
[1:35:06] document that called quotes for later
[1:35:08] you should all start
[1:35:10] one or just keep a running list of of
[1:35:12] quotes for quotes for
[1:35:16] later and uh so he he's talking about uh
[1:35:19] getting he he's talking about getting
[1:35:21] neutral and um
[1:35:25] see if I can get it right
[1:35:27] here and this is in questions and
[1:35:29] answers
[1:35:30] 1961 well that's just fantastic I was
[1:35:33] reading from that today he
[1:35:40] says he's a question he says how do you
[1:35:42] feel it's a long quote you just bear
[1:35:44] with me because I think it's important
[1:35:45] tonight how do you feel is the best way
[1:35:47] to find how do you feel is the best way
[1:35:50] to find the Lord's will in some
[1:35:52] important matters now we're talking
[1:35:54] about this as an example right now of
[1:35:55] important situation in the church for
[1:35:59] example that needs to be dealt with and
[1:36:02] everything around it is scriptural even
[1:36:05] even you going to them is scriptural but
[1:36:07] now watch what he says he says you still
[1:36:10] need to find the will of the Lord
[1:36:11] because God's word is his will but he
[1:36:13] says God's Will has a time and a
[1:36:18] season he says now I don't believe let
[1:36:20] me see if I can get the continuity to it
[1:36:23] so he says how do you feel is the best
[1:36:25] way to find the Lord's will in some
[1:36:27] important matters I tell you dear friend
[1:36:29] the best way to find the will of God in
[1:36:30] some important matters is prayer here's
[1:36:33] a wonderful little thing here if you
[1:36:35] have a matter that's very important
[1:36:38] here's the way I do it I take it before
[1:36:40] the Lord it's always been my strength I
[1:36:42] wait upon the Lord and see what he says
[1:36:45] and I just let myself neutral to it
[1:36:50] don't take either side
[1:36:53] say now heavenly father of course now in
[1:36:56] my my case most of the time if it's very
[1:36:59] important I wait on a vision we're not
[1:37:02] the prophet he says but many people God
[1:37:04] doesn't deal with in Visions so
[1:37:06] therefore I wouldn't advise you to do
[1:37:08] that because it's just some people that
[1:37:10] has visions and some does something
[1:37:14] else God deals with us differently so I
[1:37:17] would if I was in your place didn't have
[1:37:19] visions from before the Lord I would
[1:37:21] just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now
[1:37:23] you show me what's the decision to make
[1:37:25] so but the point I want to get back as
[1:37:27] he says I just let myself get neutral to
[1:37:30] it so here's a situation you know the
[1:37:33] right way according to scripture to
[1:37:34] approach it you you you you you by by
[1:37:37] your perspective it needs to be
[1:37:39] corrected because wrong should be made
[1:37:42] right that that is a that is a that is a
[1:37:44] just desire but so that's a just
[1:37:47] objective but he says go to prayer and
[1:37:50] get neutral on it in other words Lord
[1:37:53] Lord either way I'm fine with and it's
[1:37:57] not just saying the words Lord either
[1:37:59] way I'm fine with it right then we're
[1:38:00] just Catholics repeating a prayer but in
[1:38:03] your heart you say God I'm you got to
[1:38:06] pray until you don't pray for the
[1:38:07] situation you just spend time praying
[1:38:09] Lord your will is always perfect Lord I
[1:38:12] I you know you you know the ways you you
[1:38:14] know you know my struggles father you
[1:38:17] know my self you know you know where I'm
[1:38:19] lacking God you know give you the glory
[1:38:23] Lord lord it's so good to serve you
[1:38:25] right you're praying until that
[1:38:27] atmosphere comes down and now you're
[1:38:29] just standing with God and you don't
[1:38:31] care either way you don't care which
[1:38:34] direction it goes now he says now you
[1:38:37] can pray for the leadership of the Lord
[1:38:40] because otherwise we'll go to prayer
[1:38:42] with a decision already made in our head
[1:38:44] and as we pray we'll say oh God spoke to
[1:38:47] me been there and done
[1:38:49] that I can't stand it it's it's a it's a
[1:38:53] shame was
[1:38:54] embarrassing for myself you know just
[1:38:56] look and say what was I thinking CU I
[1:39:00] didn't get neutral
[1:39:01] first he didn't get neutral
[1:39:07] first in closing here the definition of
[1:39:09] eternal life is living for others that
[1:39:13] day on Calvary 1960 first thing I want
[1:39:15] to say is Jesus never lived for himself
[1:39:18] his life was spent for others that's
[1:39:22] perfectly ET etal life when you say you
[1:39:25] go to church and you do good things
[1:39:27] that's fine but when you live your life
[1:39:30] to yourself you haven't eternal life
[1:39:35] that about
[1:39:36] dismantles every single one of
[1:39:40] us my wife and I we we some years ago we
[1:39:45] received we received
[1:39:48] um like information or or just blog Post
[1:39:52] article something from online an
[1:39:53] influencer basically about this concept
[1:39:56] of you can't pour from an empty
[1:39:59] cup basically the idea was you know
[1:40:02] we're called to they were a Christian
[1:40:03] so-called at the PO at the at the time
[1:40:06] the the the point was that they were
[1:40:08] making was how can you pour your pour
[1:40:10] yourself out for other people if you
[1:40:12] have nothing to pour from so my wife and
[1:40:14] I we thought hey that sounds pretty good
[1:40:17] and in following that practice this is
[1:40:20] why you have to be so careful with
[1:40:22] social media and fluences online because
[1:40:24] there's a lot of things that sound good
[1:40:26] but they're not they don't they're not
[1:40:28] founded on the word of
[1:40:29] God and we started to to say well we're
[1:40:32] too tired to do that we we don't have
[1:40:35] enough money to do that we don't have
[1:40:37] you know we don't want to go there
[1:40:39] because of this and we don't have you
[1:40:40] know we're just working and we're trying
[1:40:42] to take care of the family so we're
[1:40:43] going to just stay home and and sleep
[1:40:45] we're going to we're not going to go
[1:40:46] over there we're not going to do that
[1:40:48] we're not going to do this cuz we don't
[1:40:50] we don't want to pour from an empty cup
[1:40:52] and what happened is we became
[1:40:53] selfish we became selfish we lost some
[1:40:57] friends because you know if you don't
[1:40:59] invest in if you don't invest into your
[1:41:03] friendships you won't have friends
[1:41:06] people say oh I just have no friends and
[1:41:09] I people just don't like me if you
[1:41:12] always want your way when you're around
[1:41:13] those
[1:41:14] people people don't want to deal with
[1:41:17] that so you have to go you have to you
[1:41:21] have to give of yourself I'm not talking
[1:41:23] about compromising on the word of God
[1:41:24] don't go there but just be a friend
[1:41:27] those who have friends show themselves
[1:41:29] friendly and so this idea and then and
[1:41:32] then I I came across this I came across
[1:41:36] this and I thought we missed it he says
[1:41:40] he
[1:41:42] says when you live your life for
[1:41:45] yourself you haven't eternal
[1:41:49] life he doesn't say when you feel good
[1:41:52] when when you have a full cup when you
[1:41:55] have enough money in the bank when you
[1:41:58] have enough food on your shelf he says
[1:42:00] no he says eternal life is living for
[1:42:03] other people the reason Society is so
[1:42:07] depressed is because everybody lives for
[1:42:11] themselves there are some who have some
[1:42:13] some coaches who you know personal
[1:42:16] therapist coaches that have picked up
[1:42:18] picked up on the concept of giving and
[1:42:20] how giving actually incre so so there's
[1:42:22] some of that out there but for the most
[1:42:23] part everybody's saying hey you feel
[1:42:26] terrible it's CU you need to do more for
[1:42:29] yourself and so all that does is
[1:42:31] compound the problem he says eternal
[1:42:33] life is living for other
[1:42:35] people so next time you're faced with a
[1:42:38] decision coming to
[1:42:41] church I I say this a bit tongue and-
[1:42:43] cheek because I've said some other
[1:42:44] things in this sermon that might seem to
[1:42:46] contradict it so take it for what it's
[1:42:48] worth but coming to church sometimes if
[1:42:52] if the only thing that can get you here
[1:42:53] I I hope this is not the case but if the
[1:42:56] only thing can that can get you here is
[1:42:58] to say I want to be there to show my
[1:43:00] brother I'm with
[1:43:02] him then let it be
[1:43:05] that coming to church should not just be
[1:43:08] about yourself what can the preacher
[1:43:10] tell me what what what your presence
[1:43:13] alone your your your prayed up position
[1:43:15] is a help to the house of God sometimes
[1:43:19] coming to church can be for those around
[1:43:21] you now I would hope hope that you come
[1:43:23] to church because there's something in
[1:43:25] your heart that says I got to be there
[1:43:27] right that's what we
[1:43:34] want now I read the first scripture
[1:43:37] because all of this comes into this
[1:43:38] context when I was a child I spake as a
[1:43:41] child I understood as a child so your
[1:43:45] understanding changes as you grow I
[1:43:48] thought as a child but when I became a
[1:43:50] man I put away childish things and if we
[1:43:54] constantly in our own lives season the
[1:43:57] reproach season the correction with a
[1:44:00] well but sometimes days are hard that's
[1:44:03] what children
[1:44:05] do children
[1:44:08] season flaws in their character with
[1:44:11] well but she
[1:44:12] said but he hit me first that's a
[1:44:16] childish thing to do a man a mature
[1:44:21] Christian takes the correction and says
[1:44:24] yes I need to do better and understands
[1:44:27] the
[1:44:28] nuances you shouldn't have to constantly
[1:44:32] season correction when you're talking to
[1:44:34] an adult you should be able to say this
[1:44:37] and this okay got it as a child you have
[1:44:42] to explain the nuances and explain the
[1:44:44] details of why and all of the behavior
[1:44:46] because you're training them but when
[1:44:48] they became a man you say this and they
[1:44:52] say okay you're right right they change
[1:44:54] it but if you constantly season it with
[1:44:57] well the day was hard or well I had to
[1:45:00] work late or well I had to you know I
[1:45:03] wasn't feeling well or I just I just
[1:45:05] didn't have the energy if you're
[1:45:07] constantly giving yourself excuses you
[1:45:09] won't change your behavior but as soon
[1:45:12] as you own up to the discrepancy in your
[1:45:14] life and you say God this is a problem I
[1:45:18] can't fix
[1:45:20] it you will see mountains move
[1:45:23] suddenly going to church is just what
[1:45:25] you
[1:45:27] do bad to say that on a Wednesday night
[1:45:29] when nobody's
[1:45:32] here like I said we should be able to
[1:45:34] talk to each
[1:45:36] other mono on mono right man to man
[1:45:40] woman to woman understand we we we we
[1:45:42] talked about this I said I was closing
[1:45:44] okay I'm sorry so he says it proved it
[1:45:48] when it come in the Lamb of God he lived
[1:45:50] and had eternal life because he did not
[1:45:51] live for himself sister you come to the
[1:45:53] piano he live for others and you receive
[1:45:56] eternal life by receiving that day and
[1:45:59] you don't live for yourself no more you
[1:46:02] live for others someone said how can you
[1:46:04] stand let anybody call you such bad
[1:46:07] names you don't live for yourself you
[1:46:09] live for
[1:46:11] others that you might redeem that
[1:46:14] man you become Sons see Elisha had the
[1:46:18] ability a type of the Bride had the
[1:46:20] ability to redeem those children and
[1:46:22] their families instead he called she
[1:46:24] Bears out to eat
[1:46:27] them you don't live for yourself you
[1:46:29] live for others that you might redeem
[1:46:31] that man you become sons and the trouble
[1:46:34] of it is the church has forgot they were
[1:46:36] Sons if I wonder if step did not call to
[1:46:40] Heaven Lord forgive them for they do not
[1:46:43] know what they do if Saul would have
[1:46:45] been judged and
[1:46:47] condemned but for the sake of Saul step
[1:46:50] lifted his voice to heaven and forgave
[1:46:52] them he
[1:46:54] redeemed that
[1:46:56] man because he said I live for
[1:47:02] others he says you become Sons he says
[1:47:05] and the trouble of it is the church has
[1:47:07] forgot they were
[1:47:10] Sons so many times we get amnesia and we
[1:47:15] forget who we
[1:47:17] are if you knew you were a son of the
[1:47:19] king you would act like a son of the
[1:47:22] king
[1:47:25] if I really knew I was a son of the king
[1:47:28] I would act like a son of the
[1:47:31] King Church has forgotten they were Sons
[1:47:34] you're a son you're taking Christ's
[1:47:37] place you're a son so don't live for
[1:47:40] yourself live for others brother brandom
[1:47:43] I can live for this brother cuz he sure
[1:47:45] is a nice man that's not it live for
[1:47:48] that man who hates you live for that
[1:47:50] person who would kill you if they they
[1:47:53] could that's what they done to him they
[1:47:55] killed him and he died that he might
[1:47:59] save them the very people who put him on
[1:48:02] the cross he
[1:48:07] saved that's eternal life we love to
[1:48:12] talk about all the other attributes of
[1:48:16] God let's not leave this
[1:48:18] one undisclosed
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:23] when you that's in your bosom you're
[1:48:24] facing heaven then but you sacrifice
[1:48:27] your own things give them up like the
[1:48:29] sheep gives its wool you look on towards
[1:48:32] Calvary let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:48:34] Father Lord
[1:48:36] Jesus what a task we have before us
[1:48:40] father Lord if we've been going on the
[1:48:42] journey some past weeks and we've
[1:48:44] forgotten how important it is to leave
[1:48:47] live lead an unselfish life we have been
[1:48:51] reminded
[1:48:53] thank you Father thank you for reminding
[1:48:56] us help us to avoid the Trap of a
[1:48:59] self-centered life Lord It's like a it's
[1:49:02] like a plane that goes into a dive just
[1:49:06] gets worse and worse and faster and
[1:49:08] faster toward destruction but Lord may
[1:49:11] we grab the Yoke may we put our foot
[1:49:14] hard left rud and pull from the spin
[1:49:18] father that we avoid destruction by
[1:49:21] surrendering ourselves to you to
[1:49:24] you may you just come father in a
[1:49:26] special way give encouragement give lift
[1:49:29] up Lord if who came
[1:49:32] across from not a spirit of of of
[1:49:36] humbleness and not the right Spirit on
[1:49:38] my part you forgive me Father and you
[1:49:41] you you put the balm in guil but
[1:49:42] anything that came from you so straight
[1:49:45] it may be father maybe we were receive
[1:49:47] the correction in our own lives and just
[1:49:49] yield ourselves more to you father
[1:49:54] we ask we love you Lord and we thank you
[1:49:55] in Jesus name we pray amen you know
[1:49:59] brother B talks about if you're going
[1:50:00] one way and you want to change he says
[1:50:03] do the direct opposite if you're in an
[1:50:05] airplane and you go into a spin and
[1:50:06] you're spinning to the
[1:50:09] left whatever Direction you're spinning
[1:50:12] you hurt you hit hard Rudder the
[1:50:15] opposite
[1:50:16] direction and that pulls you from the
[1:50:18] spin sometimes things Storms Come in our
[1:50:20] life turbulence comes in our life and it
[1:50:23] knocks us off course but if we can put
[1:50:25] our foot down on the neck of the
[1:50:28] enemy the opposite direction there in
[1:50:31] lies our Victory by surrendering 1% if
[1:50:35] that's all you take home tonight
