[16:16] to remember my mother's sister, my aunt
[16:19] Dorothy lives in Arizona. She passed on
[16:23] here on the 7th.
[16:25] And uh just remember the family in

[16:42] together. Just take these requests.
[16:46] God is present. Do you realize that the

[16:50] &gt;&gt; Let's reverence him, rejoice in him,
[16:54] worship him. Amen. not only here but
[16:56] when we leave here remember his word is
[16:59] the believer's absolute.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Our Lord Jesus,
[17:05] we love you with all of our hearts
[17:07] beyond
[17:10] what we can express.
[17:12] [Music]
[17:14] We know that these prayer requests
[17:16] aren't by chance.
[17:20] You brought them before this assembly
[17:22] because you have confidence in your
[17:24] word.
[17:26] and that word living your little bride
[17:28] Lord in action.
[17:32] We're here to bring these before your
[17:33] throne and not as a hope but as faith
[17:39] believing we receive what we ask for.
[17:42] You know those that are traveling. You
[17:43] know about this upcoming camp.
[17:46] You know about the family of our sister
[17:48] Dorothy. She lived a wonderful life
[17:51] before you.
[17:53] She certainly witnessed and manifested
[17:55] your grace and faith in your promise.
[17:59] We rejoice that you've taken her home.
[18:03] Lord, we rejoice to know where she is
[18:05] and that soon and very soon we will meet
[18:09] them.
[18:10] Lord, if there's any here not prepared,
[18:13] may this morning,
[18:17] may their answer be yes, Lord. Yes to
[18:20] your way. You have a way. We must come
[18:24] your way. It's your achievement. It's
[18:27] your grace. It's all that you provided
[18:30] for us, Lord. Help us to appropriate it.
[18:32] You've given us everything we need to
[18:34] make a rapture.
[18:36] You provided it all. Let us just take
[18:39] it. Take a hold of it and stand firm.
[18:43] And I say, press on, little lily. Press
[18:45] on.
[18:47] The sun is up. May you ministered now to
[18:50] every need as we expect you to do so and
[18:53] we're expecting to receive from you this
[18:55] morning. We're not going to leave out of
[18:57] here this day the same way as we came
[18:59] in.
[19:01] Lord, we're expecting to be changed by
[19:03] your word from glory to glory. You are
[19:05] changing me.
[19:07] We rejoice in this Lord. We give you
[19:09] praise now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[19:12] May every one of these needs according
[19:13] to your will and desire be ministered.
[19:16] Bless our brother Paul,
[19:19] Lord, as he's prepared what you've given
[19:22] to him. May he speak out and may he
[19:24] speak things that Paul doesn't even know
[19:25] or none of us, Lord, but feed our soul.
[19:29] It's not the man that glories in your
[19:31] presence. It's your predestinated seed.
[19:34] That's the mystery that has been
[19:36] unveiled, Lord. We were with you from
[19:38] before the foundation of the world. Your
[19:39] very thoughts expressed in the word that
[19:41] we're about to receive and feed upon
[19:43] this morning.
[19:45] We call upon you for revelation that we
[19:47] may honor and glorify and please you in
[19:50] the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we
[19:53] give thanks to you. Amen.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. God bless you once
[20:00] again. Um everybody on the stream, God
[20:03] bless you. Hope you are blessed today.
[20:05] Um all visiting brother Olegenos, God
[20:10] bless you.
[20:11] Um,
[20:14] let's sing that song. Um,
[20:17] Lord, I lift your name. It's KFG.
[20:25] Lord, my heart can grow,
[20:30] so far away and cold.
[20:35] [Music]
[20:36] And yet for me, your love is still the
[20:42] same.
[20:48] Lord, I bend my knee
[20:53] in awe and fear of thee.
[20:59] My head bow down in reverence to your
[21:05] name.

[21:57] Lord, my heart's desire
[22:02] is to be filled with the spirit fire.
[22:08] My purpose is to worship you alone.

[22:26] to worship and adore.
[22:32] To be a fragrance
[22:35] offer to your throne.

[25:09] brother Paul to come
[25:14] into
[25:16] the chamber.

[27:16] [Music]
[27:22] is all I long for. Could we just stand
[27:28] this morning and just thank the Lord for
[27:31] his grace?
[27:33] He invited us into his chamber
[27:36] &gt;&gt; and his holy spirit has come,
[27:38] &gt;&gt; is speaking to us. We're not waiting for
[27:40] him to speak, but he's speaking even
[27:43] now. Just from the depths of your heart,
[27:45] say thank you to the Lord. Heavenly
[27:47] Father, we just thank you today. Grace
[27:50] and mercy so abundantly poured out upon
[27:53] us, Lord, and opened our eyes to your
[27:56] word. Father, you've poured your life
[27:58] into us. And Father, we come this
[28:01] morning just saying thank you. Thank
[28:04] you, Lord. Oh, what our lives would be
[28:08] without you, Father. Oh, we say thank
[28:11] you for your presence that you came,
[28:14] Father. You've met us in that secret
[28:16] place. You've touched us, poured your
[28:20] Holy Spirit into us, Lord. You
[28:23] strengthen us in an age, Lord, where the
[28:26] onslaught of Satan is so strong, but yet
[28:28] you come. You strengthen us, Lord. Not
[28:33] only in our flesh, in our mind, in our
[28:35] spirit. Father, oh Lord, we thank you.
[28:39] We lift our hands in thanksgiving today.
[28:43] Lord, we bless your holy name this
[28:45] morning. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[28:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[28:53] Hallelujah.
[28:54] [Music]
[28:56] Amen. Good to be here this morning.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:01] I don't know if I miss greeting someone.
[29:04] Please forgive me. Um it's just so good
[29:07] to see each and every one of you.
[29:09] Brother Daniel, been praying for you, my
[29:11] friend. Amen. and we see our
[29:17] um brother Melo. God bless you. It's
[29:20] &gt;&gt; been a little bit, but we're happy to
[29:21] see you and your lovely family. And uh
[29:25] just uh uh
[29:29] Oleg, Brother Oleg, Sister Elena, and I
[29:32] don't have a clue to remember the kids'
[29:34] names, but Amen. Just uh ask the Lord
[29:38] just to uh touch you. I look in the back
[29:42] row and I see my my dear dear friend,
[29:45] Brother Manassa and Sister Katie. God
[29:47] bless you. Glad to see you here today,
[29:50] Ethan. Each and every one of you. Just
[29:53] God bless you. And we're so thankful for
[29:56] God's grace. Oh, I've looked right over
[30:01] Sister Alice.
[30:03] You know, she's right at that age. She
[30:05] could be my sister. And uh I I kind of
[30:08] claim her that way. just a special bond
[30:11] that's there. God bless you, Sister
[30:13] Alice, Sister April.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Is it good to be in the house of the
[30:18] Lord today?
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh just want to remember in a
[30:22] couple weeks we'll start Sunday school.
[30:25] Uh time flies so quickly and it's uh
[30:27] catches us offguard. And also we want to
[30:31] definitely remember the dean hearts as
[30:32] they travel uh to to Arizona. Brother
[30:35] David mentioned that. Um, our sister
[30:38] Dorothy, a very special special sister,
[30:41] a lovely lady. Amen. Such a sweet
[30:44] spirit. All the all the years that I
[30:47] have known her, uh, she just always had
[30:50] such an open, welcoming spirit. Uh, she
[30:53] she would often times, hope this isn't
[30:56] too much for some of you, but she would
[30:57] wrap her arm around me and just tell me
[31:00] that she loved me like a son. And, you
[31:03] know,
[31:04] &gt;&gt; just touches your heart. And uh we thank
[31:07] the Lord to have that kind of a a body
[31:10] of believers, that kind of a family to
[31:12] be associated with. Amen. And uh so um
[31:19] as far as this coming weekend here at
[31:20] the church, we have a couple details to
[31:23] work out. Um and um we'll we'll post it
[31:27] on the WhatsApp uh exactly what will be
[31:31] happening. My original plan was to to go
[31:34] camping. Uh but uh my original plan also
[31:38] was that brother David, whether he knew
[31:40] it or not, was going to cover the
[31:43] services here at the church. So we'll
[31:46] figure something out. And u and uh no,
[31:50] no, the Lord knows. He's the one that
[31:52] sets it all in motion. And uh so we we
[31:55] just uh want the Lord's will to be done.
[31:58] Amen. I'd like to speak to you uh on on
[32:02] uh Thank you. Uh, I sure appreciated the
[32:05] song service, the musicians this
[32:07] morning. It was beautiful. Amen. Uh,
[32:13] I want to speak to you this morning on
[32:15] expectations, but um the real title will
[32:19] be keeping our eye on the goal.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; And uh so our expectations often times
[32:25] lead us down the road. They cause us to
[32:28] make decisions. We look into the future.
[32:31] But many a person in their life has
[32:34] started out. Now you can look this up
[32:37] and I don't mean to depress anyone here
[32:39] this morning. It's just a fact of life
[32:42] that when they take the goals of an 18y
[32:45] old
[32:47] and 40 years goes by. They're now 58
[32:51] years old.
[32:54] The percentage of those who actually
[32:56] fulfilled their plan for their life
[33:00] is minuscule.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Most people end up
[33:06] totally derailed from what they thought
[33:09] they would be
[33:10] &gt;&gt; and where they would be when they were
[33:13] 18.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; And that is just the nature we might say
[33:17] of life. It's not an individual failure.
[33:19] It's not an issue with that person. It
[33:23] is life. There's all kinds of things we
[33:26] don't even know tomorrow. We we don't
[33:29] even know this afternoon for certain.
[33:32] And and uh so we see these things and
[33:34] how that life changes. And uh some of
[33:37] those will be bad decisions. Some of
[33:40] those will be good decisions that we
[33:42] never ever considered
[33:45] because we don't have a crystal ball.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; But we have the word.
[33:52] And so when we commit everything to the
[33:55] word
[33:56] &gt;&gt; and let the word come. I I love the song
[33:59] service this morning. It fit to me. It
[34:01] fit so perfect.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we commit it to the word, we
[34:05] will find that our plan, our footsteps,
[34:10] everything will be perfect.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Now our idea of perfect
[34:15] &gt;&gt; and God's idea of perfect
[34:18] &gt;&gt; two different ideas. That's why the
[34:20] apostle Paul told us we must find the
[34:24] mind of Christ.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Because if we go in our mind, we will
[34:29] say this is what is best for me.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; And we're looking at it in very short
[34:34] term. We're looking at it emotionally.
[34:36] We're looking at it. We think good
[34:39] because we're looking at it
[34:40] analytically.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; But you see, analytics and life don't
[34:44] always go together.
[34:46] And uh so as we look at this, I just
[34:49] want to speak to you this morning on
[34:50] keeping our eye on the goal. And you
[34:53] notice I didn't say keeping your eye on
[34:56] the goal because this includes every one
[34:58] of us. Amen. It's not just a preacher
[35:01] preaching to you, but it's every one of
[35:03] us.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; We must keep our eye on the goal. Turn
[35:07] in your Bibles if you would this
[35:08] morning. Once again, I say it's so good
[35:11] to be here in the house of God to see
[35:13] each and every one of you. and um
[35:17] Romans the 8th chapter 14-19.
[35:21] Now my whole thought that I had I
[35:24] struggled this morning uh to not just
[35:27] read uh uh Romans 7 and Romans 8 and
[35:31] Romans 9, but that's a little bit too
[35:33] much scripture just to read in one time.
[35:37] So I narrowed it down. Just had to give
[35:39] some thought to it and felt led of the
[35:40] Lord just to narrow it down to these
[35:42] verses.
[35:44] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[35:47] God, they are the sons of God.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it takes a son of God, son
[35:54] and daughter of God to even hear the
[35:56] voice.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; You see, if if God's not in you, you you
[36:01] you don't even hear the voice. It's it's
[36:03] just it's just something out there that
[36:06] you just say, "I don't I don't get it.
[36:08] Why are they like they are?" But when
[36:10] you are a son or daughter of God,
[36:13] &gt;&gt; that voice says, "Stop, you stop."
[36:15] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; It says, "Turn right, you turn right.
[36:18] Turn left, you turn left. Pray, you
[36:21] pray."
[36:21] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; And so there's where it is the
[36:25] leadership.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; For you have not received the spirit of
[36:30] bondage. Again, means that we've been
[36:33] delivered once.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; To fear. But you have received the
[36:37] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
[36:40] "Aba, father, my father, my father." The
[36:44] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[36:46] spirit that we are the children of God.
[36:49] And if children, then heirs. Who's an
[36:52] heir of God today? Amen. We are we are
[36:55] Bible believing, Bible reading, Holy
[36:58] Spirit-led people. Amen. And that means
[37:01] we are heirs. We are not here just
[37:03] blindly walking. God didn't say, "I want
[37:05] you to walk your whole days of your life
[37:07] and I'm going to get up there." And this
[37:09] has a little bit of a story that goes
[37:11] with it. Maybe I'll share it in a
[37:12] minute. But you look at this, my brother
[37:14] and sister. God's not bringing us to a
[37:16] place to say you failed.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; No, that's right.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; This is not about bringing us
[37:21] &gt;&gt; to a point to say failure.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; This is a point to bring us to say well
[37:26] done.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're joint hes with Christ if so
[37:31] be that we suffer with him that we may
[37:32] also be glorified together. For I reckon
[37:35] that the sufferings of this present
[37:37] time, actually 18 and 19 are my focus
[37:40] scriptures here. For I reckon that the
[37:42] sufferings of this present time are not
[37:44] worthy to even be compared with the
[37:47] glory which shall be revealed in us. For
[37:50] the earnest expectation of the creature,
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; And creature here is creation.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:57] waitth the manifestation of the sons of
[37:59] God. Heavenly Father, we ask for your
[38:01] blessings upon the word. Bless the
[38:03] saints, I pray today in your name. Amen.
[38:06] You may be seated. Now, as we look at
[38:08] this, my brother and sister, we'll see
[38:10] here in the scripture that to be an heir
[38:14] is not just uh not maybe always what we
[38:17] think it is. You say, "Well, I I um I I
[38:20] I I'm I've got a rich father, natural,
[38:23] rich mother, natural. uh you know they
[38:26] give me everything I want. If not
[38:28] careful, what you'll end up with is a
[38:30] lot of things you didn't want. And so
[38:33] it's there that always having that kind
[38:35] of an inheritance is not really a
[38:38] blessing. Amen. There's many a rich
[38:40] child turned into I knew a couple in my
[38:43] youth. One of them killed himself in a
[38:45] his daddy bought him a Corvette for a
[38:47] 16th birthday. And uh he lasted one week
[38:51] in that car and killed himself. And uh
[38:53] so you see that was not a blessing to be
[38:56] 16 years old and your dad buys you a
[38:58] brand new Corvette. So it was there that
[39:00] that that was actually a tremendous
[39:03] mistake. Uh every every child probably
[39:06] should start off with something that has
[39:08] a speed limiter. Uh but uh even then it
[39:11] don't make you a tentative. And so as it
[39:14] is you look at these things but we are
[39:16] here and the word of God is telling us
[39:19] that we are the children of God. And if
[39:23] we're children, we are heirs.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; It isn't conditional. Right now, we
[39:28] understand what this scripture says, but
[39:30] we're talking in this positive context
[39:32] that if we are children, if we've come
[39:35] to the place our identity is in Jesus
[39:38] Christ, then we are heirs. And I say we
[39:41] ought to act like heirs. Amen. We ought
[39:42] to act like our father owns the cattle
[39:44] on a thousand hills. In fact, he owns
[39:46] the hills and much more. And it's there
[39:49] that it's time for us to not have this
[39:51] uh you know kind of a downtrodden
[39:54] mentality of our approach to serving
[39:56] God. Now that doesn't make that you rich
[39:59] naturally. I hope you understand that
[40:01] God God didn't say that being
[40:03] spiritually rich equals uh uh yeah
[40:06] spiritually rich equals naturally rich.
[40:08] Amen. That's one thing that the world is
[40:11] pedalling that if God loves you, you'll
[40:12] be rich. Well, I'll tell you what about
[40:14] the people in the middle of these other
[40:16] continents or even maybe here in the
[40:18] United States that are not rich, but
[40:20] they are spiritually rich. Now, who do
[40:23] we want to have an inheritance with?
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. The rich man who goes to hell,
[40:29] Amen. and begs for his finger to be
[40:32] dipped in the water to come and quench
[40:34] his thirst. Or the one who's laying in
[40:37] the very bosom of Abraham. Amen. And it
[40:39] all depends on which side of this
[40:41] inheritance you want to be in the
[40:44] reading
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; of the will.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love just going to
[40:49] things like the reading of the will? I
[40:51] go, Lord willing, twice a week for the
[40:54] reading of the will. Amen. And I get to
[40:57] sit there and hear what my father has
[40:59] given me. Amen. And when I hear what
[41:02] he's given me, Amen. It's up to me now
[41:05] to decide what I will do with what he
[41:08] has given me.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; And so as we look at this the sufferings
[41:12] of this present time, anybody here
[41:14] suffering? Amen. Let's face the reality
[41:17] of it in the natural and things of life.
[41:20] There are burdens that you bear. There
[41:22] are things as ministers sometimes you
[41:25] don't sleep at night because your heart
[41:27] is so burdened for those around you that
[41:30] that all you can think about all night
[41:32] long is Lord help them Lord touch them
[41:36] Lord lift them up. And you see my
[41:38] brother and sister those prayers don't
[41:40] go unheard.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those prayers come before the
[41:44] throne. I know many of you, the prayer
[41:46] warriors in our midst, you deal with the
[41:49] same things that your heart is burdened
[41:51] and you are reaching out because we are
[41:54] not here just for our own accord to to
[41:57] go and breathe as it were through this
[42:00] life and move on. But Lord, help us to
[42:03] touch those around us. Amen. And you
[42:06] know the the whole thing of the
[42:08] suffering of this present time, it
[42:11] sometimes is mental or emotional. It can
[42:13] be physical. There a lot of aspects
[42:16] about this. It might be spiritually. You
[42:18] might be down in the valley, my brother
[42:21] and sister, but you'll never appreciate
[42:22] the mountaintop till you have dwelt in
[42:25] the valley. And when you dwell in the
[42:27] valley long enough and find deliverance
[42:30] on the mountaintop, you don't look down
[42:32] at those in the valley and say, "Oh,
[42:35] those poor sods."
[42:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; You look down there and say, "Lord, you
[42:39] delivered me. Lord, you helped me. Lord,
[42:41] you come in the power of your word, your
[42:44] Holy Spirit, and delivered me. And it
[42:46] causes you to have an overwhelming sense
[42:48] of compassion for that individual. Amen.
[42:51] It doesn't matter if I'm an old man and
[42:53] I'm looking at teenagers. Amen. I was a
[42:56] teenager once that lost my way.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; I have compassion. Yes,
[43:02] &gt;&gt; sir.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; I've been the middle-aged man that was
[43:04] lost in my way. And God had compassion
[43:07] upon me. And I look and I see compassion
[43:10] to people. I have compassion to people.
[43:14] And here in my older days, Amen. I start
[43:18] to to deal with things in a different
[43:21] fashion, you might say. And we don't
[43:23] want to get too far off on that. But you
[43:26] you deal with things in a different way.
[43:28] And the scripture speaks of the groaning
[43:30] of the spirit. Amen. And we'll find
[43:33] ourselves as we become mature in Jesus
[43:35] Christ, we do a lot of groaning in our
[43:38] spirit. Amen. We're we're often times
[43:40] find oursel we're perfectly healthy.
[43:42] We're well fed. We're well-dressed.
[43:44] Everything's good around us. Our
[43:46] environment, you might say, is good, but
[43:49] we find ourselves groaning.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Our brother David preached, brother
[43:53] David Nash preached this last Wednesday.
[43:55] My brother and sister, it was wonderful.
[43:57] you get opportunity, go listen to it
[43:59] because he was talking about atmosphere,
[44:02] my brother and sister. And you get in
[44:04] the right atmosphere, you will find
[44:06] yourself groaning for those around you.
[44:09] When you don't have that atmosphere,
[44:11] you'll say, "Well, too bad for them."
[44:14] But in the right atmosphere, you look at
[44:16] every single individual that your life
[44:18] touches and say, "Lord, I wish, I pray,
[44:21] I long for you to come and touch their
[44:24] life."
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] Now you look at this uh the earnest
[44:30] expectation of the creature we know and
[44:33] understand of the scripture that is
[44:35] creation. And realize my brother and
[44:38] sister that creation itself is groaning
[44:41] as the word said it would be in this
[44:43] hour. It is groaning because believe it
[44:46] or not creation knows what it was like
[44:49] before the fall.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; We say does it have a voice? Does it
[44:53] have comprehension? Does it have
[44:54] understanding? Tell me why the tree
[44:57] takes a sap to the root.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; There's an understanding there that we
[45:01] as humans do not understand, cannot
[45:04] explain. And all nature, all creation is
[45:08] groaning to go back to the beginning
[45:11] just as you are.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word is coming in such a
[45:15] fashion, my brother and sister. Who
[45:17] would have thought that an earthquake in
[45:19] uh Russia would cause uh uh volcanoes to
[45:23] start bubbling up?
[45:25] Hundreds and hundreds of years since
[45:28] there was any activity there. But the
[45:31] earth itself is breaking apart and
[45:33] groaning for a deliverance. I want
[45:35] delivered also. I want a purifying fire
[45:40] to come over me also. I want the word to
[45:43] be manifested in me also. I want the
[45:47] very life that's in the scripture to
[45:49] come out of me also.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Because you see, even creation has
[45:59] expectation of a new birth.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavens and earth shall pass away.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister, this earth
[46:07] once it has been cleansed. Now, I just I
[46:10] have it here not to get lost in trying
[46:12] to look up the references, but uh if you
[46:14] haven't read uh Daniel, 70 weeks of
[46:17] Daniel in the last while, I encourage
[46:19] you to pick it up and read it because
[46:21] it's incredible because you see the
[46:23] earth, my brother and sister, is going
[46:25] to be prepared for a bride and her
[46:29] husband for the millennial reign. Amen.
[46:32] And when the earth is prepared for that,
[46:35] the bride is going to walk out on the
[46:38] ashes, my brother and sister, of
[46:40] purification.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be we're saying, "I'm
[46:44] walking on the wicked. Oh, I'm not the
[46:45] wicked." It No, no, we're going to look
[46:48] at this and understand how it was that
[46:51] when the sacrifice was offered and when
[46:54] it was done, they didn't take the ashes
[46:56] of the burnt sacrifice and toss it to
[46:58] the wind. My brother and sister, God
[47:00] even gave them an ordinance on how to
[47:04] deal with the ashes of the sacrifice.
[47:07] And when we walk out on this new earth,
[47:10] amen, after its cleansing, amen, we'll
[47:13] be walking out, and you can say it's
[47:15] symbolic. Go ahead, take it symbolic.
[47:17] But you're going to be walking out in a
[47:19] pure world.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're going to walk out there
[47:22] with a pure word in you, in a pure
[47:25] world, in the presence of a pure and
[47:27] holy God. Amen. I'm telling you, it's
[47:30] not just some little symbolism story,
[47:32] but it's the whole plan of redemption
[47:34] coming forth that God is bringing this
[47:36] out and it will touch every corner
[47:39] aspect of our lives. Let's receive it.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Let's receive it. Lord, purify me today.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; As we look in Isaiah 65 and17
[47:52] to start down through those verses.
[47:56] For behold, I create a new heavens and a
[47:58] new earth, and the former shall not be
[48:01] remembered nor come to mind. Isn't that
[48:03] nice?
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. that a lot of things that we
[48:06] struggle with in our own memories today,
[48:08] little issues that we had at one time,
[48:11] little besetting sins that we still have
[48:13] to physically and spiritually guard
[48:16] oursel every day.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "But but we're we're we're
[48:20] filled with the Holy Ghost. We're we're
[48:22] we're Christians."
[48:24] No, my brother and sisters, sometimes
[48:26] the very protection
[48:28] that God has given us is like a soldier
[48:31] going to the armory
[48:34] and he has to reach over there and he
[48:35] has to take that shield.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; He can't just walk out on the
[48:39] battlefield and say, "Praise God, I've
[48:41] got a shield back there."
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; God expected him to walk in there, take
[48:47] that shield. Amen. Put on the whole
[48:50] armor. Amen. and grab his sword or his
[48:53] spear to defend himself. Amen. And it
[48:56] was expected that a soldier wouldn't go
[48:59] to the battlefield and say, "Um, can I
[49:00] borrow your shield?"
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Um, I'm out here and I know I know some
[49:06] of you wear these, so I don't mean to be
[49:08] insulting, but anybody who goes to the
[49:11] battle in flipflops
[49:13] deserves a stub toe.
[49:18] See, God wants us to be shaw in the
[49:21] gospel.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Preparation. Yes. Everything has been
[49:25] given. And if we go out without it,
[49:28] that's our fault.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Don't blame God for failure in your life
[49:32] if you will not prepare yourself to go
[49:35] to battle.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And so, as we'll see that God is
[49:38] preparing us to be able to stand in this
[49:41] hour by the word.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not going to come to
[49:45] church with a, you know, big massive
[49:47] boots and uh a leg and shield and chest
[49:51] deal, all this stuff and and go
[49:53] clunking. Imagine what church would be
[49:55] like. Will we all rise,
[49:59] sit down, stand again, please? I can
[50:02] only do it twice.
[50:04] No. No. That's not what God's song
[50:05] about. We come and this is why we come
[50:08] to the house of God prepared is we put
[50:10] the armor on before we even leave the
[50:13] house
[50:15] &gt;&gt; we put the armor on.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; But be you glad and rejoice forever in
[50:22] that which I created. For behold, I
[50:24] create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her
[50:27] people a joy. Now, there's plenty of
[50:30] scripture that shows you how that
[50:33] sorrow,
[50:35] famine,
[50:36] unspeakable,
[50:38] the history of Jerusalem,
[50:41] even come to a time of cannibalism
[50:45] and great pain. But God's speaking now
[50:49] natural, but he's speaking spiritual.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me declare to you this
[50:55] morning, if you're in famine spiritually
[50:58] this morning, you can reach out to the
[51:02] Lord this morning and declare your
[51:05] famine is finished.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; I don't need to be in a famine. God has
[51:11] promised everything that I need. Amen.
[51:14] He's already given it to me. And so,
[51:17] what I have to do is receive that.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the voice of weeping shall be
[51:23] heard in her uh nor the voice of crying.
[51:27] There shall be no more thence an infant
[51:29] of days, nor an old man that hath not
[51:31] filled his days. For the child shall die
[51:35] a hundred years old, but the sinner
[51:37] being a hundred years old shall be a
[51:39] cursed.
[51:41] Think about that.
[51:43] Lord's promising here to give time and
[51:46] we get to be blessed
[51:49] or cursed in the same days.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Look at the difference of what those
[51:56] days yield.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; A 20 year old filled with the Holy Ghost
[52:01] or a 20 year old filled with a life
[52:03] sentence.
[52:06] See what we've got? This whole issue
[52:09] that took place in North Idaho.
[52:12] How sad. How sad, my brother and sister.
[52:15] All because one becomes obsessed,
[52:18] possessed with a spirit anointed.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And at the same time, there'll be
[52:27] someone the same age
[52:30] circumstances
[52:32] &gt;&gt; will walk away
[52:34] and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; What's our choice today?
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. I want to walk out of
[52:40] here fuller than I've ever been in my
[52:42] life.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; I want to walk out of here with more of
[52:45] Jesus Christ in my heart than I have
[52:47] ever had in my life before.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; And it's within my power.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; And they shall build houses and inhabit
[52:58] them, and they shall plant vineyards and
[53:00] eat the fruit of them. They shall not
[53:02] build and another inhabit. They shall
[53:04] not plant and another eat. For as the
[53:06] days of a tree are the days of my
[53:09] people, and mine elect shall uh long
[53:12] enjoy the work of their hands. Now, is
[53:15] this talking about our physical labors?
[53:19] No, it's talking about the work of your
[53:22] hands as a son or daughter of God as
[53:25] children of God, your inheritance.
[53:28] Amen. Let me tell you kind of a paradox.
[53:34] You pray through and God blesses you.
[53:37] Can someone say amen to that?
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; You pray through and you pray for me.
[53:43] God blesses you, but he also blesses me.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; See, now you talk about the original
[53:51] pyramid.
[53:53] And I leave the word scheme off there
[53:55] because this is not a scheme. But the
[53:57] original pyramid shows you how that one
[54:00] person can affect so many. That's right.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because as your prayers, I'm just
[54:07] using myself for an example. As your
[54:08] prayers for me affect me, then it causes
[54:11] me to pray for others and it affects
[54:14] them and pretty soon it just keeps
[54:17] expanding out until we'll talk about
[54:19] right here confined in this body of
[54:21] believers that we have a church that is
[54:23] blessed. We have a church that there's
[54:25] no animosities, no undercurrents, no
[54:28] things that undermine or hinder the
[54:30] spirit of God. And it can start with
[54:32] just one person. Who would be that
[54:34] person that would say, "Lord, start with
[54:36] me. Start a revival with me today, Lord.
[54:39] That I can affect the one beside me."
[54:41] Maybe it's a husband or a wife. Maybe
[54:43] it'll be my own children. Maybe we sit
[54:46] back and become paralyzed and say,
[54:48] "Well, I all the circumstances just
[54:50] seems like it's stacked against my
[54:52] children." Unstack it.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go to prayer. Move it. It'll move
[54:58] mountains. You can move that and let it
[55:01] be brought in the condition that God
[55:03] wants it to be. You don't like the
[55:04] direction your children are going, don't
[55:06] cry about it. Don't whine about it. Pray
[55:09] that God would come and shift it.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And my God's more powerful than
[55:14] any circumstance on this earth today.
[55:17] Amen. You want it shifted, then get
[55:19] down, get serious, get desperate, and
[55:21] shift it.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll get down here. I'm
[55:29] getting off my track. Verse 24. And it
[55:32] shall come to pass that before they
[55:34] call. This is how much God wants to be
[55:36] in tune with you.
[55:39] Before they call,
[55:42] I will answer.
[55:45] We often talk and it seems like, you
[55:47] know, maybe you think the preacher is
[55:48] just using an analogy, but I tell you, I
[55:51] have a little circumstance that's been
[55:53] bothering me quite a bit.
[55:56] And uh I wasn't even thinking about this
[56:00] circumstance at that time and it just
[56:02] happens to be right here in this 70
[56:04] weeks of Daniel
[56:07] and I've been reading it.
[56:10] My mind is somewhere else
[56:13] and I come across
[56:15] the answer.
[56:19] You see,
[56:21] sometimes before you get to the point,
[56:23] you'll even ask God, "Okay, I got to
[56:24] have an answer for this."
[56:26] &gt;&gt; God said, "I already heard the question
[56:28] you never voiced."
[56:31] &gt;&gt; I've already sent the answer on the way.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Now, you want to think about something
[56:38] coming in advance. You say, "But this is
[56:39] just somebody's writings. This is
[56:41] somebody's preaching, somebody's
[56:42] teaching." Well, let me put it to you
[56:44] this way. I'm not sure exactly what year
[56:47] 70 weeks of Daniel was.
[56:50] Do you know, brother David? 1961.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; You'll like this. August of 1961.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; About five months before I was even
[57:03] born,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; God sent the answer.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Tell me God's not an ontime God.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. tell me he doesn't know
[57:13] exactly where we're coming to in our
[57:15] life. And if that is too far out, then
[57:18] just go back to the word of God. How
[57:20] many times have you picked up your
[57:21] Bible, started reading, and God's given
[57:23] you an answer from the scripture?
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe that would be a little more
[57:28] convincing to you that God really does
[57:31] care, that he does have the answer for
[57:33] you. Now, look at this. This will be a
[57:35] beautiful world. And sometimes we see
[57:38] evidence of this in this natural life.
[57:40] It says, "The wolf and the lamb shall
[57:42] feed together, and the lion shall eat
[57:44] straw like the bulock, and the dust
[57:46] shall be the serpent's meat. They shall
[57:48] not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
[57:51] mountain, saith the Lord." Now, I saw a
[57:53] little video clip the other day of
[57:55] people who saved a a leopard cub in
[57:58] Africa when it was little. Its mother
[58:00] died in a snare, and it was malnutrition
[58:03] to the point that they literally
[58:04] thought, "We'll just put it out of its
[58:06] misery." But they thought, "We'll take
[58:07] it home. We'll feed it. We'll see what
[58:09] happens." Now, leopards, if you guys are
[58:11] very familiar with Africa, you will
[58:13] understand that a lion is fierce, but
[58:16] there's a nature in a lion that that is
[58:19] seemingly tameable.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; You don't see too many leopards in the
[58:24] circus.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; No, that's right.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz a leopard would be sitting there in
[58:27] the circus thinking, who am I going to
[58:29] tear apart next?
[58:31] But you see, even then we see the little
[58:34] glimpses of what God is doing, of how
[58:37] someone has compassion and they raise it
[58:40] up and it comes back to visit them every
[58:44] once in a while. It brings its cubs back
[58:47] and shows them off to them every once in
[58:49] a while. The cubs are tolerant while the
[58:52] mother is downright friendly. The cubs
[58:56] are not so, you know, you're not going
[58:57] to pet me,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; but they'll stand on their porch and
[59:00] look at them and purr and whatever. Now,
[59:03] my brother and sister, you see, even the
[59:05] fall of the garden didn't take away
[59:07] every one of these heavenly attributes
[59:09] that's here.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Satan would like us to believe that this
[59:15] world is just entirely evil, that
[59:17] there's no need to serve him, just give
[59:19] up, you know, surrender. But I'm telling
[59:21] you my brother and sister, heavenly
[59:23] attributes are everywhere.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; We just have to have the eyes to see it.
[59:29] Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; And so sometimes it is what is your
[59:33] expectation.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; You come to the house of God today.
[59:36] We've heard it preached for years.
[59:37] You'll get what you expect when you come
[59:39] to the house of God. And I believe that
[59:41] with all of my heart, but let's take it
[59:43] beyond the house of God today. What's
[59:45] the expectation of your life? What is
[59:47] the expectation of the final chapter of
[59:50] your life? The final paragraph of your
[59:53] life? What's your expectation? Is it my
[59:56] brother and sister? Is it a life of of
[59:58] somewhat success, somewhat happiness,
[1:00:00] somewhat this, somewhat that? Or are you
[1:00:02] going to come and stand on the word and
[1:00:04] say, "You know what? My God never did a
[1:00:06] halfway project. He never did a halfway
[1:00:08] deliverance. Never did a halfway
[1:00:10] healing. Never did a halfway peace. He
[1:00:13] comes and he gives everything that we
[1:00:16] need in this life has already been given
[1:00:19] to us. Now you say, "But I prayed for
[1:00:21] peace and I didn't give it." Well, why
[1:00:23] don't you stop before you get
[1:00:24] discouraged and go back through your
[1:00:26] life? Maybe there's something that you
[1:00:28] need to deal with and God's trying to
[1:00:30] catch your attention. Go back and deal
[1:00:32] with this because peace is right here.
[1:00:34] Deliverance is right here. The Holy
[1:00:36] Ghost is right here. But you got to have
[1:00:39] a clean house
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; when you go in this scripture. I didn't
[1:00:42] write the scripture down. My brain is
[1:00:43] failing me now to remember. But my
[1:00:46] brother and sister, there's vessels of
[1:00:47] honor and vessels of dishonor. I'm
[1:00:49] telling you, when I sat down at a table,
[1:00:52] and I have before, and I just grinned
[1:00:54] and bore it, my brother and sister, but
[1:00:56] you know, it's hard to eat off a dirty
[1:00:58] utensil
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; and a dirty plate
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; and drink out of a dirty cup.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Natural.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; And God's not going to fill a halfway
[1:01:12] cleaned vessel.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have some spirit just to be
[1:01:17] wasted to pour into a vessel that they
[1:01:20] don't care enough.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; To clean it entirely.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, it's simple fact.
[1:01:26] I hope I'm not too blunt this morning,
[1:01:28] but if you've got things in your life
[1:01:30] and and God's been dealing with me in my
[1:01:32] own life, some things, you know, you you
[1:01:35] have kind of made yourself think this is
[1:01:37] okay, Paul. But I'm telling you, it's
[1:01:39] not. And you probably heard me speak
[1:01:41] this from this pulpit before that God's
[1:01:43] dealing with me to clean things up a
[1:01:45] little bit. Let me tell you what it is.
[1:01:47] God doesn't bust the pot because because
[1:01:50] he found a spot on it.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; He takes it and sends it through to be
[1:01:54] washed.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And it comes out, it still has a spot on
[1:01:57] it. God doesn't say, "Throw that one in
[1:01:59] the junk pile." He sends it through and
[1:02:01] he washes it again. And the washing of
[1:02:04] the water of the word is a continual
[1:02:05] process for you and I as sons and
[1:02:08] daughters of God. We don't just go to
[1:02:10] the altar. We don't just give our heart
[1:02:12] to the Lord. We don't just get baptized
[1:02:14] and go off and just live life. Amen. We
[1:02:17] need a continual washing. But don't be
[1:02:20] so judgmental that when you see someone
[1:02:22] with a smudge on their vessel that you
[1:02:25] say, "Oh, I guess they don't get it. I
[1:02:27] guess they're not a Christian. I guess
[1:02:29] they're not filled with Holy Ghost."
[1:02:30] Remember, God was willing to wash you.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give God the option, the
[1:02:36] opportunity to wash them. In fact, go
[1:02:39] back to the pyramid and be one of them
[1:02:41] that implements the washing for them.
[1:02:44] Lord, pray I Lord, lift them up, wash
[1:02:47] them, fill them, Lord. Make them worthy.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not looking to be
[1:02:53] judgmental, my brother and sister. We're
[1:02:55] looking to fulfill the word.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got it.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; You see, even the cosmos, this world
[1:03:04] is looking to see sons and daughters of
[1:03:06] God manifested.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; People will look in the word of God with
[1:03:11] no spiritual understanding and say these
[1:03:14] things have to take place.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; And they are.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Whether they long for that, desire for
[1:03:22] that, sigh and cry for that,
[1:03:26] it's irrelevant. They recognize things
[1:03:29] have to take place.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; I love how that was brought up in a
[1:03:33] service here the other day. They're
[1:03:35] talking about a chunk of California when
[1:03:38] those plates do their thing and they've
[1:03:42] identified the lines,
[1:03:44] the weak places in the in the
[1:03:46] continental plates.
[1:03:49] And
[1:03:51] strangely enough, the math adds up to
[1:03:54] what a prophet said
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; will fall in the ocean.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:04:02] That was a good guess on his part,
[1:04:04] wasn't it?
[1:04:07] Man, I wished I could guess that good.
[1:04:10] God doesn't guess, my brother and
[1:04:12] sister.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; God knows what's going to happen. and he
[1:04:16] wrote the book and he's put every power
[1:04:19] in place and every bit of authority to
[1:04:22] bring it to pass is already put in
[1:04:24] place. God's not waiting. When this
[1:04:26] happens, I'll see if I can make this
[1:04:28] happen. No, he's already set it in
[1:04:31] motion. And when it comes, my brother
[1:04:34] and sister, it's on this time to fulfill
[1:04:37] the word in this place and this will
[1:04:39] happen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother and sister, I'll just
[1:04:43] share a little bit. I'll share a little
[1:04:45] bit a couple little things here if you
[1:04:47] don't mind real quick.
[1:04:49] I decided to discard the early one I I
[1:04:52] commented about because it's just stupid
[1:04:54] humor. But I'm telling you a brother and
[1:04:57] sister, young couple. She was pregnant I
[1:05:00] think like eight months with their first
[1:05:02] child
[1:05:04] didn't really have a house of their own.
[1:05:06] This is in Chile
[1:05:08] and they're housesitting.
[1:05:10] And so it was a welcome reprieve from
[1:05:12] living I don't remember which parents
[1:05:14] home that they lived in but you know
[1:05:16] here they are married couple can't
[1:05:18] afford a house and uh somebody says
[1:05:20] we're going to be gone for a while would
[1:05:22] you stay in our house and take care of
[1:05:24] it and they're happy man we it's almost
[1:05:27] like it's our house and wakes up in the
[1:05:31] middle of the night
[1:05:36] and something something speaks to him
[1:05:39] says
[1:05:41] get up,
[1:05:43] flee to the mountain.
[1:05:47] And he's like, "My mind's playing tricks
[1:05:50] on me."
[1:05:51] Falls back asleep.
[1:05:53] Wakes up.
[1:05:56] Flee for your life.
[1:05:58] When it happens the third time, he wakes
[1:06:00] his wife up and says, "Honey, this isn't
[1:06:02] just my brain." He gets her. Now, here
[1:06:06] she is. Now, pardon me for putting it
[1:06:08] this way, but she's barefoot and
[1:06:10] pregnant,
[1:06:12] has a house coat on in the middle of the
[1:06:15] night, silence in the streets, and he
[1:06:18] starts her walking up the road in the
[1:06:23] city.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And that city is very stair stairstepped
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; going up and they'd have to stop. She's
[1:06:29] like, I can't go any further.
[1:06:33] Go a little further. I got to stop. They
[1:06:36] finally get up
[1:06:38] and about that time the tsunami warning
[1:06:40] goes off in their city
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; and the house
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; that they were staying in no longer
[1:06:48] existed.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:06:53] Do we serve a supernatural God or not?
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; I don't live in Chile. We're not going
[1:06:59] to have a tsunami in Idaho, but the same
[1:07:02] God is here wanting to lead you.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Wanting to speak to you.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Will we listen?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Will we listen? In fact, I forget the
[1:07:14] name of that town, but you can find it
[1:07:15] by googling ship in the middle of the
[1:07:17] city. Um,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; was it constitutional?
[1:07:26] That tsunami wave was so large it parked
[1:07:29] a full-size freighter,
[1:07:32] not through the buildings to end up
[1:07:34] there over the top of them. And then the
[1:07:36] ship ended up sitting in the middle of
[1:07:38] the city. Now my brother and sister, God
[1:07:42] knew that she was a daughter of God and
[1:07:45] that baby would be a son of God.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; And this was her son, his son, I mean,
[1:07:53] that's there as a husband. And he says,
[1:07:56] "I'm gonna save your life. I'm gonna
[1:07:59] guide you, lead you, and guide you."
[1:08:02] Wakes him up. Not a sound in the city.
[1:08:04] All quiet. Now, there's never a quiet
[1:08:06] city in Chile because there's a few
[1:08:09] thousand dogs in that city.
[1:08:12] But my brother and sister, God knows how
[1:08:14] to speak to us. I just give that to a
[1:08:17] little example to you to realize that
[1:08:19] what God is doing for them or did you
[1:08:22] might say past tense he's doing for you.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; And can we lift a hand and say it's past
[1:08:27] tense for me? God is leading me. God has
[1:08:30] led me. He's taking me through the
[1:08:32] battle, through the fire, through the
[1:08:34] flood. He's taking me to the place where
[1:08:37] I need to be.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[1:08:43] So even the cosmos is looking for this
[1:08:46] to be manifested
[1:08:49] to fulfill God's calling in their life.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; You know, it's something that really
[1:08:57] bothers me.
[1:09:00] I see way too many believers falling
[1:09:02] into a pattern. Christians, too many
[1:09:04] Christians.
[1:09:06] Whatever will be will be
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:09:12] Okay. So, if the mountain's going to
[1:09:14] move, it's just going to move on its
[1:09:15] own.
[1:09:20] Jesus said, "You speak to the mountain."
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; There's some action required on our part
[1:09:26] as believers to speak to the mountain.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. How how hard is that, my brother
[1:09:32] and sister? But if you don't have faith
[1:09:34] enough to even believe as it were for a
[1:09:36] toothache, then you're going to have a
[1:09:38] hard time thinking you're going to speak
[1:09:40] to a mountain and it's going to move.
[1:09:41] Now that m mountain might be in your
[1:09:44] heart, might be in your mind, it might
[1:09:46] be a literal circumstance out here or
[1:09:48] could be a literal mountain. But if you
[1:09:50] would not doubt, amen, would not
[1:09:53] question, would have faith and you speak
[1:09:56] to these circumstances, they will
[1:09:58] change. But if we sit back and say,
[1:10:01] "Well, you know, God's so in control.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Whatever will be will be.
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; No need to read our Bible cuz whatever
[1:10:13] will be will be. No need to pray cuz
[1:10:17] whatever will be will be.
[1:10:22] No need to leave your house,
[1:10:25] but we'd starve after a while." No. No.
[1:10:28] God will probably send a crow to you.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; If you believe whatever will be will be.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; My Bible says you don't work, you don't
[1:10:40] eat.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; And that doesn't count for you guys that
[1:10:44] sit at home on a computer. And that's
[1:10:46] that's
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; but you see my brother and sister, what
[1:10:51] God is doing is he's training up a
[1:10:53] people
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; that can take the word of God and say
[1:10:56] this is where I apply this. This is
[1:11:00] where I take this and this is what I put
[1:11:03] in place for my life here. Amen. And you
[1:11:06] know what happens? What Satan is doing?
[1:11:08] Uh he he is coming and he's trying to
[1:11:12] get our focus. You say, "Brother Paul,
[1:11:14] it's such a stressful world
[1:11:17] to make a living, to work, to do. It's
[1:11:19] so stressful.
[1:11:21] No matter how much stress you have in
[1:11:23] your life, now I'm I'm talking to you
[1:11:24] now as your friend, your brother. I
[1:11:27] don't care how much stress you have in
[1:11:29] your life, you have no excuse to take
[1:11:32] your eyes off the goal."
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Your world in the natural can be
[1:11:38] crumbling around you.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Financially, you can have troubles.
[1:11:42] health. You can have troubles, workplace
[1:11:45] troubles, everything. And that is no
[1:11:47] reason for us to take our eyes off the
[1:11:50] goal.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; That is Satan injecting himself into the
[1:11:54] life of a son or daughter of God. That
[1:11:57] if he can get us to start looking at
[1:11:58] what our situation is, well, because of
[1:12:02] this, I can't do this. Tell me where the
[1:12:05] word will back that up. The word says,
[1:12:08] because of that, you will do this
[1:12:10] anyhow. Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You will take the word anyhow and
[1:12:16] hold on to that word anyhow. We've never
[1:12:19] seen rain. I'm getting in the ark
[1:12:22] anyhow.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I don't know that I've ever seen
[1:12:27] a real evidence of the Holy Ghost, but
[1:12:30] I'm a believer. I'll pursue the Holy
[1:12:32] Ghost anyhow.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; So fatalistic.
[1:12:41] Got it.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; So fatalistic.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; It's just going to happen whether I have
[1:12:47] any input or not.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you my brother and sister,
[1:12:52] footsteps are possession.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Is that not the scripture?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Just stand there and see how much of it
[1:12:58] you possess.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; It didn't say when you have an
[1:13:03] incredible earthshaking revelation,
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; take a step.
[1:13:09] Only
[1:13:11] believe.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; And take the next step.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Only believe
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; and take the next step.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Only believe. Take the next step.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; There was two men once
[1:13:30] on a very hard journey.
[1:13:35] And as they're going along, the one man
[1:13:37] acknowledged there is a God. the other
[1:13:38] man was a Christian. And every time they
[1:13:41] would come to a difficult situation,
[1:13:46] the Christian would cry out and say,
[1:13:47] "Lord, I can't go no further. You I need
[1:13:50] you. Help me, Lord. Help me. Come on the
[1:13:52] scene." After a while, the other man got
[1:13:54] tired of hearing it
[1:13:56] and says, "Look, are you trying to
[1:13:58] convince you or me?"
[1:14:03] And he says, "Well,
[1:14:05] both."
[1:14:07] Because you see, I know it's true. I'm
[1:14:10] just reminding myself.
[1:14:12] And if it changes you, so much the
[1:14:15] better. At the end of their journey, the
[1:14:18] one man says,
[1:14:21] "I'm convinced."
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Now, it seems so worth un you know,
[1:14:27] unworthile.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; You know, keep your prayers to yourself.
[1:14:30] I'm not a Christian or I I don't.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Okay, fine. But if God anoints you,
[1:14:37] Lord, help us.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. Lord, help us. Maybe you
[1:14:43] are convincing you and them.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; How many times do you guys ever talk to
[1:14:49] yourselves?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, it's kind of funny. You
[1:14:54] know, I I knew a guy years ago, really,
[1:14:56] really smart guy. He would always say,
[1:14:57] you know, it's no problem to talk to
[1:14:59] yourself. Get concerned when you start
[1:15:02] answering back.
[1:15:04] But you know what? We need to answer
[1:15:06] back.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Paul, do you believe? Lord, yes, I do
[1:15:10] believe.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Is this the word? Paul says, "This is
[1:15:14] the word."
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you need to speak that because
[1:15:19] it will change your perspective. Let me
[1:15:21] just share interject just a little bit.
[1:15:23] when I was, you know, coming back out of
[1:15:25] the world and and struggling, you know,
[1:15:27] here I am, a married man, three
[1:15:29] children, you know, moving forward in a
[1:15:32] a decent business, etc. And and, you
[1:15:34] know, God was dealing with my heart. I
[1:15:37] would go to church and I would sit there
[1:15:39] a clam kind of like some Oh, I'm sorry.
[1:15:41] I didn't mean to insinuate some of you
[1:15:43] were clams, but anyway.
[1:15:46] And I kept thinking, I kept hearing the
[1:15:47] preacher just like I'm kind of poking
[1:15:49] you saying, you know, if you believe it,
[1:15:51] say amen. And I'm like, I expected maybe
[1:15:55] I'd be like, "Amen.
[1:15:59] I'm not going to." Nope. But something
[1:16:01] kept stirring me.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; And you're going to think I'm crazy. And
[1:16:04] you're right.
[1:16:06] I remember one day I literally no one in
[1:16:09] the house walked in and stood in front
[1:16:11] of a mirror,
[1:16:13] looked myself in the eye,
[1:16:17] and said, "Say it, Paul.
[1:16:21] Come on, Paul. You can say it.
[1:16:26] Amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; That didn't hurt.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I can do this. Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] Pretty soon I got some vigor in it.
[1:16:44] Amen. Pretty soon I figured it it's even
[1:16:47] better when when your hands up. Amen.
[1:16:52] Hallelujah.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; But I got to church and it was still,
[1:16:58] whoa, people think.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; And then the next revelation God gave me
[1:17:02] is to stand in front of a mirror and be
[1:17:04] able to look in the mirror and look
[1:17:05] myself in the eyes and say, I don't care
[1:17:08] what they think.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Out in public, I did
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; front of the mirror. I could say it,
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; but I said it till I believed it.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] And when I got to the place I believed
[1:17:22] it doesn't matter what you think.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; After all, I have scripture to back it
[1:17:28] up. It's by the foolishness of
[1:17:31] preaching.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; I'll be a fool for Christ.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; So, we'll stand here and we'll do what
[1:17:39] God calls us to do. So, you know, it's
[1:17:42] quite another position. One to say God's
[1:17:44] going to do what God's going to do. I
[1:17:46] don't need to do anything. But another
[1:17:48] one to stand here and I trust this is
[1:17:49] where you're at this morning is to stand
[1:17:51] here and say I am here this morning and
[1:17:54] I know you are because I can see you. I
[1:17:56] am here this morning to fulfill the word
[1:18:00] of God for my life.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here this morning. I'm
[1:18:05] not here to be seen, to be heard, to do
[1:18:08] anything. It's not a fashion show. It's
[1:18:10] not whatever. Amen. I'm here to fulfill
[1:18:13] what God wants me to fulfill for my
[1:18:16] life.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; That's my one goal.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you must be a fool for Christ,
[1:18:22] then be the best fool ever.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm here to fulfill that calling
[1:18:26] because if you believe you're here by
[1:18:28] accident,
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; I had a friend when we were kids and his
[1:18:33] dad
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; in a joking way would always say, you
[1:18:36] know, you're our accidental child.
[1:18:41] and he grew up and he he adopted that.
[1:18:44] He said, "Yeah, I'm just an accident.
[1:18:49] I'm just an accident. I'm just an
[1:18:52] accident."
[1:18:55] One day he comes.
[1:18:58] Turns out his family changed churches
[1:19:01] and went away from one of those that you
[1:19:03] know had the choir and the whole deal
[1:19:08] and
[1:19:10] went to a church where the preacher spit
[1:19:12] and slobbered and yelled and stomped all
[1:19:16] over the place.
[1:19:18] And he says, "I'm not an accident." And
[1:19:20] it's like, "Really? What? You've said
[1:19:23] you're an accident ever since I first
[1:19:25] met you. Now, our pastor was preaching
[1:19:27] this last Sunday, and he says, "God
[1:19:31] placed me here." That's right.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; For a purpose.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; And if God placed me here for a purpose,
[1:19:38] that can't be an accident.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, are you an accident?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Or are you here for a purpose?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] That's right.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; You know, in the military, never been
[1:19:52] there, but I've studied it.
[1:19:55] If you're ever placed in a post of duty
[1:19:58] and you abandon that post of duty, it's
[1:20:00] called AWOL.
[1:20:02] And there's consequences.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; I'm actually glad that I serve a God
[1:20:06] that is so loving, so kind, and so
[1:20:08] gracious because we'd all be in prison
[1:20:10] for awall.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; See, God's got you here for a reason. He
[1:20:16] wants you to fulfill that word.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not here to sign a book. How
[1:20:20] many sign How many of you have your
[1:20:21] names on the books of Grace Tabernacle?
[1:20:25] If you do, I'd like to know where the
[1:20:27] book is at.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; But I'm here, Lord, at my posted duty
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; to fulfill your will,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; to fulfill your word. That's right.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, my expectation is that
[1:20:40] when God called me, he didn't call me to
[1:20:42] be a slacker and sit around under a palm
[1:20:44] tree drinking lemonade. And while
[1:20:46] everyone else fights, as the song says,
[1:20:48] must I be raised on flowery beds of ease
[1:20:52] while others fight and sail the bloody
[1:20:54] seas? Amen. That's not what it is. Now
[1:20:56] look at it here in Psalm 62 and5. Amen.
[1:21:00] I need to hurry up. Somebody pray that I
[1:21:02] go fast. My soul wait thou only upon
[1:21:05] God, for my expectation is from him.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; He only is my rock and my salvation. He
[1:21:13] is my defense. I shall not be moved. In
[1:21:16] God is my salvation and my glory. The
[1:21:19] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[1:21:23] God.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Trust in him at all times.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; All times
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; some midnight hour
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; if you should find
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; you're in a prison
[1:21:41] in your mind.
[1:21:44] Call 911.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:21:50] call him.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the answer.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Trust in him at all times, you people.
[1:21:58] Pour out your heart before him. God is a
[1:22:02] refuge for us. I love that scripture.
[1:22:05] When I come across that, I thought,
[1:22:06] Lord, that is so beautiful. Amen. Cuz he
[1:22:09] is everything. You realize this covers
[1:22:11] every part of your life right here.
[1:22:13] There's not one aspect of your life that
[1:22:15] is un not covered by Psalm 62. Amen. He
[1:22:19] is your strength, your rock, your
[1:22:20] salvation, your defense. He's kept kept
[1:22:23] you from just getting blown away by the
[1:22:25] cares of life. Amen. I don't want to get
[1:22:28] sidetracked. I love to talk on the cares
[1:22:29] of life because I love to watch your
[1:22:31] reactions
[1:22:34] cuz, you know, it's it's pretty easy,
[1:22:36] you know, talking about cares of life.
[1:22:38] And some people like look around like,
[1:22:40] "Oh, who's got to care?"
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; And others flinch.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; The one is called naive.
[1:22:54] The other one's living in reality
[1:22:55] without deliverance.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's it. That's it.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; So you can be in reality, but you
[1:23:00] actually need deliverance.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:06] See, expectation is not just what the
[1:23:07] Lord will do for you today. Now, I don't
[1:23:10] want to I don't want to sound
[1:23:11] counterculture to what we believe. Come
[1:23:13] to church expecting. Amen. But it's not
[1:23:16] just I'm coming to church today for what
[1:23:18] the Lord can do for me today. Amen. What
[1:23:21] is an investment? Is an investment an in
[1:23:24] immediate return?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; No. Long term.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let our prayers, our expectation
[1:23:31] be longterm. Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't care if I have to climb
[1:23:36] through broken glass, beds of nails,
[1:23:38] whatever it might be. I see the goal and
[1:23:42] I'm going to reach that goal. And what
[1:23:44] today is doesn't matter as long as I
[1:23:47] reach that goal.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. If anything would try to stop me
[1:23:52] short of that goal, I'm going to deny it
[1:23:54] in the name of Jesus Christ and press
[1:23:57] on.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; In Jesus' name, we press on. Amen. So,
[1:24:02] it's not about how you feel today. Well,
[1:24:05] I don't understand what he's saying
[1:24:06] today. Then keep listening and let God
[1:24:09] speak to you and tomorrow he'll give you
[1:24:11] an answer and you press on. Amen. But
[1:24:14] you see, it's not an expectation. It's
[1:24:17] not just today, but it's also your
[1:24:20] vision.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; What will I see tomorrow? Well, I'll
[1:24:24] tell you what we'll see tomorrow. But
[1:24:25] we'll see the same God that was here
[1:24:28] yesterday and the same God that is here
[1:24:31] today will be present with you tomorrow.
[1:24:35] That will be your vision. And when he's
[1:24:36] present with you tomorrow, but tomorrow
[1:24:39] never comes because tomorrow will be
[1:24:41] today
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; and he'll be with you tomorrow.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Keep following my brother and sister.
[1:24:47] It's a nevers stopping, amen,
[1:24:49] neverending, eternal circle that just
[1:24:52] goes on because your day, your tomorrow
[1:24:55] becomes your today and God is there
[1:24:58] today. Amen. So that means that you can
[1:25:00] stand here today and say my tomorrow is
[1:25:04] already covered.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Whatever I need for tomorrow, which will
[1:25:11] be
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; my today
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; already taken care of. Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; How many times have you as people
[1:25:22] financial struggles, whatever the
[1:25:23] struggle might be, relationship
[1:25:25] struggle, emotional struggle, whatever
[1:25:27] it is, and we walk around answering
[1:25:30] questions that have never been asked.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Well, when they say, "Why did you do
[1:25:38] this?" I'm going to tell them, "I did
[1:25:39] this because of this."
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; And if they say this, I'm going to say
[1:25:44] this. And when they act like this, I'm
[1:25:46] going to do this.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; And when they look at me like they look
[1:25:50] at me, I'm going to go.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And if you were out in public like that,
[1:25:54] people would say, "That person's crazy."
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; But we have these conversations
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; with our self
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; of something that's never going to
[1:26:05] happen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; That's it. Exactly. Right. So now you're
[1:26:09] trying to make your tomorrow today and
[1:26:11] let it rule yesterday so that the future
[1:26:14] will be better.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; An impossible scenario.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; God is the God of yesterday.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; He's the God of today.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; He's the God of your tomorrow.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; All things,
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; are under his dominion.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; So why don't you just live today to the
[1:26:34] best you can by the word?
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; That's it. Let your expectation be. I
[1:26:38] will live the word today.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; I will finish this day being able to
[1:26:44] stand before God, maybe in my own
[1:26:46] private quiet room somewhere, whatever
[1:26:49] it might be, and I'll be able to look up
[1:26:51] at my savior and say, "Lord, thank you
[1:26:53] for this day that you blessed me. Thank
[1:26:56] you for your word that carried me
[1:26:57] through today because my expectation was
[1:27:00] that you would help me get through today
[1:27:02] and you've met it and you'll get through
[1:27:04] my tomorrow." Amen. Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And enough tomorrows, you'll be in the
[1:27:09] rapture.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; But the problem is we've turned the
[1:27:12] rapture into a goal.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; You realize the rapture is not a goal.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; It's a relationship.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; It's an atmosphere.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; You step into that atmosphere.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enoch experience that, brother
[1:27:31] David. Enoch would have been sitting
[1:27:33] here in church the other night and he'd
[1:27:36] have shouted the roof off. He said,
[1:27:38] "That's exactly what happened there. I'm
[1:27:40] just living life." See, you guys got
[1:27:41] Enoch as some perfect guy that never
[1:27:43] fussed with his wife. Well, she might
[1:27:47] have fussed with him.
[1:27:51] Sorry, sisters.
[1:27:54] Never had a trouble. Never went to work.
[1:27:56] Never had problems. Never had a
[1:27:57] headache. Never had a foot that hurt.
[1:27:59] Never hit his thumb with a hammer. Now,
[1:28:02] no, we get this idea. Here's Enoch. Just
[1:28:04] this so perfect aura.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Enoch
[1:28:12] lived in a perfect aura. Then God would
[1:28:14] be obligated to give you a perfect
[1:28:17] That's
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; exactly
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; aura.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't live in a perfect aura.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; He lived in a perfect faith in a perfect
[1:28:25] word.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And you talk about it. back and see
[1:28:29] Enoch going right along.
[1:28:33] Got a band-aid on his thumb trying to
[1:28:35] fix the screen door.
[1:28:38] Had kids and a cat that hung on the
[1:28:39] screen door. He's walking along
[1:28:42] thinking,
[1:28:44] "My foot hurts,
[1:28:47] but the word says I'm healed."
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; That boss of mine. He'd fire me in a
[1:28:54] heartbeat if he could.
[1:28:57] Lord, maybe another job.
[1:29:01] And he feels something
[1:29:11] and he's there thinking about all that's
[1:29:13] wrong.
[1:29:16] And he felt something
[1:29:21] and the atmosphere changed. And he says,
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; "But Lord, you saved my soul."
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; You've filled me with the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; You've provided for me. You've healed my
[1:29:34] body. You've done all these things. All
[1:29:36] I can say is is thank you, Lord.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The job doesn't matter.
[1:29:42] The screen door doesn't matter. The boss
[1:29:44] at work doesn't matter. You're the one
[1:29:47] that matters. And he stepped into an
[1:29:49] atmosphere.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God said, "I'm pleased with
[1:29:53] you, Enoch.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Come walk with me."
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; No, we've got it. Then Enoch, the pious
[1:30:00] guy with the flowing robes that had all
[1:30:02] the scripture memorized, never made a
[1:30:04] mistake.
[1:30:07] When we get to heaven, we'll ask him.
[1:30:09] Except for the scripture says he'll have
[1:30:11] no remembrance.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; So, we won't even be able to ask him,
[1:30:15] "What was your life on earth like,
[1:30:16] Enoch?" I don't know. I've just dwelt my
[1:30:20] whole life in the presence of God.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; That earth thing. Was I ever on earth?
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Was I ever part of the cosmos?
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Some of you will get to heaven still
[1:30:33] worried about paying your mortgage.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Sorry, that was an uncalled for comment.
[1:30:46] You see your vision of today, tomorrow,
[1:30:49] of your expected end.
[1:30:52] What is our vision of our expected end
[1:30:54] my brother and sister?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Are you looking for an escape or looking
[1:31:01] for a fulfillment?
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Now, the definition, I had to look up
[1:31:05] the word fulfillment because I wanted to
[1:31:06] make sure I used it correctly.
[1:31:08] Fulfillment is the achievement of one's
[1:31:11] heart's desire.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; There you are. Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; See, I'm not looking for an escape from
[1:31:15] this earth.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for fulfillment.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Of a heart's desire.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; I need to hurry right along.
[1:31:27] Now, look how God views you for just a
[1:31:31] moment. Revelations 195-9.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And a voice came out of the throne,
[1:31:37] saying, "Praise our God, all ye his
[1:31:39] servants, and ye that fear him, both
[1:31:41] small and great. And I heard as it were
[1:31:43] the voice of a great multitude, as the
[1:31:46] voice of many waters, the voice of
[1:31:47] mighty thundering, saying, Allelujah,
[1:31:50] for the Lord God omnipotent reignth. Let
[1:31:53] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:31:56] him, for the marriage of the lamb is
[1:31:59] come.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; I identify with this scripture. I hold
[1:32:02] it as one of my favorite scriptures.
[1:32:06] Because what he's telling us here is
[1:32:08] we'll give honor to him and praise and
[1:32:10] glory to him because we're at a
[1:32:14] marriage.
[1:32:16] We're we're at a wedding.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; You realize that what's the millennium
[1:32:19] is? It's not the great escape.
[1:32:22] Millennium is your wedding time with the
[1:32:26] Lord Jesus Christ. your time of
[1:32:28] celebration, your time and you'll come
[1:32:31] into that and you're there because God
[1:32:34] says, "Oh, come look. The marriage of
[1:32:36] the lamb and his wife hath made herself
[1:32:39] ready." The priest didn't do it. And to
[1:32:41] her was granted that she should be
[1:32:43] arrayed in fine linen, clean and white,
[1:32:45] for fine linen is the righteousness of
[1:32:47] saints. And he saith unto me, "Write,
[1:32:49] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:32:51] the marriage supper of the Lamb." And he
[1:32:53] saith unto me, These are the true
[1:32:54] sayings of God. Now I want to know right
[1:32:57] now how many of you get up in the
[1:32:58] morning. Amen. Brother Isaac shared
[1:33:00] something with me a few days ago that's
[1:33:02] just really really been really been
[1:33:04] affecting me. A little study he read a
[1:33:06] little psychology you know a little off
[1:33:08] in that neuroscience thing of the mind
[1:33:11] and you know he just really dug into
[1:33:13] that.
[1:33:16] Wow. You guys turned me off.
[1:33:20] No. A little research shows the very
[1:33:22] first thoughts you have in the morning
[1:33:26] impact your whole day.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; And up till just a few days ago, I'd
[1:33:34] wake up in the morning and I'd start
[1:33:36] chucking through the paperwork. Got to
[1:33:39] fix this, got to do that, got to this,
[1:33:42] got to that. Oh man, man. And my day
[1:33:45] starts off
[1:33:47] and the doctor's like, "You have too
[1:33:49] much cortisol in your blood. too much
[1:33:51] stress.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; I've been waking up.
[1:33:57] Lord,
[1:33:58] if today is not the day of the rapture,
[1:34:00] tomorrow will be.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; I did wake up this morning.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; You know, thank you, Lord, for your
[1:34:11] blessings.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, I'm not exactly the sign
[1:34:15] of fitness, but of health, but but thank
[1:34:19] you, Lord, that you're you're changing
[1:34:20] me.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; I I'm not getting weaker, I'm getting
[1:34:24] stronger.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; And Lord, spiritually, I'm not getting
[1:34:27] weaker. I'm getting stronger. And I lay
[1:34:29] there in bed and I think, "Thank you,
[1:34:31] Lord. Thank you, Lord, for this work
[1:34:33] you're doing for me." I get out of bed
[1:34:36] and then I want company, so I go make
[1:34:38] coffee and I wave it under Sister
[1:34:40] Jerry's nose to wake her up. it works.
[1:34:43] And um and I'm suddenly
[1:34:47] happy. Not like I was unhappy, but
[1:34:49] suddenly it's just like changed the
[1:34:51] atmosphere.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Because you see, I was called to fulfill
[1:35:00] this word of God right here.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; I was called to show up at the marriage
[1:35:05] supper of the lamb. I was called to be
[1:35:08] clothed in white linen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was called to stand there before
[1:35:12] the throne. I'm not making this just
[1:35:15] personal to me. I'm speaking it in first
[1:35:17] person, but it's for you. Amen. We were
[1:35:20] called to this. We're called to fulfill
[1:35:22] this word. Oh, but brother Paul, you
[1:35:24] know, I got bills to pay and I've got
[1:35:27] children to raise and I've got a car
[1:35:28] that makes weird noises and a job I
[1:35:31] don't like. That's all temporal. Yes.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Don't let it distract you and take your
[1:35:38] vision from the goal and bring it down
[1:35:40] here and lock it on to these things that
[1:35:43] God can change tomorrow. And if he
[1:35:45] doesn't change it tomorrow, it won't
[1:35:47] matter because one of these days soon
[1:35:50] you'll be gone anyhow. You won't be
[1:35:52] saying, "Lord, you can't have a rapture
[1:35:54] today. I've still got a mortgage to
[1:35:56] pay."
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; You won't be saying, "Oh, praise God.
[1:36:00] The rapture's on. I won't have to pay
[1:36:02] the mortgage." You won't be thinking
[1:36:04] about that. You'll be thinking in a
[1:36:06] twinkling of an eye. I'll get to see my
[1:36:09] Lord face to face. I'll get to see the
[1:36:12] saints of all those rugged soldiers of
[1:36:15] the cross. I've made it. Oh Lord, thank
[1:36:18] you. I made it.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz none of this will matter anymore.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; I can tell by some of your reactions,
[1:36:30] this is mattering quite a bit at the
[1:36:32] moment, though.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; No, I do believe in paying your bills. I
[1:36:38] do believe in taking care of business
[1:36:40] and and these kind of things.
[1:36:43] But I believe this is the business we
[1:36:45] really ought to take care of.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; This is the business that ought to be at
[1:36:49] the top of our list.
[1:36:51] This ought to be the business that takes
[1:36:53] that
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; focus
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; that we focus on this.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; In the sermon perseverance,
[1:37:08] brother Brown says this. As you know, I
[1:37:10] believe then to bring that a little
[1:37:12] higher that God's got all of his church
[1:37:14] now, the called out remnant of his
[1:37:15] church under expectations of his coming.
[1:37:18] You see, I remember at the gate in his
[1:37:22] coming there must have been a tremendous
[1:37:23] Good Friday when they noted he was
[1:37:25] coming to the feast and expectations and
[1:37:28] many of them was expecting him to be
[1:37:29] there.
[1:37:31] Now look at this.
[1:37:33] I hope that you place yourself in the
[1:37:35] right category here.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Someone to see some kind of miracle.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Others are wanting just to see him.
[1:37:47] Others wanted to make fun of him.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; It's kind of a different Passover that
[1:37:51] had been for a long time. And we rode
[1:37:53] into the city. Let's just be expecting
[1:37:56] him to come and take us home.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; And then when he comes this time,
[1:38:02] see, there's where our expectation. It
[1:38:05] isn't about, oh,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; pardon me for going here.
[1:38:11] This critic says this
[1:38:14] and this critic says that.
[1:38:18] What does your critic say?
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they said. What do you
[1:38:28] say? index.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come down and say, "Hey,
[1:38:35] did you guys um
[1:38:37] commission the pew pole to see what they
[1:38:40] think of me?"
[1:38:48] He narrowed it right down and says,
[1:38:51] "Who
[1:38:53] do you say?"
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] s here as any kind of critic you want
[1:39:00] this morning.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be a critic of Paul.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David. You beat me to
[1:39:11] the punchline,
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; but that's good.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how we view it. It
[1:39:16] needs to come down to thou art the
[1:39:20] Christ.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; The son of the living God.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; That's what all matters. You don't like
[1:39:25] my punctuation. You don't like my
[1:39:27] presentation. That's irrelevant.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Who do you say
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; today? We need to be able to say the
[1:39:34] word of God. This is the son of God.
[1:39:38] Thou art the Christ and you are in me
[1:39:41] and I am in you and your word is living
[1:39:44] today. And it is focused me so much on
[1:39:47] the goal. Now, let me take you back to
[1:39:49] just a little natural thing right here.
[1:39:51] And somewhat recently here, there was a
[1:39:54] a young person uh just ran young woman
[1:39:57] just ran the fastest mile that a young
[1:40:00] woman has ran in for however many years.
[1:40:02] And they're they're asking this
[1:40:04] question. I was just reading it as a as
[1:40:07] a paragraph or two. They ask her a
[1:40:09] question, you know, what was you
[1:40:11] thinking?
[1:40:14] And it says that she paused and looked
[1:40:16] at them and said, "I wasn't. I was
[1:40:18] running.
[1:40:24] Are we thinking
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; or are we running?
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You start thinking and you'll have
[1:40:30] to stop running to do your thinking.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; But it's time for us to just look at the
[1:40:35] goal and say, "You know what? God called
[1:40:37] me to that goal and I'm going to run
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to keep running and I'm
[1:40:41] going to put every effort, every energy
[1:40:43] I've got into running this race. And
[1:40:45] when I get to the finish line, I expect
[1:40:48] to hear the words, "Well done, my good
[1:40:50] and faithful servant." Amen. Not, "What
[1:40:53] were you thinking?"
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to refocus. That's
[1:41:00] right.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; On the goal.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Not on what we've done, where we've
[1:41:05] been, what we own, but to focus on the
[1:41:08] goal.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; See, Satan's job is to lower your
[1:41:12] expectation. Yes,
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:41:15] Let's just sum it up. That's very
[1:41:16] simplistic, but let's just sum it up.
[1:41:18] It's much more complex than that. It is
[1:41:20] one of those on the board, you know, the
[1:41:22] parentheses 2x * y, you know, deals that
[1:41:27] that's actually Satan's plan gets that
[1:41:29] complex. Or we can simplify it. It all
[1:41:33] equals he's trying to confuse you your
[1:41:37] vision of the goal.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Hm.
[1:41:43] Muddy water.
[1:41:48] I was in Chile one time and a brother
[1:41:50] said, "Hey, brother Paul, we're going to
[1:41:52] go swimming.
[1:41:54] You want to go with us?" I was there as
[1:41:56] a minister and I I didn't really feel
[1:41:58] like
[1:42:00] partaking,
[1:42:02] you know, going swimming. Not that I
[1:42:05] felt pious or anything, but I just like
[1:42:07] I'm not here to to do it. It was hot
[1:42:09] out, but we walked down a trail. Sister
[1:42:12] Jerry's off with some sisters. We walk
[1:42:13] down a trail and we get down to the
[1:42:15] swimming pool and I remember commenting
[1:42:18] to a brother there that was a good
[1:42:19] friend of mine. I says, "Brother, in
[1:42:21] Idaho." He goes, "Yeah, yeah. What?" I
[1:42:25] said, "We don't call this a swimming
[1:42:26] pool in Idaho. We call this a mud
[1:42:28] puddle."
[1:42:31] He just looked at me. It's deeper than a
[1:42:34] mud puddle.
[1:42:37] My brother and sister, Satan wants to
[1:42:40] muddy the water.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; There's nothing cleansing
[1:42:45] in a mud puddle.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; You get out just as dirty as you went
[1:42:51] in.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; And that's what Satan's trying to do.
[1:42:54] He's trying to cause us to lose our
[1:42:57] vision.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or he'll erase our expectations
[1:43:01] altogether. Just recently talked to an
[1:43:03] individual used the phrase, "It makes my
[1:43:05] heart hurt. I used to be a Christian.
[1:43:08] Talk about making your heart hurt,
[1:43:10] right? They totally totally lost their
[1:43:13] expectation.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Their vision is gone and they've lost or
[1:43:18] it's been blinded to them their vision
[1:43:20] of God's expected end for them.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, my Bible says
[1:43:26] those he's called out,
[1:43:29] he will call in.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've got quite a bit more
[1:43:35] here. So, maybe we'll just move on.
[1:43:39] Well, actually, let me just jump to
[1:43:40] this.
[1:43:45] Let's just jump to this communion.
[1:43:48] I'll cut out all the personal commentary
[1:43:50] if you don't mind. Is there not a quote
[1:43:53] for communion on there? I'll just read
[1:43:55] it to you real quick here, saints. What
[1:43:57] if the apostle would have said, "Now,
[1:43:59] after nine days, we believe we got it.
[1:44:03] See, let's just accept it by faith and
[1:44:05] go ahead with our work. See, it would
[1:44:07] have never worked out. They waited there
[1:44:10] until they knew something happened.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what's the trouble of us is
[1:44:15] today we don't stay long enough.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely right.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Well, that's the reason afterwards we
[1:44:24] can just live any kind of life and do
[1:44:26] anything. Don't bother us because we
[1:44:28] didn't stay there long enough. Today
[1:44:31] we're in, tomorrow we're out. And this
[1:44:34] way and that way. If we stay long enough
[1:44:38] till you get in and close the door
[1:44:40] behind you,
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; there you are.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; You're going to stay in there.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; You're sealed into the day of your
[1:44:47] redemption.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; We go in.
[1:44:55] I don't know about you, my phone won't
[1:44:57] ring for two or three hours. I go to
[1:45:00] pray and it won't stop ringing.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I have failed that test before.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Do you know what I'm talking about?
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; We got up and we went and answered the
[1:45:13] phone.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Let's put those two as priorities on the
[1:45:18] scale.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Which one's going to win?
[1:45:28] telephone.
[1:45:32] Bing. Got to answer that thing. It might
[1:45:35] be somebody telling me I won the lottery
[1:45:37] that I never bought a ticket to.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Seek you first.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it. That's exactly right.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; I promise you, the devil's been waiting
[1:45:52] all day for you to pray so he could have
[1:45:54] somebody call you. Right.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And then you know what the phone call
[1:45:58] actually was?
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Hi,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; I'm Mary Beth. Our company wants to
[1:46:05] offer you a job. Pays you $1,000 a day
[1:46:09] for two hours of work. All we need is
[1:46:12] your social security number and your
[1:46:15] bank account number and your driver's
[1:46:18] license number and
[1:46:22] click
[1:46:25] See, when Satan breaks that,
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; okay, this is confessional time.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; When Satan breaks that, did you go right
[1:46:35] back in the room and go pray?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; No. At that point, you're thirsty.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; And you go take a drink and decide that
[1:46:43] you want to eat a cookie.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; And once you eat a cookie, you got to
[1:46:47] clean up the mess. And then you
[1:46:49] remembered you didn't go get the mail.
[1:46:51] And then by then your stomach's still
[1:46:54] growling and you're wondering what's for
[1:46:55] supper.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Prayer time.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Our goal.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Gone.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Satan's a sly old fox.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; How about we set a trap for the fox?
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The phone will ring.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Let it ring.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:19] Somebody knocks on the door,
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; let them knock.
[1:47:28] A brother once in closing, Sister Vik,
[1:47:31] if you would come. A brother told me
[1:47:33] once,
[1:47:35] he said, "Brother Paul, now Sister Nadia
[1:47:37] won't like this because I find humor in
[1:47:38] this, but she'll forgive me."
[1:47:41] This brother told me, he says, 'Well,
[1:47:43] Paul, I got rid of the cat. And I was
[1:47:47] like, 'Oh, really? How'd you do that? He
[1:47:51] said, ' Every time I get down to pray,
[1:47:54] that thing climbs the screen door.
[1:47:58] And finally, I decided the prophet said,
[1:48:01] and I went out there and said, in the
[1:48:03] name of Jesus Christ, I don't know where
[1:48:06] he landed, but he never came back.
[1:48:11] So he didn't see it as the cat. He saw
[1:48:14] it was the devil anointed the cat. But
[1:48:16] the cat must have agreed.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz he went and climbed the screen door.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, don't lose your
[1:48:23] focus.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Keep focused.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; All the rest of this is distraction.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; This happened in Arkansas. I've shared
[1:48:31] it here in the church.
[1:48:34] We're preaching there at Word of Life
[1:48:37] Hardy, Arkansas.
[1:48:40] Out of nowhere, I just start talking
[1:48:41] about how we we say is a blessing from
[1:48:44] God. This is a blessing from God. And
[1:48:47] I'm just starting to preach a scenario.
[1:48:49] I said, "So, you know, your company,
[1:48:52] your company says, hey, we want to give
[1:48:54] you a substantial raise.
[1:48:57] We want to make you a manager.
[1:49:01] We want to do all of this stuff,
[1:49:04] but
[1:49:07] you'll have to work Sundays and you'll
[1:49:10] have to close the store on Wednesdays.
[1:49:14] Now, I'm telling you how God in the
[1:49:16] foolishness of preaching can be so
[1:49:17] precise.
[1:49:19] Literally was a young man. Their front
[1:49:22] row is a little farther away than ours,
[1:49:24] but a young man just right here.
[1:49:27] his mother sitting just past Sister
[1:49:29] Jerry and the pastor's wife on the other
[1:49:32] side of the church. Little did I know
[1:49:35] that that was exactly what that company
[1:49:37] was offering that young man. And he was
[1:49:39] supposed to walk out of church that day
[1:49:40] and call them and give them an answer.
[1:49:43] And up to that point in time, he'd
[1:49:46] already told his mother before church,
[1:49:48] "I think I'm going to take the job. I
[1:49:49] need the money."
[1:49:52] But God is so precise.
[1:49:55] come right down and used the foolishness
[1:49:57] of preaching to touch his heart. And he
[1:50:00] got up, walked out of church,
[1:50:03] called his boss, and said, "I know
[1:50:04] you're not going to understand,
[1:50:08] but I put it in the balance,
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:12] and serving God won."
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:16] And his boss says, "Well,
[1:50:19] if you ever reconsider,
[1:50:22] the job's still yours." And he says,
[1:50:24] "Don't wait for me."
[1:50:27] [Music]
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; The house of God,
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; It's more important than even
[1:50:34] my work.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; And God blessed that young man. I kept
[1:50:39] track a little bit by phone a little
[1:50:40] bit. God blessed that young man. Gave
[1:50:42] him a better job.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, that's what God
[1:50:46] wants us to do. Exactly.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Don't lose focus.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; On the goal.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on the cross. Keep your
[1:50:53] eyes on Jesus. Don't lose your focus.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; I've been a bit little bit lengthy here.
[1:51:05] Let's just stand. I'd like to sing the
[1:51:07] song 365.
[1:51:09] Amen.
[1:51:11] Hallelujah.
[1:51:14] Forgive me for my rambling.
[1:51:16] Amen.
[1:51:18] These things the Lord just lays on your
[1:51:20] heart, you just have to put them out.
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:29] This is my desire
[1:51:34] to honor
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:38] you
[1:51:42] and with all my heart
[1:51:47] I worship
[1:51:49] you
[1:51:55] I have within me
[1:52:00] I give
[1:52:03] you
[1:52:04] praise
[1:52:08] that I adore
[1:52:12] is in you,
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:21] Lord. I give you my heart.
[1:52:24] I give you my soul.
[1:52:29] I live for you alone.
[1:52:34] Every breath that I take,
[1:52:37] every moment I wait.
[1:52:42] Oh, have your way with me. Let's sing
[1:52:47] verse two again.
[1:52:50] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:52:54] I give you my soul.
[1:52:58] I live for you alone.
[1:53:03] Every breath that I take,
[1:53:07] every moment I'm awake.
[1:53:12] Oh, have your way in me.
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I just as I was
[1:53:22] studying this out,
[1:53:25] it just kept coming to me over and over
[1:53:27] again.
[1:53:30] Lord,
[1:53:33] Lord, have your way.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Let your desire be fulfilled in me.
[1:53:38] Father,
[1:53:40] the word has showed me
[1:53:43] so clearly what you called me for.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Help me stay focused, Lord.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Not to try and think while I'm running
[1:53:53] the race, not to reason why I'm running
[1:53:56] the race,
[1:53:59] but just run.
[1:54:01] And the goal,
[1:54:04] the goal is set before us. It's not a
[1:54:06] moving goal. It's not a moving target.
[1:54:09] It's his word.
[1:54:11] It's unchanging through the ages. The
[1:54:14] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:54:18] The same God, the same calling, the same
[1:54:21] results.
[1:54:24] Oh Lord, I give you my heart,
[1:54:28] give you my soul.
[1:54:33] I live for you alone
[1:54:38] every month that I take.
[1:54:52] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:54:55] I give you my soul.
[1:55:00] I live for you alone.
[1:55:05] Every breath that I take,
[1:55:08] every moment I'm away,
[1:55:14] have your way with me.
[1:55:20] I'm resting on
[1:55:23] the finished work
[1:55:26] of Jesus Christ today.
[1:55:32] All circumstances
[1:55:35] will be gone.
[1:55:38] The word of God will still remain.
[1:55:43] No sickness, fear, no guilt or sin
[1:55:49] can have control
[1:55:52] and worry me.
[1:55:55] The keys of faith are in my hands
[1:56:01] and I am bound for victory.
[1:56:09] I am free.
[1:56:13] My new day has come.
[1:56:21] Now I can be
[1:56:25] who I truly
[1:56:28] am.
[1:56:32] I am free.
[1:56:37] Covered by his blood.
[1:56:44] All things
[1:56:48] are possible
[1:56:50] with God.
[1:56:56] All things
[1:56:59] are possible
[1:57:02] with God.
[1:57:04] [Music]
[1:57:08] A great commission
[1:57:11] from my Lord.
[1:57:15] I have now received.
[1:57:20] The prince of power
[1:57:24] of the air will never have
[1:57:29] a pardon me.
[1:57:32] As amateur
[1:57:35] creator, I can change the atmosphere
[1:57:42] around.
[1:57:43] I use the chain
[1:57:46] of circumstance
[1:57:49] for any spirit to be bound.
[1:57:56] For I am free.
[1:58:01] My new day has come.
[1:58:08] Now I can be
[1:58:13] who I truly am.
[1:58:17] [Music]
[1:58:20] I am free.
[1:58:24] Covered by his blood.
[1:58:31] All things
[1:58:35] are possible
[1:58:38] with God.
[1:58:43] All things
[1:58:47] are possible
[1:58:49] with God.
[1:58:55] Oh, I know that Jesus
[1:58:59] the I am
[1:59:02] is the same today.
[1:59:07] The prophet came to show the light.
[1:59:13] The bride must have it on display.
[1:59:19] The hour has come for Christ in us.
[1:59:24] to be completely
[1:59:28] glorified.
[1:59:30] I want the spirit
[1:59:34] to be free to do the greater works in
[1:59:41] me.
[1:59:44] I am free.
[1:59:48] My new day has come.
[1:59:55] Now I can be
[2:00:00] who I truly am.
[2:00:07] I am free.
[2:00:11] Covered by his blood.
[2:00:19] All things
[2:00:22] are possible
[2:00:25] with God.
[2:00:30] All things
[2:00:34] are possible
[2:00:36] with God. I am free.
[2:00:40] Oh, I am free.
[2:00:46] My new day has come.
[2:00:53] Now I can be
[2:00:57] who I truly am.
[2:01:04] I am free.
[2:01:09] sovereigned by his blood.
[2:01:16] All things
[2:01:20] are possible
[2:01:22] with God.
[2:01:27] All things
[2:01:31] are possible
[2:01:34] with God.
[2:01:37] [Music]
[2:01:39] Amen.
[2:01:41] Can we sing? In Christ alone I place my
[2:01:43] trust. It's number 363.
[2:01:46] It's key of A.
[2:01:50] In Christ alone
[2:01:53] will I glory.
[2:01:57] So I could pride myself
[2:02:02] in battles won.
[2:02:07] For I've been blessed
[2:02:10] beyond measure
[2:02:14] and by his strength alone
[2:02:20] overcome.
[2:02:25] And oh,
[2:02:27] I could stop and count successes
[2:02:34] like diamonds in my hands.
[2:02:41] But those trophies could not equal
[2:02:47] to the grace
[2:02:51] by which I stand.
[2:02:56] In Christ alone
[2:03:02] I place my trust
[2:03:08] and find my glory in the power of the
[2:03:16] cross
[2:03:19] and every victory.
[2:03:23] glory.
[2:03:25] Let it be said
[2:03:29] of me.
[2:03:31] My source of strength,
[2:03:37] my source of hope
[2:03:41] is Christ alone.
[2:03:47] in Christ alone
[2:03:50] do I glory.
[2:03:54] For only by his grace I am redeemed.
[2:04:04] For only his
[2:04:07] tender mercy
[2:04:11] could reach beyond my weakness to my
[2:04:17] knee.
[2:04:22] And now
[2:04:25] I seek no greater honor
[2:04:31] in just to know him more.
[2:04:39] And to count my gains but losses
[2:04:44] to the glory.
[2:04:49] of my Lord.
[2:04:54] In Christ alone,
[2:05:00] I place my trust
[2:05:05] and find my glory in the power of the
[2:05:13] cross.
[2:05:17] and every victory.
[2:05:23] Let it be said
[2:05:26] of me.
[2:05:29] My source of strength.
[2:05:35] My source of hope
[2:05:39] is Christ alone.
[2:05:43] One more time. In Christ alone
[2:05:50] I place my trust
[2:05:56] and find my glory in
[2:06:00] the power of the cross.
[2:06:07] In every victory,
[2:06:14] let it be said
[2:06:17] of me,
[2:06:20] my source of strength.
[2:06:26] My source of hope
