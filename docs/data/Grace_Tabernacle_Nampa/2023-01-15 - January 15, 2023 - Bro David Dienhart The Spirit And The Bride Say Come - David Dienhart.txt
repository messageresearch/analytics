Revelations 22 and verse 17. if you haven't done all of his Commandments how are you going to enter into the Tree of Life if you know what to do and don't do it it's to you it's sin and there's only three physical ordinances that left us I'll leave it there you say well I've done two but not the other all right let's look at verse 17. I just read that because just above that blessed are they that do his Commandments have the right to the Tree of Life all right verse 17 and the spirit that's this part with verse 16. I Jesus is Sent By An Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star I'm root and offspring and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come I wonder if we can see truth spirit and Truth coming together here Spirit and the bride who is the bride we'll find out but just keep that in mind this you see both right here you speak so you see Spirit and Truth are one amen all right and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth receiveth other words has an ear to hear say come and him and let him that is a thirst come and what are they what do they ask you to come to the Artesian well the will of Life The Living Word that's what they're asking you to come to the place of worship come on where's it how's it going to be spoken today through him in Bride form who is the bride him the most Sublime words in the whole message is that she is him that's right amen and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely amen you may be seated turn with me to the scriptures also in Saint John 6. so who is this one she's the final voice to the final Age The Bride is the final voice what is the voice the word amen you say well Brother David how do you know that because in first John before we go to John 6 here in first John chapter 4 it says in verse 6 we are of God who's that speaking to as speaking to his bride that's bride testifying back we are of God how many know that you are of God you were in the root you are the branch bearing the energy from the Vine the vine was in the root you were in the root and the Vine bearing the fruit of the season the hour the time you're in what is the season of the hour of time we're in Bride time seed time the grain again son of man again himself again in the complete mystery of himself amen you say well who would be the complete mystery himself he's he's completing himself Adam was too but until Eve came forth revealed what was hidden in Adam and when the book was opened it revealed what was hidden in himself that's you you're the message right I just might as well come right down I'm not afraid to pull both barrels immediately because you are the message you are the light he said I am the light and ye are the light how can we walk in the light and not be the light how could we be washed by the blood of Jesus Christ and not walk in the light if we walk in the light we have Fellowship one with another with him and the blood cleanses us from all sin what is a light The Word of Promise The Word of Promise is the seed The Word of Promise is the light amen that word made manifest is light all right so we see here let's go back here to let's see oh yes he said we're of God verse of first John 4 6 and he that knoweth God I'm coming back to this revelation 22 I just read and he that knoweth God heareth us the spirit of the Bride say come and he that heareth saith come is that right and he that heareth happens to be my brother my True Blood Brother and sister is that right because because why same father same body same Christ it's not another Christ it's all that Christ was he poured into his body his church his bride where is his name it's in her that's it that's it now we're coming into spirit and Truth that's right amen so so we say here see now we're coming here he says there that he that heareth us he that knoweth God heareth us why because we're the word living we're the word speaking where the word himself we have the mind of God to know what he wants done with his word and we know that it's him working in and through us then he that heareth us he that knoweth God heareth us okay and so he said he that is not of God heareth not us it's not hearing with the ears it's hearing with your heart then what is your heart speaking back lord hear my heart I wonder is it communion that's why we take communion that's why we take the Lord's Supper we do this in remembrance of what he has done for us what did he do for us he poured out his life to us what is the life in us our defecation that we were in him always were in him that's what we testify that's why a new birth is the reason we come to take communion without the new birth you can't hear how can you take communion you're not in communion boy that was strong but that's the truth go back to go back to Future Hope and see if that's not what the prophet said about the Lord's Supper who's who could take it and who couldn't amen that's powerful I know but that's the truth amen it's I'm not playing around if I'm gonna I don't have much time left upon this Earth and I might as well just say it like it is and bring the word the message I'm going to preach to you Faith because the revelation of the word that you're hearing through this word will bring Faith if the faith isn't preached how are you going to get Faith Faith cometh by hearing the word what are you hearing the letter no you're hearing you're hearing the faith or the Revelation or the mind of God that's in the letter that's right if you hear that Minister then Faith cometh by hearing that word because Faith lays in that word I hope you got that that spirit and Truth coming together that's what the bride is she is that she is spirit and Truth because why he is spirit and Truth it's the word living and in action amen all right so we see here that he he that is not of God heareth not us hereby no we hereby no we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error he that can receive can hear the word is of God you want to know what the evidence is there it is if you want to note the evidence of the whole of the indwelling of the holy spirit is there it is you're able to hear and to receive the word for your season that spirit and word coming together to manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen all right so if we know that they can't hear that then we know hereby and it's not us judging anybody the word's judging you you judge yourself by the word he is the word if we change his position anything from being that then we've missed it we're not we're not Ministers of the letter we are ministers of the spirit for the spirit giveth life to the letter the spirit is the spirit is him in the letter under the letter you see what I mean yes amen and there's going to be a bride that will be that word living the life of that word living she'll be a living manifestation she'll be a living Bible she's a living letter Amen in the promised word for this hour she's got to be because she is that promised word that's the seed that's the promised seed that's not he that's born of the flesh that's he that's born of the spirit amen all right so hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error they can't hear the word then they're not they can't be of God if they can't hear the word now that isn't judging immediately you may come to hear it ponder it hear it God will Quicken it to you we're not standing here judging you're in and you're out and you're in and you're out but by their fruit they are known because the fruit is not emotion the fruit is the word living for the season to receive the word for the season right and how are you going to do that without the spirit coming on that word amen that's what sets the bride apart from the church as she's the word living and in action she's the living and operative word hallelujah what caught our attention was that the word come on the scene knowing the secrets of the heart what caught the attention of the woman at the well we know that when Messiah cometh he'll say and speak these things that know these things but who are you and brother Brad said when that word comes down in you it's a messiah again it's a messiah in action it's Christ the anointed word living in action to the season to the time you have the substance you were the thought in him now the substances become life because it was spoken by a word it's always the word coming forth It's the opening of the word that will put you in a body change [Music] Hallelujah amen amen now I'm just starting all right let me just before we go to St John well let's read Saint John 6. I told you to turn over there so let's go to Saint John 6. and see here and let's start with the 63rd verse this is when the 70 had left demon this is a hard saying and what if you say he come from God and he said well that's a hard saying he we know him as a man we know where he lived we know he's born they were judging by the outside Jesus said I don't judge by the outside you judge by the outside I judge no man Paul said himself I we don't know a man by the flesh we don't know we knew Jesus by the flesh but henceforth no we him no more amen so quit your judging by the outside let's start judging what is being lived out from the inside amen all right now so Saint John 8 or no six I'm sorry Saint John 6. 63rd verse it is the spirit that quickeneth our our pastor brought this last time you're talking about the spirit without the word without the spirit no good all right he said it is the spirit that quickeneth so you can have the word but without the spirit you just got a letter you don't have the thought you don't have the substance of that word amen all right it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing well that's a good one the flesh profiteth nothing the words here it is the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit and they are life they are Spirit The Words the words are spirit and life amen all right for Jesus but there but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who were they were that believe not and who should betray him amen all right Genesis 5 24 very familiar scripture but let's go back there Enoch was a type of our day seventh from Adam Enoch typed our day the emphasis on Enoch is that he walked with God the emphasis today for a bride today is that she's walking with God oh they do great exploits Enoch built a pyramid which was the word the Revelation he had the full complete revelation of that word amen but the head Capstone couldn't be put on it until this hour so he had the Revelation that he needs to leave it off of there until the fullness of that Revelation comes forth and the stone within that pyramid is made known as the Capstone and that is yours and my adoption or perfection amen because our message today is the Capstone that's our message today is the Capstone and it's Jesus Christ himself revealed in the form of his word bride because he said this messenger pick up your pen and write this messenger would point the people to a word born bride and then he would point that word he said and that word born bride will be pointed to the land in the sky and the Bible and the prophet said in Rising of the Sun and that's our Lord up there we saw him we seen his picture and that was The Headstone coming to the bride for Unity to receive her to bring her to where he is the climax of this whole coming the Revelation is his coming the Revelation to the bride is his coming and the coming of the Lord will be climaxed in our meeting in the air and our body change the bride knows her husband her name was in that book in fact that whole book contained her name because her that book was the another record in the in the in the book of life but another record was the eternal life record of Christ himself and that was he said that's the bride's book yeah you know I've just been through that series the white Throne judgment amen all right that's not another book is another record in the book and this is the record that he's given to us eternal life and that life is a son and he that hath the son Hallelujah he that hath the seed half life because the spirit that quickeneth was sent to Quicken that word quickened that life and if that word of that life is quickened what would it be it would be Jesus Christ himself again manifested in flesh Eve was the mystery of Adam revealed he was Mrs Adam yeah amen that's correct amen amen amen it was an unveiling an unveiling a complete unveiling of himself but she always already the mystery in him but when the rock beneath the rock was unveiled we come to ourselves face to face with him Hallelujah because it called our name it opened up the word the word is unveiled to us now we become and are the very revelation of himself you want the prophet's word for it he said the bride is the Revelation is himself revealed is himself who is he the word who is he life said I just read it to you out of Saint John 6. that word becomes Spirit In You amen what a reality how can we walk with God and have a bunch of nonsense called fear there's no fear in Walking with God he's already ordered the steps we take in fact Psalm 32 8 let's let's turn before I before I read that scripture there let's turn to Psalm 32 8 a minute I didn't know how I was coming this together I just it's going to be just Way Beyond what I thought but I knew God would bring it if you believe that Brother David absolutely I don't have my own ideas this is his this is his thoughts this is him speaking to you this morning you certain of that absolutely a man can't do these things it's him doing it amen that doesn't build up David Dave is nothing but an instrument data is nothing but a vessel a flesh vessel that's not my identification my identification is in Christ in me is the identification showing that I was in his thought I was the thinking of himself and I was his eternal thought of himself before the foundation of the world I was his heart purpose he chose me sovereignly before the world began it was his own choosing I had nothing to do with it but I'm not ashamed of it and I glorify him in it because he's given me the record the record that I have he's given me is unveiled to me there is no more fear I don't care if the Earth shakes and everything else around us my steps and your steps have been ordered of God you're walking with him not only walking with him he said I'll be with you but I'll even be in you man Hallelujah Psalm 32 and verse 7 says Thou Art my Hiding Place amen Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance amen amen I will instruct thee glory to God I will instruct thee and I will teach Thee I will be in you an inside teacher I will instruct Thee I will teach Thee I will show Thee the way Jesus said I am the way I haven't even got this scripture yet I was going to come to it but I am the way and I will show you the way to go and I will guide you I'm I'm quoting the scripture and just right before me and I will guide thee with mine I he is my guide [Music] and he's opened a message to me and that I and that message have become the self same self person I'll guide me with that eye amen amen amen are you with me all right that eye is the word himself living I'll guide thee with mine eye hey what a what a promise what a rest what a relaxing time we are in you mean the midst of all this trouble and perversion and insanity and people trying to say I'm a Frog and I'm this and I'm somebody else yeah oh my and here our psychiatrists that are that there are okaying all this other stuff and trying to teach them I'm glad we have a sane mind yes I'm glad we have a sane mind we have the very Mind Of God that was in God to begin with and now made manifest we hold substance that eternal life in you is not something of a of a of a feeling it is substance it's the word Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah that's when you know him but you see that word and that Spirit come together and the revelation of the word open to your heart that's substance that was already in him that's himself that's himself there's no greater substance than that you now have you have now Faith is the substance and the evidence amen Things Not Seen he created the worlds by the word he spoke faith how'd he create it he created it by faith the Bible said he created it by faith and and created to put the things into existence through and expect a word or the thought of his self knowing it through word and the things which are made are not made of things that do appear how are you brought here you are a spoken word creation you are a spiritual spoken word creation through a spiritual womb through a spiritual ground that God foreordained and prepared to receive that seed and to a seed coming to seed brother Graham said it was word coming to work Hallelujah Hallelujah amen are we seeing the picture who are you seeing yourself you're looking into the word and you're seeing it's opening to you what are you seeing now you stand here and you look into it with an open face an unveiled face Hallelujah that rock within the rock has been Avail the unwritten word you are that message you are that seven seal you are that word revealed thank you Lord thank you Lord well that's pretty unstrange and unusual I knew there's something unusual about you Brother David y'all but leave me alone this is what I've been looking for and I found the release I found the I found the joy unspeakable I found I found what it is to walk with God I found what true worship was and I'm in that place of worship and his name is revealed in me he said I was born of brother Brown said born of Charles and illebranum but there was a little light in there and that was working talk about communion that was working and then I was born again I heard the word that was working in there that would ruin me I heard the word of what he said about me and what he did for me and all and he said and then I come to myself I was born again and he said no more am I the son of Charles and Ella Branham I'm a son of the king that's right glory to God he unveiled himself a complete unveiling of himself that's what the seals did right all right now Hallelujah I don't even know where to go from here it's all so quickening okay Genesis 5 let's go back to Genesis oh I didn't finish that I will yes I did okay back to Genesis 5 24. and all the days of Enoch were 360 in five years how do you like your your days to be that long would you keep walking Amanda and what's wrong with this keeping on walking now let's just keep on walking just keep on walking that's all you have to do is keep on walking keep walking in the light keep walking in Christ he that brought you here he that revealed the word to you will also change your body just keep walking don't worry about the noise and pestilences and all these other nonsenses nonsenses pestilences going around don't worry about that that's nothing to do with you well that person doesn't like me has nothing to do with you I'm talking about you the spirit of God in you brother Graham said the real you is the spirit of God that's in you if you want to know who you are that's who you are you always were eternally you always were in him you always were a part of him and you come down here not just loudly gagging around you always were you always were Eternal yeah you can't come to well I I yeah what does Eternal mean had no beginning and no end you see your strength do you see your Authority do you see who you are yeah now somebody kind of go around boasting themselves it's the word of Truth living he's the word all right now so Genesis I'm sorry not Genesis um yeah Genesis 5. and Enoch walked with God and he was not now if Enoch walked with God and was not what's the bride going to end up being she'll become a was not she's already spiritually or was not because she's already raptured Revelations 4 1 we've already raptured up caught up above laodicea the bride is not in laodicea I just might as well say it like it is right now brother Branham said that bride we've gone into a bride age we've turned the corner the Corner's been turned Hallelujah that's our Lord up there quickening pop lets us see his coming the Corner's been turned we're not we're not up here we're in the grain time brother Ram said don't you realize this is bright time this is seed time this isn't the Pentecostal time you had your Pentecostal but Pentecostal true baptism brought you to the maturity of this word and now you're the bride you're in the bride age you're in a raptured age Rapture brother sister goodness sakes we've undone Rapture spiritually we've already raptured and it's that Faith that'll change our mortal bodies how can communion then have how can light have communion with Darkness if you can't discern that darkness that you have and you've befriended and have influence over then you need a baptism you need a true spiritual birth because that word inside of you is a discerner and he said I'll live in them and I'll walk in them and I'll instruct them and I'll teach them and I'll lead them into all truth Saint John 16 13. I'll lead them unto all truth and I will hear the word and I will live it amen who will hear the word he and you hears the word it's not David trying to figure it out David this and David that David had nothing to do about hearing the word it's that Soul inside of me that has that seed laying there it has that ultimate land there that God sent and went out for By His spirit and found and quickened to life then what is it among us today it's Jesus Christ Among Us friends who do you say this is who is this Melchizedek yeah it's the son of man in Bride form I've heard from that theophany that's who I am is Melchizedek yes amen a lot of time could be spent on those little statements as the minister would know you could take that and just preach a whole sermon many sermons on it amen all right so but Hebrews 11 let's go over there he walked with God and he was not for God who took him I just think I'll just take myself no he didn't take himself anywhere God took him it was God's achievement it was God's work it was God's doing it was God revealing he walked from Faith to Faith brother Brown said he lived from Faith to Faith he walked a little higher each step he was a little higher each step a little higher and how the prophet said he walked with raptured faith amen so a Hebrews 11 if you go over here to Hebrews 11 then you'll find out that about more little more about Enoch remember he's our type if Enoch walked with God this bride's got to be walking with God it's just before the destruction amen all right he's no special man he was a man but he caught revelation God revealed himself sovereignly to Enoch one man showing it would be an individual walk amen amen all right it's uh Hebrews 5 11 5 by faith by what Revelation hello revelation of the word is that right what God hid is revealed to you he said it's never revealed to a group it's an individual go back and see what the prophet said about that over and over and over again especially in Christ The Mystery of God revealed over and over it's an individual it's an individual that he vindicates himself proves himself to us an individual never a group he said it's individual don't try to perfect your church your church won't get perfected but you will I'm not saying there isn't perfect ones perfect ones walking in among them certainly there is but there's three kinds of Believers in every congregation amen you say you're ashamed you ought to be ashamed to say that I'm not ashamed of it he just wasn't ashamed to say it I'm not saying who is and who isn't but I am telling you what the bride is Soul you have to match there has to be a match you're the peace has to come back has to come with the word it's not your understanding it's not your ideas not David's ideas it's Christ in you Christ in you Christ The Mystery of God revealed in you okay so by faith Enoch was translated so how do you get there from from the from when he how he met God and always was with God and always was God and God just revealed himself to Enoch talk about A peculiar character walked with God showing the bride would be separated from everything else no Organization no dominating female spirit with God Alone amen with God Alone let that go of that denominational feeling and sensation and high don't you let that thing swallow you up that dominating female will never come under the headship of the word amen and in fact it assurps the word it's the very seed of the Catholic Church God will have nothing to do with that amen I don't care where it shows up the bridal chop his head off because she will not put up with that spirit won't come around her and have influence over her she won't allow it amen if they don't speak according to the law and Prophets there's no life in them brother Brandon said you don't he said you don't receive the word like that just by reading the word he said you read between the lines he said you just don't receive the word verbatim well he said it and this is the way no no he said it's a love letter and it was sent to the bride and only the bride can read it right apparently yes amen he hid his mystery amen but he reveals it to his own his own that's himself he planned all this he made it possible it's his achievement not yours all right so by faith Enoch was translated that he should not translate his changed he was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God amen I was just going to get back here to where well I'll come to it possibly but Brother Brad said he pleased God with raptured faith amen that's perfect Faith he had this testimony and there's a people today through who through the blood of the Lamb and the testimony which they held overcomes is that right through their testimony I wonder if that testimony would happen to be the same testimony in a cat yes that's right it was this is my husband this is the word this is who I am that's a testimony you overcome by the word of your testimony Revelations 12 11. amen is that right absolutely okay then because he said he had this testimony that he pleased God and the next verse says but without faith but without revelation and came to everybody and said we denounce all Revelations we don't believe in it then he said you can't believe in Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is the revelation of the word amen he was God in son form is that right then who's the bride it's the same God in Bride form we were in him the fullness of what godhead was in him and we were in him so the same mystery the same God the same Revelation would thou be passed down to a many-membered body which is still him it's him father son Holy Ghost father son bride which is himself amen the word himself Spirit form the word in you who fleshes it in now then that makes us in the sun won that makes us and God absolutely won amen then I and you are absolutely this the attribute of God promise for this day the promised word of God for this day made manifest that's what the prophet said we'd be she said he said the bride would be absolutely the revelation of the son of man again amen all right now so let's go to Saint John eight Saint John 8 and let's look here at verse 31. then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on notice he spoke to the Believers here if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed why he was the word all right then it goes down here and it says 32 and ye shall say the next word for me no I didn't get how much amen out of that you know what no means it's not hit anymore all right it's revealed to you brother Branham always came back to Faith the Revelation is being annoying it's not something you imagine not something you hope for it's something you know right it's substance all right then right here it says and you shall know the truth Jesus said Saint John's Saint John 14 I am the way the truth and the life and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free then you're no more under bondage there's nothing here in bondage under you're a prisoner of Jesus Christ this is a love walk amen but that love perfect love the love charity is not the evidence of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost brother Brown thought it was until he said the angel of the Lord corrected me and it says being able to hear and receive the word for your season by revelation amen he said there's the genuine evidence that you're a genuine seed of God Hallelujah amen that's something and yet you got to have love because God is love but see Satan can pervert that he can copy it but he can't copy the third pull he can't copy the opened of the World opening of the word and it's the opening of the word that absolutely ignite you with him in communion and fellowship and Oneness it's that opening of the word that puts you in a rapture it's the opening of the word that sets you in Rapture already it's the opening of the word that that you're walking with God opens himself God reveals himself and you apply that token and you apply that token and you apply that token and apply it so it's on display it must be applied you're not walking with just nobody you're walking with the literal life of Jesus Christ himself in you a person you've accepted the leadership of eternal life Leadership of eternal life is Christ the person yes you've accepted that leadership you've given yourself over to that leadership you've let go you've abandoned yourself you have depended completely now upon his leadership if you really mean that and really want that then watch God go into action and display and manifest himself through you to the Word of Promise for the season amen amen all right so verse 30 we'll jump to verse 36. and if the sun shall make you free you shall be free indeed he that hath the son hath life and he said and Upon This Rock of Revelation I'll build my church what was it not to every Young Blood he said that who do you say that I am you say Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and I say to you not the rest of them I say to you Peter individually I say to you you have not received that by intellectual study and learning you don't receive that be some somebody told you that he said you didn't receive a secondary a second-hand religion or Revelation he said My Father which is in heaven has revealed that to you and Upon This Rock Revelation I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall never ever ever able never able ever able to withstand it and brother Brad said what's the Gates of Hell against today is the personal revelation in your soul of Christ being here now that's exactly what he said that's what all hell's against he said because the hell wouldn't be prevailed against it shows that the gates of hell would be against it and good people doing Mighty works casting out devils preaching under anointing and go to hell because Jesus said I don't know you who is he the word the spirit and the word never came together I don't know you I don't know you I'm not married to you you are not my thinking though you've done all these Mighty works that was the works of the Holy Spirit doing it but he said and we all believe in casting out Devils we all believe in that I dance and I've shouted under the Revelation that I'm free that I have Victory right now I've got Victory you know what my victory is my faith his faith if you hold that Faith you already got victory in the delicate you don't have Victory look at you look at how you feel look at what you're doing it's nothing to it my our faith is the victory what is our faith the revelation of himself in you that is my faith that is the Revelation that's my testimony he's present tense walking in this body and every member of the Bride will have the same revelation a different positioning in the body but the same Revelation the same head they're United to one head they are one person and because I hold the token and he's the token I walk with then I apply the token and the situation Rises up I place God another situation Rises up I place God when the wife gets a little angry with me I place God when this situation doesn't go just right I play Scott Place God Place God play the word apply the token apply the token there's no fear you're walking with God put it in his hands and watch him work commit it to him and watch him work why because he's made flesh in you Hallelujah Walking In You amen you say it says no story Brother David no it's a new story it's a brand new it has to be the word for the season it's the bride coming of Christ we've come out of Leo to see a dark denominationalism we raptured up and now when we raptured up we begin to see things that were hidden things in the book The Mystery of himself and it's open to us amen Revelation 4 1 is exactly what it is we say what is it you talk about a climax if I don't have that I won't have the climax if I don't have this revelation of his coming now I will miss the Rapture and the other change in my body because Sarah conceived and bear a son the very son they were looking for I'll let you chew on that a while she was a changed person and so are you spiritually you've been changed you are a new creation amen you're a new creation you've been through your Pentecost the Pentecost made way for the maturity of the word for Rapture for body change so don't get hung up back here just go through it keep walking amen amen you'll put those things right in order where they need to be in you and bring you to your head and reveal to you that you and the head are one that is perfection that's the stature of a perfect man matured amen and that's the message for the bride today while you lay in the presence of the sun you ripen amen Hallelujah don't put that as a seal you were sealed when you received the Holy Ghost inside of you and it come to dwelling in you and you knew it because the word became a living word to you and began to reveal itself to you you're growing who's growing he's growing Christ is growing it's not this man growing this man's getting old that word inside of me has never got any older it's an eternal life Resurrection what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is amen amen all right so we find in verse 30 6 that we find then the half the sun this is what he's given you eternal life and this is the record eternal life he's given to you that record he's revealed that record there's no more fear all right 36 37 and I know that you're Abraham's seed natural seed talking to the Pharisees Sadducees you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you well who do you say you are we believe Moses is messy well I mean brother rather's message but why are you seeking to don't play and and put a black check mark against the word that's reveal right in front of you in the bride form the revelations given because you are no place your by word has no place in you I'm not saying it's in this assembly but it's in the message around the message right it's the same thing it's repeated right back the devil didn't stay out there in denomination he just brought denominationalism right over here but without the Holy Ghost you'll never discern that spirit and it'll swallow you up because this devil will come along and say well you should love them I can't love that sorry I can't love unbelief I can love the unbeliever but I can't love unbelief so quit compromising with it and take your stand and separate yourself from it amen be ye separate saith the Lord amen and I'll receive you see the devil wants to come back all your feelings your feelings let go of your feelings what's the word say about you I don't know what it says they've been digging the open word then amen amen because this message speaks of you amen all right now I know some people don't like what's being said here this morning you think it's this old I'm just so tired I should go home I don't want to really be here anyway nobody loves me woe was me nobody shakes my hand you think I'm sorry for you no I'm not I'm sorry it's a Pity it's really a pity but there's somebody's going to receive the word and you don't realize what love is because love will give you the truth amen right that's exactly right and you can't have love you can't even know love until that word himself is living a living reality living in you abiding in you you don't know love you may have some ophelial friendship love that's okay I have that for my own wife but if that's not backed up by agape love it'll never come back to the right positioning of the word a wife won't truly love her husband and let him be the head and a husband will never know how to truly love his wife as Christ loved the church without God in them exactly right you just say what you want to say but that's the truth and I'm not ashamed to say that you say oh you hurt your feelings I'm sorry your feelings were hurt but I'm not ashamed to say it and if your feelings are hurt I'm sorry I'm not here to say it to your feelings I'm here to say it to your soul amen amen and that's what we want that's what the bride wants now I'm not off of page one and I have eight a lot of it's been said but I'll just continue on here just until we can't go any further not to take it up again if the Lord allowed me to okay he said I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father two natures to a different seed both religious one extremely religious more religious than Jesus was actually Jesus what we call religion he was life living the word living amen but we could go right down we could take verse 45 and because I tell you the truth you believe me not amen and he said 3 47 he that is of God heareth God's words you therefore hear them not because you're not of God now that's exactly first John 4 6. all right now he's standing in the midst of the church Revelation 3 14 said he's the beginning of the creation of God what's the message of our hour the beginning the amen the beginning of the creation of God this is what was spoken to the angel of the laodicean church age thus saith the amen the beginning the creation the beginning of the creation of God God himself creating himself through the word into flesh again foreign amen all right now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last stage he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this is another church age book page 385 number one number 72 if you have the brown book he said now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in the last stage he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself I can't spend all that time on those words I'd like to say some things about that but anyway I have already all right now he is the creator of that church who's he speaking of his body his bride all right the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride how he create it the opening of the word it's always through the word what the express his thought which was in him substance and he said every Son of God would do the same thing he said hold fast to that expression or or um confessions excuse me of that confession of your faith amen it's not speaking the word it's speaking faith in that word that's God speaking through you amen okay now he said he said the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride which he's a spoken word creation Loa body hast thou father prepared for me what did he prepare for him the only provided place of worship who was he it was the word made flesh he was God made flesh thou father I am the word made flesh you have created your own special place of worship holy place of worship we're talking about worship this morning yes yes okay all right so he said God not Mary provided that body amen he said he is the creator or yeah no I'm sorry yeah it was a God man he was the son of God or God in son form he was of the new creation man and God met and joined he was the first of this this you can underline this today new race he is the head of this new race This Is Us now the opened word will take will take and is taking us to our body change in the meeting of our bridegroom in the air we are walking with God the seventh seal is is who we are is we are that seventh seal revealed all right now we see the what is the seventh completion completion of what himself what was Eve the complete revelation of Adam of God what's he got to do he's got to bring that back into manifestation again before we can step together into Eden do you see what I'm saying it's got to be there and that Revelation is what sets upon the people apart because they got the revelation of his coming they see Christ they don't see an organization some system of church they see Christ all right now he said now we see the Promise now he said we're walking with God he said now and I take paragraph 578 of the Church of the Christ the mystery of God revealed he's he's now brother Brown said now not will be now we see the Promise being fulfilled in other words we see the scriptures being fulfilled this day these scriptures this scripture of his promise of his return to take her to himself is become revealed this day this scripture is revealed revealed to who unveiled to who she had to have that in her to be opened you had to have it already I hope you see that now when now we see the Promise being fulfilled just like just like a promised son Sarah neighbor and and Abraham were to have a promised son it was a promise the seed was of the promise wasn't Isaac natural it was the seed of promise amen are you with me the natural typing the spiritual they were changed bodily we're changed spiritually for a body change we're taking that son to the change amen they took it she took it in herself had the seed of her own husband so do we and it was after that that the Revelation come to her and the Fulfillment of Faith the fulfilling and the manifestation brought her to a position where she could conceive amen she had to grow into that position amen are you with me she was a young woman when she went down to abimelech she hadn't conceived seed yet is that right so now what are we seeing we're seeing we're seeing the promise being fulfilled Christ The Promise is Christ seed the promise is Christ the true headship going in now not going to be going in where are you going brother David where are you going where are you people marching to anyway in step with the word where are you marching home body change we're being caught up caught up caught up into Heavenly places now seated now in Heavenly places now seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now Christ in US defies who I am right I don't have any other identification anywhere else I know my name I can show my name in the scripture I can show who I am in the scripture I have it it's written of me I have the identification I have a photo identification open face beholding him in a glass the glory of the Lord brother bam said who did who do you see in that glass you see Jesus Christ he said and he says who is it you he said all right and it's now promises now being fulfilled he's going in who's he going in where's he going who's he and he is here now going in the revelation of Christ being here now all hell's against it going in the next statement coming in coming in well I thought it was supposed to be this way well forget your thinking that's what the Pharisees saw that's why they missed his coming they had it figured out another way they wouldn't receive the Vindicated manifested Vindicated message of their day they wouldn't receive a Vindicated message they had their own they had their own agenda I'll do my own thing well then my husband likes it or not I'll just do my own thing I know how to deceive him I had how to make him think he's this and this and this be careful that's no far off the truth what your motives and objectives are as you serve your husband you serve God and your husband's no more than a man like I am but he represents amen Christ to you and you represent Christ to her and he gave himself that doesn't mean to give to every little women have fear of whatever reaction when you ask her to do something and I will bless God I don't have to do it yes dear no that's not what we're talking about but holding in line with that word and in love giving yourself for the basis of the word and take headship over your house and start applying the token to your home yeah amen oh you see I'm walking with God then apply the token kick the trash out of your house kick those things that are denominational dominating female Spirits out of your house and forget about it don't go out there trying to do something that's not even in the word and using some intellectual conception of a man to do it yeah that's all you've got is intellectual conception that'll never put you in the rapture and it won't put anybody else in the rapture but we ought to be giving ourselves over Christ and you is eternal life living I didn't say just your life I said eternal life that spirit and word together living for others so how are you going to help somebody along give them the word amen give them no hour give them the message live the life that's what sets free not psychology all right now then the head and the body we see him going in we see him coming in his bride do we he's doing the same Works he did at the beginning and making ready making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at the first he said Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works what were the works Believing on him whom God hath sent is to do the works of God he said the works of God brother sister brother Brown said don't you don't you con don't you let don't judge yourself by how much power you have to cast out devils we have the authority if that's only part of that you've got you need more than that because Judas cast out devils by the same anointing it's the it's God to cast out a devil we believe that right that's an authority but don't you take as the evidence of the Holy Ghost dwelling in you I've got scripture on it if I can ever get to it I say I have to take it in different parts here but you go over to Saint First Corinthians 12 7. brother Brown said I wish I could say that these gifts of the Spirit were the evidence of the Holy Ghost but I can't it is the Holy Ghost doing it but it's not the evidence amen I think we made it pretty clear this morning what the evidence is what the true belief is faith his amen his amen now let's go back here if I just go as far as I can what time is it okay I got a little bit of time that's all right you say Amen or not I know I do notice I'm smiling all right I'll get to a place where we can close he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also why because he's risen in you then whose works is it is it David's works or his because I live you live also then it's Christ Living in you he does the works without that revelation you're just beating the wind because he that believeth in me the works that I do when were you believe in any before the foundation of the world how do you know you're a believer in him well I believe in Jesus Christ how do you know that he is because the Lord God has revealed it to you it's not a say-so it's a no-so The Works that I do shall he do also and the same one that did The Works yesterday comes in you and we'll do the works today Jesus said I can in myself do nothing but what I see the father do and he said this same Harmony will exist between the bride and his groom he reveals it to her and she speaks he reveals it to her and she does my father worketh hitherto means right at this time and then I work it's faith brother sister amen amen it's revelation this is what the just shall live by what's Faith takes its resting place in the word amen is that right man shall not live by every word but I mean by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God is that right all right okay now then the head and the body are becoming one unit brother man said the head and the body are becoming one unit they are no longer Twain They Are One how could he say that because the seal opened foreign amen I say the seal the seven sealed not six seven that's right that's right hello seven opened and it was the opening of the word that puts us in the rapture amen we raptured by the opening of the word all right now he said the head and the body are becoming one unit he said another place the head and the body are becoming one in Works in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself through what his promised word what's the attraction on the mountain the promised word fulfilled amen fulfill we turn the corner you say all you want well we didn't turn the corner I beg your pardon if he could say in 1956 that this United States turned a corner he said in 63 we turn to corner too amen because a message came forth that was hidden and he said this book this Bible's become brand new to me amen the the Cornerstone has now become the head of the corner and it's being united with the bride amen and we were pointed to the skies Behold the Lamb turn it to the right whose pick who is it who is it right why are all the people all excited about it who is it who's to becoming one with is coming on somebody had been waived over somebody it's for the bride coming of Christ stood right in the midst of the seven churches dressed as a woman hello perhaps gird about the golden girdle around the paps brother Brown said you want that quote I got we got it for you he said that's Christ that's the son of man dressed as a bride a woman in the midst of those Seven Ages what would it be at the end when the seed is now manifesting in some some are counted as shaft some are given life at the white Throne judgment and others the seed the Life coming through there comes to its head bride takes her position as his Queen when the seals open what do you say he was calling for his Queen wasn't calling for everybody else he was calling for his Queen to come sit by his side in her position take your position and the prophet said isn't it wonderful to see ourselves positionally placed in Christ Jesus a body has thou prepared me a position a place of worship where I'm worshiped there's your true worshipers I'll tell you right now there's no other true worshipers but the bride she's the only true worshiper there is the rest of them say we got the word we got the word we believe the word but to say Jesus Christ is takes the revelation of God in you you can't say he is is his present tense is is right now that's right he that believeth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God is born of God well not everybody says we believe Jesus Christ the son of God born of God but everybody that catches the revelation of the Christ in them knows that he is because it's himself revealed in you Upon This Rock and what did he say to Peter I say unto you Flesh and Blood didn't reveal to you but your father is in heaven and what happened and then what was what was that that Jesus recognized that the father did it was Peter's confession of Revelation it was revealed to him and he confessed the faith and brother and Jesus said that's the rock I'll build my church on I'll build it upon the revelation of myself there's where I'll build my church amen and if he built you on the revelation of himself who are you we're not building a wall we're building a building and it has corners and we've turned the final Corner we're heading home we're not even lay able to see it you'll see it can be going on all around you it has nothing to do with you brother Branham said this is made known these seals are revealed these things are made known the unveil's been taken off and unveiled in you and that's where it's unveiled and he said and that's at the end of the age at the at the end a time when the age is over Andy said and it is Amen Let me see Leo to see you you're not in laodicea the bride is not in laodicea she's in the bride time she's raptured out of Leo to say oh yeah Laos is going all around us we're being buffeted by Leo Messiah but what's that got to do with the revelation of Who You Are right we've turned the corner we're looking at one person here our Lord up there Our Savior quickening power lets us see his coming going in coming in his pride amen right she's been positionally placed I'm going to read one more scripture to you and then I got to close I'm only on page one let's turn over to First Corinthians 2. I'm gonna have to finish this this may be a three or four part series now but it's rich to me it's Rich it may not be to you but it is to me this is what God laid in my heart to bring to you this morning and I'm telling you it'll change you and I'm telling you now it has but it's from glory to glory he's changing me amen amen I'm being changed into the same image he's being personalized to the bride she and her are one you say well you young people you say well I wonder can I get it oh absolutely this message is for the seed he said I know there's something happening in my heart maybe maybe this one doesn't see it and that one doesn't see it maybe even my father and mother don't see it I don't know but I want to see it I longed to see it there's something in me individually this cries out and said I've got to have this well it's yours it's yours how do you know Brother David because you have a deep calling to the deep and you know what you are in your soul by the desire that it is and I'm telling you and given you this morning a filter to draw through it's already been given to us filter all you need to do is sit down and start drinking and start eating of that open word don't let nobody else it's you as an individual whether this one makes it that one makes it if you don't love me more than mother father sister brother if I'm not the head and who am I he's not the tale this is absolute truth this is the truth this is the truth and he's given life to Quicken it and he's seeking out his own and seeketh such to worship him in that Spirit of himself and in truth and let that become one in you okay I've got I've got to close but I want to close on just one other thing here Lord just brought to my remembrance but I've turned me to First Corinthians 2. now watch what he said God's vindicating himself through his promised word can you give me about five minutes okay thank you then it says through his promised word for the last days vindicating himself brother Branham said who would vindicate himself to it's an individual he promised this in the last day he promised this in the last days I just read it to you now if you're spiritual look at these words what would make you spiritual well he's I've had it said to me over the years David is just too spiritual yeah leave me alone because if this bride isn't spiritual she's natural yeah if she's spiritual she's carnal she's not spiritual she's carnal I'm not talking about just any Spirit I'm not talking about just Spirits I'm talking about the holy spirit being spiritual it's he that is spiritual if he's in you makes you spiritual did you get that all right it's not you that's holy it's he that's holy in you makes you holy it's it's not David that's the word it's the word that's in me makes me the word amen makes me the Living Word if my life doesn't match up what I say what I live if I can't live this word I have no right to even be up here preaching it and if I can't live this word I don't have him and I can't make me live the word he lives it he said Brother David I can't live it that's a lie of the devil if I ever heard one no you can't live it you Misses so and so and Mr so and so out here cannot live it no it takes him to come in and live it right but if he put in you that Faith to accept what he said he would give you then take what he gives you and claim it as your own say God you can't deny this to me because my desire is for you amen and you said you would give it to me and I met your requirements I've repented I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ now you said you would fill me with yourself and I have that desire I've took you at your word I believe what the blood did and I openly confess what I believed by the blood that's baptism you've got to have a genuine repentance yes that's the problem with most repentance it's not genuine it's not a genuine repentance of faith amen amen is that right you don't really know what he did for us but when you do and you said he'd paid the price you may not know all of it but you know he died at Calvary to save you and he poured out his life for you and he made he took your place and by faith in that you take his name in baptism testify that you died with him and you Rose with him outwardly and that will work righteousness in your life and he will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the new birth because why because there's a seat calling out for water there's a seat calling up for life and there's only one thing that'll come through the genuine filter of the word that's the Holy Ghost and we'll Quicken that seed in you to manifest the resurrection of Jesus Christ right now here today praise the Lord I say praise the Lord anybody can praise him with me my oh you're getting a little bit too spiritual Brother David you gotta be careful here I can be a spiritual I I won't jump as high as I live I gotta I can jump as high as I live that's getting higher and higher all the time you just don't want to jump any higher than you live amen is that right amen amen all right brother Brown said don't watch what God in demonstration so much watch him in action what he does according to the word it's not a demonstration it says watch to emit action he said you wonder why I don't preach on the Holy Ghost so much which he has all the time but he said why because it's the Holy Ghost is an action in you it's the word living you recognize the word and now he puts it in your hands and said what's your decision right right okay First Corinthians I've tried to get back to that several times okay First Corinthians 2 14 for our ten but God hath revealed them to us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the Deep things of God and what man knoweth the things of man saving the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God how are you going to know the things of God except the spirit of God Lives in You okay now see how how clear the evidence becomes see he said for what man knoweth excuse me verse 12. now we receive not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak hello not in The Words which means what are you speaking Faith Revelation he said not which which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth he's an inside teacher I just read to you Psalm 32 8. I will instruct I will teach I will lead you in dull truth I will guide you by my eye I'll Quicken the word I'll show you how to go who wouldn't want to depend on him the Lord is my shepherd I shall not be lacking of anything though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I walk in the light what do I have to fear the shadow for God oh I don't know if I don't if I don't do these things just right try to figure it out and Bill I'm just so afraid what are you fearing the shadow for hello who's your absolute The Shadow or the message God is light walk in the light the beautiful light the light has come unto you the glory of the Lord has risen upon you what do you mean Brother David the glory of the Lord has risen upon me he said he wouldn't share his glory with another he isn't he's sharing it with himself you're himself you are his glory in fact Jesus said May the glory that is that is upon me may it be upon them the glory which is seen to meet Saint John 17 may it be on them and the woman is the glory of the husband oh my don't live beneath your privileges brother rise up and forget what the devil's trying to reason with you don't accept his knowledge of a con intellectual conception this has got to be revealed you have a right to ask for did not he say ask for it yeah ask if you need Wisdom ask for Godly Wisdom ask for revelation I'll give it to you ask and I'll show it to you we have not because we ask not ask in faith nothing can stop amen all right so he said now which things we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but with God Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual not trying to put mixed natural and spiritual together you don't mix natural and spiritual together spiritual things confirm spiritual things the word amen all right then he said but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God there it is not an intellectual conception not a study not made up study study study study it's not study that gives it to you amen all right it's feeding it's receiving it's drinking I tried to figure it out but the natural man receiveth not the spirit of God and they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them know them know them because they are spiritually spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual that's your bride that's Jesus Christ one that's spiritual and what are you saying Brother David we are saying that this spiritual Supernatural virgin birth of the Bride is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever she is him just amorphy another form to a mask a drama this is a drama today what is the promised word for the day it's now being fulfilled what is it Christ's coming in you boy that's good that's rich that's lovely that's yummy don't need any don't need any dressing on top of that that's the truth all right the truth for our day all right now and blessed are your eyes that they see and the things you hear for no man he said yet himself he said it's the spiritual judges all things discerns all things in other words he that is spiritual discerns all things yet he himself is judges of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ now there's a lot more that could be said on that and I'll just pick it up another time but let me go back here about something and brother Brown said this the new creation this eternal life word spoken word creation is what the bride is that's the new birth there's a spoken word creation no longer because of that no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh brother Brown said no longer so quit looking at your mistakes and failures just make it right with the word amen you have the right you have the right to apply the blood amen you can apply the blood amen you have the blood you are the blood did you know you are the blood bride you are the blood by the spirit and you can apply the blood apply the token well that's a big statement amen that's walking with God though okay now he's the first of that creation you're another creation just like him he's the new race you are that race this he said is the true revelation of God that was his purpose Eternal purpose that's his heart purpose and this purpose took form through election seek as such to worship him that is why he looked down at the last stage when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God he saw himself in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to adoption of children that's a maturity according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his brother if he did not make sure all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass now if you want to read that as Ephesians 2 11. Amen in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will he said Hallelujah aren't you glad you belonged to him now he that he that the Bible said and you shall know the truth how do you know the truth by you by Union with him that's how you know the truth you are his workmanship you're in Union with him see he that's a new creature has passed away all things have become new see If he if you're in Christ all right now so he's standing Among Us fertilizing himself okay I'm just getting down here I want to get to something hear the Bible the bride is the Living Word In Action she's Hebrews 4 12 the word living and operative all right then Enoch Walking with God just keep walking add a testimony you have a testimony and we could give you scriptures on on how do you say He is we can go to first John 4 15 first John 5 1. First Corinthians 12 3 we believe that Jesus Christ is amen Isaiah 59 19 said when he when the when the pressure shall come on when the when the Satan shall come in like a flood he'll raise the standard against it you know what the prophet said about that he said are you one of them how many read that before okay are you one of them Isaiah 59 19 you'll raise the standard are you one of them are you the standard what is the standard the revealing of the word the revealing of the word you're a little there a little more and more more and more Revelation upon top of Revelation upon Revelation upon revelation all right are you the standard are you one of them see resisting what do you have to do first to resist him resistance is in two parts did you know that James 4 you know resistance is in two parts first what's the Bible say submit yourself to him submit yourself to God then what's it say and resist then resist the devil yo okay I'll read it okay James 4. verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to God period who is he he's the word so you submit yourself to the word how do you resist the devil it's written okay turn him down turn him down with what the word submit yourself to the word to God then the Bible says and then the in the same verse resist the devil and he will flee from you amen somebody seems to forget about that submitting yourself to God they just try to resist the devil you wonder why he doesn't go anywhere because you resist him by the word how did Jesus resist him it is written he was given himself completely to God and then resisted the devil okay now I'm just running over this I met talked about Matthew 16 confession Peter's confession what's your confession amen when you confess it see you confess the revelation confession of faith amen our headship then is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom of is the word of God made Spirit listen and life in your own life the kingdom of God is the word made spirit in you there is the true worshiper all right now and the word of God is one in this church today in that day it was the word in God one and today it's the word in God word and God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message who's redeemed the bride is the redeemed to make bring the message in the last day the voice and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again is Adam and Eve in the beginning in the garden the threefold mystery of God his body all right now we could read 14 Jesus said if you see me you've seen the father all right brother Brandon said a woman come to him and said why I can't I catch it brother Branham he said you and your wife are one just a minute brother Madam you and your wife were one and and because Philip well you know what let me just say this I'm not going to go into that because it takes too much I'll come I'll bring it to another time but he said do you see my wife no do you see me yes that's not what Jesus said when you see me you've seen the father so that is the Oneness is a different kind he said when you see me you've seen the father when you see the bride you see him when you see him you see the bride who are you seeing when you see him you're seeing the father who are the people seeing when they see you as the revelation of the hour they're seeing your salvation your father you're so your savior exactly same thing all right now so that's Saint John 14. it's a little wheel in the middle of the wheel I'm getting down to something I've got to get to before we leave okay now remember what brother Brown said and the message I can't read all this to you because it takes too much but on the message it is the rising of the sun he talked about Dynamics and mechanics okay he said you can have everything that Cadillac brand new seats out of dough skin soft leather soft and easy to set in leather and floorboards and plush and steering wheel nickel plated and diamond studs all over it and the were and the engine was mechanically tested be exactly in the right engine and the wheels and all the bed bearings greased up and the tires were puncture proof and blowout free and all have been tested scientifically or theologically or seminarily oh we got the word yeah the word oh oh the word's perfect yeah it is it is we acknowledge that is yeah but without the spark and look at what he said they had been pushed off the assembly line both of them both of them filled up with gasoline you know gasoline is a part of the mechanics it's the word but the brand makes it very clear the gasoline was the word the whole thing was the word but the gas is part of it fill it up with gas unless there's a spark there to manifest that power unless there's a power there to confirm that it's gasoline it might as well be water right all right now I'm not finished with it yet you say yeah about that all right brother I believe the spirit of God yes sir that's right and I do too we're both anointed the wheat and the seed are both Anointed with the same anointing no question about the Holy Ghost amen no question that's why you better be careful what you speak about the Holy Ghost because it can be on a weed don't you say nothing about that anointing and it can be absolutely the truth but they themselves are not the word and they're lost yet having the anointing you don't think that's the truth you need to go back and read annoyed once the end time and others that follow that yeah okay now he said we have put too much stress on the mechanics without the spirit it won't move it's the truth the word is the truth see see you how well you got your church set how much education you got how much Bible you uh Bible until that wave sheath until that Holy Ghost comes upon that person to make that word live the gasoline represents a word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move okay I think we we have too much we put too much stress in the mechanics and nothing on Dynamics it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ in the church to manifest and bring to pass that that's gasoline it might be in a gasoline can it could be still be water see but the only proof is it put the life on it it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not and when you try to put the holy spirit in a denomination or in a old skin amen old bottle then it's going to burst the bottle see see as much as you are trying you can get a splutter you'll ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon now I said oh I'm glad there's a ten thousand power octane power the word of God and the Holy Ghost to light it up spirit and Truth the resurrection resurrect the power of God into a man's life or woman's life you know or into a church that shoved that catalyte down the Cadillac down the road Yonder with a dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was waved over the people the day of Pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever but there has got to come now remember Pentecost is not I'm not talking about Pentecostal denomination here I'm talking about the Pentecostal experience you've got to have that but you don't go back and still trying to get it you've got it you just need to start feeding on the word promise that came beyond that amen into the seed itself the ends when you conceive all right now he said but now watch now you say well that's good Hallelujah I got the Holy Spirit that's good that's good brother Brown said he said now it was waived over the people okay it's been waived over us again today you know that I can't I don't have time to read all the rising of the Sun but there's got to come one there has to come a real bride there must come one brother Brown remember that messenger pointed to the point of the people to a word-born bride why because it was the promised word for this hour foreign then he pointed that bride what how did it happen because he pointed the bride remember it's word born he pointed the bride to the said there's the lamb John was on Earth at the time of his coming what about this messenger he also is on Earth that time is coming and said I've I've introduced you to him I must decrease he must increase say well brother Dave what's the Turning of the corner it turned from his Prophecy from the prophet excuse me to his prophecy foreign so we are his prophecy manifested amen now he said now he said one that one then this bride has not only the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live and move in the power of the Resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to have her a facelift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamic Senate no matter how much mechanics prove to be right there's got to be Dynamics to make it work okay I'm coming to something I'm closing okay I didn't say I'm closing this right now but I'm closing I know I'm way over time excuse me but I only have about every well I won't go there okay If he if he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ stiff cold stiff and dead in the grave shaken to life and rise again because I live you live also and do it take away the stone I am he that was dead so dead the son said good dead the moon said he was dead the star said his dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize he's alive again he was only the he was only he not only the mechanics God's word he was a Dynamics to prove it so is the bride not only is she the mechanics of God's word but she is the Dynamics to prove it okay now watch I'm coming down here now be ready and he being the groom the bride has to come forth It's a part of him it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of revelation of all others that spoke of the Bride she could be only the manifestation it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power is power she is him as men and women are one and woman taken the from his side she had taken the spirit not another Spirit his spirit from him a flesh from his side made her both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together put it together made mechanics and Dynamics now watch this until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride amen John he said if said I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics in this mechanics and the world will not be able to withstand it I'll raise him up again in the last day now watch that's the Easter message the Dynamics and mechanics together watch what he said right here you say yeah brother David we have to have the spirit on the word but you can have the spirit and not the word also okay watch what he says the mechanics without the Dynamics no good neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics no good okay I'm closing he said you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around the Pistons are just cranking got the spirit there but no gasoline to fire it off you see what he just said you've got the spark brother said now that was Pentecost they had the spark the Baptist had the word but if you ever get the two together is that what he said okay he said a bit if you can have the spark you can have the gasoline but no fire but you can have the fire and no gas you if you have the fire but if the gasoline isn't there Nothing's Gonna fire off now you see how it balanced you're not over balancing it over here you're taking both the word without the Dynamics no good and the Dynamics without the word no good now you see what he's seeking himself to live it's himself that he quickens okay now all right it'll only work as they come together so one will set still and the other one will go up right now even one setting still the others in Heavenly places one's going to set still and the other will be changed and the body changed and still be the other left here you see what I mean that's what he's saying okay because if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you Jesus the word all right if Jesus the word was raised from the dead if that spirit's in you now what brother Brown say not only will he take you out of the grave and Quicken your body then but he said now he said it'll bring your body mortal flesh subject to his word if that word and Spirit Come Together he's going to bring your body subject to that word now right amen that's Romans 8 11. I'm thankful for your patience just listen and I'm closing I am really truly oh you say brother Branham false prophets the Bible said in the last days there'd be false prophets Jesus said be false Christ okay I want to go here um yeah I'm sorry yeah this is in the message this is in the message uh leadership 1965 first one next to the last communion was the last message all right he said they cannot stand chastisement our bastard David cannot stand chastisement or bastard children why don't you stand with me and I'll just I'll let me finish right here they cannot stand chastise they that cannot stand correction or chastisement are bastard children remember those that he loves he corrects but you that can't stand that correction are bastard children and not the children of God seed see they are worked up on the emotion see the seed that I talked about a while ago that Soul watch what he says now listen carefully I know it's at the end but listen the seed that I talked about a while ago that Soul wasn't there to start with it was anointed with the spirit now watch what he's saying what was anointed he done all kinds of of signs or you say and then he stops he says when your spirit's anointed he said and it's the real genuine Holy Spirit now there's many other quotes on this where brother Brown said your spirit can be Anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit but that soul is not the seed okay he said he said now he said when your spirit little s Spirits anointed he said it's a real genuine Holy Ghost and you could still be a devil see I'm bringing this to the climax where these two have to come together okay if you don't see that in your life you're missing something you're missing one to the other amen I believe the word I believe the word and be genuinely a a fundamental believer like Balaam and Anointed with the spirit genuine holy ghost in your spirit can miss the truth and you can have the spirit in your spirit and not have any word no word at all and prophesy and cast out devils and shout and dance and and just as religious as you can be in all the kinds of emotions and actions but no revelation of the word for the season can't see your position amen now false prophets in the last days will be see he's false prophets the Bible said in the last days there'd be false prophets Jesus said there'd be false Christ now what do you mean by false Christ false they're Anointed with the genuine Holy Ghost but their faults on the inside okay false teachers false Christ not false jesuses would say I I'm anointed I'm anointed no question about being the anointing but we know you're not Jesus you can't say I'm Jesus because that was the very Temple are you with me yeah all right now not false jesuses now nobody stands still for that false Christ means the anointed one anointed ones excuse me once plural he said they are anointed but they are false at the bottom of it and do great signs and wonders speak in tongues that's the spirit preach the gospel Judas Iscariot did it caiaphasis prophesied Balaam the hypocrite done signs prophesied it was true star shall rise out of Jacob yep see see everything all the religious moves but you see but see you put a kuckleberry seed in a wheat seed in the same bed and pour water down on them and anoint them they'll both rejoice they'll both grow and brother sister don't you even think for a minute I don't believe in dancing and shouting I don't but you better have the word there amen that's all you want shout as the holy spirit moves on to shouting I believe you'll amen you don't have to pump you up to say Amen we don't have to pump you up pump you up I'm going to pump you up to get you to shout we have to pump you up to say Amen we have to pump you up to get revelation if we do that we got Pentecostal denomination all right The Sun Shines on the just the unjust and the rain falls under just the unjust but see The Sun Shines on them rain falls sun and water until the the unjust is coming to maturity and we see it those that are have the spirit see it and I mean the spirit of the word see it true worshipers are worshiping where God put his name I bypass that here but he said brother Graham said I'll tell you where his name is name is in his bride it's his body he said that's where he put his name her name is Mrs Jesus he said that's that's his that's his place of worship it's his body it's himself he says there's only one place that's in Jesus Christ amen amen they'll come to me in that day and say Lord he said the water falls into just the unjust bring both the maturity they have to manifest the fruit that's why they come right down amongst the message hey this is where the rain's being poured out the Sun's shining now see they gotta see and you say well he said they'll prophesy he'll come to me in that day say Lord have not we cast out Devils have not I prophesied have not I've done Great Mighty things in your name he'll say workers you workers of iniquity what is Iniquity knowing to do good knowing what's right you've tasted it you were enlightened to it you've tasted the good word of God and then turn away from it and don't see it and reject it oh you tasted it though you were enlightened in it tasted the good word made partakers of the Holy Ghost it fell you rejoiced just as loud as the rest but no Revelation and then what are you going to do an intellectual conception won't hold and you'll go right downstairs and question the message and question the word and begin to fall with the ministry of the truth no more repentance see it's done finished all right have not I done great things in your name have not we prophesied cast out Devils depart for me I don't even know you go into eternal hell that's been prepared for the devil as Angels you see what a word falsely Worship in vain worshiping in vain striving in vain Heavenly Father as we bow our heads before you to realize I've taken a lot of time and it wasn't me Lord you know I believe this is exactly what you desired yeah we may be tired in our flesh yeah we may be saying in our backs hurting and our legs hurting and this certain the net hurting but Lord are we gonna let something like that stop and stand in our way and make that a God over us and our own physical beings instead of listening to what you'd have to say to us by the word we have all afternoon what are we going to do oh God you are God that's all there is to it this is life this is Rich let us be true worshipers Lord there's here those that Lord may be haven't made that connection then they hurting the voice say come come don't delay come now Heavenly Father this has gone in record I'll have to meet it again someday every one of these that I've spoken to I will meet at the judgment and I will give an answer to what was spoken [Music] and Lord I Thank you for the truth for you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free oh I'm so glad Lord that there's a people this day that know you what a resurrection this is I rejoice in it now and commit these things to you in Jesus Christ's name amen we'll walk in the light first John 1 5 said we walk in the lightest he is in the light amen amen we'll walk in the Lightroom we'll walk in the light walk where the Dew drops of Mercy our bride shine all around us [Music] why not oh Jesus the light on the world verse 1. all ye Saints of Life
