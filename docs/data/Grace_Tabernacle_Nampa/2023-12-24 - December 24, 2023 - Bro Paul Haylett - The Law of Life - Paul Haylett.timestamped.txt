[37:22] sometimes don't think we're much but
[37:25] when we recognize
[37:27] that you must be
[37:29] something to be the house of the Living
[37:32] God not a historical God I remember just
[37:37] always you know sometimes profound
[37:39] things happen in your life and when we
[37:41] were in
[37:42] Israel and when you get the full context
[37:45] of when Jesus asked
[37:47] them who do you say I am and that's
[37:51] right you're right there and here's the
[37:52] tombs of all of these Gods all their all
[37:55] their dwelling Dwelling Places and you
[37:58] stand there it's all ruins now but at
[38:00] one time history gives a very clear
[38:03] picture that each one had his house and
[38:05] Jesus is standing there once he's told
[38:07] them I don't even have a place to lay my
[38:09] head they're not going to build one of
[38:12] these for
[38:13] me but who do you say I am that's it
[38:17] that's right and we can stand there just
[38:19] as it would be if God allowed us to go
[38:21] back in that time and we know what we
[38:24] would say that's exactly we know we
[38:26] wouldn't be pointing somewhere else but
[38:28] we would be looking at him and we would
[38:31] know who we were in Jesus Christ and I'm
[38:35] thankful today amen just visiting with a
[38:38] a minister brother a pastor and and he
[38:41] was just expressing to me the other day

[39:55] for the talent within it
[40:00] Hallelujah we've been blessed amen uh
[40:03] it's not my brother and sister a natural
[40:05] Talent of a voice but it's the the voice
[40:08] that is coming from within amen if you
[40:12] understand what I'm saying it's what's
[40:13] coming from the heart is what makes this
[40:15] a beautiful thing to be rejoicing over
[40:18] it it's not a natural Talent you can
[40:20] take almost anyone I'm told and train
[40:22] them to be able to sing they did that
[40:25] with a mon
[40:28] but you see for something to come from
[40:30] the heart that's it to be able to
[40:32] express that's right amen hallelujah how
[40:36] wonderful I want to um give a little
[40:39] clarification to next weekend we'll have
[40:41] Sunday morning
[40:43] service uh and a regular time then uh
[40:48] Sunday evening here at the
[40:50] church if you want to Fellowship more
[40:52] you need to come a little earlier so
[40:55] we're setting the time at 6 but you're
[40:57] more than welcome to come at
[40:59] 5: 5:30 whatever you want to do
[41:03] somewhere in the 7:30
[41:05] range we're going to have a h a
[41:09] service and um then um about 8:30 we're
[41:14] going to have
[41:15] communion and uh I've made a decision
[41:18] and I hope you're not disappointed with
[41:19] it that uh we will have communion and uh
[41:23] no foot washing and so in that time
[41:26] we'll uh celebrate around the word of
[41:29] God we'll have uh some things that I
[41:32] don't want to announce right now that
[41:33] we'll take place and we'll have
[41:36] communion and then how you choose to
[41:38] spend the rest of your Sunday evening we
[41:40] will leave in your hands uh we may just
[41:44] after communion sing for a few hours
[41:47] whatever is your heart's
[41:50] desires amen so I would like you this
[41:54] morning once again again on the thought
[41:56] of the contrast of the two Natures I
[41:59] want you this morning to look at the law
[42:02] of life and um as I speak today there
[42:07] might be some things that uh at first
[42:10] you might question a for a moment uh but
[42:14] you'll uh I trust have patience with me
[42:17] as we turn in our Bibles to 2
[42:19] Corinthians the 10th chapter verses
[42:22] 1-5 and uh it is here my brother and
[42:26] sister that God is always working on our
[42:29] behalf and many times we find that the
[42:32] word being
[42:33] preached uh is not anything new but it
[42:36] comes to us from a direction maybe we
[42:39] hadn't thought or saw or been expounded
[42:42] but we wish know that it's always the
[42:45] word of God I believe the ministry here
[42:46] in the church with all of my heart has
[42:49] no more desire than to preach the pure
[42:51] word of God we don't have an agenda we
[42:54] don't have a side thought uh just the
[42:57] pure word amen 2 Corinthians the 10th
[43:01] chapter now I Paul beeech you by the
[43:05] meekness and gentleness of Christ who in
[43:09] presence and base among you but being
[43:11] absent and bold toward you but I beseech
[43:15] you that I may not be bold when I am
[43:18] present with that confidence wherewith I
[43:21] think to be bold against some which
[43:23] think of us as if we walked according to
[43:26] the
[43:27] Flesh and my brother and sister we're
[43:29] seeing what he was speaking to the
[43:31] Corinthians coming to pass once
[43:35] again people believe that it's just
[43:38] being spoken from the
[43:40] Flesh and um sometimes you know people
[43:42] would think well I think the preacher is
[43:44] preaching towards me but you see if you
[43:47] catch the Revelation that Paul was
[43:50] speaking to the Corinthians it is not I
[43:53] but Christ in me that's right and so you
[43:57] know the old phrase I'm I'm sorry
[43:59] sometimes just being you know a farm kid
[44:02] comes to life but seriously if the shoe
[44:04] fits wear it that's true if it doesn't
[44:07] fit it wasn't intended for you that's
[44:10] right and you know we can make it
[44:16] fit force
[44:18] it or we can decide it simply doesn't
[44:22] fit and Skip right over it but truly
[44:25] let's just take the position if it fits
[44:28] Lord let it come to life in me amen
[44:33] that's
[44:35] right to be bold think as if we walked
[44:39] according to the
[44:41] Flesh and that's actually Saints don't
[44:43] mean to keep you standing but that's
[44:45] actually a great Revelation because if
[44:47] we're here
[44:48] today in the flesh we're going to have
[44:51] disappointments the preacher is going to
[44:53] say this or that the service is too long
[44:56] whatever the flesh but at some point in
[44:59] time we got to realize that God's called
[45:01] us Beyond flesh that's right he's called
[45:04] us Beyond how we feel sir right you know
[45:09] I love the little story a brother shared
[45:10] with me one time and and um present
[45:14] company um be kind with
[45:18] me but a special service and the brother
[45:21] that's preaching us the one that shared
[45:22] it with me and he says he looks in the
[45:24] third row and here's a young lady that's
[45:26] just dressed in a certain fashion and he
[45:29] was just like oh my oh my oh
[45:32] my and partway through the service the
[45:35] Holy Spirit dealt with him and said
[45:36] speak on this and he's like I'll offend
[45:39] them the Holy Spirit Come and said speak
[45:43] and he spoke at the end of the service
[45:45] he thought well we probably probably you
[45:49] know DET them the next service the next
[45:52] night they've moved up a
[45:54] row
[45:56] and in that service the Lord speaks to
[45:58] him says speak and he
[46:00] speaks and he's once again in the
[46:04] flesh thinking that would be too much
[46:08] but on Sunday morning they were on the
[46:11] front row and before that service was
[46:13] over they were in the
[46:15] altar you see God knows what he's doing
[46:17] that's right let's not try to put mind
[46:20] around this and look at this according
[46:23] to our
[46:24] flesh there is a plan of God and we are
[46:27] here to fulfill that plan for the
[46:29] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[46:32] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[46:34] down of
[46:35] strongholds casting down imaginations
[46:37] and every High thing that exalts itself
[46:40] against the knowledge of God bringing
[46:42] into
[46:44] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[46:48] of Christ that's right Heavenly Father
[46:50] we just ask you Lord Jesus today Lord as
[46:53] these things you've laid upon our heart
[46:55] father let let us manifest that speak
[46:57] that father but let it not just be words
[46:59] Lord let us bring it into an action
[47:02] that's father that we can step up and
[47:05] step out into a higher Kingdom father we
[47:09] thank you for this day bless each and
[47:10] everyone that is here Lord in the
[47:13] precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[47:15] God bless you you may be
[47:22] seated you know in the world today and I
[47:25] do not say this
[47:27] judgmentally in the world today people
[47:29] Express how they are so happy that we
[47:32] are no longer under the law and
[47:35] naturally and spiritually my brother and
[47:37] sister there are laws that are in us
[47:40] there is uh laws that control life and
[47:44] you look at this my brother and sister
[47:46] that uh I I know this might not be a
[47:49] Perfect Analogy but there is a certain
[47:51] law that would declare that in the body
[47:53] of man uh you need the heart to move the
[47:57] blood and it doesn't matter how much
[47:59] oxygen is in the air if the heart is not
[48:01] functioning not moving the blood then
[48:04] your life is finished and that could be
[48:07] then also that your heart could beat
[48:09] strongly and if there's no Oxygen your
[48:12] life is finished it could be that you
[48:14] could be injured in such a fashion that
[48:16] if there's not a signal coming from your
[48:18] brain that your heart will beat in what
[48:21] they call sympathy for a period of time
[48:25] sometimes s they have recorded even a
[48:27] heartbeating for minutes when a person
[48:30] should not have life at all in them but
[48:33] ultimately the law of Life dictates what
[48:36] happens and so it is there that uh these
[48:40] laws within us are controlling life we
[48:43] we need water amen and we need food and
[48:47] we need all of these things they're all
[48:49] ingredients we can give substitutes
[48:52] often times we'll see a person in the
[48:54] hospital might be receiving as what you
[48:57] might say is a substitute they're being
[48:59] fed through a tube or uh you know
[49:01] different things like that would be on
[49:04] uh oxygen uh intubated or whatever it
[49:07] might be and uh these laws are in us but
[49:10] each one of these laws ultimately is
[49:12] controlling life and in verse three it
[49:15] says though we walk in the flesh we do
[49:17] not war after the Flesh and I just I
[49:20] don't want to be rude this morning but
[49:22] my brother and sister I I believe I
[49:24] could speak with confidence not
[49:26] judgmentally that each one of us today
[49:29] we still have a segment of us I believe
[49:32] we're Sons and Daughters of God Can
[49:34] someone say Amen we were called to a
[49:36] high calling but each one of us is still
[49:39] laboring walking in the flesh and we are
[49:42] there and you'd say oh how do I overcome
[49:44] this flesh well my brother and sister
[49:47] we'll we'll by God's grace touch on this
[49:50] but you see while we're walking in this
[49:52] flesh our vision of who we are should be
[49:55] higher than this flesh it should be a
[49:57] place that we would look at this flesh
[49:59] and be able to say with all honesty Lord
[50:02] I have sinned forgive me I have come
[50:05] short of the glory of God forgive me but
[50:08] you see there should not be a war there
[50:11] and while I would some would say well
[50:13] there needs to be sometimes a a conflict
[50:16] within us to move us yes but my brother
[50:19] and sister not a war because in war
[50:22] there is destruction and when Satan can
[50:24] come and cause you to look at yourself
[50:27] as unworthy then how do you go out your
[50:30] door in the morning if you in your heart
[50:33] in your spirit believe I'm unworthy when
[50:36] Satan throws it in front of you it tends
[50:38] to be a nature such as well I'm already
[50:41] unworthy does this matter but when we
[50:44] can come to a place to recognize as Sons
[50:46] and Daughters of God that we are walking
[50:49] here in this flesh but we're not Waring
[50:51] after this flesh and you know the fight
[50:54] against our flesh you know my brother
[50:56] and sister often times you'll see this
[50:58] as you deal uh maybe with young people
[51:01] well old people let's just say people
[51:03] amen you know they think if I stop doing
[51:06] this or I start doing that amen that
[51:09] that that would be what makes the
[51:11] difference you know we try to constrain
[51:14] our flesh my brother and sister you
[51:17] cannot constrain the flesh the flesh
[51:20] just like the tongue is an unwieldy
[51:23] monster it has certain things about it
[51:26] that must it must be fulfilled it tells
[51:29] itself I can't live without but my
[51:31] brother and sister you can constrain the
[51:33] Flesh and force it into
[51:37] subjection are you with me you can force
[51:40] the flesh into
[51:42] subjection and at a Sur surface surface
[51:45] level let me put it this way because I
[51:47] don't want you to take this as a deep
[51:49] thought but if we are going to force the
[51:51] flesh into subjection we're not much
[51:54] different than a Buddhist
[51:59] punk I wasn't called to be a Buddhist
[52:02] monk you weren't called to be Buddhist
[52:04] monks
[52:06] amen so I I don't even want to be in a
[52:10] comparison you know sleep on a stone bed
[52:13] because you're not worthy eat bread and
[52:16] water because you're not worthy no heat
[52:18] in your room because you're not
[52:21] worthy that will not redeem the soul
[52:24] amen
[52:26] amen you could live in the comfort of
[52:29] this world in the Natural Things my
[52:30] brother and sister and you could believe
[52:33] that that must be what you were called
[52:35] to be but I'm telling you whether you
[52:37] are hot or cold whether you are rich or
[52:40] poor it's a substance that's been poured
[52:43] into your soul is what makes that
[52:45] difference and without that my brother
[52:47] and sister the battle the war goes
[52:52] on now as we look here
[52:56] I think it's safe to say we've been
[52:57] called to another level would you agree
[53:00] with me you know as I was putting these
[53:03] thoughts to paper I I I didn't put it on
[53:06] on the deal but you know look at this my
[53:09] brother and sister I've never been a a
[53:10] video game person in fact I personally
[53:14] this is just Paul personal right don't
[53:16] want to make a big stand on that but I
[53:18] personally think they're one of the most
[53:20] clever things that Satan has ever
[53:24] invented uh people kill steal destroy
[53:28] but it's only a
[53:30] game but if good Christian Youth would
[53:33] spend that much time in the word of God
[53:36] my they would actually be building
[53:38] something exactly right they would
[53:41] actually have something they could lay
[53:42] their hands on but you see in the video
[53:45] world you know you must perform certain
[53:48] things to move to the next level and I
[53:51] remember when I was a young man maybe
[53:52] the reason I don't like video games is
[53:54] cuz I'm a failure at playing them and
[53:58] back in the days when it was just
[53:59] asteroids do any of you know what
[54:01] asteroids was amen it might be look at
[54:04] this you guys are in rarified
[54:09] country asteroids is simplest of all
[54:12] video games and I never made it past
[54:15] level
[54:16] two and if you don't know what level two
[54:19] is that's basically down Sammy and
[54:22] Dean's
[54:23] level so you look at this my brother and
[54:26] sister maybe I never went there because
[54:28] I wasn't any good at it but maybe I
[54:30] never went there because God didn't
[54:32] allow me to be good at
[54:35] it and as we come and recognizing now I
[54:38] make that to make a point and I hope it
[54:40] makes sense to you you see we must
[54:42] realize that we cannot take ourselves to
[54:45] the next level right it must be Christ
[54:48] in US it must be revelation of the holy
[54:51] spirit that moves us to be able to step
[54:54] into a realm we have never before
[54:57] habitated a place we have never been
[54:59] before in our life and God takes us
[55:03] there it's not what we can do but what
[55:05] he has done amen and so we've been
[55:08] called to this nether level amen what is
[55:12] this level it's a manifested level we
[55:15] can talk about the word of God all we
[55:16] want we can say well you know if we have
[55:19] the Holy Ghost we'll do this and we'll
[55:21] do that and we can do this and I can
[55:23] overcome that but my brother and sister
[55:25] all the overcoming that is within you
[55:27] came from Christ it is not you amen it's
[55:31] him in you and so what happens is is God
[55:35] comes down pouring in the Holy Spirit
[55:38] and we're not going to put this as it is
[55:39] we talked about faith by measure the
[55:41] other day my brother and sister we're
[55:44] we're not going to come and and start to
[55:46] try and put some quantification that if
[55:48] I can get here I'll get this I get here
[55:50] I get this I get here I get here oh my
[55:53] brother and sister what we got to do is
[55:55] get in Christ amen and when we get in
[55:58] him amen we're coming to a manifested
[56:00] level does that make sense to you amen
[56:03] they're coming to a level that the flesh
[56:07] is less important to you than living in
[56:10] the spirit amen and it's at that place
[56:13] right there we're slowly able to look at
[56:16] the failures of this flesh right here we
[56:19] don't want these failures can we say
[56:20] Amen to that but when you do have that
[56:24] it doesn't have the impact on your life
[56:26] Brother David hit right in that vein we
[56:29] come here without condemnation
[56:31] today why because we're not living by
[56:33] the flesh any longer we're moving into
[56:36] the spirit realm and God is manifesting
[56:39] that in us because we still have our
[56:42] challenges is that a fair way to put it
[56:45] we still have our challenges and it's
[56:48] not that we just look over our
[56:49] challenges though it never existed but
[56:52] we realize that's not really me that's
[56:54] it amen I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter
[56:57] of God that's not really me and Satan
[57:00] you might be the accuser but you're
[57:02] accusing the wrong one amen the one
[57:05] you're accusing amen is the one that's
[57:08] living by the Holy Ghost amen and you
[57:11] have been vanquished amen the devil
[57:14] never admit he's defeated that's
[57:18] right he will never admit he's defeated
[57:22] but I tell you if we saw a Clear Vision
[57:25] that's it of the devil he wouldn't be a
[57:28] roaring lion right the scripture says he
[57:30] came as a roaring lion he's got the
[57:33] megaphone but if you saw him face to
[57:36] face he would be a toothless almost
[57:40] voiceless adversary to
[57:43] you yeah
[57:47] amen hallelujah amen that's right but
[57:51] you
[57:52] see this Living Word this man ested
[57:55] level is a living word amen uh Christ
[57:57] Living in us today it it should not even
[58:00] be a second guess for us we should be
[58:03] able to say absolutely without a doubt I
[58:06] know he is living Can someone say Amen
[58:08] this morning he's living in
[58:10] me and I know he's living in you cuz if
[58:13] he wasn't you wouldn't be here you would
[58:15] be there that's
[58:17] right but he's here he's in this
[58:20] building this morning by promise that's
[58:23] it amen he made vow to us where two or
[58:26] three are gathered together I will be in
[58:29] their midst amen well I'll take my
[58:31] brother and sister without going outside
[58:33] of the boundaries of scripture and tell
[58:35] you we one son or daughter of God filled
[58:37] with the Holy Ghost believing every word
[58:39] of God for their day is standing then
[58:42] God is right there amen I'm not
[58:44] circumventing two or three but I'm
[58:46] telling you it comes down a holy Coast
[58:50] filled believer is a majority that's
[58:52] right amen amen we don't have to to
[58:54] count numbers we just have to count
[58:56] what's in us that's it and when we know
[58:59] what's in us then we know where we stand
[59:01] that's it Hallelujah for the weapons of
[59:03] our Warfare are not
[59:05] carnal now my brother and sister we look
[59:08] in the world
[59:09] today and all the politics and
[59:12] everything that's going on all of that
[59:15] is just fulfilling
[59:17] scripture we can sit here today and say
[59:21] but what about this and what about that
[59:23] and what's going to happen my brother
[59:24] sister the bride's going to be
[59:26] gone that's right it's just that simple
[59:30] that's right before they can drop a bomb
[59:32] the bride's going to be gone that's
[59:33] right God didn't have you judge yourself
[59:36] now to judge you again that's right amen
[59:39] he has you judge yourself by the word
[59:41] today and that word is our very
[59:44] Deliverance that's our very life it's
[59:46] our deliverance today and I think
[59:48] sometimes we need to maybe go when no
[59:50] one's in the house no one's in the car
[59:53] just look in a mirror and say I am a Son
[59:55] of God I am a daughter of God and you
[59:57] need to repeat those things until
[59:59] yourself you yourself believe it because
[1:00:03] the word's already declared it amen it's
[1:00:05] just now time for us to believe
[1:00:07] it
[1:00:09] amen our our Warfare is not
[1:00:12] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:00:14] pulling down of
[1:00:16] strongholds I'll tell you what my
[1:00:17] brother and sister we can have
[1:00:20] strongholds in our life without even
[1:00:21] recognizing them being a
[1:00:23] stronghold right now this all ties
[1:00:26] together right here casting down
[1:00:28] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:00:31] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[1:00:33] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:00:35] thought to The Obedience of Christ
[1:00:38] that's right now let's look at this for
[1:00:39] a minute our Warfare is not carnal so
[1:00:42] you're not going to take this flesh and
[1:00:44] cause this flesh to make you
[1:00:46] Victorious but you come and it's mighty
[1:00:49] through God to the pulling down of
[1:00:51] stronghold I want to ask you this
[1:00:53] morning you don't need to speak it out
[1:00:55] loud it would be completely unnecessary
[1:00:56] to have it named but you need to stop
[1:00:59] and find the strongholds in your life
[1:01:02] and it doesn't mean they're
[1:01:06] sin that's right that's
[1:01:10] right we can preface almost everything
[1:01:13] that we speak with I'm not
[1:01:15] worthy what are you really
[1:01:19] saying it's not news to God that's right
[1:01:27] you standing here today and saying I'm
[1:01:29] not worthy the reason I'm not doing this
[1:01:31] this and this is because I'm not worthy
[1:01:33] God knew that and he called you
[1:01:36] anyhow he's trying to move you anyhow
[1:01:39] amen because he knows if you will move
[1:01:42] you'll manifest amen and as we move we
[1:01:45] manifest amen so what's happening here
[1:01:48] these strongholds must be pulled
[1:01:53] down amen and cast down our
[1:01:57] imaginations now I don't know if this
[1:01:59] one will apply to any of you but in
[1:02:02] years ago there's a stage of my life
[1:02:06] that I wanted to go to church but I
[1:02:08] didn't want to go to
[1:02:10] church I didn't want the preacher
[1:02:12] talking about me every sermon he always
[1:02:15] talked about
[1:02:17] me constantly talking about
[1:02:22] me I didn't want ago I didn't want to
[1:02:25] hear about it I already know what my
[1:02:27] problems are preacher you don't have to
[1:02:29] tell me what my problems
[1:02:31] are and so what I would do is I would
[1:02:33] sit in
[1:02:35] church and I would fix my
[1:02:38] problems I would let my
[1:02:40] imagination go over now why is this like
[1:02:45] this
[1:02:48] oh maybe there was a few misunderstood
[1:02:51] amens in church cuz when I figured out
[1:02:54] out why that tractor wasn't running
[1:02:56] right
[1:03:01] amen but you see my
[1:03:06] imagination aren't you glad you have an
[1:03:11] imagination in the right place the right
[1:03:14] time used for the right reason a
[1:03:17] wonderful
[1:03:18] thing the wrong time the wrong place the
[1:03:21] wrong reason is a tool of the devil
[1:03:24] that's right so we can't say today that
[1:03:27] our imagination is evil or sinful or you
[1:03:30] shouldn't have
[1:03:32] one but as he's speaking to the
[1:03:36] Corinthians he's telling them cast down
[1:03:39] your
[1:03:42] imaginations and those who heard those
[1:03:44] words and even heard those words today
[1:03:46] knew exactly what he was talking about
[1:03:48] now imaginations we don't want to go off
[1:03:50] into the sinful side of it but my
[1:03:52] brother sister I have seen people this
[1:03:55] is a true
[1:03:57] story they had this vivid imagination
[1:04:00] that when I win the lottery all my
[1:04:02] problems are going to be fixed and they
[1:04:04] dwelt on that for so long that they
[1:04:06] started secretly spending the family
[1:04:08] money on lottery tickets until they
[1:04:11] bankrupted their
[1:04:12] family still never won a
[1:04:15] lottery but the imagination of what they
[1:04:18] would do with the wealth let's stop for
[1:04:21] a moment what would you do with that
[1:04:22] much money
[1:04:25] I say that with humor you'd pay your
[1:04:28] ties first
[1:04:34] right but you see where Spirits like
[1:04:36] that take you yeah that's right that
[1:04:38] anointing takes you until pretty soon
[1:04:42] you wouldn't be giving your tithe and
[1:04:43] offering to the church you'd be buying
[1:04:45] lottery tickets believing it was just a
[1:04:47] deferred action that later you could
[1:04:49] come back and offer the church a pile of
[1:04:52] money wickness
[1:04:55] let me throw it out even more
[1:04:57] direct a friend of mine dealt with this
[1:05:00] in his church that a brother come and
[1:05:02] said I had a dream a vision last night
[1:05:07] okay brother what the Lord spoke to me
[1:05:11] and told me I've been married to the
[1:05:13] wrong woman for 20
[1:05:16] years and a day later a sister come and
[1:05:19] said the Lord come to me last night and
[1:05:21] said I've been married to the wrong
[1:05:23] husband for however many
[1:05:25] years and it manifests and they leave
[1:05:27] their spouses and they go off together
[1:05:29] because this was God that had told
[1:05:33] them their marriage didn't even last a
[1:05:35] year right what was that a vain
[1:05:43] imagination now we won't dwell on those
[1:05:45] things any further but my brother and
[1:05:47] sister you see if we do not put these
[1:05:50] things in their correct place every High
[1:05:54] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:05:56] knowledge of
[1:05:58] God aren't you glad for personal
[1:06:00] revelation yes I thank God so much for
[1:06:04] personal revelation but when personal
[1:06:06] revelation becomes your Revelation and
[1:06:09] not in the context of God giving it to
[1:06:11] you but it becomes yours connected
[1:06:14] directly with vain
[1:06:17] imagination it suddenly becomes your
[1:06:19] view of what God meant my brother and
[1:06:21] sister won't go into it but years ago we
[1:06:24] saw a man that we knew quite well pull
[1:06:26] off draw many people into this movement
[1:06:30] that he had and he had even the the the
[1:06:33] uh uh same sword that was given and the
[1:06:37] prophet was placed in his hand showing
[1:06:39] he had supreme authority of the word and
[1:06:42] deceived my brother and sister and
[1:06:44] destroyed marriage and marriage and
[1:06:47] marriage and marriage just going right
[1:06:48] down the line some of you'll know who
[1:06:50] I'm talking about my brother and sister
[1:06:52] as you'll look at that you see what it
[1:06:53] comes from a vain imagination have we
[1:06:56] all had and and I trust that we do
[1:06:58] experience the supernatural I pray every
[1:07:01] one of us amen at a time in our life
[1:07:03] we'll be able to say I have experienced
[1:07:06] the
[1:07:06] supernatural but it must fit the word
[1:07:09] that's right it won't be God speaking if
[1:07:11] it doesn't fit the
[1:07:13] word amen every thought to be in
[1:07:16] Obedience of Christ so we can get caught
[1:07:19] up in all kinds of thoughts but let me
[1:07:20] just bring this back around because this
[1:07:22] really fits where I'm at today we can
[1:07:24] have these things these vain
[1:07:26] imaginations we can have all of these
[1:07:28] things that come and they're run ack
[1:07:30] Satan's there're anointing it amen and
[1:07:32] it's there my brother and sister we can
[1:07:34] believe that that must be for someone
[1:07:36] else this message and the Revelation the
[1:07:39] full expression of the Revelation would
[1:07:41] be for someone else and we never even
[1:07:43] try to attain to it because we believe
[1:07:46] the very thing that Satan anoints our
[1:07:48] mind to
[1:07:50] believe and God's calling us to a higher
[1:07:53] level that's right man I miss sister Sue
[1:07:55] this morning pray for her she doesn't
[1:07:57] feel well but look at this my brother
[1:08:00] and sister you see you're not
[1:08:03] sinning you're not down in the corner
[1:08:05] you're not here you're not whatever but
[1:08:08] you're not going to move into the
[1:08:10] fullness of the Revelation for this hour
[1:08:12] that God has given to the bride because
[1:08:14] you're going to believe that's always
[1:08:15] for someone more spiritual than
[1:08:19] you and God wants you to believe what he
[1:08:21] said that's right not how you compare
[1:08:24] there's no graph there's no Matrix
[1:08:27] there's nothing out there I compare like
[1:08:29] here my brother and sister the word of
[1:08:31] God shows each and every one of us that
[1:08:33] we're unworthy that's right but by Grace
[1:08:36] Can someone say by Grace by Grace amen
[1:08:40] by his Precious Blood we've been
[1:08:42] elevated into a place of the family of
[1:08:44] God into a place that he called us to
[1:08:47] not our Merit but Satan that liar is a
[1:08:51] clever
[1:08:52] one
[1:08:56] Philippians
[1:08:57] 4:8 says finally brother now let me just
[1:09:01] isolate this just a little bit if you
[1:09:03] don't mind just to make a point we've
[1:09:05] been over everything and everything and
[1:09:07] we've talked about everything and we've
[1:09:09] tried to convince you of everything and
[1:09:11] we've looked through this and looked
[1:09:12] through that but finally my
[1:09:16] brethren okay don't take that as an
[1:09:18] absolute interpretation on the scripture
[1:09:20] finally brother whatsoever things are
[1:09:23] true whatsoever things are honest
[1:09:25] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:09:28] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:09:31] lovely whatever things are of good
[1:09:33] report if there be any virtue if there
[1:09:36] be any praise think on these things amen
[1:09:41] did you hear about brother so and so
[1:09:43] sister so and so the so and so family
[1:09:45] did you hear about this did you hear
[1:09:46] about this church here my brother and
[1:09:48] sister those things don't bring no
[1:09:50] benefit to us amen they're no blessing
[1:09:53] to us
[1:09:54] all it is is Satan's way to throw a
[1:09:57] bunch of glitter and a bunch of garbage
[1:09:59] in your mind you know they figured out
[1:10:02] years ago when we got into the realm of
[1:10:03] missile Warfare and they started
[1:10:06] applying this to jet fighters when a
[1:10:09] missile would be fired at them they
[1:10:11] would reach over and toggle a switch and
[1:10:13] it started kicking out uh uh bundles of
[1:10:17] aluminum foil and on the radar of the
[1:10:20] plane that was uh seeking that or the
[1:10:22] missile that was seeking them it become
[1:10:24] a bunch of clutter that was there and
[1:10:27] the radar say this is it and start to go
[1:10:29] that way and then go no it's this over
[1:10:30] here no it's here no it's there and the
[1:10:33] enemy amen would become confused
[1:10:37] or the believer would
[1:10:41] become
[1:10:44] confused scripture tells us that they
[1:10:46] say Christ is here don't go if he's
[1:10:50] there don't go right the word where did
[1:10:54] he say the word would
[1:10:56] be in
[1:10:58] you amen don't follow this ISM don't
[1:11:01] follow that ISM don't get cluttered up
[1:11:03] in your mind about these
[1:11:04] things amen cast down the imaginations
[1:11:08] I'm going to move all the way across the
[1:11:09] country go to this church because I
[1:11:11] think I'll be a better Christian in that
[1:11:13] church my brother and sister you ought
[1:11:14] to be a good Christian whether you're in
[1:11:16] the best church or you're in a prison
[1:11:18] that's right amen that should not make a
[1:11:20] difference amen it's when we trust in
[1:11:22] Christ
[1:11:24] so what we got to do is figure out what
[1:11:26] it is we're supposed to be thinking on
[1:11:29] see it says bring into captivity every
[1:11:32] thought
[1:11:44] amen if you don't mind I'm pulling that
[1:11:46] thought and I'm putting it over
[1:11:50] here as I already said not every thought
[1:11:53] is evil
[1:11:54] Vil but a thought can be a distraction
[1:11:57] that's
[1:11:58] right let me just throw one at
[1:12:04] you you be in
[1:12:07] church whoever the minister is says
[1:12:09] something it reminds you of another
[1:12:11] Minister said something along the same
[1:12:13] line your mind then detaches from what
[1:12:16] is right here reality right reality and
[1:12:21] you start reliving what some preacher
[1:12:22] preached that you listen to on a on a
[1:12:25] audio or whatever it might be and your
[1:12:27] mind takes you out of the service right
[1:12:29] here and takes you over there and your
[1:12:30] mind says I was so blessed that was such
[1:12:32] a good service I was so blessed missing
[1:12:34] every blessing that's being poured out
[1:12:36] right in front of you missing everything
[1:12:38] that God's got for you
[1:12:40] today well praise the Lord if that works
[1:12:43] for you send your grocery money to me
[1:12:44] and I'll play a video for you of
[1:12:46] somebody eating good
[1:12:49] food you can't live there my brother and
[1:12:52] sister God give you you present Mana
[1:12:55] fresh Mana it's what he give to you and
[1:12:58] look how Satan will do that I know it
[1:12:59] works he's done it to
[1:13:01] me yes
[1:13:05] sir so thoughts can be distractions yes
[1:13:08] sir and our thoughts can be
[1:13:11] strongholds
[1:13:13] amen we won't go into a lot of this but
[1:13:16] my brother and sister look how often it
[1:13:18] is that what we have is a preconceived
[1:13:21] notion about how somebody feels about us
[1:13:25] I just noticed in church when we were
[1:13:27] walking out how they just gave a
[1:13:28] sideways glance and looked ahead and
[1:13:30] just walked
[1:13:33] off I saw this I saw that I
[1:13:36] felt yeah pretty soon you've built such
[1:13:39] a complex they walk in the room you
[1:13:41] leave that's it now who's snubbing who
[1:13:44] that's
[1:13:45] it but see how Satan Works he's so
[1:13:49] clever often times he lets us my brother
[1:13:52] and sister Dam up our own stream that's
[1:13:54] it that's exactly
[1:13:57] right amen we've already touched on
[1:14:00] imaginations I bring it in another
[1:14:02] fashion but I believe we got the point
[1:14:05] every thought that even has potential to
[1:14:08] exalt itself against the knowledge of
[1:14:09] God we should be putting that thought
[1:14:11] down that's it whether it's like well
[1:14:13] you know brother brandham said this but
[1:14:16] you know I was reading over here and
[1:14:18] they expressed it here and it was so
[1:14:20] much more clearer than what brother Bram
[1:14:22] said I'm not sure brother brandom fully
[1:14:23] understood what he was saying after all
[1:14:25] he had no education by his own admission
[1:14:27] he had none of this and he had none of
[1:14:29] that and so I think I'm going to just
[1:14:30] take this over here because it seems to
[1:14:32] have more
[1:14:34] clarity problem is it has no dovetail
[1:14:37] that's right it might have Clarity to
[1:14:40] the mind but no dovetail in the word
[1:14:43] that's right
[1:14:45] amen so everything that even has
[1:14:48] potential
[1:14:51] amen you realize we got a lot of of
[1:14:53] stuff to declutter that's exactly right
[1:14:56] if you come to Brother Paul's sister
[1:14:58] Jerry's house we go through these spurts
[1:15:01] of
[1:15:02] decluttering and then you walk back in
[1:15:04] the garage where the shelves just a few
[1:15:06] weeks ago were lined up just
[1:15:09] perfect and I look up and it's like who
[1:15:11] put that there you did
[1:15:14] Paul it doesn't go there it goes here
[1:15:17] but something's already occupying this
[1:15:19] space so I need to set this down and
[1:15:22] take this and put it where belongs but
[1:15:24] something's already occupying that space
[1:15:27] and then an hour or two goes by that you
[1:15:29] thought you were going to clean the
[1:15:30] garage and all you've done is do a
[1:15:33] circular motion of a bunch of things
[1:15:35] that you're not sure where it
[1:15:41] belongs somewhere along the line we got
[1:15:43] to take
[1:15:46] things and say you know
[1:15:50] what I learned this
[1:15:54] here and it doesn't fit
[1:15:59] anywhere I was taught this but it
[1:16:03] doesn't fit anywhere in the message
[1:16:05] that's it right there it isct and when I
[1:16:08] say message I mean the word of God
[1:16:09] that's
[1:16:10] right sometimes we just got to be
[1:16:13] brave some of you my friends have mocked
[1:16:15] me before come on Paul just let go of
[1:16:19] it I do you realize I've had this thing
[1:16:24] forever it's almost has historic value
[1:16:27] in my life let go that's
[1:16:30] it right clean it out that's
[1:16:34] right got message people still trying to
[1:16:38] reconcile Matthew
[1:16:41] 28:19 come on Saints I'm not being
[1:16:43] judgmental but I'm telling you because
[1:16:45] it's such a strong teaching in their
[1:16:47] life they are afraid they might be wrong
[1:16:49] so they won't let go of Matthew 28:19
[1:16:52] but they don't know where to put it
[1:16:54] that's
[1:16:55] it they're going around the garage of
[1:16:57] their life saying where do I put this
[1:16:59] where do I put this why don't you take
[1:17:01] Matthew 28:19 and recognize that the
[1:17:04] word cannot counter dict the word and it
[1:17:07] be the word and so just take that
[1:17:10] thought that you've got and take it over
[1:17:12] there and let go of it because Matthew
[1:17:14] 28:19 is fully explained in Acts
[1:17:17] 238 amen you don't have to go any
[1:17:20] further but we hold on to these things
[1:17:24] and it becomes clutter in our
[1:17:27] minds do you know if I could shift gears
[1:17:30] turn a corner
[1:17:32] here we've been taught many of us have
[1:17:35] been taught that we're no longer under
[1:17:36] the law right that is a real Mantra in
[1:17:40] the denominational World we're no longer
[1:17:42] under the law we're no longer under the
[1:17:43] law we're under
[1:17:45] grace my brother and sister as we find
[1:17:48] balance in our life aren't you glad for
[1:17:50] balance I can't help it brother George
[1:17:52] forgot his level last time and he said
[1:17:55] Paul I don't know if this a compliment
[1:17:57] or a dig but he said Paul just keep it
[1:18:00] you probably need it more than I do I
[1:18:03] was like how do I take that brother
[1:18:05] George was quick he goes any way you
[1:18:08] want but my brother and sister we've
[1:18:11] heard it's one of brother George's uh
[1:18:13] topics you might say he likes is the
[1:18:15] balance amen and as we find balance in
[1:18:18] our life we recognize that we will be
[1:18:21] always were and always will be under the
[1:18:25] law some people struggle with that even
[1:18:28] around the message they say no no Jesus
[1:18:30] did away with the law give me a
[1:18:31] scripture for it he actually said I come
[1:18:34] to fulfill the law not do away with it
[1:18:38] amen so he brought it down in a level
[1:18:40] amen that we would always be under the
[1:18:42] law now my brother and sister let's stop
[1:18:45] for a
[1:18:46] second if we Define the
[1:18:50] law in a certain fashion being under the
[1:18:54] law is
[1:18:58] hard it's
[1:19:01] abrasive we
[1:19:03] cha under the
[1:19:06] law but all the law was was defining the
[1:19:09] parameters that God wanted us to live in
[1:19:13] right you know in the farm country maybe
[1:19:16] even in the city good fences make good
[1:19:21] neighbors
[1:19:23] right
[1:19:29] yeah yeah I sold some hay yesterday to a
[1:19:32] lady she she's been buying hay from us
[1:19:34] and she she came yesterday and she's
[1:19:37] very apologetic she says Paul I am so
[1:19:40] sorry she was about 45 50 minutes later
[1:19:42] than she said she would come and she
[1:19:44] said I am so sorry but I had things I
[1:19:47] had to take care of and I was like oh
[1:19:49] it's fine her name is Holly and I said
[1:19:51] it's fine Holly she goes well no it was
[1:19:54] very important and I said okay no
[1:19:56] problem my pigs were out and they were
[1:19:58] rooting up the neighbor's
[1:20:00] yard you know Holly you should take care
[1:20:02] of
[1:20:03] that some things are very
[1:20:07] important but the law was there to give
[1:20:10] us parameters to live in not every
[1:20:14] willy-nilly
[1:20:16] of our thoughts and our imaginations to
[1:20:19] take us over but God put that there for
[1:20:22] us
[1:20:26] as I said Jesus declares he didn't come
[1:20:28] to do away with the law but to fulfill
[1:20:31] it so I'm here this morning maybe
[1:20:33] controversial to tell you that we're
[1:20:34] called to live under the
[1:20:37] law now you know that always gets a
[1:20:39] little scratchy you know people are like
[1:20:41] wait wait where's Grace in this no just
[1:20:43] be patient with me okay I'm not here to
[1:20:45] drag you off in the bushes out here and
[1:20:48] drop you in a Ravine and tell you to
[1:20:50] find your way home amen we're called to
[1:20:52] live under the law and God's got laws
[1:20:53] that he wants you he wants you to live
[1:20:57] under those laws he he wants you to
[1:20:59] recognize that it's him that has done
[1:21:02] this and and just come and settle down
[1:21:05] don't don't be you know bouncing off the
[1:21:07] fences trying to get away from this but
[1:21:09] God wants you so much he wants you to
[1:21:13] embrace that law amen because you see my
[1:21:17] brother and sister when we fight against
[1:21:19] the law we often times think that the
[1:21:21] law is somehow separate from Christ and
[1:21:23] the law is there to cause us to have to
[1:21:25] do things against what we really want to
[1:21:28] do but my brother and sister when we app
[1:21:31] apply the law of
[1:21:35] life then our thoughts are on
[1:21:38] Christ life that's it there's no life
[1:21:41] outside of Christ right so when we think
[1:21:44] of the good things Philippians 4:8 amen
[1:21:47] we think on Christ my brother and sister
[1:21:50] we're thinking on life we're in
[1:21:52] embracing life everybody's you know I
[1:21:54] won't I'll get in trouble uh probably uh
[1:21:57] certain mother here in the church will
[1:21:58] slap me if I go singing off some song
[1:22:01] again and uh but my brother and sister
[1:22:04] uh you know there there's songs out
[1:22:06] there that's come out through the ages
[1:22:08] of of people and they sing about they're
[1:22:11] looking for
[1:22:12] Life there there's something they're
[1:22:14] seeking and they can't find it but they
[1:22:17] want it they long for it and as they try
[1:22:20] to embrace this thing of life life
[1:22:23] actually is passing them
[1:22:25] by because the only life there is is
[1:22:28] Christ and so while they're trying to
[1:22:30] make this flesh feel like it's
[1:22:32] accomplished something and it's embraced
[1:22:34] something and it feels good and feels
[1:22:36] filled with something then we see that
[1:22:39] it's going by why because Satan is
[1:22:42] taking us over here in an alternate
[1:22:45] Channel and moving us and we're
[1:22:47] believing success is life we're
[1:22:48] believing this is life we're believing
[1:22:50] that's life and that's why my brother
[1:22:52] brother and sister I don't want to be
[1:22:53] too rude but that's why they drape the
[1:22:55] half clothed woman on top of every
[1:22:58] article in mankind because there's so
[1:23:00] many men out there that are looking for
[1:23:03] Life they're not fulfilled if I buy this
[1:23:05] pickup does the girl come with it
[1:23:09] never that's right if I do this does a
[1:23:13] girl come with it
[1:23:15] never but it plants a seed of
[1:23:18] life and they Embrace that because they
[1:23:22] longing for
[1:23:24] life and the vi vice
[1:23:27] versa
[1:23:29] yeah I never did see an advertisement
[1:23:32] with a man in his underwear in a pair of
[1:23:35] tennis
[1:23:37] shoes this is the Ridiculousness I'm
[1:23:40] going to just speak bold isn't it great
[1:23:41] getting older brother David I I don't
[1:23:43] want to be old I want to be young but
[1:23:45] I'm telling you this is a greatness that
[1:23:47] comes with that because all you guys can
[1:23:48] do is just fire me it's against the law
[1:23:51] for you to beat me
[1:23:53] but you see what it is my brother and
[1:23:55] sister there is a yearning a desire a
[1:23:59] longing for life and they present life
[1:24:01] as some fashion and some thing over here
[1:24:04] and people say if I go there I can get
[1:24:07] it and then they run from that one if I
[1:24:09] go here I can get it all they do is
[1:24:12] they're still who they are and I hope I
[1:24:14] don't offend anybody but they're still
[1:24:17] old and
[1:24:19] undesirable yeah the 100 ,000 pickup
[1:24:23] didn't change that the 85 year-old guy
[1:24:27] driving a
[1:24:29] 2023 Corvette is still an old man with
[1:24:33] wispy hair amen saggy muscles a bald
[1:24:37] head and can't do anything but climb in
[1:24:40] and out of his car he didn't change one
[1:24:51] drop so when we realize that we can
[1:24:54] applaud the LA law of
[1:24:56] life and then shift our whole thoughts
[1:25:00] from Corvettes and this and that and the
[1:25:02] other I use Corvette for an example
[1:25:04] because I think from the time I was
[1:25:06] about 12 years old till long long long
[1:25:09] after we've been married raised a family
[1:25:12] I would
[1:25:13] tell I have enough money one day I'm
[1:25:16] going to buy a
[1:25:18] Corvette well I don't know I necessarily
[1:25:20] have enough money to buy a Corvette but
[1:25:22] I tell you I climbed in one not not even
[1:25:25] that many years ago I thought boy that's
[1:25:27] a nice car brother Trevor I don't know I
[1:25:29] don't mean to me to whatever in church
[1:25:31] but you know I climbed in that
[1:25:37] thing wow cool the speedometer and the
[1:25:40] tachometer and the traction control is
[1:25:43] all on the windshield and this thing's
[1:25:45] got 600
[1:25:47] horsepower okay it's time to get out of
[1:25:49] the
[1:25:51] car
[1:25:57] okay the asphalt's
[1:26:07] clean Corvette on life
[1:26:15] list you see God has a way of working my
[1:26:18] brother and
[1:26:19] sister I joke with sister Jerry you guys
[1:26:21] have probably find my humor a little bit
[1:26:23] off limits but I I joke with Jerry what
[1:26:25] would it look like if we pulled into
[1:26:27] church you know in a brand new 2023 you
[1:26:30] know they are pretty cool
[1:26:32] looking I pull in the parking lot over
[1:26:34] here and park in the unproc but
[1:26:37] proclaimed pastor's parking
[1:26:40] spot of which Brother David one time
[1:26:42] parked in there and I was like doesn't
[1:26:43] he
[1:26:45] know doesn't he know this is my
[1:26:50] spot what with the church yeah he
[1:26:54] did that's mental assault Brother
[1:27:01] David but you see what image is
[1:27:05] that this world is not my
[1:27:09] home
[1:27:11] right and if I owed money on it at the
[1:27:13] bank I could sing this Corvette is not
[1:27:15] my own that's right but you see my
[1:27:18] brother and sister what happens
[1:27:20] is Satan and anoints a thought the
[1:27:24] thought becomes an imagination the
[1:27:26] imagination starts to be
[1:27:29] manifested and if the Master Gardener
[1:27:31] doesn't come and cut that weed out you
[1:27:34] guys often wonder do you ever wonder why
[1:27:36] certain things head the way they do and
[1:27:37] then it just seems like it's just like
[1:27:39] cut off that's cuz the Master Gardener
[1:27:42] went and said that don't belong in my
[1:27:44] garden cut that
[1:27:47] out I think I'm going to go this way I
[1:27:49] want to do this you know there's a Time
[1:27:52] amen well we won't go into that we won't
[1:27:54] go into
[1:27:58] that you see we apply the law of Life
[1:28:01] Christ our thoughts will be on Christ
[1:28:04] want to live today today excuse me you
[1:28:07] want to live today under the laws of the
[1:28:11] Lord I
[1:28:13] do
[1:28:17] now can I read this quote in about five
[1:28:20] minutes brother Alex
[1:28:22] the guys in the back are
[1:28:25] all let's just hurry through it and if
[1:28:28] Satan has robbed you of the privilege of
[1:28:30] being a son or daughter of God we have
[1:28:33] right this morning by the Holy Spirit to
[1:28:35] enforce the claim of God bring them back
[1:28:37] that's right I'm glad that law applies
[1:28:40] because I was at a time not serving God
[1:28:43] and this applied to me and brought me
[1:28:45] back if he's Afflicted you made you sick
[1:28:48] we have a right before God to enforce
[1:28:50] the laws of God that's by his stripes we
[1:28:53] are healed did you realize these are not
[1:28:55] my words amen this is a law of God not
[1:28:58] random words in the scripture this is a
[1:29:01] law of God by his stripes we are healed
[1:29:04] amen bring him back turn him loose
[1:29:07] you're taking him out yonder of death
[1:29:09] and we claim him bring him back now
[1:29:13] that's the enforcement restore it back
[1:29:15] to its natural condition again a man is
[1:29:17] sick a baby is sick a woman is sick see
[1:29:20] they're out there in their natural
[1:29:22] condition then we have a right to
[1:29:24] enforce our claim not our claim it's our
[1:29:27] claim because God give it to us by his
[1:29:30] stripes we were healed he was wounded
[1:29:33] for our transgressions have you ever had
[1:29:35] a transgression amen with his stripes we
[1:29:38] are healed now we have a right to
[1:29:41] enforce that law and the
[1:29:43] lawgiver that's it see we got to get our
[1:29:46] relationships correct how we view all of
[1:29:49] this the lawgiver is not to be afraid of
[1:29:52] the lawgiver is to be
[1:29:57] praised the Holy Spirit himself is here
[1:30:00] the agent of God to see that it's done
[1:30:02] that way amen and now the only way he
[1:30:05] can work is when that's it the preacher
[1:30:10] preaches the best healing service
[1:30:15] ever the best alter call ever no
[1:30:20] sir
[1:30:22] he can only work when you let him work
[1:30:25] amenallah see we've got you've got to
[1:30:28] believe it that's that's the law oh if I
[1:30:31] ever get to my text see we weren't the
[1:30:32] only ones with a problem like that
[1:30:35] there's a law there's a law given
[1:30:37] amongst everything can we read that
[1:30:39] again there's a law given amongst
[1:30:41] everything am if you took the law of
[1:30:44] gravity away my brother and
[1:30:47] sister we'd have serious
[1:30:50] problems I'm actually really happy about
[1:30:54] gravity if you remember around the turn
[1:30:56] of the century or when the automobile
[1:30:58] first got to be popular they were so
[1:31:00] afraid that if they went over 30 miles
[1:31:02] an hour that they would just fly off the
[1:31:04] face of the
[1:31:05] Earth
[1:31:08] wow oh and you
[1:31:12] sisters I'm glad that by the law of
[1:31:17] God a skirt an inch Too Tall an inch too
[1:31:21] low heels an inch too low doesn't leave
[1:31:24] you in The Stockade for a
[1:31:29] week why because we have balance of the
[1:31:32] word of God look at the Puritans they
[1:31:36] thought their deal was going to make
[1:31:38] this so uncomfortable you'll conform
[1:31:40] well let me put it this way this morning
[1:31:42] I don't want you to conform I want you
[1:31:44] to be
[1:31:46] conformed Amen to the mind of Christ not
[1:31:49] to law of man and the law of of this and
[1:31:52] the law of church but have your minds
[1:31:55] renewed amen being molded into the mind
[1:31:58] of
[1:32:04] Christ I liked how this is put there's a
[1:32:08] law given amongst everything you know a
[1:32:10] fish has a law and that fish can stand
[1:32:13] up here in water and he has a law within
[1:32:16] him and if he'll just let go of that law
[1:32:18] that's in him he can sink Plum to the
[1:32:20] Bottom of the Sea won't bother him a bit
[1:32:23] won't break one cell you try to do
[1:32:27] it that law is not in you that's it and
[1:32:32] let me just take here I I had it and I
[1:32:34] was going to carry it but I chose not to
[1:32:36] but right now we're going to take a
[1:32:37] little break there's another law that's
[1:32:39] in you and that's the law of death amen
[1:32:42] and if we give oursel to the law of
[1:32:45] death what will it produce it produces
[1:32:48] death amen my brother and sister this is
[1:32:50] the contrast of the the two Natures I
[1:32:52] chose to focus on the positive this
[1:32:54] morning I wanted to expound or or share
[1:32:57] out the positive amen that law is not in
[1:33:00] you okay so the law of death is not in
[1:33:03] you the law of life is you can't do it
[1:33:06] but the fish can he deflates himself
[1:33:08] with that air such a way that uh such a
[1:33:11] way that he can't there's nothing in him
[1:33:13] to burst open and he's made that way he
[1:33:16] knows it and he can enforce that
[1:33:20] law
[1:33:23] I think there's whole series right there
[1:33:26] enforce that law that's
[1:33:29] right a policeman blowing a whistle no
[1:33:32] sir the life in US enforcing the law of
[1:33:43] God to take him Plum to the Bottom of
[1:33:46] the Sea and then raise him back up again
[1:33:49] oh what a lovely type that is amen there
[1:33:51] was a law in Christ that law is in men
[1:33:55] you can bury him in the deepest grave or
[1:33:57] the deepest sea or the lowest hell
[1:34:00] there's a law of the spirit of God that
[1:34:02] will raise him up again oh Hallelujah
[1:34:06] and a bird has a law now its body is
[1:34:09] material it's Earthbound sits on the
[1:34:12] earth here but it has a law within it
[1:34:14] that the way it spreads its wings it can
[1:34:17] fly Plum out of sight that's against
[1:34:20] science they claim it's Earth found
[1:34:22] gravitation has its hold here but it can
[1:34:25] defy gravitation aren't you glad you've
[1:34:27] got that law in you amen not in this
[1:34:30] every day in the flesh amen but in the
[1:34:33] spiritual realm we are defying
[1:34:36] gravitation amen CU when he calls we are
[1:34:40] out of
[1:34:41] here oh
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:44] Hallelujah but it can defy gravitation
[1:34:47] lift itself right off of it and go right
[1:34:49] on out because it has to put that law
[1:34:53] that's in it to work and if a bird has
[1:34:56] to put that law that's in it to work
[1:34:59] where will Sons and Daughters of God be
[1:35:01] putting that law in them to work that's
[1:35:05] right see this law is not to constrain
[1:35:07] us but to empower us that's it
[1:35:19] amen and it's built to possess that law
[1:35:24] now I'm beginning to feel
[1:35:26] religious now we have a law the law of
[1:35:29] the life in us we don't only thing you
[1:35:32] have to do you are made and born and
[1:35:34] placed here in the body of Christ as
[1:35:36] Sons and Daughters of God you don't have
[1:35:39] to knock down to the devil you've got a
[1:35:42] law That's the Law of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:45] the only thing you know have to do is to
[1:35:47] know how to let go and let God that's
[1:35:51] right come on my brother and sister we
[1:35:53] can write out all kinds of rules about
[1:35:55] what you got to do and how you got to go
[1:35:58] about it if you're going to be a
[1:35:59] Christian how about we could just get
[1:36:01] down to Simplicity and preach let go and
[1:36:04] let God let that be a Doctrine Among Us
[1:36:07] let go let God
[1:36:11] hallelujah
[1:36:13] amen law of the Holy Spirit only thing
[1:36:15] you have to do is to know how to let go
[1:36:17] and let God you keep fighting at it see
[1:36:19] and it won't never work that's right
[1:36:23] when you let go and let God that's all
[1:36:25] see
[1:36:27] amen if the fish said see now I relate
[1:36:31] to this from my own youth if the fish
[1:36:33] said wait I'll catch my breath real good
[1:36:35] and I'll breathe up a little oxygen in
[1:36:37] me and I'll see if I can go down no he
[1:36:40] does that he'll burst open see the bird
[1:36:42] says I'll see how fast I can run down
[1:36:45] here and maybe I'll take off no he won't
[1:36:47] do it he'll fall down you got to know
[1:36:50] how to control
[1:36:51] how that law can control him and I'll
[1:36:54] tell you as a young man I thought that I
[1:36:56] had to just do this and I had to do that
[1:36:59] and someday God would just come and save
[1:37:01] me but you know when I finally got so
[1:37:03] low that I didn't have enough strength
[1:37:05] to even support life in myself God then
[1:37:08] come and says okay now you've reached at
[1:37:09] the level I can work with you that's it
[1:37:12] that's right see I was always trying to
[1:37:14] work my way up God said no I got to let
[1:37:17] you go down and down and down and down
[1:37:20] until you reach this point that you're
[1:37:23] pliable amen I can work with you I can
[1:37:26] change
[1:37:27] you can I have just a few more minutes
[1:37:29] to finish this
[1:37:30] quote amen and the same way it is with
[1:37:33] us it isn't what we fight and Pull and
[1:37:36] hurry and oh if I don't get this if I
[1:37:39] don't get that that's not it it's to
[1:37:41] know that the law of life is in you you
[1:37:45] just let go and let God then he takes
[1:37:48] you to your healing take you to the
[1:37:51] baptism of the spirit or anything that
[1:37:54] he's promised any claim he's given is
[1:37:56] yours and letting go and letting God now
[1:37:59] I want to just say this I don't say this
[1:38:00] against any sermon ever been preached in
[1:38:02] this church or anywhere else but my
[1:38:04] brother and sister we often times put
[1:38:06] this quantification of what it's going
[1:38:08] to be to get the Holy Spirit and we
[1:38:10] don't put a bit of that away to the side
[1:38:12] but the bride of Christ already has
[1:38:14] something in her that when she will Just
[1:38:17] Surrender completely to Christ and say I
[1:38:20] can't do this Lord he will take and put
[1:38:24] us in our rightful position amen we can
[1:38:27] be oh I need this I need this I need
[1:38:29] this I need this my brother and sister
[1:38:32] let go let God Amen Let Us learn how to
[1:38:35] let go amen
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:39] amen takes you to your healing to the
[1:38:41] baptism of spirit anything that he's
[1:38:44] promised amen did you catch that
[1:38:46] anything that he's promised and he
[1:38:48] claimed that he's given is yours by
[1:38:50] letting go and let letting God now if an
[1:38:53] officer was going to take the fellow
[1:38:55] that stole your property was going to
[1:38:56] take him to the court and you kept
[1:38:57] pulling him back well I don't know just
[1:39:00] whether he should do this or not he
[1:39:02] he'll never get him there just let him
[1:39:05] go that's right I like this right here

[1:41:01] you look out over the Earth God is
[1:41:02] restoring restoring what nature that's
[1:41:05] right he's restoring flowers he's
[1:41:06] restoring leaves he's restoring the
[1:41:07] fruits of the field what is it God is
[1:41:09] restoring it's Easter means to bring it
[1:41:11] back what is it there's been a sentence
[1:41:13] a claim Easter claims or or the flower
[1:41:16] claims it has a right to rise again see
[1:41:18] and God's law of nature pulls the Earth
[1:41:22] around and makes the law of God in
[1:41:25] nature bring forth an Easter a
[1:41:27] resurrection amen it's beautiful the
[1:41:30] return of the sun to restore what the
[1:41:32] winter killed what it was from the earth
[1:41:34] and God sends the Earth back around the
[1:41:36] Sun as we're told from way back here the
[1:41:40] earth the earth went away from the sun
[1:41:42] went back out there that's the way a us
[1:41:45] that's it I can say Amen to this amen
[1:41:49] that's the way a sinner does gets away
[1:41:50] from the so n and this is the Su n but
[1:41:55] when this Earth begins to come back when
[1:42:00] it's out there death strikes it the
[1:42:02] winter it kills every living thing it
[1:42:05] can kill out here out in Here and Now
[1:42:08] when the earth gets back around the
[1:42:10] seeds that's laying in the ground
[1:42:12] they're
[1:42:13] frozen you know I've been so far from
[1:42:16] God in my
[1:42:17] life I was frozen that's right
[1:42:22] Iceberg I thank God I never found any
[1:42:25] desire or anything in me to ever
[1:42:28] curse or maybe what you would say curse
[1:42:32] word would come out here and there and I
[1:42:34] never was happy when it came
[1:42:36] out but you see my brother and
[1:42:40] sister it don't matter how
[1:42:44] cold that's it it no matter how far away
[1:42:48] that's
[1:42:49] it all it takes
[1:42:52] does the flower stand up and say son no
[1:42:56] move 10° to the
[1:43:00] West
[1:43:01] no it's just laying there amen until the
[1:43:05] law of life that's it shines on it
[1:43:09] that's right and makes it come to pass
[1:43:11] that's right amen the life had to be in
[1:43:14] that seed that's right the sun didn't
[1:43:16] put the life
[1:43:17] there the s o n did before the
[1:43:20] foundation of the world but the Su
[1:43:24] cannot put that seed amen now when the
[1:43:27] earth gets back around the seeds laying
[1:43:29] in the ground they're frozen the pulp
[1:43:31] has run out of them and everything is
[1:43:33] gone but there's a little life preserved
[1:43:35] and as soon as the sun gets back in
[1:43:37] position with the Earth again then there
[1:43:40] is an Easter a restoration up comes the
[1:43:43] flowers again up comes everything all
[1:43:45] that the winter killed the sun restores
[1:43:47] all that the Winter's Death kill the Sun
[1:43:52] of life that's right restores Hallelujah
[1:43:56] okay well we still got another paragraph
[1:43:58] are you okay
[1:44:01] amen so it is now with the people all
[1:44:05] that Winter's coldness of cold formal
[1:44:07] religion killed out there the nearing of
[1:44:09] the Son of God in the last days coming
[1:44:12] to his church restores it back to life
[1:44:14] again I will restore saith the Lord see
[1:44:17] there's a law right there my brother and
[1:44:18] sister see God restores his flowers his
[1:44:21] leaves his nature his seed of the earth
[1:44:24] and therefore we know then that God will
[1:44:26] restore also his habitation that's it oh
[1:44:29] aren't you glad that you are his
[1:44:31] habitation amen he will restore his Eden
[1:44:34] he will restore everything that death
[1:44:36] killed that's right now the only way it
[1:44:38] can ever remain dead is that it lay in
[1:44:42] the wrong place but if it falls in the
[1:44:44] right place it's got to come back to
[1:44:47] life again so God let us fall in the
[1:44:51] right channel amen would that be our
[1:44:53] prayer today Lord let us fall in the
[1:44:55] right channel that's right amen that's
[1:44:58] right for restoration all that winter
[1:45:01] kill then the sun restores returning of
[1:45:04] the Sun what does it do it forces that's
[1:45:07] it
[1:45:09] amen
[1:45:11] hallelujah well I was away from the Lord
[1:45:14] as a Young Man wandered to and fro all
[1:45:16] over the south
[1:45:18] of Arizona Colorado Utah
[1:45:24] Nevada until I finally decided I I was
[1:45:27] going to serve
[1:45:31] God now I tell you what
[1:45:34] happened God forced me to come back
[1:45:37] that's
[1:45:38] right when the world becomes vomit to
[1:45:41] you when nothing satisfies
[1:45:44] you you go here and you're not satisfied
[1:45:48] you can have a new pickup you can have a
[1:45:50] new dirt bike you can have money in the
[1:45:52] bank you can have all this and you're
[1:45:53] not satisfied you can have some friends
[1:45:55] that want you to do this and that and
[1:45:57] you think about it and something inside
[1:45:59] it says that's not who you are that's it
[1:46:02] what happened I was forced that's right
[1:46:05] oh people don't like that idea I'm not
[1:46:07] going to let anybody force me anything
[1:46:09] no I'm telling you God can force you he
[1:46:11] can make you so miserable that you are
[1:46:13] forced to come to the place that he has
[1:46:16] because you're looking for the law of
[1:46:19] life
[1:46:21] for restoration all it is actually
[1:46:24] forces death to give up its dead amen
[1:46:27] when the sun the spring comes back in
[1:46:29] line with the Earth again it actually
[1:46:30] forces death to give up its dead to a
[1:46:33] resurrection what a restoration restore
[1:46:36] again what does it the sun coming that's
[1:46:39] it that's that's right God's law that's
[1:46:42] right amen I told you this was a long
[1:46:44] quote that's all
[1:46:46] right good I kept wanting to cut it off
[1:46:50] and then I'd read down the next
[1:46:51] paragraph and I was like that's just as
[1:46:52] good as the last I'll keep this one cut
[1:46:55] that one off well that don't make
[1:46:58] sense God set the Earth in law
[1:47:01] gravitation law everything in nature
[1:47:02] Works according to God's law everything
[1:47:05] in nature Works according to God's law
[1:47:07] and the flower served its term the seed
[1:47:10] served its term it died into the Earth
[1:47:12] and then there was a restoration now
[1:47:14] it's laying there dead that's not a
[1:47:16] thing we could take one of these here
[1:47:19] lights like this and turn it on it would
[1:47:21] never do any good there's no way for us
[1:47:23] to do it but God has a law and when the
[1:47:27] sun comes into the seed it forces that
[1:47:30] life out of the seed and death can't
[1:47:32] hold it anymore amen God has set all of
[1:47:36] his laws to serve him that's it amen
[1:47:39] this is why I was going back even
[1:47:40] levitical law my brother and sister the
[1:47:42] law of Moses was not to bring judgment
[1:47:45] to the people it was to bring them to a
[1:47:48] place to serve him that's it but they
[1:47:52] already had a grudge against
[1:47:54] Moses and they didn't view this as God's
[1:47:57] law even today the Torah calls it
[1:48:01] Moses's law that's right that's where
[1:48:04] they went wrong let me step away out on
[1:48:06] a limb this morning if we think this is
[1:48:08] William branham's
[1:48:12] message we've missed it just like they
[1:48:14] missed Moses's
[1:48:16] law this is God's word to a bride in
[1:48:19] this hour exactly amen I thank God every
[1:48:22] day for the message that brother Brandon
[1:48:24] brought to us my brother and sister but
[1:48:27] the people who believe it belong to him
[1:48:28] want to copyright it to his name or do
[1:48:30] whatever they want to do they have
[1:48:32] missed the point just like Israel
[1:48:35] did they give credit in the wrong place
[1:48:38] they give criticism in the wrong
[1:48:41] place my oh
[1:48:45] my it forces the Life Death can't hold
[1:48:48] it that's right God said all of his laws
[1:48:50] to serve him both natural and spiritual
[1:48:52] working according to his word regardless
[1:48:56] come on listen to us Saints listen to me
[1:48:57] young people anyone with the trouble
[1:48:59] today listen regardless of the
[1:49:02] conditions amen I love that I had a
[1:49:05] scripture here on that yes sir God sets
[1:49:07] all of his laws in motions think of it
[1:49:09] let us soak in now because we're coming
[1:49:11] to a healing service in a few minutes
[1:49:13] see God set all of his laws in motion
[1:49:16] that it must work according to his own
[1:49:19] word
[1:49:21] amen well you know there's some things
[1:49:23] in the message I I I can't accept I'm
[1:49:25] going to step away from the message and
[1:49:28] I I'm going to just follow the word I'm
[1:49:30] going to just stick with the word well
[1:49:32] my brother and sister if you got a real
[1:49:34] seed it'll bring you right back around
[1:49:37] because there's only one seed there's
[1:49:38] only one law there's only one word
[1:49:41] that's come forth God doesn't have a
[1:49:42] multitude of it and either lines up or
[1:49:44] it doesn't and I'm here to tell you
[1:49:46] today it does that's right amen that's
[1:49:48] right absolutely
[1:49:51] amen
[1:49:52] amen God has set his Laws and Motion
[1:49:54] must work according to his own word are
[1:49:56] you getting it yes sir see his word his
[1:49:59] laws has to work according to his word
[1:50:02] He commands the sun he commanded the
[1:50:04] moon he commanded the Earth he commanded
[1:50:06] nature and they all fall right in line
[1:50:09] and all the laws work in harmony with
[1:50:11] God's spoken word and the law of
[1:50:15] life that's it could we possibly read
[1:50:18] that line together yes
[1:50:22] sir oh
[1:50:26] my
[1:50:33] yeah amen wow
[1:50:44] Hallelujah my heart just melts
[1:50:49] amen

[1:51:13] years I want to make myself ready I got
[1:51:16] to make myself
[1:51:18] ready
[1:51:20] and wake up one day with a revelation
[1:51:22] that's it if I just believe the word
[1:51:26] it's all going to fall in line for me
[1:51:30] that's it amen we have a part to play we
[1:51:35] can't just sit back and you know eat
[1:51:37] popcorn and put our feet
[1:51:40] up but you see that labor that I can
[1:51:43] make something
[1:51:45] happen it's gone that's
[1:51:48] it I just just have to embrace the word
[1:51:52] amen Embrace that
[1:51:54] life oh
[1:51:56] my I tell you what my brother and sister
[1:51:59] just my heart just melts when I think
[1:52:01] about this he promised to bring me into

[1:52:15] you it's got to it's impossible for it
[1:52:20] not hallelujah praise the
[1:52:25] Lord praise the Lord that's the reason
[1:52:27] the law of life that was in Christ when

[1:52:32] suffer my Holy One to see corruption
[1:52:34] neither will I leave his soul in Hell
[1:52:37] there wasn't enough time there wasn't
[1:52:38] enough Devils there wasn't enough
[1:52:40] anything to keep Christ in that grave
[1:52:44] till he his body began to rot because
[1:52:48] the law of God would bring the word to
[1:52:50] pass and the law of God by the Holy
[1:52:52] Spirit brings any promise to pass you
[1:52:55] get it regardless of the condition yes

[1:53:33] him forces the issue and says give it
[1:53:37] back am
[1:53:39] amen amen oh if we could just think of
[1:53:42] that for a minute forces it regardless
[1:53:45] of conditions no matter what the
[1:53:48] condition is the law of God's word
[1:53:50] forces a condition to cope with his word
