[29:26] 462
[29:31] i feel like traveling on
[29:35] my heavenly home is bright and fair
[29:40] i feel like traveling on
[29:44] no pain or death and enter
[29:47] there i feel like traveling on
[29:52] well i feel like traveling on
[29:56] oh i feel like traveling on
[30:00] my heavenly home is bright and fair i
[30:05] feel like traveling
[30:08] [Music]
[30:17] heavenly mansion shall be my
[30:33] my heavenly hope is bright and fair
[30:38] he like traveling on
[30:41] the lord has been so good to me
[30:46] be like traveling on
[31:02] oh i feel like traveling on
[31:06] i heavily hope it's bright and fair
[31:10] feel like traveling on well
[31:14] i feel like traveling
[31:31] and that's the truth amen i look around
[31:35] in the world that we live in today
[31:37] and uh you know we just
[31:40] realized you know when the word of god
[31:43] showed us this was not our world it was
[31:46] not who we are it's becoming more plain
[31:50] clearer every single day
[31:54] amen do we we look at this and i won't
[31:58] go into all the thoughts
[32:00] that are jumbling through my head
[32:01] tonight
[32:03] part of that's just not beneficial in
[32:06] one
[32:06] sense because they have a lot of human
[32:09] uh
[32:11] you know things mixed with that you know
[32:13] what i mean as
[32:15] as you look at that and and so it's not
[32:17] beneficial but i can just say
[32:19] just take a moment look in the religious
[32:23] world today
[32:25] and tell me it does not mirror what god
[32:28] said
[32:29] would happen look
[32:32] in the economic world today
[32:36] and see if that does not mirror
[32:40] what has been spoken and look
[32:43] at the nature of humanity
[32:46] are they not mirroring mirroring
[32:51] the prophecy and every bit of it is just
[32:55] falling right into place now
[32:58] as hard as our days might be
[33:04] i want you to catch this as hard
[33:07] as our days might be
[33:11] are we not mirroring
[33:15] what the word said the bride would be
[33:20] this is not an egotistical a proud
[33:23] but it might be bold the world wants us
[33:27] as christians to be downtrodden and woe
[33:29] unto
[33:30] us this bride my brother and sister
[33:34] she's recognizing who she is
[33:37] she's recognizing the authority that
[33:39] she's been given in her husband's name
[33:42] it was all i could do to just not read
[33:45] these quotes that sister jerry just
[33:47] showed me there
[33:48] in the choosing of a bride because it is
[33:52] it is so powerful amen
[33:55] that that the word is being spoken and
[33:58] and it is coming to pass and we get to
[34:01] see it
[34:02] you say but brother paul i have troubles
[34:05] yeah
[34:06] your flesh will be with you always
[34:10] praise the lord and if we're going to
[34:13] start looking at flesh
[34:15] i hope you brought a lot of hankies
[34:18] clean access because we're all going to
[34:20] get up and we're all going to sob about
[34:22] this and that
[34:23] and lost opportunities and
[34:27] this and that and oh we mentioned lost
[34:29] opportunities and this
[34:31] and that but we're not looking at the
[34:34] flesh
[34:36] we weren't called to look at the flesh
[34:38] we can't find anywhere in the word of
[34:40] god
[34:40] said look at your flesh other than to
[34:43] judge yourself by the word
[34:46] and we judge ourselves by the word and
[34:48] we find ourselves unworthy and he says
[34:51] no problem i've shed my blood for you
[34:53] isn't it a beautiful story i it never
[34:56] ceases to encourage me otherwise i would
[34:58] have given up a long time ago because
[35:01] well some of us are just problem prone
[35:05] you know you hear people say well i
[35:08] guess i'm just a klutz
[35:10] well praise the lord i might not be a
[35:13] klutz in the flesh as far as
[35:15] the agility and etc but
[35:18] in the flesh i'm a klutz
[35:24] you follow me
[35:28] but praise the lord
[35:31] i lift up my eyes and who do i see
[35:35] my blessed redeemer jesus christ
[35:39] coming for me with eyes wide open
[35:43] i see his glory and his spirit has
[35:46] fallen
[35:47] and we've received this great life
[35:51] oh thank you lord hallelujah age old
[35:54] proverb saints we just want to
[35:56] just uh go into that once again i
[36:00] i pray that by god's grace
[36:03] the book of proverbs has been a blessing
[36:05] to you now if you wonder why brother
[36:07] paul
[36:08] is maybe going to go forward and then
[36:10] he's going to turn around and go
[36:12] back i'm just kind of following what has
[36:14] been laid upon my heart as far as the
[36:16] proverbs we're not trying to hurry
[36:18] through it
[36:19] you know it actually is very good
[36:21] reading and
[36:23] you know uh been many a a little booklet
[36:26] many of uh a
[36:28] you know a encouragement written you
[36:30] know that uh
[36:31] you can take all 31 chapters you know
[36:34] read them as a monthly
[36:36] daily uh um you know reader
[36:39] what do i want to call that devotion
[36:43] and uh but you know it's just there's so
[36:45] much
[36:46] so much wisdom that's in here
[36:49] um let's just stand as we'll go in and i
[36:52] want to speak this morning trusting the
[36:53] lord to direct our steps we have taken
[36:56] this out of
[36:56] portion not necessarily the complete
[36:59] emphasis of what we are
[37:01] looking at but it is a portion of the
[37:03] scripture today and
[37:04] and we will look at that i want to read
[37:07] actually quite a few verses
[37:08] 1 through 18 so be patient with me
[37:12] please
[37:14] the preparations of the heart in man
[37:18] oh i'm sorry proverbs 16.
[37:22] proverbs 16.
[37:32] proverbs 16 1-18 the preparations of the
[37:35] heart
[37:36] in man and the answer
[37:39] of the tongue is from the lord
[37:43] all the ways of a man are clean in his
[37:46] own eyes
[37:47] but the lord weigheth the spirits
[37:51] commit thy works into the lord and thy
[37:54] thoughts
[37:55] shall be established you see my brother
[37:59] and sister sometimes
[38:00] there's just an effort that god requires
[38:03] of us and
[38:04] we we actually hear it preached quite a
[38:07] bit
[38:08] maybe not so much around the message but
[38:11] in the world of christendom
[38:13] that they just reverse that right there
[38:20] they say well if i think these good
[38:21] thoughts
[38:24] then i'll do this but you see god kind
[38:26] of expects us
[38:27] if he says toe the mark he wants you to
[38:30] toe the mark
[38:31] you can't say i'll toe the mark whenever
[38:33] i have an inspiration to toe the mark
[38:36] and it's kind of interesting while we
[38:38] don't believe in a works gospel
[38:41] that there's a tremendous amount of work
[38:44] that god asks us to do
[38:47] but we don't do it out of obligation we
[38:49] do it actually from our heart and
[38:51] that changes the whole equation when we
[38:53] feel like oh here's a rule i have to
[38:56] follow
[38:57] then that that never works out well
[39:01] but the heart says you know what if god
[39:03] wants me
[39:04] to do this then i i know that's
[39:08] just as it would be what i will do
[39:11] because he wants me to
[39:18] commit thy works unto the lord and thy
[39:20] thoughts shall be established the lord
[39:22] hath made
[39:22] all things for himself yea even the
[39:25] wicked
[39:26] for the day of evil everyone that is
[39:29] proud in heart
[39:31] is an abomination to the lord now i want
[39:34] to throw this out my brother and sister
[39:36] because you see
[39:38] in previous proverbs
[39:42] it says contention comes from pride
[39:46] and an angry reply comes
[39:50] from pride no wonder god doesn't look
[39:55] too
[39:55] highly on pride
[40:01] everyone that is proud in heart is an
[40:04] abomination to the lord though hand
[40:07] joint in hand he shall not be
[40:09] unpunished by mercy and truth iniquity
[40:13] is purged and by the fear of the lord
[40:17] men depart from evil when a man's ways
[40:21] please the lord he maketh even his
[40:24] enemies
[40:25] to be at peace with him
[40:28] better is a little with righteousness
[40:32] than great revenues without right
[40:35] a man's heart deviseth his way but the
[40:39] lord
[40:39] directeth his steps a divine
[40:43] sentence is in the lips of the king his
[40:46] mouth
[40:46] transgresses not in judgment
[40:49] a just weight and balance are the lords
[40:52] all the weights of the bag
[40:54] are his work it is an abomination
[40:57] to kings to commit wickedness for the
[41:00] throne is established
[41:02] by righteousness now i won't comment on
[41:05] this
[41:06] later i don't believe but i just want to
[41:07] make a comment right there
[41:09] it's an abomination to kings to commit
[41:12] with
[41:12] wickedness look at the rulers
[41:17] through the generations the present
[41:20] rulers the corruption
[41:23] that prevails
[41:28] no wonder god looks down upon this and
[41:31] it makes him sick
[41:33] because men consumed
[41:36] by greed and by power and by passions
[41:42] run afoul of every bit of the word of
[41:45] god
[41:47] my oh by the way
[41:51] your president attended mass
[41:59] righteous lips are the delight of kings
[42:02] and they love
[42:03] and they love him that speaketh right
[42:06] the wrath of a king is as messengers of
[42:08] death but a wise man will pacify it
[42:11] in the light of the king's countenance
[42:13] is life
[42:16] in the light of the king's countenance
[42:19] his life and his favor is
[42:22] as a cloud of the latter rain
[42:25] how much better is it to get wisdom than
[42:28] gold
[42:29] to get understanding rather to be chosen
[42:32] than silver
[42:33] the highway of the upright is to depart
[42:36] from evil
[42:38] he that keepeth his way preserveth
[42:41] his soul pride goeth before
[42:45] destruction and a haughty spirit
[42:48] before a fall heavenly father we just
[42:51] come tonight and
[42:53] ask you lord jesus just to be with each
[42:56] and every one who is not here tonight
[42:59] lord just whatever reasons there might
[43:01] be
[43:02] not feeling well circumstances uh
[43:06] working father wherever it might be
[43:09] lord we just ask for your holy spirit to
[43:12] meet them
[43:13] lord speak to them father how faithful
[43:16] you are i
[43:17] think of my brother sergey no doubt
[43:19] father maybe driving or somewhere
[43:22] far across the land but lord just
[43:25] knowing
[43:26] lord in my own life the experience of
[43:28] how you come and you're faithful
[43:30] lord wherever we're at wherever we're
[43:33] seeking you
[43:34] father you always meet us there and i
[43:36] say
[43:37] thank you lord ask you to speak to us
[43:39] tonight
[43:40] lord help us to overcome the weariness
[43:42] of our bodies
[43:44] lord the distractions of our minds
[43:47] father just to press into the word
[43:49] tonight we ask in the name of jesus
[43:51] christ
[43:52] amen you may be seated
[43:57] this chapter saints uh as i was um
[44:01] just studying this chapter just i don't
[44:04] know it just struck me in such a
[44:06] profound
[44:07] way all the little uh uh
[44:11] little things about it the the statement
[44:13] after statement
[44:14] and how to me they fit the day that we
[44:17] live in so strongly
[44:19] uh that you know it just seems like the
[44:22] wisdom
[44:23] of the ages is being poured out uh in
[44:26] this day once again
[44:27] for us for our benefit and i pray that
[44:31] this speaks to your heart uh as we go
[44:34] through the book of proverbs
[44:36] i pray it speaks to your heart just as
[44:38] strongly as it is speaking to mine and
[44:41] certainly encourage you just to go and
[44:43] start there in
[44:44] in chapter one as we are just kind of
[44:47] hitting highlights and as i said we
[44:49] might be jumping backwards in chapters
[44:51] uh just following what the lord has laid
[44:53] upon my heart
[44:54] as we look at this first verse tonight
[44:56] it says the preparations of the heart
[44:59] in man and the answer of the tongue is
[45:01] from the lord
[45:03] now if we go to james the fourth chapter
[45:06] we will see my brother and sister how
[45:09] that
[45:10] in the word of god it gives very much a
[45:12] clarity to us
[45:14] about where our preparations and the
[45:17] things of our life
[45:18] are grounded and here it is in james 4
[45:21] 13
[45:22] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[45:26] we will go into such a city now i know
[45:29] that myself i make statements like this
[45:32] and i i try to uh remind myself to come
[45:36] back
[45:36] and quantify them in the proper way now
[45:39] i might have this
[45:41] right and i might have it wrong but if i
[45:44] remember correctly the prophet of god
[45:46] says 956 times
[45:49] through his messages that are recorded
[45:52] the lord willing
[45:54] so this is no small thought that he has
[45:57] encouraged us
[45:58] to quantify or to attach this to our
[46:01] thoughts our deeds our plans the lord
[46:04] willing so
[46:05] we'll look at this and you know many of
[46:07] us
[46:08] we have busy lives we have things and
[46:11] plans have already been made of what you
[46:13] will
[46:14] do tomorrow in fact i have plans when i
[46:17] get home from church tonight
[46:19] of what i want to do and and not nothing
[46:22] real
[46:22] deep or sophisticated i'm going to go
[46:24] sit down in the chair
[46:26] and i'm going to say sister jerry make
[46:28] me a cup of tea
[46:30] i've already sitting in the office
[46:31] thought i want a cup of tea before i go
[46:34] to bed so
[46:35] you know that we kind of make plans that
[46:37] way and we can take it for granted but i
[46:39] want you to catch the significance of
[46:42] this
[46:42] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[46:46] we will go into such a city
[46:48] and continue there a year and buy and
[46:51] sell and get gain whereas ye know not
[46:54] what shall be
[46:56] on the morrow we don't even know what
[46:58] tomorrow
[46:59] might be my brother and sister for what
[47:01] is your life
[47:03] it is even a vapor that appeareth for a
[47:07] little time
[47:08] then vanisheth away and so we see that
[47:11] literally
[47:12] as it is a good friend of mine a man who
[47:14] has treated me so kindly
[47:16] i pray god would uh bless him uh reward
[47:20] him for his kindness through the years
[47:23] of favors that he has done for us the
[47:26] man is lds
[47:27] 93 years old just passed away a
[47:30] gentleman
[47:31] of a man a man who would look at you and
[47:34] say paul you and i
[47:35] believe differently and then he would
[47:38] pause and he'd say
[47:40] but do we really
[47:43] and you'd say but he he's ldf so he yes
[47:46] he believes different
[47:47] but his life spoke a different chapter a
[47:50] different volume it spoke a different
[47:52] language and so you look at this and
[47:54] realize
[47:55] this man had met god somewhere in his
[47:58] life because he
[47:59] was this just absolute gem
[48:03] of a man i i don't know if i should put
[48:05] the word saint to him
[48:06] but if you would have met him in life
[48:08] you'd have said this man
[48:10] is just a tremendous man and you know
[48:13] you look at that and you just don't
[48:15] realize
[48:16] you know how it is and i realized how
[48:18] many years i have known this gentleman
[48:20] uh it was 30 plus years and
[48:24] i can say that for 30 plus years he
[48:27] would look at me and say is there
[48:28] something i can do for you
[48:30] and so you realize that but i can
[48:33] guarantee
[48:34] you when my friend passed away he was
[48:36] thinking my life has been nothing
[48:38] but a vapor are you with me
[48:43] that's why sometimes us older people go
[48:46] out and we try to kick a ball and
[48:48] hit a ball and then we get up the next
[48:50] morning and go
[48:51] oh my goodness who beat me because our
[48:54] mind is still
[48:55] locked in at 17 18 19 20 whatever it
[48:59] might be
[49:00] and so the vapor my brother and sister
[49:02] is apparent
[49:03] even here while we're living and that
[49:07] appeareth for a little time and then
[49:09] vanisheth away for that ye ought to say
[49:13] if the lord will we'll all be alive in
[49:17] the morning
[49:18] if the lord will
[49:24] we shall live and do this or that i
[49:27] believe it's a principle that we ought
[49:29] to embrace
[49:30] wholeheartedly amen you know the prophet
[49:33] of god i've always took this as a little
[49:35] special touch for me sorry if
[49:37] if you maybe don't see the depth i take
[49:39] it but the prophet of god said you know
[49:41] just keep on planting your potatoes and
[49:44] he actually spoke highly of farmers amen
[49:47] thank you lord but you look at this and
[49:49] realize that
[49:50] that in this whole context we make plans
[49:54] for
[49:54] days week months and years in front of
[49:57] us
[49:58] and yet we have no control of whether
[50:01] we will even finish this day at the
[50:03] stroke of midnight
[50:04] but we realize that by god's grace and
[50:07] mercy
[50:08] he knows every breath every bat of our
[50:10] eye
[50:11] every step that we will take every
[50:13] circumstance that surrounds our life
[50:15] and he has it figured out i say i'm glad
[50:18] i'm in his hands
[50:20] amen so we can trust the lord but my
[50:22] brother and sister don't give up
[50:24] keep making the plans amen if not
[50:27] well let me just put this in here like
[50:29] this we have some very dear friends that
[50:32] live in the east
[50:33] and you know they got caught up in
[50:35] certain doctrines and different things
[50:37] for a
[50:37] a pretty good chunk of their life and
[50:41] here they are
[50:41] older now and have little or no
[50:43] retirement and so it's there in a thing
[50:46] like that
[50:47] that they didn't actually take the
[50:49] scriptural balance that says that we
[50:52] would be good
[50:53] stewards and we would uh make
[50:55] preparation and we would do these things
[50:58] see so just because you are living and
[51:00] believing the rapture is in the morning
[51:02] doesn't stop you from making a good
[51:05] solid plan
[51:06] for your fruit future amen because uh no
[51:09] one
[51:09] thought hey look when i was a kid
[51:12] growing up in church
[51:14] i i i never thought i would get married
[51:17] i i never thought that
[51:18] i and i got married and then i never
[51:21] thought we would have children we have
[51:22] children
[51:23] i never thought my children would grow
[51:25] up and get married i never thought my
[51:26] children would have children
[51:28] and you see so it just keeps going
[51:31] and so you you plan for the rapture you
[51:35] plan for the coming of the lord
[51:37] if i was to fall over dead right now i
[51:40] don't want that that to be
[51:42] some ending of my plan because the
[51:44] master plan
[51:46] come from the master and we read the
[51:48] plan and we realize
[51:50] what our true plan is it is not about
[51:52] gaining wealth and this and that or
[51:54] whatever
[51:54] but it's to be prepared to please him
[51:57] amen
[51:58] and to live that kind of a life that is
[52:01] pleasing to him at the moment
[52:02] amen so the preparations of the heart in
[52:05] man and the answer of the tongue
[52:07] is from the lord and i say let it become
[52:11] part of our speech the lord willing
[52:13] amen all the ways of a man are clean
[52:16] in his own eyes but the lord weigheth
[52:19] the spirits
[52:20] you know this is a very interesting
[52:22] portion coupled with verse 3
[52:24] commit thy works into the lord and thy
[52:27] thoughts
[52:28] shall be established and you know we
[52:31] find ourselves
[52:32] my brother and sister looking at our own
[52:34] plans i always
[52:35] jokingly and i certainly don't say it uh
[52:38] in slight
[52:39] of at all but uh you know just the old
[52:42] song justified
[52:44] justified just as if i'd never done it
[52:47] i'm justified
[52:48] you realize you can be caught so much in
[52:51] carnality
[52:52] and still maintain that kind of mental
[52:55] thought
[52:56] it's not my fault i didn't do it it's
[52:59] your fault
[53:03] it's my wife's fault it's my husband's
[53:05] fault it's my children it's my parents
[53:07] it's the preacher it's the church we're
[53:10] justified
[53:12] but you see what we're looking for my
[53:14] brother and sister is to be
[53:15] truly justified by the word of god
[53:18] and to come into that position you see
[53:21] it's not just an
[53:22] action that we take see we can put
[53:25] things down to actions hey
[53:26] uh i i basically repented
[53:30] uh and i got baptized so everything's
[53:32] fine
[53:33] but my brother and sister you go back
[53:34] through the scripture there there is you
[53:36] might say this is just phraseology
[53:38] a thousand things that god asks us to do
[53:42] and so people want to know oh can can
[53:45] you
[53:45] you know be saved and go to heaven if
[53:47] you've never been baptized
[53:49] not if you know different and refuse to
[53:51] do it they justify it
[53:54] well it says just believe no
[53:58] but it also gives you what the context
[54:01] that's it good way to put it brother
[54:02] david the context of what to believe
[54:05] amen and so the word says something
[54:08] god says you know it now be obedient to
[54:12] it
[54:13] so i want you to look right here we
[54:16] heard the prophet of god say this so
[54:18] many times
[54:20] you know he said check your motive
[54:23] and your objective why do i want to do
[54:28] what i want to do now let me put it in a
[54:32] silly fashion if i may
[54:35] you never saw a child sneak
[54:38] to the fridge to get celery
[54:42] cauliflower and broccoli
[54:47] and you never saw a child sneak to the
[54:51] cookie jar
[54:52] to get a burnt chocolate chip cookie
[55:02] doesn't happen does it the motive
[55:07] for sneaking the cookie is because the
[55:11] cookie tastes good
[55:14] and i want it and i'm slightly
[55:16] rebellious to my mom and dad
[55:20] well there has to be a slight motive of
[55:22] rebellion there or we would be obedient
[55:24] when mom and dad says you're not eating
[55:26] a cookie till after supper
[55:28] and you already know the rules you don't
[55:30] get to eat dessert unless you cleaned up
[55:32] your plate and there's going to be
[55:33] broccoli on the plate and
[55:35] that makes it almost impossible to clean
[55:37] up the plate
[55:40] unless you have a dog named teddy that
[55:41] will eat anything
[55:45] so our motive and our objective as sons
[55:49] and daughters of god
[55:51] is our desire to do the lord's will
[55:56] there is the measurement of sons and
[55:58] daughters of god
[55:59] our motive and our objective it can be
[56:02] summed up
[56:03] not encapsulated but summed up in the
[56:05] simple words our desire to do the lord's
[56:07] will
[56:08] we want to please him we are not
[56:11] here to just take and cherry pick and
[56:14] sneak what portions we want
[56:16] and ignore the rest but we take all that
[56:19] god has given to us
[56:21] and we lay claim to it can we agree with
[56:23] that tonight
[56:24] amen some of it's not simple some of
[56:26] it's not easy the word said
[56:28] it might be sweet in your mouth and
[56:30] bitter in your belly
[56:31] but there's a desire down inside of you
[56:34] that says
[56:34] if god wants me to eat this portion of
[56:37] the scripture
[56:39] now let me just be real open and honest
[56:41] with you because i think it will apply
[56:43] to some of you
[56:44] maybe you opened your bible and you're
[56:46] starting to read some scripture
[56:48] and it's kind of like ouch
[56:52] maybe it's your bedtime scripture and
[56:54] you're like oh
[56:56] you know i was just thinking about
[56:57] reading in the psalms
[57:04] come on do you know what i'm saying
[57:12] come on we've done that
[57:16] uh we've done that i won't go into this
[57:18] story but anyway
[57:20] uh i i can just tell you in the last few
[57:22] days i had a little back story picking
[57:24] up my bible starting to read
[57:26] and going i'm very uncomfortable reading
[57:28] this
[57:30] why because it dealt straight to my
[57:33] heart
[57:34] it didn't hit my intellect it wasn't
[57:37] something about you
[57:40] the word called my name even though you
[57:43] won't find it in print
[57:44] the word called my name and says i'm
[57:47] speaking to you
[57:49] can you se have you experienced that
[57:51] amen and so what is it it's god
[57:54] coming down in a personal way to deal
[57:57] with us
[57:58] that we can keep our desire our motive
[58:01] and our objective
[58:02] in line amen because we are sheep right
[58:06] are we not typed as sheep and sheep are
[58:08] prone to do what
[58:11] wander it's a wonder they don't wander
[58:14] more
[58:16] amen hallelujah
[58:19] you know if we realize that now pardon
[58:21] me for putting this way lord i'm not
[58:23] making light but
[58:24] you know uh my brother and sister are
[58:26] those great big dogs that are
[58:28] with the sheep sister jerry and i was
[58:30] going to town the other day
[58:32] and and there must have been oh my there
[58:34] was thousands i don't want to exaggerate
[58:36] but there was thousands of sheep on the
[58:38] highway there
[58:39] they were we were way back up the road
[58:41] and they were out of sight
[58:42] crossing the dam just the road packed
[58:45] wall-to-wall with sheep
[58:46] now my brother and sister those great
[58:48] big dogs that are there
[58:50] they they are there to protect the sheep
[58:53] but did you know that they also have a
[58:56] herd
[58:56] instinct in them and the sheep are just
[59:00] fine and the dog is something they can
[59:02] ignore
[59:03] until they get out of line amen
[59:07] and so it's there that we realize the
[59:09] holy spirit would be as it were a great
[59:11] pyrenees to us
[59:13] it's here to protect us but he's also
[59:16] there that when we wander out
[59:18] of line that he's going to let us know
[59:20] we belong back over here so
[59:22] you get back with the with the herd as
[59:25] it were with the flock
[59:26] amen now brother branham says in the
[59:29] message testimony he said i'm not a
[59:32] preacher
[59:33] now i'll tell you what i just say this
[59:35] is a side note if he wasn't a preacher
[59:37] the rest of us never qualified
[59:39] we don't we don't even use the word amen
[59:43] hallelujah i don't believe it was a
[59:45] false humility i just believe god knew
[59:47] how to keep him humble
[59:48] kept him down to where he knew it wasn't
[59:51] anything about him
[59:52] it was all about the word of god and
[59:54] that he would have draw
[59:56] a giant blank if god didn't deal with
[59:58] him
[59:59] right even when he comes to opening of
[1:00:00] the seals and and speaking of the
[1:00:03] horse riders and these things he says
[1:00:05] now this was my idea
[1:00:08] and this is what i thought and this is
[1:00:10] how i
[1:00:11] saw it so the holy spirit come down and
[1:00:14] dealt with him and he knew
[1:00:15] that without the holy spirit dealing
[1:00:17] with him he would have kind of just
[1:00:19] sided with those teachers
[1:00:21] that seem to make the most sense or seem
[1:00:23] to be the most anointed
[1:00:25] and you know you and i are the same way
[1:00:27] we can look at the word of god draw a
[1:00:29] conclusion
[1:00:30] and then be studying uh hearing uh and
[1:00:33] realize
[1:00:34] my conclusion was not entirely accurate
[1:00:37] so
[1:00:37] he's saying i'm not a preacher anybody
[1:00:40] knows that
[1:00:41] well we're not just anybody i'm not a
[1:00:44] preacher
[1:00:44] but it's made up in a spiritual form
[1:00:47] of watching things and seeing things
[1:00:50] move and forewarning people of things
[1:00:52] that's coming to pass
[1:00:54] and it's just that's my makeup
[1:00:58] so he didn't go out and form himself
[1:01:02] right he couldn't form himself
[1:01:06] into the office god had to mold them
[1:01:10] god made them now i want to apply that
[1:01:13] back to you and i my brother and sister
[1:01:15] we are not made by human
[1:01:18] human hands or humanity's form into the
[1:01:22] image of god
[1:01:23] into the image of a holy ghost-filled
[1:01:25] christian
[1:01:26] it is god forming you amen
[1:01:30] i i made a statement uh i read you know
[1:01:33] my typical thing i read something i
[1:01:35] can't remember it and i
[1:01:36] tried to repeat it to to brother jason
[1:01:39] in the back there
[1:01:40] uh that my brother and sister it is
[1:01:43] of the forming of our character
[1:01:46] it's the hard trials it's a struggle of
[1:01:49] the day
[1:01:50] i believe is how the phrase went the
[1:01:52] struggle of the day
[1:01:54] is what forms
[1:01:57] i want you to think about that but i had
[1:02:00] a really easy day but your yesterday
[1:02:02] might not
[1:02:02] and your tomorrow might not but you see
[1:02:05] god is
[1:02:06] forming us and just like anything that's
[1:02:09] being formed
[1:02:10] if you take a raw iron and just try and
[1:02:13] mash it into a form it won't happen
[1:02:15] you got to get the impurities out first
[1:02:17] and then you've got to get all the
[1:02:19] circumstance
[1:02:20] that surrounds it correct before you
[1:02:23] conform it
[1:02:24] into what it needs to be formed into and
[1:02:27] i like to use steel or
[1:02:29] aluminum something of that nature as an
[1:02:31] example
[1:02:32] because for it to become malleable and
[1:02:35] formable
[1:02:36] it has to be put under heat and
[1:02:39] pressure hallelujah
[1:02:43] in that incredible who wants their
[1:02:46] character formed
[1:02:48] yeah you know what but that's not your
[1:02:51] flesh that says i want my character for
[1:02:54] that is god in you because a human
[1:02:57] element i was listening to a a a
[1:03:01] minister
[1:03:02] uh and and it broke my heart to hear
[1:03:04] this man he's a young man of
[1:03:06] uh uh probably mid thirties uh and
[1:03:09] he's standing he's a pastor of a church
[1:03:11] he's standing before them
[1:03:13] and he's apologizing to the church
[1:03:16] for the fact that one their church is
[1:03:18] predominantly white
[1:03:20] and he's apologizing to the church that
[1:03:23] he is white
[1:03:24] and therefore he is part of the problem
[1:03:33] oh this whole race thing is just getting
[1:03:35] crazy crazy crazy
[1:03:36] i'll tell you what the problem is saints
[1:03:38] we're not
[1:03:40] washed by the water of the word we're
[1:03:42] not washed by the blood of jesus
[1:03:44] christ we have not repented we have not
[1:03:46] been baptized and filled with the holy
[1:03:48] ghost
[1:03:49] it does not matter what color we are
[1:03:52] god formed us and placed us because that
[1:03:55] was god's desire
[1:03:56] the problem is humanity has forsaken god
[1:03:59] and left the holy ghost as some two
[1:04:01] words on a page somewhere
[1:04:03] when we should be seeking the very
[1:04:05] presence of almighty god
[1:04:07] and i can tell you from my heart i know
[1:04:09] it's clear i don't even mean to go here
[1:04:11] but i'll just
[1:04:12] say this i have become colorblind
[1:04:15] hallelujah i'm looking at sons and
[1:04:18] daughters of god
[1:04:19] i'm not looking at where they came from
[1:04:21] or what they have
[1:04:23] it's not that we got this and we got
[1:04:25] that my brother and sister we
[1:04:26] are sons and daughters of god we stand
[1:04:29] on the word of god and the word of god
[1:04:32] the same spirit that raised christ from
[1:04:35] the dead the word says is in you
[1:04:37] and i today and if we have that spirit
[1:04:40] in us
[1:04:40] we can't be nothing but saying this is
[1:04:43] my brother
[1:04:44] this is my sister without a quantifier
[1:04:48] but we live in a world that's woke
[1:04:51] that's the term they're using woke well
[1:04:54] i'll tell you what they're waking up to
[1:04:56] they're waking up to an antichrist
[1:04:58] spirit that tells them one thing and
[1:05:00] maneuvers them in another
[1:05:02] that's the spirit of the day tell you
[1:05:04] one thing and then
[1:05:06] move in an opposite fashion amen
[1:05:11] so he says that's my makeup i can't help
[1:05:13] that no more than you can help your
[1:05:15] makeup amen
[1:05:16] right you couldn't be born anything else
[1:05:19] we don't need to apologize for who we
[1:05:21] are we need to be filled with the holy
[1:05:23] ghost there'll be no human apology
[1:05:26] when we are filled with the holy ghost
[1:05:28] hallelujah
[1:05:30] amen god has put us
[1:05:33] each one come on are we on this together
[1:05:37] each one that means everyone tonight
[1:05:39] anyone listening
[1:05:41] each one in the body to do
[1:05:44] certain things and i watch every little
[1:05:47] move every objective
[1:05:48] every motive because everything is
[1:05:50] governed by
[1:05:52] governed by spirit
[1:05:55] look at this and we're called to be in
[1:05:58] spirit
[1:05:58] and in truth right but the devils come
[1:06:02] in to get a spirit
[1:06:03] inside the church right now the prophet
[1:06:05] of god makes this statement he says you
[1:06:07] know you know and i put it this isn't
[1:06:09] perfect words
[1:06:10] but you know he said be careful you
[1:06:12] don't get the spirit
[1:06:14] of the pastor
[1:06:18] come on we're not here to get the spirit
[1:06:20] of the pastor
[1:06:22] we're not here now look brother brown
[1:06:24] deals with this let me just go on
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:29] governed by spirit this church was put
[1:06:32] here for a purpose
[1:06:33] there is a spirit behind this
[1:06:37] church let's not look back and say oh
[1:06:40] where was i preached that let's look
[1:06:41] right here there's a spirit behind this
[1:06:43] church
[1:06:44] and that spirit will either pull us into
[1:06:46] the presence of god
[1:06:48] or isolate us from it see having a form
[1:06:52] of godliness but denying the power
[1:06:54] thereof you might as well be an atheist
[1:06:57] for all it will do for us
[1:07:00] there's a spirit behind this church
[1:07:03] certainly
[1:07:04] spirit behind your home that's right
[1:07:08] well it tasted real sweet a minute ago
[1:07:11] kind of getting a little tougher now
[1:07:13] isn't it
[1:07:16] behind every building behind
[1:07:19] everything there is a spirit a motive
[1:07:23] no a in there spirit motive and
[1:07:25] objective
[1:07:26] this church comes here to greatly
[1:07:30] exalt some human system or something
[1:07:34] then its motives is not right but if
[1:07:37] it's put here
[1:07:38] to try to achieve something for the
[1:07:41] kingdom of god
[1:07:43] then the motive and objective both is
[1:07:45] right if the motive
[1:07:46] is directed that way amen
[1:07:50] my brother and sister the moment oh
[1:07:54] no moment
[1:07:57] we ever come under the influence to
[1:08:00] start putting people on pedestals
[1:08:02] somebody bring a chainsaw to church
[1:08:06] we're cutting that pedestal up this is
[1:08:08] nothing about a
[1:08:10] humanity it's nothing about any
[1:08:13] important or
[1:08:14] great person it's about jesus christ
[1:08:16] period
[1:08:17] amen hallelujah
[1:08:20] so i love that spirit behind this church
[1:08:24] god help us that the spirit behind this
[1:08:26] church
[1:08:26] will always be christ first amen
[1:08:30] and not in name only right not just an
[1:08:33] identifier to throw out
[1:08:36] but the very life the very nature the
[1:08:38] very character
[1:08:40] of christ in us hallelujah
[1:08:43] i i really enjoyed that quote when i
[1:08:45] come across it
[1:08:46] see verse 4 says the lord had made all
[1:08:49] things for himself
[1:08:51] in that wonderful how we can just stop
[1:08:53] kind of cut that sentence off right
[1:08:55] there
[1:08:56] and and not really go back into that you
[1:08:58] know because uh
[1:09:00] hey look he has made all things for
[1:09:02] himself
[1:09:03] but my brother and sister i want you to
[1:09:06] look at this
[1:09:08] at that point we're going to stop now
[1:09:10] what's that called that's called a colon
[1:09:11] right
[1:09:14] the lord hath made all things for
[1:09:16] himself
[1:09:18] we were made for him he was not made for
[1:09:21] us
[1:09:22] we were made for him right so the whole
[1:09:25] plan of god was laid out from before the
[1:09:28] foundation of the world aren't you glad
[1:09:30] your name was in the book
[1:09:31] he wrote it with his own precious blood
[1:09:34] identified it
[1:09:35] pointed it out to you and i that we can
[1:09:37] stand here tonight
[1:09:39] and say thank you lord i see myself in
[1:09:41] the plan
[1:09:42] of god and so we look at that the lord
[1:09:45] hath made all things for himself
[1:09:46] yey even the wicked that's right
[1:09:51] it's it's you know we read it and i'm
[1:09:53] afraid saints that we just kind of
[1:09:56] okay but i want you to understand
[1:10:00] everything out here
[1:10:04] can be one of two things
[1:10:08] it can be a trap for you
[1:10:13] or it can be a benefit to you what
[1:10:17] this wicked world be a benefit to me
[1:10:21] absolutely because as a son or daughter
[1:10:25] of god identified by the word
[1:10:28] right that's not a vague thing
[1:10:31] very direct can we say it's very direct
[1:10:35] we know god was speaking to us it wasn't
[1:10:37] random
[1:10:39] it wasn't you know kind of like
[1:10:43] somebody's pointing i right here
[1:10:48] sister nadia doesn't know if i'm
[1:10:49] pointing at her or brother chris
[1:10:52] nothing more embarrassing when
[1:10:54] somebody's like come here and you get up
[1:10:56] and realize they weren't talking to me
[1:11:02] but the word isn't that way
[1:11:06] the word says that he would save
[1:11:09] everyone
[1:11:11] so you read it in that fashion everyone
[1:11:13] thinks they're saved
[1:11:18] but he was actually pointing to the
[1:11:19] bride
[1:11:21] and the bride recognizes that
[1:11:24] she was the one he was calling to
[1:11:28] amen oh i i hope you catch the depth of
[1:11:33] that the rest say i think he was
[1:11:35] sorry sister nadia to pick on you i
[1:11:37] don't mean it that way
[1:11:38] but you see my brother and sister some
[1:11:40] think they were being called
[1:11:42] but it wasn't them
[1:11:45] so they take john 3 16 as the
[1:11:47] fundamental basic
[1:11:49] value that we're all saved all we have
[1:11:51] to do is believe on the lord we're all
[1:11:53] saved
[1:11:54] but my brother and sister they missed
[1:11:56] the point
[1:11:57] they missed the point that the word of
[1:11:59] god was so specific
[1:12:01] god didn't shoot you know it's like the
[1:12:03] cartoons of cupid i used to have this
[1:12:05] i still got a little plaque from when i
[1:12:07] was a teenager
[1:12:09] it's got this funky looking little
[1:12:10] princess on it
[1:12:12] and uh i used to tell everybody this is
[1:12:14] this is the girl i'm gonna marry
[1:12:16] and uh uh i don't know
[1:12:19] yeah close
[1:12:22] but i also used to have a cartoon of
[1:12:25] cupid
[1:12:26] and he's got an arrow and you can see it
[1:12:28] in the bow and you think it first it's
[1:12:30] just the cartoon
[1:12:32] that the arrow has a bend in it and he
[1:12:34] lets go
[1:12:35] and the arrow goes
[1:12:38] misses the pretty girl flies over the
[1:12:42] bush
[1:12:43] and strikes grandmother
[1:12:47] and the next pitcher is grandmother
[1:12:49] holding on to the young man
[1:12:52] i used to think that was so funny
[1:12:59] god doesn't miss
[1:13:02] what's in your heart tonight was direct
[1:13:06] from the throne of god to you
[1:13:10] not an arrow that wandered away
[1:13:14] but a direct call to you and i
[1:13:18] you see i think we forget that sometimes
[1:13:20] maybe i'm misguided forgive me if i am
[1:13:22] but i think we miss that sometimes
[1:13:24] because we start to doubt and we start
[1:13:26] to feel like somehow we're inadequate
[1:13:28] and we can't and we this and we that to
[1:13:32] realize god chose you he says in his
[1:13:34] word
[1:13:35] that he's already made the way before
[1:13:37] you he's provided
[1:13:38] everything necessary i don't care how
[1:13:40] your day was
[1:13:41] good bad or indifferent we should stand
[1:13:43] up and say praise the lord i'm a son of
[1:13:45] god i'm a daughter of god
[1:13:47] it don't matter that this whole world is
[1:13:49] falling apart and burning down
[1:13:51] i'll stand on that promise and that
[1:13:53] promise right there
[1:13:54] hallelujah because otherwise the devil
[1:13:57] just keeps pounding away on you my
[1:13:59] brother and sister
[1:14:00] amen and pretty soon you know you just
[1:14:03] give up
[1:14:04] and people say well i guess i wasn't a
[1:14:06] christian only to go for 20 25 years
[1:14:10] in a miserable life i can introduce you
[1:14:12] to these people
[1:14:13] miserable life and 23 and a half years
[1:14:16] later
[1:14:17] they're like i'm so tired i think i'll
[1:14:19] just kill myself
[1:14:20] and god comes and speaks to them in the
[1:14:22] night and says why don't you just come
[1:14:24] back to me
[1:14:26] you want peace i have peace you want
[1:14:28] comfort i have comfort
[1:14:30] you want life i am life
[1:14:33] and they come back and say why did i do
[1:14:35] what i did well because the devil got in
[1:14:37] there
[1:14:38] and you say well maybe that was the will
[1:14:39] of god maybe it was permissible will
[1:14:43] amen the perfect will of god was their
[1:14:45] name was on the book you will
[1:14:46] redeem them hallelujah sorry i'm getting
[1:14:49] distracted
[1:14:50] amen so he's even made the wicked my
[1:14:53] brother and sister for this day
[1:14:55] and it's hard right because some of
[1:14:57] these wicked people are very nice
[1:15:00] and extremely wicked
[1:15:04] i painted a house for a lady one time
[1:15:05] that grew up in a cult in california
[1:15:08] and she started telling me she was uh
[1:15:10] made me a little nervous
[1:15:12] i'm trying to finish painting inside of
[1:15:14] her house and she followed me
[1:15:16] from room to room until i finally said
[1:15:20] oh i remember i have to go somewhere
[1:15:22] else and work today
[1:15:23] because it was just creepy
[1:15:27] but she started talking about her
[1:15:29] childhood
[1:15:31] and she said is about 13 14 years old it
[1:15:34] culminated
[1:15:37] when literally she witnessed them
[1:15:40] murder a baby
[1:15:44] for the ritual
[1:15:47] and something inside of her says this is
[1:15:50] wrong she ran away from home
[1:15:55] gotten a lot of other problems we won't
[1:15:57] go into that
[1:16:00] to one day she's in a mission
[1:16:03] and the mission their their objective
[1:16:05] was
[1:16:06] to point people to jesus christ and
[1:16:09] she got introduced to jesus christ and
[1:16:12] you know i tried to introduce her to the
[1:16:14] other version you might say of jesus
[1:16:16] christ but she was content with the
[1:16:17] version she had
[1:16:20] but you see my brother and sister
[1:16:23] there's lots of nice people
[1:16:25] they're very wicked she said one of
[1:16:28] those wicked people that was involved
[1:16:31] was the mayor of their city
[1:16:34] such a nice guy everybody liked him
[1:16:38] stories like that never leave you you
[1:16:40] realize that the front
[1:16:44] doesn't have to reflect the back amen
[1:16:49] that's why the word calls for you and i
[1:16:51] to live such a life
[1:16:52] transparent a life that what they see is
[1:16:55] what they get
[1:16:56] and when they look they don't see
[1:16:57] humanity they see jesus christ
[1:17:00] and it doesn't matter if we're coming or
[1:17:01] going or from right or for the left they
[1:17:03] still see jesus christ
[1:17:06] amen let me hurry along i'm getting lost
[1:17:08] in my thoughts
[1:17:09] everyone that is proud in the heart is
[1:17:11] an abomination to the lord
[1:17:12] you know we look at that i'm not going
[1:17:14] to expound on that
[1:17:16] tonight but my brother and sister you
[1:17:19] know
[1:17:19] you see these things when we see ourself
[1:17:22] in our position
[1:17:24] we'll also see that those that were made
[1:17:27] for this day to fulfill the unbeliever
[1:17:31] the make believer they were made for
[1:17:34] that
[1:17:35] just like you were made to be the bride
[1:17:37] of christ
[1:17:38] amen now look at verse seven i want to
[1:17:42] come oh no verse six i mean uh by mercy
[1:17:45] and truth iniquity is purge see it's not
[1:17:48] by
[1:17:48] intellectualism right god's mercy
[1:17:51] and the truth iniquity is pursed and
[1:17:54] remember the prophet
[1:17:56] brought that right down simple you know
[1:17:57] to do it right you know what to do
[1:17:59] and you don't do it it's iniquity amen
[1:18:02] so by god's mercy and hearing the truth
[1:18:05] uh causes us my brother and sister you
[1:18:08] know someone might say well i did this
[1:18:09] and this and
[1:18:10] and that's behind me now but i i never
[1:18:13] made that right
[1:18:14] but i know who to go to i know who to
[1:18:16] apologize to
[1:18:17] don't don't just put that to the side
[1:18:19] you take care of that
[1:18:20] you say well i'd be ashamed to go and
[1:18:23] you know stand on somebody's step or
[1:18:25] tell them i did this and this and i'm
[1:18:27] sorry
[1:18:28] but my brother and sister you're not
[1:18:29] necessarily dealing with that person
[1:18:32] it's between you and god and so what you
[1:18:34] want to do
[1:18:35] regardless of what they think about you
[1:18:38] they might think that you are just loony
[1:18:41] that doesn't matter when you get that
[1:18:43] off of your chest and you know the next
[1:18:45] time the devil tries to get you to
[1:18:46] put that under the rug you've now got a
[1:18:49] foundation a precedent they call it
[1:18:51] to look at that and say no i'm going to
[1:18:53] deal with it and where we once
[1:18:54] ran from our problems now we stand and
[1:18:57] deal with it and people say
[1:18:59] how can you do that i do that because i
[1:19:02] know
[1:19:02] that god will call me right back here
[1:19:05] again to this very same point
[1:19:07] again so i'm just going to stand and
[1:19:09] deal with it
[1:19:10] come on by witness i testify
[1:19:14] amen so we look at this
[1:19:17] when a man's ways please the lord he
[1:19:19] maketh even his enemies to be at peace
[1:19:22] with him
[1:19:23] what a position to be in
[1:19:26] oh my my brother and sister now look
[1:19:30] we can we can kind of get caught up in
[1:19:33] this and i only bring it this way just
[1:19:35] to stir your mind
[1:19:36] you see while it would be reversed as a
[1:19:40] statement right when a man's ways please
[1:19:42] the lord
[1:19:44] seems like that's the break he maketh
[1:19:47] even his enemies to be at peace with him
[1:19:48] but let me
[1:19:49] let me put this out to you this way
[1:19:53] don't focus on the enemy
[1:19:57] don't focus on the person that hurts you
[1:20:01] don't focus on what you see as the
[1:20:03] perceived wrong
[1:20:05] come on for the word says that when we
[1:20:09] please
[1:20:10] god it makes the enemy
[1:20:16] not when we vanquished the enemy but
[1:20:19] when we've proven them wrong when we
[1:20:21] proved we're superior or prove that they
[1:20:23] had some
[1:20:24] no no it's when we please the lord
[1:20:28] when we come to the place that we are
[1:20:31] pleasing to the lord he will
[1:20:34] by his word bring the enemy
[1:20:37] around even to say i'm sorry
[1:20:42] the very thing that maybe made them an
[1:20:44] enemy in the beginning
[1:20:46] but let me put it this way also
[1:20:50] if they never ever come around
[1:20:55] you'll find that your desire motive
[1:21:00] objective to please god
[1:21:04] becomes a salve to your own soul
[1:21:07] comes a slave to your own heart your own
[1:21:10] mind
[1:21:11] that you come to the place that there's
[1:21:14] no animosities
[1:21:15] there's no angst there's nothing
[1:21:19] there you can see them and the very
[1:21:23] vision of them natural vision of them
[1:21:25] causes your heart to say god help them
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:29] not like if i could get them behind the
[1:21:31] building
[1:21:34] i'd talk to them i'd remind them
[1:21:38] no you see that's our problem
[1:21:44] not their problem god used them
[1:21:49] to reveal your fault
[1:21:53] now i'm not preaching to you i'm
[1:21:54] preaching to people like you
[1:21:57] every one of us will at some time in our
[1:22:00] life
[1:22:00] face that where we look and
[1:22:04] our feelings rise up
[1:22:08] that person that person
[1:22:11] said this that person did this
[1:22:15] but i can assure you that when god deals
[1:22:18] and you see that person
[1:22:21] it doesn't god didn't say he'd erase
[1:22:24] your memory
[1:22:26] right that person hurts you
[1:22:30] but you know you've been delivered when
[1:22:32] you see them and you say oh god help
[1:22:34] that's the truth
[1:22:35] lord touch them
[1:22:38] bring them to the cross lord bring them
[1:22:41] into
[1:22:42] change their life
[1:22:47] you see the wisdom that god uses he
[1:22:50] sometimes lets
[1:22:51] us fight against the harness
[1:22:55] let me put this we don't have any
[1:22:57] certain timeline to meet tonight so we
[1:22:59] can stop whenever we want here
[1:23:01] let me just share this many years ago we
[1:23:05] knew this old rancher
[1:23:06] is all broke up now but him and his
[1:23:08] children
[1:23:10] him and his brother and their children
[1:23:14] controlled several hundred thousand
[1:23:17] acres
[1:23:18] of the owahis going off south of bruno
[1:23:21] out into the nevada desert
[1:23:23] an incredible chunk of land that at one
[1:23:25] point in time they
[1:23:27] they owned and controlled
[1:23:31] and they had
[1:23:35] cattle that sometimes would be missed
[1:23:39] and they might live out there you know
[1:23:42] wild as wild for a couple years and
[1:23:46] they had this aux
[1:23:49] a real genuine aux you know
[1:23:52] had one gear that was slow
[1:23:55] and they would rope these steers and
[1:23:57] they would tie
[1:23:58] those steers to this aux
[1:24:02] this ox loved home
[1:24:07] they didn't try to drag that steer they
[1:24:09] didn't fight with him they might be
[1:24:11] 15 20 miles away from the headquarters
[1:24:16] they would just rope that steer and tie
[1:24:18] him to the ox and
[1:24:20] then they just let the ox go
[1:24:23] one time they shared the story about how
[1:24:28] they thought maybe the ox something bad
[1:24:30] had happened because it was like two
[1:24:32] weeks and he still hadn't showed up
[1:24:34] and they just rode out of the ranch to
[1:24:37] go look for him and top to rise
[1:24:40] and they knew the value of their ox
[1:24:44] when here he comes and here's his steer
[1:24:47] still fighting
[1:24:49] two weeks of fighting
[1:24:54] and the ox just one step
[1:24:58] in front of the other because he knew
[1:25:01] i'm going home
[1:25:05] and he drug that steer in the corral
[1:25:09] and of course you have to understand
[1:25:10] this family i won't mention names the
[1:25:12] dad said we'll never break this deer
[1:25:19] and they ate him
[1:25:22] but the thing was the ox knew where home
[1:25:25] was
[1:25:27] and nothing oh i hope you get this
[1:25:29] nothing
[1:25:30] was stopping him from going
[1:25:34] home even though he was
[1:25:37] tied to this world to the spirit of
[1:25:40] laodicea
[1:25:41] it fought him every inch of the way was
[1:25:44] opposed to everything he wanted to do
[1:25:47] he still knew where home was and he kept
[1:25:50] going
[1:25:51] but their success stories they had many
[1:25:53] many many of us steer by the time that
[1:25:56] old aux drug him into the corral
[1:25:58] they could just go up there and take the
[1:25:59] ropes off of him because they were
[1:26:01] thoroughly broken
[1:26:05] so let me throw this another angle my
[1:26:07] brother and sister tonight sister amy if
[1:26:09] you would just come
[1:26:11] we can either come easy or we can come
[1:26:14] hard
[1:26:15] but if we belong to the lord we will
[1:26:18] come
[1:26:19] we might come tied as it were to the ox
[1:26:21] of the word
[1:26:22] amen we might realize that you know
[1:26:25] after a while this is not worth fighting
[1:26:27] i'll just serve him
[1:26:28] i'll just walk with him amen
[1:26:31] hallelujah when a man's ways please the
[1:26:34] lord he maketh even his enemies to be at
[1:26:36] peace with him
[1:26:38] amen well look i want to just stop right
[1:26:42] there even though i just barely
[1:26:43] scratched
[1:26:46] but i want to just feel led to do this
[1:26:47] my brother and sister
[1:26:49] no matter what our problems are be they
[1:26:52] in the family be it in the church
[1:26:56] be it at work be it a neighbor
[1:27:04] don't look at the enemy stay
[1:27:07] focused on pleasing the lord
[1:27:12] because you see if the devil can put
[1:27:13] someone in the way
[1:27:17] they will promote them now the word of
[1:27:20] god
[1:27:20] shows us very clearly and the prophet of
[1:27:22] god elaborates on this that if the devil
[1:27:24] can't
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:26] just directly affect the church he'll
[1:27:29] bring them in
[1:27:31] raise him up he'll do whatever he can to
[1:27:33] do that
[1:27:35] but you see this is not about oh can i
[1:27:38] just kind of make this real personal
[1:27:41] it's not about the relationship i have
[1:27:44] with brother trevor
[1:27:47] you know brother trevor does things that
[1:27:49] i don't like and
[1:27:50] i don't even want to be around him he
[1:27:52] just
[1:27:54] he's way too happy annoying
[1:27:57] it annoys me that he's happy
[1:28:01] and um you know i put up with him
[1:28:05] because i believe the message is the
[1:28:06] truth and i want to go to church here
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:11] but i don't really like him
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:16] you know without intervention
[1:28:20] that won't get any better
[1:28:22] [Music]
[1:28:26] but with the wrong intervention it can
[1:28:28] get much worse
[1:28:31] amen prophet talks about this
[1:28:36] says the devil put a spirit on someone
[1:28:40] now because i definitely don't want this
[1:28:42] to come out wrong
[1:28:44] i've now got a spirit on me and my
[1:28:46] dislike for brother trevor's
[1:28:48] happiness is starting to sprout a little
[1:28:52] bitterness
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:55] and my bitterness that causes me not to
[1:28:57] come to church
[1:28:58] because trevor is going to be there this
[1:29:01] bitterness that causes me not to go to
[1:29:03] fellowships because trevor is going to
[1:29:04] be there
[1:29:05] this bitterness that causes me not to go
[1:29:07] to a birthday party because brother
[1:29:08] trevor is going to be there
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:13] who's it hurting
[1:29:15] [Music]
[1:29:18] you see brother trevor might not even
[1:29:19] know i feel that way
[1:29:22] because
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:28] god bless you brother
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:32] come on saints brother trevor might
[1:29:35] think everything's all right who's dying
[1:29:40] i am
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:43] but if we have the courage to say you
[1:29:45] know what
[1:29:47] i recognize that what's on me i rather
[1:29:49] traverse
[1:29:51] personality whatever i i just
[1:29:56] the hardest thing we do sometimes
[1:30:00] you know saying some of the hardest
[1:30:01] things we do
[1:30:03] lord forgive me lord forgive me
[1:30:08] it isn't about brother trevor
[1:30:12] it's about you and me lord
[1:30:16] and when we get that opened up and we
[1:30:19] get that all
[1:30:20] fixed oh it's a lovely story i won't go
[1:30:24] into it takes too much time
[1:30:26] oh hallelujah i got to give you enough
[1:30:28] so you understand what i'm saying this
[1:30:30] man
[1:30:31] got real bitter got real angry god dealt
[1:30:34] with him and he went down to the church
[1:30:36] one night
[1:30:36] and just prayed and prayed and prayed
[1:30:38] until the lord delivered him
[1:30:40] and he went to church and next sunday
[1:30:42] and he's sitting in church and he sees
[1:30:44] this person he's been bitter to
[1:30:46] and he goes oh praise the lord while the
[1:30:48] lord was dealing with me
[1:30:50] he fixed him too
[1:30:51] [Music]
[1:30:59] come on saints no root of bitterness
[1:31:03] no blaming anyone else let's just stand
[1:31:06] and say you know what this is about me
[1:31:08] and the lord
[1:31:10] and if i think brother trevor you know
[1:31:12] just close this out make sure y'all
[1:31:13] are on the same page if i think brother
[1:31:15] trevor has a problem
[1:31:18] if i don't i don't approach it correct
[1:31:22] i will make what wasn't a problem into a
[1:31:24] problem
[1:31:26] and then it turns out when god deals
[1:31:29] with me
[1:31:30] brother trevor suddenly looks so well
[1:31:32] and i think oh my
[1:31:33] i love this brother i just love being
[1:31:35] around him praise the lord he's so much
[1:31:38] fun and the whole time it had nothing to
[1:31:41] do
[1:31:43] because the devil got in there and
[1:31:46] you know what happens we've seen it i've
[1:31:48] seen it there's people that have gone to
[1:31:50] this church and no longer in this church
[1:31:53] started out they had a little gripe here
[1:31:57] then it moved and graduated to a gripe
[1:31:59] here
[1:32:00] and graduated to a gripe over here and
[1:32:02] then gripe over here and cry
[1:32:04] over there what was it they fed
[1:32:07] that spirit instead of stopping and
[1:32:10] saying lord
[1:32:11] they have faults i have faults
[1:32:14] lord help me lord help
[1:32:18] them lord forgive me
[1:32:21] forgive them
[1:32:24] and then the isms and seasons i can take
[1:32:26] you quotes if we need them do we
[1:32:28] do we need them i can look them up it
[1:32:30] might take me 30-40 minutes but you guys
[1:32:32] have time
[1:32:36] let's not become those people
[1:32:39] that find ourselves fighting
[1:32:42] against the will of god let's find
[1:32:45] ourselves
[1:32:46] placing a value of revelation of wisdom
[1:32:50] over prosperity over gold and silver
[1:32:54] let's find ourselves in that position
[1:32:56] where being
[1:32:57] pleasing to god is more important
[1:33:00] than anything else in our life
[1:33:04] hallelujah amen you know i think the
[1:33:07] lord just knew
[1:33:08] i just asked him brother jason about a
[1:33:10] couple songs before the service and
[1:33:12] this i think is the lord just letting us
[1:33:15] come to the place
[1:33:17] amen let's sing that song pleasing it
[1:33:20] just was on my heart today
[1:33:23] amen i wanted to sing at the close of
[1:33:24] the other 45 minutes of my servant
[1:33:27] amen but you know what saints let's just
[1:33:31] focus let's focus
[1:33:34] somebody at work is a problem focus on
[1:33:37] pleasing the lord
[1:33:39] not focusing on them not focusing on the
[1:33:41] company not focusing on anything else
[1:33:43] focus on pleasing the lord and when we
[1:33:46] focus on pleasing the lord
[1:33:48] suddenly something spills over
[1:33:52] and god answers prayers and god changes
[1:33:55] circumstances and
[1:33:57] changes people's attitudes and usually
[1:33:59] ours is first
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:03] let's just be pleasing to the lord let's
[1:34:05] let's let's let our whole life our whole
[1:34:07] focus
[1:34:07] let it be judged lord what is my motive
[1:34:11] what is my objective what the prophet of
[1:34:13] god saying
[1:34:14] that we could do something for the
[1:34:17] kingdom
[1:34:19] of god when we put that as our priority
[1:34:24] to do something for the kingdom and we
[1:34:27] lower ourselves down just a little bit
[1:34:30] that pride no longer has value
[1:34:35] reminds me one time i well i'll just say
[1:34:37] where i was at it doesn't really matter
[1:34:39] i was in chibak alaska i tell you you
[1:34:42] should all go there
[1:34:44] it will be an experience that you will
[1:34:46] never ever
[1:34:48] forget the lord laid on my heart in the
[1:34:51] service during chivac the anointing of
[1:34:53] the lord come down very very strong in
[1:34:55] their little church
[1:34:58] and i shifted over and i started
[1:34:59] preaching on the value of pride
[1:35:03] i took this angle i was looking today
[1:35:08] on the stock market and the value of
[1:35:11] pride
[1:35:12] is plunging in fact
[1:35:16] it bottomed out in the market there was
[1:35:18] zero
[1:35:19] value of pride
[1:35:23] i didn't realize i didn't know these
[1:35:25] folks brother david's been there he
[1:35:27] knows what i'm talking about i didn't
[1:35:28] know these folks brother chris
[1:35:30] he knows these people i i didn't really
[1:35:32] know him that well and i didn't realize
[1:35:35] people filled the altars and weeping
[1:35:37] crying
[1:35:39] but there was one older gentleman he sat
[1:35:41] in the back with his arms crossed
[1:35:44] and just stared me down and i thought
[1:35:47] well lord i didn't
[1:35:48] maybe come here to preach to that man
[1:35:52] when the service was all over people
[1:35:55] were done crying
[1:35:56] out to the lord lives being touched
[1:35:59] whatever it was that was in their life
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:03] we were leaving that man met me outside
[1:36:05] the door to let me know he disagreed
[1:36:07] with me
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:09] and the hat he was wearing said native
[1:36:13] pride
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:18] and he let me know he was proud
[1:36:22] to be
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:34] praise the lord let my pride lord
[1:36:38] be in you there be something the prophet
[1:36:42] of god says that we can boast about
[1:36:44] let it be jesus christ hallelujah

[1:36:50] wandering around tonight
