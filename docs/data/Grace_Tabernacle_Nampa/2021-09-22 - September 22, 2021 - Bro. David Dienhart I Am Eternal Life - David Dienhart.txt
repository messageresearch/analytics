forward to what has to be said tonight for our benefit amen because we're all on a journey though it may seem uphill sometimes god always gives word in the due season exactly what we need to hear when we need to hear it amen and that we never have to worry about what we're going to face or where we are currently because god's grace is always sufficient for us amen why don't we sing that song only believe amen [Music] all things are possible only [Music] lord i believe lord i believe [Music] lord i believe [Music] things are possible [Music] lord i believe [Music] i believe [Music] lord i believe [Music] all things [Music] hallelujah how many believers we have here today you know what makes a believer not feelings not emotions what makes a believer is that the word is revealed to faith amen amen a believer was in christ in god a believer before the foundation of the world that's what makes him a believer god knew you before the world began he foresaw you even sitting here tonight he saw you'd be here he knew you would be here and he knows your very heart amen so a believer will take god at his word a believer believes the word of god to be absolute the ultimate the amen turn this down the amen the ultimate amen so that's a believer he was always a believer you maybe didn't recognize it until the word of the lord came to you preached in its season when the light could come upon that heart that could believe amen you realize you weren't a chicken after all you're an eagle amen [Music] amen and then you could be born again that's a real believer not one that says he is but not one just that professes it but lives what he believes that's a believer amen amen god bless you i don't think we'll sing anymore but aren't you how am i looking for beulah land we're looking to cross over amen amen that god required god has requirements to do that god requires his own life in you not just the statement not church joining not church participation the world looks at that they don't care how you participate just so you miss the literal life of jesus christ amen satan don't care how religious you are but what he doesn't want to see is the manifestation of christ's life in you because because that's the difference amen that's what he's always fought against he'll try to do everything he can to keep you away from this word not man's interpretation we don't have a right to put our interpretation to the word of god there is no man that can interpret the word god does his own interpreting it's not of private interpretation amen it's not this person said this and this one said this well i have my own interpretation you have no right to your interpretation god interpreted his word through the ordained way of interpreting it and that was through a prophet by bringing it to pass amen he did it that way he always does it that way when god says something then he comes back and fulfills that who can say otherwise that's god's interpretation amen and that's why he had to send his prophets to whom the word of god comes to amen i didn't know how to bring this tonight i was i i come out here and and lo and behold there's more here than i thought there was so when i went in that room there was four or five so anyway i'm thankful to all these that made it god bless you and uh may god be with you and be with those traveling tomorrow and and to the men's meeting i mean i'd like you to stand with me and let's remember our brother paul in prayer i don't know if they got there well corrected or not but uh it was kind of a we'll keep that in prayer amen amen so that's always something comes up but god has a purpose in those things he doesn't allow anything to come upon us and and but what first of all we could bear it it makes a way out of it but also has a purpose in it amen amen i'd like you to turn me the book of ephesians the book of ephesians i just want to read these scriptures here i don't know exactly how to title this tonight i had it titled and i thought i'd change it now maybe i'll go back to my title again so just this just let's have a word of prayer our heavenly father we are so thankful that you're in control it's not man that controls it's you that controls lord lord we as uh we need a shepherd and that's why the lord is our shepherd and lord we can't lead ourself we're independent and but everyone no matter who they are is being led and there's only two powers in the earth today that's the power of satan the religious deception and that's the power of god through his promised word and so father there's two those two powers and one of those is leading each individual the lord you have selected and you have chosen a bride in this hour that lord was in you a part of you was a very thought of yourself to be presented here in this hour that would believe your word would not turn away from that word and that's not something she has that in her intellect but that's what's in her heart you placed it there and you've opened it up and lord because we're always were a part of you you said in your word that you are the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and you even said that that lord in him was life and the life was the light so we know lord that to be your bride we have to be of your life to be a son of god we must be a part of your life and so father we know then that life when it's manifested individually in a member many member bride today it would be the light that's what makes us the light because we have your life and so father we thank you for this now i pray that you bless your word open it as you desire for thy glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen i'd like to title this and i had it titled i am eternal life now if that chokes anybody i'm sorry but but the message of this hour and the scriptures proclaim that a true believer having the holy spirit in them dwelling in them they had to be a part of god before the foundation of the world and so that life there's only one eternal life and that's god himself in order for you to have eternal life or to know eternal life because eternal life is a person it's not a piece of real estate it is a person and eternal life is a person so lord we know that in order to have eternal life we had to be a part of you before the world began part of your thinking of your own self amen to be presented here in this hour in a body of clay to be lived out what he wanted to live out was himself in flesh amen so he has he has a body that god has prepared for him amen and we'll try to get into that more tonight so but we're speaking about the identifier there is something that has to identify that gives you strength it gives you courage that absolutely sets your soul on fire realizing that what is in you what's in your soul is the real you amen and therefore we don't have confidence in man but we have confidence in that open word amen and so we we we we have this identifier which is the seal which is the token the seal is assigned the token is the seal it's both a sign that the price that the price that the blood that his blood poured out as a price you've come through that blood and now have the life of that blood which is what god requires in this hour it's a requirement if you expect to make a rapture you have to have that token which is his own life in you you can't manufacture that you can't make that happen that's god has given you that and we'll read it here in ephesians chapter one let's start with verse three blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath that's past tense blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ in heavenly places in christ that's not a future thing being in heavenly places that's you now by the power of the holy spirit by his own working by his own achievement has raised you up when he raised you raised we'll get into that in a few minutes but when he raised you raised with him and are now not will be i'm talking about the believer i'm talking about the saints that paul is writing to here this word not only written to the ephesian those saints he said i i'm i'm i'm writing to the the saints and to the faithful in christ jesus it's one thing to say well i believe but do you believe in him if you're believing in him you had to be a part of him as we said earlier you have to be a part of him to begin with so he makes you a believer in him and faithful those that are faithful in christ jesus don't let that little word in just run over it because that word in is very important amen so so we see here going on reading according as he has chosen us in him let's read that again according as he hath chosen so he's made a choice he's chosen us and where was where did he choose us in him in eternal life if you have eternal life you always did have eternal life amen you didn't know it when you came here because you came through a sexual birth you came here born and sin shaped iniquity but down in your heart was a seed planted there before the foundation of the world by him and he even calls his own children the seed you go to matthew 13 it's the seed that a sore sowed amen he said he's in his children our seed and we know that the seed his own children even even the bible identifies that all the way through amen they that are a seed christ's own seed amen so so he he spoke a word he even created the earth by a seed amen he's still creating by his seed amen amen see it was the seed it was the word spoken that brought forth life and god placed that in you and he knew you would respond to that word spoken for your season so but getting back here according he has he has chosen us so we see that he has chosen us is there any us here this mor tonight is there anyone that can identify them and see that this scripture is written of them amen how do you know it's written of you because you have the identifier you have the token itself you have you have the seal of himself in you without that you're not going in a rapture without that you have nothing to change your body amen without that you can't enter into that place without that seal god requires the seal of his own life amen the token is required because without that he said when i see the blood i'll pass over you how is he going to see the blood he sees his own life we don't have the literal blood of christ but we have his life and the life was in that blood and that was perfect blood that wasn't a man's blood that wasn't joseph's blood that wasn't mary's blood that was god's own created blood and he was the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man so if he was the fullness of all of god in him then you were in him then and you had to be in him then amen it wasn't part of him there it was all of him there so you died with him and you rose with him when you rose you rose with him okay so he chose you in him in him that just that ought to just set your soul of fire then when you have that revelation in you that he lives in you showing that you were chosen in him there's no way the devil can find you and we're going to come into that a little more amen that's exactly right because when you're hit in christ he can't get there there we spoke about no plague coming nigh thy dwelling thy dwelling is christ thy dwelling is his your his he is your habitation satan can't get there he can try to do something with the flesh man but he can't touch that reality of who you are he can't touch that real new creation amen and so and so we we see here reading on he said you were chosen in him before not just when you gave your heart the lord but before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame you mean there's a people in this earth today that are blameless you mean to tell me there are people in this earth that are sinless absolutely there's a people in this earth today that were in christ to begin with that we're incredible christ now and how can you be nothing but perfect in christ because christ is not imperfect christ does not have does not have sin christ knows no sin and if you're in christ you're sinless i don't hear any amen's hardly out of that but that's the truth that's the scripture if you believe the scripture and believe it the invaluable word of god and that he god will will stand by his word he's obligated to his word he's not obligated to david's word but he is obligated to his own word and if he won't keep his word he's not worth serving but god will keep his word his words eternal he don't take it and turn around and say well i made a mistake i'll make it another way god never changes he said i change not i am god and i change not jesus christ which is that god made flesh said i remain the same yesterday and today and forever he can't change what he did yesterday he'll do today man changes time changes thing changes but there's one thing that can't change that you can anchor your soul on and that's the word of god all right i don't mean keep you standing but you stand just a little more amen so you are you are chosen in him that we should before the foundational world that you should be holy and without blame before him in love in love god is love if you're in christ you're in love you can't love your brother properly you can't have a godly love you're in god unless you're in christ that's how we know we have love for the brother and because we have him in us we are in him he's in us by the spirit he's given us we know we love the brethren hallelujah is that right that's exactly right amen that's a much higher love than a human love amen that's not human love i'm talking about that's a love that loves the truth i mean that's god himself having predestinated us oh that's not a that's a bad word in the day but it isn't around here predestination he predestinates by his foreknowledge he knew you he knew you were part of him he already chose you and himself because you always were a part of him you didn't become a part of him you always were a part of him and in this hour because you're a part of him then you're here to manifest the word for this season that he brought in this season amen all right so having predestinated us unto the adoption that's placing of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of what your will no his to the pleasure good pleasure of his will you don't have one thing to do in it amen you might as well just settle right there satan wants to beat you up and bring an anoints to you every day you live trying to point you to the wrong person you haven't been you haven't chose him he chose you and because he chose you you would chose him you would choose him but the bible said he chose us and then he give us a choice but because he placed that in us to believe his word are you going to get away from this word how are you going to leave it when you're a part of the word all right so so he said to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved wherein he has made us accepted he it's his achievement he hath made us accepted in the beloved who's the beloved jesus christ himself made flesh god himself manifested in the flesh his son god was son god became son there's only one god there's not three gods there's no trinity of three persons there's only one person with three offices three attributes of that one person amen you're a triune being you have a soul you have a spirit you have a body hallelujah all right but you're one person all right now jumping down to verse 11 in whom this one that we're that we that have made us accepted in the beloved in that beloved in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of your will no no after the counsel of his own will amen amen then verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom also in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom in whom also after that you believed after you heard the word have you received now he goes on to say after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit a promise you were sealed so you may be seated thank you for standing you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise the seal identifies the seal are recognizes you have passed through the blood you are his property and there's nobody gonna take you out of his hands you're his property you're his eternal possession you are his kingdom because the kingdom of god is the word living in you so you become that word you are that word living in action amen you are the living word in action you know the word of god is sharper towards his sword living in and it's living and it's operative the word isn't just a letter we are not ministers we are not ministers of the letter we are ministers of the spirit of that word but without the spirit on the word no good you can have all the mechanics you want you can have all the letter you want you can have all you can simonize job the car you can you can wax it up you can dress just like a christian you can act but without the life there's no living there there's nothing to energize those mechanics to go down that road to go down that journey that we're on because everything that he that for this journey for his children has been provided for them through the baptism of the holy ghost everything they need in this journey they already have in them amen god already planned it that way he already gave it to you amen and everything you need he will provide it for he's our provider he's my shepherd i shall not want there's nothing i'm going to need but what he'll provide there's nothing can take you out of that seal once god seals you into himself there is nothing can remove that seal there's nothing can breach that seal until it comes to its destination and when it gets to assassination amen it's over with after you come into your body change amen what do you need a seal anymore for i mean you have the you are the holy ghost himself you are the word himself and you are now amen you are now in spirit you are him amen amen all right so so let's let's read here i want to pass something on to you through the church age book here in page 149 and if you you they keep it this is the older church age book 149 it says here watch what he says here he said the purpose of god according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the purpose of god is according to election an election might that that it might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose what i want to get to the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing now god this doesn't choose with a whim i'll take him i'll leave him i'll take him no he knows and what he knows he acts on what he knows amen and god expects us to do the same act on what we know it's not what we imagine it's not what i hope is right we act upon faith amen god expects you let me just drop this in in this hour you say i go through a lot of this a lot of that and troubles and trials god is expecting you to persevere god is expecting you to prevail with his word just like jacob he wrestled it out he said let me go let me go skinny they said i will not let you go until you bless me that angel is that right he wrestled god expects you and i to wrestle it out amongst every situation amongst every trial amongst no matter what he is allowed to come your way to wrestle a doubt because he wants prevailers he's wanting to see you he's not may not give it to you right away what you ask but he heard your request and he expects you to prevail with that word and say it's done because he said so amen wants to see that prevailing amen not just become discouraged say well bless god i listen so you're listening to the devil say well you must not be a christian because you wouldn't be going through these kind of things or well you because you made this mistake in that mistake listen there is no mistake in christ god is not looking the bible said that god went look he told samuel he says i'm not looking as man looks they want to look on the outside is he a christian he looks on the outside to see if he's a christian or not no i'm not and but see look at god looks on the heart so tonight you're asked the question where's your heart because if you speak something it lives something different than what the holy ghost said in his word your heart's not in the word amen that's right we're not we're listen we believe in holy living we believe in holy dress we don't believe in women bobbing their hair and yet we don't believe in in women wearing these tight dresses and showing every form of their body we don't believe in that we believe god is a holy god but unless that heart's there you're doing it in vain amen but if the heart's there you're going to do it because you love the lord and you're going to be holy because he is how many know what i'm talking about amen so he looks on the heart remember god sees your heart you can say one thing outwardly here but where's the heart and if you really believe the word you're going to believe if you believe the god you're going to believe the word don't say you're a christian and then go out and do things contrary to the word that holy ghost can't live in you that way amen he's not there are you with me all right so he said his heart purpose was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world i've just read it to you it was decreed already you had to be here because you ordained to be here not here in this building but in christ today you have to receive the message that was brought to you in this day to settle your heart to bring you to a rapturing body change he had to bring you to a rapture inside first before you're going to have an outside body change it's got to come within amen it's got to be a rapture within amen all right so not to get you taken off on these side notes but the thoughts of god the thoughts of god are eternal the thoughts of god i'm talking about the thoughts of himself there's only one form of eternal life and that's god you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that's right that's right but those that he chose he called amen called those he called he justified and those that he justified he hath already glorified it's already a finished work amen are you with me then your future and we're getting into this right here in the next scripture i want to read but your future then is clear when you're in christ you have nothing to worry about you can sit back and let off the pressure no matter how much the devil wants to annoy you with this and with that it was something else he's going to punch at you you know every day you're going to have a punch at he's going to have a punch coming but you don't have to receive it you have to bow down to him no matter how much he punches because he can only with his punches go so far but you've got to recognize where as far as he goes he's only punching on the outward side he's only punching at the flesh the spirit man he can't enter that soul because if he could to get where you are you'd have to come through the blood and if he come to the blood he'd be my brother in christ he'd be in christ and he can't be in christ hallelujah you can't come you can only the only way you can be in him you have to come through the blood you must be born again and more and the new birth is more than saying i accept jesus as my savior that's good that's repentance it's a it's a heart it's a terrible thing that in the message itself that people haven't even truly repented that's the truth because repentance will if there's a true repentance of faith it leads to the baptism of of a public announcement of that faith that you believe in him and if you've done that through your faith properly in a real repentance then he has to sanctify you and fill you and the problem is is there not too many have a real repentance that's the truth it's a sad it's a sad fact but even around the message there's not many that have truly repented they want to join church say it sounds good to them they can follow a message have message books this message isn't tapes this message is a literal life of jesus christ the word living in you you have all the tapes you want you i'm not against that i believe in heaven tapes i believe in having cds i believe in hearing the message and we should be we should be focused on the word you should have a hunger for more of him but you can have a bible and still go to hell you can belong to a mess come to a messy church and participate in everything and still go to hell you can be baptized with the holy ghost in your spirit and not have that word down in your soul a real hunger for more of god and still miss it i'm speaking to believers tonight i'm speaking to real believers this seed when it's manifested brings life and joy and peace and and and rejoicing and satisfaction and comfort because it's christ in you the message is christ in you the message is christ the opening of the seven seals is christ the whole thing is christ in you maturing growing growing going gone that's what's happening today she's growing in the presence of this sun amen growing going where are we going we're marching out of here and step with the word and step with the revealed word you're marching out of here and pretty soon you're to become up missing you're gone and that is right on us amen all right so these elect are the eternal thoughts of god which were to be expressed in flesh in their seasons that's what this is his eternal thoughts being expressed that's what he come to redeem was his thoughts you were his thoughts you were the thought of himself and he ordained you to be because he knows for the end from the beginning and could ordain and predestinate and place you where you need to be in this hour amen amen amen i'm talking about this comforter has come i'm coughing about him being here amen so the message is himself unveiled incompleteness and the seal denotes a finished work okay so now let's go to let's take over to jeremiah a minute go to jeremiah i know how far i'm going to go with this tonight i'm trying to watch my time and it's slipping by quickly i'm on the second scripture all right jeremiah 29 very familiar scripture but i want you to notice i just said these these elect seed this elect bride is his very is his eternal thoughts manifested in flesh in their season and the thoughts of god are eternal how many believe that amen amen all right so you coming from god to be manifested to be that god manifested in flesh today makes you eternal not this outer man i'm not talking about this eternal this is dying but i'm talking about that word that's been quickened in my soul that will take over and change this mortal body this mortal body will be what that is and it's growing and it's growing and it's growing and it's going to be changed amen all right but we know there's a bride on the scene today that's maturing in that sunlight amen all right and bringing the same message his message and our message jesus christ message and our message is the same message it's the same person veiled under different flesh veils but the same person if you can catch that revelation if you can get the revelation that the elect are the are the the elect are the thoughts eternal thoughts of god you're going to go quite a ways with that amen makes a difference all right now jeremiah 29 watch these thoughts now watch what watch what he says here i know the thoughts eleven i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil so who's putting those thoughts outside of peace who's putting those thoughts of evil in your heart trying to accuse you of being something you're not because god's thoughts toward you hasn't changed god's thoughts you that carry this holy spirit in you you're identified in him and don't you let the devil lie to you that you're not god is not going to judge you by your mistakes and your failures when he's already sealed you in christ amen but old the devil will judge you is that right oh he's going to accuse you but see he has no record to accuse you by because the record is the is the eternal life record which you're a part of which has already been identified to you by the seal you're in the record you're part of the record you are his own life manifested and the devil hates that when you go to dwelling on that and living that and walking that and talking that he hates it so he's going to try to annoy you any way he can to get your mind off of that to get you get you aside get you on the other side here off of the focus of the things that are eternal while we look not at the things which are temporal but the things which are eternal for the things which are eternal is god's word amen things which are temples temporary but the things which are not seen are eternal amen so which is the real the temporary or the eternal which is the real what you see that's falling away this to being dissolved right before your eyes the corruption and all the chaos and all the fusion of politics that's not god's doing god has no confusion god is not the author of confusion amen it's a babylon why because this nation has turned down the word they rejected it and all they can go to is a chaos and destruction that's the promise but there's a bride there is a people in the land and god said i know my thoughts toward you i've just expressed what his thoughts were toward you thoughts of peace and out of evil thoughts of the thoughts of a body change thoughts of bringing you to an expected end to bring you to an expected not an unexpected but an expected end and giving you the assurance of himself in you that he'll take you there you can't miss it because you're sealed to the day of your body change you are sealed and the book was sealed and when the book was opened it denoted a finished work it denotes the finished revelation of jesus christ which is the mystery that you are unveiled amen amen that's right and so he said so we have gives you an expected end you call upon me i and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you how can he not hearken to his own voice your prayer in his name is not you praying it's him praying how can he not hearken to his own voice you are the voice just like when jesus showed up the message of the hour the message of the hour stood right before martha said lord if you'd have been here my brother would not have died yet nevertheless what you say god will answer god will do whatever you say you'll do and there stood the word there stood the message there stood the word promised for the season standing right in their midst in flesh is that right and they and then she said lord he said why jesus said your brother shall rise again watch watch him watch your answer yes i know lord someday someday he'll rise again that was all right someday he will but someday but jesus said but i am the resurrection i am the message of the hour what do you think the message of the hour is here if it's not jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i am the resurrection i wonder if you believe in the message where's the message today i am the resurrection and the life he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die i am the resurrection as soon as she heard that what'd she do she received the she received the message and she went immediately to her sister and said to me to mary it was martha speaking but mary turned to mary and said the master is come there's the mystery of the seventh seal is this coming that's why we're glorying in what we have today is because we see him here amen there's the mystery of it right there all right and what's it denoting to you catching the mystery the unveiling of himself and you what's it saying to you amen it's bringing comfort it's bringing it's bringing joy it's bringing peace it's bringing assurance it's finished i'm there i'm in him i can't do i can't be taken away from him satan can't get to me i can't miss it i can't fail i can't fault her i'm gonna be there because it's his achievement glory to god hallelujah all right and so and so here we are what a day amen what a day this is all right let's go to colossians let's go to second corinthians a minute just take these things down second corinthians chapter or yeah chapter one verse let's start with verse 19. for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us even by me in sylvanus and timotheus was not yea and amen or would not ye excuse me a nay or yes and no it wasn't confusion it wasn't maybe someone hoped so and yes and no and no it was positive was not yea nay but in him was yea in him as amen in him was so be it in him as perfection in him as flawlessness in him was our absolute we don't have confidence in this body since that flesh man but i do have confidence in that open revealed word in me that's my assurance that's my that's my that's that's my positive all right he said would only know her positive position she will one day and when she knows what she is it'll take the body change it'll take the rapture is that right all right he said oh if she only took a positive position she has a positive position she's been positionally placed in perfection she's been positionally placed in eternity she's been placed positionally in christ she's been placed positionally as a not a failure but blameless faultless sinless and not a failure she's been absolutely positionally placed hallelujah all right now so we see here now he for all of the promises of god verse 20 in him there again in him are ye and in him amen there's no nose in that there's all it's all yea and in him amen unto the glory of god watch by us by us god working in and through his bride by us who's he where do you see him today he's in bride form amen he had to come and bribe for him to finish the mystery of himself he had to be here in bright form the revelation of that seal is that he's here in bride form he's here in your body in behind your skin oh the carnal world hates that but they hated it yesterday when he said the same thing to those pharisees also you judged by the flesh judge no man they say you're a man make yourself god he said did not i say in the word that your gods amen who were who was adam and eve anyway before that fall who were they they were a minor god they came right adam came right directly from god eve came directly out of adam amen are you with me okay so if we come directly from our our son of the second adam we and because the the elements that came out of his body when when adam went to sleep god took those elements and made he a woman is that right took out of the original creation and took a body and made a woman is that right and adam said this is now bone of my bone flesh in my flesh she's a woman she's a she's a man with a womb she's meant to bear life amen she come out of me so she was that was mr adam speaking to mrs adam amen that's exactly right and so what happened to and because of the love of his wife she persuaded him to partake of that fruit which brought forth a cane and then when he partook of the fruit it brought forth an able but somewhere along the line there was a devil there was a murderer come out of a murder called a serpent amen and she bore a cane adam only knew her one time where did cain come from cain was not cain was a murderer from the beginning but adam was in a murder so where'd that seed come from it wasn't eating an apple if that's the case you better pass the apples around let the people let the women see today they're naked and the women men wearing women's clothes and the men were and the women were men's clothes which is an abomination to god to put on anything that even pertain it to a man pertaineth to a woman you don't believe that huh go to deuteronomy 23 oh that's old testament well i'll have you know jesus magnified that old testament said you said in the scripture jesus said you said the scriptures that you shall not commit adultery but he said i say unto you he that looketh upon a woman to lust after has committed adultery already withered his heart then why did you present yourself in a way to make him lust for you stripping yourself naked it's not the spirit of god it's the spirit of the devil it's the spirit of the age because in genesis 6 it said jesus god said it would be jesus said it would be that way again as it was in the days of noah were the sons of god seth's children saw the daughters of man not daughters of god daughters of man they undressed themselves and they took who they wanted to take and had children by them and tell me if this is a wholesale adultery going on today it's a sign it's a flashing red light sign of the end that we're ready to be taken out of here and we are taken out of here in him i'm trying to get you the cross to see this when you're sealed by the holy ghost a promise it's finished for you your future's clear not saying you won't go through trials and tests but that doesn't have anything to do with it that only goes so far it can't touch that person that soul that word anointed and alive in your heart hallelujah hallelujah all right amen it's good to see our positive position amen in christ revealed in you identified you he identifies you and him the seal the token his own life identifies you and him then who is this devil that'll try to keep you from surrendering your all and completely submitting yourself to him who is this spirit anyway it's not god's spirit god wants you to surrender yourself just give yourself over to me let my word be your absolute who is this going to sit down and reason with you on it and then you fear your reasoning you fear your feelings it becomes an idol to you and you're bowing to that idol amen fear becomes your idol and it's an idolatrous spirit i preach that here i like to preach it again more depth amen because it's full of it it's a dominating female spirit today a denominational dominating spirit a church spirit that'll reason with god's word it's a denominational ungodly spirit amen that's heavy on my heart it's going to take up maybe two or three times to preach that i like to preach that message dominating because the catholic church is that and that's the spirit of it that's the dominating female because in the bible a woman's a church he is the word amen there is a true church but not that church because he wouldn't he doesn't even have an organization god never did start one god never did have one it come right out of the pits of babylon oh mother and her daughters if you want to take on their spirit you're going to question you're going to reason with the word you're not going to believe it you're going to put your own interpretation to it but if the holy ghost is in you you just start to do that and watch the holy ghost identify it i may say amen to that watch the holy ghost keep you because we're subject to that in our own minds but as soon but you can't in your soul disbelieve this word and you'll correct it don't reason with the devil well everybody else does this why can't i you're not everybody you're a very very few chosen in this hour it's going to come out of this hour as a bride that's how close it is the closeness of the two spirits isn't out here you in the world it's out here amongst the message it's right out here in church and it is the church spirit that's so close to the real it would deceive the elect if it were possible you see the seals opened up who you are where you come from and where you're going that's what the seals open for amen the book was sealed but when the book was unsealed it brought forth the finished work when the book was then the seal opened up it also told us who he owned and you were able to receive it when the book was when the seal was taken off what else did it do it showed your destiny you're sealed eternally and you're sealed right there in that and now you have that seal of that open word sealing you to your body change and you can't back up on this no matter what you do you can't leave it it can't leave you god's already done recognize you in christ you see did you get that what the seal denotes finished work ownership security all right so i'm not going to go in that i had a lot to take in that tonight but i'm not i'm just going to have to lay it out like that all right now i want to go over colossians a minute oh i didn't finish that scripture excuse me let's go verse 22 no 21 now he which establisheth us i love that now he which establishes us with you in christ see your see your security where's your security where's what god's wanting to see the requirement that god requires today is you must have that token until the seals were open the token wasn't coming in full effect amen the holy ghost was present but not in full revelation the token is the full complete revelation and when you get in and you have that token it shows that you are ordained in a complete revelation you are a part of him a member of him a complete revelation of him that you're the mystery of god revealed amen all right now so he said who hath sealed us he established us with you in christ and anointed us he has anointed us this person anointed us is god verse 22 who hath also who hath also sealed us not only anointed you he sealed you identifying yourself as his possession his seed his life himself he wouldn't have put the seal on you except you were himself what a joy then what a rest face any trial you want to you can face it with a smile you can go you can have a smile in your trial because no matter what state you're in you can therewith be content all right amen amen trials are for your good they're not for your evil god knows how to temper you god knows how to get you to totally yield to him completely submit yourself to it amen that's what it is the key is total submission okay now i'm trying to move through this quickly now i want you go to colossians 3 3 who has also sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts what is the earnest down payment down payment for what that everything else he promised your body change new heavens new earth millennium everything that's out here for you to receive yet is already provided he's going to make it good amen amen amen amen amen amen i feel like shouting or dancing you're doing something but that's the truth whether you shout or dance is what is revealed in your soul it's that settlement don't you let the devil pull this wool over your eyes and start reasoning with you on the word just take what he said let go and let god be god just take him at his word you put your interpretation to it it's unbelief you just settled in your heart he said so in that settle you hold that confession right there and go on i don't care how long it takes god knows how long it takes god will make it come to pass perfectly but he's got to fulfill his word amen i'm gonna i don't know about you but i aim to prevail just keep persevering just keep i don't care what god said it god promised it he's got to do it they said now that's my son he'll stand there no matter what's against him you're going to say but the word said but the word said this is what he said it's written i believe it i believe i believe it and i'm gonna act like it amen amen amen you know the lamb prevailed and overcome too the lamb has prevailed amen all right colossians three i'm just going to have to close this off pretty quick here aren't they not that we have to keep a certain certain time but i don't want to keep you all night either so colossians three and verse three now let's just take verse one if you be then risen with christ somebody's risen with christ how many know you're risen with christ risen already risen not you will rise you have risen mary runs over to martha the masters come he calls free who called for the resurrection and the life who's calling for you amen and she rose up immediately came to him i wonder if you'll rise up immediately at his word come to him when he wants to correct you about you're taking too much time with other things not giving me enough time in prayer and the feeding of the word you've got other things that are more important in your life i wonder if you'll rise up and say yes lord help me cut away this thing cut away this barrier cut away this pleasure cut away this thing that's hindering me and standing in my way what's more important that carnal thing or going home colossians 3 3 if you be the risen with christ seek those things which are below where carnally you can have your flesh satisfied that's not what it says i know it sounds funny but that's the truth you're doing that we've done that i've done that but thank god for the keeping power that'll re break you realize it and you stop it say god i don't want to be that way this is more important to me i need more of you give me a desperation in my heart put such a love in me that i'll be desperate to get out of here not worry about where the next money this worried about my job worried about this word about vaccine worry about this word all these are nothing but annoyances of the devil he puts it before you all the time as a son of god he puts a naked woman out in front of you you hear the music any store you want to go into a bunch of rock and roll beat that simply annoys you and you're bearing that annoying every day but that's as far as the devil can go he can only go to the outside man he can't reach you because when you're head away you're hid away you can't find you when you're sealed in the prophet said he is sealed out amen and facing as you ought to face him and quit listening to him say well you said this and you said that and you made this mistake and you that is not where i'm identified there's an outer man and there's an inside man that inside man is a new creature and he's this head of that new race and he's identified himself and me that i'm that creature i'm the beginner he was beginning of that creation and i'm one of those creations of god in flesh amen amen amen that said a mouthful right there all right let's just get down the brass tacks and we speak plainly okay i am eternal life amen he said oh brother david i know you're dying you can't you why you made yourself god you're just looking at the wrong side of the flesh i am that god i am that word i am eternal life inside of me that's who i am that's the holy ghost in me that's who i am you think that's strong i'm sorry but that's the word of the hour that's the revelation the bride speaks that's what she is and she's not ashamed of it and she'll line up with every word and it'll be manifested through her because if that spirit dwells in you that dwelled in jesus he that raised up christ shall also bring your mortal body subject to that spirit it'll make you walk different it'll make you talk different it'll make you live different it'll take the desires of the world out of you it'll take you women the desires of of the world to dress that sight so tight that it causes men to lust after you it'll take you away from putting on men's apparel you say that's harsh that's not harsh that's love on display trying to get you to look beyond trying you say well you offended me you offended me then jesus offended a lot of people because if i if that offends you that offense wasn't made just to offend you that was love to you to try to expose what spirit you're under so that you can be set free you just you put it the wrong way that spirit's not there i'm not saying that to defend anybody i'm saying it because i long to see you free everything you do even the clothes you wear is motivated by a spirit but against spirits principalities reasoning spirits organizational denominational spirits that have tried to infiltrate itself even in this church as long as we stand with this word that spirit's not going to come here i don't care what it is an adulterous perverted spirit is not going to have the right of way here you'll be corrected by the word you said here you'll be corrected that's all there is to it because the word will correct the air and when you've been around this message and you'll still leave your wife and marry another woman that has a husband that is an adulterous act the bible said he that marries her that is put away commits adultery she has a living husband and you and these these spirits are rampaging they're running around they're they're reasoning in this message around the message say it's okay it's okay you're putting your own thinking to it it's not okay because we had a prophet who had the word of the lord say it is an heir and it's an adulterous denominational spirit and it and you go to listening on that adulterous denominational uh fornicating spirit that comes across the pulpit outside of that word to reason with it you'll go out there and commit it in the natural side of your own bodies tell me that's not right i know it's right if you want to get right then confess you're wrong and forsake that wrong and you'll be forgiven amen is that right that's scripture all right amen how do i i didn't know how this is going to be brought devil fought me all afternoon getting this out i'm about ready to quit i have a lot i could bring can you just bear just about five minutes colossians 3 3. i've been reading this here seek those things which are above if you are risen with christ then seek those things seek actively seek those things which are above where we're above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god i just challenge you search the scripture see what god spoke to a prophet that the bride will say the same thing and you'll find out what we're to be living amen it's christ all right verse 2 set your affection on things above oh that's a big word affection set your affection what what are you what is your affection i didn't let it lay right there what is your affection what takes number one place in your in your home and your business in your own personal time what is your affection you really want to go home in a rapture you really want to get out of here then you better seek god quickly and get the feeding on this word and quit so much foolishness amen that's exactly right well i'm not a minister no but you're a christian and you have a position in the body and when you don't do it you're affecting everybody else amen all right now it has an effect yes it does now watch i'm not going to i won't reiterate on that because i could go with some time on that but set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead hello and your life is hid with christ in god the prophet always finished that was sealed in there by the holy ghost holy spirit sealed in there all right now so you're sealed and you're hid the bible said you'll hide me in the secret of pavilion amen in the time of trouble he'll hide me if we're ever in a time of trouble it's now amen but he has a hiding place in which i'm hid are you hid amen if you're hid where i where you should be hid the devil can't reach you you can only go so far and just bring a torment and and try to uh to punch at you and punch at you well i've got i've got a quote for that if you want notice he said now now satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on earth he said just remember that you'll never have a time but where there's a punching going all the time because you're in a battle did you ask to come to christ to go on a picnic well you're sure going to be surprised because it's a constant battle i've been on the field for 31 years and i fought every inch of the way in order to take the land you have to battle for it fight for it but it's yours go take it healing's yours take it don't back up when you have your little feelings wrap up don't back up when you when you don't feel like you're you're healed feel like you're safe feel wicked don't back up persevere with the word god you've identified me i've seen you at work i've seen you glorify manifest yourself through me i've seen you i know that you're present i know you're in me this is a revelation i'm not gonna budge for that devil all right the same word that speaks of the groom he said speaks of the bride when god is god in his word becomes one when god's spirit waters that seed which you are the word of god it produces god and it's not the individual it's god for you're not yourself no more it's not you anymore it isn't you it isn't the man it's god in the man it's the seed germ in the beginning this was the spoken word seed it's god's word manifested in the man then it isn't the man amen hallelujah it's god's life because god's word is watered by the holy spirit all right if you're born again you're alive with christ and your affections is on things above and not on things of the world this is a this is him speaking now i'm quoting it he said your affections on things above and not on things of the world the earth world satan's system see but if you are born again of the spirit of god you become a part of god and are eternal with him then death cannot touch you when you're born again you are eternal you have changed from a creature of time to a creature of eternity amen amen i'm not talking about this outer man here it's it he changed that inner man from death to life i'm talking about the eternal amen predestinated as he was makes the word seed flesh in you as it was in him amen all right did you hear that amen all right then what do you have to worry about let off the pressure you have a someplace slowed off the pressure don't you well how do i know it might might this might that might this might that might but but not but but no buts no ifs no hands stay with the word rest in him either has control or he doesn't have control he's either in you identifying himself in you you can't get away from if you want to but you don't want to you say i have the right i can do anything i want to brother david yes you can but there's one thing you won't do you won't grieve the holy spirit that's not your hunger that's not your desire who sealed you to the day of your redemption you will serve him you will believe his word and you'll keep it you won't have any desire to do anything that is wrong in his sight amen and you'll take up your cross daily deny yourself and take up your cross daily and we'll follow him deny what yourself your pleasures your feelings all right she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death amen that little thai post is down that soul i'm going to close right here listen to this don't get up and go until i finish this quote and when god hides anything it's really hid that's the reason you're so hid if you're a christian for you are dead and your life is hidden god through jesus christ and sealed by the holy ghost how is the devil going to find you he can't do it you're hid god hide you amen what a hiding place in the bosom of jesus christ aren't you glad you're hid oh a hiding place you must reckon yourself dead your life and christ hit your life in christ hid in christ and sealed away by the holy ghost the devil can't find you if he had to he just couldn't do it you see you're in christ amen the devil can't get you he can't do it he has to come through the same process you did if he did that as i said he would be your brother amen he can't come through that blood he can't come through that process amen do you love him amen amen let's if ruth would come amen amen he's just calling you to a higher walk brother sister realize where your position is realize where your position is placed if you have the seal if you don't and you say but but brother i hunger for it i want it that's there for you get before god and take him at his words it's mine i'm not going to leave here until you bless me you're that desperate see don't don't go in your feelings feelings come feel good no because you shouted you danced and you poked in tongues and you prophesied they're all good but that doesn't define you as a believer that doesn't define that you're sealed amen all right when you have a genuine revelation of the day and the hour in which you live that defines it hallelujah all right i'd like to sing this song you uh you are my refuge my sanctuary do you know that one you are my refuge you are my refuge are my sanctuary when i feel afraid you're my hiding place you are my refuge when the storm is raging underneath your wings i rejoice and see you are my refuge one more time you are my refuge you are my sanctuary [Music] when i feel afraid you're my

refuge amen amen in christ alone i place my trust amen in that lovely in christ alone amen are you in christ is christ in you has he identified himself in you how's he identified by keeping that word amen by revealing his word to you amen in christ alone i place my trust hallelujah and find my glory in the power of my glory is his glory amen in every victory [Music] let it be said of me my source of strength my source of hope is christ hello again in christ up alone i where's your trump place and find my glory in the power of the in every victory let it be said of me my source of strength my source of hope is christ alone do you realize that you came from the same source that jesus christ came from you are a spoken word birth [Music] member of the body of his own body you know that when god overshadowed mary and created that blood cell in him that created that body do you realize you were in him right there you realize that when that body was created you were in that body because he turned right around and said lord a body has self-prepared me that body the bride was in him then amen that's right exactly right when he come to the second adam you were in him right there you lived in him you walked in him you were crucified in him amen and when he rose he rose with him it's a finished work brother sister when god fills you with the holy ghost he tells you it's finished i dwell in you you're dwelling in me i'm identifying that you're in me and i and you and you and me then you know who you are quit babying around quit crying i mean not crying but quit quit bellyaching acting
