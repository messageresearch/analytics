[33:30] say Amen to tonight amen knowing that
[33:34] our God has got everything in
[33:36] control you know sometimes you just have
[33:39] little things in life and we might call
[33:41] them a scare you know little thing that
[33:44] just comes up but you know the word of
[33:47] God just so clearly declares that when
[33:49] Satan would come in like a flood that's
[33:52] God just raises a standard up now God
[33:54] doesn't run out and find a standard to
[33:56] put in the way
[33:58] it's already in US amen the standard is
[34:01] already been provided it's already right
[34:04] here we just need to sit and say Lord
[34:07] you've got it in control and we just
[34:09] leave it in your hands thank you so much
[34:11] amen let's just uh rise this evening and
[34:14] turn in our Bibles amen as we just go on
[34:18] the overall topic of preparation of the
[34:20] inner man I just want to speak tonight
[34:24] um this might be a if I'm using the the
[34:27] words correctly a little bit of an
[34:29] amalgamation of different thoughts that
[34:33] uh we have spoke recently so if you say
[34:35] hey wait brother Paul used that
[34:37] scripture here while back or he spoke on
[34:39] that it it's just kind of a little
[34:41] collection tonight and and uh from my
[34:44] heart I I really want to say it it's
[34:48] meant as a encouragement that we could
[34:50] just look back through the word of God
[34:52] what what it says about us and what God
[34:55] has already done and we have that
[34:56] evidence right in our midst we're not a
[34:59] people who are sitting here saying well
[35:00] if God's ever going to do anything he
[35:02] should do it we're a people who can say
[35:04] God's already doing it amen he's already
[35:07] providing we're already seeing these
[35:10] things come to pass amen and so as we
[35:13] look at this I Pray tonight it just be a
[35:15] blessing to you so we turn in our Bibles
[35:18] to the Book of James the first chapter
[35:21] uh starting with the first verse uh we
[35:24] shall uh read several verses here
[35:28] and then we'll skip to the 17th verse
[35:31] James a servant of God and of the Lord
[35:33] Jesus Christ and I believe that's how we
[35:35] are
[35:36] identified to the 12 tribes which are
[35:39] scattered abroad greeting my brethren
[35:42] count it all joy when you fall in
[35:44] diverse Temptations amen knowing this at
[35:47] the trying of your faith amen so every
[35:50] one of us has a personal faith right
[35:55] it's been marked for us it is our
[35:59] faith the trying of your faith worketh
[36:03] patience but let patience have her
[36:05] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[36:08] entire wanting nothing and if any of you
[36:11] lack wisdom let him ask of God that
[36:14] giveth to all men liberally I like this
[36:17] scripture I've read it many times here
[36:19] to the church because it just strikes a
[36:22] chord in my heart God's not stingy no
[36:27] God's not like I'm I'm going to run out
[36:29] of this I better Dole this out very
[36:31] carefully no he says here that he giveth
[36:34] to all men liberally and up Brath not
[36:38] and it shall be given him but let him
[36:40] ask in faith nothing wavering for he
[36:43] that wavereth is like a wave of the sea
[36:46] driven with wind and tossed for let not
[36:50] that man think that he shall receive
[36:53] anything of the Lord see we can't start
[36:58] our day off God loves me and finish our
[37:01] day off I'm not sure God loves me you
[37:05] you have to stand solid you have to
[37:08] believe you're a son or daughter of God
[37:11] you have to believe you're the bride you
[37:14] can't waver this back and forth because
[37:16] what'll happen is in the very moment
[37:20] that you
[37:22] need doubt will rob
[37:26] you you know the robber never sends a
[37:31] warning at 12:01 I'm walking in your
[37:33] bank and taking all your
[37:35] money he always comes at the
[37:40] unexpected now I just want to put this
[37:42] to
[37:42] you that's what the devil does he he
[37:46] recognizes that God's doing
[37:50] something and he waits as close as he
[37:53] can to the climax of what he believes
[37:55] God is doing and he starts dropping his
[37:58] balms and throwing his doubts and his
[38:01] fears and we have to
[38:04] recognize we're not going to receive
[38:06] anything of God if we are sitting here
[38:10] filled with doubt and fear a double
[38:13] minded man is unstable in all his ways
[38:16] let the brother of low degree rejoice in
[38:19] that he is exalted but the rich in that
[38:22] he is made low because as the flower of
[38:24] the grass he shall pass away for the son
[38:26] is no sooner risen with a burning heat
[38:29] but it withereth the grass and the
[38:31] flower thereof falleth and the grace of
[38:34] the fashion of it perisheth so also
[38:38] shall the rich man Fade Away in his ways
[38:42] blessed is the man that endureth
[38:44] Temptation for when he is tried he shall
[38:46] receive the Crown of Life which the Lord
[38:49] hath promised to them that love him we
[38:52] shall go to verse 17 every good gift and
[38:56] every perfect gift is from above and
[38:59] cometh down from the Father of Lights
[39:02] with whom is no variableness neither
[39:06] shadow of turning thank you Lord
[39:09] Heavenly Father we just ask for your
[39:11] hand upon the service tonight Lord upon
[39:14] the Saints Lord that are called this
[39:16] church home we just ask you Lord
[39:18] wherever they may be tonight whatever
[39:19] their circumstance is Father may your
[39:22] Holy Spirit Reach Out touch their hearts
[39:24] stir them Father we pray Lord draw all
[39:27] of us into your presence we ask in the
[39:29] precious name of Jesus Christ amen you
[39:32] may be
[39:33] seated as we look at this tonight
[39:37] I often times as I read this
[39:40] scripture you can look at that and
[39:43] see if
[39:45] you pluck one portion of
[39:48] it you could become discouraged you
[39:51] could look at that and think you know
[39:53] what um it's going to be so difficult at
[39:55] the trying of my faith and if you're not
[39:58] careful you will remember the
[40:01] failures and not the victories you will
[40:04] remember the difficulties and not those
[40:07] things that brought a great joy and
[40:11] praise to your lips so as we submit
[40:14] oursel to the word we must always take
[40:17] all of the word We Can't Stop and and
[40:21] just dwell on the negative we have to
[40:23] take all the what you might say the
[40:26] beautiful portions of scripture those
[40:28] things that bring joy to our heart and
[40:31] you know I just coming down here um in
[40:35] verse 17 every good gift and every
[40:38] perfect gift is from above and cometh
[40:41] down from the Father of Lights with whom
[40:43] is no variableness well look at that my
[40:45] brother and sister see God God doesn't
[40:48] come as we might in the human nature
[40:50] we'll come one day and we'll be happy
[40:53] and maybe similar circumstances we won't
[40:56] be happy and sometimes we we have a
[40:59] different point of view and depends on
[41:01] what's going on around us and you know
[41:03] you hang out with positive people you'll
[41:05] have positive actions and reactions you
[41:07] hang around with negative people you
[41:09] will find yourself caught up in a
[41:11] negative frame of mind but you see God's
[41:14] not that way and so what God says is
[41:16] good is good and what God Said is evil
[41:19] is evil and if God says I'm going to
[41:21] bless you then you can count on being
[41:23] blessed you don't have to question
[41:25] whether today will be different or not
[41:28] amen and so I I love that and I love
[41:31] good gifts anyone love a good gift amen
[41:34] a perfect gift amen but God has given
[41:37] that because he come in his word and he
[41:39] promised that to you and I that in this
[41:41] hour this would be the hour that he
[41:43] would manifest himself to his bride and
[41:47] it's not just coming down you see God uh
[41:49] presents himself aresh in every
[41:52] generation every Church age God come
[41:55] down and print it not a new message not
[41:56] a new approach not a new but he brings
[41:59] himself aresh and comes down to remind
[42:02] the people that no matter what age that
[42:04] you were born or called to rise up in
[42:07] then in that age God is present he's
[42:09] alive it is uh the power of the
[42:12] Resurrection is being manifested to us
[42:15] and it's a matter for you and I if we
[42:18] are going to uh look at that and say you
[42:20] know what I receive the word for my day
[42:23] I receive the word for my hour it won't
[42:25] do any good Saints um and this could go
[42:28] vice versa but it don't do any good for
[42:30] me to say I receive it for you you have
[42:33] to yourself rise up and say I receive
[42:36] this and I claim my healing amen I I
[42:39] claim my position in the body amen now
[42:43] sometimes we look at this and say you
[42:45] know what I I uh uh I I believe you know
[42:48] that I have been healed by his stripes
[42:51] now my brother and sister that's
[42:52] wonderful that you believe but do you
[42:55] believe God loved you enough to make
[42:59] that real that you can step out with
[43:02] absolute confidence and claim that you
[43:05] see just taking it as a bit of knowledge
[43:08] and acknowledging the word says it is
[43:10] not sufficient it has to be anchored
[43:12] deep down in us that we can come my
[43:15] brother and sister and say thank you my
[43:18] brother and sister let me just uh put
[43:21] this uh a little nugget from Sunday that
[43:23] I didn't get to uh you see we must be
[43:26] fully p persuaded amen do you know God's
[43:29] fully persuaded about you he didn't come
[43:32] along with any variableness or turning
[43:35] he said you're my son you're my daughter
[43:37] and he never wavered from that he never
[43:39] said well if you come along and and you
[43:42] don't just behave right today you're not
[43:44] my son or daughter any longer you see
[43:46] just as sold out as you would be about
[43:49] God God is sold out about you and God
[43:51] wants to heal you brother brandham says
[43:53] this God wants to heal you more than you
[43:56] want to be healed
[43:57] amen he wants to fill us with his holy
[43:59] spirit even more than we want to be
[44:01] filled and and that's because he's
[44:03] entirely sold out about you he's
[44:06] entirely persuaded about who you are and
[44:10] if we can just reciprocate that back to
[44:12] God and completely be persuaded that
[44:14] when God said he wants to fill us with
[44:16] the Holy Ghost he wants to fill me so
[44:18] bad amen it's not just how bad I want it
[44:21] but God's there wanting to fill me amen
[44:23] and fill you amen now we'll look here
[44:26] and second Corinthians uh looking in uh
[44:29] 12th chapter starting the 9th verse
[44:32] there and he said and he said unto me my
[44:36] grace is sufficient for thee I I think
[44:40] that ought to just stir our hearts with
[44:42] a little Joy tonight that that he's not
[44:44] saying now it's going to get a little
[44:46] sketchy down here in leod deia it's
[44:49] going to get a little down here at the
[44:51] end of time it it is it is going to you
[44:54] know I've poured out a lot of Grace
[44:56] Through the Ages I poured out a lot to
[44:59] uh mankind I poured out a lot in leoda
[45:02] and so when we get down to the end of
[45:04] this leod to see and age it's going to
[45:06] get a little thin so we got to be real
[45:08] careful no my brother and sister he said
[45:11] my grace oh if we could take that as an
[45:14] absolute uh anchored in the Rock
[45:17] statement my grace is sufficient this is
[45:21] not us
[45:23] abusing but God is telling you no matter
[45:26] what comes your way and no matter what
[45:28] tricks that the devil would throw in
[45:30] front of you and no matter what the
[45:32] tumble and struggle of life will be my
[45:35] grace is
[45:38] sufficient oh I tell you when you can
[45:40] walk in absolute confidence of who you
[45:43] are and the world we live in this
[45:45] scripture should just cause our heart to
[45:48] burst amen because knowing that God's
[45:50] telling you right here can I read
[45:52] between the lines tonight amen he's
[45:54] telling you you cannot fall am no matter
[45:58] what would happen in your life my Grace
[46:01] will be there as your safety net and
[46:04] it's going to catch you no matter if
[46:05] Satan pours every Spirit every demon of
[46:08] hell and pursues you relentlessly my
[46:12] grace is sufficient for you oh I tell
[46:15] you I say thank you Lord amen for my
[46:19] strength is made perfect in weakness
[46:23] Paul is speaking here to the Corinthians
[46:25] and my brother and sister he's speaking
[46:27] of the things that God has spoken to him
[46:30] this is not Paul's opinion this is not
[46:32] Paul's interpretation but this is the
[46:35] very message that God gave Paul on the
[46:37] backside of a desert and so now I want
[46:40] you to see the sincerity of this coming
[46:43] forth is that Paul himself went through
[46:46] his whole life with the great burden
[46:49] that he was the least Among Us for what
[46:51] he had done to the body of Christ he
[46:54] carried a great burden a great level you
[46:56] might of guilt uh uh that Satan would
[46:59] try to throw back upon him and no doubt
[47:02] uh this just me as a man looking but no
[47:05] doubt he could remember of the faces of
[47:07] those that he had put to death of those
[47:10] that he threw in the prison but yet Paul
[47:13] this Revelation was so real to him that
[47:16] he could come and I believe from the
[47:18] complete sincerity of his heart he could
[47:21] come and speak the words that God spoke
[47:24] to him and declare my grace is
[47:27] sufficient for thee Paul and now Paul as
[47:30] a carrier of the word comes forth and
[47:33] now he is not saying hey this is my
[47:35] Revelation I'm bringing to you but he's
[47:37] now just the conduit that has come and
[47:41] declared what God was sharing and that
[47:43] is God's grace is sufficient and
[47:46] strength is made perfect in weakness
[47:49] amen now he's there speaking and he puts
[47:51] it in his words here he says uh most
[47:54] gladly therefore would I rather glory in
[47:56] my
[47:59] infirmity not boasting in the power not
[48:01] of what I have delivered and Spirits
[48:03] I've cast out and how deep God took me
[48:06] into the word of God I would rather tell
[48:08] you how little I am I would rather tell
[48:12] you how weak I am what my inabilities
[48:15] are that's what I want to tell you about
[48:18] and then I want to declare to you that
[48:20] my God delivered me out of that and
[48:24] brought me into his word that's oh oh
[48:27] Hallelujah that stir my heart many times
[48:29] it is the very nature of mankind that we
[48:32] would like to be able to to share of the
[48:34] great things and of us and God spoke to
[48:37] me and I prayed for this person and they
[48:39] were healed or delivered or this and
[48:41] that and that's wonderful my brother and
[48:42] sister but there's a time for us to
[48:45] acknowledge I am nothing without him I
[48:48] have no strength I have no knowledge I
[48:50] have no I am not sufficient but in him
[48:55] oh in my weakness
[48:57] he is made strong and I think that's
[48:59] something Saints we can glory in tonight
[49:02] is that we don't have to come it's not a
[49:05] boast of our ability it's not a boast of
[49:08] accomplishment but it is boast that God
[49:11] has never failed us amen that no matter
[49:14] what we come up against and no matter
[49:16] what our struggle might be as we would
[49:18] find ourselves maybe fading as it were
[49:21] as the flower In the Heat of the day we
[49:23] find oursel fading we find God raising
[49:26] us up oh hallelujah amen that the power
[49:31] of Christ see it's in the weakness amen
[49:35] it's not in the boasting or strength but
[49:38] in the weakness that the power of Christ
[49:41] comes and rests upon us hallelujah
[49:44] because when a man tells you how great
[49:45] he is he's speaking often times from
[49:48] vanity amen now we have to be careful we
[49:51] don't judge someone that way to to
[49:54] acknowledge that God has done great
[49:56] things to acknowledge that God has come
[50:00] and healed at the hands being laid upon
[50:02] in prayer that God has come and
[50:04] delivered under the power of prayer we
[50:08] want to be careful we don't look at all
[50:09] these things and say Vanity Vanity
[50:11] that's right but you'll find that when a
[50:14] man feels a
[50:16] need to lift himself
[50:19] up it's because he sees something in
[50:22] himself that is great or trying to
[50:26] acknowledge I say God help us we're not
[50:29] worthy of nothing but death but he
[50:32] granted life and I say tonight thank you
[50:34] Lord amen my heart just just is is oh
[50:39] you might say smitten and is just
[50:41] swelling within me to realize how much
[50:44] God loves us hallelujah isn't it
[50:48] wonderful amen because he you see he
[50:50] wants to see
[50:53] you
[50:54] weak yep yeah
[50:57] that's exactly right that the Holy Ghost
[51:00] can come down in you amen that's exactly
[51:02] right and make something out of us amen
[51:06] not eyes of
[51:08] man but to the plan of God exactly
[51:15] right you see we recognize it's not the
[51:18] strength of the believer
[51:21] no no sir the scripture clearly tells us
[51:25] that's right that when we would be
[51:27] lifted up that's it is when we fall into
[51:30] Satan's
[51:31] trap amen so it's not the strength of
[51:34] the believer but it's the strength of
[51:35] the Life in The Believer amen that's
[51:38] right Hallelujah and if God is in you
[51:40] and I tonight my brother and sister we
[51:42] cannot fail we've got every bit of
[51:45] strength we've got every bit of
[51:46] authority we can stand upon the word of
[51:49] God and if we do slip and Satan would
[51:51] say oh I got you right there God's
[51:53] already got a remedy that we can stand
[51:55] on our heart would say oh Lord forgive
[51:57] me and when we find confidence to press
[52:00] forward just on the way to church sister
[52:02] Jerry and I listening to the prophet
[52:04] he's talking about the lady that got
[52:06] caught up in the Social Circle and her
[52:08] daddy got put upstairs reading a
[52:11] encyclopedia on geography or whatever
[52:13] and she just wanted to be quiet while
[52:15] the Social Circle is going on but pretty
[52:18] soon the house begins to shake and he
[52:20] starts a screaming and a holler and she
[52:22] goes up there daddy you don't even have
[52:23] your Bible what's going on and he said
[52:25] oh honey I was just reading in this book
[52:28] right here and there's a sea and they
[52:30] can't find the bottom of it he said oh
[52:32] hallelujah hallelujah to know that my
[52:35] sins are in the sea of God's
[52:37] forgetfulness and he can't even remember
[52:40] brother brandom goes on to say you see
[52:42] you and I can't forget that's it but the
[52:45] amazing thing is is that God can forgive
[52:47] us and then completely did you hear me
[52:51] completely not 98% not 99% not 99 9% but
[52:57] then God can completely forget about
[53:00] that when it's there under the blood of
[53:02] Jesus Christ oh don't you wish as humans
[53:05] we could do that Hallelujah many a
[53:07] husband many a wife you know if they
[53:09] have troubles in their life you know
[53:11] they get to argueing I'm not talking
[53:13] about people here I'm not meaning
[53:15] anybody in general but just overall they
[53:17] get to argue and something gets up maybe
[53:19] they've been married for 20 years you
[53:21] know and maybe the wife will say well
[53:23] you know after we was married just 3
[53:25] months you promised me this and you
[53:27] never done
[53:28] it well I'll tell you what the man will
[53:32] stand there I can almost assure you the
[53:33] man will stand there and say did I
[53:34] really do that I don't remember doing
[53:36] that is that possible would I have said
[53:39] that and the odds already
[53:42] did but you see we as
[53:47] humans
[53:52] humans we're completely capable of
[53:55] forgiving
[53:57] right Sons and Daughters of God
[53:58] completely capable of forgiving if not
[54:01] we need to get to the altar
[54:03] ourselves but one of our greatest
[54:05] battles is the
[54:07] memory to forget about those things but
[54:11] I tell you if you have forgiven it
[54:14] that's right then it should not bring
[54:17] any ey to you that's it it should not
[54:21] raise your blood pressure No it should
[54:24] not cause you to clinch your teeth or
[54:26] your
[54:27] fist if you've truly forgiven it if you
[54:31] find yourself having this kind of
[54:34] reaction then you might need to go back
[54:37] and let the last drgs of that go to the
[54:39] Altar and let it pass away to
[54:44] remember yes sir yes sir yes sir that's
[54:47] actually you know that's one of the
[54:49] reasons you see that we become tired now
[54:53] this is a human nature this is the
[54:55] element we're dealing with
[54:56] that God uses this the way he created us
[54:59] he uses this actually to move us it's
[55:03] not always what we would see as some
[55:05] visual Supernatural but God actually
[55:07] lets us as Sons and Daughters of God get
[55:10] to the place that we are sick and tired
[55:13] of being sick and tired of the condition
[55:16] of our
[55:17] life and that moves us you say well it
[55:20] was powerful preaching it was this it
[55:22] takes this to do it it takes a Revival
[55:24] an evangelist of this sometimes it just
[55:27] God comes down and anoints you to be
[55:28] sick and tired of the position you're in
[55:31] and then you realize I don't have to be
[55:33] in this position maybe the preaching uh
[55:35] reminds you I don't have to be in this
[55:37] position I I have made a decision that
[55:40] placed me here but now Lord I'm Letting
[55:42] Go with this I'm letting go of my anger
[55:45] at my husband my wife my children my
[55:47] parents the pastor the this the that uh
[55:50] the conditions of all these things I'm
[55:52] letting go of that so that I can be free
[55:55] amen amen that's the Liberty I'm looking
[55:57] for it's not about them my brother and
[56:00] sister I preached it many times I'll say
[56:02] it again tonight it's not about the
[56:04] trial but it's how you react to it
[56:06] that's right amen you can react and find
[56:09] Victory or you can react and find stress
[56:12] and strains right once again I want to
[56:14] reiterate this it's not the strength
[56:17] that you have no sir it's the strength
[56:19] of the life in you that's amen Hebrews
[56:24] 11:38 of whom the world was not worthy I
[56:27] can say Amen they were a people that
[56:30] this world was not worthy but you know
[56:32] God's replicating that there's people
[56:35] walking on this earth right now that
[56:38] this world is not worthy of
[56:40] them they wandered in deserts and
[56:42] mountains and dens and caves of the
[56:44] earth and these all having obtained a
[56:46] good report through faith never even got
[56:49] the promise right now you talk about my
[56:53] brother and sister Faith holding on to
[56:55] something you know we've all seen the
[56:57] the little example of it the proverbial
[57:00] uh uh little donkey pulling the cart
[57:02] with the pole with the carrot hanging on
[57:04] it now I don't mean to imply that's how
[57:07] God works right but you see the Promise
[57:09] was always out in front of them and they
[57:13] were always looking to that
[57:16] promise but they never obtained
[57:21] it you see God has led his word or put
[57:24] in such a way that every
[57:27] should every believer
[57:30] should be looking for the coming of the
[57:32] Lord in their
[57:33] day now if you'd understand me tonight
[57:36] there's the
[57:38] carrot there's the carrot if you
[57:40] understand I don't mean that
[57:41] disrespectful but God's putting it in
[57:44] front of the people this is the day this
[57:47] is the day and you live like that and
[57:50] you know why God did that cuz we're
[57:54] humans I I'm a firm believer Saints this
[57:58] is just opinion throw it out if you
[57:59] don't like it but I'm a firm
[58:02] believer that if God showed us that he
[58:05] wasn't coming till
[58:07] 2024 we'd get pretty
[58:10] sloppy we would just church going would
[58:13] be a formality and when it come on
[58:15] Easter morning morning 2024 we'd all be
[58:18] prayed up and ready to go but that's not
[58:21] way God wanted it he wants us prayed up
[58:23] and ready to go every single day amen
[58:27] that's so God has he puts that in such a
[58:29] fashion that we but you know what it
[58:31] becomes the very life nobody's behind us
[58:33] saying Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready do
[58:37] we have gentle reminders you know I
[58:39] shared that quote with you and
[58:41] scriptures concerning how that the Holy
[58:44] Spirit brother Bram says you know he
[58:46] hammers the dross out of you he takes
[58:49] that gospel hammer and he hammers that
[58:53] dross out of you now I'll tell you God
[58:55] knows what he's doing so they all had a
[58:58] good report you couldn't find fault in
[59:00] their life but they didn't receive the
[59:02] promise but now look at verse 40 God
[59:05] having provided some better thing for us
[59:09] now I you know people have questioned
[59:10] before do you think that we have more
[59:12] than they did in other ages what does
[59:13] this scripture
[59:15] say God's provided something better for
[59:19] us that they without us should not be
[59:22] made perfect so the final ingredient of
[59:26] the final age right the the
[59:29] bride right that's
[59:32] usen the spirit anointing us we say
[59:37] come we're the one anointed in this hour
[59:40] my brother and sister to speak the good
[59:43] news of the Gospel we're the one that's
[59:46] anointed to live this good news out and
[59:49] in the Fulfillment of that we now
[59:52] finishing the work that they lived and
[59:55] preached
[59:56] all those ages we now coming to the
[59:59] fullness of that we don't drop the Baton
[1:00:03] you all know what a relay race is amen
[1:00:05] you know many times you see it uh you
[1:00:08] know you you could probably go on the
[1:00:10] Internet or something and just find
[1:00:11] something that shows every one of them
[1:00:12] that ever dropped it but it don't matter
[1:00:14] how well the race was run my brother and
[1:00:17] sister when they come to the last hand
[1:00:20] off which was the leodan age amen when
[1:00:24] the Baton was handed off off if that
[1:00:27] gets
[1:00:28] dropped then then all the effort of all
[1:00:31] the rest is just falling
[1:00:35] out you see God knew and we don't want
[1:00:38] to be boastful get lifted up but you see
[1:00:40] I think it would be fair to say that God
[1:00:42] saved some of his very best for this
[1:00:44] last day to grab the Baton of this
[1:00:47] gospel and be able to run not looking at
[1:00:50] what today is not looking at this but as
[1:00:53] we spoke on Sunday to give our
[1:00:56] best amen you don't want the guy that's
[1:00:59] going to run with the Baton who says uh
[1:01:02] oh I'm far enough ahead of everyone I
[1:01:04] can just slow down and walk and wave at
[1:01:06] everybody you don't want that guy you
[1:01:07] want the guy who runs the race that is
[1:01:09] set before him and he runs it in
[1:01:11] sincerity and he runs it with all that
[1:01:14] is within him to finish this race amen
[1:01:18] so as God has given some better thing
[1:01:20] for us amen what was he doing he's
[1:01:23] giving us now study this out if you need
[1:01:26] to the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:01:29] this is the hour that the fullness of
[1:01:31] the godhead bodily is expressed and God
[1:01:34] said I'm going to manifest myself so
[1:01:37] clearly in the people of this age there
[1:01:40] will be no doubt that it's me and not
[1:01:43] them there'll be no doubt it's not a
[1:01:46] special race as in an Aryan race or a
[1:01:49] this or that but it will be that special
[1:01:52] race of people that are able to go to a
[1:01:55] backside of their desert and die out and
[1:01:58] come forth telling this is what God says
[1:02:00] I can live it you can live it this is
[1:02:03] the word his grace is
[1:02:06] sufficient Hallelujah I want you to just
[1:02:08] think about how incredible that was in
[1:02:11] its day for them to grasp that just as
[1:02:15] it was in L uh Luther's day to grasp the
[1:02:18] idea that the just shall live by faith
[1:02:21] we'll look at that and say Yes praise
[1:02:23] the Lord that's good but imagine the
[1:02:25] revelation when it struck
[1:02:29] them am come on I want you to grasp that
[1:02:33] when that Revelation struck
[1:02:35] them that was such an incredible thing
[1:02:38] and it would have become a lightning rod
[1:02:41] in the church Someone said no we live by
[1:02:44] the church we live by what the church
[1:02:47] said but when those that caught that
[1:02:50] Revelation the just shall live by faith
[1:02:53] and we can put in the prefix and add to
[1:02:56] the end of that how they do in this
[1:02:57] modern uh English uh put our little
[1:02:59] parentheses and add that context faith
[1:03:03] in the word amen you see it wasn't faith
[1:03:06] in Martin Luther it wasn't faith in the
[1:03:08] system it was faith in the word and when
[1:03:11] they read the word themselves for the
[1:03:13] first time and it struck a cord in their
[1:03:16] heart you weren't sending them back you
[1:03:19] weren't sending them back to some church
[1:03:20] you weren't sending them back to an
[1:03:22] organization because they had caught
[1:03:24] that revelation now brother Chad Lamb
[1:03:26] made a kind of a h a statement I might
[1:03:29] not have the exact words right but I
[1:03:31] just was listening to just a little clip
[1:03:34] uh uh brother Chad the other day brother
[1:03:36] Chad made this statement he said
[1:03:38] Revelation brings Warfare yes sir when
[1:03:42] you get a revelation of the word Satan
[1:03:45] is angry and you can expect that Nest
[1:03:50] you might say of Satan to be stirred up
[1:03:53] and you can see him then Onslaught the
[1:03:55] believer to try to get him to back up
[1:03:59] from this revelation of the word that he
[1:04:02] has received I tell you what my brother
[1:04:05] and sister when you are struck by
[1:04:06] Revelation you better make sure you got
[1:04:08] the armor on cuz Satan's going to come
[1:04:10] roaring out of the dark he's going to do
[1:04:12] everything he can to knock the wheels
[1:04:14] off of your wagon but you might as well
[1:04:16] just know that when God opens your heart
[1:04:18] and you see who you are you know it's a
[1:04:21] theme and I I say this just not that I
[1:04:24] have this great vast knowledge but but
[1:04:25] my brother and sister little tidbits
[1:04:27] come here and there and comments that
[1:04:29] come it's being preached in Europe and
[1:04:31] being preached in Africa South America
[1:04:34] who are you recognize who you are amen
[1:04:39] when that Revelation comes down Satan's
[1:04:41] going to come in and try and knock you
[1:04:43] away from the revelation of who you are
[1:04:46] cuz if he can get you back to being a
[1:04:48] churchgoer a church member uh relying on
[1:04:51] someone more spiritual than you to guide
[1:04:54] you if he can knock you back to that
[1:04:56] position then he's got control of you
[1:04:59] but when the bride of Christ recognizes
[1:05:01] who she is my brother and sister the
[1:05:03] prophet of God I call it a famous quote
[1:05:06] myself because it is very well read very
[1:05:09] well shared and when we recognize who we
[1:05:11] are we become the Invincible Army that's
[1:05:14] right Hallelujah but Satan wants to bind
[1:05:17] you he'll fight you over that that's
[1:05:18] right he'll fight you over that he don't
[1:05:20] want you to come to that position amen
[1:05:22] you see we're not called to fail no fail
[1:05:25] not a should not even be in our
[1:05:26] vocabulary that's right we shouldn't
[1:05:28] even know my brother and sister we know
[1:05:30] the goal that is set before us anyone
[1:05:32] here tonight anyone listening not know
[1:05:34] what that goal is if if you don't know
[1:05:36] what that goal is we have missed
[1:05:38] something that's right we we have we
[1:05:40] haven't paid attention as ministers we
[1:05:43] know what the goal is my brother and
[1:05:44] sister it's not to get a great big
[1:05:46] church it's not to be popular in fact I
[1:05:50] think the prophet of God basically said
[1:05:51] when our church gets too big and the
[1:05:53] mayor of the city starts to come we
[1:05:55] should get nervous that's right I don't
[1:05:57] think we'll have to worry about that
[1:05:59] hallelujah it's not to get to a great
[1:06:01] big church it's to get a holy ghost
[1:06:03] experience amen amen get a personal
[1:06:07] knowledge of Jesus Christ now this is
[1:06:10] just something I'm studying so I I'm
[1:06:12] only going to throw this a little tidbit
[1:06:13] but my brother and sister if you have
[1:06:16] come you got saved you feel like you got
[1:06:19] the Holy Ghost but your life hasn't
[1:06:20] changed in the last 10 years you don't
[1:06:22] really know God that's right exactly
[1:06:26] right it's an Ever growing ever
[1:06:29] expanding experience it is not I met him
[1:06:34] and all is well no that's right it's an
[1:06:36] experience that is growing amen yes sir
[1:06:40] Hallelujah so we're looking for that
[1:06:41] Holy Ghost experience uh between us and
[1:06:44] God not us preacher and God pastor and
[1:06:46] God church and God but us and God Amen
[1:06:49] so what do we do we set our eyes on that
[1:06:52] goal and no matter what happens
[1:06:57] keep your eyes on the goal that's it
[1:06:59] that's it it don't matter my brother and
[1:07:01] sister what's happening around us amen
[1:07:05] hallelujah praise the Lord right you
[1:07:08] know it's a shame I'll just throw this
[1:07:10] out it's a shame that in America the
[1:07:12] best we have to offer for the President
[1:07:13] and Vice President is two crazy people
[1:07:16] yeah it's a real shame that's right but
[1:07:19] you see their craziness and all of
[1:07:21] Congress and Senate and whatever's
[1:07:23] craziness behind that has got nothing to
[1:07:25] do with this bride and where she's
[1:07:29] going so you see all of that becomes
[1:07:32] just the
[1:07:33] distraction where we get all caught up
[1:07:35] what's going to happen what's going to
[1:07:37] happen what's going to happen my brother
[1:07:39] and sister what's going to happen is
[1:07:40] this bride's going to keep pressing to
[1:07:42] the goal and she's going to keep her
[1:07:45] eyes on this goal and while the world is
[1:07:47] falling apart wait somebody preached
[1:07:49] about
[1:07:50] that world falling apart hallelujah what
[1:07:54] happened they're fall fall in apart
[1:07:56] we're focused right amen we're
[1:07:58] remembering what the word was we're
[1:08:00] remembering it's not about brother
[1:08:02] brandham as in the reference point being
[1:08:04] brother brandham brother brandham was
[1:08:06] the voice that God used to come and
[1:08:08] speak to tell you and I to stay focused
[1:08:12] on the goal Hallelujah so we're not as
[1:08:16] it were rallying around a certain sign
[1:08:19] but the prophet of God so clearly and
[1:08:21] such a nice little analogy isn't it just
[1:08:25] just such a nice little
[1:08:28] analogy we can use almost any City can't
[1:08:33] we we're almost there look it's
[1:08:36] Chicago let's stop on the road let's all
[1:08:39] get out and run around the sign yeah
[1:08:44] right run around the sign are you with
[1:08:51] me you can run around the sign but you
[1:08:54] haven't made it to the destination no
[1:08:55] you you got to keep your eyes on that
[1:08:58] goal and keep going cuz it won't matter
[1:09:01] how many times you run around that sign
[1:09:04] you won't be in Chicago that's right yes
[1:09:06] sir that's right
[1:09:08] Hallelujah I hope I said that polite
[1:09:12] enough amen see no matter what happens
[1:09:15] keep your eyes on the goal you see the
[1:09:16] prophet of God just read it tonight but
[1:09:18] I'm trying to keep this concise
[1:09:20] tonight sunny skies are not a sign of
[1:09:23] God's approval that's right cloudy guys
[1:09:25] are not a sign of God's disfavor that's
[1:09:28] right amen they are not the sign no sir
[1:09:32] that's right the sign is the
[1:09:34] manifestation of the word in other words
[1:09:38] God interprets his own word and when he
[1:09:39] said you know what my sign's going to be
[1:09:42] that the spirit amen the spirit's here
[1:09:44] the spirit's always been here but the
[1:09:47] bride now has to come into her rightful
[1:09:49] position and mate up with the spirit to
[1:09:53] be able to say come amen so this bride's
[1:09:56] got to be positionally placed in the
[1:09:58] right season under the right sign under
[1:10:00] the right word to be able to say come
[1:10:04] amen hallelujah amen oh thank you Lord
[1:10:08] amen thank you Lord I believe the sign
[1:10:10] is here amen amen I believe that bride
[1:10:12] is there she's calling out amen now I
[1:10:16] want to just add this in here just as a
[1:10:18] good example God keeps his word a very
[1:10:22] beautiful title to a sermon some time
[1:10:25] ago
[1:10:25] brother Dr ER Baxter was formerly my
[1:10:28] campaign manager he was telling me of an
[1:10:30] experience that he had and the boys had
[1:10:32] up in British Columbia they were all
[1:10:34] Champion Riders on bicycles Ernie said
[1:10:37] brother brandom I could get on my
[1:10:38] bicycle and go downtown get an armload
[1:10:40] of groceries come back never even touch
[1:10:42] the handlebars turned the corners going
[1:10:44] around the street cars automobiles never
[1:10:46] touch the handlebars he said certainly I
[1:10:48] was sure I could win that contest and
[1:10:51] said there was other writers there
[1:10:53] equally as good as I or better and the
[1:10:55] contest was to ride 200 yards on a 14-in
[1:10:58] plank and not fall off and the plank was
[1:11:00] about 3T High get on this plank and
[1:11:06] ride H don't sound like too big of a
[1:11:09] deal does
[1:11:11] it well he said when I got up on there
[1:11:14] knowing that I was a
[1:11:18] genius yeah we've all met
[1:11:21] him he said I was sure I could ride that
[1:11:24] and ever who wrode it a new swin bicycle
[1:11:26] he said I got up on there and I didn't
[1:11:27] ride 25 ft till I fell off and another
[1:11:30] one got on and he did the
[1:11:33] same just as simple a little analogy
[1:11:36] about a a bicycle in a contest isn't
[1:11:40] this such a cute
[1:11:44] story he said we had a little old
[1:11:47] boy my goodness I didn't know he was
[1:11:48] allowed to use language like
[1:11:50] that had a little old boy around
[1:11:53] there and he wasn't very much of a rider
[1:11:55] and we were sure he wouldn't even get
[1:11:56] started but said somehow when this
[1:11:58] little lad got on there and they pushed
[1:12:00] him off down the plank he rode straight
[1:12:02] to the end went off just as perfect as
[1:12:04] anyone could ride that's amazing isn't
[1:12:07] it
[1:12:09] sometimes it's not the ones we
[1:12:12] expect brother Brenham said when you get
[1:12:16] there that's right you'll be surprised
[1:12:18] who is there that's right oh let's not
[1:12:21] get the most vocal or the best of this
[1:12:24] or the best of that it might be just
[1:12:26] that little boy as it
[1:12:29] were after he had won the bicycle we all
[1:12:31] got around him and asked him how did he
[1:12:33] do it and he said I'll tell you fellas
[1:12:35] the reason you lost the race you were
[1:12:37] looking down like this trying to keep
[1:12:40] your bicycle on the board I didn't care
[1:12:42] what's going on down here that's right
[1:12:45] huh you see the big picture I don't care
[1:12:47] what's going on down
[1:12:49] here amen I was looking at the end so I
[1:12:54] held steady amen oh if that isn't a
[1:12:57] lesson to the church don't look what's
[1:12:59] going on here watch the end and keep
[1:13:02] steady stay with God's word God keeps
[1:13:06] his word amen hallelujah my goodness
[1:13:10] Saints you can look right up here just
[1:13:11] as close as boyy Idaho now you know they
[1:13:14] they commissioned the phone company to
[1:13:16] set up two toll-free numbers that
[1:13:18] supposedly won't track uh who's calling
[1:13:21] and if your neighbor doesn't conform to
[1:13:24] our mandate which is not
[1:13:27] law it was just us saying you're going
[1:13:29] to do
[1:13:30] this call us and we'll send the
[1:13:34] police you see where this is heading
[1:13:37] training of a
[1:13:39] people and there was
[1:13:42] Daniel I hope you're with me I don't
[1:13:43] need to tell the whole story in every
[1:13:45] detail do I he had a choice you pray to
[1:13:49] your God and the decree made a
[1:13:53] declaration Daniel had a choice open the
[1:13:57] shutters or close the
[1:13:59] shutters and what happened the Mayor's
[1:14:03] tollfree Hotline that Daniel guy is
[1:14:05] doing it
[1:14:10] again Daniel it's been
[1:14:14] reported that you were
[1:14:16] praying and you can't pray to anything
[1:14:19] but the king and his
[1:14:23] stuff look where we're headed Saints you
[1:14:26] say oh brother Paul that's not it no
[1:14:28] it's the foundation of it it's the
[1:14:30] spirit working its way in where we as a
[1:14:33] nation on a religious foundation will
[1:14:36] have no problem turning in another
[1:14:38] Christian right they're not following
[1:14:40] the rules you know they just gave a a
[1:14:43] pastor of a church back East they just
[1:14:45] gave him a I think
[1:14:47] $155,000
[1:14:49] fine because someone in his church or
[1:14:52] was visiting the church saw someone fist
[1:14:57] bump someone else in the church and that
[1:15:01] was against the Mandate of no physical
[1:15:03] contact right
[1:15:06] $155,000
[1:15:10] fine see where we're
[1:15:12] headed might not be very long before

[1:15:28] think we should shut the video off I

[1:15:33] windows not let any visitors in any
[1:15:36] longer make all of you sign a an
[1:15:39] agreement that you won't tell anybody

[1:20:29] getting
[1:20:31] married that sounds a stumper doesn't
[1:20:34] it she's not thinking about getting
[1:20:37] married she's already accepted her
[1:20:42] bridegroom amen it's not a thought of it
[1:20:45] might be or it could be she has already
[1:20:49] declared he is my husband that's right
[1:20:53] he is my bridegroom he received me I've
[1:20:58] received him amen so she's not just
[1:21:01] talking about someday oh there's going
[1:21:03] to be Rapture
[1:21:04] someday Saints be careful don't let it
[1:21:07] be empty words don't let it be lip
[1:21:09] service that we're going to go in a
[1:21:10] Rapture let it be something that comes
[1:21:13] from the depth of the heart I'm going in
[1:21:15] a Rapture I'm already he's coming back
[1:21:17] for me he promised you see that cute
[1:21:20] little story once again has a completely
[1:21:22] scriptural basis that is there that when
[1:21:25] he showed up in the wagon she didn't say
[1:21:27] now look I'm not ready to go today we
[1:21:28] can go tomorrow we can go in the
[1:21:31] morning no she was ready she was ready
[1:21:35] because she believed his word and she
[1:21:36] said I'm prepared I haven't made a big
[1:21:39] fan Fair everybody else is dancing and
[1:21:41] having a party she sat in there and swed
[1:21:43] her a garment oh are you with me tonight
[1:21:46] right hallelujah amen Philippians 3:13 I
[1:21:50] need to hurry here
[1:21:53] hallelujah brethren
[1:21:55] I count not myself to have
[1:22:00] apprehended do we fully understand that
[1:22:07] scripture he's telling us I don't view
[1:22:11] this that I have already done
[1:22:14] enough I don't view this as though I
[1:22:18] have already checked off everything that
[1:22:20] needs checked off I don't view this as
[1:22:22] though I've already obtained
[1:22:26] this in one sense you can say he already
[1:22:28] had though just the same as you and I
[1:22:32] can say we have already obtained it are
[1:22:36] you with
[1:22:38] me
[1:22:40] right I count not myself to apprehended
[1:22:43] but this one thing I do forgetting those
[1:22:46] things which are
[1:22:47] behind reaching forth into those things
[1:22:51] which are before amen you see that right
[1:22:54] there saying sorry to sound like an
[1:22:56] English teacher or something but that
[1:22:58] right there the context of that gives
[1:23:00] you the understanding that he is still
[1:23:04] actively involved and pursuing what it
[1:23:08] is that he's talking about apprehending
[1:23:10] right in other words he's not sitting on
[1:23:12] his Laurels I believe the message God
[1:23:14] sent a prophet we're done everything's
[1:23:16] fine no sir actively this bride amen is
[1:23:20] actively pursuing her position at the
[1:23:25] bride amen she's actively moving into
[1:23:28] that actively declaring that actively
[1:23:32] living that amen so she's not looking at
[1:23:35] what's behind whether those are
[1:23:37] disappointments or those are
[1:23:38] accomplishments she's not looking to
[1:23:40] what's behind amen I almost put in
[1:23:42] tonight a quote that's uh been I've used
[1:23:45] it a couple times Through The Years
[1:23:46] where brother brandham says you know
[1:23:48] we're not looking at what was done 50
[1:23:50] years
[1:23:51] ago think about it think think about it
[1:23:54] we're not looking back 50 years Saints
[1:23:57] God's right here today and we are
[1:23:59] actively
[1:24:01] apprehending what is necessary for this
[1:24:04] bride to go to her rapturing marriage
[1:24:09] supper Amen to move forward into this
[1:24:12] position she's called to and the reason
[1:24:14] she does that is she knows she's called
[1:24:16] it's not doctrine of the church it's not
[1:24:18] doctrine of the message it's Revelation
[1:24:21] and she knows that when she declared
[1:24:23] that Revelation that I am the bride of
[1:24:24] Christ that she had to face her
[1:24:29] cousins who mocked her who do you think
[1:24:32] you are yeah that's right she had to
[1:24:35] push against that no doubt they did
[1:24:36] everything they could to hinder her but
[1:24:39] she just kept pressing into it amen
[1:24:41] because she was
[1:24:43] confident I press toward the mark for
[1:24:46] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:24:49] Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as
[1:24:52] be perfect amen H amen somebody's
[1:24:56] perfect amen be thus minded and if
[1:25:00] any and if in anything ye be otherwise
[1:25:04] minded God shall reveal even this unto
[1:25:07] you see what are we doing going back to
[1:25:10] that lovely little story just keep your
[1:25:12] eyes on the End Amen don't worry about
[1:25:14] it my brother and sister don't worry
[1:25:17] about What doctrine is moving in the
[1:25:18] message that's right don't worry about
[1:25:21] what influences are moving in the
[1:25:23] message don't worry about what one
[1:25:25] church is doing over here and one church
[1:25:27] is doing over there keep your eyes on
[1:25:30] the goal amen be persuaded just as I
[1:25:33] shared with you the other on Sunday
[1:25:36] there's only two camps that's it
[1:25:38] persuaded and not persuaded Hallelujah
[1:25:42] don't be looking around you well we've
[1:25:44] got family here we got family there
[1:25:46] we've got this friends here we got
[1:25:47] friends over there don't look at that
[1:25:49] don't look at that keep your eyes on the
[1:25:50] end of that that little boy wouldn't
[1:25:52] have wi any farther than the rest of if
[1:25:54] he'd have been riding down there and
[1:25:55] saying daddy look what I'm doing mama
[1:25:58] look what I'm doing girlfriend look what
[1:26:00] I'm
[1:26:01] doing would have fell right off of there
[1:26:03] amen but the fact of the prize was not
[1:26:07] to impress the people around
[1:26:09] him but to
[1:26:12] obtain the prize which for him was that
[1:26:16] swin
[1:26:17] bicycle Hallelujah
[1:26:29] I'm going to jump down a little bit
[1:26:32] here oh well what's another minute he
[1:26:35] told the Pharisees said search the
[1:26:36] scriptures in them you think you have
[1:26:38] eternal life and they are they that
[1:26:39] testify of me they tell you who I am
[1:26:42] they should know it so ought they know
[1:26:44] it today it's not a big bunch of Racket
[1:26:47] or a fuss or a carryon or a lot of noise
[1:26:50] it's Jesus Christ manifested among his
[1:26:53] people right the scripture says so
[1:26:55] notice now that makes it true when God
[1:26:58] says so and we find now the only way
[1:27:00] that he can reveal is to come into you
[1:27:03] that's it amen that's it m not into the
[1:27:06] doors of the church not into a certain
[1:27:08] church or not into the pastor into you
[1:27:13] hallelujah thank you
[1:27:17] Lord yeah quite honestly I mean that
[1:27:19] just leaves a little side note I'm quite
[1:27:22] honestly can't even fathom why
[1:27:25] pastors would want to have their hand in
[1:27:27] every family and every individual's life
[1:27:30] and like puppets control them that's a
[1:27:33] lot of strings how would you keep them
[1:27:35] how would you keep them all straight use
[1:27:36] your toes you'd have to use your
[1:27:39] toes yeah then you'd have to probably
[1:27:42] have some helpers then you'd have to be
[1:27:44] tell them not enough too much right left
[1:27:48] see I don't understand that there's one
[1:27:49] leadership that we as a body of
[1:27:51] Believers need and that's the Holy Ghost
[1:27:53] that's right we don't need to become
[1:27:55] nobody's puppet we don't nobody sticking
[1:27:57] their nose in our life and saying don't
[1:27:59] do this and don't do that and you
[1:28:00] shouldn't this and you shouldn't that
[1:28:02] that's that's the Holy Ghost amen and
[1:28:05] when we get surrendered to God and we
[1:28:07] finally get fully persuaded when we are
[1:28:10] absolutely convinced of who we are all
[1:28:13] the garbage just slowly gets washed away
[1:28:16] and Falls away it's when we're not
[1:28:18] persuaded that the junk happens amen and
[1:28:21] it's just that simple my brother and
[1:28:23] sister when we're not persuaded is when
[1:28:25] the devil shows up with a credit card
[1:28:27] application the devil shows up with all
[1:28:29] kinds of Cheetos and Pepsi and all the
[1:28:32] problems start happening in life but
[1:28:33] when we get persuaded we're able to look
[1:28:35] at that and say sorry that's not good
[1:28:37] for me I'm not going to do it amen amen
[1:28:40] that's why you know I'm a firm believer
[1:28:42] I'm getting sidetracked sorry but I'm a
[1:28:44] firm believer that we don't have to
[1:28:45] preach Morality In the church the Holy
[1:28:47] Ghost does that for us amen all we got
[1:28:49] to do is get the Holy Ghost in the
[1:28:51] church and then we don't have to go
[1:28:52] around trying to put out all these
[1:28:54] little fires and all these little
[1:28:55] troubles and and and Johnny run off with
[1:28:57] Susie and and they're doing this and
[1:28:59] that's doing that and our teenagers are
[1:29:01] behaving like a devil and oh what are we
[1:29:03] going to do now no let's get God in the
[1:29:05] church keep him in the church so keep
[1:29:07] the church on fire God will take care of
[1:29:09] the rest I expected you guys to lift the
[1:29:12] roof off
[1:29:14] Hallelujah is coming to you he is he can
[1:29:17] and he is the word and the word in you
[1:29:19] then the Holy Spirit reveals Christ
[1:29:21] through the word after he after after
[1:29:24] did we see that big word after he gets
[1:29:28] in you that's well we can talk about it
[1:29:31] can be part of our our uh what do they
[1:29:33] call that when you have that deal you
[1:29:34] repeat to get into church um
[1:29:38] um churches you know do that like you're
[1:29:40] going to join our church you have to say
[1:29:42] the Apostles Creed couldn't think of
[1:29:46] that you know you repeat this and you're
[1:29:49] saved no no no no it's after he Christ
[1:29:53] the the word gets in you amen he is in
[1:29:57] you you must take his word see well my
[1:29:59] church don't believe that all right
[1:30:00] you'll never get in see when you refuse
[1:30:03] the word you're refusing him hallelujah
[1:30:07] we're right down to the end here I'll
[1:30:09] leave off this last quote it's just a
[1:30:11] too good to leave off
[1:30:16] but what's another five
[1:30:20] minutes amen for thou art my lamp oh
[1:30:24] Lord and the Lord will lighten my
[1:30:28] darkness you know we could just stop
[1:30:30] right there and make a whole sermon
[1:30:31] right out of that amen I don't have to
[1:30:34] worry about the darkness of Leo to see
[1:30:36] I've got a lamp amen for by Thee I have
[1:30:39] run through a troop and by my God have I
[1:30:42] leaped over a wall as for God his way is
[1:30:46] perfect and the word of the Lord is
[1:30:48] tried sir so we don't have to question
[1:30:50] it it's already been
[1:30:52] proven he is a buckler to all that trust
[1:30:55] in
[1:30:56] him for who is God save the Lord who is
[1:31:00] a rock Save Our God Amen God is my
[1:31:03] strength and power and he maketh my way
[1:31:07] amen perfect amen right isn't that
[1:31:11] reassuring that we can read this
[1:31:13] scripture make that declaration but
[1:31:16] brother Paul my way is not perfect he
[1:31:18] says it is he says it is let's just
[1:31:21] believe the Lord he says our way is it's
[1:31:24] going to be perfect Hallelujah that's it
[1:31:27] Hallelujah had a couple side notes on
[1:31:29] that but I believe you have the point

[1:31:35] be is't this
[1:31:38] beautiful it's a perfect place calling
[1:31:41] you to that Perfection that's
[1:31:45] it it's not a ghetto it's not something
[1:31:47] run down it's not a failure not a failed
[1:31:50] social
[1:31:52] experiment perfect Place calling you to
[1:31:55] that Perfection and you have to be
[1:31:57] perfect to get there that's
[1:31:59] right now if God made a place for you

[1:32:06] heart we got a place a little name card
[1:32:08] he might say as it would be in our our
[1:32:10] normal world that says right here is
[1:32:13] where you're going to be seated that's
[1:32:15] right not by chance not an accident
[1:32:18] right God
[1:32:20] knows be therefore perfect even as your
[1:32:23] Father in Heaven is perfect it's a
[1:32:25] perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect
[1:32:28] people come because you have to stand
[1:32:30] and be
[1:32:32] married oh so he's
[1:32:35] come that's right that's right now I
[1:32:39] want you to catch this I want to just
[1:32:40] throw this off to you just real quick
[1:32:43] the prophet of God very carefully showed
[1:32:46] us that the marriage between be good for
[1:32:49] our young people to understand this
[1:32:51] maybe we need to teach this in our young
[1:32:53] people's
[1:32:55] the marriage between a young man and a
[1:32:57] young woman doesn't come in the white
[1:33:00] dress and the tuxedo and kissing the
[1:33:02] bride before the people the prophet of
[1:33:05] God clearly shows us that the marriage
[1:33:09] is in the giving and The Taking of The
[1:33:12] Vow amen so when a young man young woman
[1:33:16] might be sitting you know on the Park
[1:33:18] Bench looking out over the lake and the
[1:33:19] Moon is shining on it and they feel all
[1:33:22] warm and cozy and he would turn to to
[1:33:23] her and say would you marry
[1:33:26] me and she says
[1:33:28] yes the only thing that can undo that is
[1:33:31] the girl's
[1:33:33] father saying
[1:33:36] no otherwise that vow is binding now I
[1:33:40] want to sound crass but they give a kiss
[1:33:41] and a hug and life goes on and they
[1:33:43] marry somebody else they broke that vow
[1:33:45] that's right that's why this whole
[1:33:47] cording and stuff is not a game it's not
[1:33:49] just something we just flop around I got
[1:33:51] a boyfriend I got a girlfriend I go here

[1:33:56] I'll find the right guy some no no it's
[1:33:58] serious business and I want you to tie
[1:34:01] this right back right here to see this
[1:34:03] see as we're coming down because you
[1:34:05] have to stand and be married to the
[1:34:09] perfect Son of God and you must be a
[1:34:13] perfect bride amen take that natural
[1:34:16] take that spiritual right we're not
[1:34:18] wanting somebody that's all kissed on
[1:34:20] and all whatever and hugged on and
[1:34:21] whatever see God doesn't want a church a
[1:34:24] bride that's all kissed on and she's
[1:34:26] over here today and over there tomorrow
[1:34:28] God wants that Perfect Bride amen so how
[1:34:33] can you do it through anything else but

[1:35:09] me Lord of my weakness and my failures
[1:35:11] and forgive me and he says I've already
[1:35:13] washed that my perfect blood has washed
[1:35:16] that into the sea of
[1:35:18] forgetfulness and I want you to be able
[1:35:20] to stand and with joy and thanks giving
[1:35:24] and confidence and say I am a perfect

[1:40:15] going to do you know this and then he
[1:40:17] changes his mind and he says you know
[1:40:19] Paul I want you to try the
[1:40:21] hurdles about 10 minutes later he says I
[1:40:24] I want you to just go back and do what
[1:40:25] you was doing before because you see if
