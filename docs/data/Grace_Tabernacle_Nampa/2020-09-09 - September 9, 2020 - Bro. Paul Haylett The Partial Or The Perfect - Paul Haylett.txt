unchanging [Music] hand amen wherever he is the word says we shall be also hallelujah how beautiful that is amen well we just want to remember each and every one that's not here tonight many needs in the body many circumstances that we all face in our lives and we just want to remember our brothers and sisters strengthen them amen just reading the prophet of God referring back to the scripture that we are one body amen and so we should never let the devil divide us never let him put something in the way you know he'll always throw some kind of stumbling block if he can Amen to cause us to look and say well they don't like me or they don't care for us or whatever but uh just remember that that's just the devil and he's just throwing that trash out you might say and if we'll just step over it and say well maybe my brother's having a hard time my sister's struggling something uh stress or whatever it might be maybe the devil's throwing trash in front of them also we'll just step over and claim a high position in Christ Jesus amen I want to speak to you once again on preparation of the inner man amen uh just uh Lord just keep working on us that's all I can say Lord just keep working on us I want to speak on the topic uh uh the title the part or the partial or the perfect amen uh so we can accept uh something that is less than all God's got for us or we can settle for the perfect amen and I believe that uh as we look at this we realize that accepting or being in the partial is actually a part of God's plan that we go for season we go for a time and God uses that time uh to condition us uh some people are conditioned to quit that's right some people are conditioned to settle for for just a a portion a small portion and call that enough uh but as God's working on the bride of Christ he he brings her he's continually moving moving her he's he's shaping her and she's growing amen and as she grows in the word the prophet of God said when she sees who she is right so she see who she was from the very beginning he said when she sees so there's a there's a movement of time and when she sees who she is I believe she's already received the word and said amen to it but God's opening her eyes and we'll have it if we can get to all of it tonight there's a portion where God brings it to a season and that is the completion or the Fulfillment amen let's just stand and go right to the word this evening in Matthew the 5th chapter starting with the 43rd verse amen uh and uh we just want to uh use this as a little groundwork Matthew 5:43 ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thine neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies now Saints you know God's working on you you know God has got a hold of you when you can come to that place you can love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you now I want to just throw this in real quick the prayer time we know in the day that we live in Satan's doing everything he can to bind our prayer life that's right and you see this anointing here when in an age that your prayer life is being bound it would only make sense that we pray for those we love but you see God said I want you to take some of this precious prayer time and I want you to pray for those that have despitefully used you I don't care what they did might have been Grievous amen we are compelled by the word that's right to pray for their Redemption pray for them to be able to come and recognize amen much easier In the Flesh though just to condemn them right you're in the pit that's right but that's not the word amen amen that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the E evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the Publican so be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings upon the word tonight father reveal it father in the way that you desire to Lord we speak this desire this in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now as we'll get along tonight we'll be touching on things that are perfect and the partial here as we are drawing this out of the message now my brother and sister uh we are cognizant and that you know might not be a common word uh it just simply means have knowledge or aware of we are cognizant that the things that the Lord ask us to do isn't always easy to do amen he calls us to make a sacrifice of this flesh he calls us to Die daily he calls us to uh uh not only to help others but to give as it were of a great portion amen not to be stingy not to be stubborn not to be rebellious but simply stand on that and as I brought up the other day I think God does not want us to go into the excuse trap of this person did something for me uh against me I mean you know I I I just there's no way I could pray for them no way I could this they've done this they've done that get away from the excuse trap and just simply say Lord your word says that I should pray for those who despitefully use me and make that a priority in your life not only as I've said before will it keep you soft but Prayer Changes Things amen and so as we stay away from the excuse trap uh and if we'll just trust and Obey he he said that he would make a way is that not the word amen he said he would make a way not we would make a way or we could make this happen but if we will allow God to work in our life and we trust and Obey he said he would make a away so it's not really Saints ex what we are capable of that's often times one of the factors that we weigh into is Lord I'm not capable of forgiving I'm not capable my brother and sister it's just Plum uh plain in the word of God that if you don't forgive you're not forgiven amen amen and people struggle with that they live good Godly lives but they hold on to something against someone and they justify that in their mind and and make statements I I could never forgive them well I'll tell you what you knew you need to eliminate that out of your vocabulary and say you know what Lord I I I'm not really I got such a bitter hurt but I'm going to allow you Lord to come in and keep tender washing me and doing you know uh sometimes you know you just have to put a little bit of Sav On that soore and and you got to keep after it you know to to get it to heal so we put the sav of the Holy Spirit of the word of God on our heart amen we put it down there and we just yield that to the Lord because you see it's not that we can do this but he through us can do it so it's not what we think we're capable of it's all about what he's capable of and when we deny God's ability to move in our life we're denying the very promised word of God for our day amen so we can't come and say Lord I I just never did that Lord because I wasn't capable what you're really saying is is Lord I couldn't do that because because I never trusted you because if you will trust him amen he'll come in well my brother and sister sometime he has to rip the scab off he got a I was talking with a brother about this and H sometime back sometimes you got you got a sword that won't heal you have to rip the scab off Let it bleed and then as it heals Let It Be purified and cleansed and it will heal as long as there's some kind of contamination in the healing process it will always be all all uh sorry for the word it's a little crude but all kind of and and whatever be oozing and and you know it recognize any nurse or doctor would look at a wound and they can recognize a wound that is contaminated simply because it is producing something that's not part of the healing process imagine that so sometimes people say well you know nobody sees my issue I guess I'm okay okay no really the issue is more obvious than we believe because it's producing something that's not part of the healing process amen so sometimes God just has to send someone in and they'll come and they'll preach or something will be said and it kind of rips the scab off and nobody shouts Hallelujah they just rip the scab off but you see it's part of the process amen so when we stop and and tonight we won't focus on this but we stop and look and we would literally start to write a list of what God is capable of I think we will find that everything in our life will be encompassed in that list we will not come to something that we would say well there was this need in my life and God was not capable my brother and sister he's capable of everything amen The Great I Am The King of Kings the Lord of lords the one who created this body knows exactly what is necessary to bring this body into a complete healing natural and spiritual amen so it's not about what we are capable hallelujah look right here in Jehovah Gyra now look Saints once again uh there is been some folks that thought I clipped quotes and whatever else to make it say what I wanted to say I'm sorry they feel that way I believe you know my heart I'm not here to play some kind of game or some kind of oneup thing but I just want this so you know sometimes you just pull something right out of something cuz you like what it says and this is what I did right here with this quote I liked what it said Jehovah Gyra now notice Abraham just an ordinary man is there any Ordinary People here tonight amen so we are on an even plane right now with Abraham oh think about it just an ordinary man but God by um anybody elected here tonight amen by election H anybody experience Sovereign Grace Hallelujah now what I'm trying to tell you is is Abraham wasn't something that was Out Of Reach for you now God didn't call you and I to be Abraham but he didn't call Abraham to be you either that's right think about that hallelujah amen Hebrews amen that they without us oh Hallelujah think about it you see they're waiting there's the cheering section you can do it brother you can do it sister stand on the word We need youen oh hallelujah we're down here Le to see a poor us of all the ages that we could have been in why' we have to be in this wicked time well every age recognize the wickedness of their day amen Sons and Daughters of God every age recognize the wickedness of their day it's really no different God equipped them God has equipped us hallelujah so by Sovereign Grace he called amen I put the he in there because we're talking about God he called Abraham nobody else did when there's many young men in the land in that day that was probably some more capable of doing the job why Abraham Lord I just can't do this I I want to be part of the Bride of this age Lord I Want To Live an overcoming life but Lord I mean look there's so many H H let's go on a capable hunt you're going to find people that are stronger smarter faster more intelligent come on Saints you'll find a list of people that will outshine you in fact the prophet of God said that in Zeal in this last hour in Zeal the uh uh make believe bride I'll put it that way will show a more abundant Zeal than the bride of Christ it's a quote that's right they'll have more Zeal so you're looking at us saying well you know look at them they're so excited they're doing this they're doing this they're doing this doing this I don't mean one single thing amen there was probably some more capable of doing the job as the world would think than Abraham was but God knows the man's intelligence his strength his Hallelujah he knows the heart and the heart that's here saying Lord I want your word Lord I Want to Be Like You Lord mold me make me Lord Wash Me prepare me Lord fill me with oil amen hallelujah he's looking for that kind of heart he can take any old kind of person to do the job reminds me of a friend of mine when I was growing up his grandfather this friend of mine was a quite strong kid we were very close in age so there was no difference there but I I think in my childhood he had to been at least twice as strong as I was everything I could do he could do it just twice as good but I remember you know sometimes this is just an intellectual thing so please don't misunder understand me but one time uh I I I was helping my friend uh do some stuff for his Grand father his grandfather was quite I don't know what you call a a a small man I mean I would say petite but I think of that as as uh you know to a lady but he was quite a small man just not great physical strength and one day we were doing this work and my my friend was doing this stuff and finally the grandfather stopped him and he says you know he said you ought to think about using your mind and not just your back yeah amen so my brother and sister when God come along he says what I want you to do is I want you to give me your heart not your mind see he wasn't he wasn't asking for I don't want your physical strength I don't want your mind I want your heart oh Lord that's right Lord wash me make my heart tender make it soft make it yield to you Lord I I want my heart to be the kind of Heart Right David was a man after God's own mind no after God's Own Heart amen that was the identifier that God used he said he's after my own Heart Lord hallelujah so you know I just put this in here because you see I think that puts it there's a lot more capable out here but that's not what God's looking for Hallelujah now we're going to start into a unique uh thought here be and we'll go as far as we can tonight uh because I have just this incredible amount of stuff out of the church age book that just has really struck me so we're going to kind of skip pretty fast through it uh if you don't mind till we come to some key points amen so Revelations 3:7 to the angel of the Church of Philadelphia right these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that is the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth oh how beautiful are those words How Majestic is even the sound of them how thrilling to think that all those attributes can be applied to one person who would dare to say such things about himself but Jesus Christ the lord of Glory yet we see in the day that we're living there's men who actually boast of these kind of attributes and things of their own tell you what I have done amen I believe the key to interpreting exactly what each of these wonderfully descripted phrases mean is found in verse 9 behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet to know that I have loved thee amen I say this verse is key because it deals with the Jews who have always called themselves the children of God to the exclusion of everyone else they crucified and killed the Lord Jesus their terrible deed brought their own blood upon on their own heads for centuries all because they refused Jesus as their Messiah which indeed he was to them he was not the coming one or the son of David to them he was be elub or some unrighteous one fit only for Destruction but not so now I want you to just insert here Saints isn't this beautiful how the plan of God said I want to open the door to those who were not but now are how wonderfully God opened that door for you and I amen look at The Strife that come to the Apostle Paul because he asserted against the will of even uh uh other Apostles that we are going to go preach this gospel to the Gentiles not just convert amongst the Jews but this is a gospel that belongs to every man woman boy and girl you see so if you want to take the backstory it's much deeper than we would recognize because see he's proving amen not only to the Jews will it come and one day they will come and look Saints this is just the way it is this is the word we won't go into the explanation tonight but you look at this my brother and sister the Jews when that comes those two prophets stand in their presence and are speaking the word to them and that day and they recognize and they ask him uh how did you get those scars and he tells them I got them in the house of my friends they're going to be preaching this same message it is not another message to the Jews it is the same message amen that is why my brother and sister I stand so firm that we need to identify the message as not a message of a certain man of a certain age but we need to identify the message as Jesus Christ because this message is going to go back to the Jews won't be about even a prophet to the Gentiles or a prophet to the age it will be about identifying Jesus Christ in their midst amen now you know where I stand on that there'll be some if they go ahead and listen will say whoa I don't like what he's saying but my brother and sister it quite simply this has to be the great as it were sign that is pointing to Jesus Christ hallelujah amen but not so he was indeed Emmanuel God manifest In the Flesh he is indeed Messiah surely he was exactly as he now sets himself forth to be there he is the same Jesus Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a holy one in the midst of the Lamb stands is the very same Jesus who walked the shores of Galilee do you see we get this that some people get confused it's like you know here's the thing well no no you you you you're making a mistake Paul because um no you're saying God is in us but that's the Holy Spirit but the prophet of God shows us clearly through the word it's all God so if you are talking about Jesus Christ you are talking about Lord Christ Alone however you want to word this holy spirit it's all God Amen and he come right down to to express himself in US brother Jason Watkins used this little phrase the other day amen he said God wants to get in your car amen hallelujah he wasn't talking about a literal automobile he was talking about you and I he wants to get in your car and go do the work that he needs done he needs someone to go over here and share the gospel he gets in your car Hallelujah I used it with a zipper and stepping inside however you want to express it it's all God hallelujah we're not here trying to chop him up and identify which part of him did this and which part did that and you got to have this pronoun and this adjective and whatever nonsense my brother and sister let's recognize it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that Holy One in the midst of the land stamps is the very same Jesus who walked on the shores of Galilee who healed the sick who raised the Dead and in spite of the irrefutable proof was crucified and killed but he rose again and is Seated on the right hand of the Majesty on highs the Jews did not call him holy then they do not call him holy now but he is the Holy One psalm 16:10 for Thou shalt not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption now you look at that my brother and sister I just want to bring this about there's some things here Lord help me to get to them tonight amen they sought their righteousness after the law and fail miserably have any of you been successful no we can't live it out under the law because what happens when we try to live it under the law we live it in such a strictness that when we come face to face with that our Humanity fails us and then all we can do is look in the mirror of our interpretation of the word and say I'm a failure Hallelujah that's a conclusion I don't care how bias anyone is amen look at some of these monks and some of these people they sleep on Stone beds because they're going to make that kind of sacrifice for God I read uh the writings of a man who had spent many many years as a monk and it wasn't until he was dying of something that was quite easy to fix and he had done a little secret research and realized he was dying and would die uh because he simply was what he was taught to refuse any other kind of help and something in him was crying out and so he he left the monastery went and went to a clinic they said you're a very sick man they sent him off to a hospital well at that moment right there they had kicked him out he was no longer part of the program you didn't line up to our law you're out but it was in the hospital or the recovery of that that somebody witnessed to him of Jesus Christ and we're not into this my heart said my heart felt but something inside of him said this is real oh my and we would say oh the poor man got sick no his sickness was actually you might say his salvation Hallelujah now salvation as we know was Jesus Christ but that's what put him in the position for someone to tell him what you're doing is works and it's failing right that's right 1 Corinthians 1:30 oh by the law no man can be made holy let me jump back they sought their righteousness after the law and failed miserably for by the law can no flesh be justified by the law can no man be made holy Holiness is of the Lord 1 Corinthians 1:30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption am now look when we look into this and here again it's just one of these things I'm going to hang out here my brother and sister the whole plan of the seventh seal can be boiled down if you had no other simple words or no other words to put it it is the manifested Plan of Redemption amen it was the whole Redemption that God had planned brought forth in this hour coming to a completeness or a fullness the prophet hid it in these simple words when he said everything you need for the Rapture is already in you Hallelujah he just gave you the seven seal in a nutshell everything you need amen God's already gave it to you just let it be manifested let the word come forth let it come to life Give It Room to Grow amen remind me one time we was at some people's house and and there was a tree there and there was other believers there and one of them said this is really weird this looks like an oak tree and and here's a tree in this in this pot and it's all nicely groomed and whatever but it's this little small tree and he said this looks like an oak tree but you know um it it can't be an oak tree and they said no it is an oak tree and it'll never grow any bigger than that because it has no place for its roots to go hallelujah amen want you to think about it God's opening the word what's he doing brother Trevor he's giv Our Roots a place to go amen he's opening more word and our roots are just growing and the wind is blowing and unbelief is shaking and darkness is on the Earth but God get us and he's letting Our Roots grow and all the word is being open to the bride and what's already in her is now being manifested and coming forth if she'd have been locked in that little pot she would have never have got it but God said I'll put you in a place by the rivers oh of Living Water and in that your roots are going to chop into that and you're going to grow grow grow and drink drink drink and push out push out push out hallelujah oh yeah oh wait I I'm not preaching deep enough am I hallelujah oh my 2 Corinthians 5:21 second part he said that we might be made the righteousness of God in him it was Christ or perish and they perish for their ref used him and Men of that age as even today were making the same mistake as the Jews took refuge in the synagogue form of worship so in the Philadelphian age they were taking refuge in the church and it is not joining a church that counts right oh come on Saints that thing is creeping right back in the message you need to belong to this movement if you're going to make a Rapture I'll tell you what I got an answer for that I need to belong to Jesus Christ and Christ Alone amen no building no name no identification but Christ alone and any other idea that is being pedal my brother and sister is a deception because it's not in the church we go to church the word says not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together but our real true assembling is not in a body and saying our refuge is this body it's the body of Jesus Christ that has become our refuge Hallelujah amen so we're not going to go back to a synagogue form of worship so in the Philadelphian age they were taking refuge in the church it's not joining a church that counts the life is not in the church the life is in Christ but I'll tell you what we can put Christ right here in this building we can make him welcome welcome the door can be open and we can come to the house of God and go home and say I felt the presence of God Amen but you come into into this building angry you come into this building backslid you come into this building you might not feel a single thing amen hallelujah this building won't do it for you that's right the life is in Christ this is the record that God hath given us to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son hath not life man is made holy by the spirit it is the spirit of Holiness that raised Jesus from the dead that indwells us and makes us holy with his Holiness oh my look at that do we believe these words were anointed Spirit of Holiness yes oh my my brother and sister Humanity's got a lot of things that influences it Holiness is a spirit we can say I believe the message and not have the spirit of Holiness that's right that's the difference of people borderline dressing borderline living amen right the spirit of Holiness missing right I'll just be a little more blunt that's what would cause a sister to step in front of the mirror before she walks out the door of her house and to say what image am I presenting that's right not the preacher yeah the preacher is talking about it right now but I'm here to encourage you not the preacher saying well you can't do this you can't do that it's Christ in you putting you in front of the mirror saying Lord I want to present myself a certain way now brothers are not exempt brothers and sisters I I'll just be blunt with you I I'm just not much for brothers running around with their buttons all undone and and part of their chest that's just as exciting to a woman as it is a a woman is to a man I I'm sorry to be that blunt but that's just the truth of it and when people come and they think that it's a one-sided thing I want my wife to look like this and like this and then they're running around in a certain fashion that the world finds attractive oh my brother and sister come on what's good for goose is good for Gander Hallelujah we want to be holy amen so it's a spirit that is on us it's not a law amen just like we want the Holy Spirit I think the spirit of Holiness is Right tied together okay I didn't offend the church did I okay well that's right the word cannot offend a son or daughter of God but sometimes our presentation of it can be a little rough God help us amen this is the record God has given us eternal life and his life is in his son he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the Son of God hath not life man is made Holy by the spirit it is the spirit of Holiness that raised Jesus from the dead that indwell and makes us holy with his Holiness now look as I told you a lot of reading here but this is stuff that just inspired me and I believe it's got a lot of nuggets H just tucked right in here and sometimes it's good for us to just get down to the creek get our shoes off and get our toes in the sand and start looking for nuggets that's right I met a man one time he said well I I took my family to this certain place that you know they used to mine for gold and and we're out walking through there and one of his kids says Daddy can we keep what we find and he said well honey I I guess that' be okay and his little girl says well I found this big fat Golden Rock hey sweetie give me no Daddy it's mine she found a gold nugget how'd she find it it appeared you might say between her toes and she squished her toes on it and like what is this my wife could do that pretty good I I would never be able to get get that nugget out of the sand and be like come on toes pick it up pick come on toes pay attention pick it up Sister Jerry she just I don't know there might be some of you like that but we're nugget digging it's what we're doing Saints amen we're not trying to find something that's just fits our idea but we're just through this word and we're finding the nuggets and I don't care whether it's between your toes or in your hand or however you find it just lay claim to it sir amen there he stands the Holy One and we will stand with him clothed in his right rightousness holy with his Holiness oh Hallelujah not our interpretation of it their terrible deed brought their own blood upon their own heads for centuries all because they refused Jesus as their Messiah which indeed he was to them he was not the coming one or the son of David to do we already read this seems like yeah seems like it yeah we did oh somehow okay okay excuse me Electronics but Jesus is a true bread from Heaven whereof Mana was just a type I think we're missing something Brothers let me go right back through here yeah I think we might have actually missed a little chunk here holy with his Holiness now in this sixth now this age is the sixth age in the eyes of God time is drawing to a close he will soon be coming back soon the cry will go forth as he comes and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still 11 Revelations 2211 oh I'm so glad that my Holiness is not of myself I'm glad that I'm in Christ and all his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yeah imparted unto me blessed be God forever these things saith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense that it is the opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with the partial realization you get that Hallelujah a uh perfect realization as contrasted with a partial realization now my brother and sister want to just speak this real blunt to those that might hear this otherwise I'm not here to offend anyone but my brother and sister a lot of people say I got a revelation of the message well if you have a partial Revelation and you decide that is the full Revelation you're not looking for more but if you come and say Lord I want all that you would choose to reveal to me Lord please I want to be in a position that you would choose amen the atmosphere that kind of uh approach to the word of God which means as a prophet I read you this quote the other day when God is going to ask you to do something special God wants a complete surrender amen amen he's not going to use you to do something special if you're still operating on your own operating system amen he wants you to operate on his amen expresses a perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization for example recall that Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven amen so you look at that Moses gave them bread but we want the god that is in heaven Jehovah Gyra the provider to bring us this bread from heaven we are not looking for a substitute we're not looking for bread as it were Mana in the wilderness we're wanting the bread of Revelation for this hour hallelujah we're not looking back see people get upset my brother and sister I'll just tell you right now not prophesying but I'm telling you there'll come a Great Divide in the message I believe myself that there will be two great divides in the message one of them will surround marriage and divorce and one of them will surround Revelation in the message now revelation in the message my brother and sister will be where this bread comes from one side is saying if you're not in the tapes the tapes only so becoming very strong voice if you're not just playing the tapes if you are listening to five-fold Ministry they're the ones that are the problem it's not what my Bible says no I'm not I'm not boosting the preacher Saints I think the preachers need scrutinize with a 10,000 power microscope and they better be able to back up what they got to say but to come along and make a statement that if you're going to make the Rapture you got to get away from the preacher is contrary to the book of Ephesians and when you go contrary to the word of God it don't matter who you are and to what degree you go contrary amen it's not just what well I they didn't go very very far my brother and sister it says one word let them be accursed well Hallelujah I'm brother so and so and I'm cursed as a minister but I want to preach to you tonight no none of us would said for that but I believe you're going to see this you say why did you say marriage and divorce brother Paul because that is a sign when marriage and divorce becomes a common just uh uh uh uh bantered around no big deal we can circumvent it thing in the message that means that it's been comp rised on the word and so it isn't confined just to marriage and divorce but it's a very very prominent indicator of someone who says uh we can change the message we can change the gospel and everything is still all right oh come on I know that's kind of straight preaching Saints but I'm telling you that the deceiving of the elect is not possible because the Prophet come all the way back in the beginning that was right there in his message and carried all the way through when he said take get back to the word don't settle for anything but the word why you take it back to the word it has nothing about confirming brother brandham as a prophet it's all about you and I looking at the road map reading the road map following the road map and the road map says this Lord I'm not going to come over here and say but you really must have meant this amen I don't care whose fingers it slaps in the door I don't care whose face gets hit in the door my brother and sister we step off the word of God and we'll if I can get myself going here we'll touch on that in just a minute they do not call him holy now but he is a Holy One amen I just want to make that point you see what is it my brother and sister he is the Holy One there's nothing else now look in this contrast as brother Brown's bringing out of perfect realization so we're looking at this he's saying uh Moses gave you this bread but my father gives you this bread and then in John 151 said I am the True Vine he's standing right there making a declaration open your eyes look I am the True Vine amen Hebrews 9:24 for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us amen look at this it's becoming clear it's becoming clear it's no longer a a partial understanding no longer a partial Vision no longer a partial seeing what this message is we're starting to see that that glass that was dark is clearing up for the bride of Christ amen it's not going to remain dark where the bride is just hoping she's just trying she's just dreaming of my brother and sister it's a vision that's opening before her and she realized she's part of the vision in fact she is the vision because the vision come from Heaven come from our Lord Jesus Christ amen and the bride is the manifestation of that wife oh Hallelujah the manifestation of Revelations 196 and 7 is sitting some of it right here in this church tonight the Fulfillment of that word we can reach out take a hold of that and say Lord there I am I'm identified your wife that's me Lord is making herself ready hallelujah oh what do we got to do brother Paul dig real deep in the word no you got to stay soft and tender you got to stay when the holy spirit says move you can move when he says stop he can stop when he says pray for that or talk to that person you can say Lord I'm out of my comfort zone but nevertheless nevertheless Lord I'm throwing the net in cuz that might be a Son of God might be a daughter of God I'll I'll just do what you ask Lord people look at you like you weirdo no problem there's weirdos everywhere Allelujah if you want to know about that just go look it up in the message search what brother Brown says about nuts Hallelujah everybody's a nut for something Hallelujah so we can be a nut for this world Amen oh Hallelujah yeah or a nut for the word that's right now going on here 1 John 2:8 also another representation of that because the darkness the darkness is passed and the True Light now shineth look at that Saints we can stand right on that that ought to just I'm just speaking this figuratively ought to just Propel us to our feet and we ought to be able to shout hallelujah the darkness is past I've been brought the light is shining on me oh Hallelujah when Millions are still in Gross darkness and God gives you light that is something to get excited about oh hallelujah oh since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before anti-type contrasted with type and the substance with Shadow take the example now of Mana from Heaven God sent down Angel bread from Heaven to Israel but that bread did not satisfy it it was only good for a day that's sometimes the way preaching is when the devil gets on us that's right I say this jokingly but serious walk out of church did the pastor preach about I don't know I can't remember just Mana for a day but not to be harsh sometimes the very next morning you wake up and it's like you you've been taken back in time and the word speaks to you and you say praise the Lord or maybe the very next day or two or three you're at work and something happens God's already fortified you and right then you felt bad because somebody said what' your pastor preach on um the Bible but it might be on Tuesday at work that word comes back alive to you and speaks to you Rises right up and you say oh praise the Lord praise the lord we are just human but sometimes our attention span you know I can remember years ago you might find this kind of sad but funny I was sitting in church I wasn't really serving the lord I just started farming a lot of lot of sacrifice a lot of old equipment one time I had a machine that just wouldn't work right and I remember I was sitting in church one Sunday morning I wasn't listening to the preacher I'm sad to admit that now that doesn't give you an excuse to pull revenge on me but the solution to my problem came to me right in church Hallelujah and somebody thought well maybe God's working on Paul it wasn't until years later I realized that was God just giv a little gift to me I was awall in church but he still gave me a little gift and said I I'm here for you buddy I'm here for you Lord H Hallelujah I would recommend though that when we go to church we think about church amen not about the barbecue and not about time at the park not about time here and time there and what we did wrong and what we're going to do right just kind of focus amen create the atmosphere amen it was all good for a day and those who ate it were hungry again the next day it was left around it become contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven whereof the Mana was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partake he had eternal life here indeed was reality not no need any longer for a shadow oh my brother and sister you know brother brandom preached you know that he's a type and Shadow preacher now I want you to to take this right here you may say brother Paul you're walking way out on that limb but I want you to take this my brother and sister brother brand I'm talking about being a type and Shadow preacher there Comes a Day the shadow went away because we saw what he was pointing to that became real to us what he had to do is take this that was such a great nugget a great treasure but we couldn't understand it and he had to bring it back in an element where we could look at it and say you know what he's talking about is how my life is what he's talking about is my relationship with God he's talking about something that's down in my heart that I can't really figure out how to what to do with this and then all of a sudden the reality of the Shadow come to life and we went wow I believe that and I'm going to make a statement I I hope this isn't incorrect but did you know that the seven seal was revealed in you before your mind understood the concept of it and then people come along and say the seventh seal is closed you know what it's saying you know what the anointing is I don't have a revelation of my Redemption amen but to the bride of Christ she has that Revelation because she's been living The Plan of Redemption she's been living it it's not something she stored up here it's something that have come down in the heart and God says oh I'm not going to choose you because you're capable of the seventh seal exactly I'm going to choose you because your heart will receive it and manifest it oh Hallelujah yeah yes amen if a man eats that bread and came from Heaven he'll never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for partial salvation here is the whole of it oh my brother and sister I'm afraid I'm going to speak a little blunt tonight we got a lot of people around the message that got a partial Revelation a partial salvation of it I'm not looking for partial I'm looking for the fullness amen I'm looking for every bit of this word for this hour that God ordained for me Hallelujah and I'm going to tell you it's probably a lot more than I understand right now and just like Jesus isn't a part of God he is God hallelujah ain't that good now I need to hurry because I'm quickly running out of time but we're going to go right here and jump right into this this is okay tonight amen I know this is a little different but uh just these things went together and I just had to I had to do my best of time together he is a sovereign God we can say Amen by his own counsel he purposed The Plan of Salvation of his own elect which he fornew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully executes the will of the father I like that I love it when when you have a business plan that you come and it starts out and as you execute this and you do you see this has already provided for this this provides for this this provides for this this provides for this Hallelujah you can build a house without a foundation come on but you're not doing it right that's right you need a foundation amen you need a rim seal you need floor joist you need decking you need two fours or two sixes for the walls amen hallelujah have a beautiful house it's a big house open air housee I have no sighting I don't want to live in your house January I don't want to visit your house Hallelujah so we got to have everything in its proper place Hallelujah and you can do a most beautiful house I I had a friend uh a guy I'd call a friend one time made this mistake Saints and it was it was sad it was very costly and it was very sad and and he was doing a lot of the work himself and he got all excited got the house all sheeted all framed in put the windows on it uh put the siding on it had tar paper this back in the days when there wasn't all these nice synthetic Felts that that are tougher than tough and he had tar paper on the roof and then he got all focused and he got inside the house and wired it and insulated it and drywalled it and taped it and textured it and painted it and then he thought well we're this far did the kitchen did the bathrooms did the carpet and then a storm come that ripped all of the tar paper off of the roof and rained and rained and rained and rained and rained and all of that run right down through the cracks and destroyed all of his labor and the insurance said no we won't cover it because it was not an act of God it was basically a failure to do the correct things amen H by his own he purposed a plan which he forne son died upon the cross to establish the means God got it all in order he didn't come along and say okay now I got these people over here I got this whole group of people I I've never redeemed them no he established the Holy Spirit carefully executes the will of the father he's working all things at this moment according to to the purpose of his own will amen I don't care what kind of day you had I want you to read that again and again and again right here he is working all things amen all means just a couple right all means every single thing big and little now I want to quantify this if you fail to put the roof on it's not God's fault that's right Hallelujah that's right want you to think about it well God let this happen no putting the roof on was just as important as anything else he's right in the midst of it all you know Saints I'm sorry vent a little bit here had people tell me that if you believe that God's here that you believe peria and that you messed up but you know as I look through the message I don't know what their understanding of God being here is I honestly don't I I don't I can't see where they're coming from but the prophet says right here we believe he's a prophet right he is right in the midst of it all that's you know outside the church sorry I'm being a little factious in the midst of it all that means he's at your house not here he's in the midst of his church he amen they'd argue with you and say well that's the Holy Spirit right God come on come on he's in the midst of his church this great Creator saviorgod is Faithfully working amongst his own right now amen as a great Shepherd of the sheep his very existence is for his own that's why I made that statement earlier on that this Vision my brother and sister is the bride it's you not not anything else it's you amen because right here his very existence is for his own he loves them and cares for them His Eye Is ever upon them when the word says that your lives are HID with Christ in God it means exactly what it says I don't know about you this gets me excited when I read it it's no longer just a pagebook amen this is a beautiful broke down to my level understanding of what God is doing oh I am so glad that my God abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to the word he will back it up he is true to us he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last day I'm glad that I'm resting in his faithfulness amen not resting Upon Our s not resting upon our strength not resting upon what we're capable of oh Hallelujah imagine if it took a SAT score to make the Rapture I'd probably just find a big bridge and jump off of it they say well you know I I looked at some deals one time and somebody said you know this is the only question I missed on the SAT test and I I I they posted the question and they can't take papers you can't take notes so they just memorized the question and wrote it down afterwards hm me and my 30 second memory that's been reduced lately to about 19 seconds and I looked at it and I was like I don't even know what they're talking about I I I don't even have a clue some quantum physics logic reverse under this sorry but you know what God's SAT test for the rapture is only belief amen right it's not what you can explain that's right it's not how many people you can argue with and overcome them with your words it's not even how much scripture you can uh remember and quote how many message quotes you can quote right Hallelujah that's right Philippians 1:6 mean confidence of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he started it Hallelujah he'll finish it he is a true witness now this word true is the same word we saw back there in Revelations 3:7 remember that you will recall that it does not mean true as in contrast with false it has a richer deeper meaning by far expresses perfect realization amen H come on now back back in the Philadelphia age the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh what great love that age manifested for him it reminds me of those beautiful words of Peter 1 18 1 Peter 1 18 whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory oh hallelujah look at that that there there's the SAT test right there there's the SAT test Saints amen that we could take a haltz of that and say you know what God you said it I believe it and Lord you love me that's why you come I'm yours I'm already yours I'm already redeemed I may as well you know a brother one time preached made a statement over this pulpit and people just had a backfire over it and and when the brother said I'm already in the Rapture that's right whoa that's a false Doctrine oh no it isn't Saints oh hallelujah what is it Sons and Daughters of God they're a part of that great unfolding of the word and as the word is unfolding it comes to the day that it's no longer a partial realization but it becomes a complete or full realization a perfect realization and with that Revelation in our heart we know that as we live the word today and we stand on the word of God today we confess our love to our Lord Jesus Christ our bridegroom today that the Rapture is not something we look in fear of but we just know it's coming we just know as we believe and live this word that Rapture is a natural part of this word coming into a fullness or a completion Hallelujah we don't have to like oh I hope I hope I I no just have confidence in God this work I began in you is going to take you to a Rapture oh hallelujah oh I'll tell you what it ought to give a little bit of confidence in our life when we make mistakes just to say Lord I'm sorry but I'm pressing on Hallelujah perfect realization in contrast to partial realization amen oh Hallelujah I'm lost amen and whom you see not see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory with them we Rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him we know him now as much as our limited senses can let us but one day it will be face to face that is for this age his coming at the end of he is coming at the end of this age oh Hallelujah I I don't know if this gets you as excited as I did when I was reading it I was just like whoa thank you Lord amen just a little jolt of electricity that we realize you know what my goodness we're laboring we're struggling and the devil's pounding on us and we make mistakes and we're like Lord can I be yours and then you read something like this and realize hallelujah amen this word of God is breaking every shackle it breaks every chain we ought to be holding any chain we might possess tonight we ought to be holding it up and say Lord here's another one break it yes sir Hallelujah partial realization will be made perfect realization hallu look read those next words completed now something that's left to be done cannot be considered completed that's right right well we're working our way just hoping you know not by works but by faith we're hoping to make the rapture that's partial but when you can come to the place that you look at the word of God like the prophet of God said and you see yourself in the word you look at that and you say praise the Lord he was talking about me 2,000 years ago these words were written about me Hallelujah you talk about being important partial realization made perfect realization completed realization now that inspired a prophet enough he put a Hallelujah on the end of it hey I tell you what I say hallelujah also amen we have been looking through a glass Darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will be right in the glory and in his glory will'll shine whoa Hallelujah we'll shine we shall be like him wondrously like him Jesus our savior Divine isn't that wonderful yes amen we're partially made in him Hal Hallelujah we are complete in him everything I need to make the Rapture is already inside me Hallelujah I'm complete you say brother Paul you're still manifesting out you're still growing spiritually you're still that's right but it's in me that's right it's not coming from the church it's not coming from this guy and that guy over there whatever God is releasing it by faith in me amen we are complete in him that is true he would not lie to us about that but one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we shall be swallowed up you know what that means this isn't life this right here is not even life for a son or daughter of God this is not life that's right amen exactly yes sir this is a 2,000 year prototype testing ground yes it and one day they're going to come up with with that perfect prototype of realization realization and they're going to say Lord it sure looks like this bride down here on the earth is ready and he says I I see that are you guys ready we'll go call them home oh Hallelujah it will no longer be partial but it will be a bride of Christ going through her life every single day but you see the picture has been getting clearer it's no longer this fuzzy thing of who am I and what is happening what does God's word mean it's getting clear I need to hurry right along cuz I got to get to the good part hallelujah hallelujah amen amen the unveiling of God we're getting really close to the end I hope you don't mind okay we're we're just right there at time but we'll just now someone has been many has been saying to me and theologians said brother brandom if the Lord God said if W with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbly saying this said you would be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word if if God has man manifested I said that might be true see he was trying to catch me see I said but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications all the qualifications yeah I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away see and he said well then them seven Thunders you see with would them seven Thunders blasting out wouldn't that be a revelation be given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there and the seventh seals opened up the revelation of what that was and that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some come on partial realization come on another way to say it my brother and sister but partial realization God sent a prophet and Open the Eyes of others do you realize saints that this revealed word that we're looking at has always been revealed yeah it's not the word coming out from somewhere it's our eyes opening to it amen God didn't say okay now I got to get some more word and I got to get it delivered on time I might have to do an Amazon UPS Charter flight no sir it was here all the time and it come and our partial realization is changing amen and I'll say it like this once you've ever seen the revealed word of God you can't see it any other way so you can't go back and say well this is how I used to see it I think I'll go back to that position bride of Christ you can't do it when God opens your eyes you move forward there's no more partial realization it becomes reality to us and people are saying well how can you see that and you take a lot of Liberty with the word of God I'm sorry to tell you I don't know what to tell you I I can't give you a revelation I can't expose it over to you amen I I'm going to preach on this one of these days here whether it's explained or revealed come on Saints this bride of Christ it might have been preached to her but it was a revelation that came to her it was not an explanation Hallelujah it was Revelation amen see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's spirit will never leave that word oh the Holy Spirit told me no the spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some Open the Eyes of others it'll always do that amen oh ye are written Epistles read of all men or you are I translate that turn around this away see just turn it around ye are Epistles that has been written oh Hallelujah hey got to be something written on you for somebody to read it oh what is it when God uses you for for his signpost oh Hallelujah I want you to think about it it isn't God coming down walking on the streets in in the sense of God himself my brother and sister God said I've got a signpost I've got a sign I've got a sign I've got a sign I've got my Billboards now I wrote all over them and they're being read that's right H Allelujah that's better than a lot of these Billboards that get put up that got a bunch of garbage on them people just drive by h but we're walking every day I'll tell you what somebody's reading you every day amen what's our letter amen because you can't add nothing to it that's read of all men manifested word of God did you catch it amen he's not talking about somebody else he's talking about you manifesting word of God Jesus you you come on are you with me you manifested word of God not just a bunch of people believe in a message going to church manifested word of God in other words Peter and John to show it when they went up there they perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned they had no education but they taken notice that they had been with Jesus see they were ignorant and unlearned but they were written Epistles yes see read that they had been with Jesus cuz Jesus was manifesting himself through them right Christ now right here is the best part I read all of that tonight to get to this point right here some will be saying good he's at the end but we saved the best for last oh Hallelujah Jesus was manifesting himself through them Christ veiled in their flesh manifested Made Alive like he was in Moses when the word was in Moses he was God in flesh when it was in Jesus it was God in flesh see the only thing he done was change his m not his word not his nature he is the same yesterday today and forever he only changed his form he changed from Noah to Moses he changed from Moses to David from David Joseph on down till he come into the fullness of the godhead bodily see oh oh hallelujah we're almost there Saints he's still the same God he's still in the veiling business amen amen I hope that gets through see it is the same God but he just takes on another Veil see he put on another Veil I want to slow down now he put on another Veil he did it in the reformers taking on a veil taking on a veil until finally it came down through the Lutheran Age come down through the other age then finally comes down into the complete what were we looking at earlier amen that perfect realization amen was complete amen right amen just before it come a prophet rises again what it does it foreshadows the word showing back there revealing what's been done what's been left off that the church will be without not without understanding then when this Fades out like John said I must de increase he must increase then all and all comes into him he is fully manifested through Luther Wesley Pentecostal age on down on down he is fully manifested you see come down just the manifestation God unfolding see him now notice fulfilled in his promise for this day as they had now Moses was the word to that day because the word was given to him for that day Moses Joseph was the word for his days betraying Christ exactly see each one of them was the word hallelujah and when Jesus came he was the word in its fullness amen do you know when he comes and undoes that zipper that's it and he grabs you and he steps inside right he doesn't zip that up and say now a few years from now I'll come and give you something more no sir he was a fullness that's when he unzipped your life and stepped into it you had everything you needed for the Rapture right right there oh hallelujah amen oh amen because the whole Plan of Redemption laid in him the whole Plan of Redemption didn't lay in Moses didn't lay in Joseph didn't lay in Elijah see they were only part of the word pointing to it see now notice keep your thought here it comes as I say see the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it therefore after him the fullness we cannot point to something else it points back to him the word brother Brown picks up his Bible Hallelujah I I'm just going to go right there amen the word that's it the word my brother and sister people are like what is our absolute what is our absolute it's something raging across the land people are like well is the word or is it the message well if you say the message of Jesus Christ I'll agree it's the message amen but my Prophet said right here amen right come on Saints we're not bitter right we don't have an axe to grind but I sure enough don't want somebody giving me false information that's right I don't want somebody telling me now the the the key to your code to the Vault of eternal life is this number right here and you're there punching it and it says wrong number no no I I don't want that I want the right number this is the complete Revelation nothing can be added and taken away from it see how he ties this all back together there is a complete Revelation all that a shadow of him to come but when he come he was the perfect Hebrews 1 God in Sundre times spoke to the father through the prophets God spoke through veils the prophets but in this last days through his son Jesus Christ there you are amen unveiled out there on Calvary the Son of God unveiled notice Made Alive amen and today when the word is manifested in human vessels amen veils it's absolutely the word fulfilled in that day which comes back to God where's this manifested at Hallelujah I am God manifested you are God manifested I tell you that ought to make a heart stir it ought to make say hallelujah I am weird to the world I might be a nut to the world but I am God manifested in a human vessel it veils it's absolutely the word fulfilled that's right oh come on I might be stepping out on a limb tonight but I want you to step out here with me if you would when this time comes that God is manifested in the human vessel my brother and sister that is the word fulfill we're not looking for some more word to be fulfilled people are saying we're looking for brother Brown's prophecy here and this over here and we're looking for this over here and we're looking for this I'll tell you what I'm looking for I'm looking for the word to be manifested in me Hallelujah Can someone say it's happened Hallelujah not someday in the future it's happened Saints God has come down in his people and he has come and veiled himself in you not veiled himself from you but in you Hallelujah they're looking and seeing

baptized into him identified in him I want you to read the reason I ask you to read this is because this chapter my brother and sister is powerful it is not just baptism into one body but it is showing us so clearly this plan of God well Hallelujah we might even be able to say this is a seventh seal hidden in Corinthians amen not even in the Book of Revelation it's hidden in Corinthians and Paul was preaching it oh hallelujah oh praise the Lord before I jump off the yeah anyway my my my oh Hallelujah you know it just shows us so clearly gives us gifts gives us office gives us identity oh thank you Lord yeah you know look at this I just have to go jump down in there verse 14 I I'm not even going to bring it up on the screen cuz I really don't want to but he says for the body is not one member but many and if the foot shall say I'm more spiritual than everyone else if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an i where were the hearing if the whole were the hearing where were the smelling but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him oh Hallelujah that ought to make us exciting tonight we are right where God wants us to be you say well brother Paul I'm not real satisfied with my life well work on your prayer life amen work on those things kick all the distraction I'm preaching to Paul right now Hallelujah you ever get dissatisfied my life wo is my life well that's not what this says he says he placed us right where he wants us amen and you know what that also means he placed himself right where he wants himself to be oh Hallelujah he said I want to be in you I want to be in you I want to I don't care how you want to word it I want to be in your car I want to unzip you and step inside I don't care how you word it amen he's right where he
