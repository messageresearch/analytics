[34:37] heavenly father lord jesus
[34:40] i pray you just

[34:48] have come in in the world within the
[34:49] lord
[34:50] father forgive us lord jesus
[34:53] father we quiet our spirits now tonight
[34:55] as we would prepare to hear from you
[34:57] lord jesus that you would allow me to
[34:59] step aside lord and i just give you full
[35:02] control tonight you you you take the
[35:04] service lord that's why we came to hear
[35:07] you
[35:07] it wouldn't come if it was just a man
[35:09] speaking
[35:11] father so i just pray that you would
[35:12] bless your word tonight lord
[35:15] may something be said to encourage the
[35:17] hearts of your people lord
[35:19] lift us up we ask father god
[35:22] may our lives become more in tune with
[35:23] you father
[35:25] our hearts desire line up with the will
[35:27] of your word lord
[35:29] father and we just want to commit our
[35:30] pastor and his family to your hands as
[35:32] well lord is still
[35:35] coming to the end of the harvest but
[35:36] very busy work and along with the
[35:38] passing of sister jerry lord i just
[35:40] prayed and encouraged them lift him up
[35:42] give our pastor strength father
[35:44] lord we just love you so much
[35:47] we're so thankful that we get to be
[35:48] called father children of the king
[35:51] committed ourselves to your hands now in
[35:53] jesus name we pray amen you may be
[35:55] seated tonight
[36:06] amen
[36:08] i'd like to read a story here
[36:11] this evening before we get started i
[36:13] don't have a slide for it so you can
[36:14] just
[36:15] leave it where it is
[36:18] but my title tonight
[36:21] is that different sound
[36:24] and sounding for christ
[36:27] so we sing a song and most of you
[36:29] probably know this story but
[36:31] um
[36:33] i'm not going to give it away i'm just
[36:34] going to read the story
[36:36] so horatio spafford
[36:39] knew something about life's unexpected
[36:41] challenges
[36:42] he was a successful attorney and real
[36:44] estate investor who lost a fortune in
[36:47] the great chicago fire of 1871
[36:51] around the same time his beloved
[36:53] four-year-old son
[36:54] died of scarlet fever
[36:56] thinking thinking a vacation would do
[36:58] his family some good he sent his wife
[37:00] and four daughters on a ship to england
[37:03] planning to join them after he finished
[37:05] some pressing business at home
[37:08] however while crossing the atlantic
[37:09] ocean the ship was involved in a
[37:12] terrible collision and sunk
[37:14] more than 200 people lost their lives
[37:16] including all four of horatio's
[37:18] bafford's
[37:19] daughters
[37:21] his wife anna survived the tragedy upon
[37:24] arriving in england she sent a telegram
[37:26] to her husband that began saved alone
[37:28] what shall i do
[37:30] horatio immediately set sail for england
[37:32] at one point during his voyage the
[37:35] captain of the ship aware of the tragedy
[37:37] that had struck the spafford family
[37:39] summoned horatio to tell him that they
[37:41] were now passing over the spot where the
[37:43] shipwreck had occurred
[37:45] as horatio thought about his daughter's
[37:47] words of comfort and hope filled his
[37:49] heart and mind
[37:50] he wrote them down and they have since
[37:52] become
[37:53] a well-beloved hymn
[37:55] when peace like a river
[38:01] attendeth my way
[38:05] when
[38:07] sorrows like sea
[38:10] bellows rule
[38:15] whatever my lot
[38:18] thou has
[38:20] taught me
[38:22] to say
[38:24] it is well
[38:27] it is well
[38:30] with my soul
[38:33] can we see that course together oh it is
[38:37] well
[38:38] [Music]
[38:41] with my soul
[38:47] oh it is well
[38:51] it is well
[38:54] with
[38:56] my
[38:57] soul
[39:00] hey man we enjoy that hymn
[39:02] it's always
[39:05] no matter how
[39:07] old it gets
[39:10] it still holds such power behind it
[39:12] and that's because
[39:14] horatio spatford
[39:16] in a time of difficulty
[39:18] in the time of tragedy in his life
[39:23] something
[39:24] moved in his heart
[39:26] and sometimes
[39:28] uh people and now this is totally a
[39:30] different direction than i thought it
[39:31] would go we're just relying on the lord
[39:33] but sometimes what happens is people
[39:35] question why
[39:38] someone can stand the faith
[39:40] in the face of a tragedy like horatio
[39:42] spafford went through but you see what
[39:44] happened was the pressure was put on
[39:47] him
[39:48] and when the pressure was applied to
[39:50] horatio it just pushed out
[39:54] music it pushed out a sound that was
[39:58] who he is
[40:00] who he was
[40:01] and that sound
[40:03] sounded for christ
[40:06] you see in the time of tragedy when
[40:07] people begin to fall from god it's
[40:09] because god never was inside of them
[40:13] when tragedy strikes or when things get
[40:15] hard or the road gets difficult and
[40:16] they're squeezed
[40:18] the sound of christ doesn't come out
[40:20] something else does a noise
[40:23] and so if you have christ when things
[40:26] happen in your life
[40:29] when you get squeezed
[40:31] out comes from you the sound of christ
[40:35] amen so we are singing the song one day
[40:38] um i keep listening for a different
[40:39] sound
[40:40] and um
[40:42] i begin to think about
[40:44] that
[40:45] and just stir within what what what's
[40:47] what is it the sound of the city that
[40:50] jumps
[40:52] the sound of the city the sound of the
[40:54] bride
[40:55] being united with the groom right
[40:58] but that different sound and that
[41:00] different sound is what our life
[41:03] produces
[41:04] under the anointing of christ that
[41:06] sound is what the relationship of the
[41:09] bride with the groom brings out is that
[41:12] sound of christ
[41:14] amen so
[41:17] sound is vibrations that travel through
[41:20] the arrow or another medium and can be
[41:22] heard when they wrench a person's
[41:24] or animal's ear
[41:26] or a thing that can be heard
[41:29] now there's a scripture in the bible
[41:30] that says blessed are those that hear
[41:34] or excuse me i might have misquoted that
[41:35] but my sheep hear my voice right
[41:38] to hear in the bible is to have a
[41:40] revelation yes so i didn't come up with
[41:43] this just out of the blue
[41:44] the word of god has a sound
[41:47] and that sound is
[41:49] the truth of christ that sound is christ
[41:51] or revelation
[41:54] god is in his nature you believe that
[41:57] because he created it
[41:59] it's a it's a it's a description of god
[42:01] just like your life is a description or
[42:04] an example of god
[42:06] your life lived for him
[42:08] the very creation of a baby in the womb
[42:10] is testifies to god and so sound is a
[42:13] part of what god created
[42:16] and so he
[42:17] he speaks and he says you know you hear
[42:19] my voice and not that it's some special
[42:22] uh tone or some special anything like
[42:24] that or vibration but it's a revelation
[42:27] that resonates within you so a steep
[42:30] calleth to the deep
[42:31] and um
[42:33] praise the lord so we're just using the
[42:34] sound as of this example and but sound
[42:38] noise is not the same thing
[42:40] noise is a sound but
[42:43] it's a little bit different when you
[42:44] when you hear a great a crash or a car
[42:47] wreck you man what was that noise
[42:50] right when you hear music or you hear
[42:51] something sweet you know you don't think
[42:53] of it as noise it's just a natural
[42:55] tendency we don't call it noise because
[42:57] the definition is a loud unpleasant
[43:00] disturbing sound
[43:05] sounding is giving forth sound
[43:07] especially loud or resonant sound
[43:11] amen so
[43:13] um the sound of christ is the sound of
[43:17] freedom it's music
[43:19] the great orchestra brother talks about
[43:21] it
[43:22] the great sound you know the clashing of
[43:24] the symbols at the right time if you
[43:25] clash the symbols together at the wrong
[43:27] time it's just noise there's no music
[43:29] nobody's going to call it music they're
[43:30] going to want their money back
[43:36] but the sound the music
[43:38] amen it's a beautiful sound we don't say
[43:40] beautiful noise
[43:42] we say a beautiful sound you hear the
[43:44] sound of the birds
[43:46] right
[43:49] john 8 32 says and ye shall know the
[43:51] truth and the truth shall make you free
[43:54] the sounding of christ my sheep hear my
[43:57] voice and i know them and they follow me
[44:00] amen that is the sounding of christ but
[44:03] the world's call is noise
[44:06] and lots of it and you see if you take
[44:09] if you take a
[44:12] if you take a speaker and you put it
[44:14] here and you play
[44:15] just
[44:16] pure god anointed music
[44:18] and then you you turn up you said a
[44:20] speaker over here and you play something
[44:22] not
[44:23] got anointed and you blast that that
[44:26] noise will overcome this if it doesn't
[44:29] get turned up but it talks about the
[44:31] black dog and the white dog inside of
[44:33] you whether you feed the black dog or
[44:35] you feed the white dog depends on the
[44:36] victory you're getting or the victory
[44:38] you're not getting well when your life
[44:40] is sounding for christ you're having
[44:43] victory over the noise of the world but
[44:46] when the noise of the world has
[44:47] increased in your life and you're not
[44:49] putting emphasis on christ amen that
[44:52] sound begins to diminish and then you're
[44:54] pushing forth an atmosphere that's
[44:57] created from the noise of the world but
[45:00] when you're focusing on christ you mean
[45:02] you're pushing forth the sound or the
[45:04] music of the gospel of jesus christ and
[45:06] it's creating that atmosphere that goes
[45:09] with that how many of those music
[45:11] creates atmospheres amen they've the
[45:13] science has proven it with with plants
[45:15] growing into the speakers of classical
[45:18] and pure music and shriveling up and
[45:20] dying from the speakers of rock and roll
[45:23] so it's a sound amen everything has a
[45:25] sound
[45:27] that brings brings forth a sound and now
[45:29] first kings 19 verse 11 to 13.
[45:33] um
[45:35] we we pick up here the story of elijah
[45:38] and now um we're moving in from from um
[45:41] as christians our daily walk and as as a
[45:44] message believers especially
[45:47] well those are the same thing
[45:49] um the scripture says and he said go
[45:51] forth and stand upon the mount before
[45:53] the lord and behold the lord pass by
[45:55] and a great and strong wind rent the
[45:58] mountains and break in pieces the rocks
[46:00] before the lord but the lord was not in
[46:03] the wind
[46:05] and now after the wind and earthquake
[46:08] but the lord was not in the earthquake
[46:12] oh you should have been there
[46:15] the power of god swept down
[46:19] or you should have been there it was
[46:21] like things where everything was shaking
[46:23] whoops
[46:25] sorry
[46:26] um
[46:29] anyways
[46:33] should have been there the rocks were
[46:35] falling from the mountains there were
[46:36] earthquakes and and the wind and it was
[46:39] it was it was crazy it was mighty but
[46:42] god wasn't in those things
[46:45] god is in
[46:47] see
[46:49] a connection you always bring a balance
[46:50] a connection with god in his presence
[46:53] will bring
[46:54] some kind of outward display of emotion
[46:57] not every single time but it's still of
[47:00] god by the dance across the pews
[47:01] remember
[47:03] but sometimes people can just associate
[47:06] the wind the earthquake the fire and
[47:08] just by the attributes of the fire and
[47:10] the wind of the earthquake they can say
[47:12] that's god
[47:14] but the bible says the lord was not in
[47:16] the wind in this instance he was not in
[47:18] the earthquake he was not and after the
[47:20] earthquake of fire but the lord was not
[47:22] in the fire and after the fire a still
[47:24] small voice
[47:25] you see you're never going to confuse
[47:27] the voice of christ with anything else
[47:31] but you can't confuse the fire with
[47:33] something else you can't confuse the
[47:35] wind with something else you can't
[47:37] confuse the earthquake with something
[47:39] else you can have a
[47:40] a falling of the spirit and a great
[47:43] moving
[47:44] on your flesh and walk away unchanged
[47:48] but you hear the voice of god one time
[47:51] you will never be the same
[47:53] you will never be the same
[47:55] amen that's all you have to make sure is
[47:57] though is god in the wind ask yourself
[47:59] is god in the wind lord king revelation
[48:02] are you in the wind tonight are you in
[48:04] the wind this morning are you in the
[48:05] wind right now are you in the earthquake
[48:07] are you in the fire god because god was
[48:09] in the fire for the children of israel
[48:11] oh the three hebrew children shadrach
[48:13] meshach and abednego he was in the fire
[48:16] and he walked
[48:17] there had to be shouting right you're
[48:19] standing in flame and fire not being
[48:21] burned i think you would probably shout
[48:26] don't even sit there think you wouldn't
[48:31] you would
[48:37] you dance enough if you get burned
[48:40] um praise the lord praise the lord so
[48:44] what is the key what's the key here
[48:46] elijah listening for the sound of christ
[48:51] the lord was just trying to distract him
[48:52] he was testing him is he focused is he
[48:55] waiting on me
[48:58] brings the wind
[49:00] brings the earthquake brings the fire
[49:02] the lord was not in the fire after the
[49:04] fire a still small voice and it was so
[49:07] when elijah heard it that he wrapped his
[49:09] face in his mantle
[49:11] in other words he wrapped himself in
[49:12] humility
[49:14] and the the his the clothes of humanity
[49:18] and went out and stood in the entering
[49:19] into the cave and behold there came a
[49:21] voice unto him and said what doest thou
[49:23] hear
[49:24] elijah
[49:26] so god wasn't in the wind
[49:28] the earthquake
[49:30] the fire they were all just noises
[49:34] to the uncalled it would appear mighty
[49:37] and spiritual they say god you can go
[49:40] watch you know the pentecostals and some
[49:42] of them some well it's getting worse now
[49:45] but some of their music is is good you
[49:47] go watch them and and they're worshiping
[49:50] god right
[49:52] it's fire and earthquake and wind but
[49:54] god's not there but the bible says the
[49:57] angel of the lord said call them lodges
[49:59] there is no christ there but to the
[50:01] uncalled it's mighty and spiritual and
[50:03] it draws them to that because they're
[50:06] saying it has to be god because it's
[50:08] fire
[50:09] not because it's the word
[50:12] and that's the separation the sounding
[50:14] of god can use fire
[50:17] the sounding of christ can use an
[50:19] earthquake the sounding of christ can
[50:22] use the wind
[50:24] but it's going to line up with the word
[50:28] the sounding of christ your life will
[50:31] sound for christ you might run the
[50:33] aisles
[50:34] and be
[50:35] just as lost as the bomb on the street
[50:38] that's message
[50:40] that's in the message the spirit you've
[50:42] had you get baptized with the holy ghost
[50:43] on their flesh every day of your life
[50:45] and still go to hell this is a sounding
[50:48] so what happens god tests everybody the
[50:51] seed is gonna test it the person is
[50:52] gonna be tested because we're all human
[50:54] and we're going to go through tests and
[50:56] so when you go through that test the
[50:57] fire the earthquake and the wind is not
[51:00] going to save you
[51:01] in those tragic times or in those
[51:03] difficult times like horatio but it's
[51:05] the deep calling it's the deep within
[51:08] the sea down inside of you that's that
[51:10] will come forth and will sound for
[51:12] christ and will make the the bring forth
[51:15] the life of christ in those moments
[51:18] elijah did not get caught up in his
[51:20] feelings instead he listened for a sound
[51:24] that's the tricky thing saints of god
[51:26] the wind the earthquake and the and the
[51:28] fire they touch our emotions they touch
[51:30] our feelings
[51:32] but it's god in it i'm not saying
[51:34] they're wrong i'm asking you is god in
[51:36] it in that moment
[51:38] you have to use the sermon the bible
[51:39] says
[51:40] discern the um well the spirit of the
[51:42] lord will discern the very thoughts
[51:43] intents of the heart but he will give
[51:45] you the ability amen with the word of
[51:48] god to judge what is right and wrong
[51:50] with the holy spirit
[51:52] but don't become critical of someone
[51:54] who's displaying emotion
[51:56] and say oh it's emotion it can't be god
[52:00] see there's you can go the other
[52:02] direction you can sit on your pew phone
[52:04] stone face for 50 years
[52:06] and
[52:07] miss every move of god it can go both
[52:09] ways
[52:10] so the balance is what it always comes
[52:12] back to the word of god
[52:13] is it sounding christ okay
[52:17] so when when elijah was listening
[52:20] he was listening for the voice of god he
[52:22] was listening for the sound of christ
[52:25] and when he heard it he stepped forth
[52:29] you notice in that scripture
[52:31] that he stepped out then the lord
[52:35] asked him
[52:36] the question
[52:38] see guys are going to sit in vegas
[52:42] he wants us to stand like mature sons
[52:44] and daughters of god amen and step out
[52:47] in faith
[52:48] and faith takes a foundation upon the
[52:51] word of god
[52:53] and if you have a foundation on faith
[52:56] which is a spiritual revelation of
[52:58] christ
[52:59] your life is going to sound christ and
[53:02] if your life sounding for christ guess
[53:03] what you know what the sound of christ
[53:05] sounds like
[53:07] you can identify because my sheep hear
[53:09] my voice
[53:11] amen once you hear the voice of christ
[53:13] sound in your life you can step forth in
[53:15] faith
[53:16] but saying to god
[53:18] this is something that is kind of a go
[53:21] that's
[53:22] on my heart here in in in in in these
[53:25] notes and just in general
[53:27] is that we get in such a hurry
[53:31] man we
[53:32] the spirit of the age is hurry
[53:35] we
[53:36] ice we lived in phoenix right
[53:38] if you lived in phoenix at all
[53:41] you know bell road is the worst traffic
[53:44] in the world
[53:45] i don't care where you're from
[53:48] we moved here and it's like man there
[53:49] you guys are complaining about traffic
[53:50] and me and chris's life
[53:53] we've been here for only a year and a
[53:54] half and we're like this traffic is
[53:57] horrible
[53:59] it used to take me 10 minutes now it
[54:00] takes me 18.
[54:03] instead of an hour it's taking me an
[54:05] hour to go two miles down bell road
[54:08] right just it's it so it's everyone's in
[54:10] a hurry that's all i'm trying to say
[54:12] everyone's in a hurry they want it fast
[54:14] i work i you guys know what i do
[54:16] software engineering and websites and
[54:18] everything and i don't i don't do so
[54:20] much this part of things but i do know
[54:22] you you have you the attention span you
[54:25] have on a web page is like 0.7 seconds
[54:28] if you don't catch their attention in
[54:29] 0.7 seconds
[54:31] forget it they're gonna move on they're
[54:33] gonna go they're gonna click back and
[54:34] look at the next google search
[54:38] 0.7 seconds
[54:42] i was
[54:44] young enough
[54:46] and or i'm old enough i guess you could
[54:47] say that but and my parents were
[54:50] backwards enough that i had dial up as a
[54:52] kid
[54:55] mom get off the phone
[54:57] i need i'm trying to get on right i want
[54:59] to yahoo messenger somebody or something
[55:04] dial up you sat there and you waited
[55:06] five ten minutes
[55:08] right
[55:09] and that was that's just what you did
[55:12] now it's if it's not instant you're
[55:14] calling your network provider saying
[55:16] what's your problem my page didn't load
[55:19] in 30 seconds
[55:20] in a hurry in a hurry
[55:22] you can't approach god through the
[55:25] technique of the world
[55:28] you can't approach god in the style of
[55:30] the world
[55:32] you see that in domination in
[55:33] denominational lodges you see that man
[55:36] they got the skinny jeans and the
[55:37] mohawks and
[55:40] they just got the world over and they're
[55:42] trying to approach the gospel
[55:44] in the style of the world
[55:46] to
[55:47] appeal to the world
[55:51] and you can't do that so if in serving
[55:54] god you can't
[55:56] approach god
[55:58] in a hurry
[56:02] sometimes he is not going to give you
[56:04] the answer to your question because
[56:06] you're not ready for it
[56:08] you think you are you think you're ready
[56:10] for the answer but god says no you're
[56:12] not ready for the answer just yet corey
[56:14] ten boom was on the on a train traveling
[56:16] to amsterdam i believe with her father
[56:19] she was a young girl and she asked kind
[56:21] of an adult question
[56:23] just curious as a kid and
[56:24] and uh her dad didn't say anything they
[56:26] got to the train station he stood up he
[56:29] pulled his suitcase off the rack and he
[56:30] handed it to her and said corey can you
[56:32] carry this out for me
[56:34] sure she couldn't even pick it up
[56:36] so he grabbed it he said cory
[56:39] your question you asked me
[56:41] when you're strong enough
[56:43] god will give you the answer to carry
[56:45] that burden
[56:47] to carry that knowledge
[56:49] when you're big enough when you're
[56:50] strong enough then you'll know
[56:53] sometimes god knows you're not bigger
[56:55] big enough and strong enough in your
[56:57] faith to accept the answer
[57:00] because while you're asking why you're
[57:03] seeking him
[57:07] and
[57:08] he might bring up something in in your
[57:10] life for you to ask why
[57:13] because you've been sounding you've been
[57:15] bringing forth noise
[57:17] and he put something in your path that
[57:19] kind of stops you kind of shakes you up
[57:21] and so you start seeking you start
[57:23] praying and what you're doing is in your
[57:25] mind you're looking for an answer but
[57:26] what's happening is you're drawing
[57:28] nearer to god so god
[57:31] not not exactly but leads you along
[57:34] to bring you into a place nearer to him
[57:37] and then he'll he gives you that answer
[57:39] sometimes we're not always ready for the
[57:41] answer and god will bring things to draw
[57:43] us closer to him and then just like the
[57:46] roots of the tree something somebody
[57:48] asks you a hard question that you can't
[57:50] answer
[57:51] it shakes your roots and you go and you
[57:53] look in the word and you draw nearer to
[57:55] god and god gives you the revelation
[57:57] that you need to dig your roots down
[57:59] deeper so you don't always get the
[58:00] answer
[58:01] right away he wants you to step forth in
[58:04] faith
[58:05] so don't get a don't get in a hurry
[58:09] take time to find your footing
[58:11] on faith in christ
[58:14] and then don't step forth at the first
[58:15] sign you see be still and wait upon the
[58:18] lord i was talking to someone the other
[58:19] day and we were discussing a situation
[58:21] and they were mentioning some advice
[58:23] that they got
[58:25] and um i said you know
[58:27] that advice
[58:30] is what was good
[58:31] excuse me good advice but
[58:34] is that what the lord
[58:36] is is that the direction the lord is
[58:38] leading you you're talking about
[58:40] you know waiting
[58:42] you know
[58:43] well if it's god's will i'll wait and
[58:45] this thing will happen
[58:47] i said gideon was in the will of god
[58:49] when he set the fleece out
[58:52] for god to put dew on and no do on the
[58:54] grass or dry and do on the grass he was
[58:56] in the will of god
[58:58] god was leading him to do that to to to
[59:01] make sure that that's what gideon needed
[59:04] if god's not leading you to sit and wait
[59:07] for this over here
[59:10] you need to find the will of god
[59:12] i don't know how i got there because i
[59:14] was talking about being waiting and
[59:15] being patient
[59:19] the first sign that's what i was trying
[59:20] to say
[59:22] not always is the sign that that that
[59:24] that sign that you know how am i trying
[59:27] lord give me grace
[59:31] i've heard it said in times past
[59:34] um
[59:36] oh if god wants me to i'm going to use
[59:39] this example it's it's it's very uh
[59:42] not very um
[59:44] i'm just going to use this example if
[59:45] god wants me to have a job he'll give me
[59:47] one
[59:48] and i'm gonna sit over here
[59:50] and do nothing
[59:52] if god wants me to have a job he'll give
[59:54] me a job
[59:55] well it's god's will that you have a job
[59:58] because you're called to be a provider
[1:00:01] so if you're sitting there not doing
[1:00:03] anything about it you're out of the will
[1:00:05] of god because that's not what the bible
[1:00:06] says you should be out looking for a job
[1:00:10] but people can use that oh if god wants
[1:00:12] it to me he'll give it to me as a crutch
[1:00:15] and they never step forth in faith now
[1:00:18] once you once you catch the revelation
[1:00:20] of stepping forth in faith
[1:00:22] you become a doer you become an
[1:00:24] actionable christian but
[1:00:27] ins in doing so now you have to find the
[1:00:29] balance and not get in a hurry to go out
[1:00:31] and take it
[1:00:33] let god still bring it to you what was
[1:00:35] abraham was given circumcision as a
[1:00:37] testament to his faith
[1:00:40] amen god saw abraham's faith
[1:00:42] and gave him the sign of that faith so
[1:00:45] god will will ask you to step out of
[1:00:47] faith like elijah did
[1:00:50] ecclesiastes 3
[1:00:52] 1
[1:00:53] to everything there is the season and
[1:00:54] the time to every purpose under the
[1:00:57] heaven
[1:00:58] there's a time for these things there's
[1:01:00] a season that god works in seasons
[1:01:04] and then it's not just a season where
[1:01:05] you need to sit and patiently wait
[1:01:09] long as you're in the will of god
[1:01:12] but they wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:01:13] their strength they shall mount up with
[1:01:15] wings as eagles they shall run and not
[1:01:17] be weary they shall walk and not faint
[1:01:23] amen when you hear that still small
[1:01:25] voice step forth
[1:01:27] no in a hurry
[1:01:29] god has a provided way
[1:01:31] it's a bit of a story kind of a long
[1:01:33] quote but bear with me here now our
[1:01:35] heavenly father standing here in this
[1:01:37] little old crude built tabernacle yet
[1:01:39] knowing that the shekinah glory of god
[1:01:40] who dwelt under the interlocked wings of
[1:01:42] the cherubs is standing present now
[1:01:47] and as our souls can let loose
[1:01:49] of the filthy things
[1:01:52] of the world that moves into his
[1:01:54] presence and we can feel
[1:01:56] and know that he is standing here we
[1:01:58] come boldly
[1:01:59] knowing that we would knowing this that
[1:02:01] we would die if it wasn't for christ's
[1:02:03] glory but his shed blood makes a way we
[1:02:06] could come then boldly up to your throne
[1:02:08] under the interlock wings of the cross
[1:02:10] god this man here fine looking big style
[1:02:12] looking man standing here wanting to
[1:02:14] preach the gospel what a glorious thing
[1:02:16] and yet satan has given him a stammering
[1:02:18] stuttering voice
[1:02:20] but he wants it to move today so that he
[1:02:22] can preach the gospel o eternal god we
[1:02:25] know that thou has used in times past
[1:02:28] stammers and stutters but this man wants
[1:02:30] to be free for he feels embarrassed
[1:02:32] about it with it so today by the merits
[1:02:35] of the lord jesus by god's provided
[1:02:37] program and way by the witness of the
[1:02:39] holy ghost and the presence of god and

[1:02:53] able to preach the gospel with the true
[1:02:55] ringing sounding voice for god's glory
[1:02:58] lord i lay these my hands upon him

[1:03:58] rejoicing
[1:04:00] now let's raise our heads and give god
[1:04:02] praise say thank you lord jesus there
[1:04:04] goes a man into the ministry to preach
[1:04:05] the gospel that once
[1:04:07] was once a stutterer
[1:04:10] you see god had given him a calling but
[1:04:12] there was something
[1:04:13] hindering him from fulfilling what god
[1:04:16] had called him to do god had called him
[1:04:19] to stand and preach the gospel to sound
[1:04:21] for christ now everybody has a different
[1:04:24] gift in the body of christ that god has
[1:04:26] called you to sound for him but if
[1:04:28] there's something in the way see the
[1:04:30] devil is going to come right away as
[1:04:32] soon as you catch revelation of what god
[1:04:34] wants you to do as soon as you catch the
[1:04:36] understanding all of your gift or what
[1:04:38] god has placed you to do he's gonna the
[1:04:40] devil's gonna come
[1:04:41] raging in and put a a roadblock in your
[1:04:45] way
[1:04:46] and you're gonna have to find god you're
[1:04:48] gonna have to wait upon god for him to
[1:04:50] renew your strength so that you can step
[1:04:53] forth into your ministry whether that's
[1:04:56] preaching or housewife or sit here in
[1:04:58] the church and help in the sound booth
[1:05:00] or the music
[1:05:02] whatever it is step forth in your
[1:05:04] ministry and begin to sound for christ
[1:05:06] you see it's god's will that whatever it
[1:05:08] is that is hindering you right now that
[1:05:11] it would be moved out of the way for you
[1:05:13] to step forth and sound for christ
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:17] praise the lord nothing can stand in the
[1:05:20] way
[1:05:21] amen second kings chapter 5 verse 1 to
[1:05:23] 4.
[1:05:25] now naaman captain of the host of the
[1:05:28] king of syria was a great man with his
[1:05:30] master i know we just read about this
[1:05:32] but
[1:05:32] his master and honorable because by him
[1:05:35] the lord had given deliverance because
[1:05:37] excuse me unto syria he was also a
[1:05:40] mighty man in valor but he was a leper
[1:05:42] and the syrians had gone out by
[1:05:44] companies and had brought away captive
[1:05:46] out of the land of israel a little maid
[1:05:47] and she waited on naaman's wife and she
[1:05:50] said unto her mistress would god my lord
[1:05:52] were with the prophet that is in samaria
[1:05:55] for he would recover him of his leprosy
[1:05:59] and one went in and told his lord saying
[1:06:01] thus and thus
[1:06:03] said the maid that is of the land of
[1:06:05] israel
[1:06:08] so we know the end of the story damon
[1:06:10] goes to israel and he's healed of his
[1:06:12] leprosy but you see that little maid she
[1:06:15] had a calling
[1:06:16] just like the man we read in the quote
[1:06:18] she had a calling but
[1:06:21] she god had to bring her into position
[1:06:25] for her to fulfill that calling to sound
[1:06:29] for christ when she said those words
[1:06:32] she was testifying of christ she was
[1:06:35] sounding for christ it's a different
[1:06:37] sound right so different
[1:06:40] syria didn't have prophets of the lord
[1:06:42] it's a different sound it's odd to the
[1:06:45] world because
[1:06:46] it's christ
[1:06:48] it's the direct opposite the satan's
[1:06:51] eating this the noise
[1:06:53] is very different
[1:06:55] but you see she had a calling she was
[1:06:58] born for this day
[1:07:02] this little girl was born for this day
[1:07:05] and
[1:07:07] what kind of and i mentioned i think i
[1:07:09] mentioned this on sunday what kind of
[1:07:10] heartache did she have to experience
[1:07:12] what kind of backside of the desert
[1:07:14] experience did she have to go through to
[1:07:17] get into position
[1:07:20] you see god did this in my own life
[1:07:23] brought me from one place to another to
[1:07:25] sit and and to go through things and to
[1:07:27] learn and to and and to and for god to
[1:07:30] express and and me having a desire that
[1:07:33] god would use me but god's saying it's
[1:07:35] not time yet you need
[1:07:37] training to get into position
[1:07:40] she she needed to be physically moved
[1:07:43] from israel
[1:07:44] to syria
[1:07:46] he said oh wow you know i feel a calling
[1:07:50] to syria no
[1:07:52] she was taken from her home taken from
[1:07:55] her family taking from everything
[1:07:57] familiar to her you see god sometimes
[1:08:00] will
[1:08:01] rip us up and put us somewhere else
[1:08:05] so that we can sound for christ that can
[1:08:07] be a physical location different state
[1:08:10] move across the world my wife and i were
[1:08:12] discussing this earlier today
[1:08:14] you know
[1:08:15] it's funny sometimes uh even messi
[1:08:18] sometimes message believers they'll ask
[1:08:20] you questions like why are you moving
[1:08:24] why are you leaving
[1:08:26] and and and wonder what what well what
[1:08:29] what's what um what's happened
[1:08:32] so i just started saying well the will
[1:08:34] of god but i want to say
[1:08:36] does is the will of god not involve
[1:08:38] moving locations
[1:08:40] moving across god can call you to move
[1:08:42] to timbuktu tomorrow
[1:08:45] and and and if somebody's not careful
[1:08:47] they're looking so
[1:08:49] brother david done lost his mind uh well
[1:08:52] i'm sorry whether david was brother
[1:08:54] david for all the other times now he's
[1:08:55] doing something absurd
[1:08:57] timbuk2
[1:09:00] and suddenly he's lost his mind i don't
[1:09:02] know how or god calls you to live in
[1:09:04] downtown chicago and somebody says ah
[1:09:07] brother i don't know how you do that
[1:09:10] the will of god
[1:09:13] it's a simple question
[1:09:15] so so so anyway she's pulled from her
[1:09:18] home and she's put in her position so
[1:09:19] god will move you sometimes that's why i
[1:09:21] was what i was going with that got a
[1:09:22] movie sometimes
[1:09:24] and this is um
[1:09:26] brother andrew coffey was was giving a
[1:09:28] presentation at the men's meetings and
[1:09:29] he was talking about
[1:09:31] training providers young men in the
[1:09:33] church training them to be providers
[1:09:35] and uh but he he brought up a concept
[1:09:38] that's called it's anywhere people
[1:09:40] versus somewhere people
[1:09:42] and this concept is is uh you know this
[1:09:45] this man he his his great-grandfather
[1:09:48] worked at the factory down from the road
[1:09:49] his grandfather worked at the factory
[1:09:51] down at the end of the road his dad
[1:09:52] worked at the factory down at the end of
[1:09:54] the road and he looked at the factory
[1:09:56] down the end of the road well then some
[1:09:58] decision is made in china this trade
[1:10:00] route is taken off this product's not
[1:10:03] bought anymore and that factory's closed
[1:10:04] down now they don't know what to do
[1:10:07] that's a somewhere people but in
[1:10:09] anywhere people
[1:10:10] the market dries up they move
[1:10:13] they move from chicago to denver where
[1:10:15] the market's hot
[1:10:16] then that dries up they move right so
[1:10:18] they have no issues they're anywhere
[1:10:20] anywhere you want to go
[1:10:21] and it's it stuck with me because i
[1:10:23] thought you know that's true with us in
[1:10:25] our life we have to be careful not to
[1:10:27] put a period at the end of god's will
[1:10:29] for our life
[1:10:31] what's god going to call you to do
[1:10:32] tomorrow
[1:10:33] you don't know but you can prepare
[1:10:36] yourself
[1:10:37] for that
[1:10:39] you can prepare yourself for what god
[1:10:41] because guess what you don't want to
[1:10:42] miss you don't want to miss his voice
[1:10:44] because you miss it you here's the thing
[1:10:48] as a
[1:10:49] as a predestinated seat of christ you
[1:10:51] will come to your position
[1:10:53] but wouldn't you rather get there the
[1:10:54] easiest way possible
[1:10:58] so if you're paying attention if you're
[1:11:00] if you're focused on sounding for christ
[1:11:02] when god asks you to move
[1:11:04] to
[1:11:06] northern siberia
[1:11:10] you say where's my backpack
[1:11:12] for northern alaska barrow where it's
[1:11:14] dark all year round
[1:11:16] right you're ready
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:20] you're sounding for christ so she
[1:11:23] she was put into a position where she
[1:11:26] could sound for christ and by her
[1:11:28] testimony
[1:11:30] by her sounding for christ
[1:11:33] a man was delivered from sin leprosy's a
[1:11:36] type of sin a few words spoken of her in
[1:11:40] the season
[1:11:41] in the time
[1:11:43] brought about deliverance
[1:11:46] sometimes god sends you through
[1:11:48] difficulties
[1:11:50] for somebody else
[1:11:52] he'll make you live hell
[1:11:55] go through hell
[1:11:57] so you can be there when someone else
[1:11:59] needs it that's exactly right
[1:12:02] we look at the story of joseph oh joseph
[1:12:05] have every right to be mad at god
[1:12:08] if you will if you will allow me that
[1:12:10] liberty to say that
[1:12:12] but
[1:12:13] inside joseph was something anchored in
[1:12:17] faith
[1:12:18] and when the pressure was put on him he
[1:12:21] didn't crack
[1:12:23] the sound and the music of christ
[1:12:27] bursted forth no matter where he was the
[1:12:29] atmosphere changed because the sound of
[1:12:32] christ was coming from his life
[1:12:35] you have a rough day at the house you
[1:12:38] know everyone's
[1:12:40] put on some nice music that atmosphere
[1:12:42] is created put on the tape that
[1:12:43] atmosphere created right so the same
[1:12:45] thing with joseph potiphar's house
[1:12:48] house excuse me potiphar's house
[1:12:52] abundance
[1:12:53] and blessings
[1:12:56] the jail abundance and blessings you say
[1:13:00] oh god can't bless me here in this
[1:13:02] position with my dad and my family or in
[1:13:04] this position with my husband or my wife
[1:13:07] i just i just need to get out of this
[1:13:08] position no
[1:13:10] god didn't call little girl a little
[1:13:12] maid to get out of her position
[1:13:14] for all we know she went the rest of her
[1:13:16] life in bondage to that family that's
[1:13:18] for all we know but that was the
[1:13:20] position that god placed her in
[1:13:22] i wished i could remember the story but
[1:13:24] i'll try my best there was a a
[1:13:27] a man
[1:13:28] maybe i maybe may have even heard it
[1:13:30] from from our pastor over this pulpit
[1:13:32] but a man that was sent to the remote
[1:13:34] jungles of africa and and and he he they
[1:13:38] he finally got support he went over
[1:13:40] there
[1:13:41] years
[1:13:42] he's been over there years finally um so
[1:13:46] the financial support was pulled because
[1:13:48] nothing was happening
[1:13:50] and um you know his family had gotten
[1:13:52] sick
[1:13:53] i don't think anybody passed away but
[1:13:54] just just turmoil and he was there for
[1:13:56] years and never saw the fruits of his
[1:13:58] labor he
[1:14:01] he you know god called him to leave he
[1:14:03] left
[1:14:05] and
[1:14:06] like i said i wish i had the details but
[1:14:08] sometime later because of him being
[1:14:11] there this person down the road
[1:14:14] they took what he told him
[1:14:17] their life changed finally well after he
[1:14:19] left and he went down the river and just
[1:14:22] lit the whole country side on fire for
[1:14:24] christ
[1:14:26] villages and chiefs and everything just
[1:14:28] whole crop come to fruition but that man
[1:14:32] never saw it
[1:14:34] not always will we see we'll look back
[1:14:36] on our life and say why you know if
[1:14:38] we're not careful
[1:14:40] we'll say well that was a mistake why
[1:14:42] did i do that you know why did i you
[1:14:44] know for me like why did i go to college
[1:14:45] for a semester and waste five thousand
[1:14:47] dollars if i didn't finish college
[1:14:50] i don't know
[1:14:51] i might i might have
[1:14:54] maybe maybe missed it at the beginning
[1:14:56] and god didn't want me to go there
[1:14:58] maybe it was permissive well maybe it
[1:14:59] was the will of god i'm gonna take it in
[1:15:01] this stance it was the will of god and i
[1:15:03] had an impression on somebody
[1:15:06] and i probably will never ever know that
[1:15:09] am i lifting myself up absolutely not
[1:15:10] i'm saying god will place you places to
[1:15:12] do things for other people and you might
[1:15:15] not always know it
[1:15:17] amen you talk about joseph though
[1:15:19] forsaken of his brethren falsely accused
[1:15:21] forgotten in prison and then raised up
[1:15:24] to his position
[1:15:26] so god could use him
[1:15:28] all that that he went through the the
[1:15:31] torment and the the pain that he went
[1:15:34] through was he was blessed
[1:15:37] but god put in a position where he could
[1:15:39] then save the entire
[1:15:42] uh
[1:15:43] country of egypt whatever you want to
[1:15:45] call it
[1:15:47] his entire life was astounding for
[1:15:49] christ
[1:15:50] in what he did and then afterwards
[1:15:52] looking back on his life
[1:15:54] it was a type of christ
[1:15:56] so his whole as a whole sounded for
[1:15:58] christ in that way
[1:16:03] amen sounding for christ is a much
[1:16:04] different sound than the world is used
[1:16:06] to remember my title tonight that
[1:16:08] different sound it's different
[1:16:11] he say here is you heareth me and he
[1:16:13] that despiseth you despiseth me and he
[1:16:15] that despiseth me despises him
[1:16:18] that sent me amen you have to embrace
[1:16:22] that different sound
[1:16:23] we're we're odd to the world and there's
[1:16:25] no way getting around that
[1:16:28] please don't try
[1:16:30] never fear though god will use you
[1:16:33] see that's the thing that's the thing
[1:16:36] the world looks at you and says oh
[1:16:37] you're weak you need a crutch called the
[1:16:39] gospel
[1:16:40] when actually you have the power
[1:16:43] you're the one whose power has the power
[1:16:47] you're not in bondage
[1:16:49] you're in freedom
[1:16:51] they're in bondage
[1:16:53] but in the flesh realm
[1:16:56] so don't feel inferior to them
[1:16:58] because you are called of god you have a
[1:17:01] different sound but guess what you carry
[1:17:03] the power to change lives

[1:18:30] that's the hey let's just start
[1:18:31] there a stone
[1:18:33] somebody dug up
[1:18:35] but we have the bible that's been copied
[1:18:37] and transcribed down through history
[1:18:40] from its origin and they're going to go
[1:18:42] off some stone some loony bin dug up in
[1:18:46] the desert somewhere in the remote
[1:18:48] location in the world anyways
[1:18:51] you just put a little common sense to it
[1:18:52] amen a lot of times you can
[1:18:55] anyways
[1:18:57] let your life sound for christ
[1:19:00] me and him i never talk about the gospel
[1:19:02] again
[1:19:03] but every practice every game
[1:19:06] mine my wife my kids our life is going
[1:19:09] to sound for christ
[1:19:11] amen you must embrace that different
[1:19:13] sound because your life
[1:19:16] through the word
[1:19:17] sounds for christ
[1:19:19] even musicians come tonight
[1:19:25] that is my desire
[1:19:27] i believe that's your desire
[1:19:29] and when we
[1:19:31] get noisy
[1:19:33] help us to lord ask the lord to help us
[1:19:36] to recognize
[1:19:38] that the set that the what we're
[1:19:41] bringing forth is just noise
[1:19:44] sometimes as long as we just need to sh
[1:19:46] we just need to shut up
[1:19:48] just stop talking
[1:19:51] don't say a word
[1:19:52] i was talking to my wife and i was i was
[1:19:54] like man i should have said something
[1:19:55] when that guy's when he said all that
[1:19:58] stuff
[1:19:58] but i i couldn't
[1:20:00] and there's been other times where
[1:20:01] someone has said one little thing and
[1:20:02] i've had all this stuff to say that just
[1:20:05] lined right up and i told her you know i
[1:20:06] was like you know what i i need to not
[1:20:08] feel bad because god didn't want me to
[1:20:10] say anything
[1:20:11] because the bible says do not fear i
[1:20:13] will put the words in your mouth in the
[1:20:15] time that you need to say it not every
[1:20:19] time that you talk to somebody you need
[1:20:20] to say
[1:20:22] explain the doctrine of the of the
[1:20:24] godhead and the serpent see
[1:20:26] and all this stuff
[1:20:28] sometimes you just need to say you know
[1:20:30] what
[1:20:32] my life was a mess
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:34] and then i found christ
[1:20:36] and now it's not
[1:20:39] that's the simple truth of the gospel
[1:20:41] now i'm destined for something
[1:20:44] call it what you want call it fantasy
[1:20:46] but it changed my life
[1:20:48] you find me something that will change
[1:20:51] that can change your life
[1:20:53] i'll move on to that but you can't no
[1:20:56] you can't
[1:20:57] there's nothing out there that can bring
[1:20:59] you the change that you need it can
[1:21:01] bring you the victory you need
[1:21:04] that's like that's the theme of the
[1:21:05] world we live in you know make a better
[1:21:06] body make a better mind
[1:21:09] everybody's trying to get better that
[1:21:10] you can go and every bookshelf and bars
[1:21:13] and nobles or every book starts all
[1:21:14] these books about how to make you better
[1:21:17] and i had to be honest i got caught up
[1:21:18] in that i was and there's some good
[1:21:20] stuff out there there's some good stuff
[1:21:21] that god can give you you can glean from
[1:21:23] that that anywhere people versus
[1:21:25] somewhere people came from a book like
[1:21:26] that and um
[1:21:28] you can clean stuff on that but i got
[1:21:29] really caught up in it
[1:21:31] and and god just just took me through
[1:21:33] that that season and i came up the other
[1:21:35] side and i realized you know there's
[1:21:36] some good in that but it's not all about
[1:21:38] that and i started to look at the man
[1:21:41] who was telling me to read all these
[1:21:43] books
[1:21:43] and he had all these books on every
[1:21:45] shelf in his in it
[1:21:48] and every shelf
[1:21:49] but he didn't have the life
[1:21:52] that he said he did
[1:21:55] message message believer message
[1:21:57] believer because he didn't have a life
[1:22:00] that he said he did because of the books
[1:22:02] or because of the message oh he could
[1:22:05] quote the message
[1:22:07] he could quote the books
[1:22:09] he his list of books he read i'll never
[1:22:11] accomplish
[1:22:13] maybe i don't know
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:16] but
[1:22:18] he didn't there was no life
[1:22:21] there was no life so all that didn't hit
[1:22:23] no good that's all i'm trying to say
