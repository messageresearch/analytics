get the one of my ear to my God bless you can you hear okay all right I um sorry I came out a little late I he's checking on a mic for me I I couldn't use that ear mic that I couldn't find the one I normally use the lapel so I don't know where it's at but the year one I couldn't get fit of my ear so I just said okay we'll we'll do without it then so um I don't know what happened with the other one but not where it normally is so I I don't know if he found it or not but okay still looking okay well God bless you just want you to pray for me I'm a little bit nervous that of course that maybe a little more so you just uh pray for me I know that uh I know what's on my heart the message of the hour I don't mean just me I mean but what's ministered through the fivefold ministry today the true fivefold Ministry Satan hates it because it's it's the unveiling and the and the maturing of himself in Bride form and so that enemy doesn't like that because when you know your position and it's revealed to you and identified in you that little white stone inside of the inside you see what's been hidden and so nothing can move that once it's revealed in you there's not enough mistakes there's not enough failures there's not enough of anything can move that out of your life amen I don't know where Isaac went but we'll just continue here I'd like you to turn with me to St John I um so I'm not a little bit fumbling here with this so I haven't used one of these in a long time so I just uh pray that you'd I know you have prayed and God answers prayer his word will never return void right and so let's just have a word of prayer first our heavenly father it's so good to call you our father why because our father is revealed in us it's eternal life opened and father we know where we come from and we can call you our father Hallowed be thy name and Lord we thank you for this opportunity to express the truth in this hour Lord we know that that the truth Lord is is yourself made known revealed and Lord it's more than just a written word to us it's a revelation it's a it's a reality Lord what in that word has become opened and we know that this can only be open to your little bride and Lord we don't know who that is but individually we can know and Lord That's what Satan doesn't like it don't like that ministered and so Lord we just thank you that we have victory over him his power is broken his power can't stand and we just declare him defeated and and declare that though we're in a Warfare our enemies defeated and we know Lord that we got a very close enemy and this is this old carnal nature Paul talked about it and said oh Wicked Man or oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the from the power of this but he said but through Jesus Christ I am freed and so it's a revelation of that Lord in us that has absolutely delivered us and freed us we're loose completely and we give you praise bless your word now we pray in thy name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen St John chapter 1 verse one I want to you got it okay if you want to hook it up for me I'd rather I'd rather use that than than this because I just feel much more comfortable without this amen yeah so let's just hold off for just a second let I don't want to distract this reading amen but I give you my Title Here My Title tonight is the Word of Life the word of life amen amen my subject is the logos yeah just however you want to hook it yeah I just okay let's just bring it around we know always always amen or maybe you hadn't got it you got it okay good put my jacket on because I feel more like I'm preacher no I'm just kidding that's not the preacher David's not the preacher anyway it's just a a vessel St John 1 verse one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and then verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let me read that scripture again I'll take verse 13 with it let's take verse 12 with but as many as received him is there anybody here that way amen many has received him who is him the word what is that word in verse one up there that word is logos that logos is the thought or concept or the expression or utterance of that thought so we know word is a thought expressed and that's what I want to Major on is that logos because that's what's hidden in this Written Letter and that's what's revealed that's why I call this the word of life because the life the word of life life is eternal life we're speaking of and there's only one form of eternal life and that is God himself and so the word of life the which is then if the logos is the thought or concept or the thought expressed in a word then the The Word of Life the thought of God the word a thought expressed so what's the life the thought expressed in a word what's the word then that's the word of life amen life was expressed amen into a word and then the word was manifested in its season because the word is a seed is the seed right it's his seed yes because these thoughts that we speaking of he had he had all he knew all things but there are thoughts of himself that were to be expressed so let's read that verse let's read let's read let's start with verse one again in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God praise God I can hardly keep still now all right was God now verse he came verse 12 but as many as received him he came to his own that's his own creation and his own received him not but there were thoughts of him himself that could receive that would and did receive him in their in their time amen all right well now we're speaking of something when we speak of the logos now now we're going we're talking about I'm going to subject this of what was before the word what made it word what was before the word that now that is hid in the word amen all right so so the seals opened something that was in the back part of God's mind are you with me that had been held and could not be made known until this hour it wasn't something outside the word it's something in the word it was hidden the word and Satan couldn't know that cuz he would have done great damage cuz he's a perverter but but now it's too late because when these seals opened it opened the it opened the mystery of those seven Thunders amen and so that's what I want to speak of what was what was now in the word revealed from the word that's hid that was that was that was before the word we have the word here amen but what was before the word is something he expressed and it's right here this evening right Among Us amen and that word that thought expressed was God hallelujah my amen now let's let's so so as many as received him to them gave he power that power is authority to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but were born of God what is a new birth what is it it's the spoken word for the day the spoken word created creation a spoken word creation is a new birth is the new birth what is the new birth it's Jesus Christ revealed in you person personally all right so so which were born not of blood will of me but of God and and conjunction tying those scriptures with right here and all above and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory I want just to come right down to the very day we're in right now where we're at right now and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the father what was the only begotten the birth word Jesus Christ was the only begotten of the father is that right then where did we come from you either were begotten of God or you're not begotten of God Amen so so the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen you may be seated 2 Corinthians chapter 3 2 Corinthians 3 verse 2 well we'll take verse one with it do we begin to again to commend ourselves or need we as some other others Epistles or other words written word or letter of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts notice where it's written it's a written word but where is it written written in our hearts known and read of all men amen known and read of all men they read it many read it many some can see it some can't but they read it all right brother brandom said you're a living Bible to the people and the prophet said the little bride today would be the Living Word right she would be the word living Hebrews 412 she would be living and operative the word is living and operative do you believe that the word is living and operative she would be the word living and in action operative living moving let me just go back I've spoken this this has become so open to me it just keeps opening the believer is the faith of God moving in them the believer is the faith we know what faith is faith is a revelation why because faith is revealed now Faith is what's revealed the substance of this word the substance of things hoped for what the promise gives you it becomes a revelation to you yes amen that's substance nothing can take that from you and not is it the substance of things hoped for which we're speaking of that substance tonight not only is because I'm talking about the logos in this word in this word yes this is a written this is a letter this is a written letter but but there's something hid in that letter that he wrote only to the bride what about when you receive it from him and it's revealed to you and and what is it going to do it's got to vindicate this word right what if it's revealed in you where does that place you in Heavenly places in Christ already all right let's just I went a little ahead of myself there let's back up you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for so much for so much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ the Epistle of Christ ministered by us now watch not written with ink not written with ink this is the word of God but we're talking about something that's hid here that's written amen not within think amen I believe this is the word of God written to us the Bible is I believe but I but I believe it holds and contains the revelation of or the thought of this word amen that's what it is because intellectually anyone can read the word and and quote it verbatim don't mean they know it and I believe in reading the word I believe in hearing the word hearing comes by faith comes by hearing the word amen that's why see you see why we needed a prophet because we now by a prophet's word for this end day he brought the revelation of the mystery that was contained in this scripture and without the Holy Ghost you wouldn't know what he said without the Holy Ghost dwelling in you you wouldn't know and without the without the ministry without the perfect interpretation of the word that we have today by Divine Vindication you wouldn't know what this word is speaking see how would you know then how to discern unless the Holy Spirit was in you that was spoken amen is that right all right so so we needed that Prophet we needed a prophet to come with the word because the word of the Lord what word of the Lord the logos came to the prophet yes and he revealed that word that thought of that word out amen why because by the hearing of the word faith Revelation in this word is known to you and I Amen to that bride amen so so he says so he says now but this ministry this this epistle that I'm that Christ declared to be the Epistle of Christ written ministered by us he said it's ministered by us Paul's speaking here it's ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone or in tables of paper he did Minister this you know this is written word what he spoke what he ministered was the word but it was the logos of the word that was ministered amen he spoke it it was ministered it was written somewhere it can be it can be written right here but if it remains right here and doesn't come a a reality in your life you don't see it God has to reveal it so he said it's not written ministered by us but not written with ink but by the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone or or see this this Bible right here someday will burn but the word won't pass away the thought can't pass away because it's Eternal see so so not in tables of stone but in the tables but but it's written in the tables of the heart amen somebody's heart somebody in the heart has the seed of God to be quickened and when that's quickened the thought of God is revealed right my what manner of people ought we to be then yes okay so so because when those seals opened that opened the whole mystery the mystery of God is opened amen the third pull is the opening of that word that hidden word amen okay so not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of heart and such trust have we through Christ such trust to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves see Paul came right back and told you this is not sufficiency of us we don't have the ability of the sufficiency of the man right see that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves well that's a good one but our sufficiency is of God so it laid in God before the word before the beginning where was where was where was it as his thought it was in God it was in him it was dwelling in him where was it it was eternal who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament that's the New Covenant blood Covenant the life of that blood we are now able Ministers of the what the life of the blood the life of the word that may us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen the spirit is giving life all right now we know that the seventh angel what type of message did he have do you notice his type of me message finishes finishing the mysteries of God that are written in the book that's what the Bible said finishes The Mystery of the written book then there was a mystery yet to be unveiled Paul spoke of it Paul spoke of it it was in the word but it was still hid he kept it hid until this hour John was forbidden to write it it was an Unwritten word in in the 10th chapter of Revelation not Unwritten in the scripture It Was Written there it was in there I mean it was hidden there but it was Unwritten yes but now it's being written where now it's being written in the heart of the Bride that's where it's being written and it's still hid amen it's still hid it's still a hidden word but it's open it's open now let me just show you what the prophet said I'm going to skip way ahead here just a minute now this is unveiling of God now it is isn't just a written word to us it's a reality isn't just a written word to us it's a reality he's talking about the written word we have here it's not just that now it is that but it's not just that what has happened is that what's in here between the lines that's why Satan hates that thought of reading between the lines because to the bride she has she because she was in his thought the thought of himself that he put in Word and when the prophet comes with the message of the hour to unveil that she can receive it amen there you are all right so so he said he said now it isn't just a written word now he's talking about now our day our time it's not just a written word to us it's a reality we are in him now we're enjoying now we Behold Him now we see him can you see Jesus absolutely you see him unveiled in you you see Jesus openly it's no longer hid to you it's open he's he's IM morphed himself into another mask he's kinos poured himself in to you and I we are becoming one for the celebration of that Union we're becoming one for the wedding supper amen and what are we we are the anointed word for the season amen we are himself revealed that's who we are that's the logos that's the thought that's what Satan see Satan Satan can and I don't say it's wrong to but Satan can tell you that word he did to Jesus when he tempted him he used the word verbatim it's written but what did Jesus come back with the logos but it's also written amen he re he was speaking the thought because he knew his position he knew where he was standing he spoke what he had and knew what he was in the word what about you and I bride you see you see where Satan where he where he cuts off is when the thought that revelation of that thought when the Revelation that's hid in the word here the thought the thought comes out now we have the word the life is being manifest the life of this word is a spoken word that's why our language is an is a new tongue right brother Paul it's a new tongue why because first John said he we are of God and they that know God hear us our speech isn't of the world they speak they of the world and the world hears them but they that are we are God so we are of God where' we come from we are of God yes then our speeches of himself the revelation of himself the revelation of the word the the original faith that was once delivered to the Saints was the Word of Promise for that hour and now we're we're restored to that original Faith what is it it's what the unwritten word was that was sealed up in it now we have what they had plus we have the full revelation of the word what is is it the restoring of the faith that was once delivered to the fathers what is it the faith the Revelation to see the hour and the day you're in and the promise of the day all those loose ends water baptism serpent seed all those things were he was he was he was unveiling that of the rock but then he took a sharp tool and opened that top of that rock and inside was a Unwritten word he said I must go west and get the revelation of that now looking on that I've got to get that Revelation because it would be that Revelation that would literally didn't he do two things didn't the seventh angel do two things one was to to fulfill and turn the heart and and reveal the mysteries of God Malachi 4 number two was to reveal the secrets hidden in those Thunders that secret and he said it would be that Unwritten word that secret that rever revelation of that that's in the word but it was hid he said it would be that that would literally turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers amen right back to the original Faith amen what is your original faith of course it's God's word revealed for the season the word for the season the hour and they without us couldn't be made perfect amen then we have the Revelation for this hour that's the original Faith it's the original Faith the original Revelation the original Faith we've been brought back back to Restoration just like he said we would be amen think of it that same faith is working living in the Earth today Hallelujah so he said now now we see him the word manifesting himself it's hid out there because why it's veiled in human flesh this Revelation this is a this is veiled in human flesh your flesh My Flesh your flesh it's a veil that hides it but it's unveiled where what is that the Bible said and I'll I'll just kind of Jump Ahead a little bit he said the as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now brother brandham said there's no mental human mental faculty in the heart but he said he's not talking about the human mental faculty the conception of the mind he's talking about the supernatural mind the supernatural being that's unveiled the Supernatural That's unveiled that mind amen as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you want to know where he said that I've got it all right now so we see him the word manifest himself manifesting himself we see we're inside of Christ now as then as then we're inside of Christ amen we are in him it's revealed to the individual amen what's what's revealed what's how can we Behold Him what's revealed as we said those seven Thunders are unveiled what that what the secret is what were those seven Thunders the Revelation contained in the seals it's a message all right that's the message that's the message of the seventh angel that's what would literally that's that message that would literally turn the heart of the children to the faith of those original fathers now here we are we've arrived what are we doing we're we're growing under that under that presence of him into a body change it's on we're it's right on we're right at hand right now we're moving that way we're right now we're we're growing we're maturing in his presence we're maturing in that open word amen give me the book it's mine it's my property it's what's it's it's a revelation of who I am it's a revelation of yourself Lord amen all right so now is then all True Believers see him we're inside of Christ now is then all True Believers see him what are True Believers the faith of God the substance of God the the revelation of God moving living operative in skin behind skin veils in you and I amen a life lived the mystery lived amen amen now is then all True Believers all True Believers see him the Word of Promise of this day openly manifested amen amen amen what was this message it would finish the mystery right of God this that's you can now go back because I didn't I didn't get that quoted perfectly go back where the Prophet said this last this seventh messeng seventh age Angel messenger does two things you go back and read it in church age book I just don't have time but you'll get it all right all all True Believers see him the Word of Promise of this day what promise of this day openly openly what's the third pull it's open the word is open that mystery is open that secret is no open and it's been revealed to someone we know who that someone is and only that someone right it's a secret it's his coming only she knows that all right that's a big why because he unveils his complete self right here to who to you it's not for them the world it's not for the denominations it's not for the system it's for you an individual an individual you that little white stone that you are inside of that stone is that Revelation not written on the outside it's not known to the public it's it's what's inside it's what's inside of you that's come alive yes and to some it's a stumbling Stone it's a rock of offense you think you're special people I know that I'm a special person I don't have to think I am I know I am what makes it that way David know the revealing of himself testifies that before the foundation of the world I was in him known of him walked in him I was his substance to be manifested in a pre season I was eternal as he was because I was himself I was the thought of himself brother bandam said when he thought of you and thought of others it was the thought of himself to be to be uh M to it was the thought of himself to be revealed materialized amen all right so said what kind of see see so what kind of people should we be when the Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts see that that's what is that's absolutely what is coming to every day it's an unfolding an unfolding inch by inch walk by Walk we're walking with God we're walking the brightest in Step marching she's the word living amen how can she be the word living because she was the thought of God that was expressed in a word she's the thought in the word hallelujah you start expressing that logos just start expressing that and that dominating female Spirit Rises up against it it always will because that denomination is a perversion of the original word am it's a lie it's absolutely a lie but we don't have a lie we have the truth amen the truth is revealed the truth is known am amen it's not a it's not I hope so it's Faith the evidence of Things Not Seen when this word becomes becomes that faith amen when this word it's revealed to you you don't have to wonder about it you've already got it because you see it before it happens it's a revelation you see it before it happens and you hold fast that confess you make a confession then what's your confession not a mental conception your confession is a confession of faith if it isn't it's not going to do no good so he promis prom to reveal himself he promised to give you what you need when you need it if you're born of the spirit then it's God working in you it's no more you working you've ceased you're working it's God working through you amen amen that's him that's not another it's him it's not another Glory it's his glory he shares it with not another he shares it with himself the bride is his glory amen there's scripture after scripture after scripture we could show you that amen even Isaiah 60 thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen oh yes St John 17 I give them thy my glory think of that you say you're making yourself equal with god well let this thought be in you let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God who being the morphe of God God in morphe God just taking out another mask what is it what's his name what who is he it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's exactly that virgin born bride she wasn't touched by man she's not touched by man she can't be touched by man the womb is closed to any other seed hallelujah amen all right so that's a big word openly manifest that's a big word if you can get it all True Believers that's in the word see God openly all True Believers that's in the word where's the believer in the word where's the faith in the word where's the what is the word it's God's faith expressed it's God's word expressed it's it's his thought expressed in order for that thought to become creation it was expressed in a word then the word was manifested when in its season this is the season you hear Brother Braham say the word on the day of Pentecost won't work today that so what's he saying we believe what Pentecost brought but he said the word for on the day of Pentecost won't work other words we have more than what they saw it was hidden now we've got it so what's the original Faith the original faith is the word for the season revealed to you just like the word for the season was revealed to them only we have a word for our season that they didn't know this but they had the faith for their season the word for the season is what identifies the bride revealed to her alone it's their season that's the original Faith it's always been that original Faith amen what's what's happening today we have the Capstone capping off what's it doing not only capping off the body copying off his word capping it off but he's capping every individual every pyramid the Pyramid of your life what is the Pyramid of your life it's that stature of himself a perfect man he comes and caps that off what's the message of the hour the capping of it off then we lay under this message and it's got to come to that capping what is that capping a perfect love operating a perfect faith in a perfect word that you are that's why it was opened amen that's why it's revealed Hallelujah all right now he said God stands openly the veil is rent that's the word see God's openly the veil is rent God stands openly before you manifest it manifest it openly before you manifest it see God man you say oh that was the prophet no that's you if that prophet's message didn't go anywhere if it didn't come into the heart of the Bride there's something wrong because under our messenger we become that voice that's another language brother Paul we become that voice what is the voice of the Word of Promise for the hour the open word the seventh seal is unveiled to you personally who is it himself his coming himself what's the promise in this hour there had to arise a royal seed it would be a royal bride and the promises in the scriptures Malachi 4 is one of those promises Revelations 10 another promise where is it where is it happening yes this day the scripture is fulfilled I'm saying tonight this day the scripture is fulfilled that's when Peter stood up the day at Pentecost and preached the message this day the scripture is fulfilled I sold that from Brother Chad anyway but I like it because that's what he preached he preached this day he went back to Joel picked up the scriptures and said this day what you read in the word the thought in that word is revealed that thought that low goost is revealed it's open am to someone and that someone was in his thought it was the thought of himself for that day and season now what's our day in season where's the faith amen then you become see you were his thought the word the what is excuse me see God manifested open manifested open you were his thought now we could go back to the church age book and pick it out the thoughts were real and existence see the Eternal thoughts of God are the thoughts of God Eternal yes they're Eternal what made the difference between Jacob and Esau Jacob was the seed Jacob was the brother Bram said Jacob was the thought amen it was the thought of God that made the difference and that thought when it's expressed as comes a seed and you plant the seed in It season and it's got to reproduce itself Glory bride do you see what you are it's open it's openly manifested hallelujah it's outside of your realm of thinking it's outside of your carnal mind it's outside of that it's not in that it's a supernatural element of the inside of the inside of the inward man that happens to be the Living Word himself manifested through flesh ordering directing guiding quickening your mortal body and bringing it subject to that wordl you don't have to make that work that up and pump that up you don't have to do anything about it you just need to feed and ask God to reveal himself without a spiritual Revelation it won't be no good it takes that spiritual revealing of that thought that was in God and I always said when you know where you come from you know where you're going if you know where you're going you know who you are and if you know where you come from you know who you are then you know where you're going there's no question about it it's unveiled I'm identified I can speak as an individual because it's only individuals it's not this group that group another group it's individuals that catch the Revelation that stone was the elect Stone it's an individual it's white but it's what's in the stone that made the difference it's what's in the stone it's what's revealed to the bride that's his name that's his name that's his life what are you bringing forth the promised son you've now received enough faith and have faith to be to conceive and we've conceived there's a bride conceiving my I wish I had time it's not enough time in one sermon what time is it yeah I have just a little time here okay I can't I can't bring everything here but it's but I've got to hit some places okay now when he present it to you as a thought his before a word it's a thought before a word it's a thought amen and the thought has to be created you see those thoughts were real in God's mind it was what was it in him it was it was revealed to him it was Revelation he he had to just speak the thought he had to speak the Revelation now I'm coming to something here and we'll end with that all right now that's what he said so he presents it now before a word it's a thought I'm going to back up on that just a little bit I want to cut something before I get to that point now I'm bypassing a lot in the church age book and you understand because of time and maybe I'll pick it up again here in another in the next sermon or something but but in in on if you want to write these down page 166 paragraph 173 through 174 and then read from paragraph 163 paragraph 163 is amazing because the God's heart purpose his eternal purpose what was God's Eternal purpose right was to have a bride was to have a bride that was his heart purpose that was his eternal purpose and the only way he could get her was to unveil himself completely at the end and that would produce faith for a body change brother Ram said what we had wouldn't have worked until those seals opened amen you see how important these seals are there lays the message there lays the Faith your faith I say your faith what is the victory our faith what is our faith if you're a True Believer filled with the Holy Ghost identified in him what is the our faith the victory what is our faith God is our faith God is my Revelation Psalm 62 said God is my rock my Revelation amen nobody's standing up here boasting brother sister I'm not exalting this human body this flesh I dwell I I am that unveiled word on the inside the inside but I have a twin that's real close to me that's right but I'll have you know the Bible said that the Elder would serve the younger amen is that so I happen to be that new creation there predestinated by God the thought of God and was expressed in a message today and I've come alive under that why identifying that I'm his thought I'm himself revealed in this hour amen you see that's the younger the first one was was the man part this old man this old Wretched Man that I am as we said see Paul said who's going to deliver me from it but thank God through the revelation of Jesus Christ in me I am delivered of of it I don't care what it does how it does what it does what it says it's not me amen I bring that under obedience to the word that is me the word is me we die every day Bible said that that the Bible said that we die daily the scripture said we bear in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus what for so that the life also of Jesus may be man manifest in our mortal body what is it the Word of Life what is it the thought there that I am that I had that I receive the Revelation the truth the word now becomes living see you can't argue brother sister a religious person an intellectual religious person why goodness sake they out quote the word any day to you put a wrong interpretation whatever they got their relig they can be they can be 99 98% 99% true but they leave off one little thing and what is it a lie right what did Satan deceive e by a lie it's a lie not truth where's the truth where is where is it what defeated the devil just just Jesus quoting scripture back no he was testifying of who he is who he was and where he come from and he said Thou shalt Worship the Lord God and him only only shall you serve what was it the logos the thought in the word what are we here to Pro to proclaim the thought in the word the thought in God I act like a drunk man forgive me I guess I am CU this is more real to me than he's standing up here what is it it's it's got to be somebody I know they may be few but just stand just stand where he placed you you're seated now in heaven places Satan can't get to you if he tried if he tried to get to that place he'd have to come through the blood oh he can meet up there but he can't take that position and he knows that position is God himself the very creator of heavens and earth in the bride form in that position he's in position and she is in position in him amen amen amen amen hallelujah maybe maybe I don't say it just right but I'm saying it the way comes to me all I can do but I know this you can't explain this you cannot explain what that mystery is that secret you can't do it if you tried it didn't wasn't meant to be explained it was to be revealed that's why Satan couldn't get it it's a revelation not something you explain not something you conceive with your mind it's revealed to you that's God's faith amen amen amen all right now see we come to Jesus then we come to Jesus the logos now see the a mystery in scripture let me just get this a mystery in scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed brother bram's quoting this scoffield he's quoting this he said this is what it is he preached that and Sir is this the is this the end sir is this the time of the end sir ask asking God is this it and before the sermon ended he already answered the question yes it is all right so so he he didn't come back at he changed the title he said what time is it sir we've arrived the end has come we're here the end is here did you know that then what was to be unveiled in the end what would denote the end what would what would be the the the sign of the end these Seven Seals are opened the mystery of those suers is revealed not a mystery to her she sees it amen and she's growing into it amen developing into it yes what is what himself she's his she is his eternal possession she is his kingdom she's the word living manifested in your life in flesh amen now well Brother David he's gone off the deep end yes let me alone I like this deep end I can swim anyway all right I don't have to tiptoe along the bottom I can swim was made for me amen I'm free yes I got the that whole expans to swi in now all right so it's a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is there is a super but which there's a supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation oh God sent a prophet yes sir he revealed what is it it's so simple you and your carnal mind wouldn't even be able to touch it you can't get simple enough you as a man a woman cannot get simple enough to see this simple Revelation it's so simple so what makes the difference it's revealed amen because God becomes so simple it goes beyond our human carnal Simplicity of what we call simple amen I'm telling you you just get into it and see you see he said it in such a way it would stumble some cause some to ponder and separate and thin down his crowd but the bride because she was his thought and that thought was expressed she's going to see it supernaturally because she's got to see it individually she'll have the revelation of the Revelation because that Supernatural element is what you receive in your soul that's what's divinely revealed to you personally because it's been revealed amen it's got a line doesn't it and only she can know if it aligns or doesn't align because she is in the author of it amen she is in him so what is this hour what is this time it's him in action it's him manifested it's all his achieving now it's a revelation to you an in to you as an individual of the Revelation or the message of the seventh angel revealed in you the revelation of the revelation then we come to Jesus the logos who is Jesus the logos the thought expressed manifested in flesh what about our day is he still the same where is he well I haven't see the calvary man you're just stuck on the man where is he where's the opened word where is the revealing of the word oh to that old that old Wretched Man over there that no Beauty we desire him well be careful because there he is hid and in fact he makes it so ridiculous you'd turn away from it unless that life was in there to hear the voice because what the bride's ministering she has a great message she has the ministry she has a Ministry she has a great ministry brother Bram said it's the message of the ministry of the hour so what's she ministering the faith and who's going to hear it those that are of God the only ones that can so what are we going to do get all upset because the majority aren't right I'm not talking about just the church I'm talking about majority aren't because I reason I said that because the bride's a minority we going to get upset because the majority don't or we just going to keep preaching to the ones that can there's got to be somebody can we're not responsible for those that can't we're not responsible even how they receive it we're responsible to bring the Revelation for the season and the hour because this ministry of this bride is consisting of a fivefold Ministry Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists what are they preaching the revelation of the hour you try to preach another hour another time you're out of position he said don't misplace it don't misinterpret it right that right so what's it going to take Revelation leave it alone you ask God for Revelation when God reveals it go forward just walk in the light he's given you that's all he's requiring don't add to it don't put your opinion on it don't look at the Affairs and how people react to it because then man becomes your your stabilizer man becomes your confidence instead of God the word becomes your confidence you're looking at what they do instead of looking what he wants that little man that played that violin and everybody stood up and Applause and sat out and stood up again and Applause he didn't seem to be moved by that he had his eyes on one person yes his master what does he think about it is it pleasing to him there's only one thing that'll please God faith his faith that's right his faith you know there's a power in in in intellectual Faith you know that but his faith but that will never put you in a body ch so it has to be the word revealed in you amen am there's no other way around it you can have all the religion you want to make out of this message and the message become religion to many people but this message is not a book of rules and regulation it's not religion it absolutely is God himself the word manifested in flesh seeing receiving openly seeing the word for the season and living it and walking it and they think what kind of person is see Revelation always stumbles the carnal mind they don't get it they don't see it see but that doesn't my concern or yours just live it God will live it you don't have to make it pump it up and try to live it if you're trying to live it if you're trying to please and trying to live it trying to do Works to get into it thinking that's going to do it it won't do it a bit won't do it that's not what the bride's made up of she is his thought she is his faith she is the word made manifest am not for another season this season she's the one that catches it all right I've got to close now so he was the logos Jesus was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word then what then is that is what he is and forever will be other words he still is now it says that he ha chosen that he hath chosen Us in him Jesus said he we were chosen in him now where's the logos see before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world what were the thoughts of God Eternal thoughts that was God himself the thoughts of himself you're that Eternal thought you are that thought manifest you are it gives you an eternal quality that quality is a distinctive attribute it's a distinctive characteristic it's it's a distinctive characteristic possessed by you it's a it's a it's a feature it's a trait it's an attribute it's a characteristic it's a Mark it's a stamp it's life it's seal it's Faith it's his faith that's that quality amen all right Philippians 2 as I said let this mind be in you so see you were right with him in the mind and thoughts of God that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that no we can't now in the beginning was the word that was God and the Word was God that's right and this same word was made flesh and dwelt among us and then God was made flesh that without controversy that's true God was made flesh why people say yes praise the Lord that's that's right he was made flesh no wait a minute he can't be the same today he's still made flesh and his name is still Jesus in fact it's Mrs Jesus yeah yeah it's his name he was to be bride he had a thought to be bride he wanted to be bride that was his objective that was his that was his heart purpose that to have a bride of his own choosing that was his eternal purpose can you understand you were his eternal purpose talk about A Love Affair what will that love do always point back to the word always point back to the word always back to what the word the thought in this word it'll always point back and say here it is here it is well yeah that's a scripture I know that one yeah but you don't go the thought of it when that thought's revealed to you that's different how many knows that thought's revealed then a deeper thought's revealed then we call it deeper it's deeper it's just more simple all the time it just keep it's coming to one specific position that's him he wanted to be you he determined to be you you his thought of you it was his thought of you he wanted to be bride he said I'm going to have a bride and that'll be me and I'll even prepare the ground and that's my making Amen to receive it so he's the ground and he's and he's the life yes so we worship Him in spirit and in truth amen without you're not the you're not here to you're not here to to preach just letter you're here to preach reality we use a letter certainly do because we have a prophet that took us back to this word showed us what was there but don't add to that interpretation and don't take away from it many of man are putting their own thought to brother Brown just didn't mean that that scripture means something different why my theology teaches me better than that oh really your theology will only take you back to the beginning beyond that you can't enter that the that theology won't enter cuz now we're going back into the very Mind Of God which was expressed in the word that's you that's him and that's you that catches that Revelation right there you can't I'll just pick it up no you don't pick it up you feed on it and you quit worrying about whether you're going to get it or what you're going to do you just give your all I'm going to come to a quote real quick I got to just to quit now all right all right so now before before this was word what is a word a a word is a manifested thought okay we got that now in the beginning that's it was a word that's as far as they can go by theology but before the word was it was a thought and that thought was made manifest now I'm quoting right from that that message you took on Sunday that leaped at me there's a paragraph there that I just could not run from I'm not here to preach your message brother Paul I'm just here to express it in the way that God want me to minister it amen that's all he's going to minister it through you it all Blends right together absolutely absolutely we're talking about eternal do you realize that time is eternity space you ever hear a prophet say you that time is a little hickey eternity continues on but time dropped down eternity dropped down into a time space and brother bam said all time is is eternity's space and you go right back into eternity again right and continues on so what was that thought in you what's that thought revealed what's the thought of God it's the thought of God what is that Eternal it's the Eternal Word it's the word of life amen so before the word it was a thought and a thought was manifest you see what I mean first it was the thought and he spoke the word and the Word was manifest oh how infallible God is God's mind the mind that was in the beginning was brought was a thought before it was a word that expressed Jesus Christ the same one was expressing that word right back again because he said let the tree talk fig tree don't man eat of you anymore see what was it it was God's mind expressed and every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass see what I mean how powerful could the church be the Bible said let the mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he see and brother Brown said he was speaking of the supernatural being all right now now that if that same Spirit now remember we have the same Spirit of Faith 2 Corinthians 4:13 Paul said we having the same Spirit of Faith now if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light he said let there be trees there was trees he said if that same mind that was in Christ be in you how much could it say if that same mind was in Christ as in you how much could it say let there be no cancer and it would be gone let there be blind eyes be opened and it would be so see it's your thought verily Jesus said verily verily he said first in Mark 11:22 have faith in God you know what the translation of that is brother brandham even told us he said have faith have the faith of God Mark 11:22 have the faith of God for verily I say unto you if you shall say to this mountain be moved plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart don't doubt in your heart not in your mind out here your flesh man but don't doubt in your heart are you with me it's going to bring this mind under obedience but don't doubt there can't be doubt in the heart because when you speak his thought it had to come from the heart other words it's just a mental conception if it's not a divine revelation it's not his word you see what the difference is so many just speak their mental conception but when you speak Revelation that's different when you speak his thought when you speak his mind okay now all right all right okay you can have what you say now Romans 108 said that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth the word of what the word of faith amen what's your confession the word of Faith all right now as you say Brother David you say how well I want to make it happen I got to have it right now no God wants you to wait you can me give it a right mental attitude you follow what I'm saying God will reveal it you just go on holding on but when God reveals it that's settled that's finished right there then speak that it can no more pass away than his word it never will pass away why because God that thought of God has become a direct Revelation to you now I you want to hear what he said about that I'll close with this now you can you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happened what is it substance you see it before it happened and express it in word form that word takes a hold and becomes material there it is right there there is the Walk of the people of God that's God's walk right there okay that's how that's how that's how Enoch walked oh my how God could if your heart and your mind is so infilled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts amen there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving in your mortal being oh my what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied ower that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church would we be yes how's that church made up see see what we've got to do what the bride's doing is going it's gone from church to bride he said I won't call you church anymore I'll call you bride so she's got to you've got to go from church to bride you've got to turn the corner because who's he dealing with now he's dealing with the bride that's come out of that church amen it's no more church it's bride it's a bride age he said it's a bride time it's seed time it's bride time it's virgin word time amen all right I'm closing now then when the human element goes out you don't use your own thoughts you have no alternative of your own just led by the spirit and that and and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God then let him lead see but when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself I mind that just spoke to me so impact where you empty yourself where you aren't the one projecting your the man out here you're not projecting that amen then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what see what's he doing in this message prophesying right of what would take place of what we are having having and enjoying now and what the seals would open he said it's moving and it's got to come to that spot amen amen you see we've had the sign of the Union a spiritual sign of that Union taking place amen all right you see what I mean it's your thoughts become words and words will become material that's when the church is in its power I believe it's on the road that's what I was referring to right there when the church will be so wrapped in Christ and the Holy Spirit mankind so away from themselves that they don't see themselves wow is't that great they don't have no thoughts but to serve God and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ is in the human heart moving in the Holy H ghost that great wonderful C church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind look at Malachi 4 here prophesying right of what that corner turning did and is doing amen all right now now okay now I'm I just stand with me would you please I don't want to hear music quite yet but I'm just going to finish with this just stand up don't miss the don't miss them hold on just a minute I want to read this one quote Tim right here before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created God's thoughts become creation when it's spoke by a word then when he presents it to you as a thought this is your capping right here when he presents it to you as a thought his thoughts and it's revealed to you then it's still a thought until you speak it okay God bless you my sheep hear my voice the logos in the word the thought spoken watch what God's doing what is he revealing to you he's revealing the logos the thought in that word and what's revealed to you is still a thought but whose thought is it if you want to say it's my thought the word it's truth if you want to say it's my thought the man it's untruth because it's God's word it's God's thought and when it's revealed in you and you speak it heavens and earth will pass away but that thing's got to happen why because it's a direct revelation of the mind of God it's the word of life am all right now amen and the Revelation is the only thing the revelation of the word what was the difference between Cain and Abel one thing one had the revelation of the promise he knew he understood what the sacrifice the other one didn't why two different seed two different natures they both had to produce what they were yeah so do we have it today so every seed will produce and manifest its kind amen all right and so Upon This Rock Revelation I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you what is Faith then the substance of things hoped for has been revealed to you what's in this word is a revelation to you it's living it's active it's the word amen it's a discerner it directs it guides it provides you have no lack everything you have need of your confidence is in the revealed word unveiled word excuse me in you amen not in this amen and it's written in here amen it's got to come off those pages and become in here made
