god bless you it's good to have you as well i'd like to sing number 4 30 before i turned the service to brother paul of the pablo when he was here he sang it as a special i'd like to sing it as a congregation if we could bless it be your eyes of god oh blessed be your eyes for they see the things of god that were spoken by the prophet in our days they were hidden from the wise and revealed to those who learned i'm so glad he touched my eyes that i might see [Music] with his hands raised high [Music] he was taken by surprise for when he opened up his eyes but it placed within his hand a gleaming soul oh blessed we arise for they see the things of god that were spoken by the prophet in our days they were hidden i'm so glad he touched my eyes that i might see now the sword of the king he didn't miss a single thing as it caught away the veil for our eyes god is true to his word and the message we have heard i'm so glad he came to make us realize oh blessed be your eyes for they see the things of god that were spoken by the prophet in our day [Music] they were hidden from the wise [Music] i'm so glad he touched my eyes that i might see [Music] all the mysteries of god are revealed they're open wide jesus came to work to tell them to his bride and he promised in his word that we never ever fart cause he writes his precious words upon the tables of our hearts oh blessed be your eyes for they see the things of god spoken by the prophet in our day they were hidden from the watch i'm so glad he touched my eyes that i might see [Music] oh bless your eyes for they see the things of god that were spoken by the prophet in our day they were hidden from the wise and revealed to those who learned i'm so glad he touched my eyes that i might [Music] for they see the things of god that was spoken by and revealed to those who learned can we just give a little thank you to the lord oh thank you lord for touching my eyes lord that i might see oh god living in a day of spiritual blindness a day of spiritual deafness but god has been so gracious to come and open our eyes in our ears hallelujah hallelujah thank you thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah good to be in the house of the lord today amen to see each and every one of you amen this body of believers the family of god amen how how precious it is uh brother jason made a comment and i want to expound upon that just a little bit the dire condition now by brother and sister we could probably go to every continent and find sons and daughters of god the bride of jesus christ that's in dire circumstance and and uh certainly there would be so many needs individually i mean even sometimes within this just the north and the south and the east and the west of a of a county or a country or continent there would be these needs but just as i bring this uh to your attention i just want to share that we have sent an offering on your behalf right we we our grace tabernacle not one individual not one family not we are the family amen so we have sent an offering on your behalf there is an avenue by which a limited amount of supplies can be shipped into venezuela and it's not something that can be done in an extensive way but you know as the reports come back how god just knows where to distribute how to do it and and for a season it was closed down but it appears that the door has opened again or not appears it is open again for for you know a pallet or two here and there to be sent in and saints says the reports come back if you can only imagine someone crying and thanking god for the simple fact that one little thing came to them get this yes to brush their teeth with real toothpaste after a year or two something special to them so we have sent an offering on your behalf for the saints there in venezuela it is so bad that the military in colombia and peru and brazil have now blockaded the borders with their military to keep venezuelans from crossing a mass exodus one brother that has a church very close to the border of venezuela has reported back that the streets the alleys every vacant place in their village has people sleeping on the ground they have no work they have no food many of them only the clothes on their back and they're begging and thus in the natural it is also tearing down the structure of colombia peru brazil because of the flood of people and many of them are believers and we know that god has everything in control so i just ask you to lift it up we think that it's bad here sometimes but god knows and god guides and so just remember them in your prayers amen hallelujah once again i say it's good to be in the house of the lord today i'd just like to speak to you this morning on redemption's manifestation there is light in the valley amen and i've preached on this subject before but saints just as uh we're sometimes have ups and downs in our lives and as i was just reading my bible amen did you like that little video this last sunday just a reminder of the direct benefit of reading our bible amen not just once or twice or three times isn't that interesting how that was brought out you know once no perceptible difference twice no perceptible difference three times no perceptible different four spikes up five spikes up six spikes up hallelujah just think if we just listen to what brother branham encouraged and read our bible every single day wow hallelujah amen oh my i get a shiver from that hallelujah there is light in the valley let's stand and turn to the 23rd psalm amen what a beautiful piece of scripture that is there my brother and sister uh just uh um well let's read it together hallelujah instead of just the preacher reading something to you let's let's read it together okay the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anoint us my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever amen lord we ask for your blessing upon the word of god and its blessing that it shares to us in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated you know as we would look at this my brother and sister we can read this as a beautiful passage of scripture uh an encouraging line or we can read it as it were as a storyline of our lives and if we read it as a story line of our lives and we will identify with each and every every uh verse it is not my brother and sister uh let me just put a clarity of what's rumbling through my mind many times in scripture we refer to chapter and verse but you see it was man now i believe by inspiration but it was men who put the place that the break and the stop and the period and the verse number you see god's word is one continuous story amen it isn't broken as it were like we break it up but yet you can read it as one continuous we have a reference point verse this verse that but to read the thing as a complete story to you and i and we'll touch on that in just a little bit so as we read this uh 23rd psalm as a storyline of our life right we have to identify with this in our own life and you know just for the sake of example this morning i would just take at this point amen the lord is paul's shepherd i shall not want he maketh paul to lie down in green pastures he leadeth paul beside the still water see if you read it in that context and identify yourself in the scripture that this is not god just speaking to someone uh many years ago but this is god speaking to you today amen that's how you need to take the bible approach it is god speaking to me today and insert your name into the word of god when you read it now you know we've talked about this many times in the past there's not everything that's written in the bible is for the believer right we are not being thrown into the pit right we are not uh considered adulterers or iniquity or unrighteousness so there's many portions of the scripture that don't identify with us but my brother and sister according to the word every promise that is given to a son or daughter of god as a scripture in revelations 19 that we are his wife and that's why we identify as the bride of christ right because the bride and the wife are parallel and so as the bride of christ we are identified in the word and so we stand today and insert ourself now some people might think that that is presumptuous i've been told before that to put our pla ourselves into that is presumptuous but the prophet of god told us to identify ourselves in the word of god and so by identifying ourself into that i say i am the bride of christ amen i i'm revelations 19 5 6 7 8 9 amen that's who i am and and i identify that and now if people are just looking for a place to feel good right and this is an issue that we have in the day that we live in when you are talking with someone and they say well i go to church because it makes me feel good well that's wonderful i go to church because it makes me feel good too but the reason i come to church and the feeling good is the fact that i recognize the word is changing me amen i'm not just here to feel good and go home amen now look i just don't don't get bent out of shape over this eating ice cream makes me feel good but it won't save me in fact it will tear me down so feeling good is irrelevant right the scripture says that your heart would deceive you so you can feel good about things and it not be on a foundation that will give you eternal life now i want to just go back for a moment just through the scripture and you know as i said here i want to just identify this when we come to the place my brother and sister that you will make an emphatic irreversible statement and that is where you come to a place that it is a statement though seemingly contradictory you will not take it back you will not recant upon that statement amen and i would like you to as we just touch on this for a moment to make these irreversible statements on your part amen that you cannot recant from you cannot go back you cannot step away from amen the lord is my shepherd amen that leaves with that kind of a approach that leaves there is simply no other statement can take that statement's place are you with me there's not room for another shepherd there's not room for another form of leadership regardless if it makes you feel good or not my my brother and sister when the 70 were with jesus they were quite convinced my brother and sister that there was something supernatural there but when he looked them in the face and said you must eat my flesh and drink my blood they said well he's went over the edge but you see there were some as it was and he said well will you leave me too oh don't you love those beautiful words where would we go there is no place for us to go some said oh we're going back to our church we're going back to our old ways we're going back to this and back to that but there was some oh hallelujah there was some that stood there and said where would we go i've got nowhere else to go and it wasn't based on an emotional thing because they still had houses and lands fathers and mothers sisters and brothers but their soul was what was crying out we've got nowhere else to go hallelujah aren't you glad today amen i shall not want look i tell you what my brother and sister we live in laodicea we live in an age that and that look we're all guilty i don't mean to demean or speak down to anyone but we're all guilty of saying i want this now this is not to take away from the human element that there are certain things we want we were just talking brother jason sister emmy uh uh uh we're we're there at the house for a few minutes and we were just talking and we're telling them when the day is appropriate we're gonna buy us a four-door chevy pickup for a family car hallelujah long as i don't bankrupt myself and i don't backslide to own one what's wrong with owning a four-door pickup for a family car hallelujah it's a real man's family car thank you hallelujah you see but we have to temper what our wants is because you see want very easily and i'm not going to speak on this topic i'm just going to touch on it move on but want can very easily move over into the lust of the flesh [Music] so we have to leave that in god's hands ask for his leadership lord if you want you know i just share this just a personal note and i am sidetracked when i was in high school and then on up and got married to sister jerry and years after that i always wanted a yellow corvette that's just the other side of me in case you didn't know i could see myself you know oh that's me oh look at that one i'd settle for a red one oh i would take a black one too but the day came when i probably could own one and i realize it's not that important any longer you see that's when we start to submit ourselves to the will of god we can say i would like this i still like corvettes when one goes down the road i'm like nice hallelujah i'm not totally off on my own am i but you see i realize of the things in life that's not very high on the list any longer and if i never own a nice totally loaded leather seats chrome wheels running boards four-door pickup for a family car my life won't go down the drain but i stand here to make my point and say i want one but is that the want the scripture is talking about no it's not you see the thirst of the soul becomes a preeminent factor in the life of a son or daughter of god when the soul starts crying out i could bring you many references today according to the words of the prophet but my brother and sister when the soul cries out for the things of god when the soul yearns when the soul speaks out in the midnight hour when the soul is hungry god said i will fill it and i will satisfy it and in that sons and daughters of god the words start to come in preeminence to them they start to hunger for it they start to cry out to understand it and to see it manifested in their life and god said you won't want amen if you are sincere and you cry out to the lord you will not find your soul hungry you will find yourself satisfied in the things of god hallelujah my brother and sister i could go on into many things that go with this but it would take too long but i want you to understand if you feel a yearning in your soul remember the prophet of god said the deep calleth to the deep make sure what you're crying out for is the correct thing otherwise the want will continue to exist or remain in your life now i like verse 2 he maketh me to lie down in green pastures now you know that would almost sound like he just forced you to go he maketh but when you go and you research this and look into it and you don't have to look very deep the the basic uh simplistic definition of maketh comes to a cause to happen so he would cause us oh my brother and sister it's not of a parent that's angry at their unruly child in church that grabs them by the back of the neck and walks them out of church you know that kid could say my daddy maketh me go into the basement hey man i remember a child once sister jerry shares his testimony up misbehaving in church and and all this and his daddy grabbed a hold of his packing him out of church and the little kid leaned over his daddy's back that's a real story leaned over his daddy's back and goes church pray for me daddy maketh but you see this is not the case he maketh me to lie down in green pastures is not god grabbing you by the nap of the neck and taking you down into a green pasture somewhere and saying stay here but he is causing bringing the effect that causes us to go a yearning of hungering a desire and something that leads us right down into that green pasture because he knows what's in that pasture is necessary for you and i and he puts that hunger in the soul to say lord i submit to your leadership i submit to your will not the grand a hand of a great big father forcing you but because you are sons and daughters of god predestination as it were he leads you he inspires you he puts a hunger in you a desire is there to go there hallelujah you see this can also be brought when you research this out maketh is caused to happen in simplicity uh maketh to cause to happen amen versus leaving to chance amen he by chance no my brother and sister god don't operate that way not a god that knows every hair on your head not a god that knows everything about creation did not leave to chance you coming to his word he never left it if they stumble into my word i'll heal them i'll save them i'll preserve them no he didn't do that it was by divine leadership oh my brother and sister by divine leadership he calls to happen that we would desire to be there in that green pasture and to be at those still waters oh hallelujah he restoreth my soul that means our soul was fallen you can't restore something that's not separated he restoreth my soul oh hallelujah i think we could just close down right now just have a little prayer and worship and just stand up and praise the lord for the next hour he restoreth my soul i was lost i was undone i had fallen away i had got cold on god amen come on you know some natural things type spirituals so closely just looked at a headline the other day brother jason brought it up which stirred my mind in the in the back room seven days to a healthy habit seven days to being cold on god what works forward works in reverse amen read your bible and pray every single day right even research i'm going to look back in that video figure out who those people are and see if they have more stuff i was interested but my brother and sister if it takes your bible four times reading your bible four times a week to spike something in you as a nature my brother and sister then and it multiplies he said it didn't just ramp up it it's spike that's the word i'm looking for it's spiked up hallelujah now what is the reverse what is the reverse i want you to think about that amen i'm gonna i'm gonna do what they call a reverse theoretical analysis okay just a little psychology for you i know you're all into that last week i read my bible seven times praise the lord felt inspired this week i read it six times the week after that i read it five times the week after i read it four times then three then two then one then zero you know what the reverse theoretical analysis shows you i read it once nothing really changed twice nothing really changed three times nothing really changed four five six seven but in a reverse theoretical analysis it will be seven six five four three two one zero praise the lord think about it who do you want to be let me tell you a little story i recently read about a man who was sitting among some school kids i think they were in high school the man was very successful a businessman was very committed to the community he was trying to encourage these young men so he sits down amongst these kids like i said high school kids and he says um as he starts through the kids what do you want to be i i want to be a plumber like my dad everybody's like oh plumber i want to be this i want to be this i want to be a dis i want to be a doctor why do you want to be a doctor doctors are rich one kid just cut to the chase i don't want to work i just want to be rich the man looked at all these kids and he come back and he says who's most likely to succeed in this class and a lot of the kids said well the one that wants to be a doctor the one that wants to be a lawyer they make the most money they'll be successful he said no you're wrong the plumber will be because the plumber is willing to work for what he has and as he labors he will be a a um steward he'll be a steward because he labored or are you with me he'll be a steward because he labored for what he got and therefore he'll take care of it but the one who would be given the wealth will squander it because easy come easy go my brother and sister that's why god's making you labor imagine if god just said oh you come up here and and touch the whatever or do this or do that you'll have the holy ghost and just go now you know there's no effort involved do you ever notice the direct correlation young people that if you sweat for that first vehicle you ever own you won't be jumping curbs you won't be driving through the bar ditch you won't be burning out the tires because you'd be there like if i ruin these tires i'm gonna have to sweat and labor for more if the holy ghost was just something now look the holy ghost comes from the laying on of hands you realize that's scriptural right come from the laying on of hands but did you realize the hands never got laid until the vessel was ready god didn't just randomly run out on the streets and the highways and byways just laying hands on everybody giving them the holy ghost that person had labored and they had moved forward and they had got themselves into a position and the laying on of hands that anointing for god to come down into their atmosphere and give them the holy ghost was actually the identifier of the preparation that brought them to be a vessel ready to receive the holy ghost if not in the carnal element right we see it in the scripture hey uh what would it cost me to have this gift i would like that gift also i'll write you a check i'll put gold in the offering i'll do whatever give me the gift amen hallelujah i want to just touch on verse 5 before we go on god loves you so much of all the places he could prepare a table for you he went down and found your enemies and he put the table right there in the midst of your enemies and set that table for you i've said this before i'll say it again that brother that sister that preacher that you don't like so much they were god's special gift to you but i don't like them that's all right god set you with that table amen hallelujah well some of you ought to really be saying well thank you lord that be a revelation to you yeah why because we need to be sharpened all this mind moan manners this morning we look here in isaiah i want to move forward my brothers and sisters as we would look here as we see this line in the storyline you might say in the 23rd psalm showing us so clearly how uh god has set the stage he knows how to take care of us he knows how to lead us can i get an amen on that amen and everything he has done for us is for our goodness and and i should just touch on verse six real quick for surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life now look saints i'm going to speak real blunt to you for just a second here if you cannot right now say i say amen to verse 6 that surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life you need to find an altar because if you just had one inkling of what satan desire to do to your life amen to realize what level he could debase you if he had been given free reign what his desire to you what he wanted to do to you if you just could recognize that you would realize that surely goodness and mercy has been following you amen and for you to be able to say you know what surely goodness and mercy shall see it's not might but shall follow me all the days of my life and i come on can you put your name in there this morning and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever you have to reach out and claim that as that goes by hallelujah oh my my brother and sister how beautiful that is now we go to isaiah the ninth chapter nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebula in the land of nephthali afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations the people that walked in darkness hallelujah the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light oh hallelujah i want you now some of you might not recognize this and i'm not because it's broke here that works out perfectly for me amen i'm not going to bring this right down to you my brother and sister right at this very second but i want you to recognize the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined amen tie this right back to the 23rd psalm and you realize though the lord would lead you through the valley of the shadow of death it is not death it's merely the shadow and where there is a shadow there has to be light behind it or there would be no shadow and in that valley that place that season that time of the shadow of death god come along and says i won't even have you walking in a shadow in this valley this valley i have brought you into and don't even have a single shadow because i have come and brought a great light amen we're not here in this day this hour this season of time of history we're not here my brother and sister to be walking in his presence out of his presence in his presence out of his presence the light has come to our valley i don't care how deep your valley is you say i haven't been on a mountaintop in a long time well i want you to go back and read this scripture again and again and again because there's now light in the valley hey man you don't have to get on a mountaintop some euphoric high i got a great job i got a great wife i got great kids i drive a great car i live in a great house i go to a great church oh i'll be presumptuous got a great pastor i didn't even get an amen out of that i got a chuckle i got your attention i guess that's as good as an amen but look in this valley my brother and sister there's light i don't care how deep you think your valley is he didn't send light halfway down the mountain he didn't send light two-thirds the way down the mountain he sent light to the very floor of the valley in the very hole in the floor of the valley where you think your life has fallen in there's light there oh see upon them upon them what is it the people that's right paul walked in darkness has seen a great light paul that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death upon paul hath the light shined hallelujah come on read your name in there make it real to you well i'm just not i'm just not happy just seems like everything is such a struggle i just wished it was easier i thought that you know that god would be so good to me and everything would be a picnic you know what happens when you eat too many picnics i don't even need to tell you amen they're cold carbs you know what carbs is called empty worship praise with no content song with no spirit soul with no foundation the picnic as i was thinking about this this morning hopefully you're not all shocked sitting in my office i just turned the computer on and i went over and i typed in lyrics to a certain song and as i was looking for the words of that song never did find him there was another song there so i clicked on it and there it was probably 5 000 people big coliseum the camera is moving then it got darker and darker and then the blue lights and the red lights and the orange lights and the yellow lights started moving and the first thing on the video was this shaggy-haired dog with his drumsticks you know young people you know what took me back to remember what was his name elton john singing his songs playing his music until he's exhausted the sweat dripping off of him and he goes off the stage goes in and he sets down and they're like are you all right he's like i can't go any further i can't go any further i can't go any further any shaggy-haired dog and he's there and you can see out in john's face pretty soon he gets up goes out there sets down only this was a church how do we huh how do we how do we what's the word i'm searching for how do we draw the holy spirit what's the scripture say draw nigh unto me draw nigh unto me and i'll draw nigh unto you you see we don't draw the holy ghost by beating on drums or playing a certain beat we draw the holy ghost by drawing nigh unto him what is he the word we draw nigh into the word he draws nigh to us but you see in a religious spirit realm they're not actually calling on the holy ghost they're saints and then they come out there and they sing their songs and i looked at that and i thought there it is right here it's so obvious it's right out in the face of everyone it's not even hid come on not even hid it's right in their face oh my the people that walked in darkness have seen great light they dwelt in the land of the shadow of death upon them half the light shine reminds me of a lady i'm sad she didn't come back and visit she actually had a very nice spirit about her here probably a year ago come set in the service i spoke to her afterwards she said she was just so blessed so good and she said i'm so glad to see you guys had the lights on because i'm not a mushroom hallelujah well mushrooms probably do grow in the light at some point in time i guess i don't know never set out to grow a mushroom but have you ever noticed that sons and daughters of god they they like the light they like light shining on them oh those he loves he chastens well it hurts to be chastened yes but we love it we love it amen oh my let me go on the house multiply the nation and not increase the joy the joy before the according to the joy and harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil now this scripture really leaped out to me saints and i might not make it through today i thought i would but my time just flies but look at this i want you to think about this thou hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy they joy before thee according to the joy and harvest and they have joy as men rejoice when they divide the spoil but do you realize what they're actually saying there when you have a joy that's in the joy of the harvest it only lasts for a season when you have joy that is those that divide the spoil it only lasts as long as there is spoil to be divided but we as sons and daughters of god hallelujah now we're human we have good days and bad days right come on are you with me we have days that we are discouraged we have days that we are overjoyed but my brother and sister the joy of the soul the joy of the soul let me say that and get your attention the joy of the soul is not dictated according to the temporal things of this life the joy of the soul is the steadfast realization that i belong to jesus christ and he belongs to me oh that is a steadfast joy hallelujah you can be burning money like confetti you can be having health troubles you can have all kinds of things going on and when you finally stop to breathe you know praise the lord i belong to him amen i don't belong to the banking system of america i don't belong to the league of nations i don't belong to the world council of churches i don't belong to a denomination i belong to jesus christ oh hallelujah oh what it makes such a difference for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden in the staff of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of midian for every battle of the warrior oh i want you to come many warriors here this morning i want you to come i want you to enter into this scripture right here amen because you see my brother and sister every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood for this shall be with burning and fuel of fire this is not for the weak hearted this is not for the faint this is not to come and say i'm sitting down my valley is just clear full of shadows i just feel like i'm lost i don't know what direction to go i'm in just a great confusion brother and sister if you feel that way just have courage to step up and say lord deliver me you don't have to take a position i'm not worthy i'm not this i'm not that just stand up and say lord deliver me of this spirit because your word said this valley has light in it it's no longer a valley of a shadow of death it's a valley full of light that's what will separate you and i my brother and sister from the average person out here this says well i believe the lord but i'm going through a hard time separate those i am in the lord period what's in this valley has nothing to do with who i am amen because the word said there's light in my valley hallelujah oh hallelujah amen for every battle of the warriors with confused noise and garments rolled in blood this shall be with burning and fuel of fire now you know where i'm at on scripture all of that confusion all of that struggle all of that and isaiah under a spirit of prophecy comes and shows you where he's coming from for unto the church a child is born unto the church a son is given did god leave it that vague unto us unto us amen there was a little fellowship going on there unto us unto us amen not not out there unto us amen a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder amen i don't have to worry about my rulership now his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his leadership you realize you read that take it back to the roots of the increase of his leadership see you can have government that doesn't have leadership think natural united states the year 2020 you can have government with no leadership but look what he's speaking here of the increase of his government leadership and peace there shall be no wind amen at the direction united states is going right now you guys have all played jungle you know what i'm talking about the little wood blocks that are crisscrossed and you sit there and you pull one out here and your opponent pulls one out here and you pull one out here and you pull one out there you pull one out over here and pretty soon there's nowhere to go but down because it comes to the place there's no other little jungle stick to pull out and you know i've i used to like to play that until even my grandkids and others would whip me time after time i gave up because you see it comes to a time that this scripture must be fulfilled wouldn't it be easier just to stop and say let's our government no one do nothing say nothing nothing else happen but you can't the spirit of the age prophecy of the word says the next play must be played and you start tugging and it wobbles try another one tug wobbles pretty soon there's nothing you can do but pull it out and watch it fall hallelujah had no idea jungle was a spiritual thing was did you it is it types it types spiritual things perfectly hallelujah it's a game of tearing down not building up but the scripture prophecy for this world my brother and sister removes everything until the prophecy comes to pass of the increase of his government peace there shall be no end never stop upon the throne of david upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this oh hallelujah i'll tell you i just felt like the lord was just kind of kind to me and that just reached out as i was studying this it just reached out and grabbed me the zeal you know saints i shared with the young people a little bit about music and how it affects people and whatnot but i i can just relate to you as a young man i was just totally zealous about riding a dirt bike i was serious i i had bodily injury i had different things you'd think man you're crazy you know dislocated ankles and knees and elbows and shoulders and broken collar bones and all of this stuff and as soon as you're healthy go do it again so you know i i think i understand what it is to be zealous about something and so you look at this and realize my brother and sister the uh definition amen webster online a strong feeling of interest and enthusiasm for makes someone very eager or determined to do something eagerness and ardent interest in pursuit of something fervor fervor amen synonym passion you know how much god wants you to make the rapture can anybody give me an idea amen we don't even have a way to measure it amen what we would measure as zeal what we would look at and say oh the passion they talked about the passion of christ they made a movie about it we as human in our element don't even know the zeal of god we don't know the passion of god we can't understand we can't think in that broad of terms amen so all that is brought out in this prophecy of our lord jesus christ amen when that anointing come he closed it out the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this oh i'll tell you what my brother and sister how much we could just put it in our human terms amen how much the zeal of god would come down it would stir your heart it would turn your life upside down it would remove obstacles it would want god wants you to go another direction he locks the door how many have been there before amen there was a time of my life i wanted to be right i wanted to do the things of god but i didn't quite have the willpower poor sister jerry had to live with me in that season and i can tell you it wasn't a very happy time in the household but i'll tell you what god did because i wouldn't listen to him he just simply locked the door blew up the bridges and i come to the bridge and it's nothing but smoldering ashes and i'm like well i got a choice now i guess i have to go this way or this way i start to go this way i can't get the door open i guess i'll go this way you know my brother and sister i'll tell you i didn't stop and think lord what is your will thy will be done i was just going i was just going going going going going faster the better partly because you see i didn't want to look back at what i'd left behind me that's called carnage so i just ran forward but they that weighed upon the lord shall do what renew their strength don't run to your weary don't run until you've collapsed don't run until there's not an open door and not hardly a bit of life left in you and then you say oh lord why stop wait on the lord if the door's locked stop and say lord is the door locked forever or is it locked for a season or a reason lord the bridge just burnt down lord i'm going to believe that you either want me to build a bridge by your word and that was satan or i want you to reveal to me lord it was you telling me not to go there hallelujah well brother paul i i bought a brand new car and now i can't make the payments will someone help me make the payments i've had brothers come to me before that brother paul i did this i can't pay my credit card now will you help me i helped him but i turned the tables on him i said paul's not going to help you because you're not going to pay paul back but the church will loan you money well i'm borrowing it from the church no no i couldn't do that brother are you telling me that you never planned on paying me back well uh i i i just couldn't do that to the church well how about the church just give you the money so you don't have to become a thief oh i do that come on somebody's out of the will of god you know why they're walking in shadows one moment they're compelled i need to go to church i need to get my family right i need to do this i need to do that next they're in the shadow doesn't matter i'll tell them i'm sorry reminds me i say this in humor reminds me one time my dad loaned a man money i'm hesitant to use the word brother because of behavior patterns but my dad man money once then the man come like two three years later he's moving back east and it had to be on his mind because my daddy never mentioned a word ever about it to no one he comes knocks on the door i happen to be there my dad invites him in and they chit chat for a while and find out the brother says well we're moving back east and um i just want you to know david that um i don't have any money to give you and i didn't really plan on giving you any money but i just want you to know that i'll owe it to you because they don't want to rip you off to this moment right now well i've been married for 37 years so this got to be 40 plus years ago never gave a dime to my mama significant amount of money the man pastors the church now hallelujah oh i can show you guys some quotes if you think brother paul's been kind of harsh lately prophet of god rips into it says god will hold you accountable preacher if you don't tell them the truth and warn them what kind of spirit you want leading you hallelujah i've got a beautiful t-bone here for you i'm going to sear it on both sides and the center is going to be raw and full of magnets and i can tell you i gave you a t-bone no sir feed me something real bring it to me in honesty bring it to me in integrity not just so you can say you did it now you see the zeal of the lord of hosts my brother and sister what is the zeal god's desire lord thy will be done the zeal titus 2 14 let's just give a little reference there who gave himself for us talking for our lord jesus christ that he might redeem us from all iniquity not most inequity not some iniquity not the iniquity we want to get rid of all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works their whole desire their motivation what grips them oh hallelujah can i emphasize this enough a strong feeling of interest and enthusiasm that makes someone very eager and determined to do good works but yet we're not talking works gospel right but the gospel in you will bring about good works hallelujah oh come on we're preaching about light in the valley saints we're talking about down in the where the dry ditches were according to scripture we're down amen where the amalekites and the midianites and everybody else hung out and you can live in laodicea and do good works well i don't need an excuse about how the lord knows my heart why don't your heart show on the outside because the scripture says from the abundance of your heart you speak amen now i'm being presumptuous okay just forgive me here but if you can from the abundance of your heart speak then i believe it's possible from the abundance of your heart to live but i make mistakes yeah there was only one perfect one hallelujah but what is the heart doing amen the heart always takes you back to an altar the heart always takes you back to the light the heart draws you into the presence of god can someone say thank you lord the heart my brother and sister because the word is in our heart he wrote it on the table of our heart hallelujah so i don't have to have a book i don't have to have nothing he wrote it on the table of my heart and if you end up in a prison somewhere you know i just uh some brothers well you know some some people have just unique ideas and it could be true i don't know i'm not speaking down on them but we got some brothers around the message that think one of them uh you know camps that they fenced in areas they found way up in the wilderness in in alaska is is for us yeah yeah that's they're going to hurt us all together and they're going to haul us up in the middle of the wilderness throw us in one of those camps okay it's not what the word says not what the prophet said that's right when this life is over i'm going to a camp in alaska no no amen you see you might come to that conclusion if down in the valley under that shadow it's hard to read because there's not enough light amen right what does it say step out in the light amen go till you find the light amen what does it show you then a little bit different story my brother and sister reminds me of an old grandfather he was getting quite aged had cataracts refused he said i'm too old to go do that surgery stuff i don't want to go through it and so his grandkids he would sit there and he would read stories to his grandkids and he would share this story and his grandkids oh grandpa thank you for reading but his grandkids are getting older and older they're starting to learn their alphabet and they're starting to learn words and one day his grandson gets up after grandpa's read a book to him and he goes in the kitchen to his mama is this mama what does this book really say and grandpa had to admit sweethearts ever since i held you i've just made the stories up papa bear and mama bear and the big bad wolf and the sheep and the pigs and everything because you see i couldn't read and another year goes by and grandpa's still reading stories to the kids and the kids have now come to realization grandpa just makes him up as he goes but god laid something an anointing on his grandson and he comes up to grandpa one day and he says grandpa would you go have eye surgery and he goes oh i'm too old for that he goes no you don't understand grandpa i don't need you to get eye surgery for you right i need you to get eye surgery for me because grandpa i want to know the true story amen you see saints just assuming what it meant making it up as we go amen why it's darkness you can't read in the darkness amen you know it's an old wives tale we tell our children don't read in the dark it'll make your eyes bad i tried that on aliyah here recently and she just looked at me and went you know after a while because you see as they come of age i'm going somewhere with this honestly there's a point as they come of age parents church preachers elders our children start to read for themselves but not everything's on the written page they learn to read what's right and wrong what's honest what's fair they learn to read our natures they learn to read all kinds of things amen if we've been reading out of the darkness come on church if we've been reading out of the darkness one day our children will realize we've been making up the story we're here in the light it's the valley we don't need to make it up it's real god's present god's here he's still saving he's still healing he's still delivering he's still giving the holy ghost we don't need to make up a story we don't have to come up with a fairy tale or something that would would attract them because you see sooner or later they will come to the place they can read the story for themselves and if our story and the real story don't match let's not fall into this category right here okay would you agree with me you haven't even read it yet but let's not fall into this category can you trust me hey man we don't want to fall in this category right here now we notice these things trouble comes up all at once oh the devil looked over and said uh-huh they've gone off on a tantrum i want to be in a tantrum this kind of tantrum yeah they're just out there jumping up and down shouting having a big time you know what right now is my time to think them i'll get even with them now so he raised up over the hill and began to blow his poisonous breath days of miracles has passed after all i believe these people are just nervous i think they ought to have a mental test before they go to the foreign fields remember the prophet of god met them young people over in africa they'd been there for months and led a single person to the lord go look it up see what the prophet of god said about it he said you ought not even be there unless you've got the holy ghost don't even go and play on that field because it's a rough playing field yeah gospel rugby hallelujah in an age where more and more people are out there in their creased pants and their little polo shirt hitting a golf ball no no slight to anyone who plays golf but we're talking in the age of that you've still got these people that play rugby sister jerry's got a cousin jeff quite good went on to coach or is coaching a rugby team that's traveled the world because of their abilities but jeff has scars his one lips all mangled right here what happened oh i dove on a ball and got cleated oh wow did you have to go to the hospital for that no i finished the game wow why would you do that what do you mean we were winning what's his scar here what's this car pull up his shirt big scar on his back what happened there well this is what happened there wow why did you do that i love it contrary to the guy with the creased this just doesn't feel right put mr rugby and mr golfer in the same room see who comes out we're in warfare hallelujah we're not here this doesn't feel right we're here i don't care i'm winning oh excuse me i'm off on a tangent now hey they've gone off on a tantrum jumping up and down shouting having a big time you know what right now is my time to sink them i'll i'll get even with them now so he raised up over the hill and began to blow his poisoned breath whoo the days of miracles has passed after all believe these people are just nervous i think they ought to have a mental test before they take the foreign fields pentecostals uh-huh see his poison breath killing the word oh i think it's something else i believe it see going right straight back like all the rest of the denominations did just exactly the road they're walking now it kills it the very hour you organize it that kills it it always has it always will it will never rise again amen now saints you know i just reading this morning now pardon me that somebody will probably not like this but sorry uh you know the prophet of god as i was reading there and uh church ages and he says now let me put in a word for my ministry well that must have been a turn off to a lot of people here he is taught in his deal but you see my brother and sister the prophet of god many times said you know i don't have a ministry jesus christ has got a ministry amen so let me just put a word in for my ministry amen that you will look here and my brother and sister as long as i have breath in my body and you have confidence in me this church will never take the path where it falls down and never rises again you can drag my carcass out throw it in the parking lot you can do whatever you can silence my voice you can bring gorilla tape and gorilla glue but as long as i've got lungs and i've got a voice i will not allow this church to go the route we become dead hallelujah amen but the spirit's there it wants us to become dead it wants to subdue us it wants to hog tie us but my brother and sister someone's going to stand up but let's just go beyond that because what prophet of god is talking about nicolaitan spirits he's talking about how my brother and sister that the nicole attender ministry leadership conquered the laity the people but look i want to remind you this just a reminder that the people won't be conquered unless they allow it as long as the people are in the word seven days a week amen and they've risen up into that plateau as it were not plateau but that mountaintop where they're in the word the word is in them it's life you will never be conquered by a nicolaitan spirit because you will look at that and say that doesn't line up i can't accept that amen but it's when the people lay down but did you know i want to give equal blame where equal blame is due that it's actually the people who conquer themselves because did you know when that first little weed of that spirit stuck its head up we had a choice to root it out or be kind because the prophet of god said we needed unity so i'm going to have unity with this thistle i'm going to have unity with this wolf because i read in the scripture at one point the wolf's going to lay down with the lamb and we're just working on bringing that together okay i'm over my grumpiness we'll move on it'll never rise again it's never been known in history in this lasting church age christ was on the outside of the church knocking trying to get in they just can't stand it they can't listen to it so you know what if they don't want to listen to it they'll first try to get you to change your vocabulary my that was pointed paul see they just can't stand it can't listen to it now we find the hour we're living trouble is set in and then we begin to find out miracles isn't taking place no more like they were come on that's right i'm not preaching down to you church this is what we don't want to become this is what we are becoming the anti-type of right the opposite of make sure i make clarity there the miracles isn't taking place no more like they were the six go home sick it isn't because of god now i've heard people around what we believe well you know god's just not moving like he said no i'm sorry i hold this quote up in defense of that amen it isn't because of god it's because of the lack of revival among the people there is no revival now i hope this isn't any of you they sit and listen and go home and say well i guess that was pretty good uh-huh now if you've done that or maybe you're even doing it right now repent amen well god's not really moving i'm just not really having an interest to go to church because god's not really moving and the pastor is to blame hallelujah the pastors to blame i'll be along with my breaching tool and come to your house see you this afternoon if i'm to blame because you see i want to fix what i'm not doing right in your house hallelujah and i've got a big old dump trailer so all i got to do is get it out the door throw it in there if i'm to blame oh come on saints someone smile at me please wait ain't nobody to blame for the condition of this house but the operator or owner of this house yeah i quit serving god because the pastor of that church i went to really what a cough out amen what a cough out you wouldn't let the pastor come and fix it why would you blame him for it amen praise the lord i'm a great fixer honest at least i'm good at starting projects the six go home sick it isn't because of god it's because of the lack of revival among people there's no revival they sit and listen go home and say well i guess that was pretty good see they're not even confirmed it was good or bad i want to use this as a lead-in to what the lord i think is laid on my heart for this next sunday well i guess it's pretty good you see they're not committed they're not hot that was good they're not cold it was a waste of my time there lukewarm anyway i know it's hard in a message church to talk about three kinds of believers i guess that was pretty good uh-huh see there's not that zeal as we leave church today the brothers will meet you in the hallway and we have six cc's of zeal for each one of you it stings a little bit as it goes in your left arm but you'll appreciate it later don't you wish it was that easy brothers preachers don't you wish to is that easy i i cringe at a needle but i could get used to it to give somebody a little zeal hallelujah you know yeah you think there's something wrong with me you know back when i worked on a cattle ranch i got injected with just about everything we injected cattle they jerk their heads they jump and bash around the chute next thing and go i've just been dewormed oh no now i don't have to worry about getting black leg oh i don't have to worry about getting wooden tongue huh brother ivan would you prepare the tray and the needles see there's not that zeal there's not something in the people that should be there sister emmy so i'll quit preaching halfway on time here would you come hallelujah look saints my personal desire that's all i can speak of is the lord i want to be zealous i want to be on fire for you but only you can speak those words but i can assure you if you will allow it you'll find there's a lot of light in the valley you don't have to be lukewarm you don't have to let one single thing be a barrier to your life do you realize satan now the prophet of god said satan will kick he'll he'll put logs and rocks and sticks and all kinds of things in your pathway to get you to stumble the only way you'll stumble over those is if you decide there's not enough light in your valley in other words saints almost say one last blunt statement and then we're going to sing a few songs you will decide whether you want to be zealous or not i don't care what your excuses [Music] the same amount of energy physical and mental it takes to decide there's a discouragement and obstacle in your life the same amount of physical and mental energy will decide that you can speak up and say that won't stop me it's all comes down that simple how much light is in the valley more than enough for us to walk the length and the breath of the valley amen don't tell god amen this isn't a quarrel between paul and you this is not a quarrel between you and the message are you and the prophet this is a quarrel between you and the devil will i or won't i can i or can't i do i want to or not make up your mind make up your mind the lights here in the valley it's right here sufficient to walk and to finish the race you see saints we're coming down you say brother paul you sure been preaching kind of direct these things lately yeah because i can see the finish line i'm going to see the finish line sayings do you know i just watch the clip i like road racing i like anything with big motors and speed actually be honest with you formula cars gp bikes dirt bikes you know whatever it doesn't matter to me hopped up dune buggies i like all of that kind of stuff [Music] amen do you know here recently one of these gp road races the guy's three curves from the end boom there goes his front tire car swerves over smacks off the wall but it doesn't destroy it and they clocked him on the final stretch to the finish line going like 160 miles an hour on the rim afterwards they said wasn't that a little dangerous he said are you kidding all i could see was the finish line hallelujah i don't care if you're driving on your rims finish line's right here amen there's enough light finish the race press forward to the mark of the high call in christ jesus don't let nothing stop you if the devil throws a log down in front of you climb over it if you can't climb over it burrow under it just don't stop because the light has come to our valley and there's nothing here to hinder us hallelujah god bless you saints let's not become the people brother branham was talking about right here let's be the people that the sick go home heal let's be the people that has a revival amongst us let's be the people that don't say that was pretty good you can be honest look listen can we have a moment honesty [Music] it's okay if you say i didn't get a clue what brother paul preached about today but lord if it was for me please let it be for me let me let me receive whatever it was he wandered on both sides of his topic and got sidetracked and i just got lost lord forgive me but if it was for me i'm here lord i just receive it don't judge what god's doing for you by the man behind this pulpit don't judge by the person down the pew from you or the one in the back don't judge by those things saints judge by opening yourself and saying lord speak to me there's light lord you promised i read the scriptures today that brother paul brought there's light in my valley oh hallelujah claim that light receive that light hallelujah after all if i could get you in the rapture poof you'd all be gone but you have to decide that now i want you to just look right here in luke i'm not even going to read it here but just real quick luke 1 67 through 80. amen these scriptures are talking about the prophet john and all that god promised as god is speaking forth zacharias filled with the holy ghost starts to prophesy amen oh let's go to verse 74 just to shorten this up that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear amen that's what god's calling us to do serve him without any kind of fear the fear of help or the fear of being lost or the fear of whatever satan would try to anoint you with no fear to serve him without fear in holiness oh he puts a quantifier on that it's not just serving him in a way but to serve him in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life 23rd psalm may i dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life do you know when we get to heaven if they ever open the record book you know what they're going to find find paul a little farmer boy born right here in the city of nampa in the hospital my family farmed out in oregon [Music] wandered around through life turned into a little rebellious kid my parents come to the message i knew something was there there was something that touched my life 15 or 16 i walked away from the lord ultimately i live i go i wander all over the southwest i did what i wanted to do lived in my pickup i was a ski bum i was just all kinds praise the lord this hand of mercy i never fell too far because i was like that little dog on the end of the chain can't pull the stake up can't get any further god calls me back i marry a lovely woman young girl 17 years old made a decision she'd trust me i wasn't trustworthy [Music] 35 years old god starts to deal with my life things start to happen but not all of that was good because you see i was rebellious and when god said i want you to do this i said i ain't doing that and life got worse [Music] one day light came to my valley it didn't matter that this brother had light in his valley and sister had light in their valley but one day light came to my valley oh can someone say thank you lord [Music] anyway back to the book you know what you're going to find when you look in the book hallelujah is it all right to act like a little pentecostal here hallelujah all you're gonna find in that book is he served me all the days of his life there's no dark stain there's no ugliness there's no record there's nothing there he says he was my son from the beginning to the end but there is no end so he's been my son for eternity oh hallelujah eternity saints that's what the book says oh we've got something something to give light to them that sit in darkness in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my i got more scripture and i've got more quotes one more quote can i read one more quote i'm telling you the truth i shrunk the plate down it looks like a dime oh hallelujah hallelujah just the title alone ought to get us excited now here's one thing that i've found the people [Music] what does this say living faith see you can't get living faith from dead letter and living faith will not produce dead letter but here's one thing that i found the people with a living faith but they have absolutely caught a hold of something god out there that gives them a new birth that puts god into the person now that's difficult one right there my brother and sister because if people don't have an understanding of the godhead they're going to take the holy ghost and put him right out here and put him in a position and put him in a position put him position and when the prophet of god come along and said now it wasn't the first person and it wasn't the second person it wasn't the third person it was god himself some people go hmm that can't be right but you see [Music] they miss this part that puts god into the purpose no no brother paul that's the holy ghost go see what the prophet god said he said it's all god whatever office he is there in morphe he puts on the mask he changes the mask he's in the play he comes in a different way in a different season in a different time it's all god hallelujah oh god amen that makes him that puts god into the person that makes him hmm maketh maketh huh you realize same word this extended all those english people all you people understand that you know you ones that can write out what a noun and pronoun an adjective amen i was in school i told the teacher i understand what being an agitator is she said not an agitator paul an adjective [Music] gives him a new birth that puts god in the person makes him believe in the supernatural now if you're not born again you do not believe in the supernatural and if you do not believe in the supernatural you haven't been born again that's boy that's i think he made his point because when you're born again you become a son of god and he will being a son of god your nature of god now saints if any of you got a buzz saw nature here today come on i'm not stepping on your toes i step between your toes that means i got really close to you if i stood between your toes if you got a buzz saw in nature here today don't let the devil fool you that everything's okay that you can have the holy ghost and a buzz saw nature come on saints i love you i'm not speaking ill of you just recognize if you got a buzz on nature that you got something to work on you got something to go to the altar and say god take this away from me [Music] and he will being a son of god your nature of god and then you take on the things and you want to see the moving of god see god move because you're his son and you're made in his image and you're born of his spirit you're a part of him oh this last line i read all of that to get down to this last line and those of you that skipped ahead i don't know how to stop you from doing that amen and then you've got faith for anything not faith for just a toothache not just faith for this not just faith faith for anything look i don't care what you face in your life when the light has come to the valley and god has revealed himself completely in your darkest hour in the deepest hole that you can dig for your life god comes right down in that my brother and sister he gives you a living word amen he was the living word is the bible not say that he is the living word amen when you are filled with a living word then you'll have faith for anything then why would you have fear why would you be discouraged why would you give up just stand on the word claim the light walk in the light confess the light is there even if you don't feel like it's there confess it's there hallelujah let's stand amen you know this might seem ironic but a song that was on my heart early this morning was walk in the light hallelujah amen i love you saints and sometimes i feel like apologizing for preaching too long but look i'm going to put a quantifier on here remember i'm i'm you get discouraged about how long brother paul preaches i just want you to remember we could have an evening service i'm saving you the gas amen hallelujah i say that not to be funny but look we got a time we got a moment to give to the lord we give 40-plus amen those of you have a part-time job you give 40-plus hours a week amen those of you have a full-time job you give 50 60 70 80 hours a week to work for a nicer car it's your house and i said this and i said that come on saints we've got time to give to the lord [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] around us [Music] jesus [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah light of the world we'll walk in the light of your day [Music] a mercy us by day and by night jesus the light of the world [Music] jesus the world oh lord [Music] [Music] [Music] oh jesus the light of the world oh why not see him today for jesus [Music] [Music] oh jesus [Music] shine on around [Music] us [Music] jesus [Music] of heaven will oh reign [Music] [Music] shine on for jesus hallelujah hallelujah saints just pray i say this in a serious note i'd like to be more concise i'd like to be able to condense this down but i say this in all seriousness i gave you the short version of what i've studied this last week you see there's another 25 or 30 scriptures maybe more but 25 or 30 that come across there's 40 or 50 quotes that actually expand what we're speaking of you see all we have is a snapshot [Music] but you have the holy ghost and he said i will lead you and guide you into all truth hallelujah i'm just here with the stir stick stirring up your pure minds to be reminded of who you are and what god is doing and what he's promised you hallelujah well these are the days of elijah oh you can sing it up there brother jay is telling me now the song we'll sing in a minute he's like now you tell sister emmy that's a b-flat and i said i won't need to tell her it's a b-flat whatever it is i'll flatten it hallelujah well hallelujah these are the days you got the promise of the word of the lord and we've heard the voice [Music] these are days of great trials of famine and darkness beholding is and we've seen the words and these are the days of your servant the elijah of hallelujah and these are the days of the harvest the fields in your world of the lord behold he comes it's a year of jubilee there's no god like there's if all these are the days of elijah all declaring the word of the lord and all these are days of great trials your voice it's here on jubilee how does zion's health salvation come there's no god like jehovah there's no problem shining like the sun and his salvation hallelujah hallelujah look i'm sorry i just feel anointed the year of jubilee i spoke to you earlier saints it's decision time the year of jubilee the post [Music] you either chose to be free or you chose to go over to that post [Music] and they put your ear on it and they drove an awl through your ear now i want to ask you why would anyone choose to put their ear to the post you say oh brother paul it's hard to serve god when you stand up and say i don't care by god's grace i'm free and he who has been set free is free indeed and if he set me free then nothing could ever put me back in bondage when i've made the decision to be free i'll tell you what you're gonna have to run fast to catch me i'm not gonna stand anywhere close to us a man with a with a mallet and an awl and a post come over here and worship with us come on we've been around forever we've got a program just put your security in us i'm sorry i put my security jesus christ and he said i'm free amen you know what i'm going to do i'll tell you what saints i'm sorry but i've just got this some people might want to be born i'll tell you what i might not have great courage but i'll tell you what i'm going to be i'm going to be like gideon and i'm going to come back maybe in the middle of the night because i don't have courage to do in the daytime and i'm going to go out there where that post is at [Music] this hard harder than i thought it would [Music] be and somebody's going to come and say that brother paul saw down my post yeah praise the lord and if you ain't careful i'll drag it off the next night and burn it for firewood because i'm not going to be bound i'm not going to go back i'm not going to let them try that yoke of bondage on me again my brother and sister there's spirits in the world you want to have fun i've said this for years and i say it in sincerity if you want to just have good church become a mormon they got a program for everything and their own welfare system you want to have a ton of fun shout and sing kick off your high heels and race through the church become a pentecostal if you want to be free don't go try that yokon because somebody will come along and slap that thing on you lock it down again and then you'll find yourself standing one day saying how did i how did i get this hole in my ear what happened what happened was like that little girl that got delivered and she stopped at the door of that dance hall [Music] and the devil come and says don't you remember when you had so much fun when you were so free [Music] what'd she do she went to a realm of vain imagination which the lie she'd been delivered from she turned it back into truth and said yes i did have so much fun what did she tell the prophet you know what i'm talking about she said in the next thing i know i found myself inside dancing in the arms of some man denominational spirit my brother and sister trying to woo us all back come back to the security come back to what you are i am going back to what i am hallelujah oh hallelujah i'm sorry saints i'm just keeping you longer and longer but there's one thing i i do want i'm sorry we'll sing that other song

happy we used the knife and the fork some of you one day you learn god gave you these fingers to eat that chicken with there's nothing stranger i'm sorry i just feel good this morning but there's nothing stranger than watching people eat pizza with a knife and a fork and there's nothing stranger than watching people eat fried chicken with a knife and a fork amen there's a reason god gave you this hallelujah and i'm looking forward to that day on the other side when the real you come out and i see some of you running up and down the streets of glory jumping shouting hallelujah singing to

anything in my name and i'll give it to you you got needs in your lives circumstances ask ask believe the word confess it just say lord i have these needs i have this circumstance you know i'm going to say something here hopefully it doesn't offend anyone from time to time brother paul has unspoken prayer requests [Music] do you know most of the time those prayer requests are for an individual right here in these four walls they're not far off and they're not even my need i just wanna i'm gonna be blunt with you i look out as time goes on i take this shepherd stuff way more serious than i used to if you notice you've got a sheep that likes to walk the fence the grass is three feet tall over here but they're walking the fence and they go and they come back and they go and they come back lord help that sheep [Music] help that sheep lord help him to find joy in the midst of the pasture in the midst of what god has given in this day we don't need to walk offense i say oh if we're going to have fun let's go be mormons if we're going to be this go do that saints there's no need for us to go the pasture it's a big pasture and it's full of everything we need and when i see some start to walk the fence i'll be blunt my heart starts to break i start to cry out god come lord pull them but you see i'm trying to break my habit of using examples but it would be like coming and saying you need something sister nadia and dragging her no it doesn't work saints if there's a need in the body we lift it up before god lord move them back to the center of your will into your pasture lord saints we need to care that much about each other we need to look out the prophet of god goes on going with my notes today the prophet of god goes on we've lost our zeal for lost souls we've lost our zeal for getting people to christ well if that's what they believe we're just oh my brother and sister maybe you can't touch them you can't reach them you can't talk to them but you can pray for them amen lift one another up in prayer i love you god bless you just just stand firm on the word look satan like a roaring lion whispers sometimes he likes to come whisper in our ear well i tell you what you just listen to the word let the word dictate your life let the word give you guidance and direction god bless you before i preach part two amen well won't we have a time won't i have the time [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
