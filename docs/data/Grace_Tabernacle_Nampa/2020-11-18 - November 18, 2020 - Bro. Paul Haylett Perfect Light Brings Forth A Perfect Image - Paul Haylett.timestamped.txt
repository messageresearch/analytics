[34:54] Hallelujah ain't that
[34:56] beautiful amen
[34:58] well you know so many things sometimes
[35:00] we kind of forget lose track and I I'm
[35:03] certainly one of the worst that there is
[35:05] about kind of forgetting the
[35:08] everyday things of life that maybe we
[35:10] should
[35:11] remember things like my wife's birthday
[35:14] and anniversary and stuff like that um
[35:18] kind of but uh I think it's just
[35:20] beautiful and the reason I say some of
[35:22] that is cuz I can't remember even the
[35:24] days they got married on and my wife
[35:25] didn't clue me in but I just want to say
[35:27] say to brother vasil and sister Tamara
[35:30] happy
[35:31] anniversary amen my a year can just
[35:36] disappear well I guess it was fast Amen
[35:41] brother Ivan sister Nadia God bless you
[35:45] amen what is this is this number five
[35:48] number five it doesn't seem like five
[35:51] years ago that we missed a flight and
[35:54] ended up in London and lost our
[35:56] suitcases here and ended up there and
[35:59] whatever but it's it's been a beautiful
[36:01] 5 years and yeah we thank the Lord for
[36:04] that and amen I had a lovely
[36:07] conversation today with sister aona she
[36:10] called me and um it was just beautiful I
[36:14] actually kind of had to just set my jaw
[36:16] so I wouldn't cry and and uh whatnot but
[36:19] she was just just thanking you church
[36:22] for your prayers for your support for
[36:25] your
[36:25] encouragement um she she did share and
[36:29] as you well know that uh this last year
[36:32] has been a very very difficult year for
[36:34] them and uh uh she she expressed that
[36:38] she believed that uh it was your prayers
[36:41] that carried her through this last year
[36:43] so uh certainly we want to remember them
[36:46] they're hoping uh that uh sister kche
[36:49] expressed that she hopes that uh her
[36:51] recovery is such that they can come see
[36:54] us after the first of the year and uh so
[36:58] uh we want the Lord just to come down
[36:59] may his presence be with him and and uh
[37:03] you know I just believe that when God
[37:05] guides the hand of the surgeon amen amen
[37:09] he's the one who made this body he knows
[37:11] every nerve every fiber everything and
[37:14] so we are going to also pray for the
[37:17] surgeon amen amen that that God would
[37:20] just give him Supernatural wisdom of
[37:24] what to do and to what extent and amen
[37:27] then come right down in a healing touch
[37:29] from the Lord amen so we just give our
[37:32] greetings tonight to brother pant sister
[37:36] a conin just um pray God's blessings
[37:39] upon them amen uh I know I brought a
[37:42] little confusion I said the other day I
[37:44] wouldn't be here tonight and um I I went
[37:47] to this skin doctor and you know they
[37:50] they I'm kind of prone to Little Skin
[37:52] things and and they fried me and I
[37:54] didn't want to stand up in front of you
[37:56] with all kinds of blisters sticking out
[37:58] and but I got in there and he said you
[38:00] know what not too bad and toasted me
[38:03] just a little bit and I thought well I
[38:05] I'm just going to go ahead and preach
[38:07] tonight amen now you know sometimes we
[38:10] always just pray God's leadership of
[38:12] what to do uh in things and um this
[38:16] coming Sunday I felt led to ask our
[38:18] brother Chris uh to take this Sunday
[38:21] service uh and um just to uh bring to
[38:25] you what the Lord's laid upon his heart
[38:27] may lay Before the Throne of God and
[38:29] find the perfect will of God now in the
[38:32] past if I'm correct this coming Thursday
[38:35] is
[38:36] Thanksgiving and um we normally do not
[38:39] have a Wednesday night service and uh so
[38:42] uh we will we will see you in service or
[38:46] I will see you in service the following
[38:48] Sunday so uh God bless you and uh this
[38:54] um Sunday following that uh um our
[38:58] brother David Nash may be coming through
[39:00] town um we've discussed this a little
[39:03] bit to see and possibly our brother
[39:05] David Nash will take that Sunday service
[39:07] so uh just be praying we always want the
[39:10] Lord's will we don't want to be the
[39:13] orchestrator right we want to follow the
[39:15] leading of the Holy Spirit and and uh
[39:18] many times Saints it's amazing that
[39:21] leadership how that it it takes us we
[39:24] turn a corner we don't know why we turn
[39:25] the corner uh but God has purpose in
[39:28] that and and uh so we just look forward
[39:30] to that so uh for as for me and my wife
[39:35] sister Jerry um uh we will uh be praying
[39:39] for you this coming Sunday as we take
[39:42] this little holiday so let's just stand
[39:44] and go into the word of God today uh
[39:47] this evening and uh thank you musicians
[39:50] always appreciate the Beautiful music uh
[39:54] amen
[39:55] now my tile might not totally reflect
[39:59] the direction that we're going but it
[40:01] made sense to me and um so uh Perfect
[40:05] Light brings forth A Perfect Image now
[40:09] the scripture tells us that we look
[40:11] through a glass Darkly but you see my
[40:14] brother and sister Sons and Daughters of
[40:16] God that glass will come one day and no
[40:19] longer be dark now I'm going to kind of
[40:22] give just a little Preamble of what
[40:24] might be a future sermon thought but you
[40:27] see my brother and
[40:29] sister the word says I am God and I
[40:31] change not so God didn't come down and
[40:33] change that glass that you're looking
[40:36] through you know that he didn't come and
[40:38] say I'm going to give entirely different
[40:40] view to you than I do to you but what he
[40:43] does is he comes down and the light
[40:46] illuminates so great that the glass is
[40:49] no longer a mystery or Avail to us so
[40:53] it's all about the light it's not about
[40:55] how God gave more of this and more of
[40:57] that and disadvantage this
[41:00] person he came to the whole world the
[41:02] scripture says he gave his only begotten
[41:05] son everyone has their opportunity but
[41:08] some refuse the light some desire the
[41:12] light and those that desire the light
[41:14] the word shows us clearly that he shines
[41:16] more light so you want more light cry
[41:18] out for more light you want more faith
[41:20] cry out for more faith amen so it's
[41:23] there that the it's illuminated and then
[41:27] the glass is it were slowly loses its
[41:32] Darkness until we see him as he is and
[41:37] when we see him as he is we see
[41:40] ourselves as we are amen because we are
[41:44] in him so you can't see more of God
[41:46] without seeing more of yourself in him
[41:49] amen it's a lovely lovely I'm going to
[41:51] use the word concept okay but please
[41:53] don't take that in its actual root uh
[41:56] because it's more than a concept cep but
[41:58] it's in that you see the more you see of
[42:00] him the more you see of yourself amen
[42:03] and so it's not self retrospect that we
[42:05] look and say I'm going to find out who I
[42:08] am so that I might find God that won't
[42:10] work you have to find God to see who you
[42:13] are amen amen well just uh this evening
[42:18] I pray God would just open the word to
[42:20] us amen we're going to go to 2
[42:23] Corinthians the 4th chapter uh verses
[42:26] 1-10
[42:28] um and just
[42:30] uh our very do our very best to be
[42:33] concise tonight 2 Corinthians 4th
[42:36] chapter starting with verse one
[42:39] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[42:42] as we have received Mercy we faint not
[42:45] but have renounced the hidden things of
[42:47] dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor
[42:50] handling the word of God deceitfully but
[42:52] by manifestation of the truth commending
[42:55] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[42:58] the sight of God but if our gospel be
[43:01] hid it is hid to them that are lost in
[43:04] whom the God of this world hath blinded
[43:07] the minds of them which believe not lest
[43:10] the light of the Glorious gospel of
[43:12] Christ who is the image of God should
[43:16] shine unto them for we preach not
[43:18] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord
[43:21] ourselves your servants for jesus'
[43:24] sake for God who hath commanded the
[43:27] light to shine out of Darkness hath
[43:30] shined in our hearts yes sir oh my isn't
[43:34] that beautiful see it's not just
[43:36] somewhere in the world is this gospel
[43:38] light shining it is shining in our
[43:42] hearts I love that amen hallelujah to
[43:46] give the light of the knowledge of the
[43:50] glory of God in the face of Jesus
[43:53] Christ let's read verse six again
[43:56] because I think it's deeper than we
[43:59] recognize for God who commanded the
[44:01] light to shine out of Darkness has
[44:04] shined in our hearts to give the light
[44:08] of the knowledge amen oh look my brother
[44:10] and sister the knowledge of who our God
[44:14] is is all encapsulated and this will be
[44:18] a whole different topic we won't go
[44:19] there tonight but it is encapsulated in
[44:22] the light that knowledge is encapsulated
[44:24] in the light can I interpret that for
[44:27] for you the scripture says that we can't
[44:30] even say Jesus is the Christ without the
[44:34] Holy Ghost but man can stand almost
[44:37] anywhere on the face of the Earth and
[44:39] say Jesus is the Christ Jesus is the
[44:41] Christ but without the Holy Ghost it
[44:43] becomes just words that's right without
[44:46] the true understanding or revelation of
[44:49] what that really is they are actually
[44:52] speaking words that's right
[44:59] but we have this treasure in Earth and
[45:01] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[45:04] may be of God and not of us we are
[45:07] troubled on every side Can someone say
[45:09] Amen to that yet not distressed I say
[45:12] Amen to that we are perplexed but not in
[45:16] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[45:19] down but not
[45:21] destroyed always bearing about in the
[45:24] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[45:26] the life also of Jesus might be made
[45:29] manifest in our body amen Heavenly
[45:33] Father we ask Lord you would just father
[45:36] just seal our lips to speak your word
[45:38] and your word alone tonight and father
[45:41] not just what is right and correct but
[45:44] Lord what is needful and necessary Lord
[45:47] speak to our hearts we pray tonight for
[45:50] everyone who is not here tonight Lord
[45:53] father I pray your Holy Spirit would
[45:55] just go out and deal kindly father Lord
[45:59] reminding and strengthening and healing
[46:02] Lord encouraging father we thank you for
[46:05] the opportunity to come to the house of
[46:07] God tonight and to serve you day by day
[46:10] we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[46:13] you may be seated Saints amen you know I
[46:17] I love verse 10 as we're looking at that
[46:21] that the life also of Jesus might be
[46:24] made manifest in our body now my brother
[46:27] and sister when something is made
[46:29] manifest it is not kept in the concept
[46:32] or in a theoretical form but it actually
[46:36] becomes literal it actually becomes a
[46:39] reality so we can talk about the life of
[46:42] Jesus Christ we can talk about the
[46:44] effect of the Holy Spirit upon our life
[46:48] and if we see no reality from that CU we
[46:51] can talk about it in a conceptual form
[46:54] we can talk about it from the realm of
[46:57] knowledge where we would look at the
[46:59] scripture and be able to say yes this is
[47:01] something that is supposed to happen and
[47:04] yet we're not looking for something that
[47:06] is supposed to happen we are looking for
[47:08] what God promised and is happening amen
[47:11] and so as we see the word unfolding in
[47:15] us then we can stand firm upon the word
[47:18] of God and know that because God desired
[47:21] to manifest himself in our body that we
[47:25] can come now and and release ourself to
[47:29] trust God to perfect that now I was
[47:31] joking with brother Jason we'll get
[47:33] hopefully get to this in just a little
[47:35] bit here I was joking with him on a
[47:37] little thought tonight I made it sound
[47:39] like oh I'm looking forward to this but
[47:42] you see we are looking forward to the
[47:44] fact that God is manifesting himself in
[47:48] his bride amen now there is an image you
[47:51] know um uh uh I have a backpack and some
[47:54] stuff that uh I don't remember what what
[47:57] is that that says on that something
[47:58] about image and and you know Sharper
[48:01] Image amen and I I remember looking at
[48:03] that and when that backpack was brand
[48:05] new and sister Jerry and I have traveled
[48:07] the the uh Earth you might say with that
[48:10] backpack I've carried it through many an
[48:12] airport and whatever else and it's a
[48:14] sharp backpack or I should say was
[48:17] because you see it's traveled uh tens of
[48:20] thousands maybe even to the hundreds of
[48:21] thousands of miles and uh it's worn and
[48:24] it's torn and and the straps look like
[48:26] they're falling off of it I've even had
[48:28] people stop me in the airport and say
[48:30] sir your strap is breaking and I'm like
[48:33] it's fine but you see it no longer has a
[48:36] sharper image it looks kind of tattered
[48:40] it looks kind of rough and you see this
[48:42] image of of who we are in Jesus Christ
[48:46] is not an image that was once sharp and
[48:49] has become tattered but it is an image
[48:51] that God renews he says his mercies are
[48:54] new Every Morning amen so image of Jesus
[48:58] Christ in US is an image my brother and
[49:01] sister that is not going to fade away it
[49:03] is not going to be an image of what we
[49:06] used to be but it is what we are today
[49:09] and I thank God for that and you know an
[49:12] image my brother and sister as we were
[49:14] speaking uh last Wednesday on reflection
[49:17] a an image it takes an image to have a
[49:20] reflection and so I say today Lord let
[49:23] us see who we are in you that our image
[49:28] as it were that we could pray for and
[49:30] press into will be a perfect reflection
[49:33] of Jesus Christ now the word says here
[49:35] in verse four in whom the God of this
[49:38] world hath blinded the minds of them
[49:42] which believe not lest the light of the
[49:44] Glorious gospel of Christ which uh who
[49:47] is the image of God should shine unto
[49:49] them I want to ask you a question
[49:52] tonight now this would be a uh kind of
[49:56] in a little bit of an arbitrary question
[49:58] but I want to ask you tonight how do you
[50:00] know that you're not
[50:08] blinded how did you know that the God of
[50:12] this world has not blinded
[50:15] you it's not a trick question it's
[50:18] actually intended for us to let our
[50:21] minds be
[50:22] stirred of what is the evidence of Who
[50:26] We Are
[50:27] in Jesus Christ not that we just have
[50:30] words you see it's easy to speak
[50:34] words but for us to have confidence in
[50:38] who we are and what God is doing in us
[50:41] we should know what the evidence is that
[50:43] we are not
[50:45] blinded we don't want to be my brother
[50:47] and sister those people who blindly
[50:49] follow I remember this years ago and I
[50:51] I'm not going in a negative Direction so
[50:53] please don't don't uh think I am but I
[50:55] remember years ago that people uh that
[50:57] had come into the message when I was a
[50:59] young man they they were in the church
[51:01] and then you know the ministry there and
[51:04] we tend to get in ruts if we are not
[51:05] careful and the ministry there preached
[51:07] down a certain little vein and and
[51:09] that's kind of the direction they always
[51:11] preached on and this other Ministry come
[51:13] in and and they made statements and
[51:15] these people were like I don't believe
[51:17] that that isn't what we believe that guy
[51:20] just give us faults no no there it is
[51:23] that's as much of the message as
[51:24] anything else and these people were like
[51:26] I I'm I'm not going to deal with that
[51:28] and basically got up and left you see no
[51:31] one had ever brought them to a place to
[51:33] challenge them to look into the word far
[51:36] enough to know what it was they really
[51:39] belied and why they believed it so that
[51:42] is key element as much as it is that we
[51:45] believe God sent a prophet and Malachi 4
[51:47] will be fulfilled and Revelations 22
[51:50] will be fulfilled uh my brother and
[51:52] sister is to know that we have not been
[51:55] blinded
[51:58] amen now because that's not really the
[52:00] gist of my sermon tonight I I I won't go
[52:04] into this in depth but how do we know
[52:07] that we are not blinded you see it won't
[52:09] be by our confession
[52:12] only confession only my brother and
[52:14] sister will not hold us but it's
[52:20] necessary it's not by saying amen I've
[52:23] had people look me in the face and say
[52:25] you can't tell me that that I say Amen
[52:27] to every word of God and then argue with
[52:30] you what the word
[52:32] meant so saying
[52:35] amen is not the evidence that we haven't
[52:38] been
[52:39] blinded but every son or daughter of God
[52:42] the prophet of God said will say Amen to
[52:44] every word of God yeah amen so it's part
[52:47] of it amen but we have this very clear
[52:51] evidence that we can look at the
[52:54] life and this will lead in if God would
[52:57] be merciful to me to hurry through
[52:59] tonight this will lead in but you see
[53:01] it's the life my brother and sister you
[53:04] see the
[53:06] light and you press into it amen yes you
[53:10] don't just acknowledge there's light you
[53:13] see light you press into it and when
[53:16] we'll look at some of these quotes that
[53:18] we'll come across here in just a little
[53:19] bit you'll realize that in pressing into
[53:22] that you have opened yourself up or
[53:25] given as it were God complete
[53:28] permission to do what is necessary in
[53:32] your
[53:32] life yes you know what I'd rather see
[53:35] than someone that says Amen to every
[53:37] word of God can quote the message and do
[53:39] all these things I'd rather see people
[53:41] that would be so open and surrendered to
[53:43] God that they literally say Lord
[53:45] whatever you want to do to me here I am
[53:48] I believe your word so much and I trust
[53:50] you so much just do Lord as you would
[53:54] amen Jesus himself you want to know the
[53:57] foundation he said Lord not my will but
[54:01] thy will be done what was that a
[54:03] complete surrendering that what was
[54:05] necessary and God said what is necessary
[54:08] is that you go to the cross and you give
[54:11] your life do you think that man that we
[54:15] call Jesus Christ wanted to go and
[54:18] suffer no he did not but because he
[54:22] recognized the necessity of him
[54:25] suffering he recognized that this was
[54:28] needful to be done he surrendered
[54:30] himself to the will of God and my
[54:33] brother and sister the prophet of God
[54:35] clearly says in several places
[54:36] throughout the message that God will
[54:38] never lead you away away from his word
[54:41] that's right so when we come and we
[54:44] surrender ourself to the word then we
[54:47] are signing up for God to do what God
[54:50] deemed
[54:52] necessary but the problem is often times
[54:54] what God deemed necessary are flesh does
[54:56] not like that's exactly right amen you
[54:59] see to bring it down simply the life
[55:04] will produce a
[55:05] life amen amen it's not so much there's
[55:09] other quotes I could quote of Spurgeon
[55:11] and Tozer and and some of those others
[55:14] Through The Years Wiggles were uh
[55:16] wonderful quotes when you look at them
[55:18] my brother and sister but they're just
[55:20] laying the foundation of or or or
[55:22] talking of the very things of the
[55:24] foundation that's been laid for us and
[55:26] my brother and sister as we'll come to
[55:27] that we realize that you cannot I almost
[55:30] brought some seed to church tonight but
[55:32] I thought that's just so silly Paul but
[55:35] you know h a corn seed I put a corn seed
[55:38] right here and I can put a pinto bean
[55:40] seed right here my brother and sister I
[55:42] cannot plant the corn and hope to
[55:44] harvest the Pento Bean that's right amen
[55:46] or vice versa and I can't plant the
[55:49] Pento bean and expect to get a small
[55:52] white right you know what small whites
[55:55] are they're porking beans all of you
[55:57] that like pork and beans that's a small
[55:59] white bean is what they use in pork and
[56:01] beans just so you'll
[56:02] know but you can't plant that you see
[56:05] every seed brings forth of its own
[56:12] kind amen so what we're looking how do
[56:15] you know my brother and sister that you
[56:17] haven't been
[56:19] deceived because there is a life now
[56:23] sometimes that life is not something we
[56:25] stand up and be able to just glorify
[56:27] look at my life look at my life look at
[56:29] my
[56:29] life but you see there's a keeping power
[56:33] there's a holding power there's
[56:34] something that when you see the light
[56:36] you yearn to step into that light you
[56:40] learn yearn to to to walk as that light
[56:43] moves as it's moving forward you yearn
[56:46] to follow that what is that that's
[56:50] nothing short of God that's nothing
[56:52] short of the holy spirit because the uh
[56:54] God of this evil age has has many
[56:57] distractions and and I don't say this
[56:59] negatively but we fall for those
[57:01] distractions many
[57:03] times because see some of those
[57:05] distractions can be very base very
[57:07] simple not even in a sense my brother
[57:09] and sister evil but they're just simply
[57:12] a
[57:13] distraction and Satan will use
[57:19] that I want to draw this scripture here
[57:22] out of Psalms we used it last Wednesday
[57:24] and I feel like it's appropriate to put
[57:26] here once again as a reminder to us as
[57:29] in water face anth to face so the heart
[57:35] of man to man you'll see there is that
[57:39] that
[57:40] relationship that reflection as I used
[57:43] that example the other
[57:46] Wednesday I cannot look into the pool
[57:50] and get brother Trevor's
[57:52] reflection what is reflected from the
[57:54] pool is what I
[57:58] am and I think sometimes it's good
[58:01] brother brandom encourages us to look
[58:02] into the mirror of God's
[58:04] word come face to face don't Dodge it
[58:07] don't don't try to just push it off
[58:09] don't use the thing well that's not who
[58:11] I am if the nature is there of that my
[58:14] brother and sister then look at that
[58:16] reflection and say Lord deliver me from
[58:19] that or if you we take the positive sign
[58:22] if you look into that and realize that
[58:24] the very nature of that is who you you
[58:26] are becoming then get some hands up get
[58:28] some lips moving and say thank you Lord
[58:31] that I'm no longer the image of Paul
[58:33] Haled or your name in that place and
[58:36] then I I'm becoming an image of you and
[58:37] you say well brother Paul we have
[58:39] problems around our house well welcome
[58:41] to the club amen I'll tell you what that
[58:44] one thing that's been enlightening and I
[58:45] don't mean to like put brother George on
[58:47] the sideline and and focus to that but
[58:50] it's been interesting in my relationship
[58:52] as this friendship has grown through the
[58:54] years and I speaking with brother George
[58:57] and he's made statements before that uh
[59:00] the brandham household was just like any
[59:04] other
[59:05] right they didn't get up in the morning
[59:07] and they were Angels floating
[59:11] around any more than they are at your
[59:16] house
[59:21] that's well the scripture tells us that
[59:23] his angels are round about yeah
[59:26] certainly his people his
[59:30] bride amen I could preach a whole sermon
[59:33] I got some notes they're not here
[59:35] they're at home but I preach a whole
[59:36] sermon about what brother brandham says
[59:38] about God being with you in his spirit
[59:40] and how his angels are hovering and his
[59:42] Spirit hovering over the people oh my
[59:45] brother and sister we're not walking
[59:46] blindly through this world God's got his
[59:49] armed guards around us
[59:52] hallelujah so as we look at this we
[59:54] recognize now to to see this evidence of
[59:58] whether we're deceived or not is what
[1:00:02] kind of face is looking back at you in
[1:00:05] the reflection am if it is a face now I
[1:00:10] hope you follow me because we're not
[1:00:11] talking about a physical image and I
[1:00:13] think you follow me to that but the face
[1:00:16] that is looking back to you the prophet
[1:00:19] of God shows us this is scriptural but
[1:00:21] he breaks it down into the bite-sized
[1:00:23] pieces for us that a son or daughter of
[1:00:25] God is looking into the reflection and
[1:00:28] seeing Christ is quick to forgive amen
[1:00:32] and quick to ask for
[1:00:35] forgiveness will hold no ought or
[1:00:38] ill but will lift those who hurt them up
[1:00:42] before
[1:00:43] God and that list could go on but that's
[1:00:46] not our subject tonight these are the
[1:00:48] things that show us whether or not God
[1:00:50] is present in the reflection of this
[1:00:53] face because you see if we're easily
[1:00:56] offended and we're bitter and we angry
[1:00:59] that's not the reflection of
[1:01:01] Christ he loved us when we were
[1:01:06] unlovable man that's hard to do isn't
[1:01:09] it would anyone agree with me yeah it's
[1:01:14] hard to
[1:01:15] love when those that you are there and
[1:01:18] have to
[1:01:19] forgive seem
[1:01:22] unforgivable but the Holy Spirit has a
[1:01:24] way of molding and forging and changing
[1:01:29] and bringing about to
[1:01:31] manifest oh Hallelujah I don't care how
[1:01:34] much pain Saints I'm not you know I'm
[1:01:36] not callous you know I love you but I
[1:01:38] don't really care how much pain you
[1:01:40] endure in your
[1:01:46] life the question is not about the pain
[1:01:48] it's whether you're willing to change or
[1:01:50] not that's
[1:01:53] right you see we can go through
[1:01:56] heartache and trial and struggle and
[1:01:58] trouble and just get more and more and
[1:02:01] more bitter that's right or we go
[1:02:05] through that and the holy spirit moves
[1:02:07] in us and starts to mold us and bring us
[1:02:09] to this place that we find
[1:02:12] ourself looking as it were the
[1:02:14] reflection of the word and saying oh
[1:02:16] Lord help me forgive me Lord Lord Place
[1:02:19] love in my heart for that person or this
[1:02:21] situation or whatever it is you see and
[1:02:23] the reflection of who we are starts to
[1:02:25] change
[1:02:27] praise the
[1:02:28] lord well brother Paul that's so
[1:02:31] Elementary I know it's very Elementary
[1:02:35] but sometimes the simplest things are
[1:02:38] the hardest to
[1:02:42] implement
[1:02:44] Hallelujah now I just want to go here
[1:02:48] into this with kind of some lengthy
[1:02:50] quote stuff here and I hope you're okay
[1:02:52] with that tonight amen if you need to
[1:02:54] stand up and you know stretch a little
[1:02:57] bit whatever feel
[1:02:59] free therefore so many times we hear
[1:03:02] this expression oh what is a
[1:03:04] Christian some people limit it to
[1:03:07] joining a
[1:03:09] church Someone said well a Christian is
[1:03:12] a church member someone who takes up
[1:03:13] their affiliations with the church I
[1:03:16] believe that all Christians should do
[1:03:19] that amen should I read that again let
[1:03:23] me interpret it for you prophet of God
[1:03:25] is telling you you should have a church
[1:03:27] home amen we shouldn't just be so random
[1:03:30] that we go to church well not here or
[1:03:32] not there maybe over the Dell
[1:03:36] somewhere I believe all Christians
[1:03:38] should do that but I don't believe
[1:03:40] that's Christianity see that's what a
[1:03:43] Christian does after he becomes a
[1:03:45] Christian but it doesn't mean that
[1:03:47] because he does it that he is a
[1:03:50] Christian then some say no it's going to
[1:03:53] church and serving a declaration of
[1:03:55] reads and being loyal to those things in
[1:03:57] which the church teaches and then there
[1:04:00] are others that says perhaps packing a
[1:04:02] little a little something on them a
[1:04:04] little Cross or something that that is
[1:04:07] the sign of a
[1:04:12] Christian well and then there's others
[1:04:15] who believe that perhaps maybe if they
[1:04:17] would burn a candle you know Sister
[1:04:19] Jerry and I had the privilege a few
[1:04:21] years ago five years ago to be exact
[1:04:26] of going to brother Ivan and sister
[1:04:28] Nadia's wedding and then going on up
[1:04:31] into Europe and uh preaching and Belgium
[1:04:34] and whatnot and we we were taken a
[1:04:37] tour of uh oh I don't remember I might
[1:04:40] have the cities wrong but gent and um
[1:04:43] there was some other cities and they
[1:04:45] have these churches that considering
[1:04:47] they were built uh hundreds upon
[1:04:50] hundreds of years previous I don't know
[1:04:52] how they got them rocks you know 100t 50
[1:04:56] ft in the air I don't know how they
[1:04:57] built those buildings in that fashion
[1:04:59] but obviously they did and do you know
[1:05:02] Saints you ought to if you ever get an
[1:05:03] opportunity to go there you should take
[1:05:05] a recorder or your phone or something
[1:05:07] with you cuz even I sounded good singing
[1:05:09] in there it's just incredible the the
[1:05:13] the sound that is there but you know we
[1:05:16] witnessed something that struck me very
[1:05:19] deeply uh obviously this young woman was
[1:05:22] very distra and uh she comes in rushing
[1:05:26] into this building uh she's fumbling
[1:05:28] through her little purse and she finds
[1:05:31] some change and she drops it in a box
[1:05:34] and takes a candle goes over and lights
[1:05:36] it puts it down in front of a statue and
[1:05:39] gets down and starts just crying out in
[1:05:42] another language uh uh uh just in
[1:05:46] travail and I thought my if we could
[1:05:50] have the right recipe and that kind of
[1:05:53] desperation what would we do
[1:05:56] you know brother brandom talked about
[1:05:58] how that they would rub these statues so
[1:06:00] much they had to replace the hands and
[1:06:02] the feet we have witnessed that
[1:06:04] firsthand we've walked through there and
[1:06:06] looked at these statues that the hand is
[1:06:08] not even the same color it's not the
[1:06:10] same kind of rock the feet are not the
[1:06:12] same kind of rock and they're already
[1:06:14] worn smooth of people rubbing on that my
[1:06:18] brother and sister you see they don't do
[1:06:21] that out of callousness they do that in
[1:06:25] absolute
[1:06:31] sincerity perhaps maybe if you'd burn a
[1:06:34] candle or do something of a pen Penance
[1:06:37] that's a Christian if they will merely
[1:06:40] be immersed in water or they would do
[1:06:42] some sacrifice or give some good to the
[1:06:44] church or help the neighbor buy some
[1:06:47] coal for the widow or some shoes for the
[1:06:50] orphan that the axe that's the axe that
[1:06:54] a Christian should do
[1:06:56] but that still doesn't make them a
[1:06:58] Christian and then some says that if you
[1:07:01] pack an image of Christ in your car on
[1:07:04] your wall that that is a sign of a
[1:07:06] Christian well them things are all right
[1:07:09] but I don't believe that packing an
[1:07:11] image makes you a Christian I believe
[1:07:14] that being an image of Christ makes you
[1:07:18] a Christian it's not what we do
[1:07:20] outwardly it's what happened inwardly
[1:07:23] that makes us what we are amen
[1:07:28] hallelujah I tell you my brother and
[1:07:30] sister that right there which should
[1:07:32] strike right to the very home or it's
[1:07:34] not it's not what is happened external
[1:07:37] right but it's what's happened down on
[1:07:39] the inside then therefore if he is our
[1:07:45] image and we are in his likeness and
[1:07:48] members of his body we should be images
[1:07:51] like him then our lives should reflect
[1:07:54] the image of Christ not in our joining
[1:07:57] church or in our packing crucifix or our
[1:08:00] emotions but it should be in the living
[1:08:03] presence of the Living God that's
[1:08:05] reflected through your life right right
[1:08:09] I changed that didn't I yes
[1:08:13] amen because you understand the pearl of
[1:08:16] your would be our in this context that
[1:08:20] is us personally
[1:08:22] identifying not the crowd effect
[1:08:26] that's right you know there's such a
[1:08:28] thing as the crowd effect amen abolutely
[1:08:31] where people say
[1:08:35] amen because 10 20 30 or 40 said amen
[1:08:40] but they don't really know what they
[1:08:41] said amen to right the prophet of God
[1:08:44] got in a car one time with Billy Paul
[1:08:47] you'll find this in the message search
[1:08:49] for it and he asked him Billy did you
[1:08:52] understand what I said tonight and Billy
[1:08:54] said uh uh well yes I I think so dad
[1:08:59] brother brandham corrects him and says
[1:09:00] there wasn't two or three in the whole
[1:09:01] building understood what I
[1:09:04] said brother Billy Paul's own testimony
[1:09:07] was people were shouting dancing in the
[1:09:09] aisles shouting Hallelujah didn't
[1:09:13] understand what was being preached the
[1:09:16] crowd
[1:09:21] effect Church don't let us be a crowd
[1:09:24] effect
[1:09:30] but it should
[1:09:32] be a living
[1:09:34] presence of the Living God that's
[1:09:37] reflected through our life that's us
[1:09:40] taking personal possession of this it's
[1:09:44] been told me by authorities that before
[1:09:45] they had in the days of smelter to take
[1:09:48] the dross out of the gold take the iron
[1:09:51] and the pyite the pyite is so close like
[1:09:54] real gold till it's called Fool's Gold
[1:09:58] but the way they got all of all that
[1:10:01] out this where I was joking with brother
[1:10:05] Jason that they beat it out with a
[1:10:09] hammer Indians used to do that and the
[1:10:11] old goldsmiths used to do that beat it
[1:10:13] with a hammer and turn it over and over
[1:10:15] and over and they beat it until the
[1:10:17] dross was out of it and the only way
[1:10:19] that they knew that it was down to the
[1:10:21] gold was when the beater could see his
[1:10:24] reflection in it you see this would not
[1:10:27] be my brother and sister to take this
[1:10:29] into the spiritual realm this would not
[1:10:31] be a superficial be good
[1:10:35] people this is people that
[1:10:38] literally have been hammered that's
[1:10:40] right now we get a little farther right
[1:10:43] here the one who was beating could
[1:10:46] constantly look until he could almost
[1:10:48] shave by his own reflection in the gold
[1:10:50] that he was beating and when the holy
[1:10:52] spirit of God begins to beat on us
[1:10:56] with the gospel Hammer prise the Lord oh
[1:10:59] I wish our pastor wouldn't preach so
[1:11:02] direct look what the prophet's saying
[1:11:04] here it's the gospel Hammer yes now if
[1:11:07] you got a pastor that just loves to beat
[1:11:09] the Sheep my brother and sister there's
[1:11:10] something wrong but when we can discern
[1:11:14] by the holy ghost that it is the word of
[1:11:16] God beating the dross out of us don't
[1:11:20] resist and say I like my iron pyite and
[1:11:22] I like my little chunks of granite and I
[1:11:24] like my little whatever let the gospel
[1:11:27] hammer do its work
[1:11:30] amen until all the things of the world
[1:11:32] is beaten out and we can reflect the
[1:11:34] image of the Lord God then I believe we
[1:11:37] become Christians amen now I'm going to
[1:11:41] I'm going to discern what the prophet
[1:11:42] said here as a legalist would discern it
[1:11:45] you see I grew up in a church that had
[1:11:47] plenty of
[1:11:51] legalism until you've been beaten
[1:11:56] and the reflection of Christ can show in
[1:11:58] you you're not even a
[1:11:59] Christian so I just want you to know
[1:12:02] tonight not a single one of you is a
[1:12:06] Christian is that what God
[1:12:09] meant is that what the prophet meant no
[1:12:12] sir this is a work that God is coming
[1:12:16] and we'll have a little something now I
[1:12:18] know none of you ever have a stubborn
[1:12:20] Spirit on you but those Believers that
[1:12:22] have a stubborn Spirit God will allow
[1:12:25] things to come in their life and God
[1:12:28] will then use the word of God and the
[1:12:32] circumstance oh don't don't think God
[1:12:34] don't just use circumstance and you will
[1:12:37] come and you will feel as though you're
[1:12:39] being beaten and it's like how I you
[1:12:41] know I just went through this a few
[1:12:42] years ago yeah because you didn't pass
[1:12:45] the test then you went back to school
[1:12:47] now he's beating on you again what is he
[1:12:49] doing he's knocking all the dross out of
[1:12:52] us is it God not liking us is it not
[1:12:55] loving us no actually it's those he
[1:12:58] loves he chases see how the world we
[1:13:01] live in today has come down and so
[1:13:03] watered down the gospel so I'm sorry to
[1:13:06] use this word it's probably not a nice
[1:13:08] word but so
[1:13:09] sissified being a Christian that they
[1:13:12] won't preach it the prophet of God
[1:13:13] speaks of it they won't preach it
[1:13:15] because they're afraid to offend someone
[1:13:18] that's right Spurgeon says if you
[1:13:20] preached and didn't offend someone then
[1:13:22] you failed
[1:13:28] wow you
[1:13:30] see the gospel Hammer until the things
[1:13:33] of the world's beaten out and we can
[1:13:34] reflect the image of the Lord God then I
[1:13:37] believe we become
[1:13:39] Christians for the word Christian means
[1:13:42] Christlike and to reflect him now that
[1:13:44] doesn't mean that we have to grow a long
[1:13:46] beard as the artist picturers uh have
[1:13:48] him uh neither does it mean that we grow
[1:13:51] long hair as the artist pictures him
[1:13:53] having or to wear a robe as he wore for
[1:13:55] we're living in another day we don't
[1:13:57] necessarily have to be that to reflect
[1:14:01] his physical image amen right praise the
[1:14:04] Lord but look what brother brandham
[1:14:06] closed this out and as I say before I
[1:14:08] say again go back study these things
[1:14:10] read much further we don't have time in
[1:14:12] an evening or a Sunday to to just bring
[1:14:15] this whole thing out but we must right
[1:14:18] so he's given directive here but we must
[1:14:22] in our souls reflect his Spirit image
[1:14:24] and his man of life I do not believe
[1:14:26] that Christians consist of joining
[1:14:28] churches or Creeds I believe it's a
[1:14:30] reflection of Jesus Christ in a human
[1:14:33] being for we are his members the members
[1:14:35] of his body and we bear His Image
[1:14:39] scripture says amen isn't that beautiful
[1:14:43] I I I just love that amen as we look at
[1:14:46] that and just realize how that God uh is
[1:14:49] just he's just molding us Saints he's
[1:14:52] just bringing us down and and you know I
[1:14:55] had a grandfather a step-grandfather
[1:14:58] that was a rockhound and and quite
[1:15:01] successful at finding beautiful pieces
[1:15:03] of rock and and polishing and doing
[1:15:06] whatnot and selling it for money made a
[1:15:08] living doing that and uh I can remember
[1:15:11] uh my
[1:15:12] grandfather uh going out and knowing
[1:15:14] certain spots out in in the mountains
[1:15:17] and and he would pick up a very ugly
[1:15:20] Rock and um I would ask him hey Grandpa
[1:15:24] why are you packing that rock around and
[1:15:27] he says son he says you are looking at
[1:15:30] the
[1:15:32] outside I know what's on the inside and
[1:15:37] he would take that rock home and I would
[1:15:39] go and visit him maybe a week or two
[1:15:41] later and he would say Paul come out
[1:15:43] into my shop and he go out there and he
[1:15:45] would have cut that rock in two and um
[1:15:49] my brother and sister they was I forget
[1:15:51] what they even call those but on the
[1:15:53] inside of it
[1:15:55] what yes
[1:15:59] that and and it would be so beautiful
[1:16:02] and the formation of the
[1:16:06] crystals and then he would take them to
[1:16:08] a rock show a gun show whatever kind of
[1:16:11] show and he would sell those literally
[1:16:13] for hundreds of dollars a piece because
[1:16:18] they were a treasure but you see we in
[1:16:21] the flesh are looking on the outside
[1:16:25] God has already looked on the inside and
[1:16:29] says there's where the value is the
[1:16:31] value is not on the outside the value is
[1:16:34] on the
[1:16:35] inside and and I can remember my
[1:16:38] grandfather uh uh just uh doing that I
[1:16:41] remember one time uh there was this rock
[1:16:44] it was kind of flaky and you could kind
[1:16:46] of pick it apart if you tried real hard
[1:16:48] and and he says uh Paul don't don't do
[1:16:51] that I was sitting on his tailgate
[1:16:52] hitting it with the rockhammer and he
[1:16:54] says don't do that and I said why not
[1:16:55] Grandpa there's something inside here
[1:16:57] and he says that that's right but it's
[1:16:59] protected inside there right now let's
[1:17:01] reveal it in a different atmosphere a
[1:17:05] different place you know what was inside
[1:17:08] there a
[1:17:10] sapphire he recognized the rock
[1:17:12] formation that was present when
[1:17:15] sapphires were formed and inside of his
[1:17:17] Workshop he broke that rock open and I I
[1:17:21] don't know what he sold it for he never
[1:17:23] would confess I think he thought maybe
[1:17:25] as his grandson I was right there when
[1:17:27] he picked it up maybe I wanted my
[1:17:29] share but it was a sapphire that was so
[1:17:32] huge and so beautiful it was red uh kind
[1:17:35] of a red Radiance kind of semic clear
[1:17:38] but a red Radiance and it was
[1:17:40] huge and I asked my grandfather months
[1:17:42] later what'd you do with it and he goes
[1:17:44] oh you know we got to pay the light
[1:17:46] bills around here how much did you get
[1:17:48] for it Grandpa you know son that's just
[1:17:51] basically none of your business
[1:17:56] but you know the beautiful thing there's
[1:17:58] not a one of us with a treasure inside
[1:18:01] that doesn't know what the price was
[1:18:03] paid for the next one amen isn't that
[1:18:06] beautiful God don't keep a secret he
[1:18:08] doesn't say you're worth more than this
[1:18:10] one he paid a price and we know what
[1:18:12] that price was Hallelujah isn't that
[1:18:15] beautiful amen how God brings these
[1:18:17] things about such a way oh
[1:18:21] my now we'll look right
[1:18:35] here let me just catch myself here as
[1:18:39] we've kind of jumped around just a
[1:18:40] little
[1:18:41] bit now 1 Corinthians
[1:18:45] 15 but some men will say how are the
[1:18:48] dead raised up and with what body Do
[1:18:50] They Come Thou fool that which thou sest
[1:18:55] is not quickened except it
[1:18:58] die so we see the principle of the seed
[1:19:02] requires that the seed must go in the
[1:19:04] ground and die we have planted wheat in
[1:19:09] ground that was so dry and it never
[1:19:11] hardly rained or did anything in this
[1:19:13] Valley in the wintertime and you could
[1:19:15] go out in the month of Fe ending of
[1:19:18] February the beginning of March and the
[1:19:20] ground was dry enough to make dust and
[1:19:22] all the seed you had planted that fall
[1:19:24] before was just laying
[1:19:28] there it had not done one thing because
[1:19:32] it took
[1:19:33] moisture to
[1:19:35] die took the presence of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:38] to
[1:19:40] die you see an old dry-eyed confession
[1:19:42] in
[1:19:44] church won't do it
[1:19:48] amen and that which thou sest thou sest
[1:19:51] not that that body that it shall be but
[1:19:54] be grain it may chance of wheat or of
[1:19:58] some other grain but God giveth it a
[1:20:00] body as it hath pleased him and to every
[1:20:04] seed his own body amen All Flesh is not
[1:20:07] the same flesh but there is one kind of
[1:20:09] Flesh of men another flesh of beasts
[1:20:11] another of fishes and another of birds
[1:20:14] there are also celestial bodies and
[1:20:16] bodies terrestrial but the glory of the
[1:20:18] celestial is one and the glory of the
[1:20:20] terrestrial is another there is one
[1:20:23] glory of the Sun and another glory of
[1:20:25] the Moon another glory of the stars for
[1:20:28] one star differeth from another star in
[1:20:31] glory so also is a resurrection of the
[1:20:34] dead it is sown in corruption it is
[1:20:36] raised in incorruption it is swn in
[1:20:40] dishonor and is raised in glory it is
[1:20:43] sown in weakness and it is raised in
[1:20:45] power you know I have encountered in my
[1:20:48] short life uh my brother and sister
[1:20:51] people who their hearts desire I want to
[1:20:54] be in fluential in the church I want to
[1:20:57] be a a a uh a pillar in the church but
[1:21:01] ultimately my brother and sister they
[1:21:03] never achieve that status because they
[1:21:05] thought they would do that by knowing
[1:21:07] the message better than you they thought
[1:21:10] they would do that by being more
[1:21:12] authoritarian they thought they would do
[1:21:14] that by getting in a position of
[1:21:15] influence say with the ministry they
[1:21:18] thought they could do that but my
[1:21:19] brother and sister the word of God shows
[1:21:21] us that that seed's got to go in the
[1:21:23] ground and when it goes in the ground
[1:21:25] God's got a purpose and when that seed
[1:21:27] comes forth it will be exactly what God
[1:21:30] wanted it to be I tell you my brother
[1:21:32] and sister I think it is good to have a
[1:21:34] heart's desire to be influential in the
[1:21:36] church I believe it is a lovely desire
[1:21:39] to be influential and so to be
[1:21:41] influential who wants to be
[1:21:43] influential come on I think every hand
[1:21:45] ought to be being raised I want to be
[1:21:47] influential become a prayer Warrior
[1:21:50] right become a prayer Warrior instead of
[1:21:52] trying to figure out what's wrong with
[1:21:54] everybody lift them up to the throne of
[1:21:56] almighty God and say Lord pound on them
[1:21:59] oh that don't sound very nice does it I
[1:22:02] I'm praying for you brother I'm praying
[1:22:04] for your sister that God would just
[1:22:05] pound on you now said in the right
[1:22:08] spirit in the right way totally correct
[1:22:13] what are you
[1:22:14] saying well find better
[1:22:17] words but what you're saying is is I I
[1:22:19] want you to be at the image of Jesus
[1:22:22] Christ now if you literally are like yes
[1:22:26] I want the Lord just to pound on you cuz
[1:22:30] I don't like
[1:22:31] you no no Saints
[1:22:35] look swn in dishonor it's raised in
[1:22:39] glory sewn in weakness it's raised in
[1:22:42] power amen it is sewn a natural body is
[1:22:45] raised a spiritual body there is a
[1:22:46] natural body and there is a spiritual
[1:22:48] body and so it is written the first man
[1:22:50] Adam was made a living soul and the last
[1:22:53] Adam was made a quickening spirit how be
[1:22:57] it that was not the first which was is
[1:22:59] spiritual but that which is natural and
[1:23:01] afterward that which is spiritual
[1:23:03] Hallelujah so we see these principles
[1:23:06] that are laid in the scripture now the
[1:23:09] word of God shows us that every seed
[1:23:11] will bring forth of its own kind and we
[1:23:14] look at that my brother and sister and
[1:23:17] uh uh recognize that these are the
[1:23:20] things that um are strengthening the
[1:23:23] body of believer
[1:23:25] is they see God moving it's not we come
[1:23:27] to church and talk about what has been
[1:23:30] or what will be but we should be under
[1:23:33] the correct anointing of the word and
[1:23:36] the correct approach of the word should
[1:23:38] be able to come into the house of God
[1:23:40] and talk about what God is doing
[1:23:44] today amen not something past tense not
[1:23:47] something future tense is that not what
[1:23:49] the prophet of God said people made that
[1:23:51] mistake they looked for what God has
[1:23:53] done and what he will do and they miss
[1:23:55] what God is doing right now amen the
[1:23:59] first man of the earth earthy second man
[1:24:01] is from the Lord From Heaven as is the
[1:24:04] Earthly such are they also that are
[1:24:05] earthy and as is the Heavenly such are
[1:24:08] they also that are Heavenly and as we
[1:24:10] have borne the image of the earthy we
[1:24:13] shall oh Hallelujah I like verse 49 yes
[1:24:17] amen as we have borne the image of the
[1:24:19] earthy we're here sitting here tonight
[1:24:21] we're bearing that imageen Hallelujah
[1:24:25] we shall also bear the image of the
[1:24:29] Heavenly this my brother and sister is a
[1:24:31] revelation to a real Christian I will
[1:24:35] not be just struggling day by day by day
[1:24:38] I will not just have to press I will not
[1:24:41] have to kill this flesh I will bear the
[1:24:45] image what is it a positive confession I
[1:24:48] will bear the image of the Heavenly now
[1:24:51] this I say Brethren that flesh and blood
[1:24:53] cannot inherit the king om of God
[1:24:55] neither does corruption inherit
[1:24:59] incorruption oh what a wonderful
[1:25:01] Foundation that is laid in place you
[1:25:04] know what I want to just bring this out
[1:25:06] and tie this back to the quote we were
[1:25:08] just reading you see my brother and
[1:25:10] sister we were born
[1:25:14] Earthly if we will not surrender and
[1:25:17] have the dross beaten from
[1:25:21] us we can never come to the
[1:25:25] Incorruptible it requires a
[1:25:28] beating that's what I was joking I'm
[1:25:30] sorry just my terrible sense of humor I
[1:25:33] was joking with brother Jason oh wow
[1:25:35] look at this we get a beat we we just
[1:25:38] get to come out and beat these people
[1:25:41] but you see if that was the spirit of
[1:25:43] the flesh then they couldn't resist that
[1:25:46] nature to beat the sheep have you guys
[1:25:49] ever sat in a service where they beat
[1:25:51] the Sheep I've heard the Sheep out there
[1:25:53] the the preacher thought they were
[1:25:55] saying amen but the Sheep were
[1:26:00] just oh my anyway we won't go
[1:26:06] there you see my brother and sister
[1:26:08] there's one thing for God to beat the
[1:26:10] draw out of the sheep that's right and
[1:26:13] quite different to beat the Sheep
[1:26:16] amen to present an idea that you are not
[1:26:20] a Christian right now you can't be the
[1:26:22] bride you can't have the Holy Ghost with
[1:26:24] without some other action or works or
[1:26:26] something that's beating
[1:26:28] sheep we hold the hope of this gospel we
[1:26:32] hold the the the The Treasure of this
[1:26:35] gospel that is attainable to each and
[1:26:37] everyone whose heart is crying out for
[1:26:40] the word who whose life is longing to be
[1:26:43] in the image of Christ the door is open
[1:26:45] to us
[1:26:47] amen but we must have that
[1:26:51] desire My somebody has stolen the time
[1:26:55] again spoken words The Original Seed and
[1:26:59] last quotation we had was that God made
[1:27:01] every seed after its kind that it that's
[1:27:04] his see then when he made his Man In His
[1:27:08] Image who was that Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ was a seed of his word when Jesus
[1:27:17] was made
[1:27:18] flesh he was the Flesh of the word of
[1:27:22] God Amen I want I want you to think
[1:27:24] about that Saints all that was poured
[1:27:27] into Christ was poured into the church
[1:27:31] now he goes on to say this but I want to
[1:27:33] drive this home right here you and I are
[1:27:36] the Flesh of the word
[1:27:39] amen look what he says here he was a
[1:27:42] flesh of the word of God and when we
[1:27:45] receive the word of God then we becomes
[1:27:47] God's then we become God's word in our
[1:27:52] flesh see the church should be in that
[1:27:55] condition Hallelujah we are the Flesh of
[1:27:58] the word this is the manifestation that
[1:28:01] it's no longer wo we are unworthy wo we
[1:28:04] are nothing wo I'm a failure you are the
[1:28:07] very flesh God chose to put his word in
[1:28:11] amen I say the word says and I stand on
[1:28:14] it firmly that God does all things well
[1:28:16] amen hallelujah he doesn't make a
[1:28:19] mistake amen so when we look at this and
[1:28:21] part of this is the prophet saying just
[1:28:23] a remind the prophet saying when she
[1:28:26] talking about the bride recognizes who
[1:28:29] she is she will become an invincible
[1:28:31] Army when we recognize that we are the
[1:28:35] Flesh of the word of leoda that it is
[1:28:38] the season the time the place that God
[1:28:41] chose to reveal this and bring it out
[1:28:44] now I it'll change our whole outlook
[1:28:45] towards the word of God we will no
[1:28:47] longer look at ourselves as woe unto me
[1:28:50] I'm a sinner I'm no good I I don't know
[1:28:52] why God would choose me we might still
[1:28:54] have to deal with those kind of issues
[1:28:56] or questions but my brother and sister
[1:28:57] when you come to the day that you can by
[1:28:59] Revelation say you know what God chose
[1:29:02] me if there be a bride that is
[1:29:04] represented in the Book of Revelation I
[1:29:06] am her amen if there be a word that
[1:29:08] would be made manifest in the whole new
[1:29:10] testament of God's people I am them amen
[1:29:14] if there be a word that would come as it
[1:29:17] would be to to come and give a light in
[1:29:19] the darkness I am that light amen it is
[1:29:22] not boasting Upon Our eles it is not
[1:29:25] lifting ourselves up into a heady or
[1:29:26] high-minded place it is simply looking
[1:29:29] at the word and recognizing the word
[1:29:31] said that God would be manifested in
[1:29:34] flesh once again in our day and we
[1:29:37] recognize that and say Lord let that be
[1:29:40] me and I believe I am amen so you can
[1:29:42] come you can claim that or you can sit
[1:29:45] back as a skeptic and say we're looking
[1:29:47] for some other manifestation we're
[1:29:49] looking for some other sign but my
[1:29:51] brother and sister the word also shows
[1:29:53] us that they said said the sign was here
[1:29:55] and you missed it
[1:30:01] amen come
[1:30:04] on the sign is here absolutely the very
[1:30:07] sign the prophet of God was talking
[1:30:09] about God in this generation that sign
[1:30:12] is here don't miss it don't miss it some
[1:30:16] are waiting for it some are talking
[1:30:19] about when it will happen what they will
[1:30:21] do when it happen but it's happening
[1:30:23] that's right amen amen I remember a
[1:30:26] brother stood right here in this Pulpit
[1:30:28] right here and made a statement that he
[1:30:30] was the
[1:30:31] Rapture and people are like that's false
[1:30:34] just go study your messag amen and if
[1:30:37] that's false the prophet of God then was
[1:30:39] false prophet cuz he lays the foundation
[1:30:41] that we are the message we are the
[1:30:45] rapture we are the
[1:30:49] resurrection you see but somebody's
[1:30:51] looking for a future event waiting for
[1:30:54] something to happen someday to make that
[1:30:56] real but it's made real right in their
[1:30:58] midst but it didn't fit just like the
[1:31:00] Sadducees and Pharisees it didn't fit
[1:31:03] the dialogue that they believed it would
[1:31:05] happen in amen now this is a little bit
[1:31:08] history a little bit of of uh different
[1:31:11] stuff that has come out of studies of
[1:31:13] writings in the Middle East but I'll
[1:31:15] just present this I don't present it as
[1:31:17] a Doctrine I don't presented but it's
[1:31:19] just something that some people have
[1:31:20] represented and I'll just lay it out to
[1:31:22] you the reason that the devil
[1:31:24] took Jesus to the Pinnacle of the temple
[1:31:27] is because there was a faction or a sect
[1:31:29] amongst the Sadducees or Pharisees that
[1:31:31] had taught that when the Messiah would
[1:31:33] come that he would come floating down
[1:31:35] from heaven into their very midst and be
[1:31:38] above them and they would recognize the
[1:31:41] Messiah for the supernatural of his
[1:31:46] coming I don't know if that's true or
[1:31:47] not but I'll tell you what it is to make
[1:31:49] the point we'll get something so drilled
[1:31:52] in our head yeah
[1:31:54] that when he come as a baby in a
[1:31:57] Manger the son of some kind of messed up
[1:32:04] relationship didn't fit their Angelic
[1:32:07] Messiah floating down and them all
[1:32:10] seeing
[1:32:13] him okay so whether that history is
[1:32:16] correct or not please
[1:32:18] understand but the point I think is very
[1:32:21] clear so fixed that the the only way
[1:32:25] that God is going to come down in his
[1:32:27] little bride is this way or this way or
[1:32:32] this way but here's a bride that the
[1:32:35] word has come down is changing her her
[1:32:38] eyes have been open what was the glass
[1:32:40] Darkly is slowly dissolving away and
[1:32:43] revealing more of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:45] bringing it to the place that you and I
[1:32:47] one day look at this and recognize the
[1:32:49] prophet's words as he said it and we can
[1:32:51] say Amen to it cuz the prophet said amen
[1:32:53] to it but how about we come to the place
[1:32:55] we say Amen to it because it's
[1:32:57] Revelation to us and when he says you
[1:32:59] are flesh of his flesh and you are bone
[1:33:01] of his bone that we look at that and say
[1:33:04] that's right I am him and he is me amen
[1:33:09] it's not just a concept the prophet said
[1:33:11] it so I guess I say Amen to that but
[1:33:13] Revelation that comes into your heart
[1:33:15] and soul and realize I was in him in the
[1:33:18] beginning and I will be in him in the
[1:33:20] ending amen that's right amen and he
[1:33:23] says I cannot lose a one the work that I
[1:33:26] have begun I will finish the scriptures
[1:33:28] go on and on with the confirmation that
[1:33:31] my brother and sister the reason we know
[1:33:33] that the God of this world has not
[1:33:36] deceived us is because the word being
[1:33:38] made fresh is drawing you and I right
[1:33:41] into his presence it's not a religious
[1:33:44] spirit it's not going to church it's not
[1:33:46] identified I believe the message but the
[1:33:48] relationship of Jesus Christ coming so
[1:33:52] strong oh Hallelujah that it just grips
[1:33:55] your life it controls your life
[1:34:00] Hallelujah you see it comes along and he
[1:34:02] says and when we receive the word of God
[1:34:04] then we becomes God's word in our
[1:34:08] flesh oh yes yes that's I I understand I
[1:34:11] read my Bible and I no that's not God's
[1:34:14] word coming in your flesh God's word
[1:34:16] coming in your
[1:34:17] flesh have any of you ever had a
[1:34:20] physical therapy and they put the little
[1:34:22] electrodes on you
[1:34:25] and then they set the little timer the
[1:34:27] frequency and the
[1:34:29] duration and you look over and that nice
[1:34:32] little blond-haired blue-eyed physical
[1:34:34] therapist suddenly has teeth and horns
[1:34:38] and seems like the most cruel person on
[1:34:40] Earth CU they're like yes your
[1:34:43] evaluations show that your muscle
[1:34:45] stimulation is not
[1:34:51] sufficient can you turn this down
[1:34:58] no you know what the holy ghost's
[1:35:02] doing come on Saints are you with me
[1:35:06] tonight if we don't have sufficient
[1:35:09] spiritual
[1:35:11] stimulation God's not going to say
[1:35:14] well you know they
[1:35:17] tried I'll just go ahead and scratch
[1:35:19] their name out of the book because it
[1:35:20] just doesn't seem like no you know what
[1:35:23] God's going to do
[1:35:24] he's going to come he's going to give
[1:35:26] you sufficient
[1:35:29] stimulation amen he's going to take that
[1:35:32] spiritual Hammer oh come on yes sir come
[1:35:36] on I hope you understand this he's going
[1:35:37] to take that spiritual hammer and he's
[1:35:39] going to start hitting you in all the
[1:35:41] right places amen oh
[1:35:44] Hallelujah if I could just share this a
[1:35:46] tad bit of humor but it reminds me back
[1:35:48] in the days of physical therapy the
[1:35:50] young lady was like your your leg is
[1:35:52] atrophied so much uh and uh whatnot I
[1:35:55] I'm really concerned about your reflexes
[1:35:58] and your ability to regain your muscle
[1:36:00] mass and everything and um and uh so one
[1:36:03] day she got her boss to come and he's
[1:36:05] poking and he's prodding and then he
[1:36:07] pulled out and I recognized a little
[1:36:08] thing I've had my reflexes done before
[1:36:10] taking a CDL test right brother vasile
[1:36:13] you know they whack you in the knees and
[1:36:14] elbows and whatnot and I'm sitting there
[1:36:17] and the guy whacked me and my leg didn't
[1:36:19] move and he whacked me again and my leg
[1:36:21] didn't move and he he just looks up at
[1:36:23] me he goes this might be a problem then
[1:36:26] he hit me so hard my foot
[1:36:29] went and I was like that hurt and he
[1:36:31] said it was meant
[1:36:34] to I had to see if you could
[1:36:38] respond God will do that
[1:36:40] Saints don't sit back and just well I'm
[1:36:43] just going to laxidasical kind of be the
[1:36:45] bride of Christ God's going to hit you
[1:36:47] with something that causes you to
[1:36:49] respond to his word hallelujah cuz he
[1:36:53] said I never lost a single
[1:36:57] one okay sister Emmy comes so I'll stop
[1:37:03] hallelujah
[1:37:11] amen well just a
[1:37:15] moment we'll hurry through this then now
[1:37:19] that then from this and bringing this
[1:37:21] into seven Church ages God is building
[1:37:23] in seven Church ages a bride for Christ
[1:37:26] sounds like a building project right
[1:37:28] he's building in seven Church ages a
[1:37:31] bride for
[1:37:32] Christ through Philadelphian thyon
[1:37:35] pergamus saman Ephesus a church Aid that
[1:37:39] Jesus said if the bridegroom come in the
[1:37:41] first watch or the seventh watch all
[1:37:44] these virgins awakened see the truth of
[1:37:47] it is if God had chose to come in any
[1:37:49] one of the previous Church ages every
[1:37:52] one of those
[1:37:53] Brides that virgin bride would have
[1:37:56] risen aren't you thankful God coming the
[1:37:59] seventh amen give us our
[1:38:03] time they were they awoke The Virgins of
[1:38:06] Ephesus sna pergamus thyra Sardis
[1:38:08] Philadelphia leoda did you notice that
[1:38:10] it was the seventh age that when he came
[1:38:13] and woke up these sleeping virgins that
[1:38:15] brings them all the way back down to
[1:38:18] here see meaning back through the whole
[1:38:20] age back to this point for in this
[1:38:22] through the years ages he has built a
[1:38:25] bride born a bride am begotten amen a
[1:38:31] bride on Earth for Christ and the same
[1:38:34] way that he begets this bride he has
[1:38:37] begot
[1:38:39] individuals you know we can cut this
[1:38:41] down through a lot of explanation and
[1:38:43] bring it right down how did he how did
[1:38:45] he beget this bride the word amen how
[1:38:49] did he beget the individual the word
[1:38:51] amen you see it was never the
[1:38:53] organization the shock the prophet of
[1:38:55] God says harbored the seed until the
[1:38:58] harvest season that's right but the
[1:39:00] shock could never be the seed he says
[1:39:02] the shuck never looked like the seed the
[1:39:04] shuck goes into the ground but it's
[1:39:07] already
[1:39:10] dead you see the
[1:39:12] shuck can't come back to life I've
[1:39:16] plowed down in my
[1:39:19] lifetime would be literally like
[1:39:22] Millions of
[1:39:24] shocks and they never once
[1:39:28] produced a
[1:39:30] seed no life hallelujah amen
[1:39:36] amen then someone says that if you pack
[1:39:38] an image of Christ in your car on your
[1:39:41] wall that's a
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:44] sign of a Christian
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:56] I had a brother once made a comment to
[1:39:59] him and I said oh brother this and this
[1:40:04] happened and I said it really Disturbed
[1:40:06] me and he said brother Paul he says I
[1:40:08] don't mean to one up
[1:40:11] you but he said just recently I had a
[1:40:14] man call me asked me to come to his home
[1:40:17] he' been sick wanted me to pray for
[1:40:19] him he said and I walked a large photo
[1:40:22] of the
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:27] prophet he said I don't judge the man
[1:40:30] for having a
[1:40:32] television but he said when the man told
[1:40:35] me he said every night I sit here in
[1:40:38] this
[1:40:39] church and I
[1:40:46] pray I
[1:40:48] open how do we get from the point my
[1:40:52] brother and sister
[1:40:55] that we have moved our Focus From The
[1:40:58] Prophet as a
[1:41:00] prophet to putting a prophet up to
[1:41:05] worship
[1:41:06] Him part 2A or 2 b or c or the
[1:41:09] continuation of this right here brother
[1:41:12] brandham in this ties this right back
[1:41:15] together and reminds us as we all
[1:41:18] know the problem that Shadrach Meshach
[1:41:22] and Abednego had it's not worshiping
[1:41:26] God but was worshiping the image that's
[1:41:29] right and they lifted the image up as
[1:41:33] though it were
[1:41:35] God my brother and sister let's make
[1:41:38] sure that the image that we worship the
[1:41:42] image that we reflect the image we look
[1:41:46] to is Jesus Christ don't let Satan come
[1:41:50] in and blur that line Amen brother brand
[1:41:53] goes on to say that God honored Shadrach
[1:41:56] Meshach and abedo his their position I'm
[1:41:59] paraphrasing this it's not the exact
[1:42:01] words he honored that so much that he
[1:42:04] went in the fire and stood with
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:08] them now whatever your fiery trial is
[1:42:12] don't let someone else put another image
[1:42:14] in front of
[1:42:15] you the image of our Lord Jesus
[1:42:18] Christ that's the image that's right
[1:42:21] that the prophet brought and pointed to
[1:42:24] and encouraged us this is what we're
[1:42:27] going to this is what we look to this is
[1:42:29] what we
[1:42:32] worship don't let any other image I
[1:42:35] encourage you Church don't let any other
[1:42:37] image I don't care how nice the man is
[1:42:41] that brings that image to you if it's
[1:42:44] anything less than perfect to the word
[1:42:47] of
[1:42:48] God don't allow yourself to be drawn to
[1:42:51] that cuz remember remember there was a
[1:42:53] lot of Hebrew
[1:42:55] children only three of
[1:42:58] them right had courage enough to stand
[1:43:01] up and say I won't worship my Prophet
[1:43:04] that's right I won't worship that that's
[1:43:06] right he's my Prophet Daniel was a
[1:43:08] prophet to the day he he was there he
[1:43:11] was that representation the
[1:43:13] supernatural but you
[1:43:15] see then our lives should re reflect the
[1:43:20] image of Christ not in our joining
[1:43:23] church or in our packing crucifix or our
[1:43:28] emotions but it should be the living
[1:43:30] presence of a living God that's
[1:43:34] reflected through our life amen
[1:43:37] hallelujah Saints say brother Paul you
[1:43:39] sure beat on that a lot you know why I
[1:43:41] do
[1:43:42] Saints it's a really strong
[1:43:44] spirit it's a really really really
[1:43:48] strong
[1:43:49] spirit and I'm not here to beat on it
[1:43:51] it's not my job but my job is to stir up
[1:43:54] your pure mind in remembrance that Jesus
[1:43:58] Christ and Jesus Christ Alone is who we
[1:44:01] worship Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:44:04] tonight amen well praise the
[1:44:08] Lord let's just stand sing that song Who
[1:44:11] I Am Lord who I am isn't it so good to
[1:44:15] see who we are Saints I I'm so happy I
[1:44:18] just think about the things that God's
[1:44:21] God is is uh doing what we see who who
[1:44:25] we are you know a few years ago sister
[1:44:28] Jerry and I uh we we spoke I spoke at a
[1:44:32] youth uh convention in
[1:44:33] Paraguay and the brothers it was so hot
[1:44:36] they said it had never been that hot
[1:44:38] there before that they remembered I
[1:44:40] remember what it was I don't want to
[1:44:41] exaggerate it's like 117 or 18 or
[1:44:44] something Celsius which was
[1:44:46] like no not 10 something it was 117 it
[1:44:51] was 117 what was it like 47 or 8 or
[1:44:54] something like that Celsius let me get
[1:44:55] my thoughts correct 118 it's like trees
[1:44:58] are bursting into
[1:45:00] flames no it was like 47 or 48 Celsius
[1:45:03] like 117 or
[1:45:05] 18° and and it just so hot and so the
[1:45:08] brothers cancel some Services which I
[1:45:10] honestly would have just loved I know
[1:45:12] the Lord would strengthen us that's what
[1:45:13] we went there for but they after
[1:45:15] preaching quite a few Services they just
[1:45:17] said we're we're going to take you on a
[1:45:18] little road trip and uh we ended up in a
[1:45:21] city and there was a a Observatory there
[1:45:25] and the lady that was um that was there
[1:45:28] as the guide I guess you'd say in the
[1:45:31] observatory um it was so interesting cuz
[1:45:34] they literally had you lay down on these
[1:45:37] cushions and then all of this displayed
[1:45:41] and played out above you and around
[1:45:43] you and this woman who I don't want to
[1:45:46] sound judgmental but she didn't really
[1:45:48] look like a
[1:45:50] Christian wait that was really
[1:45:53] judgmental
[1:45:57] Paul really
[1:45:59] judgmental cuz I think Christians
[1:46:01] usually wear more
[1:46:02] clothes um but she gave reference and
[1:46:06] she started talking about these things
[1:46:08] and tying them to the Bible tying them
[1:46:11] to
[1:46:12] scripture and it was it was just
[1:46:15] fascinating to see all of that and I
[1:46:19] thought
[1:46:20] imagine I don't know brother Brown may
[1:46:22] have been been in a Observatory at some
[1:46:24] time maybe God just revealed it to him I
[1:46:27] don't know I I couldn't
[1:46:29] say the lady made a comment about it is
[1:46:35] believed that this may have well been
[1:46:37] God's first
[1:46:41] Bible Hallelujah I thought there it is
[1:46:43] the prophet of God's laid it out to us
[1:46:46] amen he told us God's revealed in that
[1:46:48] God's revealed in that well do you know
[1:46:51] I wanted to help this lady but I didn't
[1:46:54] want to be out of order that um I wanted
[1:46:57] to when they turned the lights on
[1:46:59] brother Trevor I wanted to walk up to
[1:47:00] her and tell her I'm God's Bible
[1:47:06] also but see it's hard for people you
[1:47:08] see Saints look I I don't mean to just
[1:47:10] drag your time away but I want to drive
[1:47:12] this home to
[1:47:13] you it's hard for people to move out of
[1:47:17] that element of I am nothing
[1:47:24] when as the bride of Christ they should
[1:47:26] recognize we are God In the Flesh in
[1:47:33] Leia I am his word revealed I am his
[1:47:38] life revealed oh no no no you can't you
[1:47:41] can't you can't be that no no no no no

[1:57:23] Wednesday night here but I could share
[1:57:24] just a couple things that happened to
[1:57:26] you uh to me I mean in the last little
[1:57:28] bit here and you know Saints they just
[1:57:31] seem like small things but I tell you
[1:57:33] what happens when God comes down and
[1:57:36] deals with people who don't talk about
[1:57:39] God and they want to talk about
[1:57:42] God you have to know I don't really like
[1:57:45] the phrase they use out here in the
[1:57:46] world when they say that's a God thing I
[1:57:49] I don't like that phrase but you know
[1:57:52] it's God when the people who don't talk
[1:57:54] about God want to talk about God
[1:57:57] something's stirring amen just pray for
[1:58:01] God's leadership amen be like our
