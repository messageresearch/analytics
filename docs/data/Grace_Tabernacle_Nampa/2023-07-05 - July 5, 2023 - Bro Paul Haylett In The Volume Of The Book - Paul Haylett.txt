we we go back a long long ways oh my my memory is getting shorter oh my oh my I'm sorry I just have to do this God bless you yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah my oh my so so many things thank you Lord oh mile well I I've just had my little worlds hook up right here oh well we just uh tonight we also want to remember just uh some greetings brother Prashant sister Concha always they should just be standard on our prayer list right as part of this body uh brother Adrian sister Ada uh just a very busy season for them but their hearts desires to be here for uh Communion next time for sure and um you know just want to remember all of them I'm very happy to see schedules and things change and and God you know just moving God's in control amen hallelujah amen I would like to turn and to Psalm the 40th chapter thank you musicians what a lovely song service tonight the musicians just uh it's Disturbed my heart and I want to just kind of bring out to you a little bit of how I come to this and we'll find that this scripture sure here parallels amen Hebrews 10 which was our Bible study this last Sunday evening and I want to take my title tonight in this journey aren't aren't you glad we're on this journey I I thank the Lord that that he's allowed us to have this journey now if if a journey was all disaster in all struggles and there was no hope at the end then we would be like the world but God has brought us out amen as the scripture we'll share with us in just a moment he has took us from the myri pit and he has set our feet on the solid rock and that alone right there brings us in a position while life is not always easy it has set us up and apart from the spirit of laodicea now remember all of this that is happening around us is fueled by a spirit amen so the devil doesn't have to show up and literally knock on your door if he can anoint us to decide that it's all for naught our own self then Satan just sets back and watches us self-destruct but God in his grace and mercy comes you know uh you know the three little pigs and the Wolf my brother and sister if those three little pigs had had the Holy Ghost they'd rebuked that devil and they would have sent him away from their house but what they did is they looked to themselves and said hmm how are we going to deal with the wolf and found out they couldn't amen and so I'm sorry to throw a little three little pigs into the sermon tonight but when we look to ourself we can expect for our house to get blown down but when we look to Christ amen he's the solid rock and we are anchored in him and the devil can huff and puff all he wants and he will not accomplish his goal amen so I want to speak to you tonight taking the title from the scripture tonight in the volume of the book amen Psalm the 40th chapter verses one through eight I waited patiently for the Lord and he inclined unto me and heard My Cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the myri clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings can we say Amen he had put a new song in my mouth even praising to our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lord hmm I want to preach blessed is the man that maketh the Lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies many O Lord my God are thy wonderful Works which now has done and thy thoughts which are to us word they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if I could declare and speak of them there are more than can be numbered he's talking about you bride amen if we could have ever kept a list in our life and even knew the half of what God is doing on our behalf we would be we would have to become uh what did they call them the right for a living um um scribe we'd have to become scribes because we would day by day be just writing and writing of the glory and the blessings and all of the things that God is doing for us and amen amen sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hath thou opened I'm going to say Amen to that Hallelujah that right there is more incredible than one can even imagine that we can hear um burned offering and sin offering hath thou not required then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me I Delight to do thy will o my God yea thy law is not even just written on when God wrote it in our life he didn't just put it superficial he made it who we are if it was on the surface it could be wiped or washed away but when it come thy law is within my heart oh Lord we thank you tonight I just ask you to bless this service father Lord your presence here already I think we could almost close our Bibles sing another song and go home and be able to say we met with you tonight Lord father just bless this time I pray together all of the prayer requests Lord those stated those not stated or remembered father you know we're just human but ask you Lord to just deal with each one deal kindly we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah you may be seated amen you know there's sometimes uh that that God just lay something on your heart and it is tonight's Saints to me just a real joy and if God will bless this I'll be able to speak it with the feeling that I felt in looking into this that just something that was there and as I read this in Psalms 40. uh it is the connection come from our Bible study uh there in uh Hebrews 10 and we'll look at this my brother and sister how it is that God has given to you and I as we read this scripture it is we can feel the heart cry our own Hearts cry we can feel that there's something in US compelling us to respond amen we're not the kind of Believers that just sit back and say uh who are you or what are we I belong to this church no my brother and sister I belong to Jesus Christ amen the building just happens to be our shelter in a natural world Amen it is not our refuge Christ is our refuge amen and so this heart's Cry of every believer some are more vocal some not so much etc etc but my brother and sister I believe tonight as we read Psalm 40 these verses as it goes on just a whole Beautiful chapter but we can say this is my testimony this is this is my heart's cry this is what is being pulled out of me is compelling me to be who I am is because I can recognize as David is here and writing and talking about these things that we can recognize this this is a same God now isn't that awesome tonight amen there's nothing like a sense of belonging amen we as humans were meant to have a sense of belonging and it is there in the sense of belonging it's not just that there are some people you know a conversation I had recently the so you know somebody makes a statement so there's like more people like you than just you oh don't you even know amen the Bible says that they are as the sand of the seashore amen this body of Believers oh let me tell you but something inside of me says they're not ready for a cannon blast they're just you know wondering is there a few more people like you oh let me tell you there's a few more people like us they're called The Bride amen and God's the only one that has numbered them amen no man can identify no man can make the list it's God and God Alone amen and I say thank you Lord Jesus amen so it's here that we see this heart's cry moving the Believers the bride of Christ and the hour we're living in you know my brother and sister I won't go in there because I don't want to be depressed and I'd probably be the first one but if you just ever follow the headlines I go on the computer usually every morning for just a brief moment so that I'm not too happy during the day and everything there is very rarely anything that even pops up in the news that you would say oh that's wonderful a little girl lost in a national forest somewhere eight days comes out alive you know well praise the Lord you know the little girl I mean uh you know a lot of adults wouldn't have survived out there and hear this little girl survives I'm sure she had some bumps and bruises and scrapes and dehydration and all of these kind of things but you know it does your heart good well wonderful things still happen but you know our government's falling apart our nation's falling apart the world's falling apart I'll stop right there amen but what is happening the bride day by day is being strengthened she is in the word and the word is strengthening her and she's not relying upon herself she's not saying look me as a Christian look how strong I am but it's quite the opposite she's saying you know what the farther I've got down this road the more dependent I have become and I'm going to become so dependent that I'm going to be so close to Christ that you you won't even be able to peel me off amen I will be stuck to him or he'll be stuck to me however you want to word it amen but you see what God is doing he's bringing us to a place that we can look in the word and not it is not always my brother and sister now judgment begins in the house of God I lift my hand and say thank you Lord many a sermon has corrected this guy right here in the house of God but not everything is Judgment in the house of God sometimes God just brings an anointing down a presence that's there to remind us of who we are amen now correction reminds us who we are because he says those I love I chasten so if he's not chastening he's not loving amen but we are here tonight as the Bride Can I Be boastful tonight we are here tonight as the bride the bride of Christ amen not a bride the bride amen hallelujah so it's there we look now why would just uh go through the scriptures for just a moment if you don't mind uh verse 1 he says I waited patiently for the Lord ain't inclined into me in other words you could take this if you want to look at this and you can say that he he was disposed to listen he was inclined to to come and listen and and take what I you know I was there and as it is my brother and sister when God inclines himself he is coming and saying I am going to and that fits right into the word promise he's come and he said you cry out I will hear you and I will respond to you otherwise you know what the devil does if you ever saw that maybe you experienced it you get in a position maybe not not spiritually strong and we think our prayers came up hit the ceiling and like smoke above the range just curled away and slowly disappeared I can't tell you as a minister how many times people have spoke to me my prayers are not getting beyond the roof don't want to sound judgmental but what was your prayer was it a begging was it selfish was it out of season a lot of things I won't go into all of that but a lot of things that can impact that we say Lord I need you to come on the scene and he says okay I'm coming I'm telling you if my phone does more than two little circles I'm like what's wrong with this thing now approach god with your prayers the same way and we don't wait around to hear the answer we're already gone gonna fix it ourself before God can even come on the scene so what happens is when we come as David David had those experience but he says here I waited patiently oh Lord let that be me amen I want to pray and I'm in a way patiently for you to come on this scene and answer and you incline yourself and let's make this personal tonight not a historical message here and he inclined himself unto me amen and he heard My Cry amen can we claim that tonight amen so God is ever present and with us on time all the time we need to get on his time amen you know and so it says here he brought me up also so besides the fact that he's acknowledging God's hearing my prayer and he's doing this work in my life I was in a pit oh my can anyone tonight say I know I have a vague memory of that pit amen but I'm not in the pit anymore and don't let the devil toss you back in the pit because God's delivered you amen you know like the little story of the man was just gonna uh you know he was had this old donkey fell in the well and he says you know what there's no way I can get this donkey out we're just gonna bury him here and they start throwing dirt in there but the donkey's down there in the bottom of the well and every shovel full of dirt that hit him amen every accusation every dirty mean thought the devil ever had and the donkey shakes the dirt off and next thing you know the donkey's up around level amen because he refused to accept that he refused to stand for that and I tell you my brother and sister this pit that God has brought us out of you were actually an integral part of getting out of the pit God did not just say okay I'm pluck you out of the pit and you know and throw you over here or put you over here God Made You and I as the bride of Christ struggle through the Deliverance of the pit amen he says I'm going to deliver you trust me but you are gonna get down get desperate have a better prayer life Reach Out cry out I'll answer but you've got to put an effort in oh we got way too many people in the world we live in today that just think God's Gonna hand him everything on the platter my brother and sister Our God wants you and I to be molded by our experience he wants us to have character when we come out of here it'll match we get to heaven with a characterless bride Lord my Mansion is not as big as his I this and I that no no no sorry that's not what God's doing we are going to be standing there before the Throne of God so thankful for what God has done for us there would be no room even if the devil could get there there wouldn't be room for the devil because this bride is going to fill up heaven with her praise amen she's going to fill it up amen and she's going to be standing there so solid because she's on a rock now my brother and sister we know I'm preaching to the choir in a sense but just bear with me amen this was not a rock of Peter a man who denied Christ a man who who literally within you might say hours backslid what kind of Revelation is that I I don't want that kind of Revelation you know there's a little crisis let me throw this in as an example a little crisis going on in the United States a major home builder in the United States and they've got a point that they are so greedy that they're building these brand new homes and they're actually in many cases unfit to live in before the people have ever moved in they're being sued right now for hundreds of millions of dollars now my brother and sister that's not the kind of habitation God is creating for you and I he's not creating for you and our habitation that's not fit to live in he is creating a habitation that is fit for a bride Fit For A chosen people to stand in his presence that's the kind of habitation that God is bringing us to and I can say praise the Lord now I'll throw this out as an example don't have a lot of Sympathy For Us amen but when I got married Jerry got married amen We Got Married the same time in case that wasn't uh but you know uh some of the first places I took my bride to live in and she lived in them for years amen you know houses that had holes in the floors and houses that the wind blew through the curtains you you didn't have to look outside what direction the wind was you just look at the curtains you'll see what direction they're going and it was that kind of a world and and I'm glad I thank God that she she was determined and stuck with me and we just had a kind of a bulldog faith that one day we would have a different alternative my brother and sister the devil would like you and I to believe that God has put us in a less than satisfactory habitation he would like us to believe that what he has provided for us is not sufficient for the day but I'm here to tell you the word says that it is sufficient I'm here to testify it is sufficient and I'm going to confess it is sufficient and we will come out of here as thee adorned bride of Jesus Christ amen not just a bunch of us I shouldn't use that word in church amen just so you know shabby looking we we were not going to come out of this shall be looking remember the little story about the Rancher and the and the the uh cousin or whatever my brother and sister she's there in work clothes scrubbing the floors doing the dishes doing all of this stuff and you know every day she just was wearing these kind of you know less than desirable clothes and that's how and I hope you can take the spiritual context that's how the other churches viewed her you're not as glorious as us you don't have as many people you don't have as fine of buildings you don't have this you don't have that but I'm telling you the day she went out to meet her bridegroom she was dressed in a dress that was a fitting to be a bride amen she didn't walk out there and shall be stained closed but she walked out there and pardoned me but without even a spot on the Hem of her garment and God said you know that's what I've got you're going to be right here laodicea you're going to labor you're going to push your way through this but when it comes to that moment cold praise the Lord when it comes to that moment not even a spot on the Hem of your garment oh thank you Lord and that was just a cute little story The Prophet told us [Music] Hallelujah let me get focused here blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust and respecteth not the proud now I'm just going to jump right out here I don't care whether you support Trump or not that's really up to you but I can tell you right now if you do support him you're supporting a very proud man and I'm not really picking on him because I think he's better than our current alternative uh but but you look at this see and people have thrown themselves into this this is the man but they're actually by scripture supporting a proud man and that's an anti-word and so we realize that while you know remember when he got elected or was coming up to that you know they were all like oh Trump it's in the scripture he's in the scripture all right my brother and sister he's in the scripture as a proud man not one to be looked up to amen but one to flee from amen amen I'm so glad God's in control amen if not well I don't know where we would move but look at this blessed is the man that maketh the Lord his trust and respect and not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies many oh my god oh Lord my God are thy wonderful works and I'm just going to just kind of paraphrase our way through verse 5. my brother and sister because I already kind of touched on it how that we if we could by recall start to write the things of our life start to write how visiting with the in-laws they're like wow even when you wasn't serving God he was right there wasn't he he was he was right there all the time all the time he can't lose a one my brother and sister amen the devil would lead us off you know now lead us right to the wolf amen forget about the wolf coming to us the devil would lead us to the wolf amen but God In His Infinite Mercy amen and if we start to just recall this is what Fellowship really ought to be it shouldn't be about politics and it shouldn't be about the price or whatever my brother and sister but Fellowship ought to be us as Sons and Daughters of God recounting to one another in encouragement of what God has done for us and what he is currently doing amen you see when God's on the scene oh let me just put it this way when God's on this scene you don't need to see the conclusion you know what the conclusion will be amen God's not taking you out there to leave you in the wilderness but he said I'll take you through the Wilderness and lead you into the Promised Land so the problem is is we say well I just struggle to trust the Lord well what you need to do is learn to just trust the word and the word says that he hasn't lost a one so all you got to do is sit back and say Lord you're in control I'm along for the ride amen I've said this before you know some country music person sang a song about Lord take the wheel they still got their foot on the gas they still got their foot on the break oh Lord You Take the Wheel he wants it all he doesn't want part of it he wants all of it that we would say Lord and I've only seen a glimmer of a shaking of a pebble on the mountain but your word said this mountain will move and I believe your word so the mountain in my mind and heart is gone I'll tell you what that will do it will change your perspective about life when you're looking out not looking at the mountain waiting for it to move but look at the word and says I have a need and he promised he would move the mountain mountain you're gone the world's going to say you're crazy but you're crazy anyway I mean what's more and more time of them saying you know you're crazy what is what does God need to send a prophet we have all of these things well according to my Bible he had to send a prophet to fulfill the Bible amen so he would send a prophet if nothing more than to fulfill his word but I'll tell you what tonight I needed a prophet I needed someone that would come and I needed god with skin on I needed a prophet that had to apologize for getting his wife to lie I needed a prophet that made mistakes under the prophet that had these attributes and they're looking for a perfect one I'm looking for one I can relate to amen and God brought him right down in our midst and said here it is because it's not about him it's all about me and so he doesn't have to be perfect because I'm the perfect one and there it was in that that God is fulfilling his word amen his wonderful works and this is kind of tying back into our Bible study Sunday night talking about sacrificing offering you see we've come to a place it says Hear sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire My nears hast thou open my brother and sister we just don't really grasp what an outstanding Revelation that David had for that day for that time in history how deep his Revelation was many were still looking out saying I got to fulfill this I've got to do this I got to do this I got to check the box check the box but David had a revelation that he started to recognize it's not about that it's not about blood and lambs and Bullocks and all of these things it's all about me being the one that was sacrificed to the ultimate lamb the one that has given over to the ultimate and he'd come to that place he recognized who he was and where he fit and this coming because I'm not wanting to keep you all night we just kind of move so he realized that that the sin offering was for purpose but it was not God's ultimate isn't that beautiful but I like verse 7 and this is what really caught my attention then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me that's almost sounds arrogant if you are a not a real believer but yes Brother David hit it right there it makes the word so personal oh Saints amen you realize God wrote this book and in this book he encapsulated you amen everything you are is in the volume of this book and it is not that I need to go over here and people say but I'm bothered by you focus so much on brother Branham well I'm sorry that you missed the messenger that came to the door but I'm holding the message amen I'm not chasing the postman down the street saying thank you thank you for the message thank you for the message I have been given the message and the volume look at this people say well not I don't want every promise in this book well I've actually changed my opinion on that I want every promise in this book I want every promises is talking about the what we might call negative well Hallelujah I need to have the contrast amen sister April some of these tests you guys do are all about contrast aren't they and it's all about measure the background of this to that and that's how they actually see the picture imagine if you took the Majestic mountains away and only left this puddle you'd look at it and say nice Lake but it would lose its significance because it lost the Majesty of what was placed around it we could get really deep down but I'm going to just kind of stay on the surface we're all believers here the promise of this book tonight song service well God laid on brother Alex's heart brother Trevor is talking about love and I'm over there going thank you Lord thank you Lord I felt like I was on the right track I believe I was on the right track I know I'm on the right track now amen my brother and sister you see what this is this is the greatest love story how many of you read romance novels even if you did you wouldn't admit it so you're going to wonder where I'm at okay I'm going to tell you my brother and sister all that was in Christ was poured into the church who's the church amen it's not a building it's not shingles Rafters a floor carpet whatever amen all that was in Christ was poured into the church amen all of the word amen pointed to Jesus Christ he's there telling them that if you had known let me just paraphrase it if you had known God like you claimed to you would know me amen because the book has been all about me from the beginning to present time Amen in fact we can take it all the way to the end it's about him but this could get a little confusing if you didn't have a depth as it were in the message because you see this book is all about me this book is all about you wait it's all about Jesus Christ no it's all about me because he poured himself into me and I am him and he is me I'm bone of his bone I am flesh of his flesh and he has come and possessed us people are like well I don't know these Spirits possessing people I want to be possessed amen I want the Holy Ghost to come down every fiber of my being I want to be this expressed oh Hallelujah Hallelujah amen it's powerful words Saints it's a powerful message we have and when you see the open word amen let me just figuratively take this we have the Bible it was a closed book now look we come out of denominations family and this all of these things some our families have history serving God going way back but one day the book got opened oh my even people today it's sad to say there's people around our ranks that believe you shouldn't read between the lines I'm there I'm stunned I I remember the day I heard this from an individual yeah you shouldn't be reading between the lines you'll just get confused and I'm like but I just read the prophet saying this bride is going to read come on between the lines oh what is it amen now it didn't say our eyes were opened it said our ears were hearing but you see I'm standing on my example and that is the fact that I can read this but until God speaks to me it's not what my eyes see it's God speaking to us because we could be physically and be filled with filled with revelation amen so it's God speaking to us and when the book is opened when you see the open book now I'm going to be preaching a little contrary just please balance what I'm saying tonight okay when we have the open book you are seeing the bride in word form amen you say oh we receive Christ we see Christ yeah wherever Christ is his bride is there with them amen and so you when the book is open you are seeing the bride in word form I'm so glad I can read this word and see myself in the presence of almighty God I don't need someone to interpret I don't need somebody to explain amen God said I'm going to send a prophet he's going to introduce you to your bridegroom Jesus Christ and in that introduction I don't even need to go in that I don't need to but I guess I will amen you know we use words like wordbride catchy isn't it what does it mean go in the grocery store walk down the aisle and for any product there's 10 versions of it and they're all the best I mean you've never went in a store and saw a label on a product we have the worst tomato sauce no sir it's all the best and the devil's out here and the prophet of God said it's not a glow it's a glare and some people like a glare some people are like the shinier it is do you know how to catch a raccoon a drill a hammer and a nail and a lid off a tin can you drill a hole in the log put the lid of the tin can in the bottom and drive a nail at an angle and when the raccoon sees that shiny lid he reaches in there no pain reaches in there grabs the holds of the lid the pain comes of the fact he won't let go of what he believes is important now I know this is a stretch but bear with me that's why let go and let God have his way I'm holding on to my career I'm holding on to this I'm holding on to my bank account Hallelujah the can just walk away if he'll let go but he can't let go it's of his nature he has to have it hmm we could go a lot of ways from that couldn't we so let's go back to being a word bride we can take a whole so the phrase word bride and it's very catchy and we can tout that everywhere we go we are the word bride of Jesus Christ are we prove it let me open the book it's right here in written form you see a lot of people have read it if you talk to people and I like to talk to people you know it's kind of scary if I can insert this when you're young you're like oh Lord don't let me be like my dad I'm now 61 years old and I'm like I can't even hardly walk in a store without talking to somebody but God has been gracious and I start fishing and pretty soon somebody's like well what do you do well I have a couple jobs really at your age you work two jobs yeah I'm a farmer by day you might say a pastor by weekend or evening what do you do they share that and I'm like where do you go to church oh we haven't been to church in years my apologies not like oh yeah that's too bad oh that's terrible no my apologies you don't know what you're missing man Church my brother and sister you might misunderstand me tonight but I'm telling you even if you did not have this Revelation Church is good for you even in the denomination church is good for those people yeah well I have quote to back it up prophet of God said if they just preach that Jesus is divine hmm that wasn't for our day that wasn't for us we recognize that but my brother and sister not everyone has had the book opened not everyone's had their ear open and so we see how that God is working and as the book has been opened and we come with Revelation to look at this amen what do we do we have the same vocabulary with an entirely different language I'm a Believer I'm telling you you can go down here in the grocery store at the gas station wherever I'm a Believer but there's an entirely different language associated with I'm a Believer and you'll find that the world is increasingly vocal about being the Bride of Jesus Christ amen but my brother and sister what does it mean it is not something as a self-identifier we're living in the day of the self-identification amen I was just a little deal with sister Jerry the other day sitting there in a chair and the young lady that is sitting there looks at me I thought she was joking at first and she said um sir and that's sharing she called me sir and then asked me how I identified I looked at her and I was like what did you just say and she got all embarrassed she goes I I have to ask you this how do you identify why do I look like I know that's not sufficient you have to say it I'm man male well you know just name them all off what what goes along you know and she just laughs she goes yeah I'm sorry that's a requirement I have to do my brother and sister but as I was sitting there I was thinking about that what is my identifier what is my identifier amen the world is caught up in the very uh Vapor let me put it this way the very Vapor that came out of the Garden of Eden they have breathed it in and it has poisoned them and so they are their identifying with something that was there the original the beautiful creation of God and then as it is as the prophet of God brings it out shows us very clearly amen the masculine the feminine how that the feminine separated out of the masculine are you following why they're confused Satan's took them back where not to Creation to the garden and as it was in the beginning so shall it be in the end and so they are there taking this end and they were never I hope you follow me I don't mean to make a Doctrine out of this it's just something that's been forming in my mind and is it there how did we become separated masculine feminine it was God did the separating and they are here now a Godless generation and there is no separation they don't know if they're masculine they don't know if they're feminine because it was God that did that separating amen and we sit here today just thinking I was born this way no my brother and sister you were created this way it wasn't just I burst some chromosomes some mixing of DNA it was from the very Throne of almighty God before the foundation of the world that he said this is who you are and they did not come out of that they come another alternative route and they don't know if they're man or woman because the spirit of laodicea has taken them back into the garden and they're in the garden they are sitting there who are we what are we well I'll tell you my brother and sister this word bride is not just a catchy phrase you might have wondered where I was taking you it is a fact it is a fact we are the word bride of Jesus Christ he's the one that said this is what will take you back to your original in your place of my presence Walking In The Garden in the cool of the evening it won't be the spirit of laodicea it will be the word and when the word is open and becomes real it is a living I'm going to use the word creature if you don't mind it is a living creature amen it's not a dead letter of the word but it's living Hallelujah oh now I want you to disconnect with this right here real quick because this also goes to this laodicean spirit anointed ones at the end time amen hallelujah we're going to just take a little blip out of this if you don't mind brother Brown says right here I don't care what it is if it's contrary to the written word for this hour it's a lie God will have nothing to do with it no matter how sincere how educated how smart how true it sounds how reasonable it sounds if it's contrary to the word of this hour they're creating more genders every day you can't find them I can't find them my brother and sister I can't find them if it's contrary to the word of this hour it's a lie and this sounds harsh but the world is living a lie there's no truth in them they have identification but they don't have reality they don't have Christ so therefore they have something else I wouldn't even say it was created because the prophet says it was perverted so it's not even something created to go back to it was perverted now in verse 7 it said then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me I don't want you to get caught in a side note sometimes it's easy we could get caught in a side note where you're like well okay that thought yeah okay okay we were just kind of wander you know preachers do that a lot see we have all kinds of History can we find history we can find all kinds of History I can tell you my brother and sister I mentioned it in the church before we were in Seattle many years ago family wanted to take us to the what's the name of the museum thing there in Seattle Metropolitan Museum of Art and uh I was like dragging my heels I was like Jerry seriously come on you agreed to this I'm going to sit in the car and she's like are you kidding they already paid for the tickets you are not not's making her bossy or nothing but she's just like you are not sitting in the car they already paid if you knew how much they paid for these tickets you would really blow your top and I'm like okay Saints I tell you God knows what he's doing we go in there the first thing hanging from the ceiling inside the doors of this uh Seattle Metropolitan Museum of Art is an old rusty car with holes blown in it and plastic pipes sticking in every direction that is art we had a car like that on the back side of our place right there by the ravine what is so Artful about that and we went over here and there was this stuff not making fun of it it actually does take more Talent than one would think but here's these canvases and it looks like somebody just got a bunch of kids with paint balloons and went and they called it a masterpiece I think I'll get the kids to create some masterpieces probably at Brother sergey's house not mine but we rounded a corner Saints and here it was on loan from the Louvre I believe is in Paris France and here's all these statues and I started just going by them yeah but I stopped red one wait that's almost what's on this bronze plaque is verbatim of what brother Branham speaks man I turn around I go back to the very first of all these I walked by and I start reading them oh my they won't let you take a camera they won't let you take a piece of paper and an ink pen you can't take nothing in there if you are caught taking a picture they kick you out so I'm just reading it over and over again mentally absorbing this wow and I moved to the next one wow and the next one wow and they're all done with the tour and ready to go to a restaurant and I'm way lost back in here somewhere from one bronze plaque to the next just like I believe the message but I'm telling you here it is these people are talking about history and gods and this thing and that thing and what happened to this point of history and how they're doing this my brother and sister I didn't need that to believe but it tells me that every person in this world that goes through there and reads those has been witness to him to witness the word amen now if God can use a museum to witness the word how much more will the open book in flesh called the bride of Christ be a witness to this world Amen because she's walking in places they'll never take that you want to talk about something interesting so valuable so valuable that every one of these things was in a case and they have all the lasers with the security and everything is there and and you know I'm I wasn't born yesterday and I'm like that guy's got a gun under his coat and uh oh that guy right there yeah oh yeah that's how valuable it was to me but my brother and sister they hardly place any value on the open word but here is the bride revealed here is a treasure the word of God says that is immeasurable in value and you say what the word's talking about Christ that's right he's inside of me amen and so he is a major beyond measure and he's in you and I then we are a major beyond measure oh hallelujah how about we quit looking us for me I'm the bride I believe the message but poor me poor me poor me I am a measure of riches beyond belief Hallelujah and how did I figure that out it was contained in the volume of the book oh that's why the devil don't want us reading our Bible amen hallelujah all kinds of History all kinds of authors all kinds of stories all kinds of lessons encouragement correction revelation and how do you sum it up greatest love story greatest love story ever my brother and sister so when I ask you all of you read love stories amen I'll ask you again do any of you read love stories hallelujah amen they can be pretty interesting oh my I'm not sure I'm not sure if we would love some of these people that God loved it would take God I'm going to just bring it right home it's not personal and you know that but it would take God for some of you to love some of us right here we wouldn't have went out in the world and hunted each other up no sir if I had magnets I would show you what our reaction to each other would be the god came and we found something in the book and he said that is a part of my bride and you are a part of the bride and then all of a sudden when we recognize that oh drawn together and that's how we're compelled and Drawn to Christ amen we don't have to say oh we we sing the song Saints now don't misunderstand me tonight okay but we sing the song Draw Me nearer amen if you just read the word and you ask God for the Holy Ghost you won't need that it will draw you near amen it will will pull you like you've never been pulled before because the word is always attracted to the word oh let me move on we're running out of time tonight amen so it turns out this book is the record actually of the greatest love story ever and let me tell you how much he loves me let me tell you how much he loves you amen beyond the value of Heaven and Earth ten thousand worlds are you getting it do I need to repeat it anybody not catching that ten thousand World part um beyond our comprehension in other words amen you want to know what it is I've shared this with you before one time I had a pretty good calculator we had a scientific calculator and I sat down on the computer and went to the gross economies of the gross national product and just started the alphabetical you know in the United States is way at the end right the you part and I started adding up the gross national product of the Nations alphabetically I didn't even get this much down the page and the computer said um whatever its words were you've exceeded that was just this much down a page and there was like 38 pages Oh How He Loves you and me this bride is so special you see she's Glory beyond measure she's his chosen bride and I am so glad I gotta Live By Your Side Oh Hallelujah Saints if we just recognize that God has come and this was all in the volume of the book I'm sorry people can't read the book for what it is I'm sorry they can't see that just like if I can throw this out to you just like when people hear the little stories that brother Branham tells they don't see anything but a little orphan girl living with her cousins and a man decides she's a nice girl that's going to take her away they don't see the open book that's right they don't see the volume of what is being spoken they don't see the beauty of what it is and how that would encourage Sons and Daughters of God to be able to stand and oh my brother and sister actually not stand get down and scrub the floor amen get down and do the Dirty Work get down and live through all of the things of laodicea that we don't want to live in and we don't want to do and God said that's all right I'm coming for you I've got a promise for you I'm Coming For You hallelujah amen let's just go laughs oh let's see where am I amen invisible Union Brothers amen Hallelujah I just got so excited reading this oh that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word oh isn't that beautiful my brother and sister we're not just a people saying amen do we believe the prophet's words I don't think we'd be here tonight if we didn't amen we're not just saying we are a word bride but a prophet is here declaring and telling them amen when the flesh My Flesh your flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day my brother and sister this was 1965 and the plan of God's not stopping for nobody it's so much more today than it was when the prophet said it Hallelujah we don't need to add to it this is sufficient amen why it's culminating so fast out there in those deserts and things taking place that I couldn't even keep up with it we're near the coming of Jesus to be United with his church where the word becomes the word hmm thank you Lord call of the Holy Spirit you see my brother and sister it's not just a preacher's call it's not a prophet's call this is God's call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place I'd ought to get one of us some of us all of us to be able to say Thank You Lord thank you Lord that you're looking down on us I never did it in the first place now if God says you didn't do it and the devil says you did who you going to call a liar it's not a very hard decision if we think about it that way but if it's in a difficult day a hard struggle a time that things are not well in your life and your family etc etc and the Devil comes along and says you're not the bride and we'll even entertain that thought but if we'll just remember God said you never did it Amen in the first place amen you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son or daughter of God you're standing there washed Hallelujah and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God out of existence in God's mind that ought to make somebody tonight be a little happy and I'm not trying to just get you happy but I'm telling you this is what the devil doesn't want you to find in the book amen he wants you to get caught up when what's this and what's that and argue over baptisms and this is and that's and whatever what we need to do is find ourselves in the volume of the book and when we find ourselves in the book The Devil is going to have to sit back and say I don't know what to do with them now he hasn't been able to do away with this book he won't be able to do away with this book and the book is open and it's not a magic trick that something came out let me use you for an example amen something came out of the book oh they say that's just a spirit you're right it's a spirit it's his spirit amen anointed your spirit and you believe the word and the book being opened changed everything oh Hallelujah oh my is it okay to be excited tonight amen You're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtues sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride slash word amen amen my do you realize what this is like God could no more reject his word then he could quit being God amen Lord be like the Chipmunks [Music] more word give me more word I need more word so much word in US amen then when God says word come home we're gone I don't understand the physics of that I don't understand the physics of that amen but the prophet of God used a steel mill for an example and when that great magnet went over those steel filings couldn't say I don't want to go today amen they didn't have a choice in fact they had to bolt everything else down because even the denominations want to go that wasn't too brutal was it unadulterated bride that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love and it came out in the song surface they come out in prayers love Hallelujah let me be an attribute in fact you know what oh let me just put it this way we could preach at you you guys got to love one another how about we just get in the volume of the book and we'll find out that we are love amen and if I am love and you are loved we can't help but manifest love it won't be now Church you gotta love each other get over it you gotta love each other no get in the volume of the book and you will find that you are love oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm just excited beyond measure amen I hope praise the Lord amen sister vika come please amen I'll be some like locomotive or something that don't have breaks amen Hallelujah you love the Lord aren't you happy with what you're finding in the book I'm so happy with what I found in the volume of the book amen I I don't have to go and try to find something else I don't need somebody now I hope tonight you didn't take it like I was trying to Raw raw you I I've just been sitting on this bubbling over you've seen the kids little science fairs right where they make the little homemade out of craft paper and and paste and make the little volcano and then they put a Mento in there and they show you how volcano works well Hallelujah somebody dumped something it wasn't uh a soda pop or a Minto or something amen I just couldn't help but just let it off amen the wife you know I don't know what she thinks of me sometimes but you know God's gracious and you can just sit there just quiet you can eat supper you can talk about this or that inside you're just like I'm a thoroughbred the gate's fixing to open ain't nobody gonna catch me hey man I'm out of here Hallelujah I don't know if I'm really a thoroughbred but he is and he's in me so I'm gonna claim it amen and I'll tell you it just makes my heart so excited to know that the volume of the book has been poured in to you and I oh my we never thought we could have fit all of that in there that he fitted in there oh Hallelujah hey man I know it's rhetorical question but you love the Lord tonight Hallelujah 123 but a Gideon amen we got a moment to just sing a song or two hey man let's just stand up so we can just have some Liberty in our singing amen I know some of you are able to work sitting down I do sometimes but I'm telling you if you to watch me today you'd have thought he's a busy little Beaver amen if you ever see a guy with an extension ladder over his head walking out in the middle of a cornfield and all you can see is an extension ladder it looks pretty marvelous it's like wow extension ladder hovering but I'll tell you what it does all these brothers that are nice and fit and young you know they would have grabbed that ladder and just went across there where do you want it brother Paul I'll tell you what I look like this old man oh did I tell you it was in about four or five inches of mud but I tell you what as much as I want to quit I can't as much as the devil wants you to quit you can't amen and you do all of that just so that Showers of Blessings will fall on a corn crop amen you love the Lord tonight amen from glory to glory he's changing me oh changing me he's changing me his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of God shown to the world always changing he's changing me from the Earthly things to the Heavenly his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of God shown to the world let's sing it again from glory to glory he's changing me he's changing me he's changing me his likeness and image to perfect in

time ago I was actually sitting in a truck stop I believe that was Wells Nevada bored to death wishing I was home but I was headed in the wrong direction to go home there was horse race on the TV I'm eating some of their real healthy food out of the cabinet there and here's this horse race and here's this horse out there prancing around and the Handler he's getting jerked around and the jockey's having a hard time staying on it and the announcer is like yeah this horse is wasting the energy that he would need if he was going to win this race and he needs every bit of what's got and so we can pretty much discount him being a wimp and this horse is out there and they finally get him in the gate and and he backs out the gate and they get him back in the gate and so then the announcer's saying yes they're saying the next time that his nose touches the gate they're going to qual that good and so they got him in there rushed him in there his nose touched the gate they opened it and all the rest of them horses saw was dust [Music] and all the world's going to see of this bride who's been a little bit excited people just get nervous about that he's prancing around why don't he just stand still he's moving around what's wrong with him he's wasting the energy is he he's got more than enough energy amen this bride's got more than enough to take her in a Rapture she's got everything she needs she can do a little jump and a little shout and a little hand waving a lot of singing amen God will restore her strength Hallelujah I'm sorry about the poor analogy but I just remember that Hallelujah poor horse using his energy up man he had more energy than they ever knew this bride of Christ has got more energy than this world ever recognized amen they've shout they've screamed jumped up and down done whatever but that's not the kind of energy God placed in the bride amen hallelujah I have a maker he forms [Music] and before even time began my life was in his hand I'll leave it up
