[27:45] i felt on my heart sing a song today
[27:48] i didn't know which song to sing um
[27:52] that the lord wanted me to sing and then
[27:53] he laid this one on my heart
[27:55] and sometimes the lord does things
[27:57] backwards from what we think we think it
[27:59] would be
[27:59] current events would point you to a song
[28:02] and then you'd be led to sing that song
[28:04] it said i was
[28:04] led to sing a song and then i was
[28:06] pointed at this song and then i realized
[28:07] how fitting it is for today so

[28:11] practice so

[38:18] [Music]
[38:26] aren't you glad you can say amen to that
[38:29] hallelujah you know we're not going to
[38:31] talk about politics tonight but
[38:34] you know they they have a president has
[38:36] a state of the union speech everywhere
[38:39] i mean every year and and uh you know
[38:42] you can go back
[38:44] and uh if you'll just listen to the
[38:47] prophet
[38:47] you'll see that he gave us a state of
[38:50] our nation
[38:52] many years ago you know what holds
[38:56] tomorrow
[38:57] one crooked political office or another
[39:00] crooked

[39:07] my tomorrow and i know who is the king
[39:11] amen that was good brother chris thank
[39:13] you i was a little excited
[39:15] i know it didn't show this body's weary
[39:17] but my heart was like
[39:19] yes there's none greater
[39:22] than our god hallelujah he is the king
[39:25] of kings the lord of lords
[39:28] amen and nothing greater than him and
[39:31] that makes me excited hallelujah
[39:35] because otherwise we would all run to
[39:37] the bank and we would take what little
[39:39] cash we had
[39:40] we would bury it in a little ball
[39:43] canning jar in the backyard and we would
[39:46] try to figure out what's going to happen
[39:48] should i buy gold
[39:50] no don't buy gold the chinese are buying
[39:52] gold they're going to use it against us
[39:54] should we buy paper no the prophet of
[39:57] god said the time would come
[39:59] that the paper would fail oh my what are
[40:02] we going to buy let's buy dirt
[40:04] wait if you don't have money to pay the
[40:05] taxes they take the dirt away from you
[40:08] oh the list goes on and on but
[40:11] we can find security
[40:15] hallelujah aren't you glad we can find
[40:18] security we can find
[40:19] peace we can find confidence the prophet
[40:22] of god said where do we find that saints
[40:26] in the word which is
[40:29] jesus christ amen let's just stand as we
[40:32] go into the word i want to speak to you
[40:34] on preparations of the inner man when
[40:37] that
[40:38] which is made perfect now i take this
[40:41] from the scripture and i'm going to use
[40:44] this uh
[40:45] title in a slightly different way
[40:47] tonight just to
[40:48] draw your attention to some thoughts
[40:51] amen now remember jesus said
[40:53] that when he come he did not come to do
[40:55] away with the law that is the old
[40:57] testament
[40:58] but he come to magnify it to us
[41:02] now if you ever really want to see what
[41:05] something really
[41:06] is you must magnify it
[41:09] amen i've got a friend that's a good
[41:12] mechanic
[41:13] and he uses all kinds of tricks of the
[41:15] trade and
[41:16] he will take a mirror and he will put it
[41:19] down in something to see what he's doing
[41:22] then he will point his iphone at that
[41:25] and then because he's a little older he
[41:27] puts his magnifying glass
[41:29] on top of that and then he can tell you
[41:32] yep
[41:33] without ever pulling a bolt yep there's
[41:36] the problem
[41:37] you see to magnify that it doesn't
[41:40] matter that there's an image
[41:42] if you can't see it it doesn't matter
[41:45] that there's solution
[41:47] if you can't see it it doesn't matter
[41:50] if you have a fault
[41:54] if you can't see it
[41:58] amen seems like kind of a paradox to
[42:00] bring it that way right
[42:01] but the scripture says every man's right
[42:03] in his own eyes
[42:05] so help us lord reveal our faults
[42:09] our flaws and then have courage enough
[42:12] amen let's not be ashamed i was just
[42:14] talking to my father-in-law right before
[42:16] church brother kevin
[42:18] and we were having a lovely conversation
[42:20] you see the problem that happens many
[42:23] times saints
[42:24] is we're actually too proud
[42:28] for everyone to see us fail
[42:32] we will hide our weakness our failures
[42:35] our shortcomings will
[42:36] we'll do everything we can to hide that
[42:40] so that we wouldn't be ashamed in front
[42:42] of
[42:42] those we know of our weakness
[42:46] you see that's quite the opposite of
[42:48] what it should be we should have such
[42:50] liberty of who we are in jesus christ
[42:54] now you don't have to share every detail
[42:56] but we don't have to try and camouflage
[42:58] it
[42:59] amen my dad used to tell me you know we
[43:01] spent many many years
[43:03] uh you know raising hogs and my dad used
[43:06] to say
[43:06] son i don't care how much lipstick you
[43:09] put on that pig
[43:11] it's still a pig
[43:14] and so you know let's not bother to hide
[43:17] that
[43:17] but when that which is made perfect the
[43:20] scripture says has come let's turn into
[43:22] psalms
[43:23] 18 16 amen i i hope tonight this is a
[43:28] encouraging service for you uh we'll
[43:31] speak direct amen what i didn't realize
[43:35] when i caught coven
[43:36] was that i also caught a a uh blunt
[43:40] virus
[43:41] and uh so in that blunt virus it just
[43:45] everything just
[43:46] comes out amen so pray for me
[43:50] amen psalms 18 starting with verse 16.
[43:55] he sent from above he took me
[43:59] and he drew me out of many waters
[44:02] now we know what waters stands for right
[44:06] he delivered me from my strong enemy
[44:10] and from them which hated me for they
[44:13] were too strong for me
[44:15] they prevented me in the day of my
[44:18] calamity
[44:19] but the lord was my stay
[44:22] he brought me forth also into a large
[44:25] place
[44:26] he delivered me oh i love these words
[44:30] when i read this it just stirred my
[44:32] heart because
[44:34] he delighted in me
[44:38] oh my brother and sister we're not just
[44:40] some object
[44:42] right object that god said i want to
[44:44] possess that god doesn't have a hoarding
[44:46] problem
[44:48] right he brought me forth also into a
[44:51] large
[44:52] place he delivered me because he
[44:54] delighted in me
[44:56] the lord rewarded me according to my
[44:59] righteousness
[45:00] now we'll i'll just keep going amen
[45:03] according to the
[45:04] cleanliness of my hands hath he
[45:06] recompensed me
[45:07] for i have kept the ways of the lord and
[45:10] have not wickedly departed from my god
[45:13] for all his judgments were before me and
[45:15] i did not put away his statutes from me
[45:19] i was also upright before him
[45:22] and i kept myself from mine iniquity
[45:25] therefore hath the lord recompense me
[45:28] according to my righteousness according
[45:29] to the
[45:30] cleanliness of my hands with the
[45:32] merciful
[45:34] thou will show thyself merciful with an
[45:37] upright man that will show thyself
[45:40] upright with the pure thou sh
[45:43] wilt show thyself pure and with the
[45:46] froward
[45:47] thou wilt show thyself forward for
[45:51] thou wilt save the afflicted people
[45:54] but will bring down high looks
[45:58] for thou will light my candle
[46:02] the lord my god will enlighten my
[46:05] darkness
[46:07] for by thee i have run through a troop
[46:10] and by my god have i leaped over a wall
[46:14] i i'm sorry i'm just excited my heart
[46:16] just bubbling hallelujah
[46:18] amen people say well okay what's going
[46:20] on with this guy well let me tell you
[46:22] my candle's been lit the darkness has
[46:24] been pushed back
[46:25] i ran right through the middle of the
[46:28] troop amen i've leaped over the wall
[46:31] hallelujah that ought to be enough to
[46:33] get any son or daughter of god
[46:35] excited as for god his way is perfect
[46:40] the word of the lord is tried is a
[46:43] buckler to all those
[46:44] that trust in him it is god that girdeth
[46:48] me with strength
[46:49] and maketh my way perfect
[46:53] heavenly father we thank you for your
[46:54] word tonight just ask your father lead
[46:57] us through your word
[46:58] father we just desire to bring forth
[47:02] your word
[47:03] exactly lord in the way that you meant
[47:05] it
[47:06] not guessing father not surmising
[47:09] but lord we ask for your anointing to
[47:11] speak tonight
[47:12] your precious name we pray amen
[47:16] god bless you you may be seated
[47:18] hallelujah
[47:19] just remember those i don't care who or
[47:22] what circumstance those that are not
[47:23] with us tonight just lift them up in
[47:25] prayer amen
[47:27] now saints when we look at perfection
[47:30] often times it seems to be one of the
[47:32] greatest struggles
[47:33] is that if we uh are
[47:36] uh i've been doing a lot of studying uh
[47:40] in uh the intellectual way amen i've
[47:43] been looking at that uh
[47:44] what brother branham said about things
[47:46] about knowledge and uh
[47:48] intellectual and uh you know my brother
[47:50] and sister uh god give us
[47:52] and i thank the lord for that now not
[47:55] all of our iqs are equal to each other
[47:57] that's wonderful also god needs a
[48:00] diversity
[48:01] but god has given us an ability to take
[48:04] our bible to take the message uh take
[48:06] concordances and to map it out you might
[48:10] say
[48:10] so in an intellectual fashion we can see
[48:13] what the whole purpose is we can see why
[48:16] god did what he did we can follow all
[48:19] the chain of events and we can put that
[48:21] all together
[48:22] but my brother and sister without
[48:24] revelation
[48:26] it will never spark the soul to
[48:28] rapturing faith
[48:29] and so it's there that we look at this
[48:32] and now we don't
[48:33] focus entirely as it were just
[48:35] revelation revelation revelation
[48:37] but i will remind you i know you all
[48:39] know this but i will remind you that the
[48:41] prophet of god
[48:43] told you to pray for revelation so
[48:46] that was no small thing i believe when
[48:48] he encouraged us
[48:50] to uh uh take time out of our lives
[48:53] right to
[48:54] to all the needs that we have all the
[48:56] praise that we would
[48:58] have uh and he says you know i want you
[49:00] to pray for revelation
[49:02] and uh knowing that this is actually not
[49:05] revelation of the intellectual
[49:08] but this is revelation of the mystery of
[49:11] god
[49:11] which is christ in you and and so as we
[49:14] uh
[49:15] are are moved you might say by the word
[49:17] of god by the holy spirit
[49:19] we move forward into this revelation now
[49:22] this revelation will never
[49:23] produce a heady or high-minded people it
[49:26] will never produce a people who believe
[49:28] they are better
[49:29] in fact i i just kind of get ahead of
[49:31] myself
[49:32] but you will find my brother and sister
[49:34] that one of the greatest
[49:35] mysteries that is being revealed in the
[49:38] bride of christ today
[49:39] is the mystery that she recognizes that
[49:43] she without him is nothing
[49:46] and so in that what it is is creating a
[49:49] dependent
[49:50] people now in a world we live in today
[49:53] where everyone
[49:54] is striving to be independent it goes
[49:57] counter
[49:58] intuitive to the age or the spirit of
[50:00] the age that we live in
[50:02] but the holy spirit when it has
[50:04] preeminence
[50:05] in our lives that my brother and sister
[50:08] is when the mystery of god
[50:09] will be revealed in you and i amen so it
[50:13] is
[50:13] uh a beautiful thing uh we're not going
[50:16] to preach
[50:17] necessarily down that line tonight but
[50:19] uh you must understand that the
[50:21] fulfillment of this mystery
[50:24] is not whether you can explain the bible
[50:26] whether you can explain the message
[50:28] but whether you have given yourself to
[50:31] christ
[50:32] and he has possessed you as his
[50:35] portion amen now every husband every
[50:38] wife amen the word of god
[50:40] says that a man is not in control of his
[50:43] own body a woman's not control of her
[50:45] own body
[50:46] and the scripture says thus it is with
[50:48] christ and the church
[50:50] that we would come and as a body tonight
[50:52] i i hope you
[50:53] are with me as a body tonight we must be
[50:56] surrendered to our lord jesus christ
[50:59] amen
[51:00] now you look at this and often times we
[51:02] look at perfection
[51:04] i've heard many preachers preach
[51:06] perfection in different ways i've heard
[51:08] them preach that we will never be
[51:10] perfect
[51:10] they do put the quantifier of in this
[51:13] flesh
[51:13] but my brother and sister you see what
[51:15] is happening in sons and daughters of
[51:17] god are being moved by the holy spirit
[51:20] and we will not as it were conquer this
[51:22] flesh
[51:23] but we are no longer subject to this
[51:25] flesh now did you catch what i just said
[51:28] we will not conquer this flesh we will
[51:30] have things
[51:31] in his flesh to the day that we're
[51:33] either raptured or we go
[51:35] into the ground but my brother and
[51:37] sister we are no longer
[51:38] controlled by those things amen and so
[51:42] by god's grace now the prophet of god
[51:44] says you know
[51:45] that we come and by the holy ghost we
[51:48] conquer
[51:48] those things and they are taken and put
[51:51] to the back
[51:52] and our life can then shine forth for
[51:54] the glory of god
[51:56] now it took perfection to bring us
[52:00] forth perfect
[52:04] so perfection is already present
[52:07] amen it's present here tonight amen to
[52:11] bring
[52:11] us forth in perfection
[52:14] amen and you know you say but brother
[52:17] paul we have a lot of mistakes we have a
[52:19] lot of flaws
[52:20] we have a lot of things but my brother
[52:23] and sister
[52:24] i want you to also go into that and
[52:26] realize
[52:27] that when something is perfect it is
[52:30] completely correct or
[52:31] accurate so when you have the holy ghost
[52:34] amen you are then being moved
[52:38] out of uh the position that we are
[52:41] just flash that we are weak we are
[52:43] broken
[52:44] which is the religious spirit of the day
[52:46] that we live in
[52:47] is now basically declaring we're all
[52:49] broken and that's why i behave like i
[52:51] behave because i'm broken
[52:53] but my brother and sister the holy ghost
[52:55] comes and is moving a bride moving a
[52:57] people
[52:58] into a position where while the flesh is
[53:01] still
[53:01] here in the flesh is flesh yes well we
[53:04] can give all of our disclaimers
[53:06] but my brother and sister there is a
[53:08] people that the word of god
[53:10] is coming correct or accurate to them
[53:14] can we say amen to that i i push
[53:17] back kind of sometimes when we hear that
[53:19] deal well you know brother brown said
[53:21] better to have the rights
[53:22] uh spirit and the wrong doctrine than
[53:25] the right doctrine in the wrong spirit
[53:27] now i won't argue at all but i believe
[53:29] we're coming into a time that the holy
[53:31] ghost is coming down on a people
[53:33] and they will have both amen they will
[53:35] have the right spirit and they will have
[53:37] the right doctrine
[53:38] amen so as we'll look at this also
[53:42] it's having all the qualities you would
[53:44] want in that kind of a
[53:45] person there's where we're going to
[53:49] focus tonight
[53:51] the qualities one of the greatest
[53:54] qualities believe it or not now
[53:56] you might read it and come up with a
[53:57] different conclusion i won't argue with
[53:59] you
[54:00] but one of the greatest qualities the
[54:02] prophet of god laid out in this bride
[54:04] is that she would be able to say amen to
[54:07] every
[54:08] word of god
[54:11] you can't have a bride
[54:14] who constantly disagrees with her
[54:17] husband
[54:18] and have harmony
[54:22] hear me sisters
[54:25] i said constantly disagrees
[54:30] so nobody misunderstand
[54:33] but you see what the word is doing is
[54:36] bringing forth
[54:37] equality out of a people who
[54:42] maybe didn't even know god never went to
[54:44] church
[54:46] i i just talked to a man the other day
[54:49] he's married to a lovely lady
[54:54] she grew up never went church doesn't
[54:56] know what church is it's just
[54:58] foreign most of us that's foreign
[55:02] right we've been in church so much
[55:05] sometimes we've been in church so much
[55:06] that we
[55:07] actually come to the place we don't
[55:09] really respect the house of god like we
[55:11] should we
[55:12] have little things we can so to speak
[55:14] have a meltdown or a tantrum or
[55:16] this or that and the behaviors and and
[55:19] uh uh
[55:20] you know it it it can become just common
[55:23] to us
[55:25] but you see this word is coming and it's
[55:28] bringing
[55:29] out of a people equality
[55:34] now i didn't bring all the quotes that i
[55:36] studied uh
[55:37] i probably should have but uh you know
[55:40] probably shouldn't have
[55:41] and so but you look at this my brother
[55:44] and sister
[55:45] i want you to focus tonight just for a
[55:47] moment
[55:48] on that quality of what is in you
[55:52] that causes you to come back and say
[55:56] amen or so be it to
[55:57] all of the word of god you know it has
[56:00] to hurt sometimes
[56:03] it's not always comfortable when we look
[56:06] in the mirror we see our flesh we look
[56:08] in the word we see the spirit man
[56:10] see that's what the word is actually
[56:12] trying to do my brother and sister
[56:14] because if we look in the word and all
[56:16] we see is our flesh man we say
[56:18] sorry but we go out like the worshiper
[56:20] who offers the lamb
[56:22] and then has a whole year of his old
[56:25] fleshly behavior before he must come and
[56:27] deal with it again
[56:29] god isn't trying to bring this flesh
[56:31] subject
[56:32] god is bringing the spirit subject and
[56:35] when the spirit
[56:36] is then subject to the word the spirit
[56:39] then will bring the flesh subject but if
[56:42] we turn that around we can have
[56:44] a bunch of people who conform until
[56:47] they don't conform any longer
[56:56] amen
[56:58] so i think we would agree tonight that
[57:00] we struggle to
[57:02] in our human outlook to see perfection
[57:05] amen those of you didn't say amen
[57:08] i'll say amen for you now as
[57:12] we look here in matthew 5 48
[57:15] he says be therefore perfect
[57:18] even as your father which is in heaven
[57:21] is perfect
[57:22] now god would not make that kind of
[57:24] request out of you and i unless he had
[57:26] already provided the way
[57:28] for us to be perfect amen he's not going
[57:32] to leave us out here
[57:33] a frustrated people always
[57:36] longing for something that might bring
[57:38] us to this state
[57:40] and sooner or later our own reasoning
[57:43] and emotion and strength will say not
[57:46] possible therefore i will not try
[57:48] so god has created a a pathway
[57:52] for us to be perfect just as our father
[57:56] is perfect
[57:57] and so whenever life gets difficult
[58:00] when we get into the midst of the battle
[58:03] we might be down in the bottom of the
[58:05] valley
[58:05] my brother and sister and it seems like
[58:08] that you have made mistake after a
[58:09] mistake
[58:10] i want you to come back and look at this
[58:12] word and remember that god has already
[58:15] provided the way for you and i
[58:17] to be perfect amen for you and i to be
[58:21] of the quality of character
[58:24] amen to have the qualities that he would
[58:27] want
[58:28] in this kind of person which is the
[58:30] bride
[58:31] amen so he's looking for a bride now
[58:34] we a couple sundays ago were reading and
[58:38] he is talking about uh michelangelo the
[58:42] statue of moses
[58:43] and how that that chip even though not
[58:46] replaced is still
[58:47] a part of that and how that we taken
[58:50] from christ
[58:51] will always be a part of him now my
[58:54] brother and sister
[58:55] they don't have any museum for the chip
[58:59] from the knee of moses
[59:03] because the prophet of god said that
[59:05] flaw is what made that a masterpiece
[59:08] it was that inspiration that come
[59:11] and brought that made it the masterpiece
[59:15] so as god is working on you and i my
[59:17] brother and sister
[59:18] he is bringing us to a place as we have
[59:21] been
[59:21] taken from him my brother and sister
[59:24] that
[59:24] we would not be perfect without him he
[59:27] would not be perfect
[59:29] in that sense without us do you
[59:31] understand what i'm saying
[59:33] so never look at this as something that
[59:34] is insurmountable
[59:36] this should never be preached as
[59:38] something that would be like you guys
[59:40] are not perfect you're not good enough
[59:42] but look at this as knowing that god has
[59:45] already
[59:46] provided a way for you to be perfect
[59:48] seems how he asks you to be
[59:50] now as we look at this something that
[59:53] insurmountable my brother and sister
[59:55] very few will try something that seems
[59:58] like it is
[59:59] unconquerable uh have no ability to do
[1:00:03] many times i remember reading a story
[1:00:05] these young men it's not
[1:00:06] uh listed into the books like uh everest
[1:00:10] and
[1:00:10] and mckinley and some of these other
[1:00:12] famous mountains
[1:00:14] but uh in south america there was
[1:00:17] a rock that was there in the andes and
[1:00:20] it basically was just a sheer pinnacle
[1:00:23] of rock
[1:00:24] and uh there's nothing there there's no
[1:00:28] talus there's no
[1:00:29] slopes there's no draws and in many
[1:00:32] portions of it
[1:00:33] no cracks even and these two young men
[1:00:38] said you know what nobody's ever climbed
[1:00:40] that
[1:00:41] it's not listed amongst the great
[1:00:43] mountains of the world
[1:00:45] but it is something that was viewed as
[1:00:47] insurmountable
[1:00:50] and they were convinced they free
[1:00:52] climbed it on their first attempt up
[1:00:54] into an area and that
[1:00:56] they saw uh what did that i never
[1:00:58] pronounced it right pittance
[1:01:02] batons you know the things they drive in
[1:01:04] the rock if i'm mispronouncing it
[1:01:06] and they're scattered all over the face
[1:01:08] of this
[1:01:10] but you see my brother and sister you
[1:01:13] never trust
[1:01:14] another man's revelation
[1:01:17] you never hang your life on another
[1:01:20] man's revelation
[1:01:23] and so as they were there on the
[1:01:24] mountain that they got to that point
[1:01:27] they realized how difficult it was going
[1:01:29] to be to climb it was face to face
[1:01:32] but you see it's interesting in the
[1:01:34] mountaineering world
[1:01:37] a true mountaineer knowing that he would
[1:01:39] not trust
[1:01:40] someone else's deal unless put in by
[1:01:42] someone he trusted
[1:01:44] they then quit trying to climb it and
[1:01:47] they started removing
[1:01:48] all of these previously installed
[1:01:51] revelations
[1:01:56] you see that's one of the most difficult
[1:01:57] things my brother and sister
[1:02:00] is for us to stop
[1:02:03] and take the time to remove everything
[1:02:07] out of our life
[1:02:10] oftentimes it's our human nature to say
[1:02:12] okay and move on
[1:02:14] but these men knew that someday somebody
[1:02:17] would try to climb that and they would
[1:02:18] trust one of those and they would die
[1:02:20] because it was not anchored correctly
[1:02:22] in the rock are you with me tonight
[1:02:25] so they take all this time and remove
[1:02:27] them and not to
[1:02:28] to focus on that but ultimately they
[1:02:31] climb this
[1:02:32] all the way to the top and and they make
[1:02:34] that
[1:02:35] and then the one man when he looked over
[1:02:40] he said i actually felt fear for the
[1:02:41] first time in my life
[1:02:44] because he remembered how tiny the hand
[1:02:47] holds in the footholds were
[1:02:51] you see my brother and sister sometimes
[1:02:53] we just never been
[1:02:55] meant to go back down the way we came up
[1:02:59] god wants us to just keep climbing
[1:03:02] keep climbing higher and higher not
[1:03:06] trusting what someone else says not
[1:03:07] looking to everyone else not that this
[1:03:09] is insurmountable
[1:03:11] ultimately after them because it's the
[1:03:13] nature of man
[1:03:14] others climbed it because kind of that
[1:03:18] if they can do it i can do it too but
[1:03:21] you see
[1:03:21] this perfection is not insurmountable
[1:03:26] we have the book we have this pattern
[1:03:29] that clearly shows us
[1:03:32] how to accomplish it my brother and
[1:03:35] sister sometimes i think we don't spend
[1:03:37] enough time looking at the pattern
[1:03:40] you imagine if brother paul was sewing
[1:03:42] dresses for you sisters
[1:03:47] my oh my i've never been one i i could
[1:03:50] probably hold that pattern down this
[1:03:52] would be brother paul's approach
[1:03:53] i can just i don't need to pin this
[1:03:55] pattern down i can just hold it down and
[1:03:57] i'll cut around it
[1:03:59] and you sisters would show up in church
[1:04:01] and you'd have a caller up by one ear
[1:04:03] and the other collar would be on your
[1:04:04] collarbone
[1:04:05] one sleeve would be longer than the
[1:04:07] other wait you wouldn't show up in that
[1:04:09] would you
[1:04:13] but you see sometimes a convoluted word
[1:04:15] of god would be dressing the bride of
[1:04:17] christ in such a nature
[1:04:19] because we never i hope you get this
[1:04:21] because we never
[1:04:23] pinned the word down
[1:04:27] are you with me are you understanding
[1:04:28] it's the pattern of our life it's a
[1:04:30] pattern of who we
[1:04:31] are amen it should not be willy-nilly
[1:04:33] that we're going to just go this way and
[1:04:35] we're going to go that way and we're
[1:04:36] going to do this
[1:04:37] my brother and sister the prophet of god
[1:04:39] he showed us very clearly everything
[1:04:41] going back to the word
[1:04:43] we need to pin it down we need to and if
[1:04:45] it doesn't fit in the pattern my brother
[1:04:48] and sister
[1:04:48] don't go cutting your life out to fit
[1:04:51] that
[1:04:52] amen unless the word is there amen let
[1:04:55] me just clarify that i kind of my brain
[1:04:56] just jumped a thought
[1:04:58] jump to cog when you come to the word my
[1:05:00] brother and sister
[1:05:01] you follow that pattern perfectly
[1:05:04] but when you come to something that
[1:05:06] doesn't fit the pattern
[1:05:08] of the word don't try and modify that
[1:05:10] pattern to fit
[1:05:12] go back to the original pattern go back
[1:05:15] to what
[1:05:15] the word of god is amen we have the book
[1:05:19] and the pattern is this and you know
[1:05:21] what's so beautiful
[1:05:22] my brother and sister while i look in
[1:05:24] here now my name is
[1:05:26] actually as far as paul goes is in the
[1:05:27] book but you understand what i'm saying
[1:05:29] i look in here and i can't read my name
[1:05:32] as it were directly and the prophet of
[1:05:35] god says you know
[1:05:36] maybe our name that's in that book isn't
[1:05:39] our earthly name
[1:05:40] but it doesn't matter because god knows
[1:05:42] where to find you
[1:05:44] amen and while we identify with our
[1:05:46] earthly name
[1:05:48] god knows who you are and the fact is is
[1:05:50] we can look in the book
[1:05:52] and see by the nature of what god is
[1:05:54] calling you and i to be
[1:05:56] we can recognize our name is in that
[1:05:59] book amen not
[1:06:00] just the book meaning the bible but the
[1:06:02] book of life or lamb's book of life
[1:06:04] because what is in there the pattern of
[1:06:07] that has come out by revelation
[1:06:09] and is now creating a bride after the
[1:06:13] image of the perfect one
[1:06:16] amen because she must be able as it were
[1:06:19] to sidle right up to him to be perfectly
[1:06:23] part of him
[1:06:24] no conflict no no obstruction and so
[1:06:28] she has been malmolded by the word
[1:06:31] amen now look my brother and sister this
[1:06:33] is a little tough sometimes we struggle
[1:06:35] with this
[1:06:36] i look at it sometimes you meet the
[1:06:37] nicest of people
[1:06:39] you meet people that are just good solid
[1:06:41] christian behavior
[1:06:43] but my brother and sister you recognize
[1:06:45] that you won't
[1:06:46] go in the rapture and i'm gonna make
[1:06:48] this real broad so we're not saying we
[1:06:50] are and nobody else is
[1:06:52] you won't go in the rapture unless you
[1:06:55] are
[1:06:55] a perfect fit to the word that was there
[1:07:00] recorded in the lamb's book of life now
[1:07:03] you realize that word
[1:07:05] oh this'll stumble some was you and i
[1:07:10] see that's what's recorded in the lamb's
[1:07:11] book of life
[1:07:13] amen but it was the word that was
[1:07:15] recorded in the book
[1:07:16] amen so what was it god already looking
[1:07:19] down through time and eternity
[1:07:21] he didn't look at you as a blob of
[1:07:23] humanity
[1:07:24] he looked at you as the word made
[1:07:27] manifest in
[1:07:28] flesh in this generation
[1:07:31] amen he was looking at the word with
[1:07:34] arms and legs and feet and a voice and a
[1:07:37] mind
[1:07:37] and a soul amen and he says there's my
[1:07:40] word
[1:07:42] he didn't say there's a human and i'll
[1:07:44] try to save them
[1:07:45] he said that's my word and they are
[1:07:48] recorded
[1:07:49] in the lamb's book of life i wrote their
[1:07:51] name down of who they
[1:07:52] are now the prophet of god said you'll
[1:07:56] be surprised who's there and who's not
[1:07:58] so let's never be judgmental
[1:08:00] what we should do is be sincere and say
[1:08:02] lord wash me
[1:08:04] make my faults and failures known to me
[1:08:06] lord
[1:08:07] that i might repent of them don't let me
[1:08:10] just say well
[1:08:11] everything's well all is well we should
[1:08:15] have a degree
[1:08:16] my brother and sister of peace of who we
[1:08:18] are amen
[1:08:19] right we should find comfort in who we
[1:08:22] are according to the word
[1:08:23] but never let yourself become complacent
[1:08:27] never come to the place i believe it's
[1:08:29] settled i don't need to do anything
[1:08:31] let your heart be just stirred enough
[1:08:34] that you continually come back to the
[1:08:36] throne
[1:08:37] of grace and say lord if there's
[1:08:39] anything
[1:08:41] lord help me forgive me lord anything
[1:08:43] that would hinder
[1:08:44] anything lord that would keep you from
[1:08:48] moving freely
[1:08:52] and you see i'm trying tonight not
[1:08:55] trying it's my intention tonight to
[1:08:57] preach this optimistically
[1:08:58] because you see this is what the book
[1:09:00] says
[1:09:01] will come forth in this generation my
[1:09:04] brother and sister the word is producing
[1:09:06] it
[1:09:06] the word is producing exactly what the
[1:09:09] word said it would produce in this
[1:09:11] generation
[1:09:12] and i can say thank you lord hallelujah
[1:09:15] hallelujah amen the names in the book
[1:09:19] and we've been encouraged by the prophet
[1:09:21] to declare that my name is in the book
[1:09:24] right he told us to read our name into
[1:09:26] the bible
[1:09:27] hallelujah and when i get to the sides
[1:09:29] of the pit
[1:09:30] i don't see any anointing to say i must
[1:09:33] be there
[1:09:34] also but when i see they're talking
[1:09:36] about standing before the throne of
[1:09:38] almighty god
[1:09:39] something inside of me something starts
[1:09:43] bubbling up
[1:09:43] something starts reaching out something
[1:09:45] starts claiming
[1:09:47] oh what is that that's anointing off of
[1:09:50] that perfect word
[1:09:52] that recorded you and i in the book now
[1:09:55] james
[1:09:57] um just second i might be just second
[1:10:02] hold up everyone
[1:10:05] yeah no let's go back lord grace lord
[1:10:08] grace okay
[1:10:08] i'm sorry about that brother alex
[1:10:14] there you are for the worship coming
[1:10:16] every year was a continual about every
[1:10:18] year went back and you had to come the
[1:10:19] next year the same desire
[1:10:21] in his heart my brother and sister
[1:10:24] i'm going to look real blunt
[1:10:29] i'm not going to say much
[1:10:35] true revelation
[1:10:40] causes us to do something absolutely
[1:10:46] we cannot just sit down when the
[1:10:50] true word has been revealed that's right
[1:10:53] in influences brother branham talks
[1:10:56] about several different examples he
[1:10:58] talks about peter
[1:11:00] he talks about the woman at the well
[1:11:03] that when they caught
[1:11:04] who he was it put them into action
[1:11:09] something had to happen there was not a
[1:11:11] complacency
[1:11:13] but you see my brother and sister
[1:11:16] i would dare to say politely
[1:11:20] that we come back the next year we have
[1:11:24] the same desire
[1:11:25] in our hearts
[1:11:28] many of us have went from year to year
[1:11:31] without deliverance
[1:11:34] now look i'm i'm really honestly
[1:11:37] mean this from my heart tonight it isn't
[1:11:39] always your fault
[1:11:45] sin in the church prophet of god shows
[1:11:48] us sometimes sin in the church
[1:11:50] binds the spirit of god moving
[1:11:54] sometimes it's not the right season
[1:11:55] we'll touch on that a little bit later
[1:11:57] concerning samson
[1:12:00] god's got a plan god knows what's
[1:12:02] happening but you see my brother and
[1:12:03] sister don't read this as somebody else
[1:12:05] we can read this as us but when he made
[1:12:09] one sacrifice by himself every sin every
[1:12:13] desire of sin
[1:12:14] everything was taken from the man's
[1:12:15] heart and he stands perfected in the
[1:12:18] sight of god
[1:12:19] not by what he done see all of those
[1:12:22] offerings all of those sacrifices all of
[1:12:25] those i'm sorry lord
[1:12:26] didn't take away the desire
[1:12:29] you see now the reason i'm bringing
[1:12:33] let me just go on let me go on and he
[1:12:36] stands perfected in the sight of god not
[1:12:38] by what he'd done
[1:12:39] but what jesus done for him and he
[1:12:42] accepted the sacrifice of the lord jesus
[1:12:44] christ
[1:12:45] oh what a marvelous things friends
[1:12:48] amen now my brother and sister the
[1:12:50] reason i put this quote here and i want
[1:12:52] to expound on it for just a moment
[1:12:54] is you see when we catch this revelation
[1:12:57] that it is not what we done amen but
[1:13:01] what he
[1:13:02] done when we can start to look into the
[1:13:04] word and realize
[1:13:06] that it was by his desire to us
[1:13:10] amen he found pleasure in you and i
[1:13:14] you know what it's like when you have
[1:13:15] those that you just you know
[1:13:17] if you sit down and it's not a big deal
[1:13:19] we as humans get offended by such but
[1:13:21] you know there just be someone that you
[1:13:24] just you know maybe a couple that you
[1:13:26] want to sit down maybe just a wife or a
[1:13:28] friend
[1:13:28] and you just really enjoy that company
[1:13:31] and so if someone says you know if you
[1:13:33] was gonna just sit on the deck and watch
[1:13:35] the sunset
[1:13:36] who would you put here and and if you
[1:13:38] say you know your
[1:13:39] best friend your wife will be offended
[1:13:46] but do you understand what it's like to
[1:13:48] really desire
[1:13:50] to have fellowship with someone amen i
[1:13:53] mean from the heart
[1:13:55] yearning fellowship
[1:14:02] you see what happens
[1:14:07] when we realize that the only way we'll
[1:14:09] ever
[1:14:10] ever ever fulfill this
[1:14:14] is that deep deep deep relationship
[1:14:18] with our lord amen nothing shallow you
[1:14:21] know here
[1:14:21] a sunday or two ago i was talking about
[1:14:23] using for an example
[1:14:25] a husband and a wife in a relationship
[1:14:27] the wife will never get what she wants
[1:14:29] by putting her husband
[1:14:30] off at arm's reach or even beyond that
[1:14:34] but if she really wants to get the most
[1:14:36] out of her husband
[1:14:37] in the sense of maybe uh uh
[1:14:40] i'm digging a hole
[1:14:45] you understand what i'm saying
[1:14:49] what does she do now i'm not talking
[1:14:51] about a wife that's a gold digger
[1:14:54] i'm talking in a spiritual principle
[1:14:56] here what does she do when she wants
[1:14:59] something
[1:15:00] you reel your husband in you get just as
[1:15:03] close to him as you can
[1:15:06] see that's where the real difference is
[1:15:08] made not in the distance
[1:15:10] between them amen you know i had a
[1:15:13] friend one time he says well you know
[1:15:15] they say absence makes the heart grow
[1:15:17] fonder
[1:15:18] he said looking in my wife's eyes every
[1:15:20] night is what makes me fond
[1:15:23] and i thought it was pretty cute because
[1:15:25] he's got a really sweet wife amen
[1:15:27] lovely lovely lovely believers but look
[1:15:30] at this my brother and sister
[1:15:31] how it is now we're looking at what he
[1:15:34] has done
[1:15:35] and so we stand perfected in the sight
[1:15:38] of god
[1:15:39] not by what we have done but what he has
[1:15:42] done and that's really to sum that down
[1:15:44] that's why i brought that out
[1:15:46] amen now let's look at james 7 1 17
[1:15:49] every good gift and every perfect gift
[1:15:51] is from above cometh down from the
[1:15:53] father of life
[1:15:54] who in whom there is no variableness
[1:15:56] neither shadow of turning thank you lord
[1:15:58] of his own will he begot he us with the
[1:16:01] word of truth
[1:16:04] amen oh look at this my brother and
[1:16:05] sister look at this
[1:16:07] of his own will he
[1:16:11] come down to a barber shop
[1:16:14] he come down to uh you know wherever it
[1:16:18] is
[1:16:18] of his own will
[1:16:22] god was not under no obligation my
[1:16:24] brother and sister it was his own
[1:16:26] will that he come down made a claim and
[1:16:29] put your name on that book
[1:16:31] oh hallelujah i i get excited to think
[1:16:34] about that
[1:16:35] my brother and sister how many people
[1:16:37] they are
[1:16:38] on the on the face of the earth how many
[1:16:40] are here in america
[1:16:41] and god says you know i'm choosing you
[1:16:45] of his own will be got he us with the
[1:16:48] word of truth not just
[1:16:50] any old word that we should be kind of
[1:16:53] first fruits
[1:16:55] oh this is just you know some of this we
[1:16:57] all know it we've heard it preached but
[1:16:59] i it makes me excited to hear it again
[1:17:00] and again my brother
[1:17:02] and sister the law of the first fruits
[1:17:04] is so incredible
[1:17:06] because it took perfection
[1:17:10] to make us perfect amen
[1:17:13] the law of the first fruit says that
[1:17:16] perfection
[1:17:18] those who follow will be
[1:17:21] of the same amen
[1:17:33] wherefore my beloved brother and let
[1:17:34] every man be swift to hear slow to speak
[1:17:36] slow to wrath
[1:17:37] for the wrath of man worketh not the
[1:17:39] righteousness of god
[1:17:41] you know that that can be an issue we
[1:17:43] all get upset over something sometime
[1:17:45] we don't want to be you know
[1:17:49] pharisees about this
[1:17:52] but my brother and sister when someone's
[1:17:54] been in the word of god for many years
[1:17:57] and they have a light switch for a
[1:17:59] temper
[1:18:01] something's missing
[1:18:05] this cannot bring about the
[1:18:07] righteousness of god
[1:18:08] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[1:18:11] superfluity of naughtiness
[1:18:13] receive the meekness of the engrafted
[1:18:14] word which is able to save your souls
[1:18:17] but be doers of the word not hearers
[1:18:19] only deceiving your own selves
[1:18:21] you see my brother and sister the word
[1:18:23] of god and i'm not trying to circumvent
[1:18:24] the word of god
[1:18:25] but the word of god says that they would
[1:18:27] come and they would be men
[1:18:28] that would deceive the very elect if it
[1:18:30] was possible did you realize my brother
[1:18:32] and sister
[1:18:33] that those men are not deceiving you
[1:18:40] they are taking the deceptive word
[1:18:45] but they don't force it down your throat
[1:18:50] they're laying the deceptive word on the
[1:18:53] dinner table
[1:18:56] for you to partake of
[1:18:59] of your own free
[1:19:02] will people are like i'm so afraid of
[1:19:06] being deceived
[1:19:08] get in the word i don't care
[1:19:11] what deceptive word they lay on the
[1:19:14] dinner table
[1:19:17] if you're filled with the holy ghost
[1:19:20] you're going to look at that and say
[1:19:21] sorry
[1:19:22] that doesn't wet my appetite
[1:19:30] come on i'm not trying to twist the word
[1:19:33] don't misunderstand me
[1:19:34] but you see people will deceive
[1:19:36] themselves because there must be
[1:19:38] something in you
[1:19:39] my brother and sister let me just put it
[1:19:41] this way to you if you
[1:19:43] are one that has to see wmb
[1:19:47] on everything that you read before you
[1:19:49] believe it there's something wrong
[1:19:53] because the word of god rings true this
[1:19:56] is the prophet's words you can study it
[1:19:58] i'm i'm not trying to drag something out
[1:20:00] out of the dark there's something inside
[1:20:03] of the bride of christ which a prophet
[1:20:05] of god
[1:20:06] said which is the word which is
[1:20:09] christ himself is down in the believer
[1:20:15] and when he hears the word there's
[1:20:18] something
[1:20:19] in him that says amen to that word
[1:20:24] but we got a syndrome in the world today
[1:20:29] that unless whatever you said they've
[1:20:31] got a message

[1:20:35] number they can't say amen to it

[1:20:43] them
[1:20:44] i'm not honestly please trust me but you
[1:20:47] see my brother and sister there's got to
[1:20:48] be a word
[1:20:50] that is inside of you to respond to the
[1:20:54] word that is coming
[1:20:55] and the prophet of god tied that
[1:20:56] together a deep calleth to the deep
[1:21:00] there must be something there he said to
[1:21:03] respond
[1:21:05] oh come on you see the problem is is
[1:21:08] people have got to the point they're

[1:23:48] there's nothing
[1:23:49] left for this nation but judgment
[1:23:54] but if we get trump it'll all be better
[1:23:59] no sir it might be better but my brother
[1:24:02] and sister
[1:24:04] we also know by the word of god that
[1:24:05] everything has an appointed time
[1:24:08] there's a time and a season for
[1:24:10] everything
[1:24:12] and i don't care who sits in that office
[1:24:15] whatever direction that is i don't care

[1:24:29] who's your senator who's your president
[1:24:33] you see my brother and sister what we
[1:24:35] got to do is go to revelations 19
[1:24:38] 7 8 9 and get ready we don't need to
[1:24:41] look at the politics we don't get round
[1:24:43] up who's doing this and what and what's
[1:24:45] the deficit
[1:24:45] no the prophet of god already warned you
[1:24:48] this nation
[1:24:49] is bankrupt long ago
[1:24:52] amen and the word of god tells us that
[1:24:54] whatever is done in secret
[1:24:56] must be made open so we're going to see
[1:24:58] way more corruption
[1:24:59] we're going to see i don't care who the
[1:25:00] president is you're going to see way
[1:25:02] more corruption you're going to see all
[1:25:03] of this stuff boiling over my brother
[1:25:05] and sister
[1:25:06] because the word says so amen
[1:25:14] crossface cancer age we're now just
[1:25:15] before time takes place we watch the
[1:25:17] pyramid
[1:25:18] it's built like this but you notice the
[1:25:20] headstone was never put on the pyramid
[1:25:21] did you ever think of that
[1:25:23] you got a dollar bill in your pocket
[1:25:25] look what it says the great seal the
[1:25:26] pyramid
[1:25:27] and look above it the stone the
[1:25:29] headstone was never found why
[1:25:31] the headstone was rejected christ look
[1:25:34] down here in the age of luther
[1:25:36] justification
[1:25:37] plenty of room here follow this
[1:25:40] don't just read the words plenty of room
[1:25:44] the pyramid down here with luther
[1:25:47] plenty of room
[1:25:50] luther smoked a cigar and drank beer
[1:25:54] well praise the lord if luther did it i
[1:25:55] can do it
[1:26:00] follow the pyramid just to confess
[1:26:03] christ meant to have your head chopped
[1:26:05] off and when they come out of paganism
[1:26:07] to have your head well you'd be
[1:26:08] executed for the very witness of saying
[1:26:11] you was a christian
[1:26:13] luther then what did it do it heaps up
[1:26:16] now to the minority coming down
[1:26:18] closer what is next
[1:26:21] sanctification then he was called a
[1:26:24] fanatic a holy roller or something
[1:26:26] that's wesley's age what happened next
[1:26:27] then come the pentecostal
[1:26:29] baptism of the holy ghost still the
[1:26:31] church got smaller now look at this my
[1:26:33] brother and sister
[1:26:34] the age of the the domination you might
[1:26:38] say of christianity is actually fading
[1:26:40] research says that uh uh people they say
[1:26:43] well our children are all going away
[1:26:45] wait we're the adults they're out there
[1:26:46] too
[1:26:48] but the church getting in a minority now
[1:26:51] you look at this and this is always
[1:26:52] rough to swallow
[1:26:54] and i used to try to think well praise
[1:26:58] the lord our little group
[1:26:59] we don't have three kinds of believers
[1:27:00] here
[1:27:03] and maybe we don't tonight so don't
[1:27:05] misunderstand
[1:27:06] but you see wherever it is this spirit
[1:27:10] is there trying one to interfere
[1:27:13] some wavering back and forth
[1:27:17] and some sold out hallelujah doesn't it
[1:27:20] feel good to be sold out

[1:27:34] thousand three hundred thousand three
[1:27:35] hundred and five three hundred five
[1:27:36] three hundred five

[1:27:57] no one can contest it you just bought a
[1:28:00] corn chopper sister nadia
[1:28:06] look what the prophet of god says here
[1:28:08] hope you guys get this i got so excited
[1:28:11] then come the pentecostal baptism holy
[1:28:13] ghost still the church got smaller
[1:28:15] and now it goes on until it's got to
[1:28:17] such a perfect place
[1:28:19] until when the headstone finally comes
[1:28:23] it'll fit so perfect
[1:28:27] it won't be brother trevor get the rock
[1:28:30] saw
[1:28:32] brother chris bring that four bit and a
[1:28:35] sledgehammer

[1:28:41] sister nadia she's good she smiles
[1:28:44] what is it it's going to create such a
[1:28:46] perfect bride
[1:28:48] that when that headstone christ comes
[1:28:50] down
[1:28:51] he won't be over there trying to rock it
[1:28:53] this way and trying to rock it that way
[1:28:55] and try and pull it here
[1:28:56] to make it fit that's right there's
[1:28:58] going to be a church there's going to be
[1:29:00] a bride there's going to be a people
[1:29:01] that have so submitted themselves to the
[1:29:04] word of god
[1:29:05] oh lord for me mold me make me lord if
[1:29:08] you've got a chip you got to grind
[1:29:09] you're going to do whatever you're going
[1:29:10] to do lord
[1:29:11] i want you to fit perfect in my life i
[1:29:14] don't need to
[1:29:15] justify my behaviors and my whatevers
[1:29:18] and my habits
[1:29:20] lord i don't need to justify that just
[1:29:22] mold me
[1:29:24] then you'll fit so perfect
[1:29:28] i was on that pyramid and i got up and
[1:29:30] every seam was so perfect till i got to
[1:29:32] the headstone and
[1:29:33] looks like they used a cement truck to
[1:29:35] fill the gaps
[1:29:37] no that's not the kind of bride god's
[1:29:39] calling he's calling a bride that has
[1:29:41] just stayed there and submitted herself
[1:29:44] and the word has shaped her and cut
[1:29:47] and molded until when the headstone
[1:29:51] finally comes it'll fit so
[1:29:53] perfect the church will have such a
[1:29:55] perfect
[1:29:56] shape
[1:29:59] oh come on saint you know i don't even
[1:30:01] have to preach this out you guys know
[1:30:02] what i'm talking about
[1:30:04] this church won't be over a tangent over
[1:30:06] here
[1:30:07] she won't be in a tangent over here she
[1:30:09] won't be over here well i know this
[1:30:11] isn't in the scripture but a friend of a
[1:30:13] friend of the prophet said
[1:30:16] come on that stuff is happening right
[1:30:18] here in this day
[1:30:19] people are outside the written word of
[1:30:21] god because a friend
[1:30:23] of a friend or whatever was with the
[1:30:26] prophet
[1:30:28] come on my brother and sister you'll
[1:30:29] find no quote nowhere that will support
[1:30:31] that but i can give you literally
[1:30:33] hundreds of
[1:30:34] quotes where the prophet of god says
[1:30:35] take it back to the word
[1:30:38] amen i want to be this bride can someone
[1:30:41] say amen
[1:30:42] i want to be this bride that's such a
[1:30:44] perfect shape until when christ come
[1:30:46] he fits right did you catch what the
[1:30:49] prophet said right
[1:30:51] he didn't say on it
[1:30:55] hallelujah this bride is going to be so
[1:30:58] perfect that when the headstone comes
[1:31:01] down he will fit
[1:31:03] right in to it
[1:31:06] oh hallelujah there's another
[1:31:09] generations of fanatics born
[1:31:12] praise the lord they're not going to
[1:31:15] accept
[1:31:16] anything to the right nothing to the
[1:31:18] left amen no
[1:31:19] i've been so molded oh hallelujah
[1:31:23] i want to just give you that disclaimer
[1:31:25] that everybody gets now this flesh is
[1:31:27] going to be with you always so don't
[1:31:29] look at your flesh
[1:31:31] no my brother and sister you look at the
[1:31:34] word
[1:31:35] and the word will deal with your flesh
[1:31:38] you prepare yourself for the headstone
[1:31:41] to come down
[1:31:43] in you and the issues
[1:31:46] of this flesh and life will be
[1:31:49] dealt with it might be good
[1:31:52] old-fashioned at the altar crying out to
[1:31:54] god forgive me lord
[1:31:56] i'm a sinner but god will move on you to
[1:31:59] deal with it
[1:32:01] hallelujah oh don't you love that
[1:32:04] as i was studying this i come across
[1:32:06] those things i was like oh hallelujah
[1:32:08] it's not on us amen it's not just an
[1:32:10] anointing on us
[1:32:12] amen but in us hallelujah
[1:32:16] that's what's going to make that
[1:32:17] difference hallelujah
[1:32:19] oh my oh my
[1:32:24] now here in the paradox now once again i
[1:32:28] i don't mean to sound facetious but to
[1:32:31] people who
[1:32:33] have to look at dates to determine
[1:32:36] the equitable authority of the quote
[1:32:39] depends on its date
[1:32:42] praise the lord prophet of god said 1947
[1:32:45] more than once
[1:32:47] repent and be baptized that was in 47.
[1:32:52] no i'm sorry that's the same word of god
[1:32:54] and it carries the same authoritative
[1:32:56] power
[1:32:58] all the way through now was a
[1:33:02] revelation of the word to the prophet
[1:33:04] progressive absolutely was there was a
[1:33:06] time he thought the white horse rider
[1:33:07] was
[1:33:08] you know pale horse and had those things
[1:33:10] mixed up
[1:33:12] but my brother and sister don't ever
[1:33:15] let someone fool you into the idea that
[1:33:18] a quote has lost its authority
[1:33:20] because the date the prophet preached it
[1:33:23] we could preach a sermon on that how
[1:33:25] that god no matter
[1:33:27] he is in glory but his orders there is
[1:33:30] just the same effect on the whole world
[1:33:31] and anybody that takes the promise
[1:33:34] his order is given his laws of nature
[1:33:39] and they will absolutely carry
[1:33:40] themselves true from pentecost or
[1:33:42] any other time anytime that god made the
[1:33:44] promise he will stay with that promise
[1:33:47] regardless of where
[1:33:48] people is at how many thousands of years
[1:33:50] off
[1:33:51] his laws ever remain the same now i'm
[1:33:54] going to stop for a minute i'm going to
[1:33:55] interject this
[1:33:57] to the naysayers of the message the
[1:33:59] critics
[1:34:00] that say well brother branham said this
[1:34:02] this and this
[1:34:04] now my brother and sister there's things
[1:34:06] i i like to be blunt
[1:34:08] there's things that appear to be
[1:34:10] contradictory
[1:34:13] but they also say there's things in the
[1:34:15] bible that are contradictory
[1:34:17] so when you get a spirit of being
[1:34:18] contradictory
[1:34:30] oh
[1:34:32] to spear so
[1:34:35] brother brown says here regardless of
[1:34:38] where the people is at how many
[1:34:39] thousands of years off
[1:34:41] my brother and sister there's things the
[1:34:43] prophet of god said
[1:34:45] it would appear they haven't come to
[1:34:47] pass
[1:34:50] as far as we know
[1:34:59] there was a healing in africa yesterday
[1:35:01] can anyone tell me where it was at
[1:35:06] are you with me there was a deliverance
[1:35:10] in south america this last sunday
[1:35:14] can anybody here tell me what it was
[1:35:18] you see god's moving he doesn't bugle
[1:35:23] what does scripture say about our
[1:35:24] prayers
[1:35:26] don't be like them that blow a trumpet
[1:35:30] before
[1:35:34] god's moving he didn't say you need to
[1:35:37] know
[1:35:37] what's happening everywhere he said you
[1:35:40] need to believe
[1:35:41] i'm in you and you and me
[1:35:44] you need to believe this and then when
[1:35:48] we believe
[1:35:48] that i'm cutting my sermon short by not
[1:35:52] when we believe that the prophet god
[1:35:54] says we'll see god
[1:35:56] move in our midst but not until we
[1:35:59] believe that
[1:36:01] so you see it's self-fulfilling prophecy
[1:36:04] once
[1:36:05] people say god's not moving
[1:36:09] do you realize that self-fulfilling
[1:36:10] prophecy god's not moving
[1:36:12] of course he's not moving he can't move
[1:36:14] with your spirit
[1:36:15] right here he moves on the spirit when
[1:36:19] people say my god is an awesome god and
[1:36:21] i believe every word he said and i'm
[1:36:23] going to live it
[1:36:24] i'll confess it god comes down the
[1:36:26] supernatural starts happening
[1:36:28] hallelujah boy we could go on and on
[1:36:30] right here in the united states
[1:36:32] about all the things that god is doing
[1:36:36] how the seed falls into the ground it
[1:36:37] rots bring forth life again looks like
[1:36:39] if it's ever going to bring forth life
[1:36:41] it's when it's in its perfect shape
[1:36:49] you just think when the church got so
[1:36:52] perfect
[1:36:52] everything is just so good so good
[1:36:56] that's when god's gonna move no
[1:36:59] he says if their
[1:37:02] life was ever in it then why wouldn't it
[1:37:04] just come forth
[1:37:06] put in the ground the life spring forth
[1:37:08] why does all that's
[1:37:09] around that life all that's around that
[1:37:11] germ that no man can find
[1:37:13] how is that everything material around
[1:37:16] that germ has to die
[1:37:19] so it can spring forth in new life but
[1:37:22] everything around it must also die and
[1:37:24] rock before it can spring forth
[1:37:27] i'm going to throw a little spin at you
[1:37:29] can i
[1:37:35] god wants to move in our midst can we
[1:37:36] say amen
[1:37:38] but did you know that i'm gonna look at
[1:37:41] the ceiling when i say this
[1:37:44] that you over there your attitude
[1:37:48] would stop god from moving amen and you
[1:37:51] up here
[1:37:52] your attitude would stop god from moving
[1:37:56] and you down there and on the side those
[1:38:00] things in your life that you have
[1:38:01] refused
[1:38:02] to surrender to the lord would stop god
[1:38:04] moving
[1:38:08] but right in the midst that seed gene
[1:38:11] amen
[1:38:12] seed germ it's it's gonna it's gonna
[1:38:15] bring forth
[1:38:16] life everything around it might have to
[1:38:18] rot
[1:38:19] everything else around it's gonna have
[1:38:21] to start dying out
[1:38:22] oh god let me die yeah let me die lord
[1:38:25] let me so our young people we got young
[1:38:27] people in this church that are getting
[1:38:29] older and older
[1:38:30] day by day by day my brother and sister
[1:38:32] they need a a
[1:38:34] a repentance they need a baptism they
[1:38:36] need a new birth
[1:38:37] amen and they do that why because every
[1:38:40] day they get older it's going to be
[1:38:41] harder for them to surrender to the lord
[1:38:44] that's why it behooves you and i as
[1:38:47] brothers and sisters to rot
[1:38:49] so that the seed that hasn't germinated
[1:38:51] yet
[1:38:52] will have its opportunity
[1:38:56] churches wonder well why are all our
[1:38:57] young people leaving
[1:39:04] why
[1:39:08] because the old people haven't rotted
[1:39:09] yet
[1:39:11] haven't completely given over to god yet
[1:39:15] god help us church grace tabernacle i
[1:39:17] love you
[1:39:19] but we got to get these spirits in these
[1:39:21] isms and scissors and
[1:39:23] contentions and whatever we got to kill
[1:39:25] them things and we're going to die with
[1:39:26] it amen
[1:39:27] so that the spirit of god can come and
[1:39:29] move in our midst
[1:39:31] i believe in a supernatural god i've
[1:39:32] seen him way too many times in my life
[1:39:35] to say here today and say well those are
[1:39:37] gone by
[1:39:37] it is present my brother and sister but
[1:39:40] we've got to die
[1:39:42] amen everything material around that
[1:39:44] germ has to die so it can bring forth a
[1:39:46] new life but everything around it must
[1:39:48] also die and rot before it can spring
[1:39:50] forth life
[1:39:52] amen so it is with the individual
[1:39:55] as long as there is any human injection
[1:39:57] human ideas then god's germ of life the
[1:39:59] holy spirit cannot work
[1:40:01] you cannot be healed as long as there's
[1:40:03] just a fraction
[1:40:04] somewhere that's not rotten yet
[1:40:08] it's got all the human elements all the
[1:40:09] scientific elements all the days of
[1:40:11] miracles is power so-called
[1:40:13] all that has to all
[1:40:17] not only die but rot and then from there
[1:40:20] grows the germ of life into a new life
[1:40:22] that's the only way it can grow that's
[1:40:24] the reason we
[1:40:25] don't get what we ask for we try to take
[1:40:27] with us
[1:40:28] so much of our own ideas are you
[1:40:31] listening paul haley
[1:40:33] amen that's the reason the lutheran
[1:40:35] church couldn't advance no further than
[1:40:37] it did the pentecostals and such
[1:40:38] because they inject by a bunch of
[1:40:40] theologians this ought to be this way
[1:40:42] this is for another day and this was for
[1:40:45] that there it stays
[1:40:46] it cannot grow to that perfect image of
[1:40:48] christ
[1:40:49] until every word of god is received
[1:40:53] into you then you become
[1:40:56] that word it's like the seed that went
[1:40:59] in the ground
[1:41:01] i tell you i want to be that word
[1:41:03] hallelujah i don't want to just talk
[1:41:04] about
[1:41:05] god sent a prophet i want to become
[1:41:08] that very word hallelujah
[1:41:12] and the prophet of god came in the 20th
[1:41:14] century to do what
[1:41:16] reveal the word do you realize that we
[1:41:19] all look back and say oh there it is
[1:41:21] hebrews oh oh here it is malachi oh
[1:41:25] here it is revelation he's revealing the
[1:41:27] word
[1:41:28] do you get it do you get it saints
[1:41:32] he come as a prophet to laodicea
[1:41:36] to reveal the word
[1:41:39] hallelujah and we are
[1:41:42] the word hallelujah it is there that god
[1:41:46] through the preaching of the word amen
[1:41:50] brother brown says i am god's voice to
[1:41:52] you
[1:41:54] boy he sure took a lot on himself did he
[1:41:57] except for it was god moving him to say
[1:42:01] i'm speaking
[1:42:02] you hear william branham but it's jesus
[1:42:05] christ that's speaking
[1:42:07] and i'm here to reveal
[1:42:11] the word amen oh hallelujah
[1:42:15] i say the word's been revealed my
[1:42:17] brother and sister
[1:42:18] i say there ought to be some people
[1:42:20] whose hearts would be enough to just
[1:42:21] kick them in the seat of the pants
[1:42:23] and get them going and saying thank you
[1:42:25] lord thank you lord the word has been
[1:42:27] revealed i believe it
[1:42:29] oh how i believe it i have been revealed
[1:42:33] the prophet of god come along then oh it
[1:42:35] seems like it's disconnected unconnected
[1:42:37] not related but the prophet of god says
[1:42:40] when the bride sees who she
[1:42:43] is she will become an invincible
[1:42:47] army what is it she doesn't see
[1:42:50] oh help i'm cutting a lot off so we
[1:42:52] aren't late sister emmy come
[1:42:55] she doesn't stop and look in the mirror
[1:42:59] of the flesh she cannot
[1:43:02] stop there she can't focus that because
[1:43:04] she knows
[1:43:05] that she has the word and the word
[1:43:08] corrects the air
[1:43:10] and if the air is our flesh but the word
[1:43:13] is in
[1:43:14] us then the word will correct
[1:43:17] the flesh oh
[1:43:20] can we get excited about that i tell you
[1:43:23] what my brother and sister to realize
[1:43:25] that the word
[1:43:26] amen the prophet of god makes several
[1:43:28] statements several quotes uh
[1:43:30] some of it you know not so direct that
[1:43:32] it seems like it jumps out at you
[1:43:34] but he's talking about how it come down
[1:43:36] to a time and a place
[1:43:37] hey man sister jerry i don't mean to put
[1:43:39] light to her but she just shared this
[1:43:41] with me
[1:43:42] my brother tim pruitt put it in this
[1:43:45] fashion
[1:43:46] he's he said something you order i i i
[1:43:49] sometimes muddle these things up forgive
[1:43:51] me
[1:43:52] he said we knew that these great things
[1:43:54] of god had to take place
[1:43:56] we knew there had to be signs and
[1:43:58] wonders and openings and signs in the
[1:44:00] heavens and signs in the earth
[1:44:02] what we didn't realize was that the word
[1:44:08] had to be made flesh
[1:44:11] that's what stumbles people
[1:44:14] it had to be manifested in
[1:44:18] the flesh oh hallelujah
[1:44:21] now when you think about being one in a
[1:44:24] million
[1:44:25] i want you to also think about how god
[1:44:28] loves you so much

[1:44:32] original scriptures please

[1:44:53] that original piece brother alex

[1:45:01] find that

[1:45:08] he brought me forth also into a large
[1:45:10] place
[1:45:11] he delivered me because he delighted
[1:45:16] in me why did god come down
[1:45:21] pour himself in your flesh
[1:45:24] why did he come down to let you be
[1:45:28] his representation because he delighted
[1:45:33] in you and i oh hallelujah

[1:46:59] kind of down that way but we'll leave
[1:47:02] samson for another night
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:06] but believe it or not samson ties right
[1:47:08] in here he jumped right in the middle of

[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:43] god examined every single attribute
[1:49:48] that makes up who you are
[1:49:51] and he looked down through time and he
[1:49:53] says that attribute
[1:49:55] is the attribute of a believer
[1:49:59] he recognized that and says hmm
