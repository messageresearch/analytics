[15:46] amen so I just wanted to share a couple
[15:48] testimonies with you my Uncle Mark last
[15:51] night went to the hospital with chest
[15:52] pain
[15:53] um
[15:55] you know the message went out this
[15:57] morning I don't know any of you don't
[15:59] know him Uncle Mark reuter but uh he um
[16:01] they thought he was having a heart
[16:02] attack he went to the hospital he did a
[16:04] full work up on him today and they
[16:05] released him they said you're good to go
[16:07] man he had no problems so praise the
[16:10] Lord for that we're thankful
[16:12] um he he does have a leaky heart valve
[16:14] which he's going back to the doctor to
[16:15] see but um just praise the Lord for his
[16:18] no no blockage or any of that that kind
[16:20] of stuff so thank the Lord for that and
[16:23] then my mom
[16:25] so she's been to the
[16:27] Ultra stenographer whatever they call
[16:29] them where they they like scan your
[16:31] arteries and stuff like that to uh
[16:34] see what uh what you got going on in
[16:36] there if any blockage and stuff like
[16:37] that so the first time she went they
[16:39] told her that her renal artery are the
[16:43] one that goes into your kidneys was 40
[16:45] blocked
[16:47] so she went back
[16:49] um a cardiologist had her go back to
[16:51] another one and the next time they told
[16:53] her that her both of her renal arteries
[16:55] were 40 blocks and her carotid artery
[16:57] going up to your brain was 50 blocks so
[16:59] so I'm back to the cardiologist
[17:02] um this has happened over the last
[17:03] couple years but um going back to the
[17:05] cardiologists last time and he said I
[17:07] want to have this done again because we
[17:09] need to check on this because especially
[17:11] the Carotid artery that could lead to a
[17:13] stroke or something like that so um I
[17:15] want to get this all checked out
[17:17] so she went this last time again uh here
[17:20] a couple weeks ago
[17:22] and she's got virtually very little
[17:25] blockage
[17:27] and so when the doctor called her he
[17:28] said I don't I don't tell you he said
[17:31] they don't make mistakes on these kind
[17:33] of things if they just they just don't
[17:35] do that he said but but I don't know how
[17:37] to square this up because there's no
[17:39] blockage there
[17:41] so just want to praise the Lord for that
[17:43] because that's I love that kind of stuff
[17:45] when it puzzles the doctors you know
[17:47] there scratch your head and go well it
[17:49] was there and it was there but it's not
[17:50] there

[33:13] whole message to me and of course there
[33:16] are a lot of sublime word the all truth
[33:17] but she is him
[33:21] it's quite a position I'm glad that the
[33:25] bride can say today she's been
[33:27] positionally placed in Christ what a

[34:23] amen amen amen
[34:27] while you're standing let's turn in our
[34:29] Bibles to Revelations the 20th chapter
[34:31] I want to continue on the white Throne
[34:33] judgment
[34:34] and this is part two I was going to say
[34:37] what part 1B but this uh this turned to
[34:40] be part one or part two
[34:42] and tonight we're going to speak on the
[34:45] righteous
[34:47] and others that are given eternal life
[34:49] at the judgment
[34:51] and why
[34:53] so I just wish
[34:55] more would be here but God knows where
[34:58] they are amen so it's in God's hands but
[35:00] you're here
[35:01] and I'm here and we're here and God knew
[35:04] we'd be here and so Lord bless each one
[35:08] amen that has come Revelations 20 verse
[35:12] 11.
[35:14] and I saw a great white throne in him
[35:18] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[35:20] and the heaven fled away
[35:22] and there was found no place for them
[35:27] of course we understand that the great
[35:28] right tone judgment is after the
[35:31] millennium
[35:32] it comes after the Millennium A Thousand
[35:35] Years rained
[35:36] and it comes after the second
[35:38] Resurrection
[35:40] the second Resurrection is not the bride
[35:43] the first resurrection is for the bride
[35:45] and only for the bride
[35:47] amen
[35:49] second Resurrection everyone comes up
[35:51] whether they like to think about it or
[35:53] not everybody Rises and to be judged
[35:56] amen before the queen and the King
[36:00] amen and so and I saw the dead small and
[36:05] great stand before God and the books
[36:07] were open and the prophet said that
[36:10] books the books that were open that's
[36:12] the book or record of your life
[36:15] every one being there that's the record
[36:18] of those that will stand before
[36:21] the Lord in judgment
[36:24] and the books were opened and another
[36:26] book was opened which is The Book of
[36:28] Life
[36:30] and the dead were judged out of those
[36:32] things which were written in the books
[36:35] see because their their life is an open
[36:37] book
[36:39] which were written in the books
[36:40] according to their works
[36:44] see there's nothing going to be hit
[36:46] everything every work everything is
[36:49] going to be open
[36:50] amen
[36:52] and the Sea gave up the dead which were
[36:54] in it and death and Hell delivered up
[36:56] the dead which were in them and they
[36:58] were judged every man according to their
[37:00] works and death and hell were cast into
[37:02] the Lake of Fire this is the second
[37:04] death
[37:05] and whosoever was not found written in
[37:07] the Book of Life One book of life
[37:11] so everything of their Works everything
[37:13] was judged according to the Book of Life
[37:16] and whosoever was not found written in
[37:18] the Book of Life was cast into the Lake
[37:21] of Fire
[37:23] amen amen you can go ahead and be sated
[37:27] in I just want to make reference to
[37:30] something here
[37:31] that we we mentioned in Revelations 10 2
[37:35] the angel
[37:36] in Revelations 10 2 had a little book
[37:39] opened in his hand
[37:42] and I want to to mention that because
[37:46] the prophet said this
[37:49] about that in the message in paragraph
[37:52] 168 of the church age book because this
[37:54] is what we're going through and I know
[37:56] the young people have been through the
[37:58] church AIDS books so they ought to be
[37:59] familiar with some of this
[38:01] but we just and and of course
[38:04] it's one thing to be familiar it's
[38:06] another thing to have it revealed
[38:09] and so that's the difference
[38:11] and so we just keep going through it and
[38:13] go through it something new every time
[38:14] this is something more and more
[38:17] through my life I don't know how many
[38:19] times I've been through this book but
[38:21] something brand new all the time in it
[38:23] but on paragraph 168 of the sergeants
[38:26] and church age and that's page 320.
[38:31] he says this and we mentioned this
[38:34] Sunday but I want to say it once more no
[38:36] names will be blotted out of the book of
[38:39] eternal life
[38:41] and you notice I'm referring to the
[38:43] little book in the Angel's hand that was
[38:45] opened that's the that's the message of
[38:48] the seventh angel
[38:50] all right and he said no no names will
[38:53] be blotted out of the book of eternal
[38:55] life for that is another record
[38:59] that is another record though contained
[39:02] in The Book of Life
[39:05] so it's another record though contained
[39:07] in the Book of Life remember only names
[39:10] are in
[39:12] those books
[39:14] that book okay only names are recorded
[39:16] there names means people
[39:20] if you want to look that up it's in the
[39:22] same message paragraph 91 that he says
[39:25] names mean people
[39:27] that are written okay so you only find
[39:30] one book containing names
[39:34] amen
[39:36] all right and so I want to refer to that
[39:39] that is another record though contained
[39:41] and the prophet or excuse me and the
[39:44] prophet yes goes right to First John 5
[39:46] 11 and 12.
[39:47] and if you want to follow along you can
[39:49] but I'll just read it from here
[39:51] and this is the record that God hath
[39:54] given to us remember another record
[39:56] though contained in the Book of Life and
[39:58] this is the record
[39:59] in other words the book of eternal life
[40:01] and this is the record that God gave
[40:03] unto us eternal life and this life is in
[40:06] his son
[40:09] and he that hath the son
[40:12] he that hath the son
[40:15] what is the New Birth the revelation of
[40:17] Jesus Christ in you
[40:19] and he that hath the son what is it it's
[40:22] an unveiling of Who You Are
[40:26] amen that's who you are
[40:28] so he that hath the son hath life
[40:34] and he that hath not the Son of God hath
[40:37] not life
[40:39] so that's the bride record right there
[40:42] amen that's the bride record and only
[40:45] she can receive that because only she
[40:47] can be born again
[40:50] now who that she is
[40:53] I'm not the judge of that
[40:56] by their fruits they are known
[40:59] but as an individual I know I'm one of
[41:02] them by God's grace and you can too
[41:05] because it's not a hope I'm born again
[41:07] you will know if you're born again you
[41:09] know it
[41:11] amen amen and you grow up into the
[41:15] stature of Christ because that's what's
[41:17] birthed in you
[41:20] and as we said the seed must be there
[41:22] because the seed is himself
[41:25] and his children are his seed so if his
[41:28] children are born of him what are they
[41:30] himself
[41:32] manifested
[41:34] all right
[41:36] that's why the scripture said we are
[41:37] born of God
[41:40] all right so then we'll we'll pull off
[41:42] from that I want you to turn with me to
[41:44] Jude
[41:47] Jude 14. Jude verse 14.
[41:52] of course there's only one chapter in
[41:53] Jude the chapter
[41:57] and verse 14 and Enoch also the seventh
[42:01] from Adam
[42:03] Prophet that's our course that's our
[42:04] type because
[42:06] we are the seventh from the second Adam
[42:09] and Enoch who is the also at seventh
[42:12] seventh age Enoch also the seventh from
[42:15] Adam prophesied of these saying behold
[42:17] the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his
[42:20] Saints
[42:22] you're talking about the Judgment here
[42:24] now
[42:25] to execute judgment verse 15 to execute
[42:28] judgment upon all and to convince all
[42:30] that word convinces to convict
[42:34] as a magistrate would as a judge to
[42:37] execute judgment upon all and to
[42:39] convince all that are ungodly among them
[42:41] of all their ungodly Deeds which they
[42:44] have ungodly committed and and all their
[42:48] hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have
[42:50] spoken against it
[42:53] so to execute judgment upon all meaning
[42:56] there's going to be unjust and just or
[43:00] excuse me righteous and unrighteous in
[43:02] this judgment
[43:05] there's going to be judgment on all
[43:07] there's going to be an executement
[43:09] execution of judgment on all now let's
[43:12] let's go on further here and let's go to
[43:15] Psalms 149.
[43:18] Psalm 149
[43:21] and we just ask God to bless this word
[43:23] bless his word to our hearts tonight
[43:27] amen psalm 149.
[43:33] and the ninth verse last verse
[43:37] speaking of the Bride
[43:40] let's just take verse 8 with it to bind
[43:43] talking about the brine the the
[43:46] bride to bind their kings with chains
[43:49] and their nobles with Fetters of iron to
[43:52] execute upon them the Judgment written
[43:54] this honor have all his Saints praise ye
[43:59] the Lord
[44:01] amen amen in paragraph 130 of the church
[44:05] age book I'm going to go through these
[44:07] things pretty quick and I pray that
[44:09] those and those of course on the
[44:11] internet if you're in online we greet
[44:14] you and may you be blessed by this word
[44:21] paragraph 130
[44:23] of the church age book
[44:26] and this is if you're wondering which
[44:28] one I'm in this is the the newer Edition
[44:30] brother George Edition that he put out
[44:34] and so it's it's paragraph 130 of the of
[44:37] the uh
[44:39] sardesian Church age
[44:42] and it's on on page
[44:44] 308
[44:47] he said
[44:48] in the white Throne judgment there will
[44:52] be in the great white Throne judgment
[44:54] there will be a separation of people
[44:58] the book of life will be opened and
[45:01] another book will be opened so we know
[45:04] the other book opened besides the Book
[45:06] of Life those are the books
[45:09] of all their life is an open book
[45:13] all right and so as we think about these
[45:16] things we said and we'll just bring it
[45:18] back to your attention a few things
[45:20] right here of what we what we've said
[45:22] Monday or Sunday Monday uh Sunday
[45:35] and that and that is
[45:37] this judgment of course is not for the
[45:40] bride
[45:43] she's the judge in the in the matter
[45:45] it's not for her she's not being judged
[45:48] there
[45:49] the bride will not be judged at the
[45:51] white Throne judgment
[45:52] amen
[45:54] all right so
[45:57] she stands at another Throne though to
[46:00] give an account for what she's done for
[46:02] reward
[46:03] and a lot of people mix that up
[46:06] so that's but that's not the white
[46:07] Throne judgment
[46:09] the bride is never going to be judged
[46:11] she's already been judged in Jesus
[46:13] Christ amen so we've been through that
[46:15] on Sunday if you weren't here then you
[46:16] need to if you'd like to hear it you can
[46:18] hear it online
[46:22] she'll never take it brother Brown said
[46:24] another book was opened and and that's
[46:28] the book of life and he said not for the
[46:30] Holy Ghost Bride she'll never take it
[46:32] because she's in the rapture
[46:35] amen so so
[46:43] and when when life and when of course
[46:45] when we are born here on this Earth
[46:47] there's a record that starts there's not
[46:49] much noise instead until you come to an
[46:52] age of accountability and know what's
[46:53] right and wrong
[46:54] then the noise starts
[46:59] he starts saying things and doing things
[47:01] the person that he has to answer for and
[47:03] when that life ends the record or tapers
[47:05] took off and laid in The Great Library
[47:07] of God it's played right back in front
[47:09] of you at the Judgment so every move you
[47:11] made every thought that went through
[47:12] your mind can you see it he says now oh
[47:16] God do they realize that every word we
[47:18] say scientifically proven it's on a
[47:21] record and starts when we start living
[47:23] in this earth and ends when we die and
[47:25] is put in God's album to be played back
[47:27] again at the judgment
[47:30] oh God these words never die they go on
[47:33] and on the record will be played at the
[47:34] day of judgment and those whose hands
[47:36] went up father if they'll be they'll be
[47:38] right there at the day of judgment and
[47:40] what their heart was thinking what would
[47:42] be it'll it'll will be there at the day
[47:45] of judgment there's nothing happens but
[47:47] what God knows it oh my it's recorded
[47:50] running to and fro through the earth
[47:52] watching every move perceiving every
[47:54] thought knowing everything you're doing
[47:56] the intents of your heart what you
[47:59] intend to do he knows all about it he
[48:01] knows whether you love him he knows
[48:02] whether your intentions are right to
[48:04] serve him he knows all about it and what
[48:07] will it be when you stand at that day
[48:09] when every sins naked before him and you
[48:11] stand there at the white Throne judgment
[48:13] is this is sobering
[48:15] because
[48:16] you're going to be there all of us will
[48:18] be there
[48:21] oh I said yeah the bride will be there
[48:22] but she won't be judged she's judging
[48:24] but we'll be there
[48:29] so as the word said what manner of
[48:31] people or what manner of person ought we
[48:33] to be
[48:36] that right what manner of people ought
[48:38] we to be
[48:39] knowing that we are facing this and the
[48:41] decision time is now
[48:43] not after you pass this life the
[48:45] decision time for Christ to serve him or
[48:47] not serve him to be a Christian or not
[48:49] be a Christian is now
[48:57] the reason the bride will never be in
[48:59] the Judgment because he's already judged
[49:00] that body which I'm a part of he could
[49:03] not stand Us in the Judgment again
[49:05] because he already judged the body
[49:08] amen all right so just to leave that off
[49:11] just to be sure that we understand that
[49:15] now we're going to go here to those that
[49:17] are in the judgment
[49:19] so we we realize it's a separation of
[49:22] person let's go to Saint John 17.
[49:25] Saint John 17
[49:32] and read verse 2.
[49:35] now we know that God is the creator of
[49:37] all things he can do what he wants with
[49:39] his creation he has that right
[49:42] amen all are his
[49:45] he created us
[49:48] amen for everything he created
[49:50] everything he he is that only one
[49:52] Creator and that's God
[49:54] you're here not by chance you were
[49:56] created you were brought here
[49:58] amen if we can't serve if we think we
[50:00] can go our own way we got news for you
[50:02] why not why not trust and have the
[50:04] absolute of the word that created you
[50:08] he puts you together pretty well don't
[50:10] you think
[50:12] amen every nerve every cell why can't we
[50:14] and he created heavens and earth
[50:17] then what's our absolute
[50:20] that was the beginning word anything
[50:22] that leaves off or takes away or adds to
[50:24] that as a perversion so we don't have to
[50:27] add to add anything it's absolutely
[50:28] perfect
[50:30] all right so let's go to Saint John 17 2
[50:34] and he said this Jesus speaking in his
[50:37] prayer he said as thou Hast given him
[50:40] power speaking of himself as thou has
[50:42] given him well let's read verse 1. these
[50:45] words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes
[50:47] to heaven and said father The Hours come
[50:49] glorify thy son that thy son may also
[50:52] glorify thee as thou has given him Power
[50:55] Over All Flesh
[50:58] that he should give eternal life to as
[51:00] many as thou has given him
[51:05] so we're looking at another group of
[51:07] people besides the bride
[51:09] that will be at the white Throne
[51:11] judgment
[51:12] that will receive and be given
[51:17] eternal life
[51:19] okay now let's look at this you say well
[51:22] that that's good then I can I can make
[51:24] it there then if I know it's not based
[51:26] on your good works we're going to go
[51:28] into that we're going to realize this in
[51:30] a minute all right so remember
[51:32] the righteous and others
[51:35] now I'm not saying they're not both
[51:37] righteous but there's righteous and
[51:38] there's others that are included in
[51:41] there
[51:42] amen none of those that are being judged
[51:45] at the white Throne judgment are born
[51:47] again
[51:50] none of them
[51:52] so they're going to be born again not
[51:54] born-again people that are going to
[51:57] receive eternal life based on something
[52:02] all right so let's let's look at this
[52:05] and find out what the scripture said it
[52:06] was based on
[52:09] it must be in the word somewhere if
[52:11] there's something that they're basing
[52:12] this on it's got to be in the book of
[52:14] life because their works are going to be
[52:16] judged by that what the word said in
[52:19] that book
[52:20] so there's got to be a basis for their
[52:22] Works to be accepted or rejected
[52:27] is that right
[52:28] Okay so
[52:30] let's turn to Matthew 25. now notice
[52:33] Jesus is saying he's been given power to
[52:36] give eternal life to as many as God gave
[52:38] him
[52:40] now we know that's including the bride
[52:41] we know that's the bride but he gives
[52:44] life he gives eternal life to he's given
[52:46] it's given
[52:47] to others too but not on this side
[52:52] they have to come up through the second
[52:54] Resurrection so somebody let I will get
[52:57] a little ahead of myself here but
[52:59] somebody that's believing and saying
[53:01] they believe and professed Believers of
[53:03] the message but not born again are not
[53:05] going to come up at the first
[53:06] resurrection they're going to come up
[53:08] that's a second Resurrection they're
[53:10] left for the great white the the Great
[53:12] Tribulation
[53:14] which will they will be hunted down as
[53:17] dogs and have to give their life in that
[53:19] time
[53:21] further stand
[53:22] against
[53:24] the Antichrist system
[53:28] amen
[53:30] they won't bow to that thing
[53:34] okay are you with me
[53:36] now I'm including those that are around
[53:39] the message
[53:41] I'm not saying who they are I'm just
[53:42] saying they're there
[53:44] unless you're born again you're not
[53:46] going you're going to come up at the
[53:47] second resurrection and stand before the
[53:50] judge and his bride
[53:51] foreign
[53:52] and be judged by the bride because we
[53:55] can go back to First Corinthians 6 and
[53:57] find out know ye not the Saints shall
[53:58] judge the world
[54:00] and angels
[54:03] judgments committed to her
[54:08] all right
[54:10] all right so now let's I'm just going to
[54:12] take this like I say a little study here
[54:14] tonight so it's a Wednesday night we'll
[54:16] have a Bible study so go to Matthew 25
[54:19] with me
[54:20] Matthew 25
[54:26] now this that we're going to go here
[54:28] tonight
[54:29] is sometimes a misunder very
[54:31] misunderstood portion of scripture
[54:34] but the prophets answered these things
[54:38] and Matthew in in Matthew 25 and we're
[54:41] going to be reading with the 31st verse
[54:43] of Matthew 25
[54:45] and I'm going to read it out of the
[54:47] church age you follow as I'm reading it
[54:49] because I'm following some things here
[54:51] the prophet said
[54:53] like is there any way to turn this down
[54:55] a little bit
[54:57] this light right here
[55:00] is I get a tremendous glare off of this
[55:03] page this white page I get a glare off
[55:05] of it and it's hard for me to see it if
[55:08] not that's fine I can work with it
[55:11] and if it can just dim it down just a
[55:13] little bit it would help
[55:19] that's better yes thank you thank you
[55:22] that yeah that's better okay
[55:25] now you can still see me all right
[55:30] I've not disappeared here
[55:34] if not if I am you still hear my voice
[55:39] all right now I'm going to read here and
[55:41] he begin the 31st verse here
[55:44] all right
[55:46] when the son of man shall come in his
[55:48] glory and all the Holy Angels with him
[55:51] then shall he set upon the throne of his
[55:54] glory
[55:56] amen
[55:58] He Shall Set upon the throne of his
[56:00] glory and before him we could say a lot
[56:02] about that about his glory because we
[56:04] realize that the wife is the glory of
[56:06] her husband
[56:09] all right so they're one sitting there
[56:11] they're not one per they are they are
[56:14] one
[56:15] together amen
[56:19] and both
[56:20] as sovereigns
[56:23] that's true
[56:25] the bride is Sovereign under headship
[56:27] she's under a headship
[56:29] hey maybe she's still a sovereign she's
[56:32] given right
[56:33] Amen in the word all right so now watch
[56:37] and before him I don't want to dwell too
[56:39] much on these because I wanted to get
[56:41] through this and before him shall be
[56:43] gathered all nations now paragraph 144
[56:47] of this message says I want lettuce to
[56:49] be very clear here these are not Nations
[56:51] being judged as we would think of
[56:53] Nations but these are people of Nations
[56:58] okay are you with me because this is
[57:00] what the prophet said I'm only so he
[57:02] said these are not Nations being judged
[57:04] all right but they're people
[57:08] of Nations all right and before him
[57:10] shall be gathered all nations and he
[57:13] shall separate them
[57:14] one from another
[57:17] watch the statement as a Shepherd
[57:20] divideth his sheep from the goats
[57:23] as a shepherd
[57:25] now there's a purpose of that we'll
[57:26] follow through this in just a second and
[57:29] he shall set the sheep on his right hand
[57:32] but the goats on his left
[57:35] now the answer to that about the sheep
[57:38] and the goats in paragraph 142 he says
[57:41] to further clarify notice specifically
[57:44] the words of Matthew
[57:46] he said it does not say that a Shepherd
[57:48] is literally separating sheep from goats
[57:50] but it is as a shepherd
[57:55] dividing sheep from goats they they are
[57:58] not in this particular area of time they
[58:01] are these are not sheep excuse me in
[58:03] this particular area of time in the
[58:06] white Throne judgment the Sheep are in
[58:08] his fold and they heard his voice the
[58:10] word and they followed him they are
[58:12] already they already have eternal life
[58:15] and cannot come into the judgment
[58:17] so the Sheep are his bride
[58:20] they hear his voice they cannot hear
[58:22] another voice they cannot receive
[58:25] another voice
[58:27] amen why because they came directly from
[58:30] him
[58:32] all right just like that eagle can only
[58:34] hear the voice of an eagle because he's
[58:36] an eagle to begin with
[58:37] all right so here I want to clarify that
[58:39] there he's setting as a Shepherd these
[58:43] are not actual the Sheep but he sets
[58:45] them as sheep on his right hand and the
[58:48] goats on his left he's making a a
[58:50] difference here
[58:52] then shall the king say unto them on his
[58:55] right hand that's the Sheep
[58:58] Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the
[59:01] Kingdom prepared for you notice it was
[59:04] prepared for them
[59:07] so you can't you can't be a black you
[59:09] can't be a white bird when you were
[59:11] meant to be a different bird
[59:14] you see what I'm saying
[59:16] so they were already prepared the
[59:18] kingdom inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[59:21] you you are in my will this is something
[59:23] that you didn't you didn't choose
[59:25] yourself but God is position you placed
[59:28] you in the word like this
[59:30] okay then he said come inherit the
[59:34] Kingdom prepared for you from the
[59:35] foundation of the world
[59:37] for I watch these things that happen now
[59:40] for I was hungered and you gave me meat
[59:44] I was thirsty and you gave me drink I
[59:48] was stranger and you took me in naked
[59:51] and you clothed me I was sick and you
[59:54] visited me I was in prison and you came
[59:57] unto me
[59:59] then shall the righteous what
[1:00:05] then shall the righteous answer him
[1:00:08] saying
[1:00:09] who's answering him it isn't the bride
[1:00:16] but they're righteous
[1:00:20] all right are you are you with me so far
[1:00:22] all right so the righteous answered him
[1:00:25] saying Lord
[1:00:26] when saw we hungered
[1:00:32] and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee
[1:00:35] drink when shall we thee or thee a
[1:00:37] stranger and took thee in or naked and
[1:00:40] clothed thee
[1:00:42] or when shall we the sick and in prison
[1:00:46] and came unto thee
[1:00:48] they didn't know it
[1:00:50] when was it Lord
[1:00:53] they didn't have a clue what they were
[1:00:55] doing yet ordained to do it other words
[1:00:57] they were hardwired to do what they did
[1:01:01] by God
[1:01:03] predestinated by God to do it
[1:01:09] all right that's why they're righteous
[1:01:13] haha
[1:01:15] their Works were righteous
[1:01:18] okay now he said and when they saw thee
[1:01:22] now the bride believes in doing all of
[1:01:24] this but we're not talking about the
[1:01:26] bride here we're talking about another
[1:01:28] people being judged here
[1:01:33] that were ordained to do what they did
[1:01:35] and this was their lot of inheritance
[1:01:38] and they didn't know they did it
[1:01:41] boy that's a good one
[1:01:44] they didn't know they did it all right
[1:01:46] so he said Lord wind saw we hungered and
[1:01:49] fed thee or thirsty and gave thee and
[1:01:51] said oh or when okay and now now he says
[1:01:55] and the King shall answer and say unto
[1:01:58] them
[1:01:59] verily I say unto you inasmuch as you
[1:02:03] have done it unto one of the least of
[1:02:06] these who
[1:02:09] my brethren
[1:02:11] now I'm going to go back on some of
[1:02:13] these things right here and explain who
[1:02:15] is his brethren
[1:02:18] amen and why are these righteous
[1:02:23] getting eternal life
[1:02:25] okay now I'm going to tell you yes they
[1:02:27] do get eternal life we'll go into those
[1:02:29] I want to bring to you what he said
[1:02:32] and as much as you have done unto the
[1:02:34] least of these my brethren you did it
[1:02:37] unto me
[1:02:40] amen so there was someone out there that
[1:02:42] was manifesting Christ for them to do it
[1:02:45] for and but they didn't know who they
[1:02:47] were
[1:02:52] amen
[1:02:54] so Jesus had to be among them in that
[1:02:57] day when he's do it saying this and that
[1:02:59] applies to every age
[1:03:03] there's somebody that was manifesting
[1:03:05] Jesus Christ for it was Jesus Christ in
[1:03:08] flesh
[1:03:11] no not the calvary man but Jesus Christ
[1:03:14] nevertheless in flesh
[1:03:17] the Holy Spirit the word
[1:03:22] and he said when you've done this unto
[1:03:24] them you've done it unto me they shall
[1:03:26] then he shall say to them on the left
[1:03:28] hand who are those
[1:03:31] the goat
[1:03:33] depart for me you cursed
[1:03:38] into Everlasting fire prepared for the
[1:03:40] devil and his angels
[1:03:43] for I was hungered and you gave now the
[1:03:45] same thing he's saying to them I was
[1:03:47] hungered and you gave me no meat
[1:03:51] foreign
[1:03:56] sick and imprisoned and you visited me
[1:03:59] not
[1:04:00] then shall they also answer him saying
[1:04:03] Lord when saw we they said the same
[1:04:05] thing
[1:04:06] when did we see you hungered
[1:04:09] or thirsty or a stranger naked or sick
[1:04:12] or in prison and did not Minister unto
[1:04:14] thee then he shall answer them saying
[1:04:16] verily I say unto you in so much as you
[1:04:18] did that not unto one of the least of
[1:04:21] these you did it not unto me you say but
[1:04:24] they didn't know what they did that's
[1:04:26] right but they had but but these others
[1:04:29] didn't either
[1:04:32] are you with me and they did it because
[1:04:35] it was in their heart to do it these
[1:04:38] others saw the same thing happen but it
[1:04:41] was not in their heart to do this
[1:04:45] are you with me all right all right so
[1:04:50] and these so see it's got to be
[1:04:53] something in your heart it's not it's
[1:04:56] not you're trying to do these things to
[1:04:58] get salvation
[1:05:02] amen it's got to be in you
[1:05:09] I'm not now this is the bride believes
[1:05:11] that too
[1:05:12] amen we'll do those things from our
[1:05:14] heart but this isn't the bride we're
[1:05:16] talking to about here
[1:05:18] Jesus is not talking about the bride
[1:05:20] here
[1:05:24] amen those sheep that he put on the
[1:05:26] rights not bride
[1:05:29] now that goes contrary to every
[1:05:30] Theologian in the country but that's
[1:05:32] exactly where the Prophet placed the
[1:05:34] works that they were judged by
[1:05:37] is right here and there's other
[1:05:39] scriptures
[1:05:40] but this is what this is what they did
[1:05:43] there's some reason they Merit or that
[1:05:45] Merit necessarily but given eternal life
[1:05:48] are rewarded I should say
[1:05:50] was based on scripture
[1:05:53] okay now now watch this he said now you
[1:05:57] go down here
[1:05:59] so he said
[1:06:01] you did it not unto me and all and these
[1:06:04] shall go away into Everlasting
[1:06:06] punishment but the righteous here we
[1:06:09] again who say the righteous
[1:06:11] right into life eternal
[1:06:16] amen amen all right now paragraph 131 I
[1:06:21] want to make sure I'm staying with my
[1:06:22] note here
[1:06:26] no I want to turn to Mark 9 37 just for
[1:06:29] a moment
[1:06:31] quickly
[1:06:33] well I will you while you're turning
[1:06:36] there mark
[1:06:37] chapter 9 I will just say this
[1:06:48] there will be both the righteous and the
[1:06:51] unrighteous in the judgment
[1:06:54] it says so these righteous will not
[1:06:59] be the bride
[1:07:03] this is the prophet's words these will
[1:07:04] not be the bride
[1:07:06] for the bride sits with him in judgment
[1:07:10] okay
[1:07:11] now we just read those scriptures I've
[1:07:13] read to you II Corinth or First
[1:07:15] Corinthians chapter 6 2-3 showing the
[1:07:18] bride judges we read that Sunday I won't
[1:07:20] go into that
[1:07:22] just to make a point here that these
[1:07:24] righteous are not the bride
[1:07:26] those man's making a very direct
[1:07:28] statement here what you've just read in
[1:07:30] Matthew 25 he follows right up here
[1:07:32] behind it and said these righteous are
[1:07:34] not the bride
[1:07:35] okay
[1:07:40] now Mark
[1:07:42] in Mark the ninth chapter
[1:07:45] and the 37th
[1:07:48] verse starting
[1:07:54] whosoever shall receive one of these
[1:07:56] such children in my name receiveth me
[1:07:58] and whosoever shall receive me receiveth
[1:08:01] not be but him that sent me
[1:08:04] and John answered him saying Master we
[1:08:07] saw one casting out devils in thy name
[1:08:09] and and and he followed us not and we
[1:08:12] forbade him because he followed us not
[1:08:14] now listen to this carefully
[1:08:17] but Jesus said forbid him not for there
[1:08:20] is no man which shall do a miracle in my
[1:08:23] name that can speak lightly speak evil
[1:08:25] of me
[1:08:27] for he that is not against us is on our
[1:08:31] part
[1:08:33] for whosoever shall give you a cup of
[1:08:35] water to drink in my name
[1:08:38] because he because you belong to Christ
[1:08:43] remember he knows every little work he
[1:08:45] knows everything you do he knows your
[1:08:48] motive he knows your objective
[1:08:50] your intent amen
[1:08:53] I want to bring that home to us all that
[1:08:55] we might be a different kind of people
[1:08:57] and realize you're being watched
[1:09:01] and it's all going to come to recording
[1:09:03] someday
[1:09:04] you know and and Isaac I forget what you
[1:09:07] said Isaac but but oh yes you referred
[1:09:10] to that scripture in Philippians about
[1:09:12] think on these things
[1:09:14] just today Holy Spirit just quickened to
[1:09:16] me that scripture David said Lord he
[1:09:19] said let the meditation of my heart
[1:09:23] and remember in the heart is a soul
[1:09:28] but there's a spirit there's a there's a
[1:09:30] mind
[1:09:31] that little spirit in the let the
[1:09:34] meditation of my heart be acceptable
[1:09:37] unto thee
[1:09:40] in other words let it let it let it go
[1:09:42] let other words a right mental attitude
[1:09:44] toward the scriptures will bring it to
[1:09:46] pass
[1:09:47] let it be from my soul you dwell in the
[1:09:50] soul let it be from the control room of
[1:09:52] my heart what I meditate upon
[1:09:55] amen all right I don't want to get to
[1:09:58] walking around here I get to preaching
[1:09:59] then I get beyond what I want to do all
[1:10:02] right
[1:10:03] come back all right so he says
[1:10:06] and so whoever will give a great a cup
[1:10:08] of water to drink in my name because you
[1:10:11] belong to Christ verily I say unto you
[1:10:13] shall not lose his reward
[1:10:15] and whosoever shall offend one of these
[1:10:18] little ones that believe in me
[1:10:20] it is better for him than a millstone I
[1:10:23] I didn't tend to read this but we'll
[1:10:25] read we hanged about his neck and he
[1:10:27] should be cast into the sea so see that
[1:10:30] goes right back what Jesus said
[1:10:32] you didn't feed me you didn't
[1:10:35] give me drink you didn't but offended
[1:10:37] okay
[1:10:39] now
[1:10:42] let's go to Matthew 10.
[1:10:45] it's a similar scripture but I want to
[1:10:46] read it
[1:10:47] Matthew 10.
[1:10:52] and verse 41.
[1:10:56] foreign
[1:11:00] the prophet in the name of the Prophet
[1:11:03] shall receive a prophet's reward and he
[1:11:05] that receiveth a righteous man
[1:11:07] remember the bride's righteous
[1:11:10] how many know that she clothed in his
[1:11:12] righteousness
[1:11:14] his very life
[1:11:16] all right
[1:11:19] and he that receive it said he and he
[1:11:22] that receiveth a righteous man in the
[1:11:24] name of a righteous man
[1:11:27] shall receive a righteous man's reward
[1:11:30] what was the righteous man's reward
[1:11:32] eternal life
[1:11:34] all right
[1:11:36] and whosoever shall give a drink unto
[1:11:38] one of these little ones a cup of cold
[1:11:40] water only in the name of a disciple
[1:11:42] verily I say unto you he shall know in
[1:11:44] no wise lose his reward
[1:11:48] all right
[1:11:49] brother Branham in the message
[1:11:51] 60
[1:11:53] 9 25 60. he said
[1:11:57] he said at that day speaking of the
[1:11:59] Judgment Day he would separate the
[1:12:01] people like sheep and goats and he would
[1:12:03] say to the goats which we just read all
[1:12:05] that and we go on we won't say anymore
[1:12:07] it was it now he but the point I want to
[1:12:09] make here he says and don't fail to get
[1:12:11] this church keep this in your heart
[1:12:13] forever it was so unconsciously done
[1:12:17] the people don't do it for a line of
[1:12:19] duty a man that gives you something or
[1:12:21] another because he ought to do it a man
[1:12:23] that feeds you because he ought to do it
[1:12:25] he's got a selfish idea
[1:12:29] it should be your very life your very
[1:12:31] action
[1:12:32] Amen in other words it's got to be in
[1:12:34] your heart
[1:12:36] it was so surprising to these sheep that
[1:12:39] they said Lord when were you hungry and
[1:12:41] we wouldn't feed you when were you
[1:12:43] hungry and we and when were you hungry
[1:12:46] and we fed you or where when
[1:12:49] were youth naked and we gave you clothes
[1:12:51] and when were you thirsty and gave you
[1:12:53] drink when were your sick and Minister
[1:12:55] unto you it was so on automatically it
[1:12:58] was so excuse me it was so
[1:13:02] unconsciously done see he said
[1:13:05] unconsciously done
[1:13:07] we never knew that
[1:13:10] but Jesus turned and said in so much
[1:13:12] you've done to these you did it unto me
[1:13:13] and brother Branham also referring to
[1:13:16] the same scripture I give a righteous
[1:13:17] man
[1:13:20] receives a righteous man
[1:13:23] a righteous man in the name of a
[1:13:24] righteous man shall receive a righteous
[1:13:26] man's reward brother Branham referred to
[1:13:28] that very statement back to Matthew 25
[1:13:30] what I just read
[1:13:33] just so you if you want to know what he
[1:13:35] said about that
[1:13:37] it was an unselfish slice not a second
[1:13:39] thought not to think about it
[1:13:42] just from their hearts
[1:13:44] they but they but they that do the will
[1:13:47] of my father just from their hearts just
[1:13:49] freely
[1:13:51] see they were in the will of God doing
[1:13:52] it
[1:13:53] see because why that scripture in
[1:13:55] Matthew had to be
[1:13:57] manifested
[1:14:01] all right
[1:14:03] so we realized that they were
[1:14:07] they were the righteous one
[1:14:10] not the bride
[1:14:12] and then he goes on to say paragraph 134
[1:14:16] the question now arises why are these
[1:14:19] righteous ones in the judgment
[1:14:22] he said there's no other place that they
[1:14:24] can come up for there are but two
[1:14:26] resurrections and since they could not
[1:14:28] qualify for the first resurrection they
[1:14:30] must come up in the second
[1:14:32] which is a resurrection unto judgment
[1:14:37] he said the ones who qualify for the
[1:14:39] first resurrection is the bride are not
[1:14:42] in the judgment and then he reads that
[1:14:44] scripture in Matthew 5 24 which we read
[1:14:47] he that believeth he that believeth on
[1:14:49] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:14:52] that is the believer is already a
[1:14:53] recipient of eternal life which he has
[1:14:55] in his possession now and shall not come
[1:14:57] into condemnation judgment but is passed
[1:15:00] from Death unto life but notice
[1:15:02] carefully Jesus must yet this is
[1:15:05] paragraph 135 but note I'm saying that
[1:15:08] for others on the internet and those
[1:15:09] listening and you mark it down if you'd
[1:15:11] like but notice carefully Jesus must
[1:15:14] have yet have yet another group in mind
[1:15:17] who had a certain Resurrection will
[1:15:20] receive eternal life
[1:15:22] They will receive it at the resurrection
[1:15:25] not having previously received it as a
[1:15:28] member of the Bride I want you to turn
[1:15:31] me to John 5.
[1:15:35] hopefully I can get through this without
[1:15:37] holding you
[1:15:39] over time here John 5
[1:15:47] and verse 28
[1:15:51] Marvel not at this
[1:15:55] for the hour is coming in which all that
[1:15:59] are in the graves will shall shall hear
[1:16:02] his voice
[1:16:06] and shall come forth
[1:16:08] they that have done good unto the
[1:16:10] resurrection of life and they that have
[1:16:13] noticed done good done even works they
[1:16:16] that have done good unto the
[1:16:17] resurrection of life and they that have
[1:16:19] done evil unto the resurrection of
[1:16:22] damnation
[1:16:24] now verse 1 or paragraph 136 Prophet
[1:16:28] says we now we all know that John 5 28
[1:16:32] through 29 is not the rapture
[1:16:37] it is not
[1:16:39] the first resurrection rapture
[1:16:42] for only the dead in Christ shall arise
[1:16:45] from the graves at that time along with
[1:16:47] the living along for only the dead in
[1:16:50] Christ he's referring back to
[1:16:51] Thessalonians
[1:16:53] or the res or the Rapture Only The Dead
[1:16:56] In Christ shall rise in the graves at
[1:16:58] that time along with the living bride
[1:17:00] who is still on the Earth
[1:17:04] I didn't lose you there now did I
[1:17:07] John 28-29 is speaking of the second
[1:17:10] Resurrection
[1:17:13] some come to some come and are
[1:17:16] unrighteous
[1:17:17] and some by their works are found
[1:17:19] righteous
[1:17:20] all right
[1:17:24] chapter or vert paragraph 137 but it
[1:17:27] says in John 5 28-29 that all are going
[1:17:30] to come forth from the grave this is the
[1:17:33] very same resurrection that is spoken of
[1:17:35] in Revelations 20 11-15 which we just
[1:17:39] read beginning where the dead were
[1:17:41] brought before the Lord and judged
[1:17:43] according to their works and all whose
[1:17:46] names were not in the Book of Life were
[1:17:48] then cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:17:50] we now face the question as to why they
[1:17:53] should be given eternal life at the
[1:17:55] judgment
[1:17:56] for the epistle seems to be conclusive
[1:17:59] to point out that one must possess the
[1:18:01] spirit of Christ or perish
[1:18:04] though it seems thus we must not
[1:18:06] discredit the words of Jesus who most
[1:18:10] appointedly sets forth that there are
[1:18:12] some found in the Book of Life who will
[1:18:14] either receive eternal life before the
[1:18:17] general Resurrection which I just read
[1:18:19] in a record Another record or brother
[1:18:22] Brown said in a part of that record or
[1:18:24] in a section was the bride
[1:18:28] see it's not out of an well it's on one
[1:18:30] book
[1:18:31] but there's a section of that that
[1:18:33] pertains to bride only
[1:18:35] we just read it there in first John
[1:18:38] one of the scriptures
[1:18:40] now
[1:18:41] so
[1:18:44] see where it was no he said who will
[1:18:46] either receive eternal life before the
[1:18:48] general Resurrection
[1:18:50] or after it
[1:18:53] so there are some found in the book of
[1:18:55] life either receiving eternal life
[1:18:57] before
[1:18:58] the second Resurrection or after it
[1:19:03] and we read the scripture on Sunday the
[1:19:05] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[1:19:07] the First Resurrection on such the
[1:19:09] second death hath no power
[1:19:11] as speaking of the bride all right
[1:19:19] okay we're moving along
[1:19:34] the first resurrection has nothing to do
[1:19:36] with the second death now we know that
[1:19:38] we just read that scripture
[1:19:40] that is at the end of the thousand years
[1:19:42] the second Resurrection all the rest of
[1:19:45] the Dead live now I want to back up here
[1:19:48] a minute I'm going Beyond Myself here
[1:19:50] just a little bit
[1:19:51] let's back up here to Matthew 25 where
[1:19:54] we read
[1:19:55] 25 31-46.
[1:20:04] and there's only one thing I wanted that
[1:20:07] what are the the righteous we express
[1:20:09] that the righteous who the righteous are
[1:20:12] but who are the Brethren this is what I
[1:20:15] wanted to back up and get to
[1:20:20] and and and Jesus said in as much as you
[1:20:23] have done it unto the unto one of the
[1:20:25] least of these my brethren you've done
[1:20:28] it unto me
[1:20:30] so the first thing
[1:20:32] is who are the brethren
[1:20:34] and Jesus ants and and brother Branham
[1:20:37] answers that on paragraph 161
[1:20:40] and he said if there are those who enter
[1:20:43] into life eternal at the white Throne
[1:20:46] judgment
[1:20:48] now I'm going to answer something we
[1:20:49] we're going to go into here solely on
[1:20:51] the grounds of being good and kind
[1:20:57] okay
[1:20:59] and just and good and kind and just to
[1:21:03] the elect
[1:21:06] of God who are his brethren
[1:21:10] so who are his Brethren the elect of God
[1:21:15] that's his brother
[1:21:19] amen
[1:21:21] okay so then he said if we're gonna if
[1:21:25] we see that there and they're good and
[1:21:28] they're good and being good and kind to
[1:21:30] the elect of God who is Brethren then we
[1:21:32] cannot but accept that
[1:21:36] all right now I just want to answer that
[1:21:38] who are the brethren
[1:21:39] now
[1:21:41] but when you've done it unto the least
[1:21:43] of these my brother and you've done it
[1:21:45] unto me so we know the elect of the
[1:21:46] Brethren and brother Branham says in
[1:21:48] paragraph 143
[1:21:50] he says now who these Brethren are is
[1:21:54] the people of God who are The Living
[1:21:56] manifested Word or living epistle for
[1:22:00] their day
[1:22:02] amen look who they were doing it to
[1:22:06] who is this what is this message it's
[1:22:09] the son of man revealed in Bride form
[1:22:13] that's what the message is
[1:22:17] manifested again
[1:22:19] so who are these people and you know as
[1:22:22] well as I do in your life there's people
[1:22:24] that you know have done good to you
[1:22:28] never asking for it they had it in their
[1:22:30] heart to do it they didn't know who you
[1:22:33] were but they had it in their heart to
[1:22:35] do for you
[1:22:36] give to you
[1:22:38] how many has ever experienced that over
[1:22:40] and over again
[1:22:42] who are they doing it to
[1:22:45] you're born again who are they doing it
[1:22:47] to they're doing it to Jesus Christ
[1:22:52] amen you say well how do you well well
[1:22:54] the birth
[1:22:56] who is this birth in me who am I
[1:23:00] the prophet answered it he said you are
[1:23:02] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:23:04] and forever
[1:23:07] you're not another this outside man
[1:23:09] isn't him it's the Inside Man the birth
[1:23:12] word the birth seed how can his seed
[1:23:14] himself be birthed and not be himself
[1:23:19] are you with me that's pretty simple
[1:23:21] isn't it if he has a seed in you and
[1:23:24] that's him and he's birthed
[1:23:30] amen
[1:23:32] if if a human seed was in me and it's
[1:23:34] human and I'm birthed I'm human
[1:23:37] every seed shall bring forth of his kind
[1:23:40] then if he's that seed he's that seed in
[1:23:43] this birth what kind of kind are you
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:50] all right so he said see so we see
[1:23:54] that's what where that's what our pastor
[1:23:56] has been bringing this is the revelation
[1:23:57] of it is who you are
[1:24:02] the bride recognizes her position
[1:24:04] she recognizes who she is and relies
[1:24:08] upon who she is
[1:24:12] brother Bradham said the soul tells you
[1:24:14] the soul in the soul is who you really
[1:24:16] are
[1:24:18] it's not what you think in your mind you
[1:24:19] are it's what your soul
[1:24:21] speaks is who you are
[1:24:26] whatever's in that soul is who you are
[1:24:32] oh and every one of you have a soul
[1:24:36] and you have a spirit
[1:24:38] and you have a body
[1:24:42] who's speaking to you you don't see
[1:24:43] who's speaking to you
[1:24:45] because if you take this if you take the
[1:24:47] spirit the soul out of me
[1:24:50] you can speak all you want to me I'll
[1:24:52] never answer you back
[1:24:56] right so some part of me you don't see
[1:24:59] with your eyes
[1:25:01] and I don't see you the real you
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:11] all right
[1:25:13] so that's the part you must be sure of
[1:25:15] and take care of
[1:25:20] do all you want to this outer body but
[1:25:22] what's that Soul doing
[1:25:26] okay I don't want to get too carried
[1:25:28] away on that I'd lose time here okay so
[1:25:30] let's go that's gonna be another place
[1:25:34] I just want to stay focused here
[1:25:36] so I think I answered that so who's his
[1:25:39] Brethren who the righteous are
[1:25:41] all right now paragraph 141 the first
[1:25:44] resurrection has nothing to do with the
[1:25:46] second death
[1:25:48] or the or the second Resurrection
[1:25:51] the second Resurrection is at the end of
[1:25:53] the Thousand Years all the rest of the
[1:25:55] Dead live again and at that day there
[1:25:57] will be those who come forth to eternal
[1:25:59] life
[1:26:02] and those who are caught and those and
[1:26:05] those others who are caught in the
[1:26:08] second death
[1:26:09] now we do not need to guess about those
[1:26:13] who in the second Resurrection are given
[1:26:15] life we are told
[1:26:18] now where is he getting this we are told
[1:26:20] scriptures
[1:26:22] we are told it is given to them on the
[1:26:26] grounds that they have been kind and
[1:26:29] good to the brethren
[1:26:32] now God's working right among you you
[1:26:34] know you know people don't even realize
[1:26:36] what's taking place
[1:26:38] somebody does something someday and
[1:26:40] stand before you and said he was good to
[1:26:43] me Lord
[1:26:44] this is what he did there it is recorded
[1:26:47] see he did it
[1:26:50] and that was me yes you see me that's me
[1:26:52] that he did it too I give answer to it
[1:26:57] are you with me
[1:27:00] all right
[1:27:03] puts him on the right
[1:27:06] the separation of people
[1:27:09] not now we don't have to question how
[1:27:12] long it's going to be because the
[1:27:13] bride's in eternity
[1:27:15] already
[1:27:17] what's time to her
[1:27:22] are you with me
[1:27:23] I don't know how many billions times
[1:27:25] millions or millions or ten thousands
[1:27:27] times ten thousands
[1:27:30] thousands
[1:27:34] will stand before him
[1:27:36] or before her him and her is the same
[1:27:38] person
[1:27:42] all right
[1:27:44] if they stand before him stand before
[1:27:46] her they're standing before him if they
[1:27:48] stand before him they're standing before
[1:27:49] her
[1:27:54] okay
[1:27:55] now so they they they're told it is
[1:27:58] given to them on the grounds that
[1:27:59] they've been kind and good to the
[1:28:02] Brotherhood
[1:28:06] those who raise I'll just say this right
[1:28:08] now I'm going to come into it the next
[1:28:09] time I Minister those who are raised and
[1:28:12] cast of the Lake of Fire will be will be
[1:28:14] so because of their treatment
[1:28:17] because of the excuse me will be so
[1:28:20] treated because of their mistreatment of
[1:28:23] the brethren
[1:28:31] we're going to come into whose names are
[1:28:33] taken off the book
[1:28:34] do you realize that names are on the
[1:28:36] book and can be removed
[1:28:39] not the bride
[1:28:41] that's another record
[1:28:43] we just said it we brother Bram called
[1:28:45] an eternal life record and he went to
[1:28:48] the scripture to prove it
[1:28:51] she has the Sun how are you going to
[1:28:53] take the son's name off the book his own
[1:28:55] book
[1:28:58] okay
[1:28:59] Okay so
[1:29:01] so here now to further clarify paragraph
[1:29:03] 142 that was 141
[1:29:06] 142 to further clarify notice
[1:29:09] specifically the words of Matthew
[1:29:12] it does not in Matthew referring to
[1:29:14] 31-46 brother Brown referring to it does
[1:29:17] not say oh excuse me I already read that
[1:29:19] about a Shepherd okay now let's go back
[1:29:21] but these do not have
[1:29:26] and that cannot come in the judgment
[1:29:31] yeah these do not have eternal life in
[1:29:33] their possession now and they come into
[1:29:35] the Judgment they are allowed to go into
[1:29:39] eternal life
[1:29:40] and he just said why
[1:29:42] all right but for paragraph 143 and this
[1:29:45] is where we'll spend just a little bit
[1:29:47] more time and then then we'll we'll be
[1:29:49] able to leave off pretty quick but upon
[1:29:53] what ground do they enter into life
[1:29:56] I just love this message I love the word
[1:30:00] without a prophet you would know what
[1:30:03] Matthew 25 31-46 was really saying
[1:30:06] and who it's pertaining to
[1:30:11] amen all right now he says but upon what
[1:30:15] grounds do they enter into life
[1:30:17] eternal certainly and not on the fact
[1:30:19] that they already have his life as does
[1:30:21] the bride but they receive it because
[1:30:23] they were kind to his brethren
[1:30:26] they are not they are not these
[1:30:29] righteous in Matthew 25 31 46 are not
[1:30:32] his brethren
[1:30:34] they were kind to the brethren
[1:30:36] all right he said they are not his
[1:30:39] Brethren they that would make them joint
[1:30:41] heirs with Jesus they are not heirs to
[1:30:45] anything
[1:30:46] but life
[1:30:48] they share No throne with him there or
[1:30:52] Etc with him their names must have been
[1:30:54] in the Book of Life and not removed
[1:30:58] hahaha
[1:31:00] all right is that right who placed it
[1:31:02] there did they
[1:31:04] no
[1:31:07] God did
[1:31:09] okay now because of their love of the
[1:31:11] people of God why
[1:31:13] because of their Love Now where's that
[1:31:15] love coming from well I love that person
[1:31:18] I'll do good for him no they didn't even
[1:31:20] know they even loved them
[1:31:22] but yet the love of God was there to
[1:31:24] produce what they had to do toward them
[1:31:29] now listen
[1:31:30] they're going to be surprised at
[1:31:31] judgment as well as the as the goats
[1:31:35] and we'll come into that some more later
[1:31:37] too there's going to be great
[1:31:38] disappointments at judgment
[1:31:41] Lord Lord not all to say Lord Lord will
[1:31:45] enter in
[1:31:46] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:31:48] well we prophesied in your name we've
[1:31:50] done Mighty works in your name
[1:31:52] we've cast out Devils even spoken
[1:31:54] tongues and shouted and danced around
[1:31:56] and had emotion but that's not the
[1:31:58] evidence of the Holy Ghost being that's
[1:32:00] not the evidence of the atmosphere the
[1:32:02] right atmosphere comes by the word
[1:32:05] oh there's not a I'm saying the motion
[1:32:07] with it yes but the atmosphere is
[1:32:09] created by the word not because you had
[1:32:11] an emotional time
[1:32:15] amen I just thought I'd drop that in for
[1:32:17] extra measure all right now
[1:32:19] because of their love for the people of
[1:32:22] God they are recognized and saved
[1:32:26] no doubt these served and helped the
[1:32:30] children of God perhaps like Nicodemus
[1:32:34] what Nicodemus do well it came to you
[1:32:37] know it was a little afraid to little to
[1:32:39] show itself that he came at night but he
[1:32:41] did more than that he bought he bought a
[1:32:43] hundred pound weight
[1:32:45] of of spices
[1:32:49] are you with me for the burial of Jesus
[1:32:54] you say well that's nothing that's
[1:32:56] something
[1:32:58] he wasn't afraid to join up with Joseph
[1:33:02] of armathea
[1:33:05] who gave him his his tomb amen and
[1:33:10] produce the clothing that he put on him
[1:33:12] and went boldly to pilate and wanted the
[1:33:15] body when he was once trying to hide
[1:33:19] at least I'm not about to be ashamed by
[1:33:21] this I'm going to make myself boldly out
[1:33:23] before and that's what that's what the
[1:33:25] scripture say and that's what the
[1:33:27] prophet declares he boldly came to him
[1:33:31] they were good they were a help
[1:33:35] and here brother Branham saying No Doubt
[1:33:37] like Nicodemus and Gamaliel
[1:33:40] when Gamaliel stand up and said now be
[1:33:42] careful what you're doing
[1:33:45] if these men be of God you found
[1:33:47] fighting against God
[1:33:48] what did he do he stood in the place
[1:33:50] when they needed it
[1:33:55] and why would a prophet down here on
[1:33:56] this end refer to his name
[1:33:59] because
[1:34:02] he's going to be at the judgment and get
[1:34:04] eternal life for it
[1:34:07] and many others
[1:34:09] you think Amelia did he just did what
[1:34:12] was in his heart to do he had they said
[1:34:14] well he had wisdom and he respected the
[1:34:16] man and stopped it
[1:34:20] amen amen but he did the will of God
[1:34:27] all right they were good and kind he
[1:34:29] said no doubt they served and helped the
[1:34:31] children perhaps like Nicodemus Camellia
[1:34:33] they stood for the children in a time of
[1:34:35] trouble
[1:34:39] amen amen amen
[1:34:42] but these others had their names removed
[1:34:44] because they failed to honor the people
[1:34:46] of God
[1:34:48] wow
[1:34:51] you see
[1:34:53] God let me surrender everything to you
[1:34:56] let me know you
[1:34:59] don't let me try to say well I'll make
[1:35:01] it you won't even know what you're doing
[1:35:03] you may turn right around and take well
[1:35:05] I won't go there because that's I'll go
[1:35:07] in that later
[1:35:09] let's go and do it later
[1:35:12] all right
[1:35:14] also in the second Resurrection they're
[1:35:17] going to be Souls under the altar
[1:35:20] as set forth in the fifth seal
[1:35:22] the Jews
[1:35:24] standing for what they knew
[1:35:27] okay
[1:35:29] Brother Band makes that very clear they
[1:35:31] are given white robes and of course it'd
[1:35:33] be no point of white robes unless they
[1:35:35] were given eternal life
[1:35:37] not that judgment
[1:35:40] all right he also said particularly no
[1:35:43] particularly that none of those under
[1:35:45] the altar were killed for the testimony
[1:35:46] of Jesus
[1:35:48] they were not killed for the testimony
[1:35:49] of Jesus they come up in the
[1:35:51] resurrection received life because of
[1:35:53] their stand on the word
[1:35:55] now notice they cannot be bride material
[1:35:58] the bride turns the cheek and cried
[1:36:00] forgive them Father they know not what
[1:36:01] they do but they come up they come up
[1:36:04] and we're wanting vengeance
[1:36:08] amen you go back and read it Revelation
[1:36:11] 6 9-11
[1:36:13] okay
[1:36:15] they they these are Jews they had to be
[1:36:19] because they're in the facile and is in
[1:36:21] the fourth seal the Gentile Church bride
[1:36:23] the Gentile bride has gone in the
[1:36:24] Rapture these Jews aren't born of the
[1:36:27] spirit
[1:36:28] they don't even believe that Jesus is a
[1:36:30] messiah that yet they were blinded by
[1:36:32] God they were blinded by God
[1:36:35] they remember Israel still has three and
[1:36:37] a half years
[1:36:39] where their eyes will come open and 144
[1:36:42] 000 of them be sealed
[1:36:43] but they got to be martyred
[1:36:46] in the tribulation
[1:36:48] amen all right and they will come up
[1:36:51] with the regulation already having the
[1:36:53] seal
[1:36:56] all right now because there's there's
[1:36:59] the well I won't go there either because
[1:37:01] we'll get into that more all right
[1:37:06] these Jews aren't born they were blinded
[1:37:08] by God for the Gentile sake and God gave
[1:37:10] him eternal life on the grounds that
[1:37:12] though they could not come to him yet
[1:37:14] they were truly faithful to all the
[1:37:16] world they knew
[1:37:18] all the word they knew and they died
[1:37:22] for it as multitudes died under Hitler
[1:37:25] and Stalin and will yet and will yet
[1:37:29] die he said
[1:37:32] okay now we're going to turn another
[1:37:34] corner here
[1:37:36] stay with me I want to come back to
[1:37:38] these people that help and serve
[1:37:41] the children of God
[1:37:45] if you turn if you look in Isaiah 44 28
[1:37:48] I think we have time let's just take a
[1:37:50] little bit more time in Isaiah 40 in
[1:37:52] Isaiah
[1:37:54] 44.
[1:37:56] these are not long scriptures but I want
[1:37:58] to just point out a person you can study
[1:37:59] it later
[1:38:00] in Isaiah 44
[1:38:05] and is speaking of King Cyrus
[1:38:10] good to the people of God
[1:38:12] here's a gentile King
[1:38:17] paragraph or Isaiah 44 and verse 28.
[1:38:22] that saith of Zyra Cyrus so you read
[1:38:25] back and read about Cyrus
[1:38:27] that saith of Zyra of Cyrus
[1:38:31] he is my shepherd here's God speaking to
[1:38:33] him he is my shepherd and shall perform
[1:38:35] all my pleasure even saying to Jerusalem
[1:38:39] thou Thou shalt be built and to then and
[1:38:42] to and to the temple thy Foundation
[1:38:45] shall be laid
[1:38:48] think of that
[1:38:50] now here's a man that's doing the will
[1:38:51] of God a gentile a gentile King
[1:38:55] and God's saying he's going to do as my
[1:38:58] shepherd he's going to provide for them
[1:38:59] and he's going to give them the means to
[1:39:01] build rebuild that Temple which is my
[1:39:04] place of worship My Chosen place of
[1:39:06] worship is that right
[1:39:08] okay and he did that for an elect
[1:39:12] Nation all right and so he says now it
[1:39:16] comes down here 45 and verse
[1:39:20] one
[1:39:21] he said thus saith the Lord to his
[1:39:23] anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I
[1:39:26] have Holden to subdue Nations before him
[1:39:28] and I will loose the loins of Kings to
[1:39:30] open before him the two leave Gates and
[1:39:33] the gate shall not be shut
[1:39:36] and I will go before thee and make the
[1:39:38] Crooked places straight and I will break
[1:39:40] in pieces of gates of brass and cut in
[1:39:42] Sun to the bars of iron
[1:39:44] and he's and he goes on to say and I
[1:39:46] will give Thee the treasures of darkness
[1:39:48] and the hidden Riches of secret places
[1:39:50] that thou mayest know that I the Lord
[1:39:52] which called thee by name in the god of
[1:39:54] Israel that you'll know I'm the god of
[1:39:56] Israel
[1:39:57] for and it says now in the fifth verse
[1:40:02] all right now let's go a little further
[1:40:03] let's go down to the 13th verse
[1:40:07] I have raised him up Cyrus I have raised
[1:40:09] him up
[1:40:11] in righteousness and I will direct all
[1:40:13] his ways and he shall build my city and
[1:40:16] he shall let go my captives
[1:40:18] not for Price nor rewards saith the Lord
[1:40:21] of hosts
[1:40:23] so there's another help good to the
[1:40:26] people of God
[1:40:28] now we could go on others
[1:40:31] brother Branham speaking about in the
[1:40:32] hospital as a boy just bear with me a
[1:40:35] few more minutes
[1:40:36] in the hospital you know as a boy he was
[1:40:38] shotgunned he had a shotgun and he was
[1:40:40] losing blood laying in his own blood
[1:40:42] they couldn't get blood transfusion they
[1:40:44] didn't do it at that time all they could
[1:40:46] do is soak it up and that was it
[1:40:49] okay of course we know he was delivered
[1:40:51] the Lord delivered him had a set of legs
[1:40:54] he said perfect and he said but here he
[1:40:56] says and the next morning under those
[1:40:58] weakening conditions they didn't give
[1:41:00] blood transfusions they'd operated on me
[1:41:02] and they and they gave me ether and the
[1:41:05] old ether I guess you remember it's an
[1:41:06] old anesthetic I've had it myself
[1:41:08] personally and under that ether when I
[1:41:10] came out I was coming out of their ether
[1:41:12] after eight hours they had to give me so
[1:41:15] much they thought I couldn't wake up
[1:41:17] they couldn't get me awake and I
[1:41:19] remember Mrs rotor stood by me there in
[1:41:22] the hospital I'll never forget that
[1:41:23] woman
[1:41:26] see I'm just giving examples here I'll
[1:41:29] never forget that woman no matter what
[1:41:31] happens I shall never forget her she was
[1:41:33] just a young woman then her husband was
[1:41:35] the superintendent down there at the car
[1:41:37] works and I remember she's standing by
[1:41:39] me her and Mrs Stewart and they was and
[1:41:42] they was the one actually that paid that
[1:41:44] my hospital bill
[1:41:46] I don't even have food to eat I didn't
[1:41:48] even have food to eat in the house so we
[1:41:51] could how so how could I pay a hospital
[1:41:53] bill hundreds of dollars but she through
[1:41:56] her church society and the Ku Klux Klan
[1:42:00] paid the hospital bill for me Masons he
[1:42:04] meant he said that and he said Masons I
[1:42:07] can never forget them see no matter what
[1:42:10] they do or what I sh I still there's
[1:42:13] something there's something that stays
[1:42:15] with me see what they did for me and
[1:42:18] they paid the bill to Dr reader
[1:42:23] a help in time of need
[1:42:27] you think they did that from their heart
[1:42:29] sure they did
[1:42:32] they knew who they were doing they they
[1:42:34] didn't know he would be a prophet who he
[1:42:36] was he was that to begin with
[1:42:40] he wasn't even born yet again
[1:42:43] and yet he was seed
[1:42:45] a young boy promising God he said I went
[1:42:49] to hell I believe I've been to both
[1:42:50] places he said I went to hell
[1:42:52] saw that down there see he said don't
[1:42:56] you ever go that way he said I screamed

[1:43:00] mother there ice cream see
[1:43:02] God brought him back out he said I'll
[1:43:04] serve you Lord see he made a promise
[1:43:06] even before that
[1:43:08] anyway
[1:43:09] God see
[1:43:12] he had to go there to tell us what it
[1:43:13] was like
[1:43:15] amen the Mysteries had to be fulfilled
[1:43:18] completed finished
[1:43:20] what they did but he said I'll never
[1:43:22] forget it then spoke about a Catholic
[1:43:24] priest he said some of the best friends
[1:43:25] of what I know are Catholics
[1:43:28] hey do you realize that man may be
[1:43:30] sitting here tonight perhaps is the only
[1:43:32] way the only way we got this Tabernacle
[1:43:34] built because of a Roman Catholic stood
[1:43:36] on his feet in the court there and went
[1:43:38] to the front for me boy like nobody
[1:43:40] would do
[1:43:44] what he went to bat for him
[1:43:46] he said if if you others says that's
[1:43:48] right and they couldn't turn it down
[1:43:49] that's right they said
[1:43:51] they figured out it'd be too many people
[1:43:53] oh that won't make 80 more in that
[1:43:55] church like that that church is standing
[1:43:57] there and he said he said I know the
[1:43:59] pastor and all like that he said that
[1:44:01] church has been there said the rest of
[1:44:02] you can add to it then why can't they a
[1:44:04] Roman Catholic
[1:44:07] yes sir
[1:44:09] stood up didn't he all right what about
[1:44:12] the shunamite woman that built a house
[1:44:14] for Elijah
[1:44:15] recognize and be a righteous man
[1:44:21] build a room Simon the Cyrene board the
[1:44:23] cross
[1:44:24] for Jesus
[1:44:26] the Bible said he bored I could give you
[1:44:27] scripture that Luke 23 26 Joseph
[1:44:30] armathea which I already mentioned
[1:44:32] Nicodemus Mark 15 43 John 19 38-39
[1:44:38] you've heard of him speak of brother
[1:44:40] Carl Williams I knew the brother
[1:44:41] personally
[1:44:44] brother Carl was the was the president
[1:44:46] of the Phoenix chapter of the Full
[1:44:47] Gospel businessmans
[1:44:49] but he was the one when they wanted to
[1:44:52] put brother Branham out not he said we
[1:44:54] need to get rid of him we don't want him
[1:44:55] back preaching any more here at the at
[1:44:58] the Phoenix chapter or any chapter
[1:45:01] Carl said
[1:45:03] if he goes I go
[1:45:06] and they couldn't lose brother Carl
[1:45:08] because he's kind of wealthy
[1:45:12] big supporter
[1:45:14] but yet he stood up for brother Branham
[1:45:17] and gave him an open door he even made
[1:45:19] it public to the people he said If he if
[1:45:22] he don't stay neither do I
[1:45:27] and brother Brown's standing right by
[1:45:28] him
[1:45:29] he said brother Graham you ought to seen
[1:45:30] it he said how many want brother Brown
[1:45:32] to come back and he went out walking out
[1:45:34] there and he were piled a hundred dollar
[1:45:35] bills wanting him to come back and keep
[1:45:37] coming to Phoenix
[1:45:39] see it wasn't them
[1:45:43] it was the ones whose names had to be
[1:45:45] removed
[1:45:48] I just say it like that because they
[1:45:50] mistreated
[1:45:51] see
[1:45:53] all right
[1:45:54] now
[1:45:56] so he stood and even brother Branham
[1:45:58] even thanked him for it publicly
[1:46:01] so I'm not afraid to say what he said he
[1:46:02] said because he thanked him for it
[1:46:04] publicly about it so it's not a not a
[1:46:06] not a secret thing what happened
[1:46:12] and then brother Outlaw which had a
[1:46:14] church down in Jesus name Tabernacle
[1:46:16] down in Phoenix he said that man he's
[1:46:18] such a sweet man I'll never go anywhere
[1:46:20] or anything but he wants to always do
[1:46:22] something for me he said that's his way
[1:46:26] gave me an offering
[1:46:28] did everything always wanted to do for
[1:46:30] him he said that's just his way brother
[1:46:33] Outlaw never recognized the message
[1:46:36] of the hour but something in his heart
[1:46:39] said I want to help this man
[1:46:41] and brother Brandon if you ever if you
[1:46:43] ever heard that message when he preached
[1:46:44] the message who do you say this is the
[1:46:47] last time he preached it brother Jim
[1:46:49] Outlaws Church Jimmy Outlaw he laid it
[1:46:52] on the line I mean he just like he
[1:46:54] skinned it
[1:46:55] you know what I mean really strong
[1:46:58] and yet the man was always wanting to
[1:47:00] help him
[1:47:03] amen all right so we could go on and on
[1:47:05] with that but we'll stop right there
[1:47:07] let's turn to Genesis 14.
[1:47:11] just help me get through here now
[1:47:13] Genesis 14.
[1:47:16] and you're all mostly young in here so
[1:47:18] you can take a little less sleep
[1:47:20] Genesis 14
[1:47:27] and I want to just refer to and I won't
[1:47:29] have time to go into all of it but here
[1:47:32] and verse 24 he
[1:47:36] Abraham went out to return get his
[1:47:39] brother his his nephew lot bring him
[1:47:42] back
[1:47:44] his kings came into Sodom stole away all
[1:47:47] all the goods and took lot and he got
[1:47:49] some people together and went after him
[1:47:51] you know the story
[1:47:53] and it says and then and then
[1:47:57] and he said I've lifted my hands up to
[1:47:59] the Lord I'll not take a not even a shoe
[1:48:01] latch it I won't take anything even a
[1:48:04] threat even to a shoe latchet that I
[1:48:05] will not take anything that is thine
[1:48:07] lest they should say I have made Abram
[1:48:10] Rich he didn't do it for that see it's
[1:48:12] verse 24 save only that they which the
[1:48:14] young men have eaten and the portion of
[1:48:16] the men which went with me
[1:48:18] aener s call memory let them take their
[1:48:23] portion
[1:48:25] what were they I helped Abraham
[1:48:29] all right they were a help Genesis 18
[1:48:32] 23.
[1:48:34] when when when
[1:48:38] the angel and flesh went down was going
[1:48:40] down to Sodom
[1:48:42] and was heading down to Sodom to see
[1:48:46] the two witnesses already went down two
[1:48:48] angels and he was going down to Sodom
[1:48:50] the point I want to make here is
[1:48:53] Abraham's Drew near and said wilt thou
[1:48:55] destroy the righteous with the wicked
[1:49:00] verse 20
[1:49:02] that was 23 24 pre-adventure there'd be
[1:49:05] 50 righteous in the city without also
[1:49:07] destroyed not wilt thou just also
[1:49:10] destroy and not spare the place for the
[1:49:11] 50 righteous that are therein
[1:49:14] that be far from thee to do after this
[1:49:16] manner to slay a righteous with the
[1:49:18] wicked and the righteous should be as
[1:49:21] and that the righteous should be as the
[1:49:22] wicked that be far from thee shall not
[1:49:25] the judge of all Earth be right and the
[1:49:27] Lord said if I find in Sodom 50
[1:49:29] righteous within the city I will spare
[1:49:31] it
[1:49:32] and the place for thy sake and then he
[1:49:34] went down to as it goes down into into
[1:49:40] 45.
[1:49:43] and he said I'll spare it for 45.
[1:49:46] then 40. I'll spare it for 40. then 30
[1:49:49] I'll spare for 30.
[1:49:51] and B20 I'll spare it for 20. if there
[1:49:54] be 10 I will spare it for 10 righteous
[1:50:00] hey
[1:50:02] these weren't the Seed of Abraham
[1:50:06] but they were righteous
[1:50:08] you see the tie here I'm trying that
[1:50:10] brother Brown's saying here see all
[1:50:12] right
[1:50:14] and we know there wasn't 10.
[1:50:16] but they came out
[1:50:18] are you with me those righteous came out
[1:50:22] Matthew 25 speaks of the foolish virgin
[1:50:25] we won't read all that scripture but we
[1:50:28] just read a portion
[1:50:30] and now let me read what the prophet
[1:50:32] said first about this but Matthew 25 and
[1:50:36] I'm not going to take time now I'm
[1:50:37] trying to go through this you can real
[1:50:39] quickly here
[1:50:41] Matthew 25
[1:50:44] just a little study Matthew 25
[1:50:49] and it says and then the Kingdom of
[1:50:51] Heaven shall be likened unto ten virgins
[1:50:54] that took their lamps and went forth to
[1:50:56] meet the bridegroom five of them were
[1:50:58] wise and five were foolish
[1:51:00] okay you know the rest of the story
[1:51:03] I'm not going to go any further with
[1:51:04] that
[1:51:05] but what are foolish
[1:51:09] why are they foolish why were they
[1:51:11] called foolish
[1:51:13] foolish means and brother Branham said
[1:51:15] about the foolish virgin they said he
[1:51:18] said they were dilatory
[1:51:20] meaning that they were slow to act
[1:51:23] and that they were slack and sluggish
[1:51:25] and stalling
[1:51:32] and let me say this
[1:51:35] that they're also considered righteous
[1:51:38] because they are saved
[1:51:41] but not on this side
[1:51:43] they don't have eternal life as the
[1:51:45] bride does now they get it at the
[1:51:47] Judgment now watch foolish means to be
[1:51:50] void of understanding why were they void
[1:51:52] of understanding no oil
[1:51:55] they lacked Revelation no Revelation
[1:51:57] they could not receive nor hear the
[1:52:00] message for the season
[1:52:04] amen yet they are standing right amidst
[1:52:07] the bride for a reason
[1:52:10] and I'm going to come to that you just
[1:52:11] give me I've got to get this because if
[1:52:13] I don't it won't fit
[1:52:15] all right now listen void of
[1:52:17] understanding and void of sound judgment
[1:52:20] that's what foolish means
[1:52:22] unwise acting without judgment or
[1:52:26] discretion
[1:52:28] in particular things so they're acting
[1:52:31] unwisely acting without judgment or
[1:52:35] discretion in other words they have no
[1:52:37] discernment they have no Holy Ghost
[1:52:38] discernment
[1:52:41] to recognize the hour they're in oh they
[1:52:44] believe it's God sent a prophet
[1:52:47] they will stand with that I got proof of
[1:52:49] that in Joshua
[1:52:51] they listened to what a prophet said but
[1:52:53] they didn't catch the revelation of his
[1:52:55] message
[1:52:57] amen
[1:52:58] all right so he said now what is the
[1:53:01] wise the wise are having the power which
[1:53:05] is the Holy Ghost
[1:53:06] because it's nothing of a carnal self
[1:53:09] so the wise have the power of discerning
[1:53:15] and judging correctly of between what is
[1:53:18] true and what is false
[1:53:21] between what is fit and proper and what
[1:53:24] is improper as a wise Magistrate
[1:53:29] a judge
[1:53:31] all right what is spit and proper
[1:53:35] see we're speaking of the Bride so it's
[1:53:36] no carnal power of their own nor wisdom
[1:53:38] of man but the Holy Ghost in you not
[1:53:41] your wisdom or or life it's his
[1:53:46] that's the wise virgin
[1:53:48] they have revelation
[1:53:51] which identifies them as an identified
[1:53:54] Abel
[1:53:56] to be the seed
[1:53:58] amen what was the difference between
[1:54:00] Cain and Abel revelation
[1:54:03] Faith the face seed
[1:54:07] amen all right now this is what brother
[1:54:10] Brown said in paragraph 148 it is the
[1:54:13] second Resurrection
[1:54:14] wherein the five foolish virgins come up
[1:54:18] notice that they were virgins they did
[1:54:21] not have the Holy Spirit so they missed
[1:54:24] being in the bride
[1:54:26] while the five wise who had oil became
[1:54:29] part of that bride
[1:54:31] but these people being a separated
[1:54:34] god-loving people
[1:54:36] and trying to abide in the word
[1:54:38] according to what they knew of it
[1:54:43] they're trying to abide in the message
[1:54:45] of what they know of it
[1:54:49] amen they say how do you know it's the
[1:54:51] message because I've got a scripture
[1:54:53] that says they crossed over with them
[1:54:55] across Jordan and went to fight and
[1:54:57] helped them fight
[1:54:59] foreign
[1:55:01] all right now he said
[1:55:05] and we're about ready to close here bear
[1:55:07] with me and he said
[1:55:15] what they knew of it and being it's in
[1:55:17] other words they walked in what light
[1:55:18] they had and being helped in the work of
[1:55:21] the and being a help in the work of the
[1:55:24] Lord will come up at the end of time
[1:55:27] they will miss the Millennium which we
[1:55:30] can begin to see by these truths is much
[1:55:32] more important than wonderful than we
[1:55:34] ever believed
[1:55:36] okay who's the Millennium for the bride
[1:55:41] all right
[1:55:42] all these people had their names in The
[1:55:45] Book of Life and their names remain
[1:55:49] so you have the foolish virgin and the
[1:55:52] others
[1:55:55] both were a help both were good to the
[1:55:57] people of God
[1:55:58] amen now let's let's clarify this right
[1:56:01] here at the end here
[1:56:03] about
[1:56:05] this foolish virgin let's go back to
[1:56:07] Joshua let's get these scriptures real
[1:56:09] quick and you can study it and I said
[1:56:12] just hitting the high points of this the
[1:56:14] Joshua chapter 1
[1:56:19] the Book of Joshua chapter 1.
[1:56:24] and verse 12 and the rubinites and the
[1:56:27] gadites and half tribe of Manasseh
[1:56:30] notice half tribe
[1:56:34] spake Joshua's saying remember the word
[1:56:37] which Moses the servant of the Lord or
[1:56:39] brother Branham the servant of the Lord
[1:56:40] commanded you
[1:56:43] hello saying
[1:56:47] the servant of the Lord saying the Lord
[1:56:51] your God hath given hath given you rest
[1:56:54] in other words they've already received
[1:56:56] their their lot
[1:56:57] given them rest
[1:56:59] and hath given you this land this land
[1:57:02] being on the other side
[1:57:05] of
[1:57:07] Jordan
[1:57:08] the East Side the rising side Sun of the
[1:57:11] side not the promised land of the Holy
[1:57:14] Ghost
[1:57:17] are you hearing me
[1:57:20] all right they they weren't given that
[1:57:22] but there was a half tribe in Manasseh
[1:57:24] that did
[1:57:25] the NASA was the firstborn
[1:57:28] are you with me
[1:57:31] but remember His Hands crossed Jacob's
[1:57:33] hands went over to Ephraim which was a
[1:57:36] type of the Gentile
[1:57:40] but Manasseh was the firstborn so half
[1:57:43] of them had their inheritance outside of
[1:57:47] the promise
[1:57:49] and half of them had it inside
[1:57:53] five were foolish
[1:57:56] and five were wise
[1:57:58] half
[1:58:01] I don't think that's by chance
[1:58:04] see all right so then we see here and
[1:58:09] then we go to Joe to Joshua 22.
[1:58:13] let's go to Joshua 22 and find at their
[1:58:17] end
[1:58:19] thank you for being patient I know I'm
[1:58:21] taking a little more time than is normal
[1:58:23] but not abnormal necessarily
[1:58:26] for me and for
[1:58:29] others besides Chris
[1:58:31] all right
[1:58:35] I wish I could do that brother Chris
[1:58:38] I can't be you
[1:58:41] all right
[1:58:44] Joshua 22.
[1:58:47] I say 22.
[1:58:51] oh I'm in judges no wonder I can't find
[1:58:53] it
[1:58:54] all right
[1:58:57] Joshua 22 there we go okay now we got it
[1:59:02] and verse 1 then Joshua called the
[1:59:04] rubinites and the gadites the others see
[1:59:07] because they went over and helped too
[1:59:09] they were help also are you with me
[1:59:12] notice how brother Branham divided these
[1:59:16] amen because he said then also besides
[1:59:19] these others there's a tribulation
[1:59:21] saints come up and get life
[1:59:24] okay
[1:59:25] now he says now Joshua called the
[1:59:28] rubinites and the gadites and the half
[1:59:30] tribe of Manasseh and said unto them you
[1:59:33] have all kept all that Moses brother
[1:59:35] Branham the servant of the Lord
[1:59:36] commanded you as much as they knew
[1:59:39] and have obeyed my voice and all that I
[1:59:42] command you
[1:59:44] you have not left your brother in these
[1:59:46] many days on this day but have kept the
[1:59:49] charge of the Commandment of the Lord
[1:59:51] your God and now the Lord your God hath
[1:59:53] given rest unto your brethren
[1:59:57] are you with me in other words Brethren
[1:59:59] meaning they were of the same Nation
[2:00:01] all right
[2:00:03] as as he promised them therefore now now
[2:00:07] in other words you help them come to
[2:00:09] rest but when it come to the positioning
[2:00:12] of them in the land
[2:00:14] they couldn't be positioned in the land
[2:00:16] are you with me
[2:00:18] they were positioned on the other side
[2:00:21] now
[2:00:22] so it's a type
[2:00:26] and therefore now return you and get
[2:00:28] into your tents and into the land of
[2:00:30] your possession which Moses to servant
[2:00:32] of the lord gave you on the other side
[2:00:35] of Jordan
[2:00:43] okay
[2:00:44] and we could go on but and now
[2:00:48] now to the one-half tribe of Manasseh
[2:00:50] Moses had given possession in Bastion
[2:00:52] but unto the other half therefore gave
[2:00:55] Joshua among their Brethren on this side
[2:00:57] Jordan Westward that was them in the
[2:01:00] land
[2:01:01] and Joshua sent them away and it goes on
[2:01:03] to say that he gave the possession of
[2:01:05] the other half of Manasseh to this
[2:01:08] setting of the Sun
[2:01:09] or the rising of the sun on the east
[2:01:11] side
[2:01:13] all right now
[2:01:23] these of the foolish virgins also are
[2:01:27] those who do not worship the Beast
[2:01:29] paragraph 152 or become involved in the
[2:01:32] Antichrist system but die for their
[2:01:35] faith tribulation even though they are
[2:01:38] not in the bride not having been born
[2:01:40] again but they will come up in the
[2:01:42] second resurrection and go into
[2:01:45] eternal life
[2:01:46] I think I'll just just
[2:01:49] leave it off
[2:01:51] let me see make sure I've just got
[2:01:52] others here nope that's all right
[2:01:56] they suffered persecution it was
[2:01:58] martyred
[2:01:59] amen
[2:02:00] amen the foolish virgin were not lost
[2:02:02] brother Brown was asked the question are
[2:02:04] the five foolish virgins lost he said no
[2:02:06] they are not lost they are saved in the
[2:02:08] judgment
[2:02:11] amen I could give you
[2:02:14] the quotations on those and where those
[2:02:17] are found if you'd like to have it
[2:02:21] they're judged at the judgment
[2:02:23] and as long as they are virgins they are
[2:02:26] before God see their sheep on the right
[2:02:28] side and not sheep of course as sheep on
[2:02:31] the right side amen
[2:02:34] okay
[2:02:37] then we have that previously shown that
[2:02:40] those who stood for the bride and were
[2:02:42] an aid and comfort to her those had
[2:02:45] their names remaining on The Book of
[2:02:47] Life
[2:02:50] and so we have a part that is bride we
[2:02:53] have a part that is kept that must might
[2:02:55] enter into eternal life in the second
[2:02:57] resurrection and part of it which is
[2:02:59] accounted chaff is burned in the Lake of
[2:03:01] Fire
[2:03:04] God bless you
[2:03:05] let's stand
[2:03:09] who's going to discern who's going to be
[2:03:12] able to discern these spirits that are
[2:03:14] so close I think I'll leave that
[2:03:16] but we do know this
[2:03:19] we do know this
[2:03:22] that
[2:03:24] there's only one that's going to discern
[2:03:26] it
[2:03:28] only the elector for Destiny will be
[2:03:30] able to detect the difference between
[2:03:32] them
[2:03:33] why
[2:03:37] they're born again
[2:03:39] thank God for the discerner let's bow
[2:03:42] our heads in prayer our heavenly father
[2:03:44] thank you for giving the people patience
[2:03:46] to wait and listen
[2:03:49] Lord may be others who can listen

[2:03:55] controversy Lord who are those people
[2:03:58] why they have received life the Lord
[2:04:03] I believe it's been answered
[2:04:07] and Lord our our desire I desire
[2:04:11] I'm sure there's others sitting here
[2:04:13] tonight or standing Lord to their desire
[2:04:16] don't let me
[2:04:18] miss the Rapture don't leave me here
[2:04:22] Lord as your Prophet call now don't
[2:04:24] leave me here don't let me go through
[2:04:26] that time

[2:04:29] the time of judgment
[2:04:31] on the earth time of Chaos
[2:04:36] martyrdom killing
[2:04:39] Lord

[2:04:45] that is in possession now of eternal
[2:04:47] life I commit this service to you and
[2:04:50] those that will listen to it later
[2:04:51] wherever it may go it's in your hands in
[2:04:55] thy name the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:05:00] [Music]

[2:05:30] you couldn't pull you couldn't have a
[2:05:33] pull for him unless he put it there
[2:05:39] you can't have a desire for him unless
[2:05:42] he had the desire for you
[2:05:45] you couldn't choose him unless he had
[2:05:47] chosen you
[2:05:49] did you know that
