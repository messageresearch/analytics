But the bladed saint heard me when I cried. Then he threw his robe around me and he led me to his fold. And I'm living on the hallelujah side. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the hallelujah's roy praises far and wide. For I've opened up toward heaven all the windows of my soul, and I'm living on the hallelujah side. Though the world may sweep around me with her dazzle and her dream, yet I am. For my soul looks up to heaven where the golden sunlight gleams. And I'm living on the hallelujah side. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the hallelujah's ro. Help me ring my savior's praises far and wide. For I've opened up toward heaven all the windows of my soul. And I'm living on my hallelujah side. Not for all those golden millions when I leave this precious place. Though the tempter to persuade me off has tried. For I'm safe in God's pavilion, happy in his love and grace. And I'm living on the hallelujah side. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the hallelujah ro. Help me ring my savior's praises far and wide. For I've opened up toward heaven all the windows of my soul. And I'm living on the hallelujah side. Here the sun is always shining. Here the sky is always bright. is no blame. Cream me Christians to abide for my soul is filled with music and my heart with great delight. And I'm living on the hallelujah side. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the hallelujah's ro. Help me ring my savior's praises far and wide. For I've opened up toward heaven all the windows of my soul, living on the hallelujah side and upon the streets of glory. When we reach the other shore and have safely crossed the Jordan's rolling tide, you will find me shouting glory just outside my mansion door where I'm living on the hallelujah side. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the hallelujah roll me ring my Savior's praises far and wide. For I've opened up toward heaven all the windows of my soul. And I'm living on the hallelujah side. Amen. Go to verse four for a second here. For my soul is filled with music. &gt;&gt; For some reason, this made me think of this while we're singing this, but Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Does anybody ever get I don't know. I sing to myself all the time. My daughter and I were joking about we sing in the car and sometimes, you know, you belt it out, whatever. But when I get a song stuck in my head, I don't know about you, when I get a song stuck in my head, I will go to sleep and it's going to my head and that's all I dream about sometimes. I'm glad I'm not the only one. Praise God. Sometimes you just get something in there and but it makes you makes you think about I don't know. You wake up and what's better waking up and saying he has made me glad or I'm living on the hallelujah side. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Blessed assurance. Blessed assuring Jesus is mine. Oh what a foraste [Music] of glory divine air of salvation. I'm purchased of God, born of his spirit, washed in his blood. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. I'm praising my savior all the day long. Perfect submission, perfect delight. Visions of rapture now burst on my side. Angels descending, bringing from above. Echoes of mercy, whispers of love. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my Savior all the day long. Perfect submission. All is at rest. I in my savior am happy and blessed. Watching and waiting. I'm looking above along with his goodness. Lost in his love. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my Savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. I'm praising my Savior [Music] all the day long. Amen. Praise God. That was what was going through my head this morning when I woke up. Amen. I I read an article a while back and it was talking about the first seven minutes after you wake up in the morning. Said the first seven minutes of how you wake up in the morning. They've done studies on this and it will actually program you for the day. &gt;&gt; So, what are you thinking about when you get up? Are you thinking about how you got a stressful day at work? &gt;&gt; Are you, I don't know, &gt;&gt; scrolling on Facebook? I don't know. Or are you thinking this is my story? This is my song. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have my days. I mean, there's days I got a stressful day at work and that's what I'm thinking about when I get up. But I feel so much better. Amen. when I'm thinking about the word of God. Praise the Lord. Amen. As we get ready to go to prayer this morning, I just want to sing up that little chorus. I love you, Lord. And I lift my voice. I love you, Lord. And I lift my voice to worship you. Oh my soul, rejoice. Take joy, my king in what you hear. Let it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear. And I love you, Lord. And I lift my voice to worship you. Oh my soul rejoice. [Music] Take joy my king in what you hear. Let it be a sweet sweet sound in your ear. Amen. Amen. He loves the praise of his saints. Amen. Amen. We have a number of requests this morning. I'm going to ask our brother Sergey if he'd come this morning. Just take these before the Lord in prayer. It's good to see our brother Sergey this morning. Amen. I want to remember our sister April. Um the Lord just be with her. Continue to remember our sister Dorcas for a complete healing in her body. Amen. Want to remember our brother Pashant and sister Koncha and little Isaac that he'd be completely well. Amen. Also want to remember uh sister Luba this morning. She um is going back to the doctor I believe on Tuesday. Um and she'll get a report of you know how things are. We're just looking to hear a good report and the and and for a healing. Amen. Amen. Um, remember our sister Susan Hlet. She's not feeling well home today. And for our brother Trevor who's also homesick this morning. Amen. Lord, just touch them. Raise them up. Amen. Um, we want to just remember our sister Ulia who'll be traveling home Tuesday as well. Um, want to remember the saints in Venezuela. They're going through a lot down there. um daily their money is devaluing and things aren't getting any cheaper. They're getting more expensive as it goes. So, it's just a just hold them up in prayer. Amen. Um we just want to remember the saints around the Northwest, the different ones, the different churches. Um talking to brother Adam last week. Um and I I forget things, but I want to remember the saints there in Cloverdale with the passing of brother Ed. Amen. just be with them. Um, and then the different ones around the area, the ones in northern Idaho and Tri Cities up there, northwest Washington. Amen. And brother Rich, uh, Brother Abel's church there. Uh, dad's preaching there this morning. So, they just, Lord, just be with them. Amen. I believe that's it. I think I've got everything on there. If you have a need this morning, Amen. Just lift it to him. committed unto him. Trust in him. Amen. [Music] If you wouldn't mind just one scripture, James 2, James 2:1 16 when James says 14 actually. What do what do you profit my brethren? Thou a man says he says faith but have no works can face save him. And what struck me if you looking at the original transcript there is one little word that's not translated into English Bible. It says can this face and for me like Lord it can be my faith but I need your faith that is able to give me revelation can give me changing of my body giving me healing salvation of my family so forth. So let's bow our hands. Heavenly father it's such a privilege to know you. It's such a privilege to know that you you promised and means for us that you will give us this face, your face, this revelation, knowing and understanding that that's that's the reality. That's not only the words on the paper book. That's you himself that made himself real and available for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever we ask Lord I know I know if we have your faith and your faith is the revelation that's knowing that's that's your will that we would be healed because that's part of the calary that our family would be saved cuz that's our promise Lord. Thank you. Thank you for your word Lord. That's the only source of strength and liberty for us and freedom. Lord, we pray about all these needs. You know, we have need in our family and we expecting nothing else but full deliverance and good report following week. We have all these needs in sister Dorca's family and brother Trevor's family and so forth. Every single bench right here, we are needed people, Lord. and we pray so you can come and feel this have this liberty in our lives. Lord, we love you and we asking to be with us and with us. We love you Lord and give everything in your hands. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats this morning. Well, you may have your seats as long as you promise to sing real well on this next song because it's normally one I'd have you stand for. Amen. Number 717, Joel's Army. I just felt like singing this this morning. I love this song. Morning stars together sing. Sons of God, his praises ring. Rise and shine. My Lord and King comes for redemption now to bring on he comes in view. Stalward men and women true perfect stand. We are God's best invincible through the great word tag. Son of righteousness shall shine with healing in his wings he'll ride. Shake this old world in one more ride. and take his bride into the sky. Have you considered my little bride? Off to deceive her. You have tried. No fairer one. From east to west, ordained to stand in the great word. The line of Judah has prevailed. Almighty God in flesh was veiled. He comes forth now to conquer all the kingdoms of this world shall fall. Oh bridegroom come our hearts to pine upon thy bom to recline. My lovely bride, you are my own. Come sit with me upon my throne. The line of Judah has prevailed. Almighty God in flesh was veiled. He comes forth now to conquer all the kingdoms of this world shall fall. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's uh number 231. [Music] Come to my soul, precious Jesus, my Lord. Hear me, oh Savior divine. Open the fountain and cleanse me, oh Lord, and give me a heart like thine. Come to my soul, precious Jesus, my Lord. Hear me, oh Savior divine. Open the fountain and cleanse me, oh Lord. Give me a heart like thine. One more time. Come to my soul, precious Jesus, my Lord. Hear me, oh Savior divine. Open the fountain and cleanse me, oh Lord. Give me a heart, my glad. [Music] Amen. As we ask our brother Paul to come this morning. Last song here is just I sang it a couple weeks ago, but just been on my heart so much. Like I said, couple couple days this last week, just wake up and that's first thing playing in my head. But more of you, more of you. Amen. believe that's your desire this morning. Hallelujah. Number 2312. Sorry. There you go. [Music] More of you. More of you. I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. of things. I've had my fill, but yet I hunger still empty and bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. More of you. More of you. I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. of things I've had my fear. But yet I hunger still empty and bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. [Music] More of you. More of you. I've had it all. But what I need is more of you. Of things I've had my fear, but yet I hunger still. Empty and bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. Let's just stand and sing it one more time. Just sing it out to him. Just tell him you want more of him in your life. Amen. Raise your hands and praise him this morning. Amen. More of you. More of you. I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. of things I've had my fill. But yet I hunger still prayer for more of you. empty and bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. [Music] God bless you this morning, saints. Always find it amazing. I don't know why we don't maybe God intended for us to just find it amazing but how that we can come and just a song service someone else's anointing that's been laid upon them can just touch right down a vein that you know God's been dealing with you just your thoughts and it just comes right to you and you realize you know we as humans may never come in a natural one mind and one accord. Amen. It won't come in that human element that we all just view everything the same. But when the Holy Spirit starts to move, draws us right into one mind and one accord, one desire of our hearts, leading us in one direction to come in the presence of God. Amen. I I bring greetings. Uh, brother Isaac already shared the need, a reminder of the needs in Venezuela. Uh, and uh, what's happening with the saints there as as time goes forward, it's if you can even find the product, if you can even find the the loaf of bread or the gallon of milk, uh, the prices, um, their currency devalues every single day. And uh it just put a lot of pressure. But God is faithful. Can someone say amen this morning? God is faithful and he is supplying needs. But uh we just want to do the greatest thing as brother Brandham said, the greatest thing we can do for someone is to pray for them. Amen. So we could send all the money in the world, but uh we know the scripture tells us that the poor will be with us always. And that has nothing to do with our salvation. But let's not let the ease of our life right &gt;&gt; cause us to become lukewarm. Amen. Let us remain on fire. So I bring greetings from brother George Smith to you and uh desire for you to pray. I want to speak to you today. Amen. On the thought or title, God bless you musicians. Thank you very much. Amen. On being complete in him. Amen. and we take this out uh of um scripture and message and um we will just uh by God's grace be able to expound upon this as you turn in Colossians the 2 chapter verses 1-10 um and uh you know it's interesting how when the Lord lays something on your heart you don't even remember that certain scripture contain certain words and so as you you turn uh to these things, you come back and realize wait here Colossians the 2 chapter first verse he he says I for I would that you know what great conflict I have for you for them at Le Oysia. So there is a a great conflict for the needs of the saints of the believers at Leodysia. So, amen. God was mindful. Placed us right here in the scripture. And you say, "Well, but that was for a different time and place." No, twofold. Amen. It's for this day. And for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and at all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this actually started out uh in a in my little study on the mystery of God. And that's what brought me originally to to Colossians was just studying in the mystery and then it just started to unfold. Amen. And of the Father and of Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in spirit, joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ. Now, beholding your order, my brother and sister, this study goes a little deeper. I'll just touch the edge of it. But you see, God sets everything in order. He is not an author of chaos. And so this being in order is that we as believers would come and in the way that God has brought it to us, the way he's revealed his word, that we can see how to be orderly. And you can study those words out. Be orderly not only in the house of God, which we should be in our own households, as we should be, &gt;&gt; but in our everyday life. Right. &gt;&gt; Be orderly. Amen. So, it's a bigger subject than that. So, I I'll just move on from there. Amen. And so, in this order and steadfastness of your faith in Christ, as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him, rooted and built up in him, established in the truth, as you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware, lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. So this verse right here, if you expand on it or expound on it, you'll realize that verse 8 is where the denominational church of this day is at. They are in philosophy. They are in deceit. And they're in a tradition of men. That's right. &gt;&gt; When they write their books that say, "If you're going to be a good whatever it might be, you will do this and this and this." We were uh in in the parking lot and sister Jerry pointed out to me a vehicle that uh was saying, "Pray the rosary to bring peace to it, &gt;&gt; to save America." Amen. Now my brother and sister, you can have all the rosaries you want. It won't save America. &gt;&gt; That's not what it is. Now maybe the original intention of the rosary was maybe focused in somewhat the right direction that they they wanted something a way of worship. But you see, they worship their tradition now, not the god that they thought they were. And so we have to be very careful that we do not come after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power. &gt;&gt; Heavenly father we just ask you to bless the service today. Lord just help us father to speak what you desire to be spoken. Anoint the word to each heart father to each need. We ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. And as I was reading this scripture, being led there, as I said, uh looking at mystery and uh looking that and coming, it just something leaped out as it were. And I thought, there's really where the Lord was bringing me to to look at this thought of being complete in him. And uh it just really caught my heart. And I thought, you know, that's what we want to be. We can be a, if you don't mind me just speaking it kind of bluntly, we can be a good message believer and and fulfill everything that the tenants of the message lay out before us. But my brother and sister, if we're not rooted in him, then we might as well pray to the rosary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that a little blunt? &gt;&gt; But it's true, &gt;&gt; right? The relationship's not with the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's with Jesus Christ. That's where we have to be is in him. And if we're always feeling insufficient, now I know that if we were honest with ourselves this morning, I would never ask you to lift your hands, but I'll just be the guinea pig. I'll lift my hand. I feel insufficient all the time. I feel like I could have done more here. I could have done better there. I should have this. I should have that. But my brother and sister, you have to come to a place that your confidence in Jesus Christ is so great that when the word says that you are complete in him, you will bypass or overlook every shortcoming you feel in your life and say the word says I'm going to be complete in him and I believe that I will be complete in him. Is it a long drawn out process? Yes. Maybe it might be a very long drawn out process but God has called us. Amen. Remember the word says you are elect. Now elect is not by chance. Elect is chosen. And we are standing here this morning as sons and daughters of God. We have been elected of God. And we have been chosen of God to fulfill his word. Now it's not necessarily how you feel about it. But let me tell you, if you have a confidence of who you are in Jesus Christ, it will change your entire outlook on the word of God. You'll no longer be looking at this as woe unto me. But you'll look at this and say, "Wait, I was chosen and I am going to live to the standard that I was called to." Amen. We were not called or chosen to be mediocre Christians. We were not called to be those that said, "Well, if I was only this, if I was only that." But human nature, Amen. We are humans here today, aren't we? Amen. You know, on the internet, you don't know what's AI and what's real anymore, right? They that they're blurring the lines of it. And I want you to know that doesn't have to do with a commercial about a car or this, that, or the other. That's what Satan is doing. He's so blurring the lines between what is real and what is not that people without the Holy Ghost can't tell the difference. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you've been called, elected, chosen to know the difference. Something inside of you is there speaking to you saying this is the word and I believe it absolutely. Amen. So it's there that I love those words complete in him. Now, I don't think I gave this uh I know I didn't give this to to the brothers, but uh brother Brandham in the sermon uh water baptism, he says this uh words right here. And you are complete in him, &gt;&gt; not in no church. Now, this is pretty blunt. Some people might not like this quote and I'm sorry if you don't, but not in no church, not in the Brham tabernacle, not in the association, but you are complete and safe in Jesus Christ. Amen. So, as message believers, we wouldn't say we're message believers if we didn't believe God sent a prophet in this hour. If we didn't believe that he sent a word and opened it to you and I, the word that would be our path to redemption, a word that would uh break forth a seed that's in us and and start to see life come forward. We wouldn't claim to be that if we didn't believe that or we shouldn't anyway. Let's be honest with ourselves. So it's there as we come as message believers, we realize the very significance that brother Brandham's saying that it's not in no church and not in Brandham Tabernacle. Amen. So we could go to church in Brandham Tabernacle all the days of our life and miss it. If you remember, there was a neighbor of brother Brandham. She come to church. Amen. And they ask her, you know, hey, I I don't remember the exact wording, but you know, it's like you you don't really change. You don't really follow it. and she says, "Oh, I go just because I love to hear Billy preach." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what she got out of it was something that that she just loved to hear him preach. She was not receiving the depth of the revelation that God was using a prophet to unfold. She just enjoyed how he preached. Amen. I imagine today, if you don't mind me being this blunt, there's a lot of people go to church to a certain church because they like the way the preacher preaches. But we're here today, my brother and sister, because we like how the Holy Spirit speaks to us. &gt;&gt; It's not about the man himself that stands up and opens a book and has a thought and presents it to you, but we need to be in love with the voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that voice is what's speaking to you and I, bringing us ever closer to him. Amen. Now, let's turn in Hebrews the 12th chapter:es 1 through3. Amen. Now this scripture, we all know it so well. Amen. Very well. Wherefore, seeing we're also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight &gt;&gt; and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Now, before I get too far from this verse, we have a cloud of witnesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's interesting because you see when that witness was fresh, there was there were those that would not agree with it. But as time has went on and the witnesses are slowly being taken from the scene. They're passing from the scene. And you know, as you look at that, you realize that that those that were firsthand are now disappearing, &gt;&gt; right? And the voice of dissent is rising up &gt;&gt; as though it never happened. That's not the way it was. It wasn't this. It wasn't that. But you see, when it was present, they didn't raise up. They didn't have a voice against it. You notice the voices of descent become louder the further they got from Egypt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the closer they got to the promised land, the voices of dissent got bold. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they come out and they declared that Moses was a mistake and Moses wasn't able and Moses had this problem and that problem. But my brother and sister, as the closer they got to the promised land, the voice of disscent rose, but the faith of the people, in this case, we understand the scripture, it was those that had been through Egypt and been influenced by the spirits of Egypt, the influence of Leodysia, if you want to put it that way. They had been conditioned to a place that if God didn't just do it like they thought it should be done, then God must not be going to do it. But God said, "I gave you a promise. I will perform my promise." &gt;&gt; And so it was that God registered or laid it down into the heart of the younger generation. Amen. And I believe virtually in our midst here. Now I you might say, "Brother Paul, you're missing this. Making an assumption." But I think spiritually every one of us will qualify under a younger generation. Amen. Where the opening of the word is coming to its full fruition. Amen. Not talking about the word in theory, so to speak, or talking about the word in a faroff promise, but a word coming to pass. A word that's brought right before us that's very, very real. And we know it's real. Amen. And so as it was that generation come and they're getting there and it comes and I always like this sorry if I've used it too many times through the years but they come to the Jordan River. Amen. And they were those men not trying to be uh dissenters not trying to push against it but they looked around. Now you have to understand maybe maybe to some of you it'd be like the perfect house in the perfect subdivision. To me, I relate to this scripture because the less houses there are and no subdivisions. Yeah, me too. &gt;&gt; And they looked out and said, "Moses, how about we just stay right here on this side of the river? This is a land for cattle and we are men of cattle and this is paradise." But Moses, I mean, Joshua tells them, tells them, he says, "No, if you don't cross over," and we'll just interpret it and lay this right out. You don't cross over and get the Holy Ghost, you'll die just like your parents died. &gt;&gt; That'll be an unbelief. It's not talking about the effect of old age or sickness or what, but of unbelief. Going to die of unbelief. And those men caught that revelation because they had been conditioned under this ministry to to recognize that God has expectation and God wants us to do so. There when Joshua speaks to them and says, "Unless you cross over, but once you've crossed over, you can come back and you can start that business. You can have that ranch. You can have these things, but get the Holy Ghost first." &gt;&gt; Amen. That younger generation, they didn't fight. They didn't argue. They didn't do anything. They said, "Okay, we've got to go over into the promised land. Our footsteps must possess the promised land. And when they possess the promised land, we can come back and claim this prosperity we see in the gospel." Now, the problem, my brother and sister, with the prosperity gospel of this age is they're not getting crossed over. Amen. They're just settling for the prosperity. Amen. So, when they have the prosperity, the scripture tells us that it brings many woes and thorns in the flesh. That's why whether you're successful or not, you need to make sure you got the Holy Ghost because that money will become a thorn and destroy your life. Amen. But when you got the Holy Ghost, that money looks like an entirely different tool. Amen. A whole different approach to that money once you have the Holy Ghost. But without it, it has a destruction. So it's there as we'll look at this now. It says we're compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so does easily beset us and let us run with patience. In other words, you don't get up in the morning, tie your tennies, and you've won the race. &gt;&gt; You've got to go out. You need a few blisters. You need a little fatigue. You need a little tiredness. You need a little struggle. You need a little sweat and blood and whatever it might be. You have to run it. But run it with patience. &gt;&gt; A mad dash does not finish a marathon, &gt;&gt; right? looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despised the shame. Have you caught that before? He didn't just put the shame as no account. He despised the shame. In other words, he belittled the shame. This is what you have to offer. You're trying to say, "Oh, he's dying on a cross and that's that is a shame." He says, "No, dying on the cross is the ultimate sacrifice I did for you." Amen. I'm willing to bear any shame. I despise that shame because that's what it takes to bring you into a place where you can possess the promise. Oh, my brother and sister, look what he did for us. People today won't even hardly pray in public. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they say, "Well, we're Christians." But they won't. They won't. And I'm not speaking down on that. I used to do. I've shared it with the church here. I used to do that head and uh you know in the midst of all that Lord bless my food uh and go on and eat and then one day I realized you know what I'm ashamed of him &gt;&gt; that's pretty blunt talk isn't it &gt;&gt; but I'm ashamed of him &gt;&gt; and something you might say snapped or changed inside of me and I started saying you know what if I'm ashamed of him he's ashamed of me &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now I want Everybody just take a few breaths here and ponder that &gt;&gt; if we're ashamed of him, he's ashamed of us. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want something so simple as that &gt;&gt; to set me out of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be bold. We live in a world today, my brother and sister, where boldness is is just the norm of everything. And the true church while we say I don't want to offend anybody. &gt;&gt; Who are we offending? &gt;&gt; Don't act don't act so serious. &gt;&gt; But you're going to decide you're going to offend somebody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're either going to Let's cut it right to the chase. You're going to either offend the devil &gt;&gt; or you're going to offend our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't bring it. I don't want to offend my neighbor. I don't want to offend my boss. I don't want to offend this. No. No. It comes down to you're either going to offend the devil or you're going to offend our Lord Jesus Christ. You're either going to bless the devil or you're going to bless our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So, make it simple. Amen. As the old phrase is, keep it simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Consider him that endured such contradiction, such conflict of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. So we have been compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses. We are not here today without witnesses that have experienced and professed a and given voice to the things that God has done. Now, some people would say, you know, I really don't know anybody that uh has has had a supernatural experience. My brother and sister, every man, woman, boy, or girl that ever come and fulfilled Acts 2:38 has fulfilled a supernatural experience. Don't let Satan degrade that down to I went and checked that off. That's a supernatural experience in the age that we're living in to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And receive the Holy Ghost. That is a supernatural event, my brother and sister. Just because the world today, everyone has received the Holy Ghost. Don't let that degrade the experience God has given to you. Amen. He made a promise to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Holy Spirit speaks to us. Can someone say amen? &gt;&gt; What it's doing is discerning the needs of the body. Now we'll find that when you when you look and as your network you might say grows larger you you'll be in contact with people on different continents and uh right here you know in North America different states and provinces and find that God is moving in very similar fashion. Now we are not my brother and sister robots. We are not AI. It's not going to be verbatim that everything is spoken. My brother and sister, the prophet of God said, you know what, I'm saying what Paul said, but he actually used different words, &gt;&gt; so it's not this idea that we have to become repeaters. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Parrots, &gt;&gt; but it's the fact of what the spirit leads, what the foundation of the word is. And the prophet of God stands very clearly and says I am preaching or I preached what Paul preached. So he wasn't a parrot. He didn't have to go and just read it from the scripture. In fact many things that brother Brandham actually brings out of the scripture we don't see with our eye when we read the scripture. But he links that out and he brings that out of what Paul thought what Paul saw how Paul's the revelation of it all. And if you look at that, you'd say, "He's outside the boundaries." And the word says, "Well, my brother and sister, you got to catch the spirit of it." That's right. &gt;&gt; You've got to get in that atmosphere. And when the prophet of God, when the angel come right down in there and he got in that atmosphere of it, it was no longer a man paring a man, but it was a man speaking what the Holy Spirit spoke. The same thing that was spoke to Paul was spoke to brother Brandham. And praise God, I hope you can get excited about this is being spoken today. Not from this pulpit, not from this man, but the Holy Ghost speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the Holy Ghost that's leading you and guiding you. If a man says, "I'll lead you and guide you into all truth." You have a right to be suspicious of that. But when the Holy Spirit comes and you know it's the Holy Spirit, you know it's the uh the word of God coming and he made the promise, I'll lead you and guide you to all truth, my brother and sister, you grab a hold of that. You don't let go. You don't let anybody with enticing words and and fine speech and things convince you any different because God promised you. Amen. He didn't promise Grace Tabernacle. He didn't promise Brandom Tabernacle. He promised you that he would lead you and guide you into all truth. Amen. It's time for us to reach out and take a hold of that promise. And when we have a halt of that promise, that word, and we follow him, we trust him. Amen. He won't fail you. &gt;&gt; He won't fail you. People say, "Well, I prayed that God would do this, this, and this." Well, you know, the thing is is I've I've had the personal experience of people and recounting the very prayer that they prayed. And I know this will sound judgmental, forgive me, but as they're recounting and I ask the Lord this, this, and this, and I'm thinking, that's a selfish prayer. &gt;&gt; Is God here to satisfy our selfishness? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. He's here to bring us into truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we're praying selfish prayers, then is God obligated &gt;&gt; to answer a selfish prayer? &gt;&gt; But when you say, "Lord, please lead me." &gt;&gt; That's right. guide me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want all truth. &gt;&gt; I I want to I want to have your Holy Spirit. I want to be led by the word and I want to be drawn into your presence and this is what my desire is. And then it seems like things just go a whole different way than what you thought they would go. &gt;&gt; H &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit speaks discerning the needs of the body. And I would say this body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's also the individual needs of every person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, it's not just here for God to anoint a preacher to stand up and him to be satisfied that he spoke what God laid on his heart. If it doesn't affect you, if it doesn't reinforce or or bring to you an assurance that this is the word and touch some place of your life, then we're wasting our time. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's like going to a conference, you know, and and you know, hearing a wonderful speech, motivational people stand, give multiple ovations of this speech and walk out and go exactly right back into their life. Well, good was that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's no good, saints. And and I'm not chastising you, but it's no good if we sit in church and say, "That's the truth. Amen. Hallelujah." And walk out the door and go right back into our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want a word that changes us. Can we say amen to that? Lord, give us a word that changes us. Amen. Draws us into your presence. A little shift in direction here. You know, Satan, if you want to be formal today, suit and tie, Lucifer has a sense of discernment. Sure. &gt;&gt; What can I throw in their way? &gt;&gt; Well, this is what's happening in my life. Well, this is what's happening in our life. And it seems to be two entirely different things. Seems to be no connection at all. But I want you to understand the connection. What Satan is doing, Amen, is coming and discerning the need, you might say, or the condition of every person. So all he cares about is what stumbles you. That's it. &gt;&gt; It might be women over here, right? The three things that kill preachers. Might be women over here. Amen. It might be money over here, right? It might be popularity for this one over here. He's not going to go throw money at the person who could care less about money. And he's not going to go throw popularity at the one who doesn't even want to go in public, hates to speak in public. And he's not going to throw women in the face of the guy who's got a money problem. &gt;&gt; Now, I know those are blunt, direct &gt;&gt; approach. But you see, he's looking out here and today, saints, what he throws in your way, he might not throw in my way because it's it's not going to affect me. And what he throws in my way might not affect you or your brother or sister across the aisle. But Satan knowing what it is, it's going to cause you to stumble. That's what he throws in your way. And so as he throws these things out, Amen. imagine the Holy Ghost has a tailored message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God speaking to you. Every one of you that's filled with the Holy Ghost and experience with the Lord would share your story. And yes, there is a common theme, but your life may not be anything in common with those around you. But God knew exactly what to tailor to come to you. Amen. It's a story of the young man ready to go out and kill himself. And God deals with him directly. And a man sitting across the church said, "That was one of the worst sermons I've ever heard." See, one man, his life is spared, and he gives it to the Lord. The other one says, "This guy's boring. This guy, I don't know what he was talking about." &gt;&gt; But you see, Satan has the same thing. He'll come and he knows exactly, right? The prophet of God clearly shows us that Satan's got his punch coming. Amen. Now, he's not going to try and hit you in the chin if you know how to guard your chin. Amen. But if you don't guard your knee, he might just hit you in the knee. Amen. Anyway, he's going to cause you to fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he wants to do is cause the fall. It doesn't have to be a textbook. This is the way we'll do it. Amen. He'll do it any way he can. So the stumbling stone or the stumbling block that he places in front of you might not affect anyone else. Amen. But it's there that he he offers so many things. &gt;&gt; He offers so many things and they're distractions. If Satan's offering it, it's a distraction. &gt;&gt; He's not here to help you on your journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't think sometimes that money is going to make your spiritual life better. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes the ease of life, don't think, oh, I'll have more time to pray, you know. No, no. Satan will throw a distraction in there that steals your time. Amen. So, look at this. Sometimes these things, these distractions maybe for some it will be you're distracted by your failures. We could go into some natural things. There's men I won't go into specifics, but there's men who would be considered quite successful in this day had multiple failures in business. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. before they were ever successful. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Dear old Colonel Sanders is one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you looked at his life, you'd say this guy, as far as an entrepreneur, was a failure until by the time he passed away, he was giving away tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars from his earnings from KFC. &gt;&gt; And that didn't happen until late in his life. So you look at this that what Satan cares about is getting you caught up in your failure. &gt;&gt; This is what I should have done. This is what I did wrong. And oh Lord, forgive me. I did this wrong. And you I I won't go there. But you'll be like some that will be back at your candle day after day asking forgiveness for the same thing again &gt;&gt; and again &gt;&gt; and again and again and again. Do you realize that when you are caught in that cycle that Satan has you distracted? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. The blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is more than sufficient. He said, "My grace is sufficient." Can we say, "Amen, church?" &gt;&gt; Amen. His grace is sufficient. Don't repent for what you've already repented for. You're pulling it out from underneath the blood and asking God to receive it again. &gt;&gt; It was already under the blood. Leave it under the blood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's there sometimes in our failure, Satan distracts us and sometimes it's in our success that he distracts us. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; I'm too busy. Now don't misunderstand me. I understand the things of life, the cares of life to earn a living for your family. And sometimes as it is, I know J brothers that work in factories and and that their shifts change every I don't know what it is. They have two weeks of days, two weeks of nights, uh a few days off. It shifts back to days and then nights and a few days off and and that's what their life is. And and that's how that works. And that's the employment in their area. So they're not making the choice to not be in church. &gt;&gt; It's a circumstance. Amen. &gt;&gt; But some could be in the house of God &gt;&gt; and choose rather to go enjoy their success. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Outside of the house of God. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; If that hurts, I will pray for your wound. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you see, it's time for us to recognize sometimes our success is not God at all. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It's the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mr. Lucifer in his tuxedo and his success and driving his Bentley or Mercedes, you know, to come and look like this is what I want to be. Look at his life of ease. His life of ease. Everything has a cost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is nothing on this earth that does not have a cost. &gt;&gt; What price will we pay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So sometimes Satan, he uses these as distractions, our failure, our success, and we'll have a lot of whatifs. Now I I've looked back sometimes in my life and you know I get a little discouraged and I think you know if I'd have made this decision uh what if &gt;&gt; am I alone? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; If I had just what if &gt;&gt; but it's time for us to actually take that that distraction that Satan's using. Oh, let me just throw one at you here. You're sitting with someone says different country. I I need to talk to you. Okay. I've really been bothered lately, brother, about this thought that what if I hadn't married my wife and I'd married this sister? after I picked myself up off the floor. &gt;&gt; Uh, you're thinking three children 15 years later, your life would be better if you were married to this sister. Yeah, it's really bothering me. &gt;&gt; I feel like I missed something. Well, brother, let's just go back to the scripture. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's see what the scripture says. and I'm just going to paraphrase it. Don't despise the wife of your youth. And that's what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; You're placing no value on her and this other one. But what he doesn't know is the brother that's married to this sister has come and said, "Ah, brother Paul, how do I deal with my wife's rebellious spirit." &gt;&gt; So what he's wanting is to be married to this glamorous, very pretty sister. And if he had been married to her, he would be over here saying, "Minister, what do I do about her rebellious spirit?" See, Satan's a liar, a distraction. He's putting this out here, trying to pull you from where you're supposed to be to where you think you would be blessed at. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the word says, "Amen." Oh, get ahead of yourself, Paul. Just a second, folks. I'll get there. Amen. Hallelujah. Look at the song that we that we sang here. I thought it was so beautiful. Amen. We have a lot of whatifs. And it's the nature of man to yearn for something more. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that something more is a figment of imagination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is a figment. We have created an image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. I I don't think this would be time or place to share what I consider is a funny story, but um you look at that. It's a nature of man to yearn. In the natural, men yearn, women too. They yearn and do not find. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It leads people. If money was the answer to our problems, all the millionaires would be fabulously happy. But they kill themselves. &gt;&gt; They drink themselves to death. Amen. They're miserable creatures. &gt;&gt; So money is not the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know by nature that our strength, it don't matter how many weights you lift, if you lift weights, I'm not preaching at you. It don't matter how many weights you lift, how defined your muscles are. When you get to a certain age, &gt;&gt; you fade away. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; And as one brother put it one time, there was some young men in his church, got a real deal, joining the gym, pumping irons, starting to look really bulked up and and he preached really hard at that. Amen. He said, "I just want you to know when you guys get," and he named an age like 65 or something. He said, "All of that muscle is going to be down here and this skinny guy doesn't have anything to drop down there. So, you're actually worse off than he is. Amen. I thought, "Wow, is that blunt or not?" Amen. You guys are going to be the one that's going to be going to the skin doctor in secret with your hoodie on, going in there. Can you cut this all off? Can you get rid of all of No, my brother and sister. You see, it's all a distraction. It's all vanity. And what Satan's doing, he's trying to cause us not to be happy with who we are in Jesus Christ. Amen. God made you the way he made you. Amen. We should stand up and say, "Thank you, Lord." If I'm short, Amen. As one brother put it, I'm sorry to put it this way, offending nobody, but you know, he called them boxed squared. Amen. That's the one that's 4 foot tall and 4 foot wide. If God made you box squared, be happy you're box square. If he made you seven feet tall, be happy you're seven feet tall. If he made you average, be happy you're average. If he made you super smart, be happy you're super smart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be distracted of trying to be something else over here. &gt;&gt; Amen. If people on this earth caught that revelation, every makeup company on earth would be bankrupt overnight. But that distraction is I want to be pretty. I want to do this. I've got to do that. I need this. I need that so I can be pretty. But what's underneath? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's still you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you have to face you. Because no matter what, I know it sounds like I'm preaching to you sisters, but I'm not. I'm speaking a spiritual context. When the makeup comes off, &gt;&gt; it's still you. &gt;&gt; When the public image comes off, &gt;&gt; it's still you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? Amen. I want the word that when everything comes off, they see the word. They see Christ in me. &gt;&gt; Not a charade, not a fake, not an image that was crafted or created to present something, &gt;&gt; a distraction. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the natural, humanity yearns for and does not find Don't take this in a natural sense here, but do you realize research shows that as young people getting older, only 5 to 8% actually achieve what they dreamed of when they were young. Did they research and pull the bride of Christ when they did this research? I'll make a bold statement. 100% of the bride of Christ will be what God called them &gt;&gt; to be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Prophet shows us from the word that he will never leave us, never forsake us, that he will never walk away from us. My brother and sister, I can make that bold statement. 100% of the bride of Christ will be what they yearn for in their heart and soul. Does that mean that we'll never find ourselves wisfully thinking about this or wisfully thinking about that? No. That's your natural side coming out. But when we yield to the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit comes and says, "Look, I promise to lead you and guide you. We're going to make a hard right turn right here, even though it goes against everything you think. I'm going to cause a company to quit a division and lay you off to get you from being distracted about the big house, the car, the money, the clothes. Amen. I'm going to put you down into reality again. And we think, "Oh, Lord, what's happened? You forsook me." No, he's leading you. Amen. He's pulling you into his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan was trying to distract us into these things. Praise God. The Lord loves me. I've got all this money, all these fine clothes, all of this. Praise God. No, we're taking a trip. We're I hope none of you are going here. No, I hope none of you are going to the south of Spain right now. Are you? We're We're going to go. We've rented a villa for three months in the south of Spain. Is there a church there? Fellowship there? No, but if we have time, we'll stream. That's it. &gt;&gt; That little screen right there &gt;&gt; has become your house of God. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Anybody need a band-aid? &gt;&gt; Look at this. What Satan's doing? He's got a substitute. &gt;&gt; Don't forget forsake the assembling of yourselves. &gt;&gt; Well, we are. I mean, it's just through technology. I'll tell you, can I can I just waste a minute of your time? Sister Jerry and I in our vacationing, we have been places and sat in a service and so tremendously blessed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, just above and beyond blessed by that service. Actually, Sister Jerry and I was going through kind of a hard time in life. A few hard decisions we had to make and whatever it was. and we're sitting there and it was though the minister had the diary of our thoughts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he preached it right down the line. &gt;&gt; Couldn't deny it. Not one fraction. &gt;&gt; We got home from our trip. Has that happened to anybody? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got home from our trip and we're like, "That was such a good service. Let's watch it again." And we're sitting there watching the service. No popcorn, no bunny slippers, no recliners. We are paying attention. and we just looked at each other and it's like, it's not the same. &gt;&gt; It's not the same. We're We were there. We know how the Holy Spirit just moved down through that church, how the Holy Spirit spoke to us and we're watching it on a screen and it's just not there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, that's not to say God won't deal with you. &gt;&gt; But to understand a firsthand experience, &gt;&gt; that's it. And I wouldn't call it secondhand experience, but the substitute. Are we all right? I didn't offend anybody. It's not my intention today. Maybe next Sunday, but not this Sunday. 5 to 8% achieve their dreams. Some go to alcohol and drugs, infidelities, and all kinds of things trying to find what it is. You know, I've used that simple analogy to you, church, before. They've proven that the first three bites of ice cream is as much flavor and stimulation as your body will get from eating that whole gallon. I didn't like that research. I still found joy in eating the whole bowl. But the stimulation from it, see, Satan wants to stimulate you. I don't know. Have any of you had too much interaction with drug addicts in life? I've had a reasonable amount of interaction with drug addicts. And you know what they search for? Meth is. Meth is a just incredible destructive thing. You know what they're searching for? Desire for more meth. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Desire to relive the first stimulant &gt;&gt; of meth &gt;&gt; that they ever had. That's what they're pursuing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they can achieve it in a mild form by taking more, more, more, more, more. &gt;&gt; Do you see a parallel? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right. &gt;&gt; There's a positive parallel hid in there. &gt;&gt; Y want an upper room experience, get more of Jesus. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the only way you're ever going to come back to an upper room experience again. &gt;&gt; Not a substitute. You see how Satan's so clever? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He latches on to the things that God has. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The song we sing, more of you. &gt;&gt; I had it all. &gt;&gt; But what I need, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; Is more of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. See how God is working, my brother and sister. Satan's got his distractions that he puts out here. And speaking of that, I'm distracted right now. &gt;&gt; See, it's there. I even took and opened my iPad as as brother Isaac was singing that and typed right in the line there with a big arrow, more of you. See, this is similar in the spiritual. Many people, maybe some even sitting here this morning would say, "I have not achieved the spiritual goals that I thought I would achieve in my life. The spiritual position, I have not achieve that. I I don't feel like I'm any close." You know, you might say, you know, we should I hear preachers say, "We should be ready for the rapture right now." But I want to ask the preacher, are you ready for the rapture? &gt;&gt; It's easy for me to say you should be ready for the rapture. But if we had a little truth serum, which the Holy Spirit is, it'll come down. Not one of us feel like we're ready for a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But there's a yearning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? &gt;&gt; There is something inside of us that says, "Lord, I want to be ready for the rapture. I'm not quitting. I'm not going to stop. I'm not going to fall short of the goal. I want to be ready for the rapture." And yet then we face things in our life and we say, "Oh Lord, I've come short of the glory of God. What do I do, Lord?" And we think that we're not spiritual. &gt;&gt; I want you to see what Satan's doing here. When you come to the place that you feel like you've fallen short and you cannot reach the expectation of your life, amen, that disappointment diminishes your vision &gt;&gt; of your calling. Do you realize at a time when brother Brandon was preaching back east, there was interaction between men and men who had been at one time wealthy men and because of disappointments in their life, they gave up and went abandoned families, children's nice homes, financials and ended up living on the street. And they asked him why. And their answer was because I'm a failure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You realize what Satan's trying to do to you today, saints? He's trying to convince you you're a failure. &gt;&gt; You fell short of the glory of God. Oh, you fell short again. Oh, you fell short again. You're a failure. What he's trying to do is cause you to give up and lower your expectation. I I do go to church and I read my Bible last month. Lowered expectations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The disappointment diminishes the vision &gt;&gt; until the vision fades and it's man. You know what happens? I'm not preaching too hard this morning, am I? &gt;&gt; You know what happens? Humanity settles for what they think they can do. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now, I believe the Lord would have his hand in this, but there's many, many, many, many recorded times. Young man's working on a car in the driveway. It falls off the jack and his friend is pinned under the car. That young man who is no way he could lift a 2,000lb car goes over there and grabs a bumper and lifts that car. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Could he repeat that? &gt;&gt; At the time that he's doing that, he's not thinking about the car is a whatever model &gt;&gt; weighs 2364 lbs with no gas. It's got a full tank. I can't lift that. &gt;&gt; No, sir. It was life and death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And something inside of him. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Come on, my brother and sister. This is life and death. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to say, you know what, Lord? You called me to this. You ordained me to this. I am a son of God. I am a daughter of God. I can overcome Leodysia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. without stopping to think of all the sin and unbelief and all the circumstances of the world. And as the prophet of God says, the nuclear bombs, people were terrified. The nuclear bombs were hanging. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And people were like, "Oh, we lost hope." My brother and sister, the bride of Jesus Christ, Amen. I'm sorry this a little personal to some here. This conflict that's over there between Russia and these different countries, Ukraine, etc. My brother and sister, it never happened without God allowing it to happen. Amen. We don't need to be terrified. Oh, what's happening? What's Oh, this is horrible. Lives are lost. My brother and sister, my God is in control. Until we can trust God that he truly is 100% in control. I've got a child not serving God. Oh, woe unto me. God's in control. My company's shutting down. What am I going to God's in control? I've been diagnosed with this disease. My God is in control. Amen. And when you don't trust God that much, you might as well not trust him at all. &gt;&gt; Cuz one little bit of unbelief and doubt, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; negates everything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they settle for what they can do. I can only have this much happiness serving God. I'm just so concerned what I'll have to give up. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it. &gt;&gt; To serve him. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you who placed value on what you were giving up. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know a young man in South America &gt;&gt; went off to university, backslid. Young lady there in the university set his cap for him. We're not talking about some ugly young lady. A beautiful young lady &gt;&gt; decided this is the man for me. Compromised here, compromised there. Didn't want to lose her. I mean, after all, what young man wouldn't want a beautiful girlfriend? But God got a hold of his heart. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; God dealt with him. And this is his own testimony to me. What I placed so much value on one trip to the altar, brother Paul. &gt;&gt; And I got up from there and I saw no value. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look at the change that God did in that man's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he's doing in every one of our life. We place so much value on this and we get one experience of coming in the presence of almighty God and our value system changes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And suddenly he he's like, "What?" I'll tell you, it's a beautiful story. Amen. Young woman in the church, young sister in the church, very beautiful. Now, I'm not saying that the beauty part is it. But interesting how God did this. Here's this young girl, just a lovely Christian girl, sincere, faithful. Amen. Do everything she could to help serve God. and in the context of helping in the church also. And uh he goes on, the Lord got a hold of his life, he gets an education, gets a good job. And one day they're at a fellowship thing for the youth and this girl's there and he looks over and he says, "How come I never noticed her before?" Bing. I'm in love. Now I want to ask you saints. I know this a little direct. What kind of love would he have got here? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Compared to the kind of love God had in store for him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only did he get a beautiful girl, smart girl, determined girl, a good wife, a good mother, she loves God with all of her heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which one was the real prize? &gt;&gt; I can only have this much happiness. I can only have this much joy in my salvation because I have this issue and this issue and this issue, this issue. I thought we had put those under the blood. What sin? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you talking about? I I forget the words. How's that go, Sister Jerry? I don't remember. What sin are you talking about? I don't remember them anymore. So, we're sitting over here, if you don't mind me. We're sitting over here and I told this lie. I got drunk. I did this. I did that. I stole. Why would God love me? What? Sin. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you talking about &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; don't remember anymore. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; But you see what Satan's done? &gt;&gt; He threw this big &gt;&gt; You know what these parking bumpers are for? For those of you who don't know where the front wheels of your car are at, that's what they're actually for. But you see, you're going to damage your car if you drive over the parking bumper, right? You did this. &gt;&gt; You can't go any further. &gt;&gt; You live right. You read your Bible. You pray. You go to church. You do all these things. You can't go. You come up. It's cuz I'm not worthy. That's why God's not happy with me. I'm not worthy. Well, what you got to do is recognize God didn't put that in front of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That came from Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you recognize that, I know my brother and sister, it's just supernatural, but that parking bumper disappears out of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's there no longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can only have this much happiness. The joy of my salvation is lacking. You know why it's lacking? Because you haven't received the giver of joy completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say you believe him. You declare you believe him. You sometimes actually act on the fact that you believe him. And then you allow Satan to come in and distract you. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's you he's using to distract you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's you he uses as a tool to keep you &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; from getting closer to him. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I need to I need to I need to go uh we'll just take this in in in ministry form here. Joshua 1:es 2:7. Now, what happens here? God doesn't come to Joshua and say, "Now Joshua, Moses, my servant, is dead." And uh now I need you to hunker down and build a defensive ring about the revelation that I brought. Now there's a promised land, but that promise is figurative. That promise was a kind of an intellectual promise. That's an emotional promise. That's this and that's that. No. What does God do? He comes to Joshua and he tells Joshua, "You know what? It's time for you to rise up." &gt;&gt; Amen. My servant Moses is dead. But my servant, you put your name in here. But my servant, Come on, put your name in there. My servant, Amen. It's time for my servant to rise up and possess the land. &gt;&gt; It's not for us to say, "But brother Brandham passed away. A prophet to the age is gone." No. That's because my brother and sister, God said, "It's time for you to rise up." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He don't need, now pardon me. Some people be offended at me saying this. We don't need a prophet to rise up again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word has come. And the word has come for you and I to come in our season in the revelation of the word in this time, in our need. And for you and I not to sit here and say, "But we were promised a word that would restore the church and bring these things back in order." My brother and sister, it's there. It's happened. Rise up and possess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you just sit there and say, "But he promised. But he promised. Somebody promised that won't do you a single thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells a little story about the the lady that was in dire need, the grandmother in dire need. And and they they come and they're like, "Oh, but what about your son?" "Oh, I have such a lovely son. He's over there doing this work and doing these things. Does he contact you?" Yes, he sends me letters and all of this stuff, but I have no money and and blah blah blah. And you know what was there, my brother and sister, is when they opened those letters and said, "Can we read those letters?" and they opened it and there was money order after money order after money order after money order. She was actually, you might say, wealthy. Amen. But she didn't have the revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To catch the promise. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's it right there. That's it. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, &gt;&gt; this love letter, &gt;&gt; that's it, &gt;&gt; that's been written to you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Have you looked all the way through it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe it's just tucked away on the next page. In the next fold of it, give you a little silly example. I have my little favorite song cheat sheet. Yes, I'm sorry. I cheat. Sometimes I have inspiration. You know, it's like, what's that song? What's that song? What's that song? Huh? I can't remember that song. What do I do while you guys are all preoccupied? I open my Bible. Oh, there it is. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Open the love letter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Inside of it's everything you need. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't sit here and say, "We're starving. Seems like the message has come short in my life." No, I'll tell you what came short. Forgive me if it's too blunt. You came short. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You never opened the love letter. You never searched through it. It might have just been on the next page. Turned out to be a money order. All these little things with all the pretty pictures. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Brandham told these sis lovely little stories. They're they're just so cute. Really? &gt;&gt; My brother and sister was a spiritual money order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he gave us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me move on here. Amen. See this promise uh here in Joshua 2 or I mean one verse two going on down. Amen. It lays it out and he tells them, "You know what? You need to be strong and courageous. You can observe to do according to all the law." Amen. That you were commanded by the prophet of your day to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Turn not from it to the right or the left &gt;&gt; that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me just cut this short so I don't drag this out. You've got to allow yourself to be complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In him, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you continue to remind yourself of your own self, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; you'll never move any farther &gt;&gt; than yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I didn't say it that way to be cute. I'm telling you, it's not even the devil that's hindering you. &gt;&gt; It's his influence on you that hinders you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. So when you cut off the influence, you'll realize God made a promise to you. He'll keep that promise. Amen. Allow yourself, no matter where you're at. I love this little story was shared to me. My it's probably been 20 years plus ago. I met a brother back east. Won't be too specific. Um met a brother back east. We're talking. I really like I enjoyed talking to him and uh we just chatting away about the word and he's just enthusiastic and you know I was just like wow this is an awesome brother. Then another brother who's my friend also, he goes, "Do you know that brother?" And I said, "No, just met him." It's wonderful conversation. He said, "Um, you know, he was raised in the message." I was like, "Oh, cuz he said, you know, I've only been serving the Lord for I forget it was like seven years or nine years or something. He was raised in the message." Oh, okay. Yeah. I got to hanging out with the wrong people. backslid when he was about 19, went out, just went crazy. Now, this brother wasn't being negative. He had he had a little something to share. Just went crazy. And one day, he's sitting in a barroom &gt;&gt; with his elbows on the counter holding a beer. And a friend was talking to another friend and said, "Can you believe them Brandommites over there in that church? Bunch of hypocrites. Got their wives all trusted up like they're do and they they won't do this and they want that. They they don't drink, they don't do that, they don't music, they don't do nothing. They're just a bunch of hypocrites. How dare you talk about them like that?" That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't even know them. I know them. They're real Christians. &gt;&gt; Then he's like, "What did I just say?" &gt;&gt; And he storms out of that barroom and he goes home. Did I really say that? Yeah, I did. Cuz it's true. And he come back and he gave his heart to the Lord. Oh, it'd be okay, my brother and sister, if they came out of the world through the barroom to the church. But when they left the church and went to the barroom, people are like, "Well, we don't know if it's going to last." After all, what took him there in the beginning might take him back. Get thee behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get thee behind me. &gt;&gt; This is a son of God. This is a daughter of God. Amen. And this is the word of God calling those back because they must be complete &gt;&gt; in him. &gt;&gt; Serve God for 40 years or serve God for five days. My brother and sister, God doesn't care. He knows the work he's done in them. An 11th hour worker is going to get the same exact reward. Forget about your seniority and how long you've done and who you know. Amen. Get to know him. become complete in him. There's the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. He Now look, Philippians 1:6. Amen. Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. Look, I'm going to just take this here in the scripture. That's a small H, but my brother and sister, we're going to emphasize it. That should be a large H. Amen. Amen. Be confident in the very thing that he &gt;&gt; which began the work. Did it say you? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say you that began the work. &gt;&gt; It says he began the work. Amen. In Oh, here it is. The work is on you. &gt;&gt; Next to you &gt;&gt; in your church. &gt;&gt; No, it's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And will continue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We could stop right there. It's going to continue. until the rapture. &gt;&gt; It's going to continue till God has perfected and molded you into this perfect image of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm telling you, Satan, we're putting you on notice today. Amen. We're not here to hear about what you've got to say. We'll never be complete in you, Satan. We'll be complete and already are in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's where we were called to be complete. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't something did. It was something that took place in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, the tent vision. I'm sorry. I'm getting all excited here. The tent vision, those people come in there and they went into that tent and when they come out the other side, people were there. What happened in there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll notice they didn't say nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. What they did is they come out and said, "I don't know." &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, you've received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; How did that happen? &gt;&gt; Did you set this little block here and put this here? &gt;&gt; As one man, this happened in South Africa. Sorry, I don't want to sound disrespectful. They're a little more formal than we are. Well, some of you are kind of formal. Some of us are very much redneck. Fork in this hand, knife in this hand. We're ready. Let's eat. I was joking with a brother and he goes, "Well, brother Paul, you guys just don't understand some of the little finer things." And I couldn't help but retort and say, "Brother, I want to know. The silverware lined up perfectly. Did it make the meal taste any better?" He just looked at me and said, "You got a point there. We're going to do it anyhow, though. Now, I want you to understand God set it in order. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Oh, I got revelation, but I went I got it another way." &gt;&gt; No. No. God's got order. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He puts things in order. &gt;&gt; Yes, he sure does. &gt;&gt; Now, that analogy might be a poor one. I went ahead and It's funny. Brings up a memory. So, this is how I I I I like to saw. The sharper the knife, the less I look embarrassing, but I like to saw with my right hand. More strength, precision. And I like to spear it with a fork with my left hand. And then when I go to eat it, I'm not very good with my left hand, so I trade silverware. And the brother's like, "Where did you learn that? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Brother, you mean they actually teach that?" &gt;&gt; Yes. Just watch us eat, Brother Paul, and you'll understand. And I watched them eat, and I thought, "Huh?" Still don't get it. My brother and sister, God wants you to come. Formality won't make this word taste any better. But understanding that God called you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That he presented himself. Not we we can go we can get into remma and all these different words and put it. Let's just cut it down to simplicity. Paul's level. Amen. When God come to you, he didn't come to you say, "I'm going to come to you in a formality. I'm going to come to you personally." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to present myself personally. &gt;&gt; I think formal is good. I remember I dressed up formal one time. You notice I said one because I noticed that in this formal environment I didn't belong there. You can come formal and you can say we've got it. We're sophisticated believers. But I want to know are you complete in him? &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what matters. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Ruth, would you come? &gt;&gt; Amen. I got more to preach here, but we just need to go on. Now, remember, let me just share this one little story here. Remember, Brother Brown tells a story about the man that uh picked up a little flyer, a little pamphlet, and it was asking him about his eternal destination, the Holy Ghost. and something inside of the man just kind of a pang and he's like I want the Holy Ghost and he went over to this church and they shouted said you got it but he didn't feel anything he went over here went over here went over here went over here very dissatisfied didn't feel complete and a friend of his told him well the evangelist William Brandham's going to be over here. Maybe go over there. Now, you know the story, right? H a lot of blank kind of faces, but I'm going to interpret that that's a yes. Comes to brother Brandham says, "I want the Holy Ghost. I'm seeking the Holy Ghost. I've been here. I've been baptized face forward, backwards, this, that. I've shouted. I've spoke in tongues. I've done all of these things and something's missing. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham didn't set him down and start in the front of the Bible and start working his way through it. Now, take this and take that and do this and do that. Put it Brother asked him one question. &gt;&gt; When you read that pamphlet, that flyer, &gt;&gt; what happened? &gt;&gt; That's it. He said, "There was something down in my heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, "I must have this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Brother Brandon gave him 12 pages double spaced. &gt;&gt; Go do this. Go do that. Oh, am I reading the wrong quote? &gt;&gt; Yeah, you are. &gt;&gt; He says, "That's when the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; came to you." That's right, &gt;&gt; my brother and sister. Don't let the devil &gt;&gt; keep having you chase your tail. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Keep you running through the brush trying to find it. &gt;&gt; Just settle down. Know that God called you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's opened his word to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The very life of Christ is being manifested in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just settle down. Good days. I love Brother Isaac how he brought that out. Yeah. of those bad days. Well, I start out there are the bad days. Thank you for that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you for sharing that &gt;&gt; because you see, I don't know about you guys. I could pull my sleeve up and show you where I just ripped the pardon my Idaho English. I just ripped the tar out of my left arm. I come home that day literally had blood streaks running down my arm where it ran down my arm and dripped off of my fingers. Good day or bad day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My flesh said bad day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God had told me that day that I was elect, I was chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said amen to that. And I could say in spite of this, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a good day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't look at your flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. Don't look at your circumstance. Look at this promise. If you want to settle down here, I don't know how many of you want to keep cattle. But if you want to settle down here and raise cattle, get across that river, claim your promise, and then you can come back and own any kind of company and any size of house and any kind of car you want. But make sure you got across the river and come back to claim it. Don't settle for having it here and say, "God blessed me. This is from the Lord." But you don't have the promise. Amen. I need to stop. Amen. Because if we enter part two, we're in trouble. Hallelujah. Amen. I got some beautiful quotes here. I'll just have to share them another day. Amen. I'll just let you guys wonder about them. Amen. For a day or two. Let's just stand. Sing that little song. It is so sweet to trust in Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah. Tears so sweet to trust in Jesus. Just to take him at his word, just to rest upon his promise. us to know. Thus saith the Lord Jesus. Jesus, how I trust him, how I prove him all and all. Jesus, Jesus, preious Jesus. Oh, for grace to trust. Lord, give us more grace to trust you. Oh, how sweet to trust in Jesus. Just in sense is cleansing blood. Just in simple faith to plunge meet the healing cleansing flow. Jesus. Jesus. How I trust him. How I've proved him more and more. Jesus. Jesus. Precious Jesus. Oh, for grace to trust him more. Yes, is sweet to trust in Jesus. Just from sin and self to see just from Jesus. simply taking life and rest and joy and peace. Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him. How I prove him and know. Jesus. Jesus, preious Jesus. Oh, for grace to trust him more. I'm so glad I learned to trust thee, preious Jesus, Savior, friend. And I know that thou art with me with Jesus. Jesus, how I trust him, how I prove him more and more Jesus. Jesus, preious Jesus, oh for grace to trust him more. [Music] Amen. Amen. Brother Paul hit it on a couple times there, but on that uh that verse, sorry, it's a second verse there. Just to trust his cleansing blood. You know, in my own life, how many times this devil's come in there and said, you know, you you need to go make this right. And I'm thinking, I already made that right. Whatever it is, you know, I've I've repented for that. He's trying to make you not trust that cleansing blood. His word says when that blood was shed, when you accept that blood, when you've committed that unto him, it's done. Praise God. It's done. Hallelujah. Thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And when you tell the devil that he's got to get behind you, Let's just sing that song. It just popped in my head. In the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Demons will have to flee. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. We have the victory. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, demons will have to flee. [Music] When we stand in the name of Jesus, tell me who can stand before. In the precious name of Jesus, we have the victory in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, I have the victory in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, demons will have to flee. When we stand in the name of Jesus, tell me who can stand before. In the precious name of Jesus, I have the victory. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, I have the victory in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, demons will have to flee. When I stand in the name of Jesus, tell me who can stand before. In the precious name of Jesus, I have the victory. Amen. Are we victorious this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's uh what's that? Satan's like a roaring lion. Greater is he that is in me. Amen. Amen. Because when we've given it to him, it's not us anymore anyways. Amen. Greater is he that dwells in here. Amen. Sa Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour. The Bible tells me so. These souls have been his prey to fall in some weak hour. But God has given us today his overcoming power. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. On the day of Pentecost, rushing mighty wind blew into the upper room, baptized all of them with a power greater than any earthly foe. And I'm so glad I got it, too. who I'm going to let the whole world know. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Praise the Lord. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. One more as we get ready to dismiss here. Um listen to our hearts. [Music] Amen. Amen. I love the Lord. How do you explain? [Music] How do you describe a love that goes from east to west? runs as deep as it is wide. You know all our hopes. Lord, you know all our fears. When words could not express the love we feel, but we long for you to hear. Listen to our heart. [Music] Hear our spirit sing. [Music] Song of praise that flows [Music] from those you have redeemed. [Music] And we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are. When words are not enough to tell you of our love, just listen to our heart. If words could fall like rain from these lips of mine. If I had a thousand years, I would still run out of time. So if you listen to my heart, every beat will say, "Thank you for the life. Thank you for the truth. Thank you for the way. into our hearts. Hear our spirit sing. The song of praise that flow from those you have redeemed. And we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are. When words are not enough to tell you of our love, just listen to our heart. Amen. God bless you. God be with you. Until we meet again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
