[3:37] God bless you.
[3:41] Good evening.
[3:43] Um greet you all here. Good to have each
[3:46] one. Um
[3:49] not many of us, but I'll believe we'll
[3:51] have a good service. So let's um open
[3:54] with the song number 801.
[3:59] You are my strength when I am weak.
[4:05] You are the treasure that I seek.
[4:11] You are my all
[4:14] in
[4:16] all.
[4:23] seeking you as a preious jewel.
[4:29] I want the Holy Ghost to rule.
[4:35] You are my all
[4:38] in
[4:39] all.
[4:45] Jesus,
[4:51] lamb
[4:53] of God.
[4:57] Worthy
[5:00] is
[5:02] your name.
[5:09] Jesus.
[5:15] Lamb
[5:16] of God,

[5:40] Rising again. I bless your name.

[5:50] all.
[5:58] When I fall down, you pick me up. When I
[6:05] am dry, you fill my cup.
[6:10] You are my all in
[6:14] all.
[6:20] Jesus,
[6:26] lamb

[7:11] Teach me Lord
[7:13] to wait
[7:17] down on my knees,
[7:21] telling your
[7:24] good time.
[7:26] You answer
[7:29] my plea.
[7:31] Teach me not
[7:34] to rely
[7:36] on
[7:38] others do,
[7:41] but to wait
[7:44] in prayer
[7:46] for an answer
[7:49] from you.
[7:51] They that wait upon the Lord
[7:56] shall renew
[7:58] their strength.
[8:01] They shall mount up with wings
[8:06] as he goes.
[8:11] They shall run and not be weary.
[8:16] They shall walk and not faint.
[8:20] Teach me, Lord.
[8:23] Teach me, Lord,
[8:25] to wait.
[8:29] Oh, teach me Lord
[8:32] to wait
[8:35] while hearts are a flame.

[8:42] my pride
[8:44] and call on your name.

[8:52] renewed.
[8:54] Keep my eyes
[8:57] on thee.

[10:40] See,
[10:42] see
[10:49] gone from my heart,
[10:54] the world and all its charms.
[11:00] Now through the blood
[11:05] I'm safe from all alarms.
[11:10] Down at the cross
[11:15] my heart is bending low.
[11:20] The preious blood of Jesus cleans me
[11:25] white as snow.
[11:31] I love him.
[11:36] I love him.
[11:40] Because
[11:42] he first loved me
[11:49] and purchase
[11:53] my salvation
[11:59] on Calary
[12:05] tree.
[12:09] Oh, once I was lost
[12:14] and weigh down deep in sin.
[12:19] Once was a slave
[12:24] to passions fierce within.
[12:29] Once was afraid
[12:33] to trust a loving God.
[12:38] But now I'm cleansed from every stain
[12:43] through Jesus
[12:46] blood.
[12:48] I
[12:50] love him.
[12:54] I love him
[12:59] because
[13:00] he first loved me
[13:08] and purchase
[13:12] my salvation
[13:18] on Calvary.
[13:24] tree.
[13:29] Once I was bound,
[13:33] but now I am set free.
[13:39] Once I was blind,
[13:43] but now the light I see.
[13:49] Once I was dead,
[13:53] but now in Christ I live
[13:58] to tell the world around the peace that
[14:03] he doth give.
[14:08] I love him.
[14:14] I love him
[14:18] because
[14:20] he first loved me
[14:28] and purchase
[14:31] my salvation
[14:37] on Calary.
[14:41] Trees
[14:43] tree. Let's sing again. I love you.
[14:47] Oh, I love you.
[14:53] I love you
[14:58] because
[14:59] you first loved me
[15:07] and purchase
[15:10] my salvation
[15:16] on Calary
[15:22] free.
[15:26] Amen. Number 321. As we prepare to go to
[15:30] prayer,
[15:34] he's already
[15:40] proided.
[15:42] He's already
[15:48] proided.
[15:53] Everything
[15:56] you need,
[15:58] he's already
[16:00] provided.
[16:08] Every proise you
[16:12] can claim,
[16:17] just ask it in his name.
[16:24] Everything
[16:26] you need,

[16:52] proided.
[16:58] Everything

[17:41] Amen. We're going to go to prayer
[17:44] and um let's remember sister Aaliyah not
[17:46] feeling well today.
[17:49] Um
[17:50] also sister Daria having some health
[17:52] issues and um tests being done for that.
[17:55] So, let's just remember them in prayer.
[17:57] The Dean Hart family traveling to the
[17:59] funeral and brother Isaac also traveling
[18:02] back home today from um a work trip and
[18:06] he also has a praise report that there
[18:08] were some medical tests that came back
[18:09] good. Um so, amen. That's always good to
[18:13] hear. God bless you. Um let's just go to
[18:16] prayer. Take these knees to the Lord.
[18:19] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we first
[18:22] of all just thank you for allowing us to
[18:24] gather here together, Lord. The few of
[18:25] us, but still feeling your presence,
[18:28] Lord, knowing that you are with us, just
[18:30] burning within our hearts, Lord. And we
[18:32] um just pray that your presence be known
[18:34] amongst us, Lord. That you bless us,
[18:37] Lord, this evening. And um and for these
[18:40] needs, Lord, we just all we can do is
[18:42] just bring them to you, Lord God. And we
[18:44] know that prayers change things and
[18:47] circumstances, Lord. And um I thank you
[18:50] Lord for these tests that came back good
[18:51] for brother Isaac.
[18:54] And u I I believe that the same will
[18:56] happen to sister Daria and u that
[18:58] everything will be well and um and that
[19:01] your healing virtue will touch her Lord
[19:03] God and and there will be nothing found
[19:05] wrong or or bad and we will give you all
[19:08] the praise Lord for that. We pray for
[19:10] those who are traveling, the Dean Hart
[19:12] family
[19:14] as well as brother Isaac coming home
[19:15] tonight, Lord. And uh we just commit
[19:17] everything to your hands, Lord Jesus.
[19:19] Ask that you have your way with us this
[19:21] evening. Bless bless my brother Paul as
[19:23] he will speak to us, Lord. Um and soften
[19:26] our hearts to receive. We commit
[19:28] everything to your hands, Lord. We love
[19:29] you and we thank you in the name of
[19:30] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[19:36] Amen.
[19:37] as we uh invite brother Paul let's sing
[19:41] listen to our hearts
[19:43] uh that's number 969
[19:49] how do you explain
[19:56] how do you describe
[20:02] the love that goes from east to quest
[20:08] and runs as deep as it is wide.
[20:16] Oh, you know all our hoes.
[20:23] Lord, you know all our fears.
[20:29] when words could not express the love we
[20:35] feel. But we long for you to hear.
[20:43] Listen to our hearts.
[20:50] Hear our spirit sing.
[20:56] A song of praise that flows
[21:03] from those you have redeemed.
[21:10] And we will use the words we know
[21:15] to tell you what
[21:18] an awesome God
[21:22] you are. When words are not enough
[21:26] to tell you of our love, just listen to
[21:32] our hearts. Let's stand together as we
[21:35] sing this.
[21:37] If words could fall like rain
[21:44] from these lips of mine.
[21:50] And if I had a thousand years,
[21:57] I would still run out of time.
[22:03] So if you listen to my heart,
[22:11] every beat will say,
[22:16] "Oh, thank you for the life.
[22:20] Thank you for the truth.
[22:24] Thank you for the way.
[22:30] Just listen to our hearts.
[22:37] Hear our spirit sing.
[22:43] The song of praise that flows
[22:49] from those you have redeemed.
[22:56] And we will use the words we know
[23:01] to tell you what
[23:04] an awesome God
[23:08] you are when words are not enough to
[23:13] tell you of our love. Just listen to our
[23:18] heart.
[23:21] Listen
[23:24] to our hearts.
[23:30] Here our spirits sing.
[23:36] A song of praise that flow
[23:43] from those you have redeemed.
[23:50] We will use the words we know to tell
[23:56] you what
[23:58] an awesome God
[24:01] you are.
[24:03] Words are not enough to tell you of our
[24:08] love.
[24:10] Listen to our heart.
[24:16] Amen. And isn't it wonderful when we
[24:18] don't know how to put it to words, the
[24:20] Lord just lays it in our heart and our
[24:24] heart as he looks upon our heart, our
[24:26] heart is speaking to him. Amen. Well,
[24:29] not much of a crowd here to welcome
[24:32] Brother Luke, Sister Jennif Jennifer,
[24:34] and the family, but uh God bless you,
[24:37] Brother Luke, Sister Jennifer, and kids.
[24:39] Uh we're just glad to welcome you. Amen.
[24:43] Glad to be a part of it. Amen.
[24:46] So
[24:48] let's just go right into our thought
[24:50] tonight. Um I just want to uh just a
[24:53] very simple thought. Thank you
[24:55] musicians. That's beautiful music. Amen.
[24:58] Appreciate that. The strength to believe
[25:02] uh fully persuaded. Amen. That that
[25:04] strength that we need to live in this
[25:07] day comes from being fully persuaded.
[25:09] It's it's like natural uh decisionmaking
[25:13] processes. the more that we waver back
[25:15] and forth, the more mental energy it
[25:18] takes from us, the more uh laborious it
[25:21] is. And uh we just want to go into
[25:23] Romans the 4th chapter starting with
[25:26] verse 15. And we'll just draw a little
[25:29] bit out of out of this uh tonight. Uh
[25:34] because we know where our strength to
[25:36] believe comes from. But sometimes we
[25:38] feel like that we ourselves are are the
[25:41] ones that are are exerting this energy
[25:44] to believe. But uh where where we stand
[25:48] today uh is uh fully from the word of
[25:52] God. It's it's the word that is our
[25:54] fortress. It's our strength. It's our
[25:56] guide. It's everything we need. Romans
[25:58] 4:15.
[26:00] Because the law workketh wrath, for
[26:03] where no law is, there is no
[26:06] transgression. Therefore, it is of faith
[26:09] that it might be by grace to the end the
[26:12] promise might be sure to all seed. Amen.
[26:16] And I I would like you to just repeat
[26:18] that to yourself. To all the seed. Amen.
[26:22] Not to that only which is of the law,
[26:24] but also that which is of the faith of
[26:26] Abraham, who is the father of us all. As
[26:30] it is written, I've made thee a father
[26:32] of many nations before him whom he
[26:34] believed, even God, who quickened the
[26:37] dead, and calleth those things uh which
[26:40] be not as though they were. Who against
[26:43] hope believed in hope, that he might
[26:45] become the father of many nations,
[26:47] according to that which was spoken, so
[26:50] shall thy seed be. And being not weak in
[26:54] faith, he considered not his own body
[26:56] now dead when he was a hundred years
[26:59] old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[27:02] womb. He staggered not at the promise of
[27:05] God through unbelief, but was strong in
[27:08] faith, giving glory to God, and being
[27:11] fully persuaded that he what he had
[27:15] promised, he was able also to perform.
[27:19] Therefore is imputed to him for
[27:21] righteousness. Now it was not written
[27:23] for his sake alone that it was imputed
[27:25] to him, but for us also to whom it shall
[27:29] be imputed if we believe on him that
[27:31] raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead
[27:34] who was delivered for our offenses and
[27:36] was raised again for our justification.
[27:40] Heavenly Father, we just ask you just to
[27:42] bless this thought tonight, the reading
[27:44] of your word. Lord, where the saints
[27:46] might be tonight. We don't know many of
[27:48] the circumstances, but we would just ask
[27:50] you to meet with them, speak to them,
[27:52] encourage them. Father, we ask this in
[27:55] your precious name. Amen. You may be
[27:58] seated. Amen. Now, as we'll look at
[28:01] this,
[28:04] we recognize that we're living in a day
[28:06] that um every single day there's a
[28:09] challenge. There's spirits of the age
[28:11] that are there. There is the frailty of
[28:14] our own human flesh, uh a weakness of
[28:18] our own minds. But God is pouring into
[28:21] you and I, the strength to believe. It
[28:24] is not something that we ourselves are
[28:26] able to say, I'm just going to believe.
[28:28] But Satan knowing that he can wear away
[28:31] at the human element and bring it to a
[28:33] place that as the scripture says, uh,
[28:36] not to be weary and welloing. and and
[28:39] Satan knows he can just continue to
[28:41] pound us and break us down. But there is
[28:44] a strength that has just continually
[28:47] been poured into us. And I believe every
[28:49] one of us would be able to say amen to
[28:51] that that even in our weakest times,
[28:53] there's something that pours into us
[28:56] that that uh suddenly uh we we say I can
[28:59] do this. when we think what we're on the
[29:01] verge of giving up, uh something is
[29:04] poured into us and and we stand up again
[29:06] with renewed vigor and press forward and
[29:09] and uh this is uh you know the moving of
[29:12] the Holy Spirit. It's what God has come.
[29:14] And he says, "When your when your
[29:16] strength is done, when your ability is
[29:19] done, I'll step in because you're my
[29:21] seed and I called you and and I have
[29:23] made a way for you." And and uh you
[29:26] know, think about the scripture says the
[29:28] way has been made smooth before us. And
[29:30] think of the challenges we face and we
[29:33] think there's such insurmountable so
[29:35] difficult challenge and God says, "I
[29:37] made it smooth for you." So just think
[29:40] of what would be before us if the Lord
[29:42] was not here to to take of that and uh
[29:45] and make that way for us. And the word
[29:47] has come and you know people uh you know
[29:51] um I'll just say this so you'll have a
[29:54] little context just uh
[29:57] um
[29:58] some critical things being have been
[30:01] written even against this church and and
[30:03] spread on the internet and and you look
[30:06] at that and on one side you would say oh
[30:08] my this is so discouraging but on the
[30:11] other side it's the fulfillment of the
[30:13] word and uh the word is not here for us
[30:16] to stand and war against this individual
[30:19] or against this individual or something
[30:21] that's been written out into the
[30:23] internet. But my brother and sister,
[30:25] we're here to deal and let the word
[30:28] speak to our soul. It's not what these
[30:30] people think. It's not what they think.
[30:32] It's what God thinks. And we stand here
[30:34] today according to the word. And and as
[30:37] we are here by the word, I don't know
[30:39] about you, but I believe I can speak
[30:41] with this much confidence. The word
[30:43] comes continually speaking to us in
[30:45] little words and little things and
[30:48] little scriptures and little quotes and
[30:50] and things just coming that he's just
[30:52] reassuring us, reminding us and
[30:54] encouraging us that that we're still in
[30:57] his will. We're still walking in his
[30:59] word. And you know, no matter what the
[31:01] world out here would think, just think
[31:03] about if we had been walking with Jesus
[31:05] in those days and and we were looking at
[31:08] it and we're saying, "We know this is
[31:10] the Messiah. We know this is the one
[31:12] that we've been looking for. And a man
[31:14] would come up and say, "You're
[31:15] Beelzebub.
[31:18] You're prince of devils. You You're
[31:20] evil. Uh you're a deceiver." And you
[31:24] know, we would feel, I believe, the same
[31:26] emotions. So, we look back into those
[31:28] days and those that were around Jesus
[31:31] would have felt the same, you might say,
[31:33] crushing blow as it would be of like,
[31:35] "How could they say this?" But you see,
[31:38] they were anointed of that. But the real
[31:40] believer in that day just stood there
[31:43] and said the evidence is so
[31:45] insurmountable that whatever their
[31:48] opinion of uh of Jesus is it it doesn't
[31:52] outweigh the evidence that has been
[31:55] given to us and and you would have to as
[31:58] it were shake it off and press forward
[32:01] because it's not about what they have to
[32:03] say right they said that he was be elub
[32:06] and uh in their mind they were
[32:08] completely accurate it. They They were
[32:10] certain that they had all the facts
[32:13] lined up. We've studied the scrolls.
[32:15] We've studied the prophets. We've
[32:17] studied everything and everything points
[32:19] that you're not him, but yet it was him
[32:22] standing there in their midst. And we'll
[32:25] look at this that we come to a time like
[32:27] that that maybe little things happen in
[32:30] our life and and we we feel like we have
[32:33] failed and we stagger under that, but
[32:36] something is then poured into us that
[32:38] gives us the strength to believe. And I
[32:41] believe that's why we're still standing
[32:43] today. It's not because we're such great
[32:45] strong people. It's not because we have
[32:48] exceptional mental powers or great
[32:50] exceptional physical strength. But it is
[32:53] the fact that God continues
[32:56] to pour into us and every day he's just
[32:59] pouring more into us and the word is
[33:02] speaking to the soul. Now my brother and
[33:04] sister, the scripture says that that
[33:06] Abraham was not weak in faith. Yet he
[33:10] had challenges. As we we look at this,
[33:13] we will see the challenges that he
[33:15] faced. And even in those you might say
[33:18] scripturally that there was some failure
[33:20] on Abraham's part. He he decided that
[33:24] maybe okay maybe Hagar is the answer and
[33:27] and he went that direction. But my
[33:30] brother and sister ultimately in the end
[33:32] God poured into him and Abraham was able
[33:35] to then believe and God never counted
[33:38] his unbelief against him. He said I'm
[33:42] looking at the picture that says you
[33:43] believe. And so it's there that we'll
[33:46] look at that and and the word verse 21
[33:49] says being fully persuaded.
[33:52] What he had promised he was able to
[33:54] perform. And I believe we could say amen
[33:56] tonight to it. What God has promised in
[33:59] our our day, our our hour, he is able to
[34:03] perform that. And he is here performing
[34:06] that even to the point as we read
[34:08] scripture the other day that God is the
[34:11] answer on the way even before we ask the
[34:15] question. And how many times we see of
[34:17] that things that have been spoken
[34:19] through the ages. Amen. Recorded in the
[34:22] scripture, recorded in the message. And
[34:24] we come today and it is so applicable to
[34:27] the hour that we live in now. And so,
[34:31] you know, my brother and sister, we'll
[34:32] look at this and realize that this bride
[34:35] of this day because God is pouring into
[34:38] her. I hear it many times. People make
[34:40] statements like, "If I just had more
[34:42] faith." Well, what you need to do is
[34:44] believe that the faith that God has
[34:46] poured into you is sufficient. It is not
[34:49] leaving you in a negative uh uh
[34:52] position, a deficit, but he's poured
[34:54] into you what we need to overcome in
[34:58] this day. because God's not going to
[34:59] have a bride in this day that is weak in
[35:02] faith. Amen. And so, how many times we
[35:06] would say, "Well, you know, uh I I I
[35:08] just uh I struggled with something. I
[35:11] kind of failed at something." And and we
[35:13] would look at ourselves as having uh
[35:16] come short of that. But, you know,
[35:18] Abraham, he staggered not because of
[35:21] unbelief. And yet we'll see the very
[35:24] attributes that he uh displayed,
[35:27] decisions that he made. This is my
[35:30] sister, not my wife. That that would we
[35:33] would in our lives say, "Man, I I really
[35:35] really made a huge mistake here because
[35:38] I I just lied to the man." And God
[35:40] didn't come back later and say, "Well, I
[35:42] guess the promise is void because you
[35:45] you wanted to protect your flesh."
[35:47] Uh-huh.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Is it not a human element that we often
[35:51] times, you'll see this when when
[35:53] situations come and and people have to
[35:56] tell the truth of the story? You know,
[35:58] we we structure I think is what they
[36:02] call that. And we tell the story in such
[36:05] a way that we don't look quite so bad.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Have you ever done that?
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You tell this story in such a
[36:14] fashion that it was, you know, pardon me
[36:17] to put it this way, but this is the
[36:19] closest relationships. It was the
[36:20] husband, it was the wife,
[36:24] maybe it was the children, and possibly
[36:27] if we get extreme, it could have been
[36:28] the pastor.
[36:30] It's not my fault. It's got to be
[36:32] someone else's besides me. Here's
[36:34] Abraham. He goes to this and and crafts
[36:37] this in such a fashion that he's only
[36:41] motive is to spare his own life. He's
[36:43] sure that the king is going to take his
[36:45] life to gain this beautiful young woman
[36:50] who wasn't young but in a body change
[36:54] had become young.
[36:57] Now look at the maturity that God's
[36:59] bringing in us. We come to the point
[37:02] Abraham knew he'd done wrong. And look
[37:04] what God does. He doesn't come back to
[37:06] Abraham and say, you know, I'm going to
[37:08] strike you dead for what you just did.
[37:10] He goes back to the king and says, "You
[37:13] lay a hand on her and you're dead." Now,
[37:17] the king says, "Look, you know, Lord,
[37:18] I'm a righteous man. You know that I I I
[37:21] love you and and I I" And God says,
[37:23] "That's why I'm giving you this chance."
[37:26] And so while Abraham's the one who told
[37:29] the story,
[37:32] God brings the king to be the one to
[37:34] correct it all. And now look at what's
[37:37] happening in our lives. We don't want to
[37:38] use this as an excuse to to say, "Well,
[37:41] God will make the other people
[37:43] straighten this all out." But look how
[37:45] God looks at this. He's he's not looking
[37:47] at us as the transgressor. He he looks
[37:50] at the whole picture and says, "You know
[37:52] what? because of these things, this is
[37:54] what has happened. And so we're here and
[37:57] what we might interpret as staggering
[37:59] from unbelief. God is not looking at it
[38:02] in that sense. God is looking at this
[38:04] because he knows that ultimately you
[38:07] will come back around and he will put
[38:09] everything back in order. And so as
[38:12] we'll look in Romans 8 and35 through39,
[38:18] we'll see how as we see there in in the
[38:22] fourth chapter, uh we will see how that
[38:25] that this is coming. God laying a a
[38:27] platform of who we are. Now by Romans
[38:30] the 8th chapter, the apostle Paul
[38:32] speaking to the Romans is bringing more
[38:34] clarity and and he says, "Who shall
[38:37] separate us from the love of Christ?
[38:39] shall tribulation or distress or
[38:42] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[38:44] peril or sword. As it is written, for
[38:47] thy sake we are killed all the day long.
[38:50] We are counted as sheep for the
[38:52] slaughter. Nay, in all these things we
[38:55] are more than conquerors. So God's not
[38:59] saying, look, you've suffered here.
[39:01] You've come short here. You failed at
[39:03] that. You didn't fully express or take a
[39:06] halt of faith here. you didn't apply the
[39:08] word over here and and you're you're
[39:10] just uh you know uh staggering along as
[39:13] a halfdefeated people. But the Apostle
[39:16] Paul speaking to a people that are
[39:18] facing the exact same tests and trials
[39:21] as we are in this day, the trial of
[39:24] their age. And he's bringing the word
[39:26] out and says, "Nay, in all these things,
[39:29] we are more than conquerors." Because
[39:31] he's looking beyond where we are right
[39:34] now to the promise. And the promise says
[39:37] that this will come to pass in you.
[39:40] Amen. And we believe that. And as we
[39:42] express that, God is pouring into you
[39:46] and I the strength to believe. Now, when
[39:49] I'm talking about believe, my brother
[39:51] and sister, I'm not putting it, oh,
[39:53] giving me the strength to believe the
[39:55] message is true. Oh, I I'm I'm going
[39:58] beyond that. I'm talking about pouring
[40:00] in you to believe that the word of God,
[40:04] the scripture, the message, however you
[40:06] want to put it, is for you. It is you.
[40:09] It is you he called. It is you that's
[40:11] manifested. It's you he will bring it
[40:14] forth in. It's the life that he promised
[40:16] to you. And you've got to come to the
[40:19] place that when you read that, your mind
[40:21] does not go, but I did this and I said
[40:24] that and I come short and will God help
[40:26] me because I did that. Forgive me, Lord.
[40:29] Oh, this man malfunctioned. Is God
[40:31] punishing me for this? No. My brother
[40:33] and sister, we need the strength to
[40:35] believe. This promise is immutable. This
[40:38] promise is not going to change. This
[40:42] promise is going to carry us through
[40:44] every challenge, whether it's the plains
[40:46] of Mamry, whether it's down in the city,
[40:49] whether it's down to Sodom, wherever it
[40:51] might be, this promise will never go
[40:54] away. God's not going to rescend it.
[40:56] He's not going to let it expire, but
[40:58] this promise is real. And this is the
[41:01] strength we need to believe. Not that
[41:04] God sent a prophet in this hour. People
[41:06] can read the scripture. If they don't
[41:08] want to accept it, they don't have to
[41:10] accept it. It's not really about that,
[41:12] but it's what the word says. So, when
[41:14] you start to cut out one section of the
[41:16] Bible because you don't want to believe
[41:18] it, where are you going to stop cutting?
[41:22] We're here by the word of God, by the
[41:24] grace of God, the Holy Spirit is moving
[41:26] upon us, not just to believe God sent a
[41:29] prophet. That's good. That's well,
[41:30] that's beautiful. But it's for us to be
[41:33] able to read every promise that's in
[41:35] this book and say, "That is me." Amen.
[41:38] Whether it comes down as simple as I I
[41:40] need healing, I'm already healed. I need
[41:43] deliverance, I'm actually already
[41:46] delivered. I need a blessing of some
[41:48] kind, I'm already blessed. Amen. Do not
[41:52] believe that it might happen. It could
[41:54] possibly happen. But to believe the
[41:56] promise says it is already a finished
[41:59] work. It's already the word having come
[42:02] to you and I in this day. And the God is
[42:06] speaking through. He speaks through the
[42:08] prophet. He speaks through ministers. He
[42:10] preach speaks through the reading of the
[42:12] word. And when we hear that and we
[42:14] believe that and we say amen to that,
[42:16] just as it was, we use had Wright for an
[42:19] example. Amen. As she thought in her
[42:22] heart, you know, she's thinking of the
[42:24] beauty of what brother Brandham was just
[42:25] talking about. And she says, "This is
[42:28] nothing but the truth." And God unlocked
[42:30] an incredible blessing upon her. And she
[42:33] didn't have a great revelation. She had
[42:35] no education to go by. She had nothing
[42:38] to fall back. I My brother and sister,
[42:40] what we have in the day we live in is so
[42:43] many educated people. They're looking
[42:45] here and they say, "Well, we can't fully
[42:47] understand what the word means until
[42:49] we've learned the Aramaic and the Greek
[42:51] and this and that." Well, that means
[42:53] some of us will never ever even have a
[42:55] clue what God is saying. But I tell you
[42:58] what God does. He comes by word. Amen.
[43:00] He comes by revelation and he gives you
[43:03] and I the strength that some things we
[43:05] don't fully understand, but we got the
[43:07] strength to say, "Amen. I believe that."
[43:10] And we trust God and step out on that.
[43:12] And the minute that we trust God, he
[43:14] gives us the strength to believe it and
[43:16] we step out on it, the prophet of God
[43:18] says God will bring that to pass in your
[43:22] life. Amen. And that's what we need. Not
[43:24] to have a second guessing, not to have a
[43:26] a question of what if, what if, what if,
[43:30] but to look at the word of God and say,
[43:32] God spoke it. Amen. Man might have
[43:34] pinned it, but God spoke it. And when we
[43:38] believe that and step out on that, he's
[43:40] pouring into us the strength to believe
[43:42] that it will come to pass. And I thank
[43:45] God for that. Amen. Because when I read
[43:48] this, I I I I can't speak for you this
[43:50] evening, but when I read this and I read
[43:53] this that we are more than conquerors
[43:55] through him that loved us. My brother
[43:57] and sister, I don't detect one single
[43:59] reason to doubt, one single reason to
[44:02] fear, one single reason to back up. I'm
[44:05] more than a conqueror. Amen. It's not
[44:07] enough just to say, "Hey, I'm overcoming
[44:10] this." But to move beyond that. Amen. As
[44:13] I've shared with the church here many
[44:14] times, I used to have the mentality if I
[44:17] could just crawl into heaven. Hands and
[44:19] knees, fingernails dug in, drag myself
[44:22] across the threshold, I would be happy.
[44:25] But one day, God spoke to my heart.
[44:27] Amen. I'm more than a conqueror. I'm not
[44:30] going to crawl and crawl and drag myself
[44:32] across the threshold into heaven, my
[44:34] brother and sister. I'm going to walk
[44:36] like a soldier of God. Victorious. Amen.
[44:39] In who I am because I'm more than a
[44:42] conqueror. Amen. I'm not a defeated man
[44:45] who's just barely making it by the grace
[44:47] of God. Even though we know that God's
[44:49] grace is the only reason we will make
[44:52] it. Amen. So it's uh persuaded that
[44:55] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[44:57] principalities nor powers nor things
[44:59] present nor things to come nor height
[45:02] nor depth or any other part of creation
[45:08] any other creature any other part of
[45:10] creation shall be able to separate us
[45:13] from the love of God which is in Christ
[45:16] Jesus our Lord.
[45:18] You know, it takes a real revelation to
[45:21] believe that scripture right there that
[45:23] there is literally not one thing on the
[45:27] earth today will keep you
[45:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; from stepping through that promise,
[45:34] stepping through the veil. We we we
[45:37] preach it. You have to preach it that
[45:38] way, right? People are in different
[45:40] stages of maturity and you have to
[45:42] preach it in the way that we do. You
[45:44] know, make your calling and election.
[45:45] Sure. But you see, when God starts to
[45:47] pour it into the heart and you're able
[45:50] by God's grace to say amen to that word,
[45:54] God says it's already finished.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; And in that position of already
[45:58] finished, we should now stand and
[46:00] confess
[46:02] it's finished.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Not looking like what if tomorrow I make
[46:06] a mistake. I like the little statement.
[46:09] I have no idea who who made this,
[46:13] but the statement says something on the
[46:15] order of when God made the plan of
[46:18] redemption, he factored in our
[46:20] stupidity.
[46:22] You have to really find a little humor
[46:24] in that that he already accounted
[46:28] for us.
[46:29] It's not a shock to him that we make bad
[46:33] decisions and we stumble over things and
[46:36] and say things we shouldn't say and do
[46:39] things we shouldn't do. It's not like it
[46:41] shocks God like we would be like
[46:45] God knew. He factored that in already.
[46:49] Now to be fully persuaded,
[46:53] very simple definition,
[46:55] completely
[46:57] convinced.
[47:00] So if there's even a nagging doubt,
[47:03] right, wherever condemnation's at, it
[47:06] robs us of our liberty, right?
[47:08] &gt;&gt; So condemnation is a good tool that
[47:12] Satan has because it is now coming in
[47:15] and it brings us to a place that we'd
[47:17] say, I'm fully persuaded. I believe
[47:19] this. But condemnation puts this little
[47:22] slight sliver in there
[47:26] that stops us from fully implementing.
[47:30] And this is, you know, I mean, how do we
[47:32] deal with condemnation?
[47:35] My dad many years ago, our sister, I
[47:38] don't know what it was like from where
[47:40] she come from, but my dad many years ago
[47:42] in the military,
[47:44] flew into different places in South
[47:47] America.
[47:49] And uh because he was a simple airplane
[47:52] mechanic, when the diplomats were doing
[47:54] their things, he was given time to just
[47:57] be able to go and look around.
[48:01] And in Bogota, Colombia, he come across
[48:04] a place where there was a Catholic
[48:06] church up on a a high like 40 or 50
[48:10] steps. And there were people, the steps
[48:12] were jagged, carved stone. And the
[48:16] people would stop at each step and pray
[48:20] pretty much the same prayer from their
[48:22] rosary and then move to the next step
[48:25] and repeat it all again. And by the time
[48:26] they got to the top steps, their knees
[48:29] were a bloody mess. And so these steps
[48:32] were stained in blood.
[48:36] And they thought that's what it took to
[48:38] find repentance, to find acceptance in
[48:41] the eyes of God. Aren't you glad that by
[48:44] revelation, God has given us the
[48:46] strength to believe that our prayer of
[48:48] repentance is sufficient to take and
[48:51] move us into the presence of God. And
[48:54] you see, they were sincere people. You
[48:56] can't tell me that if you go 50 steps
[49:00] and crawling on this jagged rock, this
[49:02] rough rock, that you're not a sincere
[49:05] person. But you see, that wasn't what
[49:07] God was looking for. He was looking for
[49:09] a heart that had strength to believe
[49:12] that the prayer of repentance was
[49:14] sufficient to move them forward. And if
[49:16] God would give us the revelation to have
[49:19] a prayer of repentance and know that our
[49:22] slate has been wiped clean, then how it
[49:24] would be for us to have the strength to
[49:27] believe that we as the bride of Jesus
[49:30] Christ have found favor in the eyes of
[49:33] Almighty God that he literally said, "I
[49:35] will lead you and I will guide you into
[49:37] all truth." It's something that we got
[49:40] to hold on to. Amen. Now, you might
[49:43] wonder, where are you coming from,
[49:44] brother Paul? Well, some of this stuff
[49:46] that has been spoken kind of a little
[49:48] bit ill against the message, a little
[49:50] bit ill against this church, a little
[49:52] bit ill against myself, my brother and
[49:54] sister, you see what they're doing is
[49:56] trying to cast the seed of doubt
[50:00] &gt;&gt; to mankind, to humanity.
[50:03] But I'm telling you that when God give
[50:05] us the strength to believe this word, no
[50:08] seeds of doubt, no seeds of fear, no
[50:11] seeds of of Satan are going to cause the
[50:14] bride of Jesus Christ to pull back from
[50:18] what she knows she has conquered. Amen.
[50:21] Through the grace of God, we are
[50:24] conquerors. Amen. And so that is not
[50:26] going to cause us to pull back. We are
[50:29] going to be fully completely convinced.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; And that's what it's going to take to
[50:35] actually make the rapture. We're going
[50:37] to have to be I don't care what age from
[50:38] our youngest that is here tonight to the
[50:41] eldest which is probably myself. No,
[50:44] Dad.
[50:46] Thank you, Dad, for saving me from that
[50:48] position.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; It don't matter which position we're in.
[50:53] We have to be completely convinced of
[50:57] who we are,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:59] &gt;&gt; And when we're completely convinced of
[51:01] who we are, then when we read the word,
[51:04] we can actually take and pull those
[51:07] nuggets out and apply them to our life.
[51:11] You know, it it's there that when we
[51:13] look at that, reminds me of a brother
[51:15] that I know, I won't name his name,
[51:17] years ago. We had some kids in his in
[51:19] his uh classes uh in the school, Sunday
[51:22] school stuff and they were struggling in
[51:24] their their schoolwork at school.
[51:28] And uh
[51:30] one of the young people come to him
[51:32] after a Wednesday night service and
[51:34] said, "Brother, I I'm pretty certain I'm
[51:37] going to fail this test."
[51:40] And he said, "You know what?
[51:43] What we're going to do is we're going to
[51:44] pray that God gives you a sound clear
[51:46] mind.
[51:48] And this this young person, teenager,
[51:51] struggling to remember all of this
[51:53] facts, figures, all this information.
[51:56] They prayed, went to school the next
[51:58] day, took the test. No, they didn't get
[52:01] an a perfect score or anything like
[52:03] that, but they passed resoundedly. The
[52:06] next Sunday they gathered every school
[52:08] child to the front of the church and
[52:11] prayed for their and their schoolwork
[52:13] and they saw a marked increase in their
[52:17] grades. Now my brother and sister, you
[52:19] say, "But but that's just school." No,
[52:22] that's the power of God fulfilling his
[52:24] word.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he said that I would provide
[52:27] for you, that I would do all this, he's
[52:29] not talking about the basic things here.
[52:32] He's talking about what's important to
[52:34] you. He's talking about what you need in
[52:36] your life that he is there to provide it
[52:38] for you. Now, I want to just read here
[52:42] and and kind of conclude this service
[52:44] tonight uh with a couple quotes. They're
[52:46] a little bit lengthy as we go on to uh
[52:50] putting on the whole armor of God. Uh
[52:53] and uh then we'll go to influence after
[52:56] that. Do we not have that, Sister
[53:00] Rachel? Whole armor.
[53:04] Somehow we skipped over that.
[53:07] Okay. Not the end of the world. Don't
[53:09] worry about it.
[53:12] Putting on the whole armor of God. 1962.
[53:16] Amen. Brother Brandham says this. Then
[53:19] if he's got to judge the world by some
[53:21] standard, why this? He watched over it.
[53:25] So it's just the way it ought to be. So
[53:27] I just believe it like that. Now when
[53:30] you take what brother Bram says here in
[53:32] paragraph 55, what the world is, it's
[53:35] just the way it ought to be. So I want
[53:37] you to look out today upon this whole
[53:40] world that we're living in. And it is
[53:43] just exactly what it ought to be for
[53:47] this day.
[53:49] Let's not waste one bit of our time
[53:51] saying if this was different, if that
[53:54] was different, our children going back
[53:56] to school, you know, um uh if that was
[54:00] if if things were different. No, my
[54:02] brother and sister, the Holy Ghost in
[54:03] your kid will prepare your child to go
[54:06] to that school and be an overcomer,
[54:09] victorious, more than an overcomer in
[54:11] that school because this is the world
[54:14] and it's just exactly how it ought to
[54:16] be.
[54:18] this is what it's got to come to.
[54:21] So, I just believe it like that. Just
[54:22] read it. Say, "Yes, Lord." And I believe
[54:25] when we believe God, every time God says
[54:27] anything, we punctuate it with an amen.
[54:29] That's right. Whatever God said, he
[54:32] said, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[54:34] today, and forever." Now, somebody would
[54:36] say, "Well, in a way, uh-uh. Amen." If
[54:40] he said, "Repent and be baptized and
[54:42] receive the Holy Ghost." Amen. See, he
[54:45] said the just shall live by faith. Amen.
[54:48] And he said, "I will come again." Amen.
[54:51] Whatever he says, the Holy Spirit inside
[54:54] of us, just punctuate it with an amen.
[54:58] See, then look for the next thing. See,
[55:00] that's wonderful that we can have faith
[55:02] like that. Now, God's poured in the
[55:05] strength for you and I that whatever the
[55:08] word has said, we can say amen to it.
[55:12] Even our saying amen might seem like a
[55:15] conflict with our current situation.
[55:20] Are you going to believe your situation
[55:22] or you going to believe the word? See,
[55:24] God pours a strength into us for us to
[55:27] be able to say amen to the word knowing
[55:30] the word will overcome our circumstance.
[55:39] Then look for the next thing. See, it's
[55:41] wonderful that we can have faith like
[55:42] that. Now, the reason I know it's right
[55:45] because God said over in the book of
[55:46] Revelation, "Whosoever shall take one
[55:49] part out of this book or add one part to
[55:51] it, oh my, that must be what he's going
[55:53] to judge the world by then." Oh, you say
[55:56] he's going to judge it by Christ. He is
[55:59] the word.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Can't get away from it. Ties it right
[56:02] back again. He is the word. Now, I just
[56:06] want to interject this because I I've
[56:08] been studying and looking through
[56:10] different things of what uh different
[56:12] denominations are saying and and
[56:14] whatnot. And we're seeing, my brother
[56:16] and sister, what we used to think was
[56:18] the mainstream uh stick with the Bible
[56:21] kind of uh religions are are now, you
[56:25] might say, passing certain rules that
[56:28] are saying it's going to be okay if we
[56:31] step away from the Bible into this
[56:34] position because we believe this is
[56:35] defensible.
[56:37] But my brother and sister, the minute we
[56:39] step away from the word to pick up
[56:40] anything else as our absolute,
[56:44] now you you'd say, "What is the
[56:45] absolute?" Well, the prophet of God over
[56:47] and over again said the word of God is
[56:49] the absolute.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; He says Jesus Christ is the absolute. He
[56:52] turns around and says Jesus is the word.
[56:56] And so as we'll look at this, we'll find
[56:58] that we have to come to a place that we
[57:01] have this absolute and it never changes.
[57:04] Amen. Now you look at this. You can't
[57:07] get away from it. Ties it right back
[57:08] again. He is the word. So now we know
[57:11] that the word is true. And if you say
[57:13] you have Christ and don't don't believe
[57:15] this word, there's something wrong with
[57:17] you uh what you've got cuz the word is
[57:20] right. Yes, sir. It's got to be the
[57:23] word.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Now you think about that. Why do you
[57:26] hold the word as an absolute but the man
[57:29] down the street doesn't?
[57:32] Because God's poured in you the strength
[57:34] to say amen to that word. And then your
[57:37] body, your revelation, your
[57:39] understanding of the word now responds
[57:41] to the amen when you said that word is
[57:44] true. Did that make it easy for us to
[57:46] live? Does it make it easy always for us
[57:48] to manifest that? No. My brother and
[57:50] sister, I don't know about you, this
[57:52] flesh when they say this is your
[57:53] greatest enemy. I'm sorry. I don't even
[57:56] like to get up and look in the mirror in
[57:57] the morning because uh as one brother
[57:59] one time said I I used to get up in the
[58:02] morning and say good morning enemy. And
[58:05] then he said I realized one day when the
[58:07] minister preached that your body will
[58:09] obey your confession. He said why am I
[58:12] declaring myself my own enemy? I want to
[58:15] be a friend of God and I believe I'm
[58:17] filled with the Holy Ghost. And he said
[58:19] I quit saying that. But you look at this
[58:21] we realize that we are our own worst
[58:23] enemy. It's not the world out here. It's
[58:26] how we respond to the world. Amen. Now,
[58:30] there's something wrong with you cuz the
[58:31] word is right. See, it's got to be the
[58:34] word. Now, we find out that God gave his
[58:37] children the best. Does any of you have
[58:40] the best? I believe we have the best.
[58:43] Amen. Now, it might not be the best car,
[58:46] the best clothes, the best house, but
[58:48] that's not what he's here to redeem.
[58:51] Amen. He's gi us the word. The word is
[58:53] here and the word is exactly what we
[58:56] need.
[58:58] God gave his children best. Therefore,
[59:00] he don't have to improve it. He just
[59:02] never changes. He hasn't changed one bit
[59:05] since the first time he gave for his
[59:07] children's protection. Now, when he knew
[59:09] there was a war in heaven, he had to
[59:11] kick out Satan. Then he come down to
[59:13] earth and fortified his children with
[59:15] his word. I want to ask you something.
[59:17] Just think now. Eve did not. While she
[59:20] was standing in this great fortress of
[59:22] his word, Satan was on the outside
[59:24] trying to use some kind of a technique
[59:26] to get her out of there. For as long as
[59:28] she stayed behind the word, everything
[59:31] was fine.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; And so we see that how it is. The
[59:35] prophet of God told us, just stay in the
[59:37] word, Satan can't get to you. I'm
[59:40] paraphrasing this because if he gets to
[59:42] you and you're in the word and he gets
[59:44] to you, he'll be your brother. Now
[59:47] imagine the devil is not going to push
[59:49] too hard under the protection of the
[59:51] word if it means he has to repent and
[59:55] get baptized.
[59:56] He's just not going to do it. He can't
[59:58] do that. He doesn't have the strength to
[1:00:02] submit to the word.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; He you'd you can give a lot of reasons
[1:00:07] of what, but it really actually comes
[1:00:09] down. This is Satan's weakness. He's not
[1:00:13] strong enough to submit.
[1:00:16] But God has given us you strength to
[1:00:20] submit to the word
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; and come under the blood. That's not a
[1:00:24] weakness. The world says, "Oh, you have
[1:00:27] religion as a crutch." But they have
[1:00:30] crutches. And their crutches are much
[1:00:32] bigger than your crutch. But ours is not
[1:00:35] really a crutch. It's who we are.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; It's what we were made to be. And then
[1:00:41] because we step into our position, God
[1:00:44] brings it about about. Amen. So as we
[1:00:48] look at this, I liked this quote because
[1:00:51] we'll find amen that when we say amen to
[1:00:55] the word, it immediately starts to have
[1:00:58] an impact on us. It starts to change us
[1:01:03] the very minute. Amen. There's some
[1:01:05] medicines that when you take them within
[1:01:07] just a little bit of time, it's flowing
[1:01:10] through your body, you know, maybe a uh
[1:01:13] some kind of uh uh I can't even think of
[1:01:16] what you call it. Um
[1:01:20] a moxicylin or something like that, you
[1:01:22] know, and immediately it's it's it's
[1:01:25] going into your body and it's starting
[1:01:26] to do its job. That's what the word
[1:01:28] does. And then when we consume the word,
[1:01:31] when we embrace the word, it immediately
[1:01:34] goes to work in our life. Now, my
[1:01:36] brother and sister, it takes a little
[1:01:38] bit of time to come to pass, but God
[1:01:41] starts to work immediately. Amen. That's
[1:01:44] why it doesn't say in Acts 2:38,
[1:01:46] "Repent, be baptized. In 18 months, you
[1:01:51] shall receive the Holy Ghost." That word
[1:01:53] when you activate it starts to work
[1:01:56] immediately.
[1:01:58] And that's the beauty of taking God at
[1:02:01] his word, at his promise. Lord, give us
[1:02:03] the strength to believe. Amen. Now,
[1:02:06] we'll have uh we'll have the words for
[1:02:08] this here, the quote influence. And uh
[1:02:12] sorry to to have all this reading, but I
[1:02:15] just thought it was very good.
[1:02:17] Now, it says now what a real servant
[1:02:20] that is of God. Note, show the prophet
[1:02:23] how his prepared servant should be. What
[1:02:26] should be prepared? Uh what should be
[1:02:30] prepared servant be? Now these servants
[1:02:32] look he had looked at a man on earth
[1:02:35] here to see what a failure he made. Then
[1:02:37] God showed him the kingdom of heaven a
[1:02:40] throne. That's the one to look at. He
[1:02:43] then he showed him what a real servant
[1:02:46] ought to be that he served in his
[1:02:48] presence. And here was these
[1:02:49] seraraphims. men covered their holy
[1:02:52] faces, covered their feet, and with two
[1:02:54] wings they went into action. Reverent,
[1:02:57] humble, and in action. Amen. If that
[1:03:01] isn't a dressed up servant, I don't know
[1:03:04] what it is. Reverent, humble, and in
[1:03:07] action. Amen. It takes strength, my
[1:03:10] brother and sister, to take this word
[1:03:13] and put it in action.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. They say that a a good habit is
[1:03:18] formed and a bad habit is formed and
[1:03:20] they put certain amount of time to each
[1:03:22] one of those. I don't want to misquote
[1:03:23] that. It takes longer to get rid of a
[1:03:26] habit than it does to create it. But you
[1:03:28] see, it's the time that we put into
[1:03:31] that. We'll talk about a good habit.
[1:03:33] Amen. But after 30 days, you you have a
[1:03:36] shift in your thinking and you do that.
[1:03:39] And I I would say and speaking to myself
[1:03:41] here, Lord, let us apply this to our our
[1:03:44] own life. give us the strength in our
[1:03:47] own life to be reverent.
[1:03:50] Now look at the broad spectrum of being
[1:03:52] reverent. It's not just reverent to God,
[1:03:53] but actually being respectful to one
[1:03:56] another. You cannot have an attitude
[1:03:59] towards your brother or sister and and
[1:04:01] say, "Praise God, I've got the Holy
[1:04:03] Ghost. I'm anointed, but I just I had a
[1:04:06] man tell me this once. He said, "Praise
[1:04:08] God, I love this church. I love the
[1:04:10] pastor. I hate that person right there."
[1:04:13] And I'm just like, I think my
[1:04:15] conversation with you is over. Cuz what
[1:04:18] can you say to a man that would actually
[1:04:19] express that in the house of God there's
[1:04:21] somebody sitting on a pew that he hates?
[1:04:25] Needs It's time to repent. It's time to
[1:04:27] get the bitterness out. It's time to get
[1:04:29] the envy and the strife out. It's time
[1:04:31] to let the strength of the word come in
[1:04:34] and wash those things from us. Amen. So,
[1:04:38] I I want to be I can speak for myself.
[1:04:40] Uh, I want to be reverent, humble, and
[1:04:43] in action. Oh my, I tell you, like a
[1:04:46] little woman at the well, when she
[1:04:48] recognized that gift of God and this man
[1:04:50] that spake was the Messiah, it sure put
[1:04:53] her in action right quick. Now, I want
[1:04:56] to ask us a question. There's not too
[1:04:57] many of us here tonight. If the woman in
[1:04:59] the well came to church here tonight,
[1:05:02] how would we approach her?
[1:05:05] How would we look at her? How would we
[1:05:06] speak to her? Could we accept her?
[1:05:11] Remember in those days she couldn't even
[1:05:13] go to the well at the same time that all
[1:05:16] the respectable women went to the well.
[1:05:20] She had to go in the off time.
[1:05:22] And when Jesus said, "I have needs to go
[1:05:25] to Samaria,"
[1:05:27] he knew by discernment of the Holy
[1:05:30] Spirit exactly what time she would walk
[1:05:34] up to that well.
[1:05:36] How perfect that is. Let's think about
[1:05:39] this saints. Maybe the day will come
[1:05:42] that that woman will walk in this
[1:05:44] church.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Don't look at it as an accident. Look at
[1:05:47] it like what she is doing here. Oh my.
[1:05:50] But let's look at it as God's perfect
[1:05:53] timing.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; And give us the strength to look at that
[1:05:57] and say this could well be a Rahab. This
[1:06:01] could be a woman at the well. This could
[1:06:04] be of those of that nature. And it's
[1:06:08] God's perfect timing.
[1:06:12] Let us be in God's perfect timing.
[1:06:16] Not look back and say, "Wished we would
[1:06:18] have treated them nicer." Let's be in
[1:06:21] the word, in the atmosphere, and when
[1:06:24] they come, be God's hands, his feet. So,
[1:06:29] you know, many people in that day
[1:06:30] wondered why in the world Jesus would
[1:06:32] have anything to do with that girl. But
[1:06:34] he knew when she recognized that gift of
[1:06:37] God, this man that spoke was the
[1:06:39] Messiah. It sure put her in action right
[1:06:41] quick. She forgot about her water pot.
[1:06:43] She ran in the city saying, "Come see a
[1:06:45] man who's told me the things I've done.
[1:06:48] Isn't this the very Messiah?" Oh, what
[1:06:50] an action
[1:06:52] she went into.
[1:06:54] Peter,
[1:06:56] when he took him at his word,
[1:06:59] as we was speaking this morning out
[1:07:01] there in the boat, did you notice when
[1:07:03] Peter took his word and dropped the net
[1:07:06] down in there and caught the big load of
[1:07:09] fishes, the multitude of fishes, quickly
[1:07:12] Peter left the net and got into action.
[1:07:15] Before he done that, he fell down before
[1:07:17] the Lord and said, "Depart from me, oh
[1:07:19] Lord. I'm a sinful man." If that is not
[1:07:23] the very words like Isaiah the prophet
[1:07:26] said, "Woe is me, for I've seen the Lord
[1:07:29] God and a man of unclean lips." Don't
[1:07:32] you see what the presence of the Lord
[1:07:36] does to real believers?
[1:07:43] God, give us the strength to respond
[1:07:46] correctly when the presence of the Lord
[1:07:49] comes in our midst.
[1:07:52] Not to walk out and say it was just a
[1:07:54] good service, but to respond correctly.
[1:07:59] When the Holy Spirit speaks to hearts,
[1:08:02] speaks to our heart, let us be quick to
[1:08:05] say, Lord, I'm here to receive it. speak
[1:08:09] to my heart.
[1:08:12] Then he goes and says, "We don't even
[1:08:14] want to confess. We just want to say,
[1:08:16] well, we are Pentecostal. We are
[1:08:18] Baptists. We're Presbyterians.
[1:08:20] We're message believers."
[1:08:24] Oh, that wasn't in the quote, was it?
[1:08:28] And live on. But a real genuine called
[1:08:32] servant of God humbles himself in the
[1:08:35] presence of God. He doesn't criticize
[1:08:38] it. Look who criticized the Lord Jesus
[1:08:41] was the Pharisees, the secretarianism.
[1:08:44] They was the one who criticized him. But
[1:08:47] but the man who is really willing to be
[1:08:49] his servant, humbled himself, went into
[1:08:52] action. Jesus says, "You'll follow me.
[1:08:54] I'll make you fishers of men." When he
[1:08:56] saw that the action really was God,
[1:09:00] uh when he saw that that really was God,
[1:09:02] he went into action. The blind man that
[1:09:05] was healed, the Bible said he scattered
[1:09:07] his fame throughout the country abroad.
[1:09:10] He went to action when he found out that
[1:09:12] God had representative here on the earth
[1:09:15] that could open the eyes of a blind man
[1:09:18] was going around testifying, giving God
[1:09:20] praise. And the Pharisees caught him and
[1:09:23] what it was going to be to him. And as I
[1:09:26] said this morning, why he said, "I can't
[1:09:28] explain. I can't argue theology with
[1:09:31] you, but this one thing I know wherein
[1:09:33] once I was once blind, I now see. He was
[1:09:37] into action certainly because he had
[1:09:39] scattered his fame everywhere. And
[1:09:42] sometimes maybe you're not a minister
[1:09:45] to scatter his fame, but your life will
[1:09:49] scatter his fame if you'll just live
[1:09:52] right.
[1:09:53] Amen. I pray tonight, probably the
[1:09:57] shortest sermon I've preached in
[1:09:59] decades,
[1:10:01] but I pray tonight that we would
[1:10:04] actually
[1:10:06] accept the strength God has given us. We
[1:10:10] were talking, having a little
[1:10:11] conversation about times that we have
[1:10:13] made mistakes and maybe felt we should
[1:10:16] witness and we felt apprehensive and we
[1:10:20] didn't follow through.
[1:10:22] I'd pray the Lord just give us strength
[1:10:25] to live it and do the right thing when
[1:10:29] the situation is such that we would just
[1:10:32] have the courage to say, you know what,
[1:10:34] I'm not going to worry about what the
[1:10:36] world thinks of me. I'm not going to
[1:10:37] worry about what's happening around me.
[1:10:40] If this person is talking about they
[1:10:42] have a need in their life, I'm going to
[1:10:43] tell you, I have the answer for you. I'm
[1:10:45] going to say it with boldness. It's
[1:10:47] Jesus Christ. Lord, let that strength be
[1:10:50] in us as the kids are going to be going
[1:10:52] back to school here very shortly. Uh
[1:10:55] some even started already today. Uh let
[1:10:58] it be a season that God would come and
[1:11:01] anoint them with the strength to stand
[1:11:03] in this day and be those little epistles
[1:11:07] of God to be read of all men. You say,
[1:11:10] "You know, brother Paul, they're just
[1:11:11] children." But I can introduce you to a
[1:11:14] few people that their children actually
[1:11:17] led people to the Lord. Children 12, 13,
[1:11:21] 14 years old witnessed in the school and
[1:11:25] people were saved because of a child's
[1:11:28] witness.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Theirs where God poured strength into a
[1:11:32] child that they were bold to say, "Jesus
[1:11:36] Christ is a savior. He's a healer. He's
[1:11:39] peace. He's comfort. He's our fortress.
[1:11:43] They didn't have to explain the ins and
[1:11:44] out of theology, but from their heart,
[1:11:47] they had a boldness just to express
[1:11:49] Jesus Christ is the answer. And I pray
[1:11:52] that God would just let us find that
[1:11:55] strength as a group of believers to
[1:11:59] share this gospel. We have had people
[1:12:02] coming into the church, visiting the
[1:12:04] church. We've baptized a few people. We
[1:12:07] We have I'm going to I'm going to be
[1:12:09] confident and say we've had a sister
[1:12:11] who's now come for probably seven or
[1:12:14] eight weeks. Uh just sits back there,
[1:12:16] cries, nods her head yes. Amen. Older
[1:12:19] sister. What we want to do is so live
[1:12:22] this gospel boldly that she will
[1:12:26] realize, I need this. Let's not be that
[1:12:29] timid sheep that backs away that we
[1:12:32] don't want to offend them. If they're
[1:12:34] the bride of Christ, we can't offend
[1:12:37] them as long as we are not offensive.
[1:12:41] Amen. God, give us strength to take a
[1:12:44] hold of this promise. Say amen when we
[1:12:47] should say amen. Amen. As the scripture
[1:12:50] says, yay and amen. I believe it. We are
[1:12:54] the bride of Christ. I don't care what
[1:12:57] Sadducees say. I don't care what
[1:12:59] Pharisees say. I don't care what the
[1:13:00] Herodians say. I don't care what the, so
[1:13:03] to speak, theologians of our day say.
[1:13:06] They've got nothing to offer. I I'm just
[1:13:09] uh still human enough. If you're going
[1:13:11] to give me a pitch, you better have
[1:13:14] something to offer me.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. What you have is garbage. What are
[1:13:19] you trying to give me? If what I have is
[1:13:22] garbage, give me something better.
[1:13:25] But when they want to give you less and
[1:13:28] cause you to give up what you have, that
[1:13:31] is a unclean spirit.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand on the word because if God's
[1:13:37] going to lead you to something better,
[1:13:40] he'll take you to his word to lead you
[1:13:43] to something better. Amen. Sister Vika,
[1:13:46] would you come please?
[1:13:48] Musicians.
[1:13:51] Amen.
[1:13:53] Brother Alex.
[1:13:56] Amen. You see, our answers are in the
[1:13:58] word
[1:14:00] and our leadership is in the word and
[1:14:03] our strength comes from the word. Amen.
[1:14:07] Let that be our answer in this day.
[1:14:11] Lord, give us more strength to believe.
[1:14:14] Let's sing that little song. Maybe
[1:14:16] stand. I don't know what brother Alex
[1:14:17] might have on his heart, but I just uh
[1:14:20] looking at that song 487. Sister Rachel
[1:14:24] Hosanna,
[1:14:25] I just want this to be what my life
[1:14:29] would reflect. Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, magnify
[1:14:39] the Lord with me
[1:14:43] for he is worthy to be praised.
[1:14:49] Oh, magnify
[1:14:51] the Lord with me
[1:14:55] for he is worthy to be praised.
[1:15:02] Hosana.
[1:15:05] Blessed be the rock. Oh, blessed be the
[1:15:10] rock of my salvation.
[1:15:14] Hosana.
[1:15:17] Blessed be the rock. Oh, blessed be the
[1:15:22] rock of my salvation.
[1:15:26] Oh, glory,
[1:15:28] glory to his name.
[1:15:33] For he
[1:15:35] reigns forever more.
[1:15:39] Glory,
[1:15:41] glory to his name.
[1:15:45] He lives and reigns forever more.
[1:15:51] Hosana.
[1:15:55] Blessed be the rock. Oh, blessed be the
[1:15:59] rock of my salvation.
[1:16:04] Hosana.
[1:16:07] Blessed be the rock.
[1:16:10] Blessed be the rock of my salvation.
[1:16:15] ation. Jehovah
[1:16:18] Gyra is his name
[1:16:23] for he proideth all my needs.
[1:16:29] Jehovah
[1:16:31] Gyra is his name
[1:16:35] for he provideth all my needs.
[1:16:42] Hosana.
[1:16:45] Blessed be the rock.
[1:16:48] Blessed be the rock of my salvation.
[1:16:54] Hosana.
[1:16:57] Blessed be the rock.
[1:17:00] Blessed be the rock of my salvation.
[1:17:08] Amen.
[1:17:10] Um, maybe we can sing that song. Um,
[1:17:16] it's called Victory Ahead if you can
[1:17:18] find it. I think it's the same key.
[1:17:23] When the hosts of Israel led by God
[1:17:29] round the walls of Jericho softly draw,
[1:17:34] trusting in the Lord, they felt the
[1:17:38] conqueror's tread. By faith they saw the
[1:17:41] victory
[1:17:43] ahead.
[1:17:45] Victory ahead.
[1:17:48] Victory ahead
[1:17:51] through the blood of Jesus. Victory
[1:17:54] ahead.
[1:17:56] Trusting in the Lord, I hear the
[1:18:00] conqueror tread. By faith, I see the
[1:18:03] victory
[1:18:05] ahead.
[1:18:07] David with the shepherd's sling and five
[1:18:11] stones. Met the giant on the field all
[1:18:16] alone.
[1:18:18] Trusting in the Lord, he knew what God
[1:18:22] had said. By faith, he saw the victory
[1:18:27] ahead.
[1:18:29] Victory ahead.
[1:18:32] Victory ahead.
[1:18:34] Through the blood of Jesus. Victory
[1:18:38] ahead.
[1:18:39] Trusting in the Lord, I hear the
[1:18:43] conquerors tread. By faith I see the
[1:18:46] victory
[1:18:48] ahead.
[1:18:50] Daniel prayed unto the Lord thrice each
[1:18:54] day. Then unto the lion's den led the
[1:19:00] way. Trusting in the Lord he did not
[1:19:04] fear or dread. By faith he saw the
[1:19:08] victory
[1:19:10] ahead.
[1:19:12] Victory ahead.
[1:19:14] Victory ahead
[1:19:17] through the blood of Jesus. Victory
[1:19:20] ahead.
[1:19:22] Trusting in the Lord, I hear the
[1:19:25] conqueror shred. By faith, I see the
[1:19:29] victory
[1:19:31] ahead.
[1:19:33] Often with the carnal mind, I was tried,
[1:19:38] asking for deliverance.
[1:19:41] Off I cried. Trusting in the Lord, I
[1:19:46] reckoned I was dead. By faith I saw the
[1:19:50] victory
[1:19:52] ahead.
[1:19:54] Victory ahead.
[1:19:57] Victory ahead.
[1:19:59] Through the blood of Jesus. Victory
[1:20:03] ahead.
[1:20:05] Trusting in the Lord, I hear the
[1:20:08] conqueror shred. By faith, I see the
[1:20:11] victory
[1:20:13] ahead.
[1:20:15] And when, like those who've gone before,
[1:20:18] to that land, by this river, cold and
[1:20:23] dark, I shall stand, trusting in the
[1:20:27] Lord. I will not fear or dread. By faith
[1:20:32] I see the victory
[1:20:35] ahead.
[1:20:37] Victory ahead.
[1:20:39] Victory ahead.
[1:20:42] Through the blood of Jesus. Victory
[1:20:46] ahead.
[1:20:47] Trusting in the Lord. I hear the
[1:20:50] conqueror shred. By faith I see the
[1:20:54] victory
[1:20:56] ahead.
[1:20:59] Amen. Let's go to number 977
[1:21:02] and uh we'll close with this song.
[1:21:10] In his time.
[1:21:17] In his time

[1:21:47] me your way

[1:21:57] in your time.
[1:22:03] In his time.
[1:22:10] In his time.

[1:22:43] be to you a lovely
[1:22:48] thing
[1:22:49] in his time. Let's sing this verse
[1:22:52] again.
[1:22:55] Oh, in his time.

[1:23:16] in his time.
[1:23:22] Lord, my life to you I bring.
