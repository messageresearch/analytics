in this world realizing a Supernatural Supernatural God loves you so much to come down and make it personal to you amen not an abstract God's out there somewhere he's right here amen and not somewhere he's in our hearts in our soul in our mind in our body amen can we just give the Lord a hand clap of Praise today amen hallelujah hallelujah I didn't catch all of the prayer requests but we certainly want to uh be faithful to remember uh the saints that are directly connected to this assembly and uh sister April uh sharing uh interesting you know you just think it might be almost like a field trip but she's over there in a spiritual warfare and uh you know a lot of lot of things happening and uh we just want to remember our sister lift her up before the Lord amen we also want to remember I believe it's next weekend or brother John Andes is holding their my how time flies their third anniversary as a church my it just seems like it was yesterday amen amen let's just remember them they have some guest speakers I believe a brother from Poland can't remember the name I'm sorry brother from South Africa I believe it is Africa anyway and uh we just want them to have a one wonderful wonderful weekend this next weekend the power of God just come down deal with hearts you know uh they they have their struggles also just as we do but God is faithful amen and I say thank you Lord that you are faithful Hallelujah um let's just go in our Bibles to the book of Titus thank you musicians enjoyed that several of the songs just kind of touched uh might not come out in what I'm speaking but to me and my thoughts as I have studied uh have been very much there so I certainly appreciate the hand of God when he comes down and and just speaks to us and confirms to us that um it's not our ideas it's his and everything that we are everything that we will ever be is in him and uh we thank the Lord for that amen Titus the third chapter verses 5 through 7 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us amen by the washing of regeneration not replacement that's right God didn't go find someone that was a little more perfect than us and said I'll just set him in that position in your stead but regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit which he shed on us abundantly can we say the word together abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made hes according to the hope of eternal life Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity to come Lord to give praise and worship and hear the word of God as you speak to us Lord let it settle right into Those portions of our our heart Mind Body Soul Lord to renew us amen regenerate us father fill us with your Holy Spirit once again that we could leave today Lord with questions answered Spirits rejuvenated Lord strength in this old body father a Clarity of mind that we can press to the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus we thank you once again Lord in your precious name amen amen you may be seated I just want to say God bless you and greetings to our our visitors and certainly um if I understood correct you go to brother Barry's yes give brother Barry Sister Lisa well the assembly our Greetings From Grace Tabernacle amen amen it's uh it's a wonderful time uh the Lord is just doing and also want to greet our other visitors God bless you amen young man uh we just uh come together Saints of lack precious faith today now as we look at this today this thought uh I just really had a lot of lot of uh you know little distracting thoughts Associated today but by God's grace maybe this can come out if he will be so kind it will flow and actually make sense you see it says not by works of righteousness which excuse me not by works of righteousness which we have done now you know the devil doesn't like it I haven't had a fit since yesterday not by righteousness which we have done the scripture says that our righteous is as filthy rags that we have really nothing to offer we could say you know I've lived a good life I've done this I've done that some of these things in my life that used to bother me I've put them behind me I've been delivered I've done this and I've done that but the truth of it is Saints we have done nothing all that we have done what we do our contribution is simply surrendering to the Lord Jesus Christ it that's that's the great challenge that we have for us is not what we can attain but what we can give up to his service and so if it were of righteousness uh the prophet of God says that there would be many more people more sincere than us so if it was about our sincerity we already know that we would have come short and so it's here that we're not relying on who we are and you know sometimes when you preach this way it sounds like that we we are kind of speaking down on the very life that's been given to us but really what it is is we're recognizing that we are nothing without Jesus Christ and and in that I'm perfectly well I I'm I'm perfectly comfortable I I don't feel like that I'm demeaning myself or or debasing or or declaring myself unfit which I could but he says we're worthy amen because he is worthy so we're not going to debase our s on looking at this flesh and and the thoughts that we might battle and emotions that we battle you know what I'm talking about amen the devil coming and telling him you're not good enough God would not have chosen you my brother and sister that you you know that didn't come from God he's never going to come now there might be preachers on the earth that believe that cutting you down is the way to make you a better Christian but that's not what the word of God does he corrects us amen but he builds us up he he wants us to lift up to the place that we know that we were called of him before the foundation of the world that we can have a confidence to stand in the day that we're living and know that we are going to be victorious amen there's no reason to go into the battle if you believe you're already defeated amen it's hard I I was just reading in the Old Testament there several different places is connecting together and you know my brother and sister you you'll find in scripture where you know the ammonites were there and they're telling them yeah we'll spare you we'll do this all I need you to do is give up all your rights and let us pluck out your eye and we'll let you live my brother and sister the devil would like to offer you that today that you would not be able to see any further revelation of the word of God but he would leave you in peace otherwise we were called to see the word amen Our Eyes Are Open the light is shining Upon Us you're not here to settle for a life of peace and comfort with not another Revelation from the Lord in our life amen he wants to reveal himself and will reveal himself to us right to the coming of the Lord amen revelation will flow it will come forth because this is a relationship amen now you know we can all kind of I say this a tad bit joking we marry a young woman she's young and pretty has not had children not suffered through the nights of sicknesses and all of these other things the labors of life and we would just like to keep her as that pretty little 20 year-old as she was the day you married her but you see she must mature she has a child it is as a revelation she'll never be the same and she has a relationship with a husband that will leave her never the same you see maybe a poor analogy but these things are in life we don't just come to his place and stop we continue to mature we continue to come forth and that's who we really are my brother and sister that 20 years is just a stage it doesn't stop there and we don't come to the word of God by Revelation our eyes opened and our ears hearing just to come to a place to stop that's a beginning Point that's a place where God says I'm going to take you on through and I'm going to reveal myself to you in this relationship but if we are content to stop at any place along the way and say this is far enough my brother and sister you will not see the revelation of Jesus Christ himself amen so being justified by his grace we should be made HS according to the hope of eternal life now the word should there is actually speaking in a positive context that if we'll do what the word said we will become okay not a hope as in maybe it could come or whatever we just have to follow the word and when we being justified by his grace amen a true justification of Grace now we talk about justification and it's a a stage that we go beyond but you must understand you can't leave that stage out there's no way you leave that stage out now here I just want to just look into the sermon perseverance it's here in a prayer I pray thee God forgive our sin of unbelief long as we have been following thee and we confess Lord that we're way short of the requirements as ministers and as Christians I'm glad he put the ministers first doesn't need to put people down ministers are responsible for a lot of this amen they'll get credit but they'll also face judgment so it's there he's saying we're way short of the requirement as ministers and as Christians so be merciful to us oh merciful god and as a man cried one day uh with a boy with epilepsy said Lord help my unbelief we cry to thee tonight Lord after we read the promises of this precious Bible and see what could be done then we cry help our unbelief send the presence of the Lord Jesus in our midst tonight as we speak on the word and may the word become flesh and our spirit catch it amen you got to catch it amen how much let me put it this way how many times has the word come God speaking from his word I'm not talking about a man but God speaking from his word and it just went on bias amen it went unclaimed if the church had a lost and found it would be full but you see my brother and sister sister we've got to come to the place that the word has come to our flesh Christ alive Amen in our flesh it comes and we have to catch that we got to be in the right Spirit we come to church you know what I'm talking about we have distractions we have struggles we have that and the devil just loves to climb in the car with you on Sunday morning and ride to church with you amen he loves to the devil just loves to anoint that crazy guy that you know everything's wrong in his life and it's everybody else's fault and he wants to cut you off and he wants a this and he wants a that because the devil's trying to catch and condition condition Your Atmosphere my we we serve God Faithfully my brother and sister and we let the devil condition our atmosphere so when it comes to a situation like this what we've got to do is recognize the holy spirit's here and we need to reach out and catch that amen and believe it I don't care if you had a rough morning a rough week a rough month a rough year or think your life has been a rough life you can reach out and catch the Holy Spirit now you say no man can do that yes you can because the wooing of the spirit is there God is here wooing us amen I'm not talking about you know uh the unconverted Heathen that doesn't care about God God I'm talking about you and I that we just stop and say well I I don't know I just didn't get much out of the service did you reach out was you trying to catch a halt of it was you C crying out to the Lord amen so here we are I I want to just pull a couple things out of this as long as we have been following thee and we confess Lord that we're way short of the requirements whose fault is that it's not God's fault we've allowed all kinds of things to come in and we brought them to church with us and we actually allow them to continue to reside in our house you know the spirit of resentment my brother and sister he's content to live in the closet till he wants to come out the spirit of bitterness all of these Spirits we'll just sum it up that way are content to just live in your house in the closet until they see the proper time to come out and when they come out Spirits are expressed in such an incredible way it's almost shocking something of resentments and this and that just suddenly burst forth and we say where did that come from it's been living there the whole time it didn't bust it didn't you know it didn't pick the lock it didn't crawl in through an unlatched window it's been there all the time amen I didn't hit on the title of of the sermon uh it's still I didn't give it a secondary title but a a change in our thinking because you see as we're coming closer to the end of all of this my brother and sister prophecy that Russia would go for the oil now it doesn't take a very bright person to take a ruler and a map and draw the lines it doesn't take a very smart person person to see what's happening in the world today and how it all connects together so what we got to do is stop from our life long enough to see what God has for us we get so caught up in this and so caught up in that amen reminds me of a little story supposedly true of two men standing on the same Corner in a city uh testifying to the people two different signs and as they're there one looks over at the one preacher looks over at the other one's sign and says you know I don't agree with you and the other guy says well I wasn't going to say anything but now that you mention it I don't agree with you and they're both standing there now the Lord is dealing with them because as they're continuing to speak to the people something's working on them God's telling each one of those Is This Love and after a little bit both them men turn to each other and said I think they're that cuz they're budding into each other God is love I believe both of them changed their message on that street corner and started declaring to the people God is love they found Unity on the corner by setting their difference aside now it doesn't mean all difference needs to be tossed out but there's a time and a place a platform for the difference to be dealt with and it starts with prayer because prayer is what changes things and so as it is my brother and sister we come we know what we believe we've had it proven Vindicated to us the word is true but my brother and sister whether this comes to pass just like this or this comes to pass just like this our thoughts don't matter what does God's thoughts that's where we need to come together and say I want to be right in the word I want to I want to know what God thinks about this what God's wanting to say about this and maybe my idea of it is just a little skewered but I want God's thoughts and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts so we can always subject oursel or or surrender to his thoughts amen and so as we look at this as we journey along in this life we experience revelation correct amen sometimes we experience a lot of revelation God is gracious to us opens our eyes tremendously that that we see this uh to have wonderful experiences of the word speaking to us to have questions in our minds for years but yet we're we're able by God's grace to put those up on a shelf not let them distract us from serving God and and as it is that we are we are there and and these things are opening up and then God starts to open up and answer the questions amen how wonderful to experience the opening of the word can we say amen amen it is it is not laborious for us it is beautiful it is glorious Amen to see the word being opened and you know here's the wonderful thing about God he doesn't say now I'm going to give Revelation to this whole church at once but he'll drop Revelation down Revelation down re ration down and sometimes that is concerning certain situations or teachings that we've had or or aspects of our spiritual life and God brings us and we come to that maturity and he drops in a revelation and we move forward so the eban flow of a body of Believers is never stagnant it's not a solid wall moving but it's always alive amen can you say Amen to that the revelation of Jesus Christ is always alive it's always moving and touching and and expressing amen I say the opening of the word to you and I is personal amen we cannot preach as it were a blanket message that you must achieve a certain Thing by a certain time in your spiritual walk my brother and sister God is a personal God Amen he'll save the whole world if they'll give him the opportunity but they don't want the opportunity but there was something something he placed in you and I before the foundation of the world that has a desire to know the things of God and to live not just to know but to live those things amen so the opening of the word is to you personal and sometimes we're overwhelmed by the presence of God Amen but we don't want to be past tense we we refer to that past tense I could give you I could give you examples of past tense why would we look in past tense when we can ask God to come present tense to have the presence of God here in this assembly this morning in such a powerful way that we walk out and know we'll never be the same that's what we should long for amen amen it's not just teaching we need the experience of the presence of the Holy Spirit moving my brother and sister it doesn't have to happen in church alone we can have that experience in our car going down the road all by ourselves amen we don't need someone patting us on the back or someone you know prodding us to go forward amen it's God in you the hope of glory amen it's not God in the church God in the preacher God in this and that it's God in you that is that experience amen so we get to see this and and the opportunity to be overwhelmed by the presence of God is actually with you every day you hold the key to release the presence of God in your life the church doesn't hold it the preachers doesn't hold it somebody in an office somewhere far beyond the world doesn't hold it you hold it amen are you willing to put the key in the lock and unlock the presence of God in your life today amen amen that's what we've got to do we can find plenty of reasons why someone else impacted you I just recently last few days had a conversation sometimes these are a little straightforward God anoints that a young man offering a reason why he wasn't serving God right now then going back and his own self dissecting the things that brought him up to that place to make a decision one simple Crux if they're going to go to hell are you obligated to go with them straightforward enough for you that's how personal it is we had a bad pastor we had a bad experience we had a bad this a bad that got nothing to do with it it comes down to what is what are you going to unlock with the key that you've been given amen bitterness there all the time as we just said it's hiding in the house you can open that closet up your own self and sweep it clean amen let the light of the Gospel shine or you can justify that Spirit of bitterness living behind closed doors I think we have to have a change in our thinking we got a lot of reasons why we're bitter we got a lot of reasons why we're disappointed and we got a lot of reasons to give it all to Jesus and walk on you know have you been overwhelmed by the presence of God Amen now a lot of people will will say yes yes I spoke in tongues certainly we have nothing against that but that doesn't prove that you've had an experience that's right I won't go into it here but I'll tell you there's a very known uh minist in the United States in a big service there and all of a sudden he starts speaking in tongues and many people recognized it I don't remember now exactly the language they said oh that's this language well this man who was an interpreter for living interpreted what the minister was saying and it was something on the order of go go go away come again some other day and people are all like really does that edify the body of Christ the scripture says if it's spoke in an unknown tongue and there's no real true interpretation of it it brings confusion we don't want confusion my brother and sister we want the word pure straightforward unadulterated and Powerful amen we can get true truth my brother and sister that's so weak amen so brought down so Bas that it wouldn't deliver nothing and what people like that because they can find it in their Bible but it's not powerful enough to deliver them I want a word amen I believe you want a word that's powerful enough to drive the spirits out of the closet we want the word to come and speak to our hearts in such a fashion that we can then commit our life fully to that stand on that word and say you know what I shall not be moved but if it's that water down and weak you'll find it in scripture but you won't find it in power enough to deliver you don't want it my brother and sister if it's been watered down now so we experien these Heights that the Lord would take us and we've all kind of acknowledged that proving his word we've stepped out on the limb figuratively or out on the ice and and God's come and he's proved his word to us and I believe everyone that claims to be a Christian today needs to have that kind of experience where you can say God has proved his word to me I don't need anyone else I have a personal experience or relationship with the Lord and he's proved that he's real you see my brother and sister you're starting to see this I won't name it names or whatever but but if you do a little research you're starting to see different churches they're they're settling in they're being I think they call it woke and we need to be careful about that because uh we read a notice that our church had been censored because things preached here well I'll tell you what if it was the truth it'll still find its way out yeah amen I don't think we're allowed to say that c o v i d i f s f a l s e word what they do is they don't know what you're talking about but their little AI says we don't allow that that's like hate speech or uh disinformation well I tell you what disinformation they ought to censor is that water down stuff they call the gospel that's what they ought to censor but we know what their gospel is now let's look at this cover this in a sense we know the height of the experience that the Lord would take us to amen drag us out of alleys out of bars out of this out of drug deals you know needle tracks this that and the other and and Deliver Us from that we know where God will go to do this but I want you to understand understand just as it was with job you guys remember job amen we have to recognize just how far God is going to take us to perfect us job was already just and upright the Lord's already boasting of him but the Lord found one little Fleck and he said I'm going to burn that out of you job never told job that but that's what he was speaking and so the Trials come and and job faces that and in himself he he knows he's he's an upright man he's not quite understanding what's taking place uh why suddenly his world is turned up down upside down but you see God was showing how far he's willing to take even those that he claimed were like perfect and upright before him he says oh there's something there back to the furnace amen aren't you all excited about the furnace amen amen the Lord's going to take us where he needs to take us to prove his word amen he's not going to stop short because of your feelings okay I hope I don't hurt anybody's feelings this morning but I'm going to tell you right now God does not care about your feelings he cares about your position in his word amen which is is your position in him am that's what he cares about amen your feelings he'll rub a little savv on that later amen now job 19 23-27 he said oh this is job little later down the road oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pin and led in the rock forever for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God now look at verse 27 to me this is very Pro profound whom I shall see for myself yes amen not what the preacher told me not what this one said not what that one thought but to see it for himself amen for you and I to be able to see God in his majesty see him in his preeminence to see him in his glory and to know that when he took you back to the fiery furnace when he took you back to that and you were scraping your boils and when you were struggling and wondering why to know that God is so perfect that we can say Lord there has to be a reason and I'm going to be here to see the glory of the word manifested in me amen it's not then that it will be I'll go to church and the preacher will tell me why but you will see why for yourself and mine eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me my brother and sister are we there yet I'll just have to leave that question for you to answer but I have a sneaky little feeling if we can go by feelings we've got a few more trials coming we got a few more days that we question why we were born imagine a man such as job and his position his status and how people looked at him and how he served God and he gave and he helped and he did and then all of a sudden they're thinking is skewed a little bit and they're wondering does job have a secret sin and we literally could say yes he did you know what God says about you he's telling the devil today the per perfect amen they're upright they're righteous amen but I'll go ahead and let you pull the Hedge back 2024 God is still letting the devil pull the Hedge back because you see the Lord's not going to be satisfied until every bit of dross every bit of us has been burnt out of us amen and it sounds almost like God is cruel but God is love amen amen because to be perfect In His Image well that's self-explanatory we're going to have to be perfect and the word will bring us to that place amen and you know people think that Christians there's so many people think that Christians are just wimps it's so easy to serve the devil see how Satan even Twisted that one around oh you've got to be you've got to be weak to serve God no you got to be weak to serve the devil because you can just let go you know when we were kids I hope this little analogy fits when we were kids they don't allow it anymore but we used to swim in the lowline canal you know the one that runs out the bottom of Lake L we would swim in that and I I used to be I'd probably drown a quarter of the way across now but I used to be a good enough swimmer to climb in above the check and swim straight across the canal and climb out the other side now my brother and sister you would get there in the middle swimming for all your worth I mean all your worth and it's trying to sweep you Downstream and in your mind there was no pain you just went down through the check and got out below it but you'd swim for all your wor but there was something inside of you says I can do it and you just kept going your muscles are burning starting to hurt and then all of a sudden you realize it's getting a little simpler a little easier and finally you get to the other side now I don't make much of the fact that I was able to do that as a young man I was a scrawny little runt there wasn't a whole lot of me to propel across there but my brother and sister that same spirit is in you that when it seems like it's time to give up everything in your life says give up your circumstance says give up when your energy level is so low you thinking I can't go one step further I'm going to give up something inside of you says I can't yet I've got to keep going I've got to put there's more in me than I thought there was there's more of Christ in me than I realize I can't quit now do you know what I'm talking about amen and God is moving on this did you know that kind of spirit is contagious just as negative Spirits spirits of fear and anxiety doubts that they're all contagious like the flu and Faith while it's an individual event individual Affair it's contagious cold formal Contagious on fire contagious we got to decide Grace Tabernacle are we going to change our thinking or just settle into to a rut and call it good and say we did our best I don't think we've done our best I hope I'm not preaching too hard to anyone today but I don't believe we've done our best I believe there's more in us more of Christ in us to be expressed than we even realize and it's time for us to rise up to the occasion and turn Christ loose in us turn Christ loose in our church amen let it impact lives not just oh they're Christians but to the world to know they're different and I I've got over the point that it matters whether people think doesn't matter whether people think I'm weird or not because I know they're weird you see job come to that place he says whom I shall see for myself there's Revelation expressed right there in those words I will see him amen amen not hope to see him I will see him amen how glorious it is to be in his presence amen hallelujah now I'm not here to like boast because I was there but I tell you my brother and sister as I've shared with you through the years we have seen broken bones healed we have seen diseased eyes corrected we have seen all kinds of things the list could go on and on and on that we've seen and we allow the gospel the power of God to become so common to us that we just just go oh it ought to put us on fire it ought to put us to say if God healed that person he'll heal that one he'll heal that one and he'll Heal Me amen but the Devil comes and tones that so down that we don't want to just get too caught up or carried away it's time for us to change our thinking amen it's time for us to realize amen this world we live in according to scripture is cursed it's going to burn amen the world we live in also has toned that down that there's no hell and no real judgment my brother and sister that's not what my Bible says my Bible says there is a judgment amen and when we see the presence of God it's glorious I say it is glorious doesn't seem so glorious to get sent back to the furnace amen that doesn't seem so glorious in fact we often say what did I do wrong well it ain't what you did wrong it's what God's doing right in you amen we don't get the dross out of the gold by patting it on the back you pound on it you burn it amen how do you know when gold is hot enough when it starts to oxidize that means when the original content or structure starts to evaporate from the presence of heat can any of us say we've been that far in the furnace believe it or not some of you might be thinking nope nope I'm here to tell you yes yes yes yes because you see the dross of the old man is slowly going away slowly disappearing from our lives we're changed people amen oh so make mistakes isn't it interesting the devil likes to anoint people that Christians would not make mistakes when they see a mistake they must not be a Christian but I don't where let's go look at the track record of the Apostles none of them were real true Apostles Jesus was just making them happy by calling them his no my brother and sister every one of them had a flaw amen amen and God used him in spite of the flaw God used him even when the flaw was really obvious when Peter stood before the Lord and made the statements that he made Jesus rebukes him was the flaw fixed that day no but when he denied Christ something gripped him so strongly that he wept like he never wept before a changed man Grace Tabernacle do we want to be changed amen I kind of already touched this here I have another side note the Lord's not really concerned about our feelings he's concerned about our position what a paradox because we are very concerned about our feelings in fact many times we're less concerned about our position than we are our feelings in other words if we needed to protect something we wouldn't protect our position we would protect our feelings just absolutely contrary to what we really need in her life I feel I feel I feel instead of Lord where am I at and if I'm not in the right place Lord put me in the right place let my feelings go to this side I need my proper position in Jesus Christ but sometimes our feelings are Paramount they're right at the top and We complain about the furnace when we got it so backwards we should be saying Thank You Lord I'm delivered from my feelings that's right the furnace did its job and I'm so thankful but quite the opposite H I think there was a reason my brother and sister God Shadrach Meshach and Abednego never told him what was coming yeah so they're they're just worshiping they're not going to go back on the word they come to the furnace and how it must be that all the men throwing them in the furnace are dying from the heat but in the presence of the Flames it gave Liberty Amen to Shadrach and meach burnt the bonds off of them amen and there was Christ amen amen I'm telling you that be you'd have to be convinced you know when that big Burly kind of reminds me of the day and age we live in you know the the big Burly policeman you know little scrawny guy amen I seen a little news clip the other day it took three of them to drag a 98b girl away now my brother and sister you never know what the anointing was but that in my mind is a Shadrach and mhack moment they're Overkill they got these big Burly guys that work out and they're strong and you guys are going in the flame and next thing you know they're laying their dead and Shak mesach ior like what do we do for from here but there was always that one that's anointed to make sure you're going to land in the fire if it kills them and it does First Peter 17 says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perished though be tried with fire might be found into praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ see so we don't necessarily see here Saints what God is doing in our life some of this doesn't even really come out until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which means it should be showing because he's here that's right but sometimes what God did a fiery trial yesterday amen the fiery trial yesterday might not show you its fruit for a while but it will show you fruit [Music] amen now as we read in the quote there says we're way short of where we should be I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to stand before you and I'm going to lift my hand and tell you I recognize I'm way short amen of where I should be but I want the Lord to bring me where I should be I want to be who and what I'm supposed to be and I want you to do it sooner Lord that's right than later you see but the human element will cause us to pull back we as Christians have a choice to make we get run to the Lord or we get to run away from the Lord and so when we run away from the Lord we just get to face the trial again the Lord will just let you Gallop off into the desert and then you'll find a little nicer Trail than the one you was on a little nicer Trail than the one you was on until you realize you're right back where you started yeah oh and the nicer Trails always go downhill that's that's where nice Trails they're wide somebody else has taking all the stones out and they go downhill going to bring you right back where you were amen why run amen so what are we going to do well according to the word that I read says that we're going to confess what the word says are you going to confess the word amen it says that we're healed and delivered it says that we're Victorious amen hallelujah I love this when you come down Revelations 2 and 3 every one of those seven churches was focused to the Overcomer every one of them every one of them with reward Focus to the Overcomer amen amen what's the devil want to tell you wow that Overcomer things overrated no my brother and sister it's an ingredient that the word has placed that it is there to be an overcomer and you read for this age Overcomers amen I'm going to stand up even if I don't feel like it and say I'm an overcomer amen I've overcome sickness I've overcome every kind of sickness I've overcome everything that would hinder me I've overcome it you say okay if you overcome it where's it at I don't always know where it's at but I know it's in the word that's right and I know I'm a Son of God so therefore I know I have overcome that because he has already declared this is a finished work and in a finished work my brother and sister is no room for error hallelujah oh wait just a second I want I want to offer you an alternative we could confess our feelings yeah we could confess our feelings I don't feel yeah I didn't feel like you know what alarm clock went off this morning my feelings said I ain't doing it and then I remembered if I wasn't going to do it I needed to have called brother David earlier I know he gets up early but calling him at you know 4:49 to say I've decided I don't feel like preaching today yeah or feelings I don't mean to put sister Jerry under the bus but I've threw her there so many times she's very familiar with it if I only ate when sister Jerry felt like cooking I'd be skinnier than I am now I guarantee you but you know she doesn't go by feelings she fixes me a meal and sometimes they're just Grand sometimes not so but the point is see she's not being my wife by feelings right she's not taking care of me on her feelings amen she recognizes that she made a vow committed herself to that that's right I don't get up and go to work if I feel like it otherwise we would be living in a wore out camper trailer in some alley or back road or Canal bank CU I just don't feel like it anymore H I'm getting off Melancholy here so let's just stop see we don't confess our feelings I tell you what when we confess the word that's reality to the believer amen and the other one is a false reality of this age where grown men won't get out of bed and go to work their wives do amen where men have become sissies amen and their wives have become masculine or I should say just the woman maybe not their wife you see the whole shift of the dynamic my brother and sister and what we've got to do is make sure we don't allow that kind of thinking to come into our Christian experience amen where we come now let's type that feminine as the church where the church becomes dominant and we don't expect much out of Christ we don't expect much out of the word we don't expect deliverance from Spirit we don't expect healings we don't just our our young people are or maybe those that have already left we're not expecting them to come back well I'll tell you I got a brother good friend of mine that's a pastor of a church and you know there a lot of people was there they lamented for the longest time of how many young people had left their church over the years and went out in the world but I tell you what happened they found Revival in their church and their young people are coming back they're walking in the door they're not being wooed by some program they're walking in the door and saying I I realize I got to serve God but maybe they've been gone 10 12 15 years and in that time people tend to kind of give up God doesn't give up God says I'll let him go for a season the season will be the link that I determine it that's right and then they're coming back because I determined it amen well I think we as a church ought to have amen more faith in God we ought to have more trust in God because God God is in control not you and I oh this is a pastor's decision it's God's decision amen for the word to become reality oh sorry I didn't think I had enough to preach you're were right Jerry yeah I made a comment to her I just don't have much this morning and she's like don't say that first John 1 we'll be closing 1 John 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested I say amen and we have seen it amen and we bear witness amen and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us truly Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things write we unto you that your joyen amen this just not for the preacher to say boy I told them no my brother and sister this is so that the people can rejoice in the word rejoice in the liberty of being set free amen the chains are broken amen then this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie that's right and do not the truth amen but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ the his son cleanses us from all sin amen whoa did you see that yes sir you don't got to be super Christian you don't got to be super spiritual or super smart SM you just need to walk in the light amen amen oh I know it maybe isn't as easy as that sounded but if you would set your mind single-mindedly not on this challenge of life not on that challenge of life not on that challenge of life but saying here's the light I'm going to walk in the light and the light is going to cleanse me amen now think about medical science today my brother and sister they're using light bler yes sir to purify to cut to do all kinds of things light now we walk in the light my brother and sister well let me just go on here and if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US amen amen I would say today Lord help our unbelief amen that we could come here look a continued walk in the light is a continual cleansing that's right amen exactly got to look Beyond yourself that's right you got to look beyond what is your hangup that's it we got to have a change of our thinking well I'll tell you what I just can't live it I can't live it I'm going to quit because I can't live it you got a wrong Revelation it's not the right Revelation Satan anointing a person to say I I just can't live it I I have some things that just kind of keep popping up in my life I just can't live and I'm going to quit that's not what the word says word says just keep walking just keep walking Satan would anoint you say I can't do it the Holy Spirit anoint you just keep walking just keep walking but look I I have I have these failures just keep walking amen but but no just keep walking you know the church has two flaws we want to clean them before we catch them and after we catch them we think they should be perfect and someone somewhere said amen it's two flaws of the church you name the name of being a Christian there you are but here it says if we keep walking we'll be cleansed that means somewhere along the line they walk in the door an unbeliever God does an incredible work in their life we expect him from that day on to be perfect and God is saying you just keep walking in this light imagine how in our minds we think that a person would not be spiritual after 30 40 Years of serving God that they still maybe have a little thing in their life now we wouldn't go into what those things are but patience is one that comes to mind after 40 years a man should be so patient that you could just do anything to him and he would say thank you brother but instead you see the flicker in his eyes and realize that he's either going to strangle you or knock you over the hedge and therefore he's not saved without ever considering your part in that equation how easy it is is could we use a change in our thinking could we use a change that would come and say you know what brother I don't mean to be rude Sister Sister to Sister whatever her brother appropriately I see you're struggling I'm not here judgmental let's just keep it to brother to brother I see you're struggling I'm not here judgmental I'm here let me help you amen because as you are going forward I am going forward and we'll both be cleansed amen God working in the body amen a change of our thinking a judgmental pose that we take as I see sin in their own life but yet we fail as the scripture says to remove those things that we become so familiar with we think it's part of the landscape because we see it but you don't realize as you judge oh no no we won't be judged we're Believers yes you will be judged the word judges everyone and judgment's passed either now or there amen Lord pass it now amen let us yield to the word of God now amen you see because it's not our righteousness amen Pardon Me Maybe This is not for you maybe it's somewhere Over the Mountain but we get caught up in our righteousness somehow we judge ourselves deem ourselves just a little bit better than the next man without God's grace we are filthy rags have I been sufficiently honest this morning let's go to it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness because of time I want to skip forward musicians if you would come it's not that long we'll just read it Christ was God's testimony because God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself now he says suffer this to be so John that is right in other words John you're a mighty man you're a great Mighty prophet and your revelation of me is exactly the truth you know who I am you know because your ministry didn't come from man your ministry came from God you never learned it of man you wasn't taught this in a seminary but at the age of 9 years old you went out into the Wilderness because you were born in odd peculiar child who's nine around here who's close to nine around here Yan sorry to skip over yanessa but I don't see you going out in the wilderness imagine one of these boys 9 years old so-called of God anointed to go to the Wilderness and God turned him imagine all the things that he experienced coming up and he knew God was with him amen I'm going to include you Nessa you're right there you know it's [Music] God it's not an accident not a fluke not lucky but knowing it's God in your life knowing god is present and he's powerful and he would never lie to you and he gives you the strength to go in that Wilderness and come out as a mighty man you know who I am you know because your ministry didn't come from man your ministry came from God you never learned it of man you wasn't taught this in a seminary but at the age of 9 years old you went in the wilderness because you were born an odd peculiar child and from your very birth God began to to deal with you even before your birth the prophet saw you and you are a light of this day and in the wilderness you know who I am because God in the wilderness told you there would be a sign following me you've already bore witness of it you know it and we know who each other are we know each other and then it is true that you need to be baptized of me but let's suffer that to be so for John if we are the lights of of this day we must fulfill all righteousness now I don't mean to twist any words here but who could literally lift a hand and say I'm righteous see such a paradox we should everyone have our hand up but you see our flesh step to the Forefront and says no way no way but the word says that's right now are we going to listen to the word yes or our flesh amen oh my brother and sister let's go on here if you are the lights of this day we must fulfill all righteousness all God's word must be fulfilled by us for this day for it is becoming to us behooving it's becoming it's like us amen for if we are the true Witnesses of God today John we are the lights of this age and if we're the lights of this age there is so much scripture that's got to be fulfilled during this age and it's up to us oh my we're looking for a great spiritual man we're looking for a brother Donnie we're looking for a brother Tim we're looking for a brother whatever my brother and sister it's you and I that was called to fulfill this word it's not on their shoulders it's on our shoulders to fulfill this word it's on our shoulders to live it that's [Music] right it's up to us hallelujah it's up to us to see that all God's righteousness is fulfilled excuse me it's up to us to see that all God's righteousness is fulfilled and what is his [Music] righteousness we get the idea that I'm going to walk so Pious and so perfect and I'm going to be this and I'm going to be that and I'm going to be so patient and I'm going to be so kind no you're going to be his word amen that's right that's what you're going to be you're going to be his word and and the flesh well it'll still be there but the flesh is being changed amen amen little there you go Brother David little by little amen he changing hallelujah amen do we want to change in our thinking yes sir Lord help us Lord help us hallelujah hallelujah oh you know I tend to do songs has a little bit of how I feel coming up to when I study so if this seems like out of line I'm sorry but this is what I felt like when I was
