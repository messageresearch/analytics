like me is that my goodbyes from the crystal see that the bond stand in my whatever lighter four well I be can we say Amen tonight hallelujah just love the presence of the Lord Amen hallelujah I tell you what it does Saints when the presence of the Lord comes and moves right at the beginning of the service I'll just tell you it makes it so easy to preach I mean you can just pour your heart out because there's just I don't know there's just something already there so you know as you know sometimes I my calm my nerves I just reach up in the bookcase and I pull a book out and I just turned randomly to it you find that I'm a terribly random person yeah anyway I just want to share this I don't think that we need to put it up on the screen but in the message then Jesus came and called page 7 it be paragraph 46 if you want to read in front of it I encourage you to and behind it amen because you might say I'm cherry-picking a quote out of this but it was something that I picked the book up opened it and came right there a man I got to pick the fruit right off the tree that's right brother David amen so just beautiful because I just looked down on the page and here this was paragraph 46 he said maybe somebody said the church has been kind of dry for a while we haven't had a good fresh water for a few months we haven't had a revival looks like everybody is so stagnant or something another we just go to church and sing a hymn and hear a few messages go back but all of a sudden then we begin to get dry then Jesus comes on the scene freshens us up bring something new to us is always there to do that New Hope's come when Jesus comes in his presence brings new hope hey men aren't you so glad amen that's why we just always want to dwell in the presence of the Lord amen you know we don't this whole world just has a way of being a negative you know it might be as simple as opening up your bank statement and looking how small it is and it'll just have a dampening effect on you and then the devil will let you then go and open up the next bill and it's equal to your bank account amen and you go what am I going to do now Oh what am I going to do now well what we do now is say Lord you said you'd be my provider and I'm just trusting you Lord and it doesn't matter what the cares and the things of this world of this life have I'm trusting you Lord amen hallelujah I'd like to speak to you not tonight once again on preparations of the inner man god bless you thank you our musicians so blessed to have such a talented group amen hallelujah well I guess they don't think you're talented but anyway I'll say Amen for them amen hallelujah I'll forgive me I'm just in a good mood tonight amen just a lovely time to serve the Lord I want to speak to you tonight confidence in the finished work you know it's it's just something my brother and sister that God really wants to anchor in our soul we ever you know sometimes we find ourselves you know making little statements you're like why did I say that and maybe you know you'll be talking to somebody and you tell them something or you're asking them to do something and you will just say trust me it's interesting to see people's reactions when you say trust me some of them you can see that like mmm some not gonna happen some say I got enough confidence I'll trust you you realize we react that same way to God we act out what is actually going on inside of us my brother and sister it's it's the truth I mean we act out what is going on inside of us you know brother Brown said often time the minister preaches on the things that he's going through in his own life now it doesn't mean that the if the preacher is talking about fear and unbelief that he's got fear and unbelief but the devil's been bombarding him with fear and unbelief Amen and so then God anoints him to come and preach and somebody says well that was just for me well you see it was for the body hey man let's just stand and read the word tonight just to speak for a few minutes on confidence in the finished work we'll go to Psalms 118 starting with verse 8 and it's just to me this is such a lovely Psalms 118 just a lovely a bit of Scripture I always enjoy reading it and we're going to just pull out these scriptures for our thought tonight Psalms 118 and eight it is now this is not a question this is a statement it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in Princes all nation compassed me about but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them hey man this is not a son of God saying Lord if they'll just treat me okay a little bit of a truce we'll get along but this is God anointing David as he writes here that as the all nation can pass me about but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them they can pass me about yay they can pass me about but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them they can pass me about like bees they are quenched as the fire of thorns for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them Amen my brother and sister I don't care what it is that the devil's been bugging you with Amen you just have to stand on the word and in the name of the Lord I will destroy that whatever that spirit is whatever that circumstance is the word says whatever you bind on earth amen it doesn't say to the priests let him bind it go find a prophet let him bind it whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose will be loosed in heaven amen great authority has been given to the bride of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall but the Lord helped me the Lord is my strength and song and has become my salvation the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the Tabernacles of the righteous that means it's in you amen the right hand of the Lord doeth valent Lee the right hand of the Lord is exalted the right hand of the Lord doeth valent Lee I think he wanted to get these points I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord the Lord hath chastened me sore but he hath not given me over unto death open to me the gates of righteousness and I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou hast heard me and art become my salvation now my brother and sister I just got of several things I want to interact but I just want to speak this out right now amen I will praise thee for thou hast heard me for him to hear us we must speak we cannot say well you know I'm gonna let my pastor speak for me there comes a time even children cannot say all that mom and dad speak for me there comes a time that we as a church cannot say well we'll just let the prophets words speak for us there comes a time we meaning you and I have to speak this two builders refused it's become the headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it Heavenly Father we thank you for the opportunity to be for you tonight Lord for your grace your mercy your loving-kindness Lord how you come and would just open yourself to us father day by day a revelation of who you are being opened in the world we live in today Lord the blind cannot see it the Deaf cannot hear it Lord but sons and daughters of God that have been anointed by your word they both see and hear the revelation of Jesus Christ now or not here father just to be religious Lord we are not here tonight just to to make our presence known but Lord we're here tonight to hear from you and Lord you to speak to us personally father thank you for this opportunity in your precious name Amen you may be seated in verse 10 it says all nations can pass me about but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them you know brother and sister we have to make sure in the day that we're living that we we don't look or turn this back to flesh and blood we are not out as it were to destroy anyone but we are fighting against principalities and powers of darkness and if we are going to deal with the spirit my brother and sister the prophet of God was not hesitant to call out the spirits amen he didn't say well we'll kind of phrase it in such a way that it doesn't offend anyone here he called out the spirit he laid it out very clearly even to the point as I shared with you a while back calling out speaking these deals while I was speaking to brother so-and-so and he had committed adultery and I told him you're gonna have to repent from that now my brother and sister in the day and age we live in people would just flee from the church because they would say look he might call me out next and I'm just ain't gonna deal with it but the people should be crying out to God Lord all out my shortcoming call out my failures Lord I need this to be exposed goes totally against a human nature amen but we should be able to say thank you Lord that you love us so much that you would keep washing us with the water of the word amen now look I just want to tag this right to verse 11 you might be compassed about in the day that we live in all kinds of spirits but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them now my brother and sister it takes character to wield the sword of the Lord amen you cannot just go and and you know exhibit the nature of I'll just slash and hack and cut and you know if they're the bride they'll believe it that's not the way we present the gospel we present the gospel as a living God but a God that is also a God of judgment amen and so people make the decision themselves whether they want to face a loving God in grace and mercy or they want to face a God of judgment amen we are not there to set the stage for that but yet I'll just throw this out Jen the church and I'm going to extend that write down many of the problems we have on the message is weak pulpits men who will not stand up and speak the truth because they don't want to offend anyone in the church now I'm not talking about the mean guy that just picks on people and beats on people but my brother and sister we need to be lifting up I don't say this for my sake I you can name any amount of brothers you want point north-south-east-west we need to be lifting up the ministry that the time goes on that there isn't a political correctness comes into the message that controls the pulpit it's already enough of that we need men they're going to stand up and they're going to tell the truth and that truth my brother and sister the word says will set us free amen so we want free we need to have a good strong ministry but my brother and sister the prophet of God said that you as a congregation as the people actually operate the gift in the man in the pulpit so we need a good strong church amen we need a people that are willing to sacrifice a little time of their life a little effort to lift up to pray for encourage and support you know I've been really enjoying the little what you call it oh my my mind just fled what's up you know that you know I've been enjoying that because Saints you've been encouraging each other I don't always respond to them you know we'll be working I have grease on my hands I hear the phone ding you know curiosity just kills the cat doesn't it what is that ding but you know sometimes I'll fumble around there and get that and I'll see you guys encouraging each other for birthdays and for prayers and prayer requests and blessings of God I think this is good we need this kind of interaction in a body amen not a bunch of distant strangers coming into a building trying to worship together but sons and daughters of God a body the scripture says that is knit together hallelujah and so you know it's there that we realize the Lord is my strength and my song and is become my salvation now you look and see what God has done in our lives if we would just unwind our lives for a moment you might say the film of our life and realize that the Lord has not left us powerless amen we are not what we were a year ago five years ago 10 years ago the Lord's giving us confidence amen he has become our strength but that's strength my brother and sister is being manifested through you and I amen God didn't say okay usually set there is a weakling and I'll come along but he said I want you to be in the word amen because if you're in the word you can't be deceived amen if you're in the word you're fortified you're in the word you are built up amen and he wants you to be built up amen I was reading a little book and it was talking about this man he was still a soldier in his fleece and he was just they they described him as hard as a rock and stronger than most young men well how he did that as a soldier my brother and sister is he continually fortified himself he continually you might say exercise and it wasn't merely an exercise of the muscles but it's also an exercise you might say of the brain amen and also he had a great heart to serve his country and now as you look at that my brother and sister we sons and daughters of God as time goes on and we have fought battle after battle after battle we should not be getting weaker we should be getting stronger hey man we should not be looking for a shortcut but we should be looking for the way that the Lord sends us if he sends us straight in the face of the enemy to do battle then we should say the Lord has prepared me for this battle and I am Not Afraid amen and so we must remain fortified in the Word of God now being fortified in the Word of God I mentioned because the Prophet mentions it it's not about just being deceived my brother and sister because the word shows us that this work he began in you will not falter it will not fail it will not be incomplete he said I will finish it amen and so you look at that we're not in the word just because we're afraid to be deceived but we're in the word because he need to function amen so as we look at this we press into the word and he certainly becomes our strength and he becomes our song and is become my salvation now I'm not going to interpret this but I'll tell you when you look at that and say become my salvation we recognize that we were saved before the foundation of the world God called us before the foundation but my brother and sister when it becomes a salvation and we recognize who we are in Jesus Christ that is as the song says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous do what run into it they don't crawl they don't wait they don't yet they run into it amen and so then the Lord becomes our salvation which is our sanctuary amen so that's our dwelling place that we want to be it's our heart's desire not just on Sunday not just on Wednesday but every day of the week amen hallelujah you know for a man to say I shall not die but live the world eternal nature amen because we have the nature of God in us we have been become of an eternal nature amen so it's there that the word has rejuvenated or brought to life the seed that was planted amen no I like this now to really focus for a minute if you don't mind on verse 18 amen so you look at this and realize my brother and sister how God works and we'll we'll just look now amen so the LORD hath chasing me sore what happened to the believer the true believer he pouted he ran away no sir he chastened me sore because that's I love I chasing if we are never I want to reverse this Amen I want to reverse the polarity tonight if we are never chastened it's the opposite of what Satan tries to get us to face Satan says man they are ripping your hide and they got no right to do that while they're picking on you that was pointed hmm stop reverse the polarity if you're never chastened you are not a son daughter well unless of course we're already perfect shut up Paul they're like you but they ain't you and if you ask them they'll tell you they'll give you a good insight into how perfect they are but my brother and sister I'd rather be chasing so that I quit mumbling and bumbling about you know kind of trying to quote it from memory but the prophet of God was talking about South somebody tried to correct him and he said nope not going there I'm gonna let the Lord correct me amen so in other words this was could be someone's opinion but if God corrected him he knew he needed to change amen if you can understand what I'm saying there so he says here the Lord had chasing me sore but he hath not given me over unto death now my brother and sister God can whoop the hide right off of us Amen and we'll feel like that we are just right down at the dirt level if that's a good acceptable phrase we feel like we were just well low as dirt but you see if God ever let go of you you would be lower than dirt but God said it says here never let go of you amen he kept a hold of you he never gave you over unto death he might have just whipped you and whipped you hard and we as humans don't like that right and now I'll put the other angle of it just in the very nature of humanity we don't like to be whipped but one of the things that bothers us almost as much as if feather people know we're being whipped that's called pride that's called pride when we look out and say you know it's like oh they know they know they know God's whipping me and it hurts so bad I mean I'm not talking about the Lord is it hurts my pride so bad we ought to be doing this rejoicing yes imagine if we could get so filled with the Holy Ghost the Lord would be just whooping on brother Trevor and we'd become an over old brother Trevor praise the Lord God just whippin the hide off of you why because I know I know if I'm a witness to him being whipped I know God loves him it's exactly the opposite of our human thinking amen then you can say I know God loves my brother Trevor and I'm not saying he's been being whipped on so well are you but look my brother and sister you see because he chasing a sword sore here sword did I say sore amen but he hasn't given us up he hasn't given up on us I say thank you Lord I'll accept Lord I'll accept the chastening Lord please just don't let go of me hallelujah oh and we know he won't hallelujah oh my I'll tell ya that's a wonderful thing amen verse 23 I thought was also very wonderful of this scripture as I read it's kind of just well the Lord does stuff like that no big deal no my brother and sister let it never cease to be marvelous in our eyes amen the simplest things of God that he does for us let it never cease to be marvelous people might think you're crazy when you say you know what I prayed about something last and I got up this morning you know I'm gonna tell I'm gonna pick on brother Trevor said okay brother Trevor Amen brother Trevor one time went to I don't know a second-hand store or something furniture store whatever and brother Trevor sits down in a recliner and he likes that recliner and whatever the circumstance was he got up and left that day didn't buy that recliner but his pickup keys disappeared amen and so brother Trevor looks high and low correct me if I get this wrong brother Trevor but he looks his keys amen and so what for two weeks amen and then one day whatever the inspiration is we know what the inspiration was he goes back to look at that recliner again and he sits down in the chair he'd ask the church to print in two weeks before and he's sitting there and he see it feels something there and he pulls out his keys now my brother and sister you tell me God does not care about us tell me that the simple things of life that God does not anoint him to go right back to that very chair to do that did you buy the chair yeah yeah see he didn't even buy the chair so what was it it was the Holy Ghost led him right back what was it the answer to prayer but it might have been the idea that I I really like this chair I'd like to buy this chair but this chair is expensive and I'm gonna go sit in it one more time and God says no you're gonna go sit in a more time because I'm answering your prayer amen I'll tell you my brother tell me God don't hear our cry tell me God doesn't come in the simple things hallelujah some people would say well he was lucky yeah well I'd rather be blessed and lucky hallelujah amen so as we look at this we realize that everything God does for his bride should be marvelous in her eyes oh my my my my my amen well this is a day which the LORD hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it hallelujah I don't know some days they don't feel like they're real blessed days right amen the wheels fall off the wagon this goes wrong that goes wrong but we need to stop look back to the scripture and say you know what this is a day that the Lord hath made he knew what would be in my life today and I say thank you lord I will come out of this day victorious hallelujah hallelujah now as we're talking this evening for a few minutes I've already burnt up most of those few minutes but we have confidence in the finished work now my brother and sister when you have confidence in something you you cannot have a partial trust you have to as we would look at this a partial trust versus a complete trust as I was speaking earlier you know if you speak to someone trust me now they're going to be very prone to trust you if you are proven Amen if your proven article if you you have something they can trust in amen so partial trust means I will trust you so far you know it depends on what you're doing you say well you know I'll Drive you down to the ice-cream shop you know ride with me trust me well you know if it's only two blocks away they might calculate in their mind the odds of surviving that ride they might not want to drive across the country with you though amen so partial and complete trust right simple analogy but it's there my brother and sister what happens is is if we have a partial trust in God we have a point that will trust God so far we would trust God to to work certain things out for us now I hope I don't speak out of line this evening but my brother and sister our brother Tim we see the witness of him being here tonight now brother Tim said please pray because I didn't come out here to to miss all these services because I have to work and so I want God to change his schedule and we stood right here in the four-year of this church and he said well I don't just want God to change that my schedule I don't know if you remember the words you spoke brother Tim he said God will change my schedule amen what is this this is not a partial trust like I'm hoping but he's speaking this saying I believe I'm declaring I'm trusting God will hear my cry and honor what I desire and that's to be in the house of the God now you know if it's like Lord I need you to change my schedule so I can be on the bowling league on Wednesday night well my brother and sister I don't know whether that prayer will come to pass or not hey man it might be just as a test you know hallelujah because Allah Lord will chasten you sore yep hallelujah reminds me of a guy years ago he's a denominational man but he skipped church to go bowling and forgot his ball borrowed else's ball it stuck on his fingers let go of it broke two of his fingers hallelujah you know what his wife told him we don't even go there yeah yep yeah I think she said something to him on the order of you have to clap really hard to break them fingers in church hallelujah what is faith a complete trust or confidence now if something my brother and sister is complete that means it is finished hallelujah now let's just put on the whole armor of God here for just a few minutes amen and so Paul here is speaking of a soldier dressing going to war a soldier getting himself in armor preparing for a battle and I kind of I kind of like the way that he places it preparation you know I believe it was Lincoln that said one time in the time of peace prepare for war or it might not have been he but it sounds like seize me rather that it was he that made that statement in time of peace prepare for war now my brother and sister went all's well in your house we don't quit praying we don't quit reading our Bible we don't quit listening the Prophet we don't quit going to church because hey everything's going good right in the time of peace we prepare ourself for war hallelujah amen yeah that would be a good thing for us to think about in time while everything is running smooth you berry long you're in a convention now and everything will just pour along fine but you're going to leave here in a few days and you're going to meet the enemy he might not even wait till you get ready to leave he might attack any time he so he's wicked and ruthless he just carries on whenever he can whatever he can say or do he does it right now he so it's best to be dressed all the time amen you might meet him on the street you might meet him in your car in the car hard telling where you meet him or he will meet you right in the seat there and me right here in the pulpit here anywhere he just wicked and he doesn't care so we want to be prepared for it and this great teacher st. Paul was teaching the church how to put on the armor and he was likening to a soldier getting ready for a great battle ahead now we find out about in nations that there is many times that nations no matter whether they're friendly are not friendly each nation has its spies now we have our spies all over the world every nation in the world has their spies here whether they're friendly or not friendly amen let's just proceed that forward please and they're kind of a little suspicious you know now England is one of our sister nations but yet we got spies in England England's got spies here we have them everywhere yet so they make their rounds and they're friendly nice people but there's really really nothing that you can say against them but they're just on the alert watching see what's going on and watching for some new weapon that's going to be developed and they'll slip right in and see how that weapon is and then they'll send it to their own country and they'll prepare for the counter-attack whether if we use this weapon why they could counter-attack it to us or if we should use their weapon or they use their weapon on us our spies and we'll build some weapon to combat the weapons that they're planning on using or some secret secret service or some secret thing they're planning we are planning on doing and they'll make ready because they got spies here for that purpose to spy and see what we're doing we got spies they're spying out see what they're doing seems like we just can't really trust one another I hope you catch this in the spirit that brother Branham was preaching it just it just looks like there's something in human beings that just goes so far Wow and that's all the farther it can go and I'm glad there's something we can put complete trust in aren't you something that's we don't have to wonder think about just know that we could just rest like little children I think that's the way we should be especially Christians we should be like in the beginning you notice man is trying to find that place because when he was first made in the image of God he didn't have to shift for himself and God taken care of him but since he become an alien a wonder then he has to shift for himself and he's suspicious of spooky everything looks a little leery he's gone he don't want to wait for you now my brother and sister the reason that I bring this quote to you is that when we come to a place that the moving of the Holy Spirit comes and we don't have a complete trust in God we cannot open ourself and say Lord here am i we start to guard ourselves we start to say well I get nervous about this when people start shouting and people start hollering and people start speaking in tongues you know I remember one time we had a brother when we were down by the post office visiting the church he was speaking in tongues and and most of the church just was just their mouth was their jaw was slack and they were just like what's going on you see my brother and sister we've got to come to the place we have complete trust in God amen the scripture says the heart is deceitful so we can't trust the heart Amen it says that man has been an is an alien from God though we you can't trust the man but we've got to come to the place that there is so much of the word which is God right John 1 so much of the word in us that when we here the word the wording us can respond to the word that is spoken amen we people say well that's good we trust but verify well if we are studying the Word of God amen a brother from Canada I won't name his name tonight I have from the pulpit before but you know he's preaches and he'll just tell you no I'm not going to give you quotes I'm not to give you all of this stuff because if you are in the message like you should be in the message you will know whether I'm telling you the truth or not now people don't like that right because they don't know whether to say Amen or not and last brother Branham said it out we need to be in the word so far that we can trust it because we know it's the word that we can understand what is being spoken because that is the word Amen that is God Himself speaking to us and so we come into this place my brother and sister that if we do not have complete trust or confidence then we will hold back and I believe as brother Branham talks about the moving of the supernatural coming to that presence where the veil is right there and he talks about our paraphrases he says we'll come right up to that veil but we're afraid to go beyond it all my brother and sister we shouldn't be afraid to go beyond the veil we should long to go beyond the veil it should be at the very heart desire it should be the very thing that we're searching for is to get beyond the veil into the presence of Almighty God hallelujah oh and I would just speak to you here from this now and look at this the Church of the Living God amen now the prophet of God this is a prayer line this is something that he is speaking over an individual once again it's right here if you don't have notes you can obviously go to the to the recording of it and get this but brother Branham is now talking to an individual that has a need needs healing and he says if I can only get you to believe but you see he can't he's not gonna talk to him for two or three hours convince them he's not going to twist their arm he's not going to bribe them he's not going to threaten them he says if I can only get you to believe it's going to leave you if I can't it can hold you amen now it lays in your faith in the finished work at Calvary it in other words if you take what Webster says it lies in your confidence in the finished work of Calvary amen at Calvary do you believe that God can that God sent Jesus and he died for your healing all right sister your confidence has saved you now hey man I want to read it correct so nobody say I'm twisting it your faith has saved now you see she had to declare emphatically I believe this not I believe this if or I believe this as if I can get you to believe it we'll leave and there was something inside of her that says I believe this and I believe as I believe then it will leave me amen your faith has saved you now it's stopped audience come here Billy all right you can go off the platform be made well sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ your faith your confidence in God oh my brother and sister remember brother Brown talked about you know that that Oral Roberts you know would on the radio or television would talk about being a point of contact you notice brother Branham never never disputes that never rebukes and in fact he acknowledges that and speaks of people would view it but my brother and sister the prophet of God became a point of contact this woman who needed healing she needed something to change in her life amen if she could have just got that anywhere she could have went to any Church any pastor any individual but brother Branham became that point of contact that he puts that right before her and that presence of God that beautiful wonderful Spirit of God the Holy Ghost come right down there and in her and she knew that was the truth and her faith said amen to the word amen and it left her and her faith made her whole my brother and sister you see people get caught up in these things and and it will be their one encourage one can one help one can one say the right words as anointed by the Holy Ghost can one offer to pray for you can one come and you might say confront you in the fact that would say you need prayer and we're willing to pray for you God works in those ways my brother and sister but it's the faith in the Word of God God Almighty Amen John one their faith in the word of God is what moves mountains it's not faith in the preacher not faith in the church amen so you look at that you see now it lays in your faith in the finished work at Calvary oh my you realize what's laying inside of you Amen what lays inside of you we'll put the Word of God to work what lays inside of you will bring to pass the very word of God for this hour amen it lays inside of us it's already here right the prophet of God said everything you need to make the rapture is already inside of you what is the word doing it's unlocking it unlocking at a key a door you might say at a time getting a little deeper down into the soul the Spirit of the Lord invading you oh look at it hey man he's picking the lock no you've got to invite him in it's the lock and sneak in like a thief he wants to be invited Lord the doors open oh can we lift a hand tonight Lord the door is open come in Lord I'm inviting you in I don't need you to sneak in I want you to come in the door is open the front door is open the living room door is open the kitchen door is open every door in my house is open but the only way she we can allow that to happen is if we have complete trust anything short of complete trust now I don't want to get personal but it will be personal you got something in your life that you're hiding you're gonna lock that door you're gonna guard that door you're not gonna let him in that door and you think he don't know that come on it's time for us to have complete trust complete trust says no matter what has happened in my life no matter what I'm going through no matter the circumstances of it Lord the door is open come Lord amen reminds me of a minister once he said I sometimes question whether people want delivered or not and same Minister says there was a time an individual come right here to the platform I leaned over the rail and I was praying for him and I spoke he spoke he says I spoke these words to him in the man denied it and the Holy Ghost called him right there and said you're lying to my servant you talk now whole church hears the fact the man lies to the minister and gets called for it now if you're guarding it enough to lie you would think that would cause you to be angry well what happens the man realizes it was God that called him out not the preacher and he repents Life delivered amen repentance brings life Oh hallelujah look I'm not saying somebody's got hidden saying don't misunderstand on fidence in God I'm talking about us trust in him so much that if he calls us to the carpet we say Lord forgive me chasing me sorry Lord just don't let go of me hallelujah amen because my brother and sister it's that confidence in the word that puts it to work in us hey Ben now look at this hallelujah now Hebrews 3 and 14 amen for we are made partakers of christ if and to the end not very sweetness of the holy spirit when God called us we knew that we weren't of this world we knew we weren't the chicken hey man we knew we were an eagle if we can keep ahold of that does it say keep old so that promise no it says confidence you see there's got to be a point that we recognize I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God and I don't care who or what devil says I am NOT I believe with every fiber of my being I am a son or daughter of God see you got to hold on to that confidence because if the devil starts to these things went sideways people that I knew people that I was well acquainted with ministers that had invited me to preach for them and they started making little statements well I don't know what brother Brown said here if I can believe that okay you know I am a fairly open guy to ideas honest you don't believe what brother Brown said right there that's good because he did speak it in a different way over here and so if you don't like the words here I could have grace for that but over here he uses Scripture and he ties it right back when you deny this it's not just words it's doubt it's fear it's unbelief so I'm actually I'm pretty pretty huh I don't like the word but I'll just use it I'm pretty liberal you can tell can't you but my brother and sister you ever see an individual whose confidence in God is waning you might as well write him a card who is good to know you because they will be gone hmm we won't get into that tonight because it take us in another direction amen what the prophet of God said about those spirits of those people who couldn't believe and then he says they have a religious spirit yeah so when they leave God it doesn't mean they just left God Lord Lord didn't we do many mighty works in your name no I didn't know I don't remember you I don't know you hmm you see they didn't leave religion they left God so Saints keep lots of that pulse of that confidence amen keep a hold to that you fall on your face you got mud on your face you look in the mirror and say oh my goodness what has happened to me I got mud on my face stand up say I'm a daughter of God I'm a son of God it doesn't matter about the mud amen the word will wash that off of me a man who doesn't matter about all these circumstances around me God will take care of that Oh I you know I got whipped in school you know I had a principal unfortunately from the third grade all the way to the ninth grade and well technically the tenth grade same guy kept following me around hey men this is a man that four things I didn't even do I say this a little bit humor but it's the truth this is a man the nature of it he was like Paul he said and it's like okay sir I'll go into his office one time something I never even did I won't go into it's kind of a disgusting thing that somebody and I just simply laughed I thought it was funny it was right in the class happened right there I laughed my head off the teacher says go to the office I go to the office principal says well Paul you shouldn't laugh and I said sir is there something against the rules about laughing he says well and you know laughing at the wrong time is is bad and they so he says hey did you know it was it was his like 58th birthday he says you know it's my birthday and I was like no I didn't sir and he says what get a plate right there and a fork and and there's some punch and get you a big piece of cake I'm like whoa my lucky time I sat there in his office I drank punch I ate this huge piece of cake and I took the last bite of cake he says grab the doorknob whoa what and he goes you didn't think you were getting off did you I was like this isn't fair he said I don't remember bringing up the word fair in our conversation and he hit me two times and then he said and here's the price for not telling your parents and hit me so hard it lifted my feet off the floor oh I had to go find me the back side of the restroom somewhere and cry cuz it hurts so bad but you know what I never did after that I never laughed in class now the Lord you might think has whipped you unnecessarily but I'm telling you if he needs to teach you a lesson say Lord whatever that lesson is let me receive it hallelujah now I when I say I never laughed in class I laughed in class when it was appropriate amen amen hallelujah well I hope I'm making sense tonight I haven't lost you out in the woods have I now Hebrews 10 let's look at this as we just move here to finish Hebrews 10:35 he says cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward so what the devil's actually coming down my brother and sister then I'll just gonna be blunt tonight he might not cause our sisters to cut her hair dress wrong he might not cause a brother out and do this and do that wrong but if he can steal our confidence in God if he can come down to where we pray but we don't really expect it to be answered we pray for others and we don't expect it to be answered we look at this and we say well Lord I know I've got shortcomings but you know please forgive me and there's just simply a complete sense of utter despair of seeing some change or result my brother and sister Satan's good at it you know there's two times the Satan really really works on individual when he's first saved he keeps them there ain't no way ain't no way ain't no way you what you've got is just nonsense and then he also works on the seasoned believer who has been serving God for so long but has become weary in well-doing they have prayed many a prayer maybe prayed prayers for their children prayed prayers for different things and they don't feel like God is hearing their prayer then they get into a certain state you might say of despair and their confidence and it comes that it comes to a place they quit praying they don't believe God's gonna even answer their prayers so they quit pray I remember a brother one time we went to his house sitting there waiting you know and when I say brother this man still profess to believe the message and we're sitting there and I was hungry and I'm school they're gonna feed us everybody's chattering and doing and and then I look around and everybody's eating I was stunned I wasn't even really a believer at the time but I was stunned look Saints I was back slidden and I was stunned they didn't even bless the food and I asked another brother that was in slightly better spiritual condition than me but not much I said what was it deal with him he said oh he that he still believes the message but he doesn't believe God hears his prayers so why what's the food that's pretty far down the slippery slope Saints well what's happened his confidence went away he no had no more confidence it wasn't long after that I actually moved the hoe started seeing sister Jerry and life went on that way wasn't long after that he divorced his wife took up with his secretary and went and went on and what my brother's sister you you can't throw your confidence amen cast not away therefore your confidence the devil actually didn't steal it from him I wished I had something the devil didn't come and pickpocket here he himself cast his confidence in God away oh lord help us Oh says our confidence is a great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God you might receive the promise o my Saints we may be praying for things for years what we should include in that prayer is Lord my patience help me to be patient I'm holding on to this confidence Lord and I will not cast it away I believe you Lord you're my healer you're my Savior you're my provider amen for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith amen the jaw shall live by their confidence in God amen but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not Oh hallelujah I this we are not of them who draw back hallelujah I think we ought to speak it out of our mouth sorry about being presumptuous but you ought to either here in your bedroom in your car whatever you ought to declare to the world to yourself to God Amen we are not of them who draw back into perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the oh my brother and sister sometimes Amen sometimes you know I just share this little story I love military history sisters who don't mean to put her on the spot but she's bought me a lot of birthday presents through the years a lot of books amen I love reading them sometimes you know after years go by pick it up it's like a new book again you know and one time these soldiers were marching it was difficult situation the mud and they were tired and they had been in warfare and and they were going along and the sergeant was behind this whole group of soldiers here they were bloodied they'd been in the battle they were dirty hungry and whatever and they're going along and there were several soldiers that were laboring and laboring and the sergeant behind the whole group saying you can do it you can do it keep walking you can do it and so this soldier when they got to the place that they were supposed to go this soldier goes over to the sergeant and he says sir thank you for the encouragement and the sergeant looks at him with a blank look and he said I was talking to myself come on Saints amen don't keep it to yourself if you need a little bit you can do it you can do it you can do it while you're encouraging yourself you might be encouraging the brother or sister that's close to you we can do it Saints amen if the rapture doesn't come for 15 or 20 years you had a funeral here you buried brother Paul someone else is a pastor here keep telling yourself we can do it hey man don't get tired don't get weary amen but we are not to draw back but we're of them that believe to the saving of the soul hallelujah this work he began in you and I my brother and sister he will finish Oh hallelujah oh my I love that scriptures I read that I just I just saw hallelujah the just shall live by confidence in God confidence in His Word hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah okay I've got a couple more quotes here just to make a point I'll try to just hurry real quick through them here amen last evening while speaking on marking of the beast or the seal of the beast we call it because it's called the seal of God we find out that the seal of the beast is the seal stands for a finished work the opening of the seventh seal was a revelation of a finished work to the Bride of Christ many people say oh yes it's done he said it at Calvary my brother's sister that's just quoting of Scripture anybody can quote that but for a real revelation to drop down into the all of the real revelation of Jesus Christ it takes the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen the seal stands for a finished work for anything that's finished it's it's sealed the car is talking to you look up into the rest of this quote when you go study it you'll see what he's talking about using a railroad car the car when it's loaded perfectly loaded the inspector has to come by first loading lumber or whatever it is on the car then the inspector comes by and looks it all over and if the cars been rolled up the side track that here to be loaded up the inspector shakes everything to see if it's good and solid then after he finds out that everything is solid it pulls the door together and seals it and it's sealed to its destination that's the way the Holy Spirit does us comes around ha ha hallelujah do you like this come on come on somebody lift their hand and say shake me Lord shake me Lord hey man I don't want to fall apart right on the last few steps of this journey shake me Lord hallelujah hey man that's the way the Holy Spirit does us come around and shakes down a few things that's loose in the church loose in the individual just a little reckless living the things that we ought not do the little things that's wrong with us God comes around it shakes them first to see if you're solid on the word see if you're eligible as a child or servant of God to carry on after he finds out that everything's solid then the doors closed and your seal Oh hallelujah oh don't you love that God comes shake us God comes shake grace Tabernacle amen let it be anything that can be shaken let it be shaken hallelujah don't resist it amen don't don't don't lock up the door amen oh there's nothing behind this door why is it got ten padlocks on it that's nothing it's nothing hmm okay God's aren't going to come in there with a bolt cutter it's not going to come in there with a chainsaw amen he's going to wait till you get so tired of being chasing and that you're gonna go find them keys and you're going to start unlock you know it might take a series of time might take a span would forgive me come down to maybe things that that are real personal those might be a little harder but I'm telling you sons and daughters of God will be anointed to open that door and say Lord come in and clean this clean this Lord on you to clean this I want to be washed by the water of the word hallelujah that's why my brother and sister you don't have to fight with them you you don't have to try and get them to see this and see that you don't have to push you don't have to beg them when they want to be washed Oh imagine if we could in the natural it would be a natural example we would walk in the door of the church and we'd be saying hallelujah watch me watch me watch me people see what's wrong with that guy what's wrong with that woman amen he'd be in here wash me Lord but that's the hearts cry of a real son or daughter of God they are constantly saying Lord watch me watch me watch me amen because there you can't even walk in this world we live in today my brother and sister you know I I just you know a minister brother many years ago said he's is in in Walmart in their town late night they had forgot they needed something and and he's following his wife through this store his wife was walking with purpose and she's walking through the store and and he says you know you walk into Walmart he said you know you've got a you got a it's not just a simple thing to go to Walmart you've got to look at how many ceiling tiles or how many floor tiles it is to come down here let's see our one on one 24 25 26 27 right turn Hey he said please you can't look around you it's summertime in our city you can't look around you but he said it's pretty funny story to me sorry I do have a warped sense of humor nobody said he was following his wife through Walmart and these two young girls he said very worldly girls and when the brother's wife walked by they were pointing giggling snickering pointing at her the sister very godly sister and the one girl sorry I have this warped sense of humor sorry the rest of you how young are going to hear this but he said ah it was a little humorous this one girl's looking back snickering his wife said something about being a Holy Roller when the religious runs right into that one of them big support pipes in the middle store he said I couldn't help but think it was a little bit humorous my brother and sister amen God's going to shake us are we ashamed Saints to be who we are if we're ashamed to be who we are we're gonna get shaken some more hey say God shake us no let us be ashamed of who we are it's a privilege that God said I'm gonna give you the word back open it to you put a desire in your heart to want to take the pure word amen that's a that's a privilege that's a blessing hallelujah hallelu now look how just one one more quick quote sister Emmy amen in the Seventh Seal but if you'll read Ephesians 4:30 it says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day you of your Redemption yes sir when the mediatorial work is done and your Christ comes to redeem his own you are sealed not until the next revival when your one filled with the Holy Ghost it's a finished work that God has received you and there's no getting away from it hallelujah reminds me of a brother told me one time he said brother Paul he said I was raised in the message we got kind of comparing testimonies he said I was raised in the message and he said I wished I had a testimony like yours he said but I went out and he said I had many girlfriends a lot of liquor a lot of drugs a lot of things happened in my life and he said I ran fast and I ran far and when I got to the other end Christ was standing there waiting for me think about it how far we could run how fast we could run but if we have been called by God amen you can't get away from it oh and we ought to be thanking him for that too hallelujah you say well I had it and I went away no you didn't have it see you can't say you got the Holy Ghost you've got God himself deny his word and walk away from that that shows you never had him you don't find God and lose him amen God said it goes to the day of redemption now you just argue with him I like that line you know like that it's argue with him amen you see what it meaning till the day of your Redemption isn't it good to have confidence in gone amen to trust him trust his word trust the life he has poured into you and I hallelujah amen just move forward Saints just have confidence we're not called to be under the spirit of fear and then I kind of skipped over because I kind of got away from my notes there but my brother and sister you see when when God calls you when God lays down this foundation there comes a time my brother and sister you you can battle against anything and everything around you but if you sit down and say you know what Lord I believe your word not a drawn-out complicated well this scripture goes to this and the quote goes to here and that fit over here to just simply set down and say Lord I believe your word it'll go a long ways to change in our lives amen it'll go a long way is the Holy Ghost and I'm welcome in that house and you know what the Holy Ghost then comes in and starts sweeping now I ever notice that sisters how sisters are meant men are just not the same way we'll start with the men first so you'll understand what I'm saying you have a brother walk into another brothers garage start saying I don't like the way you've got your tools hung up I'm gonna I'm gonna clean your bench for you a brother would be saying I can handle that myself if you please just move away but you ever notice how sisters can come in and they'll be dishes in the sink and they'll just walk right up there notice start washing dishes and the sisters say oh they go in the second cabinet on the left but we men how dare you touch my no I mean my tools how dare you you ever noticed now I've got a point behind this and I don't hope sisters won't change because I bring this point out you ever noticed how sisters will set among sisters and they'll start to say well the slow things been bothering me but men brother how you doing everything's fine what's that go up go up behind you I can't I can't hardly hear you because the glub glub oh it's nothing just my boat sinking now i'ma drop the grenade oh if you ever find a sister with a heart spirit she'll be hard than the hardest it's the truth you know that represents the wife the church a church that ever gets hard on God will be hard let me rephrase that a message church that's hard on God will be harder than the denomination [Music] see you can't come into that experience and have that given to you and hold it back and expect God to disco all your fine heel chases your correct is church grace us have confidence in God let's trust him for everything pour your heart out too if you want to share it with the preacher share with the preacher but you don't need to share it with the preacher of the Prophet said so Amen you got an altar you've got a God whatever the need is just trust him trust him like you've never trusted him before we are overcomers hallelujah we are overcomers do we believe that amen we're not just here to exist we are conquerors in fact more than conquerors hallelujah amen so if I read that to you this evening I hope this now really makes sense to you amen because you see my brother and sister the Lord we can get pretty dry we can get pretty dry but God is faithful to us and he will come and bring revival in our midst and bring us to a place that were once again wedded up washed by the spirit of the word oh they love the Lord tonight hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen brother Jason if you had helped me please I like to sing that reaching up to you dear Lord amen I pray that be each one of our prayer tonight I'm

of interpreting service and a complimented him and it turns out that our brother Jose up in Kennewick Washington was also just a tremendous interpreter translator of the preaching it is his niece and
