[21:26] we will definitely be praying for you
[21:31] so for each one a lot of sickness in our
[21:34] midst
[21:35] I say this jokingly but it might have
[21:38] been a good weekend for us to be away
[21:40] whatever has passed through the church
[21:43] amen
[21:44] hallelujah I just have a couple things I
[21:47] want to share
[21:48] a bible study this coming Sunday at 5 00

[21:55] prayer so just pray that all those that
[21:58] are able to come uh we will post that on
[22:01] WhatsApp
[22:03] um
[22:04] brother Gideon's memorial service his
[22:08] homecoming services this Sunday so
[22:11] please pray for the family there always
[22:13] seems to be a finality
[22:16] that comes when you have a memorial
[22:18] service and it's uh
[22:21] it's been just a shock for the not just
[22:24] their church but a whole
[22:27] a whole community of believers
[22:30] that has lost a brother a mentor an
[22:35] encouragement to the body of Christ and
[22:38] then on top of that if you would just
[22:40] please remember the family and the
[22:43] church
[22:44] of brother George Martin there in
[22:47] Pretoria South Africa which is just
[22:49] literally a few miles down the road
[22:52] uh brother George has passed away
[22:57] just stunning
[23:00] so please remember those
[23:03] amen another
[23:05] group of believers
[23:07] that is just shocked brother George
[23:10] was
[23:12] getting up in years a little bit but I
[23:15] just listened to him preach just a few
[23:18] days ago and
[23:20] sure seemed like he had a lot of life in
[23:22] him
[23:23] and uh so it would be a shock to them I
[23:27] want to speak to you on our journey once
[23:29] again tonight and
[23:30] amen just caught up thank you amen I
[23:35] sure appreciate brother Alex it's
[23:37] beautiful song service and uh sister
[23:40] vika sister Donna I'm just playing
[23:44] very lovely look as the Lord would tarry
[23:47] for
[23:48] many years of enjoying their
[23:51] uh commitment their talent that God has
[23:54] given them amen that they give to the
[23:56] church here I want to speak to you
[23:59] today on our road to Nineveh
[24:02] and I think Saints you know as we take
[24:04] this uh these thoughts these titles here
[24:08] uh I'm putting each one of us as you
[24:11] have noticed in these in these Wednesday
[24:13] Services because truly it wasn't just
[24:17] something that happened and that was a
[24:21] Biblical event we're literally
[24:23] experiencing the same things in the day
[24:26] that we live in we're we're experiencing
[24:28] the Bible coming alive Satan certainly
[24:31] would be here to Buffet us and try and
[24:34] spread his message but God is alive and
[24:37] well in his church amen which means he's
[24:40] alive and well in you and I and we get
[24:42] to look at these things and realize of
[24:46] what we're seeing by brother and sister
[24:48] and I have to say that because we are
[24:51] human that we have different views that
[24:54] we approach from but in the last few
[24:58] weeks before his passing brother Gideon
[25:01] was preaching on Ground Zero Jerusalem
[25:05] and in that he was taking the things
[25:07] that he absorbed the things that he saw
[25:10] and then looking back in the word of God
[25:13] and and uh it was it was just a very
[25:16] encouraging very insightful uh that he
[25:20] was bringing out of that and I think we
[25:23] can say that uh you look at Israel you
[25:26] look at Jerusalem and you have a
[25:28] different perspective it changes your
[25:31] outlook and so we just want you know not
[25:34] to drive a stake down as I've been to
[25:36] Israel but we do want our perspective
[25:39] our eyes to the word to be opened we
[25:42] want our hearts to be changed we want to
[25:45] be able to to look at the word and
[25:48] appreciate it and see it in the fashion
[25:50] that God ordained for us to receive the
[25:53] word in this day 2023 and so I just want
[25:57] to speak to you tonight on our road to
[26:00] Nineveh and uh as we would turn into the
[26:03] Book of Jonah the first chapter
[26:05] we're going to try to limit this to the
[26:08] first eight verses plus a little bit out
[26:11] of the second chapter uh tonight just to
[26:14] uh not to try and make you eat the whole
[26:17] Smorgasbord tonight the whole Buffet but
[26:20] just to just to take a little portion of
[26:23] this that we can go away remembering
[26:26] what it is that we have looked at and
[26:28] recognize it and apply it in our own
[26:31] lives
[26:32] now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[26:35] the son of Mitte saying arise and go to
[26:38] Nineveh that great City and cry against
[26:41] it for their wickedness is come up
[26:43] before me but Jonah rose up to flee unto
[26:48] Tarsus
[26:50] anybody ever done that
[26:54] my oh my
[26:56] yeah the Lord speaks and the first
[26:58] thought is it's a run
[27:01] to flee into tarshish from the presence
[27:04] of the Lord and went down into Jabba and
[27:07] he found a ship going to Tarsus and so
[27:09] he paid the fare thereof and went down
[27:12] into it to go with them unto tarshish
[27:15] from the presence of the Lord but the
[27:18] Lord sent out a great wind unto the sea
[27:22] my brother and sister this is the same
[27:24] God
[27:25] that put breath in you and I
[27:30] the same God
[27:31] that parted the Red Sea
[27:35] Jonah should have known better
[27:38] but how often
[27:41] we should have known better
[27:44] um
[27:46] my the Lord sent out a great wind into
[27:48] the sea and there was a mighty Tempest
[27:51] in the sea the so that the ship was like
[27:54] to be broken
[27:55] then the Mariners were afraid and cried
[27:58] every man into his God and cast forth
[28:01] the Wares that were in the ship and to
[28:03] the sea to lighten it of them but Jonah
[28:06] was gone down into the sides of the ship
[28:08] and he lay and was fast asleep so the
[28:12] ship master came to him and said unto
[28:15] him what meaneth thou o sleeper
[28:18] arise call upon thy God if so be that
[28:22] God would think upon us that we perish
[28:25] not
[28:28] my oh my
[28:30] and they
[28:32] said everyone to his fellow come
[28:37] we've got a glitch in here
[28:40] we have a glitch
[28:42] let's just go back right here
[28:46] the shipmaster came to him said what
[28:48] meanest thou asleep or arise call upon
[28:50] thy God if so that be God would think
[28:52] upon us and we perish not and they said
[28:55] everyone to his fellow come let us cast
[28:57] lots that we may know for whose cause
[29:00] this evil is upon us so they cast lots
[29:04] and the lot fell upon Jonah then said
[29:08] they unto him tell us we pray thee for
[29:11] whose cause this evil is upon us what is
[29:15] thine occupation whence cometh thou what
[29:18] is thy country of what people art thou
[29:21] you see they were grasping at straws
[29:25] there's got to be a reason they
[29:27] recognize that
[29:28] but we don't have a clue
[29:30] not one single thought come down there's
[29:34] somebody in our midst that's running
[29:36] from God never entered their thoughts
[29:38] they've already prayed to their gods
[29:42] you think they got an answer
[29:45] no
[29:46] their gods are mute
[29:49] it reminds me of what we visited
[29:53] caesaree felipei
[29:56] all of the carvings in the rock all of
[29:59] the little temples
[30:01] it's there they say that's this spot and
[30:04] it makes sense to me that Jesus spoke to
[30:07] Peter
[30:08] we have all these little temples on the
[30:11] rocks in the cliffs here carved into the
[30:14] Rock
[30:15] the very Headwater
[30:19] the
[30:21] I'm brain dead
[30:22] Jordan River I'm stuck on Galilee and
[30:25] I'm just like that's not the Galilee
[30:26] River the very headwaters of the Jordan
[30:30] River come from this place
[30:32] and all of these carvings and all these
[30:35] little temples and Jesus says to Peter
[30:38] who do you say I am
[30:41] God brings it to a point my brother and
[30:43] sister that all the gods of this world
[30:45] all the gods of laodicea and God's
[30:49] asking us
[30:50] who do you say I am Heavenly Father we
[30:55] just ask you to come tonight speak to us
[30:57] father let us take something away
[31:00] tonight that would just remind us and
[31:02] strengthen us Lord stir up our hearts
[31:05] father just to take a whole to the word
[31:07] each day
[31:08] Lord we were not called to a spirit of
[31:11] compromise we were not called father to
[31:14] Lord take a watered-down message
[31:18] father you called us to the truth
[31:21] and father truth Lord can only be called
[31:25] truth if it's in it's pure form
[31:28] we ask for your word father and it's
[31:30] Purity we ask you to speak in the name
[31:33] of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I
[31:37] almost brought the card out
[31:40] with me the church got a card in the
[31:43] mail
[31:44] that would give us for just a small fee
[31:47] to bring some people from the church to
[31:50] a another local church to attend a
[31:53] conference
[31:54] that would teach us how to pack our
[31:57] church out on Easter
[32:00] I thought my
[32:03] what is the world my brother and sister
[32:05] they believe it's just the amount of
[32:07] people they just believe it's it's
[32:09] filling every Pew it's just putting
[32:11] seats people in the seats they they have
[32:14] this idea and they have all kinds of of
[32:18] strategy to keep the people afterwards
[32:21] to bring them into the community of your
[32:24] church and my brother and sister it just
[32:27] struck me as ironic that it come out of
[32:29] the mail today and and I would have that
[32:33] because here we are looking into these
[32:36] scriptures that are dealing with being
[32:38] in the will of God and my brother and
[32:41] sister we see the scripture how it
[32:43] declares to us that we're now living in
[32:45] a day that everyone says that they are
[32:48] serving God and they have a purpose
[32:51] behind them the prophet of God said
[32:53] they're very sincere and we realize that
[32:56] but it's not about just being sincere
[32:59] and it's not about filling up the church
[33:01] but it is about being in the will of God
[33:04] and so it doesn't matter the numbers
[33:07] that there are it doesn't matter my
[33:10] brother and sister what kind of a
[33:13] presentation we have to the world but it
[33:16] is about being in the will of God and we
[33:19] see here now that uh Jonah is there and
[33:23] God speaks to him and he finds himself
[33:26] in a position now we don't have a lot of
[33:29] back history on Jonah to understand the
[33:32] circumstances of his life and what it
[33:34] was maybe he had some complex or there'd
[33:38] been some time that he felt like he had
[33:40] failed God we do not know but what we do
[33:43] see is that there is not a single
[33:46] hesitation In Jonah to flee from the
[33:50] perfect will of God he he gets right up
[33:52] out of his chair or out of his house or
[33:55] whatever it might have been and just
[33:57] fled from the will of God now my brother
[34:00] and sister we recognize this is our
[34:03] actually a more common occurrence than
[34:05] than we would like to admit sometimes
[34:07] God deals with us and it just doesn't
[34:10] seem to fit our current plan it doesn't
[34:12] fit our current resume as it were and
[34:15] but you know I say that God is working
[34:18] and the reason this thought struck my
[34:20] heart so much to bring it to our day how
[34:23] many times and I won't even toss it out
[34:26] at you but how many times I myself have
[34:29] turned from the perfect will of God I I
[34:32] know that I'm not making the right
[34:34] decision but it's an easy decision it's
[34:36] a convenient decision and things that
[34:39] lead us to make decisions like that
[34:41] oftentimes come you know that maybe we
[34:44] see ourselves as unworthy but my brother
[34:47] and sister when God called us whether we
[34:50] have an office in the body or we're just
[34:52] uh you know here as Believers my brother
[34:55] and sister God never called us to say
[34:57] hey when you become Worthy
[35:00] he is the only one that is worthy and
[35:02] the only one that will ever be worthy
[35:04] and so we look at this and realize when
[35:06] God asks us to do something speaks to us
[35:10] leads us to something we don't want to
[35:12] stop and say well I'm unworthy neither
[35:15] do we want to stop and say I am unable
[35:18] to do this because through Jesus Christ
[35:22] we are more than able and so as we look
[35:26] at this sometimes in their situations
[35:28] and I think that if you would tonight
[35:31] you would agree with me that sometimes
[35:34] we are unable but mostly it's because
[35:37] we're unwilling there is no no uh uh a
[35:42] push in our heart no push to step out
[35:45] into the promise of God and and just
[35:48] claim it amen you know uh the little
[35:51] story The Prophet tells about the little
[35:53] boy and the plank and winning a bicycle
[35:55] now my brother and sister there'd be a
[35:58] lot of things that you could use to to
[36:00] say you know what I'm not a very good
[36:02] bicycle Rider I've never tried to ride a
[36:05] plank before I've never this I've never
[36:08] that but really when it comes down to
[36:10] there was no penalty for trying and
[36:12] failing
[36:14] you follow me no penalty no penalty at
[36:19] all for trying and failing often times
[36:21] we come to a point where unwilling
[36:24] because we are actually afraid to fail
[36:27] and so we do nothing but we'll see as
[36:30] that little boy was he gone on that
[36:31] bicycle and he looked to the end which
[36:34] was a strategy different than the rest
[36:36] of them and I say my brother and sister
[36:38] the strategy that God has given to the
[36:41] bride of Christ to finish this race that
[36:44] we are in is to look to the end and not
[36:47] look to our circumstance so we look at
[36:50] this and see whether these things how
[36:53] they come about in his life and we look
[36:56] and conceive in here in the word that
[36:58] Jonah just simply gets up and flees he
[37:01] he runs away but somewhere along the
[37:04] line he has a plan you might say and he
[37:07] gets up and he doesn't just go wander
[37:09] Into the Wilderness but he is there and
[37:12] coming and he has a plan and and says
[37:14] you know what I know the shipping
[37:16] schedule
[37:18] I know what ships go to Tarsus and I
[37:21] know what ships go to Nineveh and I'm
[37:23] going to run up here and I'm going to
[37:25] get on a ship that's going to go where I
[37:28] feel comfortable how many times have we
[37:31] you know we hear that in the world today
[37:33] you know of my comfort zone well my
[37:36] brother and sister I don't believe any
[37:38] Christian could come in his flesh now
[37:41] let me speak of this just from the flesh
[37:43] position no Christian that I know of
[37:46] could say I'm in my comfort zone
[37:49] step over into the spirit realm and
[37:52] suddenly we are comfortable
[37:55] but in the flesh it is all uncomfortable
[37:58] the supernatural the prophet of God
[38:00] tells us that that men fear the presence
[38:03] of God and and rightfully so because he
[38:06] is a righteous God a holy God but my
[38:08] brother and sister the word of God also
[38:10] shows us that we've been called to live
[38:13] in that presence in that atmosphere and
[38:16] so we should not lose the fear as in
[38:19] reverence but we should not be in such a
[38:21] position that we are thinking more in
[38:24] the carnal afraid to approach Our God he
[38:27] is our God there is a a measure of
[38:30] possession in him claiming us and a
[38:33] measure of possession in US claiming him
[38:36] and so it's not a stranger we're
[38:38] approaching but it's our God Amen so
[38:42] it's there that we recognize that God
[38:44] has given a claim on us and given us the
[38:48] right to make the claim back on him so
[38:51] as we look at this now you know as he's
[38:54] no wandering he just simply gets up and
[38:57] he flees
[38:59] he's going somewhere I can assure you I
[39:03] know all about this
[39:04] I did it as a Young Man knowing that I
[39:07] really shouldn't run but I ran anyhow
[39:10] and when you get in the habit of running
[39:12] it's hard to stop now God wants us my
[39:15] brother and sister not to forget how to
[39:17] run you know that so the Running part is
[39:20] how Satan would anoint us God would
[39:22] anoint us because you see the scripture
[39:25] teaches us shows us that we should run
[39:28] this race amen so he wants us to have
[39:32] the ability to run and Satan comes in
[39:34] and perverts that ability to run and
[39:37] gets us turned around it might be an
[39:40] offense and a misunderstanding it might
[39:42] be something we've done or said and we
[39:45] just turn and we start to run but we're
[39:47] running the wrong direction and so God
[39:50] doesn't want to take your running away
[39:52] from you he wants to just turn you
[39:54] around get you pointed in the right
[39:56] direction that we can run this race Amen
[39:59] to finish it amen and so God looks I
[40:01] don't want to get sidetracked there
[40:02] there's a whole thought that ties with
[40:04] that but so it's there that we come to a
[40:07] place you know in the world my brother
[40:09] and sister there's a all kinds of songs
[40:11] from days gone by about gonna do it my
[40:14] way my brother and sister there is just
[40:17] no provision
[40:20] in a Christian to do it his way
[40:23] God never made a provision for us to do
[40:26] it our way but we are to do it his way
[40:29] and every time we do it his way he makes
[40:32] the way before us the scripture said he
[40:34] makes the rocky ground smooth
[40:37] laughs
[40:38] he makes that way before us
[40:41] I say Lord help me
[40:43] I want to walk amen I want to walk in a
[40:47] way that is pleasing to God I want to
[40:49] walk in the way that he has laid out
[40:51] before me Can someone say yes Lord amen
[40:55] because if we don't we'll find ourselves
[40:57] my brother and sister now it makes for
[41:00] great music it makes for great
[41:01] testimonies then oh I come the hardest
[41:04] way and I ran and this and that and God
[41:06] still called me back that's wonderful I
[41:08] have a little bit of that testimony my
[41:10] own self but much more the testimony
[41:12] that I listened to the word of God I
[41:16] look to the word and I followed it he
[41:19] illuminated my way before me he made the
[41:22] path smooth before me there's nothing to
[41:24] be ashamed of in this day that God has
[41:27] come and made that way before us but
[41:30] people seem to Glory
[41:31] and the fact of how bad I was and this
[41:34] and that or whatever my brother and
[41:36] sister there's nothing to glory in in
[41:39] that position but we'll look and see how
[41:42] God can use this in such a fashion uh
[41:45] here if I'll just get moving along amen
[41:49] and so the you know to do it my way
[41:53] you know they talk about how dangerous
[41:56] certain things are you know uh the most
[41:59] dangerous roads the most dangerous
[42:01] mountains the most dangerous this but I
[42:04] tell you the most dangerous Journey that
[42:06] we have is to be walking outside of the
[42:09] will of God that is the most dangerous
[42:11] Journey amen
[42:16] because we have a perfect road map today
[42:17] if we'll just simply follow it
[42:19] you know isn't it interesting my brother
[42:22] and sister
[42:23] that in the day that we live in
[42:26] people uh face certain uncertainties and
[42:30] in that well they they allow themselves
[42:33] to be consumed by the uncertainties and
[42:37] not of the certainties but this is why
[42:39] God come and Vindicated his word to this
[42:42] day in the heart of his believer so that
[42:44] we can eliminate the uncertainty that
[42:47] Satan is constantly bombarding us and
[42:50] putting in our heart now my brother and
[42:52] sister if Jonah had not had an
[42:55] uncertainty he would not have run from
[42:57] God
[42:58] but he had an uncertainty of his
[43:00] position and so it was in that
[43:03] uncertainty that he said you know if I'm
[43:05] not there I won't have to do that I
[43:07] won't have to face that but it's there
[43:10] that God comes brings a perfect word
[43:12] with a perfect plan to imperfect humans
[43:16] now those of you that are perfect please
[43:19] stand up I better find a chair
[43:23] but you see God's got a perfect plan but
[43:25] the problem is As we judge the plan by
[43:27] our imperfect self
[43:29] are in perfect thinking our imperfect
[43:32] life is how we judge the plan of God and
[43:35] what God's will is and Satan loves that
[43:37] because he's a major at uh Illuminating
[43:41] the imperfection
[43:42] amen you know if you ever go to a real
[43:45] honest Diamond dealer
[43:47] you know diamonds with flaws my brother
[43:49] and sister are not considered garbage
[43:55] Friday
[43:56] many a woman is walking around today
[44:00] with a beautiful diamond on her finger
[44:03] and that diamond would have what you
[44:06] might call
[44:08] a major flaw
[44:13] but if you're looking at that diamond
[44:16] my brother and sister
[44:18] are you looking to find the flaw
[44:21] or are you looking at the wonderful
[44:24] Beauty
[44:25] of what the light does and the creation
[44:27] of that
[44:29] see the world has it that we sell
[44:31] Flawless diamonds but that's really not
[44:33] true
[44:35] because there's nothing
[44:37] on Earth
[44:39] that is flawless
[44:44] hmm
[44:48] a Bugatti
[44:50] cars that cost millions of dollars
[44:53] still have recalls
[44:57] the fact that they cost Millions
[44:59] is a value that man placed upon that car
[45:02] its Rarity
[45:03] but that cannot make that car perfect
[45:09] so God says I didn't even try to make
[45:12] you in the flesh a perfect human
[45:15] but yet Satan comes and anoints Sons and
[45:18] Daughters of God real Christians to uh
[45:21] question their life question the things
[45:23] around them because they are not
[45:25] achieving perfection
[45:29] so we look at this imperfect humans
[45:33] now let's look at this
[45:36] without even looking into a theoretical
[45:38] concept we would know better
[45:41] but as you would take it my brother and
[45:43] sister even in time
[45:47] God has come and says you know what what
[45:50] I'm going to do
[45:51] is I'm not going to take you out as a
[45:54] believer
[45:55] and start teaching you algebra
[45:59] until I have brought you through
[46:02] your
[46:03] ABCs all of the small things
[46:07] isn't it amazing how many times we have
[46:09] to go to class to get some of the small
[46:11] things down right
[46:12] just reading in questions and answers is
[46:15] a it's obviously a sister uh writing to
[46:18] brother Branham about her temper
[46:20] and I need the Lord I know I shouldn't
[46:22] have this I need the Lord to deliver me
[46:24] from this and the prophet of God gives
[46:27] her this incredibly deep formula
[46:31] I mean it was just it was incredible it
[46:34] was a lot of parentheses and a lot of
[46:36] stuff just like algebra is
[46:38] and he says the longer you stay in the
[46:41] presence of God the less that will be in
[46:45] your life
[46:48] he didn't tell her she had to go through
[46:50] some kind of prayer line she didn't have
[46:53] to be slapped on the back she didn't
[46:55] have to no you stay in the presence of
[46:58] God and that will leave you
[47:02] I think that would go for a lot of
[47:03] things wouldn't it tonight Saints a lot
[47:06] of things in her life but we know that
[47:08] Satan tries to keep us we are amen
[47:11] easily
[47:13] the busiest generation ever
[47:16] so we look at this and realize that that
[47:19] we need to focus
[47:24] on the ABCs
[47:27] now I know this is a very simple thought
[47:29] tonight and I intended for it to be
[47:35] where can we apply
[47:38] getting in the presence of God
[47:42] do we have to have a
[47:44] certain place that we have to go
[47:48] to get in the presence of God
[47:51] only in church
[47:55] only in a prayer closet
[48:00] I want to drive home my brother and
[48:02] sister
[48:03] wherever a son or daughter of God is the
[48:06] prophet of God said the Supernatural is
[48:09] present with them
[48:12] whatever we're facing whatever has been
[48:16] thrown before us and we tend to want to
[48:18] pull back from that we kind of tend to
[48:20] want to flee from that our own self but
[48:22] there's something inside of us that
[48:24] really doesn't want to flee but we know
[48:26] oh Lord I I just need you just stop and
[48:30] get in that presence right there
[48:32] and we can then stop the influence that
[48:35] Satan has in our life now I want to just
[48:38] take you uh into this quote here believe
[48:42] us thou this
[48:44] now as we look at this my brother and
[48:47] sister would we agree that
[48:50] Jonah had some symptoms
[48:53] would we agree that as it is that Jonah
[48:57] has now been he's pulled the lot
[49:01] which is basically gambling but it was
[49:03] very accurate because God wanted it to
[49:05] be very accurate
[49:07] and even then my brother and sister it
[49:09] wasn't enough that it was identified
[49:11] that Jonah was the problem with the ship
[49:13] that uh God had to get him God wanted
[49:16] him out of the ship so now he anoints
[49:19] these men on the ship to tie him up and
[49:23] to literally cast a man into the sea
[49:25] which is called Murder
[49:32] some of them must have thought oh how
[49:34] can we do this
[49:36] but God anointed them even Jonah
[49:39] throw me overboard I'm the problem
[49:42] now this church
[49:44] of that attitude
[49:46] nobody's going to get thrown overboard
[49:50] but you see the length that God will go
[49:53] to
[49:54] to bring about his will
[49:58] we can run as far as we want to
[50:01] but God will tie us up
[50:05] and cause us to come to a place we can't
[50:07] run any further
[50:09] I say thank you Lord
[50:12] amen that we can run from things we know
[50:14] that we should do and things all of it I
[50:17] won't go into all the details tonight I
[50:18] believe that you grasped that but you
[50:20] see God will bring you to a place that
[50:22] he's going to tie you up
[50:24] and then he's going to bring you to a
[50:26] place that you have all kinds of
[50:29] symptoms and you don't have a solution
[50:32] for the symptom but I'm telling you my
[50:34] brother and sister in this we'll look
[50:36] real quick talk about symptoms look at
[50:39] Jonah down in the belly of the whale now
[50:42] I just read in my little study on this
[50:44] thought along the way here I love that
[50:47] little story I just want to interject
[50:49] that where the little girl you know the
[50:50] unbelievers coming along there and and
[50:53] he's talking to this little girl and he
[50:56] says surely you don't believe in Jonah
[50:58] and the whale and you know she says I do
[51:01] the Bible says it I believe it and the
[51:04] man's going along and she says and I'll
[51:06] I'll talk to him when I get to heaven
[51:08] and he says well what if he ain't there
[51:09] he said well when you get to hell you
[51:11] can talk to him
[51:14] so my brother and sister you see we
[51:18] should have an unshakable Faith they say
[51:20] what is this whale what could this whale
[51:21] be what could be that well I want to
[51:24] tell you we're going to be an advocate
[51:25] for the whale here in just a little bit
[51:27] you look at this my brother and sister
[51:29] that that this whale that God prepared
[51:31] was not on the ship out here it wasn't
[51:35] on the ship going over here but it was
[51:37] on this ship
[51:40] my voice has given up here
[51:43] I knew I shouldn't have swallowed that
[51:45] frog
[51:46] so the ship is there and now look how
[51:49] God coordinates everything
[51:50] just as it was on the road to Emmaus
[51:53] Jesus was there all the time waited till
[51:56] they got to the correct position and
[51:59] comes right in and walks right into the
[52:01] conversation now here is a ship that is
[52:04] a I mean a a whale that is a
[52:06] supernaturally anointed whale that is
[52:09] right there in a position and it's
[52:12] waiting there's got to be a ship come
[52:14] over the top
[52:16] this whale didn't suddenly go ding
[52:19] there's a splash 50 miles away gotta
[52:21] swim as fast as I can it was right there
[52:23] Jonah lands in the water the fish is
[52:27] there
[52:28] now my brother and sister if we can't
[52:30] believe that out of the word of God then
[52:32] what can we believe that God ordained
[52:35] that so we see now if anybody could have
[52:38] had symptoms he had them backslidden
[52:41] hands tied behind him out on the sea a
[52:44] storm come up pitched him out whale
[52:46] swallowed him went to the Bottom of the
[52:48] Sea any fat fish when you see when he
[52:51] feeds he goes and rests his fin on the
[52:54] bottom of the sea and there he was down
[52:57] there with a belly full
[52:59] of backslidden preacher
[53:03] when I read that my heart went out to
[53:06] this whale
[53:09] my he's resting on the bottom he's got
[53:13] this big chunk of backslidden preacher
[53:16] and he doesn't even get a digest him
[53:20] God's going to anoint him to have to go
[53:22] spit him out on the beach now you all
[53:25] know I hope I don't sound too disgusting
[53:26] but you all know what it's like when you
[53:28] have to give everything that was in your
[53:31] stomach up this whale can't be happy
[53:33] other than the fact he's anointed to
[53:36] fulfill the word of God I like this
[53:39] though he's down there with a belly full
[53:42] of backslidden preacher laying down
[53:44] there on the banks that down there under
[53:46] the sea a storm on the sea backslid what
[53:50] a condition he was he looked this way it
[53:53] was whale's belly he looked that away
[53:55] it's whale's belly we're talking my
[53:57] brother and sister a problem that there
[54:00] is no human solution to
[54:05] it's done it's finished
[54:09] everywhere he looked it was whale's
[54:11] belly and I want to just ask you tonight
[54:15] we've been in places in our life
[54:17] that we look every direction of the
[54:20] compass up and down and there is nothing
[54:23] but a problem in our life
[54:26] and we come to that place and we can
[54:28] give up but God never lost a one and he
[54:32] anointed you to keep searching for a
[54:34] solution till you come to his solution
[54:38] now his solution is not always the most
[54:40] convenient solution
[54:42] but his is the only one that always
[54:44] works
[54:45] amen so we hear it was he looked that
[54:48] way whales Billy everywhere he looked it
[54:50] was whale's belly you know what he said
[54:52] he said I'm not looking at that whale's
[54:55] belly
[54:57] there was something that was in him and
[54:59] I want to say tonight I believe every
[55:01] one of us here maybe our youngsters I
[55:04] haven't quite experienced that but every
[55:06] one of us that's lived life has come to
[55:08] the place that we realize we have to go
[55:11] back to the word of God and the word of
[55:13] God says you cannot look to your
[55:15] circumstance you have to look to the
[55:18] promise and I say God help us to look to
[55:21] the promise amen because the
[55:22] circumstance is so daunting it would
[55:25] cause man to lose heart
[55:28] but when we look to Christ
[55:30] we start to see there is a buoy provided
[55:33] there's a way opening before us
[55:35] the word of God the prophet preached
[55:37] that sermon God's provided way my
[55:40] brother and sister that's not just about
[55:41] coming down to Doctrine God's got a
[55:43] provided way for everything that comes
[55:45] on the man or human on this Earth he's
[55:48] got the provided way for that he's got
[55:51] the answer already before we even come
[55:53] to our problem he's given the answer
[55:57] amen
[55:59] so there it is
[56:01] now look at this I love how he said this
[56:03] because we have to all come to this
[56:05] place right here he said
[56:08] I don't know why I find this so humorous
[56:10] he's looking at whale's belly
[56:13] and he says lion vanity
[56:16] I can poke it
[56:18] seaweed wrapped around me and whatever
[56:20] else is there you know a bunch of oh
[56:23] anyway you look at that and he says
[56:26] that's a lion vanity
[56:29] Lord once more I look to your Holy
[56:32] Temple Hallelujah he didn't see the
[56:35] whale's belly he's seen God's Temple for
[56:38] he knowed this and so as we look at this
[56:40] I kind of cut this food short because
[56:42] there's just almost you know I I'd be
[56:45] just up here reading it all to you but
[56:47] you see Jonah knew the word of God he
[56:50] had read the word and he knew how that
[56:54] the temple being consecrated he knew
[56:56] that God had come into His Temple and in
[56:59] that he said I'm going to look to the
[57:02] temple I'm going to look my brother and
[57:04] sister he didn't look to a building he
[57:06] was looking to the one who filled the
[57:09] temple and he looked at all else and
[57:11] says you know what Solomon saw God in
[57:14] this Temple the Saints as it were saw
[57:16] God in this Temple I know God is in this
[57:19] Temple and I call the rest of this a
[57:21] lying vanity because whatever my
[57:24] position is right now I know I have a
[57:27] position in the temple in the house of
[57:30] God and he claimed that position
[57:33] and he speaks out about this for he knew
[57:36] that
[57:37] now
[57:38] we'll come and the reason I didn't go
[57:40] ahead and go with the quotes is because
[57:42] I just want to go ahead and go into the
[57:44] second chapter of Jonah
[57:47] and just take it right from the
[57:49] scripture I believe that would just be
[57:50] very fitting
[57:51] then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God
[57:54] out of the fish's belly
[57:57] and he said I cried by reason of mine
[58:00] affliction
[58:03] now I want to bring you to this point
[58:04] here's a backslidden preacher
[58:07] who runs from God and now he's there and
[58:12] he says my reason of mine affliction
[58:15] he knew why he was there
[58:19] he wasn't sitting there going I have no
[58:21] idea if God why God would punish me he
[58:24] knew what his Affliction was and he knew
[58:27] while he was there and he said unto the
[58:29] Lord and he heard me and out of the
[58:31] belly of Hell cried I be and thou hurt
[58:35] us my voice for thou Hast cast me into
[58:39] the deep in the midst of the season the
[58:41] floods come past me about all thy
[58:44] Bellows and thy waves passed over me
[58:46] then I said I am cast out of thy sight
[58:48] yet I will look again toward thy Holy
[58:53] Temple I'm telling my brother and sister
[58:55] there's no better position when we are
[58:58] in the depths of our struggle of life we
[59:00] can just put the term backslidden on
[59:02] that to be able to stop and say I will
[59:06] see the Holy Temple again I will see
[59:09] Christ I will see his presence I will
[59:12] see the out pouring of his spirit I will
[59:15] see this I'm not going to look at my
[59:18] problems at my symptom but I'm going to
[59:20] look to the Holy Temple which is Christ
[59:23] himself
[59:24] amen and so he says there I'm going to
[59:27] look again towards our Holy Temple the
[59:29] waters come past me about even to the
[59:31] soul the depth closed me around about
[59:34] the weeds were wrapped about my head
[59:39] this wasn't a comfortable there was no
[59:42] velvet chair in the belly of this whale
[59:45] he was caused by God
[59:48] to come face to face
[59:52] with the very thing that caused him to
[59:55] run in the beginning
[59:58] now I didn't go into this but brother
[59:59] Branham says you know we all say that
[1:00:01] Jonah was backslid but brother Brown
[1:00:02] says that Jonah was operating in God's
[1:00:05] will
[1:00:07] so we look at this and realize
[1:00:10] whatever position we're in tonight
[1:00:12] whoever may hear this whatever position
[1:00:14] we're in tonight
[1:00:17] as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:00:20] always brings us
[1:00:23] back
[1:00:25] to his will
[1:00:27] he said I'll never lose a one
[1:00:30] I won't lose a single one so what does
[1:00:33] that guarantee my brother and sister
[1:00:35] that whatever it is we're fleeing from
[1:00:37] God circling us right back and putting
[1:00:39] us in a position to fulfill the will of
[1:00:41] God
[1:00:44] and we'll touch on this on a later study
[1:00:46] I believe but I just want you to
[1:00:48] understand that the problem that we have
[1:00:50] as humans is we will operate under the
[1:00:53] anointing
[1:00:54] of the leadership of the Holy Spirit and
[1:00:56] then we'll end up like job sitting under
[1:00:58] a Vine going boohoo
[1:01:00] Nineveh repented now what am I to do
[1:01:04] look at all this boo who
[1:01:08] God lets the gourd grow up and God sets
[1:01:10] a worm to cut it down
[1:01:13] blessed be the name of the Lord amen you
[1:01:16] know it's all in the molding of the
[1:01:18] character
[1:01:20] so as he looks there we'll come here and
[1:01:23] go on I went down to the bottom of the
[1:01:25] mountains and the Earth with her bars
[1:01:28] was about me forever
[1:01:30] yet hast thou brought up my life from
[1:01:34] corruption O Lord my God when my soul
[1:01:37] fainted within me I remembered the Lord
[1:01:40] and my prayer came in unto thee unto
[1:01:44] thine Holy Temple that they that observe
[1:01:47] lying vanities forsake their own Mercy
[1:01:52] I want you to take that away my brother
[1:01:53] and sister when we'll look at the words
[1:01:56] and the things that Satan would do maybe
[1:01:59] he would put a stumbling Stone before us
[1:02:02] and we trip over that stumbling Stone
[1:02:04] but if we stop and look at that
[1:02:06] stumbling Zone and says that must be my
[1:02:09] identity then we are coming into lying
[1:02:12] vanities we are believing the devil over
[1:02:16] the word and the will of God but God
[1:02:19] says that's not what I want you to do I
[1:02:21] don't want you to observe the lying
[1:02:23] vanities nor do I want you to forsake
[1:02:25] the mercy that comes to us and and here
[1:02:28] is Jonah if a man ever needed Mercy my
[1:02:31] brother and sister Jonah needed Mercy
[1:02:33] Can someone say amen amen he needed
[1:02:36] Mercy at that moment and he was anointed
[1:02:38] by the Holy Ghost to come and claim his
[1:02:42] own deliverance from this God didn't say
[1:02:45] I'll let him stew in the Wales Bailey
[1:02:47] for a while and then I've still got work
[1:02:49] to do over here so then I'll make this
[1:02:51] this fish just go barf him up I'm sorry
[1:02:53] I didn't mean to use that word
[1:02:55] it's kind of gross
[1:02:57] but but no my brother and sister what
[1:03:00] happened God anointed
[1:03:02] Jonah to start claiming Deliverance
[1:03:07] there was no hope in sight when he comes
[1:03:12] into this anointing my brother and
[1:03:13] sister he didn't like have a father
[1:03:15] meter and realize hey we must be headed
[1:03:18] for a beach it's getting shallower there
[1:03:20] was nothing to give him any kind of
[1:03:22] indication that Deliverance was on the
[1:03:24] way other than the anointing that was
[1:03:26] down in his soul and he started to
[1:03:28] verbalize that and say I will see the
[1:03:31] temple again now whether you could say
[1:03:33] maybe it was in his death he's claiming
[1:03:35] that no no I don't believe that I
[1:03:37] believe it was life everything in life
[1:03:39] he was claiming that because there was
[1:03:41] an anointing come over him I say God
[1:03:43] anoint us God anoint us to always claim
[1:03:47] Life Look To Life claim the life no
[1:03:49] matter how hard it is and I'll be real
[1:03:51] blunt we have children and we have those
[1:03:53] around us that would be the extended
[1:03:55] part of this body of Believers my
[1:03:57] brother and sister we should not be out
[1:03:59] here boohoo but we should be coming and
[1:04:02] saying I see amen God in his Temple I
[1:04:06] see the veil how has written and God is
[1:04:09] present for his people and I claim that
[1:04:12] and I speak that and I believe that and
[1:04:16] I will act on that
[1:04:18] oh my brother and sister otherwise we
[1:04:20] might as well join them because our own
[1:04:22] pity party will take us to forsake our
[1:04:26] own
[1:04:30] huh they forsake their own Mercy
[1:04:37] oh my
[1:04:40] my soul fainted within me I remember the
[1:04:43] Lord my prayer came in unto thee and to
[1:04:47] thine Holy Temple
[1:04:49] they that observe lying vanities forsake
[1:04:51] their own Mercy but I will sacrifice
[1:04:53] unto thee
[1:04:55] with my many
[1:04:56] sacrifices on this altar in the whale
[1:05:01] no
[1:05:03] he became the altar
[1:05:08] his voice of Thanksgiving
[1:05:13] became
[1:05:14] the offering
[1:05:18] literally I say this in all kindness
[1:05:21] because it applies to me too but my
[1:05:22] brother and sister
[1:05:24] we got no excuse
[1:05:28] our voice
[1:05:30] to lift up Thanksgiving to the Lord
[1:05:33] Anytime Anyplace
[1:05:36] any circumstance
[1:05:39] it's here God has given it to us
[1:05:43] to be able to say I've refused to
[1:05:45] receive
[1:05:47] these symptoms
[1:05:49] these lies this circumstance and I will
[1:05:54] give praise unto God
[1:05:57] but I will sacrifice
[1:05:58] thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I
[1:06:01] will pay that that I have vowed
[1:06:03] salvation is of the Lord and at the
[1:06:06] point he's look at this now maybe I
[1:06:08] would over emphasize this but at the
[1:06:10] point that he is declaring this that I'm
[1:06:13] going to offer up to you Lord a voice of
[1:06:16] Thanksgiving and that I'm going to
[1:06:18] fulfill my vow and salvation is of the
[1:06:21] Lord and the Lord spoke
[1:06:24] to the fish
[1:06:25] come right in line God didn't say I'll
[1:06:28] just I'll work on him while we come to
[1:06:30] the shore that little that little whale
[1:06:32] however big he was was resting
[1:06:35] he's in God's will
[1:06:37] he's doing his job imagine
[1:06:40] the fish would be saying hey what are
[1:06:42] you doing he said well I don't know but
[1:06:43] God anointed me to swallow this
[1:06:45] backslidden preacher he didn't taste
[1:06:47] good at all
[1:06:50] now I'm just waiting for whatever the
[1:06:52] Lord tells me to do
[1:06:54] I don't know if fish communicate that
[1:06:56] way but I'm telling you what when God
[1:06:59] commanded that fish to do that that fish
[1:07:01] obeyed
[1:07:03] that fish was not out of the will of God
[1:07:06] and the Lord spaking to the fish
[1:07:09] and it vomited out Jonah upon dry land
[1:07:12] now my brother and sister this dry land
[1:07:15] was a little bit of travel distance
[1:07:18] but at that point and I say this with
[1:07:21] humor tonight at that point my brother
[1:07:24] and sister I have been down that Journey
[1:07:26] you have been down you have you have all
[1:07:29] of us down that Journey we are more than
[1:07:31] happy to do what God asked us to do at
[1:07:34] that point in time
[1:07:35] and I say thank you Lord that you would
[1:07:38] bring us back you'd have Grace you'd
[1:07:40] have mercy on us you would you would
[1:07:42] care enough to just draw us woo us back
[1:07:45] to you and at that point my brother and
[1:07:47] sister our attitude
[1:07:49] is entirely different
[1:07:51] our attitude has over been overwhelmed
[1:07:55] with a great desire Lord whatever you
[1:07:58] want Lord whatever you desire of me Lord
[1:08:00] I'm here Lord Hear My Cry I'm here for
[1:08:04] you
[1:08:06] here at my father
[1:08:09] amen because you see my brother and
[1:08:12] sister sometimes we look at this and
[1:08:14] realize that I'm just going to put this
[1:08:17] into my own accord if you don't mind
[1:08:23] Jonah's character
[1:08:26] just got molded
[1:08:29] a little bit
[1:08:37] if there ever was another circumstance
[1:08:40] and there was
[1:08:45] you would think Jonah would instantly
[1:08:47] heed
[1:08:50] and I'm not going to go and preach about
[1:08:52] that tonight but maybe we'll pick this
[1:08:54] up again on another Wednesday
[1:08:57] Jonah finds himself outside of the city
[1:09:01] he should have been out there almost
[1:09:03] like a jubilee dance brother Trevor
[1:09:05] sister Kerry praise God I preach the
[1:09:09] word they repented praise God but what's
[1:09:12] he do that anointing leaves him hmm
[1:09:18] woe is me
[1:09:20] come on preachers in this assembly
[1:09:23] woe is me
[1:09:26] yeah I don't even know why I'm a
[1:09:28] preacher I don't know why I'm a pastor I
[1:09:30] don't even know why I do I don't know
[1:09:34] yeah
[1:09:36] oh my I'll cut into
[1:09:38] time here
[1:09:40] but look at this now how it is it comes
[1:09:43] along
[1:09:45] God knew exactly what he was doing
[1:09:48] and look how the Lord knew
[1:09:51] I think
[1:09:53] I think just looking at this Saints
[1:09:56] I think Jonah was a hard nut to crack
[1:10:03] until I started comparing my life
[1:10:06] and realized that I matched Jonah almost
[1:10:09] point
[1:10:11] for point
[1:10:13] and I don't think I'm a hard nut to
[1:10:15] crack
[1:10:21] but we have all witnessed the time
[1:10:24] I think this will cut every age except
[1:10:26] for our babies
[1:10:28] even include some of our young people
[1:10:30] here tonight
[1:10:33] that we know better
[1:10:36] to do what we do or say what we say
[1:10:39] and we did it anyway
[1:10:42] do you realize that nut is no harder to
[1:10:44] crack than Jonah
[1:10:50] the word says that Sin is Sin no degrees
[1:10:54] that's why I bring that out no no
[1:10:56] degrees I lied to Mom or Dad I did what
[1:10:59] I wasn't supposed to I talked back
[1:11:00] they're all equal
[1:11:03] they're all equal come right up into
[1:11:05] adult Behavior All equal
[1:11:07] Sin is Sin
[1:11:09] my brother so and so did this
[1:11:12] I don't know if God can forgive him
[1:11:15] we pray for him for 365 days and if he's
[1:11:19] willing to come and crawl up the center
[1:11:21] Isle of the church and ask forgiveness
[1:11:24] now my brother and sister Sin is Sin
[1:11:27] we are all hard nuts
[1:11:30] to crack
[1:11:33] unless
[1:11:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:11:38] comes down and anoints
[1:11:41] we'll look at this now the condition
[1:11:43] he's in
[1:11:45] and then God puts Jonah in this place
[1:11:48] where under this conviction
[1:11:52] he suddenly
[1:11:53] has a prayer life again
[1:11:57] come on
[1:11:58] be with me on this we know what the
[1:12:01] cares of life let's not act like that's
[1:12:03] always someone else
[1:12:05] we know what the cares of life and the
[1:12:07] struggles are to us and how it is so
[1:12:10] easy we can't miss a meal but we can
[1:12:13] miss a prayer
[1:12:15] but God knows how to bring us right to a
[1:12:18] place that we are like Lord I need you
[1:12:20] to come on the scene I need you to speak
[1:12:23] to me Lord I need answers for my
[1:12:25] situation or someone else's situation
[1:12:28] and it's there that we come and our
[1:12:30] prayer life is revitalized Satan tries
[1:12:33] to make that sound like you're only
[1:12:35] crying out in prayer because of this
[1:12:38] circumstance but my brother and sister
[1:12:39] it's actually the opposite God is using
[1:12:42] the whale experience to revive a prayer
[1:12:46] life
[1:12:47] it we think it's all about us my brother
[1:12:49] and sister if it was about us we would
[1:12:52] go on and it would become more uh
[1:12:54] frequent and frequent and frequent that
[1:12:56] we did not pray but God says I'm going
[1:12:58] to give my son my daughter I'm going to
[1:13:01] give them a reason and I'm going to
[1:13:02] light the fire and I'm going to Fan the
[1:13:05] flame
[1:13:06] oh that's our God that's his grace and
[1:13:08] his Mercy that's not something for us to
[1:13:10] look at ourself and say I don't know why
[1:13:12] it's always takes some hard difficult
[1:13:14] thing for me to get a prayer life again
[1:13:16] my brother and sister God used a whale
[1:13:18] hands tied throat in the ocean look like
[1:13:21] all hope is gone to get Jonah A Prayer
[1:13:24] life again
[1:13:26] hmm imagine that
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:30] not just a prayer life but a heartfelt
[1:13:33] mound from the sincerity of the Soul oh
[1:13:37] Lord I believe your word and I believe
[1:13:40] I'll see the temple once again
[1:13:43] amen so what does he do God also knows
[1:13:46] how to bring you and I from our hitty
[1:13:48] and high-minded into a position of
[1:13:50] submission
[1:13:51] to come and say Lord I need you to lead
[1:13:54] me I thought I could I thought after all
[1:13:56] these years I could do this
[1:13:59] but Lord I realize I need you
[1:14:02] amen
[1:14:03] you might say God lined him up
[1:14:08] same God's here tonight
[1:14:11] Desiring to line us up
[1:14:13] oh some people say I don't I'm don't go
[1:14:16] for that I want a God that's just grace
[1:14:17] and mercy it don't get any more grace
[1:14:20] and it don't get any more Mercy my
[1:14:22] brother and sister than God bringing you
[1:14:24] and I back to a position of Fellowship
[1:14:26] bringing us back to where our heart is
[1:14:28] fervent and on fire again there's no
[1:14:31] greater grace and mercy on the earth oh
[1:14:33] people have such an idea well I can do
[1:14:36] whatever I want just reading where
[1:14:37] brother Brown speaking of this I can do
[1:14:39] whatever I want I'm a Christian now no
[1:14:41] my brother and sister God knows how to
[1:14:43] line us up
[1:14:44] people say I won't go to that church
[1:14:46] that's legal is what they saw was
[1:14:48] legalist was God actually coming and
[1:14:50] lining up his Saints to the word of God
[1:14:54] and people would say well they preached
[1:14:55] too hard
[1:14:56] well if it's just the preacher he might
[1:14:58] be preaching too hard if it's the Holy
[1:15:00] Ghost you better listen yeah
[1:15:02] yeah
[1:15:03] amen now remember just to balance this
[1:15:07] the Holy Ghost is a gentleman
[1:15:10] amen so we look at this and moving
[1:15:12] forward here real quick
[1:15:14] this is the Lord as difficult as this
[1:15:17] was
[1:15:18] this was the Lord wooing
[1:15:20] Jonah back
[1:15:23] hmm
[1:15:24] you imagine I just want to give you one
[1:15:26] moment of Terror
[1:15:30] not only are you on an ocean
[1:15:32] and I have been
[1:15:34] not on an ocean but I have been on a
[1:15:36] very large lake
[1:15:38] when the waves coming
[1:15:40] looked like the side or the end of this
[1:15:41] building coming towards you
[1:15:46] and suddenly
[1:15:48] I know I say this with a little humor
[1:15:50] but I say it in all seriousness suddenly
[1:15:52] you feel very compelled
[1:15:55] to cry out to the Lord
[1:15:58] in fact in the both that day
[1:16:00] as the water was slopping in the boat
[1:16:02] and the boat had probably 12 14 inches
[1:16:05] of water in the bottom of it and this is
[1:16:06] not a boat but flotation
[1:16:10] there was four of us in that boat
[1:16:13] all four of us was crying out
[1:16:16] one man was backslid had not been in
[1:16:18] church in probably six eight months
[1:16:21] started getting very worldly
[1:16:24] knelt down in a foot of water
[1:16:27] with the waves crashing over the side
[1:16:28] the boat and prayed through
[1:16:31] at the moment we were angry with him
[1:16:33] because we're saying this boat is
[1:16:34] sinking and you are what you're having a
[1:16:37] prayer meeting
[1:16:44] maybe that was his Jonah
[1:16:47] experience
[1:16:52] and maybe at that point in my life
[1:16:56] it was part of a Jonah experience for me
[1:17:01] because you start to have a very
[1:17:03] heartfelt conversation with the Lord
[1:17:07] Forgive Me Lord
[1:17:08] forgive me Lord forgive me Lord forgive
[1:17:10] me Lord
[1:17:13] I thought brother Alex the songs You
[1:17:16] Sang tonight were beautiful
[1:17:18] he loves you and me
[1:17:21] oh how much he loves you and me
[1:17:25] we ought to stand up as it were and say
[1:17:27] thank you Lord for a Jonah experience
[1:17:31] you didn't just let me go
[1:17:33] you didn't just let him throw me out of
[1:17:35] the boat and let me settle or whatever
[1:17:37] to the Bottom of the Sea and really
[1:17:39] honestly become fish food
[1:17:41] but you love me enough
[1:17:43] had everything in place to catch me when
[1:17:47] I was falling
[1:17:50] I say thank you Lord for Jonah
[1:17:52] experience
[1:17:55] let me close this
[1:17:59] the Lord wooing Jonah back into
[1:18:01] Fellowship
[1:18:02] I've got here on a side note some
[1:18:04] serious wooing
[1:18:07] but I don't know my brother and sister
[1:18:10] many of us
[1:18:12] have had that same serious wooing in our
[1:18:15] life
[1:18:17] amen
[1:18:18] this life twists and turns easy to get
[1:18:20] off the track isn't it
[1:18:22] I mean let's not be over spiritual here
[1:18:24] tonight okay I want you to be very
[1:18:26] spiritual but I just want us to stop and
[1:18:28] be able to admit
[1:18:29] it's easy
[1:18:31] to get off the track
[1:18:34] and it's easy
[1:18:36] to get back on the track
[1:18:39] amen
[1:18:41] when we act like Jonah it's just harder
[1:18:44] and harder to get on the track
[1:18:46] but I'm telling you my brother and
[1:18:47] sister poor analogy I've used it my
[1:18:49] whole life when I when the Lord wooed me
[1:18:52] back I started to realize all the things
[1:18:54] that he had kept me from we laugh about
[1:18:56] this some
[1:18:58] sister Jerry and I have some humor in
[1:19:00] this but it is like putting the dog on
[1:19:03] the chain and we've all seen this dog
[1:19:06] where he's the one that you know people
[1:19:08] are passing by on the sidewalk and he's
[1:19:10] over here and a hundred times maybe 500
[1:19:14] times a day he runs as hard as he can
[1:19:18] hits the end of the chain
[1:19:20] does the somersault flops down on the
[1:19:24] ground gets up shakes his head wanders
[1:19:27] back over here
[1:19:28] to the stake
[1:19:31] and waits for the next victim
[1:19:35] never realizing by his own behavior
[1:19:40] he is the victim
[1:19:44] but God rich in Mercy
[1:19:46] God rich in Mercy one day we got out
[1:19:49] there on the end of the chain and
[1:19:52] something said you don't need to do this
[1:19:54] I'll set you free
[1:19:57] amen
[1:20:00] Hallelujah
[1:20:02] sister vika will you come
[1:20:07] I could preach the rest of this but I
[1:20:09] believe we got the point
[1:20:11] amen God's led us given each one of us
[1:20:14] our road to Nineveh
[1:20:16] and he's come and met us along the road
[1:20:18] and we can look back and say thank you
[1:20:21] Lord because Without You catching me I
[1:20:24] would be lost
[1:20:26] and isn't it amazing I want to just make
[1:20:28] this one point
[1:20:30] they drew Lots which we would kind of
[1:20:32] view as more of a gambling kind of thing
[1:20:36] but isn't it amazing
[1:20:40] just guaranteed
[1:20:42] they were going to pull
[1:20:44] Jonas lot
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:49] the prophet of God
[1:20:51] talking about one in a million
[1:20:55] let's just stand to Worship the Lord for
[1:20:57] a couple of songs aren't you glad
[1:20:59] tonight
[1:21:01] as it were if you'll follow my thought
[1:21:04] when they pulled the Lots aren't you
[1:21:07] glad they pulled yours
[1:21:10] aren't you glad that God just come down
[1:21:12] and anointed that and said of all these
[1:21:15] millions and billions of people on the
[1:21:17] Earth I choose you oh I tell you it
[1:21:22] serves my heart Saints just as I studied
[1:21:24] this I thought Lord
[1:21:26] if this is not Grace some people think
[1:21:28] that doing what they want and God will
[1:21:30] forgive them is Grace but I tell you my
[1:21:32] brother and sister this is Grace
[1:21:34] this is Grace that when we tried to run
[1:21:39] he was there all the time
[1:21:41] we tried to flee from him we tried to do
[1:21:45] our own thing he was right there all the
[1:21:47] time
[1:21:49] imagine the presence of God
[1:21:51] is right there
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:54] he's sleeping in a ship that's getting
[1:21:57] all broke up by the waves and he's able
[1:21:59] to sleep in that ship
[1:22:02] and then when they said hey why are you
[1:22:04] sleeping what's going on
[1:22:07] he was anointed to say my fault
[1:22:12] my fault
[1:22:14] oh what are we gonna do
[1:22:17] toss me
[1:22:19] in the sea
[1:22:24] you think there could be just some
[1:22:26] residual of the revelation of
[1:22:29] predestination hiding in us even in our
[1:22:34] moments we're running away
[1:22:38] I'll close with this Sunday morning
[1:22:42] preaching to the Saints there in
[1:22:43] Monmouth
[1:22:45] now I don't know who's there and who
[1:22:47] isn't
[1:22:48] only find this out after the service but
[1:22:50] there was a man setting would have been
[1:22:52] to my right side
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:57] quite reactive in the service shook his
[1:23:00] head a lot raised his hand a couple
[1:23:03] times clapped
[1:23:05] [Music]

[1:23:33] you know what was really interesting
[1:23:36] this is where you see God's perfect will
[1:23:39] coming into our lives
[1:23:43] Brother Rich is there out in the
[1:23:45] driveway because the man was kind of
[1:23:47] leaving promptly and talking to him and
[1:23:49] the man says I'm not lifting Paul up but
[1:23:52] God did bless us I believe with a good
[1:23:54] service it just and the man said hey
[1:23:57] that preacher where is he from
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:01] Nampa Idaho
[1:24:03] Brother Rich said the man got a funny
[1:24:04] look on his face and said when we
[1:24:07] decided to move we were in a question
[1:24:09] between Portland and Nampa Idaho
[1:24:13] [Music]
[1:24:17] all that matters Saints
[1:24:19] said he finds Christ again amen
[1:24:23] God tossed him out of the boat you might
[1:24:25] say
[1:24:26] and he landed where God wanted him to
[1:24:28] land
[1:24:29] and that's back in his presence
