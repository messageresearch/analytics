Jericho Lord is singing the songs and doing what they were doing to bring the presence of God and in obedience to your word so father in the it was the Levites I believe that blew the trumpets and the walls came down so father we come to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ and if there's anyone with a wall a problem whatever it might be Lord Jesus you're more than able to tear it down it said they fell down flat so there was no Trace that those walls were ever even there so father that's the way we come to you tonight I come here as a man get me out of the way father that you can speak heart to your heart to people in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord well thank you brother Paul for having us here again tonight each one of you for coming out it's good to see you my wife actually was gonna make it but she's still got that cough stuff and she's either afraid that she's going to disrupt the service or cough it on to somebody so she's just she goes not yet not yet so just pray for her and uh pray for me I I I'm staggering a little bit tonight because my son sprains his ankle on Friday and not to be out done I sprained mine on Sunday so so we're limping a little bit but that's just you know these things go with the territory I suppose uh as I was looking at some things and I've been studying different things today this might come rather strange if I'm catching the way the holy spirit's trying to lead us let's turn first to Leviticus the seventh chapter I think we might have spoke on this some years ago here and I did it once in Mexico not too long ago but in the seventh chapter of Leviticus the first verse it says this is the law of the trespass offering it is the most holy in the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle roundabout upon the altar and he shall offer of it of the fat thereof and the rump and the fat and the cover at the inwards and he continues to talk about that and then he turned verse 5 he says they'll burn the the leftover there on the Altar and he repeats in verse six every male among the priests shall eat thereof and it shall be eaten in the Holy place for it is most holy we'll just read a couple more there it says and the sin offering is so is the trespass offering there is one law for them the priest that makes the atonement therewith shall have it and the priest that offers any man's burnt offering even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he offered gracious Heavenly Father we love you and we thank you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen and be seated we've been ministering the last couple weeks almost through I guess uh in Tri-Cities so I've got a little bit of this in my head still oh on Romans 3 and I'm not sure how the Lord wants to put this together with Leviticus 7 but we'll see so God bless you let's look at Romans 3 you can it's okay to be seated as we read this portion of this very simple it's the last verse of Romans chapter 3. and it's just one verse there and the last verse of Romans chapter 3 is 31. and he said I'll read 30 and 31 seeing it as one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith do we then make void the law through faith God forbid yea we establish the law so as we look at this and we think what is he what's he really talking about when he said you know do we uh he's talking about the circumcision there and the uncircumcision and we know of course the Jews were under the law they circumcised every man-child and if they weren't circumcised then you know they had no part in the Covenant and if we go back all the way to Abraham it was through the Covenant of circumcision that God he said is this is my Covenant that I make with you and this is my you know it'll be the circumcision and all your males and he talks about those things under the law but in and when we think about what is circumcision what he was actually talking about there well for you know male female it's just the removal of flesh is what the circumcision is and so and that was the you know for the Jews and for those who were going to receive the law after Abraham that was a type or a shadow of what God is shooting for all the way down through history he wants to see the flesh because this flesh as we have it and we understand it it came from sin born in sin shaped their iniquity came into the world speak and lost or speaking lies and and how that this this flesh and this the sin of this flesh and how that it uh you know in another place there in Romans and also again in Corinthians it talks about you know the the law Wars the law of the flesh Wars against the law of the spirit and so forth so we realize when we come down to this particular scripture uh he said but you know here it's one God and he's going to justify the circumcision how does he do it he does it by faith and he's also going to judge the uncircumcision or receive the uncircumcision through faith because Abraham had Faith before he received the circumcision he'd already met with God he had you know part of his promise and those kind of things all that had come to him by faith in God so when we receive God and we we receive Jesus Christ we receive the faith we take our little bit of faith that we have as the Bible says everybody's got a little bit of faith and when we put our faith into his faith then it's no longer our faith that does it it's the faith of Jesus Christ because we're taking our little portion whatever it is and some people have you know large portions of faith in others it seems like we barely make it from day to day but God does it and and it's and how do we do it well it's like you know I'm limping around today and my wife is you know she thinks I'm a little crazy but yeah and I pray she's probably right but I'm just sitting there going oh man with his stripes I am healed with his stripes I'm Healed with his stripes I am healed I may not have a lot of it but I know that works because his faith declared that in Isaiah and first Peter I believe it is and so when we take our little bit of faith and we put it into his faith then the all the promises become available to us because it's not it's no longer our faith it's not my faith anymore it's not your faith only that we're putting our faith into his faith and when we do that then every promise in the book becomes available everything that he that Christ was and ever will be we're a part of it if we have received Jesus Christ then we receive not only the name of Jesus Christ in that sense but we receive the faith of Jesus Christ and with the faith of Jesus Christ all things are possible because it becomes his faith and he said hey we can ask what we will and you can have it might be a little request might be a big request doesn't matter we've talked you know that that scripture uh if you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and a lot of times where we know we're looking and waiting for the big mountain to move but excuse me I got something stuck in there but uh brother Brandon told us sometimes it's just it might just be one grain of sand you know on tomorrow another grain and another grain and another grain until eventually it's gone it's just not there anymore and God uses a space of time for all of these kind of things we in that uh Ecclesiastes it says there's a time and a season for everything and he says a time for this a time for that a time of this a time of that going through Ecclesiastes there so we understand that with the fall came not only death because the day you eat thereof you shall die but we I tend to you know for a long time I tended to overlook the fact that in the day you shall die a thousand years is but a day in the eyes of God so when they ate of the you know when they partook of that unbelief as it were and had the she had Eve had the experience with the unbeliever and uh that put them into the law of time thousand years and the you know he said in the day ye thereof ye shall die no one lived Beyond a thousand years from that time on we know Enoch escaped I'll put it that way escaped having to die but even Enoch only went to the place where the uh I can't remember which message it is but even Enoch didn't go straight into the heavenlies he couldn't go there until Christ was resurrected and that's when it was lift up your heads or your Gates and so forth and brother Branham said that Enoch was with that group following Jesus into that Heavenly City he only got from you know point a to the where the Believers went in those days but he escaped death for that matter and so we look at this and we realize it's by faith you know by faith we receive our circumcision which is the killing of the flesh and so it's not in the natural circumcision because he said it's not that you know justified by circumcision and and uncircumcision it's the faith that does the circumcising or the getting rid of the flesh it's not always easy in fact sometimes it's rather rough because we were born in this stuff and being born in this stuff we have become very closely associated with our first husband and we know that the birth order was changed instead of it being you know from the mind of God he spoke and said let us make man in our image and it was from the mind of God to the word of God to an atom and then then after that Adam was put in the flesh and were taken from the dust and then after that Eve is taken from Adam as we know these things and so the birth order was changed when she had the affair with the serpent because now the the first thing that comes about is the flesh through the the contact the male male and female the baby begins to form in the womb after that we've heard of course from the message that brother random and we know it to be true I've seen very seen it happen where the woman gets a really sweet Spirit about her in the you know a few days sometimes a few weeks before she delivers the baby because instead instead of it being you know from word to Spirit to flesh now it's flesh and then the spirit is waiting to take go into that baby and then when it comes forth it becomes a living soul well the living soul that it becomes is according to the first husband which is after the flesh that's why we have problems and we know that again there in Romans I I don't think I wrote it down but it talks about the the uh the woman and how that she's bound to the first husband as long as he's alive but if the husband is dead then she's free to marry another you're familiar with these scriptures right okay so that she and so what's it really talking about is that as long as we're bound to the first husband we're stuck but if the first husband's dad then we're free to marry and it even says there in in that scripture that says only in Christ because we're free to marry marry or become bride of Jesus Christ we are we become when we receive Jesus Christ the flesh is dying it's dead in fact officially if you want to look at it that way from God's word it's dead the minute you receive Jesus Christ amen finished done in his eyes but we have different eyes because we came the other way and so we you know I I used to kind of run back and forth with but I remember one time with repenting about things and I you know being in a lot of meetings around different places in the world I I hear preachers preaching and good messages but they hold prayer line after prayer line and some people like they're coming up for salvation every prayer line and it's like no no that's not it I received Jesus Christ the first time in his word if we believe his word he said lo I Am With You Always even until the end of the world and again he said I'll never leave you or forsake you you say but oh man I do such bad stuff and if I make my bed in hell he's still there to pull me out because that's God and that's where we put our faith so then he comes to this next verse he says do we then make void the law through faith and that's an interesting question because once we receive Jesus Christ he overcame the law every single law done finished we are no longer under the Old Testament law per se but the law he said when he makes this statement do we make the law make void the law through faith and he says God forbid we don't make that law void and back in Romans 7 and 14 it says the law is spiritual for we know that the law is spiritual but I'm carnal Soul under sin so he's telling us we we came into this world with this fleshly man and this carnal stuff and we've been fighting with the laws of the the all these natural laws because of this flesh that's under the natural law but the law itself is spiritual and so if this law is spiritual that we serve we serve a different law and he said so we he said do we make the law of none effect and he said God forbid what's he talking about for those that have received Jesus Christ we are dead to the law he fulfilled the law done over with he fulfilled every portion of the law and that law is dead in fact it says he became sin for you and us he paid the entire and complete penalty for sin done it's a finished deal and when we receive him we receive the potential the fullness of that into our soul our soul becomes by faith circumcised unto the law because the law is spiritual and the faith circumcises us to where that we can receive the covenants of Abraham Abraham your seed will possess the gates of its enemies Abraham you're going to be like you know sand of the sea all the different promises that came to Abraham so what he's saying there God forbid that the law because the law is spiritual but also that law does not stop in fact it's so much in effect not for the Believers because we have a way out we have been circumcised under the law through Jesus Christ into a spiritual law of all things all promises are mine everything that Christ had is available to you and available to me but the law is still in effect so much so that we had a prophet's message and in the the uh divisions of 1933 what you know everybody's talking here a couple years ago about oh uh sixth division fulfilled the woman in purple all those things we knew it was coming had to come and the things that go along with that but at the seventh Vision was ashes all across the land of America why is that because the law is still in effect and because of the denominational world and the the world in general the law was that a harlot should be stoned and burned with fire and she will be because the law is still in effect so he says God forbid but he said yea we establish the law and if you notice between where he says God forbid and Yea we establish the law there's those two little two little dots there that when brother Branham preached uh this day the scripture is fulfilled he gave us a cute not cute that's not the right word I'm sorry but uh just some insight into what those two dots represent many many many times in the scripture that's a time space so there's a time space he's saying no the Law's not done with way with God forbid we did away with it because it's going to be carried out all the way to the end but for the Believers we have overcome the law through Jesus Christ and so he makes this statement God forbid yea we establish the law what is that to you and me what is that particular course there we establish the law not by the doing of the Old Testament law but by the overcoming of the Old Testament law through Jesus Christ when people look at us we are establishing the law because when we get hurt we say with his stripes I'm Healed when we have problems in life where do we turn we turn back to the scripture that represents Jesus Christ in the beginning we turn back to the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so we establish the law we become the signpost of the law and the Fulfillment thereof through Jesus Christ that should make us pretty happy because when people look at it they can't see that Old Testament law I mean there's a few Jews in in Israel that they try to keep that I mean Paul was just over there and Jerry and and there's certain Jews those Orthodox and they're trying oh man they try to keep that Old Testament law most of the world doesn't know that even exists hardly the primary for the Gentiles like like president said we were we were walking around the club over our back we didn't have any desire to do the law that those guys are into so the law that we express or that we establish as we receive Christ into our lives and we begin to magnify his name magnify his word because there's certain things we just don't do anymore or shouldn't do anymore if you do quick repentance is the best way to get back we heard that too and so we established the law so that when the world is looking for they know there's a law of God out there somewhere most of them and and I've got to talk to many people you know said well you know what's the first law and Emily said God wrote a a law in the sky about and it points us to Jesus Christ there's the Virgin birth the line of the tribe Vegeta a Judah there's the the judge over there with Libra there's you know and so they know there's a law there and they know there's laws in nature in fact all the scientists and stuff are study into these laws and even the things they've come up with in genetics and stuff over these last few years they know there's laws there and they're trying to break into those laws the laws of life but the law of life is Jesus Christ so when they look at us we may look a little crazy we might look a little ragged but we establish the law or the fulfilling of the law in our lives through Jesus Christ for certain [Laughter] I just had to do that brother Paul and that's one of the first messages we've preached there in a long time they said keep going on this so we you know but uh so we become the what people are looking at they they don't know it because it's unseen but when they see you they see the Fulfillment of the law through Jesus Christ so we become the we establish the law so then we read there from Leviticus I love the Lord and in this particular place uh where he's talking there in Leviticus we know it's talking to the priests and such and laying out the sacrifices and telling them how you know this sacrifice is for this and that sacrifice and all those things in his Leviticus I started at seven verse 1 and he talks about uh likewise this is the law of the trespass offering It's the Most Holy there's a whole lot of laws and sacrifices and stuff they did you know I believe it was a dove or a pigeon for healing and they had and a different one for leprosy and and all those things but this one he said is the most holy who we we know immediately it's talking about Jesus Christ because he alone is the most holy so as we begin to look at this and we think about establishing the law how does these law establish how do we establish this law because we're here to establish this right so this is talking about Jesus Christ and it tells him you know he's It's the Most Holy one and it tells them where they kill it and how to sprinkle the blood round about the Altar and of course we know it's talking about the altars of our hearts and uh and he comes down and he tells them how it's going to be divided up and everybody has to have a bite and then after they get that after they have received of the sacrifice they burn it with fire that's why we get justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a scripture that tells us that whosoever calleth on the name of the Lord will be saved amen because it says it but that doesn't mean they're full of the Holy Ghost and it doesn't mean they're a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ it just for whatever amount of Jesus Christ they received it was enough to obtain eternal life whoever calleth on me all noise and cast out I will but that doesn't mean that they're going to be those that are in the holy city of the Bride of Jesus Christ so here he gives them this sacrifice and tells them how to divide it how to eat it and then he mentions also that trespass offering and mentioned again in verse six it's also the most holy and is he begins to talk about this and he says the priest in verse 8 the priest that offers any man's burnt offering even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered this is where I almost start wanting to jump up and down because in this it's giving a description of Jesus Christ becoming the most holy offering to get rid of sin and trespasses and how that that offering would be divided and Jesus on the night that he was betrayed it said he took bread and he began to divide the bread to his disciples and likewise manner he took the cup and he had them to drink and he said this is the New Testament of my blood it was the changing of the law of that Old Testament law into the New Testament law in which we become those who establish it but as they're going through this and everyone had to be a partaker of that sacrifice and then they would take the take the remnants thereof and they would run it outside and uh outside the gate and outside the gate they would burn the sacrifice and then the priest would take before he left the the sanctuary though he had to change his garment and when he would change His Garment and then he would take up these ashes and he would go out beyond the gate and Beyond the gate he would take those ashes and he would sprinkle them somewhere out in the wilderness wherever they had you know a special place for the ashes I mean the first place I love brother job where did he go when he was uh having his problem he went to the ash Heap because it was the only thing he had left that he knew he had met God's commandment he didn't have anything else left he didn't have another lamb or cow to sacrifice because the devil took it all he didn't even have any family left to hey man can you loan me 10 bucks so I can buy a lamb because God took that too I mean Satan took it from him God allowed it and so where did he go he went to the only place he had left to where he could where he sat down on that ass sheep and when he's on the ash sheep what's he doing he's scraping his sores with a broken vessel he's scraping himself with Jesus Christ he is our broken vessel and so here he is on the ash sheep he's doing that but now back to this and so the priest says that he goes out and such well then when the priest comes back and I can't remember if there's another place where it says he changes his garment again or not might be uh Leviticus 9 but uh yeah don't after that when it's all said and done everybody's gone home blood's on the altar Spirit of the Lord came down they did all their Duty and the high priest is getting ready to leave the sanctuary and go home who's the high priest Jesus Christ so the high priest has just offered himself or as we would say his son on the altar and now that that lamb that was slain you know they take it and when he's talking about how they divide it all up the first thing they do is they scrape the skin off throw it over on a chair somewhere I don't know what they did with it but they throw it over there somewhere and it lays there until all this other stuff is done and after all that stuff is done this priest comes back looks out okay people are going home they're rejoicing whatever their whatever's going on and the priest is getting ready to go home he goes over and he picks up that skin throws it over his shoulder because the Bible says it's his are you with me and the high priest takes the skin and goes home do you love him the high priest gets the skin he's the one that made the sacrifice by his word following the law he follows the law he does what the word says but where he changed the Garment before he went out so where does that fit the picture and we fast forward to the time of Jesus Christ when he's on Earth and he's gone to Calvary and it was a terrible terrible thing for in our eyes of what happened but it was the high priest allowing those High priests to sacrifice the perfect lamb because the highest judge in the land said I find no fault in him he was judged absolutely perfect and with that condition he could be crucified he could become under the law the perfect sacrifice the most holy sacrifice well we know what happened he died that body died and I know there are some people out there they say that Jesus couldn't be God because he died well I always ask the question then who in the world the Bible says Jesus Christ was speaking to the whole to the souls that were in prison there's a part there that never died you better get the word the word never died it was a fulfilling of the word well then when he he comes on the scene he raises you know the and he brings with him those other uh dead Saints out of that area and they they arise with him in fact the Bible said they were even seen after the resurrection around the city they could be witnessed as fulfilling the law or establishing the law because they died under their sacrifices and under those things you can find this in Hebrews 12 or 11. and it says they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins and of whom the world was not worthy I love that set of scriptures oh man where'd they get the sheepskins and the Goat skins hello you understand So it's talking about and when those people came up on that Resurrection Day they walked about so that they could show the people that they established the law they became the law of the Resurrection through Jesus Christ so and Jesus when he comes out of the Tomb the first thing one of the first things that happens there uh you know the I believe it was Mary one of the Mary's she you know she goes to the tomb and she's crying in wherever you because they look she looks in the Tomb and the the stones rolled away and she's looking in there and where have you laid my Lord because there's a man standing there she thinks it's the gardener and she said where have you laid him I'll I'll take care of him and when she hears the voice of the gardener she said she knew it was Jesus the priest had changed the Garment and come forth but he tells her I've not yet ascended to the father that the sacrifice has been has been accepted but the very next portion he appears to the disciples he says okay now stick your fingers in my hands in my side because what happened after he went before the holy altar the most holy altar the fire of God he came back as the high priest of our confession and picked up the skin and put it on because those Old Testament priests and judges and all those things what did they use the skin for oftentimes well they didn't have paper like we have they would take a little chisel and a hammer and some ink and they would lay those skins out and you know they had different processes for keeping them and they would chisel the word of God into the skins and that's and then they would roll them into like the Scrolls we talk about the Seven Seals and stuff the wood was chiseled and job said it well though my words were written with an iron pin in the rock forever it's all Jesus Christ and how that the high priest went and picked up his to prove that I am the high priest now and he put that skin on and the next time they saw it he goes okay see this kid showing that he had established or fulfilled the entire law through Jesus Christ so if we establish the law what is our part of this the skin we know then ascended on high and he broke up the sacrifice as it were and to pour it back out to us as the Holy Ghost Genesis 49 I think it's eight said he became the resting lion who's our rest the Holy Ghost fire of God becomes our rest and so he pours out the Holy Spirit or the fire to get rid of this flesh that we're living in because the entire penalty for sin is done it's finished and when we receive that fire of God in us it is the Bible says our God is a consuming fire and he consumes when he comes into us that's why sometimes I don't know about you guys but I've had a few struggles here in my life and I just you know you feel like you're getting almost burned up or ripped up or whatever it is and it's because the Holy Ghost Fire is burning you know it's like today we were talking a little bit and it's like man it's like one thing after another this happened that happened this happened that happened I they started to say what's next and I go I don't want to know well what is that it's those trials and those Temptations to help burn up or burn the old man out of us that we can rule and reign with Jesus Christ because he's not going to have a bride that does not have his same character it's not you know we use the term Cakewalk no we have to have the same character because we're of the same sacrificial offering when we receive Jesus Christ and when we receive the Holy Ghost then he can take us and begin to establish the law in my life but there's another part because we get ready to close here and in this other part what the skin that skin there okay that he you know he that shows that he became the high priest of our profession you send it on high and shows that he was the Fulfillment of the law and now he pours that Holy Ghost back into us so that we can be part of him and it says we become part of Jesus Christ who has fulfilled the law therefore we can establish the law through Jesus Christ or let people look and say well who do you think you are well my name is David Nash but I'm establishing the law whether you like it or not because I received Jesus Christ and it becomes so powerful that he said you can have what you ask for and I I don't claim this as a you know people are always looking for testimonies and and stuff and but one time I was treated very roughly by a bank and you know a little bit maybe like Elisha who called for the Bears when I walked out of the bank I just kicked the uh the railing nice fancy building nice big place I kicked the railing and my wife is sitting in the car she goes why'd you do that I said what do you think she goes you kick the dust of your heels against that place I said you're right and then I began to explain what they did she goes wow I don't remember how many years but it was a fair amount of years later I went back to that particular City and I had heard briefly after that that bank had basically gone bankrupt and been bought out by another bank but when I went back a few years later than that tenant maybe 10 or 12 years I don't remember exactly the place where that bank stood was a big Downtown parking lot full of bums doing the things that defecating and throwing up and broken bottles God doesn't take it lightly he establishes us as the law and whether I was you know well what would your uh you know father forgive him it wasn't in my heart that time it just wasn't there I had a need and they basically kicked me out and so Our Lives friends are establishing the law and sometimes no brother Branham in one place he said there will be people that make it simply because they were kind to you and there's different ones when I look through my life to where I just go Lord God don't let that one go I know they're never going to see what I see brother Branham talked about his neighbor and he said he stood for me he goes don't go over there and go bothering him he goes they stood for me I'll stand for them that's the power that we have with God but at the same token we have the power to condemn that Harlot to be burned with fire so I said we were going to close with this so we become his skin when the high priest left and he took that skin and he became Jesus Christ the high priest of our confession and when he pours himself into us it's no longer our skin we become purchased products if I can use that word of Jesus Christ we're not ourselves it says somewhere in the scripture I'm sure we're not our own we are his we are his to do to be whatever he wants us to be there's a few times where I had scratched my head and went Lord I know the Potter's not supposed to say that the clay or you know the clay is not supposed to say to the Potter but do I have to do this but we're his skin and he says and he guides us and he leads us to certain people and and because he is seeking the fullness of his body and the fullness of the establishing of the law and there's another benefit to that when we're sick we can say Lord an enemy hath done this and I'm sick or hurt or an enemy hath given me this bill you ever get you know you're pretty flushed with things and all of a sudden you're one trip to the doctor's office or whatever and you're now you're 30 000 ducks in the hole here well but because we're his skin we can say Lord didn't you pay for this Lord I know you paid for this and we can go before Throne of God and ask what we will because it's paid for and because his skin has now become our skin and we are entitled to it when we are burned with fire by faith and the flesh has been cut away doesn't matter as far as the natural circumcision or uncircumcision is the circumcision he says in another place of our hearts and if our hearts have that first husband killed and dead you got every right to every promise according to God's word because we become his skin the priest went home you understand we have a right to walk off of this world because now we are the manifestation of the law and he said I am the resurrection and I am the life for a Christian it's an absolute win-win deal because we now in this skin which is becoming his skin we can say and one day we will some of us have already gone to the what we call the grave grave was your Victory grave where's the sting death where's your sting well it doesn't matter they are fulfilling that part of the law the resurrection and for those of us who are still around at the particular time or moment or say the right thing however it works you can just cross over without going because he said so you love him God bless you thank you tonight Let's uh that's created me a clean heart see I was actually thinking about speaking something else in the very first line I have there's Psalms 51 10 created me a clean heart when brother Alex started singing that song I'm going hmm I kept trying to get away from these pages I flipped back and there it was again and I thought oh my well your proper gift Alex thank you God bless you let's just stand for this and he's speaking actually there of another law when he says create in me because that's another law started out in the beginning God created and he is creating an end by his establishing the law he's proving the law of creation I mean it goes on and on that's what we [Music] um creating me a clean heart oh God Spirit Within Me creating me a clean heart oh oh God and renew our right Spirit Within Me has it from thy presence [Applause] [Music] please [Music] the joy of the Salvation and renew our rights for we sing it once more and I hand it back to Alex or brother Paul we were just in Peru recently and uh I don't think brother Paul I'm a convention preacher I just I prefer going out Village The Village out in the bush that's just just me because you wind up sitting and all this stuff but they did something at the end of their convention I was really impressed and I got into it they decided for the very last service on Sunday night that I've heard brother Brannon mention this but I'd never seen it done before he said well if you're gonna do testimonies and that kind of stuff he said you should have a special service set aside for it well brother Gayton they did that the Sunday night service was just for songs specials testimonies whatever and uh how the Holy Spirit comes when he begins building on things and you know some of them were testimonies about well Lord did this for me in the convention and others were all different kinds of testimonies then they'd sing a song and and instead of having it you know set up like we do here and how the convention had been set up they had all the chairs along the side so anybody could come out to the middle and they'd handle the mic and give their testimony and do something maybe be something for Camp rather because about halfway through that place started coming on glued hearing the testimonies within the songs of all the Believers before it was over the whole place was dancing and all the women it was not now I've seen a few dance place you know places where they said that was dancing in the spirit well I'm not sure what spirit that was but this was so orderly and so beautiful all the women were you know they we're in a big you know the men started in a little circle and praising the Lord and doing what they were doing and that Circle kept getting bigger and bigger as each one would join and then pretty soon with all the sisters were actually going in the opposite direction and as the brothers would walk by the sisters you know we'd either high five or shake hands and I just learned I've never seen this before but it was really beautiful and anyway God is God and we all have a testimony we all have a portion or a thing that's God that God's done for us and just remember those people down there we got invitations of course come back come back come to one of the most touching things for me I was struggling a lot because my normal interpreter couldn't get into the country so I was using Google translate a lot thank God for Google translate I don't know that I let much care about Google but I sure like to translate it up and uh so you know we were doing that but at the end of it there's a bunch of Inca people had come down out of the Himalayas and uh they stayed over Monday morning all day Monday they sang and continued testifying and singing and part way into Tuesday before they had to start catching buses or whatever to go home and one of the most touching things to me and was one of the Incas a couple of the Incas came up and just said brother come come to the mountains because what you said went straight to our hearts so I hope that's what God did for you tonight God bless you love you thank you Paul Jerry take care of that guy would you God bless you brother Alex creating media clean heart oh God and renew
