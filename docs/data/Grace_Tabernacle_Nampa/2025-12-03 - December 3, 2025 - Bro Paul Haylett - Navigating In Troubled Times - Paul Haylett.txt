TRANSCRIPT
========================================
here in this day. Uh just a couple little encounters this week where you're a little bit marveled that you know people make an identity and say you know I believe the Bible therefore I'm a Christian and and no recognition that it goes much deeper and no desire for it to go much deeper. And so you see that God is working and and uh and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed. And I when I read this scripture, it struck me that here we are in this day in this age and the seventh seals being sealed up. And it was there that God said, you know, before this is finished, I will unwrap or reveal the seals. And many people still today uh would say that the seals are not open. But my brother and sister, this scripture clearly shows us if the seals are not open, we're blind. Amen. And God never called us to be a blind people. Amen. Stumbling along, stumbling through life, not sure what God wants, what sure God desires, what we're supposed to do. But the seal has been taken off. And so it's there. We are not here any longer. Amen. This thing's about to land in a trash can. Um, we're not here any longer to say when this is revealed, we can move forward. But you see, God's already revealed it. Now, there's many things that that I have to admit myself. I'm not sure that I have a full understanding of what it is, but I can't sit here and say because I do not understand it that it's not open. Amen. God is revealing himself, opening the word to us. Slow but sure it's taking place. Amen. And so there's one that says, "I I I cannot, for it is sealed." And there's it's delivered to one that is not learned, saying, "Read this, I pray thee." And he said, "I'm not learned." So both have an excuse for not diving into the word of God and taking hold of that word to move forward and have greater revelation. And that certainly is a reflection of the world we live in today that many people they come along to to certain things in their life, certain things of the word. And unless they just readily see it, they just put it on a shelf and and uh don't even want to really deal with it. And uh God wants us to deal with it, right? The prophet says, "Pray for revelation." Amen. That's a very valuable tool just to pray for revelation. It doesn't require some great mighty thunder and lightning and whatever happening. God's going to give you revelation when you pray for it in the right season. And so it's there that uh one can say I'm not learned. Now there are many many wise people around the message of the hour. But God brought it down in such simplicity that folks such as myself could come along and grasp the very meaning of the word and be able to move into that and live in that promise. Amen. So therefore we see that uh verse 13 very relevant of the day that we live in says wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near to me with their mouth and with their lips do honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men. Now you look at that and realize how that me many people Amen. It would be us except for the grace of God. Many people uh uh they say I'm a Christian but at the same moment will will speak of things that a Christian should not speak of. Amen. They participate in things a Christian should not participate in. And it's there that by their words they can say I'm a Christian. And um then they dare anyone to uh contradict that actually with very aggressive behaviors. And so you look at that and you see now uh it's it's a very beautiful thing as we come in this. So we see that people can draw near with their mouth. If they're just drawing near with their mouth, there's got to be a people who are drawing near in another fashion. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. In another way, they're drawing near. They're saying, "You know what, Lord? I I want to be with you. I want to be." We sang tonight. Amen. Lord, I need you. I want you. I want to serve you. And And that's not just with their mouth. Amen. So they remove their heart and their fear is taught by the precept of man. So there they they the church comes along and says this is what God means and uh this is what you should be reverent to. This is what it is. And uh and I won't go into that tonight because it kind of goes into another branch. But you know uh touch not God's anointed is another way of teaching fear to the people where the ministry would stand here and say don't question me. Don't don't uh ask a question. Don't question me. Don't do this because I'm God's anointed. See, they're putting another kind of fear into the people. It's not God's fear. And when we put the fear of God into the life of a son or daughter of God, it's a reverence. We reverence God. We we come to him and we give him uh praise and glory and honor for who he is. And we know by scripture that when we praise the Lord, he blesses us. Amen. You want to be blessed, just open your mouth and be praising the Lord. Amen. Not empty words, but just be speaking from your heart. Amen. So, we don't want to be taught by a precept of men. Amen. So, um we look at this. Woe unto them, verse 15, that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord. Now, why would any Christian has a relationship with the Lord, seek to hide their counsel from the Lord? This sounds more like out of the Old Testament, those men that would come and they would be false prophets. They would be their balums, you might say, of the scripture. and and uh they wanted to misguide the people. That was their intent. But they didn't want it to be revealed that they literally were outside of the word. They wanted to stay as though they were real prophets, real men of God. But you know, um God won't let that rest. He won't let that go. And so their works are in the dark and they say, "Who seeth us and who knoweth us? Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as potter's clay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at that, my brother and sister. Imagine. Have any of you ever done pottery? You know, it's there. You're you're doing that and the pressure in the right place, the right amount of moisture, the right, you know, and next thing you know, you have a beautiful vase or in my case just a vase. But you look at this and see uh how can that potter's clay say, hm, why did you make me this way? &gt;&gt; Why did you do this? And how it would be that we as Christians uh would sit here today now we have challenges in our lives. We have things we bump up. I was visiting with a young man today, talking to him about the word of God, about the message of the hour. And um you know, you come to realize how Satan so cleverly makes a young man or young woman feel like they can never attain to that point. &gt;&gt; No. So Satan's trying to talk to them, trying to tell them. Uh and then on the other side, in behavior that's not acceptable by the word, God understands. So God doesn't understand on this side. He understands on this side. Amen. So it's there in that realm. We'll see. And so you know what? We're at this point right here. We're not here to question what God's done in our life, how he's brought us, the path he brought us, the struggles that we go through. But what we are here is to claim the victory over every circumstance. To claim the victory in that battle, in that challenge. Amen. And so you know it's here he shall say of him that made it he made me not. Or shall the thing framed of him that framed it he had no understanding. How many times saints maybe maybe not you but how many times we've said something to the Lord on the order of Lord you don't understand. My imagine we could say something like that and actually believe he doesn't understand. He made us. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows our every fiber, every being. And then we're going to tell him, "You made me wrong. You know, you should have made me." Well, who wouldn't say that? Just make me, you know, like this saint over here. Amen. If you're Catholic, you'd say, "Make me like Mother Teresa." You know, we'll probably find out one day. Mother Teresa had a lot more problems than anybody guessed. And so, uh, what what are we going to do? The God that framed us hath no understanding. No, I think he knows our every footstep. Amen. The every bat of our eyelash. Amen. The bat of even the flea, he knows what happened there. Amen. So, what Satan's trying to do is get us to a place we doubt ourself. And when that is a strong enough form, we actually start doubting God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we look at this. See the vision as it says in the scripture there, the vision is covered over and the book is sealed to many people. Now my brother and sister don't don't be negative on people that say the book is the book is uh the seventh seal is not open uh because they are living at the level of understanding that they have and because their understanding will only take them so far. Uh that's all the farther they can go. They can't force themselves into revelation. So the vision is covered over and the book is sealed to many people in the world today. I I I've recently have went online and just searched through different things and and uh you know, you just realize how many people that that is a great mystery to. They don't have one bit of understanding. But by God's grace, we see. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's something we ought to thank the Lord for. But Lord, by your grace, we can see this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the position of those to whom it is sealed, they stand there and say, "I cannot see it &gt;&gt; and I cannot read it. The book is closed. There's no revelation there." &gt;&gt; Now that might have been you and I uh years ago &gt;&gt; and it might be even some of our young people a stage of their life that you say, "I don't understand this." But the prophet of God said, "Pray for that revelation to come to you. Don't just sit back and do nothing. just sitting waiting for God to give it but actually pray Lord let me see what your word has for me today and when we would take that position that we are praying to have the word revealed to us God will speak to us amen I don't mean to get caught up into accounts that I have been but I've had people young people come to me and say I I just I don't know I just don't see it I don't see how it can be I I'm I'm probably going to turn away from it and and you ask Have you prayed for revelation? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So that is an important factor that every one of us here tonight should be praying for revelation. That's what the prophet of God said. Pray for revelation. It doesn't mean in our carnal flesh here that we're automatically going to see it. These are things. Amen. You can't even say Jesus is the Christ without the anointing of the Holy Ghost. So how would we see the revelation of the word without the anointing of the Holy Ghost? And so it's there that we should be praying for that and then be expecting God to answer that prayer that we would hear that. Amen. So it's it's something you know when we see this just taking this back out of the scripture a little bit the position of those to whom it is sealed. They they say the book is sealed. I can't see that. Amen. And they cannot read it. See the book is a closed book to them. And there's a good possibility that book will remain closed to them because God never promised revelation to everyone. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll say this kind of straight. Somebody people come to brother Brandham and said, "Brother Brandom, will all of our children, we believe, will all of our children be saved?" And brother Brandham doesn't run them around the bush. He just tells them, "Your children will be saved if their name is on the Lamb's book of life." Amen. So it's not some vague empty promise that somebody chases forever. and revelation of the word is not some vague empty promise that we just chase. We need to have a confidence. Lord, you said that you would reveal yourself to your bride in this day and I've already identified I am the bride and so I believe revelation is going to come to me and I'm going to be patient and wait for it right here. Amen. So many people believing they have a revelation. Amen. And they just confuse people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's interesting. I'll speak sufficiently vague here. We were in Europe and there was an individual said, "I don't want to know anything. I don't want to hear anything. I don't want to see this. It just bothers me." And uh and it was about the thunders. And I just felt pressed to push against that and to talk to her because you see the thunders in scripture are not there to confuse the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; No, not at all. The thunders are there &gt;&gt; to encourage, to strengthen, give direction to the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's to help her along in her journey. If it's flashing, does that mean the battery's low or something? No. Now it's red. Now it's green. Now it's red. Lord, give me a revelation of this thing. Okay, there we go. So, you see all of these promises in scripture, they're not there to confuse us and us to run hide from them. They are there to shine light in a portion of our lives that we can come and see absolutely who we are in Jesus Christ for us to see the greater portion of the revelation that has been poured into us. And we'll look at this now as it is the thunders doctrine. It's out there. you young people will encounter at some point in your life. Amen. The thunderous doctrine in scripture has nothing to do with raising up a great man unless that great man is Jesus Christ. Amen. God will use any voice that he wants to use. He'll use your voice. Amen. He'll use Well, I was texting with a brother and I I text him back and I said, "Well, you know, God used a donkey." And he he texts me back. I know his humor. He says, "Doesn't that make you feel good?" So, you know, it's there. God can use a donkey, my brother and sister. We can't be lifted up in our own thinking. God will use whatever he needs to convey his message. And in the hour we live in, young people. He chose to use you. He wants you to be a witness, a testimony in the in the neighborhood or in the store or wherever it might be. He wants you to do that. He's not there to keep you baffled of why why why. But it is to become something so real that you are a living testimony. Not the clay saying why did you make me thus but the clay to stand there and say thank you Lord you made me thus because there's purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's there. Now look our fear. Let me back up just a little bit. If you don't have revelation which understanding of the word and you believe you do, you are headed down a path that will lead to confusion. Amen. And so God wants us to take a hold of every word of God and we want God to give us uh wisdom to put it in its correct position. Amen. And as I said already uh I I would ask it now as a question. Has your fear or reverence been taught to you by a man or by the word? &gt;&gt; So if it's been taught to you a man, I just encourage you, whatever it would be, go back and let the Lord teach you what real reverence to the word is. &gt;&gt; And to keep that simple, the real reverence to the word is you submitting and saying amen to every word of God. There's a reverence. Amen. But you see, God didn't put that there for you to go in confusion and and just all the days of your life shy away from something that was meant to be a revelation to you, meant to give you strength, wisdom, amen, rapturing faith, all of these things. But when man gets in there and he puts a lot of woo stuff around this, people shy away from it. But what they do is they always go back to that man because he has the revelation. &gt;&gt; But God wants you to have the revelation. God's not wanting the pastor, the preacher, whatever, just to be the one with the revelation. He wants you &gt;&gt; to have that revelation. Amen. So, it's there. We We need to make sure that our reverence to the word has been taught to us by the Holy Ghost. Now, men preaching, teaching in the church will give guidance, but that real deep reverence that would take you into the holiest of holies can only come from Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we're looking at this scripture and we're realizing the carnal man is confused. He says, "Um, I don't understand it. I I can't do this." He's confused. The carnal man, if we're not careful, we will sit here, even in this church, under a carnal influence, and when we don't get it, don't see it, we just don't touch it again. &gt;&gt; That's it. And God wants us to actually get out of this flesh, get into him, come into his presence, let his Holy Spirit move down through us. And when we get in that position, God says, "I want you really, really, really to see who I am. So, I'm going to come to you and I'm going to reveal myself to you. The preacher maybe already has this revelation, but I want you to have this revelation for you to see who you are." Amen. And that's one of the issues that we see so much in schools today. Young people around the world, Belgium, Netherlands, Amen, Germany, uh, South America, they go to school and a young person doesn't really know who they are. And they get in this school and somebody starts, you know, kind of calling them names like, "You're a holy roller, you're a this, you're a that, you belong to a cult." I was just talking to a young person here just a few days ago and it was there in that case in that time that you know they come and somebody told them you're in a cult. My brother and sister, you see, you need to be prepared for that. I you don't have to be 20, 25 years old. Amen. Young sisters, amen, that are here tonight, you can be prepared for that. Amen. You're not a cult. You are the word of God expressed in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by accident. Not sitting here saying, "Lord, why did you make me thus?" But being able to rejoice that God made you a daughter of God. And when he made you a daughter of God, you've got every element. Brother Bram said, it's like you take and dip that in the ocean. You've got every element that's in the ocean is in you. And when the Holy Ghost comes down and touches your life, you've got every element of that Holy Ghost. Does that mean we have complete maturity? No. Time is what creates or makes complete maturity. The testing. Amen. So the carnal man gets confused. The spiritual man says, "Hey, this is a time for us to start on a new journey. God's taking us a new place." Now, in 2 Corinthians 4, I don't know that we need to read all of those verses, but uh therefore, seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy, we faint not, but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. &gt;&gt; And so we don't really need to go on. It's just reassurance here. Verse seven, we have this treasure in earthn vessel. That's our bodies. Amen. The excellency of the power be of God and not us. My anytime somebody stands up and and uh just was in a conversation here a few days ago and and an individual would preach something and then they would be telling others about that service and say, "I preached this phenomenal sermon." My brother and sister, they didn't do no such. &gt;&gt; If they are a son of God, they didn't preach a phenomenal sermon. They got far enough out of God's way &gt;&gt; that God used them to bring it in a phenomenal way. &gt;&gt; But you say we are mere mortals. Now in the world of talent, the carnal world of talent, some people are more gifted than others. Amen. Have a sharper mind. But you see, when we start to take credit for ourself, the prophet of God says that's when we stumble and fall. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we never want to go there and say I'm I'm becoming quite a good Christian. We just want to say the Lord is gracious to me and we are able to stand in this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I don't know why I would feel the need to hurry but um as you you can look here in that in 2 Corinthians just everything that is that is taking place there. Um, Apostle Paul says, "We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves, your servants &gt;&gt; for Jesus' sake." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness &gt;&gt; has shined in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So imagine here it is. This light in darkness, it's shining out. And we maybe are dwelling in that realm of darkness. And the light didn't just go out and disperse. God focused that light. It's the whole principle of how they in kind of you might say recognized or invented the laser. They realize that when light is focused, it's powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the gospel light is focused on us, &gt;&gt; it is powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lifechanging. Amen. Now, verse eight. I don't imagine any of you would necessarily uh relate to verse eight. Um that's always, you know, the other people. &gt;&gt; Amen. But troubled on every side yet not distressed. We are perplexed but not in despair. Persecuted but not forsaken. &gt;&gt; Cast down but not destroyed. always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest &gt;&gt; in us in our body. For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in this mortal flesh. And that sounds, you know, pretty graphic or something, but really when we get up each and every day and we just go about serving the Lord, we will find that we are fulfilling this word is coming. That we are delivered into the death, amen, of our Lord Jesus. For his sake, we're delivered. We don't have to force our way in. We don't have to try and try and figure out how to get in. But it's just that life. Amen. And when we see it, we see the life of Jesus Christ being made manifest in us. And this young man I was talking to today, he he was telling me, he says, "You know, sometimes in the past I would just get so angry." And he says, "Something's happened to me." &gt;&gt; And and now I actually have my heart goes out and I I don't want him to be angry at me and I don't want to be angry at them. I want to help them. my brother and sister, that's God working on that young man. That's God making him into a new creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. Now Daniel 12:1 I I pull this in here uh just to say that at that time shall Michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people. And there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. And that time thy people shall be delivered. everyone that shall be found written in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we don't have to worry about being deceived. We shouldn't spend our time worrying about being deceived. &gt;&gt; We need to spend our time, Amen, working out our salvation with fear and trembling to make sure that our life matches and our name would be there. Amen. So, we have this defense. I as I was reading this, I thought, man, that's awesome. We have this defense. We're standing here as believers tonight. And we have got Michael the archangel. Amen. We're not out here as a little lamb caught in the bush waiting for the wolf to to devour us. We have got heavenly beings. Angels are here in our midst and they're here to protect us and to lead us and guide us. So, you know, there's nothing like, you know, a good defense is a good offense. You hear it all the time when they talk about things like soccer and football and whatever that a good defense is a good offense. And when we get in the word, amen, which is our offense, getting in the word, it actually is our defense. And we can stand solid on that. We don't have to worry about, will God back up his word? No, God backs up his word. We don't have to be uh worried about that. Amen. So when we look at that, uh every life testifies uh of what it is. If you are in control of your life, it testifies. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost is in control of your life, &gt;&gt; it testifies. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can do like the rich young ruler and follow all of the commandments and not know Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have this promise of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. At the time thy people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book. So every man, woman, boy, girl, Amen. We need to stand up and be bold to receive our promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like distractions in the day that we live in. Satan just wants to draw us off this way, draw us off that way, uh get us uh focused on something else. A and in that all he's doing every time, he's like the pickpocket in the spiritual world and in the natural world. He's your pickpocket. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the quote faith might seem a little bit different off track here, but the Lord laid this on my heart. The astonishing thing today is the behavior, the spiritual behavior of the Christian church. How can we have faith? How can we trust God when one wants to be above the other? When one wants to be a ruler over the other? When one wants to be a little greater than the other? Have a little bigger campaign than the other. Have something. How Jesus said, "How can you have faith when you seek honor one from another?" How can you have faith when you're trying your best to pull with all your strength to be the state prespitter or the bishop or some kind of overseer? Oh, the conduct of the church is terrible. &gt;&gt; My saints, I hope that that does not apply to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, help us that we don't have some conduct behind the scenes that has, you know, jealousies and and whatever else associated with it. Amen. The conduct of the church is terrible. Trying to keep the people away from the real thing of God. How can we? It's after we have an experience with God, then we become conducted as Christians, as brethren, as men and women who know God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the only way that we can really come as it would be to judge anything around us is we need to have an experience first. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter whether we're talking offices in the church, we're talking families in the church, whatever it might be, we need to make sure that we have got our line, we're lined up. Amen. That God would be able to use us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to step on someone's toes, step on someone's fingers. Amen. &gt;&gt; If there ever was a time for us to take an account of who we are, &gt;&gt; right now is that time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We should be good examples of God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not thinking I've got more portion of God's grace than you, but to be a good example of God's grace. Amen. That means we give grace to those around us. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be examples of God's grace, to be examples of his love. And the word says this will happen in troubled times. So troubled times is not going to be our excuse. It's actually going to be something that should motivate us because we're seeing it come to pass. Amen. In the quote water baptism, Brother Bram says this, "Sister Ruth, if you'll come." And if your revelation doesn't tie and you say, "God revealed to me that I should be baptized name of Father, Son, Holy Ghost." If that don't tie in with the word in from Genesis to Revelation and tie it together, then your revelation's wrong. Yeah. You say, "God revealed to me that I should be baptized in Jesus name." If it doesn't tie in with the word, then the urum thumbum don't back it up. No matter how real it seems, this is the authentic word. This is God's urum thumb. And we'll see times when people will say, "The Lord told me to do something." And then time, it's not me, it's not you. Time proves that it really wasn't the Lord that told them to do that. &gt;&gt; And and so we'll see how sometimes people get they get all excited. They get uh focused on something and they really want it to be what God told them to do. They do their best to craft it into what God wanted them to do. But in the end, just let the revelation of who you are guide you to be what God wants you to be, where he wants you to be. Amen. Then there's no doubt in your mind, no doubt in the world around you. Satan actually doesn't even have a doubt. He might persecute you, but he doesn't have a doubt of who you really are. Amen. Isn't it good to serve the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Very simple tonight. Amen. Hope that was all right with everyone. Amen. Don't want to whine and complain, but I actually didn't feel good. I almost called you, Brother David. Yeah. Amen. 309. Amen. D. Oh, I think you will once you get started. These are troubled times, my friend. must be faithful to the end, keeping perfect peace with our Lord and satisfying all his command, striving till we reach our reward through the awesome power of his word. These are troubled times, my friend. God is in his people on again. God is in his people once again fulfilling all the promise he has said. The truth, the word, the life manifest, the wonders of his glory again in flesh, preparing for the day when we see no longer through this glass of self darkly. God is in his people once again. So we must be faithful to the end. Maybe we ought to get a real song leader. Brother Alex, brother Isaac, somebody. Amen. We'll sing it again. It's a lovely song when when you get in the right What do you call that? When you get in the right cadence or the right whatever, it flows really nice. It just didn't flow for me. Amen. But praise the Lord. He never said, "Paul, I called you to be a song leader." And I say thank you for that. Just ask brother Alex how he feels about being a song leader and you'll realize sometimes it's not too exciting. Brother Isaac, what do you think about being a song leader? Yeah.
