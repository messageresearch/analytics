you glad you serve a God the same yesterday today and forever amen I tell you it's just wonderful can we just give the Lord a hand clap of Praise today let him know how much we thank him how important he is to us how he's changed in our lives amen as as Christians we have to have something now we talk about the word of God we talk about the message we talk about being grounded and anchored this morning I want to preach to you I hopefully a little step in our thoughts but I want to just preach you on an overall thought of being rooted amen you know my brother and sister we we we read the story we hear the words you know that uh in the storm as the stress moving the tree it loosens the roots in the earth and gives them room to grow and uh if it was all just nice and easy you know a few years ago I had a friend he Farms down by the bar uh boisey River and uh the wind come up the river there and just big beautiful Majestic trees on his property and they all just blew over one right after another it's just in the natural just tragic to see these very very old trees and uh he was sharing with me and and I wouldn't say he's over religious guy but he said you know he said those trees they were by that River they didn't have to put any Roots down and when the wind come they didn't have anything to Anchor them and you know it just makes perfect sense the prophet of God talks about these things you see if life is too easy we have no root and today we're going to talk about being rooted just to look at this to realize the Reason God shakes your life sometimes or allows it to be shaken is because he wants you to be by the rivers of Living Water but he doesn't want your roots to be that deep he wants them to go very deep amen we're not rooted in this Earth We're rooted in Jesus Christ amen he knows how to bring us to that place God bless you thank you so much wonderful song service and uh our musicians uh let's um just uh uh our brother da up in kville Washington just uh uh has a couple decisions he needs to make I just ask you uh to remember him in prayer uh and uh also just like to remember there's multiple of churches in the Edmonton Alberta Canada area but let's just lift the Saints in in Edmonton up amen uh no specific need but let's just be faithful right we're part of a body part of a family amen as much as I covet your prayers um and uh and I pray for you uh we need to pray beyond our our borders as it were and and lift up this bright of Christ um now I've chosen just uh you know kind of this area cuz imagine now trying to pray for every church so sometimes the Lord just allows us to lay a little blanket of prayer over an area and that's why this morning I say pray for the Saints in Edmonton uh just lay the blanket over that area we don't even know but a handful of people there uh but God just touch each one the Believers of that area amen amen so let's turn in our Bibles this morning in the Book of Judges the 6th chapter starting with the sixth verse and um we'll just touch on a few topics this morning uh a lot of this I'll just tell you off the bat I won't I won't um I don't have a lot of quotes from this but um just been listening to the message have not I sent thee and uh I would encourage you to listen to it it's very very uh in my opinion very power packed uh sermon uh just profound brother brandham is not trying to make profound statements but it just simply is profound and so I'd encourage you to to listen to that amen judges the 6th chapter 6-14 and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midnights that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus sayith the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them from before you and gave you their land and I said said unto you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell fear not the gods of America that's right we we're not called to have fear amen God's not going to give you victory over here and leave you an abject Terror over here what's going to happen to our children God's got it in control that's right amen but I read in this scripture oh to those that are with child oh my brother and sister you either trust God or you don't amen it's time for us to just completely trust the Lord time for us to put all fears and anxieties and all questions of Tomorrow behind us and live absolute 100% in confidence that God is in control and live like it amen fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice see these words can be pretty judgmental in a sense my brother and sister he he's giving them courage uh you're dwelling in this land but don't fear but wait just a second you haven't obeyed my voice see it's you and I that let in the doubts and the fears and the trouble God does not cause it to come upon us amen now that's a two-edged sword because people will then say but what about job well I'll tell you God chose to let that hedge be open for job because job was upright and righteous that's a lot different than you and I opening the Hedge because we want to satisfy the flesh we want to satisfy our our desires our longings amen so you have to rightly divide the word of God and there came an angel of the Lord and sit under an oak which was in um ofra that pertained unto Joes the boy they couldn't they use English azerite and his son Gideon thrashed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites hiding the message amen and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thy Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him now this is really verse 13 kind of the Crux of our thought today and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with it why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites now my brother and sister I want you to look how quickly the Lord can change our situation if we just took this clip and cut right into it and that was the only portion it would sure appear that Gideon was on his way out of the message it would appear as he was ready to give up because God has forsaken us and has let this be fallen us come on let's be honest this morning how many times has circumstance come and we said Lord why did this befall me why am I now I'm a Believer why but I want you to see how quickly as we we won't read all the scripture but you go right down through the sixth chapter into the seventh and you'll see how quickly God changed Gideon's point of view I want you to never forget that when you go through a dark time when you are questioning just get in the presence of God and he will quickly change your point of view amen hallelujah delivered us into the hands of the midianites why well we'll get into that I'm preaching my sermon here and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee and I want you to remember God placed you here in this day you say but but I was born of a lineage of people that's right and God went through that lineage and said and right here is when I will deliver you placed amen Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Your Grace your mercy your kindness Lord let us come boldly before your throne today father let us come boldly not in the flesh but in the spirit Lord that we could come and walk out of this building today saying was it not good to be in the house of God today Father we thank you for your love your grace and mercy how father you have held us give us confidence to walk to live forgiven us of our shortcomings our failures father you wipe the mud from our face father when we have fallen and you do not look down upon us father you do not deride us but Lord you tell us to come boldly to your throne and father we come today trusting having confidence in your word and in the life that is contained father we thank you bless this time in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you Saints you may be seated as we look at this amen I believe it was read in the prayer requests I I guess I was a little mentally distracted but certainly remember our sister April and uh the things that's um taking place and and those that she is helping uh by God's grace the medical needs for people that have no other option so just continue to lift her up in prayer we live in a day and age my brother and sister as the scripture says there in verse 6 that Israel was greatly impoverished and we are my brother and sister living in a day a time that is spiritually impoverished it is the the goods now I think most of us would say you know I'd be happy if I had a little bit more money in the checking account or you know a little something of that uh but yet we live at least right here in this place we live in a a land and we truly are are blessed and often times we'll see how that uh denomination has kind of put an emphasis you know that you're going to have plenty of money that's God's sign of you being blessed well I'll tell you my brother and sister the sign of being blessed is having The Word Alive in our lives in our marriages in our our relationships our children uh in our church amen when we see God alive there there's where real blessing comes from and you know uh we live in a time of spiritual in in poverty uh we have more religion more churches than ever I was just watching a little uh clip of a church it's actually in akan Ohio and it was considered to be one of the original uh mega churches uh they had back in the 60s 5,000 people it was just an absolutely enormous uh uh building with all kinds of things radio station their own television stuff and it was just a place to be and as the years went on you would think you know a church that would attract that kind of attention in that many people but you know when asked why did this church uh uh uh go you know become impoverished and finally be completely abandoned and and people would come use comments like well they fell out of touch with uh uh the society they fell out of touch with um these things now I want you to understand this church would have been a huge Church in the days when the prophet of God was traveling through those areas so I I'm not pinpointing I don't believe there's anything in the message that focuses that way but I want to tell you my brother and sister that having listened to some of the sermons that were preached you would look at that and you would say well wait they were still preaching Baptist theology but still in those days good solid Theology and yet their reason is is it fell out of touch with the people but I want you to understand or use this as a a an expression today it was not so much as it were the church falling out in touch with the people but the people falling out in touch with God Amen so it's there that there was a decline you can follow that late 50s early 60s going very strong and I I hope you don't mind me making a parallel here but you know there was a time right in there that people started to declare that brother branham's Ministry was no longer relevant to the people and what did the prophet of God tell us there come a date a amen a time when it was America's last chance and and they turned it down and in turning it down they turned as it were a corner uh and and they turned away from God and and it wasn't just as it was touching brother bram's Ministry but you look and so this got me all kind of picked in my interest and I started searching uh out a few of churches that would be you might say in the same position and you can build or correlate a reaction across many churches in that time that they said were no longer relevant to the people but I tell you my brother and sister as we have by God's grace and mercy a Clear Vision into this we realize that when America turned that corner and turned down God it wasn't just a message it wasn't just a prophet's Ministry but it was a spirit that would have rolled like a fog as it were across the land and people said we got better things to do with our time than devote it to this we've got this God understands we can serve God however we want to but my brother and sister as we'll look today I I just wanted to preface it with that we'll look today and we'll see how that Israel amen God said I'll deliver you I'll provide for you I'll do this but yet the Judgment comes and says you know what you didn't do my word you did not follow my word you did not do what you were supposed to do amen and it's there that that they are are judging this as though God had forsaken them when the real reality is they forsook God oh God that Spirit can be so easy and creep in Even in our midst saints that we can be so preoccupied with life that if we're not careful we would be guilty I don't think that Israel got up one morning and said we're just going to turn away from God I believe it was so gradual they didn't even recognize the course change of their own life the course change of God's promised people and they changed the course and it become about them and about convenience and about all of the little things that made their life easier until they literally come and said well God you forsook us to let the midianites punish us my brother and sister they were punishing themselves if you want to be honest you want to look at and realize that they themselves were the ones that were hindering their own life because of the refusal to be obedient to the word of God and I lift my hand this morning and say Lord forgive me amen I want to be obedient to your voice I do not want another voice to come in and turn me from your word amen and how it led them a time that they were impoverished and they blamed it on the midianites but my brother and sister as we'll touch on this I'm going to I don't want to get ahead of myself I want to just stay in line here amen but look at this now an age that's spiritually impoverished but we have more religion more churches than ever amen I think I shared this in the Pulpit that uh uh people identifying as Christians and and what not is declining but yet there are more people that are connected to things that churches are more like clubs amen did the prophet of God uh he called them lodges we're seeing it fulfilled in this day Church good daycare good entertainment good sports League good social structure soft on the gospel but wait that's what the people want I'll feel welcome in Grace Tabernacle Saints when you have coffee and donuts in the foyer and I'll feel more comfortable when you have somebody out in the parking lot to open my car door for me and greet me to the service see not looking for good straight identifiable things that will get us in a Rapture but they're looking to what makes them feel good and and they call that unnecessary to grow your church well my brother and sister I don't care how many you have in numbers if they're all going to hell and pardon me for saying it that blunt if you're going to go with 10,000 people to hell my brother and sister it doesn't matter but I tell you I want to come be handin hand bonded together if there would be only one that was going to go for the Rapture let me be bonded to that one let us be bonded by the word of God together it's lonely it's lonely but the Lord said I'll be your peace I'll be your comforter he didn't say I'll give you thousands or tens of thousands to people to warm you up our brother step Hit Upon that and I I like that my brother and sister we can be lonely in the crowd but remember God called you out of the crowd you're not part of that crowd that crowd is not who you are we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen and the crowd sometimes is a false security we feel lonely in the crowd but we also feel safe in the crowd come on I I know I could give you a name of a brother who went to a church that you would know the name of very very well may know the church very very well and he went there and it wasn't until he left that church and ended up living with his family in a small Church where when you was preaching you thought the preacher was looking well it must have been a church about this size it appeared the preacher was looking at you and he said that's when I got a real experience with God because I couldn't hide when the preacher preached hard I I couldn't duck and it just get somebody else cuz everybody in the church would be like why are you ducking that must have been for you stand up and receive it but in that crowd you could hide but we're not here to hide amen Gideon you know the the the verses there in judges those coming down Gideon's hiding under the tree behind the rock of and by the wine press he's hiding to thrash out his wheat because that's the only way he has any security and did not realize this off topic but did not realize the whole time that God possessed The Rock he was hiding behind it was there that God said I'm going to come and meet you there Gideon in the day appointed and I'm going to give you a courage bowl like you never had before and in that my brother and sister impoverished and blaming it on the midianites but God come down and expose to Gideon his own weakness it never had anything to do with a midianite it was him himself unable to fully grasp all of the word for him in his day my brother and sister I should say for his family and him in his day but God in a few simple words he doesn't call him a coward he doesn't berate him he doesn't kick him out seat of the pants he says what I want you to do is start getting things right go bring me an offering we need to bring an offering I want to ask you today is the offering I'm talking about God God Abraham Lincoln on it or or you know George Washington or whatever it is my brother and sister no the offering he's wanting us to bring today and lay on the Rock is you and I and if we'll come and lay it on we'll find a courage bold like we never had before it will cause us to see the word in such an entirely different fashion amen you know we're living in an age and I'm just as guilty maybe more so than many of you we have more possessions than ever before and less peace why do we buy more stuff you say I need it no you don't amen you know we could go in a lot of avenues there we'll move on we have more knowledge of God but less relationship we can explain he was speaking in aramic here and maybe a word or two in the Greek and and this and then we can break this all down and and how this all worked and the motive and the reason behind it but we don't even know him so we're speaking for someone we don't even know well I tell you my brother and sister that just doesn't work and I say today I believe it's very parallel this why I'm preaching this I believe it's very parallel to the Book of Judges right here of what has happened and and we see Gideon in this position a lot of things he's talking about a God that has forsaken them you know what that tells you now my sound like I'm hammering on Gideon but my brother and sister this is actually you and I hid in the word right here and Gideon's saying God's forsaken me he's talking to God and he's telling him you've forsaken me but the truth of it is if they had followed God's word they wouldn't be under the leadership of the midianites god never forsook them they forsake forsook Him amen and you'll look I don't want to be labor that but you'll look at this my brother and sister what is happening amen and in seasons of preparation I don't know you know uh we all are in different stages right you go to school uh to learn things and then you go to advanced classes to you know learn about computers and and Technologies and mechanics and whatever it is and and sometimes we can learn on the job uh sometimes you have to have you know the the diploma but it's in times of preparation my brother and sister that prepares you actually for your future amen now my brother and sister so often we hear this in the world today they're like well you know uh don't judge me well I'll tell you my brother and sister that's good I I I'm actually a no judge person just have courage enough amen I I don't want to use my Idaho English have guts enough to judge yourself but when judgment appears we use this deal don't judge me don't judge me my life's a mess and and I I'm I'm happy with it but it's not my fault God's forsaken me I asked God to do this this this and this and it never happened so therefore it's not my fault it's God's fault my brother and sister God dealt with Gideon very directly and if we are Sons and Daughters of God he's going to deal with you and I very directly let's have enough courage to stand up and sayl you're right you're right I need to change my thinking you see God wasn't there to condemn Gideon he was there to change Gideon's thinking which in context was not change his mind but to change his heart and when God comes on the scene and starts to change a heart my brother and sister we sing the song I'm no longer a slave to fear amen my brother and sister we'll be no no longer a slave to our emotion our intellect our understanding but surrendered completely to the Lord to say Lord you're in control I want to ask you is that easy or hard it's hard it can be really hard amen so we look at this people feel as though God is judging them or people feel forsaken but will they when you come and present the antidote that's it receive it the prophet of God hits it once again here that's not what our church teaches and your church is all in the same condition you are Hallelujah hope I don't offend anybody but that's like saying I use honey because it's natural sweetener on my corn flakes still an empty diet John 3:16 God loves the whole world but a prophet laid it out very clearly the whole world doesn't love God and then they want to say God forsook us see how Satan has just convoluted this he's mixed it all up that we have problems we go out get paid spend all the money on junk and then say why can't can't the Lord provide we don't have groceries in our house come on my brother and sister have discipline have discipline amen yes stewardship so you know in the seasons of preparation people feel as though God is judging them or they feel forsaken but I tell you I want you this morning uh for the sake of time we we have limited this down but when you feel forsaken I want you to replace the thought of forsaken in your mind and replace it with preparation God has not forsaken me God is preparing me for something greater I must go through battle I must go through struggle I must go through strain I must come to the very borderline of defeat but God is actually teaching me how to be a real Soldier amen I tell you what I I remember many years ago just out of Interest sake uh there was a time in my life I come just whisker close to going in the military and um some ways it would have been good for me um but looking in some ways I'm glad I never but my brother and sister you know uh you can see him now just I don't know how much you've looked into this but you know they pull up to Paris Island and and the the recruits get off the bus and you know they hand them A coffee a soda Popa donut and they ask him if they will please come over here and stand in this certain spot yo get off there hustle test out get I said stand right there get your feet together and they're just like oh oh oh yeah yeah they can't touch them anymore but boy they can sure verbally touch them and these young men in this certain video here's this young man his own they allowed him to be interviewed and and he joined the army one to be in the Army wanted to be like Special Forces and wanted to be one of the best and he started a year before he actually went into the army doing push-ups and running and carrying Rock sacks full of rocks and he was just hard as a rock and and he had long hair during that time and he goes and he gets a haircut which he thought ah they won't cut my hair now and so as he's there you know the only problem he had he wasn't very good at listening he didn't train he had this body was Rock Solid just like I can do this but he never attuned his ears and that drill sergeant starts in on him and he does and he he basically brutalizes this young man and everything the young man does and finally one day he feels the drill sergeant feels sorry for this young man and he calls him to the side and this young man's terrified what are they going to do to me now and he just in very blunt language son if you'll just listen and do what I tell you I thought I was Sir no you studied too much Army before you got in the Army and you are in the army of your own thinking that young man pondered it and in the end of the deal he said you know some of the shame that come I had paid you know this back a few years but he had paid top dollar for the perfect haircut and when he's going through the line the man cutting hair you know I don't know if he was just Discerning of it or was revenge or what but it's there he said and as I was there the guy takes off the little deal and he said it was about that thick and he puts on one that was about that thick and I thought he was peeling my head and then the guy smiles at him and says now you've got an army haircut now my brother and sister it appeared that this young man was doing everything correct but it's not correct until it's like God wants it that's it to be right not me just fitting inside I believe God sent a prophet amen the devil believes that that's right amen there's a lot of people whose lives well I'm just going to be blunt this morning if you don't mind their lives stink and they believe God sent a prophet amen is that too blunt amen hallelujah brother Chris preached Wednesday night said if you guys just knew what my day was like well let me just tell you if you knew what my Saturday was like you would have said let's get somebody a little happier to preach on Sunday but I tell you my brother and sister what it is it's not what we are judging Gideon was looking at the whole situation saying this is what God did and this is what God done and this is never looking at himself but God come down God rich in Mercy can somebody say that this morning God rich in Mercy come down and said Gideon I'm going to change your point of view I'm going to get you to look at my word and look at this whole situation in a different light and when Gideon I'm jumping ahead of myself but when Gideon realized that that rock right there was Christ was right in his very midst the whole time cuz the fire it was not a magician's trick the fire come from The Rock Amen and when you realize the rock is with us the rock is present we don't have to look in history to find God in the rock my brother and sister he's right here this morning in our presence amen and we'll see this time of preparation don't think forsaken think preparation God's got an army aren't you glad to be in that Army amen if my hair needs to be long Let It Be Long if my hair needs to be short let it be short if I need to be proper respectful present myself in a certain way man or woman brother or sister then Lord let me find the balance on that I can present myself you want more out of me Lord I'm not going to complain I'll give you more and amen because I am I recognize I am what the I am said I am amen I'm not of this world I'm not of Leo deia I am the bride of Christ that's what my Bible says amen that's when I hear when I hear the message I'm not a buzzard my brother and sister I'm an eagle Can someone say Amen this morning I'm not a buzzard I won't look at the word as though God's calling me a buzzard I look at an eagle that's being taught to fly being taught well start with right got to eat the meat amen then you got to grow some feathers and you got to learn to fly and then you got to learn to feed yourself not Buzzard food amen not carrying meat not milk meat am I preaching too hard to you this morning he amen hallelujah you know think preparation great battle coming and we can see the angel of the Lord which brother Brown says in this sermon was God himself now Gideon while you're hiding behind this Rock Amen you're going into Warfare Gideon what I need you to do is just start simple 25 push-ups and the branch on this tree you're under while you're hiding behind the rock just start with 20 five chinups and then you need to find the heaviest sword you can find and start swinging that thing cuz there certain muscles that are contained with swinging this sword and then Gideon I need you to just start being bold did you remember reading that just as I am without one please some spiritual muscle was necessary maybe something on the order of I can I will I do believe I can I will I do believe you see the Lord's dealing with Gideon and he's preparing him amen what was he doing now often times we want to be so spiritual that we think the state of our mind has nothing to do with it but I'll tell you my brother and sister it has a lot to do with it you come with a state of mind that says that's God's word I'm going to say Amen to it that state of mind even in your darkest moments will cause you to say that's God's word and I'll say Amen to it or if you're over here with a nice little theological point of view we'll be saying well I I don't know if that's the correct interpretation amen there's this Theologian over here that says this and there's one that says this and there's another one that proves the fault of this one and you know oh lamza he had this idea you know and scoffield had this idea I don't know where I stand I think I'll get the one that puts it into modernday water down theology cuz I feel better when I read it then you have preachers stand up and say well praise God in this church he's talking to a couple thousand people any translation of the Bible is good enough for us said the devil but what was God doing he was taking Gideon back remember Gideon I delivered you guys out of Egypt remember Gideon I did this remember Gideon I did this maybe it would do us good you know often times we're so forward thinking maybe it would be good maybe we could stop preaching preaching right now and just stop now you guys might think I'm off my rocker but I think if we really had prayed up before we come to church and we stopped right now and started thinking about what just what God has done we're talking past tense we would be in the altar weeping to think that God loved us so much that he took us through this brought us over here wouldn't allow us to be deceived here give us courage when we were weak and brought us I think we'd fill an altar up of people saying thank you Lord for what you've done for me I was lost but now I'm found I had no understanding but you've given me Revelation I had bitterness in my heart and no love and you've come taken the bitterness and place love down in my life amen come on Saints maybe I'm either crazy or off my rocker but I'm telling you it really should impact us but instead we're say I leave the past in the past we are so spiritual we've moved on into Revelation one of those Revelation is is you need God Amen you need a liberal dose of the Holy Ghost cuz that old Spirit of bitterness that's is just outside the door amen that old Spirit of temper just outside the door go ahead and run the alphab in your own mind of what these things would be and he delivered you amen he called you from that that should be sufficient enough in every day of our life to get up in the morning and say thank you Lord thank you Lord for what you brought me from Lord I know you got higher Heights for me you've got greater things for me Lord but I'm telling you this morning thank you for what you've done instead we get so spiritual we forget what we were and we're trying so hard to become something we think we are that's and when I say that you'd say well aren't we the bride of Christ yes but I want to know do we have a clear picture of what the bride is that's it no no I'm not preaching to you sisters about being in subjection but the bride does just as Jesus said I only do what my father shows me amen the bride of Christ little different verbiage I only do what my husband amen shows me amen one of the greatest challenges is Spirit of the age I tell you what there's nothing like being around natural people that you know and the man making a comment and the wife cutting him off and telling him you're wrong and this is how the cow eat the cabbage and then watch a man that could pick me up bust me like a twig get just embarrassed cow toow back out of that conversation that's the spirit of leod deia let's not let that spirit in the church let's not live our spiritual life amen trying to tell God how to do this but to be submitted and say Lord if you want me to how you want me to be take it in the spiritual sense I'm not talking the natural you can take it in the natural your ownself we should know amen but we got to get in the right state of mind and that's a state of mind where no matter how this amalgamation of several things I've studied in the last few days H but we got to come to the place that if God says yes we say thank you Lord and if he says no we say thank you Lord if he says the timing's not right then we say Lord show me when the time is right and if he says never then we say Lord never that's right or we can have a balum spirit say Now list God said no but I didn't word it like this okay now now um I'm coming around here like this and you know um Israel's been backslid you know there's some backslid people in Grace Tabernacle so we should just preach to everybody that you're going to hell Bo I'm encouraged cuz if I preach that everyone's going to go in the Rapture some people are going to think their life is just just fine the Book of Judges has already been written and God will let us know if he wants us to be the judge but the word preached in truth is God's judg amen amen you see not me thinking poor Titus Titus you would have looked like a nice Christian young man if you to use that glue stuff it gets that silly Saints and I'm presenting it to you in that silly fashion I don't know the wife probably wasn't very happy with me we were up there in Canada you know and I was joking to the young people about come on what do we have for church and I said you know oh oh the sister has heels here uh well um anyway we don't have our heal automatic heel measuring and cutting device installed yet so you don't need a deacon or preacher to judgey you just walk into church stand on the two Footprints and the light's either green or it's red and if it's red it clamps down on your shoe and and then you can walk into church okay is that the gospel that we have is that what God did with with Gideon no God comes Gideon hiding not bold as a Believer hiding and he says oh mighty man of Val oh Mighty Man Valor Gideon's like whoo that's the wrong guy yeah you're not talking and God doesn't give up there and say yeah maybe I did what God does he starts telling Gideon how he's going to lead the people and I want to tell you it's in the right context okay don't take this out of context but every one of you has been called to be a leader amen every one of us has influence on someone around us make a difference in their life God's not going to come and cut us down and pound us to dirt and then try to build us up in the sense of oh look see now that's how it's done because in the human element we'll take that and apply it to the next person and the next person now don't mistake this for hearing the gospel preached okay well the preacher can't preach hard because no no no get that out of your mind this is how God comes and deals at the right time and the right place to cause each one of us to realize there's more in me Gideon walked out of that experience rooted he wasn't like should I hide from the midianites no God said you're going to lead the people and you're going to overcome the enemy you're going to do what my word said I chose you Gideon and I want to say this morning with a boldness God chose you this morning to walk out with a boldness to show the world how to overcome the spirits of this age how to be an overcomer without it being a judgmental I remember as young man you got to love this amen I I remember as a young man you know the preaching that we grew up in and we're one time sitting I was working doing construction work with a brother we're sitting in a cafe and a a man comes in that he knew it and before the conversation's over the man I was with has told this guy you got to repent or perish or serpent seed you're going to hell and I'm just sitting there with my eyelashes and and just everything is just smoldering I'm just like wow I might just go around the other side of this booth and sit down on his side and say who are you but you see God didn't do that but he brought Gideon to a place that when Gideon finally stood before the people they didn't see Gideon The Hider they saw Gideon a mighty man of Valor enough so that they said we'll follow this man when he says we'll do and I'm ahead of myself and way off track but let me tell you it not fun it not fun it not fun it not fun yes anyway okay it's not fun imagine how Gideon felt after you might say recruiting all of these men and they get down to the brook did he say you're not worthy no but he had to have the courage to tell him you're not passing the test dividing division's never fun till you've stood in the pulpit and you've you've had to preach things that were very very hard very straight you don't know the feeling of what it is to know this is going to hurt these people's feelings but remember did Gideon do the dividing God did the dividing but Gideon rooted in God's promise the people saw this was necessary and Gideon himself no doubt said Lord why this guy right here is way better with a spear than I am this guy's way better with a sword than I am this guy's right here more mentally tough and more physically tough than I and God said no no I want the people that I want amen I want the people that are going to be able to do what I ask him to stand in that spot amen hallelujah now the thinning of the ranks depresses us let's be honest and maybe if it doesn't depress you I I'll just stand before you and say it depresses me when I see people leave the church especially leave serving the lord it just house this just very hard I feel beaten feeling over this but then we realize right here in scripture we see a time that God says you know what we got to thin this now brother Brown says uh in the sermon have not I sent thee he says then after he got ready to act he gave him so many thousand he says there's too many cowards in here that's prettyy straight talk just kept on kept on hone them down cuz he got them that was that God had called for see that's what God was looking for my brother and sister we're not going to decide oursel who is and who isn't you're not rooted in the word you're out my brother and sister their season of rooting might well be right there at the very threshold and we would judging the flesh they're not solid not our job let God do the thing let the word do the thinning see sometimes when we see things going wrong dropping off maybe as God is just getting an army ready that's all well the prophet of God didn't you say something about like after you've had to build two or three new churches because you've outgrown them all that that's a sign that God's present No in fact the prophet of God said you'll see him shrink that's right scriptural type right here here see it shrink cuz God's getting those he wants ready amen some don't want to be ready some studied how to be in the Army and they want the Army to be like they thought it should be praise the Lord let me read that again sometimes when we see things going wrong dropping off maybe God is just getting an army ready that's all or some Fighters ready you can never tell God he was ready to act amen now this talking about back Gideon he was ready to act and when he saw the Living Word of God he was ready to act upon it amen amen that's the kind of people that God's looking for he's looking for the Gideon type of people that are going to say if this is what God wants us to do here's the word I know it's the word I've Vindicated it I've proven it in the word act on it amen but what about tomorrow let God take care of tomorrow amen when you when we see God living in his word then let's be ready to act upon it imagine showing up to a fight in those days they didn't bring a spear a bow a sword they've got a beach unella and a container hey Gideon I heard you're taking us down by the river yeah I don't think you're one of them that we that was called amen how come our church doesn't have a fellowship every Sunday how come we don't this how come we don't that why what Warfare are you in what Warfare come on what Warfare but we see God living in his word I I I just you lift your hands if you want to but I want to ask you have you seen God living in his word amen when you see God living in his word then let's be ready that means you and I we see him living let you and I be ready that's our part amen hallelujah I can see some of you almost looking at me like oh man Paul I wanted to be preached happy today you know what happened when I told Brother Steven to preach us happy on Sunday morning he just laughed at me and Saidi going to preach what God showed me yeah I think that was the right result but you see I was right also because I knew if he preached what God showed him I would be happy amen right I did have a problem with his deal about you know being in the spirit meaning you had moved to Arizona I have to admit I had a problem with that Doctrine but anyway we'll overcome that so Gideon speaking these words where are all the Miracles where's all the Miracles do any of you have a challenge in your life I want to ask you is there any Giants that roam around your neighborhood H come on can we be honest with ourselves we got Giants in our neighborhood amen the challenges of our day yes you know what Satan wants you to do he wants you to forget all the Giants he's already taken care of as though this new giant is greater than any giant you ever faced and I heard a brother preach it this way once he said well you know as we get closer to the Rapture the Giants are getting bigger and that he just leaves it that and goes on and I felt like saying you know what if the Giant's getting bigger my faith is even bigger than it was before because there's no way this leodan Giant's going to be bigger than my faith amen so if you want to say the Giants are bigger than ever well my brother and sister the prophet of God said it's the same spirits come on think about it same Spirits doesn't say they're greater just says there's more of them right right so it's not the the giant is not any bigger than Goliath was there's just more Goliath in the land but hey we already defeated Goliath amen we did are you with me we already defeated Goliath amen and if another one shows up tomorrow morning and he probably will amen you'll defeat him too and he might show up tomorrow afternoon and you'll defeat him also amen and nothing will change because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world means that you are a giant slayer not one giant not two giants every giant amen hallelujah see now look here as we go forward amen the challenges of our days what Satan's trying to do is get you to forget what God's already done for you what I what I brought out to you before I I feel that strongly in my heart I don't live in the past or do my very best not to live in the past but you see I don't want to forget where I came from I don't dwell on what happened when I came from Egypt but I want to remember and never forget there was a time in my life I lived Like An Egyptian but I'm not an Egyptian and I'm not going back to Egypt and I'm not going to hold on to the tradition and the culture of Egypt I have a Promised Land it takes a promised people to occupy a Promised Land amen hallelujah well you know I'm getting off track here but look what happened my brother and sister every time Israel was supposed to kill everything in the land and they felt sorry for that cute little baby now don't go into your Humanity go don't go into How could somebody have have have done that my brother and sister I want you to take that bring that forward let's make it simple I don't want to explain it make it simple when the Devil comes and he puts a little something on us God comes starts dealing with us well you know the only time I lie is when money's involved personal relationships never would lie things of this and things of that never would lie but I pay tithes on my profits silly analogy isn't it God said every Giant in your life giant over money giant over temper giant over whatever it is he said slay everything in the land amen and the reason is is we don't my brother and sister you go for I I dealt with a brother visiting Minister sometimes you wonder why don't they talk talked to a pastor about it I dealt with a brother and he said brother Paul what you preached today in the service he said just I know it was just for me I thought 25 years ago I had overcome this certain issue and he said just a few weeks ago there it is now I'm you know me I'm not overly right I'd say just about everybody in this room smarter than I am but there are a few things the Lord teaches you that's right and my first question was brother when that came back what did you do oh he said I wept and I wept I thought Lord all these years I haven't had the Holy Ghost go back into the principles the prophet teaches us the birds are flying over do you figure out how to keep all the birds from flying over no you find something to keep them from building that's right a nest amen amen I said the only problem you had brother is you was so confident in your flesh you forgot to take and wave that to keep them from building the nest and when you were out there saying now Birds can't build Nest I'm I've overcome this no sir can anybody relate to that Lord help me I got to keep it handy though you know when I get home from vacation I'll go find my Bible and wave it over my head no you you better take it on vacation with you you better take it on work with you you better take it on whatever with you now that way when those birds come flying over you can just say Lord that's just the devil and I know it is and so over this Temple of the Holy Ghost I apply the word here's the blood here's the blood now I'm off track and time is waning amen hallelujah I want to ask you what kind of Miracles you know uh Gideon said you know and where's all the Miracles I want to ask you what kind of Miracles are you looking for well we're looking for some speaking in tongues well that's not really a miracle but kind of fits in there for most people CU it's a miracle if they ever did speak in tongues uh but um oh oh we're looking for this and we're looking for this and we're looking for this do you know that a miracle can be what you oh somebody will choke on this a miracle can be what you want it to be cuz if you don't think so my brother and sister I've seen people that live like the devil but fell over speaking tongues and it's a miracle and they just live like the devil and say this is the Holy Ghost it's a miracle they can't figure that out it's a miracle he says where's all the Miracles our fathers told us Young People sisters young ladies young men you're going to hear us talk about this message being the truth going to talk about how it changed our lives and you might look at us you might look at your parents you might look at me as pastor and say well sometimes you know they this grumpy and this and that and whatever the deal is you know uh what what what kind of Miracle is this but you see what it's got to come down to of the miracle of you and Christ amen my brother and sister you see there's Miracles already taking place around us and you say well what is it well I'll tell you what it is it might not be the kind of miracle that a lot of Believers are looking for but when the Devil comes in like a flood why are you you still standing in an age that there's nothing but corruption and demons around us and he comes in like a flood why are you still standing it's a miracle amen the devil would like to light you on fire isn't interesting God Drew these right out of out of the Old Testament brought them right into our day when the devil would like to light you on fire and we live in an age that being lit on fire is not too hard amen but what happens he comes and he quenches every fiery Dart of the enemy and we stand here right here a miracle that we're not burnt up right a miracle that the spirit of leoa has not burnt us up amen hallelujah so Miracles are taking place amen hallelujah the Lord meeting you in that fiery trial you see unbelief opens the door to defeat I didn't bring the quote and it's on my phone but I I didn't bring it out here but I tell you what my brother and sister you talk about the tomb so many things that come out of that the prophet of God using an analogy and bringing this out of the Tomb my brother and sister and he says God would like to get in there this paraphrasing like God would like to get in there but you have to roll the stone back wait I want God to roll the stone back and deliver me no you got to roll the stone back for him to get in you can't bar the door that's right right Amen brother brandham says the same sermon he said talking about Noah uh here again I'm paraphrasing it you must have an action to see the word in action Noah had to build an ark and the building of the Ark and the completion of the Ark was actually part of the time piece of the rainf falling in other words you're not going to see the bright of Christ behold the bridegroom cometh well time for a prayer meeting time to get this time to get that got to put these clothes in got to get these in the bag got to no my brother and sister the bride's going to say behold praise the Lord amen I've been waiting for him he's coming and action then brings the word in action amen cu the word says that that that foolish virgin she runs off trying to find oil you imagine Midnight Hour knocking on the door do you guys have any oil take it from scripture sorry I'm my kids are in bed my wife is in bed and I'm in bed go to the one on the corner that guy doesn't even answer run to another one running to and fro trying to find the oil but what happens with the real bride behold the bridegroom come now I hope you don't mind but I think there'll be just a few people that grab their bag and get out the door headed down the walk Hallelujah he's coming praise God Amen the Rapture is finally taking place I'm so excited the Rapture is taking place I've lived my life for this and the others are running around friendly got any oil I need oil please share somebody aren't you real Christians real Christians would share their oil real Christians have oil amen they're not running around looking for oil Hallelujah you know I could get this Plum carried away this morning I got enough notes to bury the ark amen much less fill it but now look at this so brother Brown says that the word must have you must have an action to see the word in action so God's timing perfect and I want to use a counter type there lot and his family dragging themselves out of Sodom seriously I can't go to the mountain there's fire there you know what he was saying I'm afraid of the Holy Ghost I'm afraid of that fire that's right otherwise he should have said why didn't I think of that come on family to the mountain we go I want to know Brothers those of you got family sisters family are we afraid of the fire I hope not let's run to the fire let's get our children let them see this fire is good this fire is good see it didn't bless them by dragging their feet okay I got to I got to stop here I smell somebody's toast burning want to know uh Miracle What miracles in our day are we seeing Miracle Saints yes sir you know what a miracle is I should challenge y'all to go look it up and then ask you next Sunday if you actually did or not but Miracle is Supernatural but it's also an extraordinary and welcomed event I came to church this morning happy to be in the church today extraordinarily happy to be in church today praise God I just witnessed a miracle did any of you witness a miracle this morning extraordinarily happy to be in the house of God might change our point of view right might change our point of of you h i could elaborate here but I want to do but let me just throw this out it's not about fishes and loav Saints it's not about it's not about plain simple I think about what brother Adrian preached to us if we're not eating the whole word of God we we're missing it you might say Brother Paul's not not preaching anything of depth today he's just hitting on all these little highlights well you know my brother and sister them fragments that those people picked up at Jesus command they didn't look like much did they till they came to the right person that said that's what I'm looking for that's what I need that's the word that's been missing because I'll tell you our our family's own own deal the Methodist Church back in those days when my parents come in the message the Methodist Church back in them days days preached the word pretty straight but they didn't have the fragment that made the difference and that fragment come to my mom and dad and they said this is so good it's what we were looking [Music] for it's about the word on time everpresent water now look at this the prophet of God's talking he says you know what I come to tie up the Loose Ends the modern critic says he plagiarized Spurgeon he plagiarized this brother he plagiarized that brother well if they had tied the loose ends up nothing would have had to been done about it h come on he started tying the loose ends up and so as it is is he starts to move it now remember how our our brother Steven I I I really really enjoyed his service and um I'm going to I'm going to tell on somebody they'll probably be very mad at me for telling it but somebody in my family's phone identified them as a cactus and a picture of them as a cactus and um you know we just decided bro Steven was preaching to them even their phone confirmed it Cactus H but I realized as I sat here and listened to brother Steven preached the other day I was starting to show some attributes of a cactus very sticky not much bloom in my life [Music] amen amen amen amen why is it the point that he talked about a cactus in the sticker and the flower no it's the Holy Spirit allowing us to recognize that we're going there he showed us so that we could turn back from that and Pray For Rain spiritual rain in our lives we get dried up nobody's Mama's not going to tell you you know honey you you sure you're acting like this you don't know what you're talking about mom well you're nope don't even I'm done with this conversation but when the Holy Spirit comes down and says consider your way right we respond to it and God then opens the door to us okay I'm going to cut this off here but you know our brother Steven preached a about the desert did you guys enjoy his preaching I I I I've already hinted to him we'd like him to come back uh somewhere down the road maybe bring and see how was that brother Chris I don't know any other families in the church want to join the five Club anyway but you know I thought it was I thought it was very good but you see my brother and sister it all depends on where you're planted I want to ask you do you want to bloom every 10 12 years or would you like to bloom every day being planted by the river of Living Water not shallow rooted to be blowed over in the storm many of you won't remember but the time where the juwel stood right here in this pulpit and said I never pray for patients well I remember being bold enough to say brother Jewel you should he goes I know that brother Paul but still it's hard you're going to have the test anyhow submit to it now I'm going to ask you how many of you'd lift a hand and say Lord let the storm of Life come and shake me that my roots would go deeper amen amen amen come on your sons and Daughters of God the storm's going to come anyhow you might as well be there saying Lord prepare me because it's all in the preparation amen I've taken so much time and I actually didn't realize I had this many notes um anyway I just want to uh read one more quote if you don't mind um paragraph 162 brother Gideon um and when God plants his promise in you and it becomes a living reality then something is different right you don't just go and say yes I believe it now that's all right the devil believes it like that but it's confirmed to you and the word becomes alive in you amen then you begin to see what it is Lord plant me by the river of Living Water Let It Be something I see and let it be alive in me can we lift a hand and say Lord Let It Be Alive in me amen I don't want I don't want to just be a dead Creed I don't want to be a a good reciter you know of of the message you know I didn't realize you can do this with a phone but you know you can take a iPhone uh and um you you can get a app or whatever on it and so if you're in Paris you you can you know speak in your phone and uh say uh uh good I want to go to a good restaurant and then and you can give it up to somebody and it will be sister Alice give me your best French I I don't even know about all I know in French is monz and I didn't even say that right you know take me to a good restaurant sorry I don't speak English sorry I didn't no it don't ask you those questions it don't care what you are it brings back what was spoken and he said you were mine before the foundation of the world I don't care what your language is I know what my language is and and God spoke to Gideon a language of Faith amen and he responded to the language of Faith amen musicians if you'd come you know I I thought it was interesting when I come across this little deal did you know catch this concept here the leaves of a tree seed the cloudy day they feel the windy day they feel the heat but the roots they don't feel any of that and when we are rooted in Jesus Christ your feelings how messed up life is none of that is an influence because you are rooted in amen amen want to be rooted Hallelujah God bless you Saints oh let's see all these songs amen let's sing that song Set Your Wings To The Winds of Faith amen I don't even know I didn't have any numbers yeah Hallelujah let's just stand church amen I hope it didn't bore any of you to death this morning amen we can't always you know come across like brother Donnie brother Danny or whoever sometimes you know sometimes you just feel like look I got to somehow just convey this thought I hope that something touched you today amen we can see where are we rooted if we're rooted in Leo deia our reward will be le oysa more of leod deia if it's rooted in our own abilities our own Talent our own perceptions that's all we get back amen CU you can't put an oak tree out there as brother Steven preached you can't put an oak tree out there in the desert you can't do it they'll survive in the desert where there's water any of you familiar with Oak Creek Canyon yeah sedone Arizona yeah I won't tell you about all my memories of Oak Creek but I'll tell you what my brother and sister you don't have to go very far south or down from Oak Creek and only thing you'll find growing there I don't know what those Jers or something scrub Scrub but you get in that right atmosphere there's these giant beautiful oak trees and they are just enormous I remember as a kid even that they had said how
