[22:34] his holy days
[22:43] [Music]
[22:52] [Music]
[23:09] [Music]
[23:24] [Music]
[23:34] is
[23:37] [Music]
[23:45] he is
[23:50] [Music]
[24:02] is
[24:05] [Music]
[24:10] amen he
[24:12] is here
[24:20] [Music]
[24:30] just
[24:44] is
[24:52] amen good to see each one of you tonight
[24:54] amen
[24:57] quite a few of us missing tonight so we
[24:59] just ask the lord whatever
[25:01] circumstance might be just to go and be
[25:04] with our brothers and sisters just to
[25:08] strengthen them you know it's always
[25:10] nice when the presence of the lord comes
[25:12] around us
[25:13] you know you might be at work you might
[25:15] be in the car whatever it might be
[25:17] and and when that presence comes and
[25:20] settles around us there's just
[25:22] a comfort just a peace that comes
[25:25] and that is so beautiful so we just ask
[25:27] that for our brothers and sisters this
[25:29] evening
[25:30] the lord would just come and settle in
[25:33] around
[25:33] each and every one in their homes or
[25:35] wherever they might be tonight so
[25:38] let's just stand as we'd go into the
[25:39] word of god i just
[25:41] want to you know as i've been reading
[25:43] and looking through the
[25:45] book of proverbs it's just been
[25:48] encouraging to me
[25:49] actually uh just to be reminded of these
[25:52] things
[25:53] to to stir our hearts in remembrance and
[25:56] thank you
[25:57] uh brothers and sisters for uh the music
[26:01] amen it's always good set an atmosphere
[26:05] and so i would just like us to turn in
[26:07] proverbs 13 tonight and
[26:10] you know my title is not necessarily
[26:14] directly reflected in our thought
[26:16] tonight
[26:17] but it does tie into a verse of which we
[26:20] will make emphasis
[26:21] on but aren't you glad tonight that your
[26:24] hope is steadfast in the lord
[26:26] amen we're not wavering to and fro and
[26:29] and our hope is not
[26:31] my brothers and sisters it reminds me of
[26:33] a man you know
[26:35] um that him and his wife um
[26:38] kind of you know profess to be be
[26:40] christians and
[26:42] and whatnot although they've got
[26:43] discouraged of the church that they
[26:45] attended
[26:46] and uh one day we were just talking as
[26:49] men as
[26:50] fellow farmers and uh he was making he
[26:53] made a comment and
[26:54] something just come up in me and and i i
[26:57] just had to ask him this question
[27:00] and it actually kind of frustrated him
[27:02] and and he kind of spoke
[27:04] pretty direct to me but i just asked him
[27:07] i said what are you going to do
[27:10] when all of this investment and all this
[27:12] land and all our savings account and our
[27:15] bonds and our
[27:16] you know all of this what are we going
[27:18] to do when we wake up one morning and
[27:19] all of this is nothing
[27:23] and he said well what makes you think
[27:25] that'll happen i said well that's what
[27:26] my bible says
[27:28] and he says well kindly thank you
[27:32] but you didn't have to mention that
[27:36] and the thing is is it's just as
[27:38] startling for you and i
[27:40] as it would be for them right because we
[27:43] labor
[27:44] and we build and we we do
[27:48] all of these things and yet
[27:52] our trust our hope is not
[27:56] in this and that is what makes the
[28:00] difference
[28:00] is that we don't have it all pinned on
[28:03] what the stock market's doing or what
[28:05] real estate is doing or
[28:07] what is happening our hope is steadfast
[28:10] solid in the lord amen
[28:13] and that to me is i think probably the
[28:16] reason
[28:17] i can go on i can press forward every
[28:20] day
[28:21] amen let's turn our bibles proverbs 13
[28:23] and 1.
[28:26] a wise son heareth his father's
[28:29] instruction but a scorner heareth not
[28:32] rebuke
[28:33] a man shall eat good by the fruit of his
[28:37] mouth
[28:38] but the soul of the transgressor shall
[28:40] eat violence
[28:41] he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his
[28:44] life
[28:45] but he that openeth wide his lips shall
[28:48] have
[28:48] destruction the soul of the sluggard
[28:51] desireth and half nothing
[28:54] but the soul of the diligent shall be
[28:57] made fat
[28:58] a righteous man hateth lying but a
[29:01] wicked man
[29:02] is lost them and cometh to shame
[29:06] righteousness keepeth him that is
[29:08] upright in the way
[29:11] but wickedness overthroweth the sinner
[29:14] there is that maketh himself
[29:18] rich yet hath nothing there is that
[29:22] maketh himself poor
[29:24] yet half great riches
[29:27] my that right there is a paradox
[29:30] the ransom of a man's life are his
[29:33] riches
[29:34] but the poor heareth not rebuke
[29:38] the light of the righteous rejoices
[29:41] but the lamp of the wicked shall be put
[29:44] out
[29:45] only by pride cometh contention
[29:48] but with the well advised is wisdom
[29:52] all saints i just want to make this
[29:54] comment right here
[29:56] that's why we should be praying i'm not
[29:58] talking about praying for paul or
[30:00] for brother david or brother chris but
[30:02] that's why we should be
[30:04] praying that the word would be preached
[30:07] to us
[30:07] that we are well advised that we don't
[30:11] just
[30:11] talk and now i'm not pointing i don't
[30:13] mean this towards any group or anything
[30:15] don't misunderstand me
[30:16] but we don't want to just talk about
[30:19] we're the bride we're going in a rapture
[30:21] we're go
[30:21] the bride we're going in a rapture we
[30:23] believe the message we're going in a
[30:24] rapture
[30:25] it's much deeper than that and we should
[30:29] be praying lord
[30:30] let this ministry whoever stands in
[30:33] these pulpits and when we're listening
[30:35] to the prophet
[30:36] let it come to us that we would be well
[30:39] advised
[30:40] that when we would face the calamities
[30:43] and the challenges
[30:44] of the age that we live in that we would
[30:47] understand what we see what we hear
[30:51] and what is going on amen and we won't
[30:54] do that just simply by osmosis
[30:57] we have to be participating
[31:00] hallelujah otherwise we could sleep with
[31:03] our bible under
[31:04] our pillow and that would make all the
[31:06] difference
[31:11] only by pride cometh contention but with
[31:14] the well
[31:14] advised is wisdom wealth gotten by
[31:18] vanity shall be diminished
[31:20] but he that gathereth by labor shall
[31:22] increase
[31:23] hope deferred maketh the heart sick
[31:26] but when the desire cometh it is a tree
[31:30] of life who so despiseth the word shall
[31:33] be destroyed
[31:34] but he that feareth the commandment
[31:36] shall be rewarded
[31:38] the law of the wise is a fountain of
[31:41] life
[31:41] to depart from the snares of death
[31:44] heavenly father we just ask for your
[31:46] blessings this evening
[31:48] lord just may your holy spirit just move
[31:50] amongst us
[31:51] father lord for we know
[31:54] lord as we just reading the quotes
[31:56] reading the words and believing them
[31:58] father
[31:59] lord that this is not something that we
[32:01] can just be taught
[32:02] but lord this is by revelation and we
[32:05] ask your father just open our hearts and
[32:08] open our eyes our mind
[32:09] father that by revelation we can see
[32:12] clearly the whole picture
[32:14] and not just see the picture father but
[32:16] lord
[32:17] be what you called us to be father to
[32:20] bring
[32:20] forth the word of life bring forth the
[32:23] will of god amen your word is your will
[32:26] lord and
[32:27] to bring that forth in such a fashion
[32:30] that our lives truly would be counted as
[32:32] a testimony
[32:33] of the power of our lord jesus christ we
[32:36] ask for your blessings tonight in the
[32:38] name of jesus christ
[32:40] amen you may be seated saints
[32:43] now you know i would like to go back
[32:45] here and just
[32:46] as i have been in the last few services
[32:50] i would like to just uh kind of make
[32:52] some commentary
[32:53] on some of these verses and they just
[32:56] they just strike me and i
[32:58] i'm a lord help me i'm not a very good
[33:01] teacher
[33:02] uh but you know i think that we don't
[33:04] have to
[33:05] look at ability of ourself because the
[33:08] word will speak for itself amen and so
[33:11] we just want the word to speak to us and
[33:14] you know it's interesting we made a
[33:15] comment here just uh
[33:17] uh in the last couple weeks you know how
[33:20] it seems as though
[33:21] we hear the advice of our fathers of our
[33:24] parents i should say
[33:25] and you know sometimes we simply have to
[33:28] learn the lesson for ourself
[33:29] and we can start from the time it's
[33:32] little you know you tell a child to
[33:34] to not touch the stove and you tell them
[33:36] it's hot it's hot
[33:38] it's hot but you know once that child
[33:41] uh actually touches the stove there is
[33:44] an
[33:44] understanding that comes and you know a
[33:47] wise son
[33:48] hearing his father's instruction and you
[33:50] know we're we're
[33:52] here tonight as believers as christians
[33:55] and
[33:55] you look at this and realize that the
[33:57] wisdom
[33:58] of our fathers not necessarily just
[34:00] natural but
[34:01] our spiritual fathers how that we have
[34:04] been
[34:05] uh given so much we we have a wealth we
[34:08] have 1200 plus sermons uh
[34:10] we have a ministry that's uh god has
[34:13] anointed with the holy ghost to
[34:15] to preach the word to us and this wisdom
[34:18] this instruction is
[34:20] there available and yet we'll find even
[34:23] as we see the supernatural taking place
[34:25] in our midst that there would be
[34:27] the scorners that would come and they
[34:30] they would make statements i come across
[34:32] this statement here
[34:34] just a few days ago not even
[34:36] intentionally
[34:37] but a person was saying now william
[34:39] branham says that you're not making to
[34:41] heaven
[34:42] unless you believe his message
[34:45] my brother and sister you can go all
[34:47] through the message
[34:48] you will not find a statement where
[34:50] brother branham says
[34:52] you are not making it to heaven unless
[34:54] you believe
[34:55] my message but when he speaks he's
[34:57] speaking in the context
[34:59] of the message of our lord jesus christ
[35:02] but yet this corner instead of looking
[35:05] with balance and saying you know what
[35:07] god's got a message and we have to
[35:09] believe it they would choose then to put
[35:12] it back
[35:13] to an individual and say we have to
[35:15] believe that man
[35:16] no way i'm not doing that i won't
[35:18] participate i won't be that
[35:20] you see they actually then put themself
[35:23] in a box because
[35:24] when a man is speaking the word of god
[35:27] this is scriptural
[35:28] he is not a mouthpiece of himself but he
[35:31] is a mouthpiece of god
[35:33] this is why we can trust the word of the
[35:35] prophets this is why
[35:37] the apostle paul's word rings so true to
[35:40] us
[35:40] because we know that the apostle paul
[35:42] was not speaking of
[35:44] himself when he says i paul a prisoner
[35:47] of christ it sure sounds like a
[35:49] personal thing that he's speaking but
[35:51] he's declaring a position or an
[35:53] office a duty that he's called and he's
[35:56] declaring i'm
[35:58] bound to christ i'm not bound to the
[36:00] synagogue
[36:01] i'm not bound to the high priest i'm not
[36:03] bound to this group or that group
[36:05] i'm bound to jesus christ and that's who
[36:09] i represent and
[36:10] so then when one would reject paul he is
[36:13] not really rejecting paul he's actually
[36:15] rejecting christ and
[36:17] so we look in the age that we live in my
[36:19] brother and sister and
[36:20] i find it interesting that the scorners
[36:23] usually don't show up
[36:24] until the voice is quieted and so it's
[36:28] there then they can say anything they
[36:30] want make any challenge
[36:31] they can twist the words in any way but
[36:34] you see
[36:35] they won't hear any kind of correction
[36:37] they don't want to hear
[36:38] uh the as it were explanation or the
[36:41] context the
[36:42] they have their mind made up now as we
[36:45] look at verse two
[36:46] uh i i think this is so wonderful uh
[36:50] i got excited about this and i i really
[36:52] don't want to
[36:54] belabor too much of any one of these
[36:57] because we could be here all night but a
[36:59] man
[37:00] shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth
[37:03] now my brother and sister what do we
[37:05] have to offer
[37:06] of the fruit of our mouth we either
[37:09] according to the scripture
[37:11] out of the mouth comes either blessing
[37:14] or cursing amen it either comes
[37:17] as it is as a sweet a flavor or odor to
[37:21] god
[37:22] or it comes to a judgment and so you
[37:25] look at this and realize
[37:27] this is why the prophet of god this is
[37:30] why the word of god
[37:31] encourages us to not speak the negative
[37:34] right
[37:35] you go in there and that quote where
[37:37] brother branham says you know
[37:38] don't say i'm not a very good christian
[37:40] i'm weak i'm this and that
[37:42] he said you're talking the devil's
[37:44] language
[37:45] so he's encouraging us to speak
[37:48] those things that would actually be
[37:51] a good to eat good i am a son of god
[37:55] amen i am a daughter of god i the word
[37:58] is real to me i am alive i'm filled with
[38:01] the holy ghost
[38:02] these things actually influence us in a
[38:06] measure that we often can't can't or
[38:09] don't measure it we we don't realize
[38:11] what we're actually
[38:12] saying and and you know sometimes you
[38:15] realize
[38:15] it's just a habit and god help us to
[38:18] break habits can someone say amen to
[38:21] that
[38:21] you know you know you can get in a habit
[38:23] to you know you cut a board the wrong
[38:26] length or you do something wrong and
[38:27] you're like well that was stupid or i'm
[38:29] stupid or
[38:30] something don't speak those words amen
[38:33] i'm a son of god and
[38:35] this is in material and i will not
[38:38] allow what is coming from my mouth to
[38:41] come back to me
[38:42] as something bitter
[38:46] i want what comes out of my mouth to
[38:48] come back
[38:49] as a good
[38:53] let's just type it good fruit amen
[38:57] it was the fruit right now the word says
[39:00] that
[39:00] we would give praise or the fruit of our
[39:02] mouth would be praise
[39:04] to god let that be the fruit of our
[39:07] mouth saints
[39:08] not not of what we see wrong and right
[39:11] and this and that and how i feel about
[39:13] myself
[39:14] but let the fruit that comes from our
[39:16] mouth be something that
[39:18] is a blessing to yourself you say
[39:20] brother paul can i really bless myself
[39:22] well i happen to believe you can really
[39:24] bless yourself
[39:26] you can speak the words of god that god
[39:28] said about you
[39:29] and when you repeat the word of god that
[39:32] god spoke about you
[39:33] you're telling god you believe what he
[39:36] said
[39:36] about you amen if we speak the opposite
[39:40] of what god
[39:41] says about us then we're actually
[39:44] speaking the devil's language instead of
[39:46] god's language
[39:47] and then we wonder why these things
[39:50] boomerang and come right back
[39:51] to us any of you ever learned that one
[39:55] from experience
[39:57] yes well i have but we won't bore you
[40:00] tonight with the 10
[40:01] 000 times i have hurt my own self or
[40:05] hindered my own self amen so let the
[40:08] fruit of our lips give praise to the
[40:10] lord
[40:11] amen now it says here he that keepeth
[40:14] his mouth keep us
[40:15] his life but he that openeth wide his
[40:18] lips shall have
[40:19] destruction and we live in a world
[40:22] my brother and sister that people use
[40:25] the name
[40:25] of our savior our lord jesus christ
[40:29] they use the name of our god they
[40:32] you know use the context or
[40:35] connective words of damnation and they
[40:38] speak these things and it has become so
[40:41] habitual
[40:42] that they don't even think about it amen
[40:45] they could use
[40:46] any other word but those are the words
[40:48] they're conditioned
[40:50] i hope you follow me those are the words
[40:53] they're
[40:53] conditioned to speak
[41:02] i ask a man once we're actually working
[41:05] on a beat digger
[41:06] in the middle of the field and it was
[41:07] cold the wind blowing and it was getting
[41:09] to be night
[41:11] and uh he smashed his hand and he let
[41:14] forth a string of words
[41:17] and i just looked him in the face he was
[41:19] on the other side of a lifter chain
[41:21] about that far away from me
[41:23] and i just looked through the chain in
[41:24] his face and i said do you really want
[41:26] god
[41:29] to damn us
[41:32] no i don't mean it that way i said but
[41:35] that's
[41:36] what you said
[41:40] he said well it's just a habit i have
[41:44] but our habits become who we are
[41:47] we will be identified that my brother
[41:50] and sister
[41:52] you know the proper word to speak if you
[41:55] smash your hand
[41:56] foot head whatever it might be is ouch
[42:00] but if we need an alternative we could
[42:02] smash our hand
[42:03] foot or head and say praise god
[42:06] now the world will think you're a nut
[42:08] but at least we're attached to the right
[42:09] bolt
[42:10] hallelujah amen remember the little
[42:13] story i just read that a few days ago
[42:15] brother branham talking about that man
[42:16] you know
[42:17] hallelujah it's the nuts that hold it
[42:19] all together but praise the lord the
[42:21] nuts aren't just laying in the bed of
[42:22] the truck they're hooked to a bolt and
[42:24] that's what makes a truck
[42:26] praise the lord amen so we want to keep
[42:28] our mouth because
[42:30] that actually will speak greater to our
[42:33] own life
[42:34] now you say but brother paul what we say
[42:37] can be heard and be a testimony to
[42:39] others
[42:40] but i'm dealing with you tonight i'm
[42:42] dealing with me tonight
[42:43] that we would speak those things that
[42:45] would influence
[42:47] ourself amen it's not what you
[42:50] say my brother and sister that might
[42:53] cause concern amongst someone else if
[42:55] it's just a sinner that's never going to
[42:57] serve god
[42:58] but if you're influenced by your own
[43:00] words
[43:02] then you'll realize that the devil will
[43:05] handicap you
[43:07] now i'm not into horse racing but i just
[43:09] want to put this to you
[43:10] do you realize my brother and sister
[43:12] that when they run a horse when they do
[43:14] these kind of things
[43:16] to equalize it they have a person that
[43:18] weighs 150 pounds
[43:20] and one that weighs 120 pounds they add
[43:23] 30 pounds to that horse
[43:25] to to balance or equalize that they call
[43:28] it a handicap
[43:29] and so the devil would like to get you
[43:32] to carry
[43:33] every burden possible
[43:38] amen want you to carry every burden
[43:42] possible he said that he's broke the
[43:46] lord
[43:46] has said i broke the yoke of bondage i
[43:49] have delivered you
[43:50] i have brought you out i have set you
[43:53] free
[43:54] i have brought you from this uh you know
[43:56] from the ju
[43:57] in the jubilee i brought you from
[43:59] bondage into
[44:00] freedom and the only way you remain
[44:03] bound was you
[44:04] yourself stood at the post and they
[44:07] drove the all
[44:08] through your ear you see satan says if i
[44:10] can keep them bound
[44:12] if i can keep them handicapped are you
[44:15] with me following that example
[44:16] amen keep them handicapped they will
[44:19] never
[44:20] run free as they would if they were
[44:23] delivered completely in the name of
[44:25] jesus christ
[44:26] so the devil keeps coming along trying
[44:28] to put on these handicaps
[44:30] and we're over here volunteering oh my
[44:34] now i'm not preaching maybe to you
[44:36] tonight but it might be somebody like
[44:37] you
[44:38] or it might be your circumstance
[44:39] tomorrow morning
[44:41] amen hallelujah the soul of the sluggard
[44:48] desireth have nothing
[44:51] but the soul of the diligent shall be
[44:53] made fat
[44:55] now i find this so interesting because
[44:57] you know
[44:58] when you look at this uh uh
[45:02] it's kind of interesting
[45:05] because i i could give you a real life
[45:08] example
[45:09] of this of men that i have known
[45:13] and by god's grace i caught i caught
[45:15] something not even
[45:17] saying i was spiritual but i caught
[45:19] something
[45:20] out of these situations and you work
[45:23] with someone or you
[45:24] enter into an enterprise with someone
[45:28] and you're supposed to be contributing
[45:30] 50 50
[45:31] and and you're supposed to be doing
[45:34] these things together
[45:35] but yet one is free to spend his money
[45:39] on this that and the other and always
[45:42] saying
[45:43] if i had five thousand dollars i would
[45:46] do this
[45:47] and this but you see
[45:53] in the time that i was associated
[45:56] never had five thousand dollars
[45:59] so it was always you might say just
[46:02] wishing
[46:04] now i don't speak highly of myself
[46:06] because like i said
[46:08] i believe it was god that that just
[46:10] guided me on this
[46:12] but i realized if i was ever going to
[46:14] attain that same position because i
[46:16] desired that same position
[46:18] then i had to do more than just desire
[46:22] it
[46:23] my brother and sister when the prophet
[46:24] of god talks about in the late hour when
[46:26] they start to come the denomination
[46:28] starts to come for the wine and the oil
[46:31] amen they're desiring the spirit of god
[46:34] they're desiring these things
[46:36] but you see it will take more than
[46:38] desire to get that to them
[46:40] so they're desiring a move of the holy
[46:42] ghost but they're not willing to pay a
[46:44] price they're not willing to
[46:46] step out and possess what the word of
[46:48] god says
[46:49] because it actually requires a sacrifice
[46:52] and they then kind of speaking a little
[46:55] blunt here
[46:56] they want the system of their church
[46:59] and the holy ghost not realizing those
[47:02] two
[47:02] don't go together so then they desire
[47:06] they desire they desire
[47:08] but they never move beyond that so they
[47:11] never
[47:11] possess the moving or the actual
[47:14] uh essence of the holy spirit in their
[47:17] life not just an anointing on the flesh
[47:20] but the real true holy ghost because
[47:23] they desire it but they don't want to
[47:25] give up
[47:26] what they have and we'll we'll talk
[47:28] maybe this coming sunday a little bit
[47:30] more
[47:31] on that you see the soul of the slugger
[47:34] desires but he doesn't do anything about
[47:36] it so therefore he has
[47:37] nothing but the soul of the diligent
[47:40] shall be made fat
[47:41] now my brother and sister we want to tie
[47:44] this just for a moment
[47:45] this diligence here amen the scripture
[47:48] tells us to have all diligence to make
[47:51] our calling
[47:52] an election sure in other words you are
[47:55] going to have to pursue this
[47:57] constantly day in day out never
[48:01] giving up relentless in your pursuit
[48:04] of being filled with the holy ghost amen
[48:06] not talking now just hearing what the
[48:08] prophet of god said
[48:10] we're not talking of an experience that
[48:12] happened
[48:13] 40 years ago that's what he uses the
[48:15] word yeah and it's something that
[48:17] happened
[48:17] 40 years ago we're not talking about
[48:20] something that happened he brings it
[48:21] right down
[48:22] we're not talking about something that
[48:24] happened last month
[48:27] but a diligence that brings us to lord i
[48:30] want to meet you
[48:31] i want to be in your presence i want to
[48:33] be filled with your spirit
[48:35] today i want to come into
[48:38] the supernatural today i don't even want
[48:41] to look back 30 days i don't want to
[48:43] look back
[48:44] to a previous service i want a day
[48:47] by day experience amen
[48:51] because you see every denomination and
[48:53] every individual
[48:54] and pardon me for just putting this
[48:56] blunt we can talk about what happened in
[48:59] brother branham's ministry
[49:01] uh you know in 1961 62
[49:04] 63 4 5 we can talk about those things
[49:07] and we ourselves be as dry as a husk
[49:11] blown in the wind rattling in the in the
[49:14] in the courtyard in the
[49:16] barnyard nothing there you know the
[49:19] house that blow around
[49:20] are always empty
[49:25] it won't do us any good to quote what
[49:27] brother branham did
[49:30] now my brother and sister you know me
[49:33] i'm not stepping away from the prophet
[49:35] even though he told
[49:36] us that we would move on from that
[49:39] position
[49:41] it's right in the message he told us you
[49:44] will move on from this position
[49:48] but you see while we study we listen
[49:51] and god blesses us for doing that we're
[49:54] not
[49:55] looking back to that day we're seeing
[49:58] where the leadership of the holy spirit
[50:00] was pointing us
[50:02] and encouraging us and filling us up to
[50:05] to bring us with
[50:06] faith to come and claim what is
[50:08] rightfully ours today
[50:10] if the prophet came on the scene today
[50:12] i'm absolutely convinced my brother and
[50:14] sister
[50:15] he would not be happy with us what we
[50:17] have done with the message
[50:18] we have created an atmosphere where we
[50:20] do a lot of
[50:21] looking back and i believe god would
[50:24] want us to look forward i believe the
[50:26] prophet if he was here
[50:27] would want us to look forward i believe
[50:29] he would he would kind of
[50:31] chastise us which might be a kind word
[50:34] for saying he'd whip our hides
[50:36] amen so you look at this now
[50:40] moving on here a righteous man hateth
[50:42] lying but a wicked man is loathsome and
[50:44] cometh to shame and you know when i was
[50:47] reading this it reminded me of something
[50:49] i actually learned from my dad and
[50:51] because that was taught to me at a young
[50:53] age i i looked around
[50:55] and uh for probably since i was about 13
[50:59] or 14 years old
[51:00] uh this got planted in my mind and my
[51:04] my dad used to say son be careful of
[51:06] those people who will lie
[51:07] when the truth would serve them better
[51:13] now my brother and sister tell me what
[51:16] it is about preaching this gospel
[51:19] that would cause us to have any need to
[51:21] deviate from it that's right amen
[51:26] other than we the ministry
[51:31] struggled to line up with the word
[51:33] ourself
[51:34] so we brought the standard of the word
[51:36] back down to
[51:37] our level and then when we preached it
[51:40] to the people
[51:42] we softened as it were you might say the
[51:44] blow
[51:45] and there we made the word of none
[51:47] effect because
[51:48] the first thing you steal from it is the
[51:51] power of the word
[51:54] the prophet of god said soon as the
[51:56] spirit of denomination
[51:58] these are my own words here but as soon
[52:00] as the spirit of denomination
[52:02] is expressed or accepted it is
[52:05] dead
[52:10] oh god help us amen we want the power of
[52:14] god to move in our midst my brother and
[52:16] sister
[52:16] i don't care if we're talking from the
[52:18] front of the church to the back of the
[52:20] church and wall to wall
[52:21] we need to just buckle down and say lord
[52:23] help me to live it
[52:25] amen we don't need a compromise we don't
[52:27] need a watering down we don't need
[52:30] kind of setting a new standard what we
[52:32] need to do
[52:33] is just ask god to give us the strength
[52:36] and the courage to live it
[52:38] hallelujah amen
[52:41] now look as we look at this the
[52:44] righteous
[52:45] righteousness keepeth him that is
[52:47] upright in the way
[52:49] so we realize it's not our own
[52:50] righteousness it's not anything that we
[52:52] can do kept
[52:53] us in the way right as we shared with
[52:55] you here a few weeks ago
[52:57] the word shows us that the holy spirit
[53:00] is the keeper of the way
[53:02] amen he keeps us on the path we would
[53:04] veer right and left and
[53:06] we would have all kinds of things that
[53:08] we would do but it's the holy ghost that
[53:11] comes and
[53:11] keeps us centered up and right here this
[53:14] righteousness which would be
[53:16] uh the righteousness of our lord jesus
[53:18] christ
[53:19] is actually what keeps us upright in the
[53:22] way
[53:23] but wickedness overthroweth the center
[53:25] now i'm going to throw this out and you
[53:27] can digest it however you want
[53:29] but my brother and sister you look
[53:31] around and everyone who forsakes
[53:34] holiness
[53:37] they don't just step down one notch
[53:41] it starts a slippery slope that just
[53:44] continually
[53:44] moves them away from the word of god
[53:48] that's a simple fact amen we don't have
[53:51] to point it at any group of people in a
[53:53] denomination
[53:54] you can just go and do your own research
[53:57] and study that
[53:58] that every holiness church that ever was
[54:00] in the united states that compromised on
[54:02] holiness on righteousness
[54:04] uh they didn't stop right there they
[54:06] just kept right on going
[54:08] see so it's a slippery slope that satan
[54:10] is so tricky about getting people to
[54:12] take the first step
[54:14] amen and it's a first step that
[54:17] that hurts amen there's an old joke
[54:19] about what it is about a cliff
[54:22] and he said is two things about a cliff
[54:24] that that are bad for you
[54:26] one is the first step and the second is
[54:29] the landing
[54:30] amen those two things only two things
[54:33] wrong with a cliff
[54:34] amen so you look at this
[54:37] now verse 7 would actually be a
[54:41] good dave ramsey lesson you know i think
[54:45] most of us are familiar with who dave
[54:47] ramsey is
[54:48] right a good dave ramsey lesson
[54:51] amen there is that maketh himself rich
[54:56] yet hath nothing and you can apply that
[55:00] just in the natural people can make
[55:02] all kinds of money
[55:06] now look i'm not preaching about tithes
[55:09] i don't know who does who doesn't i
[55:11] don't know how much i don't know none
[55:13] about that and i'm glad that i don't
[55:15] but i'm telling you i have from personal
[55:18] experience
[55:19] known that people who will not follow
[55:22] the word of god will not
[55:24] they have a reason well that's old
[55:25] testament that's this that's that
[55:27] i can't afford to but my brother and
[55:29] sister if they were
[55:30] just actually more in a spiritual sense
[55:33] if they would actually just go far
[55:35] enough to pull
[55:37] that uh how do i word that
[55:41] it's not theoretical it's really real
[55:43] even though their pants pocket might not
[55:45] have a hole in the pocket
[55:49] this one doesn't
[55:52] but you see when we choose to not obey
[55:54] the word of god
[55:57] this happens and that happens
[56:00] and this and that and that and that and
[56:02] this and that and that
[56:03] and you see i can't afford to pay tithes
[56:06] because
[56:07] i'm fixing a car i'm fixing a house i'm
[56:10] fixing this and i didn't have that
[56:11] and that
[56:16] failing to catch the revelation
[56:25] failing to catch the revelation
[56:29] that you can make six figure money
[56:32] and be broke
[56:36] and you can make small five figure money
[56:40] now we realize that too small is
[56:43] impossible you're not going to raise a
[56:44] family on
[56:45] 5 000 a year well
[56:48] i shouldn't say can't we should never
[56:50] say can't when god's involved
[56:52] with god all things are possible
[56:55] but you understand where i'm at but the
[56:58] man who makes good
[56:59] six-figure money might not live as well
[57:03] as a committed son and daughter of god
[57:06] on half the income
[57:08] or a third of the income because
[57:11] mentally they were not able to grasp
[57:14] that god
[57:15] makes the difference that's not it's not
[57:18] our money it's not how much we make
[57:21] it's god that makes the difference and
[57:24] that's why i even bring this up saints i
[57:26] i'm not going to preach to you about
[57:28] tithe you do what you want to do about
[57:30] that
[57:30] but if you got a hole in your pocket the
[57:32] best seamstress or
[57:34] the best uh whatever you would call it
[57:37] we're not going to gender eyes god
[57:40] the best fix here is to just let god
[57:44] sow up your pocket amen
[57:48] because you see it's that work of god
[57:51] but there is a man there is a way there
[57:53] is something then people do this
[57:55] and and yet they don't have anything and
[57:57] life is a struggle
[57:59] and there is that that maketh himself
[58:01] poor
[58:02] yet half great riches i've said this in
[58:04] church many times
[58:06] i will say it again i believe that many
[58:08] the reason that many of us
[58:10] uh are not of great wealth around the
[58:13] message
[58:13] is that it would just be a trap for a
[58:16] lot of us
[58:16] and god by his grace just keeps us where
[58:19] we're asking
[58:20] he's providing amen he's still jehovah
[58:23] jireh today
[58:25] amen and it's not just something about
[58:27] well i i need healing or i need this
[58:30] great thing to happen
[58:31] but jehovah jireh is here for our
[58:34] simplest
[58:35] needs amen but we have to come
[58:39] and we have to line up as it were or
[58:42] abide by the word of god
[58:44] amen now i think about verse 8 the
[58:46] ransom of a man's life or his riches
[58:52] when you read that superficially you're
[58:55] thinking well it's what the man has
[58:56] acquired his riches
[59:00] but the word of god says from the
[59:02] abundance of a man's mouth
[59:05] or abundance of his heart i mean his
[59:07] mouth speaks
[59:09] what are you going to declare as your
[59:12] riches
[59:13] that's really what it's going to come
[59:15] down to it's not whether you have fifty
[59:18] dollars in the bank
[59:19] or fifty thousand in the bank it's going
[59:22] to be
[59:22] what you make the riches in your life
[59:26] and the ransom of a man what the value
[59:28] there is to a man
[59:30] it is not necessarily that he is hostage
[59:33] but the ransom or the price of a man's
[59:35] life
[59:36] are his riches it reminds me of a story
[59:39] about a man
[59:40] amen lives back in kentucky and uh
[59:43] here he is in this day and age and and
[59:45] they're old now
[59:47] and and he they had quite a family they
[59:49] got i think he had seven or eight
[59:51] daughters four sons
[59:53] and you know he just always everything
[59:56] was about his children
[59:57] and he turned down good jobs that would
[59:59] take them from
[1:00:00] being able to go to church and and they
[1:00:02] did this their whole life
[1:00:04] and now here they are in their elderly
[1:00:07] years
[1:00:08] and uh has almost no social security has
[1:00:11] almost
[1:00:11] nothing has a little house that that is
[1:00:13] finally paid for
[1:00:15] and everybody's like what are you going
[1:00:16] to do and you never acquired you could
[1:00:19] have done this and you could have done
[1:00:21] that
[1:00:21] and the man then points to his family
[1:00:24] that's there eating together on a sunday
[1:00:26] afternoon
[1:00:27] and every one of his children and their
[1:00:29] spouses
[1:00:30] and their grandchildren are serving god
[1:00:34] and the man said i am the richest man on
[1:00:37] the face of this earth
[1:00:39] you see there's where he paced his
[1:00:42] riches
[1:00:42] it wasn't in what he acquired it wasn't
[1:00:45] what he had in a bank account
[1:00:47] but it was in his family and them
[1:00:50] serving god
[1:00:51] and he said i'm a rich guy and so a
[1:00:53] little farther deeper into the story
[1:00:55] which was shared with me
[1:00:57] uh was that this brother every one of
[1:00:59] his
[1:01:00] uh children their families every one of
[1:01:03] them contributed a certain amount of
[1:01:05] money which wasn't really that
[1:01:06] substantial
[1:01:08] every month to take care of mom and dad
[1:01:11] because we have
[1:01:12] something to uh uh thank them for we
[1:01:15] have something to do that
[1:01:16] look at the riches god's providing amen
[1:01:19] they didn't need a big house they didn't
[1:01:21] need a yacht a
[1:01:22] boat a plane a train they needed god and
[1:01:25] that's what they gave to their children
[1:01:28] amen and they've passed that on and
[1:01:30] their grandchildren are being raised in
[1:01:31] that same value system
[1:01:34] amen now verse 10
[1:01:38] i want to just touch real quick only by
[1:01:41] pride cometh contention
[1:01:44] but with the well advised is wisdom
[1:01:48] did you just read what i read
[1:01:57] only when we have contention i'm right
[1:02:00] you're wrong this is this that is that
[1:02:02] i'm not going to talk to you i'm fussed
[1:02:05] up
[1:02:06] i got my feathers all done up pride
[1:02:08] somewhere in the equation
[1:02:10] that's what the word of god says you
[1:02:13] know we could
[1:02:14] stand and the prophet of god actually
[1:02:16] expresses this quite a few times through
[1:02:18] the message
[1:02:20] men that disagreed with him
[1:02:23] and he makes the declaration but we can
[1:02:25] still call his
[1:02:26] each other brother amen
[1:02:30] how could that be god help us
[1:02:34] you know what i'll be honest church i
[1:02:35] must have a little pride hiding in me
[1:02:37] somewhere
[1:02:38] because there's time i get my little
[1:02:40] bandy rooster feathers all
[1:02:42] up and it's like oh no you're not
[1:02:46] but you see we can actually get by
[1:02:49] without that
[1:02:51] we can sit down and say brother i'm
[1:02:52] sorry i see it differently the prophet
[1:02:54] says this here and this here
[1:02:56] and you see it this way in this way but
[1:02:58] one thing we can do is love one another
[1:03:00] but you see when pride comes in there
[1:03:03] someone's got to be wrong so that i
[1:03:06] can be right
[1:03:13] i hope i didn't step on anybody's toes
[1:03:15] there
[1:03:16] but it's scriptural amen
[1:03:19] and if it's in the word we ought to pay
[1:03:21] attention to it
[1:03:22] so really the truth is is we actually
[1:03:25] bring
[1:03:26] contention upon ourselves
[1:03:31] wealth gotten another dave ramsey lesson
[1:03:33] here wealth gotten by vanity shall be
[1:03:36] diminished
[1:03:37] but he that gathereth by labor shall
[1:03:39] increase
[1:03:40] you know it's funny my brother and
[1:03:42] sister when i read that i thought you
[1:03:44] know we live in a world that has more
[1:03:46] get rich quick schemes
[1:03:48] then there are almost as many quick rich
[1:03:51] schemes as there is real jobs
[1:03:56] you know i'll just give you an example
[1:03:59] every time down in phoenix that they
[1:04:01] have
[1:04:01] one of those seminars on how to sell out
[1:04:04] people's profit
[1:04:06] property with no money of your own and
[1:04:08] make lots of money ever
[1:04:10] i can tell when they have these seminars
[1:04:12] in phoenix
[1:04:13] they just had one you say how do you
[1:04:15] know brother paul
[1:04:17] because i get 40 or 50 phone calls
[1:04:20] about selling a house i haven't owned
[1:04:22] for two years
[1:04:25] but you see these people fork out
[1:04:27] anywhere from five to seven
[1:04:29] thousand dollars to get this seminar
[1:04:32] about people like paul haylett
[1:04:34] who owns his house in phoenix arizona
[1:04:36] but lives in idaho
[1:04:37] is so disgusted with owning a house in
[1:04:39] phoenix he's going to beg you to sell
[1:04:41] his house
[1:04:42] and here's this list of all these people
[1:04:44] and will give it to you
[1:04:45] they just forgot to tell them their list
[1:04:47] is old
[1:04:49] and these people are sincere sir i can
[1:04:51] help you sell your house
[1:04:53] well that's wonderful but i haven't
[1:04:55] owned it for two years
[1:04:56] what yeah no those people who sold you
[1:05:00] on this
[1:05:00] i'm sorry i sound like a preacher
[1:05:02] probably on the phone the people who
[1:05:03] sold you on this
[1:05:05] set you up and fleeced you and you
[1:05:08] were happy and they're like
[1:05:11] okay thank you goodbye
[1:05:15] and i'm like wow do you realize
[1:05:19] the devil my brother and sister is not
[1:05:22] here
[1:05:22] to see you prosper he's here to trip
[1:05:26] you up and he's got
[1:05:30] how does that song go been offered
[1:05:32] everything that's gonna name all the
[1:05:34] wealth i'd want and worldly flame but
[1:05:37] i'd threw it back at the devil and i
[1:05:39] told him no
[1:05:45] ah man
[1:05:49] i don't know if there's a market for
[1:05:51] two-line songs or not
[1:05:55] but you see my brother and sister god
[1:05:56] don't want you to get rich easy
[1:05:59] god don't have a scheme of some
[1:06:01] multi-level sign up the whole church
[1:06:03] you'll get rich and the rest of them
[1:06:05] will all be mad
[1:06:08] that isn't what god's got he wants us my
[1:06:10] brother and sister part of the curse you
[1:06:12] say brother paul i don't want to be
[1:06:13] under the curse
[1:06:14] but you are under the curse and actually
[1:06:17] the labor that we
[1:06:19] give is very symbolic into the labor
[1:06:22] that we give
[1:06:23] as sons and daughters of god god doesn't
[1:06:26] say oh here's the holy ghost i love you
[1:06:28] all so much
[1:06:28] here's the holy ghost god wants us to
[1:06:31] get down
[1:06:32] silent cry for the sin and the
[1:06:34] abomination in the city
[1:06:35] he wants us to labor he wants us to
[1:06:38] struggle
[1:06:38] he doesn't want to crack the shell and
[1:06:41] pulling out little chick
[1:06:42] so you can have life easy he wants you
[1:06:44] to have to peck and peck and peck and
[1:06:46] back and back
[1:06:47] and push forward but we think i'm a son
[1:06:50] of god
[1:06:50] it should be easy
[1:06:55] no no one of the greatest fallacies is
[1:06:58] my problems would go away when i get
[1:07:00] saved no sir that's the start
[1:07:03] right because as we preached this last
[1:07:05] week amen
[1:07:06] it was character that's what it was
[1:07:10] and we read about esther and we read how
[1:07:12] lovely this story
[1:07:14] is and we do this but we don't
[1:07:15] comprehend what she had to go
[1:07:18] through to have her character molded to
[1:07:21] become
[1:07:22] who god wanted her to be
[1:07:25] we want to be queen but do we want this
[1:07:29] struggle
[1:07:31] amen we want to be the bride but do we
[1:07:34] want to be the one who fights to
[1:07:36] overcome
[1:07:38] we want to be these things are we
[1:07:40] willing
[1:07:42] we know it's not by work saints but are
[1:07:45] we willing to struggle are we willing to
[1:07:47] labor are we willing to fight
[1:07:50] amen and you can look around you i'll
[1:07:53] just throw this out kind of a carnal
[1:07:55] example
[1:07:56] but you see very few people that win the
[1:07:57] lotteries that these nations
[1:07:59] you know our nation canada etc puts on
[1:08:01] these great big lotteries
[1:08:03] these people win this money and they end
[1:08:05] up divorced they end up alcoholics drug
[1:08:07] addicts they end up in bankruptcy
[1:08:09] all of this stuff because it is gotten
[1:08:12] by vanity
[1:08:13] and it will be diminished but you ever
[1:08:15] look out here i'm just looking for the
[1:08:17] natural
[1:08:17] you ever look at a young man i'll tell
[1:08:19] you how it was
[1:08:20] you look at a young man my brother and
[1:08:22] sister that
[1:08:24] has labored to buy his first vehicle
[1:08:28] you're not going to find him out here
[1:08:30] jumping the curbs and
[1:08:31] and peeling out and burning his tires
[1:08:34] off he's going to be the one that says
[1:08:35] you know i work too
[1:08:36] hard for this i'm not going to do this
[1:08:39] sean listen to me buddy
[1:08:41] amen when you get that first vehicle if
[1:08:44] you get that toyota four-wheel drive or
[1:08:46] whatever it is that you've got your
[1:08:47] heart set on
[1:08:48] amen remember how much time and how much
[1:08:51] effort
[1:08:52] how many times a mow in a yard and
[1:08:53] raking weeds and
[1:08:55] post holes and this that and the other
[1:08:57] packing stuff out of a house and
[1:08:59] throwing it in a trailer all this stuff
[1:09:01] remember what it took to accomplish that
[1:09:04] and then remember that you'll have to do
[1:09:06] it again if you destroy what you got now
[1:09:09] and that's where god's at dealing with
[1:09:11] us he he tells us here
[1:09:12] if you got this by vanity it come easy
[1:09:15] come easy go
[1:09:16] amen but if you labor for it you respect
[1:09:19] it and that's why god my brother and
[1:09:21] sister let you as the bride of christ
[1:09:23] labor so hard it looks like denomination
[1:09:25] out here i was talking to a man one day
[1:09:27] he said well our pastor was preaching on
[1:09:29] this you know kind of prosperity thing
[1:09:31] and we started applying those principles
[1:09:33] and right off the bat we got this
[1:09:35] and this happened this happened this
[1:09:37] happened and i thought that's good but
[1:09:39] your pastor actually perverted the word
[1:09:41] of god
[1:09:42] to make you excited about this that
[1:09:44] turns out it was a business opportunity
[1:09:46] that was coming your way
[1:09:48] anyway
[1:09:51] and now they give credit to god
[1:09:55] two years they're divorced because the
[1:09:58] secretary of this business
[1:10:00] understood him so much better than his
[1:10:02] wife did
[1:10:06] yeah my brother and sister
[1:10:09] that's why the word of god says don't
[1:10:11] despise the wise
[1:10:12] of your youth reason she might be whole
[1:10:15] sister jerry might club me with this one
[1:10:17] but the reason she might be kind of
[1:10:18] tired and
[1:10:19] discouraged is not that she's gave
[1:10:22] up but the fact that she deals with you
[1:10:25] every day
[1:10:27] and then the young one she didn't hang
[1:10:30] around real long
[1:10:31] because she figured out what took that
[1:10:33] other lady 40 years
[1:10:36] and why it was it only took her a couple
[1:10:40] you see what i'm saying the devil oh my
[1:10:42] goodness look how rich we've got god's
[1:10:44] blessed us
[1:10:46] know my brother and sister it's like a
[1:10:48] friend of mine
[1:10:49] this is kind of contrary to this but a
[1:10:51] friend of mine when the economy crashed
[1:10:54] had an opportunity to buy a great big
[1:10:56] house six bedrooms
[1:10:58] swimming pool huge family room game room
[1:11:01] three four car garage and he says my
[1:11:05] wife wants to sell it but she doesn't i
[1:11:07] said why you want to sell the house
[1:11:09] and he says well we live in one bedroom
[1:11:13] when our grandkids visit they occupy one
[1:11:16] bedroom
[1:11:17] and we still have four more that got to
[1:11:18] be cleaned and dusted and
[1:11:20] whatever it's a waste
[1:11:24] it's the reality of it is right
[1:11:30] i'll get on home economics here
[1:11:35] but you see these spiritual lessons hard
[1:11:37] lessons
[1:11:38] answers that come from god in the midst
[1:11:40] of the battle are not soon forgotten
[1:11:43] my brother and sister they're not soon
[1:11:45] forgotten when you are struggling as it
[1:11:47] were
[1:11:48] you're right there in the midst of the
[1:11:49] battle and god comes on the scene and
[1:11:51] gives you an
[1:11:51] answer gives you encouragement you won't
[1:11:54] forget
[1:11:54] that lesson hallelujah
[1:11:58] now look here verse 12. got to hurry
[1:11:59] along here
[1:12:01] hope deferred maketh the heart sick but
[1:12:03] when the desire cometh it is a tree of
[1:12:05] life
[1:12:06] now you look at this and that scripture
[1:12:08] is pretty self-explanatory in a way
[1:12:10] you look at that that when hope
[1:12:12] something that we have is
[1:12:14] is just constantly seems to be out in
[1:12:15] front of us right the old
[1:12:17] carrot kind of approach you just never
[1:12:19] quite get there it's just
[1:12:21] always just going to be another day
[1:12:23] another this another that will
[1:12:25] somehow get this my brother and sister
[1:12:27] whether you're talking in the natural or
[1:12:29] whether you're talking spiritual that's
[1:12:31] not a way to live life
[1:12:33] looking out there we as sons and
[1:12:35] daughters of god might be praying for
[1:12:37] something
[1:12:37] you'll be praying for something right
[1:12:39] now but you
[1:12:41] should still have something stirring in
[1:12:44] your life that you
[1:12:45] know god's on the scene that god is real
[1:12:48] he's present
[1:12:49] just because god hasn't answered that
[1:12:51] prayer or given to you something you
[1:12:53] desired
[1:12:54] doesn't mean that god's not on the scene
[1:12:56] so when we put our hope
[1:12:58] on one certain thing then we will find
[1:13:00] ourselves
[1:13:01] discouraged we will find ourselves
[1:13:04] making our heart sick
[1:13:05] now brother brown says an identified
[1:13:07] christ of all ages
[1:13:08] he says that's the way we find god when
[1:13:11] we take off
[1:13:12] our pride and lay it down and walk up in
[1:13:15] the presence
[1:13:16] listen to that voice identify i am
[1:13:20] that i am i am the god of abraham isaac
[1:13:23] and of jacob
[1:13:24] i remember my promise amen that's
[1:13:28] something we're going to remember my
[1:13:29] brother and sister
[1:13:30] i remember my promise and i see the
[1:13:32] condition is right
[1:13:36] see we got to get all these things put
[1:13:38] together
[1:13:40] remember when the prophet of god had
[1:13:41] that vision he's supposed to go and pray
[1:13:43] for that baby
[1:13:44] and he goes in the house and then the
[1:13:47] woman is there
[1:13:48] and then the mother-in-law comes and
[1:13:50] brother brown starts to move forward
[1:13:52] realizes
[1:13:53] that the hat is on the chair and it's
[1:13:56] supposed to be placed up on top of the
[1:13:58] i don't remember what it was on top of a
[1:14:00] piece of furniture or whatever
[1:14:02] and so the brother branham's checked
[1:14:08] all the other conditions are all good
[1:14:11] there's the woman her mother
[1:14:14] the child but you see how to get
[1:14:18] all the conditions right and the moment
[1:14:22] that the mother-in-law i believe it was
[1:14:24] took the hat
[1:14:25] set it up on top bingo
[1:14:29] there it is everything's correct the
[1:14:32] condition is right
[1:14:33] i have come down and i'm going to speak
[1:14:35] and i'm sending you and you'll be my
[1:14:37] voice
[1:14:37] oh my and that's the way he does it what
[1:14:40] did uh
[1:14:41] what did he do it by identifying himself
[1:14:44] in his characteristics in the
[1:14:46] supernatural the supernatural sometimes
[1:14:49] is so phenomenal it gets plum away from
[1:14:52] the people the people get
[1:14:54] to be good people nice people but
[1:14:56] sometimes they misunderstand
[1:14:58] and that's what that was the same thing
[1:15:01] with joseph
[1:15:02] he couldn't understand he's a son of
[1:15:05] david
[1:15:05] but he couldn't understand that how mary
[1:15:08] could conceive
[1:15:10] now no doubt with them big pretty brown
[1:15:12] eyes
[1:15:13] looking into his face said honey i know
[1:15:16] we're engaged to be married i've got
[1:15:19] something to tell you
[1:15:20] i've had a visit by gabriel and i'm
[1:15:23] conceived by the holy spirit he told me
[1:15:27] and this thing that's going to be born
[1:15:29] will not be
[1:15:30] your son it'll be the son of god and now
[1:15:33] joseph wanted to believe that
[1:15:37] but he just couldn't believe it hardly
[1:15:43] i hope i hope you're following me
[1:15:47] you see god moving in a certain fashion
[1:15:51] and we struggle to believe that
[1:15:54] we struggle to be able to enter into the
[1:15:56] supernatural
[1:15:57] we struggle to be able to lay claim to
[1:16:00] that
[1:16:02] but you know it was unusual
[1:16:06] oh but he just couldn't believe it
[1:16:07] hardly it was too hard
[1:16:09] for him to believe now saints i don't
[1:16:12] want to speak real direct to you but i
[1:16:13] guess in a way i am
[1:16:15] i think we ought to admit to ourselves
[1:16:17] there's times that we face things
[1:16:19] that are just almost too hard to believe
[1:16:23] no wonder the devil's got a foothold
[1:16:26] we got more and more christians that are
[1:16:29] rejecting the idea
[1:16:31] of a second coming or supernatural
[1:16:33] coming of jesus christ
[1:16:35] rapture more and more are rejecting that
[1:16:38] idea
[1:16:40] more and more are reasoning well
[1:16:44] he was supposed to have come a long time
[1:16:45] ago
[1:16:47] and did you know that that spirits
[1:16:49] actually moved into the realm of the
[1:16:50] message
[1:16:53] the prophet of god said that the coming
[1:16:56] of there's
[1:16:56] nothing left but the coming of the lord
[1:16:59] jesus christ
[1:17:02] and we have went what 50
[1:17:05] plus
[1:17:09] what would it be 55 56
[1:17:16] people starting to waver on this could
[1:17:18] this be right
[1:17:20] he said there was nothing left
[1:17:23] well one will have to take and put this
[1:17:26] out here as a little marker
[1:17:29] god didn't show his prophets everything
[1:17:33] that's the words of a prophet god
[1:17:36] doesn't show prophets everything
[1:17:39] but you see what's happened here now
[1:17:42] is we're seeing the supernatural
[1:17:46] taking place without
[1:17:49] explanation
[1:17:54] i want you to understand how that will
[1:17:56] throw people how that can throw you
[1:18:00] for us sometimes to believe we have to
[1:18:02] understand that's a human element
[1:18:07] but when there's no explanation
[1:18:10] why has it been 56 years
[1:18:17] just dealing with a young man he might
[1:18:19] even be hearing this
[1:18:21] asking the question brother paul
[1:18:25] brother billy paul was not supposed to
[1:18:28] be an old man before there was shark
[1:18:29] swim
[1:18:30] in front of what was that building
[1:18:34] the may company i always want to say
[1:18:36] macy's
[1:18:38] the may company ask me an honest
[1:18:41] question
[1:18:43] i said brother billy paul is not
[1:18:46] he's an old man now but you see my
[1:18:49] brother and sister
[1:18:51] one you go back and search the message
[1:18:53] for that
[1:18:55] go back and find where the word of god
[1:18:58] would substantiate that was the marker
[1:19:00] for the timeline
[1:19:02] you'll find neither
[1:19:05] so you either believe
[1:19:09] until
[1:19:13] who's going to believe and tell
[1:19:16] ah catch isn't it depends on how you
[1:19:20] digest those words
[1:19:22] i'm going to believe until something
[1:19:24] else comes along brother george i don't
[1:19:26] think he'll mind me putting this way
[1:19:28] if brother branham william branham was
[1:19:31] not the man
[1:19:33] then we need to be searching for the man
[1:19:35] because the word of god promised
[1:19:37] they would be the one who come and
[1:19:38] brought the word
[1:19:40] but you see it's easier to say he's not
[1:19:42] the man and search for nothing
[1:19:45] so i'm going to believe until
[1:19:48] can i put some dots here
[1:19:51] i'm going to believe until and brother
[1:19:53] jason singing the song tonight hit it
[1:19:55] right on the head
[1:19:57] i'm going to believe until i either see
[1:19:59] him face to face
[1:20:01] or i have paw uh crossed over that riven
[1:20:04] veil i've
[1:20:05] been laid to rest you've said the words
[1:20:07] over me you've
[1:20:08] cried tears or somebody might uh you
[1:20:11] know
[1:20:12] one way i'm going to believe and tell
[1:20:15] but it's not going to be until someone's
[1:20:17] got a better explanation or until
[1:20:18] someone's got this or until someone's
[1:20:20] got that
[1:20:20] my brother and sister i'm going to
[1:20:22] believe until i see his face
[1:20:24] or i am in his presence amen hallelujah
[1:20:27] meaning in the grave so you look at that
[1:20:31] and realize my brother and sister
[1:20:33] it's there that it does now look what
[1:20:35] brother branham go on here i got
[1:20:36] sidetracked
[1:20:37] amen this thing's going to be uh will
[1:20:39] not be your son it'll be the son of god
[1:20:41] now joseph wanted to believe that but he
[1:20:43] just couldn't believe it hardly it was
[1:20:44] too hard for him to believe
[1:20:46] but you know it was unusual women don't
[1:20:48] conceive virginally
[1:20:50] so it was unusual and that's the unusual
[1:20:53] things that god does
[1:20:54] it stumbles the people it brightens it
[1:20:57] opens the eyes of some
[1:20:59] and blinds others in the same
[1:21:02] time it always did that he
[1:21:05] the unusual things an unusual way
[1:21:08] amen now he says here uh and i'm going
[1:21:11] to
[1:21:12] well is that the next quote yeah
[1:21:15] it is same sermon amen that i was
[1:21:18] looking at let me just
[1:21:19] go back here um now look my brother and
[1:21:23] sister
[1:21:23] what was birthed in mary was of the holy
[1:21:25] ghost right
[1:21:26] that's what the word tells us now i want
[1:21:29] you to see
[1:21:30] that what was birthed in you is the holy
[1:21:33] ghost too we're having this same
[1:21:35] exact phenomena taking place
[1:21:38] in the year 2021 as
[1:21:41] took place there with mary and joseph
[1:21:44] this is birthed in you of the holy ghost
[1:21:48] it's not birthed of a man could someone
[1:21:51] say amen to that
[1:21:52] not birth of a man this is not a man's
[1:21:55] idea
[1:21:56] amen no man can bring it to pass
[1:22:00] i'll tell you my brother and sister in
[1:22:02] spite of what the world thinks about the
[1:22:04] pope
[1:22:05] he has never ever singularly brought
[1:22:08] a prayer to pass in all of their
[1:22:10] generations of popes
[1:22:13] because he's just a man he's not god no
[1:22:16] matter how they raise him up to
[1:22:17] represent god he's just a man
[1:22:20] and he cannot bring that prayer to pass
[1:22:22] but i tell you tonight if you would care
[1:22:24] to lift a hand
[1:22:26] how many has had their prayers answered
[1:22:28] how many it's supernatural we're not
[1:22:30] talking about
[1:22:31] superficial we're talking supernatural
[1:22:34] amen we see god come on the scene
[1:22:38] and we realize this is not a man's
[1:22:41] idea amen now it may have been taught to
[1:22:44] you
[1:22:45] we've been taught by good ministers of
[1:22:48] this message we've been taught
[1:22:49] amen we may have had it explained in
[1:22:52] man's wisdom so that you would
[1:22:54] understand
[1:22:54] what connected to what but the prophet
[1:22:57] of god tells you
[1:22:58] this cannot be explained it
[1:23:01] must be a revelation and there's where
[1:23:05] it breaks down of
[1:23:06] why we don't have great teaching
[1:23:07] seminars i've had people say
[1:23:09] why don't we in the message have great
[1:23:11] teaching seminars
[1:23:12] because my brother and sister without
[1:23:14] revelation there is
[1:23:16] no comprehension it takes a revelation
[1:23:19] for this
[1:23:20] word to come and stir our hearts and
[1:23:23] move us to understand the word of god
[1:23:25] hallelujah amen
[1:23:29] but it's been conceived in you
[1:23:32] tell me it isn't oh tell me it isn't my
[1:23:35] brother and sister how that mere mortal
[1:23:38] people
[1:23:38] from all over were represented by by you
[1:23:41] might say all over the world
[1:23:44] tonight right here how is it the same
[1:23:48] word
[1:23:49] producing the same thing is coming to
[1:23:52] pass in your life
[1:23:53] like my life like their life like their
[1:23:56] life
[1:23:57] because it was conceived in you of the
[1:24:00] holy ghost hallelujah
[1:24:03] it was not a great man in the south a
[1:24:05] great man in the north the east or the
[1:24:07] west
[1:24:08] it was almighty god moving in the midst
[1:24:10] of his people
[1:24:11] amen i'm telling you today saints if you
[1:24:14] will stop and ponder this
[1:24:16] this as of the holy ghost is just
[1:24:19] as supernatural as mary's conception
[1:24:24] amen millions and millions and millions
[1:24:27] of people on the earth why you
[1:24:30] why do you believe it why do you see it
[1:24:33] because it was the holy ghost come down
[1:24:36] stirring your heart opening your eyes
[1:24:39] amen
[1:24:39] coming right down to bring forth the
[1:24:42] word of life
[1:24:43] the son of god once again hallelujah
[1:24:47] now if this is a holy ghost and not a
[1:24:48] man thing
[1:24:50] we don't need or want to even wait for
[1:24:52] another day
[1:24:53] what we want to do is possess the
[1:24:55] supernatural today
[1:24:58] saints we're not looking for hope to be
[1:25:01] unfulfilled we're not looking for a day
[1:25:02] when a supernatural move is moving in
[1:25:05] the message
[1:25:06] that supernatural move is right here
[1:25:09] it's right here today
[1:25:10] and it'll be just as supernatural as you
[1:25:13] and i
[1:25:14] allow it to be we don't got to wait for
[1:25:17] some certain brother to preach some
[1:25:18] certain service or some certain event to
[1:25:21] take place
[1:25:21] the holy ghost is here the prophet of
[1:25:24] god says it over and over and over
[1:25:26] that god is here he speaks of it god is
[1:25:29] here he speaks of it as jesus christ is
[1:25:31] here
[1:25:32] he speaks of it as the holy spirit is
[1:25:34] here and he also says
[1:25:36] all of this is god hallelujah it's here
[1:25:40] now how much supernatural do you want
[1:25:43] well i'll tell you how much supernatural
[1:25:45] we'll have
[1:25:46] is just exactly how much supernatural we
[1:25:49] desire
[1:25:53] no wait we're waiting for something to
[1:25:55] happen no i'm sorry my brother and
[1:25:58] sister revelation
[1:25:59] says that the spirit and the bride say
[1:26:00] come this spirit's already saying come
[1:26:03] and the bride's got a voice now and
[1:26:05] she's saying come
[1:26:06] we could be at any moment right now
[1:26:08] right into a rapture
[1:26:10] hallelujah so here it is the limiting
[1:26:14] factor of the supernatural in our midst
[1:26:17] is you and i
[1:26:19] it is not the plan of god it is not what
[1:26:21] it is we're waiting for something
[1:26:23] we're waiting for something brother paul
[1:26:26] people have been waiting
[1:26:27] my brother and sister do you know i met
[1:26:30] a man
[1:26:32] we all understand what people took of
[1:26:35] 1977
[1:26:38] many people believed
[1:26:41] that absolutely it was coming to an end
[1:26:44] in 1977 they geared everything about
[1:26:46] their life to that
[1:26:48] i met a man that still believes it was
[1:26:51] supposed to come in 77 but
[1:26:54] something something held it up
[1:27:02] i wished i'd a voice this to him i used
[1:27:04] to not be so
[1:27:06] vocal
[1:27:10] maybe it's you sir right
[1:27:14] maybe it's you now i want to throw
[1:27:17] something at you i need to close here
[1:27:20] what if we were all you might say
[1:27:23] inspired or anointed
[1:27:27] to dig into the word
[1:27:30] into the presence of god as though it
[1:27:33] was
[1:27:34] ourself that was holding up the rapture
[1:27:39] do you follow me if you had an anointing
[1:27:42] had an inspiration that
[1:27:43] the only reason the rapture hasn't took
[1:27:45] them places my life is not ready
[1:27:47] i think we would get way way intense
[1:27:50] we would be saying lord i don't want to
[1:27:53] lord make me ready
[1:27:54] lord help me father let me get in the
[1:27:56] right position lord i want to do this
[1:27:59] we would get so sincere but you see
[1:28:01] we're all waiting
[1:28:02] and sorry i i phrase it that way but
[1:28:04] we're all waiting for something else to
[1:28:06] happen over here
[1:28:09] that would bring on the rapture
[1:28:17] that's right brother help us lord help
[1:28:20] us lord
[1:28:26] now brother branham the same sermon here
[1:28:29] quite a few paragraphs later he said i'm
[1:28:31] going to visit you talking about god
[1:28:33] according to the time of life a man that
[1:28:36] eat the flesh of a calf drink the milk
[1:28:37] from the cow
[1:28:38] eat corn cakes drinking milk a man dust
[1:28:41] on his clothes sitting there with his
[1:28:43] back turned to the tent
[1:28:44] said where is sarah thy wife said she's
[1:28:47] in the tent behind you
[1:28:48] and sarah said me an old woman as i am
[1:28:52] 100 years old as husband and wife has
[1:28:54] ceased long have pleasure with my lord
[1:28:56] and him old too in the bible said well
[1:28:58] stricken has been years and years
[1:29:00] she was 45 years past menopause or
[1:29:03] longer than that
[1:29:04] maybe 55 years past menopause and me
[1:29:06] have pleasure with my husband
[1:29:08] as a young woman she laughed up her
[1:29:10] sleeve you know
[1:29:13] and what that man that men in that human
[1:29:16] flesh said
[1:29:17] why did sarah laugh what happened
[1:29:20] abraham called that man
[1:29:21] elohim almighty god represented in a
[1:29:24] human being
[1:29:25] jesus our lord said as it was in the
[1:29:27] days of love so shall it be at the
[1:29:29] coming
[1:29:29] and watch when the son of man is being
[1:29:32] manifested man known luke 17
[1:29:35] when the son of man in the last days is
[1:29:36] being revealed the son of man being
[1:29:38] revealed his gospel
[1:29:40] is identifying as it was in the days of
[1:29:43] lot
[1:29:43] look how they're doing now now look
[1:29:46] where this this fits right to our day
[1:29:48] saints
[1:29:49] look how they're doing now perverted
[1:29:51] nations
[1:29:52] oh my look at the homosexuals look at
[1:29:54] what we got now the church is a mess
[1:29:56] the nation is a mess and the whole thing
[1:29:59] god is belching it up from
[1:30:01] top bottom of the earth the whole thing
[1:30:03] is a mess
[1:30:04] geographically also in the material the
[1:30:07] scene
[1:30:08] is set isn't it time for god to come
[1:30:11] back in human flesh
[1:30:12] the word that's sharper than two-edged
[1:30:14] sword and the discerner of the thoughts
[1:30:16] and intents of the heart
[1:30:17] to appear on the scene to make jesus
[1:30:20] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:30:21] forever
[1:30:22] it's a promised word that's been lotted
[1:30:25] for this day
[1:30:27] we're living in this day god is here
[1:30:29] with us
[1:30:30] to manifest that and make it true now my
[1:30:34] brother and sister i'll close on that
[1:30:35] right there sister emmy if you'll come
[1:30:41] could it be that we could actually
[1:30:46] how would i say this
[1:30:53] have an intensity
[1:30:56] that maybe we've never experienced
[1:30:58] before
[1:31:00] oh i'm not talking about an intensity
[1:31:02] just so we all
[1:31:03] jump and shout and run around the church
[1:31:05] or intensity of
[1:31:07] of you know speaking loudly or
[1:31:10] quoting scripture but an intensity
[1:31:14] to just submit ourself
[1:31:18] uh intensity to get up and i i saints
[1:31:21] i'm preaching to myself
[1:31:22] an intensity to get up in the morning
[1:31:24] and say lord let me die today a little
[1:31:27] more than i was yesterday
[1:31:29] lord let me just come into that place as
[1:31:32] the quote said earlier
[1:31:33] and come into that condition into that
[1:31:36] atmosphere
[1:31:39] saints also i'm trying to communicate
[1:31:41] that's all i'm trying to encourage
[1:31:44] we see the signs of the time whether
[1:31:46] kamala harris is the
[1:31:48] the testimony or the words of the
[1:31:50] prophet talking about the scarlet dress
[1:31:52] and
[1:31:52] talking about a woman in authority
[1:31:54] whether she fulfills that or not my
[1:31:56] brother and sister
[1:31:57] they're trying to pass laws in our
[1:31:59] nation this is
[1:32:00] the timepiece one of the major
[1:32:02] timepieces of scripture
[1:32:03] is it will be as in the days of lot
[1:32:06] now i want to don't want to be too crude
[1:32:08] our young people here
[1:32:10] but look in the days of lot lot offered
[1:32:12] his daughters to them
[1:32:14] and they turned down the daughters and
[1:32:16] said we want the men
[1:32:22] but look at the other perversion trying
[1:32:25] to pass a law
[1:32:28] that any man could walk in a restroom
[1:32:31] behind you sisters
[1:32:33] any man could identify himself any way
[1:32:36] that he wants to
[1:32:38] and no one under the
[1:32:42] the strength of the law can do anything
[1:32:46] about it protect it
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:52] you understand what it is scripture says
[1:32:54] in this day
[1:32:56] we often think saints that well well
[1:32:58] they're going to come under a strong
[1:32:59] delusion to believe a lie
[1:33:01] and so people are going to believe false
[1:33:02] doctrines they're going to believe this
[1:33:04] they're going to believe that
[1:33:05] look we've got big husky men i just saw
[1:33:07] a little little video clip the other day
[1:33:09] this dude must be six
[1:33:10] three six four he's got arms the size of
[1:33:12] my legs
[1:33:13] and now calls himself miss
[1:33:19] strong delusion to believe a lie
[1:33:23] utterly convinced in his mind that he
[1:33:26] was supposed to be born
[1:33:28] a woman now i don't mean to take humor
[1:33:32] out here but i'll just put it this way
[1:33:34] if he was meant to be born a woman he
[1:33:37] was meant to be born
[1:33:38] an ugly woman
[1:33:43] and the reason i say that is not to make
[1:33:44] the humor
[1:33:46] but he looks like a man
[1:33:50] because that's what he is but the person
[1:33:53] interviewing him says well
[1:33:55] if he wants to call himself miss i'll
[1:33:58] call him miss
[1:34:01] you're under a delusion too
[1:34:04] right you see but look
[1:34:08] let's not look at the flesh my brother
[1:34:10] and sister it's not a flesh warfare this
[1:34:12] is not a battle of flesh and blood
[1:34:14] this is a battle of principalities and
[1:34:16] powers of darkness
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:19] and what has helped this same anointing
[1:34:21] my brother and sister
[1:34:23] and this might sound legalistic forgive
[1:34:25] me but this same anointing
[1:34:27] of men and women and the way they dress
[1:34:30] and the way they act and
[1:34:31] how what they do with their bodies and
[1:34:33] all of this stuff and then they
[1:34:35] come under this same anointing
[1:34:38] and call themselves christians do you
[1:34:41] realize that anointing is just
[1:34:43] as disturbing as the anointing of a man
[1:34:46] calling himself a woman and a woman
[1:34:47] calling herself a man
[1:34:49] is these people living all kinds of
[1:34:51] things
[1:34:52] having pagan symbols and pagan
[1:34:54] activities
[1:34:55] and they do this and do that and yet
[1:34:57] come and claim the name of christ
[1:35:00] sister jerry spoke at the seven women
[1:35:03] claiming one man
[1:35:04] i'm sorry i meant to close but let me
[1:35:06] just share this with you
[1:35:07] we come across a deal that just shocked
[1:35:10] both of us
[1:35:11] seven men women claiming one man is that
[1:35:13] right
[1:35:14] right in the scripture what is it isaiah
[1:35:17] 4
[1:35:20] we were just listening to some christian
[1:35:22] music
