just appreciate your prayers for that we'll be back Monday and then uh just real quick I wanted to after service tonight have a quick chat with the musicians and brother Jason and everything so if you all don't mind hanging out for just a minute after church tonight amen if you have your Bibles why don't we stand this morning this evening sorry it's morning somewhere it's a morning in our hearts in our souls the rising of the Sun amen uh Second Timothy chapter three Timothy chapter three three second Timothy chapter 3 verse 1. this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God you see my goodness these people must be you know heathens in the outward expression verse 5 having a form of godliness in other words they look the part of godliness but this is what their spirit is their spirit is they love themselves selfishness they're jealous their boast they proud that's their Spirit that's who they that's who they are on the inside but on the outside they have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away so they don't they do everything but accept the power of Christ for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with diverse lusts you can apply that naturally or spiritually the woman is always the church the church is always typed as a woman so you have these these men these leaders men women in thin churches but the form of godliness but leading people away leading the church away into diverse lusts of man's opinions of the word of God ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth so they're always reading they're always finding these quotes always finding all of the stuff but they never come to the truth amen what is the truth Christ amen now as Janice and jamboree's withstood Moses so did these also resist the truth so they're disruptors in the church they're causing problems in relationships all this kind of of thing this is the their behavior pattern their behavior pattern is being laid open for us to see but if it still takes Revelation for us to identify the spirit in the church so so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further remember the Sunday morning I said but it would seem impossible but they will proceed no further so they are blocked they cannot have the victory they will proceed no further for their fathers shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was but thou has fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at Iconium at lystra which what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yea and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution it may not be persecution like the the Christians who hid in the catacombs and had to give their lives it's a it's a different but it's still persecution still persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou so look it's going to get worse the evil man they're going to get worse and worse deceiving and being deceived themselves it's going to get worse he says but this is Paul speaking to Timothy this is this is a seasoned uh this is the prophet for the age speaking to Timothy a son of God and he's saying but continue thou in the things which thou Hast learned don't get itching ears for something new and fantastic that you that dazzles your mind look for that that stimulates the spirit within you stimulates You by Revelation that's right because it's sometimes the things we've heard over and over and over again that we have a mental understanding of but not a true revelation so we could say oh here here the preacher is preaching that thing again but the word of God is like an onion for every Revelation for every scripture there's an onion and there is a deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and the center of the onion is the sweetest spot just so you know it's my favorite spot uh praise the Lord so ever so so continue which thou Hast learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou Hast learned them so it's not just what you know what you've been taught but who did it come from who is your father who is your father all scripture is given by inspiration excuse me I skipped verse verse 15 and that from a child thou Hast known the holy scriptures raised in the message I have an affinity with Timothy which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of God all scripture and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness sometimes preaching sometimes Fellowship in conversation is instruction for us along the way not every time when God moves is it an evangelistical moment it can be conversation me and Brother David fishing on the river talking about things of God I was I and I'll I'll let you sit down in a second actually I'll finish then I'll just then we'll go on so for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect not the flesh the man of God inside of you is the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works Inspire our heads Heavenly Father we pray that you just add to your word tonight speak to our hearts Lord father I pray you'd bring the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Lord that that your people tonight father they would not perceive and they would not think in their hearts that this is something I am trying to to make a point or or I'm trying to have an opinion tonight but God we just want to speak about your word we want to take a portion of your word and talk about it tonight preach about it as you've ordained Lord this is the way you've ordained it I prayed speak to us tonight Lord we're leaning heavily upon you Lord as always father I pray Lord I know I'm leaning heavily upon you I pray your congregation this this evening your people would lean heavily into you that their ears would be tuned to the right channel Lord we thank you Father may you bless your word tonight we pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated may the Lord bless his word so I kind of Ward with this thought I I had a had a kind of this sometimes the Lord stirs on your heart and you don't know exactly what what it is but you have a general theme the God begins to stealth stirring your heart and you begin to look at that theme as Brother David knows you begin to look at that theme and pray and read different things and God Narrows that into a sermon so I began to I begin to meditate it and kind of feel this moving in my spirit around Holiness and um so you know I had I thought well maybe it'll go this way maybe it'll go this way but I just I just want to say tonight that I have no desire to to use the pulpit an opinion I never desire to use the pulpit to make a point I have no desire to to cause dissension while the pastor's away um we have fellowship and we and we have a a relationship there and so we preached the word at Grace Tabernacle and so I just pray tonight that that God can speak to us and um and we can just enjoy his word because his elect no matter what it is his elect takes the word and it blesses them praise the Lord so my title tonight is impersonators of Truth I kept I kept coming on this quote and you know what I don't even think I used the quote um because it just had the line in there but it didn't have the general thought but brother random makes the comment impersonators of Truth and I I saw this a few times and I think I even read the quote on Sunday actually and so I began to sit down to begin to study and make and this this this uh this line from this quote came to me again impersonators of Truth and and so I began to think about this and and uh of uh the these scriptures started to to come and and we just read here in Timothy second Timothy where Paul is is telling Timothy look he warns them of these men that that have a certain Behavior pattern a certain working in their spirits that identify them with Darkness but he says they have a form of godliness so if you have somebody who is in in impersonating truth how can you tell they're not the real thing they have the form of godliness give me give me time here to lay this Foundation out they have a form of godliness in other words they looked apart they act apart they can say the right words well we have a quote here maybe I'll just read this um we have we have a quote here where brother Branham says that they um well we'll read it but he says that they know the Mysteries they know the Mysteries so they can talk about the Mysteries you see all the Mysteries have been revealed and you can hear people talk about this and it lines up directly and that sounds good but there's something there there's something in their lives there's a condition that they have within their spirits that don't line up with the word of God so um Genesis chapter 19. Genesis chapter 19. we're going to read about something that started in the beginning in Genesis Genesis at the beginning Genesis is the start of of the world this Genesis is the start of the Christian Journey God called Abraham out and so begin the story of the Israelites and in chapter 19 we pick up the story here of Abraham and lot lot had decided to go down into Sodom and that's where he wanted to set up and he wanted to live and so if you read the backstory we know Abraham said you know the three men came to him and the Lord and all that thing so now the the two angels have gone down to Sodom so chapter 19 Genesis 19 verse 1 and there came two angels to Sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of Sodom and not seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground and he said behold now my lords turn in so lacking revelation first of all lacking revelation so let's just take this for a second here Lots sitting in the gate in other words lot an influential man of the city he was in politics an influential man in the city he was sitting at the gate that was a spot reserved in these times for the people who had a say in what was going on in that City so now we have do you know what that means lot had to do compromise lot had to compromise to be in a position that he was in so we see compromise in law and we see a lack of Revelation but he is the nephew of Abraham so keep that connection so he says come into into your Okay so lack of Revelation but he identifies them as angels he correctly identifies them as Angels he just doesn't have a full revelation they've identified this as the message but they're lacking full Revelation now please stay with me tonight lacking the full Revelation so he says he says Terry all night wash your feet you shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said neighbor we will abide in the street all night and he pressed upon them greatly and they turn in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat ha he cooked the right meal unleavened bread you see having a form of godliness having a form of godliness this is just the word tonight Saints and so he he sets forth this meal and and it's all lines up with with with the way it should be with the way the word says and they eat but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of Sodom come past the house around both old and young all the people from every quarter and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came into thee this night bring them unto us that we may know them know them carnally nor them in fornication so you have homosexuality right there at the door of Sodom and God looks as Sin as Sin but this identifies us today what is what is right out in the open today is is is the you know LGBT movement lgbtq so that that we use that as an identification God can still save a gay person God can deliver them God does and does all the time and Sin is Sin but this identifies us with the days of law so Allah went out to the door unto them and shut the door after them so he goes out he shuts the door he says listen Brethren do not so wickedly behold now I have two daughters which have not known man two virgin daughters let me I pray you bring them out unto you and you do to them as it is good in your eyes in other words here's my daughters that are virgins go ahead and rape them this is Brother lot this is not Baptist law this is Brother lot you see the word of God follows the present day years ago lot was the Baptist the Methodist but that Spirit has moved forward with God because it's twins it's always twins there's no issues for a message believer to not accept Catholicism because but today there's a twin every time there's a Revival Revival produces twins why why does that happen the devil slips in to impersonate truth because he cannot so the devil can't the devil couldn't have created his own message his version of the message until brother Branham came and God used him because the devil cannot create anything and he doesn't know the mind of God but but the brand of the message came and the devil's behind he catches up he doesn't there's a portion of the message which is revelation of who Christ is that the devil will never understand and never be able to impersonate okay but you'll never have the wisdom or the ability to see that thing that the devil can't see unless you have the Revelation also so but so so now we have these two things so now today this is Brother lot he's going to give his daughters from the youth group out to these men of the world do with them what you want what is that does that say are we saying that that uh a brother is going to actually physically take his daughters and put them on the streets um dress a certain way as as Pro no spiritual everything we read in this story is a spiritual application today so why do you have good and I and certain situations God has is Sovereign some situations and this is what I'm what I'm addressing is that why do you see people who seem to the parents seem to be good and seem to be serving God but they don't apply that to their children that's right they let their children they don't they don't have curfew they don't have rules they don't apply chores and different things as the young age and raising up they they go do what they want they hang out with what whoever they want they do whatever they want in their room with their door shut why is that and yet those parents in church display godliness but they don't take the word and apply it to their children do you know what they're doing they're doing the same thing that lot did with his daughters I thought I told you tonight that I I Ward with this but I just gonna preach it and let God take care of it so that's what happened spiritually lot casts your spiritually these men and women are casting in the message in the message stop putting it out there no I'm not talking about you people want to put it out there do you know why people want to say the foolish version are into the nominations because it takes the responsibility away from us and we say well we're in the message Church we're safe no we're not we're safe in Christ and go you go look in the message you see over and over again but the Brown says God's pulling a bride from the church and the church from the world so um okay and they said look stand back and they said again this one fellow came into sojourn and he will need to be a judge now we will deal worse with thee than with them so apparently something had just happened where some fellow came in and they just destroyed him and so they're saying look whatever we did to him it's worse with these guys and they press sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door but the man excuse me the men put forth their hand so they the Angels Reach Out grab lot pull him in slam the door and then they Smite the men outside with blindness both small and great so that they weared themselves to find the door so they blinded them they couldn't find the door and we know that brother bear uses that you know Billy Graham and brother Oral Roberts blinded the eyes of the people but this is today we're looking at lot and his family and what transpired today verse 30 same chapter and lot went up out so he leaves Sodom his wife turns into a pillar of salt and Sodom is destroyed and lot flees the zor but he's scared to stay in zor so he goes up into the caves behind zor and the mountain uh 31 and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the Earth come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him and that we perceive excuse me preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose and it came to pass on the moral that the firstborn said unto the younger behold I lay yesterday with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night and also so on verse 37 and the firstborn Barry's son and called his name Moab the same as the father of the moabites unto this day and the younger she also buries son and called his name benami the same as the father of the children of Ammon unto this day so we take here so so now a lot look look look what kind of let me tell you something and you and you know this stuff those girls didn't just suddenly become that way they were already anointed by a spirit of fornication they already they already had the level of knowledge and worldly at worldly wise of what to do get him drunk get pregnant they knew it they knew how to do it so who were they hanging out with who was coming to dinner and saying afterwards and playing in the bedroom growing up what was Lot not teaching them what was Lot not doing when he was too caught up with building his own life you see these are this a lot was maybe in in any 10 in in in intentions a good man but his desires were toward his worldly gain more so than the App application of the word of God amen so law doesn't spend the time raising his children he spends the time raising his career there was neglect there was neglect first of all lot should have never even been in Sodom so that's a whole nother sermon but you see what happens is now these two virgins they go and and they commit fornication with their father and bring forth their own children and one of those children is the moabites so we could say well Billy Graham and Oral Roberts went to lot and and then so lot and then the uh the the his daughters and all this so well then moabites must be the denominations right but let's let's let's pause there a second because Moab is Israel's brother Israel is the church not all Israel is Israel but from Israel is coming comes and elect people from the church The Message Church comes and elect bride an elect people so Moab is Israel's brother so now um law the father committed fornication with his own daughters this brought the seed of antichrist because a lot had no revelation so from this man from the nominations come this that's where the devil carries his seed through through this through through you know serpent seat and it's the twin but the devil carries his seed down through time in the denominations but then what happens is that came across and that mixes and brother Branham identified says it's not the Baptist it's not this it's when man's ideas mix with the word of God so God ordained a certain way for the seed to be brought and while this is happening Abraham's on the backside of the desert and shortly after this this time we see Isaac and Rebecca but the seed the child brought forth under the correct conditions according to the word of God Rebecca of Virgin the the lot's daughter's revergence but it was the wrong seat it was the wrong it was the right act perverted so it was a perversion so the devil's bringing forth so from law the denomination that that idea he brings that down now we have now we have this this the this um parallel here we have Moab and Israel so um this brings forth the seed of the Antichrist because Abraham and law came out together there was a Revival Abraham came out lot piggybacked on that the twins out of that Revival and around the same time you have Isaac and Rebecca and Esau and all of that happened close to the same time that you have lot and and his daughter so one brought the seed of redemption and the other the the the seed of the Antichrist so now moab's doing their own thing and Israel is doing their their own thing according to the word of God so brother Branham says here he says in the pergament church age he says the story is found in Numbers chapter 22 through 25. now we know that Israel was the chosen people of God they were the Pentecostals of their day they had taken a refuge under the blood they had all been baptized in the Red Sea they came up out of the waters singing in the spirit and dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost while Miriam the prophetess played her tambourine well after a certain time of journeying these children of Israel came to Moab you remember who Moab was he was the son of law by one of his own daughters and law in turn was a nephew of Abraham so Israel and Moab were related I want you to see that he says the moabites knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not that's right that's right they knew the truth having the form of godliness so now they come to a place for a long time it was just Israel and Moab doing their thing but then there came a Time there came a time where Israel came face to face with Moab for the first time saying to God that's where we are today amen amen for a Time the message Church did their thing if you will give me the Liberty to say it like this did their thing brother Branham all everyone that went to Message Church believed brother Branham all of this stuff did the thing came across the desert had the Red Sea experience had all of these things but then they came face to face with their own brethren moas you see it's not people it's a spirit that Spirit never leaves incidentally the spirit of the mo that religion of belpure a Porsche a section if you want to call it was sacrificing children and that's what that spirit will do will cause you to do like lot did and sacrifice your children to the world amen so and that's straight to the point but that's the word of God tonight and and I trust that you just take that to heart because saying to God we have to watch what our kids read we have to know what they're eating even if you have to sit and read a novel for ages 8 through 12. to you sit read it know what your kids are eating thumb through it we go to the library and I don't say this to lift myself up I say this to to give you maybe an idea we go to the library for books all the kids they bring their books and I check them even kids books amen there are there are kids books that have descriptions of how to act immorally that are for kindergartners you have to know what they're reading you have to know what they're watching one of the rules we have in our house unless under certain situations certain conditions where we're present there is they can only VeggieTales or something like that but even then you have to check that stuff what are they watching you know what I it's it's a shameful for me to say it but there was a point in time as a father where we would put on you know say Curious George or something on YouTube and leave it until I identified commercials and the endless playlist on YouTube and YouTube has these sneaky algorithms that are anointed at the devil that will pull in stuff don't leave your kids exposed to the internet with the device in their hand that's just being a good parent that's applying the word until your children have the ability to say this is wrong and this is right you're all their Holy Spirit and sometimes that means they're going to cry and scream for two hours but I'd rather deal with a crying screaming kid for two hours then hand them over the devil and say go ahead rape their spirit because that's what happens we have to know this stuff saying to God it's and you know what people are going to make fun and they're going to say oh you were just over parenting you are you are too involved let kids be I believe kids should be kids with a safety net with a fence around them say hey you're not because you're not going to send your kid you might give your kid and I don't say this directly to anybody just an example you might give your kid a phone and say you know just you have all the access the internet wherever you want whenever you want and I'm not going to monitor it that's the same thing as sending your two-year-old who knows nothing about highways out in front of your house and say go ahead at my house I have that busy road go ahead without an offense you would never do that you do the same thing when you hand them over to the internet praise the Lord God the Lord can apply that the balm and Gilead because saying to God I've had to deal with it I've had to face it where it's like I would rather give them the device and go take a nap because I have been up for 48 hours almost straight but I can't it's not easy it's hard to do and sometimes you have to change your life you have to restructure your life okay okay you have to use wisdom the Lord says be wisest serpents as harmless as doves sometimes we have to use wisdom and do things maybe there isn't a scripture for it but it's the uh it's the love letter it's what's between the lines and just say you know what the way we're running our house we're going to do a different you're going to go go to bed at this time instead of this time and and we're gonna not eat this stuff because it affects us a certain way and you use those things and you apply better Behavior patterns in your children and I know I'm young and I still have a lot to learn I'm not as wise and and and as uh decorated as brother Mary on child raising but these are just things that in in my young age that I've learned um and and you can use that and then you don't have to you know I think you understand what I'm saying so foreign says that they um the nephew of Abraham so the moabites knew the truth whether they lived it lived up to it or not he says in um I think it's uh the sardisian church age he says another illustration that we might take is the story of Israel leaving Egypt for Canaan land God's purpose in this age was to bring Israel out and to take them in to the end that they might serve him so out and in that's what that's where I was I just remember my spot before we Israel and Moab they're doing their own things now they're face to face these are the spirits face to face that's where we are today they are face to face in our church yes our church not people these might be Spirits I might anoint a person for a season but God delivers them the only thing that that seals your fate is a blasphemy in the Holy Spirit because it's Spirits not people you could say oh brother Chris is talking about that church over there no I'm not I'm talking about the spirit because that Spirit can live anywhere the spirit of Christ God brought me out but you could look at me at some point in time and question me but God brought me out you do not know what God's doing in a church that might be different you don't know what goes into the people to the people there praise the Lord I'm just going to leave it there it's it's getting too uh particular not too it's getting too uh anyways too obvious so another illustration that we might take is the story of Israel living Egypt for Canaan land so God's calling Israel out and into the word of God but the man always emphasizes out but in because lots of people come out as we're looking at tonight lots of people come out but they never go in Judas came out but he never went in and if you don't go in you go back out only two ways to take them in to the end that they might serve him thus when they left Egypt they all came out under the blood of the sacrificial lamb they all went through the waters of baptism in the Red Sea they all enjoyed the mighty Miracles all eight of the Manna all drank of The Rock and insofar as obvious external blessings and manifestations were concerned they all partook in like an equal manner so they had the physical manifestations of the anointing they danced with Miriam they had this outward expression oh hallelujah praise God but when they came to Moab those who joined in the Feast of belpure they all died their carcasses fell in the wilderness that's what I take I just want to take this brother Ron told me he mentored me as a as a minister for a few years as you know he told me he said brother Chris when you feel that he says ride the wave write it out when when Bell peor happened and that man brought his moabite wife into the sanctuary of God Phineas took his Spear and chased them and ran them through Phineas was not Moses he was a priest that's right he was of the levitical priesthood God has ordained fiefold Ministry who can identify that Spirit when it walks in the church physically spiritually and God gives them the ability anoints them to speak the word of God if you go and you look that's how God works through the scriptures God doesn't just isn't going to take something in the New Testament and just change it he came to how's it amplify the Old Testament he says this is the type this is how it is today but that's God's gonna run the same way all the way through he's going to run the same way all the way through and he's never amen he never changes so their carcasses fell in the wilderness for it was there that they refused the word of God and turned from it so they confessed the word they confessed they believed they had a form of godliness but there came a showdown that's why the scripture says in in Timothy he says it says but they shall proceed no further for their Folly shall be made manifest unto all men as theirs also was so there comes a point where that Spirit within them is openly identified by all men but what damage are they going to do in that time to those who aren't aware of what's going on to those who aren't studious to the word to catch the two spirits in the framework of the church you say oh well you know you can't you can't live life like well I'm seed I'll make it first of all let me just throw my opinion in there in here I don't believe seed will ever say that so there you have it anyways so their carcass fell in the wilderness for it was there that they refused the word of God and turned from it now this is what Hebrews 6 verse 1 to 9 speaks of which was brought out so carefully in the pergament church pergament age you can't go along with just part of the word you have to take all the words so saints of God this is the burden of my heart because why do people sit and accept part of the word that's right what anoints someone to sit in a church that is only part word it's a burden I I feel the pain and I wonder why but the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and we all have to have a testimony but it's the preaching of the word the preaching of the true word through the chosen vessel aligning with the word of God that brings forth Liberty in the in the camp Aiken was the only one out of all the capital of Israel that denied the word of God but it caused the rest of the camp to fall now that's I've had people use that and say whoa I had sin in my life so I left the church because I didn't want to hinder to church that's not what that means it can willingly sinned and willingly hidden had no desire whatsoever to put that from him though you're fighting something in your life and you had the desire and it keeps coming back and it keeps coming back and God has not yet delivered you that does not mean you are hindering the house the church we are here to to build you up we are here to stand with you and walk through this with you it's when and there comes a point and I've heard I've heard many stories from pastors who have had to do this where you say look don't bring your child to church anymore they don't have or excuse me let me let me let me back that up leave this to the pastor to clarify but there are times where it's just you know what they have no desire whatsoever and they're just being a hindrance that's a totally different thing that's Aiken but when that person has a desire in their heart to serve God though they have to drag themselves to church sometimes but there's something inside there that's that's different okay praise the Lord so yeah you can't go along with just part of the word you have to take all the word there are people who seem involved in the things of God almost 100 percent do you realize do you realize how close that is do you realize how hard that is to identify and it can take time and prayer for you to identify that spirit even even if you're seasoned even if you've been sometimes it's just this little funny we we express it in the English language as a funny feeling but really it's the stirring of the spirit of God that's still small voices saying something's not right and you just have to apply prayer that God would lead you right and so Services happen like this tonight um you okay so there are people who seem involved in the things have got almost 100 they are like Judas no one but Jesus knew exactly what kind of a person Judas was no one but Jesus knew exactly what kind of a person Judas was so who can tell you who Judas is the word of God that's it there's no other way to find out there's no other way to find out so the day came and same with to find out who's Peter who's John who's what all the disciples it takes the same Christ to identify within you that brother that sister okay you see how you see you see how important it is to serve God as close as possible I listened to the sermon today Valley making make the valley full of ditches and brother man talks about this the old Scottish guy that was looking for someone to take him across the mountains in a stagecoach and the first two guys says oh I can full Gallop get within six inches of the edge and the next I saw well I can get in full gasket within four inches of the edge and that third guy says well I don't know about any of that but I can stay as close to the side as close as far away from the edge as possible and the guy said you can give me a ride over the mountains it's not as close as you can get to the line and still serve God it's how far away from it can you get it doesn't it's not well this heel is two inches three is it's the anointing behind that it's either a heel or it's not so let's get as far away from that as possible I heard I was listening to monster preach a good friend of mine and and he was he was making a comment and he said you know some people can get hypocritical and they can judge people because they see someone doing a certain thing and they say well you know how dare they you know I but he said everyone has their own weaknesses and their own struggles so if your weakness is high heels wear flats if you don't have a problem with that you don't have to worry you're not going to get into the high heels you know I don't have a problem with dyeing my hair pink so I can go in the hair dissection and not worry about it you understand that's a funny example but there's some people that that though they're they're the bottle alcohol was their weakness they can't even walk in that section of the store so they stay away from it that's not to say we can't walk by that section if we don't have you understand what I'm saying to say there's everyone has their weaknesses that you have to keep guarded so don't judge what you are able to do by what someone else is able to do judge it by your own self if you can't do Instagram if you if that's your weakness don't even go there people people can use social media as a tool and it's totally fine but there's some people that just can't handle it so don't even put don't even go there they might be okay they might be able to keep it in check and just be a tool but if you can't and you just you're Doom scrolling till 3am or you're looking at stuff you shouldn't be looking at don't even bother signing up and if you need help permanently deleting it come talk to me [Laughter] right get as far away from the this is practical sometimes I know what's helped me is to hear it's spoken practically like that we say you hear a preach all the time get as far away from the devil as possible but sometimes especially young people sitting there you remember when I was a young person well what does that what does that mean can you give me some real life example that's what that means don't even go there there's certain areas of the story just avoid right there's certain things you just avoid because I I like to avoid malls as a man I don't even want to go there that's staying as far away from the devil as possible but you see people who who do that anyways man they struggle because they're riding the line anyways praise God so um he says um what does he say where are we here so the uh the the day came that Judas did exactly what Israel did at belpure he decided that he wanted to join with the false Divine forces enter in to the financial political organization of anti-word antichrist religion and he did so he was fooled he was fooled the other 11 were not they could not be for they were the very elect Ed God you don't have to be live in fear of being deceived but you do have to live in fear of am I as close to God as possible that's right that's the kind of Godly fear Godly fear isn't well what is this true is brother Chris is it true is what the Davidson what the Paul said Is it true that no that's not what it is it's saying I don't want that to happen to me so Lord please hold me tight hold me tight they could not be for they were very like so when Judas left and betrayed the Lord his name was removed from the book of life we just heard about that beautiful set of sermons about that so now I am sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in The Book of Life were a part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true God and worship of him though they did not worship according to the truth so they centered around the true God and the worship of him but they didn't worship according to the truth where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty you want to identify you want to identify a church look at the women and the young people because you're going to identify the spirit of that church the worship according to the truth is there Liberty there's times where we struggle with things and then we overcome them but it shouldn't be years and years and years and years and years and years of the same thing over and over and over again if you see that in a church something's not quite lining up that's right now that person can be in in because you understand what I'm saying so like you just like Judas they didn't go all the way see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge he shared knowledge of mysteries I've read this many times and I I that stuck out to me tonight a knowledge of the Mysteries this is how in in and this is how you can hear people who once were of the message preaching these things they have the knowledge of these Mysteries but no true Revelation if they had true Revelation they would be here with us praise the Lord and that that'll get them riled up for me to say that but that's just because that's the devil but it's the truth show me in the Bible where it's not true you shall find me a religion that's better than this that has is more life changing than this that has gives me the power to overcome every day of my life that is changing me that is making the best husband I can be the best father I can be the best son I can be the best brother I can be show me something that gives me liberty there's nothing else if come too late see how Judas was chosen of God and and shared knowledge of the Mysteries he had a Ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in Jesus name but when The Showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit this is just like the scripture was the seven women they want the man's name but they don't want their relationship they want the name of of of of of the message they want the name of Christ but they don't want relationship they want everything that goes with it but these these people shall proceed no further that should have been my subtitle that's right they shall proceed no further they will do their Folly they will re wreak their Havoc for a season but there will come a day there will come a day where there it'll be known it'll accommodate when everything will be known and only shall bow he shared knowledge of the mystery he had a Ministry of power healed the sick cast out devils in Jesus name saying to God that's why you can't identify the word of God by this kind of stuff the signs that's why you can't identify the truth by that because they do the same thing what identifies the truth is the word that's right what is the word I don't want to see exactly I don't wanna I don't care about outward manifestations as a man sometimes I do I like to see you get excited because it encourages me when I'm preaching but that's not the way God works I I don't I'm not trying to to say I'm on this side and they're on that side I I don't want to be that way no I don't be that way one minute because guess what I've danced and I've shouted amen amen but are you dancing are you shouting because you're revelated or you're dancing you're shining because the music changed and so that's fine but don't use that now all I'm saying all I'm saying is that's fine that's good that's healthy but the member says if your Evolution doesn't have emotion go bury it it needs emotion but don't use that to gauge your spiritual Journey Don't gauge that to to to to for a church because there's churches I've been in who who can do that but there's something off with the women and the youth that's right there's something not lining up with the word of God they get up and they can sing and they can do all of these things and they can have the hour manifestations and have the Miracles but don't use that to say that church is on the word don't do that don't use that to say that person has a revelation will it brown before he even really knew what was going on in his life he did that he was at at a meeting to him he didn't he didn't properly identify he did this what I'm about to tell you he said the meeting he sees two men speaking tongues carnally says they must I want what they have they gotta be so he goes and he fellowships with them he goes and he talks to them and he contacts their Spirit he was a prophet operating at different office but as a holy ghost filled people you have the same ability say God give me wisdom and you go and you speak to that person or you go and identify that situation or you watch you say God I'm gonna watch give me give me Revelation because sometimes people can be saying things I've heard this happen some people can be saying things preaching a certain way and you think you think well they definitely are they they definitely say well if we have the emotion then we got God but then you watch them and you hear them and you say no they have a true understanding but sometimes we just it comes out the wrong way but you watch their life and you watch their Ministry and you see go God directly this is how this happened to me God directly identified they have a true understanding of the balance but it took me time of prayer and watching to catch that so remember does the same thing he goes one man's a holy ghost filled Christian the other one had two families one was a brown-haired woman one was a blonde-haired woman he had kids with both fornication so you can't use that to identify but the spirit of God always makes known the folly praise God so but when The Showdown came he sought out for Golden and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way those are capitalized in the church age book I didn't capitalize him for this quote the word all the way this is that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right there when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the Book of Life the power of transformation is that right you can cross that line like the children of Israel did in their Journey coming through the Wilderness Israel did the same after they heard Moses's message and seen it Vindicated listened to a false prophet so they saw the signs they were part of the signs but still they listened to the Antichrist false prophet that's what false prophet is Antichrist anything false is Antichrist Antichrist isn't this capital a automatically the pope it's just anything that's not Christ the opposite of Christ so smoking a cigarette is Antichrist false prophet that said uh oh now look children we're all the same we should marry one among another now you you take marriage through the scripture marriage spiritually means accepting seed accepting seed it's not just it's not just you maybe hung around the wrong people or you you were in the wrong church for a while it's not that it's that you accepted it you accepted that false Doctrine you married it and you accepted that seed now that seed takes dominance that's what that's why that's why God God was so upset with bell peor with what happened there because they married them he wasn't upset because they looked and they lost it after the women he was upset because they took them contrary to the word of God brought them and then gave seed seed reserved for the line of of for the line of Israel seed reserved for that and they they gave it to those moabites they mixed the word of God with man's idea a nation that came from fornication that's that's the that's the father of the Antichrist is fornication look what happened with with uh Eve and the serpent fornication Eve was reserved for Adam Eve was Adam's wife and she committed adultery with that you'll even see some situations where a a person who had doesn't uh um say say for example a pastor who is not lined up with the word of God you can see that Spirit of fornication manifest either in him or his church physically so he says okay he says is that right you can cross the line the children of Israel did in their Journey they cross the line which means there's no going back but you see that man God I just love the word of God it's so beautiful because God just takes it and he says you know what in two thousand three thousand years later there's going to be someone who's going to struggle with this this this this so I'm going to lay it out here and I'm going to bring this Edge case we call it and I'm going to show hey don't worry about that the reason they cross the line you say well what if I cross the line if you're worried about that you haven't crossed the line what happened was they cross the line because they took they crossed the seed amen then you see you say okay what kind of attributes did they have that man brought that woman right into the congregation all of Israel was weeping before the Lord asking forgiveness not the ones that had taken but asking to stay the pestilence from our land because of what our brothers did and he waltzes in with the false word of God he's trying to bring it in and what's he trying to do Again mix it and say look let me sit down with my wife mobile wife and be okay in the church if they would have allowed it the pest the plague would have continued to Ravish their their people that's the problem is I think you can fill in the blanks there but that's why marriage and divorce is so important that's right because God marriage is God's if I can say this other Cardinal way it's his thing that's what he's all about amen because you can't deny that seed if a woman gets if my when my wife got pregnant with our first child there was nothing she could do to say that child wasn't mine nothing why today when we have the full open Word of God do we also have DNA testing why God showing natural types of spiritual you cannot deny it you cannot deny it amen praise the Lord so he says um marry one another we should do this and Moses had told them different so the message said otherwise and seeing God Vindicated so Moses told them different God Vindicated Moses's word because Balaam seemed to be more a more instructive man than Moses was see he had come from a great nation where there was great people was all organized together the land of Moab you see Israel the true church is living out of tense went into slavery had all these problems as a nation and here is Moab all set up fancy living their life they look like they had their act together I know I've said this before but it's just one of my my favorites if Mary walked through the church doors today pregnant would you believe her Moab God doesn't do things the way we think he should God doesn't do things the way we think he should and sometimes we miss it but if we stay close to him if we stay close to him that's why you know what any sermon that's preached me Brother David brother Paul you go travel somewhere else but the berry wherever you go it can all boil down to two things devotions and prayer my wife and I we can we can make money we can travel the world we can go over here and go over there but if we don't have conversation and time together there's no relationship she might reap the benefits of my wallet but there's no relationship unless we have conversation and we have time together that's why in any sermon any is remember the Brandon priest can boil down to those two things devotion and prayer that's why they're fundamentally that's where your relationship with God is built upon amen that's where it starts I've told the class this Sunday morning the youth you it's not like well today I just didn't get to it no you know what by God's grace I've learned maybe my morning started out like the other morning I was up till the other day I was up till midnight working and I my wife comes in I said she let me sleep and and I rolled out of bed right into a meeting I didn't have a choice so I stopped when I could and I said God forgive me and I took time with him that's how important it is you're gonna say oh well I didn't get to it today you have to do it it's not you can't miss a day you do you wonder what why aren't happy why you're grumpy we have this joke in my in my in my in our house we will ask each other you and Kristen well did you read your Bible today no I didn't that's all told me you go go to your room I watch the kid you go read your Bible that it's unimportant the battle is so hot today the battle is so hot today so we have to keep on the firing line we've got to keep our sword we've got to keep our relationship with Christ amen the land of Moab great armies great things that the people in them days would have feared and here come a prophet down a prophet anointed one false anointed one see it's not just the anointing it's not just the anointing the only thing is important and everything is needed but we can't just focus on the anointing that's why brother random preached the message false anointed ones you know what if you have a question about something you know what I do I open the table app and I'll search sermons I'll put in one word like say um the other day what was it the other day I don't remember but it was something you know let's just say for example if I could think of one you could say well um transformation we want to be we want to be transformed not conformed what does that mean you type in the word transform and you'll find sermons or search what I'll do is I'll get the table and I'll search a line or something and I'll look for a sermon where he says that a bunch of times and I'll listen to that sermon God has given us all we need everything we need it's right there and he's given us the ability to find it because Balaam okay we'll get through this quote I promise see come down to be the to be to an anointed one taught the people and many of them went after that don't you never forget that see went after the thing that wasn't the word the Vindicated proven word it sounded right but it wasn't the word so praise the Lord now uh we're closing here shortly the revelation of Jesus Christ now remember this Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of Acts what does that mean well we can look to the book of Acts for an example of how we should be but the Book of Revelation shows that how that Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it would come which means today it's happening and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless Aiken in the camp making the church lukewarm formal and Powerless formal that's religious oh man we make fun and we say that some people might say it that way that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about dry you say brother Chris you just talked about it it's not emotions you see why it's all things in balance there's even there's even laws in this in the new in the Old Testament the levitical law where it says don't have unbalanced weights in your bags that's how much God loves balance amen amen that's how much he loves balance so formally we don't want to be formal and Powerless or lukewarm it exposes Satan the revelation of Christ exposes Satan revealing his works this is a very familiar quote I I would hope so anyways attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word so undermining well the pastor that's just his opinion don't ever take somebody's word for something go find it in the Bible you know our pastor sometimes says don't read ahead and in a sense you know when he's when he's preaching as as a as a church we ought to already be catching what he's what's coming next because we're in the word we know where he's going we and we say Amen you know what an amen from somebody who knows where you're going as a minister I'm going to say this an amen from somebody who knows where you're going really has a punch to it but anyone amen from somebody who's just oh cool right but when they know where you're going it has a special anointing to it it has a punch to it amen you want to get the devil a big black guy amen revealing his Works attempted destruction right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire so he's not gonna stop until he's destroyed for good he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a tribulation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church are we in the Christian church today yes we are the two spirits in the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit how do you withstand it by God's spirit through discernment Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert why does he use that example there's lots of others examples why did he use that example because Christ didn't call fire from heaven Jesus she just didn't use some kind of special power he's quoted his own word and tell you well you know this is this is the thing in like the fitness industry right oh yeah this is how I got so jacked and all they're doing is giving you they're telling you that so you'll buy their program but how they really got jacked is a totally different story I don't know where I was going with that oh but when they when they used but when so when Jesus says look fight the enemy with his word with the word of God find any with the word of God then if you went to Desert and fought the Devil by calling fire from heaven how could we trust him but he said fight the Devil with the word of God then when he came on Earth and he was put to that same test he did the exact same thing amen you want to see how to be successful you know you have different situations or you know you want to see how to be a successful Christian watch successful Christians and follow after after them which in turn will cause you to follow after Christ I hope you understand what I'm saying so praise the lord we watch the people we watch the word of God that talks to talk and walks the walk that's right both of those things amen musicians want to come tonight I don't want to hold you late on a Wednesday night um never thought I had that problem Brother David if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits then the framework of the Christian Church By God's spirit desert and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be thwarted okay yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them the Gates of Hell might be present in your home tonight but you can prevail by God's word and sometimes the word of God just takes physical application [Music] you may find this interesting you can just take it for what it's worth sugar negatively affects me and my kids so we try to keep sugar out of the house because if it's out of the house I'm not gonna eat it it's easy I have no temptation if you're tempted with high heels just take them out of the house even if you're like huh but I paid 150 bucks for these just get them out of the house even if you don't feel like it even if you don't feel like it and then maybe you go and you buy another pair maybe you did that and you bought another pair and you're here tonight just do it again and eventually God will take that desire from you God will show you and give you discernment amen praise the Lord [Music] but saints of God the story doesn't end there God loves a conjunction [Music] and but what was where was Abraham when all this chaos was happening to lot and his family in Sodom and Gomorrah oh yeah he was on the back side of the desert In the Heat of the day but he was with God you see let's back this hole up we talked about how you can avoid becoming like lot when you're in that situation a saints of God we are much better off when we never even go there if Allah would have never went to Sodom he would never have to go through any of that right but he went to saw him in your life in your families sometimes there's an opportunity to do something I believe the ash Downs are annoying I'm not saying move right I'm not talking about them so don't get that idea in your head but there's something you're going to do stop and pray about it you say it can be as simple as well do we want to let you know are our kids uh participate in this certain activity because you know physical energy and exercise that's all very important so there's certain things but you but says we would get in less trouble if we would pray about every decision we make every decision so if lot would have stopped and said you know I'm going to pray about this Abraham I appreciate the offer um let me take a few minutes to go pray he would have not went down to Sodom it doesn't matter what it is but especially if it's something that's going to now involve your family in something stop and pray say God is this the right thing to do amen is this you what and it could be something that's that's good but is it taking time away from what's important I've had you know we we did we did a t-ball with with my my son and I coached it and everything but and some people are going to maybe judge this but I said we stopped it after that and I said I don't want to do that again it was fine it's t-ball it's it's hilarious right but why get him involved in something 10 years down the road it's going to become a burden that he's going to have to break [Music] sure go get him into rock climbing go get him into hiking and mountain biking because they can do that the rest of their life in something they're going to become so taken with that they become a teenager now they have to fight that [Music] we heard something just a while back in a sermon our pastor's Ministry talked about fishing and hunting people can get out of balance with those but that's something you can do the rest of your life and actually greater connected with God see what I'm talking about it's physical applications it's things that you do music right before you do things with music say is this what I want my kids to to play sure there's certain things you know like like Beethoven right that's not bad that's not a Christian song Christian music but it's not bad it's Beethoven it's Symphony but watch be careful that that doesn't lead your children deeper because you have the Holy Spirit you have discernment but do your kids and say well we can listen to Beethoven and that's not a Christian song why can't we listen to this and I'm not talking against Beethoven I hope you can have this room I understand what I'm saying watch where something's going to lead your family Look Down the Road God has given us that eagle anointing in this day and age to look down the road say God give me wisdom look down lord is this a good thing to do is this what I should be allowing and you young people different things in your life that you enjoy look down the road and say can I is this something that is sustainable as a Christian down the road it's not sustainable to eat McDonald's every day but uh Big Mac or a Double Quarter Pounder with cheese is okay once in a while [Music] it's not sustainable long term you will die physically a painful death spiritually you see what I'm saying it's things that you start now that aren't contrary to the word of God but look into the future where is it going to take you what is going to happen you say a little split is okay but where does a little split take you down the road but the runner said split no he didn't say well this long or this long or this short he said split so then where does that take you down the road say well I have spirits of discernment I can stop at a certain point but what about your children how far is it going to take it rough hey man that's powerheads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I trust your people tonight would receive your word I you know My Heart Lord Jesus said let's pray you just come Lord we love you Lord and we want to serve you and we're living in a dangerous time God where sometimes we have to say these things just straight but God I know the true elect of God will receive it Lord I don't have to worry about the rest but got a desire to see everyone come higher I desire myself my wife my children for us to come higher up other things that are are okay but but take us from you that pull us from holiness other things in our life that that are that are going to be stumbling blocks in two years two months Lord help us father to have discernment to look down ahead and time to plan for the future [Music] we don't spend all our paycheck as we know down a couple of weeks we're going to have bills to pay God life is always calling on on us to pay dues probably want to have you there to raise that standard which is us up to meet that I pray Lord that your words would just be accepted tonight Lord I thought that we could open our arms as Mary did on that day and say beat unto me according to your word it's painful sometimes to apply the word apply the word Lord and you stretch your arms out on the cross and you took the pain because you were keeping your word God we want to keep your word too whether it means being crucified by our friends our family our closest family our closest friend moving him lay our desires on the cross surrender to you no matter what you call upon us to do we will be there to answer yes Lord a gift Jeff the had a word to keep though it cost him dearly he kept that word help us Lord [Music] help me Lord to be so tied to you and even when the preacher preaches something to me that's verbatim and obvious that I could accept it and say God forgive me help me to toe the line we love you Lord Jesus I thank you Lord for your word tonight [Music] so precious to me the Lord so pray ERS to me and I love you [Music] yes I love you because you first loved me you'll sing it tonight Lord you are so proud precious to me [Music] Lord you are so precious to me and I love you yes I love you because you've First Love Lord you are so gracious to me Lord you are so great just to me Lord you are so great just to me and I love of you yes I love you because you've heard me [Music] you know it's God's grace that brings us correction

because you first love me you are so faithful Lord you are so faithful to me Lord you are so faithful to me and I love you yes I love you because First Love Me amen Lord Jesus we thank you Father tonight Lord may you be with each one as they travel home keep them safe I pray they would each come expecting Sunday morning to hear again your word Lord Jesus father things were said tonight Lord that struck a heart that was corrected I pray that you would now come with your word your presence and spread the balm of Gilead to show father your people that sometimes we apply things and we don't feel like it but oh God the reward we reap can apply your word completely outweighs the sacrifice we have to make Lord Jesus we just thank you may you be with us now we pray for our pastor as he would travel to Johannesburg or that area there Lord South Africa or to speak a couple of Youth Camps Lord I pray you just come and anoint father with the true word Revelation would speak Lord you would speak father to those youth Lord that you would draw a line in the sand Lord Jesus if need be and they would step into your presence Lord we love you father we thank you we commit ourselves into your hands tonight and precious name we pray amen let's just sing Lord you are so good to me again and you're dismissed at will God bless you Lord you are so pray precious to me Lord You Are so proud
