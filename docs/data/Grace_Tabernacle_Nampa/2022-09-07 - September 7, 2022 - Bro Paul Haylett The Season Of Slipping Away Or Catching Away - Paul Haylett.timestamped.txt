[34:27] um look forward to that let's not forget
[34:30] one week from now Lord willing our
[34:32] brother Marcus Becker will be traveling
[34:34] through and uh looking forward to a
[34:38] wonderful Wednesday evening uh just
[34:41] hearing the gospel preached in brother
[34:45] Marcus's perspective and I I like
[34:47] brother Marcus's perspective I like his
[34:51] his approach to the word of God and so
[34:54] let's just remember share this maybe
[34:57] we'll put that on the WhatsApp to just
[35:00] get people reminded to come out make
[35:02] sure they don't miss this so let's just
[35:04] remember each and every one that uh for
[35:07] whatever reason might not be here
[35:08] tonight life gets busy I'll say that and
[35:13] sometimes whether we don't feel well or
[35:16] circumstance but just lift them up in
[35:19] prayer Also let's just stand I want to
[35:21] speak to you maybe on a a kind of a
[35:24] different title tonight and thank you
[35:26] you sister Ruth brother Jason he didn't
[35:30] even say a peep in the back room
[35:33] yeah my oh my
[35:35] brother Sean always enjoy the guitar
[35:39] I want to speak to you on the overall
[35:41] topic once again of our present
[35:43] circumstances
[35:45] and as we look at this my brother and
[35:47] sister
[35:48] anybody have a circumstance today
[35:51] yeah I don't think we can make it
[35:52] through a single day of life
[35:55] without a circumstance amen I want to
[35:59] greet our our visitor come back good to
[36:01] see you again sister and our brother
[36:04] Mitch amen it's just we had a lovely
[36:06] time with your parents and and Saints
[36:11] his mom is not named Kimberly
[36:15] his mom's name's Jennifer
[36:17] and uh so you talk about a serious need
[36:21] to eat some shoe leather uh uh and
[36:25] what's worse is I never even caught it
[36:27] I just would have made that history and
[36:31] uh sister Jennifer has quite a sense of
[36:33] humor and she
[36:35] sore spot where she rubbed that in but
[36:38] it's good to see your brother Mitch
[36:42] so as we look at this I want to take out
[36:45] of the scripture tonight uh just a view
[36:48] as it would be maybe a little different
[36:51] perspective paint a picture
[36:53] and we could stop and look at that
[36:55] picture
[36:56] speak to you on the season
[36:58] of the slipping away
[37:00] or the catching away you realize this is
[37:03] all the same season
[37:05] and so
[37:07] I'll just I'll just get right into my
[37:09] thought without pre-pre-preaching
[37:12] it will turn to Luke the 6th chapter
[37:15] verses 43 through 49 and
[37:20] you might say brother Paul how does this
[37:22] fit but you'll see that it's got the
[37:24] contrast of both sides
[37:27] here and in that there is a slipping
[37:31] away and a catching away taking place at
[37:33] the same time and I think you'll see
[37:34] that contrast in these scriptures right
[37:36] here
[37:38] for a good tree bringeth not forth
[37:41] corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt
[37:43] tree bring forth good fruit for every
[37:47] tree is known by his own fruit
[37:51] so we can't even say that our fruit is
[37:54] identified by the fact that we all go to
[37:56] Grace
[37:59] and that we all
[38:01] adhere to what we call the message
[38:05] see that's a problem that people
[38:06] sometimes you might say critics
[38:09] they have taken this brush
[38:11] and made a very broad swipe with the
[38:15] brush
[38:16] and everybody at that church
[38:18] is not nice
[38:23] an impossibility unless you have a
[38:26] really really messed up circumstance
[38:29] so we don't want to in life beyond this
[38:32] sermon tonight we want to be very
[38:34] careful about taking and painting things
[38:37] too broadly
[38:39] because we look this and now a good tree
[38:42] cannot bring forth corrupt fruit and
[38:44] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[38:46] good fruit for every tree is known by
[38:49] his own fruit
[38:51] for of thorns men do not gather figs nor
[38:54] of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes a
[38:59] good man out of the good Treasure of his
[39:02] heart bringeth forth that which is good
[39:05] and an evil man out of the evil Treasure
[39:07] of his heart bringeth forth that which
[39:10] is evil for the abundance of the heart
[39:13] his mouth speaketh
[39:16] so that identifies every individual
[39:20] directly because I don't care how
[39:23] domineering maybe a Ministry might be in
[39:25] a church
[39:26] he never can speak for every person
[39:29] there
[39:31] and I don't care for how loving
[39:33] people can be they cannot speak for
[39:36] everyone so it is of the abundance
[39:40] of the good man's heart
[39:43] don't you love that it just stirs me
[39:46] amen
[39:48] a good Treasure of heart bringeth forth
[39:50] that which is good evil man out of the
[39:52] evil Treasure of his heart bringeth
[39:54] forth that which is evil evil for of the
[39:57] abundance of the heart his mouth
[39:59] speaketh and why call me Lord Lord and
[40:04] do not the things which I say
[40:08] whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[40:10] sayings and doeth them I will show you
[40:14] to whom he is like
[40:17] now I want to take this for just a
[40:19] second
[40:21] let's jump back to verse 46 if we call
[40:24] him Lord
[40:26] I believe this scripture
[40:28] just my point of view
[40:30] if we call him Lord
[40:33] that implies that we should be obedient
[40:36] to what he said
[40:39] otherwise it becomes a lip service
[40:42] we're saying oh Lord but we don't really
[40:44] care we're not elevating as the song
[40:48] says uh uh putting him
[40:51] in preeminence that's what we want to do
[40:53] let him have the preeminence in our life
[40:57] that's important amen
[40:59] amen so they hear these sayings and they
[41:02] do with them I'll show you whom he is
[41:05] like
[41:06] he is like a man which built a house and
[41:09] dig deep
[41:11] now I'm gonna just hold you first
[41:13] standing for just a second we get
[41:15] through this now we'll come back and
[41:17] visit it here's like a man who built a
[41:19] house and dig deep and laid a foundation
[41:21] on a wrong and when the flood arose the
[41:24] stream beat vehemently against that
[41:27] house and could not shake it for it was
[41:29] founded upon a Rock Amen but he that
[41:32] heareth and doeth not as like a man that
[41:35] without a foundation built a house upon
[41:37] the Earth against which the stream did
[41:40] beat vehemently and immediately fell in
[41:43] the Rune of that house was great
[41:46] Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord as
[41:48] we look in your word tonight just bring
[41:50] it alive to us father let it not just be
[41:53] a time we came to church and we saw and
[41:56] we sang but father let it be something
[41:58] anchored deep in our souls Lord just
[42:01] help us father as we press into the
[42:04] circumstances of our days of our weeks
[42:06] months years whatever might be father
[42:09] that Lord we would truly be anchored
[42:12] father not in the ideas of this Earth
[42:14] but Lord in you father we thank you for
[42:18] this time to come together in the name
[42:20] of Jesus Christ amen
[42:22] you may be seated Saints now I want to
[42:25] go back on this and take this and and I
[42:29] just want to make some observations of
[42:31] this from the the level or realm of
[42:34] humanity
[42:36] the spirit of the age my brother and
[42:38] sister is slowly shifting and the Spirit
[42:41] uh if I could put it this way to you the
[42:45] spirit is changing the culture
[42:49] we oftentimes say the culture is
[42:52] changing the spirit but no it is the
[42:56] spirit
[42:57] the anointing that is on the earth is
[42:59] changing the culture of humanity and the
[43:02] spirit that is operating is being
[43:05] manifested in the culture so when we see
[43:08] a culture now that that does not line up
[43:11] with the word of God that tells you the
[43:13] spirit that has been anointing the
[43:15] culture and so in this we'll see now
[43:18] that is I want to just dissect this for
[43:21] a moment you see this man who is
[43:23] building his house uh that a man who
[43:27] obeys the word of God looks to the word
[43:29] of God makes that preeminent in his life
[43:31] you'll see that he digs deep
[43:34] and that my brother and sister is
[43:36] against the culture of the day that we
[43:39] live in I'm not going to speak to you
[43:40] judgmental tonight but I am going to
[43:43] dispute directly my brother and sister
[43:45] the place that it should start the
[43:49] scripture says judgment
[43:52] not self-confidence building not wealth
[43:55] building classes
[43:57] not a networking none of the things that
[44:00] seem to be being offered as a reason why
[44:03] in the day that we live in but judgment
[44:06] begins in the house of God but judgment
[44:09] does not actually have to be harsh the
[44:12] holy spirit moves upon you realize every
[44:14] time that God speaks to us now it
[44:16] corrects a little something in our life
[44:18] can can we relate to that and when God
[44:21] corrects something and that that is
[44:22] Judgment but it's not always a heavy
[44:25] hand many times I would say most of the
[44:28] time if we will heed what God is
[44:30] speaking it is a very loving hand
[44:33] and so it's showing us this is not the
[44:36] way to go come back to our doctrines our
[44:40] teachings our foundations yes and no
[44:44] if our doctrines teaching and
[44:46] Foundations are based in the Bible then
[44:48] absolutely a large yes but if it's just
[44:51] a culture the traditions of man the
[44:54] writing of man books that say we must if
[44:57] you're going to be a faithful whatever
[44:58] then you have to adhere to our doctrines
[45:03] I say Amen to that if the doctrine can
[45:06] fit in the framework of the Bible
[45:09] if it's outside of the framework of the
[45:12] Bible what obligation do we actually
[45:14] have my brother and sister to obey the
[45:17] dictates of the church if the church is
[45:19] not scriptural amen and so we see the
[45:23] foundation that's being laid here and
[45:25] the picture is that we being hearers and
[45:28] doers of the word are building a house
[45:31] and oftentimes that picture gets caught
[45:34] up it's it's a house you know it's out
[45:37] here it's on it's on the rock you know
[45:39] looking over the ocean I don't know
[45:42] um is that uh uh sister Jerry and I one
[45:45] time was up in Coeur d'Alene stayed in a
[45:47] a place and there is it's absolutely
[45:50] just stunningly gorgeous there what lake
[45:52] is it at Quarter Lane
[45:55] Ponderay I don't know
[45:58] Coeur D'alene Lake okay Coeur D'alene
[46:00] Lake ponderay's farther north right okay
[46:03] Coeur D'alene Lake when you get around
[46:05] on that backside it'd be the east side
[46:06] coming back around there there's a huge
[46:08] rock out in the lake and there's a house
[46:10] built on top of that now you notice no
[46:12] sandy beaches
[46:14] it wasn't a place made to you know go
[46:16] out and throw your your umbrella and
[46:18] whatever but I'm telling you my brother
[46:21] and sister they found something solid to
[46:23] build that thing on it's just a gorgeous
[46:25] place I've always remembered that when I
[46:27] tie it to this scripture right here in
[46:29] fact when we were there on that trip
[46:31] that time I sat there and read these
[46:33] scriptures because I thought there I
[46:35] believe would be a Perfectly Natural
[46:36] example we actually have a picture
[46:38] somewhere taken with a cheap camera from
[46:40] it seemed like three miles away so it's
[46:42] like that house that spot right there is
[46:45] built on a rock
[46:46] but you see we are here
[46:49] doing some building tonight
[46:51] we are here tonight building a house
[46:54] that is you might say the shelter
[46:58] for the Holy Ghost the shelter for the
[47:00] spirit of God a place that we want to as
[47:03] it would be as Sons and Daughters of God
[47:05] being spirit being in the presence of
[47:08] God right we don't come as carnal men or
[47:10] women into the presence of God we come
[47:12] as Spirit beings and and as we come into
[47:15] that realm right there God's saying you
[47:17] know what I I'd like you to build me a a
[47:20] place that I could fill up I don't want
[47:23] to just come and reside on the porch or
[47:25] have a little space in the entryway I
[47:28] want to fill this house I want I want to
[47:30] occupy every room and crack and crevice
[47:33] of this house and so because by God's
[47:36] grace in our life the revelation of the
[47:39] word coming to us we didn't go out and
[47:41] just scratch a little spot and the first
[47:43] tip of the rock that we hit
[47:46] my brother and sister many people are
[47:48] anointed by the spirit of Christ the
[47:50] Holy Ghost
[47:51] but it doesn't get any deeper than the
[47:53] flesh
[47:54] so this scripture is not referring to
[47:56] someone who went out and said I'm going
[47:58] to build a house here I'm digging ding
[48:01] okay we're done digging this is where
[48:03] we're building the house but they went
[48:05] into every crack and crevice and laid
[48:07] the blueprint down and they cleaned that
[48:10] off so that the whole house are you with
[48:13] me the whole house is built on the rock
[48:16] you see the scripture says A house
[48:19] divided
[48:20] is a house guaranteed to fall
[48:23] and so we can't put one half of the
[48:25] house on the rock leave the other house
[48:27] out on Sand it won't work
[48:29] as we've seen some of the video clip in
[48:32] the news and stuff of uh Yellowstone
[48:34] River you know and I think anybody that
[48:37] especially we I listen or look watch at
[48:39] the news on the internet and and um and
[48:42] you know you see that in somebody's
[48:44] beautiful house that at one time looked
[48:46] right down onto a beautiful River and
[48:48] must have been a lovely place but you
[48:50] see as the dirt is slowly eroding away
[48:52] eroding away those people must have
[48:55] recognized that everything they had in
[49:00] that house
[49:03] you know the authorities wouldn't let
[49:05] him back in
[49:07] you can't run in there and say I at
[49:09] least let me grab my family pictures
[49:12] at least let me grab my ten thousand
[49:14] dollars that was in the safe in the
[49:16] garage
[49:18] nothing it was all gone
[49:21] so when you look at this equation we
[49:24] start digging
[49:25] and we're preparing
[49:27] as the scripture says what house will
[49:29] you build me
[49:31] Lord I built one real quick for you
[49:34] no he wants one that lasts he wants one
[49:38] that endures every test of time
[49:41] and so we dig deep and now I want to if
[49:44] you'll just let me tonight move over
[49:47] into another realm here
[49:49] there is a time that we come into the
[49:52] trials of our life the circumstances
[49:54] that we seem overwhelmed and it seems
[49:58] like what we've been living and what
[49:59] we've been doing is just going to fall
[50:01] apart it's going to shambles but there's
[50:03] something that's been laid in the heart
[50:05] of Sons and Daughters of God it's a
[50:08] spirit amen coming down anointing the
[50:11] seed that was there and what do we do we
[50:15] don't give up we dig deep
[50:19] and when others say ow if the Lord
[50:22] really loved me he would have come on
[50:23] this scene and he would have changed
[50:25] this circumstance whether it be a loved
[50:27] one a friend or something personal
[50:30] financial whatever it might be in the
[50:32] family and people that say if God really
[50:34] cared he would have changed that but the
[50:37] real believer that's got a seed inside
[50:39] of him he gets his shovel back out and
[50:41] says I don't think that I'm anchored to
[50:43] the rock well enough Lord forgive me and
[50:46] we start digging and we dig deep because
[50:49] we know
[50:50] who we are in Christ
[50:52] we're not guessing it's not attached to
[50:55] the church and hoping the church is
[50:56] attached to Christ but we know who we
[50:59] are attached to and we dig deep and When
[51:03] Storms Shake us as a story of the oak
[51:05] tree and our roots are pulled and
[51:07] seemingly getting looser and swaying
[51:09] more but then when the storm ends The
[51:12] Roots have room to grow
[51:16] you see there's so much value in digging
[51:19] deep
[51:20] and I say even as we've announced the
[51:22] kid Grace kids in their youth group
[51:24] tonight
[51:26] there's Merit for us to put every bit of
[51:28] Labor
[51:30] that we can every bit of strength that
[51:32] we can to dig down a foundation for our
[51:36] children for our young people that they
[51:38] would come and will not be blown away by
[51:40] the things of this world my brother and
[51:43] sister I'm glad I'm a farmer
[51:46] I hardly ever go to town I hardly ever
[51:49] get a dose of Walmart
[51:52] I hardly ever get a dose of the grocery
[51:55] store
[51:56] but yet in a way it's not good
[52:00] because we're too sheltered sometimes
[52:03] and we don't really realize how good we
[52:06] have it
[52:07] God is good to us Saints
[52:10] God is so good to us
[52:12] we go to places not being judgmental but
[52:15] you can see that the impact of the
[52:19] spirit of this day is having upon people
[52:25] I just went today and got some parts for
[52:28] a truck
[52:30] saw a young man who was waiting on me
[52:35] and I don't know I don't say this
[52:37] judgmentally please believe me
[52:40] I say this in wonderment
[52:43] of why a man would get a tattoo
[52:46] on you might say his bicep reads and his
[52:48] arms were quite bigger than mine
[52:53] of a hideous demonic face
[52:59] why
[53:01] anointing
[53:03] Spirit of the age
[53:05] trying to set a foundation
[53:07] that when these people move forward in
[53:09] life the circumstances they face
[53:12] what way will they go
[53:15] they're being pre-anointed
[53:19] for the circumstance coming to them
[53:22] and have you ever noticed how
[53:24] I say this by God's grace have you ever
[53:27] noticed how you'll read your Bible
[53:30] you'll study a message you'll be
[53:32] listening you'll do
[53:34] and you'll be wow that's good that's
[53:36] good
[53:37] and this happens to me quite often
[53:40] maybe a day maybe not even a whole day
[53:42] but a little period of time and what you
[53:45] have read and heard
[53:47] is exactly what you needed
[53:50] a reminder
[53:53] pre-conditioning you
[53:55] to come to a place that when you face
[53:58] that trial you don't say oh I'm giving
[54:01] up you say no I've already been given
[54:04] the answer God has already come on the
[54:07] scene through his word and spoke to me
[54:10] and I'm able now to set it down and say
[54:13] let the storm blow
[54:16] I'm prepared I'm not blindsided I'm
[54:19] prepared
[54:21] and we look at this my brother and
[54:23] sister how
[54:24] that the man
[54:26] who chooses not to put the effort and I
[54:29] was going to say this and I don't want
[54:30] her to I don't want to paint everyone
[54:32] with the brush
[54:39] I do business with a lot of people
[54:42] and more and more
[54:45] no one want to put out
[54:47] any effort
[54:51] I want to serve God
[54:53] now don't misunderstand me because
[54:55] serving God shouldn't be something we
[54:56] have to as it were labor labor I'm going
[54:58] to force myself to do this so understand
[55:00] the context
[55:03] I'll serve God if I don't have to invest
[55:05] anything
[55:07] I'll serve God if all I got to do is you
[55:10] know burn and research even shows now
[55:12] that people are slowly it used to be
[55:15] people would drive going back in time
[55:17] people would drive up to 30 miles to go
[55:20] to church and it's shrinking now in
[55:22] bigger cities it's down to blocks
[55:30] why
[55:32] no longer an anointing
[55:35] to dig deep
[55:37] they want to have their ears tickled
[55:40] they want things convenient I don't know
[55:43] if you guys have seen it's kind of a pun
[55:45] against that stuff
[55:46] a couple going around interviewing
[55:48] churches
[55:50] and they've been to this church and you
[55:52] don't offer daycare I'm not going there
[55:54] and you don't have coffee and donuts
[55:56] they're not going to go to this one and
[55:59] then they finally come to the church and
[56:01] they're telling them our church has this
[56:03] and it does this and it does this and it
[56:05] does this
[56:06] and they said and we have um we have a
[56:10] service at 10 o'clock
[56:12] and they said stop
[56:15] you don't have a
[56:17] service later than 10. no we have church
[56:20] at 10.
[56:22] well we don't even get up
[56:24] on Sundays by 10.
[56:27] man and wife look at each other this one
[56:30] don't work either
[56:33] there's no desire
[56:35] sacrifice
[56:37] no desire to dig deeper no desire to say
[56:41] you know what I want to go I want to go
[56:43] to church where Christ is present I want
[56:46] to go to church with godly people and if
[56:48] I have to drive I'll drive if I have to
[56:51] get up early I get up early if this is
[56:53] the time church is I'll do that you see
[56:55] these things are fading away it's a
[56:57] world of convenience
[56:59] and you think that that's just happening
[57:01] I was just talking with a man the other
[57:03] day and he told me he says Paul he said
[57:07] I remember when a Circle K in our city
[57:10] was built
[57:12] and the shock wave that went through our
[57:14] city because it was going to be open on
[57:17] Sunday
[57:20] and he said it wasn't four or five
[57:22] months everything in their city was open
[57:24] on Sunday
[57:27] people want that
[57:29] they desire that
[57:31] and so we see that this man doesn't want
[57:33] to dig deep
[57:35] and so it's there that he just scratches
[57:38] out a foundation
[57:41] he doesn't really get down and ever say
[57:43] Lord what does this scripture mean never
[57:46] digs in and says Lord I want to
[57:49] understand your word even if I have to
[57:51] pray and I have to labor and I have to
[57:53] push into this I want to understand your
[57:55] word Lord you see that's done we're
[57:57] we're into the age that we never get
[58:00] deeper than the superficial
[58:03] of the word
[58:05] John 3 16 being one of the most famous
[58:08] and oft preached scriptures
[58:15] and they only scratch the surface
[58:18] never catching the depth of what's in
[58:21] the word
[58:25] for God so loved the world
[58:27] that he gave his only begotten son
[58:32] and never get to the depth of it
[58:34] to catch the Revelation that Christ knew
[58:37] us yes Christ knew us from the
[58:41] foundation of the world
[58:44] you see to know that we were always in
[58:46] Christ we weren't Johnny come lately
[58:48] people say I got saved last year no you
[58:50] just come and I think this is funny
[58:52] because the devil likes to imitate
[58:54] everything God's doing they just came to
[58:56] an Awakening
[58:59] everybody's getting woke my brother and
[59:01] sister the Bride of Jesus Christ has
[59:03] been woke for Generations
[59:06] they know who he is
[59:09] and they want to be exactly like him
[59:11] and the words matter
[59:14] oh get this a school teacher already in
[59:17] this school season that just started put
[59:20] on suspension for not using the right
[59:23] what what do you call that pronouns or
[59:25] whatever
[59:26] for a seven-year-old
[59:31] should have been the pronoun little girl
[59:34] it was a little girl
[59:37] just go to the office
[59:39] little girl
[59:42] and the little girl insisted to be
[59:44] identified with ridiculous terms
[59:47] it
[59:48] and I don't remember what the rest were
[59:51] a seven-year-old
[59:53] my brother and sister somebody had to
[59:55] facilitate
[59:57] not child somebody that's Anointed with
[59:59] a spirit
[1:00:00] facilitated that child
[1:00:04] so as we look at this I don't get
[1:00:06] sidetracked here in fact I better shift
[1:00:08] into another gear
[1:00:09] you look at this and realize what is
[1:00:11] happening we're seeing because things
[1:00:13] were built on a shallow Foundation it's
[1:00:16] starting to crumble and it says that the
[1:00:18] fall of the house was uh after being
[1:00:21] beaten vehemently that's the spirit of
[1:00:23] the age my brother and sister and being
[1:00:25] immediately it fell in the Rune of the
[1:00:28] house was great but I don't want to
[1:00:30] circumvent scripture so don't
[1:00:31] misunderstand me but you see the fall of
[1:00:34] something doesn't mean that one day it's
[1:00:36] standing and we're talking in the
[1:00:38] context of Salvation or people serving
[1:00:40] God it's not a fall that one day it's
[1:00:42] standing and then it just falls down but
[1:00:45] my brother and sister Satan has a way of
[1:00:47] undermining and people will go and you
[1:00:51] know I talk to a man sorry to put this
[1:00:53] in a personal basis but I talked to a
[1:00:55] man that quit being a Christian if I
[1:00:57] mentioned his name many of you would
[1:00:58] know him and and I I I said what went
[1:01:01] wrong and he said I'll tell you what
[1:01:04] went wrong I quit reading my Bible and
[1:01:06] praying years ago
[1:01:08] scripturally
[1:01:11] it fell immediately
[1:01:14] and the destruction of it was great
[1:01:17] but the actual manifestation of that
[1:01:19] took time
[1:01:21] and because he knew my brother and
[1:01:23] sister this is the part I want to drive
[1:01:24] home we'll move on he knew that when he
[1:01:27] quit praying and he quit reading his
[1:01:29] Bible he knew that that was going to be
[1:01:31] a detrimental effect
[1:01:33] but he was anointed
[1:01:35] didn't have enough time in his life had
[1:01:37] more important things to do and oh Lord
[1:01:39] help us to place values where the values
[1:01:42] should be placed and one of those values
[1:01:44] is digging deep enough to be anchored to
[1:01:46] the Rock Amen
[1:01:48] now look as we look at this
[1:01:52] I want to I want to just bring Hebrews
[1:01:54] 11 and then I'm going to kick it in high
[1:01:56] gear here and really get going Hebrews
[1:01:58] 11 24 by faith Moses when he come to
[1:02:01] years come of age refused to be called
[1:02:04] the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:02:06] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[1:02:08] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:02:11] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[1:02:14] the reproach of Christ's greater riches
[1:02:17] than the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:02:19] respect into the recompense of the
[1:02:22] reward and so he's looking there my
[1:02:25] brother and sister and he had placed
[1:02:27] such great value on the reward that all
[1:02:31] of the the
[1:02:32] um uh instantaneous all of the things
[1:02:35] that instant gratification uh had no
[1:02:39] value compared to the position of the
[1:02:43] promise of of uh
[1:02:46] of serving God being part of the body of
[1:02:48] Christ and so he rather chose to be with
[1:02:52] God's people you know one of the
[1:02:54] greatest things that the devil I've been
[1:02:56] there as a young as a Young Man uh just
[1:02:59] an experience we had the other night uh
[1:03:02] I won't go into detail but uh you know
[1:03:05] God allowed me to recount my youth to an
[1:03:08] individual
[1:03:10] because this this young man was in a
[1:03:12] position
[1:03:13] he needed to hear he wasn't the only one
[1:03:16] that fell down on his face at a time in
[1:03:18] his life raised in church fell down
[1:03:22] and struggling suffering to to write
[1:03:25] himself as it were in the day that we're
[1:03:27] living and I actually had to say Thank
[1:03:29] You Lord that I got to experience that
[1:03:32] kind of a thing in my own life that I
[1:03:34] could speak to him in sincerity and say
[1:03:37] you have just as much hope today as any
[1:03:39] man on the face of the Earth you have
[1:03:41] just as much right to the word of God to
[1:03:44] the throne of God as anyone on the face
[1:03:46] of the Earth
[1:03:49] to sit there
[1:03:51] now you all know what it is
[1:03:54] Hunters fishermen hard-working
[1:03:58] brother Jason calls him knuckle draggers
[1:04:02] it's hard for a man like that to cry
[1:04:05] and yet the power of God moved upon him
[1:04:07] so strongly
[1:04:09] he longed if you'll follow me he longed
[1:04:12] to go back
[1:04:14] and dig
[1:04:16] deeper
[1:04:19] but the devil's telling him he can't
[1:04:21] it's too late
[1:04:26] but there was some of us brothers
[1:04:27] sitting there with him including your
[1:04:30] dad
[1:04:32] and we got to remind him and encourage
[1:04:34] him it's not too late
[1:04:36] to dig that old shovel
[1:04:38] and start digging down into the word of
[1:04:41] God
[1:04:42] now look at this my brother and sister
[1:04:43] I'm going to get a little direct and I'm
[1:04:45] going to be reading quite a bit here so
[1:04:46] I hope you don't mind but you see my
[1:04:49] brother and sister we have to reject the
[1:04:52] immediate gratification of laodicea to
[1:04:54] take a halt of the promise see Satan
[1:04:58] tries to make it look like it's
[1:04:59] unattainable and that you need to just
[1:05:01] be able to take what you can take right
[1:05:03] now right amen this little phrase has
[1:05:06] been around for years uh we want what we
[1:05:09] want when we want it
[1:05:12] and that's how car salesmen work
[1:05:15] people walk on the lot
[1:05:17] they want what they want when they want
[1:05:19] it
[1:05:19] and they can't walk away
[1:05:22] they give them oh here's a car in your
[1:05:24] budget doesn't come with a stereo
[1:05:25] doesn't even come with a back bumper
[1:05:30] well I want a car with a stereo and one
[1:05:32] with a back bumper okay let's move you
[1:05:34] to this one it just has vinyl seats but
[1:05:36] it has a stereo although just AM FM and
[1:05:40] it does have this cheap bumper
[1:05:42] well no my friends all Drive nicer Rigs
[1:05:45] and they move them if you've ever been
[1:05:47] around a car salesman you know I'm
[1:05:48] talking from experience and now
[1:05:51] fortunately we escaped but anyway they
[1:05:53] just keep moving you along you come in
[1:05:55] here to buy a car that's got a 200
[1:05:57] payment and you leave with a car with a
[1:05:59] 400 payment
[1:06:01] why because they just lead those dear
[1:06:03] children alone
[1:06:05] because they want what they want when
[1:06:07] they want it
[1:06:09] and so that power is so great
[1:06:13] well if you'd like to know depending on
[1:06:15] who you check with repossessions on cars
[1:06:17] are up 17 percent already
[1:06:21] I just watched one being repossessed the
[1:06:23] other day
[1:06:25] yeah
[1:06:27] my brother and sister that's how it
[1:06:29] works because they wanted what they
[1:06:31] wanted
[1:06:32] but they never dug down deep enough
[1:06:35] to be able to accept what God wanted
[1:06:38] them to have
[1:06:40] and you say what's God got to do with
[1:06:42] cars the scripture teaches us to be good
[1:06:45] stewards and count the cost First
[1:06:47] so everything really in life comes right
[1:06:50] back to that now look at this
[1:06:52] Satan's plan you see is tying us tying
[1:06:56] people to immediate gratification
[1:06:58] now I don't want to get Christ tonight
[1:07:00] we have young people here but you can
[1:07:01] just run your minds right over that and
[1:07:04] you can know where I'm saying and you
[1:07:07] see this my brother and sister that
[1:07:08] people are just caught up in this and so
[1:07:11] this is so pervasive
[1:07:14] it even comes down and affects our
[1:07:16] prayer life
[1:07:19] let's be honest tonight are we honest
[1:07:21] people
[1:07:23] we're Christians right we're honest
[1:07:25] how many of us have prayed
[1:07:28] Lord I need you to do this and I need
[1:07:31] you to do this and I need you to do this
[1:07:34] and
[1:07:36] 8 A.M would work
[1:07:40] that Spirits he has come into our life
[1:07:44] and we want God to pave our way in front
[1:07:46] of us
[1:07:47] because the scripture promised to even
[1:07:49] make the way smooth before us and so our
[1:07:51] idea of smooth
[1:07:52] is that life would just be
[1:07:55] and we do what we shouldn't do because
[1:07:58] we never count the cost
[1:08:00] and we'll see this my brother and sister
[1:08:02] affecting in many many things it can be
[1:08:05] in the way we raise our children
[1:08:09] um
[1:08:10] hope we have no conscientious objectors
[1:08:13] tonight
[1:08:16] the scripture never said ground your
[1:08:18] children the scripture never said do all
[1:08:21] this to your children but neither did it
[1:08:23] say beat them
[1:08:26] and I'm not advocating you know people
[1:08:28] boast of the stick they used or the
[1:08:30] whatever that was there I'm not boasting
[1:08:32] of that but there has to be a form of
[1:08:34] Correction
[1:08:36] taking a child's phone away from them
[1:08:38] for 15 minutes is not correction
[1:08:42] but that's what we've come to in the
[1:08:44] world
[1:08:45] I've watched children
[1:08:48] be grounded from Electronics
[1:08:51] and look over 10 minutes later and the
[1:08:53] child has electronics and you know why
[1:08:56] because the parent didn't want to be
[1:08:58] bothered
[1:08:59] and so they gave the electronics back to
[1:09:01] the child
[1:09:04] you know kind of like a binky to a baby
[1:09:07] right don't want to hear them sniffling
[1:09:09] and crying so we give them the binky
[1:09:12] and then we wonder why they're five
[1:09:14] years old still packing a binky
[1:09:16] because we've gave it back to them and
[1:09:18] we've never weaned them
[1:09:20] you realize God wants to wean us
[1:09:22] he wants us to wean us from this flash
[1:09:25] that wants it like we want it he wants
[1:09:28] us to wean us to a place that we're
[1:09:30] willing to get down on our face and say
[1:09:33] Lord thy will not my will be done
[1:09:37] and there's times in our life and
[1:09:39] circumstances of our life that that is a
[1:09:42] very hard thing to do because we've
[1:09:45] become so accustomed
[1:09:47] and we just expect God to do this the
[1:09:51] way we want
[1:09:52] now you know what the Lord gives us
[1:09:55] unique opportunities in life and I just
[1:09:59] want to share this with you going to
[1:10:01] read out of this here he said in The
[1:10:03] Courier said now this is just in a
[1:10:05] context of a story and The Courier said
[1:10:08] speaking back into to to Jesus and the
[1:10:11] Courier said sir I'm sent to tell you
[1:10:12] that my master has honored you with an
[1:10:15] invitation he's going to have a feast a
[1:10:17] great banquet is going to be given he
[1:10:20] does it annually and he wants you to
[1:10:22] attend this feast
[1:10:24] look at this
[1:10:27] how could he say such a thing
[1:10:29] how could he standing in the presence of
[1:10:32] Christ for his first time and then to
[1:10:35] carry on some kind of business about his
[1:10:38] self-style religion oh I wished I could
[1:10:40] have stood there first thing I would
[1:10:42] have done would have been following my
[1:10:44] face before him and asked forgiveness of
[1:10:46] my sins but that's just about the trend
[1:10:49] of the day when people come face to face
[1:10:51] with him they got other things they got
[1:10:53] to talk about instead of about our
[1:10:56] sinful condition
[1:10:59] amen that's right
[1:11:01] let me just interject this before I go
[1:11:04] on
[1:11:07] this is not a my ideal
[1:11:10] it's a different minister
[1:11:13] he said this whole fat of what would
[1:11:15] Jesus do
[1:11:18] he said we
[1:11:19] would have just went
[1:11:21] and conversed with them
[1:11:24] and he plated a rope
[1:11:27] and chase them out of the temple off the
[1:11:30] porch
[1:11:32] when they talked about we caught a woman
[1:11:34] in the very Act of adultery
[1:11:36] we would have said she deserves it
[1:11:40] Jesus
[1:11:42] wrote something I think we almost all
[1:11:44] would have a curiosity of what that was
[1:11:48] maybe a time maybe a date maybe a name
[1:11:54] and then when she says
[1:11:57] I have no accusers he says neither do I
[1:12:00] go in sin no more
[1:12:03] are we really my brother and sister at a
[1:12:06] place we want to do and say what Jesus
[1:12:08] did and said
[1:12:10] I think as real Christians God's
[1:12:11] bringing us to the place that the only
[1:12:13] thing that matters but I want to just be
[1:12:15] real Frank with you tonight there's
[1:12:17] times and circumstances in our lives
[1:12:19] that we would struggle
[1:12:21] to do what Jesus would say and do
[1:12:25] it brings us to a stark reality because
[1:12:28] we're looking my brother and sister as
[1:12:30] my title would say tonight we're looking
[1:12:32] my brother a time of either slipping
[1:12:34] away or being caught away catching away
[1:12:37] there's a time that it has to be all of
[1:12:40] the word of God or it may as well be
[1:12:43] none of the word of God men come to him
[1:12:46] and said hey um you know we're Mighty
[1:12:49] Men as it were and we've done many
[1:12:50] mighty works in your name and Jesus
[1:12:53] didn't sit down and say hey just enjoy
[1:12:55] the banquet because you've done these
[1:12:57] Mighty Works in my name he said depart
[1:12:59] from me because you were workers of
[1:13:02] iniquity because you see he never took
[1:13:04] they never took the people to The Rock
[1:13:08] right the rock is Christ so he they
[1:13:10] never took uh the people to the Rock
[1:13:13] they took them to religion
[1:13:17] oh Saints you think why was brother Paul
[1:13:19] preaching this
[1:13:20] because the tentacles
[1:13:22] grow every day
[1:13:25] the tentacles are slipping in
[1:13:29] we need a reminder once in a while
[1:13:37] and that man I can imagine seeing her
[1:13:39] master watch the fellow with pity
[1:13:43] perhaps that he was passing the greatest
[1:13:45] opportunity that ever lay before any
[1:13:47] human being was to stand in the presence
[1:13:49] of Jesus Christ there he was
[1:13:52] but you see he'd come in God had come in
[1:13:54] the form of a man and he didn't know it
[1:13:56] and there he stood and Jesus with all of
[1:13:59] his busy schedule with thousands of
[1:14:01] places to go and all he had to do and I
[1:14:04] can see him in politeness and gentlemen
[1:14:06] like nodding his said head said tell
[1:14:09] your master I'll be there
[1:14:12] what do we learn here
[1:14:16] that he always comes where he's invited
[1:14:18] can we say Amen I have never seen God
[1:14:22] fail to come on this scene when we got
[1:14:24] down in a serious form not in sincerity
[1:14:28] not flipping not just spur of the moment
[1:14:30] but something that we would come and say
[1:14:32] Lord I need you to come I need you to
[1:14:35] come on this scene I need you to walk
[1:14:37] with me today
[1:14:38] he's always there people say but I don't
[1:14:42] know no trust me if he wasn't there with
[1:14:44] you brother and sister the world would
[1:14:47] have fallen apart around you but he's
[1:14:49] there and while we think there's still
[1:14:51] chaos in the world do you realize we're
[1:14:54] walking in the very presence of God as
[1:14:57] they say about that uh the the hurricane
[1:14:59] and whatever and and the tornado that
[1:15:03] there's an eye in the storm imagine my
[1:15:05] brother and sister oh I know some of you
[1:15:08] have faced great things in your life
[1:15:10] great challenges to your faith but I
[1:15:12] want to tell you God has kept us in the
[1:15:15] eye of the storm the world around us is
[1:15:18] nothing but chaos trying to destroy us
[1:15:21] and Satan's trying to navigate that to
[1:15:24] destroy you and God says I'll keep you
[1:15:26] in this eye of the storm because you're
[1:15:28] the apple of my eye I will keep you in
[1:15:31] that position and I will
[1:15:35] provide amen
[1:15:39] I will be your provider
[1:15:43] you don't need to look to the world out
[1:15:45] here
[1:15:46] to provide
[1:15:50] oh my
[1:15:55] tell him on such and such a day I'll be
[1:15:57] present on that day because he has
[1:16:00] invited me I will be there
[1:16:02] now and then after that The Courier must
[1:16:04] have turned his back and walked away and
[1:16:05] breathed a breath of satisfaction that
[1:16:08] he'd done something great what he had
[1:16:10] done he'd let slip away from him the
[1:16:13] greatest thing in all the world the
[1:16:15] opportunity to fall at the feet of Jesus
[1:16:19] now look where this goes I wonder if
[1:16:22] many of us don't do that
[1:16:24] maybe we've done it this week we might
[1:16:27] do it tonight turn your back on the
[1:16:30] opportunity to be saved to have eternal
[1:16:32] life then turn away from it some people
[1:16:35] sometimes come sick
[1:16:37] get healed then walk away
[1:16:40] thinking that they have achieved exactly
[1:16:42] the main thing that they came for
[1:16:47] people come for miracles
[1:16:50] I want to say this very guarded
[1:16:53] we have experienced that in this church
[1:16:56] just recently
[1:17:01] thankful for the supernatural
[1:17:04] to touch a son
[1:17:07] and deliver
[1:17:08] from an evil spirit
[1:17:12] but then it all comes down to
[1:17:16] what do you believe
[1:17:18] oh I don't know about that
[1:17:22] I say that kindly because I've not given
[1:17:25] up
[1:17:26] but you see my brother and sister if we
[1:17:28] just come for the Miracles there'll be a
[1:17:30] way that God lets the Miracles cease
[1:17:33] if we just come for the fellowship
[1:17:35] there'll be a day that the fellowship
[1:17:37] will cease if we come for any other
[1:17:39] reason than to fall at the feet of Jesus
[1:17:42] God will take this you say how do you
[1:17:44] know that these things will go away
[1:17:46] because I believe I'm talking to Sons
[1:17:48] and Daughters of God and God will
[1:17:50] purposely remove these things from our
[1:17:52] life to cause us to have to go into a
[1:17:54] state of desperation
[1:17:57] um people say but my God's a loving God
[1:17:59] that's right he loves you enough to keep
[1:18:01] you out of hell
[1:18:02] amen that's a greater love than there is
[1:18:04] any kind of love any human can ever
[1:18:06] comprehend
[1:18:07] amen I'm not too offensive tonight am I
[1:18:10] amen I I wonder maybe we've done it this
[1:18:13] week we might do it tonight turn your
[1:18:15] back on the opportunity
[1:18:17] amen
[1:18:18] see
[1:18:20] sometimes people
[1:18:22] not everyone comes to church with the
[1:18:24] same motive
[1:18:27] not everyone has the same agenda
[1:18:30] think about agenda study agenda
[1:18:33] oh my brother and sister agenda steep
[1:18:36] if you aren't if y'all ain't careful
[1:18:38] you're going to fall into my agenda
[1:18:41] let me just scare you a little bit if
[1:18:43] you aren't careful you'll fall into my
[1:18:44] agenda because with everything that's
[1:18:46] within me I want to see you on the other
[1:18:49] side and standing Before the Throne of
[1:18:51] almighty God I want to see you standing
[1:18:54] there worshiping the Lord and not to
[1:18:56] look over and say praise the Lord I was
[1:18:58] there Pastor I led them to the Lord or I
[1:19:00] this or I that but to be able just to
[1:19:02] stand and base in his presence and look
[1:19:05] and say these were the ones that God
[1:19:07] called me to walk with and live with and
[1:19:09] and be around and and we made it
[1:19:13] Hallelujah but not all agendas are the
[1:19:16] same not all motives are the same the
[1:19:19] best thing to come is for to find him as
[1:19:22] your savior is to know him
[1:19:24] who he is in your life
[1:19:26] have the Assurance right that Assurance
[1:19:28] come from digging deep
[1:19:31] people today are like people gone by
[1:19:33] years ago they tried to dodge the issue
[1:19:37] it's it's like the Loaves and Fishes he
[1:19:40] was a great prophet as long as he healed
[1:19:42] the sick and performed Miracles but when
[1:19:43] he began to tell him the truth they
[1:19:45] began to turn away from him he wasn't
[1:19:47] popular no more then
[1:19:49] now we find that this Courier turned his
[1:19:52] back upon the Lord Jesus as far as the
[1:19:54] scriptures doesn't give that he ever
[1:19:55] asks pardoning of his sins or anything
[1:19:57] and walked away back down to his master
[1:20:00] the Pharisee
[1:20:04] you see my brother and sister sometimes
[1:20:05] we get so caught up
[1:20:08] and what we think
[1:20:10] will be God's way
[1:20:12] for our life
[1:20:15] and we hold on to our plan
[1:20:20] remember the story about
[1:20:22] the man in the bar
[1:20:24] his buddies
[1:20:25] and they were saying there was no
[1:20:27] Christian women there was no Christians
[1:20:28] and the man says no my wife's a real
[1:20:30] Christian
[1:20:31] no there's not it's a sham
[1:20:35] goes there you know the story
[1:20:38] he demands that she fixed some food and
[1:20:40] she fixes it and she throws he throws it
[1:20:43] on the floor
[1:20:45] man I'll tell you what you could hear
[1:20:47] the McCullough fire up in the kitchen
[1:20:50] come raging out there and attack them no
[1:20:54] should come right out there in the
[1:20:55] meekness of the Holy Spirit and cleaned
[1:20:58] it up
[1:20:59] and them three men wept
[1:21:02] because they had actually experienced
[1:21:05] the impact of a real Christian oh Lord I
[1:21:09] want to have that kind of impact I don't
[1:21:11] want to just be a mouth that talks about
[1:21:13] being a Christian I want to have a life
[1:21:15] that is so impactful that people would
[1:21:17] say whatever it is I may not even agree
[1:21:20] with him but it's true there's something
[1:21:22] happens there
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:26] now there's something wrong with this
[1:21:27] story there it just doesn't make ends
[1:21:29] meet there's something wrong those
[1:21:31] Pharisees had no fellowship with Jesus
[1:21:33] they were at odds at one another and
[1:21:35] Jesus had no fellowship with him he told
[1:21:37] them uh you can pass seas and make one
[1:21:40] proselyte and then he's twofold more a
[1:21:43] child of Hell than he was before you
[1:21:45] blind leaders of the blind he said why
[1:21:47] did Isaiah speak to you you got eyes and
[1:21:50] can't see ears and can't hear how he
[1:21:52] rebuked them and balled them out and
[1:21:54] then one of them invited him to dinner
[1:21:59] isn't that kind of different
[1:22:02] somebody tried to undermine you
[1:22:06] but hey
[1:22:07] we have him for dinner we'll be able to
[1:22:09] tell everybody what we've done
[1:22:13] put it in the street expression we know
[1:22:15] there's a trump up the sleeve somewhere
[1:22:17] extra somewhere he's holding something
[1:22:19] because they had no fellowship with one
[1:22:22] another
[1:22:23] amen so I want to just move on here real
[1:22:27] quick as we look at this
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:33] here again modern events
[1:22:36] let's go forward here
[1:22:39] there we go
[1:22:42] are we okay tonight Saints
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:47] said my son called me over there today
[1:22:48] looked at television supposed to be a
[1:22:50] singing Bee where people come
[1:22:52] a bunch of little rickies we understand
[1:22:55] the terms especially from my day you
[1:22:57] would understand that term standing
[1:22:58] there shaking around like this rock and
[1:23:00] roll and singing them hymns it's a
[1:23:03] disgrace to Jesus Christ there's no more
[1:23:06] help me
[1:23:08] yes I said that word 50 times so I could
[1:23:12] stand here in front of you and say it
[1:23:14] correct and I just fell down on my face
[1:23:18] they're no longer solemn in church at
[1:23:20] all
[1:23:22] it seems like it's all become a rock and
[1:23:24] roll something in a fashion show instead
[1:23:27] of the Church of the Living God where
[1:23:28] Jesus Christ can manifest himself in
[1:23:30] power seems to me there's something
[1:23:32] wrong somewhere they're slipping away
[1:23:37] now I'm not preaching I want you to get
[1:23:39] this tonight let me set one thing
[1:23:40] straight maybe I should have started I'm
[1:23:42] not preaching to any people out there
[1:23:45] right I'm preaching to us inside these
[1:23:48] walls right here
[1:23:50] we're not out to say these people are
[1:23:52] all bad I don't I absolutely do not mean
[1:23:54] it that way
[1:23:56] but this is like a wake-up call for us
[1:23:58] to realize how easy things can creep in
[1:24:02] and my brother and sister it just slips
[1:24:04] in and then it comes down as it is here
[1:24:08] see there's something wrong they're
[1:24:10] slipping away
[1:24:11] amen the church slipping away we we
[1:24:14] start to lower our standard we don't
[1:24:17] want to offend anybody and this isn't
[1:24:19] that bad and whatever what we want to do
[1:24:22] is find that position where the holy
[1:24:24] spirit says I'm comfortable I want to be
[1:24:28] inside the walls of this church I want
[1:24:31] to be in your natural house I want to be
[1:24:33] in you
[1:24:36] but you see we can't look like the world
[1:24:39] act like the world live like the world
[1:24:41] and expect God to be pleased
[1:24:43] and I'm telling you what my brother and
[1:24:45] sister you don't have to go very far to
[1:24:47] go on something like you too
[1:24:50] and see people that are in the news over
[1:24:52] here for committing adultery and and uh
[1:24:55] uh breaking their marriage vow and then
[1:24:58] they're over here
[1:25:00] singing gospel songs
[1:25:04] oh I know that sounds harsh
[1:25:07] but is God going to bless someone
[1:25:10] who has just
[1:25:12] disregarded blatantly laid down ignored
[1:25:16] and walked all over the word
[1:25:19] and they say we're so blessed
[1:25:23] no let's not fool ourselves Saints
[1:25:25] God does have requirements amen
[1:25:29] amen oh no this is not a Works gospel
[1:25:31] we're not going to work our way to
[1:25:33] heaven
[1:25:34] but did the Ten Commandments ever get
[1:25:37] null and void
[1:25:39] no
[1:25:40] The Ten Commandments have never went
[1:25:42] null and void
[1:25:47] seems to me there's something wrong
[1:25:48] someone there slipping away and the
[1:25:49] Bible said it would be that way see look
[1:25:52] where you're at be careful
[1:25:54] wake up before it's too late if I could
[1:25:57] I we would make this look where you're
[1:25:59] at I'll have it highlighted in my iPad
[1:26:01] look where you're at
[1:26:03] God help us tonight Saints not a
[1:26:06] judgmental thing but just to stop
[1:26:09] little things creep in her life I'll
[1:26:12] raise my hand and just admit little
[1:26:14] things creep in and we start to just
[1:26:16] that's kind of normal
[1:26:19] kind of normal
[1:26:22] but it's not
[1:26:25] what does God do I say thank you tonight
[1:26:27] in all sincerity thank you Lord that he
[1:26:31] comes down and opens our eyes and says
[1:26:34] look where you're going
[1:26:36] you're no longer on the road you're
[1:26:37] driving down the grass on the side and
[1:26:40] the next step is a ditch
[1:26:42] but he says I love you
[1:26:45] and he draws us back
[1:26:47] into that straight and narrow way
[1:26:57] I put it this way in my notes
[1:27:00] I've been pondering this thought for a
[1:27:02] bit
[1:27:04] what happens it becomes common sounds
[1:27:09] common things
[1:27:11] in fact
[1:27:13] laodicea this age seventh Church age
[1:27:18] they're in Revelations 3
[1:27:21] has become entirely
[1:27:23] too common
[1:27:27] the age we're living in has come
[1:27:29] entirely
[1:27:31] too common
[1:27:34] you know when I was a young man young
[1:27:36] people listened to me because the devil
[1:27:39] will do this to you if you can when I
[1:27:41] was a young man
[1:27:46] I had all kinds of desire to serve God
[1:27:50] and I had all kinds of music hid under
[1:27:53] the seat of my pickup
[1:27:56] and the music under the seat of my
[1:27:58] pickup and serving God were not on a
[1:28:00] parallel track
[1:28:02] but it becomes so common to me
[1:28:05] I could hear what the pastor the
[1:28:07] preacher said
[1:28:09] and go out
[1:28:11] and before I made it home
[1:28:13] be listening to that music
[1:28:17] and that in itself became a common thing
[1:28:21] and at first I thought that's not right
[1:28:23] but I overrode it long enough it was no
[1:28:27] longer even a voice
[1:28:29] saying I'm sorry
[1:28:31] this music here does is not compatible
[1:28:35] with being a Christian so we can become
[1:28:37] common to these things and it can become
[1:28:40] such a a powerful influence in our life
[1:28:42] because as something gets more common
[1:28:47] the more comfortable
[1:28:50] we become
[1:28:52] and we can become so comfortable with
[1:28:54] things
[1:28:55] that just a rudimentary look in the word
[1:28:57] of God would show us
[1:28:59] it's sin
[1:29:00] and where the spirit of it come from but
[1:29:02] we're comfortable
[1:29:04] you know I say this in a bit of humor
[1:29:06] because I'm not pointing the finger at
[1:29:08] you and pointing at me I sometimes
[1:29:10] struggle
[1:29:11] I walk into a store and the music in the
[1:29:14] background is something from my
[1:29:15] childhood
[1:29:16] and I buy what I'm going to buy and I
[1:29:18] get in the pickup and I'm driving down
[1:29:20] the road headed back maybe to the house
[1:29:22] of the farm and I find myself
[1:29:25] no no no no no and I'm like
[1:29:31] no sorry I first took all that
[1:29:34] I ain't got any Chevies to leave on the
[1:29:36] Levee
[1:29:37] you know very common popular thing in my
[1:29:41] day but you see how strong Satan is that
[1:29:44] he just gives a little bit of that and
[1:29:46] it embeds there and we go and if we're
[1:29:49] not careful what we got to do is we got
[1:29:51] to stop as it were and we've got to shed
[1:29:53] that
[1:29:54] we got to make a conscious effort to
[1:29:56] shed that and say Lord forgive me you
[1:29:58] say but I didn't do anything wrong it
[1:30:00] doesn't matter that spirit's right there
[1:30:01] put that out Lord forgive me I don't
[1:30:04] that's not my music that's not who I am
[1:30:06] I want to sing Amazing Grace is what I
[1:30:08] want to be singing I don't want to be
[1:30:10] singing that amen so look what's
[1:30:12] happening the Bible itself and we
[1:30:14] recognize that right that the Bible
[1:30:16] itself said there'll be a slipping away
[1:30:17] a falling away in this last time right
[1:30:20] so as we look at this I just want to go
[1:30:23] ahead and lay a couple more uh things
[1:30:25] out to you so these these common things
[1:30:28] these common sounds become so common
[1:30:30] they're actually rocking a world to
[1:30:33] sleep
[1:30:34] you know how some my wife I'll throw her
[1:30:37] under the bus I'm trying to cure that
[1:30:38] but she did something terrible to me
[1:30:40] many many years ago and that was she
[1:30:42] introduced a sound machine into our
[1:30:44] bedroom
[1:30:44] and I used to say I can't go to sleep
[1:30:46] because your thing is making noise now I
[1:30:49] can't go to sleep unless the thing is
[1:30:52] making noise
[1:30:54] so you see it become common that when
[1:30:57] it's shut off
[1:30:59] I hear a car go slowly down the road
[1:31:04] and I must get up and see what they're
[1:31:07] doing
[1:31:08] only by the time I get up the car going
[1:31:10] so slowly is nowhere in sight
[1:31:17] but I don't hear that car
[1:31:19] if we have our precious little sound
[1:31:21] machine
[1:31:23] and it's become so common to us we can't
[1:31:25] live without it
[1:31:27] are you with me
[1:31:29] Satan is trying to make things
[1:31:33] so
[1:31:34] common to us we don't think we can live
[1:31:38] without hey you know this good preaching
[1:31:40] sami's saying amen
[1:31:43] yeah bless you Sammy
[1:31:46] yeah
[1:31:48] so look at this my brother and sister
[1:31:50] I just this is the reason tonight you
[1:31:52] probably think brother Paul must have
[1:31:54] taken some kind of sedative because he's
[1:31:55] just like in first gear creeping along
[1:31:58] but I want to drive this home
[1:32:01] how Satan so cleverly has made it to
[1:32:05] where now the things that are not the
[1:32:08] attributes of a Christian
[1:32:11] and it's crept in where we feel like I
[1:32:14] can't live without this
[1:32:17] it's the way of the world
[1:32:19] being rocked to sleep
[1:32:22] that's what the devil's doing
[1:32:24] remember now I'm going to throw this in
[1:32:26] and we'll just we'll just call it quits
[1:32:28] here because I'm so far from a Finish
[1:32:30] Line tonight we would never make it
[1:32:32] there
[1:32:37] what's the scripture say about the wise
[1:32:38] and foolish virgin
[1:32:43] they slumbered
[1:32:45] and slept
[1:32:50] or we could get real Technical and say
[1:32:52] now now the bride she can't know the
[1:32:55] scripture said
[1:32:56] they all did
[1:33:00] the difference that's going to matter
[1:33:03] is how deep
[1:33:05] you dug that Foundation
[1:33:08] do we have oil
[1:33:10] have we made our preparation have we
[1:33:12] done what we know we should have done
[1:33:14] have we set our life in order
[1:33:17] have we done all we can do because
[1:33:20] spiritual Slumber and sleep my brother
[1:33:22] and sister
[1:33:23] is something that the spirit scripture
[1:33:25] says that if he didn't cut the time
[1:33:27] short
[1:33:28] that All Flesh would be lost
[1:33:31] yeah no flesh saved
[1:33:35] so what are we looking at
[1:33:36] our time to set it in order is now
[1:33:41] in our life here today
[1:33:43] laodicea now remember slumbering and
[1:33:45] sleeping in the context of scripture is
[1:33:47] you did not lose your salvation
[1:33:50] you did not lose your position or your
[1:33:52] uh reward with Christ
[1:33:55] that didn't go away
[1:33:57] because you see in that Parable they
[1:33:59] were able to stand up and get their lamp
[1:34:01] trimmed and clear
[1:34:03] they had a little homework to do before
[1:34:05] the bridegroom come but they had
[1:34:07] everything in order
[1:34:09] oh Lord
[1:34:11] don't let us be frantically looking for
[1:34:13] a shovel to dig down to the Rock and
[1:34:16] have a relationship with him then
[1:34:18] let's have our relationship
[1:34:21] anchored right now now I've got a couple
[1:34:24] more things I want to allude to you as
[1:34:26] it were to bring out amen if you mind I
[1:34:31] want to share this one last thought
[1:34:33] right here
[1:34:34] I'm not even getting to the good stuff
[1:34:36] yeah you know how it is we're just like
[1:34:40] you know I think I remember the one of
[1:34:42] the last times Brother David preached he
[1:34:44] just preached and preached and preached
[1:34:45] and preached and he said wow I got a
[1:34:46] half a page
[1:34:48] it's like Maya he's holding like 10
[1:34:50] pages in his hand
[1:34:53] but that's how it works
[1:34:55] look at this this is a prayer
[1:34:58] dear heavenly father oh sometimes it
[1:35:00] hurts to be rude and hard but Lord God
[1:35:03] Pentecostal dollars has fed my children
[1:35:05] put clothes on them and when I see the
[1:35:08] church slipping away into worldliness
[1:35:11] God
[1:35:12] my heart burns because I'm zealous of
[1:35:14] that church
[1:35:16] the Lost hope that we have and yet I see
[1:35:19] your Bible says it'll be that way
[1:35:23] and this is why I'm going to go ahead
[1:35:25] and just call it quits right here
[1:35:27] because you see all that I've laid on
[1:35:29] foundation for the slipping away tonight
[1:35:32] I have that much for the catching away
[1:35:35] and so we'd be here for quite a while if
[1:35:37] we went ahead and dealt with the
[1:35:39] catching away so y'all just hold your
[1:35:40] breath
[1:35:42] amen and don't let the thoughts slip
[1:35:43] away and we'll get back to the catching
[1:35:45] away
[1:35:46] but but but but but but what does butt
[1:35:49] do
[1:35:50] negates everything in front of it
[1:35:54] but there'll be an elected called out of
[1:35:56] there for those he foreknew he called
[1:35:58] and those he called he justified and
[1:36:00] those who he justified he has already
[1:36:02] glorified
[1:36:04] look at this now I love this statement
[1:36:06] right here as we'll close on this sister
[1:36:08] Ruth you come please
[1:36:10] father
[1:36:11] that's the ones
[1:36:13] that we're pleading to tonight amen
[1:36:17] you see the one that doesn't care just
[1:36:19] formal religion
[1:36:22] I used to joke about this my brother and
[1:36:24] sister and Lord forgive me if I ever was
[1:36:26] offensive
[1:36:31] but on her way to church
[1:36:33] way that we used to drive to church you
[1:36:35] know you drive by some Churches and
[1:36:36] you'd see these families
[1:36:39] dad
[1:36:42] mom
[1:36:43] children
[1:36:46] climb out of there
[1:36:50] vehicle with a
[1:36:52] big ski boat behind it
[1:36:56] and walk into church with little short
[1:36:58] shorts
[1:36:59] [Music]
[1:37:00] and flip-flops
[1:37:04] and my heart used to ache or still does
[1:37:06] but we don't drive by there anymore
[1:37:10] they're going into
[1:37:12] Church yes church is a hospital
[1:37:16] but it's also
[1:37:18] a place we're called to meet God
[1:37:21] and that's how far things have slipped
[1:37:23] Saints
[1:37:24] I'm not judging them people trust me
[1:37:28] trust me
[1:37:30] that's how it's far
[1:37:32] walk into church with muscle shirts you
[1:37:34] know what I'm talking about just the
[1:37:35] shoulders a man your muscles are little
[1:37:37] short shorts and flip-flops
[1:37:39] going into the house of God
[1:37:42] to come and present himself to God
[1:37:46] the wife
[1:37:47] dressed very similar
[1:37:49] the children very similar
[1:37:53] you say oh that's terrible brother Paul
[1:37:56] but I'll tell you tonight Saints
[1:37:58] if it wasn't for the grace of God
[1:38:02] if it wasn't for the fact that the blood
[1:38:04] has come to us in God's grace
[1:38:07] those people were looking at would be us
[1:38:11] but I say I want to reverence the house
[1:38:13] of God
[1:38:15] I want to let the Lord know I care how I
[1:38:18] present myself to him I care about how I
[1:38:21] present myself in my prayers
[1:38:23] right we we can even pray incorrectly
[1:38:28] have the right intention
[1:38:31] have you ever done this
[1:38:33] oh well let me just rephrase that when
[1:38:36] you did this
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:40] Lord we thank you for a lovely day give
[1:38:42] me a good night's sleep father let me
[1:38:43] get a lot done tomorrow and you know
[1:38:45] what that I want to do and I'm going to
[1:38:47] foreign
[1:38:52] how God must feel
[1:38:55] we don't even tell him we love him
[1:38:57] we don't say thank you appreciation for
[1:39:00] the word
[1:39:02] we're acting almost as though God is our
[1:39:04] servant
[1:39:06] instead of us being his servant
[1:39:09] but do you notice how this works Saints
[1:39:12] it just slips
[1:39:16] so carefully
[1:39:18] so casually
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:24] prophet of God said
[1:39:26] we should be so in love with Jesus we
[1:39:28] can't wait to be in the house of God
[1:39:30] but look how things
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:35] Lord help us
[1:39:38] now I don't want to sound judgmental on
[1:39:40] that because I'm fixing to start the
[1:39:41] season tomorrow morning
[1:39:44] and I will be worked and I could use the
[1:39:47] excuse I've got an ox in the ditch but
[1:39:49] the problem is is I hired that ox
[1:39:54] God's got Grace
[1:39:56] but let's keep our eyes open tonight
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:00] of the things that the devil's trying to
[1:40:02] slip into our lives
[1:40:04] and if I would have just summed it up at
[1:40:06] that point 30 minutes ago
[1:40:09] we would have had the whole point the
[1:40:11] devil trying to slip that into our life
[1:40:14] and then we call it common and accept it
[1:40:18] let's not accept the comment let's hold
[1:40:23] to the word
[1:40:24] you love the Lord tonight
[1:40:26] amen hallelujah

[1:53:33] Hallelujah God bless your Saints amen
[1:53:37] pray for one another
[1:53:39] lift one another up
[1:53:41] amen whatever way that works for you
[1:53:45] but as I've told you many times what
[1:53:47] works for me is I just have to start on
[1:53:49] one end of the valley
[1:53:51] and I have to turn on this street I have
[1:53:53] to drive up there
[1:53:55] I go by the Graham's house
[1:53:58] I don't say this to both this is just
[1:54:00] how I do it I drive into town and I
[1:54:05] go by brother Bob and sister Joanns
[1:54:08] I go over a street or two whatever it is
[1:54:12] I don't even remember their names I just
[1:54:14] have to drive by Braille
[1:54:16] and I drive up the road and I turn in by
[1:54:18] Brother David sister Diane sister Ruth
[1:54:22] and I go up and I just do that and weave
[1:54:24] my way across the valley
[1:54:26] I go over there
[1:54:28] I heard somebody say this and I don't
[1:54:30] get offended oh eagle
[1:54:33] that's where the rich people live
[1:54:36] and I think brother Trevor and sister
[1:54:39] Carrie
[1:54:40] and I think just how rich they are
[1:54:43] they've got a treasure
[1:54:45] greater than any other treasure there is
[1:54:48] on the face of the Earth
[1:54:50] and we weave our way right through the
[1:54:52] neighborhoods and while she's not here
[1:54:55] yet I've already found myself driving
[1:54:57] out to our sister April's
[1:55:01] turning into that
[1:55:05] praying there
[1:55:07] wind in my way in case I missed someone
[1:55:10] Hallelujah
[1:55:13] those y'all left out that was just for
[1:55:14] sacred time
[1:55:16] I didn't leave you out
[1:55:18] so pray for one another
[1:55:20] lifted up in sincerity
[1:55:24] it's a wonderful thing this body of
[1:55:26] Christ
[1:55:27] this family of God it's it's beautiful
[1:55:29] you know I made a statement on the
[1:55:32] pulpit the other day probably shocked a
[1:55:33] few of you I saw eyebrows raised when I
[1:55:35] told you about how I had a love affair
[1:55:37] with sister Sharon
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:41] I have a love affair with sister Sharon
[1:55:43] because I'm loving the fact that God is
[1:55:45] moving
[1:55:46] in her life
[1:55:48] and she is responding
[1:55:51] there's the love affair I'll give
[1:55:53] Clarity to that
[1:55:55] I just love what God is doing
[1:55:57] it's beautiful
[1:55:59] it's wonderful it's life-changing and I
[1:56:03] love it
[1:56:04] I love it I'm just in love
