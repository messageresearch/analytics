confidence serve him every day can you say Amen to that thank you Lord amen [Music] as we would just um get ready to enter in into our thought today I just want to just uh those that we maybe didn't uh remember or List uh today we want to remember our sister April uh she's still I think working some uh ketchup shifts or whatever to to cover her time and uh so we want Lord just be a blessing to her uh and uh sister Gabriella you know it's just kind of scary we see our young people are remember I first met brother Adam and Sister Sarah Gabriella was I'll say this wrong so don't you guys misinterpret this but she was just the cutest little girl and she's still cute she's just not so little anyway she's went off on a little road trip we just want the Lord to be with her keep her safe and brother Prashant sister akoncho we know their heart we know that their heart would be to be here today uh sitting right here in our midst and brother Prashant just had a birthday a few days ago and sister akonsha just had a birthday yesterday and not putting their birthdays above anyone else's but they really should be celebrating them here I really really should not be a long distance relationship there uh so we wish them happy birthday and God bless them if they're listening today and my brother Adrian sister Ada and Kalispell Montana we just want to lift them up and just reading some of the um uh testimonies the witness coming out of the Ukraine it's not just Ukraine this is affecting all the bride of Christ uh in that part of the world but the Lord is timely many lovely reports of of God just coming right on the scene right at the moment to um Bless the people and uh sometimes uh you know you read a little report of maybe somebody taking a different route than normal and finding out later that a missile had landed right in that very area we know our God is in control we know amen so remember each and every one of those and anyone else we might have forgotten uh Lord help us I know sister Sophie's back Chicago brother Manasseh I think Grace is probably with her brother Manassas graduating from college this Monumental moments in our lives amen I want to remind you a bible study this evening at five so all of you that could make it and then this will be our last call for us the seals books um so if you have not responded please let me know we want to make sure we order adequate number for the Saints here in the church I was talking with brother George he has now received what you might say is the Prototype copy which is uh the you might say one-up copy that they had made for final approval and brother George says it's a lovely book it's put together very well the same quality as the church age book leather covered uh the paperback is good thick paper good solid book but brother George you know really really would say you're going to be blessed if you just get the leather book because it it's just going to be a lifelong book so let's turn in our Bibles today I want to speak to you thank you musicians I want to speak to you once again it's been a little bit since I touched on this but of things that are to be now the things that are to be Saints are the promise of the word that has been spoken in not all of that promise was you might say brought right by Brother Branham at this time you see brother Branham put together by his own testimony the loosed ends of the ages and there were things that God waited for this day to reveal but many of these things are just being put in order now if any of you have ever worked in a warehouse now I I did as a Young Man worked in a warehouse for a season and um you know under the management a warehouse can become chaos where people would say we know it's here but we can't find it and so in that we'll find that Under New Management and an orderly fashion is there that if it says that it is on a certain aisle in a certain position you with confidence can go there and find it and I use that analogy because you see that's what the prophet of God did in our day he didn't come to bring something that was out of the scripture but it was there in chaos that people were saying we think this means this and we think that means that the prophet of God come and he set this in order where we as Believers or Christians today can come and say you know what if we're willing to put the effort in we can come and say here it is in the scripture now you know brother George puts it this way coming from a Baptist background being raised by parents that were Baptist missionaries brother George puts it quite strongly and says you know any old Baptist can bury most message Believers in the scripture so it's really a delinquency that we have allowed to take place that we don't know our Bibles better than we do amen so we're not going to be able to blame anyone else people say well the message this no it's you amen Lord help us Amen to just be more diligent to to dig into that so uh we just want to look at these things that are to be going on through that and today I'd like to speak to you on possessing our reward and we will take that out of second John the first chapter verses one through eight and uh in this we're going to look my brother and sister at the word and what the word is saying about us now the word is corrective can we say Amen to that it should be amen I think it was A.W Tozer said that um you know people are might be over there and say you know what um what you preached to me was too harsh but he says God's ministers are not some Lily livered people afraid of offending someone pretty strong words isn't it but we actually like preachers who don't offend us we feel more comfortable we can go to church not worried about kind of getting called but my brother and sister when we get there that day and stand and our little fluffy preacher that sold us short you're not going to look at him and say well I still enjoyed your preaching you're going to look at him on that day and say why didn't you tell me the truth amen so we want to strike the balance right not to be offensive but to definitely preach the truth amen so I love this out of second John uh sister Jerry after all these years many of you will say oh brother Paul that's old hunt but just the other day sister Jerry showed me how that I can actually listen to my Bible on my phone while I'm working now some of you are going to say brother Paul that's been around since they put the Bible on the phone but you see I'm a late bloomer and a late embracer of Technology amen but it's been good I've been just listening as I drive back and forth at three and a half miles an hour and the tractor is doing all the work so I'm have a lot of time to focus on what I'm hearing and it's good amen second John 1 1-8 the Elder unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth not I only but also all they have known the truth for the truth's sake which dwelleth in US so where are we going to find the word living in US shall be with us forever imagine that if we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and we will be with him in eternity we have always been in truth even when we are not cognizant of Truth we were in truth amen Grace be with you mercy and peace from God the father and from the Lord Jesus Christ the son of the father in truth and love I Rejoice greatly that I found of thy children Walking In Truth as we have received a commandment from the father and now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another and this is love that we walk after his Commandments this is a Commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning that ye should walk in it for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh now my brother and sister it's all on how you want to interpret this many people will say yes yes I know Jesus Christ He Walked In the Flesh I believe myself now I don't want to make a Doctrine but I believe this scripture is not talking about his flesh that was there on the shores of Galilee but it's talking about him walking in flesh today amen and you'd be shocked that people actually don't believe that they believe God's in heaven and we are just these little people down here trying to do our best but as I shared with you the other day my brother and sister this isn't what I'm trying to be this is what God Said I am amen so if we are the word amen and it was poured into flesh in this day then we are the very manifestation of the scripture amen this is a deceiver and an antichrist pretty strong words there look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward Heavenly Father we just ask you to lead us today guide us father for those that are sick father we just ask the Lord that you would touch Lord bodies affirmities father ear aches whatever it might be that would be a hindrance today uh stomach aches whatever it might be father just ask you to come down touch each one and Lord is the prophet of God as talking about Oral Roberts and preaching of of having a point of contact now the prophet lays it out father I just pray today that each one Lord that might hear this but is not in the house of God would not set back and bemoan the fact Lord but would be able to reach out the point of contact which is you the Holy Spirit and lay claim on that Lord that they would find their very Deliverance the afflictions father physically mentally emotionally spiritually today in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you Lord in your name amen you may be seated you know I was just um visiting with a brother a friend of mine that is a pastor and he was we were talking along a certain subject line and he said you know brother Paul he said what would fix a lot of problems around the message and you know you're always interested in something that will give you the antidote how to fix problems right amen you know if you uh if you have a little something and and you don't know how to fix it you you someone says I know how you know you listen to them often times uh seems though you know in the world of Google Dr Google Etc that they have their own ideas it's not really a proven remedy but you know it's just the nature of man that we would live and try to do that and the brother says I tell you uh how we can fix the problems in the message and I think that I'll lift my hand for you today that we really want to fix the problems that we see around us and he said if we would just listen to the word and how brother Branham brought it out and just love one another that would fix a lot of our problems amen because the love is there covers a multitude of sins and my brother and sister will look at this and the uh Apostle John we see John is projecting uh the love of God to the seed of the elect seed of God he's speaking to them in a very positive fashion uh you know is telling them uh to the Elder unto the elector lady and her children who I love in the truth now John is not saying if you don't agree with me I don't love you but he is saying that there is a certain bond that comes in The Fellowship of the word of God in the truth that is there that draws together and that is what knits us together as a group of Believers from different countries cultures languages Etc that it is not just some great overwhelming human love but it is the very love of our Lord Jesus Christ and that grows from there into a love as it is for individuals now that brings us to understand who they are and how people are and to have Grace for each one of us is little idiosyncrasies and uh if you don't think you have idiosyncrasies just ask me I can point them out for you but it's there that I want to just talk to you for a moment on uh gender pronouns amen that seems like a strange topic right to throw in the middle of this but as you look at this John is speaking to the bride of Christ he's speaking to men and women boys girls uh to the elders to the babes and he calls them the elect lady there is and you say that's not what they mean really brother Paul well you'll forgive me for my interpretation but you see he branded them with an identification that they are one elect and two they're a lady amen and we know that the church has always been represented in the feminine and so it's there that it shows this election of God was to reach out and not to a rebel this is not some depiction my brother and sister of a rebellious church but this is a church that is a lady are you with me you would find that in this day and age it's actually offensive in the age of pronouns and such you hold the door and I experience this somewhat recent you hold the door and they don't look at you and as they walk by they Mumble something that resembled thank you and then you say thank you ma'am and then you see there's nothing feminine there's nothing that's a lady there it's a female identified by whatever Spirit they choose to be identified with and so that is the age that we're living in that to be qualified as the elect lady first you're going to have to be elected but you're going to have to also have this manifestation of a submissive Church it can't be a church that is headstrong it cannot be a people that are going to do it their way and then blame it on God when it doesn't work like the word said it would and so this elect lady my brother and sister but not her only her children also so the church of living God in this day is producing children amen not only the natural but producing children in the spiritual that are once again qualified to be called the elect lady to step in and say you know what I know who I am in Jesus Christ and I'm not ashamed to be identified as Mrs Jesus Christ his wife amen not not to have to do I find it interesting I don't blame anybody if anybody here would be or somewhere else would be but I find it interesting in light of the scripture that we see in this day and age that people get married and will not take the husband's name they still want to maintain an identity that is outside of that now you know I like to listen to Dave Ramsey uh you know money guy not all the time just when the moment is uh you know right got a moment there to listen and you know here's a guy nominal Christian but you know pretty wise in the ways of the world and finances Etc and just a few days ago someone called in and said you know me and my husband or having these troubles and he keeps overspending and I have to keep subsidizing him and you know it's right at that point Dave Ramsey says Whoa stop what do you mean you're subsidizing him well you know he's doing so he digs into this and the husband is taking and using his paycheck to pay for the house the cars the groceries everything and then she has her paycheck and she's angry that she has to actually contribute to this relationship and Dave Ramsey said are you telling me you have their separate accounts and she said yes I I'm not going to share my account with him man this guy can be blunt my brother and sister he if he was called to be a preacher most people wouldn't like him he says you know I'm sorry you're not going to like this but I don't think your marriage is going to last very long now my brother and sister you look back in this scripture and this is the picture that God paints for us of Israel as a wife wanted to live and do but they wanted God to make the contribution they wanted God to be the sole support while they lived like they wanted to live and that relationship from the beginning of the book all the way until God calls 144 000 has been a troubled relationship but look where God is called this elect Lady of this day called her we're not dish Rags amen and we should not treat our natural wives daughters that way but my brother and sister this elect lady is submissive and if God says stop she stops if God says go she goes if God says I want you to pray about it before you do it we pray about it before we do it and we take those things as the prophet of God said if it's a question mark set it on his shelf God will answer it in time and we want to be obedient to that it sure says saves a lot of Heartache my brother and sister of having to go back and fix things that we did and then we say Lord why'd you allow it to happen he didn't allow it to happen we were disobedient we stepped out of his will we stepped over into our own realm of what we were sure God wanted us to do but did we even ask God no we had an opinion of what he thought but you see as I shared with you last Wednesday one of the biggest blessings the greatest blessings and God got it right the first time brother Branham said is he gave us his word amen often times we need to go no further when I didn't agree with the pastor I didn't agree with the financial counselor I didn't agree with the marriage counselor I didn't agree with this I didn't agree with that my brother and sister oftentimes if we just go back to the word first amen we wouldn't have these problems but we skipped the word and we go out someone else's opinion oh my well I'm preaching to Paul today okay if that's all right amen now in the seven Church ages I I don't know this comes up here uh Brothers put a little note we'll have to this this screen is on the blink um literally um so you recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book that we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it right this is a very uh We've read this quote so many times but it's relevant every single day of our life amen so it's if we don't if he doesn't give it to us amen then it's we we will fail to get it uh bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real now I'm going to just insert this real quick here a brother I won't mention his name but years ago he's probably one of the most simple preachers I've ever heard preach and he gone up and he just started preaching and he's there and he says now over here and he reads a quote and then he only makes a couple comments and he said and hear and he reads a quote and he did this for about an hour and you're thinking okay brother you're on quote number 42. but I'll tell you what happened because God led him to put that in a certain order and God led him in the fashion to bring that at the end of the service the Holy Spirit fell down so strong and moved so strong amongst the people because you see God wasn't there saying he's a perfect preacher God was there saying my words been given to the people and I'm going to honor my word amen we get so caught up in the eloquence and the way that men can put things together and put personality into it my brother and sister are God's pleased when he hears his word spoken back to him that's what he wants to hear is his word spoken back to him Lord help us each one to speak the word amen not our negative thoughts not our negative ideas not the negative of life but the word let that be the word that comes back and God forgive us for our negatism amen so you look at this see amen it comes together see it won't take ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people amen I want you today to just you don't have to say it out loud but I would like you to think in your heart I am a special class of people amen maybe we could say it out loud I am a special class of people amen and to believe that and realize that God didn't just throw this out to be picked up as it were on litter on the side of the road but God said I know who I'm going to put my word in and I know I'm how to activate that word and I know how to bring it to pass and I say thank you Lord for that it will take one with a prophetic Insight now my brother and sister I don't mean to speak any words no political points here but the prophet of God in this if you follow the context he's talking about who prophets no people so he is declaring that the people not just the prophet for the age a messenger for the age amen that angel to the age it's not just him that's going to have prophetic Insight it's the people of that age that God has called are going to have prophetic insight to see what a prophet projected amen because if it's projected and we can't see it then it won't do us any good so the people themselves as the prophet of God says now you know read between the lines there's people that are opposed to the idea of commoners reading between the lines but my prophet in the books that I have read the tapes I have heard told me read between the lines and so it is a prophetic Insight you say well that's no big deal no I'm telling you it is for you to be able to read between the lines is actually prophetic insight to catch that portion that was spoken my brother and sister brother Brown's talking about as it come with the first second third pull and how the fishing line got tangled up and all of that stuff and God's dealing with him and that comes about because God told Brother Branham do not tell this to the public but brother random so wanting to help the people that he lays this out and it's there that we see now he's telling the story of the dream and how the fishing line gets Tangled Up and people are there like well I don't get it well I'll tell you what the bride of Christ gets it amen when we as humans start meddling into the word of God out of time and out of place and season then the line is going to get tangled up that doesn't mean the line is completely destroyed it doesn't mean you'll never catch another fish but my brother and sister we as a church we as a body of Believers want to be in step with the revealed word of the hour I can't make it happen you can't make it happen but we are a part of The Happening amen we are a part of the fulfilling of the word amen so this special class of people it'll take prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God now my brother and sister there's many people on the Earth today that are saying well God spoke to me God spoke to me God spoke to me you know in the position of a pastor and different things you hear this all the time not just you know in the local realm you might say but different things in interacting with people and then you give them six months or a year and they are going directly counter to the very thing they said God spoke to me now my brother and sister the prophet of God ask us does God change his mind no so what's happening is is someone believed in what they thought so strongly they were sure we're not calling them liars deceivers or whatever but they believed in that thought so strongly they were sure it had to come from God well the prophet of God said I've got a cure for that one too go ahead and run it through this filter and if it'll fit through this filter then it's me speaking but if it won't go through the filter be man enough be woman enough to sit down and say that was my thought that was my idea that was my opinion because you see my brother and sister there's nothing more embarrassing as it is in the natural let me put it just into a natural basis there's nothing more embarrassing than being so certain that you have the answer and being quite vocal about the answer to be proven wrong are you with me oh no it's this percentage have your grandchild well don't believe everything on the internet especially if it proves you wrong no no sometimes we have to come to a reality that we get certain things in our mind hmm well should we move on or should we stay here just elect lady now as I have belabored this just a little bit I want you to realize my brother and sister when John was speaking to you and I and that's what he was doing he was speaking to you and I as he's speaking to us he really if he was standing here today would want to drive home to you the very fact that Satan will do everything he can do and we see it in the world we live in and I'm sorry I'll touch on the culture for a minute I don't mean to it's not our worry it's not our labor but my brother and sister what it is we see out here in the world today we can mock them and we can do all kinds of things but that's not right because what we're doing is seeing where the word declared that they would not know their right hand from their left they would not know up from down it would be chaos and confusion and their identity would be lost now my brother and sister as Israel had lost its identity for Generations you'll notice that right now her identity is coming back in bits and pieces coming back to her she's starting to recognize there are those within Israel even right now that are having a uh what we would consider a prophetic insight to the hundred and forty four thousand they're realizing that all these people that have come back into the land of Israel that have thy blood in them are not God's chosen now my brother and sister that culturally is not an accepted thing no more than you sitting here this morning and saying we are the Bride of Jesus Christ will the nominal World want to accept that they're going to say who do you think you are but my brother and sister it's not you when I sing that we're that it's the word that has come to us and been embedded in our heart to say that's the word and I identify with this and it's not going to be that we simply just go to church and go home and count our duty for the day but it is an act direct uh uh you might say uh um oh my how am I going to say this it's an absolute direct connection to God to come into the house of God and worship him now it doesn't mean nobody worships if they're out of the house of God but there is something that means something to the bride of Christ to come and fulfill every portion of the word now not everybody wants to do that they come out of obligation they come out of you know thinking they'll be judged or looked down on if they don't come to the house of God my brother and sister my Bible tells me that as I see that day approaching I should be in the house of God and so something stirs in me I don't say well if I don't do that I must not be a believer no I'm telling you something stirs in my heart I want to be in the house of God Amen now you know sometimes our old flesh we get tired we get a little discouraged we get whatever the devil tells us well it doesn't matter but my brother and sister I tell you drink another cup of coffee come to the house of God jump up and down a little bit get the Jitters out go home you'll be blessed amen so we look at this elect is carefully selected or chosen so this carefully or selected lady now my brother and sister his brother Branham talks about this I'm just going to elaborate it on a little stronger sense any man that would go out here just go down to the shopping mall or go wherever and just go down the sidewalk and the first available young lady he'd just say marry me that man is deceived he is in a delusion that's not how it works that's not what you should do and God didn't just go through you might say Time and Eternity and see the sea Gene of humanity and just say I'll take this one and I'll take that one and I'll call this one a wife and I'll call that one a bride no sir God looked down and he said I see a seed Gene I see something that is there I see something what am I doing I'm seeing they will believe because it's already in them God didn't have to come and poke the seed into you the seed was born in you amen from the very mind of God in the beginning amen and so is it there we realize you've been carefully selected Hitler tried to do it and that old Aryan Spirit still out there trying to do it the whole deal of any color that's kind of trying to say we're the master of the race my brother and sister I'm not talking about from race to race I'm talking about within a race saying we're the master of the race we are the perfect of this we are no my brother and sister and it doesn't work in the church to come down and say well our church has it nobody else does I'm more spiritual than them God's going to deal with me my brother and sister God deals with ignorant unlearned people he deals with people that got dirt behind their ears amen look through the ages God chooses who he did and the seed was there and when the star appeared God had Shepherds my brother and sister that stunk like sheep and they saw hmm thank you Lord but so did the Magi who were actually very rich traitors but God knew and God selected and God knew that they would be the elect lady now brother Branham shows us love projected so we'll look in this you know John's speaking that he loves he loves these people this that love the truth that have the truth he loves them now I want you to catch this how we would look at this today and brother Branham shows us love projected and just as I was sharing that this brother spoke that a lot of problems would be fixed around the message if we would just drop down all the high Mighty ideas and just actually love people and when you see them make a mistake amen do any of you know of things in this church you disagree with hmm well that makes me feel good there must not be one problem in this church come on be honest Saints but what we what do we do we don't go over here with a pile of wood in the parking lot time to a post throw gasoline on them and flip matches at them and decide if the fire takes off it was God's will they burn up oh no they did things crazy like that in the in days gone by put people in the middle of a wood pile and then shoot flaming arrows and if it goes up in Flames that was God's judgment if it doesn't it was God's grace craziness God called you and I to judge each other by the word but the more grace that has come to us hear me now the more grace that has come to us the more grace we are supposed to extend so as we recognize how Fallen that we were to realize that whatever might be a shortcoming in someone's life that our job is not to judge them our job is to lift them up amen let's be the muskox of the message amen when one is hurt and wounded let's get around them amen and let's put our horns as it were out against the enemy and dare them to come and take our weak or sickly but instead more like the wildebeest we've witnessed this drive up literally walked a wildebeest baby bounce off the ground just been born sat there take a picture or two Marvel thousands upon thousands of wildebeests here Marvel wow we got to witness this and then we went on to look a little something looked turned around and come back my brother and sister that little wildebeest wasn't laying there on the ground God gave that little will to Beast an ability to rise up in its infancy and a family you might say of of God Amen this wildebeest family they didn't go Galloping off my brother and sister but that little guy got up and was able to stay in the body and we couldn't find him anywhere we saw the herd moving and we look there's no stragglers there's no nothing God help us we also saw a little zebra didn't actually literally see the little guy born but just all the slobbers of birth is hanging off this little guy we come driving up there brother Gideon pulls us up there and we're like he's like that's newborn like we just missed its Birth by just that much and you know what happened every Mama zebra come and we're there in the van maybe here to the back of the church or back of the sanctuary as all the farther away we are and every Mama zebra come and stood where we couldn't see this little baby we pull forward they literally doing some calculus a little geometry angle projection visual move forward you can't see something in nature God help us as a bride of Christ help us that we will protect the little ones the newborn whatever it might be the weak in our body amen as we would project and put ourselves but brother Branham here now is showing us love projected and God uses a bull now that's the last thing in the world we would think that God would need to do to use to give love projected but my brother and sister we've got to understand I love this story because the prophet's first reaction you see God put him in a corner has God ever put you in a corner amen I have God hasn't and just look forward to it because he'll use the corner sometimes to deal with us so what is it brother Branham comes there and the bull gets up and his first reaction is to reach for that gun it's going to defend himself there's no gun oh my you know the thought had to go through his mind turn and run like you have never run since you were a child but there was also something there just says bull I'm sorry I'm in your house I'm in your pasture I'm I'm the one that's distracting you [Music] I think we need some maturing I think we need some maturing Church we get upset at people if they don't hold the door for us we get upset when people do things that we think is just completely contrary to Common Sense we get upset over over human behaviors could I challenge us would it be all right if I challenged us this morning let our first inspect Instinct be project love not throw a curse on the ball that he'd get struck down Angel come with a sword and Pierce The Bully die right there on the scene too no sir the prophet of God stepped right over into a realm and said I'm sorry and if that wasn't enough God comes along with some Hornets see it was you could say that's a one-time occurrence my brother and sister I think I'd be more afraid of the Hornets than the bull actually and the prophet of God then speaks to the Hornets and they circle around and they go right back into their nest now I don't know how much experience you guys have with Hornets I have never ever in my life seen a hornet that listened and the more you swing your arms the Madder they get but they were already had an attitude and were mad before you started swinging your arms and running and a prophet of God projects love to them and says I'm sorry you know what our response would be we would run bat our hands and fast we could get in the house amen kill the chain the ones that chased us in there and we come out armed with raid in both hands I'll teach you guys a lesson but the prophet of God says I'm sorry I Disturbed you and the presence of God was strong enough my brother and sister that those Hornets responded the presence of God was there why are they before the fall they were creatures that might have landed on your hand and wiggled their little antenna at you as they did their you know pollen and whatever else they do my brother and sister they didn't look at you as something to take a bite out of and so what did happen is God took those Hornets right back before the fall and they recognized that presence of almighty God God the Holy Ghost was in their midst and it changed them are you with me amen and God is in our presence and it should be changing us yeah the human reaction you know that falls on a lot of things in our life come on Saints I'm not preaching I'm not preaching to a bunch of saints but I'm preaching to Saints this morning amen the human reaction is the reaction we have to deal with sometimes someone can do you completely wrong and it's not about them but it's about how we react to it and God wants you and I he'll deal with them amen but what did we do are we going to justify our world of anger and and anxieties by what they did no that isn't what God called God said I want you to respond I want you to do the right thing I want to be manifested in you oh Hallelujah my brothers and sisters when God gives you a thought sometimes things just prove to come and know you're on the right track amen you know the biggest thing is is the reason I behave like I did is because you behaved like you did go tell Saint Peter that at the gate yeah I rented I raved I slobbered I shouted stomped screamed but it wasn't my fault no it is you're the elect lady you're the one that God has projected love into you're the one that God has revealed himself into well Jesus braided the cord and chased him out of the temple come on find a better excuse amen you know what backed up Jesus Behavior there judgment begins at the house of God so my brother and sister I want you to understand this see in verse 4 he says I Rejoice greatly that I found of thy children Walking In Truth amen so as we go back and kind of connect to Wednesday night you look at them now them lepers are sitting outside of the gates and my brother and sister life is pretty tough there's a famine in the land that is imposed by being surrounded by a conquering Army and they are sitting there in the gate and they realize we go in the city we're going to die of hunger there and if we sit right here we're going to die of hunger what have I got to lose by just simply walking now it looks like I'm walking down into the midst of the enemy my brother and sister when God placed a bride in laodicea 2023 a prophet of God thought we would be gone by now but God In His Infinite Wisdom says no you have not come to the fullness of the camp of the syrians yet for a complete deliverance and so what I'm going to do is you won't sit here and starve in the city you're not going to say out there I'm going to anoint you to get up and I want you to start walking and that is exactly what we're doing today Saints we are walking here in this age called laodicea and God has a great feast a great banquet for the bride of Christ at the end of this walk amen but if you don't ever make it to the camp of the syrians you're never going to feast and never going to as I joked the other night be able to fill out your 401K with their gold and silver you gotta walk you got to get to the camp you got to be part of this to fulfill the scripture someone had to but God annoyed to them I didn't go there Wednesday night God anointed them to go back and tell the king and the King's house which means the people that there is a great feast here and whether people come right the man who was scoffing the man who said all as God would open the windows of Heaven Was trampled in the gate of the city some will never see it some are caught up ran over by the things of this world they are that seed that was planted in the thorns and the thistles and were consumed and covered up and choked out my brother and sister but God called you and I walk come on are we going to walk or not we're not going to sit down and just say hey look you know this is what's happening and we don't know why God hasn't had a Rapture maybe maybe I'm the one go ahead and say that to yourself amen we want this to be not uh exclusive but inclusive I might be the one that God is waiting for but don't get angry with yourself Rejoice that God cares enough to wait for you yeah thank you Lord so you're anointed walking the truth amen if God wants you to just be religious you'd just be religious I want you to think about that what it is to be religious do you guys any of you know people who are just what you might call Super or hyper religious I happen to know people they're hyper religious they lie cheat steal curse Smoke Drink dance everything have gravel delivered in their driveway and walk out there and there's a pyramid-shaped stone in their driveway oh this was all about not the fact we had you know eight inch deep mud hole in our driveway this is about God delivering this this pyramid-shaped rock to my house they'd pick your pocket lie to you while they do it but they can turn that stone into something super spiritual God wanted you to be religious you'd be religious God wants you to be his elect lady and he is forming Us by the word forming Us by our trials and our struggles forming Us by fire to be the elect lady not super religious not super spiritual although that's just fine if God's given you an understanding of the word in that fashion I'm not speaking against that but that's not our evidence by brother and sister the prophet of God said he gave us the best first and that was the word let the word be our Guiding Light amen now look he's give us his revealed word it's come alive the select lady knows what God wants amen Esther she knew exactly how to catch the king's attention when she was dealing amen when she needed things to happen she knew how to catch the king's attention amen she didn't like the curtains in the palace on fire right she welcomed him into her presence and he was happy to be there because he was in love with her he loved her voice he loved who she was he loved everything about her then she knew it God help us to know God how much God loves us amen now look at this as uh verse 4 and they're walking in truth and five and I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which had from the beginning that we love one another see the word of God puts that significance on there and the prophet put that significance on there I think it must mean something I think God wants an emphasis for you and I now you guys know I'm just who I am the youngest child my wife says I was spoiled rotten that's why I am how I am amen just jokingly amen but you look at this my brother and sister there's always been something in me since I was a little kid I know it probably makes some of you nervous when I look you in the face and say I love you uh I'm sorry that's who I've been since I was just a little guy it's just I I that's a place of inhibition you might say to me and I see people's reaction to that they kind of pull back a little like whoa this guy's getting intimate here but I want you to know my brother and sister that that comes from deep inside me not a not a human element but something inside of me I love God's people I love to be able to fellowship and interact and be connected two and it's there in that place and I believe I use that not speaking of myself but use that that God's moving in you and I to have such a deep rooted love for one another it's not a love of lust it's not a love of Flesh it's not a love of these things but a deep rooted love that had to come from the Throne of almighty God that's what he's calling us to that we can look at one another in the right way to word it in the right way not sensual not of the world not of those things but from the heart and it's obvious it came from the heart I love you and we can speak that to one another and that is only the love of God coming down and touching Our Lives Hallelujah Hallelujah amen in First Peter 4 8 9 it says above all things have fervent charity which is love kindness among yourselves for charity shall cover multitude of sins use Hospitality one to another without grudging you know my brother and sister it is it is a difficult day that we live in at a time when Satan would come and one of the worst things we can do whether it's in friendships or let me put marriage first whether it's in marriage or French hints is to keep score wow somebody just pulled poured cold water all over the church if you find yourself keeping score go repent right we're supposed to put our sins on the altar every day let us be so anointed to put those of others that have been against us you might say those things that have been harsh and difficult to deal with if you'll lay that on the altar every single day you will find such a liberty and then when you do that you'll be able to have mercy for that person not judgment for them but mercy and I'll tell you what that'll be some of the best marriage counseling you'll ever hear is when you come to the place that whatever your husband or wife has done that you can take and just put that on the Altar and say Lord I know they didn't mean it I know that's not who they are I know that's not your will or your desire Lord I'm going to lay that down I'm not going to let the devil anoint it I'll tell you how that turns out if you allow the devil to anoint it anybody ever burnt yourself now anybody ever cut yourself now what happens in the week following getting burnt or cutting you know you get a sunburn you go to church you're you're maybe out there you know in a a t-shirt with short sleeves mowing the yard and a Saturday and and you're just like toasted and then you go to church and every single brother in the church will come up and hit you on the shoulder and say God bless you brother amen you burn your hand everybody in the church will want to shake your hand that day and before it's all done it's an irritation and I tell you when you don't forgive brothers and sisters and family husbands wives Etc the devil will come and he'll keep slapping that until you're so irritated you're angry but if you'll lay that on the Altar and the devil will come a slopping he'll come around remember remember and if you can in all sincerity look him in the face and say what are you talking about amen my sins are in the sea of God forgetfulness and I've took and attached every offense and everything that would hinder my walk I attached it to that and sent it right down there to that seal amen and the devil will be like well it won't do any good to try and irritate these people why because love projected oh God help us help us Amen in life's story brother Branham says and we each have a life that God has given us can we say amen and we must live it and I'm saying actually thank you very much Lord because if I had been given a different life you know my brother and sister I won't go into it to elaborate but within my family history there's quite interesting stories we'll just leave it at that very interesting stories but they took Holy Communion at Christmas two years ago and all is well but you see when God revealed the truth when he opened the book when he poured out Revelation to a special class of people we realize that's not who I was in the beginning God never held that to my account I had never committed it in the first place but I have a desire because he took and wrote that on the fleshly table of my heart I have no desire to sin and when I come short I can lay it before my father because I have an advocate before the father that will cover that for me amen it changes our perspective it's not about I can go take the Holy Eucharist I can go to confession I can do these things and take it away no I can go to my father amen I can go to my husband and he'll say yes yes I forgive you and you're Washed by the precious blood of Jesus to my humble opinion if you'll get this I think the most best life in the world now I'm taking that to say the very top of the top the most best amen no matter whether it's up or down if we'll find God's path and walk in it where God has ordained for us to walk you see there's no more miserable person than somebody who's walking out of the will of God a backslidden Christian is the most miserable person you'll ever meet because deep down inside they know they know God has ordained for us to walk if we always we find Victory no matter I think of blind Fanny Crosby when she was sitting there in the darkness and the question was once asked what do you think of Christ whose son is he do you know this story go look it up go read it I'll just put it in common words Fanny Crosby's answer was I'll give everything to him what he chooses to give back to me I accept hmm she had a relationship she had a revelation of that relationship my brother and sister she was blind maybe no hope to ever have sight she didn't care because she had Christ my my oh my you know a lot of facets to this is Brother George always says let us be balanced now I want you to look here this examining of ourselves my brother and sister it's not just a communion thing but it's literally how that we can walk into the word of God without a single hindrance in our life when we go through the examination process of ourself examining by the grace of God ourself that's when we have confidence in God that's when we walk in and we can look back and say you know what this old flesh man made mistakes but me as a Son of God me as a daughter of God I'm perfect before him I've been washed in the blood and that blood is powerful it didn't let a little bit get by behind my ear it didn't buy on my collar I'll tell you how it is my brother and sister I used to laugh at any kind of anywhere you might be or something and there'd be some commercial about our detergent will take the dirt out of the ring around the collar and I'll tell you what I would be like Jerry there's there's a detergent to take the ring out of the the caller of your work shirts and Jerry would just laugh and say Paul there is no detergent that will take the ring out of the collar of your work shirts because you see in the world I live in the world I work in the dirt and the grime amen those callers are so ring around the collar that there's no way you're going to get that dirt out my brother and sister but I'm telling you there's no ring around my heart that the blood of Jesus Christ cannot wash perfectly away and I say thank you Lord amen we might get a con accustomed to some things here in the natural but we should never become accustomed to that kind of stuff in the spiritual Hallelujah let me hurry on Amen now look at this these facets to examine ourselves in verse 8 he says look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought and the word rot there is there are several different things for but the simplest definition of that uh the things which we have wrought is those things which we have labored for we started out to serve the Lord many years ago and we're moving forward my brother and sister let's not let things come in our lives in our families in our church that would keep us from receiving the reward of what we have labored for but I'll guarantee you Satan's there 24 hours a day pecking away trying to get us to come to a place that we're discouraged well I don't have any friends well find a friend in Jesus amen I'll tell you that's the that's the preacher's complaint every preacher I've ever talked to in a personal level will tell you don't have friends it doesn't work that way it's difficult it's hard and you know the prophet of God himself says I know so much about people that when I get in their presence I labor under that burden it must have been hard for the prophet to sit down with those Brothers on a you know a hunting trip or a fishing trip and maybe just there not even calling not Desiring but just seeing these things that are going on and how that must have drawn on him and I don't see that I have not not at that ability but you come to a place the things that even the Saints have said brother Paul pray for this and pray for that they become burdens to you and the thing is is no natural friend is going to relieve that burden I'll tell you what I made a mistake many years ago there was some situation that was just eating me up and I was sitting One Night in fellowship with a brother and I said well brother what do you think about this and my brother and sister when it was all done before it even got out totally out of my mouth I knew I had made a drastic mistake he looked like a deer in the headlights and I was like oh God forgive me doesn't make me special it just isn't that realm is there and it's hard to deal with but I'm telling you my brother and sister what we're doing is God has bringeth us to a place that we are laboring we are working for we are moving forward we are possessing this land and we're not called to look back of what happened in Egypt or what happened in the wilderness of sin or what happened when Moses struck the rock my brother and sister want to call to look at that we're called to look at the promised land and I'm not going to get there today but I'm telling you there's such incredible signs that we see my brother and sister of what God is doing but if we look back I can remember brother oh you know brother Trevor I I remember one time it was oh and and this and I remember I oh and I remember Anna and you would be the same way I remember the time brother Paul didn't necessarily treat me quite right and I my brother and sister what is it doing Satan's trying to erase what we have labored for we're not called look back we're called to put that under the blood of Jesus Christ and say Lord help my brother my brother's wrong help him Lord if I didn't receive it right help me Lord but to move forward claiming those things we have labored for Hallelujah amen now in Shalom brother Brown says changing the pages or changing calendars doesn't change time a lot of people say well the old Year's gone throw away the old December calendar now put up another one a new year and that's what New Year's means to them to me I want to see what's promised for the day I want to know what the light of the hour is so I can know how to walk in it can we say Amen this morning Lord I want to know how to walk in the word for my hour I don't need to worry about if God's going to take care of you you you or you I need to look and walk in the light God has given to me oh Hallelujah sorry I'm getting wound up amen so I know how I want to know where I'm living what age I'm in how far up the road am I and Paul said I could stand quoting and could stand quoting again forgetting those things which are in the past I now press to towards the mark the High Calling to the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity when Jesus comes now I want to go back and revisit because I never really touched on it maybe this was the moment you know what's wrong with these young men and these young women young women wanting to be men and young men wanting to be women and all the strange things that we see if we're not careful we judge them in the flesh went into an auto parts store young men in there had them big Lifesavers gauges in his ears and the first thing when I saw that I was like great that's the clerk I'm going to get but when he spoke something spoke to me sir how can I help you this total presentation respectful helpful something spoke to me and said if we're not careful would judge them external our young adults young people what I spoke to you downstairs today comes from that we can judge the external but down deep in there be a son of God I need to treat him like a son of God I need to that if life would bring our Crossroads again I wouldn't have to go oh my goodness this is the young man that I was so rude derogatory to the one I told him he looked like a and blah blah oh no sir treat them to the potential that when we meet them again we'll be able with a clear conscience address them you see what's happened I've said it many times I'll say it again Sister Sarah if you would come musicians scripture clearly shows us an age of an identity crisis people will fill the churches like never before but their identity of why they're there is in crisis this comes back several years ago we're on a little drive with my son down in Phoenix we drove by this place and I said oh my here is three I think three soccer fields two or three or four outdoor basketball courts two or three tennis courts couple baseball diamonds and I said wow that's a pretty fancy High School my son was like Dad that's a church [Music] and I was like wow [Music] in the Arizona Church Baseball Conference they've been champions for 12 years so if you're any good at baseball that's where you go to church [Music] got a sign up sheet for a baseball team we might be able to come up with half a team I don't know but is that why we go to church I'll tell you what we are in the Full Gospel of Jesus Christ we're on the starting and the winning team because you see our identity is not in the flesh my son went on to share a story how he knows several people that went to church there one of them was a young man well on his way to um going to play professional baseball when he got in an accident of some kind damaged his leg and crippled him up basically he said you wouldn't hardly know he's crippled but at the level you have to do to to play at that uh his for life it ended right there he's on salary at the church [Music] not as a youth pastor not as a minister not as a counselor but as a Sports Coordinator [Music] now I want you to do your own homework or if you know what did the prophet of God say would be a sign of the church in the end [Music] but got you all frowned in here we're having a good service and I just spoiled it what did the prophet of God say about the church in the end she would recognize who she is we're at the end Saints the bride is recognizing who she is amen let's just stand sing a song or two before we're dismissed amen I will praise him I will praise him I think it's 5
