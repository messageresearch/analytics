[33:04] oh
[33:05] jesus

[34:08] kingdoms will all
[34:11] pass away
[34:14] but there's something
[34:17] about
[34:18] [Music]
[34:26] i just want to put before you a prayer
[34:28] request that i forgot to share with
[34:31] brother jason
[34:33] um
[34:34] my
[34:35] daughter-in-law stephanie
[34:38] [Music]
[34:40] her sister's grandchild
[34:44] just a few weeks old passed away
[34:47] and i'd ask you
[34:50] just to remember the zimmerman family
[34:55] i don't say this judgmentally
[34:57] but they've been away from the lord for
[34:59] quite a quite a time
[35:01] just pray that the lord would just stir
[35:03] their hearts and they would just look
[35:05] back to him
[35:06] this time
[35:08] you know
[35:10] sister jerry and i was just visiting
[35:12] just a moment on this and
[35:14] certainly don't take this as some
[35:16] over-reaching thought but
[35:20] you know the scripture warns about in
[35:22] that day you know for those that would
[35:24] be with child
[35:26] you know you look at this and you just
[35:28] think
[35:29] lord your will
[35:31] you do all things perfect
[35:34] we know what the prophet said about
[35:36] these little children so we know this
[35:39] little guy is now in the presence of god
[35:42] and uh
[35:44] still heartbreaking
[35:46] just
[35:48] my daughter kristen always uses this
[35:50] word and
[35:51] just the cutest little guffer
[35:53] he was just a darling looking little boy
[35:57] just quit breathing
[35:59] and uh
[36:00] so
[36:02] remember the morales family
[36:04] well as far as that goes remember the
[36:06] joel haylett family
[36:08] the morales family the zimmerman family
[36:11] just
[36:12] look at the day we're living in saints
[36:14] and god's doing incredible things and i
[36:16] have a expectation that we will see
[36:19] above and beyond the miraculous we'll
[36:22] see above and beyond the supernatural
[36:24] and the reason i say that with
[36:26] confidence in my heart is because the
[36:28] word says so
[36:29] amen and that's that's what
[36:32] and uh
[36:33] so uh concerning
[36:36] the pastor or minister of appreciation
[36:40] let me just
[36:43] put it to you this way
[36:45] if you want to show
[36:47] appreciation to the ministry of grace
[36:49] tabernacle
[36:51] say amen to this
[36:54] every single day of your life say amen
[36:56] to this and
[36:58] that
[36:58] will be sufficient reward for the
[37:01] ministry of this church
[37:03] amen to know that sons and daughters of
[37:05] god responding claiming the word
[37:08] possessing it in its entirety not
[37:10] limiting it
[37:12] amen but letting it come in the full
[37:14] authority of the word of god in our hour
[37:17] that
[37:18] honestly saints is what stirs my heart
[37:21] amen
[37:22] i just want to share real quick just a a
[37:25] moment
[37:29] brother alex is
[37:31] working on kind of getting some things
[37:33] prepared on that so we can maybe share
[37:35] something on the screen but just want to
[37:37] share with you
[37:38] that um
[37:40] brother alex sister
[37:41] julia's
[37:43] dad brother sergey senior as i re
[37:45] reference him
[37:47] uh has uh we've been talking a little
[37:50] bit and he just sharing with me the
[37:52] wonderful reports of the saints in the
[37:55] ukraine
[37:56] of the support that you gave
[37:58] uh many of them to be able to attend
[38:01] these meetings to be able to take their
[38:03] children to be able to have an
[38:05] experience of gathering together with
[38:08] saints of like precious faith
[38:10] and you
[38:12] i believe i can speak this with complete
[38:14] confidence you know as well as i do the
[38:16] refreshing it is to be with saints of
[38:18] like precious faith amen
[38:21] you can just as it were the old phrase i
[38:23] don't know where it come from but we can
[38:25] just let our hair down and we can just
[38:27] be ourself and we can worship the lord
[38:29] and just enter in and so um
[38:32] as brother alex has time he's been a
[38:34] little busy but we'll we'll get this and
[38:36] share this uh here soon uh but to just
[38:39] say thank you from the saints uh there
[38:42] for your support for them to be able to
[38:44] be a part of the meetings and we did
[38:47] such a small portion
[38:49] but sometimes my brother and sister god
[38:51] just blesses things in such a fashion
[38:54] that just a few dollars
[38:56] goes and and it has an effect
[38:58] uh you know just brings about things in
[39:01] the lives of believers and
[39:03] and we know it's never been about the
[39:04] money right
[39:06] it's not our money in the beginning
[39:08] people get so
[39:09] so caught up in this deal about well
[39:12] what i did and what i had to do and i
[39:14] sacrificed and it wasn't yours in the
[39:16] beginning
[39:17] amen the scripture tells us that all
[39:20] good gifts
[39:22] come from him
[39:23] the giver of gifts amen the giver of
[39:26] life and
[39:27] so we just are thankful to be a part of
[39:30] a body of believers amen around the
[39:32] world and to just give our little bit of
[39:35] support here and there amen let's just
[39:38] stand as we go into the word today i
[39:40] want to speak to you on the topic or the
[39:43] title this morning of this present light
[39:47] and uh i think that one of the things
[39:49] that has happened in the world that we
[39:51] live in is uh i think we still um now
[39:55] i'm not trying to overreach here and say
[39:58] this is everyone or every situation but
[40:01] i think sometimes we still have a
[40:04] innate uh
[40:07] connection to look back at what god has
[40:10] done
[40:11] we we look back and somebody say well
[40:13] you know i remember when when i was this
[40:16] old god did this for me i'll tell you
[40:18] what i'm interested in saints i'm
[40:20] interested to know what god's doing for
[40:22] you right now
[40:23] amen let's not be a people looking back
[40:26] because if we're careful we end up
[40:27] looking back over what god had done for
[40:29] us and egypt's in the background
[40:33] now this is just an opinion and and i
[40:35] hope i don't offend anybody by voicing
[40:37] it but one thing that i have never liked
[40:40] is to hear believers talk about what a
[40:43] drunk they were and what of this they
[40:44] were and what of that they were i'm
[40:46] sorry that was back in egypt
[40:49] hallelujah god calls out of egypt amen
[40:52] the call through goshen
[40:56] was not
[40:57] hey
[40:58] remember what you did
[41:00] in egypt
[41:02] the call that went through goat motion
[41:04] that night that day was apply the token
[41:08] put the blood over the door when the
[41:10] death angel comes you don't have to fret
[41:12] you don't have to worry you don't have
[41:14] to wait up all night ringing your hands
[41:17] what will happen but you have confidence
[41:20] and you stand upon that and so therefore
[41:22] what i have come i have come to
[41:24] vindicate to you the promised word that
[41:27] is in your future that it's within your
[41:29] grasp and you need to put your eyes on
[41:32] that and don't look back i was such a
[41:33] drunk i was a fighter i was this i've
[41:36] heard people go on for
[41:38] 15 20 minutes 30 minutes talking about
[41:41] what they was
[41:42] and then when it come to and then god
[41:44] saved me
[41:45] done
[41:48] oh let's look forward
[41:50] let's look forward saints there's
[41:52] nothing for us left back here
[41:55] amen now look i i'll just quantify this
[41:58] maybe i say this in my own defense okay
[42:02] some people are just
[42:04] so overly motivated that that's one of
[42:06] the challenges they have in life so
[42:08] overly pushed
[42:11] could you relate to that
[42:14] some people are like oh my challenge is
[42:16] this my challenge that some of us are
[42:18] challenges as we lose like we like to go
[42:20] out we put a shovel in our hands do this
[42:22] do that we like to do this oh here's an
[42:24] opportunity let's approach it
[42:27] but you see my brother and sister it's
[42:30] just gonna burn
[42:33] now god's not gonna say oh i'm just
[42:34] gonna wipe the nature that i put in you
[42:36] out but i'll tell you what he'll do
[42:38] he'll control that nature
[42:40] he'll bring that nature subject to the
[42:43] word
[42:44] and so don't cry about who you are
[42:48] just yield to the holy spirit let him
[42:50] use you for the purpose that he set you
[42:52] here for
[42:54] hallelujah this present light amen let's
[42:57] just turn in our bibles to the
[42:58] incredible scripture
[43:00] uh that i just love as much as i wrote
[43:03] love revelations 19 i love john 1 1.
[43:07] amen
[43:08] you see this scripture here in john 1 1
[43:13] amen is such my brother and sister that
[43:16] it gives clarity or in the topic that is
[43:19] very prevalent in this scripture it
[43:21] gives light
[43:22] to the whole deity of jesus christ
[43:25] amen it gives light to the whole uh
[43:28] hierarchy of heaven and earth if you
[43:31] would use that term to set everything in
[43:33] its proper order now my brother and
[43:36] sister brother branham in talking about
[43:38] uh these things talking about the
[43:41] godhead uh you know he says now
[43:44] over here we have the trinity and over
[43:46] here we have uh
[43:48] jesus only but brother brown says it's
[43:50] right here in the middle is where we
[43:53] find this how that god chose to express
[43:55] himself
[43:58] in this beautiful when you realize how
[44:00] god chose to express himself
[44:03] is actually if you'll stop and look deep
[44:06] enough is a perfect reflection of who
[44:08] you
[44:09] you are
[44:12] so if someone's out of the reflection of
[44:14] the word
[44:15] then they're actually out of the word
[44:19] in the beginning was the word
[44:22] and the word was with god and the word
[44:25] was god
[44:26] now my brother and sister there are
[44:28] people around the message
[44:31] that
[44:32] kind of have this idea that you've
[44:34] gotta put this in a context but i hope
[44:38] you don't misunderstand me i'm gonna say
[44:39] it this morning and and you digest and
[44:41] if you don't like how i said it then you
[44:43] just pray over it before you come and
[44:45] chew on me
[44:47] in the beginning was the word and the
[44:48] word was with jesus
[44:51] and the word
[44:52] was jesus
[44:55] do we have an argument with that
[44:57] no sir we don't why
[44:59] one the prophet brought a clarity to us
[45:02] that they are one and the same
[45:08] but we have to put this in the right
[45:10] context
[45:12] or we have
[45:14] jesus
[45:16] speaking to himself
[45:19] and then it gets confusing
[45:26] the scripture says
[45:29] christ
[45:31] in you
[45:33] the prophet puts it many many times
[45:36] god in you
[45:38] god in us
[45:39] god is in his word and his word is in
[45:41] you so therefore god is in
[45:44] you so when you pray are you praying to
[45:47] yourself
[45:51] no sir
[45:53] see god puts everything in a perfect
[45:56] order
[45:59] and the same was in the beginning with
[46:01] god and all things were made by him and
[46:04] wait the scripture says that all things
[46:06] were made
[46:08] by jesus christ
[46:10] you see how we've got to get the right
[46:12] balance or else suddenly we have
[46:15] something so confusing
[46:17] that we don't know what to do with it so
[46:18] therefore we default to what we think
[46:21] and we'll talk on that in a moment
[46:24] the same was in the beginning with god
[46:25] and all things were made by him without
[46:27] him was not anything made that was made
[46:30] in him was life
[46:32] you will not find any where else in
[46:35] scripture
[46:37] that defines life
[46:39] is clearly
[46:41] that's verse 4
[46:43] in him
[46:46] not next to him not behind him not in
[46:47] front of him not coming soon
[46:50] in him was life
[46:53] and the life was the light of men and
[46:55] the light shineth in darkness and the
[46:57] darkness comprehended it not
[46:59] there was a man sent from god whose name
[47:02] was john the same came for a witness to
[47:04] bear witness of the light that all men
[47:07] through him might believe he was not
[47:10] that light but was sent to bear witness
[47:12] of that line do you realize my brother
[47:14] and sister that you should be able to
[47:16] find your own personal identity right
[47:18] here in verse 8.
[47:19] amen
[47:21] that was the true light which lighteth
[47:23] every man that cometh and to the world
[47:26] he was in the world
[47:27] and the world was made by him and the
[47:30] world knew him not
[47:33] he came into his own and his own
[47:34] received him not
[47:36] now my brother and sister you have to
[47:38] understand this in this context
[47:41] different theologians interpret things
[47:43] differently different people but you see
[47:45] he came into his own
[47:47] this would be a heritage
[47:50] this would be a legacy
[47:53] this would not be
[47:54] his own as in a bride
[48:02] think about it
[48:05] as it were
[48:06] his own auntie
[48:08] and uncle
[48:10] his own cousins thinking about it in a
[48:13] normal worldly fashion
[48:15] a grandma grandpa
[48:18] none of them recognized him
[48:22] he come
[48:24] through the perfect lineage
[48:27] because god doesn't break
[48:29] he he has continuity god doesn't break
[48:32] continuity
[48:33] so he actually come and
[48:35] could have claimed a rightful position
[48:37] as a priest
[48:39] except for that terrible little mar
[48:42] upon his life
[48:44] of what all they could see was
[48:46] um joseph mary issue question mark
[48:50] exclamation
[48:51] all of this
[48:53] but through the lineage he could have
[48:55] come
[48:57] and claimed a position in priesthood
[48:59] because you see god won't break that
[49:01] continuity
[49:07] but as many as received him to them gave
[49:10] he power to become the sons of god
[49:12] even to them that believe on his name
[49:15] which were born
[49:17] not of blood
[49:18] nor of the will of flesh nor of the will
[49:20] of man but of god
[49:23] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[49:25] among us and we beheld his glory the
[49:27] glory as of the only begotten of the
[49:30] father full of grace and truth
[49:34] heavenly father we thank you for your
[49:36] word how beautiful it is
[49:38] how lovely father to be able to look and
[49:41] lord the revelation that you gave to
[49:44] john in that day
[49:45] lord the vision that he had a revelation
[49:48] that was brought to him to lay the words
[49:51] out so carefully father your words
[49:54] father that we could stand here in this
[49:56] day right now
[49:57] and look at that and be perfectly
[49:59] identified
[50:01] lord what a privilege it is to serve you
[50:03] what a privilege to stand and father i'd
[50:06] pray today as every heart would be
[50:08] lifted
[50:09] father may we just reach out to you and
[50:12] lord just accept your
[50:14] lives and have confidence to press
[50:17] forward to the mark of the high calling
[50:19] in christ jesus
[50:20] bless your saints today lord the prayer
[50:22] requests the needs those that would not
[50:24] be with us today lord may your hand of
[50:26] mercy be upon each one
[50:29] lord we thank you in your name amen
[50:32] hallelujah saints you may be seated
[50:44] i
[50:45] wrote it down but i don't know what i
[50:47] did with it
[50:49] which is the same as not having it
[50:50] written down at all
[50:52] but um there is a sister quite a
[50:55] testimony that comes with it but there's
[50:57] a sister down
[50:59] california i think um
[51:01] brother prashant's sister koncha either
[51:04] are meeting with her or have already met
[51:07] with her and
[51:08] so let's just pray and my i wished i
[51:10] could remember that name
[51:12] uh
[51:13] my
[51:15] um but anyway uh just a a miraculous
[51:18] incredible story
[51:20] that goes with this sister's life and uh
[51:22] uh
[51:24] at this point right now to just receive
[51:26] the word of god and uh act upon it
[51:29] quickly when it struck her heart saint
[51:31] she got in the car there was a
[51:33] connection there but she got in a car
[51:35] drove all the way to oregon
[51:39] be baptized in the name of the lord
[51:40] jesus christ
[51:42] you know what that's what we're looking
[51:44] for in this hour not a hey someday i'll
[51:46] get to it or if it's convenient for me
[51:49] but this is something i need to do right
[51:51] now and i actually pray the spirit of
[51:52] the lord would come upon this church
[51:54] that we would behave and act upon the
[51:56] word of god in such fashion that when we
[51:58] would see it in the word lord i just
[52:00] want to be obedient to the word and i'm
[52:02] not going to say lord now if it's
[52:04] convenient i'm going to say lord this is
[52:06] a matter of life and death and i will
[52:08] act upon that so just remember the
[52:10] unnamed sister that i'm sorry i i wrote
[52:13] that down and i know that paper is on my
[52:15] desk and don't judge me for my desk
[52:17] because i can show you where research
[52:19] says that um typical brilliant people's
[52:22] deaths are messy
[52:24] so um anyway
[52:29] verse 4
[52:30] it said in him was life and the life was
[52:33] the light of men now my brother and
[52:36] sister the only life that really matters
[52:38] to you and i is the original life as the
[52:40] prophet of god preached it we are not
[52:42] looking for life now my brother and
[52:44] sister the the spirit that satan would
[52:47] come and we'll talk about the these
[52:49] counterfeit and whatever in just a
[52:50] minute but you'll find see that satan
[52:53] has come and he has placed in the mind
[52:56] of the people now if you'll study this
[52:58] out you'll find brother branham said
[53:00] that the catholic church was the
[53:02] original apostolic pentecostal church in
[53:06] the first age but within 300 years they
[53:09] had injected traditions and ideas and
[53:13] all of these things that the church did
[53:15] not even resemble the original church
[53:18] now my brother and sister i know it's
[53:20] hard for us to grasp now the catholic
[53:22] church was that well yes it was my
[53:24] brother and sister they heard the word
[53:26] they rallied around the word but then
[53:30] some come and said you know wouldn't it
[53:31] be nice say if our if our if our
[53:34] ministers our priests uh
[53:36] what wouldn't it be nice if we dress
[53:38] them up kind of an honor amen that's why
[53:40] i tell you my brother and sister from my
[53:42] studies here while i make this statement
[53:44] to you this morning you want to give all
[53:46] honor to brother paul don't give him
[53:47] some big robe with a velvet collar and
[53:50] gold buttons and whatever say amen to
[53:52] this word of god that's what god
[53:54] intended not to give honor to create
[53:56] some kind of a ceremony and pump and to
[53:59] give a nice house and a comfortable
[54:01] living and as it were maids and serpents
[54:04] oh that's how we're on no you honor god
[54:06] brother and sister by saying amen and
[54:09] acting upon his word amen but through
[54:11] those ages through that time there they
[54:14] started they injected a little bit of
[54:16] the something here and they added a
[54:18] little something here and sometimes a
[54:21] preaching of the word now i'm not gonna
[54:23] i'm gonna use the word offensive but i
[54:25] hope you understand what i'm saying
[54:27] sometimes uh the preaching of the word
[54:29] can uh kind of bring an offense to us it
[54:32] faces us with our own issues and our own
[54:34] needs and and sometimes that's just hard
[54:37] have you ever have to sit in church and
[54:39] say ouch
[54:40] amen i tell you if we're not i ain't
[54:42] preaching hard enough
[54:45] but instead what we did is we explained
[54:48] it
[54:51] we watered it down a little bit enough
[54:53] and we gave the people an option to come
[54:56] in such a fashion
[54:58] that they would be able to say yes i
[55:00] identify with this i am good with this
[55:03] and my brother and sister that be there
[55:05] you know okay uh this is what i'm doing
[55:08] i'm gonna take a wafer and we're gonna
[55:10] declare this wafer is the body of
[55:12] christ's literal body we're gonna claim
[55:14] that this wine or grape juice is a
[55:17] literal blood so therefore it's uh
[55:19] pretty much unoffensive to anything but
[55:22] a true believer
[55:25] because a true believer gets offended at
[55:27] water downward
[55:30] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[55:31] people are like well you know we just
[55:33] never felt led to leave this group or
[55:35] leave this thing that was happening my
[55:37] brother and sister when it is nothing
[55:39] but watered down putrid that served to
[55:42] the people and people can sit there for
[55:45] year after year and to hear that and say
[55:47] oh no that doesn't apply to me i'm a
[55:49] real believer i'm telling you my brother
[55:51] and sister the filth the putridness of
[55:54] this world will make a son or daughter
[55:56] of god sick now the prophet of god said
[55:58] you don't have a church to go to you go
[56:01] find a holy ghost-filled church and you
[56:04] take what you can from that one that's
[56:06] anointed
[56:08] not one that's compromised
[56:11] there's quite a bit of difference my
[56:12] brother and sister
[56:17] so the original life the only place that
[56:19] we can find leadership
[56:22] see there's no leadership my brother and
[56:24] sister you know even the catholic church
[56:25] has some things i like to listen to
[56:28] catholic answers live have any ever
[56:29] heard of that amen hope you all look at
[56:31] me like brother paul's on the way out
[56:34] no sir it's good i want to know my enemy
[56:37] but the enemy is not the people that's
[56:39] there it's the spirit behind it
[56:41] now i think i've shared this in the
[56:43] church here where this young man calls
[56:44] and he says you know i'm working here at
[56:46] this company and one of my co-workers uh
[56:49] you know we talked about god i said i
[56:51] and i enjoy it but he's talking about
[56:53] these things and the way he described it
[56:55] i thought man he might be talking to a
[56:57] message believer because the the
[56:59] questions and the things that's being
[57:00] discussed and and you know he said now i
[57:04] i see what he's saying and he never
[57:06] gives you know his own thought he always
[57:08] takes me back in the bible and so i'm
[57:10] calling you to to find what is this and
[57:12] so then this priest guy that's on there
[57:15] he just goes into this long-winded
[57:16] discussion and going about this and how
[57:19] is pope gregory and this one over here
[57:21] and this here and that there and he gets
[57:23] all done with about a 15-minute
[57:25] discourse and then their silence and he
[57:27] says well well did that help you and
[57:29] then you hear a voice come not a voice
[57:31] that's whining or whimpery but a voice
[57:33] with some confidence you didn't answer
[57:37] my
[57:38] question well we have to go on to
[57:41] another caller
[57:45] you see my brother and sister god will
[57:46] find that seed no matter where that seed
[57:48] is at and the original life is the only
[57:51] thing that will stir an original seed
[57:54] amen we cannot settle on a compromised
[57:56] word amen aren't you glad of that amen
[57:59] that we could see so the original life's
[58:01] the only place we find leadership amen
[58:04] now we live in an age of the great
[58:06] impersonation
[58:07] now i know some of you gonna look at me
[58:09] real funny amen but when i study things
[58:11] i like to take a good broad view of it
[58:13] remember because the world out here they
[58:15] don't know any different it's the reason
[58:17] you see different is because the grace
[58:20] of god has come down and shown upon you
[58:23] amen otherwise we would be them
[58:27] and if it was intelligence and talent
[58:29] and sincerity they may be you
[58:32] if that was the measure but it's not the
[58:34] measure it's god
[58:38] who calls
[58:41] so you look at this we live in the age
[58:43] of great impersonation you know it's
[58:45] pretty interesting i listened to this
[58:46] deal sometime back not just recently
[58:49] so if you felt like i needed to repent
[58:50] from this i already have
[58:52] but look at this my brother and sister
[58:54] men that can sing like elvis so well
[58:58] that the music authorities when they
[59:00] hear recording of it think it is elvis
[59:06] great impersonation
[59:08] the guy who has had plastic surgery
[59:11] puffed up his cheeks so he looks like a
[59:13] well anyway we won't go there
[59:16] but you see
[59:17] the impersonation
[59:19] is more perfect
[59:21] than the original
[59:24] so much so that people are deceived by
[59:25] it are you with me
[59:28] so you see in the age of the great
[59:30] impersonation my brother and sister i
[59:33] want you to understand we'll take this
[59:34] into the natural just a little bit so
[59:36] you can really but in the age of the
[59:38] great impersonation the scripture says
[59:40] that it would be so close it would
[59:41] deceive the very elect and let's just i
[59:44] know i'm just stirring up the pot right
[59:45] i'm just fulfilling that uh portion as a
[59:48] good minister just to stir up your pure
[59:50] minds okay i'm not trying to come up
[59:52] with something new dig some other
[59:53] message you never saw before so you all
[59:56] go home all startled brother brother
[59:58] paul just dug out a nugget we've never
[1:00:00] found it my brother and sister those
[1:00:01] nuggets are there there's little things
[1:00:03] that come out but amen i'm not looking
[1:00:05] for some sensationalism of a new nugget
[1:00:08] amen i want to live the word that has
[1:00:10] already been revealed and already been
[1:00:12] made known to us and so we live in this
[1:00:15] age of the the great impersonation i'll
[1:00:18] just throw this out it wasn't my
[1:00:19] original thought but you see my brother
[1:00:21] and sister i don't know uh some of these
[1:00:24] backgrounds i can't really say um our
[1:00:26] family uh catholic and mormon lds and so
[1:00:29] those coming together my parents
[1:00:31] deciding we won't don't want to be
[1:00:33] neither of those so they started out as
[1:00:34] nazarene moved from nazarene into the
[1:00:37] methodist world amen come to the message
[1:00:39] from that so you look at this my brother
[1:00:41] and sister that it is not really uh uh
[1:00:44] relevant as it were uh that um uh the
[1:00:48] time that we're at and say well you know
[1:00:50] what i think it might be uh the catholic
[1:00:53] church that will deceive us it might be
[1:00:54] the baptist church that will deceive us
[1:00:56] it might be nazarenes
[1:00:58] it could be the ldfs i'm sorry it's much
[1:01:00] closer to home than that
[1:01:02] amen let's not let's not get caught up
[1:01:04] thinking that something out there is
[1:01:06] going to come in and deceive you it will
[1:01:08] be so close to deceive the very elect
[1:01:11] that means that even you saints will be
[1:01:14] tested to the degree that you wouldn't
[1:01:17] know the difference of the right and the
[1:01:18] wrong the moving of the spirit the
[1:01:20] anointing the action that would all come
[1:01:23] but i tell you what we have and i'm
[1:01:25] sorry i was thinking about this actually
[1:01:26] kind of crying to the lord why me but
[1:01:29] look my brother and sister just defeat
[1:01:30] this it's back to the word that's the
[1:01:32] only way don't be thinking i'm such a
[1:01:34] good christian i can't be deceived no my
[1:01:36] brother and sister it will be the
[1:01:38] anointing on you to always go back to
[1:01:41] the word that will be what you cannot be
[1:01:43] deceived if you're in the word amen if
[1:01:46] we go by any form of just action that we
[1:01:49] see we go by any form of anointing that
[1:01:52] we see we go by any kind of a great
[1:01:55] spiritual move or actions or falling of
[1:01:58] the spirit you'll be deceived but when
[1:02:00] you take a right back to that original
[1:02:02] word the original life amen and you said
[1:02:05] under that because remember the prophet
[1:02:06] of god preaches about this you can
[1:02:10] be either a rugged flower
[1:02:13] or a hot house flower
[1:02:17] the hot house flower
[1:02:18] has to be preached to in such a way that
[1:02:20] you're the bride and you're making a
[1:02:22] rapture you're the bride you're making a
[1:02:23] rapture you're the bride you're chosen
[1:02:25] you're special you're making a rapture
[1:02:27] but i'll tell you what that flower
[1:02:28] outside
[1:02:30] it gets a little chilly
[1:02:32] it gets beat by the wind
[1:02:34] it has to sit out there when the north
[1:02:37] wind is coming down and rain is pelting
[1:02:39] behind it it gets knocked here and
[1:02:41] knocked there and you might even go out
[1:02:43] in the morning and find it all leaned
[1:02:45] over we've had days like that haven't we
[1:02:47] amen i call it monday
[1:02:52] but you see we're not hot house plants
[1:02:55] so we're living in the age of the great
[1:02:57] impersonation at a time when the
[1:03:00] original can be reproduced
[1:03:04] now think about that two-edged statement
[1:03:07] the original can be reproduced
[1:03:09] we said right here we've got families
[1:03:11] we've got children amen the original can
[1:03:14] be
[1:03:15] reproduced
[1:03:17] are you with me
[1:03:18] hallelujah we all have to stop and say
[1:03:20] oh lord we've received a message in the
[1:03:22] hours late our children can be lost to
[1:03:24] the spirit of laodicea oh no no no sorry
[1:03:27] the original can be reproduced
[1:03:29] amen but look at this also that satan
[1:03:31] comes in and he can take the original
[1:03:34] and he can recreate something that is so
[1:03:37] close to the original amen that is so so
[1:03:40] i like it in each and every fashion amen
[1:03:45] and you see what it is when one
[1:03:47] reproduces the original
[1:03:50] you can reproduce it
[1:03:53] at such a lower cost
[1:03:57] that actually people don't want the
[1:03:58] original because they have to pay more
[1:04:01] for it
[1:04:03] you see what happens my brother and
[1:04:04] sister
[1:04:07] you go to the store
[1:04:10] i tell you i was very very discouraged
[1:04:13] here recently i went to the store i
[1:04:14] wanted to buy i knew these these tools
[1:04:17] were out there i knew their original
[1:04:18] good solid tools last a man the rest of
[1:04:21] his lifetime using them or there but i
[1:04:23] went to a certain local store to buy a
[1:04:25] tool similar that and everything there
[1:04:27] was made in well you know that place
[1:04:31] the place where almost everything's made
[1:04:35] and it was funny because i read a review
[1:04:37] and the guy says these things are so
[1:04:38] cheap i broke it getting it out of the
[1:04:40] package
[1:04:45] but you know why it's not in the local
[1:04:47] store
[1:04:48] because the original
[1:04:50] cost about seven times as much
[1:04:59] natural types what
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:03] we can reproduce this
[1:05:06] at a lower cost
[1:05:08] we want to be a church that we want to
[1:05:10] be big we want to be this we want to be
[1:05:12] that and we can fill this church out i
[1:05:15] joked about it a long time ago about
[1:05:16] being sent at that church building
[1:05:18] program amen they'll refund your money
[1:05:20] if it don't work they're pretty
[1:05:21] confident my brother and sister but you
[1:05:23] see the original has a cost
[1:05:27] the reproduction doesn't cost as much
[1:05:31] so therefore it's easier to offer the
[1:05:34] reproduction at a lower cost you don't
[1:05:37] have to give up this and you don't have
[1:05:39] to give up that you don't have to give
[1:05:41] up your nightlife you don't have to give
[1:05:42] up your jokes in your club and you're
[1:05:45] this and that and you can still be a
[1:05:48] christian quite a bit lower cost
[1:05:52] oh brother paul that's just horrible but
[1:05:54] i tell you what it is my brother and
[1:05:56] sister i don't really even think the
[1:05:58] club and the dancing drinking and all
[1:06:00] that garbage is the issue
[1:06:02] i think the greatest cost that people
[1:06:05] don't want to give up
[1:06:07] itself
[1:06:11] this is who i am and i like who i am and
[1:06:13] i don't want anybody telling me i have
[1:06:15] to change i can be a christian and be me
[1:06:18] and i can say amen to that but you've
[1:06:20] got to understand the original life
[1:06:22] shining on the original seed will
[1:06:24] produce the original word amen you can't
[1:06:27] shine the original light on a
[1:06:29] counterfeit seed or you can't shine
[1:06:31] counterfeit light on an original seed
[1:06:34] and get any kind of results and people
[1:06:36] are happy my brother and sister to sit
[1:06:39] and be a part of the word of god for the
[1:06:42] hour without paying a price
[1:06:48] and i could just bombard you with like
[1:06:50] probably about 50 quotes my brother and
[1:06:52] sister
[1:06:53] but you look at this and realize that
[1:06:55] what is happening we're living in the
[1:06:57] age of the great impersonation
[1:07:00] amen so
[1:07:02] when something can be given to someone
[1:07:04] at a fraction of the cost
[1:07:07] it would be considered counterfeit
[1:07:11] and counterfeit my brother and sister
[1:07:13] the prophet of god says you know this
[1:07:14] i'm just stirring up your pure minds i
[1:07:16] hope you leave today just invigorated
[1:07:18] from your mind being stirred
[1:07:20] the prophet of god says wherever you
[1:07:22] find the counterfeit
[1:07:24] there has to be an original
[1:07:26] hallelujah i believe that we as a church
[1:07:28] my brother and sister not because i
[1:07:30] think we're all special and perfect but
[1:07:32] i believe we as a church because of our
[1:07:33] desire for the word can look out and say
[1:07:36] praise the lord i am not a counterfeit
[1:07:39] nor do i want to be a counterfeit i'm
[1:07:41] willing to be what god wants me to be at
[1:07:45] whatever cost it costs me to be that
[1:07:48] amen because if we settle for something
[1:07:51] that's lackadaisical lackluster
[1:07:53] something that's just half-hearted if we
[1:07:55] settle for having our old temper our own
[1:07:58] nature our own bitterness or whatever it
[1:08:00] is and say well i'm justified for that
[1:08:03] this person did this it's not my fault i
[1:08:06] mean
[1:08:07] it's your fault you didn't repent from
[1:08:09] being angry it's your fault for not
[1:08:12] accepting the original that god has
[1:08:14] given oh i won't go on on your this was
[1:08:16] a happy service
[1:08:18] amen but you see don't go blame it on
[1:08:20] somebody else because you were unwilling
[1:08:22] to pay the price to be what god called
[1:08:25] you to be
[1:08:26] amen now look the counterfeit is
[1:08:29] inferior but it's still embraced by the
[1:08:31] people
[1:08:32] i saw a little little deal i think jerry
[1:08:34] shared it with me the other day and that
[1:08:37] is if you buy stuff made in the usa it
[1:08:39] wouldn't be stuck on a ship offshore
[1:08:44] think about that in the natural sense
[1:08:46] but i want you to think about that in
[1:08:48] the spiritual sense the holy ghost god
[1:08:50] himself said i'll be with you even in
[1:08:53] you and so you're not going to have to
[1:08:55] sit around and say where's god at and
[1:08:57] wait wait and wait if you know that god
[1:08:59] is with you and in you that means he's
[1:09:02] not off short somewhere that means he's
[1:09:04] right here not even just in grace
[1:09:06] tabernacle but in you
[1:09:09] hallelujah some people struggle with
[1:09:11] that idea amen
[1:09:12] but look at that if it's there you know
[1:09:15] now my brother and sister because it is
[1:09:18] counterfeit because it is inferior
[1:09:21] it won't last
[1:09:24] it won't last
[1:09:26] i want to remind you
[1:09:27] it won't last if someone offers you an
[1:09:31] easier version
[1:09:33] of the message
[1:09:35] it won't last
[1:09:38] this message is built upon the sacrifice
[1:09:42] of our lord jesus christ for the
[1:09:44] remission of our sin amen
[1:09:46] but it is also built upon the sacrifice
[1:09:49] of our self-will to the will of god
[1:09:53] the sacrifice of our own opinion our own
[1:09:56] mind our own behaviors to the word of
[1:09:59] god oh brother paul that sounds hard it
[1:10:02] sounds hard no it's not just make up
[1:10:04] your mind
[1:10:06] just make up your mind say lord i'll
[1:10:07] serve you whatever it cost
[1:10:10] now look
[1:10:12] look how the counterfeit is so embraced
[1:10:14] by the people
[1:10:18] i won't name the artist
[1:10:21] give no glory to them
[1:10:23] but when you see someone half dressed
[1:10:28] big dangling earrings that'll tell you
[1:10:30] the gender right there well maybe it
[1:10:32] won't this day
[1:10:36] after us big dangling earrings
[1:10:38] with emotion
[1:10:40] singing
[1:10:42] amazing grace
[1:10:45] now brother paul you're you're getting
[1:10:47] judgmental
[1:10:57] when you see
[1:10:59] this same person
[1:11:01] dressed in different attire but still
[1:11:02] totally unbecoming
[1:11:05] of a godly christian woman
[1:11:07] singing how great
[1:11:09] thou art
[1:11:12] my brother and sister
[1:11:14] this is satan's counterfeit
[1:11:17] offer
[1:11:18] for the real thing
[1:11:23] taking words
[1:11:25] and making substance out of words
[1:11:29] well we all do that that's what the
[1:11:30] preacher does
[1:11:34] abraham lincoln's great speech
[1:11:38] would qualify under the same thing
[1:11:40] but you see
[1:11:42] for that to be a real substance
[1:11:45] there has to be a foundation underneath
[1:11:47] it
[1:11:49] and so for a life that doesn't line up
[1:11:51] with the word saying oh lord you're
[1:11:53] great that's beautiful he is
[1:11:56] how great thou art but you see the
[1:11:58] effect of the word
[1:12:00] has not changed the individual
[1:12:02] there wasn't any life in that word to
[1:12:04] change the individual so therefore my
[1:12:06] brother and sister if it's just words
[1:12:09] and through anointing that comes with
[1:12:11] the writing of those songs that is
[1:12:13] counterfeit
[1:12:15] because it's counterfeit to the
[1:12:17] anointing of the original writer
[1:12:19] of the song
[1:12:21] are you with me
[1:12:23] see so
[1:12:25] just because it's counterfeit doesn't
[1:12:26] mean it won't be embraced by the people
[1:12:28] i just received a bit of mail
[1:12:30] i'll just share this with you
[1:12:33] a bit of mail encouraging inviting in a
[1:12:36] certain salesman type fashion coaxing
[1:12:40] for me to sign the young people of our
[1:12:42] church to go to this leadership
[1:12:44] conference a beautiful pamphlet there
[1:12:46] beautiful little book that they sent me
[1:12:48] and when it comes to the very back page
[1:12:50] they're talking about how we're going to
[1:12:51] make disciples out of them and we're
[1:12:53] going to teach them leadership and we're
[1:12:55] going to give them confidence and on the
[1:12:56] very back page as though this would
[1:12:59] attract us saints it shows a whole group
[1:13:01] of people at the beach in bikinis in
[1:13:04] sweden and hugging on each other and
[1:13:06] this was a youth leadership
[1:13:10] no my brother and sister you see that's
[1:13:11] a representation of a counterfeit
[1:13:14] am i offending anyone
[1:13:16] as a representation of a counterfeit
[1:13:18] approach of what it is to be a christian
[1:13:21] young people i want to tell you today
[1:13:24] god wants you to have fun god wants you
[1:13:26] to enjoy your life god wants you to be
[1:13:28] full of laughter and joy and and be able
[1:13:30] to sing and shout and jump and run and
[1:13:32] do all these things my brother and
[1:13:34] sister but he didn't say because i want
[1:13:36] you to be happy and your heart filled
[1:13:38] with joy i'm gonna throw this away
[1:13:40] he said no you can be all those things
[1:13:44] and
[1:13:45] live this
[1:13:49] what is it
[1:13:50] an offering
[1:13:51] of a counterfeit
[1:13:55] but you see
[1:13:58] it doesn't cost much
[1:14:03] come on saints
[1:14:07] this might not mean much to you there'll
[1:14:09] be brothers here that it means something
[1:14:13] black and decker sold out
[1:14:17] to what
[1:14:19] chinese
[1:14:22] go down to the store here and compare
[1:14:23] the price of a blackened
[1:14:27] to decker
[1:14:27] metabo
[1:14:30] most people will walk out
[1:14:33] with a blackened decker
[1:14:40] but if you want something that'll last a
[1:14:42] lifetime
[1:14:44] you'll buy the metal
[1:14:47] now some of you might be buying chinese
[1:14:49] tools i'm not preaching at you amen this
[1:14:51] is a type
[1:14:52] this is a type
[1:14:54] amen
[1:14:58] i see a bunch of brothers going home now
[1:15:00] they believe brother paul so much just
[1:15:02] out there in their trash can just
[1:15:03] throwing these cheap tools in there
[1:15:06] yeah
[1:15:07] praise the lord we all we all approach
[1:15:09] in a different fashion amen i'm just
[1:15:12] making a type to you
[1:15:14] hallelujah you want a saw that breaks
[1:15:16] you can take it back to the dealer sit
[1:15:18] on the counter and they'll say we'll
[1:15:19] take care of this for you sir or do you
[1:15:22] want to have to put your tool in a box
[1:15:25] and mail it off to post office box 10
[1:15:29] 232
[1:15:32] never to be seen again
[1:15:38] because those always say it was your
[1:15:41] fault
[1:15:43] but when you busted metabo you know what
[1:15:44] they tell you
[1:15:46] yes it was your fault but we had grace
[1:15:48] and mercy on you and we fixed it for
[1:15:50] free
[1:15:54] are you with me
[1:15:55] hallelujah i hope you don't mind that
[1:15:57] i'm happy this morning
[1:15:59] amen
[1:16:01] you see
[1:16:03] the same as the route the same as the
[1:16:06] original my mom and the sister so that
[1:16:08] has to be original right
[1:16:10] the substitute will never cost as much
[1:16:12] see now verse 5 says the light shineth
[1:16:14] in darkness and darkness comprehended it
[1:16:16] not
[1:16:17] see the light was called to be on
[1:16:19] display right the scripture tells us we
[1:16:21] don't hide it under a bushel amen uh
[1:16:24] brother branham just i was
[1:16:26] listening to him uh you know he said uh
[1:16:29] uh if you were ashamed he's counting the
[1:16:31] scripture if you're ashamed of him he'll
[1:16:33] be ashamed of you and you know you can
[1:16:35] take that now sometimes modern theology
[1:16:37] and the way they word things uh uh
[1:16:40] uh
[1:16:42] is encouraging it helps you and if
[1:16:44] you're ashamed of him in other words if
[1:16:46] you i don't want to be identified in him
[1:16:49] right this is how some new modern
[1:16:51] translation said you're ashamed of him
[1:16:53] you don't want to be identified in him
[1:16:57] and he says you don't want to be
[1:16:59] identified in me i won't be identified
[1:17:01] in you
[1:17:03] see so it's nice you know different
[1:17:04] translation but it it it it fits you
[1:17:07] know so what is it my brother and sister
[1:17:11] the spirit of the day
[1:17:13] wants to be identified in name only
[1:17:22] no shame in being identified in name
[1:17:24] only
[1:17:26] but you see god wants you to pay the
[1:17:28] price to be identified completely
[1:17:32] lock stock and barrel right down to the
[1:17:34] very last little drop
[1:17:37] identified
[1:17:39] i won't say that in public lorne
[1:17:42] amen
[1:17:43] so
[1:17:44] the word prophesies that the light's
[1:17:46] going to shine does it not
[1:17:48] we don't have to we don't have to think
[1:17:50] you know brother paul is just really
[1:17:51] trying to get us hyped up to let the
[1:17:52] light shine no that's the word of god
[1:17:54] the word is declaring the light is going
[1:17:57] to shine
[1:17:59] amen prophecy as it were so you see the
[1:18:02] light is prophesied to shine but see we
[1:18:05] can't control who's
[1:18:08] who sees the light that's right
[1:18:11] we have no
[1:18:12] ability to control who sees the light
[1:18:16] that's why one we never condem
[1:18:19] i've told the story before
[1:18:20] young man raised in the message
[1:18:22] went off to the other side of life and
[1:18:25] behaviors that were just
[1:18:27] terrible
[1:18:29] a lot of people rejected him
[1:18:31] own family pulled back
[1:18:34] catches hiv and whatever else goes with
[1:18:36] those kind of things
[1:18:38] is withering away doctors tell him
[1:18:40] nothing we can do you're dying
[1:18:43] his parents say come home son
[1:18:48] they take him to church
[1:18:49] there's a minister we don't lift the
[1:18:51] minister up it's got to be god in that
[1:18:53] minister or he's just a man talking
[1:18:56] but he's sitting there in a recliner in
[1:18:58] the church they have to carry him the
[1:18:59] deacons would carry him from the car to
[1:19:01] the recliner from the recliner to the
[1:19:03] car started coming
[1:19:05] god started dealing with his heart again
[1:19:08] he's withered down to nothing but bones
[1:19:10] and the minister says if you want
[1:19:12] delivered he's not talking to that young
[1:19:14] man maybe he was directly
[1:19:16] you want delivery
[1:19:18] get up out of your seat
[1:19:20] come up here
[1:19:23] get deliverance
[1:19:25] he's too weak to get out of his seat
[1:19:27] but the deacons bring him forward
[1:19:30] and from a repentant heart
[1:19:33] that is declaring i don't want my idea
[1:19:34] of life lord no longer want my idea i
[1:19:38] want your idea of life lord i want what
[1:19:41] you said was really life and we just
[1:19:45] read john 1 right
[1:19:47] in him was the life the light
[1:19:51] the life
[1:19:54] and this young man
[1:19:56] he comes up there with help
[1:19:59] they pray for him cries out
[1:20:02] feels something sweep through him
[1:20:05] still weak
[1:20:06] but actually able to walk back to his
[1:20:08] seat
[1:20:09] under his own strength
[1:20:11] and from that day on defying every
[1:20:14] medical evidence there was started
[1:20:15] gaining weight and going and then when
[1:20:18] he's healthy again he's gave his heart
[1:20:19] to the lord he's been filled with the
[1:20:21] holy ghost and then as the yearning of
[1:20:23] most any young man would be he's like
[1:20:24] lord i would like to have a wife but
[1:20:26] everyone knows me what girl would marry
[1:20:29] me with my
[1:20:30] history and god hears the hearts cry and
[1:20:33] sends
[1:20:34] a sister in
[1:20:37] it says i don't look at your past
[1:20:42] amen
[1:20:44] hallelujah
[1:20:46] i'm not going to look at you down by the
[1:20:47] well i'm not going to look at you open
[1:20:50] your window overlooking the streets of
[1:20:52] this city
[1:20:53] i'm going to just ignore your past come
[1:20:55] on saints amen
[1:20:57] i'll tell you what you look at the word
[1:21:00] of god you'll find that god's done a lot
[1:21:02] of ignoring of the past because he saw
[1:21:05] original life in an individual
[1:21:08] amen and he looked at that and and that
[1:21:10] young sister come and they had a romance
[1:21:13] and got married the last i knew they had
[1:21:14] two or three children my brother and
[1:21:16] sister because my god is greater than my
[1:21:19] circumstance and the counterfeit will
[1:21:21] not rule the life of the original
[1:21:24] amen no matter how satan tries to stem
[1:21:27] counterfeit counterfeit counterfeit the
[1:21:30] original will always show the sign of
[1:21:33] being original
[1:21:35] hallelujah and that's why the devil just
[1:21:37] batters people batters people batters
[1:21:39] people and they're like oh i can't help
[1:21:41] it i call lord help me i'm discouraged
[1:21:44] on this i'm that amen it might be a good
[1:21:47] sign that the devil's trying to get you
[1:21:49] to disbelieve your origin
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:53] i'll tell you where the origins of the
[1:21:55] universe are they're not somewhere
[1:21:57] beyond the milky way they're not out be
[1:21:59] on the dark holes amen they're not out
[1:22:02] beyond those things my brother
[1:22:04] oh hallelujah amen the origin my brother
[1:22:08] is right here in you and i this morning
[1:22:12] there's where the origin is we don't got
[1:22:14] to look off through the heavens to try
[1:22:16] and figure this out
[1:22:18] hallelujah
[1:22:20] but you see we can't control who sees
[1:22:22] the light
[1:22:24] but we shouldn't be so judgmental that
[1:22:26] we decide in advance who will and who
[1:22:28] won't
[1:22:30] because you see the lights doing exactly
[1:22:32] as the light was prophesied to him
[1:22:36] amen come on when you witness with your
[1:22:40] life in this world it says well you know
[1:22:42] i i just sometimes it's so difficult i'm
[1:22:44] a sister and i can see people looking at
[1:22:46] us and oh i work in the workplace and
[1:22:48] all the men i work with they're just
[1:22:50] rough cry no no i want you i want you to
[1:22:52] stop
[1:22:55] that light
[1:22:56] that's witnessing
[1:22:59] is not you that's exactly
[1:23:01] amen it's him
[1:23:05] don't be ashamed
[1:23:07] it's him
[1:23:09] hallelujah people say well if i had been
[1:23:11] back then
[1:23:12] i wouldn't be like those sadducees and
[1:23:14] pharisees i would have walked out of
[1:23:15] support of jesus
[1:23:17] you don't support him right now
[1:23:19] don't tell me you would have supported
[1:23:20] him then because you'd be there what you
[1:23:22] are here
[1:23:24] hallelujah
[1:23:25] come on
[1:23:27] people are like no we believe the
[1:23:28] message of the hour and then you
[1:23:30] question what the prophet of god said
[1:23:31] i'm sorry you would have been right
[1:23:33] there in that crowd that day saying well
[1:23:35] if you are sister jerry and i was
[1:23:37] talking about this now pardon me i'm a
[1:23:39] little random this morning because i had
[1:23:40] to just prune this thing like a wild man
[1:23:42] with a chainsaw
[1:23:44] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:23:49] the spirit
[1:23:50] of that day
[1:23:52] was jesus
[1:23:54] hey you
[1:23:55] counterfeit
[1:23:59] we're going to just
[1:24:01] cut her arm
[1:24:05] and if you can heal her
[1:24:07] we'll believe you
[1:24:15] that's the same spirit that's here today
[1:24:18] and when the word is preached
[1:24:21] they want to cut it up
[1:24:23] you have to make this message your
[1:24:25] preaching
[1:24:26] fit
[1:24:27] us
[1:24:28] and if it fits us
[1:24:31] then we'll know you're real
[1:24:34] well i'll tell you how you know the real
[1:24:37] you take it right back to the original
[1:24:40] it won't matter personality
[1:24:44] it won't matter how good of gift they
[1:24:46] have as ministers that's right that's
[1:24:48] exactly right
[1:24:51] it's the word that's it
[1:24:54] and if they've got to cut the word today
[1:24:57] to get it to fit
[1:24:59] then we'll believe it
[1:25:00] they would have been standing right
[1:25:02] there with that crowd that day
[1:25:03] yeah
[1:25:04] now if you're the messiah we'll just
[1:25:06] whack her arm off and you'll put it back
[1:25:09] on and then we'll believe you
[1:25:12] see the spirit i can prove this saints
[1:25:15] prophet of god said satan knows how just
[1:25:17] to deliver this in the right way to each
[1:25:21] individual
[1:25:23] one has a doubt and a fear here one has
[1:25:25] a doubt no fear here one can say well
[1:25:28] i've been hurt by the ministry well i'm
[1:25:30] sorry to hear that but i'll tell you
[1:25:32] what the devil saw that and he's right
[1:25:34] there to keep you saying i can't trust i
[1:25:37] can't trust can't trust and i'll take
[1:25:39] you right in the message if you believe
[1:25:40] it where the prophet of god said that
[1:25:42] god would send anointed angels talking
[1:25:45] about ministry that would know exactly
[1:25:47] what you needed and would bring it to
[1:25:49] you but we're there saying no i can't
[1:25:51] trust you
[1:25:52] you're not telling the man you can't
[1:25:54] trust him you're telling god
[1:25:56] i can't trust you
[1:25:59] so we've been hurt by the counterfeit
[1:26:02] reminds me years ago we used to
[1:26:05] go to a certain car wash you know and
[1:26:07] then all of a sudden there was a whole
[1:26:08] big deal of security cameras and always
[1:26:10] a police car lurking by and
[1:26:12] and uh i thought man this is weird
[1:26:16] and
[1:26:17] then one day it comes out
[1:26:19] it's kind of sad but a local lawyer son
[1:26:21] he had a really high class very high
[1:26:23] dollar printer and the lawyer's son had
[1:26:26] figured out
[1:26:27] that
[1:26:29] printer made such a perfect copy of a
[1:26:31] dollar bill
[1:26:34] and if you bought cotton-based paper
[1:26:37] its image of a dollar bill was so
[1:26:38] perfect that all the dollar bill
[1:26:40] dispensing machines at all the car
[1:26:42] washes in town would take it so you
[1:26:43] imagine you're a teenager you drive up
[1:26:46] to this one
[1:26:48] quarters just pouring out go to the next
[1:26:50] car wash
[1:26:53] yeah
[1:26:55] but the problem was
[1:26:57] is the holy ghost will never let the
[1:26:58] counterfeit live very long
[1:27:02] we might fall for the counterfeit for a
[1:27:04] moment and the devil just starts feeding
[1:27:06] it in there look at this i'm getting
[1:27:08] results i'm getting results until the
[1:27:10] car pulls in and they're like oh young
[1:27:12] man put your hands up
[1:27:18] and the young man's like
[1:27:20] i didn't mean to be this way i hope you
[1:27:23] follow me
[1:27:25] i'm sorry
[1:27:27] i'm sorry
[1:27:30] the devil's like wow bummer
[1:27:33] if only if only if only
[1:27:36] with only
[1:27:38] if only
[1:27:40] well the light is doing exactly what it
[1:27:43] was prophesied to do saints
[1:27:45] don't worry about the light
[1:27:47] let's look at the light let's follow the
[1:27:49] light amen and we walk in the light see
[1:27:52] and it's there that we see the light was
[1:27:54] prophesied to bring us or lead us out of
[1:27:56] darkness saints
[1:27:58] come on i know this might not be all
[1:27:59] that exciting this morning but i felt
[1:28:01] led to preach this to you we need to
[1:28:04] walk out of every drop of darknesses in
[1:28:06] our life
[1:28:07] don't just walk out of the major things
[1:28:09] that were darkness in your life but to
[1:28:11] walk out of every drop of darkness
[1:28:13] because the word said that we would walk
[1:28:16] in the light he didn't say we would walk
[1:28:18] in shadows amen that is scriptural yeah
[1:28:21] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:28:23] shadow of death but i'm telling you for
[1:28:25] there to be a shadow in that valley
[1:28:27] there had to be light above it
[1:28:29] whatever was obscuring the word to you
[1:28:32] there had to be light above that the
[1:28:34] light cannot be here and the shadow
[1:28:37] there and it affect you the devil's got
[1:28:39] to try and put the shadow amen that
[1:28:42] cloud that that something in our mind in
[1:28:44] our heart in our life he's got to put
[1:28:46] that between you and the word
[1:28:50] but trust me be assured
[1:28:53] that the light will shine longer than
[1:28:56] the circumstance
[1:28:58] the light will shine longer than the
[1:29:00] cloud that satan has placed in your life
[1:29:03] hallelujah
[1:29:04] because why it was prophesied to lead us
[1:29:07] out of darkness
[1:29:08] now let's look here right here in the
[1:29:10] token
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:14] now
[1:29:18] i kind of modified this because i
[1:29:20] thought maybe i was getting just a tad
[1:29:21] bit aggressive
[1:29:31] can i just preach
[1:29:35] we've got around the message now such a
[1:29:37] spirit
[1:29:38] of denomination
[1:29:40] we throw the token
[1:29:43] out like it was just something
[1:29:45] that's exactly oh that is exactly right
[1:29:48] yeah
[1:29:50] my children are behaving this way in
[1:29:52] that way and they're light lying
[1:29:53] cheating thieving fornicating bunch of
[1:29:56] whatevers but i put the token over
[1:30:03] kind of rough ain't i no
[1:30:06] i don't want us to get into a
[1:30:08] counterfeit view
[1:30:10] of applying the token
[1:30:12] one let me go it's not my notes so i
[1:30:14] can't give you the sermon brother
[1:30:15] branham says before you go to apply the
[1:30:18] token to others i'm paraphrasing it
[1:30:20] apply it
[1:30:21] to yourself
[1:30:24] amen
[1:30:26] well praise the lord we're living any
[1:30:27] old way and we have all kinds of movies
[1:30:29] and garbage in our house and nobody know
[1:30:31] our house from anybody else's house but
[1:30:33] praise the lord i'm gonna put the token
[1:30:35] over my unbelieving children
[1:30:37] well why don't you apply the token to
[1:30:39] the unbelieving parent first
[1:30:45] amen
[1:30:46] but when i see the token i'll pass over
[1:30:48] you it's god's requirement of the hour
[1:30:50] amen the evening time message now look
[1:30:53] at this we got a lot of reasons and
[1:30:55] explanations of what the evening time
[1:30:57] message is
[1:30:58] but look what the prophet of god says
[1:31:00] here the evening time message is to
[1:31:02] apply the token
[1:31:05] you mean the evening time message oh let
[1:31:07] me just make this real complicated for
[1:31:08] you the evening time message is not for
[1:31:12] us to try and split the church in half
[1:31:13] whether the seals are open or not all
[1:31:15] right
[1:31:16] the evening time message is not the fuss
[1:31:19] and fight of whether we this about the
[1:31:21] prophet or whether we thought about the
[1:31:22] prophet it's not about whether he's
[1:31:24] coming back or not it's not about whose
[1:31:27] voice is the thunders it's not about
[1:31:29] whether we can explain the church ages
[1:31:32] adequately or not it's not about all of
[1:31:34] this stuff my brother and sister it's
[1:31:36] right here the evening time message is
[1:31:38] to apply the token
[1:31:41] because i'll tell you what when you get
[1:31:43] the token applied in your life the
[1:31:45] explanation understanding and revelation
[1:31:48] of all these other things just start
[1:31:49] falling into place
[1:31:51] hallelujah it's not like when we have
[1:31:53] this right then we can go a plot token
[1:31:56] no when you get the token applied you
[1:31:58] will then understand these things
[1:32:03] we got it backwards
[1:32:05] we got it backwards
[1:32:07] we got people that think applying
[1:32:09] oh can i say this
[1:32:11] i'm sorry to be painful

[1:34:56] chair and they're walking down to the
[1:34:58] front of the church
[1:35:02] should have left them shoes underneath
[1:35:04] the deal it wouldn't be near as
[1:35:05] embarrassing to walk up front barefooted
[1:35:09] as it is to mince your way
[1:35:12] to the front of the church
[1:35:15] and i'm just going to go ahead and be
[1:35:16] blunt and you almost feel as a minister
[1:35:18] that right in front of us of a different
[1:35:20] church not our church not when we come
[1:35:22] yeah you want to jump up and say here
[1:35:23] sister can you just kind of
[1:35:26] tuck that in there because
[1:35:31] and then go on and on about these tokens
[1:35:33] and what they represent
[1:35:36] brother sisters
[1:35:38] i want the token that we're applying
[1:35:41] to be jesus christ

[1:36:08] today and forever and he's right with
[1:36:12] amen

[1:36:20] and the more i study it just keeps
[1:36:22] jumping out at me and if you think that
[1:36:25] i'm redundant and boring i'm sorry
[1:36:26] please forgive me but if you'll look at

[1:40:17] in the pulpit
[1:40:19] preaching things that are so obviously
[1:40:21] counterfeit to this message
[1:40:24] if there was nobody there going

[1:47:39] faithfulness answer me and in thy
[1:47:41] righteousness enter not into judgment
[1:47:44] with thy servant for in thy sight shall
[1:47:47] no man living be justified
[1:47:49] for the enemy
[1:47:51] do you have one of those
[1:47:54] for the enemy has persecuted my soul
[1:47:57] he has smitten my life down to the
[1:48:00] ground he hath made me to dwell in
[1:48:02] darkness as those that have been long
[1:48:05] dead
[1:48:06] therefore is my spirit
[1:48:09] overwhelmed within me
[1:48:17] and all who've experienced this said
[1:48:19] amen
[1:48:23] the devil
[1:48:25] trying to ride you right down into the
[1:48:27] dirt as though you were dead
[1:48:32] huh
[1:48:34] i thought maybe some of you might
[1:48:37] might actually
[1:48:39] kind of
[1:48:41] recognize this
[1:48:44] it made me to dwell in darkness as those
[1:48:47] that have been long
[1:48:48] dead
[1:48:49] therefore is my spirit overwhelmed
[1:48:51] within me my heart within me is desolate
[1:48:55] i remember the days of old
[1:48:57] when i was walking with praise in my
[1:48:59] lips enjoying my heart and revival
[1:49:02] and i meditate on all thy works
[1:49:05] i'm use on the work of thy hands i
[1:49:08] stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul
[1:49:11] first
[1:49:12] after thee
[1:49:13] as a thirsty land silo
[1:49:16] hear me speedily o lord my spirit
[1:49:19] faileth
[1:49:21] hide not thy face from me lest i be like
[1:49:23] unto them that go down into the pit
[1:49:27] calls me to hear thy loving kindness in
[1:49:29] the morning for in thee do i trust calls
[1:49:32] me to know the way wherein i should walk
[1:49:35] in
[1:49:38] you know what the prophet of god
[1:49:40] speaks not directly from this scripture
[1:49:42] but he speaks
[1:49:44] that's
[1:49:46] when you walk
[1:49:47] in the washing of the water
[1:49:50] of the word
[1:49:54] that place right there you submit

[1:50:05] look saints there's people that would be
[1:50:07] in this church right now they say this
[1:50:08] is the truth
[1:50:10] but they won't get themselves out of bed
[1:50:13] and put on clothes and come down here
[1:50:16] because they think
[1:50:18] i'm being judged
[1:50:21] why don't we just come to the altar and
[1:50:24] just judge ourselves
[1:50:26] why don't we just take this word that
[1:50:27] god has given us and just judge
[1:50:30] ourselves and say lord i have come short
[1:50:32] of the glory of god lord wash me pour
[1:50:34] the water of the word over me lord

[1:52:23] unto thee to hide me
[1:52:25] teach me to do thy will
[1:52:27] for thou art my god
[1:52:29] thy spirit is good
[1:52:31] lead me into the land of uprightness
[1:52:34] quicken me o lord for thy name's sake
[1:52:37] for thy righteousness sake bring my soul
[1:52:39] out of trouble
[1:52:41] and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies
[1:52:44] and destroy all them that afflict my
[1:52:46] soul for i am thy servant
[1:52:49] now remember saints
[1:52:51] it's not what we've done
[1:52:53] that's what he's done for us
[1:52:55] amen amen but we've got to lift our soul
[1:52:58] up amen god's not going to come and say
[1:53:00] you know what i'm going to just force
[1:53:02] you i'm going to coax you i'm going to
[1:53:04] bribe you
[1:53:05] oh how about we do that
[1:53:07] what all of you that will come to the
[1:53:09] altar and
[1:53:10] repent from your bitterness
[1:53:13] we'll give you uh a gift card to
[1:53:15] shepards
[1:53:19] man i imagine we could fill an altar
[1:53:20] every sunday morning because people
[1:53:22] would want to go to
[1:53:24] chapalas but god puts it in such a
[1:53:27] fashion that you have to face yourself
[1:53:29] and you have to come of your own free
[1:53:31] will and you have to come out of the
[1:53:34] fact that the light is shining on you
[1:53:36] and you recognize something on the hymn
[1:53:38] of my garment lord forgive me i don't
[1:53:39] want this i remember what that was about
[1:53:41] lord forgive me and you come but it has
[1:53:43] to be your own free moral agency
[1:53:49] what kind of church would it be saints i
[1:53:51] grew up in one
[1:53:53] but they brow beat you
[1:53:55] i think sister amy sorry to embarrass
[1:53:56] you sister emmy but she has a lovely
[1:53:58] story makes me laugh about the preacher
[1:54:00] laying on the altar and i'm just gonna
[1:54:02] lay here until somebody comes up here
[1:54:03] and repents
[1:54:07] pretty soon everybody's like brother
[1:54:08] sergey are you going to be the one
[1:54:10] i did it last week
[1:54:12] it's your turn
[1:54:16] what kind of relationship is that
[1:54:20] but what about the relationship of
[1:54:21] walking in the light and the light come
[1:54:24] shone right down on you and you realized
[1:54:26] man i didn't do that right
[1:54:29] and people are like it's such a little
[1:54:30] thing why are we repenting i had a
[1:54:31] person tell me this one time why are you
[1:54:33] asking forgiveness for that such a
[1:54:35] little thing i don't know but god laid
[1:54:37] it on my heart
[1:54:39] you know then the person turned around
[1:54:40] and threw
[1:54:41] by saying forgive me right back in my
[1:54:43] face in a later date well you hadn't
[1:54:46] been wrong you're the one that asked for
[1:54:48] forgiveness
[1:54:50] now what you don't understand is if you
[1:54:52] want to eat off a dirty plate you go
[1:54:53] ahead and i took my plate to the sink
[1:54:56] and i washed under the water of the word
[1:54:59] and i cleaned it up because i want it
[1:55:00] off a clean plate
[1:55:05] sorry saints
[1:55:06] sorry there's so much been vinegar in
[1:55:09] today's sermon
[1:55:11] now look
[1:55:13] modern
[1:55:14] events made are made clear have you ever
[1:55:17] caught that in the title
[1:55:18] i i've got war in my life i really
[1:55:20] examine words and their connection to
[1:55:22] each other see it's not just modern
[1:55:24] events
[1:55:26] are
[1:55:26] made clear i mean that they are
[1:55:30] they're made clear by prophecy amen amen
[1:55:34] see a man can say anything but lest god
[1:55:37] interprets that word
[1:55:39] see now we have our own interpretation
[1:55:41] we say it means this
[1:55:44] saying message identity the same thing
[1:55:46] people are like no no no
[1:55:48] no no no brother trevor you don't
[1:55:50] understand brother branham meant this
[1:55:53] well i ain't what he said
[1:55:56] and that ain't what he said for 107
[1:55:58] times
[1:56:00] now you just don't understand you you
[1:56:02] need to get a revelation
[1:56:04] i thought i did
[1:56:07] 107 times worth
[1:56:10] see a man can say anything but
[1:56:12] unless god interprets that word so now
[1:56:14] we have our own interpretation we say it
[1:56:17] means this
[1:56:18] and this one methodist says this now
[1:56:20] people say oh brother paul you shouldn't
[1:56:22] be so personal or we we know who you're
[1:56:24] talking about well that's good i'm going
[1:56:25] to talk about the individual saints get
[1:56:27] this
[1:56:29] amen put this on your plate pour all the
[1:56:30] mustard and catch up you want on it
[1:56:33] if i was preaching against the person
[1:56:37] you should throw me out as your pastor
[1:56:41] but there's a spirit
[1:56:43] behind every one of these things
[1:56:46] lovely people you would love to spend
[1:56:48] almost every friday night with them
[1:56:51] but there's a spirit behind
[1:56:54] that's right
[1:56:59] don't say it paul don't say it
[1:57:04] and this methodist says this and the
[1:57:06] baptist says this and the pentecostal
[1:57:08] says this and the oneness says this and
[1:57:10] the twoness says this
[1:57:13] and oh my there you are
[1:57:17] but god don't need no interpreter
[1:57:20] he's his own interpreter
[1:57:22] he interprets his own word by
[1:57:24] vindicating it in the age that it's
[1:57:26] purposed for
[1:57:28] the age that it's given for
[1:57:31] and we're not living in a pentecostal
[1:57:32] age
[1:57:34] we're living in another age you guys
[1:57:35] quit reading ahead of me
[1:57:38] block that off brothers
[1:57:45] it's just hard to really get the
[1:57:47] emphasis when you guys are saying amen
[1:57:48] before i've even got to it
[1:57:53] we're not living in a pentecostal age
[1:57:54] we're living in another age we're not
[1:57:56] living in methodist age we're living in
[1:57:57] another age
[1:57:58] we're living on up here now if i could
[1:58:01] just give emphasis and interpret what
[1:58:03] the prophet meant
[1:58:08] we're living on up here
[1:58:12] not down here
[1:58:14] we're living on up here
[1:58:21] to the bright age
[1:58:24] oh isn't that beautiful god gave a whole
[1:58:26] age just for us
[1:58:29] the calling out of the church and
[1:58:30] getting it together for the rapture
[1:58:33] now look i want to throw this in maybe
[1:58:34] you'll remember maybe you won't
[1:58:36] but um what did brother brown say was a
[1:58:38] unity
[1:58:40] in the church
[1:58:43] somebody speak out if you remember
[1:58:46] i was all just loving each other on the
[1:58:49] surface right
[1:58:51] that was all of us
[1:58:52] superficial
[1:58:58] that was all of us
[1:58:59] we believe god sent a prophet
[1:59:03] no
[1:59:05] that was all of us
[1:59:06] with the holy ghost
[1:59:09] there's where unity
[1:59:11] comes in the body
[1:59:13] whoa
[1:59:14] my
[1:59:15] goodness
[1:59:21] now i'll come down here we have the same
[1:59:22] altar you've got
[1:59:25] we've got the same offering you've got
[1:59:27] we got the same everything you've got
[1:59:31] and go look it up you'll find i'm
[1:59:33] telling you the truth
[1:59:35] they come to brother branham
[1:59:38] just like they come to jesus
[1:59:41] just like they come to peter and paul
[1:59:43] and all the apostles
[1:59:46] we've got everything
[1:59:48] you've got
[1:59:51] a man
[1:59:52] his eyes healed
[1:59:55] and they're saying that's a devil
[1:59:59] look at this beautiful anointing for
[2:00:01] just a common everyday believer
[2:00:04] i know not what he is but what i do know
[2:00:07] is once i was blind but now i can see
[2:00:12] you describe him how you want to i'm
[2:00:15] going to describe him as the man who
[2:00:18] healed my blinded eyes
[2:00:20] and when jesus meets up with him as it
[2:00:22] were on the porch or the step of the the
[2:00:25] tabernacle
[2:00:26] and he's there what does he do declares
[2:00:28] himself i'm a believer
[2:00:31] what happened was according to the word
[2:00:33] and this was not of the devil this was
[2:00:36] of god
[2:00:37] hallelujah you see what god's doing my
[2:00:40] brother and sister he's bringing it down
[2:00:42] remember the word talks about it brother
[2:00:44] branham talks about it we're coming down
[2:00:46] to a time when the tears and the wheat
[2:00:49] must be separated
[2:00:51] now if i could just personalize this
[2:00:53] i've got to close i've got to close can
[2:00:55] i personalize this to you real quick
[2:00:58] brother turber stand up here please
[2:01:03] the wheat
[2:01:05] and the
[2:01:06] tear or the tear and the wheat but
[2:01:09] that's a would be offensive to call
[2:01:11] brothers trevor the chair
[2:01:13] so brother trevor's the wheat i'm the
[2:01:16] chair
[2:01:17] we realize
[2:01:19] as the scripture said there's a time if
[2:01:21] you try to tear the tear out
[2:01:24] it's going to rip and pull the wheat
[2:01:25] with it
[2:01:27] do you see how they treated me
[2:01:29] they weren't right these people don't
[2:01:30] have the holy ghost don't believe it
[2:01:33] don't believe it
[2:01:34] but the day comes
[2:01:36] and separation comes
[2:01:39] and this one starts saying
[2:01:41] i don't like you
[2:01:46] if i
[2:01:47] if i would have took you with me if if
[2:01:49] they'd ripped me out of the ground years
[2:01:51] ago i know i had enough influence on
[2:01:52] brother trevor i would have took him
[2:01:54] right to the world with me
[2:01:56] but look what's happening
[2:01:59] do you catch it saints
[2:02:00] i want to make this simplistic the
[2:02:02] terror is now going
[2:02:07] i don't like you
[2:02:08] i don't like you there's something wrong
[2:02:09] with your spirit
[2:02:14] and the terror itself
[2:02:31] this is the word saints
[2:02:34] we don't need to help them
[2:02:37] the anointing of the light has matured
[2:02:39] the tear
[2:02:40] that the tear wants to fellowship with
[2:02:42] other terror because that's the only
[2:02:44] place they can be comfortable
[2:02:48] oh i don't say that judgmental trust me
[2:02:50] for my heart i stand clean before god
[2:02:52] but it's a season it's a time and it's
[2:02:55] going to come to pass and it will cause
[2:02:57] in separation in the middle of families
[2:02:59] and friendships and all of these things
[2:03:01] because the tear cannot stand the spirit
[2:03:05] on you
[2:03:12] yes that's the age now living it's my
[2:03:16] honest opinion opinion that's exactly
[2:03:18] the truth and this book is a book of
[2:03:21] prophecy its believers are commanded to
[2:03:24] honor it
[2:03:25] to read it believe it's author for every
[2:03:28] word that's written in there must come
[2:03:30] to pass everything that's been promised
[2:03:32] has to come to pass because it is jesus
[2:03:36] christ in each age the same yesterday
[2:03:39] the same yesterday it was jesus christ
[2:03:41] was in noah it was jesus christ and
[2:03:43] moses it was jesus christ and david it
[2:03:45] was jesus christ and joseph it was jesus
[2:03:47] christ the same yesterday today and
[2:03:49] forever and it's jesus christ
[2:03:53] among his people today
[2:03:56] doing the things that he promised he
[2:03:58] would do in this age
[2:04:00] it's jesus christ
[2:04:03] and you know one of the things he
[2:04:04] promised
[2:04:07] he said i'll be with you
[2:04:10] even
[2:04:11] in you
[2:04:13] hallelujah
[2:04:15] hallelujah if we could just see
[2:04:17] if we could just see the move of god
[2:04:20] saints
[2:04:21] to know we were always in him can we say
[2:04:24] amen
[2:04:25] foundation of the world
[2:04:27] but to see that time that god come down
[2:04:30] fill that little spot that's in the
[2:04:32] heart that they're not sure what the
[2:04:33] purpose of it is
[2:04:40] and then
[2:04:42] he started creeping out
[2:04:45] he went from the inside of the heart
[2:04:48] to the outside of the heart
[2:04:50] from the inside of this flesh
[2:04:52] to the outside of this flesh
[2:04:55] and then he started washing
[2:04:57] this
[2:04:58] started washing that started trimming
[2:05:00] this started trimming that
[2:05:02] and what did it
[2:05:04] the light
[2:05:07] the light of the world do you see this
[2:05:09] message and your bible the same as you
[2:05:10] did five years ago
[2:05:13] impossible
[2:05:14] i say impossible if you're reading it
[2:05:16] you're studying it you're praying over
[2:05:18] it's impossible for it to be the same
[2:05:20] bible
[2:05:22] impossible
[2:05:24] sister emmy would you come that's the
[2:05:25] only way i'm going to shut up
[2:05:28] hallelujah
[2:05:29] well going back to verse 12
[2:05:31] many as received him
[2:05:35] to them
[2:05:36] gave he power
[2:05:38] to become the sons of god
[2:05:40] even to them that believe on his name
[2:05:43] which were born
[2:05:45] not of david and geraldine haylett
[2:05:49] not of blood
[2:05:50] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[2:05:53] will of man
[2:05:54] but of god
[2:05:56] this is how the prophet of god declares
[2:05:58] you a supernatural people
[2:06:01] you're not of this world you're not of
[2:06:03] this earth you're not of this nature not
[2:06:04] of this spirit
[2:06:06] because you are born of the word
[2:06:08] not of the flesh
[2:06:10] oh my
[2:06:12] time for one short
[2:06:14] quote
[2:06:16] and i find amen
[2:06:19] hallelujah
[2:06:20] amen
[2:06:21] [Music]
[2:06:24] and she said
[2:06:25] you are the light of the world this is a
[2:06:27] prayer now saints
[2:06:29] oh let me clarify this i cherry-picked
[2:06:31] this out of a prayer
[2:06:35] as you said you are the light of the
[2:06:37] world grant lord
[2:06:39] that are
[2:06:40] our lights
[2:06:42] who are of your service will shine so
[2:06:45] bright to the others
[2:06:46] that they'll see the light of the gospel
[2:06:48] as we live it
[2:06:50] lord day by day reflecting to them the
[2:06:53] life of jesus christ as he was on earth
[2:06:56] full of humility and sweetness yet with
[2:06:58] the word being lived right through him
[2:07:04] granted lord for we're looking to you
[2:07:06] the great one
[2:07:08] with the switch in the hand
[2:07:11] you hold the world in your hand you hold
[2:07:13] old things in your hand and
[2:07:15] uphold the world by your word oh father
[2:07:18] let us receive the word
[2:07:20] will you please lord
[2:07:22] let that be the testimony and the desire
[2:07:26] of every heart in here
[2:07:30] now saints forgive me sometimes i speak
[2:07:32] things in such a way it might sound like
[2:07:34] i'm
[2:07:34] in condescending where i might be i
[2:07:37] don't mean it that way
[2:07:39] i don't mean i just want you to see this
[2:07:41] i want you to see the word living i want
[2:07:44] you to see that we are the living
[2:07:46] epistles
[2:07:47] amen it's not going to be someone else
[2:07:50] my heart was broke we were down in salt
[2:07:52] lake with the saints there
[2:07:54] we ask about a family or where are they
[2:07:56] at
[2:07:57] no they've left
[2:07:59] they went over with another group over
[2:08:01] here in this city
[2:08:05] then the brother
[2:08:07] he said both what hurts the most
[2:08:11] is this brother that
[2:08:12] we have shared this message
[2:08:14] life together
[2:08:16] looked at me and said if you don't
[2:08:17] believe it
[2:08:19] like this
[2:08:20] you're lost
[2:08:24] i broke my heart
[2:08:26] because you see the prophet of god says
[2:08:28] now in the church age book he says no
[2:08:31] i think it's in the ephesus
[2:08:34] young people you go back and find this
[2:08:37] he says that that's the wrong spirit
[2:08:41] it's wrong spirit
[2:08:42] prophet of the age coming
[2:08:44] he will not say if you don't believe my
[2:08:46] words
[2:08:47] you're lost
[2:08:51] the word for the hour says
[2:08:53] go back
[2:08:54] to the word
[2:08:56] there's the absolute it's not the
[2:08:58] ministry not that ministry not just amen
[2:09:01] saints follow christ follow the word
[2:09:05] the word is here and it's sufficient the
[2:09:07] evidence
[2:09:08] the evidence put god on trial
[2:09:11] the evidence is overwhelming
[2:09:13] amen
[2:09:15] what we want
[2:09:16] i want to be this right here
[2:09:19] i want to be full of humility and
[2:09:21] sweetness
[2:09:22] but i want the word to be lived through
[2:09:24] me
[2:09:24] and the word sometimes
[2:09:27] it's kind of sharp edge
[2:09:30] cuts to the morrow of the bone
[2:09:33] we're looking to the great one who's got
[2:09:35] the switch in the hand and turn on the
[2:09:37] light
[2:09:38] amen this is
[2:09:41] our whole life saying we are the light
[2:09:43] of the world
[2:09:44] i've kept you just a little bit long
[2:09:48] lord forgive me for that
[2:09:49] but i'm telling you saints
[2:09:51] we need to rejoice
[2:09:53] we need to stand up we need to not be
[2:09:55] ashamed we need to claim what's
[2:09:57] rightfully ours and when you see the
[2:09:59] light walk in the light when you see the
[2:10:00] word manifesto say amen to that that is
[2:10:04] what will make the difference
[2:10:06] hallelujah the devil wants to shut you
[2:10:08] up don't let him he wants to walk around
[2:10:10] you know you know you've seen these
[2:10:12] things like what they do in a play or
[2:10:13] something and they want to represent
[2:10:15] something so you know they have little
[2:10:17] angels wings and maybe somebody's
[2:10:19] following somebody else with a stick
[2:10:20] with angel's wings on it
[2:10:22] they you know they're depicting this in
[2:10:24] the play
[2:10:25] i saw this in a real deal so don't look
[2:10:27] at me that way
[2:10:29] [Music]
