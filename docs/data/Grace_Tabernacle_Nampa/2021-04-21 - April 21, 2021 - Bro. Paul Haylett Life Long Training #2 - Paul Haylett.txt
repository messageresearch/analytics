the day and you know we work hard and and uh the stress and strain of life and you know i just i thank the lord for wednesday nights you just be able to come and stop and charge yourself up and if it wasn't for wednesday nights you imagine how long a week could be amen and but but god just comes and and and he moves and you know i i i was really really just feeling to have brother david or brother chris take the service tonight and the longer i fought on last week's thought and that i wanted to bring it forward i finally i was like i just have to do this so anyway uh let's just stand and and god bless you to our visitors i trust that you have a a good time we just uh home folks here and amen just serve the lord with all of our heart i want to uh uh you know sometimes it's amazing you have a thought it just burns you up you study it you get excited i've preached it to sister jerry uh you know at the dinner table i've preached it to her in the bedroom i've preached it to her in the car and and you just get all burned up and i thought i don't even have a title i don't even know what to call this but um i just decided you know this is part of this uh proverbs 22 it's part of this training so we're just gonna uh we just put the lifelong training part two uh on this and and i trust that tonight uh we would take this and and i have a little notation in my notes uh that um you know we know the natural and spiritual parallel each other and so feel free tonight to just uh don't think i'm preaching carnally pull that over into the spiritual and if something in your natural life applies pull it right out of that spiritual you know into the natural and uh i just prayed be a blessing to you tonight just like to go to proverbs the 22nd chapter uh verses one through seven and uh we will then uh take our thought from the seventh verse tonight a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all i i really like verse two to realize if we have been fortunate in our life to acquire some assets acquire some things it doesn't matter we are just sons and daughters of god it doesn't make us special it doesn't make us any more valuable we are the lords amen a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished by humility and the fear of the lord are riches and honor and life thorns and snares are in the way of the froward he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender we ask you father just to come tonight just open our eyes our hearts lord we didn't come here to see one another we come tonight lord to see you and lord we know that we can meet you anywhere but father there's just something special according to your word father that we would not forsake the assembling of ourselves together there's just something special to come together with saints of like precious faith and as was spoken tonight lord our licks of fire coming together lord to just enjoy the presence of the lord enjoy one another's company we just ask you for your blessings tonight help us father as we speak your word in your name we pray amen you may be seated you know as we were speaking last wednesday on the impact of training to train up a child and it would be the impact of training or the lack of and it's lasting effect to realize that we can uh leave an influence as it were on our children uh that will be there for their whole life and you know it is there that in this impact of training or the lack of we can look at disciplined we see a unruly generation we see a children according to the scripture said it would be this way that they would lose all respect and certainly we can look out in the world we live in today and and do that but you know it's kind of interesting i i don't want to delve into politics tonight but just to make a point that my brother and sister have you noticed that the spirit of rebellion knows no age so we have people in our government right now that are you know uh speaking out you know burn the cities down and they deserve it do all of this stuff and that spirit of rebellion you know is not something that's just locked into the young people but it has been there and fostered uh through the years it's been trained up in that way and and we're seeing those kind of spirits now we know in the end time which is the harvest time that uh the uh terrors and the wheat uh then becomes separated so we see the same spirit of rebellion comes down into the church and has its effect upon that and my brother and sister it is there that you realize that um it is the training of that or the lack of that has that effect now you look at that and i just want to focus tonight and uh i hope i don't step on anybody's toes forgive me if i do but these are just the things that were on my heart and you look at this and you'll find that certain behaviors pass through a family line they might be you know we're not talking about i'm right irish so i have a temper but we're talking about how that in certain families uh that we do certain things now i hope you find this humorous and not offensive to be spoken tonight but the little story about you know the mothers cutting the end off the roast to fit it in the pan and you know and then there her daughter says mom why do you do that she said i don't know you know i learned that from your grandmother and they got curious and they call grandmother and grandmother says well my mother always did it and so great grandma was still alive they call her and she says oh we always cut the end off the roast because the pan was too small and so you see how that those things come down in and are passed into generation without even having a reason why and so little things are done now don't want to step on nobody's toes but you'll notice many times that when it comes to financial matters where we're looking right here in verse seven in just a minute we're looking in financial matters and you'll find that when a family is is a very astute in their finances that typically they pass that down to their children and their children will follow those same guidelines because that is their normal so if a family is a hyper uh in that you will find that while they might almost live like paupers they'll have a lot of money in the bank never enjoy their life and and not really how to enjoy as a scripture says the fruit of their labors and then you will find on the other side of those and we'll talk on it tonight a little more extensively in a bit but you'll find those that have the idea that you know it doesn't matter i can always take care of that tomorrow and uh you know they're the ones that are always broken they're not thinking about saving they're just thinking about making their credit card payment and even then it becomes burdensome or worrisome to them and you'll find that these kind of behaviors typically are then passed down in a family because the children grow up and living hand to mouth or as my dad you know growing up on a dairy farm my dad used to say hoof to mouth but anyway um growing up hand-to-mouth is completely normal it's just what you do this is how people live you know always struggling to pay the next bill the the mortgage or the rent or the car payment to put groceries on the table and many times people say well if i just have more money but you see the behavior would dictate that no matter how much money they have it will never be sufficient and so what we want as christians is to find balance in our life and you look at that in natural uh types spiritual and you can find my brother and sister that if we go too far on the one side we'll just say well you know hey we believe in predestination it's in the bible and so therefore if our kids are going to be saved god will just take care of that and then we go on the other side which is the hyper side and you know if your child ever does one thing wrong you know you're bent out of shape over it because they're going to miss the rapture my brother and sister what we strive for is the middle of the road we strive for balance in our life that we can come and realize by god's grace amen that we're going to make it amen by god's mercies we are going to find the word is sufficient for our day and his grace is sufficient for our lives and then we can move forward knowing that if we make a mistake the blood is there for us and so it's there that we'll look at this and while we'll be talking in a financial lingo you might say tonight for a while i want you to draw those over back and forth to to see that because you see the natural and the spiritual run in parallel lines and so i want you to just feel free if you you see something just go ahead and pull it over because we're not here as it is some kind of financial seminar because you'll see my brother and sister that often times when we find ourselves unable to cope financially there comes a desperation there comes a behavior comes patterns that creep in there will be things that will you would do or things that you will react to that if you didn't have that pressure in your life you would not and so it's there that often times satan bases to come into a position where we say well it's not how much it costs or how long to pay for it but how big is the payment and uh i i just encourage you as your friend your brother in christ to never allow yourself to get caught into what is the payment be good stewards of what god has given you and my brother and sister if the car starts and it drives it doesn't matter about what it looks like or what someone else thinks of you save up your money pay cash for it amen because then you can enjoy what you have amen now if you disagree with me that's fine we still love one another amen so you look at this and and find that these these uh behaviors now the scripture says that a borrower is servant now a servant my brother and sister is in the root of this a servant is a person or something in a subservient position in other words a lower position and so it is a position that is left to be dictated by another and certainly we know as christians that we look at the word of god and realize how if left alone in this world that we would be subservient to the devil we would be subservient to satan's plan for the age and so we would look at that because you see born in sin shaped in iniquity we come speaking lies all the behavior of the carnal and you look at that my brother and sister and we will find ourselves in debt and so by god's grace isn't it so beautiful the debt was paid we have no no reason to accept satan's verdict for our life now my brother and sister we would be left in a position dictated by another and and while i'm preaching this to you so that no one will think that i'm i'm trying to take another deal uh every year uh we borrow a very substantial amount of money to balance out or buffer the farm uh money coming and going and uh sister jerry will tell you that the minute i sign my name to that paper i'm stressed out it's the minute that i have committed to that that i feel a pressure are you with me and so it might be the mortgage it might be a car payment whatever it might be but you see there is a certain pressure that comes with that and knowing that i now am indebted or obligated to repay that and so what we do and i'm going to speak from a personal side here i hope some of you i hope most of you i hope all of you don't have this problem but you see when you borrow in the natural you commit your resources to repay that now if you uh uh don't feel sorry for me i i willingly did this in half for 30 years but you know it isn't that you go and sign your farm loan that you just committed a little something we literally sign our name and say everything we own will now back that up maybe with a car you know they would come and take your car maybe with a house they would come and take your house but you see we're and i hope you catch the spiritual side of this when we uh get caught up in this debt it is everything that you are committed to that so the devil doesn't come along and say you know i'm just going to take this little something from you i'm going to take this little something from you he wants you he wants to be able to take the paper as it were serve it on you and lay claim to you now we think my brother and sister how it is through the scripture we have such beautiful examples and you know when one would come and and we would see how that one says you know what uh you're a closer a nearer kinsman than i and so do you want to redeem and he says you know i'm not going to redeem this unless it would mar my own inheritance and i can here to tell you tonight that satan would not go to calvary to be your savior because he knew what beyond a doubt that if he laid his life down he could not raise it back up so he's not going to mar his inheritance to pay your debt but praise the lord aren't you glad tonight our lord jesus said i know who i am i know what i was called to do and i will lay my life down and it will raise again amen so that position was not dictated by the devil now you imagine all the minions of the devil must have been so disappointed on the third day when our lord jesus rose and they had been having their victory dance their celebration they thought we have finally won but when he was there took those keys went down there to death hell in the grave and come back a conqueror they must have said what is wrong with our plan and i'm my brother and sister i'm firmly believe it's this is kind of irrelevant but i firmly believe amongst the legions of the demons that satan has there are some that are already committed to the idea they're defeated because at everything through history that they have approached everything that they have done every time they come in contact with a son or daughter of god amen and they come in the experience of the holy spirit they find themselves defeated they say well i've got a grip on them i've knocked them down i'm going to do that but the lord lifts us up hallelujah so it's not about flesh and blood but it's about principalities and powers and we're on the winning side amen so you look at that we have to commit our resources to the promise of repaying now if you look at that in the natural makes perfectly good sense but you look at that my brother and sister if we're not careful there's certainly many religions that hold on to this that we have a debt we must pay and so therefore we're going to have a works gospel we're going to do all of these things well i'm here to tell you tonight that we cannot repay that debt it is impossible for you and i to repay that debt and god would not put that obligation i serve god tonight you serve god tonight because you love him anything short of that you'll give up everything short of that you'll say just repossess it i'm not making no more payments but the love that god places down in the heart of sons and daughters of god is not a debt i must pay him back but it is something that is swelling welling up from within us that we just love our lord and it is because he loved us when we were unlovable but it really even transcends that it goes that there's just simply something in us that wants to love him back amen you know you think about the human relationship huh and i'm just going to call it the love affair i hope you don't mind the term of that but my brother and sister you'll find that it is there that you go through life and you meet that one special lady or that one special man you're not gonna say well i know that there is uh according to science and psychology there will be literally hundreds of people with this personality traits and look like this so i'll just search the world till i find one of them no sir there's something in you that meets this individual and you know this is the one and you love them amen you don't say well we'll go through life and and you know i hope you have a sense of humor tonight we'll see how well she works out as a farm wife we'll see how well she does this we'll see how well she does that no you love her you just simply love her you you simply i have something inside of you that is almost as though something in you reached out you can't see it it's not tangible you can't grab it but it reached out and it got a horse of their heart and they reached out and got a holst of your heart and it's unbreakable that is the very type of sons and daughters of god the bride of jesus christ the world might look at that and say i don't understand these christians but my brother and sister without that relationship they can't understand you the scripture says that without the holy ghost we cannot call him the christ so that relationship has to already be fostered it already has to be in place and it's there well my brother and sister if the world can't see it the world can't find it the world can't understand it the world can't sever it praise god we were born hallelujah hallelujah now look at this the scripture shows us now when i make this statement my brother and sister i hope you don't mind but there is not a particular scripture that says this but it is the context of literally hundreds of scriptures the scripture shows us not to borrow of this world's vain glory in other words there's nothing out here when we're living our life and you say well i need a little something in my life there's nothing out here in this world for a son or daughter of god to say i'll indebt myself to this world to this age out here to the circumstance of this i'll indebt myself to have this now i'm not talking about having a house mortgage and those kind of things i'm talking about more in the spiritual and moral realm amen so you look at this there's nothing that the world has that we should indebt ourselves to that because all of that is vanity now just uh you want to kind of study that just go back in your bible reference that and vanity appears many many times in the bible and my brother and sister it shows us that everything that is in this world that is borrowed from this world you say well brother paul i work for this corporation and i this and i this and i this my brother and sister the word of god says he provides for you so i don't know who we'll name well we'll just name micron up here nobody likes micron so micron doesn't provide for sons and daughters of god god provides for sons and daughters of god god anoints companies like micron to pay good wages for a talent that god gave an individual and so it all comes down to god hallelujah so you look at that amen so we won't commit our resource to repaying something that we borrowed from this world's vainglory can we can we agree with that amen because you see everything borrowed from this world must be repaid with interest i was raised under the philosophy i guess you would say my dad reminded me of it plenty of times son there is no free lunch well you know i wondered now where'd my dad get that idea obviously i could embrace it growing up i started to figure that out when somebody comes around fertilizer salesman equipment salesman he gives you a coat he gives you a hat he takes you to lunch he's expecting somehow to influence you and he plans on getting that back many times over but you know that's just kind of our thoughts and then one day your eyes are opened and you look at that and the scripture says the wages of sin and while i won't try to pin it down to one single scripture concerning salvation all through the bible it shows us that a life lived for christ the payment is eternal life no free lunch no free lunch whatever side of the equation we're on no free lunch now it is fun if you don't mind a moment of humor it is fun when you know you uh deal with someone and they start to butter you up you understand that term right they start they give you notebooks and they give you hats and they give you coats and they take you to lunch and then after they throw their whole presentation out you look them in the face in the kindest of words and say do you realize your prices are about seven percent too high and they like i wonder how many people look the devil in the face one day had the courage to tell them the price for your service the price for what you gave me is too high i think there'll be millions but do you think my brother and sister now with this you know image that we've kind of all grown up and we talk about we're going to get to the pearly gates and we're going to be standing there and saint peter's going to read your name and invite you into glory and you're going to stop just as you're going to pass through the gates and you're going to stop and say say peter can i say something to you sure i just wanted to tell you the price of admission is too high no one no one ever but it's a pretty high price as a christian isn't it all only because the devil presents it as something that should be simpler when we get anointed by the holy ghost saints come on you're with me aren't you when we get anointed by the holy ghost under that anointing no price is too high for eternal life it's only when the devil gets to put his sales pitch in there this price is too high you ought not have to do this look you ought to be able to go live this life and do this and still be a christian sorry you get out from underneath that anointing and the life righteousness holiness perfection in christ we don't value we don't look at that and say that's too high we say you know what that's a prize and i'm going to press to the mark i'm going to press to that i'm claiming that hallelujah aren't you glad amen because remember everything that is in this world must be repaid with interest and remember that our debt was done as it were free gratis from jesus christ to you and i that we could never even remotely repay that and he'll never ask you to and there again i want to reiterate that it is because we love him that we live this life that we live the word out hallelujah now i want to take this in a little different think about these quotations right here 1965 january the 20th 1965 and this could have been spoken yesterday and be just as accurate it says now if we're on the gold standard and we are broke now think about this my brother and sister don't want to bust anybody's bubble but you know they have figured out that this stimulus check that you received in the mail is going to cost the american taxpayer somewhere in the region of 15 to 17 000 for the 1400 they gave you no free lunch now we know what the book of revelation says right so we can look at this now we're on the gold standard and we are broke now what is going to happen what is going to happen you know the rich people of this nation these big factories and whisky men and tobacco men and so forth like that is not going to stand to change the currency if you wonder what changing of the currency does just go back and study the history of argentina cuba et cetera it takes countries that were once prosperous and throws them into the chaos of poverty except for the select few the only thing we have to do is borrow it now i want you to follow see this this this goes it's just amazing i've got a half a million bucks with just a little bit of ink out of a bic ink pen and our country produced trillions of dollars on just a little bit of ink on some paper somebody's going to pay that bill see only thing we'll do is borrow it there's only one place we can borrow it and when we do we sell our birthrights out to it that's right that's what you're going to do you're owned by it that system there is nothing else you can do our bible tells us they'll come a day you won't buy or sell without being part of the system now look how that is the child training if you follow me that they're now presenting this idea that you'll need a passport to fly and someone said well that's not going to be sufficient we should make it that you would need a vaccine passport to go from state to state what will you do when they start off with you'll need a vaccine passport to go in the grocery you see my brother and sister what it is the child meaning the people is being trained that will come to the place i'm not talking about the bride of christ but i'm just giving you just a little glimpse of it they're being trained to accept the idea this is normal we have to protect ourselves now have you noticed my brother and sister this even is coming to the church that if you notice that people have an inordinate amount of fear even though jesus said fear not they're telling them look you didn't know what you was talking about there's a lot to fear in the day we live no my brother and sister if we get into the spirit of christ the holy ghost you will recognize that fear just fades away because you know that nothing can happen to you but what god allows it to happen oh some people say you're taking that too far there's accidents all the time is there we give the term accident i know i'm speaking to the choir but god's either in control or he's not and if we can come to the place that we believe god is not in control there is nothing that we can trust nothing we can trust saints do you know if i have my facts right you might look it up and find out i'm wrong but i believe i read this where more people are struck by lightning and clear skies than they are when there's thunder heads and whatever i think you guys need to be careful only go out on cloudy days because the odds are against you you see as sons and daughters of god we're not ruled by that spirit we are ruled by the fact that we are christ and christ is ours and he is in complete control and we'll stand on his word and whatever his word said we support that 100 percent amen but you see what's happening let me get back to this so we can move on what happens is the system my brother and sister the system they're already saying maybe we should put something in place retroactive that people who receive stimulus whenever they make over certain amounts of income that we should retrieve that from them are they going to retrieve 1400 or 17 000. i hope you're catching this right well you know what i mean you guys believe in degrees of sin right right we don't believe in degrees of sin the wages of sin is probation a fine community service no sir the wages of sin is death very simple very simple so what's happening do you see my brother and sister i'm not a conspiracy theorist i'm a bible that's right i'm a bible would it be okay to use the word bible theorist no that don't sound right because it's not theory you understand what i'm saying a bible believer where's the settlement that i'm a bible believer the bible my brother and sister shows us clearly it's not a battle of flesh and blood this isn't not about the the politics the governments the the sides of the thing my brother and sister what they're looking for is your birthright they are going to get men and women's birthright by forfeiture we were joking today it was amazing when the stimulus another man brought this up he said you know it's amazing when the stimulus check come out we went into costco and all the televisions were on sale and they were priced right there where you could afford one what are they doing putting clothes and food and medical no no no they're they're just taking and the money is passing right through you and not you i hope not you please say it's not you passed right through you and where did it go right to a big corporation the very people that's the big factories the whiskey and the tobacco men and etc the money's just passing right through you it was the way the government could hand the money to them and yet you won't revolt because you had your chance i hope you catch the spiritual ramification we don't really have time tonight to really go into that so what happened when people fall into the system when the birthright sells out and we can go right back in our bibles and study the birthright right jacob and esau we can see the birthright some people want the birthright so much my brother and sister as it was in the type of jacob that they're willing to resort to different things and the bride of jesus christ put such a value on this birthright that god has given her she will not sell it out for the things of this world right here she's not willing to give it up for her uh you know bowl of porridge she won't do that now look any time that you uh are are dealing any time that you uh are a borrower you'll find yourself in a relationship i'm not being too clinical tonight am i you'll find yourself in a relationship my brother and sister whether you're talking about just at the counter down here and you've got a little a line of credit with your your bank or you've got a little heloc on your mortgage and or whatever you've got you you're building a relationship and and they want to know every once in a while how are you doing they might might just kind of subtly they'll they'll follow your bank balances they'll follow your credit report they'll follow these things because they're in a relationship with you amen and so it says my brother and sister as we do while we are not wanting to borrow of this world's vain glory have you ever seen much i was talking to a man the other day sorry if i throw in this personal thing but i was talking to a man the other day he drove a nice pickup and uh he had a 750 dollar a month payment on the pickup and then he'd went out and spent about five thousand dollars on rims and tires another couple thousand dollars on on his uh exhaust system and uh he's sure hoping that the economy doesn't uh move because if so he's in trouble and i got to thinking about a man who lives down the road from us a ways now i must admit he's old maybe it's the old men that finally collect the dollars i don't know but i know a man that drives a pickup that's worth maybe four or five thousand dollars and has four or five million in the bank he's not concerned because he's taken care of business hope you follow me you see my brother sister it's not the vainglory of this world it's not how big our church is it's not how magnificent or how well known we are or who in the city would come to our church none of that matters if christ is here we have the wealth of this world we have everything we need if christ is here if we don't have christ here it won't matter if we have millions in the bank we will be bankrupt and so the vainglory of this world is banking on a look on a presentation on a behavior and it shows and it is there according to the scripture the spirit of vanity now in psalms 37 look at this right here i hope none of you qualify in verse 21 here the wicked borroweth and payeth not again boy that's pretty blunt for a christian that might just think i ain't paying them no get that get that idea the devil's thrown out there about not paying your bills out of there if you have to eat beans and rice you pay your bill the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth you know you've got to have something to give if you're going to give and we know god promised to bless us for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off the steps this will go right back to whether god's in charge or not that's right come on the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way so god's not going to send you in a pathway that's not pleasing to him people say well the lord told me to do this the lord told me to do that and then it turns into chaos and people are shorted and all kinds of things happen my brother and sister i won't go there nah that's definitely a rabbit trail but i want to tell you right now steps of a good man you can study this out and it's not just he's a nice kind gentleman we're talking about a man who's obedient to the word of god follows the leadership of the holy ghost god's in charge of his life that's why i get up in the morning and i sometimes say lord forgive me of my vanity i'm worried about the price of commodities i'm worried about the price of fuel i'm worried about this i'm worried about that and then i have to stop and say you know what i'm not in charge of this anyhow though he fall here's the verse i referenced to earlier though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord uphold of him with his hand aren't you glad i'll tell you what you think about it what is it the footsteps and the sands of time to realize that it's god carrying us we're not doing anything god's taking care of us along in this journey amen i have been young and now i am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread he is ever oh come on can someone say it with me he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed i am blessed you are blessed but i want to focus right here my brother and sister he is ever merciful and lyndon you read that and you're almost it strikes my mind like he lindeth like a banker something spoke to me and said that's not right our god is not a banker he doesn't say i'll give this to you for a season and you must give this back plus more that's not how our god operates grace and mercy is sufficient amen and to the day my brother and sister so we looked into this and to realize how beautiful that the word of god is and how it lays this out because the definition of this word going back into the greek does also talk about uh to borrow as a form of obligation but this word lindeth means to twine amen to unite to remain to join together [Music] now let's read that a little different he is ever merciful and he has joined together with you and i and his seed is blessed he has entwined us that means to twist together into one oh hallelujah he's not a banker with a handout pay the debt pay the debt he's over here saying you and i are one you in me as one hallelujah you're not subservient and i will take this and show you by type in the scripture in a minute you're not subservient you are the bride of christ according to the word of god and what god has done is not because he has a paper or a debt over you he did it freely and he didn't say i loan it to you but he says i have given you i have given you my name i have given you my spirit i have given you my nature i have given you my life nowhere did he said i just loaned it to you for a season he says i gave it to you and you are now identified in me oh hallelujah oh thank you lord i'm sorry saints but i got excited when i was looking at this you look at this in a world you know it's just like well everything has a price it does that's absolutely right everything has a price christ paid the price to come down and enjoying himself with you and i to wrap himself with you and i that we would become one he paid a price and people say well it costs a lot to be a christian does it hallelujah i was listening to a financial deal the other day made me cry i say that a little bit facetiously but it's talking about how if you started off at the age of 20 or 21 and put 122 dollars or something in the bank every month at that age at 65 you would be worth several million dollars just on interest and i cried because at 20 or 21 i had a new pickup and i had a new dirt bike and i had a gun and i had this and i had that and i had no savings in fact it's kind of embarrassing that when sister jerry and i got married she had more money than i did but you see my brother and sister nothing is free everything has a cost he paid that cost and he sent us the letter that said you are free amen hallelujah i just rejoice i'll never i'll never get somebody said well you know they when you're saved you're safe you know it's just kind of that's it i'm sorry i wake some up in the middle of the night sometimes and i'm just like why me lord why not the man down the road why not the man on the hill why not this lord why me when it all settles i have no real answer to that other than thank you lord hallelujah you know i've come across some thoughts in different people and they think that predestination comes as kind of a form of obligation that you know okay god chose you and now you have to perform god making you do this but you see when i read my bible right the ones who don't even believe in predestination have just tore a page out of their bible but people get this idea of god making you oh my how they miss it how they miss it my brother and sister predestination is the revelation that i was called of god you realize my brother and sister if the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord then predestination said you would be here tonight the predestination said you would say praise the lord for saving my soul and pray destination acknowledge that you would look here and look at the blood and realize how much that debt was paid and predestination would look into your life and say you know what even in the hard times i'm going to say the lord is my savior the lord is my shield my buckler he is my uh my my rock he's everything amen we'll look at that predestination is not a taskmaster causing you to it's a revelation that god said i knew you would i knew you would i knew what i put in you and i knew that you would be here to hear the preaching of the word and say amen tonight i am a son of god i am a daughter of god you wouldn't sit back and said well maybe i am or i could be a possibility you look at the word and the word spoke to you and something inside of you responds to that word and you know you are oh excuse me for getting excited hallelujah as my brother and sister my bible says now i'm not saying who i have no no control nor would i even want that kind of authority but my bible says that i'm called to hear that's right amen can you can you stand with me i'm not going to sit back and say oh okay so that's god's word for the day fine fine fine no sir something i i praise the lord that you paul praise the lord that's yes that's those footsteps right there i want to walk in those footsteps i want to be that man the bible's talking about i'm not going to let the devil come and say but just a second we have some debts that you haven't paid i'm sorry to tell you my debt is paid it's paid in full hallelujah there's nothing like that i can tell you saints when we paid off the farm that we live on or used to live on i should say we're working on the next one debt you know but there was nothing like the feeling of the day when that letter come in the mail and we realized this place belongs to us talking natural now there was just something about that and there was a man said hey there's a farm over here i would love to own this farm and he says you know what we can loan you he named a certain amount of money against this farm that you have paid off and you could buy that farm boy i love that farm no because there's nothing like knowing that you're free oh is that not what the word had told us oh he who is free is free indeed hallelujah i'm not going to say i'm going to go back out here and immerse myself in the world for a while because surely god would just come back and drag me back out of this mess no sir i am free i am not going back hallelujah the devil no matter how many flowers my daddy used to tell me this i'm sorry to just kind of sound like i'm reminiscing but my daddy used to say son he said i don't care how many roses you hang on a pig it's still a pig you know yes sir hallelujah now i want to just tie this up right here we're talking about what's ours and what's not and what's borrowed and what's i won't take you in the scripture for the sake of time here tonight but esther the whole story comes along and it's unfolding and one day there's a need one day the pressure is on one day the world around her is threatening to consume her and all that she values mordecai says you know what little girl you're probably born for a day just like this day you know kids can be cruel i remember as a young man this young man made a statement he said oh i wished i was born in the days of cowboys and indians and this other kid got this slider in and he says yeah imagine some indian would have liked to have seen you because your hair is pretty that's just cruel this kid goes away crushed his little dream is he's telling me i would have been killed and scalped and this is horrible no we were born for this day don't look back and say i wished we were back here i can tell you my brother and sister's never been easy to serve god there's never been any cake walk there's never been any you know peaches and cream it's always required an effort so here we're looking i i hope i'm not being too crass tonight i mean you see we can fantasize some idea of what it would be like to be somewhere else to have been someone else you know the prayer warrior that everybody envies oh brother so and so when he prayed praise things happen we have a fantasy that he kneels down for the same length of time that we do when he prays but god answers his prayer we're not willing to pay the price he prays pays for answered prayers come on saints i don't want anybody to feel bad i'm just telling you don't envy that unless you're willing to pay the price he's paying don't think oh i would love to be spiritual i'd love to do this are you willing to pay the price there's the cost before i get negative here esther comes in that time with confidence we've preached about her many times here in the church and she comes she doesn't walk in and say you know what i hope i don't die i hope i don't die i hope you don't exile me i hope i don't you know no sir she went in there she said you know what i'm not just the queen i'm his wife i'm not just another woman i'm his wife oh if we'll approach god that way amen we're not just some person out here his word declared that we are the very bride of jesus christ we are his wife and the king looks out there and i can only see his heart melt my brother and sister i hope you catch the spiritual type here he sees his wife and he knows she's there not to talk to the the banker you know or the chief financial officer of the kingdom not to talk about the decorator or the baker she's there to talk to him and she's there and he says you know what come he holds his scepter outcome and when she come up he says now sweetheart i'll borrow to you anything to the half of the kingdom did i twist something up there i got mixed up didn't i no sir he said i give amen to you to the half of my kingdom esther was not a beggar but i can assure you that when esther approached her husband through the ages she didn't go in there and say well i've decided to sell that quarter of the kingdom to the kingdom next door because i need some spending money macy's has got a discount sorry sisters so i'm really sorry no sir look at this esther then had a reassurance of who she was and she had no debt to pay she was not esther the orphan any longer she is esther the queen she knew it and i believe her life showed it she walked with confidence she didn't approach her husband as in please but she approached him as a wife should with diligence and confidence integrity stewardship and most of all love that's it amen hallelujah he's ever merciful and he's entwining us into a relationship it is not well i do everything he told me to do i did the ten commandments didn't work for the rich young ruler did it no i've done all this since my youth didn't work for him no relationship amen hallelujah hope you don't mind some reading right here now the papa's vision is just really good it's talking about john now and under the effects of vision no human being could stand the full effect of that vision his strength utterly gone john fell at his feet as though dead but the hand of the lord in love touched him and the voice of blessing said fear not don't be afraid i am the first and last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i'm alive forevermore what is there to fear the judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us i mean there is nothing my brother and sister that would go or transcend that he did that for you and i he did not do that for a historical church he did not do that for a church of the future he did that for us here today oh beautiful beautiful beautiful amen he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus amen see for a surety our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge and as judge the case is settled i tell you what i like i like that now you know in my youth i i had a little issue i visited the judge a few times uh nothing major you know 80 or 90 and a 35 is not really a big deal but i tell you my brother and sister i learned the lesson really fast when sitting in court one day the judge leans over and said is your father's name david i'll pay the ticket just tell me what i owe i'm not gonna talk to your father about this but i just want you to know young man if i ever see you in this court ever again i will remember today you know what i realized the judge had just become my attorney and he said i'm gonna let you go but i'm not gonna let you go forever with this behavior you gotta change it oh and by the way the ticket would be about 750 dollars and full amount of points on your driver's license wait that means i don't have a driver's license yes sir i really appreciate you not telling my daddy too do you understand my brother and sister he's our judge he's our attorney and he tried the case and says no charge case dismissed how beautiful is that now don't misunderstand me i don't glory in the behavior of my childhood it was ridiculous and i would hope every young person here would get beaten for that kind of behavior sounds hypocritical i'll face the repercussions of being a hypocrite but but you know don't don't do that don't do that nothing to be gained nothing to be gained amen now look at this see for a surety our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge and as judged the case is settled it's finished there is now therefore no condemnation anytime condemnation shows up my brother and sister it's the devil trying to trick you into claiming something that's paid in full why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us now i want to stop just take a moment right now my brother and sister i want you to look in your life and search it from beginning to end top to bottom has god ever failed you we cannot in honesty say god has ever failed us hallelujah why should it fear punishment or death it has all been overcome he here is the mighty conqueror here is the one who conquered both worlds of the seen and unseen not like alexander who conquered the world at the age of 33 and knew no other way to turn for further conquest so he died a victim of sin and riotous living not like napoleon who conquered all of europe but was finally defeated at waterloo and banished to elba only to find himself conquered but nothing could conquer christ he that descended has now ascended above all unto him has been given a name that is above every name do are we agreeing with this amen yes he conquered death hell and the grave has the keys thereof what he loses is loose oh i'll tell you my brother and sister what he loses is loosed what he binds is bound there is no changing of it the devil come back and say you were once caught in sin lust of the flesh pride of life you were a druggie you were this you were that you might have been a woman at the well and we can say praise god i might have been but i am not i am a son of god i am a daughter of god hallelujah i am not what you're saying i am devil amen there was no conqueror before him there is none beside him he alone is the savior redeemer he is the only god and lord jesus christ is his name now he's speaking back these words as it was spoken don't fear john don't fear little flock amen all that i am you can borrow hallelujah i'm an heir to it and the devil can't forge enough papers the devil cannot trump up enough stuff he can do nothing my brother and sister because i'm an heir to it hallelujah that means i have rights to it not the right to abuse it not the right to throw it in the dirt kick it around but the right to look at what god has done what he has given what he has opened before our eyes a life he has given a love he has given and i can look at that and say thank you lord now i'll be a good steward i'll be a good steward of the love you have given me amen i was reading some lovely writings and a man says something of the order i don't remember exact words he said remember what the bible said you shall know them by their love then he got mean that was just so sweet warm fuzzy not by their membership of a church not by who they know nor by the wealth of their possession but by their love i'm sorry saints and i'm sometimes not the nicest guy don't misunderstand i'm not apologizing for that but i want you to know that i love you enough to do my very best to speak truth and sometimes you'll go home from that and you lay in bed and the devil's like well you sure made them look like bad or you made this and you made that and i have to remind myself i have to remind myself just listen to what you preached just listen to what you preach listen and do what you preached sorry devil it says right here paid in amen amen now maybe you don't have that problem i hope you don't but sometimes my brother and sister we kind of forget all that i am you are heir amen too we're not borrowing we're not paying interest on it it's ours it's ours to live it's ours to share how could we ever out give god it would be impossible but we're not looking at the carnal now we're looking at the life he has amen oh my oh my oh my okay can we go into part three right now all my power amen you know esther didn't have to go to the chamberlain who cared the eunuch who cared for all the harem all the women she didn't have to go and say now you guys go ask my husband if they can do this and this she knew who she was would you please and they're amazing have you ever met somebody who is really rich like rich beyond measure it's amazing rich me on major produces what i would call two very contrasting spirits used to do work for a man many years ago when i was in construction trades the man back then was worth hundreds of millions of dollars and he would come on to a job site and he would say would you please do this for me of course we will sir and then i met men who looked at me as though i was subservient and when these men the same time started huge projects in boise you know what door i beat feet to i went to the one who even though at that time sister jerry and i could barely barely just with three kids just barely paid our bills made a living i didn't care this is the guy i want to work for that's the guy i want to be identified with this is the one who had respect for me in my position do you realize what god's doing he is giving saints i hope you catch this it's it's kind of going off in a little avenue but i hope you catch this do you realize that god is giving respects to you he doesn't look at us in our lowly position and say you were once this or you were once that he never he never brings that up amen god pays respects to us he says all i ever seen you as was righteous and holy and perfect and mine oh that's the part that stirs my heart mine mine oh all power sister emmy would you come please all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail i'll tell you i thank the lord and when i read my bible and i study this this is here in this quotation but this is the scripture my brother and sister when i read this it's just such a lovely reminder of me of how my lord looks at me because i tell you what my brother and sister are we can be hard enough on ourselves but lo look what our lord he gives respects to you and i honor to us as sons and daughters of god my aren't you glad tonight amen that we could just come to this lovely place being trained god loves us so much he's investing he's training us bringing us to a place we recognize who we are and the authority that we have i mean once again just a little reference back think about what esther had to go through an orphan you study the scripture i'll tell you mordecai was not a pushover he had an expectation of esther and he held her to that standard and she subjected herself to a whole kingdom [Music] for a chance to be queen imagine how it would have changed her world if she had known she was the queen but you see how god allowed that to happen he let her go through every struggle of life everything of life the ups and the downs the uncertainties but because she was queen she had to be manifested as queen in the right season and here we are as sons and daughters of god according to the word the bride of christ amen the queen and we have to be manifested we can look back and say but i was orphaned i was this i was that no sorry god knew you were his and he said the season will come and i will express it isn't that beautiful i just love that it just always serves my heart saints maybe i maybe i am i have to admit i'm the guy that that you know sometimes will hear something or read something or see something and you know find myself with tears in my eyes i'm sorry maybe maybe i'm a little emotional but i tell you what i'd rather be just a tad bit emotional than a tad bit hard hallelujah there's a fountain open in the house of david amen do we got a moment we can just worship the lord let's just stand and amen just uh enjoy just a moment of singing some words here praising to our praise to our lord hallelujah amen thank you lord hallelujah [Music] we'll take you from the nation and bring you to your own land and i'll be sanctified in you a new heart will i give you and play my spirit

christians we're christians we're believers we're believers not churchgoers the day for that is gone that is behind us this is a time that the bride of christ is taking the revealed open word and she
