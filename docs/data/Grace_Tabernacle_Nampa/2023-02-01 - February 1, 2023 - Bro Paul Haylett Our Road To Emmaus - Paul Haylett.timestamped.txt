[34:07] that God has already deposited in US
[34:12] I believe just as it is in living the

[34:15] our worship is oftentimes measured by

[34:43] were talking about that in the car but
[34:46] sometimes it works in reverse and God

[39:28] you realize if you look very critically
[39:30] or analytically at this
[39:33] there's a little period in there that
[39:34] we'll get to if the Lord Wills tonight
[39:38] that doesn't really look so good for
[39:40] some of those
[39:41] that were there with Jesus
[39:45] but it's not the middle of the journey
[39:48] that God's looking at
[39:51] he's looking
[39:52] at the Finish or the end of the journey
[39:54] and it just makes my heart so happy when
[39:57] I think about this and let's turn in our
[40:00] Bibles The Book of Luke God bless you
[40:02] thank you
[40:04] Brothers amen
[40:07] now see I'm so confused on this I gave
[40:10] brother Alex
[40:11] uh starting at verse six and then I come
[40:15] along and I'm like I should have just
[40:17] started at verse one but you know what
[40:20] the first five verses are although I
[40:23] want to draw out just a little bit there
[40:26] in verse 5 so that we have quite a
[40:29] lengthy reading
[40:30] so as we read Luke 24
[40:35] I'm going to say 1 through 33 because
[40:37] we'll touch upon this verse 5 says
[40:42] why seek ye
[40:44] the living among the Dead
[40:48] now as I've been just studying forward
[40:51] for like this service and other things
[40:54] that we're studying
[40:55] I hear the prophet of God talking about
[40:58] how
[40:59] that the spirit of the Lord the Holy
[41:02] Ghost used to dwell
[41:04] in the denominations
[41:06] and we see through all the church ages
[41:08] how that they come into a spirit of
[41:10] organization
[41:12] now it isn't always my brother and
[41:13] sister that the people actually joined
[41:17] an organization
[41:19] but they caught the spirit of it
[41:21] and the prophet says that that then
[41:24] bound the spirit the spirit moved on
[41:26] they stayed in their tradition
[41:28] and so we see now as these angels are
[41:32] speaking to these sisters
[41:35] and is telling them why seek ye the
[41:37] living among the Dead
[41:39] now we'll go into verse six he is not
[41:43] here
[41:44] but is risen
[41:45] remember how he spake unto you when he
[41:48] was yet in Galilee saying the son of man
[41:51] must be delivered into the hands of
[41:53] sinful men
[41:55] now get this these sinful men he's
[41:57] talking about were religious
[42:01] but sinful
[42:03] Lord help us and be crucified on the
[42:06] third day rise again
[42:08] and they remembered his word so they had
[42:11] a little Revival right there at the tomb
[42:13] because he stirred up their pure Minds
[42:17] in remembrance in their life that's
[42:19] right
[42:21] and return from the Sepulcher and told
[42:24] all these things into the eleven and all
[42:26] the to all the rest and it was Mary
[42:29] Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother
[42:31] of James and other women that were with
[42:33] them which told these things in to the
[42:36] apostles but it was just a bunch of
[42:38] sisters
[42:40] and so we believe them not
[42:45] isn't it amazing sometimes where the
[42:47] testimony must come from
[42:50] some of you are pretty quiet on that
[42:53] but you look at this right here they
[42:56] told
[42:58] we met an angel
[43:00] this is what happened and here's the 11
[43:02] caught up not caught up in a Clarity my
[43:05] brother and sister they're actually
[43:06] caught up in a mental chaos
[43:09] because to them they're like how could
[43:11] this happen why did this happen not
[43:14] catching the revelation of the words
[43:16] that have been told to them
[43:18] so what was missing there not the words
[43:20] revelation
[43:22] so we can have all of the words
[43:25] not have Revelation and be in a chaos in
[43:27] our mind
[43:28] amen
[43:30] so as it looks this then arose Peter and
[43:32] ran into the Sepulcher and stooping down
[43:34] he beheld the linen cloths laid by
[43:36] themselves and departed wandering in
[43:39] himself at which
[43:40] uh himself at that which was come to
[43:43] pass so even Peter caught in this this
[43:46] vortex
[43:48] caught in this like what how but Jesus
[43:50] been telling them
[43:52] he's been opening the word to them
[43:54] telling them this is what's going to
[43:57] happen and yet in that but we realize
[44:00] that God's got his hand it's all in
[44:01] control
[44:02] all in control
[44:04] and behold two of them that went Same
[44:06] Day to a village called Emmaus which was
[44:09] from Jerusalem about three score
[44:11] furlongs now there is just a tad bit of
[44:14] difference you might say in one part
[44:17] they say that Emmaus is eight miles from
[44:20] Jerusalem
[44:21] in some places they say it's seven miles
[44:24] but regardless just a nice walk
[44:28] um
[44:29] not you know like they went out to the
[44:31] mailbox
[44:33] they were committed this is the point I
[44:34] want to make they were committed in this
[44:36] walk
[44:39] Isn't it nice to be committed in your
[44:41] walk
[44:44] and they talked together of all these
[44:46] things which had happened and it came to
[44:48] pass that while they communed together
[44:50] and reason Jesus himself Drew near and
[44:53] went with them but their eyes were
[44:55] holding that they should not know him
[44:57] and he said unto them what manner of
[45:00] communications are these that ye
[45:03] Believers are having with one another
[45:11] let's go back further Gideon
[45:15] what manner of communications are these
[45:17] that ye have one to another as you walk
[45:24] greatest gift
[45:26] given to mankind
[45:31] and we're still sad
[45:37] we have the words
[45:39] we need the revelation
[45:46] that's right okay brother get in
[45:49] and one of them his name was Globe
[45:52] cleopas
[45:54] answering said unto him art thou only a
[45:57] stranger in Jerusalem and Hast not known
[45:59] the things which are come to pass there
[46:01] in these days and he said unto them what
[46:04] things
[46:05] oh don't tell me that our Lord Jesus
[46:07] Christ doesn't know how to frame a
[46:10] conversation
[46:13] he was like I want to hear your version
[46:17] what things
[46:21] and they said unto him concerning Jesus
[46:23] of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty
[46:26] indeed and word before God and all the
[46:30] people now listen these people who are
[46:32] walking along very sad have revelation
[46:35] but not all the Revelation necessary
[46:38] so they are there declaring that he was
[46:41] a prophet Mighty indeed and word before
[46:43] God and all the people and how the chief
[46:46] priests and our rulers delivered him to
[46:48] be condemned to death and have crucified
[46:51] him but we trusted that it had been he
[46:54] which should have redeemed Israel and
[46:56] beside all this today is the third day
[46:58] since these things were done
[47:01] yea and certain women also of our
[47:03] company made us astonished which were
[47:05] early at the Sepulcher and when they had
[47:08] found not his body they came saying that
[47:10] they had also seen a vision of angels
[47:13] which said that he was alive
[47:16] this is so good okay
[47:19] and certain of them which were with us
[47:21] went to the Sepulcher and found it even
[47:23] so as the women had said but him they
[47:26] saw not then he said unto them oh my
[47:29] goodness don't tell me people are like
[47:32] well if the Lord I'm telling you I'm
[47:34] going to make two statements right here
[47:36] I hope I'm not misunderstood if the
[47:38] Prophet come back like some say he must
[47:40] he would tear the hide off of us
[47:47] and they would then say this is not our
[47:50] Prophet because our Prophet is kind and
[47:52] loving
[47:53] if our lord Jesus
[47:55] come and Walked In the Flesh in our
[47:58] midst he would tear the hide off of us
[48:04] and the bride would say
[48:07] amen
[48:09] because she can't say
[48:11] any different
[48:13] because she is the word and the word is
[48:17] calling to the word and regardless my
[48:21] brother and sister of what crazy
[48:22] theologians are around today this book
[48:25] cannot counterdict itself and neither
[48:28] can the bride counterdict the one who
[48:33] wrote the word in her
[48:37] um
[48:38] makes me want to jump and Shout
[48:41] and he said unto them oh fools that must
[48:44] have stung
[48:45] slow of heart to believe all that the
[48:48] prophets have spoken
[48:49] ought not Christ who have suffered these
[48:51] things and to enter into his glory and
[48:54] beginning at Moses and all the prophets
[48:56] he expounded unto them in all the
[48:59] scriptures the things concerning himself
[49:01] and they drew nigh into the village
[49:04] whether they went and he made as though
[49:07] he would have gone further but I will
[49:10] touch on this I'm getting too carried
[49:12] away here but they constrained him
[49:14] saying abide with us for it is toward
[49:17] evening and the day is far spent and he
[49:19] went in to tarry with them amen and it
[49:23] came to pass as he sat at meat with them
[49:26] he took bread and blessed it and break
[49:29] and gave to them
[49:31] and their eyes
[49:33] Hallelujah at the breaking of the bread
[49:36] their eyes were opened and they knew him
[49:39] and he vanished out of their sight and
[49:42] they said to one another
[49:45] Trevor about jumped out of my seat
[49:50] did not our heart burn within us
[49:53] while he talked with us by the way and
[49:56] while he opened to us the scriptures and
[49:59] they rose up the same hour now it's
[50:01] night
[50:03] same hour and returned to Jerusalem and
[50:06] found the eleven gathered together and
[50:08] them that were with them we'll stop
[50:11] right there
[50:12] amen I hope you don't mind
[50:14] that I just tell you a story this
[50:16] evening Lord we ask for your blessings
[50:18] upon the word
[50:19] amen you may be seated Saints
[50:28] I just want to foreign
[50:30] on this
[50:33] I really struggled honestly I I really
[50:36] struggled on how to present this and the
[50:38] only way that I felt like I could really
[50:40] do justice to this was just come back
[50:43] and
[50:44] preach it
[50:45] speak it tell it
[50:48] amen as we see this we see the sisters
[50:51] they go their anointed to rise early go
[50:54] to the tomb
[50:55] and as they are there they meet these
[50:57] angels and my brother and sister the
[50:59] Angels had a message for them
[51:02] said right here to them as we already
[51:04] made a little emphasis he's not here
[51:07] but is risen remember how he spake unto
[51:10] you when he was yet in Galilee and
[51:12] you'll find a common theme my brother
[51:13] and sister that goes back all through
[51:15] the Bible and it is God's servants God's
[51:19] Messengers telling the people go back to
[51:22] the message you don't create a new
[51:24] message we don't create a new dialogue
[51:26] but always we're being pointed back to
[51:29] the word and so it's there that these
[51:31] angels being faithful men they are there
[51:34] and they are pointing them back to the
[51:36] word uh he's spoken to you when you was
[51:38] yet in Galilee and it stirred something
[51:41] in USA to remind us that uh yes we have
[51:44] heard the message and truly the
[51:46] scripture is such that we need our Pure
[51:49] Minds stirred up every once in a while
[51:51] just reminders people say don't you get
[51:54] tired of hearing that over and over
[51:56] again but my brother and sister it's not
[51:59] being tired of hearing it God is
[52:01] stirring it up I learned many years ago
[52:03] you know you might be at somebody's
[52:05] house and and you know they've got clam
[52:07] chowder and you know it's been simmering
[52:10] on the stove you know the first thing
[52:12] you do if you are a clam chowder
[52:14] connoisseur is you Stir It Up because
[52:17] the good stuff's in the bottom amen and
[52:20] God is constantly taking the word and
[52:23] stirring us up because it brings all of
[52:26] the word not just what might be on the
[52:28] surface but all of the word and brings
[52:31] it such that we can be partakers of all
[52:33] of the word and so as the Angels
[52:36] speaking to these sisters they go back
[52:39] and you know kind of make a little bit
[52:41] light but I don't really mean to you
[52:44] know they didn't believe them because it
[52:46] was so extraordinary but yet these were
[52:49] people that had seen the power of Jesus
[52:52] Christ The Gospel manifested before them
[52:55] they had saw it and yet they were still
[52:58] stunned they were still you know
[53:00] constantly being their senses being
[53:02] overwhelmed by what they saw and the
[53:05] Miracles that took place and you know my
[53:08] brother and sister reminds me of a Time
[53:10] the prophet I believe was in Georgia
[53:11] preaching and you know he was there and
[53:14] he calls out a sister calls her name
[53:18] calls her address and there was a person
[53:20] who knew that sister in the congregation
[53:23] and when brother Branham calls out and
[53:26] says now your sister so and so and you
[53:29] live at such and such at this city and
[53:32] the person that knew them said well he
[53:34] missed it there
[53:36] but little did they know until later
[53:39] that she had just moved
[53:43] and the Holy Spirit didn't have to go on
[53:46] the computer as it would be and look up
[53:48] you know Mary Jones
[53:51] and see where she lived God knew where
[53:54] she lived God knew what was necessary
[53:56] God knew to call her out it was God
[53:59] himself speaking through the prophet
[54:01] doing the Pauling doing the the
[54:04] beckoning as it were and revealing as it
[54:07] were secrets of the heart knowledge that
[54:09] would only be contained the critic won't
[54:11] know it amen the unbeliever won't know
[54:14] it but the believer knows it's God
[54:16] speaking for them and so it's here that
[54:19] we see now that Mary and the sisters are
[54:22] there and and they are there to tell
[54:24] this incredible story
[54:27] and yet it's so incredible
[54:29] they can't believe it but my brother and
[54:32] sister it's the third day
[54:34] if they had just remembered what they
[54:36] had been taught what Jesus had said but
[54:39] you know sometimes we can go on sensory
[54:41] overload it's just too overwhelming
[54:44] sister Jerry and I once again going
[54:46] through pictures and going through
[54:47] things and sharing things of being in
[54:50] Israel and and we're only now here all
[54:53] this time removed now looking at
[54:55] pictures starting to absorb some of the
[54:57] things that have been captured and we
[54:59] look at that and say wow this is so
[55:01] tremendous now imagine that you are
[55:04] there you've walked with Jesus you've
[55:06] seen the supernatural you've seen all
[55:08] these things take place you've seen him
[55:10] being judged you've seen the crucifixion
[55:13] and now someone says I have been to the
[55:16] tomb and it's empty and they would be
[55:18] going I saw him die
[55:21] because in spite of the words that had
[55:24] been spoken of a resurrection
[55:27] we're in a carnal world with a carnal
[55:29] mind with a carnal emotion and we can
[55:31] believe often times my brother and
[55:33] sister as brother Chris brought out we
[55:36] see things they're just a flicker but we
[55:38] can and we have a recall of that and we
[55:40] can say I saw
[55:44] and they have a hard time believing that
[55:46] the tomb is empty because the rock was
[55:48] large
[55:49] and they knew what it was
[55:52] and they didn't believe
[55:55] but I'm telling my brother and sister
[55:56] I'm glad tonight God does not judge us
[55:59] for our momentary unbeliefs
[56:01] he doesn't judge us for the lapse you
[56:03] might say of judgment
[56:05] but he comes and he forgives us for that
[56:08] and makes a way through that
[56:10] and as they go and they look at this
[56:13] Sepulcher
[56:14] they look in and the linen claws are
[56:16] laid there
[56:18] and even Peter wondered to himself what
[56:21] has come to pass what what happened now
[56:24] my brother and sister this is a man that
[56:26] our lord Jesus gave the keys to the
[56:28] kingdom the Kingdom's not looking too
[56:30] secure at the moment
[56:33] try
[56:34] because the man who has the keys doesn't
[56:37] have a clue what has happened
[56:40] now in the flesh would you trust the man
[56:43] that says I have the keys to everything
[56:45] and I don't know what's going on
[56:47] no in our flesh we would say oh okay but
[56:51] you see God knew and God had a plan and
[56:54] if we could see what God could see we
[56:56] could see our Footprints going right to
[56:59] the throne my brother and sister but God
[57:01] even as Believers with the veil taken
[57:04] down that we can see through the veil
[57:06] past the veil God still has not allowed
[57:09] us to see certain things because we are
[57:11] called to walk by faith
[57:13] amen if we walk by sight my brother and
[57:15] sister you know the devil would have
[57:18] took measure of the footprint and
[57:20] created his own that we would follow by
[57:22] sight
[57:24] but God says I want you to walk by faith
[57:26] and that faith is I already told you
[57:30] I already told you what will happen
[57:33] now I'm going to let you go through your
[57:35] ups and your Downs till you catch the
[57:37] revelation of what I've already told you
[57:43] mankind is still trying
[57:46] I don't blame them I study the message I
[57:48] sometimes just read over and over again
[57:50] I'm really proud of myself I I this is
[57:52] just a t TMI but I'm really proud of
[57:55] myself
[57:56] I just finally finished
[57:58] after about two months
[58:00] what will you do with this Jesus called
[58:02] Christ I finally finished it
[58:06] because I've read it over and over and
[58:08] over and over again because I know
[58:11] there's things in that message I'm not
[58:13] catching I want to know it I don't want
[58:16] a superficial View and move on
[58:19] just like I tell you how I feel about
[58:21] reading the Bible many people are like
[58:23] oh I've read the Bible every year for
[58:25] years my brother and sister I have made
[58:27] it through a few chapters this last year
[58:31] but I do believe God has laid on my
[58:33] heart the essence of what is in that
[58:36] chapter amen what the essence of what is
[58:39] there and I would rather have little and
[58:41] understand all of it than have a lot and
[58:43] understand little
[58:46] and so as we look at this we realize
[58:48] that even Peter the man who has the keys
[58:51] doesn't really know what has come to
[58:53] pass and then we got these two brothers
[58:55] over here that they decided you know
[58:58] what we're probably just going to go
[58:59] back where we came from we're going to
[59:01] go back you know uh there's this so much
[59:03] about this message that was there we had
[59:06] a messenger come we thought that he was
[59:09] going to be the Redemption of Israel and
[59:12] that fell apart we we know that he was a
[59:15] mighty man but you notice they didn't
[59:17] recognize him as Messiah they recognized
[59:20] him as Prophet they recognized him
[59:22] because they had heard the words that he
[59:25] prophesied and those words came to pass
[59:28] but they completely missed the words
[59:31] where he's laying the foundation I am
[59:34] your lamb
[59:35] I am your lamb they call they completely
[59:38] miss that Revelation but yet they said
[59:40] he was a Mighty Man a mighty prophet in
[59:43] word and indeed so they knew the words
[59:47] that he had spoken they saw the Deeds
[59:50] that he had performed and missed the
[59:53] revelation
[59:55] but God is faithful
[59:57] God is faithful he doesn't give us a a a
[1:00:00] a test and when we fail that test just
[1:00:03] say well I guess I was wrong when I
[1:00:05] wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:00:06] Life but God is faithful wooing us
[1:00:09] aren't you glad tonight can we lift a
[1:00:12] hand and say thank you Lord for wooing
[1:00:14] us amen I thank you Lord for your
[1:00:17] continual wooing of Paul amen hallelujah
[1:00:22] it's not just a one opportunity time
[1:00:25] and so as they are walking together now
[1:00:28] this my brother and sister is very much
[1:00:30] in the human element I I look at this
[1:00:33] and I I just can see this taking place
[1:00:35] so we got two brothers
[1:00:37] and they're just like you know what
[1:00:39] hey let's just go back
[1:00:42] it doesn't really say it's home so
[1:00:44] forgive me when I kind of use that
[1:00:45] phrase but let's just go back home
[1:00:48] now you have to understand
[1:00:50] that the road to Emmaus in our mind this
[1:00:53] is one of the interesting things about
[1:00:54] going to Israel and doing this research
[1:00:56] the road to Emmaus was more like a trail
[1:00:59] to Emmaus
[1:01:00] so you know we we get along and and you
[1:01:04] just think okay you know a road
[1:01:07] no here's the trail as it were I'm not
[1:01:10] contradicting scripture but I want to
[1:01:12] make the point to you the trail going
[1:01:14] back so they are walking along the trail
[1:01:18] and
[1:01:19] let's just face it there are certain
[1:01:21] things in life that bring little
[1:01:23] disappointments to us
[1:01:26] and they literally thought that they as
[1:01:28] they stood there and stood with Christ
[1:01:30] believed the words that he had spoken
[1:01:32] they thought that they were seeing a
[1:01:34] supernatural event take place
[1:01:38] and they were
[1:01:40] but it wasn't the event
[1:01:42] they had programmed in
[1:01:45] it wasn't the event they thought it was
[1:01:48] but the truth of it was
[1:01:50] he was the one that was going to redeem
[1:01:54] Israel
[1:01:55] he was the one that was going to perform
[1:01:57] that work but they missed the timepiece
[1:02:02] so as we walk along they walk along they
[1:02:06] were communing together and sometimes
[1:02:07] it's just lovely to have Fellowship I
[1:02:09] had some lovely Fellowship last night
[1:02:11] and as you as you walk along in life
[1:02:15] it's good you just have Fellowship that
[1:02:17] your heart is at peace and you you're
[1:02:19] just doing and they commune together and
[1:02:22] they reasoned and
[1:02:23] what they miss my brother and sister in
[1:02:25] their circumstances they had heard the
[1:02:27] word they had been in the presence of
[1:02:29] the word revealed but now they have kind
[1:02:32] of moved out from what the word revealed
[1:02:35] had give direction to and they've kind
[1:02:38] of Fallen back into more of a carnal
[1:02:40] position in their life I think somebody
[1:02:42] here could probably say amen I
[1:02:44] understand what that is fall back into
[1:02:46] that carnal position and so they're
[1:02:49] walking and they're talking uh no doubt
[1:02:51] I don't want to judge them or represent
[1:02:53] this incorrectly no I believe they were
[1:02:55] probably talking and reminding each
[1:02:57] other of Supernatural things that they
[1:03:00] had witnessed but there was also this
[1:03:02] element that was there that they were
[1:03:05] like well you know he had said this and
[1:03:07] I thought he would do this and that
[1:03:10] brings us to the ever present uh thought
[1:03:14] in this day and that is my brother and
[1:03:16] sister we need to confirm what someone
[1:03:18] says not what we thought they said
[1:03:21] right so I this is what I heard you say
[1:03:25] but what did you say and so they were
[1:03:28] there and they thought they heard Jesus
[1:03:30] say certain things and so they had acted
[1:03:34] and built you might say a experience
[1:03:37] around those things but they didn't
[1:03:39] realize that while the word is eternal
[1:03:41] that they were not at that time as it
[1:03:44] were in the flesh and so they're walking
[1:03:46] believing that Christ is going to be the
[1:03:49] the prophet that was going to come be
[1:03:51] the deliverer of Israel the only way you
[1:03:53] can really take that position is to
[1:03:55] recognize him as Messiah and they were
[1:03:57] looking at this great promise of what
[1:03:59] would take place and then it seemingly
[1:04:01] is done
[1:04:03] and they're walking along as it were you
[1:04:06] know remember that time we were there
[1:04:08] and remember the fishes and remember we
[1:04:11] were over here and remember that this
[1:04:13] took place and remember how that he
[1:04:16] discerned the hearts of this and
[1:04:17] remember the time that he told us if
[1:04:20] we'll go up into the village right there
[1:04:22] will be that cult that white Colton you
[1:04:24] just tell the owners it's for the master
[1:04:27] for the Lord and then no argument
[1:04:29] remember all these things that we saw
[1:04:31] it's a shame that has come to this here
[1:04:33] it's a shame I thought this is what was
[1:04:36] going to be and they're walking along
[1:04:38] conversing and I believe the ebb and the
[1:04:40] flow of the conversation was not all
[1:04:42] negative I believe that it was there
[1:04:45] because my brother and sister the reason
[1:04:47] I'm going to make this statement is I
[1:04:49] believe that God was there and God was
[1:04:51] pleased amen with what he was hearing so
[1:04:54] it wasn't all a bunch of negative
[1:04:56] conversation it takes us into the
[1:04:58] scripture when he says when we speak of
[1:05:00] him he draws an eye unto us and so you
[1:05:04] can be speaking negative and expect God
[1:05:06] to draw nigh unto you my brother and
[1:05:09] sister so there walking and speaking of
[1:05:11] the promise that they believed was to
[1:05:13] take place and they are baffled because
[1:05:16] they don't know why
[1:05:17] they have saws too much Supernatural Can
[1:05:20] someone say Amen so much Supernatural to
[1:05:24] deny it but yet sometimes feeling
[1:05:26] baffled about why things don't work out
[1:05:29] like they do
[1:05:31] and so it's there as they are walking
[1:05:33] along they don't even realize so
[1:05:36] consumed as it is in the conversation
[1:05:38] there's another person on the trail on
[1:05:41] the road with them oh my goodness my
[1:05:44] brother and sister he said I'll be with
[1:05:46] you even in you to the ends of the Earth
[1:05:49] he was walking all the time with them
[1:05:54] and in their conversation something
[1:05:56] brought it to a place that he said now
[1:05:58] is my time to appear to them they were
[1:06:01] conditioned my brother and sister maybe
[1:06:03] they'd had a moment in their own life
[1:06:05] and they start to recount that as we
[1:06:07] should amen not to be boastful but we
[1:06:10] should be recounting God delivered me of
[1:06:12] this all brothers and sisters God is a
[1:06:15] deliverer God has him God brother and
[1:06:17] sister God Is A Healer God is a provider
[1:06:21] I had a need and God's my provider
[1:06:24] and they start to confess this to one
[1:06:27] another
[1:06:28] in our lord Jesus just coming along the
[1:06:30] trail did he come from the side did he
[1:06:32] come from behind we don't know but what
[1:06:35] we do know is there come a point right
[1:06:37] there that they come into the presence
[1:06:40] of our Lord Jesus
[1:06:43] and he starts to walk with them
[1:06:45] now I don't know about you but maybe
[1:06:48] they enjoyed that extra company
[1:06:51] I know a lot of humans if you're having
[1:06:54] a conversation you don't really want a
[1:06:57] third spoke
[1:06:59] it would be like can't you see we're
[1:07:01] having a conversation
[1:07:04] oh I've done it to you guys so many
[1:07:05] times
[1:07:07] how don't feel bad but I walk up while
[1:07:10] you guys are laughing and you're talking
[1:07:11] and I walk up and it goes
[1:07:16] I don't think it's because it's me I
[1:07:18] think it's because it's just the third
[1:07:19] spoke of the conversation
[1:07:23] it's not me is it
[1:07:27] I hope not
[1:07:30] but he joins in
[1:07:32] and if you imagine you're walking down
[1:07:34] the trail
[1:07:36] and and you're there and you're talking
[1:07:39] in the you know step around a rock here
[1:07:41] and go and pretty soon you're back close
[1:07:43] again and then you're whatever and then
[1:07:46] here's another one he's walking he's
[1:07:48] right there in the presence and
[1:07:51] there's a
[1:07:52] there's a connection that is made
[1:07:57] and they commune together and they
[1:08:00] reasoned and Jesus himself Drew near and
[1:08:03] went with them
[1:08:05] but their eyes
[1:08:07] were holding that they should not know
[1:08:09] him
[1:08:10] isn't this amazing my brother and sister
[1:08:12] that how literally in the flesh you
[1:08:14] could be walking with someone
[1:08:17] and not even recognize them
[1:08:22] now in my flesh I'm I'm maybe a little
[1:08:25] different
[1:08:26] I might have you know met you and six
[1:08:29] months later I can't remember your name
[1:08:31] but I can look across through a crowd
[1:08:33] and say I know that person
[1:08:37] but it's an element that God used
[1:08:40] is using on Israel right now
[1:08:42] God used it on these brothers
[1:08:46] so that they would not move into a
[1:08:48] position of awe
[1:08:50] we're on the road to Emmaus it's Jesus
[1:08:54] oh my
[1:08:56] that God wanted them through the Veil
[1:08:59] to hear the word
[1:09:03] didn't want the emphasis to be it's
[1:09:06] Jesus standing here oh my sorry I gotta
[1:09:09] go I got to tell everybody I seen Jesus
[1:09:11] he wanted them to hear the word
[1:09:15] and so he takes them back through all
[1:09:18] the prophets back through the ages he
[1:09:21] takes them back through the word what's
[1:09:22] he doing he's stirring up pure Minds in
[1:09:25] remembrance and they are getting excited
[1:09:27] because what he's telling them is the
[1:09:30] truth and I can assure you they have
[1:09:32] never heard anyone
[1:09:34] besides Jesus ever bring the word with
[1:09:37] such clarity
[1:09:40] which is one of the things that brings
[1:09:41] us into the day that we live and I do
[1:09:43] not say this judgmentally but my brother
[1:09:45] and sister you'll hear conversations
[1:09:47] maybe even be somewhat a participant of
[1:09:50] a conversation and people have it oh
[1:09:52] God's here Jesus is here give me a new
[1:09:55] car give me a new house bless me here
[1:09:57] bless me there bless me there but where
[1:09:59] is the word that ever comes out and says
[1:10:02] you know what God's correcting me
[1:10:05] amen the TV people or God collected me
[1:10:09] that corrected me I ask you for a
[1:10:11] hundred million he corrected me now I
[1:10:13] want 500 million
[1:10:15] and they call that correction
[1:10:18] that you see God wanted them
[1:10:21] to be focused on the words being spoken
[1:10:23] so this man walking with him on the
[1:10:25] trail they must have been thinking this
[1:10:27] this guy knows the word he knows the
[1:10:30] Scrolls he knows the prophets he he
[1:10:32] knows this and they were blinded my
[1:10:34] brother and sister to to the fact of who
[1:10:37] it was it was speaking and I'm going to
[1:10:39] speak this maybe I should have him shut
[1:10:40] the recording off but I'm going to tell
[1:10:42] you I pray God blinds you and I to any
[1:10:46] man and keeps us focused to the word
[1:10:49] amen let us not see the man let us see
[1:10:52] the word
[1:10:53] and not just see the word but hear it
[1:10:56] and take it deep in our soul
[1:10:58] because we're human and we say well I'm
[1:11:00] not really a respecter of persons until
[1:11:02] we meet somebody we respect
[1:11:09] and then because we respect them so much
[1:11:11] we take everything they say as though it
[1:11:13] is the gospel
[1:11:15] and it might be but it's God that does
[1:11:17] the speaking
[1:11:18] it's God that is the word amen not the
[1:11:21] man
[1:11:22] and so they wouldn't know him and and he
[1:11:25] asked them you know imagine I wished I
[1:11:27] could preach had the confidence to
[1:11:28] preach to you guys like this
[1:11:30] oh maybe I am
[1:11:33] what manner of communications are thee
[1:11:35] that you have one to another as you walk
[1:11:39] actually what it is is verse 17 smote me
[1:11:42] in the heart as I'm studying this
[1:11:45] because I
[1:11:48] I can be a pretty Melancholy guy
[1:11:50] sometimes you know
[1:11:52] they call that well they have medical
[1:11:54] terms for that
[1:11:56] I don't believe I have that medical
[1:11:58] condition but I recognize in my life
[1:12:01] that when I am on an up
[1:12:05] I can be pretty happy
[1:12:07] when I'm on the down
[1:12:09] and I'd be walking Jesus be like what's
[1:12:12] wrong with you
[1:12:14] the whole time my brother and sister
[1:12:16] I have the word
[1:12:18] I have the life I have the nature
[1:12:22] what do I have to be sad about
[1:12:25] I'll just be blunt with you it happens
[1:12:28] when we look at the flesh
[1:12:32] and so Paul is making a confession
[1:12:34] before Grace Tabernacle tonight that I
[1:12:37] must be according to the word I must be
[1:12:39] looking in the flesh more than God wants
[1:12:42] me to look in the flesh because if Jesus
[1:12:46] Christ had come with me as it were on
[1:12:49] yesterday he would have said why are you
[1:12:52] talking like you are talking
[1:12:56] Can someone say Amen with me
[1:13:02] but the thing that go on houses got it
[1:13:04] all in control
[1:13:07] amen
[1:13:08] he said oh that's all right
[1:13:11] compared to where they were 20 years ago
[1:13:14] I have changed them
[1:13:17] I've been changed I've been Reborn
[1:13:22] all my life has been rearranged
[1:13:27] but what we do we look right now and we
[1:13:29] want it to be a certain way and we want
[1:13:30] this turn out like this and we do this
[1:13:32] and then we go well well you know and
[1:13:34] it's called the pastor Monday kind of
[1:13:36] thing you know it's like well I just
[1:13:38] thought more people should have said
[1:13:39] amen when I said this
[1:13:42] and I read this quote and I they should
[1:13:44] all just jumped out of their seat and
[1:13:46] screamed amen and
[1:13:48] and the devil's like
[1:13:51] keep talking
[1:13:52] keep talking you're doing a great job
[1:13:54] you're doing a great job
[1:13:57] and the prophet said
[1:13:59] don't even
[1:14:01] how does that quote go
[1:14:03] don't speak
[1:14:06] don't even speak the devil's language
[1:14:09] oh my that hurts I mean I can walk
[1:14:12] around
[1:14:13] right after I've said I can fix this and
[1:14:16] I broke it worse
[1:14:18] and I could walk around and actually
[1:14:21] find myself as a Son of God talking
[1:14:24] the devils language
[1:14:28] and I Think Jesus was really in a sense
[1:14:30] kind of poking these Brothers
[1:14:34] because why are you why are you talking
[1:14:38] of all this and why are you sad
[1:14:41] and cleopas says you know well look I'm
[1:14:44] you being a stranger must not absolutely
[1:14:46] must not understand what's happening to
[1:14:49] the message churches in laodicea
[1:14:52] you don't know what happened over here
[1:14:54] and you don't know what happened over
[1:14:55] here and uh you know there was this man
[1:14:57] you know called Jesus and uh it was
[1:15:01] there and we understand you being a
[1:15:03] stranger wouldn't have a clue of what is
[1:15:05] going on but I you know uh these things
[1:15:07] that have took place in these last few
[1:15:09] days you know uh Jesus well you know he
[1:15:13] was a prophet Mighty indeed in word
[1:15:15] before God and the people and uh how the
[1:15:18] chief priests overpowered him
[1:15:20] the chief priests laid a trap the chief
[1:15:23] the church the religious people they did
[1:15:27] this and and you know it's just terrible
[1:15:29] because we were sure that Jesus was
[1:15:32] going to be the one who set everything
[1:15:35] right set us free
[1:15:38] they had the right word
[1:15:41] wrong time wrong revelation
[1:15:44] God help us
[1:15:46] amen not to go jumping off the cliff
[1:15:48] because we've decided my goodness my
[1:15:51] brother and sister forgive me to bring
[1:15:52] this up but you know uh we have we have
[1:15:55] people who believe it's already we're
[1:15:57] already in the millennium
[1:16:00] and I'm telling you you know you run
[1:16:02] into town to pick up some parts or go to
[1:16:05] the bank or whatever and and you're
[1:16:06] there and I don't understand my brother
[1:16:09] and sister what anoints people but in
[1:16:11] this day and age there would be young
[1:16:14] people that would be out on the street
[1:16:16] with the clothes that they should be
[1:16:18] wearing or what shouldn't even be
[1:16:20] wearing ever but uh you know summer time
[1:16:23] and you're like what is wrong here
[1:16:25] there's something there's an insanity
[1:16:27] taking place and and we can't fathom it
[1:16:31] almost causes the neurons in our brain
[1:16:33] to start popping because it's like this
[1:16:35] is insanity
[1:16:37] and they stand there and the Goosebumps
[1:16:40] and they shiver
[1:16:42] and it's like you know what when I was a
[1:16:44] little kid I was at least smart enough
[1:16:45] to know you wear clothes in the
[1:16:47] wintertime
[1:16:50] but take that into a spiritual Realm
[1:16:56] naked
[1:16:58] and don't even know it
[1:17:01] so what's going on in the inside my
[1:17:04] brother and sister is being manifested
[1:17:06] on the outside and the people that say
[1:17:09] oh no we're already in the Millennium
[1:17:10] I'm sorry they are deceived not simple
[1:17:15] because God in the Millennium if we
[1:17:18] would be in the Millennium and have to
[1:17:20] deal with this world right here then
[1:17:23] what would be the Cry of our soul to
[1:17:26] come in the presence of God a cry of
[1:17:29] Holiness and righteousness to live out
[1:17:31] before God why would that cry be there
[1:17:33] if all we got was more of the same
[1:17:39] and they're walking along there and
[1:17:41] Jesus starts to lay this word out to him
[1:17:44] and and they're they're saying this is
[1:17:46] why we're sad this is why it is and the
[1:17:49] chief priests and the rulers delivered
[1:17:51] him to be condemned to death and have
[1:17:53] crucified him but my brother and sister
[1:17:55] let me remind you this message right
[1:17:57] here had already told them exactly what
[1:18:01] was going to take place but their eyes
[1:18:04] were veiled for the season and think
[1:18:07] about you and I
[1:18:09] how that there's things that God still
[1:18:11] is dealing with us
[1:18:13] God is still bringing things to light in
[1:18:16] our life and and it's that continual
[1:18:18] Revelation amen inexhaustible supply of
[1:18:22] the revelation of Jesus Christ amen I
[1:18:25] believe we'll be with him for eternity
[1:18:27] and still won't know
[1:18:29] everything
[1:18:37] and there were certain women
[1:18:39] oh let me back up
[1:18:41] the third day plays into this how many
[1:18:44] times did he tell them the third day
[1:18:47] I'll rise again
[1:18:48] I'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:18:50] except for God did not want it that way
[1:18:53] in our mind today because we get to look
[1:18:55] back at that you would have almost
[1:18:57] thought every one of them at the rising
[1:19:00] of the sun would have been standing at
[1:19:03] the tomb
[1:19:08] said he said
[1:19:10] but you see
[1:19:12] the Revelation was still working its way
[1:19:16] down
[1:19:18] to the soul
[1:19:20] and it touched on the mind and they knew
[1:19:22] he was a Mighty Man
[1:19:25] they saw the words I heard the word saw
[1:19:27] the Deeds but hadn't
[1:19:29] reached
[1:19:31] the betting ground
[1:19:33] and so in that place right there they're
[1:19:35] still in a chaos of their thoughts
[1:19:38] and so
[1:19:39] then they declare that these women
[1:19:44] they made us astonished which were early
[1:19:46] at the Sepulcher and they found not his
[1:19:48] body they came and they told us hey
[1:19:50] we've seen this vision of angels that
[1:19:53] said he was alive and
[1:19:55] some of us went down there to the
[1:19:56] Sepulcher and we founded just like it
[1:19:59] said there's the grave close
[1:20:01] the stone is rolled away
[1:20:05] and that brings Jesus right to this
[1:20:07] little Apex
[1:20:10] you fools
[1:20:13] my
[1:20:15] I wouldn't really want to be preached to
[1:20:17] that way
[1:20:19] you know to sit there and be called the
[1:20:21] fool
[1:20:22] fact the scripture says call no man fool
[1:20:25] but God's dealing with them in a certain
[1:20:27] fashion
[1:20:28] and he tells them
[1:20:32] oh fools and slow of heart to believe
[1:20:34] all the prophets have spoken
[1:20:37] ought not Christ have suffered these
[1:20:39] things and to enter into his glory
[1:20:42] now remember my brother and sister
[1:20:43] they're still hearing the words of what
[1:20:46] they think is a very wise man speaking
[1:20:50] to them they have no clue
[1:20:54] they have no clue
[1:20:57] and so it breaks it all down beginning
[1:21:00] Moses the prophets expounds to them the
[1:21:03] scripture the things concerning himself
[1:21:05] and as they drew nigh to the into the
[1:21:07] village whether they went which was
[1:21:09] Emmaus and he made as though he would
[1:21:11] have gone further what he was doing my
[1:21:14] brother and sister is setting a stage
[1:21:15] for them and the words that they had
[1:21:18] heard him speak along the way and they
[1:21:21] went and registered deep enough that
[1:21:23] they would say I want to hear more word
[1:21:25] you realize how special we are saints
[1:21:28] that God has anointed us that we day
[1:21:31] after day week after week month after
[1:21:33] month year after year have something
[1:21:35] inside of us that is staying no don't
[1:21:37] depart from us we want to hear more word
[1:21:39] we need more word don't leave don't
[1:21:43] leave say I need more word
[1:21:47] and that anointing that was there Jesus
[1:21:49] sets the stage as though he's going on
[1:21:51] and what it does is brings them into a
[1:21:54] moment of decision and their decision is
[1:21:56] I gotta hear more of this you got to
[1:21:59] stay with us don't leave us
[1:22:01] and I'm glad tonight I can say that our
[1:22:04] hearts cry is Lord don't take your word
[1:22:06] from us Lord don't let it ever leave us
[1:22:09] don't let it leave our thoughts don't
[1:22:11] let it leave our presence don't let it
[1:22:13] ever leave our souls Lord I need more
[1:22:15] word
[1:22:16] and I believe that will be the Cry of
[1:22:18] the Bride right on through eternity we
[1:22:20] will want to be in his presence we won't
[1:22:22] be frolicking people have the idea we're
[1:22:25] just going to go Frolic all over heaven
[1:22:27] like it's a giant picnic my brother and
[1:22:29] sister the desire God is placed in the
[1:22:31] heart of the Bride she's going to say I
[1:22:33] want to be close to my bridegroom I want
[1:22:35] to be close to that I Marvel sometimes
[1:22:38] now don't take this serious I'm using it
[1:22:40] for an example but I Marvel sometimes in
[1:22:43] my annoyance that sister Jerry still I
[1:22:45] want to be in your presence
[1:22:50] you understand where I'm coming from
[1:22:52] it's a love bridegroom bride
[1:22:56] the desire is there I need more I want
[1:23:00] more I want the presence
[1:23:03] now as we look at this my brother and
[1:23:04] sister a very great event is fixing to
[1:23:08] take place
[1:23:09] because as they come and they come to
[1:23:12] this point it's towards the evening time
[1:23:14] the day is done amen
[1:23:20] they have traveled
[1:23:22] from the East
[1:23:24] to the West
[1:23:26] Emmaus is Northwest of Jerusalem
[1:23:31] they have traveled from the East to the
[1:23:33] West
[1:23:34] and at the setting of the Sun
[1:23:37] there comes a voice
[1:23:42] a voice and a bride
[1:23:44] is crying out for
[1:23:47] not a voice to say I heard the voice
[1:23:48] everything's well I'm going to go on my
[1:23:50] way but a voice that she says don't
[1:23:52] depart from me
[1:23:54] Lord don't forsake me don't walk away
[1:23:57] from me you've got to stay
[1:24:00] my soul is hungry
[1:24:06] now they would be hungry in the flesh
[1:24:09] but much more they showed they were
[1:24:11] hungry in their spirit and their souls
[1:24:15] don't depart please keep telling us
[1:24:17] speak to us now I think my brother and
[1:24:20] sister that this is as I'm preaching
[1:24:23] this I hope this makes sense I am making
[1:24:25] sense but they look at this and they're
[1:24:28] declaring this abide with us
[1:24:30] and they offer it's toward evening and
[1:24:34] the day is far spent my brother and
[1:24:36] sister God has opened our eyes in this
[1:24:39] day right now to realize how close or
[1:24:42] how far into the evening time that we
[1:24:45] are amen and the day is for spent the
[1:24:48] years of our nation being a great nation
[1:24:51] we can look through the history and I'm
[1:24:53] happy to have been born here in this
[1:24:55] Valley I've been happy to have been
[1:24:57] raised in in the world that we live in
[1:24:59] my brother and sister but it's far spent
[1:25:02] amen all the life the energy all of that
[1:25:06] anointing that God placed in this nation
[1:25:07] in the beginning is far spent and we're
[1:25:11] coming down as a Twilight season coming
[1:25:13] down to these things and recognizing
[1:25:17] my brother and sister
[1:25:19] I'll say this I don't know if this will
[1:25:21] make the young people feel better or
[1:25:22] worse
[1:25:24] but as a young kid sitting in church
[1:25:28] I never thought I'd get married I never
[1:25:30] thought I'd finish school and that when
[1:25:31] I got right
[1:25:33] but
[1:25:34] I never thought I'd get married
[1:25:36] because the Lord's coming
[1:25:39] now this didn't do me so well in the
[1:25:41] sense of being kind of teetering on the
[1:25:43] fence and whatever but you know it's
[1:25:45] like well I'll never get married I got
[1:25:48] married or we'll never have children the
[1:25:50] Lord's coming we had children
[1:25:52] well probably never see our children
[1:25:54] grow up our children grew up and all of
[1:25:56] these little factors that took place
[1:25:58] that kept moving forward now in the
[1:26:01] position I was at that stage of my life
[1:26:03] I say it was detrimental but God's in
[1:26:05] control amen but I look at that always
[1:26:07] pushing the ball I was kicking the ball
[1:26:09] out in front of me always kicking the
[1:26:11] ball out in front of me but my brother
[1:26:12] and sister what God was doing that whole
[1:26:14] time he was leading me and leading you
[1:26:16] down the road to Emmaus because our
[1:26:19] appointment was not in Jerusalem our
[1:26:22] appointment was not along the trail
[1:26:24] somewhere our appointment was at Emmaus
[1:26:27] amen it was there at that particular
[1:26:29] time and that particular place and I
[1:26:32] want you to understand they didn't go by
[1:26:34] Safeway or Costco and pick up a little
[1:26:36] bread the bread was waiting for them
[1:26:39] now bread was already present it just
[1:26:42] needed to be broken and it wasn't just
[1:26:44] to break the bread but the bread had to
[1:26:47] be eaten amen and God has saw that we
[1:26:50] have been traveling this road and we're
[1:26:52] coming to a stage to a place to a time
[1:26:55] to a circumstance and the word amen the
[1:26:58] bread of life is waiting for us and we
[1:27:01] can take that bread and when it is
[1:27:03] broken for us now catch this I don't
[1:27:05] want to I don't want to misspeak this
[1:27:08] I don't want to misspeak this and it
[1:27:10] came to pass he said it meet with him
[1:27:12] and he took bread and blessed it and
[1:27:14] break
[1:27:18] got the bread
[1:27:21] but it didn't open their eyes
[1:27:24] until he gave it to him
[1:27:27] all people I have Revelation I have
[1:27:29] Revelation no my brother and sister we
[1:27:31] have Revelation when God gives us
[1:27:32] Revelation and the prophet of God says
[1:27:35] you pray for Revelation and God will
[1:27:36] give you Revelation so we don't have to
[1:27:38] sit back and say I'm waiting to get the
[1:27:40] bread we got to enter in amen and the
[1:27:43] bread is there we've got to reach out
[1:27:44] and take that bread and we have to take
[1:27:47] it and start feeding amen start feeding
[1:27:51] on the body word amen we've got to start
[1:27:54] feeding on that amen and when we feed on
[1:27:57] that our eyes amen their eyes were open
[1:27:59] and they knew him and he vanished but
[1:28:03] did he leave them
[1:28:04] no he made the promise I'll never leave
[1:28:06] you and never forsake you so while they
[1:28:09] couldn't see him with their eyes and
[1:28:10] they're sitting now in that little house
[1:28:12] in Emmaus and they're sitting there
[1:28:14] their eyes have been opened Revelation
[1:28:17] has come to them they realize he's risen
[1:28:20] that's right what did the Angels say in
[1:28:22] the beginning oh if we could just cut
[1:28:24] this down to the Bare Bones and just
[1:28:26] have been able to take a halt of that
[1:28:27] and say the angels from the Lord said he
[1:28:30] is risen and we believe it but God had
[1:28:34] to lead him down a road and they had to
[1:28:36] come back as a witness to other brothers
[1:28:38] and sisters that have been buffeted by
[1:28:40] laodicea
[1:28:41] been buffeted by laodicea and they're
[1:28:44] not sure today whether he's risen or not
[1:28:46] and they certainly don't feel he's been
[1:28:47] risen in them but I tell you there's got
[1:28:49] to be a witness amen I wish I'd brought
[1:28:52] my phone out share that little quote
[1:28:54] today it struck me so powerful amen we
[1:28:58] don't want to leave our loved ones amen
[1:29:02] we are not going to leave them and walk
[1:29:05] away from that my brother and sister
[1:29:06] we're gonna dig in because of revelation
[1:29:10] God gave us on the road to Emmaus what
[1:29:13] happened after they were there in Emmaus
[1:29:15] they sat down they ate the bread what
[1:29:17] did they do it's late amen they're
[1:29:20] turning in they're sitting down because
[1:29:22] they're tired they're hungry they're
[1:29:23] doing this but Revelation put them back
[1:29:26] on the road to go back to their brothers
[1:29:28] and sisters and say he's risen oh
[1:29:32] brothers and sisters he's risen
[1:29:35] amen the sisters were right
[1:29:39] saw it for myself
[1:29:41] he's risen
[1:29:44] oh Hallelujah I'm telling you I'm glad
[1:29:47] we didn't stop any mayus and decide to
[1:29:50] make a Doctrine praise the Lord we're
[1:29:52] the last ones
[1:29:54] we're the ones that got the revelation
[1:29:57] he broke the bread to us not you
[1:30:02] what nonsense in the world we live in
[1:30:04] today
[1:30:06] what nonsense
[1:30:10] have brothers ask you crazy questions
[1:30:12] like
[1:30:13] when was your church founded
[1:30:17] I really don't know I mean it was its
[1:30:19] name was here and it got changed and
[1:30:21] then we changed it back I don't know
[1:30:23] where to put the little pin at
[1:30:26] well praise God our church has been
[1:30:28] following the message for 60 years
[1:30:33] well that used to just blow me away I
[1:30:34] would just be like oh wow what do I say
[1:30:39] now I want to ask him you've been
[1:30:42] following the message how long
[1:30:44] right how long have you had the message
[1:30:46] in you
[1:30:49] that's the only thing that matters
[1:30:51] amen we can acknowledge God's Center
[1:30:54] Prophet from the day that the prophet
[1:30:56] came on this scene could have somebody
[1:30:58] there to acknowledge that it don't
[1:31:00] matter if it's not in US
[1:31:02] now I'm going to take this as a little
[1:31:03] step out if you don't mind
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:06] they didn't have any real revelation of
[1:31:09] whose presence they were in the
[1:31:12] influence it was having the anointing
[1:31:14] and where it came from
[1:31:15] until figurative just let me take this
[1:31:19] until they took that bite
[1:31:23] of the word
[1:31:26] and when they started eating the book
[1:31:31] oh my they must go on the way back to
[1:31:34] Emmaus thought oh mercy he told us here
[1:31:38] he told us there he explained to us what
[1:31:40] was going to happen here here and here
[1:31:42] and we didn't get it
[1:31:45] but give me another bite of the book
[1:31:49] life changing
[1:31:51] when we have the bread now I'm going to
[1:31:52] just call this good I have no idea well
[1:31:54] praise God we're not too far over
[1:31:57] amen I'm just going to call it there I
[1:31:59] believe that you have understanding what
[1:32:01] has been laying on my heart
[1:32:03] amen I tell you my brother and sister
[1:32:07] I just love there's there's a couple
[1:32:09] things I just love about this
[1:32:11] how that our lord Jesus
[1:32:16] is walking along and they're talking
[1:32:18] about oh life is terrible
[1:32:22] what things
[1:32:25] can I ask you tonight
[1:32:28] what things
[1:32:29] Paul are you listening yes I am
[1:32:33] by God's grace
[1:32:35] what things possibly can enter our life
[1:32:41] to cause us
[1:32:43] to frown
[1:32:45] in the presence of the king
[1:32:51] now this is going to be one of those
[1:32:52] things Paul's going to have to live out
[1:32:54] I say that with a little humor come
[1:32:57] tomorrow come tonight I don't know when
[1:32:58] but I'll be faced with this very words
[1:33:00] but I'm telling you I know my own heart
[1:33:02] and I know my own desire now amen
[1:33:04] because God has given me a desire to
[1:33:07] serve him giving me a desire for his
[1:33:09] word given me a desire to live amen and
[1:33:12] dwell and my brother and sister be able
[1:33:14] to say Amen to the word of God and with
[1:33:18] that gift
[1:33:19] what is laodicea have
[1:33:24] to take that away from us
[1:33:27] only what
[1:33:29] we give him
[1:33:32] Lord help me
[1:33:35] help me
[1:33:36] be like the little kid with the marbles
[1:33:40] I want more
[1:33:42] you know do you ever play marbles you
[1:33:44] know and they had that I don't remember
[1:33:45] even what they called it or whatever but
[1:33:47] the time you know you could kind of
[1:33:48] claim them man the big kids would just
[1:33:51] jump on top the pile of marbles and you
[1:33:53] know I can't get no marbles but when you
[1:33:55] got desperate enough and you had that
[1:33:57] one that they called the Blue Steely
[1:34:01] my you fought scratched bit kicked
[1:34:06] because you wanted it so bad
[1:34:09] what has Satan got to keep the word
[1:34:12] from us with this kind of Desire
[1:34:15] for the word
[1:34:17] Amen brother Gideon will you put that
[1:34:19] quote you have right here on the screen
[1:34:21] put it up
[1:34:24] anointed ones at the end time do you
[1:34:26] guys know anybody
[1:34:31] thank you Lord I know some anointed ones
[1:34:35] amen it's the end time
[1:34:37] all we got to do is look around see is
[1:34:39] there any anointed ones and I I look out
[1:34:41] and I see anointed once amen I look at
[1:34:44] those I have a heart that's burning for
[1:34:45] the Lord
[1:34:47] I wasn't the one that appeared down on
[1:34:49] the river this brother Brian I'm
[1:34:50] speaking now I wasn't the one that
[1:34:52] appeared down on the river I was only
[1:34:54] standing there when he appeared
[1:34:58] amen my to all those people that think
[1:34:59] we made him God
[1:35:03] my I guess it's easy to cherry pick I'm
[1:35:07] not the one that performs these things
[1:35:09] and foretells these things that happens
[1:35:10] as perfectly they are I'm only one
[1:35:13] that's near when he doesn't I was only a
[1:35:16] voice that he used to say it it wasn't
[1:35:18] what I knew it's what I just surrendered
[1:35:22] myself to that he spoke through it
[1:35:25] wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh
[1:35:28] no it was the manifestation of the son
[1:35:31] of man and you'll find my brother and
[1:35:33] sister there's people around the message
[1:35:34] that don't have an actual revelation of
[1:35:37] that
[1:35:39] don't want to confuse anybody but my
[1:35:42] brother and sister it wasn't the man we
[1:35:43] know as William Branham
[1:35:45] it was almighty God come down and said
[1:35:48] I'm going to use these vocal cords I'm
[1:35:51] going to use these lungs I'm going to
[1:35:53] use this voice
[1:35:55] amen I'm going to use him and the
[1:35:57] prophet himself says God could have used
[1:35:59] anyone
[1:36:04] I just surrendered myself that he spoke
[1:36:06] through it wasn't me it wasn't the
[1:36:08] seventh angel oh no it was the
[1:36:10] manifestation of the son of man it
[1:36:13] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:36:16] mystery that God unfolded Amen now look
[1:36:19] at this you know the Apostle Paul is
[1:36:21] speaking and he declares to us such a
[1:36:23] lovely scripture amen that the mystery
[1:36:29] can somebody tell me what the mystery is
[1:36:36] you're all correct
[1:36:38] but the real fulfillment of the mystery
[1:36:41] is Christ
[1:36:43] in you
[1:36:46] not just that he's present
[1:36:48] he's always got to have a vessel
[1:36:51] that he uses that's what he doesn't have
[1:36:53] to let me rephrase that he chooses
[1:36:55] he chooses to use a vessel
[1:36:58] so we look at this now what was it the
[1:37:00] manifestation of the son of man
[1:37:03] it wasn't the angel his message it was a
[1:37:05] mystery that God unfold it's not a man
[1:37:07] it's God the angel was not the son of
[1:37:10] man he was the messenger from the son of
[1:37:12] man the son of man is Christ he is the
[1:37:15] one that you're feeding on you're not
[1:37:18] feeding on a man a man his words will
[1:37:21] fail but you're feeding on the unfailing
[1:37:24] body word of the son of man oh my
[1:37:28] brother and sister maybe I'm taking a
[1:37:30] stretch of this but I'm telling you I
[1:37:33] would love oh I believe it has happened
[1:37:35] that the word has been broken and it has
[1:37:38] been offered to you and I amen and in
[1:37:41] that offering to you and I God give us
[1:37:43] Revelation to realize and recognize who
[1:37:46] Jesus Christ is amen we're not over here
[1:37:49] to glorify a prophet we're not over here
[1:37:51] to take all glory from a prophet we're
[1:37:53] here to find the center of the road and
[1:37:56] know that by God's grace he chose a man
[1:37:58] that his words and his presentation we
[1:38:00] could understand but it was God's
[1:38:02] speaking to us and at the breaking of
[1:38:05] the bread we saw him
[1:38:07] oh at the breaking of the bread he was
[1:38:10] revealed to you and I that we can stand
[1:38:12] to say and say I know not man but I know
[1:38:16] Christ amen to stand upon that revealed
[1:38:19] word and have confidence amen because
[1:38:22] I'm telling you I just struggle with men
[1:38:24] complex maybe for my childhood I
[1:38:27] struggle with men and it's that realm
[1:38:29] right there my brother and sister if we
[1:38:31] was to follow a man I would be so
[1:38:33] critical of that man because I could not
[1:38:36] be able to Bear him making mistakes
[1:38:40] and yet you think about this I preached
[1:38:43] to you service after service
[1:38:45] and I make mistakes
[1:38:47] why do you bear with me
[1:38:50] I want you to catch this why do you bear
[1:38:52] with me
[1:38:54] maybe I'm being too bold but I don't
[1:38:56] believe so
[1:38:57] you bear with me because you don't see
[1:39:00] me and I'm not talking about how
[1:39:01] spiritual I am you know that I am
[1:39:05] breaking the bread I didn't make the
[1:39:08] bread I didn't do anything the bread God
[1:39:11] just called me called ministers in this
[1:39:13] church to take the bread and break it
[1:39:16] down and give it and it never was my
[1:39:18] brother and sister about that it was
[1:39:21] about the revelation of receiving that
[1:39:24] broken word that body word of the son of
[1:39:27] man and we receive that
[1:39:30] oh Hallelujah and our life has changed
[1:39:33] amen we see Christ with Clarity and
[1:39:36] people are saying well we follow this
[1:39:38] and we do this and what about that and
[1:39:40] you're there saying sorry that doesn't
[1:39:41] mean anything to me
[1:39:45] we're not disrespecting that I believe
[1:39:47] you understand that
[1:39:50] but it's not the significance
[1:39:52] this broken
[1:39:54] to us amen is what brings Joy Amen to
[1:39:59] our souls Hallelujah brother Alex
[1:40:03] a manner whoever I don't know
[1:40:06] Alex in the back
[1:40:08] amen let's look at this my brother and
[1:40:10] sister
[1:40:12] amen
[1:40:14] the one that had been trusted to redeem
[1:40:16] Israel
[1:40:19] there's great movements taking place in
[1:40:21] Israel right now
[1:40:23] but where
[1:40:24] God starts to move the counterfeit
[1:40:26] always Rises up
[1:40:29] and there's a counterfeit movement now
[1:40:31] in Israel
[1:40:33] very public very open very vocal very
[1:40:36] well funded and people are saying we
[1:40:39] recognize now that Jesus is our Messiah
[1:40:42] but they're taking them
[1:40:45] to the trinity
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:49] they're not breaking bread to them
[1:40:51] saints
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:54] they're not breaking
[1:40:55] the word
[1:40:57] to them
[1:40:58] amen now look at the closing lines here
[1:41:03] that the prophet speaks
[1:41:05] he said if you haven't fed fully on
[1:41:07] every word
[1:41:10] to give your strength to give yourself
[1:41:12] strength to Fly Above All these
[1:41:14] denominations and things of the world
[1:41:17] will you at this time do it
[1:41:23] brother Branham doesn't chastise them
[1:41:25] [Music]
[1:41:27] for whatever Spirits have been he just
[1:41:31] tells them you know what if you haven't
[1:41:33] been fully feeding
[1:41:36] and Grace
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:38] I believe tonight we ought to stop and
[1:41:41] examine ourselves
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:44] Lord help me to fully feed on the word
[1:41:47] help me let it be we're humans we we
[1:41:50] maybe have a magazine maybe you like to
[1:41:52] make floral arrangements or you like to
[1:41:54] do a little something or whatever you
[1:41:57] know we don't want to be so legalist to
[1:41:59] say you can't take a moment
[1:42:02] to understand how to make a beautiful
[1:42:05] bouquet
[1:42:07] but the core of our life
[1:42:10] should be focused
[1:42:12] on him
[1:42:18] now I want to just throw I kind of
[1:42:20] skipped over this earlier I want to just
[1:42:21] throw this to you
[1:42:22] the modern Church the one that the
[1:42:24] prophet said was going along to the
[1:42:26] spirit of rock and roll
[1:42:28] on the way to Emmaus

[1:42:51] been
[1:42:52] their conversation on the road to Emmaus
