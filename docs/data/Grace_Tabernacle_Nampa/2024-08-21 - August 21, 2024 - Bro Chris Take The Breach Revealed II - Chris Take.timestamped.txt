[8:29] amen you can just have your seats for
[8:31] just a
[8:32] moment give brother Ivan a chance to
[8:34] pull up my
[8:38] slides it's good to see be with all of
[8:41] you see I checked it on my own and maybe
[8:45] we to update our PowerPoint on the
[8:46] church
[8:48] computer so he'll have to adjust it a
[8:51] little
[8:51] bit
[8:54] um amen sister Alice I met your sister
[8:57] in at BCF and uh she I hope I'm okay and
[9:00] saying this she walked up and shake my
[9:02] hand and I was like why do I know this
[9:04] sister and she told me so that was that
[9:08] was awesome good to see you God bless
[9:11] you amen I last time I spoke
[9:15] um I uh like brother Paul said I usually
[9:19] Wednesdays we get um and I apologize
[9:23] some of this formatting is going to be
[9:24] off because I'm an Apple guy so I build
[9:26] my slides in keynote and I have to sh
[9:29] them to PowerPoint so let's all vote we
[9:32] uh put some kind of technology in here
[9:34] that I don't have to do that I can just
[9:37] cast right to
[9:38] it um so praise the Lord why don't we
[9:41] stand then tonight since he's ready and
[9:44] I would like to take U part two off of
[9:46] last service and um I went ahead and
[9:48] shortened our title to the breach
[9:51] revealed and I'd like to take the
[9:53] subject of the conflict at the word
[9:55] transition so if you have your Bibles
[9:57] one quick um
[10:00] scripture we have here in Revelations he
[10:02] says he that hath an ear let him hear
[10:05] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[10:07] to him that overcometh will I give to
[10:08] eat of the Hidden mana and will give him
[10:11] a white stone and in the stone a new
[10:13] name written which no man knoweth saying
[10:15] saving he that receive it receiveth it
[10:19] and if you remember the vision or the
[10:21] dream that Junior Jackson has um while
[10:23] this scripture is to the Philadelphia
[10:25] Church age I believe this it's the same
[10:28] applies to us that that Whit Stone has
[10:30] been revealed and been opened up for us
[10:33] amen Matthew chapter
[10:37] 24 so like brother Paul was saying I
[10:40] usually Wednesdays when I'm preaching at
[10:43] least right now works kind of slow so I
[10:46] have time to get off early and study
[10:49] throughout the day
[10:50] and 9:00 this morning my manager handed
[10:53] me a big old plate full so um just kind
[10:56] of didn't didn't show up for those of
[10:58] you saw show up late and I'm sorry for
[11:00] being a bad example but I was just
[11:02] typing away as fast as I could to wrap
[11:04] this up for tonight so amen Matthew 24
[11:09] verse
[11:12] 22 and except those days should be
[11:14] shorten there should no flesh be saved
[11:17] but for the elect's sake those days
[11:19] shall be shortened then if any man shall
[11:22] say unto you Lo here is Christ or there
[11:24] believe it not for there shall arise
[11:27] false christs and false prophets Christ
[11:31] is Anointed false anointed ones and
[11:33] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[11:35] much that if it were possible they shall
[11:37] deceive the very elect so this is a
[11:41] familiar scripture but one thing to
[11:43] point out show great signs and wonders
[11:46] so they have they have the
[11:49] signs right they have these
[11:52] wonders and but they don't have the
[11:56] word in Deuteronomy it says a man comes
[12:00] to you with a dream or a vision and it
[12:02] comes to pass but he goes to take you
[12:04] from the word don't listen to him so it
[12:07] isn't enough that there's signs and
[12:08] wonders it must be the word so these
[12:12] signs and wonders being performed are
[12:16] within the midst of the church they're
[12:18] close to the bride because if if it were
[12:21] possible they shall deceive the very
[12:22] elect so it has to be something close
[12:25] says behold I have told you before
[12:27] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[12:28] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[12:31] behold he is in the secret Chambers
[12:33] believe it not for as the lightning
[12:35] cometh out of the East and shineth even
[12:37] unto the West so shall also the coming
[12:40] of the son of man be now we know brother
[12:42] Brandon talks about the son rising in
[12:45] the East right setting in the west I get
[12:47] that right and civilization moving from
[12:50] the East to the west and that the wet
[12:52] Coast West Coast is the end of that
[12:55] period so we we know by this and many
[12:58] othert scriptures we are in the coming
[13:00] of the son of man amen or he has come
[13:04] for wheresoever the carcass is there
[13:05] will the Eagles be gathered
[13:08] together Revelations 16 verse
[13:13] 13 so if you look there just one quick
[13:16] point we'll come back to it but says
[13:19] wheresoever the carcass is there will be
[13:20] Eagles will be gathered together and we
[13:22] know that there's um Eagles and vultures
[13:24] are interchanged and brother says it
[13:26] depends on the condition of the carcass
[13:29] if it's fresh then the Eagles are there
[13:31] if it's rotten then the vultures are
[13:32] there Revelation
[13:36] 16:13 and I saw three unclean spirits
[13:39] like frogs come out of the mouth of the
[13:41] dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast
[13:44] and out of the mouth of the false
[13:45] prophet for they are the spirits of
[13:50] devils working miracles which go forth
[13:52] unto the kings of the earth and of the
[13:55] whole world to gather them to the Battle
[13:57] of that great day of God Almighty behold
[14:00] I come as a thief blessed is he that WTH
[14:04] and keepeth his garments lest he walk
[14:06] naked and they see his shame let's bow
[14:08] our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we
[14:11] just ask you'd come tonight and speak to
[14:12] our hearts Lord Jesus we don't want this
[14:14] to be intellectual we want this to be
[14:16] stimulating by Revelation into our
[14:18] hearts Lord Jesus and father this is all
[14:21] about you and your word revealed to us
[14:23] in our day and father the more of you we
[14:25] see the more of you we we can take
[14:27] inside of us the more by Revelation Lord
[14:30] the more Life of Christ we can put forth
[14:33] Lord this is all about relationship Lord
[14:35] all about a connection with you seeing
[14:37] you Lord in a full picture Lord Jesus
[14:39] not with any pieces missing but in a
[14:41] full picture father Lord the the
[14:44] substance of the word Lord Jesus I pray
[14:46] you just speak to our hearts tonight
[14:48] Lord speak through by Faith Lord by
[14:50] Revelation and it cause us to see you
[14:52] greater in the scriptures we pray in
[14:54] Jesus name amen you can be seated
[14:57] tonight so
[15:00] we this this scripture here we're
[15:02] reading it's it's happens when the sixth
[15:05] Angel pours out his vial and brother
[15:06] says the this those vials the last vials
[15:09] poured out at the opening of the word
[15:11] the revealing of the seals and so this
[15:14] is not something to come this is what
[15:16] has happened and the three unclean
[15:18] spirits he says it's the Trinity of the
[15:20] frogs and we'll get to that so in here
[15:24] the scripture that I already I already
[15:26] touched on uming coming out of the East
[15:28] unto the West Coming of the son of
[15:31] man
[15:36] so okay we want to do a bit of a
[15:38] refresher on last time
[15:41] um the the in um Revelation chapter 4
[15:46] give me some time to settle into this um
[15:49] he brother Ram says now the mer so we're
[15:51] going to go back what we talked about
[15:52] last time just a quick refresher we were
[15:55] talking about the the um the revealed in
[15:59] the under the Feast of atonement and how
[16:02] that that in order for the lamb to come
[16:04] forth and take the book he had to leave
[16:06] intercession Behind The Mercy Seat so
[16:09] brother Bram says here he says Now The
[16:10] Mercy Seat it's in the
[16:13] heart where The Shining forth of his
[16:15] glory and all of his children the sh
[16:17] glory in the human heart so that
[16:19] transition happened so the blood B talks
[16:23] about so the transition happened where
[16:25] Christ came forward took the book
[16:27] revealed the seals now he's no longer
[16:29] Behind The Mercy Seat making
[16:31] intercessions he's now in his bride and
[16:35] if you think about it I had somebody
[16:37] asked me this after I preached last time
[16:39] it says well what is the what is
[16:41] Christ's Ministry so I told them I said
[16:43] what is Christ's Ministry Christ's
[16:45] Ministry is to mediate he he brought his
[16:48] blood he gave his life he he spilled his
[16:50] blood that is
[16:52] redemption and so now the The Mercy Seat
[16:56] in the bride Christ is still here on on
[16:59] the earth the blood still
[17:01] covers that's why in Revelations when it
[17:03] says the bride goes up then the Beast
[17:05] comes and
[17:06] incarnates the Antichrist because we're
[17:10] here we're holding that back because
[17:11] Christ is making
[17:13] mediation in our hearts so while the
[17:17] while before the seals were open he was
[17:19] he was behind the throne and he was
[17:20] mediating and and brother the B says he
[17:23] was just like the Feast of atonements
[17:24] the priest would go and he would behind
[17:26] the we know he's Behind The Mercy Seat
[17:28] cuz he says he spread the blood Eastward
[17:31] so he would spread it Forward
[17:33] Eastward and that is the representing
[17:38] the covering of the seven Church ages
[17:40] because he would spread it forth seven
[17:42] times and then he
[17:45] came then he came forward then the
[17:48] priest come from there it says
[17:49] everyone's sins were covered but the
[17:51] priest then come around and he would he
[17:53] would sprinkle seven times in front of
[17:54] the mercy seat and that is the breaking
[17:56] of the seals
[17:59] and we also touched on how brother
[18:01] Brandon preaches it is the rising of the
[18:04] Sun and that's the first time he says
[18:07] turn the picture so brother is realizing
[18:10] it's Christ all of this is Christ it's
[18:13] the bride coming of Christ Christ was
[18:15] the first fruits the wave sheath waved
[18:18] in the first church ages and he says
[18:20] it'll have to happen again for the bride
[18:23] coming of Christ to pull her from the
[18:25] church ages into the bride age so that
[18:27] is what this was was Christ the wav
[18:30] showing forth by his word bring coming
[18:32] forth in the word that was the wave
[18:34] sheath so but the Brandon wasn't the
[18:36] wave sheath the message he brought was
[18:38] the wave sheath to say this is what you
[18:40] have to look like and now the seed is
[18:42] coming forth so at the opening of the
[18:45] book Christ turned a corner and the age
[18:48] of the P of Pentecost is over the word
[18:51] of that age will not suffice in this
[18:54] time right in invisible Union of the
[18:56] bride of Christ he says the word that
[18:58] fell on the day of Pentecost will not
[19:00] work this day he said and then so the
[19:03] wheat is beginning to be seen so my wife
[19:06] we were talking after I preached and I
[19:08] had too many quotes and I said well I
[19:11] want to have
[19:13] proof and so I discovered
[19:16] footnotes and they are amazing so if you
[19:19] ever want to know where I'm getting this
[19:20] from I have footnotes so all of these
[19:23] quot I'm just referencing these quotes
[19:26] So it say the weed is beginning to be
[19:27] seen that it's not a Pentecostal age
[19:30] anymore cuz the shuck had to go away now
[19:32] the seed comes forth the Shu has passed
[19:35] on in the close of the seven Church ages
[19:38] and we talked last time how we have to
[19:40] understand we're underneath the umbrella
[19:42] of the leoan age because it says the
[19:44] mighty Angel come down book the book was
[19:47] open and he says time no longer and what
[19:50] that means is there's time delayed and
[19:52] if you look at the timeline of the earth
[19:55] brother B says it's 7,000 years 7,000
[19:57] years for the creat
[19:59] as we know it not the earth and the
[20:01] universe those are billions and millions
[20:02] of years but the creation as we know it
[20:04] 7,000 years last 7,000 God rested then
[20:08] then then it was 2,000 to Noah 2000 to
[20:13] Christ I'm
[20:16] getting yes I think so anyways on down
[20:19] however you want to put it basically
[20:21] around the year 2000 and our years are
[20:23] off is the completion of that 6,000
[20:26] years so then the next he says it's a
[20:27] Thousand-Year millennium so we are in a
[20:30] delay
[20:32] okay he says not that God's like oh no I
[20:35] didn't do my job right no it's just the
[20:37] way God's working so he says we're
[20:40] baking in the sun right the seed is
[20:42] baking in leadership he says now you see
[20:44] it's wheat time now it's getting Harvest
[20:47] Time this is not Luther's age this is
[20:50] not Pentecost age this is the bride age
[20:53] okay so that kind of a refresher what we
[20:56] talked about last time and I wanted to
[20:57] come as my as my subject is is listed as
[21:00] the conflict at the word transition so I
[21:03] kind of wanted to to to focus in on this
[21:07] conflict that happens when the word
[21:08] turns a corner as you could as as we say
[21:11] it um there's always a conflict when
[21:14] word goes on there's always a conflict
[21:17] and when God turns a corner and God
[21:20] always turns a corner at the close of an
[21:21] age when when when he when the word we
[21:24] lost the NAA Council we shift it the
[21:27] word changed right didn't change I I
[21:30] should say the word progressed went into
[21:33] the ground so there was a shift the seed
[21:36] The Original Seed went into the ground
[21:37] there was a shift and on down through
[21:39] the church ages and every time there was
[21:41] a shift there was an age and brother M
[21:42] says the messenger comes at the end of
[21:44] the
[21:45] age so because he's bringing the word
[21:49] forth so every time that happens there's
[21:51] a conflict at that transition and you
[21:54] understand in your own personal lives
[21:56] when there's a transition there is
[21:57] conflict sometimes within yourself
[21:59] sometimes with your family sometimes
[22:01] with your spouse sometimes with your
[22:02] children however it might be there's
[22:04] when there's transitions in our lives
[22:06] there is conflict uh when a child is
[22:08] going from uh being a kid to being an
[22:11] adolescent there's a conflict of
[22:13] emotions in their life so there's always
[22:16] Conflict at these transitions so but our
[22:19] Victory is
[22:21] found when when we when we find our
[22:25] position and lay hold of Faith or or
[22:29] revelation of the word brother B talks
[22:31] about in the church age book if she if
[22:33] the when the bride realizes who she is
[22:35] in other words her position and it's not
[22:38] and it's not that we convince you you're
[22:41] powerful right it's that you see
[22:44] yourself in the word in other words you
[22:47] get a revelation of what we're talking
[22:50] about revelation of what the pastor is
[22:53] preaching revelation of the word when
[22:54] you read the seals you see Christ and
[22:56] it's expanding and it's expounding to
[22:58] you you now there's always more to learn
[23:00] because we are going to learn about
[23:02] Christ for
[23:04] eternity so always a progression of your
[23:06] Revelation you go back to what I
[23:08] preached when I first started it' be
[23:09] different than now and in another five
[23:11] years another year sometimes another
[23:13] couple months God gives you greater
[23:15] Revelation his word doesn't change you
[23:18] change you grow into his word that's
[23:21] right so but Revelation is very very
[23:24] very important brother bam says it's
[23:26] more important than we realize
[23:28] and so the word of the previous age is
[23:31] vulture food now I have a quote at the
[23:34] close of the sermon it says brother M
[23:35] says we're preaching the same gospel
[23:37] Luther preached Wesley preached
[23:39] Pentecost he's just there's just some
[23:41] added to
[23:43] it so you it's the it's the progression
[23:47] of the opening of the word you have to
[23:49] remember through the church ages they
[23:50] didn't have what we have today that is
[23:53] why in Hebrews it says they without us
[23:55] are not made perfect the word had to be
[23:59] restored in flesh again okay the seed
[24:04] had to go into ground if God didn't if
[24:06] God didn't you know ascended on high if
[24:07] he didn't plant himself in the ground
[24:09] and go down in the Dark Ages he wouldn't
[24:11] be able to reproduce himself in a bride
[24:14] so anytime you try to you try to go back
[24:17] and say well we need this back there
[24:21] instead of what God has today you're
[24:23] feeding on Rotten Mana okay Mana was
[24:28] given at the beginning of every day and
[24:30] if you held it over to the next day or
[24:33] the next Church ages it became full of
[24:35] worms and you'll remember brother it
[24:37] says the word God says I will restore
[24:39] everything the worm or the Locust and
[24:41] the cankerworm has eaten up so there's
[24:44] this there's this transition where the
[24:46] word was held over and it it it it
[24:49] rotted and in that transition there's
[24:53] two things that happen you either
[24:54] denominate or you go on with Christ
[24:57] right
[24:58] okay so he says in no1 at the end time
[25:02] Moses was an eagle and he never gave the
[25:04] children of God Noah's leftovers see he
[25:07] had the fresh word of
[25:14] God the word is
[25:17] Mana now the type to our age was the
[25:22] hidden
[25:23] Mana so this was the church
[25:25] ages Mana would go bad the next age God
[25:29] would be would bring the word forth
[25:31] there would be denomination and there
[25:33] would be the truth in our age we're
[25:36] typing the word the Mana in inside the
[25:39] holiest of holies because it was
[25:42] there with the
[25:44] ark with the mercy seat so that word is
[25:47] now in us right and it's not going to
[25:50] denominate right you see we're not
[25:53] eating the Mana outside the
[25:56] Tabernacle we are eating the Mana ins
[25:58] inside the
[26:00] Tabernacle that's a tent Vision yeah
[26:03] that's it okay you go and you receiving
[26:06] Christ okay because we're not eating the
[26:08] Mana outside we're eating the Mana
[26:09] inside and the Mana inside the holies of
[26:11] holies welcome back Joel and Leah missed
[26:14] you guys inside the holiest of holies
[26:16] was Mana inside the ark that never
[26:19] perished that is the revealed
[26:23] word so for for seven Church ages the
[26:27] man of fell was was eaten went bad
[26:29] denomination and the Mana fell again but
[26:32] in the last stage after the close of
[26:36] Pentecost God came forth and took the
[26:38] book and he revealed it to us now we
[26:41] have
[26:43] access to that hidden
[26:48] manner he says my sheep hear my voice
[26:51] and I know them and they follow me you
[26:54] see this is this is um
[26:59] this is I see now where I got off this
[27:02] is a revelation the revelation of the
[27:05] present day word is necessary to reach
[27:07] the goal revelation of present word is
[27:11] necessary to reach the goal because he
[27:13] says my sheep hear my voice and I know
[27:16] them and they follow me and Faith cometh
[27:18] by hearing hearing the word of God you
[27:20] know pleasing pleasing the Lord is a
[27:22] requirement for a secured relationship
[27:25] without Revelation it is impossible to
[27:27] please God that's this is like Hebrews
[27:29] 11:6 but without faith it is impossible
[27:31] to please him for he that he that cometh
[27:34] to God must believe that he is that he
[27:35] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[27:37] seek him see it's not Faith to heal your
[27:40] foot Faith to to to to heal your dog or
[27:43] or faith for for money in the bank this
[27:45] is a revelation of who Christ is W
[27:49] without that how can you please him how
[27:53] can you please a husband you don't even
[27:55] know how can you have a relationship
[27:57] with somebody you don't know and you
[28:00] he's not there in Pentecost anymore he
[28:04] is here he is here in the midst with us
[28:07] he's not in Wesley anymore he's not in
[28:09] the methodists he's here with us in the
[28:13] in his revealed word where his word is
[28:15] the present truth you see he he is the
[28:19] word the present truth so it's
[28:20] imperative for Rel for relationship with
[28:23] him to know present truth he says he
[28:25] didn't say I am
[28:28] uh he didn't say I I I was tell the
[28:31] children of Israel I
[28:33] was they kept saying the god Abraham
[28:37] Isaac and Jacob and God said no no no no
[28:40] no no no Moses is
[28:42] here I
[28:44] am tell them I am that I am in other
[28:48] words present God he brings it from the
[28:50] past and he says that isn't enough
[28:52] anymore you need this now I am and
[28:54] through through the ministry of Moses we
[28:56] know all the types but the B says in and
[28:59] and the okay therefore if we can find
[29:02] the transition in the word we can find
[29:05] where we missed the turn and get back on
[29:08] track okay that's why it's important to
[29:10] know where we are he says I I said third
[29:13] sh I said shoot a gun if you don't hit
[29:16] the target find where it went off at you
[29:18] got to come back there and start again
[29:22] so go back to where it was so if you
[29:24] find yourself without God you go back to
[29:26] where he was or it's not even
[29:29] that in the transition God has to show
[29:33] his bride through Revelation where she
[29:35] is where the word is but preached God's
[29:39] provided place of worship and he talked
[29:42] about all of these things because he had
[29:44] the word had to show you where you are
[29:47] so you know where to go with the word so
[29:51] in the W uh in the Luther Wesley
[29:55] transition there was conflict you know
[29:58] uh J um Judas Luther he he said
[30:02] justification for therein is the
[30:04] righteousness of God revealed from Faith
[30:06] to Faith as it is written the just shall
[30:07] live by faith now this was this was the
[30:10] r says there was no prophets through the
[30:12] church ages they were ref reformers then
[30:14] there had to come a prophet to reveal
[30:16] the word so they're reforming they're
[30:18] seeing this stuff in the scripture
[30:19] Luther says I don't have to pay this
[30:22] Catholic Church all this money for indul
[30:24] indulgences and he he turned the world
[30:26] upside down and he and he changed it but
[30:28] then but then now not Luther cuz Luther
[30:31] passed but then the people with that
[30:33] message then that there came the next
[30:37] the they came the man of fourth at the
[30:39] next age of Wesley and there was a
[30:42] conflict but says and God's only provide
[30:44] a place of worship he says try to go
[30:46] back say well now we're Lutheran we want
[30:48] to come up here you've got to die to the
[30:51] Lutheran age to be born in the Wesley
[30:54] age yes that's a
[30:56] frog cuz frogs always look back they're
[31:00] looking back that's why those those
[31:02] three spirits that we read about that
[31:04] were released in the vials they were
[31:07] they were unclean spirits like frogs cuz
[31:09] they're here by says they're always
[31:11] looking back he says looking back to NAA
[31:13] looking back to the vulture
[31:16] food so they're saying Wesley's message
[31:19] comes and they're all the lutherans are
[31:20] saying no we got to go back it's
[31:22] justification they got to go back to
[31:24] this back to this back to this and they
[31:26] miss the word transition then we have
[31:28] sanctification with the and this brings
[31:30] forth the Wesley Pentecost
[31:33] transition and
[31:36] um in in in when when you in in these
[31:40] transitions it's those those who the the
[31:43] spirit of
[31:46] denomination tries to hold on to the
[31:49] word of the previous age that is the
[31:51] spirit
[31:52] denomination because brother brandom
[31:55] says it's organization it's man
[31:57] organized he say they miss God in other
[31:59] words they're hold they they had truth
[32:02] but they held on to it overnight and it
[32:06] soured because God had fresh word for
[32:10] them they're trying to feed on Luther's
[32:12] leftovers when Wesley has a fresh meal
[32:16] you ever had leftovers and Mom's like
[32:18] look kids you know or the wife's like
[32:21] look honey this is about to go bad we
[32:24] got to eat it it's like we should have
[32:27] just thrown it away
[32:29] right so it kind of tastes like the
[32:34] refrigerator so that's what happens so
[32:37] there's a conflict to even well maybe
[32:40] not so much today because you know of
[32:42] The ecumenical council of churches and
[32:44] and all of that but there was all this
[32:46] conflict you know methodists couldn't
[32:48] you know walk on the same side of the
[32:49] street as Presbyterians and so on and so
[32:51] forth right this conflict between these
[32:53] ideas because they said this is it and
[32:56] they were right
[32:58] this is it this changed my life and
[33:02] they're right this or this changed my
[33:04] grandpa's life this changed my Dad's
[33:07] life and they're right but they stopped
[33:10] right the problem is is when you stop
[33:13] and you hold on to this you hold on to
[33:15] this over here there's always more
[33:17] Revelation there's always more of God
[33:20] and with Revelation see part of the
[33:22] conflict is that with Revelation comes
[33:24] correction yes that's right Wesley said
[33:27] you're Justified you are
[33:30] dirty they were offended by him I think
[33:34] at the beginning of his ministry he got
[33:35] kicked out of a bunch of churches that
[33:37] was him my kids were watching uh I
[33:40] forget what it's called lamplighters or
[33:42] something like that and they the the the
[33:44] preacher I think it was Wesley kept
[33:46] getting dragged out of the church so
[33:47] they were offended he was just fire so
[33:49] he preached in the fields and they came
[33:52] if I have the wrong guy you forgive me
[33:53] but the point still
[33:55] stands you hear these Lutheran
[33:58] who bless God they're not
[34:03] Catholic but they're immoral they're
[34:10] drunk I hope you're catching what we're
[34:13] saying here they're holding on to it
[34:16] they got it right but they didn't
[34:20] anymore cuz God transist but there was a
[34:22] conflict then Wesley man Sanctified they
[34:26] had they were coming coming to you know
[34:28] it's God's kind of working it forth he
[34:29] says but talks about growing the plant
[34:32] growing looking closer and closer to the
[34:33] truth Methodist man they were they would
[34:36] shout they would they had the anointing
[34:38] of the holy spirit so they were kind of
[34:41] like Pentecostals but but they they I
[34:45] mean sanctify falling on the altar
[34:47] crying out for God to to help them to to
[34:50] forgive them to clean them and then you
[34:52] have the the and then they they get you
[34:54] know Wesley passes on that they have an
[34:56] established church and hey you know this
[34:58] is this is it and then the Holy Rollers
[35:02] came and you had brother brand says the
[35:06] restoration of the
[35:13] gifts you have to die in Wesley age to
[35:16] be born in Pentecostal
[35:19] age so Pentecost the Holy Spirit baptism
[35:23] of the Holy Ghost the gifts you know we
[35:26] we have we have Acts 2:4
[35:28] and they were all filled with the Holy
[35:30] Ghost and began to speak with other
[35:32] tongues as the spirit gave them
[35:33] utterance restoration of the gifts
[35:38] so brother bam
[35:41] says if I forget exactly how he says it
[35:44] but he says there'll be another book of
[35:45] Acts that's right and if we're not
[35:48] careful we'll be like frogs and we'll
[35:52] look at the interpretation of that
[35:54] through the lens of
[35:56] Pentecost pente Pentecost is called
[35:59] Pentecost because it was the Feast of
[36:02] Weeks this is not
[36:05] Pentecost this is this is an outpouring
[36:07] that happened to
[36:09] them so not everybody speaks with
[36:12] tongues if if this is what we have to go
[36:15] back if this is it then there's a lot of
[36:17] us who don't have it right yeah it's
[36:21] true but brother brandham saw you see as
[36:24] the transition because brother Brenham
[36:26] is the messenger okay he comes what is
[36:29] one of the biggest things he sees at the
[36:31] beginning the two men who spoke in
[36:33] tongues and
[36:35] interpretations so it was in order it
[36:37] was correct one was one was had two
[36:41] families so that is not the book of
[36:45] Acts brother baram's talking about the
[36:47] book of Acts he's saying a restoration
[36:50] of the word in its original form the
[36:54] original form is not speaking in tongues
[36:56] right
[36:58] they caught a revelation of their
[37:03] day the moving of the holy spirit so
[37:06] Pentecost you know they they the the
[37:08] zash sheet Revival and and and we see it
[37:10] in denominations and I and I almost
[37:13] pulled up a video but I I forgot about
[37:16] it so maybe the Lord doesn't want me to
[37:19] show it but it was it says Pentecostal
[37:21] preacher back in the '90s
[37:24] and you watch it you realize this is
[37:27] going to come come out very straight I
[37:28] don't mean this any other way except for
[37:30] to show you where we
[37:31] are it doesn't look like it looks like
[37:35] just like an a Revival we would have
[37:38] Revival we would have so there's a lot
[37:41] that we hold on to there's a lot that we
[37:44] take a hold of that is a tradition of
[37:48] Pentecostalism yes and we say and if
[37:51] we're not
[37:52] careful we'll look back through the eyes
[37:55] of a frog and we'll say we need to go
[37:57] back the Bible never says go back it
[38:01] says well brother Chris Malachi 4 says
[38:03] back to the faith to the hearts of the
[38:05] children back to the fathers that's a
[38:08] restoration of the word but B says the
[38:11] faith of the fathers it's the
[38:14] restoration of the word in its original
[38:16] form amen not back to the last to
[38:23] 1906 because you see what happened it
[38:26] denominated
[38:29] if that was the thing we need it
[38:31] wouldn't have denominated but it
[38:33] denominated but we needed it it was the
[38:36] but there's a quote here later on it was
[38:38] the
[38:39] carrier
[38:42] so he says and you have to die in the
[38:45] Pentecostal age leave nothing of it left
[38:48] burn it with fire you know he he says we
[38:51] have the we read you just read the quote
[38:53] this is all in the same paragraph he
[38:55] says you know you got to die in Luther's
[38:56] age got to die by say when he gets to
[38:58] this point I find it interesting he he
[39:00] says leave nothing of it left burn it
[39:03] with fire he says because that's what's
[39:05] going to happen to the to the shocks and
[39:07] all of that right the the seed comes
[39:09] forth from that so we're not we're not
[39:12] Downing on the gifts we're Downing on
[39:16] the message of go back to
[39:20] Pentecost because that is not where the
[39:22] word
[39:23] is the only place I know the places I
[39:26] see in the Bible where people are trying
[39:28] to the people of God are trying to go
[39:30] back was to the leaks and the garlics of
[39:32] Egypt that's
[39:34] right and this is the anointing poured
[39:37] out under the Sixth Seal by this
[39:41] vial so no wonder we're dealing with
[39:45] it the the the sixth Angel poured out
[39:48] his vial upon the great river Euphrates
[39:50] and the water thereof was dried up so
[39:52] all of this is is past tense this has
[39:54] been poured out that I might have the
[39:56] timing a little off but it's under this
[39:59] that that that we we live
[40:01] today actually no I'm sorry it is under
[40:03] the six because but BR says it's
[40:04] trinitarianism saying go back to NAA
[40:07] okay so this was poured out in our day
[40:09] no wonder we have that anointing
[40:11] trickling into the message trying to go
[40:17] back and we're not here to get on our
[40:21] high horses about that you can be
[40:24] convinced and then concerned yeah but
[40:26] don't be become
[40:29] critical and it's just the signs of the
[40:31] times that we live in okay there's a the
[40:34] the so the the reason
[40:37] that he says the message won't
[40:40] denominate because the message is Christ
[40:43] okay then why where is the
[40:46] denominational spirit in the message
[40:48] coming from it's coming from this right
[40:51] here trying to go back to Pentecostalism
[40:55] trying to go back to p
[40:58] Pentecost but says the faith of the
[41:01] fathers the faith of the Pentecostal
[41:03] fathers he never says go back and start
[41:07] running around on the streets and and
[41:09] somehow speaking everybody's tongue that
[41:11] was that was them that was what happened
[41:13] to them
[41:14] and not to say that can't happen but
[41:16] that wasn't the point what brought that
[41:19] forth in them was it just because the
[41:21] Holy Ghost fell on them in the offer
[41:23] room it was because they caught a
[41:25] revelation the Holy Ghost came and
[41:27] baptized him they got the new birth and
[41:29] then they saw Christ they spent three
[41:32] whatever three and a half three years
[41:34] with this man he died he rises again wow
[41:39] then then he's gone and then there they
[41:41] are and the Holy Ghost Falls they get
[41:43] the new birth and with that comes a
[41:47] revelation yes and they go oh excuse me
[41:50] they go
[41:55] wow and Peter comes forth where in the
[41:59] world did he get acts 238 from the white
[42:03] stone between the lines he understood
[42:06] the point he caught a revelation of the
[42:08] message that was given to him that is
[42:10] what we have to go back to that is the
[42:12] foundation
[42:14] that I'm sorry that's what brings forth
[42:17] in my personal
[42:19] opinion true emotion yes amen when you
[42:23] see yourself in the word nothing can
[42:26] that that I mean that's just
[42:28] that gets me very excited as you can see
[42:30] Revelations chap 10 brother Bram was
[42:33] sitting in the
[42:34] woods talking about running around the
[42:36] tree it was because he CAU revelation of
[42:38] something yes that's right Revelations
[42:41] 10 we're just going to read the whole
[42:43] chapter very familiar portion of
[42:52] scripture and they saw another Mighty
[42:54] Angel come down from heaven
[42:57] clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was
[43:00] upon his head now you
[43:02] remember we had the cloud in Life
[43:04] Magazine on the other side of the page
[43:06] was the
[43:07] rainbow it wasn't happen
[43:10] stance it was further Testament that
[43:13] this Mighty Angel is Christ
[43:15] himself and not just that
[43:19] alone but that was that was in addition
[43:21] to everything else that happened and his
[43:24] face was as it were the Sun and his feet
[43:26] as pillars of fire and he had in his
[43:29] hand a little book open if someone wants
[43:32] to tell you the seals are
[43:35] closed which I think that's dying out
[43:37] with their generation but um now we have
[43:41] people saying the seals are open the
[43:42] seals are open they have no idea what
[43:43] they're talking about so there's
[43:45] transitions in time yeah but a little
[43:48] book open I'm not going to I'm just
[43:50] going to move on and he set his right
[43:52] foot upon the sea and his left foot on
[43:54] the earth and he cried with a loud voice
[43:56] as when a lion roared so thunder come
[43:58] forth right he says when he cried seven
[44:00] Thunders utter their voices brother B
[44:02] was trying to go preach the seven
[44:03] Thunders and then God spoke to him and
[44:04] said those are revealed under the seals
[44:07] because it's the voice of God the
[44:09] Thunders come forth the voice of God God
[44:11] spoke through the revealing of the
[44:14] seals and when the seven Thunders had
[44:16] uttered their voices I was about to
[44:18] write so it's the Revelation it's not
[44:20] just the voice of God it's hearing but
[44:22] John heard the Thunders he had a
[44:24] revelation of the Thunders and he went
[44:27] to write the revelation of the Seven
[44:29] Seals God said don't the angel said
[44:32] don't write it so that's what the
[44:34] Thunders are and the angel which I saw
[44:36] stand upon the
[44:38] sea seal okay seal up those things which
[44:40] the seven Thunders uttered and write
[44:42] them not so that was revealed and the
[44:44] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[44:46] upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[44:47] heaven and swear by him that liveth
[44:49] forever and ever who created heaven and
[44:51] the things that therein are okay let's
[44:54] skip to verse 7 but in the days of the
[44:56] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[44:59] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[45:02] be finished when th shall begin to sound
[45:07] 47 no when he begins to sound forth the
[45:12] message God had to bring him to
[45:14] revelation God had to bring him to a
[45:16] point a point where God brought the word
[45:19] forth so you see a a progression over
[45:21] those years don't dis discredit it it's
[45:26] the truth still
[45:28] you see the Revelation growing Jesus was
[45:31] on Earth for 30 years that's right okay
[45:34] but then he gets that then he begins to
[45:36] sound when the word begins to be
[45:38] revealed and at that point the mystery
[45:40] of God should be started should be
[45:43] finished as he had declared to his
[45:45] servants the prophets
[45:48] now and now verse eight and the voice
[45:51] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[45:52] again and said go and take the little
[45:54] book which is open in the hand of the
[45:57] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[45:59] upon the Earth so the book is open now
[46:01] where does the book go does the book the
[46:04] book where do where does the book go
[46:07] into the hand of the Bride John is the
[46:11] type of the Bride into the hand of the
[46:13] Bride the Mighty the angel unto the
[46:16] angel so this is the mighty Angel says
[46:18] go take the book so the word came forth
[46:22] and the word said the same
[46:24] thing throughout the open opening of the
[46:27] book the opening of the seals through
[46:28] the end of this ministry the word said
[46:30] the same thing take the
[46:34] book when the bride took the
[46:38] book God turned the corner
[46:42] right okay so it was there it was ready
[46:45] but John had to go take it when the
[46:48] bride took
[46:50] it God turned the corner there is men
[46:53] who are still alive today who early in
[46:56] the early years of the message when
[46:57] people were floundering and brother B
[46:59] Pastor all these weird doctrines come
[47:01] forth from
[47:02] that there was men who started to catch
[47:04] a
[47:05] revelation and begin to preach the
[47:07] opening of the
[47:12] word through the five-fold
[47:15] ministry God Reveals His word he came
[47:18] and opened the book now through the
[47:21] preaching of the fful ministry he
[47:23] imparts that to the bride
[47:27] cuz it's his spoken word spoken word is
[47:30] the Original
[47:31] Seed so God turned the corner now if if
[47:35] if the bride took the
[47:37] book who has the
[47:41] book it's now the bride's
[47:45] Ministry when
[47:48] Elijah went up there was there was I
[47:52] think three things he was supposed to do
[47:53] he supposed to anoint Elisha or two
[47:55] things or whatever he was supposed to
[47:57] anoint the king of Syria and he
[47:59] didn't Elisha did and it was a type of
[48:02] God completing the ministry through the
[48:05] bride Elisha is the type of the Bride so
[48:08] God comes now he says go and take the
[48:10] book and eat it up and it shall make thy
[48:13] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[48:14] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[48:17] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[48:18] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[48:20] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[48:21] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[48:23] thou must prophesy again before many
[48:26] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[48:28] kings in other words you've eaten the
[48:30] book now speak the
[48:33] book confess the book Minister the book
[48:38] through your life you see you're going
[48:40] to testify your your life testifies your
[48:43] your words testify or it should if it's
[48:46] not you see there's a transition there's
[48:48] a transition in our lives where where we
[48:50] go from being immature
[48:52] Christians on the brother Paul talking
[48:56] about this on the sincere milk of the
[48:58] word and then we transition to the meat
[49:00] or the substance of the word if this did
[49:04] if this if this doesn't matter because
[49:07] there there's some that say it doesn't
[49:08] if this doesn't matter and we just need
[49:11] to preach Deliverance why was it
[49:13] revealed
[49:15] right I heard I heard a minister a
[49:17] message Minister
[49:19] say we just need more Deliverance
[49:21] messages preached and I asked him but he
[49:24] didn't hear me so I haven't yet found
[49:26] God his answer answer what is that right
[49:30] last I
[49:31] checked make sure I say this in Love
[49:34] Last I check the word is what
[49:37] delivers so therefore you want
[49:40] Deliverance in your life you want to
[49:41] grow
[49:42] spiritually what do you need do you need
[49:45] more anointing right do you
[49:52] need do you need more anointing
[49:58] both physically and L uh literally and
[50:01] uh figuratively I'm on the
[50:05] edge if when you catch revelation of the
[50:09] word your life changes
[50:13] absolutely and when it changes in that
[50:16] fashion you don't have post Camp
[50:20] Blues you don't have oh man it's
[50:25] back when you see yourself
[50:28] and Lord willing I'll just say this Lord
[50:31] willing I have a sermon on the balance
[50:34] of the fful ministry because I heard a
[50:36] brother preaching and he said he said
[50:38] the teacher the teacher looks at the
[50:40] Evangelist and goes you didn't finish
[50:41] your thought and the Apostle says why
[50:43] are you all sitting around no one's left
[50:45] their Church in three days and the the
[50:48] the pastor you know he I he didn't give
[50:49] an example of the pastor but and he said
[50:52] the Evangelist says you know he says if
[50:54] we could work together
[50:59] praise the
[51:00] Lord
[51:03] so he says take the book so John takes
[51:07] the book and in the rising of the sun
[51:08] brother says it is in the bride coming
[51:10] of
[51:11] Christ coming out of the church they'll
[51:14] have to be a sheath waved again in the
[51:15] last days yes in order to bring the
[51:19] bride forth a sheath had to be waved so
[51:22] God turned a corner God was God was the
[51:25] revelation of the word was coming forth
[51:28] and I went unto the angel and said give
[51:30] me the book and took the little
[51:33] book you
[51:35] see the Gentile church is brother talks
[51:39] about this is blinded from the
[51:41] veil again just like the Jews with it in
[51:45] in with Jesus because he's veiled in
[51:48] flesh again in the unveiling of the
[51:51] unveiling of God paragraph
[51:54] 221 he talks about that you see God's
[51:57] program can't be
[51:59] broken the blinding has to come again
[52:02] and the blinding came here here's what I
[52:05] found very fascinating but brother BR
[52:07] says in this quote the blinding came
[52:11] by they said to Jesus you a man making
[52:16] yourself God right but says that's where
[52:19] the blinding
[52:21] came so they look at us and we say we're
[52:24] the word in flesh or we preach it's
[52:27] Christ in you it's the word made flesh
[52:31] and it's that Revelation right there
[52:33] that people stumble on even people who H
[52:37] who who are in the message and believe
[52:38] the
[52:39] prophet and and go to good churches they
[52:43] can't receive that
[52:45] because I don't know why their time
[52:48] hadn't come yet so God is veiled in a
[52:51] human being again the mercy seed is in
[52:54] the heart of the Bride you see see like
[52:57] you you can't you can't leave God there
[53:00] in
[53:01] history Perfect song you you got to
[53:03] bring him forward so to where you live
[53:07] today I'm trying better to stay on
[53:10] track okay the seed is not erir at the
[53:12] shook brother bam says this he says and
[53:15] the shook let me make sure I close this
[53:17] thought okay and the so the shu is a
[53:20] carrier so now let's let's move even
[53:22] even further because we're in the
[53:23] Pentecost bride age transition okay this
[53:27] is happening in the message this is
[53:29] happening in the message that spirit is
[53:31] trying to anoint you to say go back
[53:33] because if you look back to vulture food
[53:35] you have no victory in your
[53:38] life the shuck is a carrier is just
[53:41] exactly what our denominations has been
[53:43] a carrier Luther Wesley Pentecostals and
[53:46] now it's time for the seed to come
[53:53] forth so Christ's Ministry continues
[53:56] continues in the bride the seed comes
[53:58] forth the original seed comes forth
[54:00] which is his excuse me his
[54:04] body why was it that that that why in
[54:07] the Garden of Eden at the beginning of
[54:09] creation did God take a rib out of
[54:12] Adam and create Eve because he did the
[54:15] same thing with the
[54:18] bride he we are a part of him he
[54:22] expressed
[54:23] us so we are his body same word
[54:29] different mask Christ in morphe
[54:35] amen he says now you see it's wheat time
[54:39] now it's getting Harvest Time this is
[54:41] not Luther's age this is not Pentecost
[54:44] age this is the bride
[54:49] age and like I to to to to bring to your
[54:52] remembrance the seeds of denomination
[54:55] denominationalism is all about going
[54:58] back to the previous
[55:00] message that is what
[55:03] denominationalism and that was clearly
[55:05] laid out in this scripture Revelation
[55:07] 16:13 three unclean spirits like
[55:10] frogs and that that is the spirit so so
[55:14] this is this is the amazing thing and
[55:16] and why you convinced concerned then you
[55:19] can't be critical because the spirit of
[55:23] this we've seen it we've interacted with
[55:26] with it in the message itself and we're
[55:28] troubled by
[55:30] it and this is why you have to lay in
[55:33] the word and say God this is not about a
[55:36] head knowledge this is not about me
[55:37] convincing somebody I'm right based on
[55:40] quotes based on scriptures this is about
[55:43] a relationship with Christ and the
[55:46] reason you have to be there because when
[55:47] you really see this you realize the
[55:50] spirit of this is
[55:52] trinitarianism right and it's in the
[55:56] message yes in the
[56:00] church he says it's a trinity of frogs
[56:02] they frogs and animal that always looks
[56:04] backward he never looks where he's going
[56:06] he looks where he's come from no wonder
[56:09] under that
[56:12] anointing there's no
[56:14] Victory right because they don't look
[56:16] where they're
[56:18] going if I walk down if I drive if I
[56:21] walk and I don't look where I'm going
[56:22] I'm going to run into stuff like my
[56:25] goodness you know I just wish you know L
[56:27] you know just Saints pray for me you
[56:28] know I lost the bumper on my car and I
[56:30] can't afford a new one well how well I
[56:32] close my eyes while I was
[56:36] driving now that's a funny
[56:39] example but that's what people are doing
[56:42] spiritually they're coming to church
[56:43] saying pastor pray for me pray for me
[56:46] what they what what what we need is to
[56:48] say let me talk to you what's the
[56:51] problem well I have no victory in my
[56:54] life do you have a TV in your house yeah
[56:58] yes you'd be
[57:00] surprised how that is the thing in the
[57:03] message not a
[57:06] screen
[57:08] TV all that filth and that trash you
[57:11] can't filter just comes
[57:12] through okay or do you have a phone yes
[57:16] do you have full access
[57:19] yes that's your problem your problem is
[57:22] not oh you need Deliverance you need
[57:24] Deliverance no you need respon
[57:27] responsibility but you see why are they
[57:30] floundering in that position we all go
[57:31] through that okay so I'm not saying
[57:33] because you're going through that you
[57:35] have the spirit of a frog what I'm
[57:37] saying is it is if we don't take them to
[57:40] the word and we say yes let's all gather
[57:43] together and and and cast it and I don't
[57:45] want this come out harsh I'm just making
[57:46] a point cast that Spirit
[57:48] out they'll go home and they'll do the
[57:50] same thing and they'll think something's
[57:52] right wrong with them you're trying to
[57:54] administer the Pentecostal the a the
[57:57] message of Pentecost you're trying to
[57:58] bring it forward or bring us back to
[58:01] that for deliverance that was their
[58:05] message that was back then but then what
[58:08] happened brother brandham came and he
[58:11] said unless you become the word in flesh
[58:15] and they said we can't walk with
[58:18] that
[58:20] Pentecostalism Pentecost denominated
[58:23] because they couldn't receive the cross
[58:26] ing into the
[58:27] word
[58:29] okay
[58:31] so I hope that point made sense it's
[58:35] it's it's not it's not
[58:37] about you see when a when a a child of
[58:40] God okay that's right I don't want to
[58:41] leave I don't want to leave this so
[58:42] there's a child they have to grow up but
[58:44] they have to realize that that as the
[58:46] word comes you grow and and you you stop
[58:49] floundering as a
[58:51] child and you realize that I have to
[58:54] feed on the word yes they're asking for
[58:58] deliverance they want a quick fix they
[59:01] want to come to the camp where where
[59:03] where there's or they want to come to
[59:04] the meeting or they want to come to
[59:05] church and they want the preacher to
[59:07] pray for them and they want to be
[59:09] delivered but they don't want to change
[59:11] anything in their life they don't want
[59:13] to listen to the tapes anymore they
[59:14] don't want to listen to read their Bible
[59:16] more you cannot survive as a child of
[59:19] God unless you listen to the word every
[59:21] day amen you will notice the effects in
[59:24] your life you have to pray you have to
[59:26] that's why it's here you have to partake
[59:28] of it and a lot of a lot of of of uh
[59:32] mistakes come when when the
[59:36] realization that you need more word
[59:39] isn't isn't doesn't come across so you
[59:40] have to come to a point as a child of
[59:42] God where you realize I need more word
[59:45] and then and then sometimes you have to
[59:46] say God give me a Hunger for More word
[59:48] right help me to put down the book help
[59:50] me to to put down the phone and and give
[59:53] me a desire for your word sometimes you
[59:55] have to start there and many times you
[59:58] have to you have to decrease the
[1:00:01] distractions around
[1:00:04] you this is what this is what changes
[1:00:07] situations we we need to grow the word
[1:00:10] the word has shifted the word has
[1:00:11] transition we need to grow to the point
[1:00:13] where we realize and a true evangelist
[1:00:17] will do will will Point things in your
[1:00:20] life and you will go
[1:00:23] ouch evangelism is not Pentecostal
[1:00:27] preachers right we we we we got that
[1:00:30] idea in her in our heads because of
[1:00:32] traditions of the past that rolled
[1:00:34] forward and now we have young people
[1:00:35] raising up who think that's an anointed
[1:00:39] preacher that is an emotional
[1:00:42] preacher but true evangelism what what
[1:00:45] is the point of
[1:00:46] evangelizing it's It's to to point out
[1:00:49] the error without any kind of
[1:00:53] attack just straight to the point
[1:00:56] you look like a devil get God that's
[1:00:59] evangelism and he and but you're
[1:01:01] bringing it with the word and then the
[1:01:03] pastor picks up the pieces that's
[1:01:06] evangelism this hurah a God help me I
[1:01:11] don't want to get but if if the if the
[1:01:13] message if the message let me put this
[1:01:15] way because this isn't about people
[1:01:16] principalities powers of the air if the
[1:01:18] message that's coming across that's
[1:01:20] you're feeding on is you're the bride
[1:01:22] you're the bride you're the bride you
[1:01:23] have the victory you have the victory
[1:01:24] you have the Victory and you don't yeah
[1:01:28] I'm sorry you're not the
[1:01:30] bride yet but you say well
[1:01:33] predestination of course so you'll come
[1:01:34] to that place but you're not acting like
[1:01:36] the bride right if I can't get I should
[1:01:39] not preach and tell you who you are I
[1:01:42] should say this is Christ and you see
[1:01:45] that and you say oh that's me the the
[1:01:48] mom didn't take the little baby boy over
[1:01:50] to the mirror and say look that's you
[1:01:52] yeah he sat and looked at himself in the
[1:01:54] mirror yeah that's right and he goes I
[1:01:57] don't understand what I'm looking at
[1:02:00] what is this and he goes
[1:02:07] hm Mom that's me you see a revelation on
[1:02:12] his
[1:02:13] own through the guidance of the word
[1:02:16] preached
[1:02:18] right the the the even evangelism
[1:02:21] there's substance to
[1:02:23] it there is substance to
[1:02:27] it we are not called to to work
[1:02:30] ourselves up to to to be inspired to say
[1:02:33] okay I'm going to go home and put my
[1:02:34] foot on the
[1:02:36] devil what does that even mean yeah you
[1:02:40] know what that means that means going
[1:02:41] home is pushing
[1:02:43] play I just brought two ideas together
[1:02:45] and clashed in the
[1:02:48] middle okay we're going to move on
[1:02:51] because like I said you have to be
[1:02:52] careful that you're not critical so
[1:02:56] he says he says now here so this is all
[1:02:58] about your position you see Victory is
[1:03:00] found in your position he says it says
[1:03:04] um so this is an an adoption and I just
[1:03:06] pulled the clip out of here but he's
[1:03:07] talking about preaching PL uh preaching
[1:03:09] takes the sinner catches The Sinner
[1:03:12] brings him under condemnation by the
[1:03:13] word he says but the teaching places the
[1:03:16] man positionally he says and we can
[1:03:17] never rightly see so you have to have
[1:03:19] the balance of the five-fold ministry
[1:03:21] maybe that'll be part three and we can
[1:03:23] never rightly be able to have faith
[1:03:26] say what until positionally we know what
[1:03:30] we are do you all know are we all trying
[1:03:32] to to move to the Statue of a perfect
[1:03:35] man I believe that is the desire of
[1:03:38] everybody in the message that is the
[1:03:39] desires of their hearts unless they are
[1:03:41] just completely out
[1:03:43] there what is the first step in the
[1:03:46] pyramid
[1:03:48] faith we can never rightly be able to
[1:03:51] start at the bottom of the pyramid until
[1:03:54] we positionally know what we are right
[1:03:58] how do we know what we are if we're the
[1:04:00] word made flesh we need to know then
[1:04:01] what the word is and if we need to know
[1:04:04] what the word is we understand through
[1:04:06] the scriptures that we need to know I am
[1:04:10] present truth so therefore you need to
[1:04:13] know what was revealed under those Seven
[1:04:16] Seals otherwise it was
[1:04:19] pointless so you need to be saying God I
[1:04:22] don't understand and you need to be
[1:04:24] pushing for that even even you see
[1:04:27] there's something that happens in your
[1:04:28] life me and a brother were talking about
[1:04:30] this something that happens in your life
[1:04:31] and you can hear somebody preach you can
[1:04:33] have a conversation with somebody and
[1:04:34] you can say that person is looking at
[1:04:37] the white stone the white stone is is
[1:04:40] the dream of Junior Jackson brother bham
[1:04:43] grabs a crowbar and the Mysteries were
[1:04:45] written on the outside we can read them
[1:04:47] we can read about serp in the Bible we
[1:04:49] can read about godhead but then he says
[1:04:51] he grabbed a crowbar out of somewhere
[1:04:52] popped the top off said look on this and
[1:04:54] he went
[1:04:56] East West he went West to go get the
[1:04:59] revelation of what was between the
[1:05:02] lines so it's not even written there was
[1:05:05] a space of Silence in heaven for half an
[1:05:08] hour about a half an hour it's not even
[1:05:11] written he say oh brother Chris you just
[1:05:13] lost it because you're adding and taking
[1:05:15] from the word no it's the Revelation
[1:05:18] between the
[1:05:19] lines and when somebody has re
[1:05:22] revelation of that even as an evangelist
[1:05:25] you can hear them when they preach
[1:05:28] they're looking at the white stone you
[1:05:30] see we are called to move up
[1:05:35] higher if God is just a little faster we
[1:05:38] need to get closer to our theophany
[1:05:41] because our theophany moves a little
[1:05:44] faster so the closer we get what is the
[1:05:46] theophany but says it's your word body
[1:05:51] do you know why Enoch
[1:05:53] translated too much word
[1:05:57] I I said that in Flaga and a good friend
[1:05:59] of mine brother Emanuel Salazar who's a
[1:06:01] pastor in New Mexico he goes you had me
[1:06:03] for a second I thought where is he going
[1:06:05] with
[1:06:07] this there was so much word so much
[1:06:09] Revelation that Enoch connected with his
[1:06:12] word
[1:06:13] body that's why you have to be the word
[1:06:16] made
[1:06:17] flesh so if you would be the word made
[1:06:20] flesh do you need more Deliverance
[1:06:21] services or do you need the word
[1:06:23] preached
[1:06:26] the word preached is a Deliverance
[1:06:28] service that's right a man under the
[1:06:31] true anointing with his eyes open can
[1:06:34] teach you can teach you not I'm not
[1:06:37] lifting myself up but for example with
[1:06:39] slides and and and it can go on for an
[1:06:41] hour and a half but when it's the
[1:06:43] teaching of the word through Revelation
[1:06:45] and
[1:06:46] inspiration it can set you on fire like
[1:06:51] you never been on fire before
[1:06:56] but like I said You' got to have the
[1:06:58] fivefold ministry you have to be
[1:07:01] balanced because even an a mature
[1:07:04] Christian needs the Evangelist to get up
[1:07:07] sometimes and preach on the pride of
[1:07:10] life and preach on selfishness yes
[1:07:13] because guess what faith Temperance I
[1:07:16] don't know if it's that right order I
[1:07:18] taught this to the youth for like six or
[1:07:20] eight months and I still can't remember
[1:07:22] the order Faith Temperance knowledge
[1:07:25] brotherly kindness all of these things
[1:07:26] are
[1:07:29] there those are not exciting
[1:07:32] things but a true evangelist will come
[1:07:35] and say you are not
[1:07:37] Temperance but you see if you have the
[1:07:39] foundation of Faith you positionally
[1:07:42] know where you are you are in position
[1:07:45] to receive that word
[1:07:48] amen that is why it's so important that
[1:07:50] you find your position because then you
[1:07:52] are in a place where you can receive
[1:07:55] receive the
[1:07:58] word and if you're in the wrong age
[1:08:00] you're not in the right
[1:08:08] position I I put in here
[1:08:11] um I referenced the children of Israel
[1:08:14] saying we want to go back to Egypt
[1:08:15] that's numbers 115
[1:08:19] to7 I'm closing here
[1:08:25] so
[1:08:27] this bam in questions and answers he
[1:08:31] says this and I paraphrase he says this
[1:08:33] the same message down through Luther
[1:08:36] Wesley Pentecost only something more
[1:08:39] added to it with the revealing of the
[1:08:42] seals that's what he says a so it's a
[1:08:45] further revelation of the same
[1:08:49] gospel that's why you have to be careful
[1:08:52] but when you say you can't say because
[1:08:55] you speak in tongues you are not of God
[1:08:58] it's a furthering of the Gospel same
[1:09:01] gospel but there's a time in a place
[1:09:03] right there's all
[1:09:05] that
[1:09:07] so he says future home of the heavly
[1:09:11] badroom and the Earthly bride the bride
[1:09:13] is the only one who can recognize her
[1:09:15] place in the
[1:09:17] Kingdom recognizing your position in
[1:09:20] Christ comes through a revelation of
[1:09:24] what was revealed red under the Seven
[1:09:26] Seals because what was revealed was the
[1:09:29] entire Plan of Redemption it was says
[1:09:34] the
[1:09:35] book now with it revealed you can look
[1:09:39] between the lines and
[1:09:41] catch Christ in you the hope of
[1:09:45] glory so we have come to a
[1:09:48] place sister VI you want to come we have
[1:09:50] come to a place the Saints of the ages
[1:09:53] longed for the word in flesh again
[1:09:57] within the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:00] recognizing this in the word brings
[1:10:03] relationship with the
[1:10:06] bridegroom
[1:10:08] recognizing that God is in flesh again
[1:10:13] brings relationship with the bridegroom
[1:10:15] because then you are in the position of
[1:10:18] the word and being in that position you
[1:10:21] got to be in the same house you got to
[1:10:23] be in the same bedroom to have a
[1:10:24] relationship ship with your husband
[1:10:27] right so you have to be in the same
[1:10:29] position as
[1:10:31] him and then in the in the as I in
[1:10:35] closing this is what we have we have all
[1:10:37] four
[1:10:38] anointings to combat the pel horse rider
[1:10:42] to combat the to the to combat the the
[1:10:45] the the Antichrist Spirit you need the
[1:10:48] whole picture and we know that if you
[1:10:50] think about it the whole
[1:10:53] picture is The Mercy Seat is in the
[1:10:56] Bride of Jesus Christ so then where are
[1:10:59] the four beasts around the throne right
[1:11:01] they're in the bride of Christ to
[1:11:03] protect Matthew Mark Luke and John to
[1:11:07] protect to protect what to protect you
[1:11:11] amen he you know he said he said okay
[1:11:13] you know the lion age you sent out the
[1:11:15] lion the ox okay you go the man you send
[1:11:19] the man the eagle came Prophet The
[1:11:21] Prophet's message came revealed it but
[1:11:23] then God said now I'm going to come
[1:11:24] myself so he took his whole
[1:11:26] team down into the
[1:11:29] bride the mercy on the bride and now
[1:11:31] this is what you have you have word in
[1:11:34] flesh
[1:11:40] again the word is in the hand of the
[1:11:43] bride and Christ himself is the
[1:11:46] headship the fire that's that's in there
[1:11:49] burning is Christ inside of his bride
[1:11:52] yes where is the word where is God right
[1:11:54] here you Amen in you the Bride of Jesus
[1:11:57] Christ so therefore this is something
[1:12:00] you need to memorize no this is
[1:12:02] something you need to C to revelation of
[1:12:05] cuz when you have revelation of it your
[1:12:06] life
[1:12:07] testifies you've been with the
[1:12:10] bridegroom amen amen amen let's bow our
[1:12:14] heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus thank

[1:12:52] understanding of these things if we
[1:12:53] don't have the Life of Christ we missed
[1:12:55] it then we are no different than the
[1:12:57] Pharisees who understood the scriptures
[1:13:00] but had no Revelation in their hearts
[1:13:03] and missed you we don't want to miss you
