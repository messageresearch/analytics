[47:14] small country
[47:15] in Eastern Europe and uh they they send
[47:20] their greetings to to this church here
[47:23] and I also had a few uh
[47:27] meetings and and calls with the other
[47:30] pastors who knew I would be going to the
[47:32] States and Canada on this trip so
[47:35] they also wanted me to extend
[47:38] their Christian greetings to everywhere
[47:41] I go one of the pastors uh
[47:45] in Lithuania it's about an hour drive
[47:47] from from where we are
[47:50] he he has been a denominational Pastor
[47:54] for many years and then recently has
[47:58] embraced the message and tried to
[48:00] introduce it in his own church and about
[48:04] maybe
[48:05] a few months ago if I'm not mistaken he
[48:08] re-baptized the whole church the name of
[48:10] the Lord Jesus Christ about maybe 30
[48:12] people so they're on fire I mean this
[48:16] you know they they love the message they
[48:18] just consume it they it's it's the first
[48:21] love so and and he he told me wherever
[48:24] you go wherever there's brothers and
[48:25] sisters were where wherever there's
[48:27] leaves of fellowship please send our
[48:30] little fire over there you know that
[48:32] we're burning with
[48:33] and this also been a few churches in
[48:37] Belarus you know the country of Belarus
[48:39] uh there's uh quite well there are some
[48:43] Churches there and um and uh I I talked
[48:46] to some of the pastors and he they they
[48:48] told me hey if you go to the States and
[48:51] Canada just tell them there's some good
[48:53] Believers in Belarus and
[48:56] and we're connected by this Bond uh you
[49:00] know by the love of Christ and we're
[49:02] separated by different reasons here on
[49:05] Earth but in Christ where one body and
[49:08] they wanted me to extend their greetings
[49:11] as well they're working you know while
[49:14] it's day in the country where it's not
[49:17] very possible to preach this message but
[49:19] they still operate and people come new
[49:23] people get baptized and and and the
[49:26] message is moving on in there as well
[49:28] so praise the Lord and it's uh it is a
[49:33] privilege to see old friends here
[49:36] Brother David and his family and also uh
[49:41] the ones from their
[49:43] russian-speaking lands who we've seen in
[49:46] in some other contexts and and some
[49:48] other uh countries before but it's so
[49:52] nice to to meet you here and uh and to
[49:55] be with you here
[49:56] um English is not my native language so
[49:58] please bear with me I haven't preached
[50:01] an English for
[50:03] some four years probably so some some of
[50:06] the parts get rusty you know and and I
[50:10] need a little bit more oil you know in
[50:12] the to kind of get the machine running
[50:15] but uh I trust the Lord can can help us
[50:19] you know and just like this little boy
[50:21] he said I I just know the ABCs you know
[50:24] so Lord I'll just recite the ABCs to you
[50:27] and you can put the words together
[50:29] because it's he who puts the words you
[50:31] know we we cannot do that you know and
[50:34] when brother Paul said come and feed us
[50:36] I'm not too sure about that you know I
[50:39] cannot feed you know I I you know I I I
[50:42] know he can feed because you are he
[50:44] you're his sheep you're his bride you're
[50:46] his church so I'll just stand here and
[50:49] try to catch the thought and and the
[50:52] channel of inspiration to to deliver
[50:54] that
[50:55] as best as I can
[50:58] and um I would uh like to read a
[51:01] scripture with you if you if you can
[51:03] just we'll we'll read a very familiar
[51:06] scripture that's Matthew 16.
[51:10] um 1615 and it's um
[51:15] I'll try to be uh not to be too fast
[51:19] because brother Alex is translating I'm
[51:22] a translator myself so I feel for him
[51:24] when somebody is fast but somewhere
[51:29] around the middle of the service I may
[51:31] might forget about it so
[51:33] so if somebody can remind me
[51:36] please
[51:38] that's Matthew 16 15 if we can stand to
[51:41] honor the word
[51:44] a very familiar conversation uh between
[51:48] Jesus and his disciples and we've read
[51:52] it many a time and it's a very simple
[51:55] thought so I believe God is in
[51:57] Simplicity you know before but Brandon
[52:00] preached the the the the greatest
[52:02] mystery of all he he made sure he
[52:04] preached the longest service before it
[52:06] which was God in Simplicity to make sure
[52:08] people relax and understand God is
[52:11] really simple and he's available to
[52:14] everyone to a child to a teenager to a
[52:16] middle age to an older person and uh
[52:19] that that's the truth in our life so
[52:22] let's let's read the scripture and uh
[52:25] and uh that's Matthew 16 15. he says
[52:30] unto them but whom say ye that I am
[52:34] and Peter Simon Peter uh answered and
[52:38] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[52:41] Living God and Jesus enter answered and
[52:43] said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[52:46] barjona for flesh and blood has not
[52:49] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[52:52] which is in heaven
[52:54] and I'd say unto thee that bowed Peter
[52:57] and Upon This Rock I will build my
[52:59] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[53:01] Prevail and Prevail against it and I
[53:04] will give unto thee the Keys of the
[53:07] Kingdom of Heaven and whosoever thou
[53:09] shalt bind on Earth whatsoever Thou
[53:12] shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in
[53:14] heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt lose on
[53:17] Earth shall be loosed in heaven Heavenly
[53:20] Father we thank you for this wonderful
[53:22] word that you
[53:24] made available for us Lord Jesus not
[53:27] only in this written form but also in
[53:29] the revealed form Jesus in the in the
[53:32] form of Revelation through the message
[53:33] of the hour through the messenger who
[53:36] brought the sense of it who brought the
[53:37] inspiration who brought the the very
[53:39] meaning of those words here Lord Jesus
[53:42] so we want to just tap into this channel
[53:44] we want to be fed by your word and and
[53:48] your power and your spirit this night
[53:50] Lord Jesus and we totally rely upon you
[53:54] because we're we're helpless Lord Jesus
[53:56] we were we are weak we we cannot produce
[54:00] anything out of the scripture Lord Jesus
[54:02] but you can because you have written it
[54:05] Lord Jesus in the sky in the pyramid in
[54:07] the book lord Jesus and now you want to
[54:09] write it in the uh on the tables of our
[54:12] hearts Lord Jesus we we thank you so
[54:15] much Lord Jesus we ask you for a
[54:17] blessing we ask you for the inspiration
[54:19] and Revelation in the name of the Lord
[54:21] Jesus Christ amen
[54:23] sin it can be seated
[54:30] you know it is it is not very
[54:33] complicated to uh to preach in an
[54:36] assembly that has been established in
[54:37] the word for for many years from from
[54:40] what I know this church has been
[54:42] operating for for many years
[54:44] establishing people in in this message
[54:46] of the hour
[54:47] so I believe in churches like this you
[54:51] just have to come out and you know wait
[54:54] until this function of the Holy Ghost
[54:56] and then it's like the story of uh of
[55:00] this wedding that Jesus came remember in
[55:02] John 2 and and and then they they ran
[55:06] out of wine you know and at the wedding
[55:08] and so Mary the church you know Mary the
[55:11] woman she she came to Jesus and she she
[55:15] says you know they ran out of wine so
[55:17] what shall we do and he wasn't really
[55:20] willing to do that if you remember from
[55:23] the Scriptures it says what my time has
[55:25] not come it says what brother Brown
[55:27] interprets it and he says he was testing
[55:29] the faith of Mary as well you know it's
[55:31] how shall she react to to to an action
[55:35] like this in but Mary said you go and
[55:38] talk to him you go he do do whatever he
[55:41] he tells you now to do because she knew
[55:44] if she asked him he will give it you
[55:47] know so that's that's the Assurance we
[55:49] have every church service you know
[55:51] whether that's a Wednesday service
[55:52] whether that's a Tuesday service whether
[55:54] that's a Monday service or what uh or a
[55:57] Sunday service and he says you know his
[55:59] instruction was very easy and he says
[56:01] you you just take those water pots and
[56:03] and you and you fill them with water it
[56:07] says aren't up to the very brim they
[56:09] were they they were filled so so
[56:11] everything was ready you know everything
[56:14] was ready he just had to turn it into
[56:16] wine which it potentially was brother
[56:19] Francis right so when you when you have
[56:21] a a church filled with uh with people
[56:24] who are the water pots and they're
[56:26] filled with the Bible they're filled
[56:28] with a message I mean it's not it didn't
[56:30] take ages for him to you know turn it
[56:32] into a revelation
[56:34] right amen that that's why it's it's uh
[56:38] just like I said it's it's not a you
[56:41] know it's not a big deal you know a your
[56:44] pastor has been uh and Brother David you
[56:47] know they've been to different countries
[56:48] different settings you know where people
[56:49] they don't know the Bible they don't
[56:51] know the message it's it's more
[56:53] difficult over there you know but here I
[56:56] mean it's it's it's it's it's it's a
[56:59] great privilege but it's it's not very
[57:01] difficult to do that because you're
[57:03] filled with with the Bible you're filled
[57:05] with the message you know you come here
[57:07] sometimes you cannot connect the dots
[57:10] together but this is you know what what
[57:12] happens during the service right when
[57:14] you when when you're filled with it
[57:15] right
[57:17] this place here I believe it's it's not
[57:20] the very place where you have to be
[57:21] filled with water we we're this is
[57:24] homework right we we're filled with all
[57:26] water somewhere else right at home uh
[57:29] during uh our free time when we can
[57:31] listen to the world we can uh you know
[57:33] feed on the word and here we come and
[57:35] and then here it becomes wine as well
[57:38] right and praise praise be to Jesus
[57:41] hallelujah amen then it makes it easy
[57:44] for the pastor right it doesn't have to
[57:46] you know tell you did you read this
[57:48] message oh you didn't read this message
[57:49] oh no you did praise the Lord so so it's
[57:54] really wonderful you know to preach to a
[57:57] a wonderful group of people like this
[58:00] and uh we we definitely want to invite
[58:03] him to do that right because he had the
[58:05] power not not the overseer of the
[58:07] wedding and not somebody else not even
[58:09] the disciples but he himself was invited
[58:11] and he turned it into Revelation he
[58:14] turned this word his the the the this
[58:17] little word into into into a life right
[58:20] into into something that was tangible so
[58:23] we we definitely believe he can do that
[58:26] tonight as well praise be to Jesus and
[58:29] you know
[58:31] I'm standing here and you can imagine in
[58:35] my country it's it's somewhere around
[58:38] night time maybe early morning and uh I
[58:41] feel a little bit jet-lagged and how
[58:44] many of you have felt that before you've
[58:46] been to a country somewhere and then
[58:49] it's a different you know time zone and
[58:52] but that's good I mean because it's a
[58:54] spiritual uh type as well you know I was
[58:57] I was reading the scriptures you know
[58:59] and I thought about oh this is just like
[59:02] Paul says in in Thessalonians he says we
[59:05] are the children of light
[59:07] right we are the children of the day we
[59:09] are not the children of the night we're
[59:11] the children of the day so he says uh so
[59:14] let us not sleep well this is I'm
[59:16] addressing too much I'm preaching to
[59:18] myself you know
[59:21] I told brother Sergio I better don't say
[59:24] the phrase uh let's bow our heads
[59:26] because uh because I may not unbow it
[59:29] you know but
[59:32] but then you know Paul says there let us
[59:35] not sleep as do others he says let us
[59:38] watch and be sober it's it's not very
[59:40] easy you know where when when you come
[59:43] from a different country and this it's a
[59:45] different time zone and it's a night
[59:46] time over there and it's it's daytime
[59:49] here but uh he says for they that sleep
[59:53] they sleep in the night you know so if I
[59:56] if I sleep here on you you know or
[59:58] somewhere uh well that that would show
[1:00:01] I'm in the night yeah right you all in
[1:00:04] the day me in the night
[1:00:06] and that would be a problem right so
[1:00:09] um I you know when I was reading this I
[1:00:11] thought to myself you know I would be a
[1:00:13] visual aid today for for that because
[1:00:16] you know I come from a different country
[1:00:18] into this new country here right and my
[1:00:22] biological clock is still there I'm
[1:00:24] accustomed to that the time zone right
[1:00:28] so I feel a bit dizzy I feel a bit
[1:00:31] sleepy you know it's not easy to be
[1:00:33] sober it's not easy to watch everything
[1:00:36] you know you miss out on this and you
[1:00:37] you know you kind of some sometimes you
[1:00:39] abuse a wrong word or or something but
[1:00:42] the scripture says you shouldn't sleep
[1:00:44] you know it speaks to me and says hey
[1:00:47] you're in a different country now in in
[1:00:49] this country this day now it's not night
[1:00:52] it's day you shouldn't sleep now you
[1:00:55] know so this is this is how we're born
[1:00:57] into a new kingdom this is how we're
[1:00:59] born again into a new day you know just
[1:01:01] like we're saying this in the song You
[1:01:04] Know My New Day Has Come and this this
[1:01:06] new day has a different time zone
[1:01:08] at different time zones it's a different
[1:01:10] planet you know it's a different world
[1:01:12] it's a different dimension so you know
[1:01:15] the the the word speaks to me and it
[1:01:17] says you shouldn't live by the old you
[1:01:20] know ways you shouldn't live by the
[1:01:22] laodicean ways you shouldn't live by the
[1:01:24] time zone of laodicea right you
[1:01:27] shouldn't sleep you shouldn't you should
[1:01:28] be sober you should you know you should
[1:01:31] watch you know you should you should uh
[1:01:34] act like you know people in in the
[1:01:36] country there you know
[1:01:37] and so you know uh when I thought about
[1:01:40] that I I thought oh so how should I you
[1:01:43] know if we're born into this new kingdom
[1:01:45] how should we overcome the jet lag we
[1:01:49] just follow the day we just follow all
[1:01:51] the schedules of the day
[1:01:53] we don't sleep in the middle of the day
[1:01:55] or something if even if you feel like it
[1:01:58] right so it's speaking spiritual now
[1:02:01] oh praise the Lord
[1:02:03] and so what happens what happens with
[1:02:06] time you get adjusted to the New Kingdom
[1:02:08] and you become more sober you become you
[1:02:11] you lose the sleepiness you lose the
[1:02:14] dizziness and you function just like
[1:02:16] everybody in the church here you know so
[1:02:19] so it'll take me a few days and now get
[1:02:21] adjusted you know praise the Lord but I
[1:02:23] shouldn't sleep so so that's that's the
[1:02:27] point I believe this message of the hour
[1:02:29] has come you know this this the the
[1:02:31] shout you know it wasn't it it it wasn't
[1:02:35] you know a call it wasn't you know uh
[1:02:37] something really quiet
[1:02:39] it was a shout you know it was it it it
[1:02:42] was meant to wake us up you know in the
[1:02:44] in the Midnight Hour laodicea is in the
[1:02:47] midnight it's the old country right but
[1:02:49] he was inviting them into a new country
[1:02:51] where the bridegroom is right it says
[1:02:54] hey come out uh you know get adjusted to
[1:02:57] the new time zone the bridegroom has
[1:02:59] come lose your jet leg follow you know
[1:03:02] the the new schedules of the day you
[1:03:04] know go with all the citizens of the
[1:03:06] country praise the Lord hallelujah you
[1:03:10] know because you know brother Brown
[1:03:11] taught us we are children of the new
[1:03:13] days as Shalom it says good night you
[1:03:16] know civilization good night all the let
[1:03:19] alone this year
[1:03:20] but New Day Has Come right Hallelujah
[1:03:23] they did that something new it was it
[1:03:25] was brought you know the he says
[1:03:27] something is breaking brother Bram says
[1:03:29] right they need morning
[1:03:30] praise the Lord
[1:03:32] so
[1:03:34] um I I believe this the scripture is
[1:03:36] applicable to us you know because you
[1:03:38] know we we it perfectly matches Matthew
[1:03:41] 24 you know when uh it's just before we
[1:03:45] start you know just a little you know
[1:03:46] something to to to start uh he if you
[1:03:49] remember there's uh there's a lot of uh
[1:03:52] Parables excuse me Jesus uses uh at the
[1:03:55] end of uh uh chapter 24 Matthew 24 and
[1:03:59] then goes into 25 and and our Prophet
[1:04:02] taught us that Jesus taught all the
[1:04:04] seals all the six seals
[1:04:06] uh somewhere around by the verse 46 or
[1:04:11] something and then and then he says and
[1:04:14] then he didn't reveal the seventh seal
[1:04:16] he just just left it in The Parables
[1:04:18] right
[1:04:19] and so every Parable from then on if you
[1:04:22] read them they are about the coming
[1:04:25] every one of them when this man comes
[1:04:28] you know when the host of the house
[1:04:29] comes when uh you know this man with the
[1:04:33] talents comes back when the bridegrooms
[1:04:36] comes back all right
[1:04:38] praise the Lord so all of them are about
[1:04:40] the coming what is the coming brother
[1:04:42] Brian says it's the seventh seal right
[1:04:44] so one of The Parables is actually we
[1:04:47] can actually read it it's it's it's
[1:04:48] Matthew 24 42.
[1:04:51] it's about the same thing I I just
[1:04:53] thought about it today you know about
[1:04:55] being sober and about watching when the
[1:04:58] Lord will come for 20 24 uh 42
[1:05:10] um and and it actually says
[1:05:13] uh that watch therefore the same same
[1:05:16] wording watch therefore for you know not
[1:05:19] what hour your lord does come it's the
[1:05:23] coming of the Lord right it's his second
[1:05:27] coming
[1:05:28] but know this that if the good man of
[1:05:30] the house had known in what watch the
[1:05:33] thief would come he would have watched
[1:05:37] he wouldn't sleep right
[1:05:40] he would know
[1:05:42] praise the Lord
[1:05:44] he would he would have watched and and
[1:05:46] would have suffered his house to be uh
[1:05:49] broken up therefore he also be ready for
[1:05:53] in such an hour as you think not the son
[1:05:57] of man cometh so it's the coming of the
[1:05:59] son of man right praise the Lord oh
[1:06:02] praise the Lord so so the the one of The
[1:06:04] Parables of of the coming it actually
[1:06:07] all those Parables if you go through
[1:06:09] them they depict to us the the picture
[1:06:11] to us the context of the of the second
[1:06:14] coming all of them
[1:06:17] all of them if you go through them one
[1:06:20] by one one of them is this one it says
[1:06:22] uh you you have to be the the good man
[1:06:25] of the house and you have to watch where
[1:06:28] you live watch the time you have to know
[1:06:30] when things will be coming in the coming
[1:06:33] of the Lord right praise the Lord so we
[1:06:36] have to be aware of those things that
[1:06:38] are going around us right and and and
[1:06:40] and and we look at those things and then
[1:06:43] this the the rest of the Parables go
[1:06:45] about the uh the faithful servant that
[1:06:49] is uh appointed by the father appointed
[1:06:53] by the
[1:06:54] Master to give food in due season yeah
[1:06:57] yeah right amen
[1:06:59] so and then it says when the Lord comes
[1:07:03] back he'll he says he'll be blessed this
[1:07:05] this man will be blessed so what what
[1:07:08] does that show to us it shows to us that
[1:07:10] in the days of the second coming where
[1:07:12] we're living in now
[1:07:13] amen I believe we're in the second
[1:07:15] coming amen amen because the shout has
[1:07:18] gone on
[1:07:19] yes it's in the process we're not we're
[1:07:21] basically not waiting for the right to
[1:07:23] we're in the rapture
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:26] oh you know because sometimes we say you
[1:07:28] know oh I'll look for the Rapture you
[1:07:30] know this all best house and the Satan's
[1:07:33] Eden
[1:07:34] Odyssey and all of this I mean uh I'm
[1:07:37] not waiting for for that you know I'm
[1:07:39] I'm active already you know yes the
[1:07:41] Rapture is on
[1:07:43] it is on you know we we're just making
[1:07:46] it you know come come closer you know by
[1:07:48] how how much we take part in this
[1:07:52] kingdom of God so so it says they'll be
[1:07:54] servants who will be giving food in the
[1:07:57] due season under the in the context of
[1:08:00] the second coming and then he says there
[1:08:02] will be evil servants who will be
[1:08:03] beating their co uh co-servants right
[1:08:07] being drunk and all of those things and
[1:08:10] uh all of that is the context of the
[1:08:12] second coming as well this should happen
[1:08:15] this must happen this will happen and we
[1:08:17] cannot stop it
[1:08:20] this is inevitable this is the word you
[1:08:22] know so sometimes it's painful but this
[1:08:25] is what happens yes and then we go into
[1:08:28] into the ten virgins
[1:08:30] right this next Parable in Matthew 25 is
[1:08:34] is the Ten virgins so this this is what
[1:08:36] will be happening in the bride as well
[1:08:38] right under the second coming right and
[1:08:41] then we go into the talents
[1:08:43] amen pieces of silver right from what I
[1:08:48] know I may be wrong but the history says
[1:08:50] these were big pieces of silver you know
[1:08:53] that he actually left Silver's is a
[1:08:55] Redemption so he left the the church
[1:08:58] some with with uh with one some with two
[1:09:00] some with five right
[1:09:02] praise the Lord and then when he did
[1:09:05] that he uh he actually says I'm giving
[1:09:07] you two but I see four
[1:09:11] amen he didn't say I give you two I want
[1:09:15] to go two back no he says I I give you
[1:09:18] two but I see four
[1:09:21] the two are invisible but when I come
[1:09:23] back I want them to be visible
[1:09:26] yeah amen yeah praise the Lord and so I
[1:09:30] want them to be tangible don't talk
[1:09:32] about it give it to me
[1:09:35] praise the Lord just like brother Brahm
[1:09:37] says about the token he says we it's not
[1:09:39] talking about the token it's applying
[1:09:42] the token it's having the token on
[1:09:44] display oh praise the Lord so then then
[1:09:47] we have the parable of uh of of the
[1:09:50] shepherd and the Sheep right about the
[1:09:52] you know separating them into the left
[1:09:54] and right and then we have the the this
[1:09:56] parable of uh uh who who did I feed and
[1:10:00] who did I uh you know give clothes to
[1:10:02] and who did I visit in the prison and
[1:10:05] all of is the context of the second
[1:10:07] coming all of this reveals to what will
[1:10:10] be going on oh praise the Lord
[1:10:13] thank you Jesus so we're not in the
[1:10:16] darkness we're we are in the day in the
[1:10:19] day it's all visible you know it's it
[1:10:22] you can see all those things happening
[1:10:24] amen so so it's really wonderful for we
[1:10:28] I'm we're so blessed to have the
[1:10:30] messenger of the hour which was our eyes
[1:10:32] have that was anointed and I mean we can
[1:10:37] see those things this is what makes the
[1:10:39] the night a day for us
[1:10:42] praise be to Jesus amen
[1:10:46] thank you Father so so if we go back to
[1:10:49] this small scripture that we've just
[1:10:51] read
[1:10:52] it's a very familiar and simple
[1:10:54] scripture and uh uh you know it was a
[1:10:58] conversation between Jesus and his
[1:11:00] disciples
[1:11:01] and he was uh I I love every bit of it
[1:11:05] you know I love every every word of this
[1:11:08] conversation makes sense you know the
[1:11:10] Everything Jesus said and everything the
[1:11:12] Bible says every thought by him says you
[1:11:15] know every comma makes sense you know so
[1:11:17] so here when he he spoke to them about
[1:11:20] did they recognize who he was you know
[1:11:22] and um you know what were the opinions
[1:11:25] of the other people and if you remember
[1:11:26] they said you know some say you're this
[1:11:28] prophet and some say this was which was
[1:11:31] partially partially true
[1:11:33] he was that prophet
[1:11:36] he was John he was Jeremiah
[1:11:38] but I was only part of him you know
[1:11:41] but then he was he was wondering if his
[1:11:43] disciples see the fullness of the word
[1:11:46] not the part you know partial message or
[1:11:49] partial you know the scriptures or
[1:11:51] partial word of it which was true to
[1:11:54] some extent but it says but uh but who
[1:11:56] say ye who do you say that I am
[1:12:00] oh I love even the the question you know
[1:12:03] because he gives the hint he gives the
[1:12:05] answer in the question he says but who
[1:12:09] do you say I am
[1:12:12] [Laughter]
[1:12:13] he was always giving them hints you know
[1:12:16] in those in those questions praise me to
[1:12:19] Jesus because he is the I am he is the
[1:12:22] present tense God he is not the god of
[1:12:25] the past he's not the god of you know
[1:12:27] the future he is the god of the present
[1:12:29] tense
[1:12:30] amen that which makes him the god of the
[1:12:33] past and the future as well right so
[1:12:36] praise the Lord you know he he's asked
[1:12:38] him the do you recognize me as The God
[1:12:41] Who is the I am
[1:12:44] right
[1:12:46] who do you say that I am and then Simon
[1:12:48] Peter answered and he said Thou Art the
[1:12:52] Christ the son of the Living God you're
[1:12:56] not the part of it you are the fullness
[1:12:58] of it because in Christ there was a
[1:13:00] fullness of the godhead bodily praise be
[1:13:03] to Jesus and says you are the son of
[1:13:06] that Living God you the product of that
[1:13:09] eternal spirit that was there and then
[1:13:11] it was formed into the logos it was
[1:13:13] formed into the Christ
[1:13:15] and you you can you can imagine such a
[1:13:18] formula such a wording come out of a
[1:13:20] simple uh
[1:13:22] fishermen
[1:13:24] I I think he was surprised when he heard
[1:13:27] himself saying that
[1:13:30] he was like almost like I should put it
[1:13:33] down you know I should because he
[1:13:35] probably hasn't heard himself say that
[1:13:37] before right
[1:13:39] because Jesus he he noticed that right
[1:13:43] away and he says this is not Peter
[1:13:46] this is not his terminology
[1:13:49] amen and since that was something from
[1:13:52] above that was something which is not
[1:13:54] natural to this man who is just a simple
[1:13:57] fisherman and all of a sudden he gives
[1:13:59] the most profound answer to the question
[1:14:02] with nobody around there was saying
[1:14:04] Jeremiah they were saying John or
[1:14:06] something else but then the simple
[1:14:08] fisherman
[1:14:09] he gives the full answer you are the
[1:14:12] Christ you are the Christ you are the
[1:14:14] product you're the son of the Living God
[1:14:17] Amen oh thank you Father Hallelujah
[1:14:22] and so when that happened Jesus spotted
[1:14:25] he he emphasized that and he says this
[1:14:28] is sub Supernatural this thing that is
[1:14:31] going on here is a revelation this is
[1:14:33] not a simple phrase this is not Peter
[1:14:36] now talking
[1:14:37] this is not just his nature you know
[1:14:39] well let me speak you know I want to
[1:14:41] build three Tabernacles here or you know
[1:14:44] or whatever you know that that Peter was
[1:14:46] you know it was natural for him to do
[1:14:48] that but this was Supernatural this was
[1:14:51] a revelation coming from the Lord afresh
[1:14:54] on a simple man
[1:14:56] and all the disciples are like oh
[1:15:00] he he does speak some good thoughts
[1:15:03] sometimes you know
[1:15:05] praise the Lord you know and then and
[1:15:08] then Jesus when he goes on and he says
[1:15:11] and then Jesus answered
[1:15:14] and then Jesus answered you know
[1:15:18] well he already answered in the in the
[1:15:20] question and then Peter answered by the
[1:15:23] Revelation and then Jesus answered right
[1:15:27] and and he said he is giving he a more
[1:15:31] detailed picture of the same answer of a
[1:15:34] shorter phrase that that Peter produced
[1:15:36] you're a Christ you uh you are something
[1:15:39] that came out of God and then he says
[1:15:42] Jesus answered and said the hip says
[1:15:44] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah
[1:15:50] amen oh I love it so much he calls Simon
[1:15:54] by his natural name
[1:15:56] right here he will proceed to the to his
[1:15:59] new name a little bit further
[1:16:01] right but here he calls him by base you
[1:16:04] know simple family name you know or
[1:16:06] whatever and he and what he actually
[1:16:09] does here he he says you are Simon but
[1:16:13] you are blessed
[1:16:15] amen even though you are an Earthly man
[1:16:18] and you and he even mentions his father
[1:16:22] right and he says you are Simon bar
[1:16:25] Jonah which means you are a son of Jonah
[1:16:30] you're an Earthly man
[1:16:32] you're born from a national father
[1:16:35] but you are blessed
[1:16:37] praiseless
[1:16:39] blessed Jesus continuous and he says you
[1:16:42] blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah
[1:16:46] you're a son of Jonah brother Brahm says
[1:16:49] I am a son of Charles and Ella Branham
[1:16:54] all right so if it was brother Brandon
[1:16:56] it would be blessed Thou Art Thou
[1:16:58] William the son of Charles
[1:17:01] right
[1:17:02] right that's right and then it goes on
[1:17:06] for the flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:17:09] it unto thee
[1:17:10] so Jesus is still talking about the
[1:17:12] Earthly things Earthly father Earthly
[1:17:14] parents Flesh and Blood your
[1:17:17] relationship with this world
[1:17:19] and then and then it's it's like a plane
[1:17:22] you know I see this picture as a plane
[1:17:24] or we've just spent some time on the
[1:17:25] three planes you know and and my
[1:17:27] favorite moment is and when is when it
[1:17:30] it takes off
[1:17:31] no no it it it it's it's on that line
[1:17:35] for some time you know it gets some
[1:17:37] speed it's still catching you know the
[1:17:40] Earth it's still uh running but it's
[1:17:42] catching the speed and this wonderful
[1:17:45] moment you know the degree changes you
[1:17:48] know the the front part goes up and and
[1:17:50] then you're like you know and there's a
[1:17:53] short pain you know like Broadband says
[1:17:55] during the Rapture you know it will be
[1:17:57] just a short oh okay sometimes not very
[1:18:01] short but but brother Brian says the the
[1:18:03] you know the Rapture will be a short
[1:18:05] pain you know something you know
[1:18:07] clicking where and then here you know
[1:18:10] Jesus goes on he says you are a Simon
[1:18:12] you are a son of Jonah you have a
[1:18:15] wonderful Earthly father and then the
[1:18:18] flesh and blood but he says it has not
[1:18:20] revealed it unto you but my father who
[1:18:23] is in heaven
[1:18:24] this is a different relationship this is
[1:18:27] a different father
[1:18:29] in other words he says you are a father
[1:18:31] of Jonah but you are also I mean a son
[1:18:34] of Jonah but you are also a son of a
[1:18:37] heavenly father and he is revealing it
[1:18:41] to you
[1:18:42] your father your dad your mom they
[1:18:45] cannot reveal they can lead you unto it
[1:18:47] they can teach you about it they can you
[1:18:50] know speak about it they can take you to
[1:18:52] Sunday school they can to make good
[1:18:53] friends you know with some other
[1:18:55] families that's wonderful they can read
[1:18:57] the word they can you know listen to the
[1:18:59] message with you that's wonderful praise
[1:19:01] the Lord but friends you got a Heavenly
[1:19:05] Father
[1:19:06] who is able to reveal it to you
[1:19:09] personally praise be to Jesus and then
[1:19:13] aren't you blessed then
[1:19:16] yes this is why he says blessed Abba
[1:19:20] you're a son of a fisherman you're a son
[1:19:23] of you are a bar Jonah but you are
[1:19:26] blessed because you can receive
[1:19:27] Revelations from a different father
[1:19:30] capital letter father who is in heaven
[1:19:34] who do you you say I am and my father is
[1:19:39] in heaven it's present tense praise the
[1:19:42] Lord hallelujah so my father oh my
[1:19:45] goodness so so in other words Jesus also
[1:19:48] says he's my father and he is also your
[1:19:51] father
[1:19:52] oh we have a common father with Jesus
[1:19:55] oh that that that you know that inspires
[1:19:58] me a lot
[1:19:59] if he was the son of God you know and he
[1:20:02] was you know leading a life that he he
[1:20:04] was leading on Earth and I'm a son of
[1:20:07] the same father oh
[1:20:09] thank you Jesus
[1:20:12] Hallelujah
[1:20:14] so he takes off you know from the
[1:20:16] Earthly Dimension from the Earthly
[1:20:18] things from the Earthly home from the
[1:20:20] Earthly parents from the Earthly Dead
[1:20:23] from the Flesh and Blood realm he takes
[1:20:26] off into Heavens into the where the
[1:20:29] father is right and then he he continues
[1:20:34] on and he says and I say also unto you
[1:20:37] he adds more detail to you says Thou Art
[1:20:40] Peter
[1:20:43] hey
[1:20:44] he just called him Simon he just called
[1:20:47] the name of his father but here he calls
[1:20:49] him by his new name
[1:20:52] amen amen that's his new name
[1:20:55] I was given a different Kingdom
[1:20:58] a different identification you know we
[1:21:00] we know the name is is in nature you
[1:21:02] know it's it actually is a uh why do we
[1:21:06] baptize people in the name of the Lord
[1:21:07] Jesus Christ in a different name because
[1:21:09] we want them to have the nature of that
[1:21:11] name right
[1:21:13] praise be to Jesus amen so so then he
[1:21:17] says uh I also said unto thee Thou Art
[1:21:19] Peter his new name and Upon This Rock I
[1:21:23] will build my church and the Gates of
[1:21:26] Hell shall not Prevail Prevail against
[1:21:29] amen so so here Jesus is revealing that
[1:21:33] he is building his own church
[1:21:38] he is planning to build his own church
[1:21:41] oh that's exciting you know Jesus will
[1:21:44] have a church a spotless Church
[1:21:48] a Victorious Church
[1:21:51] and now in here he actually shows to us
[1:21:55] what this or who this church will be
[1:21:58] made of
[1:22:00] right exactly and he says Thou Art Peter
[1:22:03] and upon this frog I'll build my church
[1:22:05] and and you know brother bran takes a
[1:22:07] lot of time to explain he's he didn't
[1:22:09] build it on Peter
[1:22:12] and he says he didn't build it on the
[1:22:14] flesh and blood
[1:22:15] right
[1:22:16] so praise the Lord
[1:22:19] I mean this church here is is not flesh
[1:22:22] and blood
[1:22:23] this church here is not Peter Simon by
[1:22:26] our Jonas
[1:22:28] right
[1:22:30] these are the people with new names
[1:22:33] right
[1:22:34] with a new life in them and then with
[1:22:38] this building material you can build a
[1:22:40] church he will build a church he because
[1:22:43] that's his church it's his own church
[1:22:45] right oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah and
[1:22:49] he says and Upon This Rock I will build
[1:22:52] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[1:22:55] not Prevail against it so he says if you
[1:22:59] want to see my own church then you have
[1:23:02] to see people who are reborn
[1:23:05] into a different kingdom yes
[1:23:10] yes they are not living in jet lag
[1:23:12] they're not living in Old civilization
[1:23:14] they're not living in the old ways they
[1:23:16] are not living in their own life because
[1:23:18] that's the old name that's that's Simon
[1:23:21] that's barjona right we're not living by
[1:23:24] this we're living by Peter right and and
[1:23:27] then brother Byram explains Peter is
[1:23:29] what Petros is is a stone it's a small
[1:23:32] Stone
[1:23:33] that's right it's not a big Stone it's a
[1:23:35] small Stone because we're so to speak
[1:23:38] we're we're uh the chips of an old block
[1:23:40] where where you know where ships of a
[1:23:43] big rock
[1:23:44] amen why is he here because he is a part
[1:23:47] of that rock
[1:23:49] he's he's a Rocco right but he's a small
[1:23:52] one how can you build the church on a
[1:23:54] small rock
[1:23:55] he's too small to build on it
[1:23:58] he's a part of that he's a pillar in the
[1:24:01] church right he's mentioned as a pillar
[1:24:04] of the church right but but he's not the
[1:24:07] only one right and then says he's not he
[1:24:10] didn't even build it on Jesus that's
[1:24:12] right right he built it on the
[1:24:14] revelation of who he was
[1:24:17] praise be to Jesus oh so this is this is
[1:24:21] how he builds his church he's building
[1:24:24] it on the people who are able to catch a
[1:24:28] revelation Hallelujah he's building it
[1:24:31] is using them as a building material
[1:24:35] the foundation is the revelation of
[1:24:38] Jesus Christ and then he uses those
[1:24:40] stones he cannot use all the stones but
[1:24:43] he can use those that are catching this
[1:24:46] channel of God
[1:24:48] right that's right
[1:24:49] that's right oh praise be to Jesus let's
[1:24:51] let's maybe read one quote he I love it
[1:24:54] but he explains Peter in questions and
[1:24:57] answers in Hebrews that's 1957 paragraph
[1:25:01] 169 and he says now watch flesh and
[1:25:04] blood has not revealed this to you Plumb
[1:25:06] over to the Lord Jesus says but my
[1:25:08] Father which is in heaven has revealed
[1:25:10] this to you and Upon This Rock the
[1:25:13] revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This
[1:25:16] Rock I will build my church and the
[1:25:18] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it
[1:25:20] that's what he said
[1:25:22] and he said uh and I say that you are
[1:25:26] Peter and I'll give you the Keys of the
[1:25:30] Kingdom amen amen
[1:25:33] amen that's another part of that
[1:25:35] scripture
[1:25:36] he says I give you the Keys of the
[1:25:38] Kingdom
[1:25:39] so so he in that church that Jesus
[1:25:43] builds he will have people who will not
[1:25:46] live by their natural ways
[1:25:49] he will not live they will not live by
[1:25:52] what the you know bar Journal said right
[1:25:54] that's right they will not live by flesh
[1:25:57] and blood they will be able to catch
[1:25:59] spiritual Revelations
[1:26:02] in an unpredicted uh context
[1:26:06] you know it wasn't a you know a
[1:26:08] classroom with homework you know so come
[1:26:11] on guys you know you know the homework
[1:26:13] so so who do you say I am
[1:26:16] no this was absolutely spontaneous I
[1:26:19] believe you know it was just a setting
[1:26:21] you know there maybe they've been
[1:26:22] shopping and eating or you know standing
[1:26:25] and talking or something and all of a
[1:26:26] sudden in a very simple context
[1:26:29] boom Peter gets the Revelation he gets
[1:26:33] the signal from above he gets this
[1:26:35] signal from the father from heaven so
[1:26:38] these people who Jesus will use as
[1:26:41] building materials for his own church
[1:26:44] who will be his church they will not
[1:26:47] live by the by the family name
[1:26:50] they will not live by uh flesh and blood
[1:26:53] they will receive uh those uh
[1:26:58] signals from heaven
[1:27:00] they will have a new name
[1:27:03] Peters not Simons
[1:27:05] praise be to Jesus
[1:27:07] and they'll also have the keys
[1:27:10] he was only a type of those members of
[1:27:13] the church they will have the keys
[1:27:17] and so here in the court I'll come
[1:27:19] continue to say and he says and I say
[1:27:21] you were Peter and I'll give to you the
[1:27:23] Keys of the Kingdom and whatever he says
[1:27:25] because you have got a spiritual open
[1:27:30] Channel between here and Heaven
[1:27:34] praise be to Jesus so that's the key if
[1:27:38] you have a channel open between you and
[1:27:40] Heaven between here in heaven and calls
[1:27:45] it a spiritual open channel
[1:27:48] functioning
[1:27:52] and that that's the key that's right
[1:27:54] amen and he says Flesh and Blood you
[1:27:57] never took a seminist seminary you never
[1:27:59] took a schooling you never took a course
[1:28:01] of theology but you depended on God and
[1:28:04] God revealed it to you and it's
[1:28:06] absolutely the clear scriptures that
[1:28:09] tied together I say your Peter and I'll
[1:28:11] give to you the keys and what you bind
[1:28:13] on Earth I'll bind in heaven what you
[1:28:15] lose on Earth I'll lose in heaven
[1:28:18] hallelujah
[1:28:20] oh praise be to Jesus and the other
[1:28:23] message brother Brahm says in the
[1:28:24] questions uh oh sorry that's God of his
[1:28:27] evil age he says he unlocked something
[1:28:29] it was a mystery yeah
[1:28:32] Peter was able to unlock Mysteries
[1:28:35] that's the building materials we have in
[1:28:37] the in the Church of Jesus
[1:28:39] in the Church of Christ
[1:28:41] amen people who will be able to unlock
[1:28:43] Mysteries
[1:28:45] first of all in their own lives
[1:28:48] yeah because we are a walking mystery
[1:28:53] we we don't understand a lot of things
[1:28:55] you know going on in our lives right
[1:28:58] but God when he comes down he he he
[1:29:01] makes it plain to us through the word
[1:29:05] thank you Father
[1:29:07] Hallelujah so so what was the keys that
[1:29:09] Peter had you know we when we go back
[1:29:11] when we read Matthew 20 we read Matthew
[1:29:14] 16 he got the keys but he never used
[1:29:17] them uh until basically Acts 2 38 right
[1:29:22] because then he was filled with the Holy
[1:29:24] Ghost
[1:29:25] and when the challenge came and the
[1:29:27] people said so you know men and Brethren
[1:29:30] what shall we do you know what what
[1:29:31] shall we do now we crucified Christ
[1:29:34] what shall we do and then Peter came out
[1:29:37] under the same inspiration
[1:29:40] with the same key
[1:29:42] and he made three clicks
[1:29:46] repent amen
[1:29:49] and then and then you will receive the
[1:29:51] remission of your sins
[1:29:53] and then you will receive the Holy Ghost
[1:29:54] that's right three clicks of whatever
[1:29:57] you call that three turns of of the same
[1:30:00] key right repent remission of sins and
[1:30:04] then and then you got the Holy Ghost
[1:30:07] oh you know we we've read the scripture
[1:30:10] many times right we've been baptized in
[1:30:13] the water with the from the same
[1:30:15] scripture right
[1:30:17] and then uh uh so so what what what
[1:30:20] actually happens you know this the same
[1:30:23] principle
[1:30:24] from you know I've been reading this a
[1:30:27] month ago and I I thought but this is a
[1:30:30] principle of life
[1:30:33] I use the same key if I realize that I
[1:30:36] realized that just a not a long time ago
[1:30:39] I'm using the same key if I have it the
[1:30:42] the open Channel with with Christ I'm
[1:30:44] using the same key every day
[1:30:48] right
[1:30:50] because in every action in whatever you
[1:30:52] do you you first repent because you have
[1:30:54] to lose the old ways then you receive
[1:30:57] the permission of your
[1:30:58] remission of your sins
[1:31:00] you're forgiven you're free
[1:31:03] and then you fill that up with the Holy
[1:31:06] Ghost he fills that up with the Holy
[1:31:08] Ghost right oh praise the Lord this this
[1:31:11] happens every day
[1:31:14] I Die daily yeah Paul says brother Brown
[1:31:17] interprets it and he says me and Mita
[1:31:19] which says we stand on our knees and we
[1:31:22] say help us Lord
[1:31:24] Lord forgive us for whatever we've done
[1:31:26] he says we die daily
[1:31:28] amen praise the Lord so what do we do we
[1:31:31] empty Our Lives we we return you know we
[1:31:34] turn in the other direction right 180
[1:31:38] degrees we we turn around we make this
[1:31:43] place empty of from whatever unbelief we
[1:31:47] had during the day right
[1:31:49] and then this empty place can be filled
[1:31:52] with more Holy Ghost
[1:31:54] Hallelujah so that's one of the keys
[1:31:56] that's the key you know that's that's
[1:31:58] the key we're using every day
[1:32:00] hallelujah oh you you know that's just
[1:32:04] like brogram says you know uh
[1:32:07] uh he says
[1:32:09] in the book of Isaiah 6 you know he he
[1:32:13] had to do the same thing right he had to
[1:32:16] repent he says oh Lord I'm I'm a man of
[1:32:18] unclean lips
[1:32:20] I live among the people who also have
[1:32:23] unclean lips right so what do I do
[1:32:26] I I feel sorry about right
[1:32:29] I repent for it and then there's a
[1:32:32] cleansing that comes from the surface
[1:32:35] and then there's a commission coming
[1:32:37] there's a feeling with the Holy Ghost so
[1:32:40] this is our daily life
[1:32:42] this is the key we use in the Kingdom to
[1:32:45] unlock more territory praise be to Jesus
[1:32:49] sometimes we get stuck in this because
[1:32:51] we don't want to repent we don't want to
[1:32:53] you know fix some things you know we
[1:32:55] want the remission of the sins but we
[1:32:57] don't want to repent
[1:32:59] well that's natural you know that starts
[1:33:02] from Adam you know he didn't want that
[1:33:04] he wanted permission of his sins every
[1:33:06] mission of your sins but he you know he
[1:33:09] he didn't want to repent you know
[1:33:11] oh but but you know Jesus he shows uh
[1:33:16] through Peter he shows the right process
[1:33:20] oh because when Jesus was leaving he
[1:33:23] actually said what should we preach in
[1:33:25] the in in the Gospel of Luke he says and
[1:33:27] and this Kingdom should be preaching
[1:33:29] repentance and remission of sins
[1:33:33] right this is the principle of the
[1:33:35] Kingdom this is the principle of the
[1:33:37] church that that Jesus is actually
[1:33:39] building
[1:33:40] this is what hinders us sometimes right
[1:33:42] as as human beings
[1:33:44] getting stuck in the Simon barjona uh
[1:33:48] you know uh
[1:33:49] uh part of it you know in that
[1:33:51] particular realm you know flesh and
[1:33:54] blood but then when we realize we're
[1:33:56] wrong we go forth
[1:33:59] we fix it that's right you make it right
[1:34:01] God forgives that and he fills that
[1:34:04] place with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:07] amen hallelujah oh praise be to Jesus
[1:34:11] you know so so when when we read Peter
[1:34:14] in second Peter 1 when he uh takes the
[1:34:17] Pyramid of the virtues
[1:34:19] he uses the same key that's the same
[1:34:21] Peter with the same key
[1:34:23] right it says you you add to your faith
[1:34:26] virtue and then add this and add
[1:34:28] patience and all this how do we add this
[1:34:30] first we have to die to ourselves
[1:34:33] to to make room for God's virtue to
[1:34:37] God's patience God's knowledge to work
[1:34:41] through US amen amen and and this is how
[1:34:44] we achieve the Kingdom right this is how
[1:34:46] this this Open Access is given to us in
[1:34:50] into the kingdom of his son right oh
[1:34:53] praise be to Jesus thank you Father so
[1:34:56] so this is our daily life this is our
[1:34:58] daily principle oh thank you Jesus this
[1:35:00] this is how Jesus is actually building
[1:35:03] his church out of these kind of people
[1:35:07] oh it's so wonderful and it's really
[1:35:10] simple you know it's a it's a it's I
[1:35:12] mean as simple as that
[1:35:15] oh father so so when we when we read
[1:35:18] that
[1:35:20] we realize that Peter had the key and
[1:35:23] and this same key was actually
[1:35:26] uh given
[1:35:28] given to us as well you know and we we
[1:35:31] cannot produce that ourselves you know
[1:35:33] we cannot repent and we cannot remit sin
[1:35:36] our on our own and we cannot fill
[1:35:39] ourselves with the Holy Ghost
[1:35:41] right he has to do that he gives the
[1:35:44] repentance because true repentance is a
[1:35:46] gift it comes from God Amen hallelujah
[1:35:50] it's a moment of inspiration if someone
[1:35:52] when something strikes you and then you
[1:35:54] repent from there huh and then you how
[1:35:57] how do you receive you know freedom from
[1:36:00] your sins it's only God who can do that
[1:36:03] amen how do you get the Holy Ghost can
[1:36:06] you give somebody a Holy Ghost
[1:36:08] no
[1:36:09] he can give it to you amen that's his
[1:36:12] work
[1:36:13] oh praise be to Jesus and then and then
[1:36:16] when we we read this message of statue
[1:36:20] of a perfect man where brother
[1:36:21] interprets all the Pyramid of Virtues he
[1:36:24] says this is the man
[1:36:26] it says uh and this being completed
[1:36:31] is a servant of God in the Church of God
[1:36:35] right in the Church of Christ amen that
[1:36:39] he builds that's going in the rapture
[1:36:44] Hallelujah he calls it the seven steps
[1:36:46] right so how do we do that we we go by
[1:36:49] the same principle of the key we repent
[1:36:51] and then we receive the remission of our
[1:36:54] sins and then we this place in our lives
[1:36:57] is filled with more Holy Ghost
[1:37:00] that's why we sing I want more of Jesus
[1:37:03] right where I want more of him oh thank
[1:37:06] you Father
[1:37:08] so so this this is a wonderful message
[1:37:10] that we that that we have this this is
[1:37:14] something really astounding you know so
[1:37:16] uh so if we if we go back to
[1:37:21] uh to to this this scripture
[1:37:25] uh in in Matthew he says I will build my
[1:37:30] church and then
[1:37:31] this church will not
[1:37:35] be overcome by the gates of hell
[1:37:41] you know why because you cannot catch
[1:37:43] them on a
[1:37:45] uh on a fleshly realm
[1:37:50] this is basically where
[1:37:52] the devil Catches Us right
[1:37:54] on the on this level of Flesh and Blood
[1:37:57] Simon barjona
[1:37:59] right this is where he can defeat it
[1:38:02] easily
[1:38:03] easily seconds and this thought
[1:38:06] overcomes you seconds and this feeling
[1:38:08] fills you seconds in the sin is in you
[1:38:12] right why because we're still in the
[1:38:16] flesh and blood and we sometimes operate
[1:38:18] In the Flesh and Blood that's why we we
[1:38:20] lose the battles but then Jesus says
[1:38:23] I'll build my church out of these kind
[1:38:25] of materials right
[1:38:28] and he was a Capstone he was the main
[1:38:31] example of how that was happening if you
[1:38:33] read how uh how can I overcome what Bram
[1:38:37] says overcoming he says is uh is is
[1:38:40] trying to pertain the life in you right
[1:38:43] you you remember this old lock that says
[1:38:46] it was in the church it was in the in
[1:38:49] the in the woods but it was in and it
[1:38:51] was in the water but it says it was
[1:38:53] Hollow right it says it didn't retain
[1:38:56] the life in itself so so what we need to
[1:38:58] do is to we have to retain the life of
[1:39:01] Jesus Christ you know
[1:39:03] praise be to Jesus amen so so when when
[1:39:07] the devil he he came to defeat the
[1:39:10] Capstone of that church
[1:39:12] right and the Cornerstone of that church
[1:39:15] he showed us how to function not on the
[1:39:18] Flesh and Blood rail because you can you
[1:39:20] can imagine no Jesus he was just
[1:39:21] baptized freshly baptized you know some
[1:39:24] of you may have been uh freshly but we
[1:39:26] just had you know some people who have
[1:39:28] freshly baptized you know in in our
[1:39:31] country and and then that's Matthew 3
[1:39:34] right when Jesus was baptized by John
[1:39:36] the Baptist you know and and then and
[1:39:39] then from then on he was led by the
[1:39:42] spirit
[1:39:43] from then on when this Dove uh descended
[1:39:48] upon him he was led by the spirit
[1:39:52] and he was led into a place which was
[1:39:54] not a nice place into a Wilderness into
[1:39:57] a desert
[1:39:59] but why did he go
[1:40:01] because he trusted the dove that's it
[1:40:04] right he was led by the dove he couldn't
[1:40:07] he couldn't grow himself anymore all
[1:40:09] right he he was led by the dove and so
[1:40:12] if the dove was leading him and the
[1:40:15] devil's saying now we have to fast for
[1:40:17] 40 days
[1:40:18] I mean this this was weird this was
[1:40:21] difficult this was hard on the body in
[1:40:24] that case
[1:40:25] but how did how did Jesus survive
[1:40:28] because he was led by the dove if if God
[1:40:32] led him into it he will he will survive
[1:40:36] right so and then we read it in in in
[1:40:39] Matthew 4 when he when the 40 days were
[1:40:43] over and then he in his flesh because he
[1:40:47] was a flesh man as well
[1:40:49] right it was he was brother says he was
[1:40:51] totally God and he was totally human
[1:40:53] right so so this man he was hungry after
[1:40:58] 40 days he was weak and then this moment
[1:41:01] of weakness of his flesh and blood
[1:41:07] this is when the Devil comes and and he
[1:41:10] has this idea he's he he has this nice
[1:41:14] idea he has a nice business plan for him
[1:41:17] actually
[1:41:19] it was it wasn't just an idea it was a
[1:41:21] whole business plan you know because he
[1:41:24] says now
[1:41:25] you're you're hungry
[1:41:29] Jesus was just 30 something years old
[1:41:31] you know it was a young man you know man
[1:41:35] they they hungry after a few hours
[1:41:37] you know
[1:41:39] and here's it's it's 40 days
[1:41:42] okay can you imagine that
[1:41:44] and so Jesus he when he goes through
[1:41:46] through that trial
[1:41:48] to be tried with the devil into Into the
[1:41:50] Wilderness he's weak in his flesh and
[1:41:53] blood and in that particular moment the
[1:41:55] gates of hell are coming
[1:41:57] the gates of hell are there and they
[1:42:00] have a proposal right there when you're
[1:42:02] weak when we're weak and he says no
[1:42:06] come on you're a Creator I've seen you
[1:42:10] operate before
[1:42:11] so why didn't you why don't you do this
[1:42:14] you just you just take the stone which
[1:42:16] is inedible but you can make you can
[1:42:20] make a bread out of it
[1:42:22] all right
[1:42:23] you can make a bread out of it
[1:42:26] you can make a daily bread out of it
[1:42:29] come on
[1:42:30] nobody in the wilderness no people
[1:42:32] around
[1:42:34] right nobody will see it nobody will
[1:42:37] even know you you did it
[1:42:40] you will know no you did it
[1:42:43] yeah right so this proposal this
[1:42:45] business idea comes into his head
[1:42:48] because I mean if somebody told you you
[1:42:51] know there's a lot of stone you know in
[1:42:53] this country here right and if you had a
[1:42:56] chance if you had a power of turning
[1:42:58] those stones into breads yeah that'll be
[1:43:01] a big business
[1:43:03] right
[1:43:05] so he's catching his mind not only in
[1:43:07] his you know hungry condition but also
[1:43:10] in how he can you know promote himself
[1:43:13] and have a nice business for himself you
[1:43:16] know there's a lot of stones in Israel
[1:43:17] you know so you can turn those all all
[1:43:19] of them in into into breadth
[1:43:22] oh my goodness and you're hungry you'll
[1:43:24] eat yourself
[1:43:26] but why did Jesus refuse
[1:43:29] because he was led of the dove and the
[1:43:32] dove didn't tell him to do it even
[1:43:34] though it made sense he would you know
[1:43:37] he you know the Bible says he can make
[1:43:40] sons of Abraham out of stones not only
[1:43:42] bread
[1:43:44] he's able to do that but he didn't do it
[1:43:46] why because the dove didn't lead him to
[1:43:49] do it he was trusting the dove so much
[1:43:53] and he didn't he he just ignored the
[1:43:55] devil what what what's that I mean you
[1:43:58] know the the the the purpose of fasting
[1:44:00] brother Brian says is to make you close
[1:44:02] to God make you weaker in the flesh but
[1:44:04] closer spiritually to God right because
[1:44:07] you're seeking for an answer or you know
[1:44:09] you you were praying for something
[1:44:12] so in this 40 days past the purpose of
[1:44:15] that wasn't to torment Jesus or make him
[1:44:17] suffer but to make him closer to God so
[1:44:21] he was so close to God he was actually
[1:44:23] able to uh to discern that this thought
[1:44:28] wasn't coming from the dove it wasn't
[1:44:31] coming from the father it wasn't the
[1:44:33] Father in Heaven who was revealing it it
[1:44:36] was a different spirit that was
[1:44:37] revealing so he he just she basically
[1:44:39] ignored it says what are you saying this
[1:44:42] is crazy
[1:44:43] I don't I don't need any bread here
[1:44:46] that's right I mean after 40 days you
[1:44:48] definitely came and ate something
[1:44:50] you know
[1:44:52] but at that particular moment
[1:44:55] you know when the devil wanted him to
[1:44:57] create those you know uh breads out
[1:45:00] those so he didn't do it he discerned it
[1:45:02] because he was fully reliant on the dove
[1:45:05] on the holy spirit that was anointing
[1:45:08] him and leading him
[1:45:13] let's change the scenario and what if he
[1:45:16] he was weak what if he what if he would
[1:45:19] respond
[1:45:20] to to to a suggestion like this
[1:45:25] well basically nothing wrong would
[1:45:28] happen you know he would just we would
[1:45:30] have a happy young man eating some bread
[1:45:35] but without the dove on
[1:45:39] it right
[1:45:40] the dove would leave you know he says I
[1:45:43] am not doing anything the father
[1:45:44] wouldn't show me since I first want to
[1:45:46] see the father do it and then I do it
[1:45:50] if the father showed him you there's a
[1:45:52] stone create
[1:45:54] create a bread out of it
[1:45:56] he would do it
[1:46:00] so if if Jesus you can imagine if Jesus
[1:46:03] lost all those three battles a young man
[1:46:06] who would probably be prone to do it you
[1:46:09] know
[1:46:12] in a context like this you know when the
[1:46:14] Devil Himself comes to talk to you
[1:46:17] and then he he we would finally in in
[1:46:20] chapter four at the end of the day bless
[1:46:23] you brother at the end of the day we
[1:46:26] would have a young man
[1:46:28] who who was eating bread
[1:46:31] enjoying his bread
[1:46:33] happy that he he created it from Stone
[1:46:36] right
[1:46:39] and then he he would get some adrenaline
[1:46:41] jumping from the uh from the temple
[1:46:48] right
[1:46:49] and then
[1:46:50] out he comes from the Wilderness with
[1:46:53] the whole world under his feet
[1:46:55] right because the devil in one of those
[1:46:58] attacks he says I'll give you the whole
[1:47:01] world all the real estate and everything
[1:47:05] you you have on the in the world I'll
[1:47:07] give it to you
[1:47:09] so out of the Wilderness Jesus would
[1:47:12] have come with some food
[1:47:14] with some adrenaline
[1:47:17] and with all the kingdoms of God I mean
[1:47:20] of the Earth
[1:47:21] given to you a happy fleshly men
[1:47:26] flesh and blood
[1:47:28] total Flesh and Blood total loud is here
[1:47:33] eating having fun and possessing
[1:47:36] something
[1:47:37] right oh but how did he come out he came
[1:47:42] out Victorious
[1:47:45] Hallelujah he came out Victorious
[1:47:49] he after he he suffered the attack he
[1:47:52] went and ate
[1:47:53] no problem
[1:47:55] God provides the daily bread
[1:47:59] Hallelujah
[1:48:01] he he program says he didn't have to
[1:48:04] take those kingdoms right then because
[1:48:06] he says he knew it belonged to him
[1:48:10] he he he he actually would take them in
[1:48:13] an unclean condition before the
[1:48:15] millennium
[1:48:16] right he would actually have to clean it
[1:48:19] foreign
[1:48:23] Kingdom if God offers you okay you just
[1:48:27] bury a little while and I'll give you a
[1:48:29] clean Earth

[1:48:34] clean and then you can step on it with
[1:48:36] your bride
[1:48:37] oh praise be to Jesus he was victorious
[1:48:41] in all those attacks
[1:48:43] oh because why because he was not a son
[1:48:46] of Mary he was not a son of Joseph
[1:48:49] Hallelujah he was out of following the
[1:48:52] Flesh and Blood he was showing us how to

[1:51:34] thank you Father I was you know I was on
[1:51:36] the plane I was reading about Cain and
[1:51:37] Abel and I was so blessed to read it I
[1:51:39] said you know
[1:51:41] uh
[1:51:43] Abel he he was a part of those Church of
[1:51:47] the firstborn you know we're talking
[1:51:49] about the Jesus church you know we were
[1:51:51] talking about how he and he says you
[1:51:53] know you know Cain he was supposed to be
[1:51:56] the first born right but when he brought
[1:51:59] the gifts he didn't the Bible didn't say
[1:52:01] he brought the firstborn you know
[1:52:03] potatoes or something yeah you know he
[1:52:05] just brought the gifts you know
[1:52:07] of the land but Abel and it's mentioned
[1:52:11] in in Genesis 4 he brought the the
[1:52:14] firstborn
[1:52:15] of the sheep he had the Revelation why
[1:52:19] because he was the firstborn himself he
[1:52:22] he it wasn't Cain that he was first born
[1:52:24] Abel was firstborn he was he was in the
[1:52:27] mind of God before Cain was amen
[1:52:31] it is the Church of the firstborn he he
[1:52:34] knew him the importance of of the
[1:52:36] born-again experience back then
[1:52:40] in the times of when when they just came
[1:52:42] out of the uh Garden of Eden
[1:52:44] back then he knew that the firstborn the
[1:52:47] right of the firstborn the born-again
[1:52:49] experience
[1:52:51] the the the the Baptist is over the Holy
[1:52:53] Ghost
[1:52:54] is something that God will rejoice to
[1:52:56] receive
[1:52:57] right
[1:52:59] hallelujah oh thank you Father
[1:53:03] so so this is the Church of the
[1:53:04] firstborn right these are those that uh
[1:53:07] that are the descendants of Abel
[1:53:11] Hallelujah oh father thank you Father so
[1:53:15] so then when we follow on and then we
[1:53:17] read in in uh in the book of Hebrews
[1:53:19] that by faith yeah that's it able
[1:53:24] was
[1:53:25] able to bring this uh better sacrifice
[1:53:30] then came
[1:53:33] Hallelujah
[1:53:35] it wasn't uh it wasn't a matter of
[1:53:38] proving you know Cain is worse
[1:53:42] it's not that
[1:53:45] all right it's it's a matter of proving
[1:53:48] Abel is elected
[1:53:52] Abel is my son
[1:53:55] and by his Sacrifice by the revelation
[1:53:58] of it he proved he was righteous amen
[1:54:03] amen hallelujah
[1:54:05] oh Father Hallelujah isn't it wonderful
[1:54:09] God Gave You My revelation of what to do
[1:54:12] he knew from the very started it it was
[1:54:15] supposed to be sheep right he was a
[1:54:18] Shepherd himself oh Hallelujah and then
[1:54:21] God proved oh you're righteous because
[1:54:24] you can receive Revelations like this
[1:54:27] just like Peter you know was he more
[1:54:29] righteous than all those people who said
[1:54:31] you're Jeremiah you're this no
[1:54:34] he he had a better wording he had a
[1:54:37] better Revelation only because he was
[1:54:38] the son of God
[1:54:40] and that was a proof to him as well
[1:54:43] he became so confident he says he
[1:54:45] started you know controlling things in
[1:54:48] the next verses you know he's you know
[1:54:49] and then Jesus says come on Satan you
[1:54:51] know don't don't do it yet you know
[1:54:54] right yes so it gives us confidence as
[1:54:59] well you know Able by faith receive
[1:55:02] those things
[1:55:04] oh and God proved it in by by the gifts
[1:55:09] that he brought right oh thank you
[1:55:12] Father Hallelujah and then you remember
[1:55:14] worldbraham says speaks about Cain and
[1:55:16] he says uh he he should have just done
[1:55:19] the way his brother did
[1:55:22] that's it and God would receive it and
[1:55:26] he was still talking to him and he was
[1:55:27] still trying to persuade him he was
[1:55:29] still trying to bring him in
[1:55:31] hmm
[1:55:34] oh thank you Father and you know another
[1:55:37] thing I noticed this is just fresh and
[1:55:39] I'm sorry I'm I'm just you know sharing
[1:55:41] what was what's on my heart and I'm just
[1:55:43] reading it fresh you know for uh on on
[1:55:46] the plane uh losing all my jet lag
[1:55:49] immediately you know when you receive
[1:55:50] Revelation no gently
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:56] I I noticed Abel didn't say a word in
[1:55:59] the whole Bible
[1:56:03] he he didn't say anything Cain said tons
[1:56:05] of things Eve said a lot of things Adam
[1:56:07] said things
[1:56:09] Abel said nothing
[1:56:11] you wouldn't you wouldn't find a word
[1:56:13] Abel said in his life
[1:56:16] right
[1:56:17] but then when he died
[1:56:21] amen this is when he started screaming
[1:56:25] this is when he started talking this is
[1:56:28] what he says his blood is still talking
[1:56:30] he is talking why because he's dead
[1:56:34] oh this is a paradox
[1:56:37] this is a paradox I tell you this is
[1:56:40] weird how can you talk when you're dead
[1:56:44] oh but but the Lord shows us in the
[1:56:48] Bible this is when you start talking
[1:56:49] this is when you start speaking this is
[1:56:52] when the token is on display brother
[1:56:54] Brahm says the token was you know the
[1:56:57] blood that was spilled when he he took
[1:56:59] he was in the field with his brother and
[1:57:01] they were talking
[1:57:04] imagine their conversation I I thought
[1:57:07] you know what what they were talking
[1:57:08] about
[1:57:09] you know because because by then again
[1:57:12] was envious
[1:57:14] he wasn't happy his countenance changed
[1:57:17] there's like labans just like you know
[1:57:18] everybody in the Bible you know Saul and
[1:57:21] all of them and the the this this other
[1:57:23] Spirit came upon him he wasn't happy
[1:57:27] me and all the brother you younger
[1:57:29] brother
[1:57:30] what are you talking about
[1:57:33] why did God confirm your gifts and your
[1:57:35] sacrifice not mine right that's it
[1:57:41] huh and brother Ben says he should have
[1:57:43] humbled himself
[1:57:45] there was no problem the younger brother
[1:57:47] received a better Revelation than you
[1:57:49] that's right no problem about that I'm
[1:57:52] happy when my young people in in my
[1:57:55] church receive a better Revelation than
[1:57:56] that
[1:57:57] yeah
[1:57:59] praise the Lord
[1:58:01] thank you Father amen so so so what
[1:58:05] happens
[1:58:05] and then then he they started talking in
[1:58:09] the field
[1:58:11] Kane was the initiator
[1:58:14] if you if you read the Bible Cain spoke
[1:58:16] to to Abel to his younger brother
[1:58:20] and then he he slew him
[1:58:24] all right
[1:58:26] so I imagine they were talking about the
[1:58:28] sacrifice probably
[1:58:30] because they he ended up
[1:58:32] putting him on the altar
[1:58:36] so you're talking about some death you
[1:58:38] you so so God He he'll receive the death
[1:58:41] he'll receive the blood right
[1:58:43] he won't receive the fruits
[1:58:45] he'll receive the blood
[1:58:48] do you really mean that
[1:58:53] oh man this is killed him
[1:58:56] and then the blood went into the Earth
[1:58:59] that's right that was feeding him all
[1:59:02] the time
[1:59:03] and then God says I'll I'll block the
[1:59:07] power of the earth to give you strength
[1:59:10] right
[1:59:12] oh
[1:59:13] when when the first blood was slain when
[1:59:16] when when Abel was slaying his lamb and
[1:59:20] the blood was spilling
[1:59:22] God didn't say it was wrong that's right
[1:59:24] right yeah
[1:59:26] but when
[1:59:28] Cain spilled the blood of his
[1:59:31] brother that was wrong
[1:59:34] right oh
[1:59:37] there's some good things in there you
[1:59:39] know praise the Lord thank you Father
[1:59:43] so so we're so happy
[1:59:46] to to see that Cape that Abel he started
[1:59:50] talking when he was dead
[1:59:52] this is where the life speaks this is
[1:59:56] where the blood speaks when we you know
[1:59:58] when there's so many people there
[1:59:59] approach you and they says so how can we
[2:00:02] make sure how can we make sure the token
[2:00:04] is on display
[2:00:05] the only answers is be dead
[2:00:10] and then the token will be speaking
[2:00:13] it'll be display Abel died so many
[2:00:17] thousand years ago but his blood still
[2:00:19] speaking
[2:00:21] hallelujah oh Hallelujah so this oh
[2:00:27] thank you Father
[2:00:28] thank you Father I don't even know how
[2:00:30] much time I'm standing here
[2:00:32] so you know I I probably better close
[2:00:36] you know because
[2:00:38] uh because I I believe the we we're part
[2:00:42] of the Church of the firstborn who are
[2:00:44] receiving the right Revelations from God
[2:00:47] understanding the plan of God in a very
[2:00:51] simple context
[2:00:52] very simple context
[2:00:54] amen hallelujah
[2:00:56] thank you Jesus
[2:00:58] very simple
[2:00:59] you know we're just in the church we
[2:01:01] just had a series on the on the Book of
[2:01:03] Judges you know because uh you know
[2:01:06] we've uh uh been studying the judge of
[2:01:09] all the Earth that came down in the
[2:01:11] seven angels
[2:01:13] and brother Bram says the same anointing
[2:01:16] that is on that judge is falling upon
[2:01:18] the people amen this is why he sent the
[2:01:21] Seven Ages this is why he sent the Seven
[2:01:24] Seals this is why he sent this this
[2:01:26] Prophet right because he wanted the
[2:01:28] anointing of the judge to fall upon the
[2:01:32] Book of Judges here you know the Book of
[2:01:35] Judges was always so negative for me I
[2:01:37] thought oh man this is so many bad
[2:01:39] things going on in there
[2:01:41] but there's so many good things in there
[2:01:43] as well there's so many good anointed
[2:01:45] people there and if you if you look at
[2:01:47] them they're simple
[2:01:50] all those judges basically simple no you
[2:01:53] know Royal origin somewhere you know
[2:01:55] lineage or not many of them were famous
[2:01:58] for something
[2:02:00] right they were just just simple men
[2:02:03] just even women
[2:02:06] right
[2:02:08] which received the anointing so the
[2:02:10] judge that came oh you know in the Book
[2:02:13] of Judges the judges were actually the
[2:02:16] deliverers
[2:02:17] they were not so much uh uh the
[2:02:21] juridical part of it you know as a judge
[2:02:23] you know as an advocate as a as a lawyer
[2:02:26] or something right as we perceive a
[2:02:28] judge you know with the wig and things
[2:02:29] like this they were also delivers the
[2:02:32] main things they were delivering other
[2:02:33] people from the Philistines so why did
[2:02:37] this judge of all the Earth come to to
[2:02:39] send his anointing upon simple people
[2:02:42] like you like me to be the deliverers
[2:02:45] for Israel
[2:02:47] amen
[2:02:50] do you remember this this is the judge I
[2:02:52] even forget his name it was mentioned a
[2:02:55] few times in the Bible and and he
[2:02:57] brought by him says those Philistines
[2:02:59] were coming and they were eating off his
[2:03:01] crops
[2:03:02] right shamgar thank you sister praise
[2:03:05] the Lord there's some anointed judges
[2:03:07] here amen
[2:03:09] Hallelujah shamgar remember he he says
[2:03:13] he was he he had the crops in his
[2:03:15] agricultural country here you you depend
[2:03:17] on the crops we depend on the crops as
[2:03:19] well right so he was he was having that
[2:03:21] for his uh for his uh family he was
[2:03:24] having that for his wife he says for his
[2:03:26] children every time the crop would go
[2:03:28] out here comes the Philippines to eat it
[2:03:30] off
[2:03:31] and one day brother Brandon says he
[2:03:33] became angry yeah so this
[2:03:36] it's not a big problem to become angry
[2:03:39] angry at the Devil actually right
[2:03:43] I won't stand this they will come in and
[2:03:46] eating that off anymore
[2:03:48] this is my family brother Brian says uh
[2:03:51] he realized he was an Israelite he was
[2:03:54] circumcised
[2:03:56] right brother man says what that does
[2:03:59] does that mean he had the Holy Ghost he
[2:04:01] says he says I'm not even a preacher
[2:04:05] I'm not even a pastor I'm not even a a
[2:04:07] minister he says I just a simple brother
[2:04:10] who has got the Holy Ghost
[2:04:13] and so I'll use anything that I have as
[2:04:16] an instrument here
[2:04:18] as my agricultural instrument that I use
[2:04:21] every day
[2:04:23] my connection my my my simple ways just
[2:04:26] like David he was using his his
[2:04:28] instrument right not somebody else's but
[2:04:31] his own instrument
[2:04:33] I'll use my instrument whatever it is
[2:04:35] you know if I use this instrument
[2:04:37] I'll kill 600 of them with this
[2:04:42] if I'm angry at the Devil and I want to
[2:04:44] deliver my family
[2:04:46] yes praise the Lord amen if the lord
[2:04:50] gave me this instrument the Lord give me
[2:04:52] this instrument the lord gave me this
[2:04:53] instrument this instrument
[2:04:56] this instrument whatever
[2:04:58] Hallelujah
[2:05:01] thank you Father
[2:05:03] stand in my position in Christ
[2:05:07] and I'll have the power in this position
[2:05:09] Hallelujah and this is how he protected
[2:05:12] his family and if you notice from then
[2:05:15] on the news game oh this this home is
[2:05:18] Anointed
[2:05:19] this family is Anointed I was passing by
[2:05:22] I saw 600 Corpses
[2:05:25] of the devils
[2:05:26] oh man he can deliver I thought this was
[2:05:30] just a simple farmer I thought this was
[2:05:32] just a simple shamgar
[2:05:34] I was passing by these these kids never
[2:05:37] had anything to eat
[2:05:39] all of a sudden this anointing comes on
[2:05:41] him
[2:05:42] oh thank you Father
[2:05:46] he's got an open channel
[2:05:49] of revelation of what to do with what
[2:05:52] right
[2:05:53] Hallelujah
[2:05:56] he was a simple man
