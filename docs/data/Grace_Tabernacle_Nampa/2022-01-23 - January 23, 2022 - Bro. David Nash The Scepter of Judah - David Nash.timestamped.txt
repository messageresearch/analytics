[30:08] give me just a second
[30:10] everybody's going around they got the
[30:12] scratchy throats and all that and
[30:14] we just came up from texas a few days
[30:16] ago and
[30:17] down there it's
[30:19] you know i hate to tell you this but it
[30:20] was 82 degrees one day and
[30:22] [Laughter]
[30:24] and and humid right because it's texas
[30:26] and when just before that we'd been
[30:29] well
[30:30] spent about three weeks in central
[30:32] america which is also warm and humid and
[30:35] then went from that to ohio where it was
[30:37] freezing cold
[30:38] why do people live there
[30:43] and from there to michigan which was
[30:45] worse
[30:46] i just
[30:48] well praise the lord are you happy to be
[30:50] a christian this morning
[30:52] i'm happy to be a christian and happy to
[30:54] be back
[30:55] before i actually get started uh
[30:58] don't go away just just we'll because
[31:01] we're i want to just speak for a few
[31:03] minutes before we actually get into the
[31:04] message
[31:06] a lot of things going on
[31:08] you know not just
[31:10] here but there and worldwide and
[31:14] sometimes we get confused and wonder you
[31:17] know what is happening what is going on
[31:20] and i wanted to read
[31:23] a scripture
[31:25] and it's in
[31:27] second corinthians
[31:30] i ask brother jason i showed him
[31:34] the notes and i don't know if some of
[31:35] you know me and i said
[31:37] y'all want this one which is the you
[31:40] know the shorter version
[31:42] or do you i've added two more scriptures
[31:44] to this page which is the he said the
[31:47] five hour version i said well maybe two
[31:50] and a half
[31:51] so
[31:52] i'm sure brother paul
[31:54] understands
[31:56] and thank you for the invitation to be
[31:58] here this morning brother god bless you
[32:00] but in ii corinthians
[32:04] it's not such that
[32:06] hasn't happened before to
[32:08] certain people
[32:10] in different ways it's
[32:12] the fourth chapter
[32:16] i hope i think we got the right one
[32:18] written down
[32:23] i believe it's the eighth verse
[32:31] you know actually that started the
[32:32] seventh he says but we have this
[32:34] treasure in earth and vessel
[32:36] so that the excellency of the power may
[32:39] be of god and not of us it was a good
[32:42] song we just were singing there that uh
[32:46] we're not the responsibility he is
[32:50] we're just the ones
[32:52] i remember it was brother williams years
[32:55] ago said when he was talking about
[32:57] marriage and i've used it many times
[32:59] since then he said some people say well
[33:01] it's 50 50. some people say well it's 70
[33:04] 80 or you know did they got all these
[33:06] different numbers
[33:07] and i liked what he said marriage is 100
[33:11] and it's remember that christ is number
[33:14] one and we're the two little zeros
[33:18] and it's the same way in a marriage with
[33:20] christ
[33:21] we're just the little zeroes he's number
[33:24] one he is our everything he is our all
[33:28] and we're the little zeros
[33:30] but i went to a bank here a while back
[33:32] and
[33:33] there you know the the teller said
[33:35] something about well the zero's nothing
[33:37] i said then why don't you add a few more
[33:39] onto the deposit
[33:43] she wouldn't do it
[33:45] i don't understand but if it's nothing
[33:48] then why are they so important
[33:50] and that's how it is to god
[33:52] he's the number one and we're just the
[33:54] little zeros but to him
[33:56] you're important
[33:59] so important that he gave his own life
[34:02] and he continues to give it day by day
[34:04] hour by hour moment by moment
[34:07] that we might be like him
[34:09] so he says we have this treasure in
[34:11] earth and vessels that the excellency in
[34:12] the power of god
[34:14] and not or may be of god and not of us
[34:17] we are troubled on every side yet not
[34:19] distressed we are perplexed
[34:22] but not in despair persecuted but not
[34:24] forsaken cast down
[34:26] but not destroyed
[34:29] always a bearing always bearing about in
[34:32] the body
[34:33] the dying of our lord jesus
[34:35] that the life also of jesus might be
[34:38] made manifest where
[34:40] in our bodies
[34:44] are you perplexed
[34:46] are you wondering what's going on is
[34:48] there
[34:49] is there trouble anywhere is that how
[34:51] the song goes
[34:54] absolutely
[34:55] and so i just wanted to just like i said
[34:58] i don't know we may get to the long one
[35:00] yet brother uh
[35:04] what's been happening and we know it's
[35:06] been happening all along but
[35:08] uh you know a year and a half two years
[35:10] ago roughly
[35:12] now
[35:13] the devil decided you know his time's
[35:15] about up
[35:18] and just like any good runner good good
[35:20] athlete good skier what diver what
[35:22] swimmer whatever it is
[35:24] you always try to save just that extra
[35:27] little
[35:28] to get you across the finish line and to
[35:31] win your battle
[35:34] and with the the thing that people call
[35:36] covet in this country and central
[35:38] america everybody just calls it the
[35:39] virus
[35:40] uh
[35:42] and all these other things
[35:46] the entire earth is being anointed with
[35:48] an antichrist spirit
[35:51] he is pouring it out with everything
[35:53] that he's got
[35:55] and you can say well how do you say that
[35:56] well we know that in the garden of eden
[35:59] when
[36:01] satan came to eve through the serpent
[36:04] he's all he said was thou shalt not
[36:06] surely die
[36:08] but the word said ye will surely die
[36:11] we know that eve received in her mind
[36:14] and then into her heart and then into
[36:16] her body
[36:18] that little not surely die
[36:22] and because of that we're in the
[36:24] condition that we are today
[36:26] and so satan is trying everything he can
[36:29] with this anointing
[36:31] whether it be by disease whether it be
[36:33] whatever
[36:34] it's antichrist the entire thing is an
[36:37] antichrist anointing and it's simple to
[36:40] see it when you see
[36:41] they say don't go to church
[36:45] wow i just read in the word
[36:48] that says you should be going more
[36:51] as you see the day approaching
[36:53] they say stay six feet away from each
[36:55] other
[36:56] and uh
[36:57] you know cover your face
[37:00] i don't like to say this but i've only
[37:01] found three or four places in the
[37:03] scripture where it talks about
[37:05] covering the face once is for the lepers
[37:07] and they have to stay six feet away from
[37:09] people and go around saying unclean
[37:11] unclean
[37:13] the other one was
[37:16] and if we get to it later
[37:20] if you see you all still want me to stay
[37:22] here
[37:23] you know said judah believe that tamar
[37:26] was a harlot because she had her face
[37:28] covered
[37:30] whoo and another one was when haman when
[37:33] they're getting ready to hang him and
[37:34] said they covered his face
[37:37] huh
[37:39] interesting stuff isn't it
[37:42] and how that
[37:43] you know they're telling us all to do
[37:45] these things and they're all just simple
[37:48] antichrist just just believe their word
[37:51] just believe they're not
[37:54] but i love what jesus christ does for us
[37:58] because if you go to where david in the
[38:01] bible he he done wrong he took
[38:04] a woman that wasn't his and had the man
[38:07] killed i mean that's pretty rough stuff
[38:10] and
[38:11] yet when the prophet came to him
[38:16] god in a fleshly body with the word of
[38:19] the lord
[38:20] to him
[38:22] and gave the little the story about the
[38:24] lamb
[38:26] brother branham when he was talking
[38:28] about this particular scene he said
[38:30] david proved that he still had
[38:32] righteousness in his heart
[38:34] because he gave the right
[38:37] judgment
[38:38] he said that man should die
[38:43] right judgment
[38:45] and the other thing about it was it's
[38:47] not only david that's involved in this
[38:49] it's the woman also
[38:51] that he's taken because the woman and
[38:53] the man had become one
[38:55] according to the law
[38:57] so it wasn't just david that was
[39:00] falling into this thing but the prophet
[39:02] came back and used the very words
[39:06] that the serpent used against eve and
[39:09] said david you'll not
[39:11] surely die
[39:16] exact same words
[39:19] at this time they were spoken by the
[39:21] grace of god
[39:23] by the word of god
[39:25] and the grace of god came on the scene
[39:27] he paid for it
[39:29] lost his kingdom all the things he went
[39:31] through
[39:32] but the grace of god is there
[39:35] for the believers
[39:37] brother sister we're
[39:38] perplexed there's sickness there's all
[39:40] kinds of things going on i mean the
[39:42] world is lit up brother branham again he
[39:45] said the whole world would go crazy
[39:47] before we get out of here
[39:49] it's got to be getting close that's all
[39:51] i can say
[39:53] because it's pretty crazy
[39:55] and so uh
[39:57] but how did this anointing and it wreaks
[40:00] havoc on individuals wreaks havoc on
[40:02] families it wreaks havoc
[40:04] on the streets i can't imagine
[40:07] i don't want to imagine what it would be
[40:10] like to be an unbeliever right now
[40:13] they are so tossed and ten and tempted
[40:16] and turned and
[40:18] most of them i'm amazed every once in a
[40:20] while i'll run into somebody that
[40:22] actually is still using their own brains
[40:27] uh you know and not you talk to them and
[40:29] they don't the first thing they do
[40:33] to see what google said about it or
[40:34] whoever you know
[40:37] but it's true
[40:38] but you see the righteousness of god is
[40:41] still dwelling in man by the holy ghost
[40:44] and so if you're perplexed and you're
[40:46] having trouble just know that the
[40:48] corinthians did too
[40:50] and they're waiting on you and i are
[40:52] just watching you and i
[40:54] as this picture plays out to the very
[40:56] end
[40:57] to where that we can speak
[40:59] and there's an old song i don't know if
[41:00] you would remember it but it's when you
[41:02] begin to see your loved ones
[41:04] walk around the ones that you've laid
[41:07] there in the ground you remember yeah an
[41:09] old time song
[41:13] it's a reality
[41:16] you'll be seeing them one of these days
[41:18] they're
[41:19] the bible in uh
[41:21] hebrews chapter 12 said they're here we
[41:24] are encompassed now
[41:26] by a great cloud of witnesses you might
[41:29] think you're just this little church but
[41:31] right here maybe just above the ceiling
[41:34] there's millions times millions
[41:37] going hang on
[41:40] believe the word of god
[41:43] press forward speak the word
[41:47] and every demon has to tremble resist
[41:50] the devil
[41:51] and he'll flee
[41:52] [Music]
[41:54] and when you have like abraham lincoln
[41:56] said you got nowhere else to go he said
[41:58] i go to my knees
[42:02] and on those knees
[42:04] or in your heart or wherever your altar
[42:06] is this morning
[42:07] say god
[42:09] remember me
[42:10] and just those words
[42:13] save to see a thief on the cross lord
[42:17] remember me
[42:19] so god bless you this morning as we
[42:21] should i close or can we shall we go
[42:23] ahead and

[47:12] america i started to sing in spanish
[47:16] it's a love song this whole relationship
[47:19] brother branham said nothing gets there
[47:20] but perfect love
[47:22] and it's a love affair with jesus christ
[47:25] not to keep you standing long let's turn
[47:28] thank you sister
[47:31] brother thank you
[47:34] uh
[47:36] to the other end of the
[47:38] book uh genesis
[47:40] we'll start with uh
[47:45] well
[47:47] i believe it's chapter 38.
[47:50] we'll start with chapter 38 of genesis
[47:54] uh
[47:55] but
[47:57] and it's probably most of people that
[48:00] read the bible will start with
[48:02] genesis and they do okay with that
[48:05] most of that and then when they get into
[48:07] other
[48:08] uh books they forget things thank you
[48:10] god bless you
[48:13] but uh so you're probably familiar with
[48:15] this it's the story of where
[48:18] uh judah had given
[48:22] tamar or
[48:24] his son with with tamar and the first
[48:27] son died second son died and the third
[48:30] son he was afraid to give it to him
[48:32] because he was one thing he was too
[48:33] young
[48:34] and he was worried that the third son
[48:36] might die
[48:38] so judah being the
[48:40] man that he was
[48:44] he tells his daughter to go remain a
[48:47] widow until the third son is ready
[48:50] and he can be the husband but
[48:53] things don't always work out the way we
[48:55] think they do
[48:56] and so we'll start with the 12th verse i
[48:59] believe it is and in process of time
[49:01] that this so it's uh 38 verse 12 and in
[49:04] process of time
[49:06] the daughter
[49:08] of shua judah's wife died
[49:11] was that my reading
[49:13] yeah
[49:14] and judah was comforted went up to the
[49:16] sheep shearers to timnath he and his
[49:18] friend hira
[49:20] the adult edualamite and it was told
[49:22] tamar saying behold thy father-in-law go
[49:25] with up to timnath to shear the sheep
[49:28] and she put her widow's garments fro off
[49:30] from her and covered her with a veil
[49:33] wrapped herself and sat down in an open
[49:35] place which is by the way to timnath
[49:38] for she saw that sheila was grown and
[49:41] she was not given unto him to wife
[49:43] when judah saw her he thought her to be
[49:45] a harlot because she had covered her
[49:47] face
[49:49] and he turned unto her by the way and
[49:51] said go
[49:52] pray thee
[49:53] let me come in unto thee for he knew not
[49:57] that she was his daughter-in-law
[49:59] and she said what will thou give be that
[50:01] thou mayest come in unto me
[50:04] he said i will send thee a kid from the
[50:06] flock
[50:08] and she said will thou give me a pledge
[50:10] till thou send it
[50:12] and he said what pledge shall i give
[50:14] thee
[50:15] watch
[50:16] what she asks for
[50:20] because this is the pledge this says he
[50:22] is giving these things by his word
[50:26] okay
[50:29] what pledge will that
[50:30] and uh
[50:33] she said the signet
[50:35] the bracelets
[50:37] and the staff that's in my hand and he
[50:40] gave it to her
[50:42] and he came in unto her and she
[50:44] conceived when she had received these
[50:47] things okay she conceived by him
[50:51] and she arose and went away and laid off
[50:53] or laid by her veil from her and put on
[50:56] the garments of her witterhood
[50:58] and judah sent the kid by the hand of
[50:59] his friend the edualamite
[51:01] to perceive his pledge from the woman's
[51:04] hand but he found her
[51:06] not and if you drop down it says that
[51:10] when she's found to be with a
[51:13] child you can't hide those kind of
[51:14] things
[51:16] uh he said you know here's righteous
[51:18] jupiter right he said we're gonna
[51:20] same just like david we're going to kill
[51:22] this girl because the you know the work
[51:24] the
[51:26] law which scripturally speaking wasn't
[51:28] even written yet but
[51:30] they should have been
[51:31] killed and burnt with fire
[51:34] because he even says there in verse 24
[51:36] let her be burnt
[51:38] when they bring her in
[51:39] in verse 25 and she was brought forth
[51:41] she sent to her father-in-law saying by
[51:45] the man whose these are i am with child
[51:48] and she said discern i pray thee whose
[51:50] these are
[51:51] the signet the bracelet and the staff
[51:55] and judah acknowledged them and said she
[51:56] hath been more righteous than i
[51:59] because that i gave her not to sheila my
[52:01] son
[52:02] and he knew her again no more so let's
[52:05] turn over to 49
[52:08] which is actually happens
[52:11] after this
[52:13] verse 30 or chapter 38
[52:16] and i know we've spoken from this
[52:17] particular scripture before
[52:20] from an entirely different angle
[52:22] and i just pray the lord will bless it
[52:25] to us today
[52:27] it's in verse or chapter 49
[52:30] and it's the prophecy
[52:32] that uh
[52:34] jacob is prophesying over all his
[52:37] sons
[52:38] and such and when he comes to judah
[52:41] starting there at 49 verse 8
[52:44] the prophecy goes judah thou art he whom
[52:46] thy brethren shall praise
[52:48] thy hand shall be in the neck of thine
[52:50] enemies thy father's children shall bow
[52:52] down before thee judah his alliance well
[52:55] from the prey my son thou art gone up he
[52:57] stooped down he cast as a lion as an old
[52:59] lion who shall rise him up we realize
[53:02] that's
[53:03] speaking of the three or three comings
[53:06] of the lord but then it continues
[53:09] in verse 10
[53:11] the scepter shall not depart from judah
[53:14] or a lawgiver from between his feet
[53:16] until shiloh come
[53:18] and unto him shall the gathering of the
[53:21] people
[53:22] be
[53:23] i'm going to read one more
[53:25] verse there binding his full unto the
[53:28] vine and his asses colt unto the choice
[53:31] vine
[53:33] he washed his garments in wine in his
[53:35] clothes in the blood of graves
[53:39] lord jesus
[53:41] thy word is precious
[53:44] it's precious in my sight
[53:47] i think how that we sometimes the
[53:49] unworthy lord
[53:51] and even the things that we do and we
[53:53] talk about how that it was
[53:55] our sin
[53:56] that sent jesus christ the calvary
[53:59] how the things that we do and say
[54:01] sometimes
[54:04] helped cause the pain and yet it was
[54:06] because of that pain that you poured out
[54:08] the blood
[54:10] the paradox of life how that the very
[54:13] pains that caused it
[54:15] caused the way of escape for us
[54:19] so i come before you this morning humbly
[54:22] asking every sin every unbelief every
[54:25] perplexed of times whatever it might be
[54:28] will be relieved from your people this
[54:29] morning
[54:31] and the gathering lord
[54:33] gather them
[54:35] unto the great judah the lion of the
[54:38] tribe of judah
[54:39] even our lord jesus christ by your word
[54:44] i ask it in the name of jesus christ
[54:46] with all my heart
[54:47] amen
[54:48] please be seated
[54:54] might seem like it's kind of a strange
[54:56] combination of scripture
[54:59] but as we think about it
[55:01] and we look into the scripture
[55:05] if we were to
[55:07] the subject i suppose this morning would
[55:09] be
[55:10] uh
[55:11] the scepter or the of the
[55:14] the scepter of judah
[55:16] because it's talking there and it says
[55:18] the scepter shall not depart
[55:21] as a sub or as a name if we could put a
[55:24] name to it i'd put writing on it
[55:28] and because
[55:29] the scripture is you know
[55:31] we tend to think of it as in chronology
[55:34] everything in chronological order
[55:36] brother branham of course told us it's
[55:37] not
[55:38] in fact you can jump from one type and
[55:41] shadow
[55:42] here and the very next line is a type
[55:45] and shadow from something that happened
[55:46] way back there and the next line is
[55:49] something else
[55:51] because it's god's word
[55:53] and it's eternal
[55:55] and when we
[55:57] to really perceive it and understand it
[55:59] it takes a new birth you must be born
[56:02] again you have to receive jesus christ
[56:05] if you've not received jesus christ now
[56:07] is a really good time
[56:09] ask him right now don't wait till the
[56:11] end it might be too late
[56:14] and i'm not saying that to scare i'm
[56:16] saying it because it's just the truth
[56:18] you must be born again you must meet
[56:21] jesus christ i tell people all over the
[56:24] the world where we go it's not where you
[56:26] go it's who you know
[56:28] literally you must know
[56:31] jesus christ an intimate as we saying a
[56:35] love affair
[56:36] relationship
[56:38] many people met jesus but
[56:41] some of those that met him put him on a
[56:42] cross
[56:43] and nailed the put the name somebody put
[56:46] the nails in his hands
[56:48] but you have to meet him in love
[56:50] honor
[56:51] and respect
[56:53] and when you do that then he
[56:56] returns that we've heard brother branham
[56:58] preach about when love projects and how
[57:00] that when love goes out it's like it
[57:03] goes right back to the old law
[57:04] whatsoever man soweth actually also reap
[57:07] and if you pour your love out to him
[57:11] what kind of harvest do you think you're
[57:12] gonna get brother paul's a a great
[57:14] farmer and he puts a seed in the ground
[57:16] he's not expecting
[57:17] to get just one little piece of corn
[57:19] back
[57:21] he's hoping for a really good year where
[57:22] that that stock comes up but it's full
[57:24] of corn well it's just a natural law
[57:28] and as we pour out to jesus christ
[57:31] he pours back in abundance
[57:35] and it never ceases to amaze me
[57:37] sometimes
[57:38] when i look at the word of god i'm
[57:40] expecting you know just maybe a what
[57:43] brother jason saying the 20-minute
[57:45] version but
[57:47] all of a sudden when the holy spirit
[57:48] comes
[57:51] he just pours it out
[57:52] and i remember brother branham talking
[57:54] about sometimes that how when the holy
[57:56] spirit would come he said he couldn't
[57:57] write it down fast enough
[57:59] he said it's just
[58:00] because he's
[58:02] i like to remember a lady in new york we
[58:05] went to
[58:06] came back from africa one time and i
[58:08] only had just a little bit of money in
[58:10] my pocket and bought a couple of
[58:11] pancakes and she gave me just a little
[58:13] tiny deal of syrup
[58:15] and i'm looking at these two big
[58:17] pancakes and
[58:19] i walked back and i said ma'am
[58:22] i i do missionary work and
[58:24] she said something wrong and i said well
[58:27] i'm a protestant i believe in baptism
[58:29] not sprinkling
[58:31] and you know she she laughed and
[58:35] uh but that's how it is with the word of
[58:37] god
[58:39] it's a baptism
[58:41] and it's the whole body
[58:43] experience we get wet in the word of god
[58:46] and when he comes on the scene he pours
[58:49] out
[58:51] i love that scripture in psalms where he
[58:52] said i am poured out like water
[58:56] the i am god jehovah in jesus christ
[59:01] came and poured himself out
[59:05] poured himself out just
[59:07] totally bathed
[59:11] that we might
[59:13] receive the love
[59:15] and respect of jesus christ back to us
[59:17] by the love of god
[59:20] and so here we see
[59:22] tamar
[59:24] and how that
[59:26] you know it looked like an unrighteous
[59:28] act that she'd done
[59:30] she was as it were promised and again as
[59:33] we far as we know the law wasn't written
[59:35] as we know it you know because moses did
[59:38] that later on 400 years later roughly
[59:41] and
[59:43] but the
[59:44] existence of it or the concept of it
[59:46] however it was done
[59:48] was already there
[59:50] and it was such that she
[59:52] since she couldn't conceive from the
[59:54] first nor the second and the third was
[59:56] not really old enough yet and when he
[59:58] got old enough judah was just a little
[1:00:01] gun shy because he'd already lost two
[1:00:03] sons
[1:00:05] but he was the father of the household
[1:00:09] he was the one that would receive this
[1:00:12] promise
[1:00:14] a promise of god through a prophet named
[1:00:16] jacob
[1:00:17] who was his daddy as we would think
[1:00:20] and how that that promise would come
[1:00:23] upon judah
[1:00:25] and how that judah
[1:00:28] was to be the one that would start that
[1:00:30] lineage as we would call it or that
[1:00:33] bloodline going down through history to
[1:00:35] this one meets this one meets this one
[1:00:38] and how that that bloodline was to
[1:00:41] bring forth
[1:00:42] a particular time and a particular place
[1:00:46] to where god would step down
[1:00:48] and by the holy ghost
[1:00:50] speak
[1:00:51] through an angel messenger
[1:00:55] to marry and tell mary you know you're
[1:00:58] going to have a son
[1:01:00] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:01:02] counselor mighty god the everlasting
[1:01:05] father
[1:01:06] the prince of peace
[1:01:08] she had the question
[1:01:11] how can this thing be
[1:01:13] it's never heard of ever before in
[1:01:15] history
[1:01:16] and he said the holy ghost will
[1:01:18] overshadow you and you'll bring forth
[1:01:20] his son
[1:01:21] so judah is the one that has the seed
[1:01:24] line
[1:01:26] to bring this natural event into the
[1:01:30] place where it needs to be so that god
[1:01:32] can step into it and prove himself
[1:01:36] the king the everlasting father the very
[1:01:39] things that the angel had spoken to her
[1:01:42] it's not a myth it's not just a
[1:01:44] christmas story
[1:01:46] it was god
[1:01:48] moving on the scene and showing himself
[1:01:52] so ever so secretly and yet at the same
[1:01:55] time ever so
[1:01:57] easily seen
[1:01:59] as we can look back on it and we can
[1:02:01] read the lineages
[1:02:02] and the things you know when i first
[1:02:04] came to the lord if i really had to go
[1:02:06] to sleep i'd start reading the lineages
[1:02:09] it works
[1:02:11] you relax and so and so begat and so and
[1:02:14] so and i never paid a whole lot of
[1:02:16] attention to it until later on in life
[1:02:19] but
[1:02:21] it was god's way
[1:02:23] of hiding himself in simplicity
[1:02:26] the simplicity of
[1:02:29] you know this boy meets this girl
[1:02:31] ooh they get the funny look in the eyes
[1:02:33] and
[1:02:34] they're done for man
[1:02:36] i remember when my wife and i
[1:02:39] god bless her she wanted to be here this
[1:02:41] morning but
[1:02:42] she wanted to make sure she's over
[1:02:43] everything too
[1:02:45] and
[1:02:47] you know how they said that
[1:02:49] they'd look at us and god those two are
[1:02:51] worthless
[1:02:53] because you know you get that
[1:02:56] thing and
[1:02:59] here we are
[1:03:02] but so that in that simplicity
[1:03:06] god was creating
[1:03:08] and creating
[1:03:10] through this in this particular case by
[1:03:12] natural selection
[1:03:14] so what is the the point where where are
[1:03:15] you going brother david why you you
[1:03:17] mentioned tamar and you mentioned this
[1:03:19] and how that it was a righteous thing
[1:03:22] actually in judah proven that he had
[1:03:24] righteousness in him because had she had
[1:03:26] played the harlot
[1:03:28] that would have been the proper judgment
[1:03:30] bring her here we're going to stun her
[1:03:32] and burn her with fire
[1:03:34] because that's what happens to a harlot
[1:03:38] including this harlot day in which we
[1:03:40] live
[1:03:43] think about the masks what's god telling
[1:03:46] you about this generation
[1:03:48] just something to think about
[1:03:56] but we know that judah
[1:04:01] so he had righteousness in him
[1:04:04] he had the proper judgment
[1:04:07] but when
[1:04:10] she was to be presented to be burnt with
[1:04:14] fire
[1:04:16] she had something to present back
[1:04:20] and when this generation
[1:04:24] is to be stoned a prophet said with
[1:04:27] stones out of heaven i can't remember
[1:04:29] what you say 800 pounds or something
[1:04:30] like that
[1:04:31] and then burnt with fire
[1:04:35] we have something
[1:04:37] to turn back to
[1:04:39] we have something to show
[1:04:43] it was the proper
[1:04:45] judgment
[1:04:47] there is a proper
[1:04:49] judgment
[1:04:51] that will fall upon this generation upon
[1:04:54] this nation upon this world in which we
[1:04:58] live
[1:04:59] perplexed of times and all these things
[1:05:02] and this anointing the confusion what is
[1:05:04] it what does babylon mean it's the
[1:05:08] pouring out of every evil spirit
[1:05:13] why
[1:05:15] because it's all coming back into
[1:05:16] existence so it can be judged and sent
[1:05:19] to the lake of fire
[1:05:21] but at the same time little bride
[1:05:24] we're moving upward
[1:05:27] we're moving upward where does it start
[1:05:30] right here
[1:05:32] it starts the moment that you receive
[1:05:34] jesus christ
[1:05:36] and it begins to grow
[1:05:39] and so
[1:05:41] she presents back to him
[1:05:44] she said here
[1:05:46] the man
[1:05:48] and she doesn't say he's wrong
[1:05:50] she said but the man whose these are
[1:05:54] is responsible for this
[1:05:57] and all of a sudden what does he look at
[1:06:00] what does she have
[1:06:01] in her hands what do we have in our
[1:06:04] hands
[1:06:05] this morning
[1:06:07] to present
[1:06:10] before the king of kings
[1:06:14] when the judgment is about to fall well
[1:06:18] first off
[1:06:19] the name tamar means
[1:06:21] punk just simply means palm tree so she
[1:06:23] was named after a palm tree
[1:06:26] and we think
[1:06:28] there's lots of palm trees around
[1:06:30] at least not here but
[1:06:32] other warmer places in the world
[1:06:35] and how that
[1:06:37] her name simply means means palm tree
[1:06:39] but when i got to looking up what did
[1:06:42] ah our end time messenger tell us about
[1:06:46] the palm tree
[1:06:47] the first
[1:06:48] place i even found it where he was
[1:06:51] talking about it was when
[1:06:53] a judgment scene
[1:06:56] when shadrach meshach and abednego were
[1:06:59] about to go to the fire
[1:07:02] under the
[1:07:03] persecution of the king of
[1:07:06] babylon confusion
[1:07:10] and he said that
[1:07:12] god had watched it and i know some most
[1:07:15] of you probably heard the story about
[1:07:16] how this angel wanted to go on that
[1:07:18] angel and he said no i'll go myself
[1:07:21] and he said that
[1:07:23] god stands up off his throne
[1:07:26] and
[1:07:26] takes
[1:07:28] a palm frond off the tree of life
[1:07:34] and he goes down and fans the fire way
[1:07:39] with a palm
[1:07:40] frond that he got from the tree of life
[1:07:44] when he left the throne
[1:07:47] how many times in shadows are laying
[1:07:49] just in those little just in the name
[1:07:54] then how that tamar
[1:07:57] represents the tree of life
[1:08:00] she is to become
[1:08:02] she is a church a bride
[1:08:05] and she is going to become the holder
[1:08:09] of the tree of life
[1:08:12] even by her name
[1:08:15] and so the palm tree
[1:08:19] and so
[1:08:20] when she's given her first two husbands
[1:08:23] and they both died
[1:08:26] and she still once she had a desire
[1:08:30] to do that which is expected of a church
[1:08:34] bring forth children
[1:08:38] tell somebody about jesus christ
[1:08:43] it's not just the pastor
[1:08:45] the ministers
[1:08:46] we're just here
[1:08:48] to point you to this
[1:08:51] it's the church's responsibility brother
[1:08:53] branham one time said it's so easy to be
[1:08:54] a christian he said the first things he
[1:08:57] gave four simple rules tell somebody
[1:08:59] about jesus christ
[1:09:01] feed my sheep pray for the sick i forgot
[1:09:03] the fourth one
[1:09:05] but
[1:09:06] so simple
[1:09:10] and how that this palm tree she wants
[1:09:14] to bring forth life
[1:09:17] and she's willing to even do that which
[1:09:19] was
[1:09:20] unseemly and par another part of her
[1:09:23] name
[1:09:25] actually means to struggle
[1:09:28] she struggled with it
[1:09:30] here she was
[1:09:32] you know married twice essentially and
[1:09:36] not with child
[1:09:37] and how that
[1:09:40] she had this desire
[1:09:42] by her name
[1:09:44] my her very name i i'm tree of life i'm
[1:09:48] a palm tree
[1:09:50] and i have nothing
[1:09:52] to show for it
[1:09:55] and how that she struck she she probably
[1:09:58] just struggled with it and thought what
[1:10:00] can i do what can i do and now the the
[1:10:02] other son he's grown and
[1:10:05] i i don't have it
[1:10:09] and she presented herself as a harlot
[1:10:14] knowing that if she was caught
[1:10:16] she could be killed
[1:10:18] and burnt with fire
[1:10:21] knowing
[1:10:22] that judgment could await her and she be
[1:10:25] destroyed
[1:10:28] but she said
[1:10:29] the right thing
[1:10:32] when he said i'm going to give you
[1:10:34] a lamb from the flock
[1:10:38] there's another type running
[1:10:40] i mean they're going all over the place
[1:10:41] this morning
[1:10:43] who's the lamb
[1:10:45] jesus christ where's it going to come
[1:10:47] from the lineage of judah
[1:10:50] judah says i'm going to give you a lamb
[1:10:53] wasn't good enough wasn't the right time
[1:10:56] she needed something right
[1:10:58] now
[1:11:00] she couldn't wait for the lamb
[1:11:06] so she said you know how do i know
[1:11:08] you're a righteous man
[1:11:12] well what do you want
[1:11:14] she said i want
[1:11:16] first she said the ring the signet
[1:11:20] do you realize what she asked for
[1:11:23] when you run the hebrew translation or
[1:11:27] the dictionary
[1:11:29] signet is a seal
[1:11:32] it's the seal the ring the signature
[1:11:36] or the promise
[1:11:38] it's like you go to the bank and you
[1:11:40] know they you go to i want to buy a car
[1:11:42] and they want your signature that's your
[1:11:44] promise
[1:11:46] that you'll pay it's all in the ring
[1:11:49] we use it in the wedding vows
[1:11:52] who giveth this man who giveth this
[1:11:54] woman god bless you this word it's good
[1:11:56] to see you
[1:11:57] and how that
[1:11:59] you know who giveth this ring and so
[1:12:01] forth
[1:12:02] because that's the seal
[1:12:04] to the promises that have been made
[1:12:09] in that ceremony
[1:12:13] and it also means
[1:12:15] to be locked up
[1:12:17] or stopped to close up to make an end to
[1:12:22] to mark seal up or stop
[1:12:26] what's it talking about
[1:12:28] when the man and the woman have made
[1:12:31] that vow and they come together
[1:12:34] and seed is transferred from one to the
[1:12:37] other
[1:12:39] what happens to the womb
[1:12:42] it's stopped
[1:12:46] and only a very short amount of time is
[1:12:49] there so that no other seed can be
[1:12:51] transmitted
[1:12:52] into it
[1:12:54] and we all we know it
[1:12:56] no wonder adam took his wife quickly
[1:13:01] so when she takes the signet
[1:13:04] she's saying i will receive the seal
[1:13:08] i receive the promise
[1:13:10] and the possibility that my womb be
[1:13:12] sealed
[1:13:14] to the promise
[1:13:16] all in the ring
[1:13:18] and then she the next thing she asked
[1:13:20] for and i found this
[1:13:22] i had to really
[1:13:23] dig a little bit because you know we
[1:13:25] think of bracelets as those copper
[1:13:27] things that people wear or
[1:13:29] you know plastic ones or gold ones or
[1:13:31] whatever they are
[1:13:33] but from the hebrew the bracelets there
[1:13:35] were a cord
[1:13:37] a thread a twisted twine
[1:13:41] a lace a line a ribbon
[1:13:44] a ribbon we would call it
[1:13:46] or a wire
[1:13:50] and that
[1:13:51] that is twisted together
[1:13:53] and i've seen him a person gave me one a
[1:13:56] few years ago in leather
[1:13:59] just as a friendship thing and how that
[1:14:03] god uses those things excuse me
[1:14:11] receive the bracelets
[1:14:13] a twisted thread
[1:14:16] and it also means to wrestle with
[1:14:20] like when wrestlers are twisting and
[1:14:22] fighting
[1:14:25] and it's
[1:14:26] like torturous it's a hard thing
[1:14:29] and so we realized
[1:14:31] she had fought
[1:14:33] within herself
[1:14:35] about what to do
[1:14:37] and now she's asking for the seal
[1:14:40] and the thing that shows i fought for
[1:14:42] this
[1:14:44] i fought for it
[1:14:46] and she receives that
[1:14:48] twisted and there's another thing when
[1:14:50] you start to run thread through the
[1:14:52] scripture i think the first place i
[1:14:54] remember finding it anyway was when
[1:14:57] the spies went down into
[1:15:00] went down into
[1:15:02] where rahab another harlot lived
[1:15:05] and how that
[1:15:08] when the king sought to kill them
[1:15:11] he would have judged him and killed him
[1:15:13] but she hit him
[1:15:15] and she let him down by a
[1:15:17] scarlet
[1:15:18] cord
[1:15:21] and here she's saying i want the cord
[1:15:24] i want
[1:15:25] and what did it represent prophet told
[1:15:27] us represents the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:31] so she asks for the seal
[1:15:34] the closed womb
[1:15:36] and the scarlet cord
[1:15:39] upon her wrist
[1:15:40] the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:44] before the lamb arrives
[1:15:48] and the next thing
[1:15:52] the scepter or the staff
[1:15:54] she said i want the staff and what the
[1:15:56] staff means
[1:15:58] it says is well it's just a staff
[1:16:02] and we know it represents jesus christ
[1:16:04] it was a wooden staff david used it well
[1:16:06] everybody talks about the sling and the
[1:16:08] stones but they forget when david went
[1:16:09] to meet goliath he said he walked with
[1:16:11] the staff in his hand
[1:16:13] he held calvary
[1:16:15] in one hand
[1:16:18] and the stones of revelation in another
[1:16:20] hand that were bound in a leather pouch
[1:16:25] signifying the sacrifice
[1:16:28] of the lamb
[1:16:30] oh the word of god just goes on and on
[1:16:32] and on it pours out
[1:16:36] and so she asks for the staff
[1:16:38] and you know when you begin to read
[1:16:40] about the staff
[1:16:42] it's a branch
[1:16:44] and how that
[1:16:46] you know you can't carry the whole tree
[1:16:48] around but you can break the branch off
[1:16:50] and use it as a staff for walking
[1:16:53] or they make lances and arrows and all
[1:16:56] those kind of things out of it this is
[1:16:58] all in that
[1:16:59] uh
[1:17:00] the definition
[1:17:02] a rod
[1:17:03] a shaft a branch off of the vine who's
[1:17:06] the vine
[1:17:09] jesus said i'm the vine you're the
[1:17:10] branches
[1:17:12] and she's asking for a piece of the vine
[1:17:18] i want a piece of him
[1:17:20] i want every bit of piece of him i can
[1:17:22] get
[1:17:24] and this is what she's asking for
[1:17:27] i want a piece of the vine but that
[1:17:29] represented something even more
[1:17:33] it represents the tribe
[1:17:39] you see
[1:17:41] when she asked for that what was she
[1:17:43] asking for
[1:17:45] it's the lineage of judah that's not
[1:17:47] even spoken yet
[1:17:50] that's going to go through time and
[1:17:52] bring us jesus christ
[1:17:55] and how that
[1:17:57] that staff
[1:17:59] that she now possesses
[1:18:04] will take her
[1:18:05] into the lineage of jesus christ
[1:18:10] the very savior of the world
[1:18:13] the god of heaven who the bible said
[1:18:16] spoke all things into existence
[1:18:19] who by the word of his mouth could take
[1:18:22] that palm frond from the tree of life
[1:18:25] and blow the fire back
[1:18:28] from those
[1:18:30] that were thrown into the fire
[1:18:35] my lord and my god
[1:18:38] what did she ask for
[1:18:40] she asked to be
[1:18:42] a member
[1:18:43] of the tribe that would present
[1:18:46] jesus christ
[1:18:49] down through history
[1:18:52] in one of the actual
[1:18:55] they believe it was you know you were
[1:18:57] when you're reading definitions it's
[1:18:58] this this this there's a b c and so on
[1:19:01] one of the last ones it said was
[1:19:04] life support
[1:19:06] and then it goes to a root word which
[1:19:08] means stretched out or to extend
[1:19:14] to spread it out
[1:19:16] to bend or to bow or to pitch the tent
[1:19:22] that's i think was the last one
[1:19:25] to pitch the tent or turn aside
[1:19:28] so when she asks for this staff
[1:19:32] she's asking to be part of the lineage
[1:19:35] she's asking for the right to bear the
[1:19:38] seed of judah
[1:19:41] which becomes in chapter 49
[1:19:46] has a law a wealth of promises my
[1:19:48] brother shall praise thee
[1:19:50] hand shall be in the neck of his enemies
[1:19:52] which actually we've covered this before
[1:19:54] it means to sever the head
[1:19:57] when it says in the neck it's not giving
[1:19:58] a massage you know it's cutting the head
[1:20:00] off
[1:20:03] quite a promise
[1:20:05] laying in that staff
[1:20:07] that staff of life
[1:20:11] and so and it continues there and it
[1:20:13] then it talks about
[1:20:16] christ but then in verse 10
[1:20:21] it says the scepter shall not depart
[1:20:23] from judah nor a lawgiver from between
[1:20:25] his feet till shiloh come
[1:20:28] and then there's that those
[1:20:30] lovely little dots that denote time as
[1:20:32] our pro as the prophet of god said
[1:20:34] and unto him shall the gathering of the
[1:20:37] people be
[1:20:38] this
[1:20:40] scepter
[1:20:42] this
[1:20:44] staff the staff
[1:20:46] of life
[1:20:48] this branch and and i believe i said
[1:20:51] they're the you know one of the
[1:20:52] definitions to spread out or to hold out
[1:20:56] extend forth
[1:20:59] where do we see the scepter again
[1:21:02] where do we see that life being passed
[1:21:06] again
[1:21:08] when esther it looks like all of israel
[1:21:11] is about to be destroyed
[1:21:14] under
[1:21:15] the hand was it was the assyrian or the
[1:21:17] babylon i forgot which it was where they
[1:21:19] were at at that time
[1:21:20] but
[1:21:22] how that
[1:21:23] they laid it again upon the woman
[1:21:27] and she was
[1:21:29] called to be a queen
[1:21:32] but she had no children
[1:21:38] and when she comes before the queen the
[1:21:40] king
[1:21:42] and this time
[1:21:44] again
[1:21:46] judgment is present
[1:21:49] if he doesn't acknowledge her
[1:21:52] with the sector
[1:21:55] she's done for her
[1:22:00] finished
[1:22:02] and it says she erased herself in her
[1:22:04] queenly garments
[1:22:06] she dressed
[1:22:08] herself
[1:22:09] like a queen
[1:22:12] oh bride of jesus christ
[1:22:14] dress yourself
[1:22:16] in the robes of righteousness
[1:22:19] of jesus christ
[1:22:21] that when you present yourself
[1:22:23] before the king
[1:22:25] the scepter
[1:22:27] the life
[1:22:29] when he held out that scepter
[1:22:32] he was actually saying what did he say
[1:22:35] hey what do you want esther you can have
[1:22:37] half the kingdom what was he talking
[1:22:39] about
[1:22:40] his son
[1:22:44] his heritage exactly
[1:22:47] you can have my child i'm offering you
[1:22:50] the tribe of the king
[1:22:59] and she was arrayed
[1:23:01] and she received her request
[1:23:04] a raid as a queen and received the right
[1:23:08] to the tribe
[1:23:09] and the right
[1:23:11] to life
[1:23:13] to her that scepter was a tree of life
[1:23:16] life or death friends
[1:23:19] you must
[1:23:20] come before king jesus
[1:23:25] be dressed right
[1:23:27] have your heart right
[1:23:32] it says created me a clean heart
[1:23:35] and renew a right spirit in me
[1:23:38] bring to me a spirit of righteousness
[1:23:45] he is our righteousness and we become
[1:23:47] the bible says his righteousness
[1:23:50] and as we read from corinthians
[1:23:52] it's in him amen us being in him
[1:23:56] those two heroes make it a great big
[1:24:00] equation
[1:24:02] bride of christ and so
[1:24:04] it said the scepter
[1:24:07] will not depart
[1:24:10] and we know
[1:24:11] if you read the lineages
[1:24:14] how that going down down down through
[1:24:16] history and how that there's a king
[1:24:19] david and
[1:24:21] how that when he went before goliath he
[1:24:23] had the
[1:24:24] scepter or the
[1:24:26] rod in his hand
[1:24:28] the right to the tree of life
[1:24:31] he held it in his hand
[1:24:34] and with the revelation
[1:24:36] of the slain lamb
[1:24:38] in his side pocket and on the on his
[1:24:40] sling
[1:24:43] what a god we serve it's jesus christ
[1:24:47] everywhere
[1:24:49] in the scriptures and not just one place
[1:24:52] or one little look at it there's several
[1:24:55] of these things
[1:24:56] i'm trying to keep it
[1:24:58] on track because we could go out this
[1:25:00] branch
[1:25:01] or we could go out this you know and
[1:25:04] but
[1:25:05] she asked for those things and when she
[1:25:08] went before
[1:25:10] or was to be taken before judah
[1:25:12] and she presented those things
[1:25:16] what did she receive
[1:25:19] the life
[1:25:22] that was in her hand
[1:25:25] the blood
[1:25:26] that was
[1:25:27] on the wrist
[1:25:29] and the seal
[1:25:31] that guarded her womb
[1:25:34] against any other seed
[1:25:37] because this seed was so important that
[1:25:40] god was going to watch it
[1:25:42] all the way to the end time
[1:25:44] in where we are
[1:25:46] and he's going to use this same type and
[1:25:48] this shadow of a woman that struggled
[1:25:51] with inner self
[1:25:53] that what can i do
[1:25:55] judith's coming
[1:25:57] i gotta do something
[1:25:59] and she did the only thing that she
[1:26:01] could think of
[1:26:03] to do
[1:26:05] she presented herself as a harlot
[1:26:08] and judah in his
[1:26:10] righteousness
[1:26:14] takes a harlot
[1:26:17] but what
[1:26:18] i love the scripture where abraham
[1:26:21] is getting ready to slay isaac on the
[1:26:23] mountain
[1:26:26] and we read in i believe it's romans i
[1:26:28] want to say that how that
[1:26:30] said that abraham believed he was going
[1:26:33] to take isaac he was really going to do
[1:26:35] it
[1:26:36] because it said that he believed if god
[1:26:38] had given him that promise once against
[1:26:40] all hope
[1:26:42] he could give it back to him again
[1:26:45] and when he gets ready to slay the child
[1:26:48] and
[1:26:49] the spirit of the lord comes down the
[1:26:51] angel of the lord however like i you
[1:26:53] know
[1:26:54] it comes he comes look god comes down
[1:26:57] and he tells him don't do it abraham
[1:27:00] and what does he
[1:27:02] see well there's a lamb or a ram
[1:27:06] caught in the brush
[1:27:09] we see at the end time a ram
[1:27:11] or i mean it
[1:27:13] a ram caught in the brush
[1:27:18] and how these types they just go go go
[1:27:21] go and it's god he turn
[1:27:24] breaking himself
[1:27:26] here brother david
[1:27:27] here brother sister what what do you
[1:27:29] have need of this morning it's not about
[1:27:32] me
[1:27:34] it's about him
[1:27:36] every single step
[1:27:39] is jesus christ
[1:27:41] and how that as this end time as we're
[1:27:44] about to be thrown into the fire
[1:27:47] or the fire awaits i'll put it that way
[1:27:50] what
[1:27:52] i said we'd call it riding on it
[1:27:55] we're riding on the promises
[1:27:59] of god
[1:28:02] that's
[1:28:03] just
[1:28:04] maybe before we close
[1:28:06] pray for me
[1:28:08] keep your hand your finger we'll go back
[1:28:10] to
[1:28:11] 38 once more before we're finished i
[1:28:14] believe it is
[1:28:16] in zechariah
[1:28:21] it starts out the first part of
[1:28:22] zechariah
[1:28:24] i think it's like the fourth for
[1:28:27] i'd have to look again now but it's uh
[1:28:33] i believe it's four and six he says it's
[1:28:35] not my mount not not by might not by
[1:28:37] power but by my spirit
[1:28:40] saith the lord
[1:28:43] but there's another place in zechariah
[1:28:47] where it's
[1:28:48] talking about the king cometh and that's
[1:28:50] verse 9 or chapter 9 of zechariah
[1:28:58] nine and verse nine
[1:29:01] he's there and he says uh
[1:29:07] rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout
[1:29:10] o daughter of jerusalem behold the king
[1:29:12] cometh unto thee
[1:29:14] he is just and having salvation
[1:29:17] lowly and riding upon an ass
[1:29:20] and upon occult the full of an ass
[1:29:23] and then if you go from there over to
[1:29:25] john the 12th chapter
[1:29:27] what do we see
[1:29:34] in john chapter 12
[1:29:37] this is when jesus is entering jerusalem
[1:29:40] just before
[1:29:42] calvary
[1:29:45] and i believe it's about the 12th verse
[1:29:48] uh
[1:29:52] as he's entering
[1:29:54] yes
[1:29:56] says on the next day much people that
[1:29:58] were come to the feast when they heard
[1:30:00] that jesus was coming to jerusalem
[1:30:03] they took branches of palm trees
[1:30:09] why palm trees
[1:30:12] you know there's other trees that grow
[1:30:13] in israel
[1:30:15] i've been there i've seen them
[1:30:17] but it says they took branches of palm
[1:30:19] trees
[1:30:20] and they cried whose and went forth to
[1:30:23] meet him and they cried hosanna blessed
[1:30:25] is the king of israel that cometh in the
[1:30:27] name of the lord
[1:30:28] and jesus when he had found a young ass
[1:30:31] sat there on as it was written
[1:30:33] fear not
[1:30:34] daughter of zion behold thy king cometh
[1:30:37] sitting on the asses
[1:30:39] colt and it goes on to say that the
[1:30:41] disciples didn't have a clue what was
[1:30:42] going on
[1:30:45] but it was a scriptural fulfillment
[1:30:50] he was riding on it
[1:30:52] he was writing
[1:30:54] on the very scripture
[1:30:57] that said he would do this
[1:30:59] here was the king he wasn't a king yet
[1:31:04] he was
[1:31:05] and yet he was the king of
[1:31:08] judah so to speak
[1:31:10] but you remember judah had to come
[1:31:12] together with all of
[1:31:14] israel
[1:31:15] back in chronicle we find that happens
[1:31:18] and how that
[1:31:20] here is
[1:31:22] jesus
[1:31:24] and it said this was done
[1:31:26] to fulfill
[1:31:29] that
[1:31:32] fear not the king comes sitting on the
[1:31:34] asses cold
[1:31:36] and so here's jesus
[1:31:38] and they're throwing out
[1:31:41] ah
[1:31:44] the king got up and took a lot
[1:31:46] a frond from the
[1:31:49] off the palm tree the tree of life
[1:31:51] and they're throwing out the palms
[1:31:54] and they're calling out hosanna
[1:31:57] to the king
[1:31:59] and he's riding on the promise
[1:32:03] that he will become the king
[1:32:06] because right then he's
[1:32:08] an unseen king
[1:32:10] he's unrecognized
[1:32:14] and remember when david
[1:32:16] through that just how the scripture
[1:32:18] repeats over and over and how that he
[1:32:21] wrote into jerusalem
[1:32:24] on the back of a donkey
[1:32:26] i'm sure they had nice horses
[1:32:29] why a donkey
[1:32:32] because it's the word of god
[1:32:34] presenting itself again
[1:32:37] and
[1:32:38] again
[1:32:40] again
[1:32:41] so the bride of christ you'll not miss
[1:32:43] it
[1:32:44] it's all jesus christ
[1:32:47] and so here he is he's riding on the
[1:32:50] very promise
[1:32:52] spoken of by zachariah and that's not
[1:32:54] the only place because we read it back
[1:32:57] there in genesis 49 right
[1:33:01] binding his fall into the vine in his
[1:33:03] asses cold unto the choice vine he
[1:33:06] washed his garments in wine
[1:33:09] and his clothes in the blood of grapes
[1:33:13] the promise
[1:33:15] of genesis 49
[1:33:17] and how it ran through time and it
[1:33:20] hooked up with zachariah
[1:33:22] and then we see it in jesus christ
[1:33:25] and we see that same humility coming
[1:33:28] through all the way to us
[1:33:31] we have a different promise
[1:33:34] i'm not planning on riding a donkey out
[1:33:36] of here
[1:33:38] but our promise is you shall not all die
[1:33:40] you shall be changed
[1:33:43] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:33:45] there's other promises that relate to
[1:33:47] the bride of jesus christ
[1:33:49] let's just i said we're getting ready to
[1:33:51] close
[1:33:52] uh look let's look at isaiah 28 for just
[1:33:55] a moment
[1:33:57] to help you understand
[1:33:59] we started out by talking about you know
[1:34:02] perplexed of times and all that and the
[1:34:04] struggles that we're going through
[1:34:06] but watch isaiah 28
[1:34:10] jesus i love you
[1:34:16] he starts out there and he's talking
[1:34:18] about the crown of pride to the
[1:34:19] drunkards and so on at the first verse
[1:34:21] there
[1:34:22] of uh
[1:34:23] isaiah 28
[1:34:25] and he comes down and he's talking about
[1:34:27] those things and
[1:34:30] and uh i
[1:34:35] want to make sure i get the right spot
[1:34:36] here uh
[1:34:39] well picking it up at verse 5 in that
[1:34:42] day shall yes
[1:34:44] verse 5 28 5 in that day shall the lord
[1:34:47] of hosts
[1:34:50] be a crown of glory and for a diadem of
[1:34:52] beauty unto the residue of his people
[1:34:55] and for a spirit of judgment to him that
[1:34:58] sits in judgment and for strength to
[1:35:01] them that turn the battle to the gate
[1:35:06] what's our command
[1:35:07] in this day and age
[1:35:09] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:35:14] not only see taste your feel smell
[1:35:17] but all the imaginations the reasoning
[1:35:21] the memories
[1:35:23] all the things that you are being
[1:35:25] anointed of and that are being bombarded
[1:35:28] you can't even walk in a grocery store
[1:35:30] without here and you know when i find
[1:35:32] myself in times of trouble mother mary
[1:35:35] comes to me
[1:35:36] antichrist doctrine and you have to
[1:35:39] listen to it in a grocery store i've
[1:35:41] heard it been there done it
[1:35:46] and we are being anointed of those
[1:35:48] things
[1:35:50] there's a scripture that said they'll
[1:35:51] believe a lie and be damned by it
[1:35:54] oh they don't like to use that word it's
[1:35:56] not politically correct
[1:35:58] of course it's not because it's telling
[1:36:00] them who they are
[1:36:02] and where they're going
[1:36:04] well okay so this anointing
[1:36:08] is for a spirit of judgment
[1:36:11] everybody says now brother branham said
[1:36:12] don't
[1:36:13] we don't want judge he said you don't
[1:36:15] want justice
[1:36:17] justice is different than judgment
[1:36:21] justice is the receiving of the reward
[1:36:23] that you get
[1:36:25] from the judgment
[1:36:27] no i don't want justice
[1:36:30] in that sense
[1:36:31] because i know what this man would
[1:36:34] deserve
[1:36:36] but the spirit of judgment is to have
[1:36:38] the ability to know right from wrong
[1:36:43] what was the elijah ministry all about
[1:36:46] they didn't even know right from wrong
[1:36:50] it had been 2 000 years since a prophet
[1:36:53] had been on the scene since the days of
[1:36:55] paul
[1:36:56] who spoke
[1:36:58] romans corinthians galatians ephesians
[1:37:03] to give us proper judgment
[1:37:06] so what is
[1:37:08] where are we going with this i'm riding
[1:37:10] on it
[1:37:11] i'm riding on the fact that he has sent
[1:37:14] a spirit of judgment to teach me to
[1:37:17] teach us
[1:37:18] to teach you
[1:37:20] right from wrong
[1:37:23] and to have the spirit to stand on it or
[1:37:27] write on it to know that when you are in
[1:37:30] the proper position of judgment you have
[1:37:33] somebody that'll stand there behind you
[1:37:36] with a signal
[1:37:39] with a seal
[1:37:41] with the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:43] with the staff of the bloodline i am a
[1:37:47] part of jesus christ by the blood of
[1:37:50] jesus christ by the seal
[1:37:54] of the holy ghost
[1:37:57] but let's back up just one more can you
[1:37:59] just
[1:38:00] grant me a couple more minutes here
[1:38:03] we started out
[1:38:06] it says in that day that's talking about
[1:38:08] our day
[1:38:10] because if you go on down
[1:38:12] it talks about receiving the holy ghost
[1:38:15] and in verse
[1:38:16] 12
[1:38:17] it talks about the refreshing
[1:38:20] what's so special about the refreshing
[1:38:22] here's here's another branch
[1:38:24] go for it brother david
[1:38:26] it's another branch refreshing
[1:38:29] and when you go over to the book of acts
[1:38:32] it says that at the time of the
[1:38:33] refreshing
[1:38:35] the wind from those palm leaves
[1:38:39] from the tree of life
[1:38:44] your sins are blotted out
[1:38:47] blotted
[1:38:48] out is what it says i believe in acts
[1:38:52] and we had a message
[1:38:54] that he said
[1:38:56] it's like a bucket of bleach
[1:38:58] a great big
[1:39:00] deal of bleach
[1:39:02] and when you confess your sins
[1:39:04] he said it's like you take a little ink
[1:39:06] dropper
[1:39:09] and you got all of them in that little
[1:39:10] ink dropper
[1:39:12] and you drop it in the bucket
[1:39:16] and he said
[1:39:17] the bleach is so strong
[1:39:20] it tears that ink down
[1:39:23] in one place he said
[1:39:25] to where it's as though it never
[1:39:28] existed
[1:39:31] your sins if they are put under the
[1:39:33] blood
[1:39:34] that he call it the clorox of the blood
[1:39:37] of jesus christ your sin
[1:39:40] never existed
[1:39:43] and even a god who knows all things
[1:39:46] who sees all things which is what he
[1:39:48] said to abraham abraham called him
[1:39:50] jehovah jireh which means the god
[1:39:53] provides
[1:39:54] and god sees
[1:39:55] because god saw his heart
[1:39:58] he knew he'd go through with it
[1:40:03] and the god that sees
[1:40:05] refuses to see something that never
[1:40:09] existed
[1:40:15] if that doesn't make you love jesus
[1:40:17] christ i don't know what will
[1:40:21] your sin
[1:40:22] never existed
[1:40:24] once it's confessed
[1:40:26] and put under that blood never existed
[1:40:31] and there was a woman
[1:40:33] who said give me the
[1:40:35] give me that ring give me that twisting
[1:40:40] that jesus in the garden
[1:40:43] prayed until he wept and the blood
[1:40:45] flowed from his
[1:40:46] body
[1:40:48] twisted tortured
[1:40:51] over this decision
[1:40:53] and he just wrote on that promise
[1:40:55] the king comes
[1:40:57] riding
[1:40:58] on the fall of an ass
[1:41:00] all the way from genesis
[1:41:02] and i believe there's two or three other
[1:41:03] places that mentions it or it sho or it
[1:41:06] shows it in type and shadow
[1:41:11] jesus was riding
[1:41:13] on his own promises from the word
[1:41:16] and he's called the word of god
[1:41:19] i'm writing
[1:41:21] this morning
[1:41:23] on the promises of god
[1:41:27] we who were unworthy and fit
[1:41:30] on
[1:41:32] whatever you want to call it
[1:41:37] we who were typed and shadowed in the
[1:41:39] scripture like tamar the harlot
[1:41:42] like rahab as a harlot
[1:41:44] like ruth as an outcast
[1:41:47] from an un unclean nation
[1:41:50] are made clean
[1:41:52] by the seal
[1:41:54] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:41:56] and by the staff of life
[1:41:59] that said if any man come
[1:42:01] i will in no wise cast him out
[1:42:05] oh bride of christ
[1:42:07] do we really
[1:42:09] really understand who we are amen
[1:42:13] equations big
[1:42:15] we might be the little zeros
[1:42:18] but we have one tremendous tremendous i
[1:42:22] can't say it enough tremendous awesome
[1:42:25] god
[1:42:28] his name is jesus christ
[1:42:30] if you don't know him if there's someone
[1:42:32] listening out i don't know i suppose it
[1:42:34] was going out this morning and you don't
[1:42:36] know jesus christ
[1:42:38] please
[1:42:40] ask him into your heart amen
[1:42:44] ask him to come and give you
[1:42:47] the tokens it says in one place
[1:42:51] that she received
[1:42:52] at the hand and the word of judah
[1:42:59] the scepter will not depart from his
[1:43:01] hand
[1:43:02] the life of jesus christ
[1:43:06] will not depart
[1:43:09] from your life
[1:43:11] because he said so
[1:43:13] not only did he say
[1:43:15] uh you know if any man comes he said i
[1:43:18] will never leave you
[1:43:20] nor forsake you i'm riding on it
[1:43:24] when i find my face in the gutter and
[1:43:26] think about some
[1:43:28] foolish decisions things that i've done
[1:43:30] or said
[1:43:33] where can i look but to that bleach
[1:43:35] blood of jesus christ and to the promise
[1:43:40] of the word of god
[1:43:42] that said i'll never leave you or
[1:43:44] forsake you
[1:43:46] he can't
[1:43:48] because your womb is
[1:43:50] sealed and the staff of life is now
[1:43:54] dwelling
[1:43:56] living and presenting itself to a dying
[1:43:58] world through your bodies

[1:54:33] sometimes how the lord does things
[1:54:36] thought will come on your mind and
[1:54:37] you're thinking oh my
[1:54:39] and then the minister speaks it and you
[1:54:41] know i was just thinking about this this
[1:54:43] morning you know brother david started
[1:54:45] off and said you know
[1:54:46] the 20-minute version or the two-hour
[1:54:49] version or
[1:54:50] but my brother and sister this word of
[1:54:52] god is not a time limited version
[1:54:55] it is a lifelong version amen the word
[1:54:59] being placed in us building us up
[1:55:01] building us up giving us the strength
[1:55:03] the courage the wisdom that we need and
[1:55:06] you know you think about as brother
[1:55:08] david was speaking today what is the
[1:55:10] proper judgment for this age
[1:55:12] now i know there's a lot of avenues that
[1:55:14] our minds can go down but my brother and
[1:55:16] sister when you get right down to the
[1:55:18] very basis of it all the proper judgment
[1:55:21] for this age
[1:55:23] is the bride
[1:55:24] taking her fault
[1:55:27] to the throne
[1:55:29] putting it brother david touched it
[1:55:30] putting it under the blood and being
[1:55:33] able to walk away without condemnation
[1:55:36] there's the proper judgment for the age
[1:55:38] all those who do that
[1:55:40] will not be judged in any other fashion
[1:55:44] see that's the beauty of it right there
[1:55:45] to get the proper judgment that is us in
[1:55:48] communion
[1:55:49] going to our lord jesus christ and
[1:55:51] saying lord forgive me i thought this i
[1:55:53] did this i said this
[1:55:55] and then it's gone it's done finished
[1:55:57] there's the proper judgment for an age
[1:55:58] that's what the prophet of god showed us
[1:56:01] that our calling is to go to the word
[1:56:04] first and the word corrects us yes amen
[1:56:07] i love that amen and also brother david
[1:56:10] as he was speaking as it come you see
[1:56:13] the signet the bracelet the staff
[1:56:17] was all
[1:56:19] because it was not the season for the
[1:56:21] lamb

[1:56:25] we are standing here today
[1:56:28] now don't misunderstand me
[1:56:30] but we're not here today in the season
[1:56:32] of the segment

[1:56:35] we're not here in the season
[1:56:38] of the bracelet
[1:56:41] we're not here in this season as it were

[1:57:32] say
[1:57:33] my revelation
[1:57:35] came from the father
[1:57:38] of the family
[1:57:40] it came
[1:57:42] from that one
[1:57:44] amen
[1:57:45] who
[1:57:46] his word
[1:57:48] is the word that either commuted or
[1:57:50] executed
[1:57:51] judgment
[1:57:53] that's where this revelation comes from
[1:57:55] it is not a man revelation it is not our
[1:57:58] own revelation but it is the revelation
[1:58:02] of our god
[1:58:03] amen of our lord jesus christ that he's
[1:58:06] placed into the very body of believers
[1:58:09] for us to come and bear it to fruition
