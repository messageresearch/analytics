[30:45] to you
[30:46] amen
[30:47] i didn't say trial free or struggle free
[30:50] just good amen because it is the word
[30:54] that is making the difference in our
[30:56] life and the word has to be applied and
[30:59] when we come to circumstances in our
[31:01] life that causes us to dig deeper and
[31:04] apply the word
[31:05] than we grow and it's beneficial to us
[31:09] amen
[31:10] so i just have a couple things um that
[31:13] um would like to just bring up today
[31:16] uh question was brought to sue's sister
[31:19] jerry uh and you know sometimes we just
[31:22] don't think about things right things
[31:24] are happening in the world and we don't
[31:26] really focus but uh it was brought the
[31:29] question are there believers in
[31:31] afghanistan so i just reached out
[31:35] to um
[31:37] some brothers that i know that you know
[31:39] have you might say a kind of more
[31:43] worldwide footprint
[31:45] and it has been shared that they know of
[31:47] at least a hundred around a hundred
[31:50] believers ministers elders
[31:53] there's baptisms taking place
[31:55] conversions
[31:57] it was said that they would love to
[31:59] leave the country if they could
[32:01] but you know my brother and sister um
[32:05] it's interesting because just with that
[32:06] thought in mind i was reading and and uh
[32:09] you know people are asking brother
[32:11] branham now are we all supposed to move
[32:13] you know as it were to arizona to tucson
[32:17] and brother branham clarifies that and
[32:18] he says no this bride comes out of every
[32:21] nation
[32:22] not we all pick up and move to one spot
[32:25] but comes out of every nation
[32:26] so
[32:27] you know i would just encourage you
[32:29] let's not sit here and say lord let them
[32:31] escape their circumstance but lord meet
[32:33] them
[32:34] in their circumstance right daniel met
[32:36] the lion in the den
[32:39] amen shadrach meshach and abednego met
[32:42] the pillar of fire in the midst of the
[32:45] fire
[32:45] amen so we just want to just lift up our
[32:48] brothers and sisters there actually all
[32:51] of those countries you know it's
[32:52] actually by law punishable by death to
[32:54] be a christian in pakistan
[32:57] so you know just many circumstances of
[32:59] that world but god's going to bring that
[33:01] bride through amen going to deliver her
[33:05] out of the mouth of lions from the edge
[33:07] of the sword amen and raise the dead
[33:10] amen so we just want to just lift them
[33:14] up as we should be lifting every part of
[33:17] the bride of christ up before the lord
[33:19] amen
[33:20] so um just interesting thank you for
[33:23] those that you know brought that to
[33:24] light cause us to kind of look and think
[33:27] okay what is happening there
[33:30] i bring greetings to you from brother
[33:32] george
[33:33] he was kind enough to call me yesterday
[33:35] we had a lovely conversation just wanted
[33:38] us to know that he is doing very well
[33:42] in his recovery from covid uh gaining
[33:44] his strength back he said he's still you
[33:46] know just a little bit weak you know he
[33:49] lives in a house
[33:51] that they built
[33:54] many years ago and he says basically he
[33:56] says i find more and more reasons to not
[33:58] climb the stairs
[34:00] so
[34:01] but it is home to him and um you know
[34:04] holds many memories of
[34:06] of sister rebecca for him so just
[34:08] remember brother george he said he will
[34:11] come and visit us um just as soon as
[34:13] possible
[34:14] uh so we're we're proposing ideas to him
[34:18] when soon is and uh so we just asked the
[34:22] lord's blessings on him

[34:26] would know
[34:27] that we're going to have a little 90th
[34:28] birthday party for mom

[34:58] little time there let's just uh go to

[35:35] today so we want to just go into john
[35:38] the fifth chapter starting with verse
[35:40] 24.
[35:44] um
[35:45] you know we have to remember now brother
[35:47] branham says and it just so clearly
[35:49] makes sense brother brown says you know
[35:52] that um we can't come preaching a gospel
[35:55] or message of another day right but the
[35:58] lovely thing saints is that we are here
[36:01] in the seventh church age as it is in
[36:03] scripture revelations two and three we
[36:05] see this but we're in this seventh
[36:09] church age we're in the culmination of
[36:11] the ages so we get to bring the message
[36:14] of every age into our age because it's
[36:16] applicable so it isn't that we will sit
[36:19] here today and say well we can't preach
[36:21] the message of moses or noah or
[36:24] enoch we can take all of the gospel
[36:27] that's been revealed or brought out in
[36:30] this day and and we can glean as it were
[36:33] or take part of that and so we just want
[36:36] to uh just look at the word not as in
[36:40] past tense amen don't always look at the
[36:42] word like oh that was spoke by john that
[36:45] was spoke by paul
[36:47] but take it and apply the word to our
[36:49] day which reminds me of two things we
[36:52] missed i
[36:53] see little vanessa is doing fine today
[36:56] she sprained her arm or something
[36:58] my
[36:59] such a tomboy so it's good to see her
[37:02] today
[37:03] and also
[37:05] um
[37:06] i want to i want to
[37:10] take brother sergey's mother
[37:13] take her from the obscure
[37:17] and to introduce her
[37:20] as it were into the body
[37:22] so she is no longer
[37:24] brother sergey's mother
[37:27] she she is sister nadia
[37:31] okay so if you have a reference you have
[37:33] a prayer request it is no longer brother
[37:36] sergey's mother the obscure
[37:39] it is sister nadia
[37:42] our sister in christ okay so um
[37:46] while she's not here yet to introduce in
[37:49] the in the physical realm um we have
[37:52] been introduced to our sister and uh so
[37:55] i for one uh want to move from just that
[37:58] vague reference to something personal
[38:01] amen i don't see our sister nadia today
[38:04] it's not feeling well
[38:06] yes um so
[38:08] um no more than we would want to refer
[38:11] to our sister nada as brother ivan's
[38:14] wife
[38:16] hey man she's our sister
[38:19] right okay
[38:20] amen
[38:22] john the fifth chapter starting with
[38:23] verse 24
[38:25] verily verily i say unto you he heareth
[38:28] my word and believeth on him that sent
[38:30] me so a direct correlation between
[38:34] hearing what jesus is speaking
[38:37] is a direct correlation to believing on
[38:39] him that sent him
[38:42] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[38:44] into condemnation but is passed from
[38:46] death and to life
[38:48] verily verily i say unto you the hour is
[38:50] coming
[38:51] and
[38:52] now is
[38:54] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[38:56] the son of god
[38:58] and they that here shall live
[39:02] now is he talking about the dead in the
[39:04] grave
[39:09] for as the father hath life
[39:12] in himself
[39:13] so hath he given to the son to have life
[39:17] in himself
[39:19] and hath given him authority to execute
[39:22] judgment
[39:23] also because he is the son of man
[39:27] marvel not at this for the hours coming
[39:29] in which all that are in the graves
[39:32] shall hear his voice and shall come
[39:35] forth
[39:36] they that have done good unto the
[39:38] resurrection of life
[39:40] and they that have done evil unto the
[39:43] resurrection
[39:44] of damnation now many years ago i
[39:47] remember there was a little something
[39:48] stirred around where we were at and
[39:51] fellowshipping and and people wanted to
[39:54] know will those that are lost have a
[39:56] resurrection
[39:58] yes they will
[40:00] they will stand in a judgment
[40:02] they will have to stand at the white
[40:04] throne of judgment before god and be
[40:07] judged so they will be just as living as
[40:10] they was
[40:11] on the day they stood on the earth
[40:14] but
[40:15] i don't like
[40:17] the resurrection of damnation
[40:20] it doesn't there's nothing appealing to
[40:21] that there has to be saints an anointing
[40:24] on people to not care about the eternal
[40:29] there has to be a very very strong
[40:32] anointing
[40:33] to not care
[40:35] anything about the future i i we don't
[40:38] know that there's a god we don't know
[40:39] that there's eternity it doesn't matter
[40:41] because we're going to live in the now
[40:43] there's a very strong anointing
[40:46] because it isn't the very nature of man
[40:48] to worship and why would we worship if
[40:50] there's nothing there to worship
[40:54] satan is a very slippery character isn't
[40:56] he
[40:58] i can of my own self do nothing
[41:02] as i hear
[41:04] i judge and my judgment is just
[41:08] because i seek not my own will can we
[41:11] say lord we seek not our own will
[41:14] but the will of the father which hath
[41:16] sent me if i bear witness now this is a
[41:19] key scripture right here if i bear
[41:21] witness of myself
[41:23] my witness is not true
[41:28] there is another that beareth witness of
[41:30] me
[41:30] and i know that the witness which he
[41:33] witnesses of me is true
[41:36] he sent unto john and he bear witness
[41:38] unto the truth
[41:40] but i
[41:41] receive not testimony from man
[41:45] but these things i say that you might be
[41:48] saved
[41:49] he was a burning and a shining light and
[41:51] you were willing for a season
[41:54] to rejoice in his light
[41:56] but i have greater witness than that of
[41:58] john for the works which the father have
[42:01] given me to finish the same works that i
[42:04] do bear witness of me that the father
[42:06] hath sent me
[42:08] and the father himself which has sent me
[42:10] hath born witness of me
[42:13] you have neither heard his voice at any
[42:16] time nor seen his shape you have not his
[42:19] word abiding in you for whom he has sent
[42:23] him ye believe not
[42:25] search the scriptures for in them you
[42:27] think you have eternal life
[42:29] and they are they which testify of me
[42:32] and you will not come to me that you
[42:34] might have life
[42:37] i receive not honor from men
[42:40] but i know ye that you have not the love
[42:42] of god in you
[42:43] i am come in my father's name you
[42:45] receive me not if another shall come in
[42:48] his own name him you will receive
[42:51] how can you believe which receive honor
[42:53] one of another and seek not the honor
[42:57] that cometh from god only
[43:00] heavenly father we just ask you lord
[43:02] jesus the blessings upon your word in
[43:05] the name of jesus christ amen
[43:08] you may be seated i want to just go
[43:10] ahead and finish this last little
[43:11] scripture
[43:13] do not think that i will accuse you to
[43:14] the father there is one that accuses you
[43:17] even moses and whom ye trust
[43:19] for had ye believed moses you would have
[43:22] believed me for he wrote of me
[43:25] but if you believe not his writings how
[43:27] shall you believe my words
[43:30] amen
[43:31] so as we look at this this morning my
[43:33] brother and sister i just want to come
[43:35] and just as the title uh has said his
[43:38] testimony has become my testimony and as
[43:42] we will look at the things of god we are
[43:44] not here my brother and sister by our
[43:47] knowledge by theology to try to define
[43:50] god would it not be amazing that the
[43:53] great hallow oh hallelujah just my heart
[43:56] just grips this the great almighty
[43:59] jehovah that made heavens and earth and
[44:03] we as finite humans are going to define
[44:06] him
[44:07] we are going to then put as it were a
[44:10] boundary a box whatever it would be
[44:13] describing who god is and how he
[44:15] operates and how he thinks and what he
[44:18] will do it shows us how you might say
[44:21] the very arrogance of mankind that we
[44:24] believe we could actually put god in a
[44:27] box
[44:28] and so as we would look at this today uh
[44:32] i want to just uh bring a little
[44:34] highlight before we move on
[44:36] amen verse 31 says if i bear witness of
[44:40] myself
[44:41] my witness is not true and
[44:44] i just want to make some sideline
[44:45] references i actually put these
[44:47] scriptures in and took them back out but
[44:49] the scripture says that every man is
[44:51] right in his own eyes so it's really
[44:53] hard for us to bear witness to come and
[44:57] and only under the humility or influence
[44:59] of the holy spirit can a man really
[45:01] stand up and say you know what i'm a
[45:03] weak and frail creature i am prone to do
[45:07] the wrong things i can do nothing
[45:08] without christ my brother and sister let
[45:11] that not just be vocabulary cliches but
[45:14] let those things be real that we
[45:16] recognize that no man have you ever
[45:19] noticed now
[45:20] you know it is it is interesting
[45:24] uh and i i have some examples in my mind
[45:27] but i probably won't go there this
[45:29] morning i don't want to even think about
[45:31] politics but you know if the sugar bowl
[45:34] gets set on the corner of the table and
[45:36] we walk by and knock the sugar bowl on
[45:39] the floor and it busts my brother and
[45:41] sister it's like the human nature not to
[45:44] acknowledge that it was our elbow or
[45:46] hand that knocked the bowl off but we
[45:48] turn and say well somebody left the
[45:50] sugar bowl
[45:52] because it is of our nature to go ahead
[45:55] and nudge that over oftentimes we will
[45:58] not uh uh give the full story you know i
[46:02] just read a deal here recently that said
[46:04] um you know uh when when uh men have
[46:08] disagreements i'll paraphrase this it's
[46:10] a little lengthy but when men have
[46:12] disagreements and find separation
[46:14] amongst themselves you will find that
[46:17] each man will tell the story in the
[46:19] light that makes him look good
[46:22] and so it's by that very nature of
[46:25] humanity when we start to bear witness
[46:27] of ourself we're never going to
[46:30] i shouldn't say never but it is not the
[46:33] human nature my brother and sister to
[46:36] put ourselves in the negative light and
[46:38] and jesus comes here and says you know
[46:40] if i bear witness of myself my witness
[46:43] is not true he's not really speaking of
[46:45] himself jesus christ the word made flesh
[46:49] but he's laying down a principle to you
[46:51] and i that we could understand that if
[46:54] jesus was to stand up and literally just
[46:56] as it were i wouldn't say arrogantly or
[46:58] boastfully but say i you know i am the
[47:01] messiah i am this i am that my brother
[47:04] and sister that would not be the
[47:06] fulfilling of the word it would be
[47:08] speaking of a man it would be speaking
[47:10] of the characterization of an individual
[47:13] and so he makes this acknowledgement if
[47:15] i bear witness of myself my witness is
[47:18] not true but there's another that
[47:20] beareth witness of me and i know that
[47:22] the witness which he witnesses of me is
[47:25] true and i want to just put it this way
[47:27] this morning that we as sons and
[47:29] daughters of god have many frailties in
[47:32] our life many shortcomings in our life
[47:34] many things that we do that the moment
[47:36] we have done them or said them or
[47:38] whatever we're saying lord forgive me
[47:40] that's not who i am i didn't mean that
[47:42] thought or that action or do whatever
[47:44] lord just forgive me for that and so as
[47:47] we recognize my brother and sister that
[47:49] if we could just look at ourselves the
[47:51] way the devil looked at us you don't
[47:53] hear that preach very often just go
[47:55] ahead and look at yourself this morning
[47:57] in the way the devil looks at you
[48:00] he's been trying to tell you how to look
[48:02] at yourself for years
[48:04] and if you look at yourself in that you
[48:07] will find not one good thing in you
[48:11] you will not find one redeeming factor
[48:14] in you
[48:15] but my brother and sister there's one
[48:17] that bears witness of you and he's the
[48:19] one that says you've been redeemed
[48:21] before the foundation of the world my
[48:23] blood has covered every sin every
[48:26] failure every weakness you are my chosen
[48:29] ones amen so there's a witness that
[48:32] bears witness of us as sons and
[48:34] daughters of god and i say i'm not going
[48:36] to listen to what the devil said i'm
[48:38] going to listen to what the lord jesus
[48:40] said of us what the word says because i
[48:43] know that that witness that is witnessed
[48:46] of me witnessed of you is true can
[48:49] someone say amen this morning god's
[48:51] witness my brother and sister is the
[48:53] witness we care about
[48:55] amen so it's there you see
[48:58] if we receive
[49:00] not testimony of men
[49:05] testimony of men is good
[49:09] but the testimony that jesus christ was
[49:11] speaking of here in the word
[49:14] is a very testimony
[49:17] that was placed in the ark
[49:20] this was not jesus just making some
[49:22] vague reference my brother and sister
[49:24] but we can go right back into the book
[49:26] of exodus and we can come here in the
[49:29] 25th chapter and we can make a direct
[49:32] correlation and i shall put in the ark
[49:34] the testimony which i shall give thee
[49:37] amen so that testimony god does not draw
[49:40] random my brother sister god has a very
[49:43] very precise plan it is laid out very
[49:46] concisely and it's always on time and it
[49:49] always contains every element necessary
[49:51] to fulfill itself
[49:54] and so it's there that he says i'm going
[49:56] to put this testimony in the ark which i
[49:58] shall give thee and so now here is our
[50:01] lord jesus amen he is saying i receive
[50:05] not the testimony from man but these
[50:07] things i say that ye might be saved he's
[50:09] talking about this witness that has been
[50:12] given to him and this testimony now that
[50:15] he is coming forth to fulfill my brother
[50:17] and sister this is the very testimony
[50:20] that was in the ark this is the very
[50:22] word of god for fulfilled in the hour
[50:27] that it was necessary to be fulfilled
[50:29] and so he stands there right before
[50:31] those people a time a season that the
[50:34] word must be fulfilled you might say an
[50:35] anchor point in history and so this must
[50:38] come to pass and now he's speaking not a
[50:41] new testimony
[50:44] amen not another testimony but the
[50:47] testimony that was in the ark is now
[50:50] come it come right out of the holiest of
[50:52] holies that have been placed in the ark
[50:54] and now being brought and testified in
[50:57] the human form before the people you
[51:00] know it's a lot easier my brother and
[51:01] sister just to say every promise in this
[51:04] book is mine but how about us having
[51:06] enough courage and enough time and
[51:08] enough sincerity to dig through the book
[51:11] and find out what the promises really
[51:13] are it's one thing to just talk in a
[51:15] vague point of view and say oh praise
[51:18] the lord he's a healer well name what
[51:20] you need healed specifically
[51:23] not just a vague thing lord i know
[51:25] you're a healer i just picked up you
[51:27] know i have a blood sugar issue and i
[51:29] just have to be studying and i picked up
[51:31] a book and i just it kind of opened
[51:33] randomly and right there boldly before
[51:36] my eyes
[51:38] god heals diabetes
[51:42] thank you lord
[51:44] i claim that in the name of jesus christ
[51:49] amen
[51:50] we're not looking here for something
[51:52] vague
[51:57] so as we look here
[51:59] in the book of exodus
[52:02] so the very scripture verse 16 that is
[52:05] placing the testimony in the ark
[52:09] precedes the very testimony that
[52:11] declares
[52:13] the mercy seat
[52:14] you see my brother and sister there's a
[52:16] correlation between these
[52:18] what is in the ark and what is in on the
[52:22] mercy seat amen because you see the very
[52:25] blood had to be shed upon the mercy seat
[52:28] and upon the ark it was not a separate
[52:31] event not a separate blood not a
[52:33] separate promise not a separate
[52:35] dispensation but it was the same that
[52:38] sealed our mercy
[52:41] oh come on saints
[52:43] sealed our mercy and sealed our
[52:47] testimony
[52:48] the very blood that sealed you
[52:51] hallelujah put your sin in the sea of
[52:54] god forgetfulness is the very blood that
[52:58] brought you and said here will be the
[53:01] testimony that you shall live out
[53:05] hallelujah
[53:07] hallelujah
[53:10] so you see what is what is happening now
[53:12] is i've already kind of hit upon this
[53:14] but i want to come back
[53:15] jesus is now
[53:17] manifesting
[53:20] oftentimes does this seem loud to you
[53:23] is it just loud up here
[53:25] it's good okay i can deal with it
[53:29] you see some people struggle they they
[53:31] say well you sure are caught up on this
[53:34] manifesting yes i am
[53:36] because you see i want this word to come
[53:38] off this page
[53:39] and become alive in me
[53:41] i don't want it to be a forum of
[53:43] discussion i don't want it to be
[53:45] something as a reference i want it to be
[53:48] me
[53:49] i want it to be you
[53:51] i want the word to be a living word not
[53:54] not just something that we attain to a
[53:56] creed because i'm going to say a very
[53:58] bold statement if we're going to just
[54:00] settle for creed my brother and sister
[54:02] there's a religions that require a lot
[54:04] less of you
[54:09] if that's all we're going to do is find
[54:10] creed let's find creed
[54:12] you know
[54:13] google it
[54:15] find the easiest creed you can find
[54:18] it's not about creed it's about life
[54:21] it's about christ
[54:23] so jesus says now look my brother and
[54:26] sister jesus is now
[54:28] manifesting the testimony that had been
[54:31] placed in the ark
[54:32] we're not talking about men trying to be
[54:35] faithful to the word of god and men
[54:37] pressing forward and each year bringing
[54:39] the blood of bulls and goats to atone
[54:42] for their sin we're talking about now a
[54:44] day by day living word in a living
[54:48] people that the blood has now been
[54:50] sprinkled over us the goat doesn't
[54:53] matter no longer the bull doesn't matter
[54:55] no longer the lamb as it were in the
[54:57] physical form does not matter any longer
[55:00] because we have been given the lamb and
[55:02] the lamb's blood has not been sprinkled
[55:04] over an altar it's been sprinkled over
[55:06] us
[55:07] and it's that life-changing event of
[55:09] coming under that anointing
[55:12] amen
[55:13] of the living word manifested
[55:16] hallelujah
[55:18] you see what it was doing was bringing
[55:20] the life that was in the ark into the
[55:21] presence of the people
[55:23] now you see the priesthood
[55:26] experienced this in the old testament to
[55:29] a certain degree
[55:30] they were there once a year coming
[55:32] everything had to be perfect the thread
[55:35] the pomegranate the oil the right
[55:37] clothing everything done but you see
[55:40] there was as it were my brother and
[55:42] sister that slight
[55:44] margin of error let's call it that do
[55:46] any of you experience a margin of error
[55:48] in your life
[55:51] i will raise mine
[55:53] amen there's three four five
[55:55] amen i'm gonna lift my other hand for
[55:57] those of you that didn't have the energy
[55:58] to lift yours
[56:00] we have a margin of error
[56:02] satan would like to exploit the margin
[56:04] of error
[56:05] he would like to take the margin of
[56:07] error and show you because the air is
[56:09] there that you must not be it but you
[56:11] see my brother and sister in the human
[56:13] element we've never been able to do away
[56:15] with the margin of error
[56:17] i was just reading a poll
[56:20] that was being quoted by another group
[56:24] and they said well at the end of the
[56:26] whole thing about this poll they said
[56:27] well
[56:28] now this pollster is known to be a
[56:31] conservative christian
[56:33] and so we question
[56:35] their margin
[56:36] of error
[56:42] facts
[56:44] presented by a christian have a greater
[56:46] margin of error
[56:50] now i think they probably have a smaller
[56:52] margin of error
[56:54] because you see they haven't viewed it
[56:56] as being right in their own eyes they've
[56:59] viewed it from how does this compare to
[57:01] the bible to the word of god
[57:05] so
[57:06] as this comes now we will see how that
[57:09] this is causing us
[57:11] as sons and daughters of god this margin
[57:14] of error that is there my brother and
[57:17] sister is now covered
[57:20] by something other than ourself
[57:23] are you with me
[57:25] now what is sin
[57:27] unbelief
[57:28] brother branham also puts it in this
[57:30] sense sadness coming short or falling
[57:32] short of the mark
[57:35] well i'll tell you what we probably
[57:36] could use this more as a as a um
[57:41] altar called type of approach my brother
[57:43] and sister but
[57:44] can we be honest with ourselves we have
[57:46] that margin of error that we fall short
[57:48] of the mark more often
[57:51] than we actually would like to admit
[57:54] we have a little attitude we have a
[57:56] little something or we just simply fall
[57:59] down as it were
[58:00] and we can say well i i fell short of
[58:02] the mark
[58:03] but you see the prophet of god says what
[58:05] you do is you just stand up again
[58:08] and say lord forgive me and you move on
[58:10] you change from the direction who
[58:13] preached that here in the church i i
[58:15] brother christian okay brother chris
[58:17] sorry i forgot who preached it but i've
[58:20] always the principle of it is stuck with
[58:22] me you're going a certain direction and
[58:24] you realize that you're wrong you don't
[58:27] melt down you don't fall down you don't
[58:29] give up you turn around and go a
[58:32] different direction amen so there is my
[58:35] brother and sister what the word is
[58:37] doing to you and i it is manifesting the
[58:41] testimony that was in the ark and the
[58:43] testimony in the ark could be summed up
[58:45] brother branham speaks about this in the
[58:47] seals book it's all about redemption
[58:51] it's not about creating a church a
[58:53] religion a following it's about
[58:56] redemption and so we understand then a
[59:00] portion as it would be to be expressed
[59:02] of the testimony in the ark is the story
[59:07] and the manifestation
[59:09] of redemption
[59:10] oh can i say thank you lord
[59:13] let that testimony be in me
[59:16] now i want to put it this way i hope you
[59:17] follow me
[59:19] our testimony
[59:21] is not really
[59:23] our testimony
[59:27] because if we would leave it my brother
[59:29] and sister
[59:32] hey just in case you said wait just a
[59:34] second now how can that be
[59:37] well i'm talking to the redeemed am i
[59:39] not
[59:41] so if you say i'm a sinner
[59:45] that's not your testimony
[59:48] because your name being on the lamb's
[59:49] book of life says you're redeemed
[59:52] and if we say we're redeemed but we have
[59:55] nothing to manifest that
[59:57] then we might not be you know telling
[59:59] the truth either
[1:00:01] but if we say thank you lord i'm a bible
[1:00:04] believing christian i'm filled with the
[1:00:05] holy ghost that really is not your
[1:00:08] testimony either because it's christ in
[1:00:10] you
[1:00:11] that is fulfilling that bringing you to
[1:00:14] be able to stand and live the life
[1:00:18] manifest the life
[1:00:20] that you live
[1:00:24] this might be a little direct
[1:00:26] so be it lord forgive me if it would
[1:00:27] offend anybody
[1:00:29] but oftentimes that's why the devil
[1:00:31] makes things so appealing and he draws
[1:00:33] our attention he draws our minds to
[1:00:35] other things because if we ever realize
[1:00:39] what our testimony really is my brother
[1:00:42] and sister then satan will have lost you
[1:00:44] forever but if he can keep us on the
[1:00:47] fence you know that's the thing if he
[1:00:49] can keep us on the fence now you know i
[1:00:52] had a friend one time he had a horse
[1:00:54] really good horse you could do anything
[1:00:55] on this horse you could cut cattle on
[1:00:56] this horse you could rope cattle on this
[1:00:58] horse it was a good mountain horse it
[1:01:00] was a good child's horse and it did
[1:01:02] everything but it had one bad habit
[1:01:05] it was always walking up
[1:01:07] and down the fence looking over the
[1:01:09] fence
[1:01:11] it literally had a trail this wide and
[1:01:14] that deep war
[1:01:15] at the fence
[1:01:18] and he said well i don't know what it is
[1:01:19] it's causing his attention to do that he
[1:01:21] says so i took and put him in the next
[1:01:24] pasture in the next paddock and now huh
[1:01:26] get this what devil's what the devil
[1:01:28] does
[1:01:29] so here is the horse walking up and down
[1:01:32] the fence looking on the other side
[1:01:33] always looking on the other side always
[1:01:35] looking the other side back and forth
[1:01:36] looking on this side and he thought i
[1:01:38] don't know what's over there and you
[1:01:39] know he put the horse in the next
[1:01:41] pasture paddock expecting the horse to
[1:01:43] go to the next fence and look over the
[1:01:45] fence because there must be something
[1:01:47] over he's looking to but what did the
[1:01:48] horse do he turned around right on this
[1:01:51] side of the fence and just walked up and
[1:01:53] down the fence looking back where he
[1:01:54] came from
[1:02:00] well is that not what the devil does
[1:02:04] we're looking to change our life the
[1:02:06] little song that was sung this this
[1:02:07] morning we're looking to change our life
[1:02:09] god changes our life what do we do we
[1:02:11] just get on the other side of the fence
[1:02:13] and we're looking back now it's where we
[1:02:14] came from
[1:02:20] help us lord
[1:02:21] hallelujah
[1:02:23] because some people wear a trench so
[1:02:25] deep or rut so deep they can't get out
[1:02:27] of it and god's doing the supernatural
[1:02:28] around them and all they can do is walk
[1:02:30] back and forth looking over the fence
[1:02:32] the scripture says be content where
[1:02:34] you're at be content with what you have
[1:02:38] unless of course you
[1:02:40] not saved and then you shouldn't be
[1:02:42] content there
[1:02:46] so our testimony is not really our
[1:02:48] testimony if we're led by the holy
[1:02:49] spirit
[1:02:51] then
[1:02:52] we become a witness
[1:02:55] now i hope you find how close these
[1:02:58] correspond with what was shared here in
[1:03:00] the book of john you see our testimony
[1:03:03] is not really our testimony if we're led
[1:03:05] of the spirit then our testimony is
[1:03:07] really just a testimony or witness
[1:03:10] of christ
[1:03:11] and jesus was saying this testimony i
[1:03:14] have here is not a testimony of me but
[1:03:16] it's a testimony of the one who sent me
[1:03:21] you see the man see we got to understand
[1:03:24] that balance of the godhead the man that
[1:03:26] was standing there
[1:03:28] was flesh and blood tempted and tried in
[1:03:31] every like manner as us
[1:03:36] he knew
[1:03:38] we get this idea that jesus christ was
[1:03:40] just here and he was the supernatural
[1:03:43] i'm telling you brothers
[1:03:45] we live in a wicked day
[1:03:48] i'm telling you sisters we live in a
[1:03:50] wicked day young people we live in a
[1:03:52] wicked day and jesus christ knew every
[1:03:55] emotion feeling impulse and input that
[1:03:58] was ever in your life he knew that
[1:04:06] come on let's get let's get him off the
[1:04:08] balconies of heaven
[1:04:10] get his feet right down in the dirt
[1:04:13] walking right through this world that we
[1:04:15] walked in
[1:04:21] you see it's then by the leadership of
[1:04:23] the holy spirit this is why my brother
[1:04:25] and sister we cannot be successful let's
[1:04:28] just talk about success how do we
[1:04:29] measure success
[1:04:32] you can measure it in a lot of ways
[1:04:38] you can be the man who's worth 10 15 20
[1:04:41] 50 million dollars working on his fourth
[1:04:43] marriage and doesn't even know his kids
[1:04:45] from the first one
[1:04:47] some people will look at him and say
[1:04:48] he's successful is he really
[1:04:52] or the other end of the spectrum you
[1:04:53] might find a man and a woman we know
[1:04:55] this testimony coming out of the back
[1:04:57] east a man and a woman in their whole
[1:04:59] life raising a family and literally
[1:05:01] their children have to support them in
[1:05:03] their old age because they have nothing
[1:05:05] but they have 10 children spouses and i
[1:05:09] forget how many grandchildren serving
[1:05:11] god
[1:05:12] these people over here going to look at
[1:05:14] him and say man he really messed up he
[1:05:16] wasn't much of a success
[1:05:18] really
[1:05:22] it all depends on how we want to measure
[1:05:24] success
[1:05:26] come on saints some would say well if
[1:05:28] your church is not growing and bursting
[1:05:30] at the seams you're not successful some
[1:05:33] would say my brother and sister just
[1:05:35] give us a little handful filled with the
[1:05:37] holy ghost and we're satisfied
[1:05:40] how do we measure success
[1:05:43] now i want to bring it closer to home
[1:05:46] how are you measuring success
[1:05:51] where's your parameter
[1:05:54] of what you'll call a successful life
[1:05:58] i think of the song that says
[1:06:00] take
[1:06:01] this whole world amen
[1:06:05] not half of it not a portion of it take
[1:06:07] this whole world but give me jesus
[1:06:10] oh man that'll be a successful man right
[1:06:12] there
[1:06:13] amen so you see
[1:06:15] my brother and sister it's by the
[1:06:16] leadership of the holy ghost that we
[1:06:18] then manifest the same testimony that
[1:06:21] was in the ark
[1:06:23] you see the testimony that was in the
[1:06:25] ark was not hidden from us in our
[1:06:26] generation because the scripture says
[1:06:29] that the mystery
[1:06:31] of jesus christ would be revealed
[1:06:34] in these last days
[1:06:36] the very mystery that was placed in the
[1:06:39] ark in that day will be revealed once
[1:06:43] again was it revealed in the form of
[1:06:45] religion
[1:06:47] no it was revealed in the form of life
[1:06:50] your life
[1:06:52] my life
[1:06:53] now as we look at this you go back and
[1:06:56] study the scripture i don't want to
[1:06:58] revisit it for the sake of time but as
[1:07:00] we read these scriptures you'll see that
[1:07:02] jesus is actually speaking to a
[1:07:04] religious people
[1:07:05] do you catch that out of the scripture
[1:07:07] he's speaking to a religious people he's
[1:07:10] not speaking to the the whoremongers and
[1:07:12] the bombs and whatever else out here
[1:07:14] he's speaking to the religious people
[1:07:17] and what is happening
[1:07:20] he's speaking of a pushback
[1:07:23] there's a pushback coming he's telling
[1:07:25] them look if you knew
[1:07:28] you would know
[1:07:29] what i'm speaking as truth if you really
[1:07:32] knew we'll touch on that in a minute
[1:07:33] elaborate if you really knew you would
[1:07:36] understand you would recognize but he's
[1:07:39] then telling them you never knew
[1:07:42] how that must have hurt in the religious
[1:07:43] realm
[1:07:48] what if brother paul was preaching today
[1:07:50] and
[1:07:51] told you
[1:07:52] you think you know the message of the
[1:07:54] hour
[1:07:57] that you've never known it
[1:08:01] would you all say oh
[1:08:04] he's just grumpy today
[1:08:08] jesus was serious
[1:08:10] he wasn't
[1:08:11] he wasn't
[1:08:14] being polite to them he was telling them
[1:08:16] the truth
[1:08:17] right so he's dealing with these
[1:08:19] religious people and they're giving him
[1:08:21] pushback but you see what's happening is
[1:08:24] the pushback that they're giving they're
[1:08:26] believing that they're doing god a
[1:08:28] service
[1:08:29] these people believe that this man
[1:08:31] standing in their midst must have been
[1:08:33] beelzebub he is not he claims it that uh
[1:08:37] he's the son of god and and uh we should
[1:08:40] stone him for that this man is just
[1:08:42] everything that is against what we
[1:08:44] believe because he he's a a heretic he's
[1:08:47] a deceiver
[1:08:51] and they were doing that all in the name
[1:08:52] of believing
[1:08:55] that they were supporting the word of
[1:08:56] god
[1:09:02] now
[1:09:04] you think these spirits ever change
[1:09:08] also i've heard this i have let me i got
[1:09:10] it wrong somewhere here let's see the
[1:09:12] rapture
[1:09:13] is this true it's a question or should
[1:09:15] we sell our homes
[1:09:18] or did you ever say this no i never said
[1:09:21] this people are wanting to know did you
[1:09:23] tell us to sell and move to some spot
[1:09:29] i don't know if it's in this quote or
[1:09:30] another one
[1:09:33] he says i never proselyted anyone
[1:09:37] to move anywhere
[1:09:39] it's not
[1:09:40] my business
[1:09:44] imagine that
[1:09:51] i just had a wise crack but i'll keep it
[1:09:53] to myself
[1:09:56] no i never said it i never i've always
[1:09:58] advised people to stay where you are and
[1:10:00] keep on keeping on until jesus comes
[1:10:02] isn't that good advice
[1:10:04] amen to find a liberty to pray through
[1:10:06] yourself and know this is where god
[1:10:08] wants me to be or i need to move here or
[1:10:11] whatever
[1:10:12] if i've told you many time let this tape
[1:10:14] immemorial let this day be a memorial
[1:10:16] let my word be a memorial oh here we go
[1:10:18] i have never at one time ever told
[1:10:21] anybody ever proselyted ever tried to
[1:10:24] get somebody to come to this church
[1:10:34] imagine that
[1:10:36] the people could come with the liberty
[1:10:39] saints that have moved here
[1:10:42] you know what it's like
[1:10:44] to have someone say oh you've got to
[1:10:46] come here you've got to be part of our
[1:10:48] church our church is the best we've got
[1:10:49] all the answers we've got this and this
[1:10:51] and then you go
[1:10:53] and then just everything
[1:10:56] pardon me i don't normally like to use
[1:10:58] this language but all hell breaks loose
[1:11:02] and then you know what happens
[1:11:04] the preacher
[1:11:06] a pastor told me to move here
[1:11:12] i've seen it over and over again saints
[1:11:13] i've i've had many a person bring this
[1:11:16] up to me
[1:11:18] and and we never found uh you know
[1:11:20] anything
[1:11:21] never settled down in our life till we
[1:11:24] prayed through on this and we ended up
[1:11:26] moving again and people then are like oh
[1:11:27] they're double-minded but you see what
[1:11:29] they were doing is following somebody's
[1:11:31] mind not the mind of christ
[1:11:34] so brother brown says here no i never
[1:11:35] prosper i'd ever tried to get somebody
[1:11:37] to come to this church i've never as far
[1:11:39] as telling them to leave their own
[1:11:40] church and sell out their goods and
[1:11:42] things god knows that i've always
[1:11:44] advised people to remain a christian and
[1:11:46] stay where you are until god calls you
[1:11:50] oh boy hallelujah
[1:11:52] i can remember i'll just leave this very
[1:11:54] big but i can remember years ago being
[1:11:56] given advice that i should tell the
[1:11:58] little group here which it was only
[1:12:00] about i don't know 15 or 16 of us at the
[1:12:02] time and being told you know what you
[1:12:04] need to get up paul have the courage and
[1:12:06] tell them to quit their jobs sell their
[1:12:08] houses and move to our church
[1:12:11] well praise the lord i'm glad i didn't
[1:12:13] listen
[1:12:19] can you see these words to remain a
[1:12:24] christian
[1:12:26] who is the leadership
[1:12:28] of a christian
[1:12:30] the holy ghost
[1:12:32] jesus christ himself
[1:12:36] well i want to go over there i want to
[1:12:38] live over you go wherever you want to go
[1:12:40] that's all right i don't care where you
[1:12:42] go that's not my business for that
[1:12:46] that actually wasn't the quote i was
[1:12:47] really bringing but it was lovely
[1:12:50] because
[1:12:51] i can just share that
[1:12:52] you go where you want to go
[1:12:54] you go oh i do want to put one caveat
[1:12:58] you go
[1:12:59] where you have prayed through
[1:13:01] and god told you go
[1:13:05] don't just go
[1:13:06] for whatever reason
[1:13:09] reminds me of a brother i'll just throw
[1:13:10] this out reminds me of a brother moved
[1:13:12] halfway across the united states because
[1:13:14] there was a message church and this
[1:13:15] great job man i just two and a half
[1:13:17] times my income oh praise the lord we
[1:13:20] got church too he goes there the company
[1:13:22] goes bankrupt he's now unemployed
[1:13:31] he says worst mistake i ever made in my
[1:13:32] life
[1:13:34] i don't know what prompted me to say
[1:13:36] this to him i says well brother if
[1:13:37] that's the worst mistake you ever made
[1:13:38] in your life
[1:13:40] what was the second worst
[1:13:45] uh we won't go into that amen
[1:13:49] but you see you know
[1:13:51] you know they usually say that trouble
[1:13:53] travels in threes
[1:13:55] so i just naturally my curiosity was
[1:13:58] like i wonder what the other two
[1:14:01] and when i asked him what the next one
[1:14:03] was he looked at me and basically um
[1:14:07] well anyway let's we'll just
[1:14:09] let's leave that
[1:14:11] but now to think that see what does it
[1:14:14] it starts a cult
[1:14:15] and then i get in trouble they got a
[1:14:17] group out here now that's going to be on
[1:14:19] charity pretty soon
[1:14:21] in case if you guys are trying to figure
[1:14:23] this out there were people that had
[1:14:25] picked a specific spot and said this is
[1:14:28] where the rapture is going to take place
[1:14:30] this is where it's going to happen right
[1:14:32] here you all need to come to our little
[1:14:35] spot
[1:14:36] oh come on just say it paul
[1:14:38] brother brown's talking about sierra
[1:14:40] vista arizona
[1:14:42] said his biggest mistake they ever made
[1:14:45] wow
[1:14:49] lord forgive me
[1:14:50] but it's on tape i'm not saying anything
[1:14:53] new
[1:14:53] uh it's going to be on charity pretty
[1:14:55] soon and then what's it going to be we
[1:14:57] come out here for the rapture of the
[1:14:59] bride that's just what the newspapers
[1:15:01] are waiting for they're waiting to get
[1:15:03] it when they fall on charity and can't
[1:15:05] go back to their homes that's then what
[1:15:07] are they going to do well we followed
[1:15:10] brother branham out here supposed to be
[1:15:13] and i'm just as innocent of it as i can
[1:15:15] be the dear sweet people they know that
[1:15:18] i love them and even in their air they
[1:15:21] why
[1:15:22] i love them anyhow see i love them
[1:15:24] they're my children but they just
[1:15:28] won't
[1:15:29] listen to me
[1:15:32] is that what they're saying
[1:15:36] no
[1:15:37] they're saying
[1:15:39] he told us to come here
[1:15:42] he told us to do this he told us to do
[1:15:44] that
[1:15:47] but they won't listen to me when i'm
[1:15:49] trying to tell them i'm trying to work
[1:15:52] out something in the name of the lord
[1:15:54] and they won't let me do it see they're
[1:15:56] actually
[1:15:57] now we're talking about pushback
[1:16:00] they're actually going against me
[1:16:02] instead of
[1:16:04] for
[1:16:04] me see this is what jesus was
[1:16:07] experienced these were religious people
[1:16:08] they knew there was a messiah coming
[1:16:10] they knew there was a season and they
[1:16:12] were looking for the messiah and he's
[1:16:14] right in the midst trying to perform the
[1:16:16] word and they are pushing back
[1:16:21] because what they hear what they see
[1:16:23] what they understand what they interpret
[1:16:25] didn't fit
[1:16:27] but it made sense
[1:16:29] to them
[1:16:33] oh lord help us
[1:16:35] see in jesus day they were trying so
[1:16:37] hard to do something for god
[1:16:40] failed to recognize god was standing
[1:16:42] right in their midst
[1:16:44] while they're trying to do something for
[1:16:46] god
[1:16:46] in our day my brother and sister are
[1:16:48] trying to do something for god
[1:16:50] but in reality
[1:16:52] actually pushing
[1:16:54] against it
[1:16:58] that's why satan doesn't
[1:17:00] have to get us out saints
[1:17:02] dancing drinking
[1:17:05] misbehaving on the streets
[1:17:07] just has to get us in a position where
[1:17:08] our interpretation
[1:17:10] of the word for our day has us actually
[1:17:13] pushing against what god is doing see
[1:17:16] how slippery satan is
[1:17:18] he brings us to a place that we're
[1:17:19] actually doing his work for him
[1:17:23] he just gets to sit back under the
[1:17:25] umbrella and drink lemonade
[1:17:29] and we're out there just laboring away
[1:17:31] i hope that's not you
[1:17:40] oh forgive me saints
[1:17:42] forgive me saints
[1:17:45] can anybody say with me that's not me
[1:17:49] that's not me amen
[1:17:52] now jesus says here in verse 41 he says
[1:17:54] i receive not honor for men going back
[1:17:56] in the scripture and that's fine we
[1:17:57] don't have to go back there but i know
[1:17:59] you have not the love of god in you i
[1:18:01] come in my father's name and you receive
[1:18:03] me not if another shall come in his own
[1:18:06] name him you will receive
[1:18:09] now this is very interesting because you
[1:18:11] see my brother and sister we know
[1:18:13] that god is the word right
[1:18:15] and the word is god so now they he comes
[1:18:18] jesus speaking this says i come in my
[1:18:20] father's name in other words i come in
[1:18:22] the representation
[1:18:23] of god almighty jehovah
[1:18:26] and i come in that and you won't receive
[1:18:28] me but there's others in your midst that
[1:18:31] have come and they have their own
[1:18:33] interpretation they have their own thing
[1:18:35] and they're speaking their
[1:18:36] interpretation of the word and you
[1:18:38] receive them you bring them in and you
[1:18:40] lift them up and you give them place and
[1:18:42] and it's doing and jesus is actually is
[1:18:44] that not the same spirit of our day
[1:18:46] amen we've gone to all of these things
[1:18:48] my brother and sister and if it don't
[1:18:49] work out right we always have a reason
[1:18:51] reminds me of a time many years ago i
[1:18:53] won't even name the state i don't want
[1:18:54] to to come back and roost somewhere home
[1:18:57] not on us but somewhere else but you
[1:18:59] know there was somebody and and they had
[1:19:01] uh um they had
[1:19:03] left their wife
[1:19:05] married a younger woman
[1:19:06] hey have you ever noticed that when
[1:19:08] these guys leave their wives they never
[1:19:09] go out if they're say 50 years old they
[1:19:11] never go out and find a 75 year old
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:15] doesn't happen
[1:19:18] it's always
[1:19:20] if i could put it this way the young
[1:19:22] sister
[1:19:23] who was taught to idolize
[1:19:28] or pastor
[1:19:31] the reason i don't see him do anything
[1:19:33] wrong is because i'm just staring in the
[1:19:35] stars
[1:19:36] he's so wonderful
[1:19:39] and now
[1:19:41] well i mean come on saints
[1:19:43] maybe we should have the recording shut
[1:19:44] off but
[1:19:46] you know
[1:19:48] when you got a wife that gets up in the
[1:19:49] morning and goes
[1:19:51] oh
[1:19:52] my goodness
[1:19:55] ah
[1:19:57] okay give me 15 minutes i'll be able to
[1:19:59] make it to the kitchen cook you
[1:20:00] breakfast
[1:20:06] i think you get the point
[1:20:09] no they're not like oh
[1:20:11] she's 75 and beautiful and has a
[1:20:14] wonderful pension
[1:20:17] no i'm sorry they could care less about
[1:20:19] the money
[1:20:20] they're caught up in the pride of life
[1:20:22] and the lust of the flesh
[1:20:25] so this preacher he
[1:20:28] he gets rid of his wife
[1:20:30] marries a young woman
[1:20:33] a lot of things go on
[1:20:36] one day
[1:20:37] the spirit of the lord falls upon them
[1:20:39] and they prophesy the rapture's taking
[1:20:41] place
[1:20:43] on this
[1:20:44] day in this place
[1:20:49] and it's invitation
[1:20:51] only
[1:20:54] and people just clamored
[1:20:56] for the invitation
[1:20:58] but did you know that when the sun rose
[1:21:00] on that mountaintop
[1:21:03] on that day
[1:21:05] god didn't come
[1:21:10] was it false prophecy
[1:21:13] no sir
[1:21:14] it's because
[1:21:16] in the vision
[1:21:17] this man over here
[1:21:19] and his wife
[1:21:21] and his children
[1:21:23] were in the rapture
[1:21:24] and they didn't come to the mountaintop
[1:21:27] so god had the council
[1:21:30] the rapture
[1:21:33] it's not false prophecy
[1:21:36] it's their fault
[1:21:40] you know that brother you know what he
[1:21:42] said
[1:21:43] he said when i heard that prophecy he
[1:21:45] was a regular attendee of that church
[1:21:47] until that point right there he said
[1:21:48] when i heard that prophecy a voice spoke
[1:21:50] to me and said take it back to the word
[1:21:54] and he sat down around the table him his
[1:21:56] wife and his teenage children and they
[1:21:58] went through this scripture line by line
[1:22:00] and said this does not fit we're not
[1:22:03] going
[1:22:05] and so the whole rapture was cancelled
[1:22:07] because of them
[1:22:09] you see my brother and sister how these
[1:22:10] spirits work
[1:22:15] when a man would say i come in my
[1:22:16] father's name
[1:22:19] won't receive him at all but someone
[1:22:20] else comes
[1:22:22] now something more exciting who doesn't
[1:22:24] want to go in the rapture
[1:22:26] i want to go i say according to
[1:22:28] revelations lord come quickly
[1:22:31] come quickly before these insane people
[1:22:33] destroy everything around us
[1:22:46] verse 44 says how can you believe which
[1:22:48] receive honor one of another
[1:22:52] saint you ever wonder why paul always
[1:22:53] says do not say this is paul's church do
[1:22:55] not say this is paul's church do not say
[1:22:57] this is paul's church because this is
[1:23:00] not paul's church
[1:23:01] paul might keel over tomorrow
[1:23:04] my it's a talk about an awakening
[1:23:07] a a guy went to school with
[1:23:09] just the other day heart attack dead
[1:23:11] just like that one minute he's talking
[1:23:13] to somebody next minute he's dead
[1:23:17] scary my age
[1:23:28] how can you believe which receive honor
[1:23:30] one of another
[1:23:32] and seek not the honor that cometh from
[1:23:34] god only
[1:23:35] you see saints this is a reason we're
[1:23:37] not looking for this great brother to
[1:23:39] this great sister this great family this
[1:23:41] great church we're looking to christ
[1:23:44] that's what we're holding up and we're
[1:23:46] drawing night unto him and he said when
[1:23:48] you draw an iron to me i'll draw an i
[1:23:51] unto you well i'll tell you the higher
[1:23:53] you lift men the harder it is to get to
[1:23:55] them
[1:23:57] so you're not going to be in their
[1:23:58] fellowship anyway you lift them up on
[1:24:00] that pedestal and then and then you're
[1:24:02] gonna find it's just gonna be really
[1:24:03] hard to even get a phone call out of
[1:24:05] them
[1:24:06] well you're the one that's lifting them
[1:24:08] up sending them all your money and
[1:24:09] giving all the adoration no brothers and
[1:24:11] sisters that's not what god wants
[1:24:13] god wants us to look to him and him
[1:24:14] alone amen do not think that i will
[1:24:17] accuse you to the father
[1:24:19] there is one that accuses you
[1:24:26] brother alex go ahead and please put
[1:24:28] verse
[1:24:28] 43 4 5
[1:24:30] 6 7 back up
[1:24:32] because i'm going to go ahead and just
[1:24:33] make a statement i was praying about it
[1:24:35] i wondered about it i was like hesitant
[1:24:36] to do it but i'm just going to have to
[1:24:39] say it i'm sorry
[1:24:48] come in my father's name you receive me
[1:24:50] not another shall come in his own name
[1:24:52] him will you receive how can you believe
[1:24:54] which receive honor one of another seek
[1:24:57] not honor that cometh from god only amen
[1:24:59] yeah let's move forward a little bit
[1:25:01] sorry maybe i quoted you wrong once
[1:25:04] do not think that i will accuse you to
[1:25:05] the father there is one that accuses you
[1:25:08] even your
[1:25:10] prophet to your
[1:25:13] age
[1:25:17] hello
[1:25:19] in whom you trust
[1:25:25] in whom you trust
[1:25:27] we've put our life
[1:25:29] on this gospel
[1:25:35] but the very things it's preached
[1:25:39] is what's judging them
[1:25:41] oh don't think it's the preacher saints
[1:25:43] i would never judge you
[1:25:45] i would not judge you i don't i don't
[1:25:47] have it in my heart i don't have the
[1:25:48] courage but you see my brother and
[1:25:50] sister it's coming to the place and it's
[1:25:52] coming to the time that the very things
[1:25:55] i made this statement to the church some
[1:25:56] time back the reason that people think
[1:25:59] that the preacher is judging them is
[1:26:01] because they refuse to judge themselves
[1:26:05] they refuse to go into the word and when
[1:26:08] the word says it they refuse to respond
[1:26:11] to it and say i'm going to back up i'm
[1:26:13] going to repent i'm going to do
[1:26:14] different i'm going to turn around and
[1:26:15] go different direction they refuse to do
[1:26:17] that so he's telling them you think i'm
[1:26:20] accusing you to the father but there's
[1:26:22] one that accusing you it's even your
[1:26:23] prophet
[1:26:24] that you believe
[1:26:26] for had you believed moses
[1:26:32] do i have to go ahead and say it so that
[1:26:33] it will be plain enough probably should
[1:26:37] if you had believed the message of the
[1:26:39] hour
[1:26:42] you would believe these things
[1:26:44] because what was he doing he was writing
[1:26:47] of jesus christ
[1:26:49] if we had believed the message of the
[1:26:52] hour
[1:26:53] we wouldn't be arguing
[1:26:55] whether he meant that or not
[1:27:00] we had looked at the word and says
[1:27:02] yes he says this yes it fits the word
[1:27:07] it applies to me
[1:27:10] but if you believe not his writings
[1:27:13] how shall ye believe
[1:27:14] the word made manifest walking
[1:27:18] in your
[1:27:19] midst
[1:27:23] can't even believe the writing
[1:27:26] oh come on saints
[1:27:29] they don't believe it in their midst
[1:27:31] because they're reading the writing
[1:27:32] through their own understanding their
[1:27:34] own interpretation don't lean to your
[1:27:37] own understanding pray through on these
[1:27:39] things pick up your bible pray through
[1:27:42] on what you read pick up your message
[1:27:44] read pray through on that
[1:27:46] because my brother and sister they can
[1:27:48] come up with an entirely different
[1:27:49] conclusion and they didn't believe the
[1:27:51] very manifested word that moses was
[1:27:54] speaking about standing in their midst
[1:27:57] because they did not have any revelation
[1:27:59] of what he actually wrote
[1:28:02] they brought it down and created their
[1:28:03] own new church
[1:28:06] hallelujah
[1:28:16] i think verse 43 is
[1:28:18] coming to pass again
[1:28:20] i really do i think it's present in our
[1:28:22] day go ahead brother alex let's let's go
[1:28:24] back
[1:28:26] i'm come in my father's name and you
[1:28:28] receive me not
[1:28:29] if another shall come in his own name
[1:28:31] him you will
[1:28:33] receive
[1:28:35] i think it's coming to pass all over
[1:28:36] again
[1:28:38] we've got a whole nether generation a
[1:28:40] whole other group of people
[1:28:48] i don't want you all leaving with bitter
[1:28:50] taste in your mouth this morning but
[1:28:58] i don't encourage actually him do the
[1:29:00] research
[1:29:03] i'll just put it this way
[1:29:07] every continent
[1:29:09] on earth today
[1:29:13] has a man who has risen up
[1:29:16] declaring he has a new word
[1:29:19] from the lord
[1:29:23] now the new word from the lord
[1:29:26] doesn't fit the old word from the lord
[1:29:30] because it's the new word
[1:29:34] and you're supposed to by the idea that
[1:29:36] the new word
[1:29:38] supersedes the old word
[1:29:41] because this is new revelation
[1:29:45] but the old word says
[1:29:48] if they come preaching
[1:29:51] any either
[1:29:52] major deviation
[1:29:56] is that what it says
[1:29:58] if they come preaching a major deviation
[1:30:00] don't believe them
[1:30:02] no sir
[1:30:03] it says if they come preaching
[1:30:05] one
[1:30:06] word
[1:30:07] differently
[1:30:12] you know why y'all having so many
[1:30:13] troubles right now
[1:30:15] oh you didn't know i knew you was having
[1:30:16] troubles did you
[1:30:19] you guys didn't know i visited your
[1:30:21] house last time and your lamp up there
[1:30:23] has that little dot that you didn't
[1:30:24] remember being there before it's just a
[1:30:26] microphone
[1:30:27] i wouldn't worry about it don't go home
[1:30:29] and tear it down
[1:30:32] no that sounds weird and sick and
[1:30:35] perverted and
[1:30:37] because we don't need that
[1:30:40] you know why i know that you're having
[1:30:41] troubles the devil's stirring up your
[1:30:43] house stirring up you
[1:30:45] because we are so close to the end
[1:30:48] we are so so so so close
[1:30:53] to the end
[1:30:55] and satan is running around doing
[1:30:58] everything within his power you say i i
[1:31:01] think oh brother paul i i just some days
[1:31:03] i just feel so some bombarded i just
[1:31:06] feel like i'm backslid just hold on
[1:31:11] that's what it feels like
[1:31:13] to have all hell
[1:31:17] turnless against you
[1:31:20] but you're still standing
[1:31:22] you're still overcoming
[1:31:24] you're still repenting you're still
[1:31:26] praising god you're still praying you're
[1:31:28] still reading your bible
[1:31:30] you're still getting up in the morning
[1:31:32] saying lord yesterday was just didn't go
[1:31:34] so well but today i'm trusting you lord
[1:31:37] and the devil's like wait i turned
[1:31:40] everything i got against them
[1:31:43] how can they still be standing
[1:31:46] so don't think brother paul had some
[1:31:47] special
[1:31:49] discernment
[1:31:52] i just happen to know that all hell has
[1:31:54] been turned loose against you because
[1:31:57] he's looking and he's seeing the same
[1:31:59] clock saints that is ticking down time
[1:32:02] right
[1:32:03] man one minute 30 seconds whatever it
[1:32:06] might be to midnight the same clock that
[1:32:09] is ticking down time for the believer is
[1:32:12] ticking down time for the demise
[1:32:15] of lucifer and his followers
[1:32:19] he can read the same clock he might even
[1:32:21] be able to read it a little bit better
[1:32:22] than we do
[1:32:24] and he's recognizing if i can't get him
[1:32:26] now
[1:32:27] i'll never get him i've got to i've got
[1:32:29] to do something i've got to stop him
[1:32:31] i've got to just come in like a flood
[1:32:33] but he forgot to read the word with
[1:32:35] understanding with the discernment of
[1:32:37] the holy spirit to realize no matter
[1:32:39] what he pours in the flood my brother
[1:32:41] and sister the standard has already been
[1:32:44] raised up and we will endure we will
[1:32:49] overcome we will stand triumphant
[1:32:52] because god said that i've already
[1:32:54] provided a way for you and the work i
[1:32:56] have begun in you i will finish
[1:33:00] oh hallelujah that ought to make a heart
[1:33:03] rejoice i want to make a heart repent if
[1:33:05] it's not right with god ought to make us
[1:33:08] say lord i felt like it was me i felt
[1:33:11] like i was the failure i felt like i had
[1:33:14] come short i didn't recognize that was
[1:33:17] what all hell felt like
[1:33:21] well praise the lord don't get
[1:33:22] comfortable with that
[1:33:24] don't get comfortable with that
[1:33:26] because you see the demons
[1:33:28] that are over here trying to destroy you
[1:33:31] are crying out for help
[1:33:33] and once they've destroyed someone up
[1:33:34] there'll be some more show up here
[1:33:37] and they'll want to come but don't worry
[1:33:39] about it
[1:33:40] you ever watch the standard raising
[1:33:43] i'll tell you i just speak my own life
[1:33:44] saints things i thought was just fine 15
[1:33:47] 20 years ago
[1:33:49] i'd cry out to the lord forgive me lord
[1:33:50] for doing it today back then i did it
