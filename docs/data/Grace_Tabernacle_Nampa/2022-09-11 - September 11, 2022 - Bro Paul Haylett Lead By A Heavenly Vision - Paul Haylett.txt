morning man I had no idea what sister Jerry was going to sing for a song this morning but I believe it fits perfectly the whole thought of what we're going to speak this morning the things that we do amen I want to start with just a couple quick things here we want to uh remind everyone that this coming Wednesday Lord willing brother Marcus Becker will be here and uh would love to have had him for more time but I'm glad that the Lord had that spot in the schedule for us that we could have a little time together as a church with him we also have a brother and sister that is coming from the Ukraine I think to arrive here in earlier mid part of this coming week and you know I struggle with names but um anyway we just pray Lord would just be with our brother and sister give them traveling Mercies now Saints there's things in life that we don't understand challenges trials and tests and um I received in the last couple days a lovely email from our sister Andrea Grant and uh I really don't have to say this I don't want to start bawling but you know she's faced quite a challenge in the with her health and her body the last years and she just shared this lovely email uh and what was beautiful to me about it it wasn't so much about the condition that she's facing right now was the confession that she's actually making about that it's not so much as Satan's trying to put cancer back in my body as it was the quite lengthy sharing of scripture quotes and thoughts of declaring that of no other position but to declare that I'm healed amen I have no other position to declare my gods in control I have no other position and she shared quotes and and quotes about John Ryan and about those sisters that were in the line and they went home and got sicker but on the morning that that sister felt the coolness go through her body and she went to tell her neighbor and she gets to the neighbor's house and the neighbor is running around the house shouting Hallelujah to realize oh amen the Holy Ghost the healing presence of God had come through the neighborhood and our sister Andrea said I will be amen I will be found praising God when he comes to me amen amen but the doctor says the devil wants us to believe but it's beautiful to see someone say I don't care I don't care my God's in control amen I'm going to believe what the word says about me amen so he's trying to get uh to to come back and assault our sister and um but she has said I'm going to stand in faith I'm not going to waver I'm going to stand in faith and she declared I'm believing I'm Healed amen now my brother and sister the prophet of God shows us scripture shows us the prophet of God elaborates on this that that's the only position we can take we can't say well I don't know this and this and this and this and maybe if God chooses to heal me no wrong position we are healed in the name of Jesus Christ my I I just had a couple scriptures I wanted to share and so she's confessing she's healed she's confessing that she's standing with the word of God and for the word of God and I say this morning if you would join together with me we're going to confess with our sister that she is healed in the name of Jesus Christ that the power of God is greater right he that is within you is greater than he that is in the world and will stand here and we'll take God's position every time Lord help us to take your position every time amen hallelujah now Isaiah 53 and 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities you see my brother and sister I want to just interject this what the Lord was doing speaking through the prophet Isaiah was all about you and I am God didn't say there might be but he was speaking to the believer and that word is just a solid people it's Old Testament it's New Testament it's God's word amen he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed can we say thank you Lord we give praise to you today Lord and say thank you from the depths of our hearts because your word says that by the stripes that were laid on you that we are healed and there's never been a scripture to take that away Hallelujah first Peter the second chapter verses 24 and 25. who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes you were healed amen amen I say it's a finished work we believe it my brother and sister and as we think of our sister Andrea we claim this just recently within the church of the body of Believers I mean we have our sister Elizabeth Murphy we want to lift her up Satan trying to destroy her we also see our sister Erica Parker who for years has struggled with all these things related to her liver do you have a need today amen amen where it's appropriate lay your hand upon your neighbor and let's go in faith before the Lord today I'm Desiring my brother and sister to see Satan actually heed the no trespassing sign of God's word Heavenly Father Lord we just come together today Lord we just ask you father as we just lift these needs up Lord is I read that Lord late last night I already had this thought already these things were laid out father and to say Lord how the testimony of our sister her Declaration of where she stands father to me father today it would be as though I could preach this sermon with the inspiration from our sister Andreas email but Lord you chose to give the inspiration for the word and then allow me to read that oh Father to be Lord in your mind to be in one Accord with you Lord to be able to stand and say my God is an awesome God this special song this morning songs of brother Jason brought for us to sing this morning Lord Jesus just testifies to me over and over again my God is in control my God is in control of all things Lord and regardless of what it looks like on the outside regardless of what circumstance may be coming an afflicting but lord it's not about our circumstance Lord Jesus it's about you and your word and we claim that word and we confess that word we believe that word and Lord we will stand upon that word today now Lord with our hands lifted up Lord our hearts lifted up father we claim healing for our sister Andrea ask you to come on the scene Lord that thy perfect will be done Lord our sister Elizabeth Lord our sister Erica and whatever needs Lord that there might be in this body and the body of Christ Lord we lift them before you father and no matter what kind of smoke screen that Satan might present Lord we're going to stand fast upon the word because you are our healer you are our savior you are our provider and we will testify that to our our last breath Lord now father we ask you to move and thy perfect will be done in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah God bless you Saints I want to speak to you today once again on the title or overall thought of our position of strength and you know it might not seem like sometimes these things were preaching on are really a position of strength but you see when the word is laid the foundation is laid in our soul then God can build upon that and so sometimes God builds then he has to stop and he has to then as it were tie in the rebar and you know when you build a big building you don't just build a building and then add everything after the fact but sometimes in the building of a large building and that's what you are because you have been built big enough to house the Holy Ghost I'm telling you you're not some little minuscule thing over here on the side to be pushed into the gutter but you are great big as it were mentioned amen the New Jerusalem my brother and sister some people are looking and God do what he wants to do but some people are looking as the building the New Jerusalem realize the New Jerusalem is Christ and his pride together that's the New Jerusalem God's not in buildings my brother and sister God chooses to inhabit buildings and he makes them sacred places but my brother and sister God's not into real estate amen but he is into you and I Hallelujah oh my let's just go here I want to speak to you this morning led by heavenly vision amen I like that brother Joss by being a small leadership important thing how we're LED well my brother and sister that's what's important we can be led by man we can be led by politics which is in essence man with the spirit on him you realize that's what all politicians are just men with spirits on them but we're not here to talk about the devil this morning so anyway look at this now as we stand here led by heavenly vision let's just go into the word my familiar scripture is it not yes I tell you what my brother and sister very familiar scripture because you see I can say today I don't mean to keep you standing but I'm happy to say today that we are not confined by the world we live in if we don't watch what Satan's doing he will try to build a laodicean hedge around you and I where all we see is the world now not that we'd be worldly but all we would see is the world we'd see the confusion in the land have you ever seen America so rampantly run by confusion I'm not a very bright guy and I don't say that to demean myself but in the whole picture I'm not a very smart guy but I know you can't print more money and get rich and I can't I can't declare that destroying the infrastructure of a Nation that's recorded right in Scripture destroy that and we'll be a better people and the wars and the rumors of wars troubles in the land our heart goes out those Saints have nothing to do with politics and the spirits of the age but once again we're seeing an offensive Ukraine Russia fighting destruction just coming everywhere you know the devil's rejoicing but you know who's rejoicing more than the devil the bride of Christ amen because we're seeing the word of God come to pass and if you read the emails in the texts and and those things that are shared coming from the Believers talking about everything we have has been destroyed praise God that takes something more than just humans not take something that is Supernatural because they're seeing a shifting they're seeing a moving they're seeing scripture being fulfilled they're rejoicing in that even though everything that they own in life has been taken from them that would be nothing short of God stress and strain on the mind the greatest battle as the prophet said I just did some reading in the early hours following this thought year over year mental instability is what some of them politically want to call it has been increasing not exponential my brother and sister it didn't go from nothing to 50 or something like that but just a steady increase some research says that the reason of this is a lack of Hope aren't you glad our hope it's been Anchored In Jesus Christ it's not anchored in the world we live in but see we're not exempt from those things we can have as it were things in our life chemical imbalances hormones all these kind of things but you see we've been given a place to let off the pressure we've been given a place that we can come and say you know what I'm stressed I feel we don't like to use words like this but I feel depressed or I feel discouraged or I feel distressed and if you notice what happens then God comes right in something comes and that is gone and we're able to grasp beholds I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God and this world is not my home oh Hallelujah Hebrews 11. we'll start with the verse 13. these all died in faith not having received the promises but have seen them afar off now my brother and sister that's actually very encouraging because you see these people didn't pass from this Earth saying we never saw a promise but they saw them even though the Fulfillment now my brother and sister I want you to catch this hopefully I don't keep you standing until you'll pass out but I want you to understand having seen them afar off is not that it took not did not take place in their life but they're looking to the Fulfillment of that promise so there was attributes and things of the promise that come out in their life it come out in their day-to-day life but the Fulfillment or the maturity of that promise was still out in front of them okay you understand me amen so it's there they were persuaded of them and embrace them and confess this is what oh my brother and sister I hope it'll get emotional this morning but this is what struck my heart in relation of sister Andrea's email mail to me and what I was studying what I already had recorded in my notes is the fact that it you're persuaded and you've embraced it and then you believe it so much you confess it oh it's one thing to have something anchored down in the heart but it's another thing by brother and sister to believe something so strongly that you will step out against all thought all opinion all circumstance and say I believe this oh Hallelujah amen they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they had came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is a Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God isn't that a position my brother and sister they said many many Mighty Men come in that day and said didn't we do many mighty works in your name and he says depart from me but to be my brother and sister that we have come that God is happy to be called our God oh Hallelujah for he has prepared for them City Heavenly Father we ask you this bless the service today Lord just father anoint us Lord just to speak your word amen anoint Hearts to receive father oh Father we thank you we thank you for the life we thank you for the work that you're doing we just ask you to come and Lord open our Horizons as it were open our our hearts let us be so hungry let our thoughts be on you father we ask for this guidance in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints I hope you all don't mind I get a little excited today amen just this has been such a beautiful thought now remember the Saints of the ages they were living to the very moment my brother and sister as their lives either were taken from them or they'd live the Fulfillment of their life and they lived to the very moment still believing they were still persuaded they were still embracing the promise and confessing the promise and I say Lord let us be in that position in our life let it never come a time that we would look back and say I once was on fire for God but may we get up every morning of every day of our lives and say Lord I Thank you for what you have done you've poured that fire that life in me and Lord I thank you for that because you see my brother and sister the fire waivers the flame waivers for lack of food and you'll find that Satan comes and what is the first thing you try to do he takes us away from praying he takes us from reading our Bible he takes us from fellowshipping this is why true Godly Fellowship is important not Fellowship where we get together and talk about all kinds of nonsense but a fellowship that we come together what are we doing we're feeding one another's flame and God called us by the word to come and be a helper in Feeding of the flame and so I pray that God would just anoint each one of us oh Lord not to gossam not to speak ill not to speak of vain things but to come feed the flame of the Holy Ghost in each other's lives amen so it was there look at these Saints of old my brother and sister they come from the rich and they come from the poor and every class of life in between and something happened to them and it was a change in the Dynamics of their life now we we read you know when brother Branham was talking about mechanics and Dynamics my brother and sister it's one thing to how of the body as it were the car it's there it's got wheels it's got everything that's necessary might even have a functioning battery the windows will go up and down this stereo work the lights will turn on but if you can't get it to move and that's the problem we're seeing in the day that we live in is there's not enough dynamic in the church to get it to move from its position to another position but I'll tell you what God has come down he's put the mechanics the Dynamics that power of the Holy Ghost and it's there my brother and sister that it's there that we no longer want to stay where we were it's not a matter of ministry coming and saying oh church you've got to move forward you've got to move forward you need to move out of this no my brother and sister it's a body of Believers anointed by the very Life of Christ that say I want to move I want to change my position I want to change the dynamic of my life oh people are waiting for something to move them but it should be right there if we're feeding it it will come to life it will move us amen because I'm telling you right now this flesh likes this flesh and this flesh likes this flesh enough this flesh will convince this flesh not to move God sent a prophet that's good God sent a prophet but did the word that came through him spark something in US did it bring something to life that we would say praise the Lord I'm going to get up this morning and take another step closer I'm going to get up this morning and I'm going to let this old flesh die just a little bit more and we say oh brother Paul don't seem like I'm making progress well I'm telling you God knows what you're doing and God knows what he's doing in you and so just leave it let the Lord amen let the Lord do the work every work that man has ever done all through scripture God had to go back and fix it that's right amen what happened their focus changed I'll share a little story with you about Focus I was once told this story by minister in Africa they took a minister on a great field trip and I've been sister Jerry and I've been on one of these so I can tell you how great this is a great field trip to Krueger and you know you can't just camp anywhere so you got to Camp inside these little compounds and you know it's just a very unique interesting um experience and even then still you know a delivery man left a gate open on one of those compounds and sister Jerry and I of course slept right through and if we had left our door open maybe we wouldn't be here right now but somebody left the gate open and in the middle of the night I guess they were shouting and people running to and fro and headlights shining and somebody inside the compound had went outside to go to a vehicle and there's a lion but that's the reason you're inside the compound is so there is no Lions outside your door but somebody left the gate open but anyway the lion you know afraid was happening it fled they searched the whole compound couldn't find it but that's the kind of world as as this brother charity says this is a world where the animals are loose and the humans are in the cage and so it's there my brother and sister they're on this wonderful experience and they're out in the middle of Kruger National Park and a brother says can you get me to a telephone and there was like is it an emergency brother he says no I just want to check my brokerage account I agree sister Carrie what so they found you know this is a three four five day experience and they found a phone for him and a couple days later maybe it was the next day I don't remember exactly it's like can we find another telephone and they're like I need to check my brokerage account you know the brother told me he says we was thinking about inviting the brother back to preach at the church but we realized his Focus was not really upon what God had offered him his Focus was on his brokerage account and so we just drove him to the airplane airport and bought him a plane ticket and sent him home so he could look at his brokerage account see it's important what our focus is my brother and sister we come into the house of God and if our focus is somewhere else we're going to walk out of the house of God and your spiritual brokerage account will have just went down but if we invest in the things of God and we're focused on the word of God our spiritual brokerage account keeps building up building up oh wouldn't you want to be a spiritual millionaire amen when I say that I just use that as a context to come to the place that our light is lit and it's Burning Brightly amen not just saying we're message Believers but the Life of Christ actually burning within us that it's visible amen so it's there what happened to the Saints of old my brother and sister the change of their Dynamics what it was was their focus had changed no doubt they were the butcher the baker or the Candlestick maker and people started say some things happen have you ever noticed that about people some things happened about them my brother and sister what was it their focus had changed and that God started to come and have preeminence in their life and when he has preeminence my brother and sister oh let me say it this way if God has got preeminence in our lives it will be be obvious people say well I don't want them judging me forget about us judging you what about God judging you amen what about God saying I want to be on display in your life in fact I am on display in your life hallelujah amen so you see what it is the Focus changing look how that changed my brother and sister where we don't sing this world is not my home just as a song it comes from deep within us this world is not my home what you focused on that and you had to make a decision right we have to make a decision what is my home I don't choose this Earth I don't choose the spirit of this Earth because well we see what it's producing now people sometimes think oh if I could put it this way people say well Brother Paul's pretty judgmental I've been told that not that far in the past you're judgmental no actually please don't believe that because this is going to sound very heady of me but I've been blessed with an ability to just state facts as they are without having emotion attached in other words when I see somebody who's destroying their life or their life is being destroyed by the spirit of the age I can declare what I see but it doesn't mean I have emotion attached to that as though I would do because I would trust by now vote me out as a pastor if you don't feel this way that you would know my heart my motive my desire that I I could if I would you know I've shared with you about being a manipulator and people get nervous when people start talking the preacher said manipulate in church I'm nervous but you realize there's another side of that that if I could I would put every one of us into Heavenly places right now I would take us into a place that would be my heart's desire to just say the right things do the right things preach the right things that would cause each one of us to be filled with the Holy Ghost and moving in the right direction but somebody will be saying I was manipulated well praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm glad I've been manipulated this world is not my home I look at it everywhere I go and I say Lord please let me out of here I want out of here Lord I want to escape this zoo that we call Earth amen now look at this these Saints of Hebrews 11 the culture of their day the culture of their lives changed they no longer were focused now don't get me wrong Saints I do believe that God In Balance has no problem with you gaining as it would financially or World things as long as you put him first the moment that we put something else before God there's where our Trouble Comes and you know there's just as many poor people going to go to hell as rich people so it isn't about your financial picture it's about your desire and what your focus is on amen you know there's a family I won't declare from where they're at they like to remain Incognito but my brother and sister there's a family that the brother has shared with me personally a long ways from here and he says you know what when we as a family not just me and my wife but my children and my sons and their wives and my daughters and their husbands when we started putting God first and he said when I mean first I mean really first like we wouldn't even leave the office for work when without asking God to give us the wisdom for every decision and everything and he said from that day on he said brother Paul I don't know any other way to say it but the money started pouring in and we started giving it out and it started pouring in even greater and it just kept going exponentially and he says no one even really knows how many millions of years passes through our hands because we choose to remain anonymous we choose to drive older vehicles we choose to be low-key we choose to do this and I'm telling you I know he's saying the truth because when there was needs in in Chile the brother gave tens of thousands of dollars as per into those needs and my brother and sister said please he said brother Paul don't don't don't even share my name I'm not one bit of credit this is God's money he just trusted me to have it for a moment and pass it on so see we we got to get away from this idea that that if uh we've been blessed as it were in the natural life that we can't be spiritual no I say my brother and sister at whatever tool Satan would desire to use against you we as Sons and Daughters of God have overcome that amen so if it's money women popularity this that or the other whatever it might be God's already given us an ability to overcome that and he didn't do that because we are the best of the best in the flesh my brother and sister he did that because he looked at a people and said I see something in them I see a life in them and what was he looking at in the reflection he was looking at himself he wasn't looking at our flesh he wasn't looking people I'm trying I'm trying quit trying and let God see his own reflection in your life young people you say it's hard to serve the Lord and I say it is but quit looking at your own life and look at Christ and say you know what lord it's you and it's going to only be you that's going to bring me through this world unscathed amen because the minute we start looking at the flesh all kinds of things pop up yeah oh now look at this the cultures the ideas see what is culture my brother and sister culture is tied in ideas and customs and social behavior oftentimes what we really see in culture is a more focus on social behavior but I'm telling you the Lord would just knock some of these we'll just pick on the young men if the Lord would just knock some of these young men in the head a little bit get all of their neutrons and ions and whatever else all lined up and they would look in the mirror and they'd go oh I went in public like this but you see culture has come and it's set a dynamic in front of them and I know I've mimicked this a lot and I probably shouldn't but just one more time these young men just saw one the other day walking like a bow-legged chicken because that's the way you got to walk to keep your pants from falling off and they got their belt cinched tight below their bum and then they walk like this to keep their pants up and you ask them why do you do this my identity no it can't be your identity there's another million of you that's not your identity that's cultures identity well I should say laodicean culture identity because you know we have a culture oh Hallelujah if we are in the right place if we're preaching the word unadulterated we as message Believers have a culture and that culture is word first amen no other substitute no delusion nothing it is the word and only the word that's what matters and when the word becomes so strong in us they can take a little snippet for DNA and all they'll come back with it looks to me like this must be a Son of God this is not a son of laodicea I find no DNA matching cane I don't find any uh DNA matching Nimrod I don't find any Babylonian genes in them I only find the very nature and the life of Jesus Christ and it's flowing through their veins we don't have to hunt and Peck to find it Well we take a little snippet of what they wear yeah that looks like they are Godly it take a little snippet of this or a little snippet of that but I say they let God take a sample as it were of every part of our being and if that part don't pass the God test then Lord take us back again and wash us again and put us in the fire again that everything that we are every fiber of our being would pass the test it said son or daughter of God Hallelujah and that's what happened with these Saints my brother and sister of Hebrews 11 we see through the word do you notice how beautiful this is that God did not hide their mistakes amen that's right sometimes we get a little embarrassed you know because well I've made a mistake and I I think I'll just quit going to church because I don't want to oh no I'm sorry God already broadcast it amen you you think you're going to hide your mistakes no I'm sorry the word says whatever is done in secret will be made open but if you're amongst the body of Believers they're going to look at it and say well pray to the Lord brother so and so sister so and so that sure was a blunder I wonder what that shoe tasted like and then it moves right from there and God says I'm not going to hide your mistakes but I will glorify oh I will glorify myself in you oh the world's out here look at them but I want to know what God said about it did God say welcome my son welcome my daughter I pour my spirit into you my brother and sister don't be worried about what the world says about that but it's when God comes and doesn't like what he sees then we've got a real something to worry about but we see how God is moving this is what touched these Saints in Hebrews 11 a record of that amen why now I had a whole bunch of stuff I was going to add to this but I left that out amen not for your my sake your sake actually because you see you would have said amen to it I know you would have but it took me another hour to have preached it so we'll just acknowledge the fact that we'll come because you know as it would be uh you know what the message is you know what the word is amen we've been changed someone say amen and why because we decided to be no because we've been Reborn amen that's when the blood of Jesus Christ took an old nature washed it out put a new nature in there and said you'll no longer be but now you are you are not my people we could sum that up real real full right there you're not my people but now you're my people and you know how it is whether you're a gangster or a sports nut or whatever it is people want to be your people yeah have you ever noticed that I was in Home Depot the other day I thought it was pretty ironic I saw I don't remember the name on The Jersey now I think it was Miami Dolphins Jersey I'm not sure but I think it was I saw three I think there must have been brothers because they all had the same name and number on them might have been a family identity number but all walking around with kind of a blue and whatever light blue shaded deal with somebody's name on the back and I felt like sorry I'm just warped but I felt like going um is that your brother down there but you see the problem is they're having identity crisis they don't know who they are so they have to find someone to identify him and as they identify more into these things of the carnal into laodicea they identify Less in who they are I want you to see this and you say well what's that got to do with anything because that's what Satan's doing and the prophet of God if you want it I could take you through the Long Trail the prophet of God said this is where they are are you a Christian no I'm a Baptist they put on a Baptist Jersey what are you I'm a Nazarene I'm a this I'm of that they're putting on an identity that's not an identity God called them to because he called us to identify as Sons and Daughters of God he called for us to identify as the bride of Christ amen and that's not a jersey my brother and sister and that's about some identity that's external that's deep down in the soul that's what God has called us to amen so what happened amen they come to a place the scripture says that you know they could have went back amen if they had wanted to can we go back well of course we can I don't mean to argue with you but of course you can go back the potential is there and Satan's there all the time using a phrase here a phrase their event here a something here and let me put it this way a little stumbling on our part and Satan's are always there to give a helping hand say I've just been trying to tell you for 25 years you're not really a Christian or if you want to be identified with a Christian that's fine put the Jersey on and just go off in that identity but you see they were offered an opportunity to go back and yes you were right brother David but I want you to see it my way amen could they go back I'm going to say yes they could there's always potential but you see they actually had to be able to recognize that other position now what has God done to our Saints is the world first and foremost no what's he done he's blurted and it's getting more blurred all the time it's fading away people are like don't you know who this is had somebody oh yeah yeah you know now I knew what they were talking about because there's been different things even shows up in farm magazines advertisements for Yellowstone and this guy's like do you know the character Ben and Yellowstone and I said oh I've been to Yellowstone you have yeah I was like maybe 10 years old or something but I've been no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about television show I said I don't know who they are see this thought that I'm preaching to you was in my mind I'm sorry I don't know who they are people that are unfaithful to each other Liars cheats and thieves and murderers and all of these I'm sorry I don't know who they are but I do know who Jesus Christ is well I'm a Christian too he was just telling me you were in a bar maybe you were witnessing or maybe you were just the witness you see my brother and sister it says they say such things for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country you know what it's coming down to our language is even changed we're not even saying this same thing and this is why I brought out money earlier I want to tie the ribbon for you it's there that we can be and God can bless us with a good job good Investments good things in our life but my brother and sister that didn't become the focus of our life our focus is Christ and all this is just peripheral and it's there that what we start to speak a language it's a different language than the world it would be like us getting off a plane I don't know where China Japan Korea uh Africa whatever we can't speak that language but when God comes on the scene he can draw from every nation Kindred and tongue and we speak the same language oh that's a supernatural power of God because our focus is not on the carnal it's not focused on what we have done or acquired Folk it's because they desire a better country amen they're Desiring a Heavenly country something that's there and God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has prepared them a city is that a Dwelling Place he has prepared them to be a Dwelling Place oh and someone say thank you Lord amen see we can try being mindful to being focused if we came to church just to put this out if we come to church to be focused today and I pray every one of us did when we think about the pot roast or lunch or what we need to do Monday morning we can choose to focus on that but when we come mindful of the things of God we literally and I think somebody will say Amen to this we literally have to take that and put it aside it doesn't just happen it doesn't just wow what am I going to do this afternoon I'm going to eat more than I should and I'm gonna lay down and take a nap and then I'm gonna call so and so and see if their family wants to fellowship and and that can consume our Sunday because it starts in thought and then it becomes deed and so our Sunday's consumed with the idea we're going to eat nice food take a nap and go visit someone and we walk out and somebody says I've seen this happen before it's embarrassing when I said I've seen it happen before it happened to me and somebody says uh hey what'd the preacher preach on this morning uh I remember it was in the Bible any um red I think it was two quotes maybe three thank you for being mindful thank you for focus that's why people get fired from their jobs they're not even mindful oh we could go off in another thing and I could tell you it's right in the scripture whatever you are in the house of God is what you will be in your life external people say no no no no I'm very diligent at work I don't believe you and I imagine you're boss that's got a job review that will agree with me also a Heavenly country now see my brother and sister they Saints of the ages they were living in the very moment these scriptures are written about believing they were persuaded they embraced it they confessed it and something changed Dynamics in their life does that sound familiar yeah that's what happened to me do you know because of this I'm going to be very bold this morning I'm actually identified in Hebrews 11. oh my name doesn't appear there but I am in Hebrews 11 because I am a Son of God and I have overcome the world it was God in Me no no no no God chose not in Hebrews 11 to list all of their faults my brother and sister he talked about faith and he talked about their courage and he talked about who they were and what they were called to do and I find myself in Hebrews 11 because I know that in spite of my weakness my failure my shortcoming God's not listing that that's a devil that's listening that it's God that's listing what's good about me what's beautiful and what's of purpose amen and what is there rich and mighty oh Hallelujah you see because it comes down to a time this world's not our home the culture of their lives oh yes as I said already they can go back they can go back if they wanted to now look at this I'm gonna do a little jumping around here Brothers I want to go over here if we'll go forward here to Perfection amen that's what we want right we're looking for perfection then what does that real Royal 100 Christian that's born again of the spirit of God oh look how closely he's identifying this he is not leaving one thing to doubt here then what does that real Royal 100 Christian that's born again of the spirit of God whose name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world who let come let go what made they hold to God's unchanging hand so this definitive description of this individual has one thing in common and that is they hold to God's unchanging hand oh my brother and sister when I was a kid we used to go play in the graveyard and we would shout and we would run but most of our running we were looking over our shoulder and most of our shouts was to let everybody know we were still alive but look what God's doing he's putting something in the believer that he can walk through laodicea and he doesn't care let me just go on what is it in their heart that's hungering for something Yonder oh for those said the Bible that do so plainly confess by their testimony their life that they seek a city to come whose Builder and maker is gone oh I want my life do you want your life to testify that I am seeking a city I'm seeking something beside becoming rich in laodicea the kind of influential and laodicea popular in laodicea I'm looking for a city oh Hallelujah and what is that hunger in your heart this morning to want to stand in his presence what is that hunger in your heart this morning the reaching out with all that's in you all your soul in your life is crying for something to you say I don't care what comes and goes do you realize now look to the UN how do I say this because it's not like I'm trying to be negative on those that aren't but maybe of those that are overly ambitious you know that can be almost as much as the curse is not being ambitious at all I mean it can actually come back and haunt you just talking to a brother the other day and he made a comment to me and I said brother I looked him right in the face I said brother I think even your garage is OCD and his wife just I didn't even need a comment out of him thank you sister being an overachiever can be almost as much as a curse as being an under Neath we need balance in all things and as the Holy Ghost brings balance in our lives then we're able to come and there is if you don't mind me putting it this way there is a hunger in the human for certain things I know people that could sit for Endless hours on the River Bank casting a hook out in the water not catch or even get a single nibble and it would come back tomorrow and do it again and I know men that if they are there and after 30 minutes something hasn't nibbled on their line no we're either moving to a different spot or we're going home and it's there my brother and sister that you'll find the different Natures the different hungers that people I have seen men amen that would climb to the peak of the mount sweat and and be a break where they slip in the rocks and do whatever just for the sight of an elk rump going over the ridge and come home and say did you have a good hunting trip brother yes where's the rack on the mountain still living but I saw him at eleven thousand feet what are you doing at 11 000 feet that's where airplanes go but you see there's a hunger in them to do this now I hope you can catch where I'm going there's a hunger in us to attain natural thanks oh how much greater the hunger should be for us for the spiritual things of God a hunger that we can just see ourselves oh I I used to get in trouble in school all the time I fortunately I had some teachers they were experienced they knew what was happening and so you know Mrs Gerke English teacher she used to say okay Paul what's today's daydream about oh I don't know I mean I no go ahead tell me I'm not going to criticize you you're already gonna have to write I will not stare out the window 500 times so just share with me because it was that nature I didn't care I had no hunger for prepositions and you all notice that I know how to structure a sentence it starts with a capital letter and has a period on the end that's how you structure a sentence but you see I want to drive this home while we don't think it's obvious not only is it obvious to God but it's obvious around what we're hungry what is it we're hungry I say Lord let it be obvious what we're hungering for let it not be confused where people want to know is he really excited or is it part of this but let it be so obvious my brother and sister but the prophet of God I just read yesterday the prophet of God says what happens is when people are that way they start calling them fanatics so do we want to be mainstream or do we want to be fanatics if a fanatic gets me into heaven I want to be a fanatic if mainstream gets me into the ballpark you can take that two-way ballpark meaning the phrase close or whoopee ballpark would we want to settle for just being in the ballpark no sir see there's something about the expression now I find it interesting that brother Brown was preaching about Hungary in the sermon perfection right because it is my brother and sister what we're hungering for amen and what is it come on what made they hold to God's unchanging hand what's in their heart that's hungering for something Yonder for those said the Bible that do so plainly confess by their testimony in their life that they seek a city to come whose Builder and maker is gone what is that hunger in your heart this morning to want to stand in his presence what is that hunger in your heart this morning the reaching out with all that's in you all your soul and all your life is crying for something till you say I don't care what comes and goes I want to say my brother and sister is that where we're at and if we're not there let's just press into this let's press into the hunger of being there that we don't care what comes and goes we just want more of Jesus Christ Hallelujah let it not be some kind of church Mantra but let it be something moving and stirring in the soul of Sons and Daughters of God that we identify with Jesus Christ first and everything else comes afterwards now I want to take you back brother Joshua you'll take me there or brother Mason to Hebrews 11. verses 36 through 40. and uh look at this where do we stand here Saints and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings Yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sauna sunder were tempted now I want to interject this to you because we're not tied to logs and throwed to the Hogs and we're not thrown from the bridges to the Rocks below and we're not sawing asunder but you'll notice temptation was considered persecution simple Temptation now the devil changes tactics now as it were men would go to prison men would be charged with crimes for such things that you will not find a single indictment for temptation the devil has free reign I'm just going to get right down on the rubber on the road today Saints you walk in the grocery store on a simply task that would not be considered anything but normal and you go right in there and Satan has set the stage for temptation to stand in the grocery store and it goes both ways for men and women and so you go you set about to just simply go to the post office or whatever it might be and Satan has set Temptation in front of you not a single law against it he has free reign and we'll look at that and see and they were slain with a sword and they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted no law against affliction and no law against torment of whom the worthy world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains in the dens and the caves of the earth and in the big cities and the little cities in the countryside in Idaho and Oregon and wherever else you can remember and the word says they were not worthy of these people right you wonder why the world doesn't like you my brother and sister because you are such a contrast to the anointing that is upon them that they look at you almost as though you are an armed enemy because in the spirit realm you are the spirit that is in them has a conflict with you where they can come to the place where they instantly uh do not like you they're instantly bothered by your presence they're instantly aggressive they're instantly rude all of these things and you say why did that person do to me because this is not about Flesh and Blood this is about principalities and powers of darkness and it's time my brother and sister that we grasp the idea that the devil really doesn't like us it's time for us to get back we've been trying to be friends with the devil you know kind of like they say in the country good fences make good neighbors the devil don't care how good your fence is he hates you anyhow amen and you see what he's doing and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing who's the US here Saints yeah we're the US amen don't point it off to somewhere else don't put it off to this great preacher and that great family it's great no my brother and sister we are the US God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect now you know there's several different ways you can analyze this and because that's the way I approach things I like to break it down I like to see what Webster's got to say in the diet go out and different things about this my brother and sister that they without us are not made perfect so you can look at it we'll take this one first that they without us are not complete in other words the puzzle needs one last piece and we're the peace and they are the puzzle of righteousness and Holiness so the last piece must be righteousness and Holiness amen for us to be plugged in that for it to be perfect but there's also another sign of it my brother and sister that God chose this age and he said in this age will be the completion of the Fulfillment of the revelation of the mystery of Jesus Christ and it's in that and God said it's going to take a special person to bring that word and it's going to take a special person to receive that word amen and so they without us come down to the place that someone's got to be standing there receiving the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ but when we receive fullness God gives credit all the way back through time and says my bride he doesn't say just a bride of this age or bride of that age but it's his bride and when we called of God right we were called to Philadelphia to Ephesus we want to call back to the those days we were called now we were called to stand here today and God said it's for those that will come and I will make them all perfect with these that I place in this day and pour my spirit in poor Revelation the fullness of the mystery up that into them and when they receive this word because they are the word and something in them has such a hunger such a desire I've got to is life easy I'll tell you no life is not easy there are trials there are Temptations but others say I've done enough I've heard enough I've seen enough I'm done and you get down and say oh God help me help me Lord as Peter was Lord Jesus save me oh because there's something in us that brings us and what is this my brother and sister it's not anything that we said or done it's not anything that we could do but what happened you say well do you see visions depends on what you want to call a victim I see visions I See Vision Saints God's opened my eyes to see the supernatural of revealed word and in that I see the vision of who I am in Jesus Christ I need to see a vision of an event or a time or a place I just need to see who I am and you just need to see who you are oh I should included that quote now I wish I would have me you know the quote when the prophet of God says when the church sees who she is and then behind that she will oh Hallelujah I'm saying we're in the season of she will she has she is oh look at this my brother and sister why because our Focus has shifted from oh I don't mean this offensive our Focus has shifted from the message to Jesus Christ scripture says all that says they're Jews are not Jews I think I'll leave that there some people find that offensive I'm sorry my brother and sister I know Mormons that believe brother Branham was a prophet amen what because he fits every criteria the Mormon church has for a prophet but who do they quote oh Hallelujah yeah now look at this God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect now look some better things for us people say you think I've had a person that says that message believer say this to me you think they were saying this you might say critical you think that we have more than they had and they say that in a sense of almost like you think we have more than they have I can't really explain it all to you Saints and I can't really find the right words but yes I do and you know why I do because my Bible told me so um do we make a Doctrine out of it and we've got a big banner raised up you know that like Grace Tabernacle is better than everybody else no sorry we go just the opposite lift everyone around you compliment and love everyone around you why because that's what the prophet taught us through the word amen not to make ourselves hidey and high-minded amen see you see we've been re blessed my brother and sister to receive the final voice all right amen absolutely oh somebody interpret that final voice for me it depends on how you come about that because in a way I would say there's no wrong answer a final voice has been a prophet of our day an Elijah Ministry they're coming broke the bread for us and you notice they didn't have to run down to Eddie's Bakery and get more bread we didn't have to reinvent the message to get it to fit our marriages Our lives our children and us as individuals that bread just keeps being broken amen it just keeps coming have you ever I know you have because I've heard you confess it but you know you're going through a little something in life and you say you know Lord I need a little encouragement and you'll either pick up a book or tape and there's your answer my oh my what happened the master come and just broke a piece off the loaf and handed it to you oh hallelujah thank you Lord he's still breaking bread for us oh my oh my oh my now look we want to just kind of come to the place of um uh do we think we have more than they did and I come to the place that I'm going to say right now that it's in the word right amen that he had something special for us that's what the word says now let's just go right in here to Jehovah Jireh amen and let's let's look at this but Mary when the angel met her she didn't doubt God said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word that's an amen for those of you who don't know how to read between these lines that right there is an amen and never was there anything like that done before that's it you mean we don't have to go to prove the revealed word of the hour by taking it back had a brother talking to him on the phone the other day and he said brother Paul he says you'd be surprised what an uproar it can be when someone in your church that you thought was solid and says you can't preach on that because brother Branham never even mentioned that scripture ever once on tape oh I don't know if I'll have much Bible left because it's only a matter of time the next one will come along I've read my Bible cover to cover in a single day their Bibles about that thick because they've limited eliminated this that hurt this that corrected and this that offended their mama and that offended their granny and this offended their children and pretty soon they got no Bible at all right but you see some would never dare desecrate their Bible that way but they have she just took God at his word right she did oh let me get back where it was there never was anything like that done before so she's on new Turf man I mean somebody's going to say there's something wrong with you girl and if we think we've had persecution I wonder what we would think of what Mary went through I don't mean to be crass but she started showing it she started showing in her flesh she had come face to face with God Amen it was not a theological thought it was a real actual event taking place in her body and it changed her forever oh Hallelujah oh amen she didn't question she didn't reason she just took God at his word and went along rejoicing telling people she was going to have a baby knowing no man and when that had never been done before oh wouldn't it be fine if all these Mary's here tonight would take that kind of an attitude wouldn't it be wonderful if all the people would take that attitude don't question God's just going to be rough with you Saints not rough with you but my brother and sister that is a spirit that is coming in the message you see people that are leaving they are there quitting people still in church but they say well like they do about the Bible I believe this is inspired I don't believe this is inspired do you believe this and then others radically the other way everything brother Branham said is inspired well my brother and sister I want to tell you you've got to find the balance in the middle of all of this because if you start questioning you will find the questions never end you will find you will question yourself right out of serving God amen and you can go the other way and get so radically consumed into it that you come oh I tell you sorry to put it to you this way but I got a friend that's a pastor of a church and had a family leave his church because when he would read a quote like this they'd he didn't give the uh uh now tell me what they're focused on every word is Anointed Lord forgive me I don't mean to make light but what does a uh uh uh mean you see my brother and sister we got to have a balance we're going to find that balance and I've got to find a balance and cut this off somewhere amen she just took all his word wouldn't it be fine all the Mary's would do this don't question if God so says so that settles it that's all that settle as if God said so that makes it right now he's the final voice on all what's the final voice come on people all get called up no it's a final voice the prophet that they're saying is that absolute is saying that God is absolute amen saying that it's God that is the final voice and if God said so that makes it right now he's the final voice on all authority has all the authority of everything God has the supreme authority and I'm going to take it this way because I believe you have a balance my brother and sister when God come down and he put the word of God in a prophet's voice and his heart I mean as it is that he's studying I was just reading and he says now I was fixing to preach this talking about in the seals and vials and whatnot I was fixing to preach this and as I was going getting prepared to go out to do this the Lord told me don't that's it because you already preached it in The Sixth Seal supernaturally wow what if God hadn't intervened he would have come out and tried to explain it all out of this when God had already anointed it in the word to be revealed oh no I know it sounds like I'm a critic but just trust me I'm not I just believe what the supernatural has declared amen so as we look here I want to hurry along here see man that man's idea of perfect I don't know I wouldn't want to put anybody on the spot but we'll all have a different idea of what is perfect yeah it's kind of like this I'll use a very simple analogy man cuts a board 80 inches long he looks at that board tape on it perfect another man like some of you I mean people stretches the tape on there and says um that's seven feet 11 inches and 99 99 thousandths it's not 80 inches I farm with GPS yesterday I was betting wheat ground it told me all through the day everything is perfect that my rows were within a whole inch of what I desired for him sister April what happens when you only get within an inch I think my rows are perfect yeah see our idea of what perfect is is irrelevant God has the idea of what Perfection is yes so you see our idea of perfect in God's idea perfect amen we're looking for a man with no flaws I haven't found him yet sorry Brothers but I haven't found him yet but God's looking a Flawless God is looking for a submitted man he doesn't need the perfect man he needs a submitted man because he's a perfect God and so when we let a perfect God into our life with no hindrance and fully submit to him God looks down on our life which we see mistakes others see mistakes and God says I see Perfection because I see a submitted soul I see a man who's willing to let me do what I want to do and when that man will allow me to do what I want to do I will use him to fulfill my word and you are fulfilling his word today Saints oh forgive me for yelling I'm just excited amen what is it it's also a perfect is to coming into maturity see you cannot Harvest imperfect wheat so what is imperfect wheat can be a lot of things but it could come down to just simply immaturity people are like why did that I've had people ask me this brothers and sisters that come from big cities we we were you know flying over you know Montana and we looked out the window and here's these columbines and they've left all these spots down in the bottom the bottom they never harvested and they went on left it is there something wrong with that weed it all saw them yeah something very terribly wrong with it really yeah it's called immaturity now I want to ask you this is a little personal y'all don't look at each other okay just all look straight ahead no Taps on knees or nothing you all know some immature people don't you Brother David quit being a spoiler because I know you're not going to look over at sister Diane do you know that immaturity Satan can anoint that to be a stumbling Stone because someone would see someone else and it seems like God's answering their prayers see it's like God's doing this God's moving people can come to the place they actually I I can't remember the word just passed over my mind there um envious they become a little bitter towards people like who do they think they are stand still and let the sun move he'll burn be careful what you ask for you know I always get that humor I've said it many times here brother Jewel I do not pray for patience don't worry about it brother Jewel patient's going to come to you whether you like it or not amen but the thing is we've got to lay in the presence God's not going to take you out and stick you in an oven somewhere and just burn you he's going to let you lay in the presence of the Sun I prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed for an answer the make-believer unbeliever says God doesn't hear my voice and they walk away the real believer says Lord answer I know you said you would you hear my prayer You Hear My Cry Lord I need to hear from you and then God comes and lays it in the word and says Be Still be still and know that I am God Lord help us be still oh because you see we have a supreme authority Saints okay let me come let me come here amen I've got to hurry along here God's intention for his creation man is to express his words that alone could stand all by itself it doesn't need any other explanation with it in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed now we serve a God that changes not same yesterday today and forever so that right there speaking about in Genesis is applying to you and I right now right here today and life live by the word would be the word expressed that is true is it not but did Adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word now in my defense Church in my defense I'd like to speak to the jury you wonder why brother Paul Harps about those people that just twist one word I showed that to brother Sergey the other day I can't even remember the exact words myself to add one word to the truth is to take a word away I would never take anything from the word yeah you did because you added something to it so you water down you know the government says it was necessary for us to add a couple trillion in new cash into the market they added but what did it do took away your dollar went from being worth 89 cents to 81 cents but they had it no they took away that's what the devil does amen amen every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there are rose Moses what a great mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that Prophet the type of the great prophet to come failed in Anger to obey the word oh God help us never to be angry amen and there was also David the great king of Israel man after God's Own Heart but he failed by adultery and when he was tempted but eventually in the fullness of time there come one the head even Jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word oh my brother and sister we say oh praise the Lord I got a spirit of love but Jesus overcome love I can do this but do you realize my brother and sister that God was not just putting that out for you and I to see this oh I I have a temper Lord help me Jesus overcome a temper I can do this too my brother and sister do you realize God was proving that flesh could bear every word or we could say well as of course Jesus no no he wasn't testing Jesus he was testing flesh proving our flesh following the recipe of the word can overcome amen every temptation so look at this now failed in Anger there's also David king of Israel man after God's Own Heart failed by adultery when he was tempted but eventually in the fullness of time now that's why I had to go back do you realize what the fullness of time is my brother and sister I cannot go back and say I'm going to live I'm going to study every word that Paul preached and I'm going to stay only on what Paul preached well he preached the word didn't he he preached truth but did he reveal the mystery he spoke the words see there's the little key he spoke it but he didn't reveal it you needed someone to take the spoken word and bring it out in such a fashion that you see God didn't bring it by education or explanation he brought it by Revelation and that's the special key element we were talking about earlier that I've got something greater for you because he was not going to come down just anoint one man as a messenger to the word right prophet of God I can't replace him I can't be and man would I not want to have been him but I tell you what it is my brother and sister it didn't stay a one-man Ministry it become a revelation to the whole body of Christ to the bride it became Revelation to her that each one could come and I say could go to Africa it could go to Antarctica to South America to China to wherever and the same Revelation is present amen they heard a voice that voice was alive it was speaking oh come on amen but eventually in the fullness of time coming as time is closing fullness means full time has come to the fullness of this and it's coming down and what is happening there the mystery by Revelation is revealed we all had to go to the mystery Resource Center you can take that two ways we did have to go to the mystery Resource Center but we don't have a Mecca hmm gotta hurry must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God let's go right along here hurry fastball then with Satan Foyle look isn't that awesome I say thank you Lord we finally got the recipe through all the ages that foiled Satan and for here was one who lived by it is written I hope this changes your perspective of when you hear the preacher preach about it is written because it was not just hey we're going to mimic Jesus this was a revelation of overcoming power and to unlock the key and the power power come out and any son or daughter of God who operates that key in sincerity can unleash that power amen and so there it is you want to foil Satan release the power for him is one who lived by it is written in the Masterpiece of God overcome by preaching a new message no reflecting oh have you ever watched them solar panels that move with the Sun pretty cool you're sitting there and you're like that just moved but you can't prove it moved because it's not moving when you finally looked at it and then it moves again and pretty soon you find yourself fascinated just staring at that thing waiting for it to move and finally it did only it didn't move near as much as we thought it should you're God's reflector yeah and I watched you and I know you're moving and as a minister I think they should have moved more but God's in control because when the reflector is following the sun it doesn't care what the spectator thinks it's following the sun that's it foreign given to the Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and then that life really given when enable us to overcome and express the word of God isn't that so beautiful now look at this we'll finish this off sister will you come and now these sons have gone who by him overcome are given the privilege of the paradise of God and the constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ there will never be any separation from him whether he goeth his bride will go what is his he shares with his beloved on a joint air relationship now catch this next line the secret things will be revealed um why do you think you understand I don't see it that way it's never been revealed to me I don't know why it's not for me to say but I do know as his bride he's been talking to me I do know as his bride he keeps coming and saying honey just a little longer honey just keep walking honey don't quit now honey you're perfect in my sight oh thank you Lord I'm telling you when you live as this poor old boy does you know one foot I'm stubbing my toe the other one I've got my shoe in my mouth need the grace of God I can't live my brother and sister but every day I'm like Lord I'm sorry I I acted in such a fashion or I said something or I thought something Lord forgive me and then I'm reminded his Perfection is different than my perfection he is not looking at me through my eyes he's looking at me through his eyes and the prophet of God said when he looks at us through his eyes he's actually looking through the blood and all he can see is the blood Hallelujah oh he shares with his beloved on a joint air relationship secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain and we shall know as we are known and we shall be like him this is the heritage of the Overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of testimony to Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah Saints [Music] aren't you glad aren't you glad of who you are in Jesus Christ aren't you glad that you're led by heavenly vision and not a church Revelation it's not a man's idea but it's God himself coming down and revealing himself because there is something greater been left for us in this hour and that is to walk in the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah I've got to stop I've got to stop my you know just have to just have to take the word amen just remember God's idea God's vision of you what's perfect is not your vision of what's perfect and just strive to be perfect in his eyes which means Dive In Dive In Wednesday night Saints dig deep dig deep don't settle for a surface relationship dig deep you know I say this just to make a point to that bit of humor in it one
