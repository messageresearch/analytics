[6:18] blessed friends. Good evening.
[6:23] Um, let's start with number 455.
[6:31] I came here feel a little sluggish this
[6:34] whole week. Just been so tired. Brother
[6:36] Trevor's yawning.
[6:38] So, uh, Maybe we'll just sing it
[6:41] together. Energize a little bit.
[6:44] I'm looking for a city, the one not made
[6:48] by hands. I'm looking over Jordan and I
[6:53] see the promised land. The waters will
[6:57] be parted and I'll be on my way. As
[7:02] we're crossing over Jordan, I can say
[7:07] that now I have that everlasting
[7:12] joy within.
[7:14] Since he came and took away my sin, the
[7:20] moment that he blessed me, he made me
[7:24] fully whole with that everlasting joy
[7:28] within my soul.
[7:32] And I'm drinking from the fountain that
[7:35] flowth from on high. A well of blessed
[7:40] waters that never shall run dry. I'm
[7:44] feasting on God's mana. I'm praying day
[7:49] by day. And that everlasting joy is here
[7:53] to stay.
[7:56] Oh, now I have that everlasting
[8:01] joy within.
[8:03] Since he came and took away my sin, the
[8:09] moment that he blessed me, he made me
[8:13] fully whole with that everlasting joy
[8:17] within my soul.
[8:20] And I've heard the prophet's message.
[8:24] I've placed it in my heart. I've got the
[8:28] revelation
[8:30] that never shall depart. The rapture is
[8:35] upon us. The stage is set to go. And we
[8:40] have this precious promise we all know.
[8:45] And now I have that everlasting
[8:49] joy within.
[8:52] Since he came and took away my sins, the
[8:58] moment that he blessed me, he made me
[9:02] fully whole with that everlasting joy
[9:06] within my soul. One more time. And now I
[9:10] have that everlasting
[9:14] joy within.
[9:16] Since he came and took away my sin. The
[9:23] moment that he blessed me, he made me
[9:26] fully whole with that everlasting joy
[9:31] within my soul.
[9:34] And I was there when Jesus saved me.
[9:38] The very moment he forgave me,
[9:42] he took away my heavy burden
[9:46] and he gave me peace within.
[9:51] Satan tries to make me doubt it,
[9:56] but I'm going to shout it.
[10:00] I was there when it happened. And I
[10:03] guess I ought to know one more time. Oh,
[10:08] I was there when Jesus saved me.
[10:12] The very moment he forgave me,
[10:17] he took away my heavy burden
[10:20] and he gave me peace within.
[10:26] Satan tries to make me doubt it,
[10:30] but I'm going to shout it.
[10:35] I was there when it happened.
[10:38] And I guess I ought to know one last
[10:41] time. Oh, I was there when Jesus saved
[10:45] me.
[10:47] The very moment he forgave me,
[10:52] he took away my heavy burden
[10:55] and he gave me peace within.
[11:00] Satan tries to make me doubt it,
[11:05] but I'm going to shout it.
[11:09] I was there when it happened. And I
[11:13] guess I ought to know.
[11:18] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[11:21] Why don't we go to number 220? We'll
[11:24] sing Thing About His Love.
[11:28] Think about his love.
[11:32] [Music]

[11:45] that's brought us through.

[11:58] so great is the measure
[12:01] of our Father's love.

[16:14] Every day I live.
[16:17] Lord, I love you more.
[16:23] [Music]
[16:25] And the more that I surrender,
[16:31] the lighter
[16:34] my Lord.
[16:37] The more that I release my cares, the
[16:43] more you take control.
[16:49] The more that I can humble myself,
[16:54] the more you lift me up.

[21:17] [Music]
[21:18] When Jacob met the Lord
[21:22] upon that lonely night
[21:25] and wrestled there alone
[21:28] until the morning light, he won a
[21:33] princely title to guard him for the
[21:37] right.
[21:39] I want that kind of blessing.
[21:46] Yes, I want I want that kind of blessing
[21:53] that saves and keeps and satisfies the
[21:59] soul.
[22:00] I want I want that false salvation
[22:08] till billows of heaven or mirror.
[22:15] When Israel at last came into Canaan's
[22:21] land, the Lord his riches gave so full
[22:27] on every hand.
[22:29] They drove their foes before them and
[22:33] dwell the happy band.
[22:37] I want that kind of blessing.
[22:44] Oh, I want
[22:46] I want that kind of blessing that saves
[22:53] and keeps and satisfies the soul.
[22:59] I want I want that false salvation
[23:06] till below
[23:08] of heaven or may roll.
[23:13] This is the day of grace. The comforter
[23:18] is here. We are the chosen race.
[23:24] Our God is drawing near.
[23:28] He's waiting to be gracious, the prayer
[23:32] of faith to hear,
[23:35] and then he'll send the blessing.
[23:42] Yes, I want
[23:44] I want that kind of blessing that saves
[23:51] and keeps and satisfies the soul.
[23:57] I want I want that full salvation
[24:04] till below of heaven or me roll. One
[24:09] more time.
[24:11] Oh, I want
[24:13] I want that kind of blessing that saves
[24:20] and keeps and satisfies my soul.
[24:26] I want I want that for
[24:31] salvation
[24:33] till
[24:35] of heaven or mirror roll.
[24:40] Amen. As we invite brother David, let's
[24:42] sing number 313.
[24:45] Jesus draw me close.
[24:52] Jesus, draw me close,
[24:59] closer, Lord,
[25:02] to you.
[25:06] Let the world around me fade
[25:13] away.
[25:16] [Music]
[25:19] Oh Jesus, draw me close,
[25:27] closer, Lord,
[25:30] to you.
[25:33] For I desire to worship
[25:39] and obey.
[25:44] [Music]
[25:47] Jesus, draw me close,
[25:52] [Music]
[25:54] closeer, Lord,
[25:57] to you.
[26:01] Let the world around me fade
[26:08] away.
[26:12] [Music]
[26:15] Jesus, draw me close,
[26:20] [Music]
[26:22] closer, Lord,
[26:25] to you,
[26:28] for I desire
[26:32] to worship
[26:34] and obey. As we stand together, let's
[26:38] sing one more time.
[26:42] Oh Jesus, draw me close,
[26:49] closeer, Lord,
[26:53] to you.
[26:56] And let the world around me fade
[27:03] away.
[27:10] Jesus draw me close
[27:17] closer Lord
[27:20] to you
[27:24] for I
[27:30] [Music]
[27:37] hallelujah.
[27:41] I only heard one amen on that.
[27:44] Hallelujah.
[27:46] Do you love him?
[27:48] Are we happy to be here?
[27:51] Let me give you something that brother
[27:52] Brandham said. Do you mind? I've got a
[27:54] lot of things he said I want to share
[27:55] with you.
[27:58] He said, "We don't come together here in
[28:01] the church. We don't come together to
[28:02] talk about the message.
[28:06] We come together to get in the message.
[28:10] [Music]
[28:12] What is the message? Christ.
[28:15] [Music]
[28:16] We don't come together to talk about it.
[28:18] We come together to get in Christ. To
[28:21] get in the message.
[28:22] [Music]
[28:24] It's good to talk about it, but talking
[28:26] about it won't do it. You got to have
[28:27] the life of this in you. That's the key.
[28:31] Amen. Aren't you glad that
[28:35] the key is on his shoulders?
[28:39] Amen.
[28:40] Amen. I've got a lot of things here. I
[28:43] It's striking to me how God changes it
[28:47] so quickly.
[28:50] What direction I thought I was going, he
[28:53] just turns it right around. So God's
[28:56] always right. God's always perfect.
[28:59] I believe that with all my heart. Amen.
[29:02] We're never just set in our ways. He's
[29:05] sovereign. He does what he wants to do
[29:08] when he wants to do it. And I'm so glad
[29:11] he can get us in his grip and comes in
[29:14] us.
[29:16] And we're subject to him. It's
[29:19] beautiful, brother, sister. His ways are
[29:21] perfect.
[29:22] Your way is not perfect. It's not about
[29:24] you. It's about him.
[29:26] Amen. Amen. And I just say as my brother
[29:30] prayed, brother Ivan, he said or he
[29:33] mentioned, he said, "We want more of
[29:34] God." Do we want more of God? Do you
[29:38] know that you have that desire? There's
[29:39] more of God for you. Praise the Lord.
[29:42] Amen. You couldn't have that desire.
[29:44] Deep calling the deep. There's got to be
[29:46] a deep to respond or you wouldn't be
[29:47] calling.
[29:49] That's truth. Amen. Amen. Let's have a
[29:53] word of prayer. Our heavenly father, in
[29:55] the name of Jesus, we come reverently
[29:58] and humbly before you and that almighty
[30:00] allsufficient name. That name's not a
[30:03] history to us. That name is here now.
[30:07] That name is in your people,
[30:10] Lord. That name is your bride.
[30:14] That name is yourself.
[30:18] So thankful that we can share this Lord
[30:20] together
[30:23] as members of one body
[30:26] under one head.
[30:28] Our blessed redeemer and the one that
[30:30] not only purchased us but came forth in
[30:33] this hour to claim us.
[30:37] Lord he claimed what he's purchased. And
[30:40] there's a bride truly raising up coming
[30:42] into a maturity
[30:44] and that maturity is of yourself. She's
[30:47] this word is growing in the bride. The
[30:49] revelation of Jesus Christ is growing in
[30:51] the bride to a full stature.
[30:54] And we thank you for that stature, Lord,
[30:56] that we can worship in. It's coming very
[30:59] close now, Lord. Very close.
[31:02] And we know that that third pull, which
[31:04] is only for the bride. She's the only
[31:07] one that could go into that little room
[31:09] and come out sealed.
[31:12] We're so thankful for that sealing,
[31:14] Lord. Nothing can separate us. Nothing
[31:16] can come in there to take us. Satan
[31:19] can't receive it. You've hid the things,
[31:21] Lord, till the very end. And Satan has
[31:24] watched constantly what you might do and
[31:27] then tried to jump it ahead and pervert
[31:29] it. But this he can't pervert.
[31:32] He doesn't know this, Lord. It's your
[31:34] very mind opened. And it's open to a
[31:37] particular chosen race of people, a
[31:40] chosen group. Not race being another
[31:42] culture, but your race,
[31:45] Lord. We're here not as another
[31:47] creation. We were created in you.
[31:51] And Lord, when you came to this earth,
[31:53] we came here and created in you to good
[31:56] works which we have been before ordained
[31:59] that we should walk in them.
[32:02] So not our works, you're works.
[32:05] It's not works that saves us, Lord.
[32:07] There's one salvation and that's you.
[32:09] It's not Jesus plus works. It's Jesus
[32:11] alone.
[32:13] Then Lord, being in you, you've ordained
[32:16] us being a particular member of your
[32:18] body, a member in particular, different
[32:22] set aside individual.
[32:24] Lord, we can walk with you, speak with
[32:26] you and ordained of you, each position
[32:29] to take his place in this great
[32:30] symphony, in this great body.
[32:34] And Lord, we just give you praise for
[32:35] that. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[32:38] look forward now to your blessing on
[32:40] your word that you would impart it as
[32:42] it's going forth. You send your you send
[32:44] life through your word, Lord. Life
[32:46] always comes through your word.
[32:49] And Lord, we're so thankful that we by
[32:51] your word are partakers of yourself.
[32:54] When you opened up yourself in this day,
[32:56] we see and come to the realization,
[33:00] Lord, of who we are. We're growing in
[33:02] that, Father, to a body change. and
[33:06] we're thankful for this and give you
[33:08] praise now in Jesus' name. Lord, I give
[33:11] myself to you. You've turned this
[33:13] around. I'm expecting you to speak
[33:16] knowing you will speak because that's
[33:18] your promise. And Lord, I just we just
[33:21] commit ourselves. We release ourselves
[33:23] to you right now. We release our minds.
[33:27] We release ourselves entirely to your
[33:29] possession, to your will to do what you
[33:31] want to do and speaking your word to us
[33:34] in Jesus Christ's name. We pray for
[33:36] revelation
[33:38] because when it's revealed to us, it's a
[33:40] perfect faith and it's ours. It's not
[33:42] imagination. It's a it's a substance and
[33:46] it's a knowing. And we rejoice in this
[33:49] faith, this revelation that you're
[33:50] opening to us through your word, through
[33:53] what you promised you would do in this
[33:55] hour. And we're glad to be a a peculiar
[33:58] people. We're glad to be a special
[34:01] people. We give you thanks in Jesus'
[34:03] name. Amen. Amen.
[34:07] Praise the Lord. I'd like you to turn
[34:09] with me to Philippians chapter 2. My
[34:12] title tonight is the right mental
[34:14] attitude.
[34:15] And I just I'm just amazed how God
[34:20] compacts so much and so little. But it's
[34:23] every word is so compacted
[34:26] that it's just amazing how it just opens
[34:29] up. But right mental attitude and an
[34:32] attitude and when I speak of mental
[34:34] attitude I'm speaking of the right
[34:35] mental position
[34:37] because an attitude is a position and
[34:40] attitude is a great thing. Your attitude
[34:42] toward the word. Brother Brandham even
[34:44] said you people out here sitting hearing
[34:46] the word your attitude toward it could
[34:48] determine eternal life to you.
[34:50] And so attitude's a powerful powerful
[34:53] thing and uh our attitude we take brings
[34:56] results. Did you realize our attitude
[34:58] sets an atmosphere
[35:00] and so we want to be the attitude is our
[35:03] position toward the word. So we have a
[35:07] right mental attitude toward the word.
[35:09] The prophet said and don't forget this
[35:10] quotation that a right mental attitude
[35:12] toward any divine promise in this Bible
[35:15] will bring it to pass. Amen. He said,
[35:18] "Just remember the right mental attitude
[35:20] or mental position toward any divine
[35:22] promise that's written in this Bible
[35:24] will bring it to pass." So now, just
[35:26] keep that in your mind. If God made a
[35:28] promise and you'll take the right
[35:30] position or attitude toward that
[35:31] promise, God will fulfill everything
[35:33] that he promised. I know he said that is
[35:36] true. Hallelujah. Amen. All right. So if
[35:41] Philippians 2:5 said this,
[35:44] let this mind be in you. Hallelujah. He
[35:48] said let it means release it. It's time.
[35:52] Let it go. Allow me to put it in you.
[35:55] Allow me to give it. Allow me to make it
[35:57] manifest. Let this mind
[36:01] that was be in you where? Which was also
[36:05] now this is powerful. Which was also
[36:07] this is amazing to me. this just I can't
[36:09] I cannot even contain what's inside of
[36:12] my soul but this
[36:15] you realize well I won't say that quite
[36:17] yet let this mind let I just love that
[36:20] word let we let so many things but let
[36:24] we either let or don't let you realize
[36:27] that we either let in or let out amen we
[36:30] we are given authority amen over our
[36:35] being over our flesh man we are given
[36:37] authority over our spirit man. Who's
[36:40] given authority? The word's given
[36:42] authority. You see, the contest is
[36:44] between God, the word that's in your
[36:47] soul, and Satan.
[36:50] It's exactly what he said. The conflict
[36:52] is between God and Satan. He even
[36:54] preached a message called the conflict.
[36:57] The conflict is between God and Satan.
[36:59] But who is God in you? It's you, bride.
[37:05] Brother Brham said the real you is the
[37:06] spirit of God that's in you.
[37:09] Things that are to be. He said the the
[37:11] real you is the spirit of God that's in
[37:13] you. Where is it in you? In the inside
[37:15] of the inside.
[37:17] When God became flesh and dwelt among us
[37:19] in the fullness of the godhead bodily I
[37:21] was in him.
[37:23] Ephesians 2:10 which we had this last
[37:25] Wednesday. We we ministered here said
[37:27] you were created in Christ Jesus unto
[37:30] good works.
[37:32] But you were created in Christ Jesus.
[37:35] That is your that is your source.
[37:39] You tell me where he came from, I'll
[37:41] tell you where you came from. He tell me
[37:43] who he is and I'll tell you who you are.
[37:46] And I'll tell you where where he went,
[37:48] I'll tell you where you're going. Amen.
[37:50] Because you were created in Christ Jesus
[37:52] unto good works, which he, not you. He
[37:55] hath before ordained that you should
[37:57] walk in them. So let him have his way
[37:59] and bring forth what he desires through
[38:02] you as a member of his body in
[38:03] particular.
[38:06] Amen. And don't try to make it happen.
[38:08] You let him do it.
[38:10] How you going to do that? Release it.
[38:12] Release yourself to him. We're going to
[38:14] cover a lot of little area here in a
[38:16] short time. So I better keep going.
[38:19] So let this mind be in you which was
[38:22] also in same mind. same mind
[38:27] which was also in Christ Jesus.
[38:32] Now, if you think and consider his mind
[38:34] and what he had, do you realize that he
[38:36] didn't fully completely see the fullness
[38:38] of what he was until after he had passed
[38:41] and went on? Do you realize that? You
[38:44] say, "How do you know that?" Revelations
[38:45] 1:1 said that he received the full
[38:47] revelation of Jesus Christ, which God
[38:49] gave to him. Yeah.
[38:52] Amen. So he was a man on earth. Do you
[38:56] realize he was a man on earth? Walked on
[38:58] earth. Amen. Had followed the word. He
[39:01] said he learned obedience by the things
[39:03] he suffered. He was subject to the word
[39:05] and subject to God himself. Amen. Do you
[39:08] believe that? He he absolutely Amen. He
[39:11] didn't come born like we are. We're born
[39:13] in sin shaped iniquity. He come virgin
[39:15] born. But he had to receive the Holy
[39:18] Spirit. And when he received the Holy
[39:19] Spirit, he was led. And another place
[39:21] said driven out into the wilderness to
[39:24] be tempted and tried of the devil. And
[39:26] he conquered every bit of the devil for
[39:28] us. And so we created in him are more
[39:31] than conquerors.
[39:34] Amen. Amen. Now being created in him,
[39:38] the only way you can tell that you're
[39:39] created in him is that you've received
[39:41] the true baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[39:43] which places you in the body, which
[39:45] identifies you to be in him before the
[39:47] world began. You are that germ of life
[39:50] to be manifested and ministered to
[39:53] minister through in this hour in this
[39:55] day for this season. That's why the true
[39:59] identity is a revelation of the word for
[40:00] the season in you. The true identity of
[40:03] being a being a true seed of God and
[40:05] filled with the Holy Ghost is the true
[40:06] revelation of the word for this season
[40:09] in you lived out of you. Something you
[40:12] cannot do. It's done through you.
[40:15] You don't make to pump it up. You don't
[40:17] have to make it happen. God will work
[40:19] it. Why? Because you have the same mind.
[40:23] Amen. Amen. So let this mind be in you
[40:26] which was also in Christ Jesus who made
[40:28] was being in the form of God. Iorphy
[40:31] that's immorphy who being in the form of
[40:33] God thought it not robbery to be equal.
[40:36] Now let this mind be in you who being in
[40:39] the form of God. We don't think it's
[40:41] robbery to be equal with God. Amen.
[40:44] Hello. Can somebody say amen?
[40:49] We've got some scriptures here. You are
[40:51] equal with God. It's not robbery to be
[40:53] found equal with God because you came
[40:55] from his source. You came from the
[40:56] eternal. You were in the thought of the
[40:58] eternal. You were his thinking.
[41:01] Amen. He knew everything. But I'll tell
[41:03] you what his thoughts were was about
[41:04] you.
[41:06] Amen. Amen. And you existed in those
[41:09] thoughts. You were existing in him. You
[41:11] were you were substance in him. Amen. So
[41:15] he said he made himself of no
[41:17] reputation.
[41:18] The bride cares nothing about
[41:20] reputation. What she wants to know is
[41:22] him.
[41:24] She knows him. Not knows about him. We
[41:27] are to know him. To know him is
[41:29] different than knowing about him.
[41:32] Everybody knows about him. But there's
[41:34] very few that know him.
[41:36] Amen. Amen. All right. So he made
[41:41] himself of no reputation. took upon him
[41:43] the form of a servant. Brother, sister,
[41:45] I want you to know right now. You are
[41:48] sons of God. You're not a servant. You
[41:51] are sons to serve others.
[41:55] Did you know that? Now, the ministry,
[41:57] God made us a servant to serve you.
[42:01] But we are sons of God. Amen. We are not
[42:05] servants to God. The Bible never said we
[42:07] were servants. We act, we deal as we
[42:10] serve others.
[42:12] as a servant would. Amen. But you're not
[42:16] a servant. You're a son. The Bible said,
[42:19] "Now what f love the father has bestowed
[42:21] upon us that we should be called
[42:23] servants." No, we are called sons. A
[42:27] serv a son is above a servant.
[42:30] Amen. Amen. And so having this mind, let
[42:35] this mind be in you who being in the
[42:36] form of God think it not robbery to be
[42:38] equal with God.
[42:41] Amen. Now talk about a right mental
[42:43] attitude.
[42:45] Now watch as we go ahead here.
[42:48] Now so in faith is works expressed. He
[42:52] said he said this. Now I'm going to read
[42:54] some other scriptures here. Hold on. 1
[42:56] Corinthians 2.
[42:59] I'm in a hurry and I don't want to be in
[43:01] a hurry too fast here. 1 Corinthians
[43:03] chapter 2
[43:06] and verse 15. Now, we could read
[43:08] Corinthians 2 is very, very powerful
[43:11] chapter. 1 Corinthians 2. I love that
[43:14] chapter.
[43:16] It really identifies and places the
[43:17] bride where she's at. He said this verse
[43:21] 15, but he Let's back up to verse 14.
[43:24] But the natural man receiveth not the
[43:26] things of the spirit of God,
[43:29] for they are foolishness unto him,
[43:31] neither can he know them, because they
[43:34] are spiritually discerned. You can't
[43:36] have the discernment of these things
[43:38] unless you're born of the spirit of God.
[43:42] Amen. The true baptism of the Holy
[43:45] Spirit is being birthed into the body.
[43:47] And there in order to be truly born of
[43:49] God, there had to be a seed of God in
[43:51] you to be quickened.
[43:53] The prophet said, "You did not become
[43:54] seed by the rebirth. You were seed and
[43:58] therefore can be reborn."
[44:01] Amen. And you weren't just pl placed
[44:04] here. You were planted here.
[44:06] Amen. Not just scattered here. You were
[44:08] planted here to a specific purpose, a
[44:11] specific uh position in the body
[44:15] to to manifest the word for the season
[44:17] because you are the word for the season.
[44:21] Amen.
[44:23] Now,
[44:25] but he that is spiritual. Verse 15, but
[44:28] he that is spiritual. Is there anybody
[44:30] here that's spiritual? Satan wants to
[44:33] beat that all the time because there he
[44:35] because he's trying to get you to look
[44:37] at your outer man. He's not talking
[44:39] about the outer man here. He's talking
[44:41] about the birth word. He that is
[44:43] spiritual. What's spiritual?
[44:46] The word is spiritual. The word unveiled
[44:48] in you is spiritual. The new birth,
[44:51] Jesus Christ, the new birth revealed in
[44:53] you is that spiritual man.
[44:56] Amen. So he that is spiritual, what
[44:59] makes you spiritual is having the mind
[45:01] of God. All right? So, but he that is
[45:04] spiritual judgeth all things.
[45:08] Yet he himself is judged of what? God.
[45:12] No, he himself is judged of no man.
[45:18] Amen. All right. For who hath known the
[45:22] mind of the Lord? that there that mind
[45:25] is who hath known the spirit of the
[45:29] Lord.
[45:31] Who hath known the mind of the Lord that
[45:34] he may instruct him.
[45:38] Okay? But we have the mind
[45:42] of Christ. So all that God was, he
[45:45] poured into Christ. And all that Christ
[45:47] was, he's poured into. And all that he
[45:50] was is poured into. All that he was is
[45:55] poured into his bride.
[46:01] So what are we now? What are we? We are
[46:03] the expression of himself.
[46:07] We are himself in another form. It's not
[46:10] another person. It's just the person in
[46:12] another form.
[46:14] This is another act. This act is Christ
[46:18] himself, the bride coming of Christ.
[46:20] Amen. You may be seated. I'm sorry. I
[46:22] could preach here with you standing
[46:25] because I'm standing.
[46:28] Thank you.
[46:31] He said in St. John, let's go to St.
[46:34] John 5:30.
[46:41] But we have the mind
[46:44] of Christ.
[46:49] St. John 5. I didn't have time to even
[46:52] mark these out. So if I'm turning while
[46:55] you're turning, that's good. St. John
[46:57] 5:30.
[47:02] I can of myself do nothing. Let's just
[47:06] stop here and go to verse 17 first. Said
[47:09] Jesus answered them, my father worketh
[47:11] hitherto and I work.
[47:15] He couldn't work until God worked.
[47:19] I wonder who has that mind.
[47:23] Amen.
[47:24] My father were Jesus said my father
[47:26] worketh hither to. That means at this
[47:28] moment whatever that moment was at that
[47:30] moment my father worketh hitherto and I
[47:34] work.
[47:36] All right. St. John 14:12 said he that
[47:38] believeth in me the works that I do. So
[47:42] what he didn't say the works I did I
[47:44] did. He said the works I do. That's
[47:47] present tense. So he had to be in you to
[47:50] do those works. So he's ordained you to
[47:53] certain works. Then let him do it. He
[47:55] said he would do it. Is that right? All
[47:57] right. Then then it's not for us to
[48:00] produce works. It's him producing the
[48:02] works in us. But how's that going to
[48:04] happen when you let go and let him have
[48:06] his way?
[48:09] And remember they asked him, "What can
[48:10] we do to do the works of God?" And he
[48:12] said, "To do the works of God is to
[48:14] believe on him whom God has sent."
[48:17] Then we know that God sent his word in
[48:20] this hour. If we believe on him whom God
[48:22] has sent, we will do the works of God.
[48:27] Amen. Because you cannot believe on him
[48:28] whom God has sent unless the one that
[48:30] sent him is in you.
[48:34] Amen. All right. We're going to go on
[48:37] these more of these scriptures. That's
[48:38] so in St. John 5:30 he said I can do
[48:40] nothing of I of my own self can do
[48:44] nothing as I hear I judge
[48:49] that word here is not ears here it's
[48:52] here as I hear receive
[48:55] amen who can receive the word for the
[48:57] hour only one only one
[49:01] individual body that's the bride she's
[49:04] the only one that can receive and hear
[49:06] the word for the season because she was
[49:09] in his thoughts before the foundation of
[49:11] the world to be in this season.
[49:15] Amen. Amen. So, so others can't receive
[49:19] it because they weren't in in in his
[49:21] thoughts.
[49:24] I'm not talking about salvation. I'm
[49:25] talking about I'm talking about bride
[49:27] material.
[49:29] Amen. All right. because there going to
[49:32] be others saved that won't be in the
[49:34] rapture, but they will come up at the
[49:36] white throne judgment and they are
[49:38] called the righteous in the Bible and
[49:40] they by their works will be judged in
[49:42] the if they're found in the book of
[49:44] life, they will be given life. But the
[49:47] bride's not standing before him there.
[49:49] She has a she has I'll just say this
[49:51] right now. We know that she has a throne
[49:54] to stand before, but that isn't for
[49:57] judgment whether and whether cast out or
[49:59] not cast out. That's for reward
[50:02] because you give an account for what
[50:04] you've done in this life. Amen. That
[50:08] doesn't pertain to salvation. You're not
[50:10] going to stand there and not have
[50:12] salvation.
[50:15] Amen. But you may not get the reward.
[50:17] You can be Paul said, "I I could if I
[50:20] don't run if I don't so run correctly
[50:22] and bring my body under obedience to
[50:24] this word." He said, "I could be a cast
[50:27] away." That's not cast away, cast out
[50:29] and cast away from God. That's just lose
[50:32] his reward. He didn't run like he should
[50:35] have run to receive it. Hello.
[50:40] All right. Now, that's that's deep. And
[50:42] we could go back and we could pick that
[50:44] up where the prophet said that. All
[50:46] right. Now,
[50:48] so he said, "I can my own self do
[50:50] nothing. As I hear, I judge and my
[50:52] judgment is just because I seek not my
[50:56] own will." Now, we're talking about
[50:58] having this same mind. So, what are we
[51:01] going to say about this bride which is
[51:02] himself?
[51:04] We're going to say about the bride that
[51:06] the bride doesn't have her own mind.
[51:08] She's seeking the will of God. She is
[51:10] absolutely she she said and she can only
[51:14] judge as she hears. How's she judging?
[51:16] She's judging herself by what she hears.
[51:18] By hearing the word and receiving the
[51:20] word, what's she doing? The Bible said,
[51:22] "Judge yourself."
[51:24] Amen. They're not talking about going
[51:25] out and judge everybody else. You just
[51:27] judge yourself by the word. Amen. Judge
[51:31] it. Judge everything you do according to
[51:33] the word. All right. Now he said, "So
[51:37] because I seek not my own will, but the
[51:40] will of the father which has sent me
[51:44] having this mind, who sent you? Who
[51:46] brought you here? Who set you in this
[51:49] neighborhood? Who set you in this
[51:50] valley? Who set us in this? Why are you
[51:53] sitting here tonight? Because he brought
[51:56] you here. If you just come to be seen,
[51:58] if you just come to do works, well then
[52:00] you probably need to have a change. But
[52:03] you've come because you love the word
[52:06] because you want more of God. Because
[52:08] it's not just a duty. We can come to be
[52:11] many, many, many people in this message
[52:13] just come to church as a duty and never
[52:15] have eternal life.
[52:19] Amen. But we come because we love the
[52:22] word. We want the word. We want to hear
[52:24] the word. It's in us to be here.
[52:28] Amen. Amen. Amen. That's exactly right.
[52:32] So he said, "Because I seek not my own
[52:34] will." So if that was his mind, that was
[52:37] his nature. What about us? We're not out
[52:40] here to seek our own will either. Now
[52:42] brother, sister, I'm talking about we're
[52:44] growing up. We're talking about
[52:46] maturity. We're coming to a maturity
[52:48] here. We realize what we are, who we
[52:50] are, and been and that we have been
[52:52] positionally and are positionally placed
[52:54] in Christ. That's our position.
[52:59] See, that speaks so contrary to the
[53:01] human understanding that it looks
[53:03] ridiculous and it is ridiculous to the
[53:06] carnal believer because you're going to
[53:07] say, "Who do you think you are?" Well,
[53:09] don't I don't who I think I am. It's
[53:11] what I know I am.
[53:15] Amen. Amen. We're not boasting of this.
[53:17] We just simply live the word. We don't
[53:20] go out and start boasting. Look who I
[53:21] am. Look who I am. No. No. He never made
[53:23] himself of reputation. He simply gave
[53:26] himself over to the word and God worked
[53:28] through him and he worked. That's right.
[53:32] Amen. Because the Bible says very
[53:34] clearly in Philippians 2:13 that it's
[53:36] God which workketh in you.
[53:39] Amen. Is that right? Philippians 2:13
[53:41] said, "For it is God which workketh in
[53:43] you,
[53:45] both to will and to do of his good
[53:47] pleasure. Therefore, quit your
[53:49] murmuring."
[53:52] Next verse, verse for 14, and then verse
[53:57] 16 says, "Holding forth the word of
[53:59] life."
[54:01] Amen. A right mental attitude.
[54:04] Holding forth the word of life that I've
[54:06] not run in vain nor labored in vain.
[54:09] holding it forth. What's going what's
[54:11] before you? What are you seeking? I just
[54:13] said here Jesus said, "I seek not my own
[54:16] will but the will of the father which
[54:18] has sent me." What are you seeking?
[54:23] There's See, the word is absolutely
[54:25] flawless. The will of the father was his
[54:28] word. And the word is flawless. It's
[54:31] it's beyond our term of perfect. It's
[54:33] actually beyond our term of flawless.
[54:36] But it's flawless.
[54:38] There's no flaw in it. There's not a
[54:39] spot in it. It's perfect because it's
[54:41] eternal. And there's only one form of
[54:44] eternal, and that's God.
[54:46] Amen. So, if you have his mind and be
[54:49] equal with God, you're equal with the
[54:51] eternal because the the prophet said and
[54:53] the Bible said we are his eternal
[54:55] possession. We didn't know that was
[54:57] hidden in the word until the seals
[54:59] opened. Amen. We didn't know that we
[55:02] were the ones that he spoke to. We
[55:04] didn't realize that that Christ being in
[55:06] us and Christ being the the Bible being
[55:08] the complete revelation of Christ. Now
[55:11] we come to oursel and realize the
[55:13] complete the the the the total having
[55:16] him in us makes us the complete
[55:18] revelation of the whole thing.
[55:20] Talk about a mystery unveiled.
[55:24] See, Satan would have liked to got a
[55:25] hold of that thought, but God kept that
[55:27] thought hid. Yet it was in his word, but
[55:29] he kept it hid. Yes. When when when God
[55:32] told Abra Adam to uh to to um
[55:38] to to uh
[55:43] to bring forth to bring forth children.
[55:46] I just have I can't think of the word I
[55:47] want to use. You know what I'm referring
[55:49] to in Genesis 1?
[55:51] Replenish the earth. Yes. Okay. Then
[55:55] Satan got a hold of that. Yeah. Here
[55:58] come one that came out of him, a
[56:00] byproduct,
[56:02] and said, 'Well, I'll just Satan's
[56:04] brother said he's always trying to jump
[56:06] ahead and pervert it if he can pervert
[56:09] what God has in his mind to do. And he
[56:12] heard that and he said, "Well, I I'll
[56:14] just I'll just get her to bear bear
[56:18] children. I'll get there first before
[56:19] Adam does."
[56:22] But Adam's command was stand behind the
[56:24] word. Stay behind that. don't partake of
[56:26] that tree of knowledge
[56:29] of good and evil. But she lusted to know
[56:31] what God meant.
[56:33] And so Satan reasoned with her and she
[56:35] broke through the wall of that word. As
[56:38] long as you stay behind your fortress
[56:40] that God has placed you under and
[56:42] behind, which is an eternal word. Why'd
[56:44] he put you there? Because his word's
[56:46] eternal. You stay behind there. It takes
[56:48] a right mental attitude to stay behind
[56:51] there. When you stay behind there and
[56:53] quit your reasoning with your feelings,
[56:55] reasoning with your ideas, reasoning
[56:57] with what other people say, and don't do
[56:59] that and just take the word and believe
[57:01] it and go on. Don't add to it. Don't add
[57:04] take away from it. Don't converse with
[57:07] the enemy. The Bible said it. You say
[57:09] it's written. And that's all you need to
[57:11] do. Stand behind that. And there's
[57:13] absolutely no way for Satan to punch
[57:15] through that word.
[57:19] Amen. He can't do it. Amen. And we're
[57:22] going to come to that in just a few
[57:23] minutes here.
[57:25] All right. Now, so so but so when this
[57:29] word,
[57:31] when this mind is directed from the
[57:33] inside, when when it's directed,
[57:37] the attitude is directed from the
[57:39] inside, the soul that comes from God is
[57:42] the thought of God. It throws all the
[57:44] rest of it together. That's the
[57:46] guidepost. That's the control tower. the
[57:48] inside of the inside. Now watch the soul
[57:53] and we're speaking to bride here. We're
[57:55] talking we're talking to because she's
[57:57] the word on the inside opened.
[58:00] She is the opened word.
[58:03] Amen. She is what God had in his mind
[58:06] and put in a word and expressed it.
[58:10] That's the mystery. That's the secret
[58:12] that's in the bride. Only in the bride
[58:14] is the word is in the bride. Amen. All
[58:16] right. So, so, so that's the control
[58:20] tower. The inside of the inside, the
[58:22] soul controls the spirit. That's the
[58:24] little spirit. That's your middleman.
[58:27] That's your mind. That's where the
[58:29] battleground is. That's where the battle
[58:32] takes place. Satan chose the mind. God
[58:34] chose the heart. And I just said where
[58:37] the control room is for the bride is the
[58:40] soul. It's that third realm. It's that
[58:43] inside the inside. That's who you are.
[58:45] That's that's what God recognizes.
[58:47] That's you're identified to be that.
[58:49] Amen. Amen. All right. So being that
[58:53] right there, that's the control tower.
[58:55] The inside, the soul controls the spirit
[58:58] and the spirit controls the body.
[59:02] So if the bo if the spirit is brought
[59:04] under the obedience of the word,
[59:07] what's the body going to do? The body
[59:09] can't do anything but manifest the word.
[59:12] Because he Romans 8:11 said, "If the
[59:14] spirit of God dwells in you,
[59:18] he that quick if if the spirit
[59:24] Romans 8:11, that's what just a minute.
[59:26] I just went into a blank right there. I
[59:28] know that by heart.
[59:31] If the spirit that raised Jesus from the
[59:33] dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[59:35] Christ shall also
[59:38] Where where's Christ raised up?" in you.
[59:42] It's a resurrection in you. The sun is
[59:45] up. Where' the sun rise? Where's the sun
[59:47] rising? The sun, Brother Bram said, now
[59:49] he said it's rising. He said it's up.
[59:51] Where is it? It's in bride form. Amen.
[59:55] Amen. Where is the sun rising? What's
[59:57] the promise? What's the promise of the
[59:59] hour? It's because what is the promise?
[1:00:01] You're that open book. Now, I'm coming
[1:00:03] into another message and I have to back
[1:00:04] off, but that's what it is.
[1:00:09] All right. But so so
[1:00:14] the so that spirit that controls if the
[1:00:17] if that spirit's in you raised up Christ
[1:00:19] shall also do what? Bring your body by
[1:00:22] that same spirit bring your body under
[1:00:24] obedience to his word. Not only will it
[1:00:27] change it, not only will it it raise it
[1:00:29] up if it goes to the grave, but he said
[1:00:32] he'll also right now right at at the
[1:00:35] this day this time he's going to bring
[1:00:37] it subject to the word. That's his
[1:00:39] promise. Amen. And you can depend on
[1:00:41] that. Do you believe it? Amen. Then give
[1:00:44] it a right mental attitude. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:47] Is that right? Then then he said that he
[1:00:50] promised that. Then you just need to let
[1:00:53] go and let him do it. If you believe it,
[1:00:55] then take him at his word and quit
[1:00:57] complaining about anything and start
[1:00:59] praising him for what he said he's
[1:01:00] doing. Whether you feel it or don't feel
[1:01:03] it, your feelings, your reasoning, and
[1:01:05] your senses out here do not declare. You
[1:01:08] do not meet God through these senses.
[1:01:10] You meet God through his faith. And
[1:01:13] faith takes its resting place in the
[1:01:15] word of God.
[1:01:17] All right. So, so he said here, now
[1:01:20] let's let's go let's go to another
[1:01:22] scripture. St. John 6:50. No, not 6
[1:01:26] 7:29. I'll bypass for time on that one.
[1:01:29] 7:29. St. John 7:29. But I know him.
[1:01:34] Jesus speaking. But I know him for I ca
[1:01:38] I am from him and he has sent me.
[1:01:43] Now is that word the same today? Where
[1:01:47] is he today? Where's Jesus today? Jesus
[1:01:50] speaking. Where is he speaking today?
[1:01:52] Where is this final voice? Where is his
[1:01:56] voice?
[1:01:57] Is that right? Then what is the bride
[1:01:59] going to say? But I know him.
[1:02:02] But I know him. For I ca I am from him.
[1:02:07] The prophet said, "This little bride
[1:02:08] came from the same source."
[1:02:12] Amen. She She came from the same source
[1:02:15] and is one with him. And he that sent
[1:02:18] her goes in her.
[1:02:20] Amen. He that sent you goes in you. He
[1:02:24] that sent Jesus went in him. He that
[1:02:26] sent you goes in you. Having the same
[1:02:29] mind, let the mind that was in Christ
[1:02:32] Jesus. Yes.
[1:02:35] Who being in the form of God, thought it
[1:02:37] not robbery to be equal with God. You
[1:02:39] came from the same source.
[1:02:42] You see, we're You see, Brother David,
[1:02:43] you're getting pretty bold on declaring
[1:02:45] who you are. Why? We know your failures.
[1:02:47] We know your mistakes. And I'm going to
[1:02:48] tell you, you're going to make mistakes
[1:02:50] in this old man out here. Clear up until
[1:02:52] the time you have a change.
[1:02:56] Because you have a carnal, sticky nature
[1:02:57] that's against the word. Yeah, you have
[1:03:00] a carnal, sticky nature that's going to
[1:03:02] bother you until you release this old
[1:03:04] this old man out here, which is
[1:03:06] released. The Bible said it's released.
[1:03:08] So, how are we walking? We're living and
[1:03:10] walking by faith in what he said. Reckon
[1:03:12] yourself dead indeed unto sin and alive
[1:03:15] in Christ. And bring your body subject
[1:03:18] to that word and and and bring your you
[1:03:21] rule over your body. You're sent forth
[1:03:23] the king. You rule over your members.
[1:03:26] Amen. That's your place. God's expecting
[1:03:29] you to do that. I've given you my word.
[1:03:32] I've come in you. I have given you the
[1:03:34] authority. Now you speak. You go
[1:03:36] forward. You announce. You say it. You
[1:03:39] live it. You take my word. And you say
[1:03:42] it's written. And quit your belly aching
[1:03:44] and complaining because the devil's
[1:03:46] trying to beat you down. Why don't you
[1:03:47] just take the word and come back with
[1:03:49] it? It is written. And stand right
[1:03:50] there. He can't do anything about it as
[1:03:53] long as you're positionally placed
[1:03:55] behind the word.
[1:03:59] Hallelujah.
[1:04:01] Amen. All right. Now, now, now, Satan,
[1:04:04] you're not going to do that.
[1:04:07] That catch in my back. I rebuke that
[1:04:09] thing. You know what I'm going to say to
[1:04:11] him? It's written.
[1:04:14] I'm healed by the stripes of the Lord
[1:04:16] Jesus. I don't have what you're telling
[1:04:18] me I have. I don't have it because I'm
[1:04:20] healed by it. Amen. So God is my
[1:04:23] strength. Oh may a I mean amen. Oh me.
[1:04:27] Oh my. Amen. Amen. I'm not trying to
[1:04:30] speak in tongues. That's just all right.
[1:04:33] All right. First Corinthians. I already
[1:04:35] read that. Okay. Where am I here now?
[1:04:39] All right. Now, okay. Colossians. Let's
[1:04:41] go one. Okay. 7:29. That's what I read.
[1:04:44] Okay. He has sent me. Okay. And then see
[1:04:47] we've come from the same source. The
[1:04:49] prophet said we've come we came from the
[1:04:51] same source eternal with him. We were
[1:04:54] his thoughts and those thoughts are
[1:04:56] eternal. And he said if you can see that
[1:04:58] those thoughts are eternal. He said
[1:05:00] you'll see a lot of mighty things.
[1:05:04] Amen. Because you realize where you come
[1:05:07] from and who sent you and where you're
[1:05:10] standing today. Right. You say, "I just
[1:05:13] don't know what you're talking about. I
[1:05:14] can't figure it out." You need to quit
[1:05:16] trying to figure out anything.
[1:05:20] You can't figure it out. In fact, I
[1:05:21] can't even explain to you what I'm
[1:05:23] talking about.
[1:05:25] Because you know what? Well, you say,
[1:05:27] "Oh my, nobody understands me." I'll
[1:05:28] just hit the quote before I read it.
[1:05:30] Nobody understands me. Right. That's
[1:05:33] correct. Truth.
[1:05:36] Nobody understands you, Brother David.
[1:05:38] Right. You're right. Exactly right. In
[1:05:39] fact, I don't understand myself.
[1:05:43] Right. Who can fathom the mind of God?
[1:05:46] And yet I have his mind. Amen. Amen. Is
[1:05:49] that right? That's right. But what what
[1:05:52] do I have? I have his spirit in me. And
[1:05:56] he'll reveal to me what I need to know
[1:05:57] when I need to know it. Amen. And I'll
[1:06:00] work. Yeah. You can't explain who you
[1:06:04] are. You can't explain how You can't
[1:06:06] explain how these things happen. You
[1:06:09] can't do it.
[1:06:12] If you think you can, it's not faith. I
[1:06:14] guarantee you, you don't have faith.
[1:06:17] You're trying to gain knowledge, right?
[1:06:20] God never gave you knowledge to serve
[1:06:22] him. He gave you faith to serve him.
[1:06:24] There is a knowledge of God. Don't get
[1:06:25] me wrong. But I'm talking about what
[1:06:27] what brother Brandham said, wisdom
[1:06:29] versus faith.
[1:06:31] Amen. Are you right? What what the what
[1:06:34] what everyone needs and must have and
[1:06:36] the bride will have is a new birth.
[1:06:38] Yeah. She's got the seed there to be
[1:06:40] quickened. Yeah, the seed is laying in
[1:06:42] her. And when that seed's quickened,
[1:06:44] it's a revelation and continues to be a
[1:06:46] revelation. He leads us into all truth.
[1:06:48] And when you see that, you've been
[1:06:49] identified to be in him.
[1:06:52] Amen. There's one identification that
[1:06:54] the only difference between Cain and
[1:06:55] Abel is that Abel had revelation of the
[1:06:57] will of God. Right?
[1:07:00] Cain didn't.
[1:07:02] Brother Bam said that was the
[1:07:03] difference.
[1:07:06] Amen. Because you don't you don't work
[1:07:08] yourself up to revelation. Revelation
[1:07:10] comes by hearing the word.
[1:07:13] Amen. Faith comes by hearing the word.
[1:07:15] All right, I'm getting off on another
[1:07:17] area here. So, let's keep going. It's
[1:07:19] the same area, but I've just got to stay
[1:07:21] here. Let's go to 2021. John 20:21.
[1:07:26] And it says basically the same right
[1:07:28] thing. And I could bypass it, but I'll
[1:07:29] read it. 2021 said, "Then Jesus said to
[1:07:33] them again, peace be unto you." Yeah.
[1:07:35] Because I want to take another scripture
[1:07:37] speaking of peace. Peace be unto you.
[1:07:40] Isn't that lovely? What about you and I?
[1:07:44] Peace be unto you. Well, I don't feel
[1:07:47] like I have peace. Quit your wondering
[1:07:49] of and reasoning with your feelings.
[1:07:51] That's exactly what the devil's doing to
[1:07:53] you. What did the word say about your
[1:07:56] feelings? What did the word say about
[1:07:58] that peace?
[1:08:03] You see right where it is, don't you?
[1:08:05] So, what do you come back with? I rebuke
[1:08:07] you, Satan. and I rebuke you. Don't
[1:08:08] tantalize that rattlesnake. He'll strike
[1:08:10] and bite you.
[1:08:12] All you do is just stand behind the
[1:08:14] word. It is written, "This is my
[1:08:17] fortress. This is the answer." And I'm
[1:08:20] going forth giving God the glory and
[1:08:22] praise that he's already given me the
[1:08:25] promise and he'll and he'll manifest
[1:08:27] that promise because I'm standing on the
[1:08:29] promise. Amen. Well, when when will you
[1:08:31] do it? That's none of your business. But
[1:08:34] he'll do it on a perfect time, at a
[1:08:35] perfect place, and a perfect season. All
[1:08:37] you need to do is follow. Yes. He said,
[1:08:40] "My father worketh hitherto, then I
[1:08:42] work." Jesus could do nothing until the
[1:08:45] father showed him. Do you realize that?
[1:08:48] And he said, "This same harmony will
[1:08:50] exist between him and his bride. He she
[1:08:53] and you and I can do nothing until God
[1:08:55] shows us."
[1:08:58] Amen. Oh, you said, "Well, I don't have
[1:09:00] to wait on God. I just go out and do No,
[1:09:02] that's not what the Bible said. You
[1:09:04] don't have to go out and seek works. Let
[1:09:06] him manifest the works.
[1:09:09] Amen. All right. Now, so just so we get
[1:09:13] the right. Okay. Now,
[1:09:16] so the Jesus now he said, "Has my father
[1:09:19] sent me even so send I you."
[1:09:24] All right. So So he that sent you goes
[1:09:26] in you.
[1:09:28] So you you answer this question. He sent
[1:09:30] you. How made say yes he sent me
[1:09:34] then where is he
[1:09:38] then what there's where is there fear to
[1:09:41] that the love of God's been expressed to
[1:09:43] you you have that perfect love not a fe
[1:09:46] we're not talking about felioh human
[1:09:48] love we're talking about a higher love
[1:09:50] we're talking about a love that takes
[1:09:51] the word and says it's so
[1:09:55] amen that's right all right so
[1:09:59] now if I just keep walking back and
[1:10:00] forth Here I take up time. There's how
[1:10:02] many seconds to do that? And seconds
[1:10:03] mean time. So Colossians 3:15. Let's go
[1:10:07] over there. Colossians 3:15.
[1:10:12] I want to get down the meat of this so I
[1:10:13] can quit. Close. That better. That's a
[1:10:16] better word because you'll never quit.
[1:10:23] Colossians 3:15.
[1:10:29] And let
[1:10:31] verse 14 above all these things put on
[1:10:34] charity which is the bond of perfectness
[1:10:40] and let here again and let the peace of
[1:10:44] God rule in your heart
[1:10:51] to the which also you are called in one
[1:10:54] body and be ye thankful. Where are you
[1:10:58] called? In one body.
[1:11:02] And be ye thankful
[1:11:04] that you are positionally placed in
[1:11:06] Christ. Being born again.
[1:11:11] Amen. So being born again identifies you
[1:11:14] as a true believer. A lot of people say
[1:11:16] they believe. That doesn't put them in
[1:11:18] the body, right? But a true believer
[1:11:22] being the seed of God. Amen. That seed
[1:11:25] of God quickened in you will lead you
[1:11:28] into all truth.
[1:11:31] Talk about identification.
[1:11:34] Amen. When he the spirit of truth has
[1:11:37] come, he will lead you into all truth.
[1:11:39] Who's the spirit of truth? What sent
[1:11:41] Jesus go in in him? He that sends you
[1:11:43] goes in you. It's your comfort.
[1:11:48] All right.
[1:11:49] So let the peace of God rule. To let it
[1:11:51] rule. What is this peace of God? What is
[1:11:53] this rule he's talking about? Let it
[1:11:55] rule. It means let it umpire.
[1:11:59] Let it decide. Let it direct and
[1:12:01] control. Let it determine. Let it rule.
[1:12:05] So when an umpire in a ball game says
[1:12:08] it's a strike and you don't believe
[1:12:09] that, what are you going to do about it?
[1:12:12] Well, I don't believe it was I believe
[1:12:14] it was a ball. Well, he said strike.
[1:12:16] There's got to be an absolute to that
[1:12:18] game.
[1:12:21] All right.
[1:12:23] There is an absolute message absolute
[1:12:26] 631 1201 he said there is an absolute in
[1:12:28] a ball game that's the umpire right if
[1:12:30] he said it's a strike that's what it is
[1:12:32] don't care what you say what I think way
[1:12:34] I saw it the way you saw it it's what he
[1:12:37] said it's absolute
[1:12:40] if he says strike you have to agree with
[1:12:42] it because that's the way it's going to
[1:12:44] be wrote up strike what if there's no
[1:12:47] umpire who would be right one said it
[1:12:49] was a strike the other said it's no
[1:12:50] strike it was a ball you start pulling
[1:12:52] out hair, you start having chaos and
[1:12:54] that's the end of the game.
[1:12:58] How do we run? Paul said, "So run.
[1:13:02] We hold our body. Bring it in
[1:13:04] subjection." I could read you 1
[1:13:05] Corinthians 9, but you know what I'm
[1:13:07] referring to.
[1:13:09] Bring my body under obedience. Said,
[1:13:11] "Bring it under subjection." He even
[1:13:13] called it beating it into subjection.
[1:13:16] Is that right?
[1:13:18] All right. What are you doing? You're
[1:13:20] bringing it under the word. The only way
[1:13:22] you can run this race is by the word.
[1:13:24] It's through the word.
[1:13:26] The mind of God was the word. The mind
[1:13:28] of God was the word living. The prophet
[1:13:30] said this about the bride shall be the
[1:13:32] word living
[1:13:34] and inaction. So the word is quick and
[1:13:38] powerful. It's it's in action.
[1:13:41] Living and operative. The word is living
[1:13:43] and operative.
[1:13:45] That's the mind of God that's in you.
[1:13:47] It's living and operative. It it
[1:13:50] reveals. It opens it up when you least
[1:13:52] expect it. You didn't pump it up. You
[1:13:54] didn't make it happen. God opened it.
[1:13:56] God reveals it. He said he would and he
[1:13:58] does. That's sovereignty. That's grace.
[1:14:03] That right? We don't go out and and
[1:14:06] commit things the word says don't do
[1:14:08] because we have grace and know you
[1:14:10] shouldn't do it. Right. And then go out
[1:14:12] and do it anyway because I have grace to
[1:14:14] do it. No, that would not be right. when
[1:14:17] he said to do a certain thing and you
[1:14:19] know not to do it. Well, I can do it
[1:14:21] anyway. You know what that is? That's
[1:14:23] called Calvinism.
[1:14:25] Yeah,
[1:14:27] that's right. And the other one says,
[1:14:28] "Oh, I don't dare do that. I can't do
[1:14:30] that. Why? My my." You know, and then it
[1:14:32] becomes a works affair. Then it becomes
[1:14:34] Armenianism.
[1:14:39] But God in you is neither one. He's the
[1:14:42] word living.
[1:14:44] And when he lives, he discerns. He
[1:14:47] quickens. He directs. He works.
[1:14:51] So what are you going to do about it?
[1:14:52] Put your hand in his and let go.
[1:14:55] I I put your hand in, let go. No, hold
[1:14:57] on to it. But I'm saying give over to
[1:14:59] him. Give yourself to him. Quit trying
[1:15:02] to figure it out. Quit trying to reason
[1:15:04] with the devil. You know you can't get
[1:15:06] well. You know you did this. You've done
[1:15:07] that. You know you got to have this
[1:15:08] surgery and that surgery. You know this
[1:15:10] has got to happen. Who says so? That's
[1:15:12] right. Amen.
[1:15:15] Right. I mean, here's a doctor here, a
[1:15:17] surgeon. But I don't if I need surgery,
[1:15:20] I trust a doctor. God will lead that
[1:15:22] doctor to do what I need. But I also
[1:15:25] believe that God can keep me out of it.
[1:15:30] I've seen him do it.
[1:15:32] All right. You know, God's practically
[1:15:35] answering prayer every day for things.
[1:15:39] Amen. But don't put any of those things
[1:15:42] as being evidences. It's the spirit
[1:15:44] doing it without a doubt. But the
[1:15:46] evidence that you're a true believer is
[1:15:47] that the word's opened in you. Amen.
[1:15:51] You have an ability to hear and receive
[1:15:53] the word for the season and a true
[1:15:55] understanding, clear understanding of
[1:15:56] it. And it lives itself. You don't have
[1:15:59] to go live it. That's right. See, a lot
[1:16:02] of them are aimed at. They aimed at they
[1:16:04] were baptized. They were And this is
[1:16:05] another message. I'm just going to speak
[1:16:07] it real this real shortly. They aim at
[1:16:09] and then relax. Now that's a different
[1:16:11] word relax than I preached the Wednesday
[1:16:13] before. Really the word relax in was
[1:16:16] release.
[1:16:18] You release yourself. But this relaxes
[1:16:21] they become relaxed. In the Ephesian age
[1:16:23] they aimed at they were aimed at the
[1:16:24] right thing. Then then they relaxed and
[1:16:26] never went on to take God at what God
[1:16:29] said he would do and that's fill them.
[1:16:31] They thought it was okay because they
[1:16:33] could shout and they could dance under
[1:16:34] sanctification.
[1:16:37] Amen. You say, "Is that so?" Oh my. Yes.
[1:16:39] She ought to see the old Nazarines dance
[1:16:41] and shout and roll on the floor. Right.
[1:16:44] I was I'm old enough to remember that.
[1:16:47] Right.
[1:16:49] I hear Paul say him, too.
[1:16:54] That's all right. I don't mind that. I'm
[1:16:57] just closer home. I'm closer in age-
[1:16:59] wise than he is to get home.
[1:17:02] And yet either one of us could go
[1:17:04] tonight.
[1:17:05] So what? I can't go until it's done.
[1:17:08] That's right. I have his mind.
[1:17:11] I came from him. I'm led by him. He's
[1:17:13] guiding me. I rest in that. His word is
[1:17:16] perfect. Why? Every day I see that every
[1:17:18] day. God's never failed to have new
[1:17:21] mercies for me every day. Known making
[1:17:23] himself known, revealing himself every
[1:17:26] single day.
[1:17:28] You know what? I depend on it
[1:17:32] because he said so. His mercies are new
[1:17:35] every morning.
[1:17:37] All right, I'm going off. Let me keep
[1:17:40] moving here. All right, let's go to So,
[1:17:43] let him direct. Let him umpire. So, let
[1:17:46] him Now, I I got to a point there I
[1:17:47] wanted to get to on that baseball. Okay,
[1:17:49] now if he Okay, so he says strike is
[1:17:52] strike. It's a ball. Why? We would have
[1:17:54] chaos if you didn't have an umpire. You
[1:17:56] wouldn't know what to do. And then he
[1:17:58] says there's got to be somewhere that
[1:18:00] somebody's word is final. Amen. I feel
[1:18:03] real good right now. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:18:06] There's got to be something that's
[1:18:08] final. I'm so glad of that. Oh, how
[1:18:10] there's somebody who can say it's sin or
[1:18:13] not sin. I'm so glad of that. I'm glad
[1:18:15] for an absolute. No arguing. No need of
[1:18:17] arguing. The umpire said strike and
[1:18:19] that's what it is. He what? See the
[1:18:22] peace of God. Let it rule.
[1:18:25] Amen. What's the peace of God do? Hold
[1:18:28] you steady in the word. Where's your
[1:18:29] peace lay? In the word. All right. The
[1:18:32] word of who? The word of God. All right.
[1:18:35] All right. See, you came from that. You
[1:18:37] came from the source of that.
[1:18:40] And when he put his thoughts into word,
[1:18:42] there you are. You're revealed and hid
[1:18:44] in this book. And this hour, it opened
[1:18:46] up who you are. That's why we're going
[1:18:49] home in a body change one day here. Or
[1:18:52] if we go ahead of time, the theophony
[1:18:55] will just come and pick up the body.
[1:18:58] That's right.
[1:19:00] A lot could be said on those things, but
[1:19:02] we just bypass it. He said, "So if he
[1:19:05] says it's strike, that's what it is."
[1:19:08] Now watch what he says. Mark it up in
[1:19:10] your mind.
[1:19:12] It's a strike and go on. What's he
[1:19:15] saying here? If God says it's this way,
[1:19:18] mark it up in your mind. Bring your
[1:19:20] bring that battlefield under obedience
[1:19:22] to the word
[1:19:24] and settle it there and go on. Don't
[1:19:28] reason with the enemy.
[1:19:31] You stay behind the wall of the word.
[1:19:33] You stay behind the word. That is your
[1:19:36] fortress. That is your place. That is
[1:19:39] your ordained position. Yes. Amen. Hey,
[1:19:43] we're not going to do what Eve did. She
[1:19:45] went out and reasoned with the devil.
[1:19:46] See?
[1:19:48] See, it looks and reasoning looks more
[1:19:50] beautiful. It looks more reasonable.
[1:19:53] But the word is eternal.
[1:19:57] There's nothing can stop it. There's
[1:19:59] nothing can hinder it. It's God's word.
[1:20:02] Let this mind be in you. You are the
[1:20:06] word living. That's why nothing can turn
[1:20:09] you from the word because you came from
[1:20:11] the word and a part of the word.
[1:20:14] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. You can't be
[1:20:18] something you're not. You are going to
[1:20:19] be what you are and you'll grow up into
[1:20:21] that stature.
[1:20:24] Now, so we're going to bypass some of
[1:20:26] these things here,
[1:20:28] but after you become a Christian, and
[1:20:30] and by the way, a true Christian means
[1:20:33] that you're tabernacling deity. You
[1:20:36] know, the prophet identified a Christian
[1:20:37] as tabernacling deity, not just people
[1:20:40] saying, "I'm a Christian." But a
[1:20:42] Christian is Christlike,
[1:20:44] has the life of Christ living in them.
[1:20:47] The prophet said, "A Christian tabern is
[1:20:49] one that tabernacles deity." All right?
[1:20:53] But after you become a Christian, then
[1:20:54] you are fortified by the word and any
[1:20:56] promise in the word. He said,"I didn't
[1:21:00] know I was going to say that." See, you
[1:21:02] are when you become a Christian, you're
[1:21:04] placed behind the word of God. Now,
[1:21:06] there's your fortress and your safety.
[1:21:07] Oh my. Every promise in that is yours.
[1:21:10] Only thing I have to do is just reach
[1:21:12] and get it and go right on with it.
[1:21:16] That's it.
[1:21:18] All right. Amen. All right. You don't
[1:21:20] have to produce anything. Don't go out
[1:21:23] and try to produce it. You just receive
[1:21:26] it, believe it, say it's so, and go on.
[1:21:29] Settle it. I'm not going to compromise.
[1:21:32] Not going to add to it, take away. I'm
[1:21:33] not going to put my ideas. I'm not given
[1:21:35] a free thought. I have no right to put a
[1:21:37] free thought to it.
[1:21:40] God said, "So that settles it."
[1:21:43] Now you're standing behind the wall.
[1:21:46] You're behind that barrier. Amen. All
[1:21:49] right. Now, now he's either your guide
[1:21:52] or he isn't. Right? He's either coming
[1:21:54] you and and or he hasn't.
[1:21:58] If he has, then you're going to have
[1:22:00] what you believe. And if you believe the
[1:22:02] word, then life is for you. Then life is
[1:22:05] going to manifest itself through you.
[1:22:08] You're going in a rapture. You've
[1:22:10] already been identified to be there. And
[1:22:12] brother, listen. He has given you a
[1:22:14] choice. But he chose you before the
[1:22:16] foundation of the world. And you didn't
[1:22:18] said Bible say you didn't choose him but
[1:22:20] he chose you. But watch he still gives
[1:22:22] you a choice between right and wrong.
[1:22:25] But one thing he will do he will cause
[1:22:28] you pressure you a little bit and teach
[1:22:30] you to learn to make the right choice.
[1:22:34] Did you ever think of that? Yeah.
[1:22:36] Happens to every one of us. Lord I want
[1:22:38] to make that choice. All right. He just
[1:22:40] pressures a little side over here to get
[1:22:42] the right choice because he's already
[1:22:44] destined you. I know my thoughts
[1:22:47] concerning you, sayaeth the Lord. Not
[1:22:49] thoughts of evil, but thoughts, but but
[1:22:53] thoughts of good. I don't know if that's
[1:22:55] the right word or not. And and and
[1:22:59] to give you
[1:23:01] an expected end.
[1:23:05] Praise be to the Lord.
[1:23:08] I'm glad he he went and took every bit
[1:23:10] of redemption, took all my sin, all my
[1:23:12] failures, all my mistakes, every bit of
[1:23:14] it. And I'm not judged by that. He's
[1:23:16] looking at me through his blood. Looking
[1:23:19] at me and now taken the word in this
[1:23:21] hour and laid claim on me. Yes.
[1:23:26] Amen. Already claimed me and claimed
[1:23:28] everyone. And we're growing into that
[1:23:30] full stature. Amen.
[1:23:32] Hallelujah. All right. My goodness.
[1:23:36] Okay. I I'm just running pretty good
[1:23:38] here now. After you become a Christian,
[1:23:41] okay, you're fortified. Only thing that
[1:23:42] I know, God gave his children the best
[1:23:44] attack that they could have. He knew
[1:23:46] every attacks Satan would come. You
[1:23:48] don't think he knows that? He knew it
[1:23:50] before the beginning. He knew every
[1:23:52] attack that Satan would come at you at.
[1:23:53] He knew every time he would contest you.
[1:23:55] He knew every time he would try you. And
[1:23:57] God has to allow him to do that.
[1:24:00] But he knew it and he fortified you
[1:24:02] behind the word. And he said, now he
[1:24:05] said he gave his children the best
[1:24:07] attack that they could have, the best
[1:24:09] attack to to attack the enemy with. And
[1:24:12] what did he give? The word. Are you
[1:24:14] ready? Why did he give the word? He
[1:24:16] said, are you ready to know why? The
[1:24:18] word is eternal. And if God made a
[1:24:21] promise that's eternal, there's nothing,
[1:24:22] nowhere can stop it. Amen. You could,
[1:24:26] you could turn every atom upside down,
[1:24:27] turn it backwards, never pierce the word
[1:24:29] of God. One little word. See, because
[1:24:31] Jesus said both heavens and earth will
[1:24:33] pass away, but my word, let this mind be
[1:24:36] in you.
[1:24:39] If that was his word, he said his word,
[1:24:41] that's also my word.
[1:24:45] Is that right? That's also my word. So,
[1:24:48] by the same token, he said, "My words
[1:24:50] shall never pass away." What about being
[1:24:53] in him whose words are yours? Then those
[1:24:57] words that brought you life, those words
[1:24:59] that bring you life, those words that's
[1:25:01] guiding you cannot pass away. And you
[1:25:04] are that word.
[1:25:07] My my my
[1:25:10] oh my. Okay. Now, so he gave the word
[1:25:14] because eternal. Now, what is the word
[1:25:16] of God? The word of God. Listen now. Are
[1:25:18] you listening carefully? What is the
[1:25:20] word of God? The word of God is God
[1:25:22] himself.
[1:25:23] So let this mind be in you. What was
[1:25:26] what did he express? What was the word?
[1:25:28] It was a thought expressed
[1:25:31] and God is the word. So let this mind be
[1:25:35] in you. He said so, so the word is God.
[1:25:38] God himself is the word. He gave the
[1:25:41] believer. He gave the believer himself.
[1:25:49] He gave the believer himself.
[1:25:54] Amen. He said it's God himself. He gave
[1:25:57] the believer himself to attack the enemy
[1:25:59] by. In other words, he's the father and
[1:26:02] the word is God. Then the word is our
[1:26:04] father. We're born by the word and he's
[1:26:06] standing in the forefront for his
[1:26:08] children. Amen. There you are. He's
[1:26:09] standing out there for his children.
[1:26:11] What did not he stand for his son? Is
[1:26:14] not he standing for us? How can he not
[1:26:17] stand for us when we were a part of him?
[1:26:19] How can not how can he not believe the
[1:26:21] word? Can he deny himself? Neither can
[1:26:24] we.
[1:26:27] I can't deny this word.
[1:26:30] Amen.
[1:26:31] How can I deny it when when I'm a part
[1:26:34] of it? He can't deny himself. Neither
[1:26:37] can I.
[1:26:40] I'm talking about myself not being this
[1:26:42] myself. The word living eternal life.
[1:26:47] God gave us a record. What record did he
[1:26:49] give us? Eternal life. And this life is
[1:26:52] in his son. And he that hath the son has
[1:26:57] life. Now what in the world are you
[1:26:59] fearing?
[1:27:01] He that hath the son. You have the son,
[1:27:04] you have life.
[1:27:07] He that hath the son hath life.
[1:27:10] He that hath not the son hath not life.
[1:27:14] Here's your record. What's he given you?
[1:27:17] Eternal life. He gave you himself. Amen.
[1:27:20] Amen.
[1:27:23] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm not
[1:27:26] just saying these cliches. I mean every
[1:27:29] word. This is more than life to me. I
[1:27:32] mean more and more. It's becoming more
[1:27:34] open, more open, more open, more open,
[1:27:37] more personalized all the time. Till I
[1:27:40] just cannot. This body is going to have
[1:27:42] to break away.
[1:27:44] It's going to have to let go because
[1:27:46] this inside this this reality of who I
[1:27:50] am, who he is, we are one. We're no
[1:27:53] longer twain.
[1:27:55] We are united. Created in Christ Jesus.
[1:27:58] The prophet said, "Being created in
[1:28:00] Christ Jesus means that you were made in
[1:28:02] union with him. You cannot be separated
[1:28:05] from that union." God cannot lose a part
[1:28:08] of eternal life. If he does, he can't
[1:28:10] lose himself. But he's not complete
[1:28:12] until you are the expression of himself
[1:28:15] and you're made manifest. Now we're
[1:28:17] seeing the word for the season.
[1:28:20] Hallelujah.
[1:28:22] Hallelujah.
[1:28:24] All right. Now, let me just start
[1:28:27] closing here.
[1:28:30] You must never get behind that word. I
[1:28:33] mean, excuse me. You must never get from
[1:28:35] behind that. When you do, you're opening
[1:28:38] the door to the enemy. Oh, well, you he
[1:28:41] he'll say when you say when they say,
[1:28:43] "Oh, well, I'll do a little of this, a
[1:28:45] little of that." God wants you to
[1:28:47] separate yourself from any everything
[1:28:49] that's called unbelief, completely set
[1:28:51] aside for him and for him only.
[1:28:56] Amen.
[1:28:58] He said,
[1:29:00] "Now, every man that was made in the
[1:29:02] image of his creator, he was given a
[1:29:05] wall to stand behind. And that word
[1:29:07] could never can ne can never fail.
[1:29:10] That's what the Christian's hope is.
[1:29:12] That's his shield. That's his armor.
[1:29:14] It's his rock today. The revelation it's
[1:29:16] rock revelation today is to stand behind
[1:29:20] that word. Every believer stand behind
[1:29:22] the word
[1:29:25] and don't you know I could there's
[1:29:27] quotes I was going to read out of the
[1:29:28] family altar. I could give you the page
[1:29:30] number. You go back and read it. But
[1:29:32] Jesus never said when he was tested in
[1:29:34] the wilderness said, "I rebuke you,
[1:29:36] Satan." He never said that. You know
[1:29:38] what he said? It's written.
[1:29:42] Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:29:44] by every word that proceedth out of the
[1:29:46] mouth of God. That's all he said. So
[1:29:49] then Satan was defeated right there.
[1:29:51] Then he took him up and gave him another
[1:29:53] test. You know what he said? It's
[1:29:54] written. That's right. And then the last
[1:29:57] test, he said, he went right. He said,
[1:30:00] "Get behind me, Satan.
[1:30:02] For it's written,
[1:30:05] Brother Bram said that word that that a
[1:30:08] he showed us what the weakest Christian
[1:30:10] could do to defeat the enemy every
[1:30:12] place, every time on any condition,
[1:30:14] anywhere
[1:30:16] is simply take his word, right?
[1:30:20] Oh, well, Satan says it's got to be more
[1:30:22] than that. It's too simple. It's that
[1:30:24] simple and it's that powerful. Amen.
[1:30:29] Don't let him punch a hole through that
[1:30:31] wall by reasoning with you. Don't you
[1:30:34] reason with him. Turn him down. Turn him
[1:30:37] down. Take the word that speaks of you.
[1:30:40] It doesn't speak of him. It speaks of
[1:30:41] you. It's revealing you. You are the
[1:30:44] revelation contained in there. You are
[1:30:47] what's hidden in there. Amen. All right.
[1:30:51] Take that word. Amen. So, I'm going to
[1:30:54] have to bypass some of this. Oh well,
[1:30:56] okay. Now, he has a purpose for your
[1:30:58] life. Each individual, no one else on
[1:31:00] the face of the earth can take your
[1:31:02] place. God has got something for you. He
[1:31:04] made you like that.
[1:31:07] Why was that done that way? It was done
[1:31:09] that way for a purpose. God is sovereign
[1:31:11] in his work. Things we differ. Things
[1:31:13] different. Things are different. We're
[1:31:15] different. We different from one
[1:31:16] another. Now,
[1:31:22] so brother, sister, before I go any
[1:31:26] further here, and I I am coming to a
[1:31:28] close.
[1:31:31] Can't you see where we're standing
[1:31:32] today?
[1:31:36] With the word open,
[1:31:38] and you know, the word will continue to
[1:31:40] be open. Once we get into these bodies,
[1:31:41] we'll wonder how we we won't even
[1:31:43] understand why we lived here and how we
[1:31:45] lived here and how we were dying every
[1:31:46] day because it won't be there.
[1:31:50] We We can't explain right now this. Wait
[1:31:52] till we get over there. We will look
[1:31:54] back say, "I can't explain that."
[1:31:58] That's right. See, we we're we're going
[1:32:01] to have and we're not going to we're not
[1:32:03] just going to we'll be ask questions.
[1:32:06] We'll talk. We'll converse with one
[1:32:07] another just like we do now.
[1:32:11] Amen. Yes.
[1:32:13] I mean, it's not going to be, oh, oh,
[1:32:15] such and such. Oh, yeah. I already know
[1:32:16] that. No, it's going to be there'll be
[1:32:18] qu answers. We're going to live like we
[1:32:21] live. Don't leave there's no death in
[1:32:22] it. We're going to build and have it. On
[1:32:26] and on we could go. See? See? So, but
[1:32:30] let's go back here to what we're looking
[1:32:32] at. Can't you see where we're standing?
[1:32:34] Life. What's that life? Eternal life is
[1:32:36] in the grain again.
[1:32:39] What is it? Just exactly the same grain.
[1:32:42] Are you hearing me? What is it? Exactly
[1:32:45] the same grain that went in the ground.
[1:32:49] The same Jesus
[1:32:52] in the bride form.
[1:33:00] I could really smile big right now
[1:33:03] because I love this.
[1:33:06] The same Jesus in the bride form,
[1:33:10] same power, same church, same thing,
[1:33:15] same word. Let this mind be in you.
[1:33:20] The same word sucked up through these
[1:33:22] and come out here and come to a head
[1:33:24] here. And all that life that come up
[1:33:27] through there here carriers picked up
[1:33:30] its people. Now it's forming up into a
[1:33:32] head.
[1:33:35] Or other words, it's growing in the
[1:33:37] bride. He said to the full stature
[1:33:41] things that are to be the revelation of
[1:33:44] Jesus Christ for this hour is growing in
[1:33:47] the bride form.
[1:33:49] Amen.
[1:33:51] To the full stature. And all that life
[1:33:54] come up through here, picked up as
[1:33:55] people, now is forming into a head for
[1:33:58] the rapture.
[1:34:01] Amen. Amen. What's that rapture we're
[1:34:03] looking for? Body change. Meeting him.
[1:34:06] Meeting in the air. What's that opening?
[1:34:08] That's opening up his third coming.
[1:34:12] What's the third coming?
[1:34:14] Go right back to earth.
[1:34:17] What's left? Brother Brham said, "We're
[1:34:19] in the second fold of that seventh seal.
[1:34:22] What's the third?" Back to Eden.
[1:34:26] Comes one first time to redeem. He comes
[1:34:28] the next time to receive.
[1:34:31] that receiving part of it. Don't wait
[1:34:33] until we're caught in the air to be
[1:34:35] received. We're being received right
[1:34:37] now. When did he open the word? What did
[1:34:38] he open himself up for? To receive us,
[1:34:43] we had to mature somehow. And it took
[1:34:46] the son, it took the bridegroom to come
[1:34:47] and lay in the presence of that son to
[1:34:49] mature. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:52] So when they said, "Let let the
[1:34:54] bridegroom coming." And the prophet
[1:34:57] said, "The sun is up."
[1:35:01] Amen. And they that were ready
[1:35:04] went into the marriage.
[1:35:08] Amen. Is that right? Remember the
[1:35:10] foolish virgin were in the book of life.
[1:35:14] They meet at the white throne judgment.
[1:35:15] But the bride was in another section of
[1:35:17] that. And she's found also in Matthew
[1:35:20] 25. But she was ready. Why? because she
[1:35:23] had oil in the inside of the inside.
[1:35:28] That's right. There's your difference.
[1:35:30] And they went into the marriage and the
[1:35:32] last one had to come in. Is that right?
[1:35:34] Last one claimed. All right. And and
[1:35:37] they had to be immatured. She had taken
[1:35:39] an immature bride. Right. So they had to
[1:35:42] be matured. Amen. And then the door was
[1:35:45] shut.
[1:35:48] See?
[1:35:50] And there's there can be a period of
[1:35:52] time after the door shut.
[1:35:55] Amen. I don't know that. I'm not saying
[1:35:57] that. I pray that it isn't. There's
[1:35:59] still opportunity.
[1:36:01] Amen. For someone. We don't know that,
[1:36:04] do we?
[1:36:06] But we live in a
[1:36:08] in a day of revelation.
[1:36:13] Life is in the grain. The prophet
[1:36:15] declared this age as seed time. And to
[1:36:18] make sure you got it, he said, "It's
[1:36:19] bride time.
[1:36:21] It's the seed." All right. But in what
[1:36:23] form?
[1:36:25] Amen. There you are. Okay. Oh my.
[1:36:28] Wonderful. Now, now questions and
[1:36:31] answers. I'm going to bring this to you
[1:36:33] and then we're just going to try to
[1:36:34] we'll close here in the next give me
[1:36:36] five minutes. And questions and answers.
[1:36:38] Paragraph 269.
[1:36:42] The question is, I can't give over
[1:36:43] completely to Jesus.
[1:36:46] Have I an evil spirit?
[1:36:49] Let me just spend the rest of the time
[1:36:50] on that there. This is this is 8:23
[1:36:53] morning 64 questions and answers.
[1:36:58] He said, "Let's see. See, I don't know,
[1:37:00] man or woman." He didn't know who wrote
[1:37:01] it. I couldn't tell what it is. God
[1:37:03] knows that you can't surrender to Jesus.
[1:37:07] Why? What's the matter?
[1:37:09] If you are a woman, don't you have to
[1:37:11] surrender to your husband to be a wife?
[1:37:15] Surrender all you are. A little lady
[1:37:18] when you were married, virtuous, fought
[1:37:20] all your life to stay virtuous. But one
[1:37:24] day you found a man that you loved, you
[1:37:26] were his completely.
[1:37:31] The things that you fought the things
[1:37:34] that you you had fought against all your
[1:37:37] life and tried to live clean and clear
[1:37:39] and virtuous. Now you surrender every
[1:37:42] bit of that to one man.
[1:37:46] Too bad. And he's talking he's talking
[1:37:49] to an individual here. Talking
[1:37:51] spiritually typing it with the natural.
[1:37:54] It's too bad that women haven't caught
[1:37:56] that vision today. Some, you know,
[1:37:58] claiming to be in the message. Haven't
[1:38:01] caught the vision that they've
[1:38:03] surrendered to a man.
[1:38:06] But we're looking at it spiritually
[1:38:08] here. Now, watch what we're saying here.
[1:38:12] See, it shows there's not a trust
[1:38:14] somewhere.
[1:38:15] I'll just let that lay right there. Let
[1:38:18] your pastor take care of that.
[1:38:21] All right.
[1:38:24] You were his completely. The things that
[1:38:26] you fought against all your life and
[1:38:28] tried to live clean and clear and
[1:38:30] virtuous, now you surrender every bit of
[1:38:32] it to one man. Is that right? You put
[1:38:35] yourself completely in his hands.
[1:38:38] You know, watch this. this trust here.
[1:38:42] You are his.
[1:38:45] Now, we could go back and pick that
[1:38:46] right up. You laid the veil on his
[1:38:48] shoulders. What you're declaring is,
[1:38:50] "I'm yours. You're my head."
[1:38:53] And he should accept the obligation and
[1:38:56] honor you as a weaker vessel, that your
[1:38:59] prayers be not hindered,
[1:39:01] and that he should love you as Christ
[1:39:03] loved the church and give himself for
[1:39:05] you.
[1:39:06] Now, there's real messages in that. It's
[1:39:08] more than dos and don'ts. There's a
[1:39:10] spiritual realization laying there
[1:39:12] concerning Christ and his bride. Paul
[1:39:15] said that. All right. There's a mystery
[1:39:17] here. All right. Now, you put yourself
[1:39:21] completely in his hands. You are his.
[1:39:23] All that you have stood for in decency
[1:39:26] and moral and everything like that. Now,
[1:39:29] you turn it over to a man because you
[1:39:31] surrender yourself to the man. Can't you
[1:39:34] do the same thing to Jesus Christ?
[1:39:39] Just surrender yourself that way. All
[1:39:41] that I am, all my mind, all my thoughts.
[1:39:46] Certainly, I don't think you're
[1:39:48] possessed of an evil spirit. I think an
[1:39:50] evil spirit anoints you with them kind
[1:39:51] of thoughts trying to make you think you
[1:39:54] cannot surrender yourself to God. Am I
[1:39:56] still on mic here? Sounds like it's
[1:39:59] fading.
[1:40:01] Let me show you something. Why would you
[1:40:04] want to surrender to him? Now look, look
[1:40:06] at how he brings this right back.
[1:40:09] talk devil given a black eye. Now just
[1:40:11] put this in your own park here. Amen.
[1:40:14] All of us, man and woman. He said, "Why
[1:40:17] would you want to?" How many want to
[1:40:19] surrender completely to him? That's
[1:40:20] right. Devil's trying to make it look
[1:40:23] awful difficult when it's so simple.
[1:40:27] That's the truth. But you have an old
[1:40:29] man out here that
[1:40:32] fighting against it. See? All right.
[1:40:36] Because Satan don't want you to
[1:40:37] surrender completely.
[1:40:39] He can't.
[1:40:41] He He wants to possess you and possess
[1:40:43] your thoughts so he can manifest himself
[1:40:45] through your body.
[1:40:48] So the battle is for possession of you.
[1:40:54] When you realize that, then you're
[1:40:56] giving yourself even more to God
[1:41:01] because there only one I want to be
[1:41:02] possessed by, and that's Christ. Amen.
[1:41:05] All right. Now, he said,
[1:41:08] he said, "I don't try." He said, "Why
[1:41:10] would you want to surrender
[1:41:14] to him?" Because there's something out
[1:41:17] there calling you to surrender. It's a
[1:41:20] very good sign. You ought to surrender
[1:41:22] yourself. What's surrender mean?
[1:41:25] Release.
[1:41:26] What do you do when you surrender to an
[1:41:28] enemy?
[1:41:30] Everything we have, everything we were
[1:41:32] yours.
[1:41:36] When you surrender to someone, I'm
[1:41:38] talking about as a war, you know, they
[1:41:39] surrender to the enemy. They just give
[1:41:41] them right to come in and possess
[1:41:43] everything they are. They put them
[1:41:44] whatever they do with they want what
[1:41:45] they want with them.
[1:41:47] What about when you surrender to him?
[1:41:51] Amen.
[1:41:53] Oh, it's wonderful.
[1:41:55] That's it. It's what do you It's And
[1:41:58] every day you're going to fight every
[1:42:00] day.
[1:42:02] You got to stay behind that word. Stay
[1:42:04] behind it. You, that's your fortress.
[1:42:07] That's your protection. Keep me behind
[1:42:09] the word, Lord. Nobody's saying in here
[1:42:12] that we're perfect as men. None of us
[1:42:13] are. But there's one thing in us that
[1:42:16] desires that more than anything else,
[1:42:18] Lord. This is your house. This is your
[1:42:20] possession. You take it and you do with
[1:42:22] it what you want. Your word is my
[1:42:23] absolute. Amen. That's all there is to
[1:42:25] it. I don't understand why this happens.
[1:42:28] I understand why that happens. But
[1:42:29] you're in possession. You're in control
[1:42:31] over it. Yes.
[1:42:34] Okay.
[1:42:36] Now,
[1:42:38] okay.
[1:42:44] He said just give yourself over Lord. My
[1:42:48] thinking, all that I am, I want to give
[1:42:50] to you. My life I give as life of
[1:42:53] service. Take me, Lord. Use me just as I
[1:42:56] am. And he said, and it's such a simple
[1:42:59] thing.
[1:43:05] When you release it, it's released.
[1:43:08] Lord spoke to me about a month ago and
[1:43:10] he said, "Haven't you committed yourself
[1:43:12] to me?" I said, "Yes, Lord." Then leave
[1:43:14] it right there.
[1:43:18] Committed is committed. Quit trying to
[1:43:20] reason why you're if you're committed or
[1:43:22] not. Didn't you commit yourself?
[1:43:25] Then he let go. Then let go. Just that's
[1:43:29] it. So when you come up against a
[1:43:31] situation, who are you going to submit
[1:43:32] yourself to? What the Bible say?
[1:43:34] Surrender yourself to God.
[1:43:37] How you going to resist the devil? By
[1:43:38] first giving yourself to God, the word.
[1:43:41] Then resist the devil, and he'll flee
[1:43:43] from you.
[1:43:45] Don't try to outsmart him. Don't try to
[1:43:47] use Don't try to reason with him. Don't
[1:43:49] try to reason with feelings. Reason with
[1:43:51] why this is happening. I don't know. I
[1:43:53] don't know. I've heard more people say,
[1:43:54] I don't know why it's happening. I don't
[1:43:56] know why it's happening. Just release
[1:43:58] yourself to the word.
[1:44:00] The word is your absolute. Well, I don't
[1:44:04] see anything happen. You're looking.
[1:44:06] You're what? You're not believing the
[1:44:08] word. You're not resting in what he
[1:44:09] said.
[1:44:14] Let patience have her perfect work.
[1:44:19] Is not God on time? Who saved you? Who
[1:44:22] called you? Who brought you here? Amen.
[1:44:25] Who gave you ability? Who gave you
[1:44:27] strength?
[1:44:29] All right. Now, I'm going over time, so
[1:44:30] let's just stop that. All right.
[1:44:36] A lot of things I could bring here, but
[1:44:38] I'm just going to take What a beautiful
[1:44:39] thing it is just to lay your life in his
[1:44:41] hands and say, "Here am I, Lord.
[1:44:44] Just use me now. Lead me, guide me,
[1:44:48] direct me in the way that would be
[1:44:50] pleasing unto thee." And then don't
[1:44:53] murmur.
[1:44:54] No matter what the path is, stay with it
[1:44:57] anyhow and God will work it. All right.
[1:44:59] Like brother Trevor and I was at the
[1:45:01] barber shop and we were saying, no
[1:45:02] matter what it looks like, all is well.
[1:45:07] All is well. Well, I have this happen. I
[1:45:11] have that happen. Yeah, that's right.
[1:45:12] But all is well. So, how do you know
[1:45:14] that? Because the word said so.
[1:45:18] Where am I fortified? What am I staying
[1:45:20] behind? The word. The word. The word is
[1:45:24] perfect. You're not. The word is.
[1:45:27] All right. Then no matter what the path
[1:45:30] is, watch what he said. No matter what
[1:45:31] the path is, don't murmur. No matter
[1:45:33] what the path is, stay with it anyhow,
[1:45:35] and God will work it. All right. The
[1:45:37] footsteps of the righteous is ordered by
[1:45:39] the Lord. And that scripture is true.
[1:45:42] Amen.
[1:45:45] What a blessed assurance. just like a
[1:45:47] baby to lay your trust in him and let
[1:45:48] him take all your cares for he cares for
[1:45:51] you. Don't try to do nothing about it.
[1:45:53] He will do it already. He promised he
[1:45:55] would do it. It's his business. As long
[1:45:57] as you're fooling with it, well, he
[1:45:59] can't have it. But when you turn it
[1:46:01] loose and let him have it, he will take
[1:46:03] care of it for you. Yes, sir. Oh, I like
[1:46:05] that. What a perfect calmness the
[1:46:08] Christian ought to have.
[1:46:11] I committed, he said, I don't, brother
[1:46:12] Bram said, I don't understand myself
[1:46:15] because I committed submitted and
[1:46:17] committed myself to Christ many years
[1:46:19] ago. He does the leading. I don't try to
[1:46:22] understand it. I just go where he leads.
[1:46:26] All right. And then he has no hands but
[1:46:29] ours now. And here's here here he's here
[1:46:32] in the spirit form. No eyes but ours, no
[1:46:35] ears but ours, no tongue but ours. So
[1:46:37] let's let him have everything. The
[1:46:39] secret of this is submitting yourself
[1:46:42] with godly love into the hands of a
[1:46:45] loving father and letting him take you
[1:46:48] over.
[1:46:50] That's all.
[1:46:59] I'll admit people study too much and try
[1:47:01] to go too far ahead and try to think too
[1:47:03] hard and sometimes they have mental
[1:47:04] breakdowns and things on account of
[1:47:06] studying about the Lord. You must quit
[1:47:08] that. You don't have to do that. The
[1:47:10] only thing you have to do is fall in
[1:47:12] love with him and just go right on
[1:47:14] loving him. Amen. It's not trying to
[1:47:16] push into something or make yourself
[1:47:18] something you're not. Just go ahead and
[1:47:20] let God use you the way he wants to use
[1:47:22] you. Just yield yourself. Commit
[1:47:24] yourself. Walk on happy, singing,
[1:47:27] rejoicing. That's the way. Amen.
[1:47:33] The only thing you have to do is take
[1:47:35] your stand upon God's word and God will
[1:47:37] make the way for the rest of it.
[1:47:42] Oh,
[1:47:46] there he goes out the door.
[1:47:52] He don't want you to stand behind the
[1:47:53] word. You You answer him with this is
[1:47:56] the word. This my word. That's not only
[1:47:58] my father's word, that's my word. Right.
[1:48:00] Thank you. Amen. I'm a believer. I'm a
[1:48:04] son of God. That's my word. I have the
[1:48:05] authority with the word. I am the word
[1:48:07] and it can't pass away. Heavens and
[1:48:09] earth will pass away, but my word will
[1:48:11] not pass away.
[1:48:13] Now, wouldn't that wouldn't that be a
[1:48:15] problem with carnal believers? Who do
[1:48:17] you think you are? We're speaking from
[1:48:19] another fountain here. Amen. We're
[1:48:22] living from another channel. That's
[1:48:24] right. The just shall live by faith.
[1:48:30] Okay, if you'll stand to your feet, I'll
[1:48:33] stop.
[1:48:34] [Laughter]
[1:48:37] Okay, now when it's revealed to you,
[1:48:40] it's a faith then a perfect faith that
[1:48:42] cannot fail.
[1:48:45] It's substance.
[1:48:48] Remember Jesus said, I can do nothing
[1:48:50] till my father shows me. And the same
[1:48:53] harmony is to exist between him and his
[1:48:55] bride. Do you love him? I've got a
[1:48:59] father. Do you have a father?
[1:49:02] Just remember, hold that word before
[1:49:04] you. You're being tested. You'll be
[1:49:06] tried. You'll be tried with mistakes.
[1:49:08] You'll be tried with failures. You'll be
[1:49:09] tried with pain. You'll be tried with
[1:49:11] discomfort. You'll be tried. Take the
[1:49:13] word. Amen. Stay behind the word. It
[1:49:17] doesn't matter. You don't have to figure
[1:49:19] out anything. Release it. give it to God
[1:49:21] and say, "Lord, here I am. You lead me
[1:49:23] in this.
[1:49:25] If I've got a you you and I absolutely
[1:49:28] believe you are and I've committed
[1:49:29] myself to you and I'll follow,
[1:49:33] how confident are you about that when
[1:49:35] you say it?" Don't speak in his name and
[1:49:38] not believe it. Because we don't use the
[1:49:41] name in vain.
[1:49:44] When we say something and speak
[1:49:46] something, let's believe it.
[1:49:49] Receive it. Ask in his name and I'll do
[1:49:52] it. Did he say that? He said he ordained
[1:49:56] your works for you to walk in. Did he
[1:49:58] say that?
[1:49:59] He said, "I've healed you." Did he say
[1:50:01] that?
[1:50:03] On and on we could go. You don't need to
[1:50:06] do anything else but stand right there.
[1:50:08] Give God thanks. Praise him for what
[1:50:10] he's done
[1:50:12] and quit looking at anything else and
[1:50:15] don't let the devil reason you reason
[1:50:17] with your feelings. I I can't stop from
[1:50:20] saying that because that's his tactics.
[1:50:24] Let's bring every thought under
[1:50:26] obedience to Christ. I didn't read that
[1:50:28] scripture.
[1:50:30] Well,
[1:50:32] you know what I'm talking about. 2
[1:50:33] Corinthians 10:3 and5. Our warfare is
[1:50:36] not carnal but mighty through God
[1:50:38] through the word to pulling down the
[1:50:40] strongholds bringing every thought under
[1:50:43] subjection
[1:50:46] obedience to the word to Christ. That's
[1:50:48] the right mental attitude. All right?
[1:50:51] That's having the mind of God. Isaiah
[1:50:54] 26:3 said what? I'll keep him in perfect
[1:50:57] peace whose mind is stayed. That word
[1:51:00] stayed means you rest upon and you lean
[1:51:03] against it. See, all that goes right
[1:51:05] along with what we said. I'll give him
[1:51:07] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:51:09] God because why? He trustth in me.
[1:51:15] What are you trusting in? What are you
[1:51:17] resting in? If you're not resting in the
[1:51:20] word, you're on shaky ground.
[1:51:23] Amen.
[1:51:25] That's it. So turn the soul. Yes. I'm
[1:51:29] not talking about your outer man. Oh,
[1:51:31] well, I've got to do this. I've got to
[1:51:32] do this. It's mind over matter. No, it
[1:51:34] isn't.
[1:51:37] Not. It's not. And yet, we could say it
[1:51:39] is. God's mind.
[1:51:42] But
[1:51:43] what are we saying here? What's your
[1:51:46] soul believe? Live from that. Live from
[1:51:49] that realm. Live from that word.
[1:51:54] Live from that soul realm right there.
[1:51:57] Bring everything under obedience to
[1:51:59] that. Where is your guide? He's in you.
[1:52:03] Talking to believers, born again
[1:52:05] believers. Where is your guide?
[1:52:09] He said, "Let guide me, direct me, lead
[1:52:11] me in the way that pleases you." Do you
[1:52:14] believe that? Amen. Then rest in it.
[1:52:19] Care what it looks like. Rest in it.
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:26] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[1:52:28] live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in
[1:52:30] me. And the life that I now live, I live
[1:52:32] by the faith of the Son of God, who
[1:52:34] loved me and gave himself for me. And I
[1:52:37] say again, where does faith rest
[1:52:40] in the unmovable eternal word?
[1:52:44] Amen.
[1:52:46] Amen. Now, I'll probably go I'll
[1:52:47] probably miss, but don't matter. Let's
[1:52:50] sing that song. I have a father. You
[1:52:53] have a father.
[1:52:57] I love that song. Amen.
[1:53:01] Um, okay. I have a maker
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:11] before
[1:53:12] my heart.
[1:53:18] And before even time began,
[1:53:24] my life was in his hand. Just think on
[1:53:30] that.
[1:53:32] He knows my name.
[1:53:39] He knows
[1:53:42] my every thought.
[1:53:47] He sees each tear that falls
[1:53:53] and hears me when I call.
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:01] I have a father.
[1:54:07] [Music]
[1:54:08] He calls me his own
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:16] and he'll never
[1:54:18] leave me.
[1:54:22] No matter
[1:54:24] where I go. That's what he said. I'll
[1:54:27] never leave you, never forsake you. He
[1:54:30] knows
[1:54:32] my name.
[1:54:35] Release yourself tonight. He knows my
[1:54:40] every thought.
[1:54:44] Oh, he sees each tear that falls
[1:54:50] and hears me when I call.
[1:54:56] Once again, I have a father. I have Yes,
[1:55:01] Lord. This is an individual affair. He's
[1:55:04] your father. He calls me.
[1:55:09] Did not he say that? Did not he declare
[1:55:11] that?
[1:55:13] And he'll never
[1:55:16] leave me
[1:55:19] no matter
[1:55:21] where I go.
[1:55:26] Oh, he knows
[1:55:29] my name.
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:34] He knows my every thought.
[1:55:41] Oh, he sees each tear that falls
[1:55:47] and hears me when I call. You believe
[1:55:52] that tonight? Do you believe he hears
[1:55:54] you? He said if your heart condemns you
[1:55:57] not, you have confidence toward God.
[1:55:59] That if you know you, he hears you. Then
[1:56:01] you know you have your petition.
[1:56:05] Hallelujah.
[1:56:07] We ought to be the freest. We are the
[1:56:08] freest. We ought to be the happiest. We
[1:56:10] are the happiest. Most joyful people
[1:56:12] there is upon the earth because we have
[1:56:15] a father. Because we have his word and
[1:56:18] his word cannot pass away. And because
[1:56:20] his word can't pass away, I cannot pass
[1:56:23] away.
[1:56:25] Hallelujah.
[1:56:27] Bless the Lord, oh my soul. I think
[1:56:30] that's a song, isn't it? Yeah. Let's
[1:56:32] sing it. You know that song? Okay. Bless
[1:56:34] the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:56:39] Bless the Lord,
[1:56:43] oh my soul,
[1:56:47] and all
[1:56:49] that is within me. Bless his holy
[1:56:58] name. name.
[1:57:01] Oh yes, I'll bless the Lord,
[1:57:06] oh my soul,
[1:57:09] and all
[1:57:12] that is within me. Bless his holy
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:21] name,
[1:57:23] for he has done great things.
[1:57:28] Hallelujah.
[1:57:31] For he has done great things.
[1:57:39] For he has done great things.
[1:57:44] Bless his holy
[1:57:50] name.
[1:57:53] Oh, bless the Lord.
[1:57:57] Oh my soul
[1:58:00] and all
[1:58:03] that is within me, bless his holy
[1:58:10] [Music]
[1:58:12] name.
[1:58:15] Bless the Lord,
[1:58:19] oh my soul,
[1:58:22] and all
[1:58:24] that is within me. Bless his holy
[1:58:34] name.
[1:58:37] Amen, many many many. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:58:42] Hallelujah.
[1:58:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:50] Amen.
[1:58:52] Amen.
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:59:05] Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:07] Thank the Lord. God bless you.
[1:59:11] I think I'll just go ahead and dismiss.
[1:59:13] Brother Paul, do you have something?
[1:59:15] Okay.
[1:59:16] [Music]
[1:59:18] Keep him on your mind. Keep him on your
[1:59:21] thoughts.
[1:59:22] Hold the mind that he's given you. You
[1:59:25] take. Let that be predominant.
[1:59:28] Bring your old carnal mind under
[1:59:30] obedience to every thought under
[1:59:34] obedience to the word.
[1:59:37] For you came from him. You're part of
[1:59:40] him. Hold that forth.
[1:59:44] Don't let that drop. Stay behind that
[1:59:47] fortress, that wall that he's placed
[1:59:49] there for you to be. He's given you his
[1:59:51] eternal word. You could not have
[1:59:53] anything better.
[1:59:55] That cannot fail. Everything else will
[1:59:57] fail. So keep your focus on the eternal.
[2:00:03] Amen. Keep your focus on the eternal,
[2:00:06] not on the things that are temporal.
[2:00:08] Again,
[2:00:10] while we look not at the things which
[2:00:13] are seen, but the things that are not
[2:00:16] seen. For the things which are seen are
[2:00:18] temporal, but the things that are
[2:00:20] unseen.
[2:00:22] That's Christ in you. That's Christ
[2:00:24] living through you. That's Christ the
[2:00:26] word. That is the eternal.
[2:00:31] Keep feeding on the word, brother,
[2:00:33] sister.
[2:00:34] Keep eating.
[2:00:36] Ask God. You have not because you ask
[2:00:39] not. But ask according to his will. He's
[2:00:43] got to answer it.
[2:00:45] You believe it, then receive it.
[2:00:49] And don't let time, space, nothing else
[2:00:52] move that away from you. You just give
[2:00:54] him thanks. He will do it. I am a
[2:00:56] witness of that. I know that's truth.
[2:01:01] Amen. God bless you. Till we meet again,
[2:01:03] come expecting, fed up. Come in the
[2:01:06] spirit on Sunday.
[2:01:08] be a lot easier to preach, won't it,
[2:01:10] brother Paul?
[2:01:12] God bless you.
