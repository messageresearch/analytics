[Music] bring [Music] [Music] [Music] to him [Music] and [Music] and [Music] oh [Music] we're [Music] jerusalem over i shall wear a crown in my new jerusalem can we say amen to that hallelujah just to know the promise of god's word in our day has promised that we will occupy the new jerusalem amen well it is with much pleasure today i get to read this little short note it says shalom church i am brother yannick i come from morocco i am sister sharon's fiance i said thank you very much for your prayers and i'm very happy to be here with you all may god bless you all let's just greet our brother yannick god bless you amen you know i just remember a couple years ago my sister jerry and i was courting and those things of our life she only lived about four hours away not continents and i couldn't wait to see her i couldn't wait to talk to her so i can only imagine what you guys have experienced but god is rich in mercy amen he is gracious to us and we are so happy to have you here with us brother i pray god's blessing on you in all that you lay your hand to amen you know every time that god opens a door my brother and sister and we move through that doorway god's got something for us a blessing that he's he's got for us and so we're happy good to see each and every one of you today i just pray lord just stir your hearts and we just look forward to the word amen i want to speak to you once again on redemption's manifestation i i know that i have veered very far from uh where we started in this series of redemptions manifestation but um i promise you we will get back to it i just have to deal with this little thought we're talking about the tale of two queens and as we look at this story my brother and sister we realize it does tie together with our thought of those sold out to christ and those sold out to the world and those who are straddling the fence and we look at this and realize that for every counterfeit as the prophet of god very very lovingly made that that uh uh point to us for every counterfeit there has to be the original the real and aren't you glad of that because today um i just seems like there's a lot of counterfeit brother isaac i don't know if it's just up here but i seem like to have a lot of feedback so we look at this and realize that if we're not careful we just start looking at the counterfeit and uh in that we start to judge everything by the counterfeit i was just talking to an individual a few days ago and he made a statement about how it just seemed like everywhere you go this man did this and this and this and he claims to be a christian and it opened a door an opportunity we can talk to them and say look it's not about the name it's about the life and so anyone can bear any name but we want to bear the life and when we bear the life the name will stand out and so we're thankful that god is is uh being so gracious to us in our lives that uh we will come and and i'll touch upon this a little further in this service uh but we uh recognize that we as the bride of christ we don't walk around talking in the language of i'm the queen of heaven you see the title comes with the position we don't seek the title we seek the position amen and so it's there that we don't need boasting rights we don't need to be able to vocalize to the world because as we have all experienced i'm sure in our lives the the times that we have come it doesn't matter what you're talking about i remember many years ago i hired a man to work for me and um he uh he said oh yeah i've i've driven a tractor many times and i said okay that's fine we put him to work and i walk out one morning and he's out there without the clutch pushed in trying to stick the tractor in gear and i realized at that time anyone can say but it's the actual life or the action that proves whether there's something there or not so amen we don't know as i said telling the world we're the queen of heaven but you'll find this many member body that our lord jesus christ calls the wife the bride amen we can claim that position i am the bride of jesus christ amen let's just stand as we'll go into the word today taking this out a little fundamentals we'll take out of the book of esther the second chapter and while we're not touching on every component uh every part of these uh this story uh we're wanting and desiring and i pray by god's grace we actually can accomplish to bring the parallels to bring the picture because you see my brother and sister everything that has happened the scripture says will happen again nothing new under the sun right so with nothing new under the sun we find ourselves realizing that what is taking place today has already taken place so we can find the parallels all through this scripture that match the day we live in so you wonder what's next what's in store what's happening get into your bible start reading start studying listen to what the prophet said about the times the seasons the places and my brother and sister we won't run around perplexed we won't run around afraid we won't run around with these giant question marks and and i just say this i don't say this critically but when you talk to people talk to them on the telephone whatever they've called brother paul i have questions about this this this and this my brother and sister often times now i don't want to sound harsh here but you can tell whether or not they've been in their bible or not you can tell whether they've been studying the message or not because the answers are there the prophet of god said the bible explains it all so when we come into this time that we say i just don't know i don't know i've got the questions i'm nervous i've just get in your bible start reading start praying asking for revelation right did the prophet of god not say to pray for revelation so you pray for revelation you get into the word many of our little things that have us shook up will fade away amen that's god's promise to us esther the second chapter starting with verse 7. and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful who mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shuchan the palace to the custody of haggai that esther was brought also into the king's house to the custody of haggai the keeper of the women and the maiden pleased him my right from the very beginning look what's happening oh and by the way those of you that thought he mispronounced that i just read a quote this morning where brother branham said now he might not have much education he might not be able to pronounce those names in the bible correctly and the world will measure that by whether that's truth or not but we measure the truth by god in his word amen so it just those of you that thought he mispronounced that praise the lord i got a quote now i was like thank you lord thank you lord amen so it came to pass when the king's commandment his decree was heard when many maidens were gathered together so look at this i wanted to just this is not really my point this morning but i want you to catch this my brother and sister you talk about an act of faith or anointing that mordecai haven't taken this child and raised it as his own in other words i believe that his love would then have just as solid as it had been his very child and he's raised it up but now anointed to release her into this now when you think about this when a young woman went to uh try out to be the queen she never came back she didn't come back and go ahead and marry that other childhood friend she never came back my this took an act of faith there had to have been something anointing mordecai to say you know what we're going to send you up there i mean it would be a good secure thing for a young lady but what man would wish that his daughter would just go away and become a concubine maybe to know the king and maybe not to never really have a life of freedom whatever this is an act of faith saints and i want to put it right here just in case i miss it somewhere else in the service when we as sons and daughters of god give our heart to jesus christ truly give our heart to jesus christ i'm not talking about a religious spirit i'm talking about truly give our heart to jesus christ we are forever his captive there is no going back now many people say well i i served god for many years and got discouraged and i went back my brother and sister they never fully gave their heart they always held that little portion back just in case this message doesn't work well hallelujah we don't need to have it just in case amen we're sold out hallelujah and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for to do what was just my brother and sister and fair we'd all go to hell aren't you glad we can have favoritism in the eyes of the king amen that he would come and say you know what i'll give you the best place in my house i give you of the best things and i do it speedily i i don't do it with any remorse i don't do it with any restraint but give it freely and speedily to you amen esther had not showed her people nor her kindred for mordecai had charged her that she should not show it my i just want to preach this whole scripture to you but you're all standing amen mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how esther did and what should become of her this you might see is a little nervous twitch of a father and now whenever maid's turn was come to go into the king of hazarus after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purification accomplished to wait six months with oil of myrrh six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women then thus came every maiden and to the king whatsoever she desired was given to her to go with her out of the house of the women and to the king's house i i can't help but just comment on this everything oh saints listen everything you desire to take with you to the king is given to you every good spiritual gift every blessing every divine promise everything that is there is yours to take we don't have to go before the king empty-handed hallelujah i i'm afraid you're not catching the spiritual significance of this the prophet of god said we're living below our privilege it's right here to be given to us and we say well if god wants me to have it he would give it to me i'm sorry to tell you he has already given and we are there deeming ourselves unworthy or uncapable of taking what he's already given oh god help us have confidence people are like well i don't want to come i don't want to look like an arrogant christian well trust me if you're a son or daughter of god and you start to border on arrogance god will correct you otherwise give praise give glory give honor i am the bride of jesus christ exclamation mark period comma semicolon whatever you want to put it mode you have a smiling face emoji of hands clapping whatever it might be this is who you are hallelujah then thus come every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given to her to go with her out of the house of the women into the king's house in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shigaz the king's chamberlain which kept the concubines my brother and sister i don't think i need to explain to you what happened the king didn't sit down and drink tea with her i don't mean to be crass but he made love to her amen that's why they were forever bound to him she came in to the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she was called by name now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but oh my goodness i hope you see these spiritual types that are hidden she required nothing but what god's provided place had already given her wait that's not the words is it let me let me get right back to the words here well haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so esther was taken into king a hazardous unto his house royal in the 10th month which was the month to beth in the seventh year of his reign and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti heavenly father we just ask for your guiding hand today lord we ask father that you would speak lord let us speak only according to thy word we pray in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints hallelujah i i have to admit i just as i look at this i see so many parallels i so many types i see so many things you know my brother and sister you see there's something special about the fact of not requiring nothing more than is already provided you know that is what's happened to many of the women right a type of the church that's happened to many of the women is they felt like they needed some other angle they needed something else that and had not been provided so they provided it for themselves and in fact we'll tie that in scripturally here in just a little bit you see god wants to give us more than just his name that's the problem we have in the denominational realm today is they're happy to just simply have the name but the bride of christ is not there to just settle for the name but she desires all amen as it were typed in the scripture to the half of the kingdom amen so we see now as we continue to look at this story of esther and vashti we see vashti has identified her nature was identified right here in isaiah 4 1 and so we see in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying will we eat our own bread wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach so you see the very nature of vashti often times my brother and sister it's not what is said but the actions that go with it and avashti by nature really all she wanted was the name of the king she wanted to operate in her own realm in her own time and her own place but you see my brother and sister it's there that the prophet of god says one of the gifts that god would give to you and i is the fact that we could die out to ourself and completely surrender to christ so without a complete dying out of the nature we are not a new creature in christ jesus we're a old creature with a new covering or a new veneer and so this doesn't work and so as we look and see this old independent nature is still there it's still controlling the actions the thought process etc and saints don't misunderstand i'm not talking about the fact that we fight a war with his flesh that satan would desire to anoint his flesh and that we sometimes struggle and stumble and make mistakes that is not a desire that we have that is a a warfare in which we might be struck down as it were but raised up again by the hand of god and so it's there in this day-to-day struggle if our nature is opposed to any portion of the word of god the prophet of god said that that actually is an antichrist spirit when our spirit is opposed to the word so you see it's not just the day-to-day struggle but when we actually find ourselves opposed now a position of opposed my brother and sister is not that we're found in air has anyone been found in air i i've definitely been found in here so when we're found in air making mistakes and god comes and corrects us when we accept that correction that is not a spirit opposed to the word right so it's the one that says well we still believe it this way even though the word says different but let's just go right here to verse 2 and see now right here now if you think i'm out on a limb amen you think i'm crazy don't bother me i'm kind of happy here but you know right here my brother and sister isaiah 4 1 fits very much the nature of vashti but 4 2 fits the nature of esther you look at this and see and in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel you see my brother and sister all through the scripture we find there's only one chosen place there's only one way of escape and that is in jesus christ so you get into christ and you then manifest what the word says and it says that the branch of the lord shall be beautiful and glorious amen we're not downtrodden we're not ugly we're not forgotten and we're not even our own we're the escaped of the world we live in now you say this is old testament brother paul but you see my brother and sister the new testament is merely the manifestation of the old testament and so it's there that we escape into christ amen we find ourselves then able to to uh redeem the time redeem the amen right after the earth goes poof and bursts into flames uh his mansion on the ocean his uh millions of dollars of exotic sports cars all his paper money all of his paper paper of bonds and stocks none of that my brother and sister is fire proof but i tell you what god's got a word that would come down into the heart of sons and daughters of god and it would make us not only walk through the natural fire and come out not smelling of the smoke but it will take us through the spiritual fire and bring us out victorious on the other side and the word says that we were called to rule and reign with him my brother and sister that's not of this earthly uh realm here that doesn't then realize how sacred the word is and the obligation of who you are is and that atmosphere was created and as she grows up comes to maturity in that atmosphere it tempered who she was we have a laxadaisical attitude towards the word of god to the house of god that is the kind of children we will raise if we have a sincere on fire serious relationship with god my brother and sister that will be the influence sets the atmosphere around us amen so you look at this and realize that esther why we say whoa that's terrible she's an orphan but you realize that esther is actually blessed to have been raised in the house of mordecai and we're blessed to be raised in the house of god our father amen it is not something to lament it is not something to say oh woe is me we have to go to church a couple times a week we have to do this we have to do that we ought to be thanking god setting an atmosphere thanking god that we are not caught up in just religious uh religiosity amen hallelujah now look at this for just a moment in my father's house i'm just pulling that little paraphrase out of the scripture in my father's house but not in the natural my brother and sister we're not looking to the natural my father's house it might be that you would be raised rich i i would imagine today there's many a child would say oh i would like to be bill gates's child they must have everything well they probably have most of everything but my brother and sister the man has a revelation that many of us don't and he limits his children's tv time and their phone time and their music and their friends he limits everything while he has one agenda for the world he has a revelation to understand that doesn't apply to his children we call that hypocrisy but nevertheless he recognizes the influence of the very thing he propagates he recognizes the influence is negative in my father's house but we're not wanting to deal with the natural in my father's house what are the spiritual my brother and sister in my father's house the angels and the cherubims are presents a holy fire is there in my father's house the presence of god the holy ghost dwells day and night moving freely in my father's house it doesn't matter what room i'm in i'm in his presence in my father's house i'm here not one day to be out of his blessing and another day to be in it but every day i'm in his house i'm in his blessing every day i'm in the house i'm in the word every day i'm in the house i'm in the life amen what it is to be in the father's house you see no matter what we do for our children children let me speak to you for a moment no matter what we would do for you your parents would do for you there comes the day that you will decide for yourself whose house you want to live in well let me tell you we're living in bible times don't go looking back like they had a cream puff they lived in an age that had spirits just like we live in an age with spirits and if you want your children to turn out right then we have to set the atmosphere for them to turn it right we can't just sit back and say well praise god if they're god's children he'll take care of them well i'm telling you what god will do god will take care of dad and mom first and then work on the children or worse yet he'll skip mom and dad and work on the children come on saints lord help us to set an atmosphere great tabernacle god help us send an atmosphere that leads our children to recognize god's will for their life amen you see esther was who she was i believe personally i won't call this doctor and i don't want to put it that way to you but esther was who she was because she was raised in an atmosphere you see there was a preparation in her life for a higher calling now i won't explain to this where this comes from it's not the exact wording i kind of tried to condense it down but you see my brother and sister the old self must be stripped away you know years ago i used to have a painting business done quite well at it anyway you see you don't just put new paint over old paint randomly because when the old paint lets go the new paint goes with it so if you expect it to last you have to make the preparation and take it back now my brother and sister there would be parts of the old that were fine many of us before we came to the message i say many of us i was i was young and and a very very don't fit this mold but many of you prayed read your bibles many of you asked god for wisdom before you came to the message god didn't scrape that away from you he didn't take those things that were godly that were already established in your life and scrape them away but everything that was not of him everything that was kind of unfirm unfrom foundation everything that was flaky he scraped that away because he knew when he come and laid the pure word on you what wasn't tested tried and true would fail right doesn't the fire say everything that goes through the fire i'm just going to condense it down everything that goes through the fire that's not of god will burn up and so it comes down that it's there that the preparation must be taken and it scrapes it down and i'm telling you i'm ashamed to say this but god's still scraping on me amen we can almost change that one song that says god's still working on me god's still scraping on me amen because he's got to get down to where every last little thing that's not of him that won't stand the fire and you say oh god why is this happening to me we should be saying thank you lord it's happening to me because you see if you weren't a son or daughter of god it wouldn't matter because you're not going to make it through the fire anyhow ouch that's rough brother paul that's truth so we should be thanking god for the trials through the struggles through the times we say ah i just feel so so washed out i feel so distracted i feel so this whatever it might be in your life you know and you do that and and you ought to be stopping as the scripture says thank god for the fiery trial amen you want to thank god when you are oppressed to the very limit of your ability and you say i can't go no further and to realize as the little story goes there's only one set of footprints in the sand you realize when you're here going i can't do it no longer lord you haven't been doing it for a long time are we all right this morning you see in preparation for a higher calling the old self must be stripped away and then god doesn't leave you just stripped and empty something's wrong saints if you come and give your heart to the lord and you end up stripped and empty something's wrong you have not approached something correctly someone's lied to you because you see when god strips everything away from us he starts then to build it back up to match the calling our calling can someone say amen this morning our calling what is our calling this morning oh we're not talking about being a pr preacher a song leader or this or that we're talking about the calling of being the bride to the lord jesus christ he'll strip away everything and prepare us to this place can someone lift a hand and say you know what that fits i have gone through this i've had so much stripped away but god is building it back up thank you lord amen hallelujah what's this preparation for so we can go around the world and tell everybody i'm the bride of christ i'm the bride of christ no sir no sir my brother and sister this preparation is very clinical very clinical it's to advance the plan of god right prophet of god said god can only use a man now he's talking about you sisters too god can only use a man he can trust so there has to be some preparation that brings us into a position god can trust us oh hallelujah what are we here for to lift up the plan of god amen and this preparation is also think about esther here this preparation is also for us to be presented amen amen esther went through her year of purification all so she could be presented now this brings a question of which i have no answer for were there others after esther that went through the purification went through the preparation but when esther was chose as queen they were never presented i would have to believe there were either that or we can take another thing from the scripture but then we'd be presuming and that would be somehow or another esther was the last one we could take that to a seventh age bride the culmination the finishing touch i don't think it's something that's going to affect whether we make a rapture or not but my mind works in such fashions i'm like lord did you type this out that of all that was presented before it comes down into a seventh day and there's a bride and you said this is my wife. now my brother and sister i don't know but what i do know is the story shows us that when he come to astor he said this is the one the search did not go on he did not then just go trying to find someone somehow that would surpass esther just in case she's out there oh i tell you what my brother and sister when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and god was coming down through that lamb's book of life he didn't just put your name on a waiting list a holding list a remembrance list just in case there's one better but he wrote your name hallelujah and the lamb smoke of life and said she's the one oh thank you lord now we're not sitting here kind of like at the airport looking at a little screen of waiting to see if somehow or another we still get to get on the flight i sit in an airport sister jerry and i one time and and it was interesting we had our name there trying to get upgraded to better seats and and it never happened but anyway there were people there and literally a man was asking the the lady at the deal he says ma'am i know i'm on this waiting list what do i do to make sure i get on this flight can i give the airline more money what can i do to make sure i get on there and the lady looked at him and says sir everyone in front of you has already paid for their ticket oh i hope you catch that everyone's already paid the price you can't come after the fact and pay a price and move them out of the way and i'm telling you why we couldn't pay the price ourself our lord jesus come and before the foundation of the world he went in there and said i'll shed my blood for you the price is paid you are secured you are in the rapture you are a son you are a daughter oh hallelujah it's not by my merit not my my deed not by my ability hallelujah and as we'll get to a minute i'm getting a little ahead of myself forgive me but it was not even by esther's looks that got her that position she was more fair than any other we say oh he chose her because of her looks my brother and sister he did not choose her because of her looks he chose her for another reason entirely hallelujah amen now look at this we see a transition you see because preparation without presentation is not god's plan you prepare for a rapture a rapture will be there for you you prepare to go to hell hell is there for you god brings about preparation to presentation hallelujah sons and daughters of god they will prepare themselves and they can rest assured that god will present them to what they have been called to hallelujah now look preparation is also to be found worthy now it's not in our own self is it saints there's nothing we can do we can't live holy enough i was reading about some monks in tibet once they commit themselves to that following they never again in their life indulge in anything that would be considered tasty food or indulgent food they never again sleep on a mattress with a pillow but they sleep on a bed of stone they never again go anywhere without someone going with them i can see why a few nights on a bed of stone i'd be fleeing i'd be out of there they'd find me googling in my little rock room nearest motel with comfortable bed but you see they they give up their rights completely and i read a story of a young man who actually through different circumstances end up being brought out of that probably the hand of god and he said at first everything about you rebels everything at first just there's just no way i can't but they never let you outside of the walls of the monastery they never let you anywhere without someone with you and over time you become comfortable with that yes does that sound like a conversion no no a conversion is here we are lord freely i give myself to you lord what you want me to do i don't have to become accustomed over time many of these monks did not live past their 40 in their 40s they didn't even live into their 50th years they were considered an old man to make it that far because this calling that they had was was they slept in the winter time they were cold in the summertime they were hot they were they only ate just the most paltry of food that's how they thought they were going to get to heaven i'm kind of glad saints look i just a little bit of humor i hope you don't mind i'm kind of glad that i just have to die to myself while i still get to enjoy some of the things of this life hey man i still get to eat you know my wife's good cooking amen i still get to enjoy a heat and cool and these kind of things all i have to do is just die to self but yet we might still have as great a battle as they have because you see we live in the realm of laodicea but let us take this back before we move on before there ever was an earth amen god said you're the one amen you're the one i'll write your name down as a testament of that i'll tell you what it makes me really happy you see to be found worthy to come into the throne room look at esther my brother and sister i let me put it this way forgive me if it sounds like an assumption but i don't think vashti ever came to the king unless she was called but here's esther she's confident of her position she's confident of who she is not only does she come to the king uninvited she comes back again to the king to say i want to have a band quit and she has a banquet just so that she can invite the king to come to another band quit because you see the showdown's coming and she knows who she is now she's not just the queen of the kingdom she has now recognized i'm his wife can you imagine now they're there as she's coming into the fourier of uh the anteroom of the the throne room and and they come into that fourier and they're saying esther you can't go in there you go in there and he doesn't raise the scepter esther you're done you're finished and esther was there saying you guys don't understand i'm not just the queen i'm his wife i have relationship with him i'm not afraid of him rejecting me he loves me he chose me he had a choice of all the rest but he chose me oh and that was not an arrogance that was a confidence that she could stand and say i know who i am by the grace of god i know who i am in this great story hallelujah and she come to the room uninvited amen moving into a spiritual element my brother and sister to come this place to be prepared to be this blood washed bride this is not something superficial this is not dressa any old way this is not we we go against the word of god but we sing his praises so therefore he's going to love us my brother and sister a man wants a faithful wife he wants a wife that looks to him to care for him to sustain him and lift him up and become as it were a security this blood washed bride is not a matter of saying jesus died for us praise god the devil will let you say that every day of your life but without the holy ghost those are empty words amen you see my brother and sister to be received of our king is incredible but we here this morning need be able to say something on a more personal note we need to be able to say this is my bridegroom this is my husband amen a lot of people claiming a savior they claim him as healer they claim him as provider they claim him as a lot of things but there's going to be a small number that claims him as husband amen amen hallelujah you see and some people could go through almost everything i named off right there and never be presented that's right oh what a what a what a sad day now look i think this little quote right here kind of sums it up to me listen there's one woman sitting now look pardon me i know i have a warp sense of humor but you see brother branham doesn't skirt around this he says there's one woman sitting hm paul there is fine nice looking beautiful women sitting in this church this morning he didn't he didn't go blind he wasn't lusting after them right but he acknowledged there there is nice fine nice looking beautiful women sitting in this church this morning young woman middle-aged women old women they're all fine they're somebody's wife somebody's daughter somebody sweetheart so forth they're everyone there's one oh my can we make an emphasis on this there is one hallelujah one mrs branham sitting here you're everyone women but there's one mrs william branham she's the one that goes in a rapture i mean goes home with me she's the one is my sweetheart she is the one that's raising my children oh look at this my brother and sister acknowledging a church and i say the same here lovely sisters i love you everyone amen but i have been given one mrs jerry hailett amen one that is mine she's my sweetheart hallelujah and god doesn't have some multitude of some random choice he's got a bride she's his sweetheart and she's going home with him whoa thank you lord hallelujah thank you lord get to go home with him hallelujah now look at that i just thought that's a beautiful quote i hope you see it the same way amen don't just call us queen amen come on saints don't just call us queen in fact i was talking to a brother sometime in the message and he goes i just hate it when people are talking about and they say well this bride is the queen i understood he i he wasn't like making a point but i don't have a problem using the queen just don't leave it there because being a queen doesn't mean that she even loves the king being the queen doesn't mean she even cares and wants to serve the king oh let's call him oh hallelujah i don't want to just be called queen want to be called wife want to be called bride want to hear those little love words that come as it were between a man and his wife wife and her husband those little things that stir the heart we don't want to just have a title out here we don't want to i'll tell you i've said it before i'll say it again i kind of almost am tired i said almost i'm tired of this oh we in the message we're the message we're the message well i'm telling you my brother and sister the devil's got a message amen what is the message doing are we just message followers come on we got to be more than message followers this message called a bride for jesus christ we've got to be the wife the bride we've got to claim our rightful position not just be a follower [Applause] hallelujah oh you see amen excuse me revelations 22 17 you know this scripture but i want to just draw a point out of this and the spirit and the message follower the spirit and the message believer the spirit and bride the one you see for her to be bribed she has to be claimed amen i tell this is a funny joke it won't be funny after jerry beats me but you know i'd already expressed to jerry that i loved her i already kind of pretty much expressed to her you know hinting around you know i love you jerry and she says she said i love you back but i think i heard the door click shut before she must have said it but she told a friend who told a friend who told it to a friend who had a friend and i'm here in idaho and the sister you know i hope this church doesn't have a sister who feels like she's the queen of the busy bodies you don't even want to be a princess of the busy bodies but this sister comes up to me oh brother paul congratulations you know i'm like what are you talking about you're getting married and i was like here's my punchline saying don't i have to ask her first you have an asker no i haven't asked her turns out she'd already told the whole church paul was getting married hallelujah i'll tell you what her revelation my revelation might have been in the same topic line but it didn't stop me i think i drove to washington the next week and asked jerry to marry me i didn't want her to be ashamed [Laughter] look the spirit and the bride she's already claimed she's not a hopeful she's not a wannabe she's not a maybe today she knows she's claimed she already has an identity and the spirit and the bride say common look at this how beautiful this is because we can take every one of these and take this heareth my brother and sister and tie it back to revelation and tie it back to the prophet of god saying that only those with the holy ghost will have a true revelation of this word amen so when you look at this now i'm not trying to do a doctrine or nothing don't misunderstand me as spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth which is bride say come and let him that is a thirst which is bride come amen and whosoever will they're the bride amen let them take the water of life freely it all points back that the anointing of god predestination coming on the soul comes back and points us back again and again and again that god called you before the foundation of the world he put you in the book in the plan wrote it in his own precious blood and sealed it oh hallelujah it doesn't get much firmer than that does it saints do we need some other kind of reassurance that we are the bride of christ my brother and sister god is coming he is coming for a bride now look at this you know and in this thought process it just dawned on me what the next quote is i'm speaking from my heart i didn't even choose this for what it was it just dawns on me as it comes on the screen right here hallelujah yeah i was looking at content i wasn't looking at titles while the true bride anybody know her i've met her i go to church with her hallelujah you guys ought to be proud of me i go to church with her the true bride attracts the attention of god by wearing her fashions i could say a lot of things there but i feel like the lord just checked me while the true bride attack attracts the attention of god by keeping his word amen right amen now notice let us notice christ you say well now wait a minute what about this beauty you're talking about the bible said in isaiah 53 2 that when jesus came there was no beauty of him that we should desire him that's right congregation says amen there's no beauty if he would have come in worldly beauty as satan is today the people would have run around him and accept him the way they do the church today they would have believed him received him as they do satan today certainly they would but he didn't come in that kind of beauty but he always comes in the beauty of character oh thank you lord amen that gives an out to some of us that aren't so good looking amen god's not looking at our looks and that's why i make this claim earlier and i stand behind it believe it with all of my heart that king hazardous did not look at esther and say my goodness she's the most beautiful woman i ever saw i gotta marry her he'd already had a woman that was renowned for her beauty but at this point he learned a lesson and now he's there and said you know what i'm not gonna marry just for beauty she is beautiful but look at the character that she has and you know how she got that character [Music] no no her parents die we don't know how they died she's raised up in a world that's difficult you know how mean children can be i can see esther as a little girl in school esther where did you lose your parents did you get rid of them i wish i could get rid of mine and asked her there and her heart breaking she never chose that and mordecai i don't think he was a slacker i don't think he said now children if you feel like it tonight excuse me children if you feel like it tonight before you go to sleep you'll read your bible i think mordecai said esther for your head hits that pillow you're going to read your bible tonight but you see we don't want to hurt our tender little children's feelings they might have no self-esteem when we're done with them okay well what you're worried about losing their self-esteem you're not worried at all about losing their soul we ought to be more worried about losing their soul amen god can deal with the self-esteem hallelujah i hope you don't think i'm too harsh you see he always comes in the beauty of character there christ wasn't a beautiful great strong stout man god doesn't choose that kind hallelujah amen i'll tell you this this quote is a little bit influenced to me that i think esther had a character that was stunning i think there was something about her i can see now look let me throw another thing i'm sorry that's the way my brain works i'm not trying to make doctrine out of it he invites her raises the scepter right now the proper etiquette saints is that when she come we'll just use this mic stand here when she come to the throne with the scepter raised out she placed her fingers on the end of the scepter it wasn't a haphazard hey husband and flop down in the chair hmm there was a little respect there was a little continuity there we're one but still god has a plan and what does he do next he says you know what esther i'm going to give you even up to the half of my kingdom now i'm telling you what saints now pardon me for using this word because we should call no man fool but a man would be foolish to ever go into business with a foolish partner that's the truth that's absolutely right he just offered half of his kingdom to her oh macy's here i come no sir you know why he could make that offer well i don't know where some of you shop maybe you don't like macy's excuse me if i picked the wrong store you know why he could offer that because he already knew how she would run her half of the kingdom he already knew that she would be there saying my husband likes this and he doesn't like this my husband sees it this way and not this way and she would say and that matters to me that's right now i want you to think about the church world we live in today my brother and sister they're running their half of the kingdom any old way they please he my husband likes this i like this my husband wants this i'm gonna do this no no i think king hazardous learned his lesson and he says look this woman has character and praise god she's beautiful young men heed that amen you find the list beauty ought to be down the list of ways amen character should be right at the top that's the prophet's words good cooking ought to be somewhere in there then if she's beautiful hey praise the lord you have got it hallelujah but i just really want to go back to that very top while the true bride attracts the attention of god by keeping his word never how big a church is never how beautiful a church is how good or choir is how good all this or that the other it is amen it's the word that's it oh hallelujah oh my amen where does time go can somebody tell me i'd like to travel there and redeem it now look we're on the last quote when god is took at his word he's able to provide whatever he has need of now you notice i'm getting a little nitpicky here okay i will admit this he didn't say he's able to provide whatever you need what he needs that's right right that's exactly right he's able to provide whatever he has need of god jehovah jireh is still jehovah jireh tonight he has sacrifice already provided i got excited when i read this i hope you guys catch this he has a church provided you realize before i even knew i was part of this he already had me provided hallelujah he has a messenger provided the holy spirit he's here now now those people that keep struggling there's a certain crowd that just keeps struggling whether god is here now it's just the holy ghost just put it inanimate off to the side so holy ghost i'm sorry the prophet of god said it's all god amen the prophet of god says right here unless you think this just stopped in 1962 amen that he has a messenger provided the holy spirit he's here now jehovah jireh the lord has provided himself a bible a spirit a church someone say amen and message a messenger and the hour is here now for the church to be raptured and taken home jehovah jireh look at the office how god defines himself amen in morphe putting on the mask jehovah jireh will provide the means to take the church out of this world you won't provide it i won't provide it he'll provide it hallelujah we get all fretted i'm not a good enough christian lord help me i fail you you just stand on the word and keep claiming it and stand there and stand there and he will provide the rapturing faith that it takes to change this mortal body we can never provide it for ourselves we can never attain to it but he'll provide it amen by transforming these feeble bodies of ours can i insert something here without changing the message by transforming these feeble bodies well that should already been done maybe it'll happen right now it better happen before the year 2021 is over or else we got serious doubts should happen in 77 sorry he didn't say when he was gonna transform these feeble bodies hallelujah i can bring you a quote if you want whether brother brown said it might be a hundred years a lot of people are going to die my brothers and sisters a hundred years all of the old established witnesses of this message would be gone does that mean the message goes with it sorry the message is not about man it's about jesus christ same yesterday today forever hallelujah come on saints don't start putting time lapses on god don't start putting if this don't happen by this time here and that don't happen like this then i'm probably finished you do that you might as well just quit right now but faith takes the halts of the promise and doesn't let go hallelujah sister ruth would you come the piano jehovah jireh will provide the means to take that church out of this world by transforming these feeble bodies of ours and take them up into glory jehovah jireh how will it come to pass in a modern day like we're living in that these things will be so interesting i i like science as well as anyone does i think or close maybe not so much but one of the stories that always intrigued me was these students that went to a university back east and this quite a few years ago when did do you guys remember the days when carbon dating was just it was in the news all the time we've carbon dated this and it's this many million and this carbon dated this and we carbon dated that and one of these graduate students i'm guessing he wasn't quite a believer in carbon dating and they had been climbing up they kind of did this research thing up in the mountains and uh back east there in the uh mountains were old what they call old mountains and they were gathering specimens to take back and carbon date and as kind of a joke he dug down in the bottom of the fire pit and he took this chunk of charred wood and put it in a research bag and sealed it now the people that are doing the carbon dating they only take notes this is specimen number blah blah blah they don't know anything about it and this piece of half charred firewood was like 1.2 million years old kid got expelled from school over that he was making a mockery of their great science now my brother and sister if we're so caught up in this world that we can't trust god then this last line right here will become a major stroke in your life how will it come to pass without faith it is impossible to please god how it will come to pass will be this bride the esther of our age right amen who says i trust him completely because you see with one bit of doubt satan will zero in on that doubt and then he will offer evidence after evidence after evidence after evidence of why that can't be so how will it come past in a modern day i like honestly how brother brown puts this he doesn't say how will it come to pass where we're living he's putting it right down into this great scientific day where young people interviewed on college campuses look into the camera and say i was raised in church but science has proven the bible is false what is it a modern day amen as it was in the day of noah a great scientific age so shall it be the coming of the son of man amen but i'm telling you my king is on the throne i have access to him 24 hours a day i don't have to go in there and go through a great ceremony all i have to do is present myself oh hallelujah oh let's just stand and praise the lord for a moment before we dismiss oh thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord brother jason help me friend hallelujah jesus name
