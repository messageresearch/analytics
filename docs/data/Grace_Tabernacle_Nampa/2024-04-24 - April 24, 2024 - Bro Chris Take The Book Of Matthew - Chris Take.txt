H to a new place Lord in our walk with you we ask we thank you Lord Jesus we love you so much in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight let's turn to Matthew chapter 9 my apologies to the sound guys I thought Alex was back there so he has several text messages that won't do us any good now um but we're going to go to Matthew chap 9 verse 1-13 Matthew chapter 9 verse1 and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own City and behold they brought to him a man sick of the paly lying on a bed and Jesus seeing their faith said unto to the sick of the py son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemeth and Jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think you evil in your hearts for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk but that you but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on Earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the he arise take up thy bed and go into thy house and he arose and departed to his house but when the multitude saw it they marveled and glorified God which had given such power unto them and as Jesus passed forth from then he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receip of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him and it came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples and when the Pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and Sinners and when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick but go ye and learn what that meth and th will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am not come to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated tonight I was reading in my devotions just a couple days ago and and I read Matthew chapter N9 and you know in in verse 9 there when Jesus calls Matthew Matthew being uh a humble and and um careful man doesn't spend time on himself he keeps the focus on Jesus and his life and and the gospel and and and so I I was thinking about Matthew and and here he is he's a tax collector and I mean he's got everything going for him he has the protection of the Roman Empire he is an elected official he has he's making good money and seemingly all is is is in his favor but leading up to this in this verse something began to happen in the life of Matthew and he his whole life there was something he wanted and his whole life there was something missing he he had a desire to to fill the void and and he he didn't he didn't didn't fit in as a Jew because he was a tax collector I mean look at zakus and and everything that he went through and he was a Publican and he he he he spent time with these people and and here he is and and and Jesus walks by and and Jesus just just got done he he gets in the ship he comes over to his own City and he and he and he sees a man that's sick and he reaches down and he says you know I forgive you your sins and that's the first thing that he deals with and we know that brother Brandon in the in the line would say hey if you come here without sin dealt with the the holy spirit is going to expose that because it needs to be taken care of right so the man is is Forgiven and he he's given his healing and and the Pharisees or the scribes just I mean they're never happy no matter what Jesus did they were never happy he heals a man they ridicule him for healing him he didn't heal a man they ridicule for not healing him he heals on the Sabbath they accuse him of breaking the Sabbath he doesn't heal on the Sabbath and they accuse him of just everything after a one thing after the other and his disciples are are were were all men of of you know they weren't the upper class they weren't the people that everyone said hate those guys are fitting for Disciples of Christ you have Peter and you had had Andrew and and John you know maybe maybe John had a little bit of favor with with some of the the Pharisees there but still he's the son of a fisherman and and they just they're the they're the ones who who might be at synagogue and might not because maybe they found a way to get around the rules of the Sabbath and get some more fish and and so these are these are who that Jesus is surrounded by and Jesus himself not to mention was was a a a bastard child from their Viewpoint you know it didn't have a father speculations of whatever was a Roman soldier or something passing through Nazareth and and then again what can what good could even come of Nazareth because we all know that place is just the scum of the earth so this definitely is not the prophet and and then Joseph and and Mary and and so this is this is the the view the world has of Jesus and I and I know tonight this is this is simple and stuff we all already know or we should know but I think sometimes I know I know sometimes we have to be reminded what it the point is brother bram's Ministry came to reveal what Jesus Christ so when the word came sunset Mountain The Sword in his hand the the opening of the word the third poll the the messages preached the the rejection of his Ministry and all of these things and the Seven Seals they all were did one thing they exposed more of Christ amen and we receive the word and we receive Revelation but that understanding in the back of the book what is it that that final when you get to the final seal all of the book is open amen it's the last one now there's all of the book you see to fight all of the darkness God needed all of his word in your life so when we get to that point if it was like a journey you know we learn about Jesus dying on the cross and we progress and we find the word of God and we understand more of it and and and we understand these things like the seals and what it was in Revelations what he was talking about and and the condition of the world and where we are in the church ages and how this all fits all that does is circle back around to point us to Jesus Christ that's right yes sir and there are four books in the Bible that we call the gospels that are all about Jesus Christ now he's with through the whole Bible you understand but this is what he did how he lived and this is where we are today because as it was in the days of the son of man so shall it be or right today in our day so we are not to become Pharisees with the knowledge of the message we we are not to become Sadducees with the knowledge of the message we are not to become publicans with the knowledge of the message the word of God should be Revelation that then brings a life with it amen there should be no issue me Brother David talking about this the other day there should be no blocker or nor issues in explaining the Seven Seals to a 13year old or a 12year old it's Jesus Christ and there's scriptures that bring all of this in to a to a to a a view and then lay this out for us to see but this right here is where we walk every single day amen there's Pharisees and there's Sadducees yet what do we have today we have a well this church and that church and we don't talk to that church and we can't agree with them and I'm not talking about doctrinal issues I'm talking about personality problems and and we come to church and we say well you know we're the christas preaching again and we turn our ears off and or or the pastor well if I was the pastor I would do it this way and and and all we are doing is acting like Pharisees well Jesus you know I almost believed him but then he healed the man on the Sabbath I mean you know what the one from Heaven would not do that there is no way you see we got the message and we got the Bible and then we interpret it through our ideas and that's the kind of stuff that we talk about that's right the whole point and the whole focus of everything that we do as Christians is Jesus Christ not just the man Jesus or or the deity Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ in us living through us when we go in the grocery store and we see somebody who's struggling we should look at them like Jesus look at Matthew say come follow me amen you have been given a power as a as a child of God you have been given a power don't abuse it you are a son of God you are a daughter of God by the way in in English classical English he is both so when we say son of God that includes for you sisters the world has messed it up today but anyways that's how it's supposed to be amen so I can say he and you just fill in the blanks but so God has called you to to this position and and and we are not to to to to spit to to we are not to just reiterate knowledge of of phrases and and just re repeat scriptures and repeat quotes all that gets us is is the knowledge without the life and I you know we we've we just become like this and and here we we here we have Matthew and I mean never mind the guy Jesus heals the man of the py and and all they can do is well how dare he forgive their sin his sins how how dare he operate you know he's a blasphemer and then and then and then he calls Matthew and and now we have a new member in the church and what are we we're not excited we're upset him come on him they walk through the back door and you look at them and you say if they would dress better then I would accept them in the sanctuary I'm sorry did God make you judge no he says judge not that you be not judged amen amen he didn't say Don't Preach the word he said don't judge and we have to be careful with that because we can go too far to say well don't judge me I'll live all I want but a child we're talking about child of God not talking about those people out there we're talking about CH you us right here me you and our viewpoints and we get in the flesh because we're not praying enough and and and we act like this these people so God heals somebody and we we're just upset because well you know praise the Lord they got healed but you know they go to that church so that's what we think and and I'm guilty amen what's the point why why are we do do we change a church because God leads us to or do we change a church because we are unhappy with the situation we are unhappy with then it's just politics and we're swapping community centers says well I don't want to go to NAA Community Center anymore so I'm going to go to colge well yeah that's right and or you live in Green Leaf and you're like well no way I got to go to the Boise so you drive through Caldwell Nampa Meridian Cuna Eagle all it boisey now if God LED you there by all means praise God go and do it but why is there this mentality that God cannot call this I don't know where this is coming from but God cannot call a pastor to move four blocks down and start a church why is that an issue cuz we're building kingdoms Jesus said go you into all the world and preach the gospel baptizing in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and these shines shall follow them that believe amen Paul he in his letters to Corinthians or the Galatians or Romans or uh Ephesians you know he gets after them he tells them look it's not politics it's not about all of this and and and or it's not about letting why are you letting this man in he's blasphemed the Holy Spirit he's he's the disruptor to the church and and and then he he closes the letters with can't wait to see you again I love you we're sending a brother to see you a brother's on his way give this brother my greetings you know brother brandham in the story of Perry per Green's testimony the only thing that I can remember from that testimony I watched it a young age I could go back I guess but um one thing I remember is is brother Bram telling Perry green I don't I remember who the men were it doesn't matter but he was telling them you know how all the things that they had terrible things they had done to him and his ministry and his reputation and and all of this stuff and they're on a long drive road trip and and they pull into a gas station and brother B says oh by the way those guys you're talking about they live up around the corner we should go say hi to them say God bless them and Perry Green's like are you kidding me like you just told me all the stuff about how ter how terrible they are which that's not what he was saying but all the things they did to you and you want to reach out to them saints of God we have fallen short we have fallen short for for for for a man of his position and and you people couldn't tell him his enemies apart from his friends and and we say oh praise God we have the seals and and and brother you need to preach deeper than that brother mam said learn your ABCs first and and then we'll move on from there and you and you wonder why what happens is why why people get the knowledge of of of of of the seals and in if they get the knowledge of it they try to tell you about it and it doesn't make any sense and they don't live the gospel they have a revelation of it they tell you about it you says oh that's that's um that's Matthew chapter 8 or that's Matthew whatever that's Luke or that's Mark right it's relatable because it's Christ but if it's just knowledge they're repeating what they have heard it doesn't make any sense you can't explain the gospel of Christ you live the gospel of Christ you preach the gospel of Christ start under the anointing of what Revelation so the Pharisees and the Sadducees I mean nobody knew the message better than them nobody did right right they knew the quotes and the paragraphs and they could talk about it they they knew all of it and they could talk about it yet when Jesus came and said blessed are those they said no man speaks like this man that's right why because Jesus was talking about himself self and when you have a revelation of Jesus Christ in your day to you personally and you talk about him you're talking about yourself am you've been there you've met him amen you're not you're not you know the two Runners that that went the one Runner said let me run let me run let me run and job says you don't have a message he says let me run let me run so he runs for what to get out of breath and and then he's just you go stand to the side wait till the messenger actually comes but he wanted to be important and that's what happens we want to be important so we start talking about stuff or we start preaching about stuff we don't have a revelation of that's right and and what we have nothing we have there's no life there the man had a message but he's like yeah I think this and maybe that happened and I thought I saw this and that's how we sound that's how we sound well I think brother B was talking about the third polling and then he said this over here and we just say third pole and Seven Seals and people think we know what we're talking about and then we go outside and we don't even act like Christians we don't even treat each other like Christians but we're message and it's not even that but we go to this church first I mean most people first time you meet them I didn't know this is going to come out like this the first time you meet them say where were you what church are you from now I'm guilty of that too but a lot of times it's because I want a little bit of a background check but but that being said we still have to give the person the benefit of a doubt I'm I mean a secular man he's a he's a well he's not secular but he's not a Believer he's denominational Christian he gave me the best advice I ever heard which you know we say that but there's been we hear things and sometimes it doesn't stick okay so he said it and it's stuck he said always assume the best of people always assume always assume good intentions you see if you really had the faith that the Holy Spirit would lead you and you met somebody you wouldn't be afraid of their viewpoints that's right amen the reason you're afraid of their viewpoints is because you don't even know what you believe that's right I was fellowship with a brother and he was talking about some cousins he have that he has that are that are a part of this church and and so he said well why don't you you know agree with them I don't know we just don't well what do you believe that's different I don't know they're just wrong that's not just one little that's an issue that's a you w't talk about a pandemic that's a pandemic right well I don't know we just don't agree what the reason you don't know is because you don't know what you believe do you know what you believe the Pharisees and Sadducees thought they knew but then Here Comes Jesus and and I I read this I read the scripture here of the scribes who said within the this man blasphemeth and the first thing that came to my mind was he was doing what they knew they should do but they couldn't bring their themselves to do it you see where you have two workers and and one just you know he kind of doesn't always do it the right way and then you get hire the new guy and the new guy's got pep and ambition and and and quickly the other guy realized is wow I'm really falling short and if he's got character about him he'll pick it up if he doesn't have character he'll start pointing his finger at the guy who's actually doing the job and all this comes from what people not in their positions right that's it why do you go to now this is this is just an example why do you go to that church they can't tell you why why do you live there they can't tell you why people get really really funny about you know if you move you know we I have friends who have moved from places and they're just like why would you leave this church you know down in down in Phoenix and they move somewhere else and people are like well why and it's like well it this isn't the only the only church this isn't just where the bride of Christ is this is this is just not the ministry God has for me anymore anymore so I'm going to go over here and if we didn't care which brother Ron doesn't but if we didn't care about who was in our church and who wasn't in our church that wouldn't matter but we care why do we care about that why do we care about what position we hold in the church now if it's something burning on your heart you should care if it's a position you have that God called you to you should care you should you should you should have honor in that position and hold forth to God what God has given you but if we're unhappy we say well we don't want to just sit on the Pew we want to do this why why do you want to do it what exactly Brother David what is your motive and objective I the quote we'll read this quote here and and brother Bram he says he says we'll come back to the quote I'll read the end of it just right now Jesus didn't pay any attention to that he had one thing to do that was the will of God he went moving on Eve the Garden of Eden if she would have had one intent follow the will of God she would have not stopped and talked to the devil right your brother or your sister's not the devil that's right but you stop in your mind in your vain imaginations you stop and you talk to the devil he says well that person yeah yeah you know me me and my wife dealt with something she she just had some difficult times in her pregnancy and and I have to be honest with you there were some times there where I was very afraid and I was like Lord is this you are you preparing me for something and and everything that I went through I just all of the sudden the Lord just actually I I the last time I preached after I preached it was just like it lifted and and I just look back and I realized every element of that so-called uh premonition or or or or uh is that the right word premonition was all based on fear and I said devil you were whispering in my ears and I listened to you sorry move on and he did because if you resist the devil he will flee and even the devil and his angels are subject to the word of God so the Bible says resist the devil he will flee guess what you resist he looks in the scripture and he says all right angels He resisted let's go he has to he hates the word of God because he has to listen to it amen so it lifted and I realized it was all based on fear and so the point I'm trying to make is many times we he says well I have a word of the Lord and we don't go back to check to check it it just feels right we're in the church and and there's anointing and it feels right and we're at home and and there's a song on and it feels right or or we're at home and it feels right but then you take it through the word you take it through the filter of the Holy Ghost and it falls to Pieces why don't we do that amen why do we you know why well the answer is is the answer to the question is easy and I'm not asking you to answer the question I'm asking you to ponder next time you come to this place CU we all need it from the greatest to the least we all need the reminder the will of God only and move on Amen Jesus had to constantly fight that that's right when the Pharisees would come to him and tempt him he he you know brother Bon was preaching and he said he was talking about an incident where a man was just being basically you know kind of just rude about the word and argument argumentative I don't know if it was to brother brandom or something brother bam read but he says and I tell you I wish I had had one minute with that guy I'd set him straight and the and he stopped and he says oh the Lord didn't appreciate that you see even the prophet wasn't allowed to just go out and set that man straight and here we are amen and that's what we do we don't always go to the person a lot of times it's in our in our heads and we just set them straight in our heads and and now every time you this is the problem every time you deal with that person you are filtering it through what you have decided their intentions are you're not fil so when they do things or they you know look away while you're talking they're just looking because there was a person walked and something caught their attention you think oh they don't care what I'm talking about don't take your Halos off you can pick them back up later brother Ivan will have them for you when you leave so we should have one focus in the well let's read this quote now and I apologize that we don't have it and I imagine somebody run and told the priest so he's talking about this because later on in the Book of Matthew which by the way the title tonight is the Book of Matthew later on down in this chapter Jesus he he heals gyrus his daughter and so brother bam is referencing that in this sermon the healing of gyrus his daughter and he says I imagine somebody run and told the priest and here they all come down oh drama right let's go set I mean we got to get down there this is happening and well we'll see what he can do now we'll just look around Let's test his religion let's see what he believes if he don't believe according to our Doctrine we won't have nothing to do with him do you realize Jesus was preaching the Scrolls They Knew by heart he was living the Scrolls They Knew by heart and they couldn't see it and don't just say well their eyes are blinded they were but we can be the same condition and and the children of God with our eyes open but we can't see the beam in our eyes so we judge it through our own experiences rather than the word of God and he says well this is the way it is and that's how it is and we base it off that and we go years in that position and we never stop to say God what do you think about that God is this the right attitude to have any attitude like this is wrong just so you know amen I don't believe you know we'll go down and see that you you're starting off on the wrong foot they got exactly what they expected right you go to a church service or you come to church or maybe you have issues because sometimes the devil will come to us and whisper in our ear and we stop and we listen and then every time we come to church and the pastor preaches we have an issue okay that happens to child children of God sons of God what we have to do is we have to we have to trust the Lord to show us that happened and then when he shows us the devil's EXP and we're free amen you want to change the world around you start by changing yourself as soon as you start to look to your brother or look to your sister and say if they would change this would fix you got a beam in your eye because you look to your brother you look to your sister you say Lord oh forgive me I'm not praying hard enough for them amen I'm not reaching out enough to them the culture we live in and this is probably mostly towards the people who are online more often you know what everybody's anointed whether they're online or not the condition of the world we live in today the anointing of the world we live in today is very much all about me yes sir so we have to deal with that every day that's right every day we get up the devil's going to say you need to take better care of yourself and what is his definition of that it's not the word of God it's a nap or a fictional book or a movie or a a different song or dinner out or and does it help M you wake up the next day hung over from the world said man I feel even worse than I did yesterday so you try again and the Lord's then the Lord reminds you and says you know when you're tired you need to do the thing you least want to do right you want to do it okay when I would do good evil was present with me Paul says so you want to do it but it's the least thing your flesh wants to do your flesh doesn't want to sit there and read in the Bible about how it needs to straighten up your flesh wants to partake of something that appeases it that's right and the spirit of Christ within you is a gentleman that's it so he'll just send you little love notes the flesh demands I need this and I need it now just one time don't get what you asked the waitress for and you'll see what your flesh wants that's it still times don't change very much he says anyhow we'll just find out what he believes and if he don't come just to our hueing line now Pharisees and Sadducees we're in the same church okay so don't cast this outside of the walls of the church we can have this attitude today and if he don't come just to our heing line we won't have him in our synagogues he never says Doctrine he doesn't talk about the doctrine he says right to our heing line in other words our view of the same thing our view our opinion on the scriptures a lot of times these things that are AR call cause arguments and and have caused issues and for me between me and our brothers you know God's had to deal with with me so I'm being fully transparent tonight have nothing to do with our salvation but goodness we will die on that hill and in doing so offend our brother the Bible says a brother offended is harder to be one than a walled City amen have you ever besieged a walled City NOP well we have cuz we've all offended a Breen at some point there's none of them Fanatics so he says we don't and if we don't just come come just to our Hing line we won't have him in our synagogues there's none of them fanatic Revival is going to be around here of Healing The Sick and things we won't cooperate with him one bit I know Peter the fisherman he's a good friend of mine and I know I knew Matthew the publicans so forth the same as Levi I knowed him the tax collector good honest boy I knowed him real well but he's come over here now to start a Revival you see he's saying we can have the same attitude and they were happy as long as Matthew was a Publican but as soon as he joins up with this man Jesus and starts living a clean and Godly life well he joined up with them so that was too bad never mind he's not doing drugs anymore never mind he's not out carousing with women and running the streets never mind he's got a he's got a stable job and a good family no we don't care about that he's going to the wrong church and we're upset I don't know this is maybe it's for people like you but he's come over here now to start a Revival and first thing we're going to test his Doctrine and find out what he believes then we'll see whether we can cooperate with him or not well I mean that sounds okay check his Doctrine but that was just a final excuse to make their attitude to to to uh give credibility to their bad attitudes oh well do Doctrine brother to can't you know was it Amos can't can't be yolked together you if you know if you disagree so we just drive bigger wedges and I'm not trying to preach some kind of unity that's you know dogmatic or do denominational I'm just talking about we just have different views on on things things like you know dancing in church or or or getting excited or or whatever like whether you dance or you don't doesn't mean anything and it doesn't mean you're going to whether you believe it's okay or you don't believe it's okay it doesn't mean you're one or the other's not going to go in the Rapture it's just your view your opinion you're it's the way you like it you know say well we need to have the songs this way now and and as long as we stay within the confines of the word of God that's what matters but I'm not talking about breaking truth right I'm not talking about breaking truth but we use that excuse well it's false Doctrine what is false Doctrine I don't know it's just not the right way well and then you get down to the B very very very bottom of it and it's like oh okay you know they had this over there and you weren't invited so now here we are 20 years later I I know of congregations that were Bound by this spirit for 30 30 years or more that's right and it took the work and the patience of a Gods sent man to slowly for 10 to 15 years for God to turn turn the big ship do we want to waste time doing that I want to go home I'm ready for a Rapture okay well if I was ready we wouldn't be here right but you know what I'm say what I'm saying I'm ready to stop worrying about all of this and to just get my life it if we would just focus more on our own lives and what we need from God and we would come to church and we say God I I just I need you I need you to speak to me and and actually brother bam says to pray for your brother and God will meet your needs so maybe I need to rephrase that we say God speak to your people God coming and and ministering and on Monday we say God it's Monday most of the Believers are at work and they're doing this Lord calm down and you'll get on fire praying for them and they're the ones already on fire you see the gospels of Matthew Mark Luke and John I was talking to my wife the other day and maybe a little bit of righteous indignation and I don't mean this harmful in any way whatsoever you just wonder sometimes why people come to church I want you to come to church I don't care what your struggles are I don't care your viewpoints come to church because this is a special place that God has set aside that's right for you for you to be spoken to so maybe your life's a mess but you come to church God is here maybe life's not at maybe God's not in your home but God is here yeah so come to church but some people you want to ask them why do you come to church what is your what's the what's the goal we have come to the place where we have a bunch of method meist message Believers we have a bunch of Catholic message Believers not that they came from Catholicism they were rais in the message but they walk on their knees up to the you know hypothetically speaking they they they skin their knees on the dirt coming to church and because they're doing a Catholic Penance and and they and they they they whip themselves and and it's just there's there's no there's no fruits gained in it or they or they're methodists and everyone has to be you know if you're going to sing you got to have a choir's robe on don't get up there and sound like a you know sound like a cat with its tail caught never mind the Holy Spirit fell down and everybody was just blessed but you didn't have a choir robes so we can't hear you sing or you didn't keep it to 30 minutes or you didn't didn't keep it to 15 minutes or you preached Too Short don't you know goodness but the Bride Can preach all night well but did did God have make his did God say what he wanted to say yeah well what and then you know no matter what you do they're mad but then God comes and God speaks and then when God speaks it doesn't matter how long it is and they miss that that's what he's saying it doesn't matter how long if it's short or if it's long when God is speaking it doesn't matter to the elected bride of Jesus Christ but we put a Time Li and say well if they really were revelated they would preach for 3 hours if they really revelated they would do this and here we are in the Book of Matthew here we are in the Book of Mark and Luke and John and Jesus is just out there doing the will of God never mind what they had to say you know what they want to do Jesus disciples come to him and says well can we just call fire down on them they don't agree with us they don't believe you they call you be why not Jesus says oh you've missed the point have I been so long with you right that's what he's saying when we act like that he looks at us and he says have I been so long with you I mean when was when when did The Sword come down to brother Bam's hand 80 70 something years ago you know the message begin to take root and and where are we today where we are is the seed shall not be able to Shu so God anoints his ministers to preach down the line for you to first of all shuck what's holding you down and to weed it out that's 11th Hour worker we that's what we're here doing we're weeding we're weed eating and you can't use a weed eater weed eater cuz you'll break the wheat you go in there with the string trimmer and you just start going to town guess what you're going to cut the wheat and that's what happens when ministers get upset they go to with the stram Timmer says well y'all just a bunch of devils he got the wheat the weed but he also got the wheat we have to go through and handpick because it's all mixed together just break it up break it up break it up separate it gent gent gently gently gently a little bit of more love here oh this wheat kind of wrapped around this tear so be real gentle as you separated and don't break the weed that's where we are today there is no one-size fits all and we can't judge a person's condition because we are not God we can see and say yeah they have some growing to do yes of course if if a if a young lady or a young man comes into church and they're dressed like the world of course it's obvious but don't judge them and say well yeah there ain't nothing there CU they wouldn't dress like that if there was no give them time that's right give them time instead what we want is we want conformism we want them to come to church all right I like this church I'm going to keep coming here we want them to come the next time with hair down to their ankles dress modestly it doesn't always work that way and and I know I know right this is this that's the norm but we still have these things once in a while where it gets under our skin and we get prickly we get prickly why are we we're not getting enough rain we're not getting enough water in our lives amen because we're so busy being Christians yeah amen we're not called to be Christians we're called to serve the Lord we're called to have a relationship with Christ Christian means Christlike if you're trying to be Christlike you're going to fail time but if you're trying to yield to Christ then they'll call you Christian but see Christian is a word and it has a definition and so we try to align ourselves and others to that definition and that definition is different depending on which church you go to because if you're a real Christian you know you'll run around the church or if you're a real Christian you will I I can't think of any examples so maybe that's the Lord but you understand what I'm saying but if you're if you get anointed you get excited goodness don't sit there and hold it back run the aisles because you're just expressing Christ and sometimes our bodies Can't Hold Us can't hold still but let's be like imagine Matthew that's kind of where we were Matthew he gets called this this is what I want you to remember when God walked up to the tax Booth you were sitting in counting the Wagers of everyone that owed you says well they did this they did this they hold this they need to pay this much that's all Matthew did they'd come and I can pay this much I can only pay this much take his kids no please no sorry you got to pay the bills you got to pay your taxes well I just started a business and no take his business take it all no we don't care you got to pay now but the crop is no crop comes whatever good we'll get the money give it to me that was his life that's what he did and to have a man he knew who Jesus was he came to the city he was from the Bible says to his own City and he walked through imagine that imagine that you actually as a tax collector were living in the city of God and you didn't even know it and then God came along and says you don't belong to them you belong to me you were always part of him you were always part of his City but he had to call you imagine Matthew in this position and who he was and you know he had to hide on his way to work because if they caught him in the alley they'd really give it to him and he gets to work and now now he has the protection of the Romans and he he's got a you know he's locked in there nobody can break in and heard him and he's now he's bold right and this was Matthew and then Jesus Walks By The Man He's heard so much about and when he heard about Jesus this was you and I when we heard about Jesus something in our hearts amen jumped that's John in the womb of your soul leapt amen and come to life and you said there's something about that and then Jesus walks by and and says Matthew follow me he called him by name Matthew follow me what did you do what did I do we're here tonight we said okay Lord I'm coming I'm coming Jesus probably made him run a little bit too wait don't leave me you would run why God wants to see your desperation God wants to see how much you're willing to put on the line to serve him because he wants all of it on the line amen since we're in the Book of Matthew in in in chapter 8 I believe it is the Centurion comes to Jesus and I was reading this the other day and and it just struck me it's it's um Matthew 8 verse 5 and when Jesus was entered into capernum there came unto him a centurion in beseeching him so that being said about Matthew he's the man who wrote this book right how is he going to write it he's a lion anointing Matthew was he knew what it was to be the worst of the worst to be in that position not right somebody who was noted Rich had everything going for him and to turn their his back on that so his life drastically changed Peter and them they were fishermen I don't know they probably did a lot of sleeping Outdoors already not not I'm not demeaning their testimony at all but I'm saying this is the view this is the person that God wrote the book through amen and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the py grievously tormented and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him now I did a quick search but the amount of times where Jesus says I'll come I'll come I'll come heal him he waits for them usually to ask yes sir but Jesus knew the Centurion had the faith to say no you just speak the word so he tested him the Centurion didn't have to say anything more he could have just said okay he didn't he had he could have just agreed with Jesus but Jesus was testing his faith you God sees your faith and what does he do he doesn't this is a bit tongue and cheek he doesn't reward it he tests it amen he sees your faith for your healing and he tests it he makes you worse amen he sees your faith for deliverance and he really puts the has the devil come down he really puts you through the ringer and he sees he sees you're you're you're getting you know you have the faith to just be a support and and what does he do he sends somebody to just offend you in church he's testing your faith if your Faith's being tested it's because Jesus Christ sees your her faith amen and it's identified to him so he's testing it I think brother stepen on Sunday said it beautifully to show you sometimes what you're capable of as a child of God Abraham probably didn't realize the faith that he had in Jehovah but God put it to the test God knew what was in Abraham's heart he knew his faith so he tested it it's like in school you know the teacher sees you're doing real good so he gives you a big old quiz you're thinking my goodness I thought it was doing good exactly and you go to the test and you test 100% and guess what he promotes you you see we want to be promoted without the test we want to be lifted up high without very good right the backside of the desert very good sir we want to be Matthew without being a tax collector we want to be the one right and then we you know how many people wanted to be Paul in the early days wow Paul you know yeah he did all this but look where he is now and then look at the price he had to pay not on his death that was the easy part surrender to God hey I'm going to Glory but sitting in prison chained to a Roman I mean a miserable life for the past few years but what did he do he just wrote the word of God the beauty that comes from our lives when God puts us to the test and he crushes the olive right the oil comes forth so he says I will come and heal him theeran answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should us come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he marel and said to them that follow verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in his Israel you see the Centurion understood speaking from Authority right we we we in our we we we want to be that in that position we want to you know speak with authority brother you have to know where you're speaking from first right you can't just decide to speak with authority you have to have the authority you have to have and the only way you get that is when you go through boot camp why did the Centurion know that because he was a centurion that's how he knew okay so because he was a centurion he understood speaking with authority now let's fast let's rewind his life to come to that position to come to the place of a centurion what did he have to go what battles did how many times did he have to barely escape with his life from the enemy then the the the hard that he was put through to become a Roman soldier and then work his way through the ranks to now be in that position and that was where he was written of in the book you see we want to just skip to the part where we're written of in the book and we don't want to put in the Blood Sweat and Tears to get to that position amen says oh Lord just take me and use me and he's like he's looking at you and he's and he's saying I'm trying to do just that but you're in the way so you know what he does he doesn't Throw the Clay Away he pounds it to dust and you say oh goodness God do you even love me and he says yes that's why I pounded you to dust it pleased the father to bruise himen why did it please this is just you know there's all these different angles but here's a little food for thought as we close why did it please him to bruise him in bruising him he gave you your healing that's right he was in bruising him he erased your iniquity amen he was bruised for our transgression it pleased the father why because the father knew if I bruise him if I beat him if I put him on the cross then I have access to you amen it pleases God to bruise you to strike you down because why when he does that the only thing that can rise from those ashes is somebody in the spitten image of Jesus Christ to get the last bit of gold last bit of junk out of the gold it's got to be hammered hard hammered down oh when the heat first starts it's kind of cozy and the Lord just slowly turns it up yeah and if we're not careful we let the devil whisper in our ears we stop and we listen and we say yep my life's just harder than somebody else's and really the devil's doing that because he knows you're this close to Victory that's right everything with brother Danny steam he said if the devil was going to kill you he wouldn't have told you about it he would have just did it amen if you weren't a child of God he wouldn't bother telling you you aren't it's a waste of his breath he's a very he's a very particular he's not a Time waster his time is limited we give him too much credit amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord this just rings so true Lord the end of this quote Prophet said he had one thing to do and that was the will of God and he he went moving on Lord help us not to stop not if it's not your will help us to to bypass it to to to not even give it a second thought to not hang out out there Lord and I'm not talking about the bar I'm talking about those vain imaginations that slip in under the guys of Christianity and cloak themselves with the Robes of the preacher cloth themselves in a modest attire in a business suit and we stop and we listen and says what do you have to say but it's just vain imaginations it's not your word it's it's not edifying whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are just think on these things Lord you you brought it down directly in your word but God we strive every day to surrender more to you because we maybe had an episode like this we're not written off we're still your sons but we have to change Lord that has to change we can't just excuse it and say well I'm still a son so no God when you show us it give us the Zeal give us the desire to attack it to to put our effort down there to to annihilate the amorites not to to leave a little baby and leave a little oxen and it's okay it's just a little pride it's just a little no it's the devil help us to scour it out our lives our homes everything Lord to we want to come up to a higher Place Lord Jesus because we love you and you love us and and and what a beautiful relationship what a beautiful world we live in oh the those out there they they think they know what a beautiful world is but they until someone walks in the presence of God With You Lord they'll never know nothing like it and that's what we want Lord but we get distracted we lose our focus and we walk out and and next thing you know we're over there in the corner of the Garden of Eden talking to the devil talking to our flesh and we give in and now you have to come and set us straight Lord one of these days though 1% better every day one of these days will'll have fought the last battle because every day Lord because we are children of God there's a promise in your word that says we shall overcome we shall overcome Saints there's a promise in the word that you shall overcome now that isn't a free pass that is encouragement to say keep pressing on keep pressing on the devil's going to whisper in your ear that's never going to go away temptation is going to come at you that's never going to go away you're going to live with pride the rest of your life but when you don't give in when you don't give in there's a promise in the word says you shall overcome and we take that promise Lord we take that promise maybe we put it on the shelf and we said well I'll use that for when I really feel like a Christian help us to pick it back up Say No by your grace and your grace alone father we shall overcome the battle is the Lord's [Music] oh thank you Jesus I bless your [Music] name love
