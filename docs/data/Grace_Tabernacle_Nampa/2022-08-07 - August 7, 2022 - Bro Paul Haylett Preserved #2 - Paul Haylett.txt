well praise the lord brother chris if you'd come [Music] [Music] amen there's one thing i know god always answers prayer a man might have a disagreement but who is man that's about our heads heavenly father lord jesus lord feeling burdened for my brother the song leader with mike wallace loren welcoming into the the world a child and then directly after facing this situation lord with sister soulless father lord your prophet said this many times that to have empathy to put yourself in in their shoes lordy what he testifies to that blind man in there was mexico being healed wanted to give him his shoes and give him his coat and that connection that empathy father so lord we reach out father lord as a husband as a father lord in empathy lord jesus for our brother and what he's going through lord we know that if our sister would pass on she's been healed we know that if she raises up she's been healed either way god you are god and you are the healer lord jesus the devil will come and say what he wants but it doesn't matter we know the end of the story lord we as your children you as our god have the victory lord jesus i pray you'd come lord bring comfort to our brother bring strength to him lord brother michael or the pastor the church as they would face this i pray you'd bring encouragement and strength lord father and i pray ultimately you would raise her up lord jesus father like david lord david laid on his face crying out for the life of his child until your will was shown god until we see something else we're calling for the life of our sister lord that she would raise up father in healing so that she would stand and testify lord heal her we pray lord jesus father for the other requests for the leon we thank you for the successful surgery lord for keeping him lord but he will continue to bring him recovery lord and healing in his body we pray for our sister sharon and brother yannick their their new child little baby mary and lord the devil will try to come again and take the eyesight lord that's what he always goes for is the eyes lord jesus spiritually speaking father now he's trying to manifest that in the flesh we pray that you would bring healing lord jesus father that the disease would go back lord that they would be a touch from your hand lord jesus father that lord you would have your way that you would heal them lord you would encourage them father they will not be afraid lord we know that a fear is is nothing it's pointless but god faith is a thing we can get a hold of father we claim that faith lord jesus that substance that you would heal or our little brother lord we just commit that into your hands whether burling sister sue brother dan lord of situations commit them all into your hands though jesus that you would just deal with our brother dan lord heal his back lord jesus bring him back into the fold lord and lord we pray for the service this morning that our pastor lord which you've laid upon his heart lord it's not just something to to to tickle us our ears lord but god we want we want that substance that faith revelation spoken father this morning we know that that is his desire lord that is your desire lord now pray you push back the enemy lord jesus and speak to us this morning we love you lord jesus and we're looking forward to that day where we can walk goldhorn in your presence for eternity we thank you father in jesus christ's name we pray amen praise the lord you can be seated for just a minute i have an announcement this morning so i have an announcement but i kind of want to give you a back story um as lord as the lord would have it i had a burning burden for the youth since i was a teenager actually i started even as a young person myself i started a little bit of a youth meeting there at the church growing up when i was about 18 and then uh more uh cons more consecutively right after we got married so the youth have been on my a big burden for me and i've always i've always had a desire to to see god work in young people he worked in me as a young as a young person and because of that there was a difference there was the ability for me to walk away from situations and have the faith and the strength that no matter what my friends did god held me and held me sometimes through ignorance i thank him for that we you we moved to arizona as all of you know in 2017 and um uh brother brother ron had to start with the youth there and brother ron they've been you know he's been a pastor for many years and we learned a lot there i had a lot to learn i didn't really know what i was doing i still don't but uh we're just trusting the lord i think that's the way the lord wants it to be right so we um the lord put the polish on us uh as well as in my ministry and just in general different things we called arizona our times on our back side of the desert experience because it really is the desert there but so at the bottom of everything that i do as a youth leader i want god's will and as you may know i'm a very passionate zealous person and sometimes i get a little excited and i'm not going to apologize for that i'm just letting you know sometimes i have to eat my words but uh i believe that god has given us all energy to do to do his will and what the devil wants to do is take that energy and put it into the wrong things that we want to pray that god focuses our energy into doing what he he has called us to do he's given us a calling and he's getting it he's given us the strength and the energy to do that if you feel weak but you're doing something you're about to do something that god's called you to do don't worry about it he'll give you the strength to do it and this this scripture here in proverbs 2 verse 6 to 12 for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth of sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly he keep with the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his saints then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity yea every good path when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee to deliver thee from the way of the evil man from the man that speaketh forward things but the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth come with knowledge and understanding so we do the best that we have we are called to to do we we we we seek the lord's will and we do things and and when we first came here uh our pastor um asked us to consider helping with the youth and i said well i'll pray about it but you know yes but um there's certain things you know god's called you to do you don't necessarily have to go if i can sound a little bit uh not anyways just certain things you know you don't have to necessarily go go seek the lord and then when you don't know you do but it lines up in god's word right and um so just we have a heart to serve and um no desire to be known as oh they're the youth leaders and like we're some kind of higher than you we we don't desire that at all we just want god to do what he can with the youth and he's put us in in this position and um sometimes we we have to do things for the best intentions of our youth and um we love all of you every single one of you i and the youth i love you guys you could tell me anything and that wouldn't change it and i mean that um so we've been we started out and we've been watching closely the last couple of years and and watching situations and the youth and everything and god's been doing an amazing thing and i take no credit for that but god's been working on and i've seen young people turn corners for the for the good and raise up in in our midst and it's just been amazing and wonderful to see and when we started i had the desire to do youth at starting at the age of 10. and that was my desire and our pastor and his wisdom allowed me to do that wondering at the time if that was a little bit too young um and so dealing with the youth group these past couple of years and watching everything i i have i have come to to the conclusion um through careful prayer and different things that i think 12 is a better age to start the youth group at age 12. so from here from this from this morning onward our youth group would be 12 to 30. i there's a big difference between 10 year old and a 12 year old and i think that we just read the scripture about wisdom god giveth understanding and wisdom he has given us the understanding and the wisdom to make that decision so if you don't like it take it up with him no now if you have any any issues any concerns with anything that has to do with the youth group as the parents you can come to me text me call me whatever it's it's not we can talk about it we can discuss different things so 12 years old the 30 is the new the new age um also and youth meeting will be this friday and grace kids at seven o'clock so i thank you please continue to pray for the youth group god is is is continued to work that god would continue to work that we wouldn't get in the way i wouldn't get in the way and you as parents couldn't get in the way either god bless y'all we want to do that we want to keep praying for our young people and i think it's a wonderful thing that we are god's allowing brother chris to to do for our youth we want to not only pray for our youth but pray for brother chris when he said it we you know we need to pray for wisdom amen especially as our youth are getting older dealing with things that we never had to deal with as young people but are having to deal with now um yeah we definitely want to pray for wisdom amen as we get ready to turn the service to a brother paul let's sing that that song give me the word it's kind of becoming one of my new favorites i like it give me the word make it plain and clear to me give me the word it's the light that i might see give me the words [Music] over every situation give me the words first it's been tested it's been tried searching [Music] still is [Music] it will stand the test forever [Music] give me the word it's my total victory over every situation give me the words i don't want it watered down sugar-coated or profound give me basic truths that lasts the course of reach it time and preach it clear so that the whole world can hear it will change [Music] it's a light that i might [Music] give me the word [Music] make it plain and clear to me give me [Music] over every situation give me the word [Music] situation give me the word amen can we save me until that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] what a pleasant surprise brother joy brother joyce [Laughter] my i'm off to a good start today amen brother lynn sister joyce so happy to see you guys had no idea you were coming into town but we are so happy to see you amen happy to have our sister alice and sister april with us and uh i think seeing how even the couch and the chair and the bed that she would have is in idaho we're going to call sister april and idahoan and so we're happy just to welcome her into this body of believers and so just a beautiful time amen to uh see the lord blessing us and i pray blessing her amen a new new aspect of her life and we just asked the lord's perfect leadership as brother chris said we have wisdom give us leadership lord so i i just um you know something i never would have done as a younger man but i'm getting to the point saints that i just don't care i honestly just don't care if if the devil doesn't like it as the bride moves closer and closer and closer to him you know the devil's not going to say well okay looks like they're committed i'll just give up no he he just turns up the heat he does everything that he can do to stop us trying to get us to be discouraged and to look at the things in our life and to judge by our circumstance amen but we're not here to judge by circumstance right we're here to stand on the word and the word then becomes now i know sometimes it's verbage so we don't want to get caught up in the verbage but you know people will say well the message is my absolute well that's beautiful but the message is jesus christ that's right amen so there is where we truly can anchor or absolute and say you know what this is who we are we were called to be the bride of jesus christ and i thank the lord for what a lovely opportunity to be offered such a lofty position this is not you know a demotion this is not you know a what this is a lofty position and so we're thankful to be a part of that now sister dorcas shared and i'm just part of my boldness here sister dorkness shared with me that little ella grace has been to the eye doctor and the eye doctors have declared what they see and that is that she has some issue with her eye that might or would probably lead to blindness down the road now i'm just here this morning as it were to drive the sign the post and the sign i'm going to hang on it is god's property no trespassing and that's the position that we're going to take this is god's property this is not just we were born in this world and we hope to make it out of here and met hope and hope and this and that no i'm sorry i have scriptural proof now i was just reading you know and brother branham says somebody was questioning him well how do you know brother branham's response to them is it is written so it's there in the word of god declaring our rightful position declaring to us who we are now we don't we're not arrogant we're not presumptuous but quite literally we find ourself in the word of god and so when you find yourself you know it's a very popular thing in this day that we're living in right now this whole ancestry thing and it's quite a joke around our house because if this ancestry dna is correct i'm not that far removed from rosa parks and the bus ride i know i don't look it and i blame her for that stubborn almost rebellious spirit but you realized it wasn't a stubborn spirit she was standing up for her god-given right and so as we stand for our god-given right the devil's going to make all kinds of accusations he's going to bring all kinds of things before you try to throw offenses and stumbling blocks and all of these things but we have to come down to whether minority or not and that's the point why i bring up rosa parks she was absolutely the minority but she was absolutely correct she had as much right to ride that bus as any other individual on that bus and we have as much right this morning to take the word of god we may be in a minority in the religious world but we have every right to take every word of god promised to us as the bride of christ claim it as our own and proclaim it to the world amen and most of all you'll find that you're speaking to the world out here satan has anointed and and we won't go into that maybe another sermon but satan has anointed and you realize my brother and sister at the very birth of christ is when satan's work was made earthly wise manifest herod was anointed find it before it ever gets out but you see god prophesied it god spoke it and said this is what's going to happen and the devil was coming and so when i say that herod was bringing that is because when they come and started to kill the babies that was herod's manifestation of the uprising of satan in that hour against the lord jesus christ now we'll touch on a couple things today the lord will and get going here but ella if you would please just come up here honey brothers brother david brother chris you brothers they've got faith you brothers that have confidence in the word of god we are not going to sit by and let the devil touch our sister this is my sister amen this is a part of my family this is a part of the body of believers called the bride of jesus christ and we are going to go before the throne this morning and you know we're not going to come timidly before the throne we're going to come boldly god you say hi how can you come boldly brother paul because i can pick up my bible and i can read where he said we're already healed by his tribes i'm not hoping that my god is a healer i'm not hoping my god is actually a savior i'm not hoping that he is a provider the word says so amen and so i think it's time saints now don't misunderstand me don't let the devil kind of anoint anything like there's a question mark involved but if we are the bride of christ if we are the very chosen of almighty god let's have esther kind of confidence and when we come in let us not just hope we live through the experience let us come with a boldness that says this is my husband he loves me and he wants the best for me now i'd ask you let's join together we're going to pray for our sister ella grace that we want the lord jesus christ to not only just stop this disease my heart's desire would be go back to the doctor 20 20 vision amen and a doctor saying i don't know what happened i can't explain this i love those statements i can't explain this amen hallelujah not not a well you know there's been some marginal i want the doctor to say i cannot explain this hallelujah let's bow our heads in prayer hallelujah oh heavenly father we come before you lord as we lord hear and read the things that the prophet of god speaks lord we're not going to shake her today we're not going to scream and we're not going to make the threats against the devil lord we are here today lord just simply to look at your word and your word says and lord we are believers your word says that by your stripes my sister ella is healed lord this word is a past tense word this is a word that lord was committed to us father for us to stand on and believe and now lord we bind our faith together with our dear little sister lord asking that your holy spirit just move down through her body and lord as the holy spirit is moving down through her body make everything that satan has tried to deposit go away lord to take every claim that satan has given lord and abolish it father we want to take every situation every damage or whatever might be done lord in the eyes and father we ask you today to turn it back lord for your word said that we were going back to the original seed and lord that original seed was my sister ella perfect lord and so we ask in your precious name now i bind my faith with my little sister lord jesus i ask you to stimulate her faith lord to believe and to claim that she's healed in the name of jesus christ and this body of believers will stand here today and we will testify our little sister is already healed in the name of jesus christ now we ask the power of the word in the presence of your holy spirit would be with her leader guider father let her not speak negative lord her eyes are good her eyes are healthy her eyes lord are according to thy word and lord we just claim this proclaim this in the name of jesus christ and i ask my little sister ella to go forth find the courage to declare i'm healed in the name of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can we just give the lord a handclap of praise hallelujah even as we were singing a song service today i thought yes yes praise the lord but i wasn't thinking about sister ella i actually at that moment had slightly selfish thoughts the affliction of my own flesh what will i claim what will i declare what will i speak out will i sit back and say well god's going to heal you and doubt that he would heal me no my brother and sister we have to stand up take the whole word of god amen and then in standing upon that promise of god we can bind our faith together without one doubt without one fear as i spoke to you i believe that was wednesday night see we're not here to trade uh uh some kind of uh other hindrance in our life well you know i have fears okay i have fears that but the lord delivered me from fear but i still have doubt you see the fear and the doubt will walk hand in hand together and limit what you can claim and limit the confidence by which you will step forward into the word of god now the word of god my brother and sister the prophet teaches us that the word of god is released by a what full surrender so we can have all the word all the message but if we have doubts and fears if we have impediments as it were that satan has put in there and we say but praise the lord i've got the message my brother and sister the message will never be effective without the elimination of the doubts and the fears and it goes much deeper bitterness and all these kind of things that are the things that satan uses to hinder us amen god bless you amen at least i didn't have you standing amen let's stand and i i have such a lengthy scripture to start with that we'll just read a portion of that i want to speak to you once again our position of strength my brother and sister is in the fact that god has preserved us and we'll touch on that in just a minute to to look how god's preserving power now some people would say but brother paul i i have and i think all of us could raise a hand i have times i feel very weak i have times that i have uh have fallen i've made mistakes and and i just feel you know so unworthy yes but why didn't you quit see the stumbling blocks that are there the mud holes as it were and the briars but why didn't you quit because there's a preserving power and i want to just not a boasting approach but i want you to realize that in these times that you say i i just something overcome me i kind of lost it i did this i did that and brother david going back referencing last sunday you know you start in a path and realize you come face to face with the devil you don't just say well i guess i went down this road i'll just serve the devil no sir what do we do we turn around we run back to the throne and we kneel before the cross and we say lord forgive me see that's the thing there won't be one that will never come face to face with the devil but it's what we do when we came face to face with him that makes the difference and when we can't fall we can't quit you realize there's something greater than you the preserving power of the word amen christ is his word right amen so we look at that so i just want to speak to you a little bit of a continuation of time here i know sometimes there's a gap in there and and do that but i i tried by god's grace to bring this as a standalone thought in continuity with these other thoughts amen so let's just go right here psalms 145 starting with the first verse and i i just felt so blessed as i read this scripture and it did scripturally fit into my overall thought uh but it it originally i was like well i will i will not include that but then i found myself attracted to go back and read it again and again and again because of the effect you know do you like endorphins you know you realize humans now let's just go into a you might say the humanistic or carnal side of us for a moment do you like endorphins yes almost nothing better than that first spoonful of you know what i'm going to say ice cream the endorphins go wild and that's how if you've got nothing better to do you eat the whole carton because while you're searching for the same effect you got with that first spoonful that's how god made us but i want you to see real quick before we go into this scripture how that god coming down when he made you a new creature in christ that he couldn't take and rewrite you now just bear with me as i bring this out he didn't rewrite you we say we're a new creature in christ but do you realize he took the very nature he didn't wipe your hard drive and say i'm going to give you an entirely different personality i'm going to give you entirely different intelligence and entirely different taste in food and blah blah blah right so what did he do he took all things subject in the flesh and committed him them to him he took that now we had a good laugh last night and i'm not going to bring that up but sometimes our old flash just pops up out of nowhere and we have to slap it down but you know what my brother and sister we are not zombies and god said in spite of who could i pick i don't want to point at me this morning that would be just too rough but he took this nature he says satan i'll prove to you the power of the word i'll prove to you the power of my spirit because i'm going to take these old badger skins god bless you badger saints this morning amen i say badger saints because you see that old badger has come subject to the word that old badger rares his head up every once in a while amen i'll just tell you a quick little funny story a farmer friend you know he was telling me said i had a scare this morning and i was oh what's that and he said well i was out irrigating and there was a badger in my hayfield and i bailed out the pickup without thinking and i grabbed a shovel and i ran over there and i started beating on that badger and he said about the time the shovel handle broke i realized that badger is a lot tougher than me and he said he almost beat me back to the pickup come on that's why we got to take that one quick step from lord let my flesh become subject to you because you start running away from it the devil can run faster than you can but we can get under the blood amen and we know what the prophet said the devil comes under the blood you'll get to call him brother so he won't come under the blood david psalm of praise i will extol thee my god o king and i will bless thy name forever and ever sounds like a son or daughter of god right every day will i bless thee and i will praise thy name forever and ever still sounds like sons and daughters of god great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable one generation shall praise thy works to another and should declare thy mighty acts lord we ask you to bless the word this morning lord just help us be precise and concise lord let it come down register in our hearts lord to realize the kind of god we serve lord how mighty you are how beautiful oh how loving and kind thy grace is unmeasurable thy wisdom and knowledge as the scripture says is unsearchable so great we thank you this morning ask you to make this real to us lord today in your precious name amen hallelujah you may be seated saints i save this moment right now to say a beautiful and hearty welcome to my lovely daughter jolin and my lovely granddaughter aaliyah that they have come home they say you know just cast it on the waters and if they love you they'll come back so i'm really happy they came back today so or last night in the middle of the night amen so i want to go on if you would just continue these scriptures i'm glad in verse 4 that it is there that this promise of the word as one generation shall praise thy works to another now look my brother and sister as we stand here today we have various ages and not to make any point of it but to those that would be the oldest here today down to the youngest and somehow this word must go from generation to generation this word you say well you know if they're seed of god that the word will find them but my brother and sister god said you know what i'm going to do i'm going to ordain moms and dads and ministers and aunts and uncles and friends and whatever else to be anointed to come and feel compelled to share the beauty of the gospel of jesus christ to be able to come and not let our our testimonies as it were of healings and deliverances you say well sometimes these things are personal well my brother and sister if we're all under the blood and i want to say lord let us all be under the blood we will not judge one for their history but we'll look at what god is doing in a present tense and we'll say look at this god has delivered my brother has delivered my sister has delivered this teenager has delivered this person from this situation and i'm here to testify of it i'm here not to boast of anything i've ever done but i'm telling you saints as a teenager not serving god to be in a pickup that's hanging on the edge of a cliff and realizing it's one little rock about this big that kept a whole pickup from sliding off into the abyss and the only thing i remember from that moment thank you lord thank you lord because i wasn't serving him if we had fallen in that canyon i would have stood before a god in judgment because at that stage of my life i had rejected oh you say you spoke an incident no i did not but i refused to do it i had rejected that but god rich in mercy can someone say amen god rich in mercy said your time is not yet i have a purpose for your life i have a way a path i have a place for you to go and i have people for you to witness to oh it might be your own child your own grandchild it might be one in your family one in this body of believers but god said i'm gonna give you a voice to tell of my majesty to tell of my power to tell of my love and of my grace amen someone's got to do it and i thank the lord for that you know reading here recently a critic and i don't know i feel compelled to share this but i am a critic saying william branham boasted of himself you know when i read it when i hear it you know what my thoughts are thank you lord because i would feel completely lost without an understanding of these things and how that god could come and love me so much love me so much and when the prophet of god lied oh you know the die hards will tell you well shall i call them diehards what should i call them the fanatics the what i don't say this demeaning but they're going to say how dare you say in public brother branham lied well brother branham put it right on tape and said the lord checked me and basically told me i'm just paraphrasing this not going to answer your prayer i'm not going to give you any discernment for these things until you make that right and you know what that did for me i didn't look at william branham and say whoa this guy lied i can't follow him i looked at that when he shares that and said there's hope for me there's hope for me because i have lied oh and the worst kind of lie my brother and sister they say is the one that's almost entirely truth the gray one yeah the gray one i don't know i felt compelled to share that but let us be a generation that shares the works of god let us be a generation that we declare his mighty acts that have taken place in this hour let us never be silenced by the critics that want to muzzle us because we're ever increasingly becoming the minority in fact do you realize i won't go into it in some areas in a country they're talking about making the message a hate crime because after all in the day that we live in you know what i mean mainstream sodom we're not allowed we're not allowed to make anyone feel less in fact if you notice that satan is so good he's empowered the voice all that voice did is set them up for judgment and satan sitting back if you don't mind that's beautiful they're going to be judged and i never even got in the picture as far as they know i just stayed behind it and i got them to come face to face with god's word and for them to say you're judging me first corinthians 11 is pretty clear on that we judge ourself but you see they refuse to judge themselves so then they're offended if they are judged mine let me get going here and the men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts and i will declare thy greatness now look at the difference my brother and sister right there in that verse some will speak because they view the things that god has done as terrible but we the bride of christ is there any eyes here this morning i will declare thy greatness i don't see these as terrible acts i see this as god moving me oh i'm not talking about what he did to the philistines the amalekites and this and that my brother and sister i'm talking about people bringing it back home in their own life and angry god because god did this and god did this and this has happened and this would be this way and when i go to church they talk about my sin i don't want to hear about my sin i want to hear about how great my god is i want a god that loves everybody no matter their condition well i've got him right here i've got him right here but my god is a god that changes my circumstance he doesn't sugarcoat my circumstance he doesn't make it look special he doesn't convince me that just because it doesn't apply to me no i'm sorry his word applies amen yes and they shall abundantly utter the memory of that great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness the lord is gracious can we say amen and full of compassion and slow to anger i'm happy about that one and of great mercy the lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works you realize even in moments of judgment we're preaching sometimes and and we're like ouch you know that was god's tender mercy when he took a chunk of height off of you that was his tender mercy that was him saying look you're my daughter you're my son and i know how to get you back where you belong hallelujah all thy work shall praise thee o lord thy saints shall bless thee they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power now let me just throw this right in here right now interacting with a brother from the continent of africa i'll just that's as close as i'll get sharing saints testimony of things that's happening amongst the young people in africa and i'm just going to blast this out because it we need to hear these things young people youth meetings the minister speaking them felt led to put this out i think i've spoke a little bit of this or at least spoke it to some people youth minister putting out a questionnaire anonymous to the young people and the young people by and large responded with what appears to be honesty over 90 percent caught up in some form of pornography over 70 percent i believe it was of young sisters caught up in the same music staggering number they know they shouldn't listen to that music but they listen to it this is not a denominational church they're polling oh these terrible children no sir no sir in many cases this is the older generation which unfortunately includes the majority of ministry has not recognized satan's onslaught against our young people we want status quo you come to church we preach at you you go home and live what we told you without realizing the influence of the world that we live in out here is so strong and our young people are so connected now look when i was a kid no one had a clue what was happening in south america in africa in asia in europe no one had a clue all we heard was the russians are bad we heard that a lot in school it's like when the russians attack us you take your desk and you shove it over here in the doorway and you crawl under it wait doesn't atomic bombs just vaporize things if that's the case why don't we just keep having class or instead let's just declare recess but look at the world now this brother shared with me he did a little he did a little research as it were it's called shoulder to shoulder research you know the kind that you get when you come maybe sit down shoulder to shoulder you come how you doing brother shoulder to shoulder research oh don't be afraid of the pastor don't be afraid of the preacher i'm on a research mission all the time yeah all the time saints i'm just being honest with you don't don't get nervous about it i'm on a research all the time the brother told me he said i just sidle over to where the young people the teenagers and early 20s are all out and he said they're not talking about the word they're talking about this new app and this new program and this knew this and this knew that and this deal that will do this and do that and how and he says you don't hear them and of course then he just blasted the young people of being terrible young people no let me tell you what he blasted he says our ministry has lost touch with our children come on but there's got to be a generation that's going to stand up why because the word said that if you'll train the child in the way he should go it didn't say there's no bumps no potholes no troubles along the way but in the end they will come back and stand on the foundation that they were taught oh parents let's get out of our distractions let's get out of all of our things we're so busy about and let's make sure our children are anchored in christ let it come to a place that we realize they are struggling and i'm going to get down we're not talking to a god way up in the ether my brother and sister we're talking to a god that will get down in the trench with us oh i want to serve a god like that amen i've been down in that trench and i've slogged through the mud and i've set in services where the preacher said if you're struggling with this or struggling with that then you must doubt who you are in christ no i believed i was a son of god man i looked around and i was still in the trench even though i believed i was a son of god lord help us i'll just throw this in don't feel sorry for me but as a child i backslid and my parents dealt with a certain family of certain individuals that literally looked my parents in the face and said you know i guess your son is not one of them because he's left us that's a real encouraging feeling yeah your parents must feel really good my son's backslid now these people are telling us there's no hope for him well i'm here to tell you quite the opposite i've got a god that declared in his word that he would preserve his seed he would hold his seed through the darkest of the night and through the mud of egypt and all of the things that we must face i serve a god that says i call them i will deliver them i can empower them and i will turn their life around in a heartbeat and he doesn't say just count on me just wait it out saints no don't worry about your children just let them do what they're gonna do they'll come back someday i'm not gonna sit there i have drove the post and i have posted the sign this is god's property no trespassing amen my god said i will preserve my seed i believe that word but my god also said i have raised up men who will stand for me who will defend me who will present me in the best possible life not just helter skelter not just as it were oh it looks like they're kind of doing wrong but they're preachers so they'll be all right whatever this no my brother and sister it said we ought to hide from the very presence the very image the very outline of sin oh god help us i say god help us saints amen amen to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom that kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations i'm telling you we look at the word the word says there's a chosen generation do we believe we're part of that amen now if we believe we're a part of that my brother and sister we must also believe that everyone of whatever ages has that same promise as we do you know there's a divining i don't know why i'm sharing this but it won't hurt us there's a dividing in the message i call it old school and i call it new ideas and people will say whoa no there's no new ideas yeah there is new ideas the new idea my brother and sister is as paul spoke i will be i can be i will be i should be all things to all people if i have to get down at a child's level then lord let me be humble enough to get down at the child's level if we're dealing with a brother who's more intellectual then lord please anoint me because that's going to be way beyond my position but let me be able to speak this gospel in such a fashion that intellectual brother can look at that and say amen that's nothing but the truth you see we have to come because when we get so solid locked into this is what's always worked we will lose a generation and let me put this i don't know why we're going this way this morning but i'll tell you in my generation in the message you will find there's not very many fit right in that generational gap because at that time they had a theory now some of you parents would agree with this theory or should be probably but anyway um you know just beat him into submission just beat them into submission give them the word test and if they won't receive it then they're serpent seed come on this is not a joke this is real i live through this in a church that had 50. my there's only like i don't know i'm not counting but there's like 60 or 65 of us maybe here and we had 50 young people and about 45 or 6 of those are gone there i believe some of them will come back i really do but you see that word test this is what you'll do and if you're not you're serpentine were they offended were those young people offended yes but no you know what they mostly were believers they believed what was preached to them they were preached that they were lost they were preached that there was no holding power for them they were preached that god's not interested in you and they believed i tell you what i want to do i want to preach to a group of people and i am i believe this morning that say i believe the word i don't believe a man's idea i don't believe this teaching over here i don't believe a theory i believe in the word of god it is real it is powerful and it's capable hallelujah it's capable to come and preserve the seed of sons and daughters of god amen amen the kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations now this verse 14 that's why i had to come this far the lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down hallelujah i'm glad my god oh my my oh my now as well look at this my brother and sister we still got a couple more verses to go here and i knew this would be about half a sermon so i've got four or five escape spots through the through the to the service here the eyes of all wait upon thee and now give us them their meat and due season did you catch that did you catch that you said brother paul you're the pastor you must be very spiritual no there's people in this church much more spiritual than i am but one thing i know is when the season comes from me god's going to give it to me if there's something i don't understand of the word i don't have to go i got to compare myself to this brother that brother that brother i in due season god said i'll give you the meat you need and that meat will be sufficient and so it's there my brother and sister god brings his dear children along and he knows how to keep us all in our correct you might say position and i'm not talking about you or this and you or that and you're under them i'm talking about the fact that in the word and revelation what happens is i heard a brother put it this way the minute we try to teach revelation we have muddied the water where one does not know whether he has revelation or not you don't teach revelation you preach the word god gives revelation and i desire revelation for each one of you and for myself but we have to just simply preach the word and let god do the work amen because we can start mapping out god right this one of the things the prophet of god now forgive me if you say i don't know where brother brown said that because you see sometimes i what uh he said i and i heard are the same but different and that would make some of you just tremendously nervous that brother paul would admit that what he heard and what he thought was different but you see god allows us as it were to come to a marker and as it would be going like through a strong concordance and this tied to this this tied to this this tied to this this tied to this and you make those references and sometimes some of us were coming along and bam and people say how did you get that out of that well it's there it's there it's just not by conventional wisdom that we find it but you look at this and see what god is doing god is bringing us to a place my brother and sister by individual revelation it becomes so anchored in our life the devil can't take it away what happens now i don't like to be negative and i've tried to remove this from my conversation so i didn't cause anybody to to stumble over this but my brother and sister collective revelation means that when your pastor fails the church fails with him that's collective revelation individual revelation says when the pastor fails we the church will rise up and claim him we will stand together and if he won't repent we'll still press on to the mark of the high calling that's what individual revelation does collective revelation tries to tie the whole church together if we all win we win together if we fail we all fail together sorry that's not this gospel amen this gospel is a powerful gospel amen that's come on the individual basis and it's good for us amen meet and do season thou openest thy hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing the lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works that's why i get confused saints i don't know i'm off on a little different trail this morning i don't know anyway it's good the lord told me to do this get your bible out i can't find that anywhere the lord told me i'll bring it down to a subject that makes most of us nervous the lord told me to marry that girl nine years later the lord told me divorce her find that in the word i'll tell you where we can find it we can find it in the devil's bible we can find it in the devil's literature see what they've done is they've actually made a mockery of god because see he said here in verse 17 the lord is righteous in all of his ways and it would be unrighteous for god to tell you to do something that's against his word so god's never going as a prophet of god said god will never lead you away from his word but people utterly convinced stand on this and say the lord told me to do this good good i don't know what lord you're talking about was it a large capital l a little l uh was it just light you know people fall for all these things that the devil presents i mean if you don't think so my brother and sister just go back and look through the scripture look through the scripture aren't we all one aren't we all one just come worship with us you'll like our kind of worship no commitment we get to change whatever we want to change when we want to change it and and we can take and go back and say a prophet said it okay cool i believe you inherently paul's the kind of guy that's a tad bit naive just ask sister jerry paul's a tad bit naive i mean they call me up sir we want to we want to fix your bad credit and get rid of all your old debts just give us your credit card number and so scared him i believe him problem is i don't have any bad debts and my credit card's paid off every month so follow me here they passed the word test i mean they didn't pass the word test because they said so poor analogy wasn't that but the lord told me stop or in the day and age we live in zero quotes maybe i didn't get it right zero quotes oh i can word it another way you know when we first got the ego computing program oh i don't know why i'm going here i don't mean to be old home weak here we first got eagle computing program a lot of quotes we had been raised on sister jerry and i first got that program and it's like they said this type it in there nothing type this in here nothing type this in here nothing type this in here nothing and they are still saying the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said stop right there nothing come on don't let technology of saints take you away from the word let technology help you dig deeper into the word god gave it in this hour that we could dig so deep that no matter what the devil tried to do god said i'm going to make my word so available and we can say well this technology's bad technology is bad no the devil that introduced technology is the one that's the problem but we can use this for our benefit amen so you see the the lord is righteous in all his ways so he won't change his mind and he won't pervert his own word and holy in his works the lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in a caveat you want god to give revelation to you come to him in truth seek truth above all else because just coming to him is not enough yeah i'm remembering conversation brother trevor you and i just had recently powerful words powerful words coming from people that have no alignment with the word of god at all and you have to say what they said is truth they quote scripture they quote these things it's truth said that satan would come as an angel of light you know what i read i i i read way too much it's almost turning into a bad habit people are like oh yeah oh yeah that that light over the shoulder of william branham that's that that's that scripture that's that uh you know that light utter nonsense that light my brother and sisters people that are declaring i'm enlightened in the word of god and the whole world's not going to see a light my brother and sister whole world's not going to have light here light here like here coming to deceive them it's the light that they proclaim that they're walking in that they're declaring to the people that deceives the people and they hold to that because it was preached to them as truth i'm going to have a whole sermon right out of psalms here we'll have to have another part or something some other day or something amen he will fulfill the desire of them that fear him now i want to just bring this out to you saints anybody got a desire on your heart some things that are just very serious and dear to your hearts things that you you need you want you desire the lord to come and answer that i want you to take this scripture right here and i want you to hold on to this and if you need to highlight it record it come back and read it again and again and again listen to it whatever he will fulfill is no might or could be or something he said he will fulfill the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry and will save them now look at this here is the little qualifier quantifier that it puts on them my brother and sister all them that fear him and the lord says you know the fear of the lord the fear of the lord not just oh yeah i fear the lord and we'll tie this together and i won't make the cross reference for time here but it comes down to those that love him do what obey his word if you love me if you love me you know god's still answering that question he spoke it to peter peter do you love me yes i love you peter do you love me yeah you realize he's never quit asking that question do you love me and i'm telling you the world is saying we love you but you don't see much sacrifice on their part their idea is their idea but i say lord let your will be my will and my will your will that we can stand in the perfect will of almighty god and then we can come and have a desire and god would come and answer that because we've just completely given up oh but people say no no no that's not we can't just completely give up yes we can yes we can we can just throw ourselves on the altar and say lord i am yours and whatever you want to do with me lord i am just here you know how hard that is saint come on somebody just admit how hard that is it is killer hard it is killer heart because we say lord i want to submit to you in a few minutes we get up and take our own will with us come on as though we feel like we're cluttering the altar by leaving our self on the altar i got to clean up behind me my mama made me clean my room you know and i was taught in church you this and you do that no my brother and sister it's a time we come to a season that we realize god's here not to do away with you he's here to preserve you and in the preservation he brings us to a place those things that are detrimental we let god take those come on hallelujah the lord preserveth all them that love him but the wicked will he destroy my mouth will speak to the the praise of the lord and let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever oh my oh my what happened where time go it's a beautiful scripture my brother and sister and i believe it describes our lord and savior now look i want to come and just touch for another minute or two here out of the book of jude jude the first chapter verses one through three jew the servant of jesus christ the brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in other words my brother and sister these people the thems of this scripture god come along and he poured a little preservative in them isn't that good but this is back to the original seed this is not sodium benzene and i don't know all these other names that i couldn't tell you god doesn't have to resort to something artificial are you with me he doesn't have to resort to something artificial to preserve the bride of christ he doesn't have to have a big beautifully gowned choir and people with exceeding talents and and only display the very best and do all this no god don't need that my brother and sister god's got a different kind of preservative that he's pouring into the bride is called the holy ghost amen and that's why when we get into the holy ghost my brother and sister it gets into us to put it correctly when it gets into us we're preserved and in that satan might buff it you know i've heard people misquote the scripture a couple times you know and that well anybody who's been tossed about they are double-minded i'd like somebody lift a hand and tell me today you haven't been tossed come on jude the servant of jesus christ brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ no other place not church not a movement but i love this all of that preserved but then he brings this last portion and says wait whoa whoa just second let me quantify this you have to be called well praise god we've been members of the first free methodist church for six generations so what so what if you're not called none of that matters mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should go to church some people won't like me saying this but i'll say it anyway read your bible and pray every day still not the answer ingredient but not the answer right that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints and my brother and sister these saints are not just the people who said we're christians and walked up and down the streets of jerusalem and bethlehem and uh you know all these places and my brother said no it's it's talk is cheap i'll just put it that simple sorry i sometimes revert back to this but talk is cheap we're christian we're christian we're christian we're christian but if the life doesn't align with the word your talk is not worth the heir it took to expel it no because you see my brother and sister to earnestly contend amen now look at this i want to go back now and to to tie in here just a little bit the definition of preserve to keep something in its original state or in good condition to keep something safe from harm or lost to prevent from decaying now you'd think i would focus on the first two parts of that but my brother and sister i actually want to focus on the third part of that definition because i want you to look around the world today and all of the holiness movement is doing what decaying they are giving up standards as it were that they said was tenets of faith they're giving them up right and left and they are not even ashamed of it but let's apply this not to them because we're not them and we are not going to be them we're going to stand on something more solid amen what did god do he come right down here saints and he said what i'm going to do is keep you in original condition i'm going to take an original word and bring it back to an original bride that's going to put a bride back in her original condition not a laodicean condition not a condition of the day the fashion and whatever else but an original condition the condition before the foundation of the world this word is going to take her right back to that and the devil's here telling you you're not measuring up you're not measuring up but god said i poured the preservative in you and the devil can't take it out and you are going to make it through amen you're going to rise up and you're going to stand before him and god himself says you're righteous and you are holy and you are mine oh hallelujah yes amen you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered now some people would look at that once delivered as something long ago that no longer is applicable that religion culture all this has changed but i can't find anywhere in the word as the prophet of god spoke to them people when they said oh you're just caught up in an apostolic thing brother branham says i can show you where god put it into the word can you show me where god took it out amen hallelujah earnestly contend for the faith you know the word earnestly my brother and sister is seriously come on come on now if none of you had ever done this i would feel bad to preach this but you know what some of us have come to the church oh ah come on let's be fair all of us have come to church and we weren't in earnest we felt obligated to come to church now i'm excusing all things like migraines and stomach aches and the flu and covet symptoms and whatever else that might have hindrance in your life and you have a hard time struggling to focus and etc okay i'm not trying to be legalistic about this okay that'll be the way to put it i'm not trying to be legalistic but you see many of us have come you know i hate to say this but during the faithful going to church i was struggling very severely but knowing god calling me closer and closer every day you guys would be shocked how many farming problems i fixed in church i fixed tractors and i fixed this i remembered that is that earnestly no it's not that's half-heartedly that's uncommitted okay i just want to drive that home as we move on now contend interesting word here is to compete amen so earnestly compete i think that fits my brother and sister we should earnestly compete for the faith but i'm not competing against you have you ever noticed okay everybody buckle your seatbelt you ever notice when you carp on each other oh you guys are looking at me like what are you talking about you know what the word carp means on the street you're down in them you're dousing them you're digging them now you understand me sorry i reverted back just a little bit there have you ever noticed when you we do that come on you know what i'm talking about saints when we're digging at that is never at the moment you're earnestly contending when we are contending for the faith i see your faults and you see my faults and our first impulse lord i take this brother i take this sister before you lord come and move lord light the fire in them lord get them out of their doldrum lord bring them up into a place that they're not lukewarm they're not cold lord get them on fire but when we ourselves are down at that level the pastor this and this person that and they did this and this family did that my brother and sister let that be a thermometer that you use when you find yourself carping on people then just stop and say lord where's my temperature at because you'll find when your temperature is hot all you care about is god coming on the scene and helping them god coming on the scene and moving them but it's when we ourselves are cooling off oh some of you look at me um well look i'm going to tell you i can preach that because i have lived that and i lived it to a point to recognize that it can take you so low that you come to church and all you see that's right hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite hypocrites here and hypocrites there hypocrites are everywhere i'm one and you are too yeah that's right but when we're on fire when we are earnestly contending and our head is down in prayer and we're pushing to the mark of the high calling my brother and sister you know i played a little bit of sports a little bit of football when i was just a kid not much mostly they just used me for some kind of blocking dummy and they had a lot of emphasis on the dummy part and but you look at that but i had a coach in little league football that he was like hey let put your head down you can't push looking around joe get your head down come on saints get your head down i see your fault i see your fault i see you from you can't press to the mark of the high calling with your head up get it down saints and i'm preaching to myself this morning get it down amen because there is the place that god wants us to come oh you know what we don't want to be i tried it once kind of person i tried having a prayer life and it just didn't work for me well i'm telling you got bigger problems amen now look we're now presently this is not past tense saints this is now presently uh called to press to the heart mark of the high calling to contend for the faith amen not to be arrogant you know my brother and sister there's those i'll just i hope this doesn't uh i hope none of you feel like i'm talking to you right now but there's going to be those that will never contend for the faith they are those that have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof they're the ones and we'll touch the scripture in a second that stand in the door won't go through themselves but won't let anybody else go through no we all know this message i've heard the critics say this i've had contact with people not that far in the past that say these things don't you know brother paul no one no one brother paul can live this message and i know they expected me to say oh yes we can but i said i absolutely agree with you and they're like what yes i can't live it but the christ in me has poured in the preservative and he himself is holding me up and i'm walking with him and you walk like a drunk man no i'm walking where he leads me but you see they never caught that revelation what it was to truly earnestly contend and they are there looking in their own flesh and they are a certain because they're living in their own flesh brother trevor that you must be living in your own flesh too but they don't realize that we are pressing pressing and it's not us but it's god in us pressing us and we are contending and i tell you it becomes something i tell you what you do sorry to bring it this way but you take a little kid you take a little kid and whatever it might be give him a tennis racket and he hits the ball over the net now if he never gets the ball over the net the kid's interest in tennis just dies but what if he's the one that hits it and it goes over the net that was cool give him another ball he hits it after 10 12 time you know it doesn't go over the net he doesn't care because he knows he can get the ball over the net amen fishermen we have a tried and true absolute fisherman here you know what it's like to sit in a boat all day not catch a fish you know it's like paul's one or two attempts at fly fishing oh you brothers that are critics of me about that i'm telling you i tried i tried but when all you can do is dig your little fly off the tree branches above you all day long or sit there for what turns out to be hours as you're trying to let's see that line went here and it went there oh i've caught something teach a kid to ride a bicycle no son of mine's gonna have a training wheel i don't need to ride a bike sons and daughters of god in the house of god you're a bunch of worthless nothings you're nothing you can be lost if you don't line up if you don't line up you're going to be lost after a while they decide being lost isn't quite as bad as they thought it was because they've never been showed that they can win they've never been shown i'm a contender come on i want it to be our young people have a revelation our old people have a revelation i'm a contender i'm not just in a house been in a race but i am a contender and i was called to finish this race i will finish this race and then god comes have you ever oh can i just have a few more minutes have you ever been in a spot in your life you prayed for something and you don't really feel like an overcomer you don't feel like a real winner you don't feel like a bundle of faith but you pray for something and it's personal to you nobody even knows there's been no prayer request there's been nothing and god comes on the scene and answers that prayer can anyone say amen to that it's happened to me i hope it's happened to you you know what god was doing he said well i don't know if my faith was sufficient god didn't really care about your faith my brother and sister because he is faith you wonder what faith is it's christ amen don't put it off as some other ingredient like the third person of the trinity or some other ingredient faith is christ without him there is no faith and with him all things are possible because he builds and brings that faith up that gives you the encouragement to take a hold of the word and so you pray a prayer and you don't feel spiritual god answers that prayer you know what he's doing he's showing you you can hit the ball over the net he's showing that you can do this and he gives you another opportunity and he gives you another opportunity until we come to the place that we should be where it's not even a second guess my baby's sick lay my hands i'm a daughter of god lord you said my baby's already healed and you said lord that you would give to these things that are here of the desire of our hearts and i desire my child's healing i'm telling you if we could correlate and put together as a form of data across the nations my brother and sister you would find that that is happening day by day it's not a rarity it is commonplace as it were that god is coming at the prayer of his saints and answering their prayers and you say but he's not doing it for me well maybe you need to change something instead of doubting the word instead of saying well you know maybe this doesn't work maybe you should stop and say it's working why is it maybe oh can i be just this straightforward maybe you're not contending maybe you're drifting maybe you're fl going with a flow not a contender you've gave up already hope that's not too too hard is it but those that are not pressing the battle i just declare to you today not arrogantly but if you're not going to press the battle don't stand in our way come on if you're going to come to church with a bad attitude a bitter attitude a evil spirit on you maybe you should skip that wednesday night or sunday morning if you're going to come with that on you because you don't need to hinder us we're going to contend is there any contenders here this morning amen we're going to contend so don't bring some alternate idea of this person said that preachers this and that my brother and sister that's just the devil let's call it what it is you say but they're nice people i'm sorry those spirits are not of god they're of the devil and all they're designed oh you say but well it looks like it might be true why don't you pray for them that they'll be delivered instead of bringing the attitude that they're the problem the devil is the problem but you see people won't submit to the word do i say it lord or do i not just reading this morning prophet of god said that christ and his church are one and the word are one amen and he said for because he's talking about the church i want you to get this in context if the woman says my husband and i are not one brother branham said that's an antichrist spirit amen you see what the devil's trying to do he's trying to bring us where we're not one with the word that's his whole goal when we don't have one with one another as it were and we don't have one with the word then we'll find ourself under the anointing of an antichrist spirit and that antichrist spirit the prophet goes on to say it won't be subject to anything oh our wives are so suppressed our wives are beaten down free of slaves on earth i won't go there some some of you i can tell i'm feeling a little pushback yeah yeah i'm suppressed i mean lunch and the amazon truck drives up somebody's suppressed around here come home from work there's ups somebody's suppressed around here come on i'm not picking on sister jerry but you catch the point you guys catch the point i'm talking about we talk about oh we're suppressed and those under that anointing out there are saying all those people believing the message believing that are so suppressed well i'll tell you how suppressed i am i pray god answers prayers amen you might oh forgive me for putting it this way it might be as it would be typed it might be the amazon package on the porch i pray god delivers i'm suppressed such nonsense why these spirits want you to be liberated to go celebrate satan's eden go satan's eden and god of this evil age yeah and be good for a church go listen to both of those you'll see this spirit that is creeping in and moving where it's like oh you guys are so suppressed you're so suppressed no i'll tell you what my brother and sister i'm not suppressed i'm preserved amen i would have fallen apart and been gone years ago the god has come rich in mercy and has preserved me then i can stand oh do you see a little flesh out of me yeah you see a little flesh out of me you come around my house yeah you'll see a little flesh i hate to admit it but i'm not going to hide it from you you'll see a little flesh but i'm telling you then god will come and he will stir my heart and i will go from my humanistic side and i will say oh praise god i'm a son of god i'm not some poor down trodden beaten person on the face of the earth with no hope i'm a son of god and that preservation power of the holy spirit rises up and you know it will only rise as high as i feed it if i turn around and start boo-hooing god's a gentleman he'll just let it rise to a point where you say oh praise god i'm saved i'm not saved no i'm not saved what brother paul no i'm beyond saved he didn't just come and say oh sister jerry's over here i shouldn't do this to anybody i like you remember when god told you he liked you the first time come on don't let the devil take that memory from you well it says i like you then god says i want to be around you a little more pretty soon god says how i want to court you come on are you with me and then one day he says you know i i'd like to for you to be my wife okay i'll be your wife okay i'll let you know when i want to get married catch you later oh you can't go date anybody else now you can't court nobody else you can't do nothing else cause you done told me you'd be my wife but he says no i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll walk with you every step every moment of your life i'll be right there with you hey wait don't let your minds go carnal but he says i'll even be in you why because the heart has exchanged no there's a lot of people love a lot of people in the natural it's deeper than that it's christ we talk about him oh the holy spirit the holy spirit that's good my brother and sister but you realize he's also your faith you have nothing without him you have no ability to believe you have no ability to confess you have no ability to walk without him hallelujah oh sister emmy come my i get so excited about pressing on to this look at this now matthew matthew 23 and 13 oh anyway matthew 23 13 says but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that that are entering to go in so we'll see my brother and sister that's all right we're good brothers that's all right see so you see what it is my brother and sister when we come to church i just felt led to come back and touch this we come to church and we bring spirits and we bring attitudes and we bring opinions and we bring all of this stuff in the house of god you know you know where we're supposed to leave that on an altar and you don't have to come to church to find that altar it's supposed to be in your heart so you know what it is i i just i don't know why i feel compelled to touch this but when we come in with that attitude we're not just ourselves well i had a bad day i had a bad day so you're going to make my bad day or their bad day or their bad day because that spirit that came in is having an but god said i'll preserve you you're not losing anything to admit you're weak not losing anything to admit that you have failed you're not losing anything to come and say lord i desperately need you lord i don't care what brother it is it's preaching on that night or that day i want you lord i got a quote to back this up those are you need quotes to back things up i got a quote to back this up my brother and sister you see coming in there the prophet of god says you're not looking to the man you're not looking to the minister you're not looking to the church you're looking to christ let that be what drives our lives amen oh hallelujah oh hallelujah you know i'll just save the rest of this you see the prophet brings out and you guys can maybe go study it out if you want and i ask the brothers not to steal a thought from me but they won't they're gentlemen look at this now my brother and sister in closing a lot of things are preserved around church traditions [Music] preserved [Music] i think it's kind of neat i say this positively no one misunderstood me please we have different cultures [Music] i just ate would that be considered curry last night just ate curry last night i was appreciative they said here sister nadia's like here brother paul this is what you use to cool it down so instead of denying and saying i don't eat curry because that's well i just don't do that i took the advice that was given to me and figured out that two or three big spoonfuls of this antifreeze because you know it's to keep from getting too hot will work but as we move forward my brother and sister the world is changing around us and i kind of feel bad because i didn't get to this quote i want you to think as we close the service out how much we're taking with us we have traditions that contradict the word of god you say what are those traditions well they can be religious a lot of them are religious you know a brother one time i won't throw his name out there so nobody can criticize him but he said we sure have a lot of message catholics we have a lot of message methodists a lot of message lutherans saints [Music] don't preserve those traditions cutting this short the prophet of god said those are the traditions that make the word of god of none effect [Music] we're new creatures in christ jesus but do you realize this is also a new gospel and i understand a statement like that could be like oh no that's not a new gospel but it is it's a new gospel my brother and sister as compared to our old gospel same bible and i'll go a step further same message [Music] the prophet of god taking us back to the coming of christ [Music] him appearing making himself known to you and i he said i no longer are you ready do we believe that god's got to change we're a new people we're not an old people and this is not an old message to us this is a new message to us and he declared he said i no longer call you church i now call you bride what is that imagine i don't know i i guess maybe some of us probably would do it but imagine i poor gabriella going to pick on her that she would just come up and say paul i need 50 bucks now i love gabriella she's like a granddaughter to me but she would have to give me a really really really strong reason why i should give her fifty dollars because she knows i'm a cheapskate but you know what happens when my wife comes and says i need fifty dollars i found out that there's no use arguing there's no use trying to get an explanation you just reach in your pocket you pull out your wallet and you just give it to it now she knows that that's actually my sign of disapproval because if i really approve i take it out and give it to her myself but this is my disclaimer you're going to have to take it yourself my brother and sister god didn't expect you today to have to wrench the promises of god out of his hands he said every promise i have given you i will fulfill you he's here waiting for us to just come and ask we've been preserved can we say amen to that today we're preserved let's act like the bride of christ let's act like the chosen let's act like we have been called my brother and sister my i'm trying to i'm trying to dive into all this stuff here hallelujah brother jason would you please come and help me i only got a couple songs here well come to me when i studying brother jason i i don't remember the words but that song something about i give myself away amen let's just stand and sing that saints god bless you today i hope maybe by god's grace we say a little something that would stir your heart just remember no matter what the devil is saying to you today yesterday anytime god's already poured his preserving power into you you are standing here today secured by the word of god oh there's so many avenues to go into you know the title deed what is the title deed it describes what is already possessed you can't go down you know imagine what world we live in if you could go down the courthouse and say i just drove by this beautiful house out here with you know 10 acres and big beautiful horses roaming around in it and i want that to be mine so i want you to go in there and change the name on that imagine nobody'd own nothing because just in line at the courthouse it'd just be changing names but you see god come and says you know what i've already given you the title d what i need you to recognize nothing's changing that title deed you were mine you'll always be mine you'll continue to be mine from now through eternity hallelujah oh my my [Music] here i am [Music] lord my life is in your hands lord i'm longing to see your desire revealed in me i give myself away [Music] i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me [Music] take my heart take my life as a living sanctifies [Music] my dreams all my plans lord i place them in your hands i give myself away [Music] i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me oh let's take this next verse my life is not my own to you i belong i give myself i give myself to you my life is not my own to you i belong i give myself forgive myself [Music] i give myself forgive myself to you i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away [Music] i give myself away so you can use me [Music] have the preeminence hallelujah as we dismiss today i just encourage you [Music] all stubborn spirits my brother and sister stubbornness is a spirit of rebellion according to the word of god let's not be rebels let those stubborn spirits those things that we hold up i'm defending myself you don't need to defend yourself the word of god will defend you hallelujah hallelujah that doesn't mean you have to stay in a hostile environment and be uh be rated and those kind of things my brother and sister but to defend this message just live it get up in the morning commit your life to the lord just live it god knows what he's doing god doesn't need our help he just needs us to live it hallelujah [Music] i [Music] i'll speak with [Music] [Music] now you know i like to make these songs personal i believe it's just good it's nice they're beautiful songs they were anointed but i don't know why i've just for years now i've just i just sit in a tractor and i make it personal because i don't want it to be as though i'm just speaking in a general sense i want the lord to know remember the little story about the blind man in church and every once in a while he would just raise up his voice and shout glory hallelujah finally somebody says um why do you do that he said well i love the lord i hate the devil i just want all of you to know yeah hallelujah i want the devil to know this is not an abstract gospel it's not just a random thing i kind of somehow fell into this is who we are the very preserved back to original seed bride of christ oh hallelujah don't let me preach make it personal have the preeminence that you desire in my life all in my [Music] that you desire oh my lord in my life [Music] i'll speak with my [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh lord work [Music] [Applause] [Music] and walk with [Music] oh in my life hallelujah and i haven't sang it in at least a week so i got to sing it today if you don't mind we can

new testament church she's not a new as indifferent but she is the present tense expression of the upper room she is the upper room in this day hallelujah as i look out across the land see god's mighty [Music] just like in the days of old [Music] upside down [Music] a new testament church rising up rising [Music] there's a up testament church rising up now the bible plainly tells how the holy ghost found signs and ones were done by the apostles hands demon spirits were cast out in the jail they sang and shout while surrounded by [Music] there's a new testament church rising up yes rising
