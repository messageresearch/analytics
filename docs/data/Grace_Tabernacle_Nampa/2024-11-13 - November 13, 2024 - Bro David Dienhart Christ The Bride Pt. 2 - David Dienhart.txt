presence to know that you are here not an imagination not some theory of man not just a word but a reality a substance you are here not only are you here with us you're in us and so father what a unveiling what an unveiling we have to know this that all that you are we are and all that we are you are all that I am you are and all that you are I am and oh God how great is the unveiling of yourself in the climax in a full Revelation the the Capstone Revelation that we are speaking of tonight the coming of the Lord that we are speaking of tonight receiving us to yourself Lord what a great unfolding what a great Gathering but Lord we're going to a bigger Gathering we're going to be me him as clouds in heaven multitudes Lord we'll meet together God we're looking for that moment that great expectation we have by the unveiling and the and the Gathering uh calling us to the Gathering to yourself by your coming we are are great anticipation knowing we're at the very moment in time let us every day Lord expect the next moment to see our loved ones to be that resurrection that we're expecting and looking forward of the ages to come forth and For Your Glory now we ask your blessing upon your word in the name of Jesus Christ that we not we're not here in vain Lord as it's already been said so I say also this service has been ordered has been ordained already even to the very scriptures and the things that will be said it's been ordained what a great Revelation and peace we have Lord what a great faith to walk in we give you praise in Jesus name for you're worthy of it amen amen stand with me if you'll turn in your Bibles to Philippians we'll go back to Philippians a moment and you excuse me if I go to the scriptures we took I want to finish what I we started here if I can Lord willing tonight and um in Philippians chapter 1 and verse 21 Paul is speaking here of who he is Paul is speaking of where he lives what he is who he is and who he lives for for he said for me to live is Christ and die is gain for me to live what about your living for you to live who is it it's Christ Christ is the eternal life we are God's eternal life we are his life we are his eternal possession we are Christ in this hour we are the word anointed made manifest for this season you say those are great big words yes they are but they're becoming so real so one with the bride amen Ephesians chap 1 verse 10 having made verse n having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that's bride age that's bride time we're at the end of time of the fullness of times he might gather he might gather together in one all things in Christ notice what he's gathering in gathering together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on Earth even in him amen much could be read there but I just to save time I'll just go to Second Corinthians or 2 Thessalonians I wasn't going to read that but I'm just I told the Lord in there I'll follow it just as you give me to follow that's my that's my that's what I must do amen it's second Thessalonians 2:1 now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering to him unto him that you soon not be shaken in mind or trouble troubled e neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand you may be seated I want to just go back here on the on on the title we took for uh just a moment in rehearsing something brother brandham said in the message perfect faith in the M by last Wednesday we took a TI text or title of the message with bride material and he says and so when a man lives by faith now watch what he said says and walks by faith so let's reread this and he said I mean substance Faith so when a man lives by substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world praise the Lord I say praise the Lord and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material when a man lives by substance faith that's God's own faith and me just you've heard me quote this many times but the real believer is the faith of God that moves in him so it's operating it's alive it's living it's substance and we know that in God's mind his thoughts was substance the thoughts of himself I should say Let me clarify it not everything he thought but the thoughts of himself was substance faith because they were existing they were real and you were those thoughts you were a part of those thoughts so you were existing and you're real that's why today that's why today that when a man lives by substance Faith he's isolated from the entire world he's a new creature in Christ he said now there you're getting into bride material you're getting into rapturing condition he gives the orders he's your head so he gives the orders you pack back them out and that's where the rub comes I say the rub meaning that's where you're going to be in a battle because God says faith let Faith have its work let Faith produce and so when we when we come down to hearing the word we it's good to see our position we're preaching on it it's good to see where we're positionally placed who we are but now carry it out out now now take that word that's revealed to you and tomorrow by that Faith act out and take possession of what God made promised to you I don't care if it takes a hundred years he's got to bring it to pass God must fulfill his word and you're a part of that word his word will not return void neither will you return void being in him his word will not return void nor no nor what he sends forth can't return to him void it must go out and fulfill the purpose he sent it for amen so I'm going to so remember he said there's not a shadow whatever he says you pack it out there's not a shadow of it doubt nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same amen now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection which cannot fail that faith never fails yes you'll be a Mystic to them he was a Mystic with his perfect Faith you're going to be you're going to be persecuted they're going to think you're crazy because you're living by something that's unseen but yet you know it's seen you see it because it's substance amen he was a Mystic with his perfect Faith so are those who have perfect Faith you're a Mystic to others amen amen now we know that in St John 14:1 he said I've gone to prepare a place for you and I will come again and receive you and and that's exactly what's happening that's what's been happening that's why the seals were opened that's why the the those seven angels that came down he says here he says he says now the first time he come he come to redeem his bride there's three comings of Christ the first time he come he come to redeem his bride the second time he comes to catch away his bride now people look at that say well we haven't come to that yet oh yes we have come to it it's in progress we just haven't come to the end of it yet are you with me see there's a there's a progression of that there's there's a faith related to that there's there's there's a mystery of his coming and that's what the bride sees she sees his coming why because she's a part of it amen she's in it she actually is his coming because the way he comes it how he comes that's the mystery that was under that seventh seal and that's the mystery that brother Brandon preach called Christ The Mystery of God revealed amen that he preached that message was preaching the seventh seal and he said now so he comes he said but this coming the catch away his bride is Like A Love Affair now these are just things you heard me I'm just coming back just a little bit here before we go forward he said it's like a love affair he said no remember brother Bram said in perfect Faith the same message or not the same message message I read from he said this he said he's pouring out himself into her they are becoming one for the wedding supper and then he go I'm not quoting the whole thing exactly but he said but it's a love affair they are becoming one so there is your there is your union taking place he's come to receive you who's come the bridegroom the marriage has come amen anybody believe that the marriage is come let us be glad and be Rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb is come all right so he says now so it's a love affair he comes around and steals her out her out he steals her out at night time Isaiah 60 verse1 and two said it's night time yes gross Darkness Darkness upon the people gross I mean gross Darkness upon the world gross darkness of people but the light is upon thee and the and the glory of the Lord is seen upon thee you know he doesn't share his glory with everyone with no he doesn't share his glory with anyone he shares his glory with himself see you're not anyone you're not you're not you're not another excuse me he doesn't share his glory with another but you're not another all right you're him so but he takes her out at nighttime right in the midst of gross Darkness he's taking her out amen there's a going how many believe there's a going at the same time there's a going there's a coming all right we couldn't have a going without a coming and we couldn't be going without coming somewhere right that's right we're going somewhere aren't we but it's by his coming all right now that sounds strange that sounds like double talk but that's the truth all right now so he steals her out at night time takes her away from the world so the second time he come he's just referring again again what he said the second time is to receive his bride to catch away his bride is to receive his bride amen first time to redeem her second time to receive her third time with her king and queen other words you step out in the millennium you step out you walk upon the ashes of the wicked together remember brother Braham said the the the calvary man Jesus Christ Our Lord and Redeemer will not step foot on the earth until the Millennium amen so see who's he come out with amen the family comes walking out yeah God is family all right so what do we coming out to again we're walking right back out in to Eden amen right back right back into the Seventh Day the Earth was in a seventh day is that right he was in the seventh day we go right back into that seventh day for the bride it's not seventh day we're past the seventh day but for the Earth it's in its seventh day amen and what is that seventh day it's it's in its Sabbath it's rest all right so now he said so we can find that and I'm going to miss some of these scriptures but in in uh well let's go to first Thessalonians 4:16 or four chapter 4 Thessalonians chapter 4 all right then and watch your walk with him your walk with him is is you see it's not it his secret catching away of his bride of course is in the night now he now he's coming his coming his coming is known only to who his bride that's all think of it in the world today this thing this great event this great thing is happening and nobody knows about it but the bride that's right amen amen not all to claim to believe this message is bride but there is a bride that is the message and so and so in first Thessalonians and I want to make note of 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first notice what follows this descending is that the dead in Christ will rise first so where are we in this Union he does all three things while he descends said he does all three there's a shout a message there's the voice of the resurrection and there's a trump of gathering amen are you with me that's all three while he descends it's in his descent but what follows the descending the Resurrection The Catching away in in the air amen so we can't misplace these things we must take it the way the prophet interpreted it and don't try to put your interpretation to what he said because you can't you can't add to it you can't take away from it all right now let's go to I want I'm just going to make me let's take verse 17 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds clouds is a multitude great great multitude to meet the Lord in the air and and to ever and so shall we ever be with the Lord he said wherefore Comfort one another with these words all right let's take acts one again so we can just get these things in our hearts acts chap 1 you know where we're going verse 9 and when he had spoken these things let's take verse eight so we just get it in continuity but ye but he but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which said to you men of Galilee why stand you gazing into heaven this same Jesus not another are you with me this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you've seen him go into heaven and and he shall descend amen with a shout the message how many know the shout is the message amen the message has a voice and the voice the message John Heard a Voice as of a trumpet amen amen so we see here and let's go on in modern events made clear by prophecy he he said dear God as this audience bows their head and heart in this solemn moments here of closing this Bible lecture when we see the Vindication of the Holy Spirit shook this nation back and forth great revivals and indications other words great revivals brother Braham said I've seen great things healing of the sick great miracles signs and wonders done by only Christ himself is that right all right but he said but something has has to follow that and and then see those seven angels come down here on the top of the mountain brother Braham said those seven angels represented the seven churches all completed they took the picture not us they took the picture of them amen all right where was his authority expressed through those Messengers he who Jesus Christ all right so he said and came down there on top of the mountain Yonder in Arizona and even magazines across the Nations packed it to see Jesus himself now I'm I'm I'm we made emphasis on this at the end of the meeting but I want to come back to this to see Jesus himself there in the skies looking down and speaking saying saying in Revelation in the Revelation 10:7 notice you say well he didn't he didn't say yes he did say because he had to go there to get the revelation of the message in Revelation 10 brother brah said I had to go there West be caught up there to meet that notable Angel are you with me and he said I had I had that held that seventh seal and come back and open those that those seals up amen are you with me all right so he said to see and saying in the he's saying how's he saying in the scripture he's saying the Revelation 10:7 in the seventh Angel's message these seals would be open the mysteries of God would be known the reformers didn't live long enough to bring it out and here those Seven Seals that sealed the whole thing that sealed the whole thing is to be opened in this day and all those great signs signs and wonders that's been done Vindicated foretold before it happened they was foretelling before it happened not one time if you fa has you ever have you ever failed us but brought it to pass just as it was said I'm going to go to paragraph 12 of rising of the sun he said this here he said and and so there he spoke to me and said the Seven Seals be opened he said the Sevenfold mystery of the Bible that been closed since the foundation of the world will be revealed and he said we as a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings he said those blessings in hearing those Mysteries such as he would say marriage divorce serpent seed all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by God himself that's now watch you say not by man no he used man but when that man that Prophet had that sword strike his hand whose hand was it striking who held it other words if he held the sword in his hand then God held it in his hand amen are you with me William brandham isn't God I'm not making him God but God was standing there with the sword in his hand that's exactly right because we've got to look Beyond and realize the word comes to His prophets nobody could hold that sword but God himself so who was standing there who did open those seals are you with me I hope we get what I'm saying here all right I'm not lifting up a man but I am lifting up the Lord Jesus the lion of the tribe of Judah who manifests himself as lamb hello all right now he said these sealed these these things these questions have been completed revealed to us not by man but by God himself that's opened those seven mysteries of what and brother brandom called it a Sevenfold mystery it's a Sevenfold mystery he said of what the watch what the mystery watch what watch what these seals have opened up watch your promise for today watch his coming watch what's happening watch your position he said those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in Christ at the beginning and how it will be revealed in the last day all right now I believe there he's speaking not of the church natural he's speaking of the bride and he said if you'll just turn this picture like this and look you can probably see it from the audience it's Christ now he's referring to the cloud picture it's Christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and we're going to come to this Sunday and judge of all Heaven and Earth and judge who's being revealed here well you said it's Christ that's right but who's going to judge the Earth but he's the judge right all right he said he's the judge okay he comes to judge we find that we'll find that Sunday can't you see his eyes can you see his eyes well he talking just like it's a real person there well it is can't you see his eyes it is and he is now amen what was he coming to do he wasn't coming in the form of the calvary man but he was coming in a form that's right he wasn't coming in the form of the calvary man but he was coming in a form he changed his mask it's still that person but when he come to the Earth he's walking around now on Earth he's descended he's Gathering he's uniting with the marriage has come so who is she uh who is he yeah dressed in a woman's garment but it was the son of man one likened un the son of man but brother Bram said that was him dressed in a in a in a garment in the midst of the church as a woman as the bride amen but look where it's come up to now the Capstone of it what was the Capstone of creation Adam in the female form because without her she wasn't he wasn't complete she had to be manifested all right she had to be manifested in order to complete the creation but she was an original she was taken out of an original creation amen are you with me she was his Spirit but she had a different body but the same dust amen it's the same person putting on an actor's garment for this drama for this portion of the drama for this curtain to raise what was this curtain raising the seventh all right now so he says now he's Supreme judge none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a Vindication this message this message is the truth amen this is the truth it's true not making him a third person but the only person all right see brother Braham said could say after that this little bride this bride and the groom are no more Twain they're one amen the they're one who who who are they who who is he let's put it that way who is he or I could say who is she well she's him who is he she is that right all right now so in the light of his resurrection yeah well stop a minute with the white see see with the white he said you see the dark his face face his beard his eyes and looking he from him comes the light he said in the light of his resurrection we go forth in his name praise the Lord he said we at the end time he said the he said when that light came down there in Jeffersonville in 1933 and spoke these words as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message right your message yeah that's right will forun the second coming we're at the end time and we were at the end time that's when it was to come forth he said and we see it all right I'll leave that okay he come to redeem all that was on that book now in this day in this day there's to come a super let's just back up here a minute in this day the scripture is fulfilled the Holy Ghost is the word of God in you what is the Holy Ghost the quickening power it's the quickener it's the quickening spirit that new creation is the second man which is the quickening spirit which brother brandom said the real you is the spirit of God that Spirit In You And he says the Holy Ghost is the word of God in you and watch what it does that identifies itself that identifies Itself by accepting that word watch what he says I'll of that it can't be the Holy Ghost if it says it's the Holy Spirit and denies one word of that Bible it cannot be the Holy Spirit that's the evidence whether you believe or not what is the evidence by accepting the word and if you accept the word you say oh I accept everybody said we accept the word but they can't live it they can't manifest it but this bride is the very manifestation of that word what that's her position that's what she's called to do all right now so he said now we find out the condition of the world we see where the church n normal or he's he's meaning nominal the organization denomination we see where they are we see where the nations are we see that this day we and we see that this day these promises is fulfilled do we absolutely all right now he said now but but now but in this day there's to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham now what would you say that super Royal Seed of Abraham is it's Christ there's no other super Royal seed but Christ now remember remember my title we're continuing with my title Christ the bride we're continuing with the move is on for the bride that's what we're talking about this moving this move is on for the bride not for another for the bride not for the church the bride all right but this but in this day there's to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham which we said is Christ that's exactly what it would be yes now watch what he's saying what it would be would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son so now we have a promise now we see what is coming how he would manifest it now we see what he is and where his second coming is unfolding where is it in this Royal bride Christ as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed just like it was in Mary amen but watch Mary had to be delivered and when she was delivered what what was that God in sun form are you with me what about when she's delivered today what would it be God in Bride form you say when I today would it would it be I'm talking about the Pentecostal shook amen when she comes out of that shook what is she and the shuck has to let go life is left the shuck then where's the bride she's the word manifested for the day the promise of the day amen are you with me don't I want to lose you here there's not very many here so we're just you know we got to just keep bringing the these things out here okay now there's to be a spiritual bride raised up which will be the Royal seed of the RO watch of the royal faith of Abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene she is to come on the scene in the last days what would she be she would be Christ coming on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is promise is a promise is a promise that's given to her now what did the prophet say now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in so I said the going is the coming going in coming in his bride there'll have to be a message according to Malachi 4 there's arise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers again there is to rise one on the scene in the power of Elijah that'll rise on the scene A wilderness man remember now keep in mind I don't have time to quote it but the the the messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 does two things you know what he said that's Church age book okay keep that in mind so the one to come on the scene will rise on the scene in the power of Elijah to raise on the scene A wilderness man that'll come out and will'll have a message that'll run straight right back to the word again that's the hour we're living in what is the hour we're living in Bride age seed time bride time it'll have to go right back to the seed word again but brother brandham said what would it be it would be a word bride or he called it a bride word also so it's coming the seed again and that's why the prophet said seed time or he said or to clarify it bride time because she's seed she's Christ in feminine form as his wife how can the wife be anything different than him he's not going to marry something different than himself he'll marry himself that sounds strange doesn't it but he'll marry himself because she's come from him see God is bride God is son God is family God is God all right now consider now I ask you at this hour you people here of Jeffersonville now he's speaking of this day the scriptures fulfilled consider now I ask you you people of Jeffers ofil in 1933 the supernatural light which he called a star by the way it was the same star that led the wise men that's exactly right go back and see what he said about it it was moving they watched it move where we're following that same star too you know and where does that star lead us right to the word made flesh in you amen and who is it as I said so w let's quit belly aing let's quit murmuring let's just take the word and believe it and hold to it I don't care what it feels like how it appears to be it's absolute it cannot fail amen all right there has to be something that cannot fail because we see a lot that does so there's got to be something that doesn't is that right how can there be failure without one that can't fail amen all right now so that light fell down yonder at the river that day when I was baptizing 500 in the name of Jesus Christ as about 20 years old boy what did it say Jeffersonville now he's referring back to what it said he said what did it say a light come down from heaven shining above like a star falling from the heaven a voice said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message shall forerun his second coming now watch into all the world yeah where is it in all the world right can only be in his wife and who is it it's him coming into all the world is coming into all the world that's right all right he said this day he doesn't move any P qualms about it this day this scripture is fulfilled it's pretty definite all right he said I've introduced you to him who did he introduce to him I've introduced the bride to you I've introduced you to I've introduced him to you bride I must decrease he must increase and the prophet said one place he said I must decrease he must increase and the Millennium will be on right away all right another place he said oh oh bride oh if you only knew your positive position who's increasing he is in Bride form who's increasing she the bride is amen when I say she is it's he is because she can be nothing without him she came from him and in order for her to move or act or do anything it's him talk about talk about confidence talk about dependency that's it it's dependency your message shall forerun his second coming what your message amen all right now I've introduced you to him oh bride here is your positive position I'm saying that here is your positive position what's next what's he said old if you only knew it the bride does now she does now she knows it now she she's coming into a maturity of that here's your positive position it's Christ what's next to follow this coming of Christ the Millennium Back to Eden 7 Day rest for the Earth amen amen amen amen amen now I had something I was going to refer to let me just get that here okay I'll bypass that I just said it yeah I've introduced you to him son of man revealed in bright form she is him that's exactly right all right now I me I'm pausing here because I I know I've got just a certain amount of time and I'm going to have to bypass some of this see life has left the shuck is now in the bride form we know that all right he said we realize dear God we realize that Jesus Christ is in our midst amen I wonder if you'd realize that I wonder if we'd know that I wonder if we realize it I was standing here the other morning I stand not here but in my office I got up got up wake first thing I look at is some scripture I'm looking at that and I all of a sudden it just swept over me he's standing right here in your presence and it just I can't explain that can anybody explain Revelation it's just like it was brand new to me and I've never been the same since I thought then Lord let what I say and do let my actions reactions testify of you because you really realize that and recognize it and then just like we recognize who's holding that sword see who who opened those he said he opened those seals he used new as a prophet because he the word comes to His prophets but that was the king's sword what is he saying the king is here I'm speaking through my Prophet this is my word this is my coming this is the opening of my this is my message this is uniting with the bride this is the full Revelation amen this is the manifestation of myself coming in full revelation so we so we can go back home right so he says now he said they're one okay now he said that great day now look now we're looking for we're looking for a great thing to happen it's happening but we're looking for a greater thing to happen you say how how can it be greater because we got to come to a body change this is going to bring it this brings it I say this message brings it but this message has got to become flesh and it is because it's the bride coming of Christ and it's the Capstone Revelation I just read it to you what these seals are open for and it's the Capstone brother Bram said that message of Revelations 10 is the Capstone Revelation amen it's a Capstone message it's a Capstone Ministry that corner turned it's the Capstone Ministry amen and we grow up into that stature of himself the capstone's unveiled we grow into it didn't the Bible say we grow into the head who is the head what is our maturity it's him amen amen amen all right now so that great thing that we're looking forward to come will come quickly what is this great thing we're looking forward to come I just read it to you in 1 Corinthians or Thessalonians 4:16 17 amen I read it to you in verse 17 that after that descending he said the dead in Christ shall rise is that right what are we looking for what great thing are we looking for coming quickly our meeting in the air our meeting of our loved ones amen and Christ in you is the hope of glory what is Christ in you the hope of glory substance Faith God's thought expressed amen what is the bride today what is how can we come to our position today God's thought expressed speaks to you and I amen and this that we have working in us now and Al in US is a creative word it's God's thought the word express the word working in and through you all right so so Grant it Lord and you'll take the church your bride and take her home we see all these we see all we see it all setting in order come Lord Jesus amen come all right see we see right there in 1 Thessalonians 4 the order of his coming do you understand you see we read it right there that's the order of his coming all right now things that are to be you suffered with him you died with him you was buried with him and now you are risen with him manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now let me just stop right there setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus is the bride's position all that means so much nowadays Church it means so much to see ourselves positionally placed in ch in Jesus Christ what is that our positive position all right and so we're we're we are coming we are being united with the Sun we're laying in the presence of the son that son that is risen to bring the bride to full stature himself in Bride form what is the full stature himself in Bride form we are him it's the full complete revelation of the whole thing so we can say this day this scripture is being fulfilled 1 Thessalonians 4676 is being fulfilled Ephesians 110 is being fulfilled every one of these scriptures see the Royal seed being fulfilled the message of the hour the opening of seals fulfilled the going of the Bride the the head the head coming in Bride form we see it being fulfilled those attributes of God we cannot live by Creed we cannot live by denomination ISM we must live by the word because the Bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God Living Word brother Brown said she would be the word living and in action what is the word living operative in action all right so we must be the word living and in Action a living attribute that's an attribute of his his thought is himself an attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God watch what he said where is it being displayed to the world see what is this coming it's going into all the world okay where's the attributes of God being displayed in the formation of the Bride where is it in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed that's he comes again she's to come on the scene that's to be expressed expressed what's the expression the thought you're in the thought and that bride to come in the formation of the Bride that thought's got to be expressed in this hour and when it was expressed it called you spoke through his bride expressed the thought the word for the season and it and it found you it found you you're a spoken word creation you're the word spoken in this day made manifest all right so it finds you that's to express in the hour we're now living you're expressed in the hour we're now living the manifestation of that Spirit of his Spirit then what's it doing the manifestation of his spirit is not will it is is here's your secret catching away is catching a bride away he said it right right here works as Faith expressed the manifestation of his spirit is catching away a bride Rapture is in progress that's the coming of the lord it's a secret catching away just what he said the second coming would be see that's absolutely contrary to every denominational Creed you ever heard because they don't see that coming they're looking expecting a great trumpet to be blown the skies the the clouds to break open the clouds have broken open but not the way they say broke are you with me it's see see it's just contrary but he comes in Simplicity and reveals himself through the same he hides in Simplicity and reveals himself through the same all right now so so that's what it is coming in the formation of the Bride is being manifested and it's catching away a bride let that Faith let that Faith substance Faith bride material let that Faith Christ in you let that faith and he and he has in parentheses Revelation let that Revelation fall into your heart this is the hour this is the hour oh W be going we have a have that hour no this is the hour what we're looking for is a consummation of that hour which is our catch which is which is is the final state of our catching away which is the meeting of our loved ones and resurrection and meeting him in the air who's him our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen because you're United with him you're one with him the sign has come in the Heavens to announce uniting time is here he called it the uniting time sign all right okay you see the whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation amen amen of who he was of who he was are you with me you have to have that revelation of who he was okay but watch what he says but now upon he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church gates of hell can't Prevail against it the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour He Still Remains the Same it's the same revelation of who he was but now who he was is who he is because the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour are you with me you watch what he's saying he can't change so the Revelation so who he is is still who he is but what's changed not what he was in another hour but what he is now now the Bible expresses it's growing in the bride it's growing where it's growing in the bride what is growing in the bride the new creation it's growing in the bride what is the new birth brother brandom it's the revelation of Jesus Christ revealed personally to you it's growing in the bride to the full stature what's the full stature see himself what's himself what's it going to do change these bodies amen are you with me all right therefore if see it's just he's just he come into a different same person same person the bride is not another person she grows up into the very person himself all right but it's a different garment same person all right now so we understand how the bride had to fall in the Dark Ages the grain had to fall in the ground to die it can't reproduce itself but now it fell in the ground and it come up through Luther Wesley Pentecost and come out to the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for this last day see it's him in the formation of his bride whoever would have dreamed whoever had it taught nobody that his coming would be this way see outside of the of the denominational teaching see what they missed his first coming is because they had him coming another way is that right is that why they missed it they had it all figured out he would come he would they didn't know he would they didn't believe he would come this way because their theology taught him he would come another way it's the same thing today amen they don't expect him to come like this well where is he where is he here he is yet I say here he is but this is what's inside well it don't look like the calvary man oh well you're just judging from an outward appearance the person is the Holy Ghost himself right oh oh it's Jesus Christ revealed amen are you with me all right all right so he says now so we see when he began to reveal himself into the seed form again the same one that went in the ground come back to be the the same one that went in the ground came back to be the bride just the bride and groom is the same Flesh and Blood same Ministry the same things doing exactly what he done what is it it's the spirit but there will come on Earth by God's promise a genuine servant of God identified by God by his word being the answer of this day that'll set the bride in order real little minority of the church and take it up now you have the order right there and take it up he'll introduce behold there's the one I talked about see that'll come behold there's the one I talked about see that'll come remember remember John the Baptist was on earth when Jesus came he said there he is Prophet said there he is he said that's our Lord up there he said in quickening power Let's us see his coming quickening power he said one come maturity that speak into to existence and he said that same quickening power will be in the bride in their mouth amen because they grow into that they have to grow in that stature and and that wave sheath waved over them and every one of those those genuine wheat plant seed is going to come to that same maturity so see what I we been saying we're going to come right back to it again to follow him is to take him at his word amen is to have his word open to you is to know him to know him is the word living is the word itself amen we've gone beyond the emotions I'm not saying I disagree with it or don't be no I do emotions but that's no evidence we've come Beyond emotion we've come Beyond these things into the genuine revelation of the word himself that's what Jesus pointed him to the signs pointed them to that person on Earth then if you can't believe me believe the works that I do they testify of who I am search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me can't the bride say the same thing I've come from God and I returned back to God Amen we were his very thought expressed here come into the Earth in this hour and this time to fulfill the scriptures here of the Capstone and we're going right back amen is that right right same thing amen Jesus said his own body his own flesh his own self couldn't do the works it's my father that's in me that does it he's the son in himself can do nothing but what the father shows him my father worketh hitherto and I work amen is that right that's the same thing with the bride it's the same word brother sister it's just a different flesh but by the blood he Sanctified a body so quit looking at your failures and mistakes and look at the one that Sanctified the body and comes in it and dwells by the Revelation he's put in you of himself you have him then walk with him amen amen all right so now that's why he he's got to increase where's he increasing who's increasing the message himself the message is increasing in the body in the formation of the Bride you see your position there's nothing to fear there's nothing to fret over he's absolutely in control who is you the perfect word the perfect one inside of you is in control because you're one with him Lord amen all right now they come blood relation who is Isaac and Rebecca the bride and the groom they blood relation his own blood relation they have to come blood relation to Christ through the sacrifice our sins are omitted by the blood of Jesus amen amen but what the blood has done and prove that it's done by the word working through same thing carrying out the same Ministry he had the same blood see the same life he that is in you greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world what is in you that's greater it's Christ the anointed Christ the Anointed God Christ the word god anointed that word amen God Christ in you the Anointed God that was in Christ is in you greater is he that is in you amen then if he is in you then if he is in you it's not you anymore Living Boy is that a great setting of free that's Freedom that's Freedom that's you're set free see you're freed it's no more you living it's him living in you not your thinking what you would think about this it's what said about this I hope you can just put several exclamation points after that it's not your thinking about this it's what he said about it this see then if he is in you he absolutely would not deny what he said he couldn't do it but he would keep what he said and he's trying to find the person he can vindicate himself through he that's greater in you than he that's in the world God in you like it was God in you like it was in Jesus Christ God in you like it was in Jesus Christ what all then then where's the victory our faith our faith is the victory that overcometh the world it's our Victory what's our faith him revealed in you it's that substance Faith that's who you are that's the perfect one amen amen he that's in you God in you like he was in Jesus Christ what all God see what all God was he poured into Christ so if he's in you like he was in Jesus Christ that makes you then the real you more than a man you're more than a man he was more than a man he cried like a man but when he cried Lazarus come forth that's more than a man or when he cried that squirrel will be over there in that tree that was more than a man or when he said to the ship peace be still to the winds that was more than a man he was tired he was wore out he sleeping as a man but when he took stood up there and said peace be still that was more than a man that was the perfect one speaking through the man that was Christ in you like it was in him it's the same quickening power it's the same quickening spirit amen so how are you living by substance Faith you live by faith amen the just shall live by faith the the they're going to live by we're living by every word that's how we live Paul said for me to live is Christ he not only say that's my absolute it is it's in me it's my absolute it's my guide but he said that's who I am for me to live is Christ and to die is gain amen amen so what he all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church see it's God in you all God was he poured into church all that I am you are and all that you are now watch that's God unveiled all that I am he said you are and all that you are I am I don't see anything but one person there in that day you'll know that I'm in my father father in me I and you and you and me still one person amen if I if he's in me and I'm in him and he's in me and and I'm in you whatever I am is in you and what's in you is in me and what's in me is him so it's all him who is she and he's not complete without you amen no wonder winds and waves obey obeyed his word amen amen obeyed his words because it was God's word through him he was a man but he was the word you're a man but you're the word that's it I can we can truly say this little bride is more than a man if all we have in this life is this to look at to know we are men most miserable is that right but we have a perfect word living in us a perfect birth a perfect creation a perfect word a perfect Christ a perfect leader a perfect guide everything we need is already provided even this night was provided God knew exactly who would be here tonight God knew exactly what I would be saying tonight and and believing it's him saying it you say well you're just quoting I'm not just be quoting I'm talking about a word that's become alive I am preaching Faith no matter if I take this the quotes and others don't take it it's still faith if we speak contrary to what he said or contrary I'm not talking about well you got to have it just for btim no it's saying what he said are you with me yes but but God trains a certain way and guides a certain way and I have a certain calling my calling is different than that brother standing behind that desk back there we can't we have the same Christ we have the same but his calling is different he's he preaches differently that's exactly right I'm not ashamed to say that we're not belittling anybody it's Christ a many membered body it's a god of variety amen he made me the way I am happy to stay that way he called me to do a certain work in certain way and I have to stay in that way but there's one thing I'm certain of he called me to preach the word and he I called me to be a part of that fivefold Ministry and he said well be un me if I don't preach it so I have a choice and I'm glad he made the choice because that's my choice hallelujah how did he make that choice CU he knew what I would do so if he chose me before the foundation all the world knowing what I would do then what I would do is make my choice for him hello see all right now all right so he was a man but he was the word made flesh he was a man but he was a word made flesh amen amen he said brother Bram said I've spoken to you pretty plain one of the messages said I've spoken to you very plain tonight he said can't you see the authority of the Living God in the Living Church the bride amen these things happen manifested he Liv see and when he spoke it was God speaking through human lips the secret is the word is in the bride she has thus saith the Lord or she keeps still now wouldn't you like to see a people live like that move don't move until he says move wouldn't you like you're going to it's got to come and it's coming and it's happening right now these words are being fulfilled I believe that with all my heart all right she he said now thus sayith the Lord or keep still now he works now he now works in and through his bride she knows this she's the Royal seed of the Royal promised son she's the promised word for this day she's the promised word for this day my oh my what a statement she's the complete Revelation if you're a she she you are makes you the comp the word in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing all right now we can either believe that or we just say Well he kind of meant that I well I I don't know about the whole thing

be caught up one of these days remember it's a secret secret catching away he'll come in an hour that you think not you won't know nothing about it it's happening now it's moving right through the people a supernatural event passing through and only the elect bride knows it she sees it she's partaking of it and she is it praise the Lord you can stand with me God bless you what is this bride she's a virgin word of God made manifest excuse me she's a virgin born word of God she's a virgin born word of God made manifest what is that virgin born word of God it's Jesus Christ the same

truth we see your coming into all the world this day this scripture is fulfilled we love you Lord there's probably things I might have missed here but I depended upon you to bring it amen you had a purpose to bring forth a people liken unto yourself and that would be the word bride she was chosen in you and beloved before she was ever brought forth in the ages she would beloved she's Redeemed by your blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her she's a prisoner of you Lord she's a prisoner of the word and she can't move until God moves [Music] her and Lord we're seeing a church raised like that we're seeing a bride raised like that that it's it's it is on the scene lord it's taking place and because he knew who he was we
