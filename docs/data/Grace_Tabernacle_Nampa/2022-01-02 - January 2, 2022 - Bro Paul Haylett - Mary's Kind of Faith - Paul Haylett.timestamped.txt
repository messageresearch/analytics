[32:10] praise god
[32:16] aren't you glad we're not constrained to
[32:18] a location or a certain time to praise
[32:21] the lord but
[32:22] we can get up in the morning and praise
[32:24] him we can be
[32:25] working praise him you can be sitting in
[32:29] traffic on the freeway
[32:30] and praise him amen
[32:33] well god bless you amen where's never a
[32:36] visitor as it were in the house of god
[32:38] but god bless you good to see you
[32:40] and uh god bless you brother and sister
[32:43] visitors here uh pray that the lord just
[32:45] bless you today and uh to worship with
[32:48] us
[32:49] amen now
[32:51] we don't want to forget uh communion
[32:54] tonight five o'clock so uh all that can
[32:57] make it we sure encourage you it's
[33:00] one of those things that was commanded
[33:01] by the scripture
[33:03] and um
[33:05] kind of taken this upon myself
[33:08] we made great progress the brothers have
[33:10] but we are going to not have church this
[33:13] coming wednesday
[33:15] so that brother david
[33:17] sister ruth were witnesses last night of
[33:19] the chaos that we had in the building
[33:21] and look how nice it looks this morning
[33:24] but we want to just press forward in
[33:26] this coming week again
[33:28] so all that are able to come and help
[33:32] you say i don't have a skill to do that
[33:34] we can give you a very quick tutorial
[33:37] and
[33:38] so
[33:39] anyway no wednesday night service as we
[33:42] press for finishing up the doors and
[33:44] baseboard and these kind of things that
[33:46] we're changing out in the church
[33:49] so
[33:50] communion at five o'clock let's stand
[33:53] and just go right into the word of god
[33:55] today uh once again just as the overview
[33:59] thought is the two sides of obedience uh
[34:02] there is my brother and sister
[34:05] the obvious side that we look in the
[34:06] scripture we'll try and expound or touch
[34:09] on this uh
[34:11] in the course of our thought today
[34:13] but um
[34:15] we really when you talk about obedience
[34:17] people have different ideas
[34:19] you know they say well are we following
[34:21] the church are we following a man
[34:23] but uh we
[34:25] place this above all else right this is
[34:28] the preeminence of what a christian
[34:31] follows it is not
[34:34] the church's point of view uh as far as
[34:37] a religion or denomination but the bible
[34:40] is our absolute and i hope today i can
[34:43] tie this together for you
[34:47] it seems as though it might be slightly
[34:49] disjointed in one sense but i i pray
[34:52] that uh you can catch this connection of
[34:55] mary's kind of faith
[34:58] uh you know it uh my brother and sister
[35:01] we often talk of mary you know the
[35:03] holiday season always brings about you
[35:06] know mary in some form fashion but um
[35:10] there's really much more to what
[35:12] happened in the life of mary
[35:14] and we won't even try to cover all of
[35:17] that today maybe in uh future services
[35:20] to do but to see the correlation or the
[35:23] connection
[35:24] uh of the very faith of the believer
[35:28] and mary it's just very much a very much
[35:31] a connection mary was not an isolated
[35:34] individual she was actually mainstream
[35:37] she was actually very much a
[35:39] representation
[35:41] of the effect of the gospel on humanity
[35:45] and so we'll just look today as we'll
[35:47] start here in 1st peter
[35:50] it will seem like we're going in a
[35:51] different direction but i want you to
[35:53] just
[35:54] remain with an open thought
[35:57] until we till we get to that and
[36:00] so
[36:01] as we start here first peter the first
[36:04] chapter verses one through nine
[36:14] peter an apostle of jesus christ to the
[36:17] strangers scattered throughout pontus
[36:19] galatia cappadocia asia and bithya
[36:22] elect
[36:24] according to the foreknowledge of god
[36:27] i just come across a little deal the
[36:28] other day and somebody arguing there's
[36:31] no such thing as predestination
[36:34] but when you take these back the
[36:36] scripture right here verse second is
[36:38] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[36:40] god so we would to to deny god the
[36:43] knowledge of who would serve him would
[36:45] be to deny this scripture
[36:47] and so we see elect according to the
[36:49] foreknowledge of god the father through
[36:52] the sanctification of the spirit unto
[36:54] obedience
[36:56] and sprinkling of the blood of jesus
[36:58] christ grace unto you and peace be
[37:01] multiplied because we're not going to
[37:02] come back so much into this scripture i
[37:06] want to just bring in this small portion
[37:09] to you right now
[37:10] you see my brother and sister everything
[37:13] to do with the word of god and the
[37:15] christian life is centered around
[37:18] obedience
[37:19] you cannot say well i'm i do
[37:22] all of this but this part i disregard
[37:25] it is the sum of all parts that makes
[37:29] the whole so the scripture says that if
[37:32] you're guilty of the law in one small
[37:35] portion you're guilty of the whole law
[37:38] but we don't want to look at it that way
[37:39] we want to understand that we as sons
[37:41] and daughters of god have a desire to be
[37:44] obedient
[37:45] to all of the scripture
[37:47] not the portion that's convenient
[37:50] but all of it
[37:53] blessed be the god and father of our
[37:55] lord jesus christ who according to his
[37:57] abundant mercy hath begotten us again
[38:00] into a lively hope by the resurrection
[38:03] of jesus christ from the dead
[38:05] amen lively hope can we emphasize that
[38:08] hey maybe we can even repeat that lively
[38:11] hope
[38:12] amen not old dead letter not a woe unto
[38:16] me but a lively hope by the resurrection
[38:18] of jesus christ
[38:20] to an inheritance incorruptible and
[38:22] undefiled and fadeth not away reserved
[38:25] in heaven for you
[38:27] now look um i don't mean to keep you
[38:29] standing but i just want to touch on
[38:31] these things because we're going to move
[38:32] on but
[38:34] it's reserved
[38:38] you know i mean i don't know how many of
[38:40] you have a favorite restaurant and you
[38:42] know it's busy and you know that uh if
[38:45] you call them
[38:47] there will be a table waiting for you
[38:50] now
[38:51] there are little things in the natural
[38:54] so don't hold me a hundred percent but
[38:56] you go there
[38:58] with the expectation now
[39:00] that they're not going to say who are
[39:02] you
[39:04] but they acknowledge
[39:05] are you mr and mrs yes
[39:08] your table
[39:09] is waiting
[39:11] reservation my brother and sister is
[39:13] very very incredible
[39:16] because you see this is reserved
[39:19] in heaven
[39:21] for you
[39:23] wow
[39:24] you're not going to get there you know
[39:26] the the figure they have of peter at the
[39:28] gate you're not going to get there and
[39:29] say sorry i can't find your name
[39:32] this is reserved they're going to come
[39:34] and because of the foreknowledge of god
[39:36] they're going to say
[39:37] welcome
[39:39] welcome
[39:40] hallelujah thank you lord
[39:43] who are kept by the power of god through
[39:46] faith into salvation ready to be
[39:47] revealed in the last time
[39:50] wherein ye greatly rejoice though now
[39:52] for a season if need be you're in
[39:54] heaviness through manifold temptations
[39:57] that the trial of your faith being much
[39:59] more precious than of gold that pairs
[40:02] though it be tried with fire might be
[40:04] found into praise and honor and glory at
[40:07] the appearing of jesus christ whom
[40:10] having not seen ye love in whom though
[40:13] now you see him not yet believing
[40:16] ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
[40:19] of glory receiving the end of your faith
[40:46] come to worship you
[40:48] may we just enter into the word father
[40:50] claim our portion today apply it to our
[40:52] lives lord that we walk out happy and
[40:55] victorious in the name of jesus christ
[40:58] amen you may be seated
[41:10] as we look at this scripture i want to
[41:11] use that to
[41:13] lay a foundation i've always liked this
[41:15] scripture for one it reminds me reminds
[41:18] us of the value of trials
[41:20] now if we just looked at trials for
[41:22] trials sake without a revelation of
[41:24] scripture we would look at that and say
[41:26] my my life is just full of all kinds of
[41:29] troubles and and uh why why is this
[41:32] befalling me but when we look through
[41:34] the scripture and realize how precious
[41:37] the scripture declares to us that trials
[41:40] are and we look at that and then it kind
[41:43] of changes our perspective uh because we
[41:47] as humans kind of tend to lean to things
[41:50] of intrinsic value we we recognize those
[41:53] and we hold to those and so when we look
[41:56] at trials in
[41:58] the uh face of the value and not of the
[42:01] present circumstance then we'll realize
[42:03] just how precious it is to us now
[42:06] clearly the believer right because we
[42:08] believe every word of god clearly the
[42:10] believer will embrace trials as a part
[42:13] of their christian experience we often
[42:15] joke sometimes you know when you find a
[42:17] young believer that they are there and
[42:19] they think that once they've come to the
[42:21] lord that their troubles are over and
[42:24] you know you want to just go ahead and
[42:26] leave them alone and let that be
[42:28] expressed in their life because
[42:29] otherwise you'd be going ha are you
[42:31] kidding me you have just started in your
[42:34] test
[42:34] you know that would discourage them
[42:36] right there but as it is you see as god
[42:39] is pouring faith and life and virtue
[42:41] into this new believer he's also pouring
[42:45] in this ability to accept the trials
[42:47] that come in life and and so it's there
[42:50] how beautiful that is but we always want
[42:53] to remain in the position of the will of
[42:55] god and not to you know come and be that
[42:58] be that individual that looks them in
[43:00] the face and says you better buckle down
[43:02] because all hell's gonna break loose in
[43:04] your life you know that that's not what
[43:05] it's about but you see my brother and
[43:07] sister we often times look at these as
[43:10] trials of the flesh in other words i i i
[43:13] i just have to admit as much as uh i
[43:16] desire a deliverance from this you know
[43:19] you you find yourself going through life
[43:21] and there's certain little struggles and
[43:23] if we don't let the pressure off they
[43:25] tend to build up you know as the little
[43:27] things start to happen in your life and
[43:30] and we we somehow get you might say
[43:32] charged with the stress of of these
[43:36] trials or these things in our life and
[43:38] you know all of a sudden we come and and
[43:41] uh you know we get a little cranky and
[43:42] we get a little stressful and we get a
[43:44] little grumpy and and quick to respond
[43:47] and and you know it's not that you don't
[43:50] love that person you care about them but
[43:52] the problem is is we're letting the
[43:54] stress on the cares of this life build
[43:56] up without releasing amen that's why we
[43:58] have to let off the pressure that's why
[44:01] we have to give these things to the lord
[44:03] because if we take them as trials in the
[44:06] flesh then everyone associated with that
[44:10] trial becomes part of the problem and
[44:13] that's what the devil would like he'd
[44:14] like to make a husband a part of the
[44:16] problem a wife a part of the problem the
[44:18] children the part of the problem and
[44:20] wait kids i didn't forget you your
[44:21] parents are part of the problem so you
[44:24] look at this and realize that if we view
[44:26] these troubles in the flesh we will look
[44:29] for a fleshly answer to the trouble but
[44:32] when we will come and we look at this
[44:34] and and uh say well i know this appears
[44:37] to be a trial of the flesh my husband
[44:40] came home from work and you know
[44:42] practically slammed the door i greeted
[44:44] him he grunted and walked off why my
[44:47] heap oh this and that and pretty soon
[44:49] the whole family reflects whatever but
[44:52] you know there's a nice story lovely
[44:54] little story about a man he had a lot of
[44:55] troubles and and uh you know this man
[44:58] noticed that every day when this man
[44:59] come home from work he stopped at this
[45:01] little tree and made the motions of
[45:04] hanging something in the tree and this
[45:07] individual asks him it says what are
[45:09] what are you doing he said well my
[45:11] family are not part of the problems i
[45:14] have at work and so i'm hanging my
[45:17] problems of work on the limb right here
[45:20] i'll pick it up in the morning when i go
[45:22] to work
[45:23] now he'd be doing much better if he
[45:25] could just leave it there and never pick
[45:27] it up again but at least he didn't take
[45:29] it in the door and subject the house
[45:32] to the troubles of work and so you know
[45:35] when we see these trials of the flesh or
[45:37] let me say this
[45:40] they seem to be
[45:42] trials of our flesh
[45:46] but really they're trials of our faith
[45:50] you see satan will disrupt
[45:52] he is a disrupter
[45:54] you know we have we have new titles that
[45:57] are coming out into our language and and
[46:00] uh you know things we never thought
[46:01] about before and you know you'll have
[46:04] people on social media and uh they
[46:06] become popular uh you know in some cases
[46:09] it's just because of personality maybe
[46:12] it's a subject matter they become
[46:14] popular and they have termed them to be
[46:16] influencers
[46:18] and so you know the world we live in
[46:19] today it's kind of scary you know i
[46:21] follow a couple couple interesting
[46:24] characters in the farm world on youtube
[46:26] and it's fun to see how they farm in the
[46:29] midwest and and whatnot and their
[46:31] influencers but it makes me sad when i
[46:33] figured out the man makes a couple
[46:35] hundred thousand a year talking to a a
[46:37] uh um
[46:39] a gopro
[46:40] and uh
[46:43] i i just like that's not fair
[46:46] that's not right
[46:48] that he can just talk to this thing and
[46:50] and people
[46:52] you know
[46:53] well people like myself
[46:57] watch him and then because i'm watching
[46:59] him something goes click somewhere and
[47:02] in the world everybody says we want to
[47:03] be on his little thing there and
[47:05] advertise because people are going to
[47:06] see our ads and they send him
[47:08] checks all because i was curious of what
[47:11] happens on a farm in minnesota
[47:15] but there's also a new term being
[47:16] brought in that's really actually
[47:19] an old term and so is influencer in
[47:21] reality
[47:23] disruptors
[47:26] and so in our society while we have a
[47:28] great preponderance to follow or look at
[47:31] the influencers
[47:33] we also find there's a negative out
[47:36] there where people like to follow the
[47:39] disrupters
[47:41] satan's the original disrupter and my
[47:44] when people get engrossed in following a
[47:46] disrupter it kind of makes you wonder if
[47:49] satan hasn't just tricked them into a
[47:51] spirit of instead of building up see now
[47:54] listen saints we can all get caught by
[47:56] that
[47:58] and find that when we should be lifting
[48:00] up we're pushing back or down
[48:02] but look at this now
[48:04] see these things are trials of our faith
[48:07] even though we don't really recognize it
[48:09] as a trial of our faith at that time but
[48:12] it truly is now example is is job and
[48:16] we'll look right here in this quote
[48:19] now remember when god has counted you
[48:21] worthy
[54:28] i'll catch you next time guys
[54:31] he told me
[54:32] my life has changed so radically
[54:35] okay
[54:37] but i love what he adds on the tail of
[54:39] this
[54:40] for the better
[54:43] what are we without discipline
[54:47] we're rebels
[54:49] we're rebels
[54:51] amen
[54:53] so you look at this now
[54:55] god given you a trial he's got
[54:56] confidence he don't have to baby you
[54:59] you're not
[55:00] a hotbed plant
[55:02] somebody lift a hand and say i'm not a
[55:04] hotbed plant
[55:05] you know
[55:06] i'm a real christian amen
[55:09] god giving you a test see what you'll do
[55:11] about it amen fiery trials why count it
[55:14] a joy it's more precious to you than
[55:15] gold and many times we hem and haw come
[55:19] on somebody say i do that
[55:21] oh well if i just well that well that's
[55:24] something god give you to overcome
[55:27] he knows you'll do it
[55:29] he's put his trust in you
[55:31] see i i love this because what it we see
[55:34] is a very thing that it is remember when
[55:37] you got saved
[55:39] we had all kinds of habits we had all
[55:41] kinds of things and some of them we
[55:44] deemed as not offensive
[55:47] but have you noticed as time has gone on
[55:50] that god has determined what's offensive
[55:53] and not and he's slowly taking these
[55:54] things out of our lives he doesn't come
[55:57] and say you know what if you don't get
[55:58] rid of that you're going to hell
[56:00] he just comes and just slowly removes
[56:03] these out of our life he just works on
[56:05] this to where we ourselves
[56:09] volunteer to give it up
[56:12] that's what i like
[56:14] amen sometimes it's cold turkey
[56:19] sometimes
[56:20] it's years
[56:21] that god slowly takes these things away
[56:25] from us
[56:26] now you look at that and i want to say
[56:28] today thank you lord
[56:31] for counting us worthy
[56:33] now i want to go into luke the first
[56:35] chapter in the 26th verse
[56:37] and
[56:38] i'm going to take a little direction
[56:40] change here and i just pray that you can
[56:42] follow me as we look at this so luke 1
[56:46] and 26 is speaking of mary and in the
[56:49] sixth month the angel gabriel was sent
[56:51] from god into the city of galilee named
[56:54] nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[56:57] whose name was joseph of the house of
[56:59] david and the virgin's name was mary and
[57:02] the angel came in unto her and said hail
[57:05] thou art
[57:08] despised
[57:13] highly favor
[57:17] now remember in scripture the woman
[57:20] speaks of
[57:21] the church
[57:23] which speaks of in the ultimate
[57:26] especially as we come in the book of
[57:27] revelation
[57:28] of the redeemed
[57:32] so here she is now the angel says to her
[57:35] thou art highly favored the lord is with
[57:38] thee blessed art thou among women and
[57:41] when she saw him
[57:43] she just being like you and i was
[57:46] trouble that is saying and cast in her
[57:48] mind what manner of salutation this
[57:51] should be
[57:52] what's going on here she had no
[57:54] benchmark or no reference point to go
[57:58] back and say oh yes i remember this
[58:00] happened to me before so in something
[58:02] entirely new now i want you to
[59:39] is is in his retirement speech one of
[59:42] his bosses says you know harvey has come
[59:46] to work every day for 32 years never
[59:49] missed a day now he wasn't always
[59:51] productive at work
[59:54] but he was here
[59:57] now what if that was said about us as
[59:59] christians going to church
[1:00:01] he was here every service but he wasn't
[1:00:04] always productive
[1:00:06] see that it's a compliment but not
[1:00:09] and so it's there that that we see now
[1:00:13] that she is stopped mary has stopped
[1:00:15] she's looking and pondering in her mind
[1:00:17] what manner is this salutation and the
[1:00:19] angel said unto here fear not mary
[1:00:22] for thou hast found favor
[1:00:25] with god
[1:00:26] and behold thou shalt conceive
[1:01:41] if we don't get something beyond what
[1:01:43] the man shares with us
[1:01:47] then we haven't really achieved the goal
[1:01:50] so she says you know how shall i know
[1:01:52] this not knowing a man
[1:01:53] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:01:56] see the perfect recipe for her is the
[1:01:58] perfect recipe for us in this day
[1:02:01] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:02:02] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:02:05] the power of the highest shall
[1:02:06] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[1:02:09] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:02:12] be called the son of god
[1:02:14] now my brother and sister some people
[1:02:15] struggle over this and and certainly we
[1:02:17] don't want them to but my brother and
[1:02:19] sister the very word of god has come
[1:02:21] today and if jesus christ the son of god
[1:02:24] is not birthed in you and i we are just
[1:02:28] church attenders
[1:02:29] we are just there which means we can be
[1:02:32] influencers or interrupters without ever
[1:02:35] being truly saved
[1:02:40] i tell you if we just grasp that today
[1:02:43] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[1:02:46] and the power of the highest shall
[1:02:48] overshadow thee
[1:02:49] i'm telling you you can't go to church
[1:02:51] for 32 years or go to work for 32 years
[1:02:54] without being influenced when the holy
[1:02:56] ghost has come down upon you when the
[1:02:58] spirit of god has come and taken up
[1:03:00] residence in the soul amen it is a
[1:03:03] life-changing event amen and some people
[1:03:06] struggle with the idea that god is in
[1:03:08] them i know some churches don't teach
[1:03:10] that but it's right here in this
[1:03:11] scripture and my brother and sister if
[1:03:14] god is in you and i amen we have got him
[1:03:18] amen almighty god you can speak it in
[1:03:21] these terms i've got the holy ghost or
[1:03:23] the holy ghost has got me but it's there
[1:03:25] you know it's not just some little
[1:03:27] tickle in your toes it's a life-changing
[1:03:30] event
[1:03:31] hallelujah
[1:03:33] and so it's there that is he tells her
[1:03:36] you know as born of thee shall be called
[1:03:38] the son of god and behold that cousin
[1:03:40] elizabeth she shall also conceive a son
[1:03:42] in her old age and this is the sixth
[1:03:44] month with her who was called barren
[1:03:48] i like verse 37 we ought to post it look
[1:03:51] at it every day for with god nothing
[1:03:54] nothing somebody say that with me
[1:03:56] nothing shall be impossible
[1:04:00] now look i know these are hearts and i
[1:04:01] say this with love so please don't don't
[1:04:03] get discouraged by this but if you don't
[1:04:06] believe
[1:04:09] that's scripture right there
[1:04:11] with god
[1:04:14] nothing shall be impossible
[1:04:17] please don't even call yourself
[1:04:18] christian
[1:04:20] you have to accept the fact that god is
[1:04:23] in control
[1:04:25] and if we can't accept the fact that
[1:04:27] god's in control my brother and sister
[1:04:29] even when god allowed the hedge to be
[1:04:32] opened with job god was in control
[1:04:36] as i've told you before you see when it
[1:04:38] was there job just living life it's good
[1:04:40] he's living a prosperous life a happy
[1:04:42] life and then all of a sudden everything
[1:04:44] starts falling apart and if job had
[1:04:46] known that god had opened the hedge it
[1:04:48] might have discouraged him so much but
[1:04:50] you see god opened the hedge but he put
[1:04:53] a hedge around satan
[1:04:55] and satan now can only go so far and do
[1:04:59] so much everything he's doing if i could
[1:05:01] just give it to you an example and we
[1:05:04] see this happen our sons do this our
[1:05:05] daughters do this in life you know and
[1:05:08] you've told them now this is how sonia
[1:05:10] you operate the lawnmower and you know
[1:05:12] the boy is out there pushing or riding
[1:05:15] the lawnmower and what does he keep
[1:05:16] doing he keeps looking back to dad or he
[1:05:18] maybe even mom you know looking for that
[1:05:21] approval am i doing this right am i
[1:05:22] doing this right you see and so it's
[1:05:25] there the devil now with the hedge
[1:05:27] around him has to keep looking over his
[1:05:30] shoulder to see how's god reacting to
[1:05:32] what i'm doing right now
[1:05:35] he's contained
[1:05:38] amen some people think the devil well
[1:05:41] they say well well paul the scripture
[1:05:43] says he's going to and fro like a
[1:05:45] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[1:05:48] just because he thinks he found someone
[1:05:50] to devour doesn't mean god opened the
[1:05:51] hedge to allow him to do it
[1:05:54] satan might identify you in your lowest
[1:05:56] moment
[1:06:00] have you ever noticed
[1:06:03] you ever notice husbands wives
[1:06:06] when there's friction between you
[1:06:09] things that would have never brought a
[1:06:11] reaction suddenly bring a reaction
[1:06:16] not even a hee-haw or
[1:06:19] yay or nay i must have hit close to home
[1:06:22] to you
[1:06:25] what happens is satan see
[1:06:27] he sees a weakness he sees something
[1:06:29] going on he sees a frustration maybe
[1:06:32] problems at work problems with a child
[1:06:34] whatever it might be and satan comes and
[1:06:36] becomes the irritant only he himself
[1:06:38] doesn't show up with pitchfork and horns
[1:06:40] to be the irritant he uses
[1:06:43] someone close to us or
[1:06:48] but last week when you were prayed up
[1:06:49] and you were on top of the mountain
[1:06:52] you'd have brushed that old devil off
[1:06:53] like nothing
[1:06:56] oh forgive me sisters
[1:06:59] you men
[1:07:01] sometimes you're just like well
[1:07:04] she's a woman
[1:07:06] unpredictable and cranky
[1:07:16] did you know when you say that it's
[1:07:18] usually you
[1:07:20] you thought all i was giving you men are
[1:07:22] pass
[1:07:25] but you see it's not because with the
[1:07:27] right spirit and the right attitude
[1:07:29] whatever friction was there is dealt
[1:07:30] with
[1:07:32] satan's pushed out but
[1:07:34] there's many a couple what started out
[1:07:36] as a simple thing
[1:07:38] led to divorce
[1:07:40] and you say how can that be because they
[1:07:42] let the irritation be the focus
[1:07:46] not reconciliation not finding out what
[1:07:48] and fixing it asking the lord to come in
[1:07:50] and move upon that but they started to
[1:07:52] focus focus on the irritation and you
[1:07:55] see that's what the devil's trying to do
[1:07:56] in all of these things of life he's
[1:07:58] trying to you know in your christian
[1:07:59] walk maybe you get sick and you're
[1:08:01] struggling you're in and out of the
[1:08:02] doctor's office at the hospital or many
[1:08:05] other examples could be used and after a
[1:08:08] while we say god's not a healer but i'm
[1:08:09] telling you my brother and sister my
[1:08:11] bible says he's a healer
[1:08:13] i don't care what some counsel of men
[1:08:15] have decided that that's for days gone
[1:08:17] by there was no expiration date put in
[1:08:21] the bible on the fact our god is a
[1:08:23] healer
[1:08:24] amen so people want to say well that
[1:08:26] applied to another day did it really
[1:08:29] show me the expiration date show me when
[1:08:32] god took it out
[1:08:34] we clearly know when he put it in but
[1:08:36] when did he take it out see that's the
[1:08:38] devil being the irritant to get you to
[1:08:41] look at something beside the word
[1:08:44] amen now look i've got to hurry up
[1:08:47] we got visitors this morning they'll
[1:08:48] never forgive me if i keep them too long
[1:08:52] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[1:08:55] i love this verse 38
[1:08:58] mary's got a response you've got a
[1:09:00] response
[1:09:01] my brother and sister whatever is
[1:09:02] happening in your life you have a
[1:09:04] response it might be an angry response
[1:09:07] it might be a disappointed response it
[1:09:09] might be a critical response but we have
[1:09:12] a response oh god help us to put the
[1:09:16] right atmosphere and nature into our
[1:09:19] response
[1:09:20] and here is mary she's looking at
[1:09:22] something she's just now been you might
[1:09:25] say just blasted
[1:09:27] bombarded with this i'm gonna have a
[1:09:29] child
[1:09:32] i've never known a man and the angel
[1:09:34] says this child is going to be of the
[1:09:37] holy ghost
[1:09:39] i can see her go over there maybe grab
[1:09:42] her bible i mean we know it wasn't such
[1:09:44] in that day or at least we think we
[1:09:46] don't know or do know she didn't have an
[1:09:48] ipad
[1:09:50] siri
[1:09:51] has this ever happened before
[1:10:00] oh oh the bible says they'd come as
[1:10:02] angels the light i'm dismissing you
[1:10:04] she had that option
[1:10:08] but something down in her soul
[1:10:11] now let's tie this together
[1:10:14] let's tie this together her
[1:10:16] and joseph they're in spouse right
[1:10:18] they're engaged they did almost
[1:10:19] everything together joseph's building
[1:10:21] the house and they're doing this and
[1:10:22] doing that and maybe they were talking
[1:10:24] about the word of god
[1:10:26] maybe they were there in isaiah
[1:10:30] and it says you know what someday
[1:10:33] a virgin
[1:10:34] shall conceive
[1:10:36] and she turned to joseph and say
[1:10:38] this is strange how can this be
[1:10:41] joseph say i don't know i can't really
[1:10:43] explain it but it's in the scripture the
[1:10:45] prophet isaiah a tried and true proven
[1:10:48] prophet of god whose word has not failed
[1:10:51] he's vindicated said this would come to
[1:10:53] pass so you know what there is someday
[1:10:55] on the earth going to be a young woman
[1:10:59] who is going to have a child and his
[1:11:01] name shall be called jesus and he will
[1:11:04] be the prince of peace he will be the
[1:11:07] highest of the highest and the most
[1:11:09] glorified of all and this young woman
[1:11:12] will be the recipient of that anointing
[1:11:14] to have that child and now i can see it
[1:11:17] now saint because mary had a voice and
[1:11:19] she was a true believer she says you
[1:11:21] know what oh god could someone like me
[1:11:27] be
[1:11:29] maybe she felt a little something stir
[1:11:31] inside of her
[1:11:33] now she's standing there
[1:11:36] you see god never sends us into
[1:11:38] something without giving us preparation
[1:11:41] now whether preparation come
[1:11:45] and we didn't pay attention
[1:11:47] you know
[1:11:49] circa 8th grade
[1:11:52] teachers at the chalkboard
[1:11:54] next day pop quiz now what was that i
[1:11:57] put on the chalkboard
[1:12:00] i don't know but
[1:12:02] tarzan sure whipped up on that lion and
[1:12:04] then
[1:12:05] wrestled the python and i have no clue
[1:12:08] what she wrote on the board
[1:12:11] we don't always pay attention can
[1:12:13] someone say i i i know
[1:12:16] we don't always pay attention what the
[1:12:17] word's doing but see something in mary
[1:12:20] had responded and when now gabriel is
[1:12:23] speaking to her and says this will be of
[1:12:26] the holy ghost and she is there and she
[1:12:29] doesn't say now give me time to research
[1:12:31] this i need to go talk to the priest i
[1:12:33] need to go over here i want to go to the
[1:12:35] library
[1:12:36] but what is it something anointed her
[1:12:38] and she says behold now what is she
[1:12:41] doing she's giving her identification
[1:12:43] first
[1:12:44] right she's identifying she's speaking
[1:12:47] it out because you will obey your
[1:12:49] confession
[1:12:51] if you say i'm not i'm not much of a
[1:12:53] christian god wouldn't do this for me
[1:12:54] hey you're setting yourself up how about
[1:12:56] just speaking the words i am a son of
[1:12:58] god i'm a daughter of god i'll serve god
[1:13:01] all the days of my life and he promised
[1:13:03] that he would lead me and guide me to
[1:13:05] all truth so therefore i'm just going to
[1:13:07] believe it
[1:13:09] and what does she say
[1:13:10] behold
[1:13:12] i'm a handmaid
[1:13:14] behold the handmaid of the lord
[1:13:17] now look at this i'm not very good with
[1:13:19] this english amen i tell you you know
[1:13:21] you're not doing well when your teacher
[1:13:22] says i'm going to pass you because i
[1:13:24] don't want to deal with you again
[1:13:26] but you look at this now
[1:13:28] this semicolon or is that a colon
[1:13:32] semi that's what i thought
[1:13:36] you know what a semi is
[1:13:39] something large that carries a lot of
[1:13:42] faith
[1:13:44] with it
[1:13:46] not two wheels not four wheels
[1:13:49] but eighteen
[1:13:51] oh hallelujah
[1:13:55] behold the handmaid of the lord
[1:13:59] be it
[1:14:00] unto me amen
[1:14:05] oh if we could just catch this
[1:14:06] revelation that it was on mary
[1:14:09] be it unto me
[1:14:11] according to thy word not my word not my
[1:14:15] thoughts not my theological
[1:14:17] understanding not what i learned in
[1:14:18] school but according to thy word let it
[1:14:21] be unto me
[1:14:24] oh hallelujah
[1:14:25] now see at that point right there
[1:14:27] because of her confession the angel
[1:14:30] you might could say he was successful in
[1:14:33] his mission and he didn't have to give
[1:14:35] her a whole bunch of coaching
[1:14:36] he didn't have to give her a whole bunch
[1:14:38] of reference points
[1:14:39] he didn't have to tell her to do this do
[1:14:41] that when she made that confession
[1:14:44] the angel departed
[1:14:47] now it didn't depart from her presence
[1:14:49] as it were like in a complete leaving
[1:14:52] but he didn't have to go she's already
[1:14:54] said i'll take that amen how about when
[1:14:57] we're in church and we can lift a hand
[1:14:58] or say amen to the word of god what are
[1:15:01] we telling god i accept that i claim a
[1:15:04] portion of that right there it's mine
[1:15:07] and sometimes it's
[1:15:09] quite incredible
[1:15:11] sometimes it's almost overwhelming
[1:15:14] but now you don't see mary going away
[1:15:17] from there saying
[1:15:18] well i i
[1:15:20] i'm gonna back up on this i don't know
[1:15:22] that was just you know under the uh
[1:15:25] emotion at the time
[1:15:27] you know i went to church with a friend
[1:15:28] and
[1:15:29] the preacher was preaching and something
[1:15:31] stirred in my heart and and i said lord
[1:15:33] i want to serve you forgive me of my
[1:15:35] sins and
[1:15:36] and then you go to work or school and
[1:15:39] you tell people i got saved over the
[1:15:41] weekend and they look at you in such a
[1:15:43] way and they act so awkward about this
[1:15:45] and then you start to back up
[1:15:49] but when someone says you know what
[1:15:53] from the depths of my heart
[1:15:55] be it unto me
[1:15:57] be it unto me i want to be a christian
[1:15:59] that's that's the life i will live
[1:16:02] now we'll get to this if i'll just hurry
[1:16:03] along here
[1:16:06] isn't this interesting you see god knew
[1:16:07] who he'd called
[1:16:10] now strangely enough my brother and
[1:16:12] sister
[1:16:14] i'll put this just as consideration
[1:16:18] there might well have been a girl down
[1:16:20] the street
[1:16:21] that lived just as godly life
[1:16:24] as mary
[1:16:26] that's why we never look over and say
[1:16:28] i'm just as good a christian as you
[1:16:29] brother jason i'm just as good a
[1:16:31] christian as you i'm just as good a
[1:16:33] christian as you you're not measuring
[1:16:34] yourself against that we're measuring to
[1:16:36] the word
[1:16:38] amen
[1:16:40] so it was god choosing who god wanted to
[1:16:42] choose right
[1:16:44] so
[1:16:45] it's there
[1:16:46] that he knew who he'd called and i want
[1:16:48] to say that he know who's called today
[1:16:51] my brother and sister when god come down
[1:16:52] and started stirring your heart amen he
[1:16:54] knew who he called he didn't make a
[1:16:56] mistake he's not like cupid we've all
[1:16:58] seen the cartoons you know where the
[1:17:00] couple's sitting on the park bench and
[1:17:02] cupid shoots and the arrow flies over
[1:17:04] and hits some old man on the swing set
[1:17:06] and he's over there smiling at this
[1:17:08] young woman no it don't work that way
[1:17:11] god knows who he has called and has
[1:17:13] provided the way for them to come into
[1:17:16] the calling
[1:17:18] now look my brother and sister this is a
[1:17:20] side we don't usually preach about mary
[1:17:22] and i hope this doesn't disrupt any
[1:17:24] thoughts you have here but look
[1:17:27] at what happened to mary
[1:17:29] after that
[1:17:31] she's just experienced a supernatural
[1:17:34] event
[1:17:41] then she goes to the market one day
[1:17:48] look at mary
[1:17:51] she's got a baby bump
[1:17:54] and she's not even married
[1:18:00] scratch her name
[1:18:01] off the tea party
[1:18:04] scratch her name out of the church
[1:18:06] social
[1:18:09] we always thought mary i hope this isn't
[1:18:11] too straight
[1:18:12] we always thought mary was a good girl
[1:18:16] but it's obvious
[1:18:18] it's either joseph or someone else
[1:18:22] oh my goodness
[1:18:23] but you know it's the spirit of the day
[1:18:25] it's just the way things go and mary's
[1:18:27] have come to it and and so while we
[1:18:29] thought she was this righteous holy
[1:18:30] little girl and she acts like a
[1:18:32] righteous holy little girl we now
[1:18:34] know better
[1:18:39] and as the baby bump
[1:18:41] got bigger
[1:18:43] mary was marked
[1:18:44] everywhere she went
[1:18:46] that's right
[1:18:48] pretty soon she wasn't even welcome in
[1:18:50] the market and she wasn't welcome in the
[1:18:51] square and she certainly wasn't welcome
[1:18:53] in our church
[1:18:57] you see there's a price
[1:19:01] make me cry
[1:19:03] there was a price
[1:19:05] that mary had to pay
[1:19:09] to bear jesus christ
[1:19:11] in her flesh
[1:19:14] this world we live in where everyone can
[1:19:16] behave any old way and say there's a
[1:19:18] christian something's wrong saints there
[1:19:21] is a price to be paid a reproach to be
[1:19:24] born to carry jesus christ in our flesh
[1:19:29] and look at mary now she's going on and
[1:19:31] on on and on and on and on
[1:19:34] now
[1:19:35] she gets married
[1:19:38] and we're not going to go into the whole
[1:19:40] you know
[1:19:41] story as it is
[1:19:43] but
[1:19:46] it's
[1:19:47] not a bed of roses
[1:19:50] she's just been visited by an angel
[1:19:51] saints
[1:19:52] pardon me for putting this way she's not
[1:19:54] been slipping out a bedroom window and
[1:19:56] running the streets she has been living
[1:19:59] a holy life and because god found favor
[1:20:03] she found favor in god's eyes my brother
[1:20:05] and sister she now has a reproach that
[1:20:08] she never
[1:20:09] never
[1:20:10] escaped
[1:20:12] her whole life
[1:20:14] she never escaped
[1:20:16] this reproach
[1:20:21] a lifelong mark
[1:20:24] i want to ask you a question
[1:20:26] would it have been easy
[1:20:28] to have been married
[1:20:34] brother timothy sean put it this way
[1:20:36] quit your whining and crying god called
[1:20:38] you just stand up and do what he called
[1:20:40] you to do
[1:20:42] don't don't be taking this position over
[1:20:44] one to me i'm a christian and that you
[1:20:46] know i'm like no come on
[1:20:48] come on if god marked you stand up and
[1:20:51] say thank you lord for marking me
[1:20:53] hallelujah
[1:20:54] see her hearts cry behold the handmaid
[1:20:57] of the lord be it unto me according to
[1:20:58] thy word what did that do it set a
[1:21:00] direction in her life
[1:21:04] now that doesn't mean she wasn't in the
[1:21:05] flesh and i'll just deviate just this
[1:21:07] little point
[1:21:10] she did things that confused the mind of
[1:21:12] people or
[1:21:14] reinforce the minds of some
[1:21:17] when she sees him
[1:21:21] your father and i
[1:21:24] we've been seeking you with
[1:21:26] tears people are like i knew it
[1:21:30] i knew it she said it was some
[1:21:31] supernatural event she said whoa come on
[1:21:34] she said she had the holy ghost and god
[1:21:36] changed her life but it sure sounds like
[1:21:38] it's just like all the rest of us now
[1:21:45] hallelujah
[1:21:49] now let's turn in romans the third
[1:21:51] chapter i need to hurry right along here
[1:21:53] today
[1:21:55] oh
[1:21:57] too far too fast paul
[1:21:59] romans 3 1
[1:22:01] what advantage then hath the jew or what
[1:22:03] prophet is there of circumcision
[1:22:07] now you see some people want to question
[1:22:09] these things my brother and sister they
[1:22:10] they want to take it as oh you know i
[1:22:12] don't know i was just watching a little
[1:22:14] deal this young man claimed to be a
[1:22:16] christian he's talking to this guy doing
[1:22:18] street evangelism and he said now you
[1:22:21] know
[1:22:22] what if the language that this was uh
[1:22:25] interpreted or translated from
[1:22:28] was not what we thought it was what if
[1:22:30] it's this over there it would change the
[1:22:32] meaning of these scriptures to this here
[1:22:34] instead of this here and so therefore if
[1:22:36] it changed it to that then we could be
[1:22:39] wrong
[1:22:43] what if you get struck by lightning
[1:22:47] when you walk out of church today
[1:22:50] what if you know i joked the other day
[1:22:52] what if
[1:22:53] you win the lottery
[1:22:57] well unless it lands
[1:23:00] on your windshield and sticks to your
[1:23:01] windshield wiper the odds are pretty
[1:23:03] small as a christian
[1:23:06] and even then
[1:23:08] you probably have to go search for the
[1:23:10] rightful owner knowing it wasn't really
[1:23:12] yours
[1:23:18] he says much every way
[1:23:20] so it it does for the jew it matters
[1:23:24] right so the scripture clearly stated as
[1:23:26] gentiles we were not held into that same
[1:23:29] category as the jews and he says much
[1:23:31] every way chiefly because then unto them
[1:23:34] are committed to the oracles of god so
[1:23:36] for the word for their day they were
[1:23:38] obedient
[1:23:41] and god says but you gentiles i have
[1:23:42] another covenant for you i have another
[1:23:44] way i want you to come and then it says
[1:23:47] now for what if some did not believe
[1:23:50] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[1:23:53] god without effect
[1:23:56] see this is the thing my brother and
[1:23:57] sister starting with our children we
[1:23:59] need to get them grounded in the gospel
[1:24:02] that when they get to school and some
[1:24:04] child tells your child that my daddy
[1:24:06] says and my daddy's been to college my
[1:24:08] daddy says that that's just a book of
[1:24:10] stories and it doesn't matter and if
[1:24:13] your child doesn't have a grounding he's
[1:24:15] going to be looking at that and saying
[1:24:16] oh okay so i it doesn't mean that i
[1:24:20] can't lie doesn't mean i can't steal
[1:24:22] doesn't mean i can't covet
[1:24:24] because just a book
[1:24:27] and if that seed ever gets implanted in
[1:24:28] there you have to root up half the
[1:24:30] garden to get rid of it
[1:24:32] that's how deep it gets
[1:24:36] for what if some did not believe shall
[1:24:38] their unbelief make the faith of god
[1:24:39] without effect god forbid yea let god be
[1:24:43] true but every man a liar as it is
[1:24:45] written thou that thou mightest be
[1:24:48] justified in thy sayings and mightest
[1:24:50] overcome when thou art judged now i want
[1:24:52] to take this my brother and sister and
[1:24:54] tie this right back whatever your
[1:24:56] confession is
[1:24:59] that thou mightest be justified in thy
[1:25:02] sayings
[1:25:03] it doesn't matter what kind of priest
[1:25:05] said
[1:25:07] doesn't matter but doctor whatever on
[1:25:09] the radio says or the guy that has you
[1:25:11] know 50 000 people come to church on
[1:25:13] sunday in his football coliseum
[1:25:15] it doesn't matter what they say
[1:25:18] what are you saying
[1:25:19] what are you saying
[1:25:23] so you look at that now now there's a
[1:25:26] key in here that i want to expound on
[1:25:28] for just a moment
[1:25:30] and that is right there in verse 3.
[1:25:33] what if
[1:25:39] you know you don't think about things
[1:25:42] in certain fashions sometimes people
[1:25:44] help you to think about them
[1:25:46] visitor we had said i so enjoyed the
[1:25:48] service
[1:25:50] i didn't have to sit in the dark and
[1:25:51] feel like a mushroom the whole church
[1:25:53] service
[1:25:55] but some are attracted to that
[1:25:59] some are not
[1:26:01] what if
[1:26:06] what if it was easy as saying i'm a
[1:26:08] christian and nothing more was required
[1:26:10] then most of the world
[1:26:12] would be saved
[1:26:16] what if
[1:26:18] let's go to romans 9. i haven't lost you
[1:26:20] yet have i
[1:26:21] we have just a few short more minutes
[1:26:24] amen
[1:26:25] not even a reply come on
[1:26:27] somebody say amen paul
[1:26:30] [Laughter]
[1:26:33] both of these are in romans so it's a
[1:26:35] very easy context to follow
[1:26:37] for he saith moses i will have mercy on
[1:26:40] whom i will have mercy
[1:26:42] wow you mean i i don't have anything to
[1:26:44] do with that
[1:26:46] now we'll have compassion on whom i will
[1:26:48] have compassion so then it is not of him
[1:26:51] that willeth
[1:26:53] come on a lot of people willeth
[1:26:56] a lot of people willeth my brother and
[1:26:57] sister nor of him that runeth
[1:27:00] but of god that showeth mercy
[1:27:03] oh my i'll tell you what
[1:27:07] ah we want to go into i got a few
[1:27:08] examples that fit perfect but
[1:27:11] for the scriptures saith unto pharaoh
[1:27:13] even for this same purpose if i raise
[1:27:15] thee up
[1:27:19] seems
[1:27:20] strange god would
[1:27:22] allow a man to rise
[1:27:25] to the leadership highest leadership of
[1:27:27] a kingdom
[1:27:30] for a simple purpose
[1:27:33] for simple purpose is that
[1:27:36] but remember
[1:27:38] with god all things are possible
[1:27:40] god does what god wants to do
[1:27:44] purpose i've raised the up that i might
[1:27:45] show my power in thee that my name might
[1:27:48] be declared throughout all the earth
[1:27:50] therefore hath he mercy on whom he will
[1:27:52] have mercy and whom he will
[1:27:55] and whom he will he hardeneth
[1:27:58] thou will say then unto me what does he
[1:28:01] yet find fault
[1:28:03] for who hath resisted his will nay but o
[1:28:06] man who art thou that replies against
[1:28:10] god
[1:28:11] now look at the world we live in saints
[1:28:13] these scriptures are going to come to
[1:28:15] pass whether people get excited about it
[1:28:17] or not we have a whole generation of
[1:28:20] people rising up that will curse god
[1:28:23] willingly and with force
[1:28:27] so it tells you right here what it is
[1:28:30] who art thou the replest against god
[1:28:32] shall the thing formed say to him that
[1:28:34] formed it why hast thou made me thus
[1:28:38] hath not the potter power over the clay
[1:28:40] of the same lump to make one vessel into
[1:28:42] honor and another unto dishonor
[1:28:46] what if
[1:28:50] what if god
[1:28:51] willing to show his wrath and to make
[1:28:53] his power known
[1:28:55] endureth with much long suffering the
[1:28:57] vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
[1:29:01] so those people
[1:29:02] who don't even care about god he still
[1:29:04] has long suffering with him
[1:29:08] and that he might make known the riches
[1:29:10] of his glory on the vessels of mercy
[1:29:18] come on saints
[1:29:19] god wants to make known his riches on
[1:29:21] you
[1:29:22] he wants to pour out blessings on you he
[1:29:24] he wants you oh no this is not the name
[1:29:27] claim it thing that people get nervous
[1:29:29] about oh he's preaching prosperity
[1:29:31] actually i am prosper preaching
[1:29:32] prosperity
[1:29:34] yes sir
[1:29:35] may you be rich in the things of god and
[1:29:38] if money happens to come your way then
[1:29:40] you will be led of the holy ghost on
[1:29:42] what to do with your money and you will
[1:29:44] be counted as a good steward in the day
[1:29:46] of judgment
[1:29:48] but this idea that god wants to just
[1:29:50] give me millions so i can live some
[1:29:52] borderline life my brother and sister
[1:29:54] that's utter nonsense it's a twisting of
[1:29:56] the scripture because the very nature of
[1:29:59] a real christian is to do the will of
[1:30:02] god
[1:30:03] and the scripture says if a man doesn't
[1:30:05] work he doesn't eat oh boy
[1:30:08] that's going to be rough on some people
[1:30:14] might make known the riches of his glory
[1:30:17] on the vessels of mercy which he hath
[1:30:19] before prepared unto glory even us
[1:30:23] don't you love how he identified who it
[1:30:25] was we're not talking about somebody out
[1:30:26] here that nobody even knows of he's
[1:30:28] talking even us
[1:30:30] whom he hath called not of the jews only
[1:30:32] but also of the gentiles as he saith
[1:30:35] also in osea i will call them my people
[1:30:39] which were not my people and her beloved
[1:30:42] which was not beloved and it shall come
[1:30:45] to pass that in the place where it was
[1:30:47] said of them ye are not my people there
[1:30:50] shall they be called the children of the
[1:30:53] living god
[1:30:54] hallelujah what a position to be moved
[1:30:57] into to be called the children of the
[1:30:59] living god hallelujah you're not going
[1:31:02] to know that i'm a christian because of
[1:31:03] the value of the house i live in or the
[1:31:06] car i drive or the quality of my clothes
[1:31:09] but of the nature of christ that is
[1:31:12] coming forth out of us that will be the
[1:31:15] testament of whether we are the sons and
[1:31:17] daughters of god that the scripture is
[1:31:19] talking about
[1:31:21] oh so much emphasis has been placed oh
[1:31:23] look god's blessing me well my brother
[1:31:25] and sister i can go today and introduce
[1:31:27] you to a man that's worth millions upon
[1:31:30] millions of dollars and would curse you
[1:31:32] and god in one breath
[1:31:38] and then we got people saying oh see i
[1:31:40] got proof i got proof
[1:31:42] god's blessed me i prayed for money
[1:31:46] well
[1:31:48] oh let's not go there
[1:31:51] that just gets complicated
[1:31:55] look at this now we'll close out right
[1:31:57] here on these thoughts
[1:32:00] remember israel the borderlines when god
[1:32:02] gave them a promise over in the holy
[1:32:04] land
[1:32:06] in the land it was good of milk and
[1:32:08] honey
[1:32:10] right so this is the promise that god
[1:32:11] gave them
[1:32:13] a land of milk and honey
[1:32:15] moses sent out caleb and joshua and the
[1:32:18] spies to go over and spy out the land
[1:32:19] and brought back the vindicated evidence
[1:32:22] the ten of them said we cannot do it
[1:32:25] we're unable
[1:32:26] look at the difficult there
[1:32:29] we'd be fanatics we got these little
[1:32:31] bitty things to fight with look what
[1:32:32] they got
[1:32:33] we can't do it we're not able to do it
[1:32:43] hallelujah
[1:32:48] hope this doesn't shock you
[1:32:51] mary didn't run home make love to joseph
[1:32:55] to make sure
[1:32:57] that come to pass
[1:33:01] she stood
[1:33:02] on the angel's words
[1:33:05] she had declared yea and amen to it
[1:33:08] and said that word be it unto me
[1:33:13] in that point right there she received
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:21] i sure hope we've kicked them other ten
[1:33:23] spies out of the church
[1:33:26] i sure hope that we have blacklisted
[1:33:28] them and put them on you know blocked
[1:33:31] call
[1:33:33] remove their name off their social
[1:33:36] media
[1:33:38] because you see what they got right
[1:33:40] there is a bunch of people that says we
[1:33:42] can't do it now this was just a parable
[1:33:45] this scripture was talking about this is
[1:33:46] just a storyline this was just something
[1:33:49] to incite you to be good people
[1:33:53] no my brother and sister
[1:33:55] this was a promise of god
[1:33:57] he declared it and said i'm going to
[1:33:59] send you or take you to a land flowing
[1:34:03] with milk and honey
[1:34:05] my this might be representative of what
[1:34:07] will happen in the end of time here that
[1:34:09] we'll have a you know i'm not saying
[1:34:11] this is so don't misunderstand me but
[1:34:13] look at this we got 10
[1:34:15] or it would be 5 to 1 wouldn't it
[1:34:17] it'd be five to one for every five
[1:34:19] negative preachers
[1:34:21] it'd be a positive one
[1:34:25] but it didn't matter that there was ten
[1:34:28] that said we can't do it
[1:34:30] god said now let's just take the little
[1:34:33] scale here
[1:34:34] and we're going to put all of our words
[1:34:37] and all of our deeds on this side and
[1:34:39] we're going to put god said on this side
[1:34:42] and let's see what happens on that scale
[1:34:44] amen the reason is people have become
[1:34:47] now i've said this before and i say this
[1:34:48] again it's very interesting day we live
[1:34:50] in that people are explaining god who
[1:34:52] can't even explain themselves
[1:34:56] well god meant and god this and god that
[1:34:58] they can't even explain themselves
[1:35:02] but you see joshua and caleb said we're
[1:35:04] more than able to do it why because they
[1:35:05] believe this bible just like mary
[1:35:08] believed they believed and took it down
[1:35:11] in the heart and said there's no giant
[1:35:14] too big there's no land too large
[1:35:16] there's no circumstance beyond our
[1:35:18] abilities god said it we're going to
[1:35:21] take this land we're going to possess it
[1:35:23] hallelujah a lot of what ifs my brother
[1:35:25] and sister what was mary's simple
[1:35:28] question
[1:35:30] she didn't say why this and that and
[1:35:31] whatever but she
[1:35:33] remember now
[1:35:34] it's okay
[1:35:36] to ask god a question
[1:35:40] don't question god
[1:35:43] too many people question god
[1:35:46] how are you going to make this happen
[1:35:47] what are you going to do here
[1:35:49] god doesn't mind if you as a believer
[1:35:52] say lord
[1:35:54] from my heart what do i do and
[1:35:57] where do i go and
[1:35:59] how will these things happen in my life
[1:36:04] look through your bible
[1:36:06] i should tally it
[1:36:07] i don't have quite that much time
[1:36:09] but over and over again through the
[1:36:11] bible there's been those who ask god a
[1:36:14] question
[1:36:15] but never question god
[1:36:18] mary would be one of those so we've got
[1:36:20] number one on the list
[1:36:23] amen how will this happen mary's simple
[1:36:25] question
[1:36:27] the holy ghost
[1:36:30] the holy ghost shall come upon you
[1:36:33] your question today
[1:36:34] be brother paul how things troubles in
[1:36:37] our life
[1:36:38] in the workplace and barely making the
[1:36:40] mortgage and bury this and barely that
[1:36:42] and troubles and questions in
[1:36:45] how do we
[1:36:47] let the holy ghost come upon you
[1:36:50] let god come in and take charge and
[1:36:53] bring it to pass without you
[1:36:55] trying to make it happen
[1:36:57] amen so just as it was to mary the holy
[1:37:00] ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[1:37:02] of the highest shall overcome overshadow
[1:37:04] thee amen that's what we want my brother
[1:37:07] and sister to come to the place that we
[1:37:10] can say be it unto me
[1:37:12] according to thy word
[1:37:15] amen
[1:37:16] will the musicians come
[1:37:18] i i believe this as i read this
[1:37:21] we're in bible days again
[1:37:24] if there was ever another book of acts
[1:37:25] written would our name be in it
[1:37:28] and if our name would be in it where
[1:37:30] would we be in it
[1:37:32] would be amongst the believer
[1:37:34] make believer the unbeliever the
[1:37:36] doubtful the questioners
[1:37:39] when people say well i just have a real
[1:37:41] struggle had a gentleman tell me this i
[1:37:42] have a real struggle having blind faith
[1:37:45] just believing something i have no
[1:37:47] evidence of
[1:37:51] hallelujah
[1:37:52] well
[1:37:54] i got a a lot of a lot of things i could
[1:37:56] say about that
[1:37:58] anybody want to sit around here my
[1:37:59] opinion
[1:38:01] oh not much of a response there
[1:38:03] but i'll tell you what it is there's a
[1:38:04] lot of things in this life
[1:38:06] that we have blind faith to
[1:38:12] a lot of things in this life
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:18] if we would trust
[1:38:22] i'll give you one that i i find kind of
[1:38:25] humorous
[1:38:27] the advent of the automobile
[1:38:31] the originally determined it went over
[1:38:33] 18 miles an hour it would leave the
[1:38:34] earth
[1:38:36] then they raised that number to the low
[1:38:38] 30s and then they raised it to 40 and
[1:38:40] then they absolutely declared when it
[1:38:42] got somewhere around the 50 something
[1:38:44] mile an hour a car would just shoot off
[1:38:46] the face of the earth
[1:38:50] and yet many of you this morning
[1:38:52] depending on where you live in the city
[1:38:53] or out
[1:38:55] drove here
[1:38:56] 40 50
[1:38:58] 60.
[1:38:59] some of you probably even drove faster
[1:39:01] than that because you were late
[1:39:03] but
[1:39:05] you have blind faith in that
[1:39:08] you think nothing of getting in your car
[1:39:11] and you say but it's not blind i believe
[1:39:13] in gravity but what turns gravity on and
[1:39:15] off
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:20] my god
[1:39:21] made heaven and earth
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:24] gravity
[1:39:25] is his creation
[1:39:27] and if god decided well gravity's been
[1:39:30] around long enough click
[1:39:32] what would happen
[1:39:35] but you have faith in that
[1:39:40] that's a very silly example but i want
[1:39:42] to keep it simple for you
[1:39:44] my brothers and sisters
[1:39:46] today
[1:39:48] let's have mary's kind of faith
[1:39:51] let's simply hear the word of god
[1:39:54] and say
[1:39:55] be it unto me
[1:39:57] according to thy word
[1:39:59] let us just read our bible
[1:40:02] yes there's things in the bible you know
[1:40:05] i'm sorry i have all these gentlemen
[1:40:06] told me type things but i i try to keep
[1:40:10] in contact with those around me
[1:40:13] had a gentleman tell me says well
[1:40:16] i picked up my bible he said i i was
[1:40:18] encouraged by a relative to read the
[1:40:19] book of revelation
[1:40:21] and he said i started reading the book
[1:40:23] of revelation and he said i i didn't
[1:40:25] make one drop of sense i just quit
[1:40:29] how do you understand this
[1:40:30] [Music]
[1:40:34] you pray over it
[1:40:36] lord give me revelation i want to
[1:40:38] understand your word
[1:40:41] i don't want to look at it become
[1:40:42] confused and put it down i want to
[1:40:46] understand it because this is the book
[1:40:48] of the revelation of jesus christ and so
[1:40:52] there approach that and say lord i want
[1:40:54] to know you
[1:40:56] look think about it
[1:40:58] husbands wives maybe young people with
[1:41:01] these thoughts in mind
[1:41:02] you can't just walk out on the street
[1:41:04] and tell a girl i'm marrying you
[1:41:07] it might work occasionally
[1:41:10] i know a few people it worked with
[1:41:13] what do we do we get to know them
[1:41:17] and as we get to know them
[1:41:19] look
[1:41:20] all the ladies on the face of the earth
[1:41:23] why that one
[1:41:27] of all those of humanity on the face of
[1:41:30] the earth why you
[1:41:33] why you
[1:41:35] because god put something in you
[1:41:37] and you said i'm attracted
[1:41:40] i want to know you more
[1:41:42] hallelujah i can remember my own romance
[1:41:45] was a long time ago but
[1:41:47] i still remember things and
[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:41:49] you know of all them young ladies
[1:41:54] i don't know i'm not going to put their
[1:41:55] sister jerry on the spot and ask her if
[1:41:57] she's happy or not about that but that
[1:42:01] out of all those young ladies
[1:42:04] me
[1:42:06] i stop sometimes and say why me
[1:42:10] i pray sometimes in the midnight hour
[1:42:13] lord why me
[1:42:15] just all these people why me
[1:42:20] but i want to stop that i want to say
[1:42:22] lord you chose me
[1:42:24] my wife she chose me
[1:42:26] oh my
[1:42:27] those of you that would have known me
[1:42:28] back then you truly we hear people say
[1:42:31] oh
[1:42:32] that's a geek
[1:42:34] there is a stage beyond geek
[1:42:42] and you can still be loved
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:46] because there's something there that
[1:42:47] attracts
[1:42:48] that's what god put in your heart today
[1:42:51] that attraction
[1:42:52] lord i want to know you more
[1:42:54] open your word to me i want to see you
[1:42:56] in your beauty i want to see you in your

[1:43:06] love to me and speak these things these
[1:43:08] sweet things to me
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:12] because this is what god intended
[1:43:15] bear the reproach
[1:43:17] did you ever see mary
[1:43:20] give up
[1:43:23] never in fact mary
[1:43:26] had such a zealousness about her
[1:43:29] that as people viewed it her own son
[1:43:33] get what i'm saying
[1:43:36] pushed her back woman
[1:43:39] what have i
[1:43:40] to do with thee
[1:43:43] boy that should have
[1:43:44] how dare he
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:47] but she knew who he was by revelation
[1:43:50] every mistake i'm finished now but every
[1:43:53] mistake in mary's life
[1:43:55] every mistake get this every mistake
[1:44:00] letter forward
[1:44:02] letter
[1:44:03] some should repeat it some
[1:44:07] she never
[1:44:09] but it led her to the place
[1:44:12] we view it as a mother she stood at
[1:44:14] calvary
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:16] looked up
[1:44:18] i believe by then because she had
[1:44:20] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:22] herself
[1:44:23] she knew what the whole plan was
[1:44:26] she looked up there and thought oh god
[1:44:30] all that this has brought the reproach
[1:44:32] and the sufferings and all of the doubts
[1:44:34] and fears and all of the criticisms
[1:44:37] has come to this place right here
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:41] you still didn't hear mary say
[1:44:43] i wish this hadn't happened
[1:44:46] in her heart she says
[1:44:48] this is what god's plan was
[1:44:51] thank you lord
[1:44:53] i'm asking you
[1:44:54] look
[1:44:56] god will show his plan to you
[1:44:58] [Music]
[1:45:00] hallelujah
[1:45:02] hope
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:09] hope
[1:45:11] is in the lord let's stand saints
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:27] is in the lord
[1:45:31] forevermore
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:39] standing all within the presence of
[1:45:44] the lord
[1:45:46] in whom the wisdom of the
[1:45:50] age is life
[1:45:54] from whom the reaching of the
[1:45:58] seeds of sun
[1:46:02] a living sacrifice
[1:46:06] the only
[1:46:07] source of
[1:46:10] my life
[1:46:13] is in the lord
[1:46:17] from this time of
[1:46:21] evermore
[1:46:26] my hope
[1:46:28] is in the lord
[1:46:32] forevermore
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:40] his tender mercies come
