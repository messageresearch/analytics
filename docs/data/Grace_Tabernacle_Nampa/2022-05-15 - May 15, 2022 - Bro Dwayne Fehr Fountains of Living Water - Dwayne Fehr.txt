we could step out and receive it today in the precious name of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah lord we confess our healing we receive your gift this morning in the name of jesus christ hallelujah saints go confessing hallelujah hallelujah brother isaac did you want to share those words [Music] god bless you this morning just wanted to say a couple things i just wanted to first of all thank everyone i promised myself i wouldn't get emotional here but you guys didn't help me out much i just want to thank everybody for the the kind words and the prayers and the um phone calls texts and stuff and stuff it um last saturday when we took her in you know we didn't we had no idea what was coming and we felt like we got hit by a train um it was very difficult um i won't say that it's gotten easier to complete you know changes changes the way you do things that's for sure but um but most of you know i think i just want to say a couple things about this so type 1 diabetes this is what the doctors say doctors say that she'll have it for the rest of her life they say that it's an autoimmune disease at one day something happens and triggers a an autoimmune response that the uh your immune or your you know your white blood cells begin attacking the b cells and the pancreas and that's what produces the insulin they don't know why they don't know when they don't know how and it it it's it's not necessarily genetic two identical twins can be born with the same dna one will get it one won't they don't know why they have no idea that's what the doctors say i think we have a little different outlook on things when we got this news i think it was actually sunday when they when they confirmed they said she has type 1 diabetes she's got all the you know the things in the blood that show that all these different things i uh i was driving back into i well the first thing that came to me you know first thing that came to me was the the scripture and jeremiah 29 11. for i know the plans i have for you plans of peace not of evil to bring you an expected end and i'll tell you i felt peace in that immediately i felt peace knowing the word of god knowing what it says about healing and i'll be honest i think i i may you know physically hear you you show some emotion i don't think there's anything wrong with that but i believe that almost like abraham you know he got that word from god and he rested in it yes he arrested it and it was done he didn't see it right away he maybe even didn't see signs of it right away but it happened and it was done and i i just felt that and and um i popped in on tape you know it's what you do right that's what we do and i wanted to read a little bit from you this i just happened to pop in god has a provided way hallelujah and i i honestly i did i just scrolled through my phone and i hit play on something i just needed to hear something right and i believe this this is what i needed to hear amen and he he's starting out and he said if i were to say anything about a text for tonight i wish to speak on this god has a provided way he has a provided way of approach to him he has a provided way of escape and he has a provided way for everything we have need of if we can only find that way god is provided then we're sure to get it if god if this building was provided here to take care of to keep the rain off of us as long as we get into that building then we're out of the ring if god has a provided way for salvation we can find that provided way we can have salvation if god has a provided way a divine healing then we can find get in that way we find divine healing if he's provided peace for the unstable then we get in that way and we find his provided way we can have peace hallelujah that just further on down he's talking about ruth and i can find it here he's talking about ruth and boaz and he's talking about you know when boaz goes to claim naomi to get ruth right and he says get ready here it is oh i just feel something moving notice christ before the elders of israel and this you know he's typing boaz right led outside the gates of the city and made a testimony he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed a public testimony he has redeemed the church from what her lost estate in the garden of eden we didn't have any sickness we didn't the garden of eden we had no sin the garden of eden we had no death and god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son made a testimony outside of the gate that provided way of escape for all who wanted to come what a beautiful picture i hope you can see it now the lord be blessed glory to god that just you know it just confirmed to me and some some things i think the one of one of the one of the statements he made made in there was um god doesn't have to heal to prove prove his power he has to heal to keep his word and he's gonna do it he's gonna do it amen the thing about this and i've had friends that say it i've had i've had you know the doctors that say it and they say well you guys will just get used to the new normal you know what it's not the new normal and i don't accept it it doesn't have to be that way god bless you amen god bless you god bless you why don't you take your seats for a few minutes god bless you all paul you and i got to talk there is no such thing as the devil's new normal yes that's right there is a normal that comes yeah you're right you're right i'm sorry here i go and i'm gonna ask my wife if she come to piano though seeing as someone asked if we would uh if we'd sing you know every winter they got the howling down in the desert there are the harmony in the desert and um and we just come from the north so it's the chattering of the north that we'll bring with us and uh i'll i'll tell you what brother isaac we don't believe in the devil's new normal you know oh for the last man it's been four years since i've been here and all these kids have grown up and and brother jason's gotten old and brother paul's gotten older and and you know i i'm it's just like it's constantly changing right brother dwayne's losing his hair and [Music] and then we've been through this plague called covid it's not the new normal if they want to accept it they can accept it but you and i we have one thing that we accept everything else is rejected so by his stripes we are present tense not war we are healed and that little girl we have just seen god do so many supernatural things now there ain't no reason in this world that that little girl has to carry that uh i want to say you know how the devil does he loves to everywhere as you go now everybody's marked they've got tattoos they've got piercings they've got you know they've got striped hairs they've got they're they're all trying to find an identification but there's a reality here too we also have an identification and we also have a mark and the mark of a real believer is that he can say that belongs to me that is mine whether the rest of the world can accept it or receive it or not that's not up to us but we have thus saith the lord this morning this is our word this is our time this is listen brother brown said this is this is the hour that god chose to manifest you which was an eternal attribute of almighty god so jesus could say i come from god i go to god you can say the same thing you might we might be trapped in this body we might be walking in idaho dirt but let me tell you something this morning idaho dirt has got to give way to the supernatural god on the inside he can say amen to his own word he can receive what this world can't receive there's no wonder brother brown said to us all things are possible all things are possible listen if we can if we can receive it this morning we can receive a body change how much more can we receive healing of our bodies i'll tell you what you know how brother brown said he said man i was so sick to my stomach he said that ulcer just eat me up and he said and i read in the word where god said by his stripes i'm healed he said he said i went down and i ate my breakfast and he said and it came as soon as it hit bottom it came straight back up he said i put my hand over swallowed it back down once i got it down he said by his stripes i'm healed i walk down the street and he said it would come up and i'd swallow it back down somebody say hey billy how you doing he said i'm just doing wonderful don't brother paul you've got it written on the ground on your board in your garage don't ever let your testimony be negative don't never let your testimony yeah lord help me don't we get caught that's the spirit of ladies but we're not the grumblers that die in the desert we're the ones that they found in the book that are rejoicing and screaming and shouting praising their god giving him glory and you know i'll be honest i had no idea i said what do you want to sing this morning i said i don't have you know sometimes you just feel inspired to sing something and sometimes you just don't and i just got left out and i felt like the cold this morning i just didn't know but the one thing i do know is this morning when i put this little song on my on my tablet it wasn't me that put it on the tablet brother isaac i want you to listen to these words this morning i just believe it just happens to fit it couldn't be more perfect [Music] day after day [Music] and i feel so warm down [Music] how about we try that again [Music] i haven't sang it for a long time all day after day the bad outrages i feel [Music] the pressure now seems so much greater i wonder lord how can i stand and down on my knees at the foot of the altar gently he takes my and he lifts me up just a little bit higher shows me that he's still a command he says my child why so down hearty why so gloomy why is so sad before i'll finish soon what i have started i've chosen you child go take the land [Music] brother isaac listen to this verse if we could only see there's no such thing as failure why it's all just according to his plan we'd stand up top we confess our god is able he has promised we're rare to this he said my child why so damn hardy why so gloomy oh why [Music] [Applause] what i have started i chose a new child go take the land [Music] he says my child why so downhearted [Music] what i have started i chose a new child go take the land oh i chose a new child [Music] hallelujah hallelujah i'm so grateful this morning listen he's chosen us we all got a land to take you all got a giant to conquer we all got something to overcome he just happened to bring it down to your house he just happened to let satan walk up to your door this morning he just happened to put him in your car he just happened to drop him down into your child but the promise is to you and to those that are called and to those that are far off aren't you glad to be a son of god this morning aren't we happy to be the children of god listen if that don't radiate in your life that you are a chosen son of god this morning i want to just encourage you don't leave don't leave till you know that you know that you know that you know that the god that you serve is living that he's alive he's not just an imagination he's not the god of just william branham or not the god of paul the apostle he is a living god who is abiding in a body of believers right now he's absolutely one brother brown said one of the threefold purposes of god the second one is that he would come into a bride body and have preeminence that means that he is sitting on the throne of our lives brother paul i am so happy this morning uh you know what we might we might get can i say this the storms of lady ocean might blow through and the clouds might get real low and and you know the storms might get dark and the nights might get along but let me tell you one thing this morning the s-o-n has risen and as long as there is a cloud there you know there's a sun that's beyond the cloud don't get your eyes on the cloud get your eyes on the sun that's beyond the clouds we are people of faith we're not people that just walk this world we just we're not just meandering through and oh well whatever happens happens and when life is over it's over oh no no no no no we got a heaven to attain listen church we're not just longing we're not waiting to attain heaven and its glory there i want to attain heaven in its glory here so i can enjoy the glories of it there come on church don't sell yourself short this morning we were born for this season praise god praise god now you and i are going to talk brother paul man it's one thing to have a pulpit that you can see over but then to plant a big screen where little guys like me have to stand on our tippy toes now i know why you walk around the outskirts of your pulpit i'll tell you what ain't god good to give us so many blessings undeserving it's what we are i want to thank him love and praise him more today and a whole lot more tomorrow amen amen amen god bless you let's stand to our feet aren't we're so happy that he's in our presence this morning so thrilled to be here i'll tell you what i i'm you know i i don't even feel like i deserve to be here but i'm happy i'm here i i said i uh you know it was such a battle just trying to get here and i thought lord don't you even want me to go or watch and but look it man you've got border patrol standing at the edge of the border of canada the united states and they're just checking everybody that comes through hey where's your vac pass where's your vax pass have you been inoculated you know they never asked me one question i just drove up the border said father if you want me to have a great trip somebody said how you getting back home i said he brought me here he'll take me home listening to great sons of god are what have we got to worry what have we got to fear man we just if you ain't happy this morning i'll tell you what you need to drink you need a drink revelations chapter 7 i just want to take a little thought this morning and and lord help me lord help me i uh i i mean lord put it in a nice little package this morning and then i don't keep you too too terrible long and brother paul told me i could take my liberties so everything that's wrong after service i'll just blame it on your pastor it's all his fault i don't know he's gonna take it too revelations chapter seven and oh bless god for life bless god for life eternal i i don't know what we do this morning if i didn't if we didn't have life i you know we just got the greatest pearl we got the greatest gift ever given to man take the whole world give me jesus revelations chapter seven and and after this starting at verse nine pardon me this morning after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues stood before the throne before the lamb clothed with white robes palms in their hands and cried with a loud voice saying so you know what can we just can we just read this one together we're going to say it together someday so why don't we do it now and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and the land and all the angels stood around about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped god saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our god forever and ever amen and one of the elders answers saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes and once came they and i said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation i'll tell you what brother don't you ever let's not complain too much about our tribulations that we're going through these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb and therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither shall neither thirst anymore neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat and i want to just i want to i want to zone in if i can on this verse verse 17 for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of water and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes can we pray this morning heavenly father the lord is so good to be in your presence this morning lord your people have come with expectation lord and we're all anxious lord we're all out waiting lord as it were for you to set the plate before us this morning that we can eat you promised you would lead us and that you would feed us so father i pray you would do just that this morning lead me lord down the paths of lives lord down the avenues of these hearts oh god lord these are your children you know where they're living so come lord minister the way that would please you the most in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you saints you can take your seats if i can take a a little thought this morning a little title as it were i i want to speak on living waters and lord gave me this little thought i don't know some months back and i i got all blessed over it the first time and i've appreciated a couple times since then and every time i i think on it i get blessed by so i'm gonna trust that it'll be the same kind of blessing for you this morning and and i i just have to reiterate that last scripture i want us to notice something here it says for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of water and you know where sometimes when we when we get looking in you know the book of revelations is is completely written in mystery form and it's and it's written that way for purpose because it's not to the people of the world this is the bride's book she is a supernatural people therefore this supernatural book is given to her to understand the mystery that's written in it and you know be beyond the letters of the words that are written in the book there's a life that's being projected and if we can just receive that life we'll we'll recognize that it's all about christ and his little bride and and so when we get to you know sometimes we we're so programmed you know as little kids we get we end up in school and and we get to reading books and then you get to watching uh you know videos of people projecting things and and you know as it were when we uh when we would consider a throne we would look at it like you know like a big big old chair and we sit down in it and it's you know it's all ornate and and and and you know the arms erode and it's everything is and it's and it's it's it's it's cut for a king to sit in so when we speak of a throne that's what we would speak that's what our minds would go to is is this this great beautiful big chair and and a kingly figure sitting in that chair but i want us to notice something brother brown says this and i'm just going to set a little background this morning before i get into my into my thought brother adam says this he's in prayer and and so we would we would realize it this way that you know the god the god that we believe is god uh he's god of heavens he's god of earth he's god of everything and he's so great that he's got to be somewhere in the eternities and he's sitting on a great throne and from there he's ruling all things that we get a mental picture like that so brother branham says this and he says heavenly father he's just going into prayer he says we are now approaching the great mighty throne of god as mortal beings in a natural body yet our voice is speaking out the words that's coming into that great throne somewhere in another dimension where god sits and so if we just take that very thought we would think you know in our prayers we're praying out somewhere in another dimension where god sits but i i want us to recognize something because it was never god's intent like it was in the beginning when he did exist in the eternities it was never his intent to remain there as an unknown god on a throne that you and i could never see could never be part of well you know it would just be some figment of our imagination so he absolutely you know we recognize that when jesus was here in matthew the 28th chapter when jesus was here after he had uh i was after the the resurrection he comes back to his disciples and he makes his statement to them he said all power in heaven and all power in earth has been given into my hands all power in heaven and earth has been given unto me what was it here comes a prophet thank god for a prophet here comes the prophecy what was it he said man and god had united the supernatural god the unseen god had become flesh and now listen to what he says here he says man and god had united the logos had been made flesh and had been killed and rose again for our justification and was then the anointed emmanuel forever and forever now listen close god had changed his dwelling place from a throne in the space's yonder to the heart of his son christ jesus to live and reign forever god was in christ he's the final resting place of the spirit so watch as god is condescending it was god spirit in the eternities and he's and this is how we picture god let's let's be real this morning let's be real this morning because when you get down to pray you've got this uh you've got this unknown face kind of that you're praying to this and you're and you're praying out into a god in the eternity somewhere and many times if you're just praying in your flesh i'll be honest you're not praying nobody you're not praying to nobody because he ain't existing up there anymore that's not where that's our mind's imagination if satan can keep him there and and he and you have no idea of who he is or no relationship with him you are a defeated person this morning if you have no idea who he is you are defeated this morning that's not where god wanted and he knew we would be in this condition so he steps down into a body of flesh he comes as you and i are and he takes on the whole uh uh how the whole struggles and troubles and frustrations of of this life to become that sacrifice now listen we know the body is laying up there somewheres and he's making intercession on our behalf but the blood has been shed so brother branham makes this statement and may i encourage you in this this is not my notes right now but may i encourage you this morning brother branham makes this mistake this statement he says listen god does not see you that's it so when the enemy comes to you and says paul i've seen what you did the other day oh god forgive me i know you were no no no no god didn't even see it god didn't even see it that's right but he had an accuser of the accuser of the brother and walked up into his face and said hey you know what paul was doing the other day and father's like no no i know i don't well let me tell you what he's doing and watch satan begin to rattle off all your mistakes and all your failures and all your shortcomings and father just go like this hold on stay in spirit realm but he condescended into flesh you know all these things but i want to set this background here this morning brother brown says this listen he is now sitting on his father's jesus says this our brother says this about jesus he is now sitting on his father's throne in other words listen close we're talking about a throne this morning in other words he is setting in god's power in spirit now when he comes back he'll set in an earthly body on david's throne okay so when we're talking about a throne we're talking about a place where god would what would rule and reign from it's not just a big chair even though it may be it's not just a big chair that's all ornate in the in the in the eternity's yonder somewheres god is condescending now he was standing in christ in the body and from there he was ruling and reigning over sin over sickness over frustration over anxiety over all of our discouragements he was reigning over pain he was reigning over all these things that we would go he was ruling over it in that body all right praise the lord okay now brother brown makes he makes this statement i want to i'm just i'm trying to bring this all down so i don't get too too long-winded here this morning lord help me all right how many is going to give me grace this morning all right i like what one brother said at home he said brother dwayne he said you know when he says just get i seen the brother say just give me five minutes who's willing to give me five minutes this morning yeah he said that's five that's 10 that's 15 20 25 35 we're good for an hour and a half praise the lord all right he said now listen brother brown says this now listen he says the shekinah glory raised from the mercy seed he's talking about the tabernacle in the wilderness remember how that's a type of christ right he so he says he's he's raised from the tabernacle uh from the mercy seat one day and it settled on another tabernacle he said this one the father judges no man but he committed all judgment to the son god's judgment seat wow he says you speak against that he says and it'll you speak against me it'll be forgiven speak against another one that's coming another mercy seat oh my all right okay let me just go on i'm just going to jump to the bottom of the quote so we can just uh we can just rush into this a little bit he says the first throne was in heaven the judgment seat the second throne was in christ and the third throne is in you sister now i'll just read what he said and if you can receive it this morning and believe it now the first throne was in heaven judgment seat the second throne was in christ the third throne is in man you mean almighty god brother paul the one that went and worlds begin to unfold and universes begin to unfold and angelic beings begin to burst forth you talk about a god that deserves worship these ones that we're going praise our god holy holy holy we talk about an almighty we're not talking about a mighty god this morning we are talking about almighty god that one that reigned in the eternities over all space and time pours himself down into a little body to become a a living sacrifice that same god was reigning on that heart on that throne in that body is now reigning in me is now raining that means he is this is the second full purpose this is exactly what god had in his mind when he was in christ he was expressing himself as god to the world now he comes and he's wanting to he wants to do the same thing in you and you and you and sister sarah and you and by the way i'm supposed to say hello while i'm remembering and god bless you and me and you and you and me and me and you that's what god's purpose was don't miss the purpose of god this morning church listen we go back brother branham says this he says amen he says now he says but in god he says god chose a man's heart for his control tower the devil chose his head for his control tower see he makes him see things look through his eyes but it god in his heart makes him believe things he cannot see are you listening this morning brother isaac makes him believe things he cannot see he said did he see god is on the heart he's in the heart of man is the throne of god you get it he said man exclamation mark man all right hallelujah you say well brother dwayne he didn't say woman he said man whoa man it's all together man woman it's all the man of god sex was not part of uh you know our sexual orientation was not part of his great economy in the beginning hallelujah listen to this god made his throne in the heart of man oh praise the god pray praise the lord praise the lord now let me just go back and read that scripture out of revelations the seventh chapter for you for the lamb which is in the don't you go thinking that it's somewhere in the eternities right now listen to this for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne oh and you shall know in that day that i am in you and you in me and me and you and me you know what i'm saying and the lamb which is in the midst of the throne of god he shall lead you and he shall feed you amen come on church hallelujah he shall lead listen where is he going to lead us to this morning fountains of living waters fountains have lived listen uh this whole thought came to me praise god you don't mind if i do this i know that we're just firmer enough that we can get away with this here listen living waters this whole thing struck me back you know we're all going through the covet thing and hey you know you got way too much time on your hands we we cuz some of us were locked up at home for a while and and so you know we got to get healthy and brother dwayne gets to looking at this juicing stuff right and and so i'm i'm pretty intrigued with this you know we're getting older and we're starting trying to stay younger and it's not working and and so finally we get all of a sudden i'm watching this little clip and it's talking about this juicing thing it says you take the plant and you pull the plant out of the ground and you cut off the roots of it and then you take it while it's still alive i hope you're listening well it's still alive and you crush it it goes through the juicer it grinds it and all the life that's in the plant it's at that time when the it's they call it living water because the life of the plant is still in the water it's in the liquid form now and that form you drink it and it becomes your portion listen church i'm reminded of another tree that was crushed that was broken that was run through the ringer and when it came out it brought forth what living water hallelujah we get to looking at these living waters and we can go right back through the scripture and we're going to take a little journey this morning we can go right back into the garden of eden in genesis chapter 2 it says and the lord planted a garden eastward in eden and when he and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord to grow every tree that is pleasant to sight and can i just stop a moment on this i get so thrilled when i read these scriptures listen we get a mental picture and god help me if i'm wrong but how many believes there's natural fulfillments of things there are spiritual fulfillment god has compound meaning in his word and don't miss the spiritual aspect of it listen there is billions there's 8 billion people on the face of this earth and i want to say probably 5 billion of them have a bible in their homes in some form or another they got a bible in their homes they've got a letter written but they miss the living portion of it they miss the reality of it here the scripture says it says and out of the ground made the lord to grow every tree that is pleasant to sight and good for food all right and good i'm not just talking listen church it wasn't just a pear tree and an apple tree and yeah listen when when jesus healed the man brother paul he was blind and when he spit in his blood he put stuff on his eyes and he said can you see what do you see now he says i see men as trees walking walking what kind of you know listen your pastor comes up here and the ministry comes up here what are they giving you the bread of life every tree that's good for food the father has planted and there was the tree of life in the garden and there was a tree of knowledge of good and evil listen and a river went out of eden to water the garden which garden what kind of river a river of living water brother paul a river of living water brother david what kind of garden was it watering it wasn't just going to water the garden of eden as far as maybe a water died but listen there's another eden there's another spiritual eden that's sitting right here right now and that river is still watering that garden of god god has planted you god has sown you in the ground god is going to bring you up listen why does he so why does he say this that the tree must bring forth much fruit what's he talking about he's talking about fruit trees hallelujah i don't miss all the details in the scripture church don't read no other brother brown says if you don't see christ in every can i say it this way if he said if you don't see christ in every scripture go back and read it again and he is in me and i in and i am in him if i don't see myself there i need to go find a revelation lord where am i at in this this book was written about me this is my book it was written about you hallelujah let me go on oh my lord help me this morning all right praise god brother brandon makes a statement like this he's talking about he said he prophesied that he himself would give them living waters and if a man would a a man would never thirst again but but would live eternally says he says he showed himself as the great i am he is the bread of life the well of life the eternal one the tree of life he was back there in eden in the midst of the garden even as he will be in the midst of the paradises of god hallelujah you know abraham had married problem part abraham and married a sarah one day and god had given him a promise that he was going to bring forth the promised word for his day there was a promise that was given to abraham and and you know as time went on you know he's looking at he's looking at the promise and sarah's looking at the problem she's not conceiving she's not conceiving she's not conceiving she's the ones looking at a promise and one's looking at a problem and abraham just emphatically is stating god is able god you know 10 years goes by he's more than able 20 years goes by he's still more than able hallelujah one week goes by two weeks goes by three weeks goes by it don't matter the promise is ours this morning brother isaac it belongs to us this morning hallelujah but one day sarah gets this brilliant idea listen it's not working i'm god maybe maybe we missed what god i'm going to give you hagar my hands made this beautiful egyptian woman i'm going to give you this woman and and you can have her and she can bring forth life and we'll call it mine that was never god's intention that's the doctor's words we can give her an injection you can poke her arm for the next 40 years of her life but that is not the that is not what god had in mind god has a promise in mind god has his perfect will his buyers her by his stripes she's healed hallelujah so here is here's here's haggard i want to i want you to notice but the reality is that god himself is not waiting on some man-made pipe that he can water his church with he is the fountain of living waters he knows how to pour it out listen you might get spiritually dried up you might think oh god i need a drink oh god i need a drink i'm here to tell you there's a drink available for you this morning you don't have to want the drink you need to take the bottle and drink you need to drink to you can't drink no more we are listen church there is a the the heavens are full there's a time where where the moabites were uh you know you know there's a great battle coming there was it was a time of elijah and jeroboam and ahab and and then jeroboam or i i believe it was jeroboam anyhow no that don't sound right it was jehoshaphat pardon me thank you lord it was jehoshaphat you know him and they have been kind of tied up don't never get tied up with an unbeliever let me just say this you businessman do not be unequally yoked do not be unequally yoked that's not just between marriage do not be unequally yoked you get into business with the wrong kind of person i'll tell you what you you will have a hard time to maintain your test god will have a hard time to bless you in that in that condition don't do it i don't know why i said that that's good here's the reality jehoshaphat you're scriptural now jehoshaphat and ahab they get tied up together because there's a great syrian king that's coming against them and and you know and and and and jehoshaphat is concerned and and so they tie up their armies and away they go they're gonna they're they're gonna bind themselves together and they're gonna fight the problem is that they did what we do they do what you do here comes your pastor here comes the ministry of this church you know they've been feeding they've been eating they've been they've been filling their cup they've been laying in the presence of god they come in on wednesday night or sunday morning they just pour out there's a gusher just comes out of heaven it waters you you go away rejoicing you go home and you don't pick up your bible monday you don't pick up your bible tuesday you don't even pray till you get to church on wednesday you go back home and you're so busy thursday and friday and saturday and sunday morning comes and 10 30 shows up and at quarter 11 you get in and sit down i made it to church let me tell you something you are dying and if you don't know it let me say it again you are dying that's a reality jehoshaphat found himself in that very condition there they were their men they had gone seven days and they realized something i didn't drink we ran out of water listen we don't we're not serving a god that runs out of water this is an eternal fountain this is an artesian well we're we're here this morning because we're thirsty lord i'm living in a barren and a dry land i'm thirsty i'm hungry and i need to be fed you know so many times father's god isn't this wonderful he comes he becomes a servant to all if i could just say it spiritually speaking he comes in on a wednesday night and he you know he literally takes a tray the big silver platter like this is his children these are royalty that he's about to feed he sits the goblets of wine down he sits the bread down he sits the grapes on it brother paul walks out spiritually and he's holding it in his hands and he begins to walk down the aisles and he just begins to go like this while he's preaching yeah and you do exactly that brother you keep your hand just right there spiritually speaking he keeps walking down the aisle the holy spirit trying to minister to you the grapes are there right from canaan land and you're like let me tell you something if that same holy spirit walked down the aisle and you could physically see it with your eyes and he'd be holding a handful of thousand dollar bills you know what you'd be doing you'd go like this just how natural and carnal we get because i need that to pay my bills oh i need that to do this i need that oh no no no you need him you need him he'll pay your bills he'll give you your health he'll give you your job he'll lead you to places you've never been before he'll give you joy he'll give you peace he'll give you he'll give you all the desires of your heart he said just seek the kingdom of god first i'll give you the desire of your heart listen joshua found himself seven days journey he found himself without god and there's no water now what are we gonna do well at least somebody had enough common sense to realize where's the word at today where's the word at today oh it's elisha you know it wasn't elijah it was elisha brother paul you remember that's a type of we're living in that hour right now where is the word at here's elijah our saying he goes to elisha and elijah said you know i have i wouldn't even look at you if it wasn't for the presence of this man you know the story and what did god command them to do hey you just head straight back out into that barren desert and you pack your little shovels and you pack your pickaxes and you get out there i know you're starving i know you're dying of thirst right now you want us to go back out there you want us to start in this geek you want us to dig you want us to dig ditches you want us you want us to hack out that's what god's orders were okay you can sit on a nice little pew and die or you can do something about your life you can hack out the trash in your life listen can i tell you this you can get the pickaxe of the holy ghost in your life and you can dig out facebook you can dig out twitter you can dig out the news of the age you can get rid of it let me tell you something you need to bury that stuff it's standing in the way of what's god is god which is a gusher that it's a rock that was smitten at calvary brother paul brother brown said that same rock that they smote in the wilderness the water was still available the problem was that that the children of israel left all their trash in the way and god said if you can just get the trash out of your life he's going to absolutely open up a fountain of water that you can contain hallelujah hallelujah we're not walking around with our cups half empty this morning brother paul if we are it's our fault it's not the holy spirit's fault if you're dry and barren it's your fault it's not the holy because out of the throne out of the midst of the throne of god i will lead you and i will feed you hallelujah praise be to god let me move on hallelujah thank you lord what an hour to live in praise god jeremiah said this he says my people have committed two evils oh brother dwayne i know where you're going broken cisterns broken cisterns i know that you know the denominational systems they put god out and they built their little walls and and hold on god ain't dealing out there anymore they got their rebuke they got their condemnation god is not dealing come on church go back and read revelations one two three and four you'll find out the church ages is over he has walked out they stood he stood there and knocked on their door and they said we don't want that kind of god we want to live how we want to live i want to walk down the street how i want to walk down the street brother paul i want to do what i want to do on sunday morning i

truth come on church let's be wise to the wiles of the devil you know i just come from brother harold's funeral here the other day and and he's got this they took a little excerpts out of his bible little pictures and stuff and he had one little expert excerpt written in his uh in his bible he said your revelation will reflect your life so here we are claiming the greatest revelation that's ever been known to man that i'm part of i'm a part of eternal god and if my life don't reflect that something is very wrong something is very wrong listen church i'm not here to play games with you this morning either we are living at the end here he is revelations one two and three and he's walked through the midst and you know through the church ages on the last part of him brother paul he stood there and he knocked at their door revelations 4 1 there is a voice that says come up hither come up hither why the same angel out of revelations 18 who said come over from amongst them said come up hither i've got things to show you things that must shortly come to pass well brother dwayne that was all about john and the scriptures you know no no no brother bro here comes the prophet says john is a type of the bride and who came to tell us what did the holy spirit come to tell us things that surely must come to pass things that are to be hallelujah oh church where are we living this morning praise god praise god let me move on jeremiah says they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters i'll tell you what you're looking at a man who used to stand on the edge of his seat get a hockey game he'd stand right at the window yeah yeah he'd jump up and down he'd make a fool of himself that why because it was one of my gods but paul you know me well enough get into a motocross race get around one i'd be the one on the edge of my seat i'd be just standing it i'd be the one cheering i'd be the one giving it my all why because it was my god well let me ask you something this morning then what are you giving your life to that's it that's exactly right that's the truth is this book right here revelations chapter 5. brother paul they're standing and screaming they're standing and shouting they're worshiping they're adoring what the bloody lamb as he walks out my god my god that was me that was doing the screaming that was me that was doing that was the new man that came forth well brother dwayne is that going to happen absolutely but i'll tell you what i'm letting it happen right now i'll enjoy it in that body and i'm going to enjoy it in this one too you know we got a little brother back at home we got saved i maybe i was telling somebody this the other day you know he got saved and and and god just did such a supernatural work in his life it's just it i i probably don't even have time to go into it this morning but let me tell you something god is alive god is alive listen listen to this brother isaac here's this little brother brothers here's a young man who had backslidden went out there and found himself a wife beautiful literally has the gift of business in his life and absolutely god blessed what he did in his backslidden condition brother paul he would pay tithes knowing god would bless that he knew the word and the effect of the word but was so far from living it it was not even funny he had the big house he had the big boat he had the big cars he had the fast the big trucks he had the big cabin at the lake he had all the vacations he had the kids his wife drove the biggest vehicle and he didn't owe money on them 36 years old brother paul brilliant one day he's coming home from a snowmobile trip and he is absolutely miserable miserable don't tell me that god don't answer prayer you want your family saved you want your husband saved your wife saved you want your mama saved your papa saved listen i say this a month and a half before that brother paul we had a group of men get together for a prayer meeting at the church and his brother we just stood in a circle and we just went around said brothers you laid on the altar this morning bible says if we bind our hearts together that he will answer his brother said you know what brothers i got no greater desire to see my brother saved amen i want to see him walk back through these church doors a month and a half later not even here he comes completely broken he made a stand for god i was telling brother jason as i said he made a stand for god and he said this god did something so supernatural in his life he just he said i found the pearl i have everything and i had nothing he said i have found the pearl of grape i said god what you have placed in my heart he said i would be willing to live in a cardboard box if i can just keep this be careful what you say amen when he told his wife what god had done for him she turned into i hope this doesn't sound right i'm backed out of hell she has stripped him of everything she has taken him to the courts she has taken everything everything every time she comes in and goes pow and satan blows him over he goes down and he throws up his hands and he says praise god praise god it might hurt brother listen he is the glow of god is around him like moses when he came off the mountain the glow of god is around he walked down he said brother dwayne he said one thing he said she she literally would kill me he said i can't live at home she would literally kill me she will knock the she'll kick the doors off the hinges she will do everything finally he said i had to move out for the safety of my own children she takes him to court you know what she leaves him with brother paul eleven hundred dollars a month to live you know what the average house rental is in saskatoon right now seventeen hundred dollars a month and she's still trying to get more he looked at me and she said brother dwayne he said i told the lord i'd be happy to live in a cardboard box if i can keep what i got and he said and i love that woman that's not her that's the devil i'm counting on god to bring her in i'll tell you what god can do god can do the super natural he's like if he can save me he can save her too if he if you know if sarah was part of abraham he says that's my wife he says we i might have done it all wrong but god has a purpose in it he says but i'll keep what i got right now listen brothers don't chase don't chase the things of the world we're way too far we're way too far hallelujah amen praise the lord listen this brother brown says this speaking of that rock that was smitten in the wilderness and you know the scripture says this in first corinthians it says and all did eat the same spiritual drink and for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed that rock was christ was christ we're going back to living waters that rock was christ if you're thirsty this morning he's here to give you a drink hallelujah remember remember the scriptures there was jesus standing remember here's god on his throne god on his throne here's jesus standing there and he has needs to go by samaria he has needs to go by some area and so so he heads on the way to sumerian when they get close they find a well and when they get close to the well they find out that he says you know what i'm going to stay here you brothers go on into town why because he had work to do and his work is never done in the face of the public what he does he will do inside where nobody can see there he sits just get you know listen god is never in a hurry we might frustrate ourselves we might get in a hurry god is never in a hurry so he just goes and sits down by the well just goes and sits down and waits father told me to come this far well you know the scripture doesn't say how many people came by but it says something about one person that came by you know i'll just say this the you know the brothers might have went into town and they might have got the groceries and they might have got they might have been gone a couple hours scout you know who knows i you know i don't know how many people are in samaria maybe maybe 150 people came to the maybe they all came by just walking by hey how are you you're a stranger here and just yeah he never moved never moved you know he's got one thing in mind where are you at this morning he just happened to know that there was going to be a little woman coming by that way that morning he did you know in the conversation we know the story so the conversation starts and it says excuse me you know can you bring me a drink of water uh sir who are you to ask me you're a jew and i'm a samaritan who are you to ask me for a drink this isn't nor he says woman if you knew who you were talking to you would be asking me for a drink oh i hope we're thirsty this morning if you knew who you were talking to you would ask me for a drink and she did the same thing that you're looking at this morning brother duane you don't got a bottle of water in your hand

that we think all these worldly things bring us joy they bring you temp i'll just be honest you know i was just talking about my olden days when i was before god really got a hold of my life and i thought you know the harder i rolled the faster i went the higher i could get in the air though you know the the more the thrill of life that was real joy only to find out it broke my bones and today i hurt daily because of it it took my best friend's life oh that was real joy brother paul was it exciting oh for the moment sin is always exciting for the moment and then it'll leave you a scrap heap somewhere on life's road when jesus has been walking there he's sitting there right at the well saying woman bring me a drink what's he doing he's calling on you this morning woman bring me a drink come minister to me for a minute sir you shouldn't be telling you shouldn't be talking like this why because i've got something i also want to offer you i want to offer you eternal life i want to i want to offer you something that's that's more valuable than what this world the bible says this list brother paul he looks at her and he says woman you've had six husbands and the one you're living part of me five husbands the one you're living with right now is not your husband whoa you're a stranger here brother david how how do you know that how do you know that and then the seed from the inside began to speak i perceive this man knows my thoughts he knows my life he knows what's going on listen the word is still a discerner of the thought and the intent of the heart he knows where you're at i might not know where he but if he's telling you where you're at this morning he's still a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of your heart he's god that means he's in our midst the bible says this that she threw away her pots the very ones that watered her when she needed something the very ones that she had to let down in the ground and bring back so that she could drink from the very ones that she had to crank the window or walk down all the steps to get water now the giver of life had just given her something that she knew that she didn't have before the bible says she ran into the city she ran into the city what crying come come see a man come see a man that has told me everything he never told her everything brother paul he told her holding her back she had listen you might have jumped from one church one man-made denomination to another man made a domination to another can you see this brother paul for seven for six church ages she jumped from one denomination to another denomination to another denomination to another denomination and there we sat hungry and thirsty and empty in what they were offering us and then god sends a prophet down with the word for our day and he says let me give you something that's going to satisfy you and when you got a drink from that she found the husband that satisfied her every need what they couldn't satisfy this one satisfied listen she has never quit from 2 000 years ago till right now she has never quit talking about her husband she has never quit bragging on the jesus christ she has been excited about it in the ephesian age she was excited about it in the smyrnan age and she was excited about it in lady asea and if you're not excited about him i wonder if you've ever met him hallelujah amen hallelujah

man-made inspiration we're not relying on some headquarters somewhere to send us a message and say listen we're going to all do this at the same time you're going to preach this thought this morning i'm going to preach what god gave me to preach this morning i'm not going to be dictated by no man not this one here not that one there this is a body of believers and the holy ghost wants pre-eminence in a body let it be this body you know if this body that we're looking at is filled up with millions of little blood cells then one of those cells has got to be me because brother brown

sparkling they're jewels in this gross darkness they're sparkling they're taking the word of god when their little daughter is sick and the doctor says there's no hope they're sparkling by saying you know what our god is more than able the life that was in him is for her the life that was in him is for me listen we got a sister back at home and i've told the story but we got a sister back at home

moment not in the preaching of the word brother paul in a moment sitting in her seat while the song surface was going on something within her she's a fairly big girl and something within her said stand up and worship me and she thought let's say she was sitting right there right close to the front i don't want to be a spectacle but the holy ghost said stand up and give me praise she said he nudged me again she said god if that's what you want this big girl's got on her feet and she just began to worship god she praised them and worshiped him and praised him and worshipped and she sat back down and she said when she sat back down she was sitting beside her husband and she noticed something on the inside of her arm something different she put her arms together and she said she could

god wants to open the book and show you things that must surely come show you your position in the hour we're living in hallelujah you talk about living waters if christ could say that to that little woman at the well that i am the fountain of living waters if he could say that to her then church what happened on the day of pentecost when that rock was smitten at calvary it got there's a gusher that poured out and it had to come from eternity it come from one dimension to another dimension to another dimension to another dimension and pow there was 120 standing in the upper room and that gusher come through and what happened here comes peter running out of the upper room and he begins to preaching and they begin to hearing and every man in his own tongue what are they hearing a fountain of living water not in a virgin-born man but in a in a sin born a man of a man that's been redeemed by the blood of god and there he is bringing forth life what is he doing he's preaching the eternal word of god and it's catching fire pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow and there's three thousand saying what can we do to be saved hallelujah drink drink just receive it oh god oh god what can we do let me tell you this this morning there's another verse written in the i'll say this there's a couple chapters in the bible that are completely for the believer of the age you know we can go back to the book of esther we can go book of revelations but we can also go to the book of ephesians uh-huh that's the bride's book it's ephesians it's predestinations it's setting her in order it's setting her in position and let me just talk about ephesians chapter four for a minute because there is fountains of living water and i will place in the church apostles and prophets and pastors and teachers evangelists i will place them in the church what for what are they doing brother paul you are absolutely opening the channel and living waters are coming from glory to do what to sustain you when you're dry when you're hungry when everything's going wrong when daddy's left when mommy's left when the kids are backslidden when you're when you're so discouraged you've been you know you've been shooting up you've been slicing up you've been doing these things you're so discouraged you found yourself in the middle of nowhere and here's a man of god standing there and he just begins to open up and god's channel let me tell you something jump in while these well the water's moving you know that man had to get in the water while the angels were troubling the water if they wanted healing god's here to do just that this morning hallelujah fountains of living water that's why peter and john could walk out that day and they can literally say silver and gold have we none but such as we have we give it to you what were they doing handing him a cup brother handing him a cup of healing he'd been laying there for years and he took the cup and he placed it in their hand such as we have we give you and he actually took his hand and said stand on your feet hallelujah in other words receive it hallelujah you don't have to be discouraged we don't have to be downtrodden we don't have to be listen church we are not subjects of the enemy we are subjects of the kingdom of god it's high time you recognize that you are an ambassador of that kingdom and all the power of glory is behind you when you get out of bed in the morning all of heaven is behind you to back you up praise god amen you know they tell a little story oh lord help me to get this done but they tell a little story and you hear you've heard about it over and over i'm sure you know they get weddings and and some of you guys some of you all come from the you know you know from the african continent and there's things that you do there that we don't do but one of them is called the purchase price of the bride the bride price you know the story how that we got about we got african brothers at home in our church and i know they had to go and buy their bride they had to pay the dowry to this is what she's so there's a little story that says there's a man that yeah you know you know a traitor and you know the story he traded you know he traded from you know from this continent to that continent from this place to that place and he became kind of wealthy but there he'd always stop on one island and there's this young lady on that island that he had known since she was a little girl and he'd watched her grow up but her daddy had always you know as she got older uh you know the men didn't want her and so her daddy became discouraged and he began you know he began talking down at her you know the reason they don't want you is because you're ugly the reason you're not worth nothing and you know you don't even deserve to have a husband all you deserve to do is be a slave and listen that's how the enemy talks but do you realize that that enemy has such a possession in people of this world that that's how parents talk to their children and that little woman she just got she got more discouraged more discouraged more discouraged she begin to think she's worth nothing i'm not valuable she would walk around with her head down she'd be going come on church come on that's exactly what the enemy tells you day after day bombardment after bombardment failure after failure he tells you you're worth nothing that your life means nothing that god has no purpose for your life that you're not valuable to anybody that's what satan wants to tell you and here comes this trader in and he's been watching this young lady and he's got his honor so he makes a proposition to the man he says i want to i want to marry your daughter and the whole community begins to laugh because this girl hasn't got has never had a suitor she's just been looked down on she's hidden in she got to place where she hides she doesn't want to see she doesn't want to look people in the eye anymore she feels so dirty so filthy so so worth nothing and this man comes in the village says i want to buy that girl i want her to be my wife and they begin to laugh i'm going to be back i'm going to be back on what is it february 28 1963 i'm going to be back i'm coming back i don't want to buy that girl i'm gonna i already paid so he he comes in and the whole community is there to watch the laughing stock of the community this poor little girl nothing how much is she going to give her if he offers one cow it's too much the daddy's like man if he offers me a cow's leg i'll take it just to be rid of her in comes the buyer he's like they start to make the deal and he says i tell you what i love your daughter and i'm going to offer you 10 cows for that woman there's a lot of sisters in there that are worth three cows or four cows or five cows and they like to walk around and say i'm a five cow bride i'm a three cow bride hey in that in those kind i'm not making light of their traditions it's a reality there it's a it's a it's it's literally value that's how much they value and here's a man that come in to purchase a woman that was worth nothing in the eyes of the whole community not even in her own daddy's eyes says i'm willing to pay 10 cows for that woman he said that man's lost his mind the man's lost his mind but let me tell you something he's seen something in that woman that nobody else saw he saw attributes in that woman that nobody else saw he saw quality that woman that nobody else saw and so he paid the price for that woman and then he disappeared with his bride and while he was gone for a season he began to whisper little love letters of how he loves her you know we've got about 1100 of them little love letters about how he loves her and how special she is and you know first of all she's like i'm not worthy i'm just not even worried to be your your bride i'm not worthy listen we haven't been worthy for six church ages but in this last age he's whispered it loud enough long enough that we're starting to hold our head up brother paul we're maybe not pentecostal we're not baptist we're not methodists we're not mormon we're not none of these we're the off casts but listen we're holding our head up high we're saying you know what i am the bride they you know what the story goes the man brought this little lady back home about a year later and the whole community went no no that can't be her brother paul this message wasn't given to us to beat the people it wasn't me just given to us to tell them how terrible they were this message was given to us to tell you that god thinks more of you listen if they're if if that man thought enough of that little woman this is a true story to give her 10 cows for that little bride and it transformed her life how much more the purchase blood of jesus christ when a god would love you so much that he would come that he would see something in you and he'd see something in you my brother that was so powerful an attribute that comes from almighty god that very being of god that he would love you so much that he would literally give his own life not five cows not ten cows the value was listen it wasn't the blood of man this was the blood of all mighty god amen amen and if he's willing to do that oh god forbid god forbid brothers that we ever count that blood ineffective god forbid that we ever count that blood ineffective lord help us this morning if the musicians would come praise the lord sorry i got sidetracked but listen revelations 22 says this spirit and the bride say come out of your bellies shall flow fountains of living water come and let him that hear us say come and let him that is a thirst listen church revelations chapter 22. that's is there a 23rd chapter 22 and verse 17.

literally he said the silver platter he's put the cups and he's filled them full of the wine of his grace and he's walked up and down the aisles this morning and he's offered you a drink from the fountain of living waters you literally brought it down to your level it hasn't held it up over your head you brought it down to your level and all you've got to do is take the cup and drink it church we've got the greatest thing we've got the most satisfying thing that has ever hit the face of this earth and satan is literally jealous he knows if you just get one drink if you just take one drink we can talk about a woman at the well brother paul that was 2 000 years ago and today i'm standing and i got a young man in my church that would run up and down these aisles he will tell everybody about the saving grace about the joy that god can give i've tried it all and none of it's worked but i found something that's great listen brothers sean let me talk to you young people for a minute

handsome he is i don't care how much wooing he does you turn him down flat until god has come and he found his place at the altar and god has filled him because you might live you might live in complete joy and excitement and happiness brothers you listen to me too i don't care what she looks like i don't know how pretty she is how much she tries to woo you listen you might live in joy and happiness with that woman for three months and you might live in hell for the rest of your life you might live with joy and happiness with her for five years and then you might live in hell the rest of your life you might live the joy and happiness for ten years like my brother at home and have four beautiful children with him that you love dearly and then live in hell it's not worth it it's not worth it god has listen but isaac what was the scripture you quoted out of jeremiah 29 what was it say it again for i know the plans that i have for you thus saith the lord not of evil but a peace to give you an expected end so what does he do he allows you the opportunity he gives you good vehicles to drive he gives you gas in your car he gives you a job that allows you to come sit down sunday morning wednesday night and the preacher gets up behind the pulpit and god just takes the water gate as it were and he just opens it up and he floods the garden you have the opportunity to drink and grow and if you haven't been drinking too much man-made garbage you'll be thirsty for the king for the things of god oh god god help us this morning lord help us this morning listen we're all church i

brother paul you know we get saved and praise god splash around enjoy the presence the cool refreshing of the water nothing wrong with that it's wonderful but the angel didn't want him to start to stay there angel said just a minute come on out of the midst of the throne brother david out of the midst to the throne i will lead you oh the angel's not taking you by the hand now he's just calling your name and he's walking and saying follow me pretty soon with paul it's up to here you know we can look at luther's age we can look at wesley's age it didn't take long he said it was up to his loins there we got the pentecostal age they begin to splash and throw their hands in the air and appreciate god for the gifts and it was all good it's all the moving of the spirit but watch where the angel takes him into water so deep revelation so deep that you've got to swim you've got to enjoy it you can't touch ground no more you can't you know you know how we get in the water you know the water's 12 feet deep and i'm just a little bit small so i get down there and i let myself sink to the bottom and then i'm like so i can go up and go [Music] the water god is given for this age is so deep it's deeper than the ocean and they can't find the bottom of it the revelation god has poured out to his children we're going to find out that it's an eternal revelation for an eternal seed of god that is going to take them listen i come from god and i go back to god and meanwhile the god that's in me is going to have preeminence like jesus had preeminence like the power of god had in jesus
