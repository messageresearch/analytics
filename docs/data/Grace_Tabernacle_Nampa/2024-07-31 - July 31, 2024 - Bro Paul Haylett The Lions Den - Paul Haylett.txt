know we here even within the message but within the the world today religious World such a call for Unity and they have all kinds of recipes and ideas how to bring Unity but there is one way truly to have unity and that's to be United with Christ when we have that Unity then the body of believers will have Unity amongst themselves good to see each and every one of you sister April was you able to spend time with your nephews I bet you're happy about that yes amen sister Sarah trust you're feeling better we've been praying for you amen let's just stand as we uh go into this service today uh we want to remember a few things brother Chris and I got sidetracked and it was my fault but uh we want to remember sister Sue uh I don't know if family still there or not but um I know that uh Dan cannot um the doctors want this blood clot to be gone before they before they deal with anything else and I always sometimes too late but I always think of brother Bob just remember him in prayer I believe our brother vasile would be out on the road somewhere and I know that brother Trevor and sister Carrie are down visiting pant the so we can uh remember all of them in one nice big blanket prayer right there cuz they're all together amen so I received a call um from Brother Davey rardon and he's just asking uh I think we were aware that sister Donna had a stroke and uh he's just was Desiring that we would remember uh continue to remember them in prayer sister Donna's rehab um he was a little vague but it doesn't sound like it's going very well and so we definitely want to remember them in prayer and those who are not here tonight I would like to once again speak uh kind of an overall title uh of scarecrows revealed in the scripture and I want to talk to you about the Lion's Den um one of the more ferocious scarecrows placed before a Believer uh and uh we'll just kind of look at that tonight for just a little while so we turn our Bibles to Daniel the 6th chapter vers 3 through five uh I I I love this what touched me about this is the the beauty of the description uh how they're expressing in the word even what the unbeliever thought of Daniel now it's probably doesn't totally cross our mind that often when we're out here living our life doing business or neighbors or whatever it is but uh we'll see that uh God allowed Daniel to even in the midst of his enemies because that's truly what they were they might have served in the king's court with him they might have been a neighbor as it were acquaintance as it were but they weren't brothers and unless you can come around the word of God it's not true Fellowship you know we can go and and we can talk about sports and we can talk about business and those are all well and good if you enjoy uh a little something but it really comes down to True Fellowship when it's around the word of God Amen and so I think we have to be careful when we say we had a fellowship but we talked about politics that's exactly right you know that's not Fellowship Fellowship is when Believers come together and the word word of God is shared amongst them now that doesn't mean every individual had to speak but your lives speak amen that's really our greatest testimony that our life is speaking so let's just dive into the scripture here Daniel 6 and3 then this Daniel was preferred above the president and princes because an excellent Spirit was in him Now isn't this interesting because it's not talking about all the other attributes it's just talking about he had an excellent Spirit you know that that transfers over to a Baptist a Nazarene a Methodist a Mormon your excellent Spirit affects them they recognize that I could share an example with you tonight but I I I will move on but I have a relationship with a an LDS neighbor of mine fellow farmer and when we have a conversation in the last while he he is very expressive this is going to make my weak now my brother and sister I'm not boasting of Paul because you know me too well for me to boast and get away with it but I'm my point being is they recognize there's something there that's right amen because an excellent Spirit was in him and the King thought to set him over the whole realm then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any Heir or fault found in him then said these mens we shall not find any occasion against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord to come tonight these brief words anoint them Father let them be of use to your children father Lift us up father strengthen us give us courage to serve you in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints and you know as we look at this you know as as I started to study this and look through these scriptures I I found myself making this scripture very brief but I I believe it was just so full of authority and power right here very descriptive then I thought you know there's no use watering it down with too many details amen simply we can look at this word and realize that Daniel had an excellent spirit and we know that Daniel went through a lot in his life you know uh uh God tested him and tried him uh but in the time often that we think that it's testing and trying if we'll really stop and think about it God is proving to us he's present amen we say oh that was a great trial but in the end you're still standing you're still believing and it really in essence is God proving to you I'm right here with you amen you know brother Chris just mentioned it was a a little comment I didn't speak back to him in the back office but you know on the road to emus you know Jesus just appears and starts to walk with him and these guys unload on him when you think about that they unload on him about everything that was wrong with the message of the hour our messenger left us high and dry there must be more to this message but he didn't give it to us but in the end they realized that what he had given them was enough to carry On To The Next Step that was given to them amen I believe that's applicable to the day that we're living in I'm going to be a little straightforward if you don't mind tonight there's people that have not moved forward they're still stuck back years ago but God opened the word to you and I our messenger amen the prophet of our day did not leave us high and dry he left us very perfectly positioned to step into the next Revelation or opening of the word and and so it's not for him God did not send us a babysitter he sent us a prophet and the prophet spoke and taught and revealed the word of God to us and once you catch the vision of what is happening in your life and we can go back and do a lot of history on Daniel but I don't believe we need to we know and as we look at that when Daniel first we can't really or at least I don't feel like I can really say that was the moment that Daniel got it but my brother and sister through all that happened there come a time that Daniel knew all I need to do is trust God and when I trust him he'll take care of the rest of the business he's not going to leave me nor forsake me his word's not going to return void in my life it's not going to return void concerning Israel amen and so it's there this molding and this character that come and it led him to a place brought him to a place that he had an excellent spirit I know God's still working on me amen amen I'm sorry to admit that to you tonight but God's still working on me I don't always have an excellent spirit and I say well God if you could do this for Daniel you can do it for me amen if you can do it all down through scripture for those men Lord you are doing it for me amen and so because they without us cannot be made perfect so God's not going to allow us to come in with a rotten spirit amen when he required a good spirit out of them amen so you know found no fault now imagine that your harshest critics that would love to find a way to tear you down can't find any fault who's our harshest critic Satan and you realize at the end of the day the reason he doesn't like you so much is because when he sees what he sees is a flaw in you he realizes that under the blood of Jesus Christ it's perfect so what he's trying to do is draw Perfection out and say that Perfection is flawed and sometimes we cooperate so effectively with him but I want you to know that if the devil could draw it out from underneath the blood were toast but when it's under the blood the only thing that will draw that out is the memory or our thought process that we have and so sometimes we just simply do the devil's work for him and we draw out issues and bad memories and you know Etc I don't want to belabor that we draw them out and Ponder on them and Satan he really actually has no ability because it's covered by the blood until we hand him the opportunity that's right amen so you know it it's there uh they found no fault in Daniel which is incredible but my brother and sister look at the absolute parallel the prophet talks about it they found no fault in Jesus they stood right there and said we find no fault with this man but they still desired to destroy him and so we look at this these parallels in scripture we look at this how that Daniel now in his representation in the word they said he is faultless but we still desire to destroy him and certainly that's the day that we live in uh you know I think sometimes this is a Paul thought here sometimes I think we see the devil a as as this total roaring lion adversary uh you know that's always just you know got a little blood dripping off of his tooth and and he's just a horrible person but I I think really the truth of it is Satan is wise enough to know to a degree who is and who isn't and he looks at attributes he looks at actions as the prophet of God said you can see it in the life and he's smart enough to get a clue but it's out here in limboland if you don't mind me using that word that that Satan then really has this deal because there are people who are living kind of in kind of out kind of and Satan don't know exact where they stand he'd like to say they're out but he sees something there that it looks like they are in and so what he's going to do if they're out he just kind of lets them just live any old way they want let's just use the word rough tonight they live any old filthy way they want still claim to be a Christian but when he sees that person that has trouble and repents that scares Satan because when he sees a person fail and we say oh I failed in my flesh or this thought or that thought or this action or whatever but then he sees them come and put it under the blood Satan is there saying that's the one I need to destroy and so we see how Daniel coming uh into this position of no fault but you see I find it interesting this is a takeaway for me from this study but they show us my brother and sister that that they're not even really against Daniel they're actually against the man living the word and they identified as Daniel's God that's right that's what they're really against if Daniel had just lived just kind of a loose old life and and you know talked about God and and you know oh I pray too you know they wouldn't have a problem with Daniel but they saw God reflected in Daniel and they said the only way we we can tear him down is to pit our King who thinks he's a God against Daniel's God and we'll see what happens then and they get the kingdom make the decree we know the story amen so they're holding it against the man who is actually just living the word of God and this will be one of the key Saints when the crunch comes praise God we don't be here when the tribulation comes but when the crunch comes they're not going to hate you as a person amen it says that will'll be all these all these people against you but they won't hate you as a person they'll hate you for the life you live they'll like you as a neighbor they'll like you as a friend they'll be a good coworker they'll be all of this stuff but they'll hate you because you're living something they can't live and Satan will stir them up put a bee in their Bonnet because then they'll start to say well who do they think they are but my brother and sister if they could just catch a glimpse over the banister of heaven and realize that we're nothing but a little bit of dust and a little bit of this but the seeds in there and we didn't put the seed he put the seed he put it in the season he put it in the time he put it in the place and it's growing hallelujah amen they won't like the word of God manifested in you I've dealt with people in the last while that just get wound up when you start using the word manifested and the reason they get wound up I am convinced is because they're not seeing it manifested and they're upset because they can see it but they don't have it and so it's there this decree you worship any other it's going to be death quite a quite a strong decree really when you think about this it's basically just a death sentence issued on anyone who does not cower down to anyone who does not just give over or Surrender it's a death sentence to anyone with an alternate idea a of what a God is I thought it was interesting I watched a little clip the other day have to admit this I'm going to call her a lady I want to be polite this lady was a powerful speaker but it's another person displaying that preaching This Woman's got hair as short as mine preaching and he is critiquing her preaching and criticizing it totally missing that one she's got no hair on her head two she shouldn't be in the Pulpit at all and three she's preaching the Trinity miss all of these points and just criticize how she presents it my brother and sister the blind are leading the blind amen and so you see these these leaders they're like oh if we can get Daniel out of the way it will fix everything my brother and sister they didn't understand that it was Daniel being there is why the kingdom was blessed amen they they couldn't catch the idea that God was blessing a kingdom that had a Godly Man in the leadership and they won't catch it in this nation either amen now we see we know that a lot of Israel a lot of Daniel's Brethren are in the land with him they've also heard this decree but out of all of Israel how many are the examples that didn't buckle down just four people that is an effective scarecrow that is literally correct me but if I understand that it would have been I don't know help me Brother David how many Jews there would have been I don't know if there's a actual number numbered on that but just bear with me if I'm wrong forgive me but a few hundred thousand actually yes million it's really what but we'll just settle cuz millions are made up 100 thousand but a few hundred th000 here the decree and there's four that actually can act upon the word so you know that that's not a that's not a percentage that you would be comfortable with amen but it does fit one out of a million does fit that scenario if you would put it that way so these Brethren of Daniel are in the land but yet we don't see um you know much happening from them and I can see as the decree goes forward they're saying what will we do what should we do uh we don't know what to do Rabbi uh leaders what do we do here's this decree and you know the prophet deals with this and I didn't Focus too much on it tonight CU I didn't want to get too distracted but my brother and sister they come to a place you'll either bow to this you'll either worship this way or we will kill you and real Christians now we understand they're Jews but you follow me real Christians and they got to stop and say what do we do that should not even be a question that comes out it should be we already know what to do nowhere now the prophet touches on this I don't want to get distracted we're not called to be secret Christians amen now we look down through the Dark Ages the anointing of the age and Poss possibly things could be in such a fashion in in in time but my brother and sister when it comes to the point I tell you what we failed as a Christian if they come looking for Christians and your neighbors don't point you out we missed something because our life even if you didn't testify them our life should set us apart and so here is Daniel and this decree goes forward now I'm telling you these thoughts crossed his mind he was human amen I can just leave the shutters closed on my room and kneel in my same spot and pray just like I always have but there was anointing come on Daniel and he's there saying I could be a secret Christian not change anything or I could be bold and and live my life out and if this is what God wants then that's what it will be and he opens the shutters and he kneels down to pray and the enemy is there watching every step you ever wonder why the devil tried to condemn you and such and put his finger on you such CU he is watching your every step because he wants you to see and the world to see fault failure shortcomings inconsistency now we're called to do our praying in secret right right we're not really called to be as the Pharisees and stand in the in the door of the church or the step of the church and oh Lord forgive all the rest of these message Believers that don't have a revelation like me or that's what it would have sounded like in that day Saints let's just bring it back down to our day let's not look into history amen you know the prophet preached about bring bringing God out of History amen so you can look at a historical God but the prophet said look at that historical God and then get desperate and bring him into the present don't leave him as history bring him into the present and let him fulfill the word today just like he did there amen so here it is Daniel he's there he does his praying could have done it in secret now we're not talking about uh making a show this was Daniel's routine his little room pointed amen the right direction everything was good and and so he wasn't trying to make a public display but they put themselves in a position maybe h a rooftop where they could look and see and to their greatest satisfaction realized that he had just broken the king's decree and isn't it interesting that God will allow a king to make a decree without totally thinking it through because he has anguish yeah he has anguish when he realizes he's now committed Daniel to a lion's den to death but God said you know what I want to show this King I want to show these people that I'm real and Daniel's my servant so everything's under control and you know I mean if you guys read you know very in depth to the scripture you'll see how that that Daniel packed up his bare necessities a little pack of food and tried to sneak out the back door and run away Oh wrong book yeah what Daniel do he did what God called him to do and when they come to get him he didn't jump out there with a hang grenade and a machete or whatever and try and fight his way out of this he didn't hire a lawyer they said you know you you've broken that and Daniel lets them know look I have a higher calling than even my king that I have served Faithfully my calling is greater than him oh that's blasphemy how dare you say that there's one greater than the king we've spent weeks and months propping him up none greater than you oh King none more powerful than you oh King until the king kind of was like yeah you know I'm I'm pretty important we could have just become secret Christians Lord help us if nobody knows we're a Christian we're secret Christians I know that's a little straightforward but that's my job right just put it straight forward let's put the stick in and let's stir things to our remembrance if our workplace our neighborhood even our family no one knows we're a Christian then we're a secret Christian and if we keep our belief hidden there's no repercussions that's right nobody calls you a Holy Roller nobody calls you a bromite Nobody calls you or says you're an occult I'm sorry I'm obsessed with the anti cult thing you know cuz uh we really failed on that the message maybe not every church but we really failed to press the mark of a cult but you know how easy it is just a stereotype it's almost in essence pardon me for saying it this way it's almost like a curse word well I'm sorry your word cult means nothing cuz can take the word of God and prove that you not speaking to you prove that you are in more of a cult than we are yeah Hallelujah well I mean wouldn't it be nice if you just lived any way you want and then you need a blessing you could just show up to church with enough money and be reinstated living your whole life any way you please all it takes is cash that's a cult that's a cult now look at this Daniel could have done this Daniel could have took the route right there went to the king and said yes I did it but I won't do it again and and just please let me find favor with you and we know that he would have been given favor amen there would have been a way that this would have come about but my brother and sister it was there that Daniel no doubt faced the thought that there should be a way I can work around this but what did Daniel do oh I want to be a Daniel wait my middle name is Daniel maybe I'm kind of getting close he went and he cast the shutters open and he knelled down and I don't think he got over there you know I was really proud I really proud of a little situation here the other day uh just to hear somebody in a restaurant praying to where people on tables or like turnings like and I thought that's awesome Lord just bless his food you've given us today Lord bless our souls give us strength and courage to serve you Lord we are here to do your bidding to do your work and we love you Lord and I was like go for it don't stop now keep going maybe somebody will realize how much they've left on the table somewhere and become a Secret Christian amen and no doubt Satan tried to place that in in Daniel's thoughts you know the little bird flying over trying to build the nest look Daniel come on you can you can make this all work and maybe over time it would change but Daniel as I said through the shutters open amen and so he had a call to worship we talk about gifts and callings right often times when we think about gifts and callings we're thinking about an office we're thinking about a position oh he's called to be a minister he's called to do this called to do that well I want to tell you we got a gift and we've got a calling to worship amen it's not just something we're going to some I'll do a little here and a little there the bride of Christ is called To Worship her husband to worship the bridegroom to give glory to God Amen because that's part of who we are that's part of the makeup of what we are just as a corn plant use them for an example is in the breeze amen today out out working and and there was a good Breeze come through and you know these leaves are just out there rustling and the closer you get to them the rustling sound sounds louder and louder it don't diminish they want you to know amen the spirit is moving and I'm here to worship I'm here to give praise to God and I don't care who sees me who hears me amen so his call was Way Beyond Theology and Way Beyond some teaching amen this came from his heart come on Saints we don't have to jump up and shout and scream some people say Well if you really believe it you got to be verbal well not everybody's got that kind of personality but I'll tell you if God knows our heart and I put the if there cuz you can deal with the if any way you want if God knows our heart that Saint sitting there in their heart saying Amen to that word it's rattling the windows and shaking the roof because God said I hear my son I hear my daughter but we get into a movement almost like the Pentecostals that's right that we've got to make the floor Rumble and bounce and shake and chandeliers got to be swinging because we're doing but my brother and sister if our Amen to the word is an empty amen the only thing it's doing is shaking the decimal meter it's not changing a life amen it's not changing how people are I'll tell you what they come and and he had Daniel now remember we're talking about Daniel and Daniel is a type that comes back and ties directly to us amen he had to worship there was nothing on I worship later I can catch it another day Daniel had to worship amen and he was going to worship even if he had to face the Judgment amen you know how well he would know the Judgment he would have no doubt been sitting there in the courts when the deceivers come to the king and you didn't see Daniel jump up and tell them King they're lying to you it's a trick do this do that whatever but he let the word of God and the will of God God be fulfilled how many times we'd really like to point out the air but maybe God wants you to pray that's it and he was willing to stand in the face of death no scarecrow was going to cause him to step away that's a pretty big scarecrow when you think about that amen because you see if the Scarecrow could get him to step away then he actually didn't really believe it you know Fox's book of Martyrs a story recounted of a man they come and said have you become a Secret believer and he said well not really a secret everyone in my household knows they took him down to burn him at the stake and uh they said look you're prominent I'm paraphrasing The Story You're prominent you're important you're well-respected just go back go home we're going to release you and let you think about it and he went home and the whole night through he repented and cried out to the Lord forgive me Lord got up in the morning at first light walked down to where they were burning Christians at the state and they said hey what are you doing here and he said I'm recanting my recanting that's probably not the right words but I'm recanting of a poor decision that I made don't you love the Lord amen it wasn't final you're lost but he went home and in bitter tears the Holy Spirit moving upon him in bitter tears and he knew this is not who I am I can't live life like this amen and he went down and then when they went to burn him at the steak they went to chain his arms and he said can I have just one request and they said what is it and he said don't chain my arms I won't try to escape and they stacked the wood around him and they lit him on fire and as he's there his hands come up and he's praising God as the Flames are devouring him and it haunted them that a man could be so devoted so committed that he could stand there and worship God and they were happy when the fire flames finally consumed his voice because it was condemning them and they never according to history never allowed another person to be tied to the Stak without tying their arms they couldn't deal with the fact that there would be people that would love God so much that even in death they would praise him oh my my brother my sister here's Daniel let's apply this to this if I could add it into the story The Scarecrow is saying you don't have to do this Daniel there's a way out for you and Daniel said there is no way out for me I will not recant I can't go away from what I believe I'm going to do this and it would cause him if he stepped away what testimony would Daniel have to Israel what testimony to a King you see it's interesting this comes out of several different sermons I didn't put quotes for them but you see what happens is we have to place it all on the scale and and we have to place it on the scale and that scale is life we enjoy life don't we I hope everyone here would be able to say we enjoy life amen and life is good life is grand we have those we love and things we like to do you know uh whatever it might be your hobby and and we say well I'm enjoying my life but what is that on the scale compared to eternal life amen and we have to take life and put it on that scale with eternal life and see which one of those weighs out and yet there's something in us that that uh uh just loves life when we get old we get elderly our afflictions come upon us we don't want to let go of life but we've seen afflictions come on people and they let go of eternal life they said if I'm ever going to live these are words that I know and I know who they come from if I'm ever going to come to a place I ever live really live life I better do it now and they just left so what did they do they put life on the scale and weighted it in such a fashion that it was more important than eternal life and here's Daniel he's now sitting there no doubt in his own apartment putting it life on the scale he's living in the king's Palace eating from the king's table and wearing King's reignment making decisions that change a nation and and change people my that's pretty far up the ladder is it not and it's there that he looks at this and says I put that on the scale and eternal life out weighs it incredible incredible I hope I'm not just ranting and raving too much here so it's there when natural life becomes the emphasis you'll find that people start to fear death yes sir when eternal life becomes the emphasis we realize as the prophet of God said it's just God harnessing death to take us into the presence of God but the more of natural life that we embrace the more we fear death that's right amen so why fear death it's been harnessed amen amen thank you Lord amen but what has Satan done he's turned death into a scarecrow you know back some time back uh brother Joe took me to meet a man you guys remember the lady the wife come to church for a while with us and um I remember the first time I went in the house he's laying on his bed in so much pain the morphine all those things and he just keep repeating what do I do what do I do I'm dying what do I do what do I do what do I do that day he was in so much pain his wife said I'm so sorry but I need to give him Mor morphine and when she did it was only a matter of a few minutes he passed out and went to sleep but God wasn't done with this gentleman amen got a phone call one day you know he's bright and alert and he's sitting here can you come jumped in the pickup drove there walked into the house he's sitting there and I I start to talk to him and he just looks at me and uh I was shocked he remembered my name maybe his wife had reminded me reminded him but he said what must I do and by God's grace I was able I don't really Embrace as it is the sinner's prayer a formula right but you got to have that introduction to Jesus Christ very clear because I've seen guys that repeated the sinner's prayer and remained a sinner amen so it's not like a you know a formula but he was there and he was sincere and he said okay Paul I'm trusting you I believe you what must I do I said you need to talk to the Lord he said you say the word and I'll repeat them and I said let me tell you God wants to hear them out of your mouth not out of my mouth God wants you to speak it needs to be from your heart and we got the privilege cuz he was just totally aware at that time we got the privilege of him repeating those words and you could see his eyes start to get bright and and it was something soaking into him and and we spent several hours there with him and then the pain got so great and the morphine and then it was over we got a call just I think three days later he's passed would you come now his wife because she didn't know any different she wanted us to pray over his body to pray any sins remaining sins from his body so that he could find Eternal rest we get to talking to her this is before we went to look at the body and she says you know I was skeptical but something changed and I was like what she says for the moment you prayed for him wasn't me right and he prayed prayer for God to forgive him he never ask again what is going to happen to him and she said as he took his last breath he had a smile on his face amen and she said now come in the bedroom and witness this there he is laying on the bed it's all tucked nice around him and he was just I can't even present that to you he's just laying there just the most peaceful Serene look on his face now I'm not here to tell you the guy automatically was a candidate went to heaven this that and the other but I will tell you from a man that was crying out what do I do what what's going to happen to me and grimacing and and just shuttering in pain and his own wife said he never did it again amen now let's ask him how you put it on the scale money wouldn't fix his problem amen a few more years of life wouldn't fix his problem only thing that would fix his problem was eternal life which is Christ amen so Natural Life had always been the emphasis this gentleman shared with me I've made so much money in my life he worked on on big construction sites all over the world he said I have made so much money never brought me [Music] happiness so if natural life was the emphasis we wouldn't fear death amen and we would be happy yep Satan turned death into a scarecrow 1 Corinthians 15 I need to hurry right along here 1 Corinthians 1552 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye of the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and we're not talking about Donald J amen and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption so it's got to be moved from one side of the scale to to the other side of the scale because it no longer is going to weigh into natural because natural was corruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then uh shall be brought to pass the thinging that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh don't you love that Saints it makes me so happy so here's Daniel they have come they've actually placed him officially in bonds or whatever maybe they were respectful and didn't didn't put the bonds on him but they're taking him down there and he's going to a lion's den and my brother and sister it's documented you can find it in history that the human body very rarely touched the floor before it was completely destroyed these are hungry Lions these are angry Lions these are lions that have an attitude and what would the natural man do he would push and pull and jerk and drag and whatever he could I don't want to face that but Daniel got over there and he stood there my brother and sister because his faith was not in flesh his faith was in God Amen and he stood there and they put the stone back and they put him and they cast him down there you realize why they're casting him down they're not actually casting him down as a judgment you know to to smash him on the floor they're casting him down cuz those lions were capable of Leaping out of that cage so they pull the stone back they throw them in they put the stone back because the last thing we want is a lion in their lap amen so it's there that you see that and and it's there that anyway I'm getting sidetracked he says right there we're going to put on death swallowed up in Victory oh death where is is thy Sting the flesh man is afraid of death it's got a sting oh my oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God can we say thank you Lord but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen we got victory tonight because the word says we have Victory and in our Soul we know have Victory just don't look at your flesh look at the word amen your flesh is coming along amen do you know they threw Daniel's soul in the Lion's Den his flesh had to go along that's right amen no choice but there was a testing there was a time that I wonder my brother and sister cuz I don't want to be too liberal in interpretation but I just wonder if Daniel when he went down in that Lion's Den if he was there I have an inkling of something that down in his soul God had already placed it that I'm going to come out of this this Lion's Dan I'm going to be delivered from this trial and maybe it'd be like Shadrach Meshach Abed and go if you don't deliver me Lord it's still good hallelujah it's still a victory amen oh Hallelujah I like verse 58 therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord Bo have you guys ever felt that way before seems like just trying to live the word and live life and do your best and it just seems like it just is I don't even know have the words I hate to use the words in vain but just feel like we're just on the treadmill yeah Monday Tuesday looked like Monday Wednesday looked like Monday and Tuesday Thursday look like and yeah yeah and come to church for a little relief well mostly because we didn't let it go we held on to Monday we're on Wednesday still holding on to Monday yeah and we might well be Sunday still holding on to Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday amen now I don't know if I put the quote up here um I I I guess I didn't out of expectation uh in the message expectation May the shortest quote I've probably ever read in church Daniel was expecting God to deliver him from the Lion's Den come on don't give up amen having expectations amen this in the sermon expectation and amen have an expectation God's going to deliver me out of my present circumstance now sometimes it's not maybe there's a healing a need in your body a desire you have on your heart something of that nature and and you have that expectation don't let the expectation go away I expect it I believe God's going to do it I'm going to say that he's done it I'm going to believe it with all of my heart mind body and soul amen amen Prophets saying that Daniel expecting God to deliver him from the Lion's Den I want to know what's our expectation amen you know are are we assuming we'd become part of that pile of bones that when the Lions got really hungry they'd lay down in the corner and we've all seen a cat do it they can prop a I've watched lions in Africa do this they'll prop a big old bone up with both Paws and sit there and just chew on that thing yeah I'm going to be one of the nicer bones let them Lions chew on I've lived a better life a little better Nutrition a little this those lions are going to appreciate it no they won't what's our expectation Saints that's it fiery trials anybody had a fiery trial absolutely amen anybody had a fiery trial today amen let's get this down to present tense here fiery trials we're unmovable in Christ amen we have sickness we're unmovable in Christ amen we're in the spirits influence of the spirits of a wicked age we are unmovable in Christ amen and you know part of what this comes down we got no place to run amen where you going to run our families come out of denominations our families come out of this world Amen our families come from all of this stuff where are we going to run we got nowhere to run you might say in essence our back is against the wall but we don't need a wall to stop us cuz we're not going backwards anyway amen we're going to walk and we're going to keep going amen amen we don't fight in the flesh the battle is the Lord's amen 1 Samuel amen 17:47 and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with a sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you amen into our hands speaking to Satan Hallelujah well not exactly Satan at that time but it was Satan amen Deuteronomy 20 and4 for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you amen this is the kind of God we're looking at this is the god that Daniel is going to all Lion's Den with the revelation of life in him amen and he wasn't there to fight them there's no need to fight them my brother and sister you don't even have to put the chains on me right yeah in the Paradox brother Bram said this and any man that believes God and takes him at his word no matter what the situation is God will perform another Paradox to keep his word for Abraham called the place Jehovah Gyra the Lord has provided for him himself a sacrifice and he still can cause a paradox to happen he can do that this afternoon if you'll just take him at his word Daniel from a den full of hungry Lions how could it be that that man how could it be that that man on a group of hungry Lions stayed in a cave with them all night long without any harm amen look at this in a cave with hungry Lions just drop back into the natural life in Africa the Lions when they're hungry you know it in the nighttime hungry Lions let it be known and it can be actually a little scary here inside a nice fence it's got electricity and all this stuff to detour Lions but that don't stop the lion we got to witness some of this it don't stop the lion from coming and walking that close to the fence and roaring Satan as a roaring lion 20 miles away Satan right here walking down the fence and stopping every once in a while and taking a big old paw and raking it down the wire and roaring and you realize you're staying in a little cabin thing with single Paine windows and um yeah if the line gets in here H yeah we were in sou South Africa Krueger National Park and somebody forgot to close a service gate to the compound and in the middle of the night somebody that was a camper got up to go use the restroom and encountered a lion walking through the middle of the camping area and I believe they search that place in Forin couldn't find a lion and I believe they could reason they couldn't is because when this person met the lion 20 ft away face to face they screamed so loud the lion probably thought what is this and ran but my brother and sister the person who saw the line nobody else saw the line but this this lady but there was Footprints they knew that she was telling the truth that lady had a whole different story than everyone else in that camp she had met the lion face to face and her scream was a scream that she thought I'm lunch yeah you see we're living we're living in a Time Saints any man that believes God takes him at his word no matter what the situation is God will perform another paradox to keep his word for Abraham called the place Jehovah Gyra the Lord has provided for himself a sacrifice he can still cause a paradox to happen you know lot of times if we haven't got kept our faith up we'll think we're the sacrifice right not him the sacrifice we why did God put me here well maybe you put yourself there God wants you to trust him to get you out he can do that this afternoon if you'll just take him at his word Daniel from a den full of hungry Lions how could it be that that man how could it be that that that man uh on a group of hungry Lions stayed in a cave with him all night without any harm the angel of the Lord that's it unseen to anyone else was standing there it was a paradox something had to keep that lion from getting to him now I want to tell you my brother and sister we live right here in a paradox revealed we're living in a well America it doesn't have to be America but we're in America Amen in the 21st century when the word of God and a prophet said this is the absolute darkest age of all history we have a time period in time that says this is the Dark Ages but my brother and sister the prophet said this is the darkest time and it will be right here in this evening time that the light is going to come back and it has amen we have that light amen we got 20 21st century Lion's Den is what we got you realize because the only thing that's keeping us from being destroyed is Angel of the Lord is right here keeping us I'll tell you what no scarecrow is going to keep this bride of Christ from fulfilling the word amen all of this oh my brother and sister I don't make light of this but I believe it's kind of telling you know that that you'll meet certain Believers and I give them the benefit that out they believe but there's some things I think they need to overcome and and they they're storing up guns and they're storing up ammunition they're storing up food they're storing up gasoline they're storing up all of this and my brother and sister that's not what we're supposed to be storing up what we're supposed to be storing up amen is the word that's it because nothing saved Daniel but God Amen I can see God saying go down there guard him amen and even nature those Lions they knew they knew what that angel was okay let me just finished here right here seven Church age uh smon Church age in the Ephesian age and in this age and in every Age We contemplate we will see that this is true in the last age which is our age we will find the blackout of the word the complete apostasy ending in the Great Tribulation if you are true seed see that's why I feel qualified to use the word if because brother brand just ties it right in here if you are true seed if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat amen no need for us to skip church to make another dollar now let's balance this there circumstances right you have a job and sometimes that's just the way it is but to to choose that's right if you're true seed truly baptized Holy Ghost you'll esteem his word above your necessary meat you'll learn you'll yearn to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God this is my Earnest prayer for all of us may we hear what the spirit is bringing from the word for us today amen this is not an old message my brother and sister I you know sorry to be too transparent here but you know when you have somebody that that is a Critic of the message and their criticism is it's just the same old thing and I thought are they talking about the message or the Bible cuz it's just the same old thing unless you have a new well anyway I won't go there it's the same old thing and if it was so old and wore out it sure works good my I mean maybe it comes down to they just don't make them like they used to you know this word Works amen when Daniel was throwed in the Lion's Den he was a human he didn't come down there on that floor and be like lions beware he was there Lord I trust you I trust you Lord I love you Lord I trust you if this is what you want this is right then and I commit my life to this and I personally believe that when Daniel landed in the bottom of that lon's Den those lines went help us help us there's this little guy over here by the wall and there's a big guy with a flaming sword and uh this doesn't look good for us so I tell you what this goes back in little story in my life I won't share tonight but sometimes when you think there might be a consequence you don't want to sleep you just kind of go over in the corner you pull your blankie up over your eyes and you just go to sleep I've rode with a few people in the car in the winter time and I that's exactly what I did I curled up in the backseat of their car pulled a blankie over my head and it's like Lord if I could just please survive this now reverse that Saints the lions are saying who is this we are afraid and Daniel was down there dancing before the Lions but he wasn't mocking the Lions he was praising Goden let's not put a worldly interpretation of dancing right no Jitterbug he's down there praising God Amen because he realized God had a plan amen sister Ruth I hope I didn't bore you guys this evening just something that was on my heart you know sometimes you just got to share those little things to look at this you know totally Supernatural but at the time it was taking place it so totally looked like a disaster but it was God Amen right in the middle of the chaos saying go ahead Daniel don't resist him don't fight him just walk out there jump down in that Lion's Den I've either got eternity there waiting for you that's it that's it but it's still me and when they drew Daniel out of that Lion's Den there was a king up there that had already cried out to him Daniel do you live y are you alive Daniel I tell you what all of those that had deceived the king I hope you can through the lines here all of those that had deceived the king they were the ones that started to fear that's Hallelujah and I'm telling you the devil today might pull fast one over you and I or someone else but at the end of the day that he sees this bride coming closer and closer to her bridegroom Satan's like hm I thought I could beat this and that's why he goes and praise God the bride's not going to be here no but he doesn't stop cuz he still thinks if he can go down here Gog and Magog and all of these things and all these demons that he's trying to put out and all that he's stirring up you don't think those Spirits aren't at the surface it's just a history lesson if you don't mind for two seconds you don't think those Spirits are not at the surface tell me why you would laun a missile into a place where there's women and children that's nothing but the devil absolutely the devil with an outlet to express his hate and even in the natural here he gets punished for it the man who sent the missile received a Missle eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth I'm glad that the bride doesn't live under that amen otherwise every little person that ever did something that that hurt us we'd be out there trying to hurt them but this is why the word has come and Daniel you notice in the word Daniel didn't send a single one of those men to the lion stand I believe probably Daniel was advocating Mercy for them but the King was like nope what they desired to do to you is what will be done to them let's stand amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen number eight brother Ivan I know it was the blood amen F this song program would be much smaller if we just sang Everything in F I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me oh one day when I was lost he died upon the cross I know it was a blood for me well there's power in the
