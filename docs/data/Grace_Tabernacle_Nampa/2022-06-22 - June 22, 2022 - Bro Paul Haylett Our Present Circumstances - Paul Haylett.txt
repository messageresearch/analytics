evening hallelujah you know it doesn't matter what we face in life we have an answer in the beautiful we have an answer there is no wandering you know sometimes i think the lord just allows these things to come to pass you know you might run into somebody here there and i seem to on quite a bit and they have questions like i don't even know my purpose i'm glad tonight that we know our purpose i'm glad tonight that we can stand here and say it i know god placed me here on the earth today for a particular purpose amen god bless our visitor amen i almost think i should recognize you amen thank you lord i i looked and i thought i should i should well wonderful glad to have you here with us tonight god bless you amen well i want to a couple of things that kind of glossed over there one of them let's remember to pray for little diana did i say that right yeah diana uh she is i don't know if i understand correctly she's a little colic baby i was talking to brother vasily and he's like oh brother paul all the time and i was like we're gonna pray for this little baby amen that just whatever would be afflicting her will just be bound by the word of god amen and i i tried to encourage him as only men could and i said oh don't worry about it she'll outgrow it someday and uh so but we want it to we want the lord to just touch it and then we want to remember brother manasseh i'm not sure what all's happening in his life but anyway we just want to remember him amen i want to speak to you tonight uh on our present circumstances um this is kind of uh definitely a kind of a two two-part thing we're going to kind of speak on part of this as as something referring to and i pray that you take it as encouragement uh to look at our circumstances but we're going to touch on it and then on the second part we will actually move into a realm of where we are as sons and daughters of god and our present circumstance amen i'm glad amen not to sound you know uh you know like we're boasting but i'm glad that god has given us an opportunity to look beyond the circumstance we are facing day by day and look into the circumstance as it were now i'm using that word just a little bit liberal but b be patient or kind to me and and we are not called to look in the circumstance of today in other words if the wheel falls off the wagon that's not what your life is and so we are called as sons and daughters of god let's look into what god has made for us what he has given us as we have this lovely testimony i still have the lovely card that you sent me and i was marveling today as i was changing water and i i just find this so so incredible i was marveling we pray for your baby covet comes i haven't talked to you since but praise the lord we'll have an opportunity to talk so we look at our circumstance now what is our circumstance my circumstances god is present with me my circumstance is not a one of of life is falling apart life is failing uh but mine is one that i see god coming on the scene day after day stirring our lives answering prayers giving encouragement and look increasingly saints the scripture shows us how in the latter times that it would just be chaos on the earth and i think we must be getting close because chaos just rains everywhere but uh we're we're not going to focus on that we're not going to focus on the condition of this world amen uh not what the nations are doing in other words we get all caught up a war here and something there uh we're not going to be focused on what other churches are are doing uh we want to just uh focus on the things that god has for us and so let's just stand as we'd go into uh our bibles and uh we'll just go to ephesians the fifth chapter and the sixth verse and uh want to just draw a thought out of that this evening and um in this uh we know that the word of god is good for doctrine it's good for correction it's good for edification it's good for everything we need amen so ephesians 5 6 let no man deceive you with vain words now we live in a day i hope you don't mind if i just kind of make a couple points here we live in a day that people want to hear the good things correction is not in the house of god right the scripture says there come a day they wouldn't receive correction in the house of god so what people want to hear is words of encouragement how god wants to make you rich the house the pool the bentley but you see that's not what god called christians for god called christians to live the very life and nature of jesus christ in a world that is increasingly dark and so there's what the secret is he didn't come to say i'm going to make you rich he come to say i will save you from your sins amen so it says here for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon children of disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them for ye were sometimes darkness oh aren't you glad he doesn't just leave it there he says but now ye are light in the lord walk as children of light so he gives us a very clear directive for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them now some people say well i i just really wasn't i'm not the kind of person i couldn't you know reprove somebody that was doing something wrong just live the life of jesus christ in front of them we're not here to go march up in people's face and condemn them we're here to live the life where people would come to a place and say there's something different about you and i'd like to know what it is and more than just know what it is would like to have it amen for it is shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light or whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise i probably didn't pronounce that quite correct and redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is let's just pray amen heavenly father lord i just tonight my heart is filled with joy father lord did you see right here witness of your answering of prayer lord jesus right in our midst and lord we said today lord recipients oh lord recipients of the greatest gift that's been given to mankind your life your presence your holy spirit poured into us lord never could we prove ourselves worthy but lord you chose to make us worthy and my heart is rejoicing tonight just ask you to bless your word father let us speak lord in such a fashion that bring glory and honor to you tonight i pray amen amen you may be seated saints amen yeah i know we had quite a few on the list of those that are not with us tonight but the lord be with them wherever they may be today amen i want to draw um from these thoughts here verses um 15 see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise and so as we just touch on that we want to take the definition of the word circumspect it is thinking carefully about possible risks before doing or saying something careful to consider all circumstances and possible consequences now i want to stop right here in that definition right here we're going to take kind of uh oh i hope you don't think it's negative tonight but we're going to take the the opposite side of what we want to conclude with maybe next wednesday and look at this my brother and sister but i want you to consider the consequences of an active prayer life consider the consequences of faith in jesus christ consider the com consequences of trusting him with your life you see there's more than one side we say well we want you to realize now if you make a foolish decision there's consequences i think every parent has told their uh you know coming of age children look there's consequences of your decisions you know think about them carefully act before you do think before you speak and so we look at that but i just want to bring out that little point right there see then you walk uh circumspectly amen examining look at this what is this my life that i'm giving not as fools but as wise and and you see this it is to consider all circumstance possible consequences prudent it is cautious now as we look at this scripture here tonight uh you know how i am saints i i believe that uh as we consider all the circumstance around us uh we we look at that and and we look at the consequences but i i say and have held this my whole life uh you know live life to the fullest and you know people might say oh okay where are you going with this i've decided you know i've said that for a lot of years live life to the fullest but maybe paul needs to add on to the end of that a little caveat would be live life to the fullest in christ not not just in the cares and the pleasures of life to live life to the fullest you know that we got to go we got to always be doing something fun we ought to know there comes a time that we got to realize that what we really were called to do was to live our life the fullest in christ so you know you might tie that with the thought of every promise in the book is mine so will we choose to leave some of these promises on the table because they don't fit or lifestyle they don't fit what we wanted to do and i say let's not do that let's live uh life to the fullest in christ you know what that means though now forgive me i hope this doesn't offend anybody you can own a motorcycle and a camp trailer in a boat in christ you can play now it's not my sport but you can play golf if you want to you can do a lot of things in christ you see people get the idea and it's something very much being peddled to to the younger generation that if you're going to serve god you've got to give up all of this almost like you're being put in prison and you see i think that's just a lie of the devil that he's trying to get people and the idea that serving god is like going to prison but my brother and sister it's actually when you come into christ that you get out of prison and so by god's grace you know we get to come but you see every day my brother and sister as a christian we consider the circumstances around us you know there's times i was just talking with a brother a few days ago and uh he had made a couple statements and stuff on the telephone to me and uh you know i was like ah it's sad to hear this brother say these things but yet the next day he calls me up and says please forgive me for speaking these negative things you see along the way he told me he said when i got down to do my devotions and to pray last night my conscience said you know what you you were you were wrong in what you were saying you you didn't um you didn't really need to say those things and you see sometimes before we speak uh we need to consider this circumstance is this the right place and the right time the right people and you know the consequences i i know some of this will be a little silly tonight but just if you'd bear with me the consequences are if you go out and get in your car without looking behind you when you back up it's a choice and there's a consequence you're on the stop sign as it were there's a consequence and there's lots of signs you know i just want to bring this out i hope you see the humor but the point also so the other night saturday night brother andrew come downstairs uh we had a guest speaker this weekend and and uh we were filling the baptismal for uh uh uh vanessa and um you know a little voice spoke to me uh you you put something here to keep the hose that's filling the baptismal from moving but i ignored that voice and i got brother andrew up here and got him situated in the office and i went back downstairs and somehow i don't know how this happened the hose ended up and you know what it's like when you're looking there and there's a hose pointing up in the air in the middle of the basement floor and so the consequence for me and the point i want to make is there was a voice spoke to me do something about this but i ignored that voice and i'm here to tell you there will be no man that will commit a sin that will not have a voice speak to him in his life don't go there don't do this but we're not talking about voices in the mind we're talking about voices in the soul that speaks to the soul of men it is there my brother and sister that god is coming and he's dealing with us wanting us to live life he's wanting us to go and to do and and to be that but what he really wants the most is for us to listen to the voice so if we listen to the voice you know there's a lot of things that we can be blessed and kept from by listening to the voice and so you know many years ago i believe that was in uh freddie chile that the lord laid on my heart to preach to the young people on the topic of making conscious decisions and uh by god's grace that that has been a very beautiful thought to carry through the years and once again i want to just touch on that you see while we're living life to the fullest and we are living in our present circumstance it is something that is very real for us you don't even have to be a christian to apply this principle but to make a conscious decision you know sometimes we go to church young people i hope you catch this we go to church because mom and dad go to church but we got to come to a place in our life we go to church because we have a relationship with jesus christ and so if we just have a relationship that is tagged on to mom and dad there'll come a day that we are mature uh or theoretically or i guess we would go out and no longer mom and dad will be there as it would censor our decision so we need to learn as children as young people as adults to make a conscious decision what is going to be the result of this decision reminds me of a testimony of a man i consider him a friend and he told me he says paul he said you know i'm so thankful that the lord hid what my life would be after i got saved from me because if before i got saved he had showed me all that i would go to through as a christian he said i'm not sure i could have made that commitment but i didn't know that and i just made a conscious decision i'm going to serve the lord and he gave up his drugs and his alcohol and all of his different things and then as the test and the trial of life come along he was sharing how god would been so faithful to him that he would come face to face with his situations and in that by god's grace he would always choose i'm going to serve god there was reasons it wasn't as though his life had no reason to quit there were reasons to quit there were disappointments there were challenges there was health issues there was marriage issues there was children issues all kinds of things were given to come to a place given up i could just quit but something in him always chose i said i would serve you lord i will serve you it was a conscious decision he made not an emotional one not an educated one not something of reasoning or feelings but it was there that he just made a conscious decision lord i'm going to serve you now in proverbs 16 17 it's a little hard maybe to read but the highway of the upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul and so it's there in a conscious decision one would come to the place now life is reckoned as a highway and you know let's face it my brother and sister you go out here to the freeway tonight and you've got a choice you can go to caldwell or you can go to meridian and uh those decisions are revocable at some other point in time isn't always nice just to get on the freeway the direction you're going and um so i could tell you a kind of a humorous story about a uh a pair of truck drivers team driving and they pulled into um a truck stop at night and and it was time to switch drivers so they fueled and the one had been asleep in the bunk when they pulled into the truck stop and uh you know they fueled up washed the windows got a little bite to eat and they changed the other guy was tired he climbed in the bunk this guy gets in the truck does his little inspection clicks the seat belt pulls out on the highway goes down the on-ramp only he didn't know that the on-ramp until they're going along and about two hours later the other guy pulls the curtain back and looks up where are we sees a sign and goes oh no stop we're going the wrong direction you see the conscious decision sometimes is very unconscious he didn't get on a highway got on the freeway but he wasn't going the right direction and sometimes we think that that everything's okay you know uh it's there that god has chosen now i think this is so beautifully because when you look at the word just as we experienced this weekend was that not good amen that was just really really good so you see our way of who we are right the result of our conscious decision is expressed in the revealed word of god we're not going to go out here and take some kind of a socialist or some kind of that wasn't really the word i was meaning but you know theoretical or whatever taken somebody's explaining that we don't know if there's god well i'm sorry i know tonight there is a god i know that we have a prayer answering god a god that gives answers not only in the natural for healing or whatever it might be but a god that answers the questions of the bible for us and gives us a revelation as it were which is a revealed word brought out that we can see what it is and by that it changes our life but we have to make that conscious decision you see people can live good lives that's the problem i want to sound like i'm down on any religion tonight but people live good lives churches preach and tell people live good lives be charitable help that is all well and good you can live a good life and raise good kids and feel like this is a sign that you're in god's pleasure but the word of god says you're in god's pleasure when you're obedient to his word that's where god finds pleasure enoch did not find pleasure and pleasing in the eyes of god because enoch was the nicest man in the neighborhood enoch found a pleasure and was pleasing to god because he lived god's word day by day and did not as it were bring a reproach upon the gospel but just lived it out and he didn't have to manufacture that isn't that the neatest part don't have to manufacture it you get in the bible you pray you ask god to move you and in that realm right there god starts to work does anybody know what i'm talking about god starts to work and all of a sudden little things start changing in our life and where maybe we once had a fear it's gone we had a frustration it's gone and god starts to answer prayer and people say what's going on with you well you know it's kind of like the little room you go in there you come out what happened i don't know something changed in my life we cannot explain what god is doing in our life other than the fact that the things that used to be a deterrent a hindrance a mard or life are disappearing they're going away and the power of god starts to reign and when you ever have and i know you have pray to prayer and watch god almost instantly answer that prayer now let's not get an expectation that god's always obligated to instantly answer a prayer but it's there that when god speaks to you in these situations you know that you actually have a god's ear if you would put it that way you know god is is listening and cares about your situation and so it's there that it's not uh uh uh as though because we're good people now i just want to ask you i'm trying to break this habit but you know how many of us have ever when something went wrong decided god was mad at us i talked to a man one day told me i've been in church in years and he i said well why why would you just up and quit church he said because we had a need in our family and i prayed and god never answered it so he really didn't have a trust in god right he was expecting god to do what he wanted when he wanted it that's not really a trust right no more than giving your kids everything they ask for in life is a sign of love and i asked him i said have you ever thought that it was actually for your benefit that god did not answer your prayer and he basically said that's beside the point he wasn't willing see he thought god should just answer his prayer when he asked it now i want to just throw this out here if if you don't mind you see it's god's pleasure uh is in the expression of his word that's where god's pleasure is so when we are living to the very best of our ability right we're not talking about some legalist thing just toe the mark toe the mark to the mark but when we're living the word to the best of our abilities and we are there and we are living that out in other words if it tells you you know what you've got a temper in your family you need deliverance from that you claim that deliverance god comes gets rid of that and that becomes starts to become an expression of god's word in you and you have certain little issues or things as it is thorns in the flesh and god deals with that that's an expression of god in you and so as we'll see that now as a good times and blue skies are not a sign of god's pleasure and dark skies are not a sign of his displeasure but the pleasure that god has in you and i is when he sees us living his word my isn't that i'll bring this down those of you not a parent won't understand this but there's nothing makes a parent happier than when you teach your children to do a certain thing and then unbidden you look in their life and see them performing that now we can use a very simple example you teach your little one clean your room put your laundry in the basket and now if you have to go in there every day and boy i sure hope i'm not hitting on some of these kids but if you go in there every day and you have to nag your child to do that it brings a displeasure but if you go and look in their room and they have put their books away their toys away their clothes away parents does that not bring just a little warmth in your in your breast it just you know like yes my children are listening and so those of you don't do that start and so you look at this and some feel that uh you know if they're living under a sign of god's pleasure they have nothing to worry about but god wants to see his word manifested in you and i he wants to see us living out the word it's much more than don't lie cheat or steal it's to live out the very nature of christ through the word through you there's where it comes down that's that's where you can be kind to people who revile you that's where you can you can do good when evil is present and you can pray for those who revile you you know that's actually a lot harder than we think to come when someone is just almost evil to you to then lift them up in prayer and make it a priority to lift them up in prayer and remember them and say lord please change their life do something for them so it's uh this bible aren't you glad it's not a dead letter i am glad tonight this bible is not a dead letter there is not one word that pertains to a christian there's a lot of words in the bible that we're not called to fulfill you know that we're not called to go and join with the devil in the pit we're not called to lie cheat steal all these other things we're not called to be filled with these spirits of torment and anxieties and fears so there's a lot of things in the word of god we're not called to but for us to be able to fulfill every word of god that's been promised to us is going to take more than you have in you it's going to take more than your ability or your intellect it's going to take god coming down and moving in your life changing you and propelling you along reminds me when my son well actually probably all of my children but when my son was little and he'd say daddy i want to go with you to check water but you know you'd get out there and and it's just a child he didn't want to follow dad down the field he wanted to lead dad down the field and you know he'd get there and get a hold of a siphon tube and he would be trying to set that siphon tube and if i had waited my brother and sister till he figured it out we would have been there still well maybe not now but anyway you know and so what do you do you have to then come and you have to take your child in your arms and you have to go through all the motions with him telling him what to do will not be sufficient to teach him you have to go through the motions with him and i hope you catch where i'm at tonight god is going through the motions of living a holy and righteous life with us he didn't just say here's the book read it go live it he is here present with us each and every day in every can we say every every circumstance and he's right there with his arms around us showing us teaching us and and caring for us i couldn't tell you just to finish that little analogy i can't tell you how many times through those particular years that i had to reach out and grab my son by the back of his shirt to keep him from falling in the ditch and i'll tell you what i have felt the hand of god in my life keep me from falling so many times and that i couldn't even recount them to you because he cares and he's there and he says paul or whoever it might be i'm gonna show you what it's like to be a real christian i'm gonna show you what it's like to know my presence and and know what my desires are i'm gonna show you i'm not just giving you a book to read can someone say amen hallelujah see not a dead letter but a living word amen you see regardless as the scripture says regardless of our situation saints the keeping of the things of god is the preservation of our soul there's no other refuge we have we don't have a refuge in religion my brother and sister that's a problem the world has today they say religion fails you and i have to agree with them because if we recount and just go to back to the place that we start in religion we can be good whatever church you want to talk about but that will not change you my now so we want to preserve our soul do we not that's why we that's why we serve god that's why we come to church that's why we fellowship in the groups that we fellowship in is because we're desiring this preservation or eternal life of our soul now we know scripturally that if another branch is ever put out then it will be another book of acts it is not going to be another creed another dogma it's going to be another book of acts and so as we look through the scripture and we see what is manifested in the book of acts now my brother and sister as we were here this lovely time with brother andrew we look at this my brother and sister we say well praise the lord just paul paul's back in the pulpit paul's not andrew no andrew would already pass the 10 000 words by now but my brother and sister the same god that was in the upper room is in this room and we just have to choose whether we're going to let the god that's in the upper room be in this room and do something in our life if we were in the upper room would we have chosen to completely die to ourselves and surrender and let god take control of us that we no longer had any shame any confusion any reservation those are the things we struggle with is it not how many times have we in our life come face to face with an opportunity to testify jesus christ and we tell ourselves that's not really the time that's not the place well i don't know where it is i mean you know i read a story here some time back where a man standing next to another man in a subway station asking are you a christian and the man says well i was when i was younger and the man says well how much older you have to be and he led the man right there knelt down in a subway station on the floor and people walking around and calling names catcalls jeers but he didn't care that's right he didn't care because there was something that compelled the man to ask the man are you a christian oh i can't do that's not the time to play subway station 30 seconds to talk to the men hey there'll be another train you'll make it home but you see oftentimes we give ourselves the reason why we can't not the time not the place let's not let that happen you realize satan now that doesn't mean we go on the subway station and you know ease them up to the edge of the tracks and you know hang them out over there you're going to be a christian or not that's not what it's about it's living the life and there was sincerity when the man said are you a christian he said i was when i was younger or whatever i said why how old do you have to do to to come back you see he never condemned the man he give opportunity and that's what we want to do that's what god's callings give opportunity and i think it's so interesting tonight you know in in times past as it is on a ditch bank we had opportunity our sister you know walking having a baby she's exercising a lovely time something i hold very precious in my life to see there that we have a time and stand on a ditch bank and talk about the things of god and how faithful god is and that he's made promises and we see an evidence i hope you don't mind me using this tonight but we see an evidence of god eavesdropping if you want to say on a conversation and we're testifying we believe god is a healer we believe he's a provider and we believe he believes in life and so we're claiming it amen it's not that we just say well whatever they say or what someone says or what it might ever be i believe a god who is a changer amen he's changed my place in life he's changed my position in life he changed my mind he changed my heart and i believe my god can change amen anything hallelujah oh but you see my brother and sister the bible saying another branch would be another book of acts but we have to become a part of the expression of the book of acts we can't sit back and say well praise the lord god's going to come down fill people with the holy ghost in the latter days and they're going to live for the lord and they're going to be witnesses praise the lord that's for them no it's for me it's for you i'm claiming my place in the expression of the book of acts because i am oh hallelujah can we say tonight i am one of them i am not just a person going to church i am one of them i'm a part of the economy of god in other words god made this circumstance fit we think oh i'm going through life and and my job is difficult this is difficult uh you know that's difficult you realize that god has specifically designed every circumstance of your life to bring a particular outcome in your life you say oh but i have had sickness i've had this troubles i've had that my brother and sister the word of god says that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord and we can't take any other position or we're denying the word of god now if god said i want you to go down this path in life and it's not an easy path it's a hard path it'll be a challenge to your faith my brother and sister we ought to look up and say lord you put enough faith in me for it to be challenged it is not a pushover i don't need you to sugarcoat it as a song i i thought that was wonderful we sang that song and i don't need it sugar coated i don't need someone to and i have something profound for you tonight god is love no i want a god i already know i already know his love i want a god to come on the scene and he loves me enough he says and if i love y'all chasing you well well i didn't i didn't ask for that i was asking for the blessings well i would say that being chastened by god is a blessing amen you know if we're headed the wrong direction want somebody to say you're going the wrong direction come back amen but you see not our good deeds it's a word being expressed this bible is a living bible saints amen now i want to go right here in the chapter 5 church age when any man turns from the word of god and joins a church now see to our visitor this is totally contrary to the business plan of every church on the face of the earth join our church join our church there's one church to join and that's the church of our lord jesus christ that body amen it is not something that we get special benefits and preferred parking oh come on i'm not kidding with you there's churches that if you meet certain criteria you can be eligible for preferred parking so you don't have to park way out there on the horizon on sunday you can park right by the door find that in the bible for me sounds hard don't it when any man turns to the word of god and joins a church instead of receiving the holy spirit that man dies dead that is what he is don't join a church don't get into organization and get taken up with creeds tradition anything that takes the place of the word and the spirit or you're dead it's all over you're dead reminds me it's an interesting story and i very much applaud them that um this took place i believe it was kansas on a sunday morning the lady was oh my paul recollect i believe the lady was 82 or 3 years old and she got an award from the church big plaque what not uh she hadn't missed a service in that church in 75 years y'all looking at me like so what hope you don't think i'm rude do you think that guaranteed her eternal life i think it's wonderful she didn't miss a service in all those years she their family moved to that church and she grew up she was a part of all the sunday school summer uh bible school and she got married in that church raised her children in that church buried her husband in that church but none of that makes any difference that plaque that plaque won't make any difference we've got to get something more out of church than on a word for attendance that's right it's all over your dead eternally separated from god that's what happened in every age sense god delivers the people that come out by the blood sanctified by the word walk through the waters of baptism get filled with the spirit but after a while the first love cools off that's what the scripture speaks of my brother and sister through all of those ages you'll see the same thing being repeated in the book of revelations 2 3 you'll see that every time they're coming to a place and then they start to cool off the first love cools off someone gets the idea that they ought to organize in order to preserve themselves well there's a way to be preserved but it's not by organizing and then telling everybody this is who we are right you see my brother and sister it's in the living word is the preservation it's in the living word that's burning within our soul that's changing our life day by day is where the preservation is at it is not in our attendance or such but you see whenever in the book of revelation speaking of this and the cooling off that is taking place the scripture says i would that you would be hot or cold because you're lukewarm i'll spew you out of my mouth and so god have more respect for someone who is completely cold like i don't know i don't believe there is a god then he will have for someone who is a lukewarm christian just going to church just going through the motions and so it's there that god makes it very clear to us get on fire get hot let it be real to you let it change your life give god permission to change your life not god's not going to come in right he's a gentleman he's not going to come in and force his way into your life we've got to open the door open the windows as it were say lord here take me i belong to you so they got to organize it to preserve it and they make a name for themselves and they organize themselves right back into the second generation sometimes even before then and they're no longer have the spirit of god just a form of worship they're dead they have high red eyes themselves with creed and form and there's no life in them now i don't mean to point at our little visitor uh uh um uh shy but shai is kind of interesting those of you met shai you'll know she's not shy and um but but it was interesting when shai first visited a couple sundays ago that she come and she says i've visited almost every church in the city of nampa and some of them the lights it was dark and they were in there and all things happening she said i didn't even stay five minutes because that's not church now this is not coming from us this is coming from i don't know i'll get myself in trouble here older that's the answer that's the way to describe it from an older lady that's not church she said i visited a church down the road here the music was so loud she said you know jokingly i'm almost a little deaf but it was too loud for me and i left there and i went over here and i went down here and i went over here and i'm because i'm looking for something where i feel the presence of god now it might sound like we're boasting my brother and sister and i don't mean it that way but when you have people looking for the presence of god and they're discerning the spirit around them and saying this is not the presence of god but it's got the name of a church over the door did that make any difference it don't make any difference the presence of god goes where he is welcomed and his word is open to be manifested in the people he's not looking for just being called god he's not looking for just something of that nature because it's there that god is looking for the life that he has placed in you to be manifested and where he is invited he comes and makes himself known people say we invited god to church but they have all of their different things that won't fit within the confines of the word of god you sure picked a knight to come to church they don't fit within the confines of this word and they want to call it religion and they want to say we're a church of of god not meaning the denomination but we're a church but it don't fit it won't fit you can't bend it you can't twist it you can't smash it to fit in there and yet they make that claim and my brother and sister i'm not being credit critical i'm telling you this is what the bible says this is what the word says and so it's there that we want to come and we don't want to have just a form of worship right the scripture says that they would be cold and formal having a form of godliness but denying power you know where the power comes oh certainly if we're going to sound important it's got to come from the preacher at the pulpit absolutely not the power comes through the life of the people of the congregation living out the life of jesus christ and coming with their lives washed by the water of the word desiring more of god not just a couple minutes to let us go but they want more of god i want to be more like god and so there what is it i'm crying out you could put it in these words counter type to this i want to have life in me lord i want to have life in me if i need to pray for my baby i want my god to hear my prayer i don't want to have to repent and recount all the things i've done wrong forever and ever before i can pray i know i want to live a life that if i have a need right now to call on the lord that he'd say that's my child that's my daughter that's my son amen that's one of mine right there amen i hope you don't mind me being so bold today amen now look at this what's happening is in this realm there is things that god has given to us to preserve us in our present circumstance god has not just left us here you know years ago been brought back to our memory today we had some visitors pass through town and and years ago you know jerry and i was in africa and uh i don't know what paul was thinking sometimes paul doesn't think that's a secret um but we had seen all these were those baboons that were in the trees when i climbed out of the rig i was like i want to get over here and take a picture of that big old dude here's this big male baboon up in the tree and i'm like i want to take a picture of him i opened the door and i stepped out brother gideon was our guide he's like paul get back in here like a good boy i'm back in the car what something out there what you don't realize is that baboon can cover that 50 yards between you and that tree before you could have turned around to even climb in this vehicle and then he wanted to make it real i hope this isn't too strong for anyone and he says it's only been a month or two ago that one of those ripped a man's face off i'm like lock the door that's the world we live in saints how do we preserve ourselves we get back in the word we stay in the word we don't get out we don't even give the devil an opportunity remember the story of the little girl used to be the dancer then she's walking stops at the door now she gave her heart to the lord and she meant it do you get that she meant it she wasn't playing games she meant it but she stopped outside the door and the music and all of the activity drew her back to a time that she knew wasn't good for her she knew it was death but she stayed there long enough when she come to her senses she's in the arms of some boy dancing in the floor and she comes back and says you know what i've sinned away my day of grace but she just needed someone to remind her no you haven't but let this be a lesson we can't go and flirt with the devil and not expect to get bit we can't expect to get off scot-free so what do we do we have to stop look at our circumstance my brother and sister we live in a world there's all kinds of temptations and the cell phone and all of this stuff has just made it that much worse and so it's there but we have to stop and look at that and say you know what the devil might you know offer something kind of beautiful you've got to stop and say if i do this what is the consequence now if we walk into sin there's a consequence and if you walk in to the grace of god there's a consequence we just have to stop and decide which one of these consequences that we want to face that we want to live in and i'm telling you saints and i'm not proud of this and i hope you guys don't throw me out on my ear or at least don't throw me out on my head i don't know i've made decisions and when the consequence comes i cried out to god oh forgive me forgive me but you realize we come to this place if we'll just stay in the spirit right live in the spirit live under the anointing under the influence and stop nothing has to happen that sudden what is the consequence what is the consequence of this over here i just read a heartbreaking story a few days ago a young man fentanyl is invading our nation and this young man had never done drugs in his life let a friend talk him into taking some fentanyl one time he's dead the kid who introduced it to him had been on it for two years but one time peter just stopped and said what is it i'm young and he he was quite a handsome young man i'm young i'm handsome i'm athletic i have good parents i if you look at what does drugs have to offer what is sin out here what does the world have to offer when christ said i died for you and i give everything you need to come and live in my presence see how slippery satan is so he comes and he offers us and we start to do this and start to do this and i find it so remarkable because i know grown men who slip into these patterns it's not just a child's thing grown men i mean i i'll just be kind of blunt i know of a man who recently just threw his marriage away for someone that wasn't half the lady his wife was never thought the consequence they towed us down the reservoir when our outboard motor blew up i was kind of shocked i'm like i know you but you see my brother and sister stop that's all i my whole theme tonight stop look around you circumspect what am i doing and what will it bring to me if i have devotions and read the bible and pray with my family what's it going to do for me if we play video games until we're exhausted and go to bed and that's the culture we introduce to our family what is the consequence of that right we just measure these things and and and since you know me i'm not trying to force no idea on no one but just measure every part of our life and hold it up circumspectly what will happen amen when i do this one thing i know in case somebody can enlighten me i have not found a negative consequence yet for putting god first isn't that amazing that you can do something like that devotions prayer with your family read the bible and uh you know do that and there's not one negative consequence in closing i just want to share something that uh i i have for years come across and and to i say this in in a realm of to each his own ev everyone can do what you want but you know you toss the television out and a guy a friend of mine the other day is like uh um well did you watch this and i was like no he goes well they're going to redo that here in a week it's going to be on hbo or something and you can catch it then and i said yeah i probably won't he goes are you not interested i said no i don't have a television he's like are you serious he goes why not and i said well for one i prefer to read and two i'm not hungry enough yet to go climb in the dumpster to find a cheeseburger and he says well you're sure right about that you have to go through a lot of garbage to find something good to watch anyway i couldn't help it he's good enough friend david i walked over to close to him and i'm like he's like what are you doing and i said well obviously you've been in the dumpster i just wanted to see what you smelled like but what is the consequence look at our nation i don't mean to go into the political whatever here but look at our nation they wonder what's going wrong we've been feeding our kids out of the dumpster and we didn't look at the consequence of feeding our children from the dumpster let's look at every decision saints as we close just look at what we're doing in our life you know i have to admit uh brother andrew's ministry touched me so much in a certain aspect of my life the other day it motivated me to do something and i look at that and sometimes when you go to do these things they're not easy to do but i with this thought in mind i looked at that and i thought you know if i do this is this good for me or bad for me well it was hands down it's good for me it's good for me i'm gonna step forward i'm gonna find the courage to do what i need to do because it's going to bring a positive result in my life and my relationship with my wife and it's going to bring me forward make me a better man so therefore i had to gather up a little courage and i had to go take care of a couple little things that needed to be took care of and in the end such relief such relief and i know i've done the right thing oh we'll just stop right here i just um just want to do this because there's quite a bit there's quite a bit more and it's kind of all tied together and we'll have ample opportunity i just want to bring forth um one one little scripture let's go to psalms 27 and um you know i love this it's such a beautiful scripture a psalm of david the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid isn't that lovely to be able to make a declaration like that when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell now did david cause them to stumble and fall i'm not going to play trickery with you but yes he did and just be patient with me you know why it was david because if david had not allowed the lord to be the light had not allowed the lord to be his salvation if david had thought he could operate in his own strength if david had taken these positions he would never been able to make this declaration now come back that i've kind of put that before you no man can do this of his own no man has ever overcome on his own no man has has brought god on the scene right god called us god's the one who saved us that god is the one who's provided for us he is our sword our shield our buckler so i hope you caught what i was saying but you see it took david being submitted to god to bring that to pass if he had come as arrogant and rebellious he would have never found that favor in the eyes of god but because he did come in the way that pleased god when the need come in his life when his enemies my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell and though a host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me that's the world we live in saints come on come on we live in a world where everything is just glorified perversion is glorified where evil is raised up and good is cast down that's the day we live in so there's the host what is it the devil camping against them my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord now you can take this any way you want but david did not keep that desire silent people say well i just i don't i'm not comfortable get it out make sure the lord knows what your desire is well he knows my mind and heart he wants to hear it off of your lips he wants your praise he wants your glory he wants you to lift it up he wants to hear your prayer even if it's a prayer of travail he wants to hear your prayer one thing that i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple i want to ask you what is the consequence of this right here is there a negative consequence someone who doesn't desire god would say well i can't do this and i can't do that i can't do that well i'm sorry i mean it's fine i mean i can introduce you to tens of thousands of people that somehow have survived without that survived without going to the the flesh pots and the hell holes as they describe them they survived without that isn't that amazing they're not necessary for life and god has come and given us this opportunity to stop and take everything in our life and hold it up and say lord what is the consequence of this decision if i decide to serve you lord what would be the consequence of that lord if i don't serve you what is the consequence well i can show you what god said the consequence was for both of those tonight saints says jamie would you come tonight my whole thought tonight i just want to encourage you stop amen and look at the consequences look circumspectly not as a fool but as a wise man hallelujah if you don't mind just a tad bit of humor i reading the scripture of redeeming the time and i'm redeeming about 10 minutes amen yeah let's just stand sing a song or two before we go tonight i i trust you know not a big magnificent stirring thing but you know the scripture you're looking at in israel as they're rebuilding watchmen what of the night it's got to be someone that's willing to stand up and say look saints if you don't think this isn't getting crazy you don't think this is getting out of line you just look when it comes to all this alternative lifestyle stuff and lower courts saying the schools can do this the schools can teach this it takes people suing them and dragging them to the higher courts to finally overcome a school district a man was just telling me here a couple days ago of a school district back east that took their children to a drag queen show school they need to know [Music] well i'll tell you what they need to know they need to know that god is real they need to have jesus christ in their life but you see that's the world we live in so parents well god bless you i'll just quit right there amen in the presence jay help me hallelujah [Music] prince of peace [Music] troubles [Music] in the press [Music] in and out of situations [Music] all day long i strive for the answers that i need then i come into his prayers all my questions become clear and for that sacred moment all my doubts just disappeared in the present [Music] god almighty peace [Music] in the presence through his love the lord provided [Music] place for us to rest a place to find the in the answers of distress now there's never any reason to tell you just slip away and breathe his name he will surely presence [Music] god almighty and hearts are amended in the presence of the kings unto thee oh lord [Music] let's just praise the lord with just another song or two before we go amen hallelujah this song just struck me it it is really what i was trying maybe i should have just had him put the song up and we could have been home early but it's there my brother and sister see the only place only refuge we've got the only hope we've got the only life we've got is in jesus christ not in a form but in the reality of who he is [Music] do i lift [Music] oh up do i lift up my soul oh my god [Music] let me not be ashamed if not my enemies triumph over me show me thy ways teach me thy path show me thy way teach me thy power oh my god i trust in me let me not be ashamed of my enemies triumph over me remember [Music] the sins of my youth the remember of my youth oh my god [Music] me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me on the path of the lord [Music] mercy and truth all the paths of the lord [Music] our mercy and truth oh my god i trust in thee let me not be ashamed and have mercy upon

not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me let integrity and righteousness preserve me let integrity and uprighteous preserve me oh my god i trust in me let me not be ashamed that not my enemies triumph over me hallelujah can we say him into that i should have just sang that song and we'd have had the whole sermon right there and done god bless you all free if you have a moment i'd like to greet you in the foyer so good to see you amen god bless you saints let's come back sunday and just remember pray for one another it's prayer that changes things and just lift one another up you know we might look at our our young people and say well they don't have any problems well you realize the whole world's geared to turn them another path the whole world's geared to get them to make a different decision let's pray that god would anoint them to stop look make a conscious decision and if paul gets to express what paul wants which sounds selfish but i'm not selfish i promise you i'm not selfish i want to see everyone serve god filled with the holy ghost amen living life to the fullest god bless you all today amen [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
