[20:10] traveling
[20:12] and so we just want the lord to be with
[20:13] her keep her safe
[20:15] and that journey amen i'm assuming are
[20:17] you going back to ukraine
[20:19] yes so it's just going to go see family
[20:22] and
[20:22] just pray the lord be with her all the
[20:24] way amen

[20:40] week amen
[20:41] and you know saints i i know that
[20:44] we do and these things but
[20:46] when
[20:47] there are those of the body that are not
[20:49] with us we should pray
[20:51] you might say double for them to the
[20:54] lord just be with them
[20:56] and
[20:56] so we want to pray for grace and pray
[20:58] for brother manasseh just want him to
[21:01] amen just do well in school
[21:04] our sister sue
[21:05] asked that we would list lift her up in
[21:08] prayer she's uh
[21:10] not feeling well this morning and still
[21:12] fighting congestion so we want to
[21:14] remember her
[21:16] and we want to pray
[21:18] oh i always i always just get names so
[21:21] wrong but
[21:24] [Music]
[21:26] greta silva
[21:28] is that correct
[21:33] see i always mess that up
[21:35] so um brother sergey's
[21:37] uh we'll be traveling today but the
[21:40] family is not well this morning and we
[21:42] we just know that a little sickness has
[21:44] been going through there
[21:47] in the family with the children so we
[21:48] just
[21:49] [Music]
[21:51] just want to remember them
[21:53] our sister temlingson and flagstaff
[21:57] has passed away we just want to remember
[21:59] the family
[22:00] you know it shows us how fleeting life
[22:03] is saints because it's just been a very
[22:06] very short while that she started having
[22:08] some pains and went to the doctor
[22:10] and the doctor's
[22:12] diagnosis is that she was clear full of
[22:14] cancer it had just traveled
[22:18] to all parts of her body
[22:20] but the beauty of this my brother and
[22:22] sister
[22:24] is
[22:26] that there's no crying there's no
[22:28] weeping there's no
[22:30] begging
[22:32] but a life lived for christ
[22:35] is ready
[22:36] at any moment any time any place and god
[22:40] granted time for their family to come
[22:42] together and to love one another and
[22:45] just celebrate her life but let's
[22:48] continue to remember the family in
[22:50] prayer
[22:51] and
[22:52] we want to remember brother bob and
[22:54] sister joanne always remember them
[22:58] and prayer lord just keep strengthening
[22:59] them
[23:00] brother jason of course my brother
[23:03] sergey
[23:04] and i have an unspoken request which is
[23:06] quite broad because there's several
[23:08] situations that
[23:09] are
[23:11] contained within this
[23:14] it's not really unspoken it's just many
[23:16] saints
[23:18] families have decisions that they need
[23:20] to make and
[23:21] these decisions have an impact on
[23:24] the days coming weeks months
[23:27] and
[23:28] so my unspoken request is just to pray
[23:31] for one another that the lord would help
[23:34] us make decisions that we must make
[23:37] amen
[23:38] and just to come and family relations
[23:41] financial different things like that
[23:43] just uh asked that the lord would come
[23:46] and just touch us
[23:48] brother pershanta don't mean to put you
[23:49] on the spot but would you come and pray
[23:51] for these requests this morning and
[23:53] we're so happy to have brother priscilla
[23:55] and sister according to with us amen and
[23:58] that part of the body that seemed to be
[24:00] missing has reappeared and
[24:03] we are just so happy
[24:05] to have them with us today
[24:08] [Music]
[24:11] [Applause]
[24:14] it's really good to see you all and
[24:20] let's pray for all these prayer requests
[24:22] it's just not me praying but all of you
[24:24] all of us praying
[24:27] [Music]

[44:24] turn with me to philippians chapter 3.
[44:32] it's good to be in the house of god
[44:38] brother jason is listening there's a lot
[44:41] easier ways to get a break
[44:47] i hope the lord touches his body amen
[44:50] philippians chapter 3 verse 10.
[45:02] pick up here paul in the middle of a
[45:04] sermon
[45:05] that i may know him and the power of his
[45:07] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[45:09] sufferings being made conformable unto
[45:12] his death
[45:13] if by any means i might attain unto the
[45:16] resurrection of the dead
[45:18] not as though i had already attained
[45:21] either were already perfect but i follow
[45:23] after
[45:25] if that i may apprehend
[45:27] that for which also i am apprehended of
[45:30] christ jesus brethren i cannot
[45:33] count not myself to have apprehended but
[45:36] this one thing i do forgetting those
[45:38] things which are behind and reaching
[45:40] forth under those things which are
[45:41] before
[45:42] i press toward the mark for the prize of
[45:44] the high calling of god
[45:46] in christ jesus
[45:48] in matthew 11.
[46:12] eleven verse 28
[46:15] but we're gonna start in 27
[46:18] uh apologies to the overhead guys
[46:21] all things are delivered unto me of my
[46:22] father and no man knoweth the son but
[46:26] the father
[46:27] neither knoweth any man the father save
[46:29] the son
[46:30] and he to
[46:31] whomsoever the son will reveal him
[46:35] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[46:37] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[46:39] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[46:42] for i am meek and lowly in my in heart
[46:46] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[46:49] for my yoke is easy
[46:51] and my burden is light amen isaiah 53.
[47:09] isaiah 53
[47:14] verse 2 to 10
[47:16] and then i will
[47:17] let you have your seats
[47:20] for he shall grow up before him as a
[47:22] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[47:24] ground
[47:25] he hath no form nor calmlyness that
[47:29] communist and when we shall see him
[47:31] there is no beauty that we should desire
[47:33] him
[47:34] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[47:36] of sorrows and acquainted with grief
[47:39] his we hid as it were our faces from him
[47:42] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[47:45] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[47:47] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[47:49] him stricken smitten of god
[47:51] and afflicted
[47:52] but he was wounded for our
[47:54] transgressions he was bruised for our
[47:56] iniquities
[47:58] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[48:00] him and with his stripes we are healed
[48:02] amen all we like sheep have gone astray
[48:04] we have turned everyone to his own way
[48:07] and the lord hath laid on him the
[48:08] iniquity of us all
[48:10] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[48:12] yet he opened not his mouth
[48:14] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[48:16] and as a sheep before her shearers is
[48:18] dumb so he openeth not his mouth
[48:21] he was taken from prison and from
[48:23] judgment and who shall declare his
[48:25] generation for he was cut off
[48:28] out of the land of the living for the
[48:30] transgression of my people was he
[48:32] stricken
[48:33] and he made his grave with the wicked
[48:34] and with the rich in his death because
[48:36] he had done no violence neither was any
[48:38] deceit in his mouth
[48:41] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he
[48:44] hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[48:46] make his soul an offering for sin he
[48:48] shall see his seed he shall prolong his
[48:50] days and the pleasure of the lord to
[48:52] prosper in his hands
[48:54] may the lord have a blessing to the
[48:55] reading of his word may be seated this
[48:56] morning
[49:02] the uh
[49:04] kind of have to read it all
[49:05] but the main
[49:07] the main scriptures the main thing there
[49:09] is
[49:10] jesus paid it all
[49:13] he didn't leave anything no that's right
[49:15] behind
[49:16] he's not a per uh he's not a man that he
[49:18] could do such a thing
[49:20] he's perfect yeah amen and uh we read in
[49:23] matthew
[49:25] my yoke is easy and my burden is
[49:26] alliance
[49:27] uh title this morning is
[49:30] my uncle our pastor will probably have a
[49:32] chuckle with this is easy has a cost
[49:35] amen
[49:36] i hadn't thought of this until
[49:38] he mentioned well that should that would
[49:40] make a good sermon the other day and
[49:42] i was sitting last night studying and
[49:45] i had a totally different title and a
[49:47] totally different subject or so i
[49:48] thought but that was just the way the
[49:50] lord was going to push me into the
[49:52] scriptures and into the message and i
[49:54] was sitting there just thinking over
[49:56] what i had read and the notes i had
[49:57] written down i looked up and on my
[49:59] blackboard in my office i have this
[50:01] written easy has a cost
[50:03] and it just struck me that was the
[50:05] perfect subject
[50:07] and exactly what
[50:08] the lord was pushing me towards last
[50:10] night so we trust that he had his way
[50:13] this morning
[50:15] i read this scripture uh in philippians
[50:17] here over and over again last night
[50:20] just
[50:22] you know there's
[50:23] so much
[50:24] in
[50:25] the bible yes and there's so much in
[50:27] paul's letters
[50:29] the book of romans
[50:31] is just i've always said it is every
[50:33] verse is just packed full
[50:36] and sometimes we in our reading
[50:39] catch different things because the word
[50:41] of god is alive
[50:43] and when we're in certain seasons
[50:45] certain things speak to us but i just
[50:47] began to read over this
[50:49] several times and and just asking the
[50:51] lord that we would i would soak it up
[50:53] because i knew there was something in
[50:55] there that was
[50:56] starting to to manifest and come to to
[50:59] my attention
[51:00] and so i took the word apprehend and and
[51:02] paul says that i i follow after if that
[51:05] i may apprehend
[51:07] that for which also i am apprehended of
[51:11] christ jesus i know we can turn it down
[51:13] a little bit up here
[51:14] but apprehend uh the definition is
[51:16] arrest for a crime
[51:18] understand or perceive
[51:20] um but
[51:22] the apprehension is where that word
[51:24] comes from and that means to a rest so
[51:28] apprehend us to arrest the rest of our
[51:29] attention
[51:30] arrest um
[51:33] our focus strong
[51:35] concordance for that word in that
[51:36] scripture is to lay hold of so as to
[51:38] make one's own
[51:40] to obtain to
[51:42] to obtain
[51:43] attain to
[51:45] to make one's own to take into oneself
[51:49] appropriate appropriate
[51:51] so paul's desire in this scripture is
[51:54] that
[51:56] that he would apprehend
[51:58] that
[52:00] the bible that the word that should be
[52:02] all cap all caps
[52:04] because it's the thing that has fully
[52:07] apprehended paul already
[52:10] he says also for that that for which i
[52:14] also i am apprehended of christ jesus so
[52:18] the one thing that that that
[52:21] would bring out it would be christ
[52:24] what
[52:25] christ has in store
[52:27] the revelation of christ paul's desire
[52:30] is to apprehend a rest to have full
[52:33] focus full
[52:35] full
[52:36] uh
[52:37] from uh full take of it full partake
[52:41] of the thing that has already
[52:44] apprehended him and that thing that is
[52:47] of christ so before i get too far ahead
[52:50] of myself you know
[52:52] this happens to be their our last
[52:54] service of the year
[52:56] uh aside from our fellowship uh new
[52:58] year's eve and um the last sunday of the
[53:00] year
[53:02] and uh as as we all do and i i hope we
[53:04] all do we it's always good to reflect we
[53:06] don't have to do it at the end of the
[53:07] year we should always reflect on our
[53:10] life and the past what behind us but my
[53:12] title being easy has a cost over the
[53:15] past year where did you take the easy
[53:17] route
[53:19] where would you be today if you hadn't
[53:21] right
[53:23] whether that be in your health you know
[53:25] it's easier
[53:26] to not avoid the donuts
[53:30] it's easier to just swipe the credit
[53:32] card
[53:33] for something you can't really afford
[53:35] and not worry about it's easier to skip
[53:38] the budget meeting
[53:40] that month that week it's easier to just
[53:43] not pay attention
[53:44] or is it
[53:46] easy has a cost
[53:49] so
[53:50] we want to take that now into the
[53:52] spiritual
[53:53] so paul here is saying he's he's
[53:56] desiring to press he says i pressed
[53:58] toward the mark for the prize of the
[53:59] high calling of god in christ jesus
[54:02] is that easy
[54:04] we are called to take up our cross every
[54:07] single day
[54:08] that's hard that is hard
[54:11] but
[54:12] to do the opposite would be quote easy
[54:16] has a cost
[54:19] to be taken of he his desire to be taken
[54:22] by christ and i'll read the quote here
[54:24] and and i don't know i you know the guys
[54:26] want the the things in order and i was
[54:28] just kind of scrambling so um i may jump
[54:31] to the quote sooner but
[54:33] brother branham says it's not i got the
[54:35] holy ghost it's the holy ghost got me
[54:39] and that is right here i am apprehended
[54:42] of christ jesus i'm just gonna i'm gonna
[54:44] cherry pick that i am apprehended of
[54:46] christ jesus because that is what paul
[54:47] is trying to say
[54:49] and um he says he says these days and he
[54:52] says he says but
[54:54] so we finished verse 12 and he says
[54:56] brethren i count not myself to have
[54:58] apprehended so he's not has not
[54:59] apprehended yet and i do believe that
[55:02] until
[55:03] christ is eternal even in glory we will
[55:06] be learning and apprehending
[55:09] more and more of him so paul's saying i
[55:12] haven't apprehended
[55:13] and perhaps we we won't on this side or
[55:16] will we ever because he's an eternal
[55:19] being but he presses forth so he says i
[55:22] have not apprehended
[55:24] so you guys haven't we haven't either
[55:27] but he says but that's a little word
[55:30] this one thing i do this one thing i do
[55:34] you see action is required
[55:37] it's easier to sit
[55:40] and do nothing
[55:42] but action is required
[55:44] because when you sit
[55:46] if you sit long enough you die
[55:48] both naturally and spiritually
[55:52] do not take action is to deny faith in
[55:55] god's word
[55:56] god has called us to step up
[55:58] and act upon his word to take up our
[56:01] cross every day we have that thing that
[56:03] we must do every day so he says this but
[56:07] this one thing i do
[56:09] forgetting those things which are behind
[56:11] and reaching forth unto those things
[56:13] which are before so what is he doing
[56:16] what is the action he's calling us to in
[56:19] his testimony forget
[56:22] and reach
[56:24] forget what's behind you
[56:27] once it's taken care of
[56:29] forget it
[56:31] you don't need to revisit what you've
[56:33] made right
[56:35] you don't need to revisit unless it is
[56:38] to remind yourself of god's grace
[56:41] if it's god's quickening look what i did
[56:43] here and you testify of this
[56:45] that is one thing but he's saying forget
[56:48] those things which are behind you
[56:51] so
[56:52] over the past year as in the spiritual
[56:54] and the natural we still have a week
[56:56] left
[56:58] forget
[56:59] the times you took the easy route
[57:02] forget that
[57:04] pay the price
[57:06] stand up and take the hard or straight
[57:09] way to press forward so he says i have
[57:12] not apprehended but i forget
[57:14] that behind me
[57:16] i forget that which i have failed which
[57:18] i have mistaken because the devil loves
[57:21] to bring that to your remembrance
[57:24] because if he can make you feel weak he
[57:27] can make you think of yourself as weak
[57:29] you will begin to act as weak
[57:32] and he will cause you to fall
[57:38] so depressed
[57:39] forward
[57:41] toward the mark
[57:43] that
[57:47] in the scripture that for which also i'm
[57:49] apprehended
[57:50] all the the all caps that
[57:52] cannot be fully apprehended only fully
[57:55] pressed toward by forgetting what is
[57:57] behind
[57:58] so what is paul meaning what is his
[58:01] meaning in this that this
[58:03] that thing requires full attention and
[58:07] focus
[58:09] full attention and focus
[58:12] he says this one thing i do in other
[58:13] words the one thing i do to
[58:16] attempt to push to press to fully
[58:19] apprehend i forget what's behind me and
[58:23] i reach in other words you can't do both
[58:26] you can't look back and look forward at
[58:28] the same time
[58:32] you can't do both things you one of them
[58:34] is going to take your full attention is
[58:37] it easy
[58:38] or is it hard
[58:39] they both have a price they both have a
[58:42] prize it's going to cost you all
[58:45] to focus on the mark that god has set
[58:48] before us it's going to cause require
[58:51] our full undivided attention we need to
[58:54] be a arrested with our goal
[58:58] we need to apprehend what god is calling
[59:01] us to
[59:04] another definition is to eagerly take a
[59:06] hold of
[59:08] apprehend eagerly take a hold of
[59:10] so we can turn this around because he
[59:13] says that he is i am apprehended of
[59:16] christ jesus in other words god arrested
[59:18] you
[59:20] god eagerly took a hold of you
[59:24] god eagerly seized you
[59:27] i have it here in my written notes
[59:34] yes
[59:36] he wanted to make you his own
[59:39] to take eagerly to seize you
[59:43] and when you come to the realization
[59:46] that you have that to apprehend you have
[59:50] already been apprehended
[59:52] [Music]
[59:53] you see how god works
[59:56] he's his grace is
[59:58] all sufficient
[1:00:01] his grace
[1:00:02] goes beyond our understanding
[1:00:09] fully arrested
[1:00:11] of what god has called you forward
[1:00:14] taking action
[1:00:15] on what is in front of you
[1:00:18] living intentional you know i i hope
[1:00:20] this is i can take the liberty to say
[1:00:22] this it's a bit of a maybe a secular
[1:00:25] idea but they have new year's
[1:00:26] resolutions
[1:00:28] and last year came to my attention that
[1:00:30] there's a thing where where people say
[1:00:32] you know well new year's resolutions
[1:00:33] have never worked
[1:00:34] um
[1:00:35] they or they they maybe have but the
[1:00:37] percentage of success is very very low
[1:00:40] so they say just pick a theme for your
[1:00:42] year
[1:00:43] and try to to live for that theme last
[1:00:45] year i picked the fortify
[1:00:48] was it was our theme and this year just
[1:00:50] feeling the past month or so
[1:00:52] and i believe this is fully uh blessed
[1:00:56] of the lord to live our lives in such a
[1:00:58] way i think christians should be
[1:01:00] um focused and uh intentional with their
[1:01:03] life
[1:01:04] and so we
[1:01:05] told my wife that this coming year our
[1:01:07] word or theme is intentional
[1:01:10] and i believe as as christians that what
[1:01:12] paul is saying here is you have to be
[1:01:14] intentional
[1:01:15] with what you're doing you have to be
[1:01:17] intentional with the word of god you
[1:01:19] have to be intentional with the time you
[1:01:21] spend with god because if you're not
[1:01:23] easy will take over
[1:01:26] if you this we all know this if you
[1:01:28] don't tell your money where to go
[1:01:30] it disappears
[1:01:31] because you have to be intentional if
[1:01:33] you don't tell your time where to go
[1:01:35] it disappears you have to be intentional
[1:01:38] next thing you know you haven't spent
[1:01:41] the time that you need to with the word
[1:01:43] of god
[1:01:45] or taking care of that thing that god
[1:01:46] has been calling you to take care taken
[1:01:48] care of and so
[1:01:51] in that um
[1:01:54] oh i had something and i just slipped
[1:01:55] away
[1:01:56] be intentional
[1:01:59] praise the lord
[1:02:02] well maybe it'll come back to me
[1:02:04] there's always a price i'll go back to
[1:02:06] my notes
[1:02:07] that's what you do you find your notes
[1:02:09] and then that's where you start over
[1:02:10] again
[1:02:12] there's always a price to pay
[1:02:17] there's an example a couple examples
[1:02:19] first kings chapter 22
[1:02:25] first kings chapter 22.
[1:02:28] you can turn there if you like
[1:02:30] you might beat me there
[1:02:35] verse 5
[1:02:47] and jehoshaphat said unto the king of
[1:02:49] israel in choir i prayed thee at the
[1:02:50] word of the lord today so
[1:02:52] rather than read the past few scriptures
[1:02:54] jehoshaphat makes a league with ahab to
[1:02:56] go and fight against
[1:02:58] syria
[1:03:00] and he says okay i'll before josh
[1:03:01] jehoshaphat being a man of god says
[1:03:03] before we do this let us the choir of
[1:03:06] the lord
[1:03:07] and on the side note
[1:03:08] after ahab dies and his son takes up
[1:03:13] reigning his son requests jehoshaphat
[1:03:16] that he sent his men along with his with
[1:03:18] jehoshaphat's men in the ships and
[1:03:20] joseph says no
[1:03:22] so he learned his lesson
[1:03:26] verse 6 then the king of israel gathered
[1:03:28] the prophets together about 400 men and
[1:03:30] said unto them shall i go against ramoth
[1:03:32] gilead to battle or shall i forbear and
[1:03:36] they said go up for the lord shall
[1:03:37] deliver it into the hand of the king
[1:03:40] and jehoshaphat said is there not here a
[1:03:42] prophet of the lord besides that we
[1:03:44] might inquire of him
[1:03:46] now you would say well joseph at man
[1:03:48] there's 400 prophets and they're all
[1:03:50] saying the same thing
[1:03:52] but you see jehoshaphat was a man of god
[1:03:55] and there was something wrong with the
[1:03:57] atmosphere
[1:03:58] something wasn't lining up
[1:04:01] and
[1:04:02] pay attention saints of god when the
[1:04:03] atmosphere doesn't line up right
[1:04:06] don't don't just always say all that
[1:04:08] that's just me that's it
[1:04:10] if you have the holy ghost you've got
[1:04:12] that inner teacher you have that guard
[1:04:15] protecting you and your family pay
[1:04:17] attention when the atmosphere is not
[1:04:18] just right i don't care if everyone
[1:04:20] agrees upon this individual or this idea
[1:04:24] if the atmosphere doesn't set right with
[1:04:26] you stop
[1:04:27] there's nothing wrong with slowing down
[1:04:29] and making sure
[1:04:31] is it my own emotions my own pride
[1:04:33] whatever or is it god
[1:04:35] because there's been times in my life
[1:04:37] and and uh even as a young man i met
[1:04:39] this this couple
[1:04:41] and um
[1:04:42] it just something was off well
[1:04:46] down the road stuff came out that was
[1:04:48] very very off and it was the holy spirit
[1:04:51] witnessing uh picking up on that
[1:04:54] so
[1:04:55] not to lift myself up just to say i have
[1:04:57] had experience where over time it's
[1:04:59] proved that
[1:05:01] atmosphere
[1:05:02] that wasn't correct was the lord that's
[1:05:04] right so here we have jehoshaphat he
[1:05:06] says you know just not feeling quite
[1:05:09] quite right and and you know everyone's
[1:05:11] in agreement and and i don't know if you
[1:05:13] if you've experienced it but there's a
[1:05:14] group of people and everyone's all happy
[1:05:16] but it's a weird happy
[1:05:19] it's a surface happy it's
[1:05:21] you almost feel like if you said
[1:05:22] something they'd all just
[1:05:26] right
[1:05:28] that's the best way i know to explain it
[1:05:30] so joseph that's like okay this is a
[1:05:32] little bit too happy and and sure enough
[1:05:35] the happy was just on the surface
[1:05:36] because he says isn't there not another
[1:05:38] one and ab goes yes but i hate him
[1:05:41] but we were all in revival with 400
[1:05:43] prophets testifying of the victory about
[1:05:45] to come past
[1:05:47] and all of a sudden there's
[1:05:48] this coming out of ahab
[1:05:52] jehoshaphat probably began to question
[1:05:55] right there
[1:05:56] his allegiance with ahab
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:00] but
[1:06:00] as you can read the story the lord
[1:06:02] protected joseph act
[1:06:04] we do dumb things as sons and daughters
[1:06:07] of god but god still will protect us
[1:06:10] he'll school us jehoshaphat was chaste
[1:06:12] they were chasing him down to kill him
[1:06:15] it scared the boots off of him he
[1:06:17] learned his lesson but he god spared his
[1:06:19] life
[1:06:20] so he says there's this guy micaiah
[1:06:23] and uh i hate him he always prophesies
[1:06:26] against me and joseph says let not the
[1:06:28] king say so so the king of israel says
[1:06:30] come on
[1:06:32] run over there and get makaya the son of
[1:06:35] in-law and like verse 10 and the king of
[1:06:37] israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah
[1:06:38] satan on his throne having put on their
[1:06:41] robes there was a nice
[1:06:43] sophisticated
[1:06:44] gathering in front of samaria in the
[1:06:47] gates where everyone could see it's a
[1:06:50] nice you know here's the 400 prophets
[1:06:51] all testifying
[1:06:53] cheering the king on
[1:06:57] would you like to be the one to disrupt
[1:06:58] that
[1:07:02] would it be hard to disrupt it
[1:07:04] or
[1:07:05] easy
[1:07:07] it would be hard
[1:07:09] now sometimes see let's bring this down
[1:07:13] home 402 we just say it's the prophets
[1:07:16] and the kings 402 people
[1:07:19] 402 in this message church all in
[1:07:21] agreement
[1:07:24] but
[1:07:24] your bible and your message tells you
[1:07:27] otherwise that's right
[1:07:30] is it easy or is it hard
[1:07:32] and which price do you want to pay
[1:07:34] that's right
[1:07:36] so micaiah so zedekiah the son of
[1:07:39] shania
[1:07:41] made him horns of iron and he said thus
[1:07:44] saith the lord man this guy was
[1:07:46] enthusiast enthusiastic
[1:07:48] he spent the time to craft these horns
[1:07:50] of iron with thee shalt thou push the
[1:07:52] syrians until thou have consumed them
[1:07:55] everyone had chills up and down their
[1:07:57] spines
[1:07:59] and all the prophets prophesied so
[1:08:02] saying go up to ramoff gilead and
[1:08:04] prosper for the lord shall deliver it
[1:08:06] into the king's hand and the messenger
[1:08:08] that was gone to call mikaya
[1:08:10] speak unto him saying
[1:08:12] now listen micaiah
[1:08:14] everybody down there
[1:08:16] at that revival
[1:08:17] is saying ahab will have the victory
[1:08:21] if you
[1:08:22] really want to have a position in this
[1:08:25] church
[1:08:26] you should do the same thing
[1:08:30] you see
[1:08:31] with the devil
[1:08:32] he charges interest
[1:08:34] oh 12 months no payments required
[1:08:39] that's the devil
[1:08:42] when i was younger and um
[1:08:45] i did that
[1:08:47] and then the interest came
[1:08:50] don't do that
[1:08:53] the interest comes and it charges you on
[1:08:55] all the back
[1:08:57] all the way back to day one
[1:09:00] and it's the worst interest you can ever
[1:09:01] have
[1:09:02] that's the way the demo works
[1:09:04] oh come on it's easy now it's so easy to
[1:09:07] go to buy that
[1:09:08] climb in that brand new pickup truck and
[1:09:10] drive off the
[1:09:12] parking lot it's easy to do
[1:09:15] but then the payments and the interest
[1:09:18] that's what the devil does
[1:09:20] he charges interest amen
[1:09:24] and so
[1:09:26] he's saying hey look
[1:09:28] this messenger to makai is saying look
[1:09:30] 12 months interest free
[1:09:33] simple down payment of two hundred
[1:09:35] dollars
[1:09:36] it's yours
[1:09:39] i said as the lord liveth what the lord
[1:09:41] saith unto me that will i speak
[1:09:45] you see wisdom in his response
[1:09:48] i'm sure in his heart he thought
[1:09:52] there's no way
[1:09:54] all them guys are right
[1:09:57] but until the lord
[1:09:59] i will only speak what he says so he
[1:10:00] came to the king and the king said unto
[1:10:02] him micaiah shall we go against remote
[1:10:04] gilead to battle or shall we forbear and
[1:10:07] he answered him found this humorous go
[1:10:09] and prosper for the lord shall deliver
[1:10:11] it into the hand of the king and the
[1:10:13] king said unto him how many times do i
[1:10:16] have to tell you tell me the truth
[1:10:19] in other words makai had done this
[1:10:21] several other times
[1:10:23] go ahead king
[1:10:25] do it no no tell me the truth
[1:10:28] go ahead king do it no tell me the truth
[1:10:32] see ahab even in his deception knew
[1:10:36] knew the truth
[1:10:38] you see you don't always know the people
[1:10:41] that you're interacting with or con
[1:10:43] having confrontation with you don't know
[1:10:45] their heart sometimes and they may know
[1:10:48] it's the truth and that's why they're
[1:10:49] acting the way they are that's why ahab
[1:10:52] was so upset didn't want makaya to come
[1:10:53] because he knew he was wrong
[1:10:58] so mccain says
[1:10:59] i saw all israel scattered upon the
[1:11:01] hills as sheep that have not a shepherd
[1:11:04] and the lord said these have no master
[1:11:05] let them return every man to his house
[1:11:07] in peace and the king of israel said
[1:11:09] unto jehoshaphat did not i tell thee see
[1:11:11] i told you this guy does not like me all
[1:11:14] he does is prophesy evil
[1:11:18] but it wasn't
[1:11:19] machia
[1:11:21] it was the word of the lord
[1:11:23] it was the word of the lord so
[1:11:25] we could preach a whole sermon about
[1:11:26] this story but the the the what the i
[1:11:29] want to pull from it is
[1:11:31] and zedekiah goes up and he smacks makai
[1:11:34] and he says where did the spirit of the
[1:11:35] lord
[1:11:36] go when he left me
[1:11:38] and he says you know you you will see
[1:11:41] you will find out
[1:11:43] uh he says behold thou shalt see in that
[1:11:44] day when thou shalt go into an
[1:11:46] entertainer to hide thyself so he says
[1:11:48] that the lord sent a lying spirit down
[1:11:51] to anoint all of those prophets so it
[1:11:53] would have been my point is it would
[1:11:54] have been easier for makaya to go with
[1:11:57] the flow
[1:11:59] but it would have costed cost him
[1:12:02] a lot it would have cost him everything
[1:12:04] you see
[1:12:05] easy or hard it costs you all
[1:12:09] but easy is deceiving to make you think
[1:12:11] it doesn't really cost you all when you
[1:12:14] swipe your credit card it's
[1:12:16] scientifically proven it doesn't really
[1:12:17] hurt
[1:12:19] when you hand over cash it does yeah
[1:12:22] because your brain doesn't think you're
[1:12:24] actually partying with anything of value
[1:12:29] that's the way the devil works it up oh
[1:12:31] you're not really losing anything on
[1:12:33] this deal it's it's you're the one you
[1:12:36] get everything
[1:12:37] you see when everything's free
[1:12:41] you need to look for the fine print
[1:12:43] because nothing is free
[1:12:45] if it's free
[1:12:47] they're getting something from you even
[1:12:50] if it's just your email address
[1:12:53] so mikaya of the son of in-law makaya is
[1:12:56] is who is like god
[1:12:58] in-law whom god will fill up
[1:13:03] do you want to be
[1:13:04] a person whom god will fill up
[1:13:07] whom god has fully apprehended
[1:13:10] and then you have to take
[1:13:12] the way that is straight the way that is
[1:13:15] hard
[1:13:18] um interesting note side note zedekiah
[1:13:20] means jehovah is righteous
[1:13:23] son of shanna
[1:13:25] means traitor
[1:13:27] t-r-a-d-e-r he traded
[1:13:30] his position with god
[1:13:32] for the easy way out
[1:13:35] jehovah is righteous is the meaning of
[1:13:37] his name but he traded his name
[1:13:40] he traded his name for the easy way out
[1:13:43] for good standing with the king for for
[1:13:45] for um
[1:13:47] personal
[1:13:48] success
[1:13:50] the world's definition of success he
[1:13:52] traded that
[1:13:54] but micah was fully apprehended by god
[1:13:57] there's another example in jeremiah
[1:13:58] chapter 28 and some of you have probably
[1:14:01] already figured out
[1:14:03] this uh where we're going
[1:14:06] but that's okay
[1:14:08] keep it to yourself
[1:14:12] jeremiah chapter 28
[1:14:18] jeremiah another prophet in the bible
[1:14:21] who
[1:14:22] really gave it all
[1:14:27] a good a good
[1:14:28] one to to look as an example and it came
[1:14:31] to pass at verse one the same year in
[1:14:32] the beginning of the reign of zedekiah
[1:14:34] king of judah in the fourth
[1:14:38] year and in the fifth month that
[1:14:39] hananiah the son of azura the prophet
[1:14:41] which was of giving spake unto me in the
[1:14:44] house of the lord in the presence of the
[1:14:45] priest and of all the people saying thus
[1:14:48] speaketh the lord of hosts the god of
[1:14:49] israel saying i have broken the yoke of
[1:14:51] the king of babylon within two full
[1:14:54] years will i bring again into this place
[1:14:56] all the vessels of the lord's house that
[1:14:58] nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away
[1:15:00] from this place and carried them to
[1:15:02] babylon and i will bring again to this
[1:15:04] place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim
[1:15:07] king of judah with all the captives of
[1:15:08] judah that went into babylon say the
[1:15:10] lord for i will break the yoke of the
[1:15:12] king of babylon and the prophet jeremiah
[1:15:14] said unto the prophet hananiah in the
[1:15:16] presence of the priests and the presence
[1:15:18] of all the people that stood in the
[1:15:19] house of the lord
[1:15:21] he says amen the lord do so the lord
[1:15:24] performed thy words which thou hast
[1:15:25] prophesied to bring again the vessels of
[1:15:27] the lord's house and all that is carried
[1:15:29] away
[1:15:30] captive from babylon into this place he
[1:15:32] says yes
[1:15:33] restore but he says but
[1:15:38] listen here
[1:15:40] this doctrine doesn't line up with the
[1:15:43] word of god
[1:15:44] you see it sounds good right
[1:15:47] the lord would want to restore his
[1:15:49] temple lord want to restore everything
[1:15:51] that the enemy had stole from you the
[1:15:53] enemy had taken from the temple of god
[1:15:56] that is according to the word right
[1:16:00] but jeremiah says that idea now in this
[1:16:03] season does not
[1:16:05] line up with the word you see you can
[1:16:07] take some pretty good ideas and some
[1:16:09] pretty good doctrines from the bible and
[1:16:11] find a few scriptures or a lot of
[1:16:13] scriptures that line up with what you're
[1:16:15] trying to say but if it doesn't follow
[1:16:17] the continuity of what has been
[1:16:19] prophesied then it cannot line up with
[1:16:22] god's word so he says the prophets have
[1:16:25] been before me and before thee of old
[1:16:30] prophesied both against many countries
[1:16:33] and against great kingdoms of war and
[1:16:34] evil and of pestilence the prophet with
[1:16:36] which prophesieth of peace when the word
[1:16:39] of the prophet shall come to pass then
[1:16:40] shall the prophet be known that the lord
[1:16:42] hath truly sent him
[1:16:45] excuse me so um
[1:16:49] then hananiah the prophet took the yoke
[1:16:51] from off the prophet jeremiah's neck and
[1:16:53] break it he didn't like what he had to
[1:16:54] say right
[1:16:57] and hananiah spake in the presence of
[1:16:58] all people saying thus say it the lord
[1:17:00] even so will i break the yoke of
[1:17:01] nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the
[1:17:03] neck of all nations within the space of
[1:17:06] two full years and the prophet jeremiah
[1:17:08] went his way so jeremiah spoke his peace
[1:17:11] and hananiah still tried to make his
[1:17:13] point still tried to take it you know i
[1:17:15] off i wonder if at that point if han and
[1:17:17] i would have said you know what you're
[1:17:18] right
[1:17:20] if you would have had grace
[1:17:23] i believe that was his warning but he
[1:17:25] stepped past it
[1:17:27] he goes forth and then so jeremiah just
[1:17:29] walks away
[1:17:31] then the word of the lord comes to
[1:17:32] jeremiah the prophet he says
[1:17:34] go and tell hananiah saying thus say the
[1:17:37] lord thou hast broken the yokes of wood
[1:17:38] but thou shalt make for them yokes of
[1:17:41] iron
[1:17:42] for those say the lord of hosts the god
[1:17:43] of israel i have put a yoke of iron upon
[1:17:45] the neck of all those these nations that
[1:17:47] they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of
[1:17:49] babylon they shall serve him and i have
[1:17:51] given him the beast of the field also
[1:17:53] then said the prophet jeremiah unto him
[1:17:55] and i the prophet here now hananiah the
[1:17:58] lord hath not sent thee but thou makest
[1:18:00] this people to trust in a lie
[1:18:04] therefore thus saith the lord behold i
[1:18:05] will cast you from off the face of the
[1:18:07] earth this year thou shalt die because
[1:18:09] thou hast taught rebellion against the
[1:18:11] lord so hananiah the prophet died the
[1:18:14] same year in the seventh month
[1:18:20] a price was set
[1:18:22] the cost of easy
[1:18:24] was hananiah's life death am i saying
[1:18:27] physically you're going to die
[1:18:30] no
[1:18:31] i mean that god can't do that god can't
[1:18:33] take you off the scene but
[1:18:36] death spiritually amen
[1:18:38] the cost of easy is death spiritually
[1:18:42] we're in a world of of ease
[1:18:46] if you don't want to walk
[1:18:49] and tour you know
[1:18:51] this historic downtown
[1:18:53] don't worry we have a little buggy you
[1:18:54] can ride on
[1:18:58] it's a little too hot don't worry all
[1:18:59] you have to do you don't
[1:19:01] you don't even have to walk the
[1:19:02] thermostat just pull your phone out and
[1:19:05] change the temperature
[1:19:07] is that stuff wrong
[1:19:10] not necessarily
[1:19:12] but it's easy
[1:19:15] i don't know who was it recently said it
[1:19:16] may have been our pastor was we were
[1:19:18] talking
[1:19:19] but it was someone and it's it's it's
[1:19:22] the devil it was a pastor it's the devil
[1:19:25] trying to push the curse that god put
[1:19:28] upon man back that's right that's
[1:19:31] exactly right the beginning in the
[1:19:32] garden of eden the man was cursed to
[1:19:35] live by the sweat of his brown woman
[1:19:37] um in child bearing
[1:19:40] and
[1:19:40] satan has worked over these years to
[1:19:43] push that curse back till he says
[1:19:48] i can sit on my desk in ease and comfort
[1:19:52] and work
[1:19:53] you see but easy has a cost
[1:19:55] they say for every like
[1:19:57] 12 hours of sitting if you don't do
[1:20:00] things to
[1:20:01] keep yourself healthy you take like a
[1:20:03] day of your life away
[1:20:05] it's actually detrimental to your health
[1:20:08] so easy has a cost
[1:20:11] but heart has a cost which are you
[1:20:13] willing to pay
[1:20:16] and i have it here the devil charges
[1:20:18] interest so jeremiah had a burden to
[1:20:21] bear jeremiah chose the straight way
[1:20:24] now here's what i want to get down to
[1:20:26] you say oh well i'll just pick which one
[1:20:27] i want to pay
[1:20:29] well this is what i want to get down to
[1:20:31] jeremiah had a burden to bear but he did
[1:20:33] not bear it alone
[1:20:35] when you pick the hard way guess what
[1:20:38] by his stripes you are healed amen
[1:20:41] he took your sin upon his back
[1:20:44] and he took it to the cross
[1:20:46] and he already paid the price of hard
[1:20:50] he already paid the price of doing the
[1:20:52] right thing doing that hard thing and
[1:20:55] guess what in the natural they've proven
[1:20:57] this as well if you do the hard things
[1:21:00] you are a happier healthier person
[1:21:03] when you sit on the couch and instead of
[1:21:05] going and getting fresh air or going for
[1:21:07] a walk and you just sit down it actually
[1:21:09] makes you depressed
[1:21:12] easy has a cost but if you do that thing
[1:21:14] the thing about easy is it costs a whole
[1:21:18] lot more
[1:21:19] in my opinion
[1:21:21] it costs a whole lot more you see the
[1:21:24] big sting of death has been taken from
[1:21:27] the heart
[1:21:28] by jesus christ he paid it all and he
[1:21:31] gives us he says look take up your cross
[1:21:34] follow me he preaches the hard way he
[1:21:36] preaches it i've come to bring division
[1:21:39] between a father and his son and his son
[1:21:41] and his mother and the families i've
[1:21:43] caught to bring the vision put you know
[1:21:46] just drop your nets and don't look back
[1:21:49] live with me do the hard things but then
[1:21:51] he says
[1:21:53] but my yoke is easy
[1:21:55] and my burden is light
[1:21:57] there's some
[1:21:59] brother brown says it's it's feather
[1:22:01] coated or it's the yolk is coated in
[1:22:04] love
[1:22:04] in other words it's the hard thing but
[1:22:07] it's the thing that gives you the
[1:22:09] greatest benefit and reward when serving
[1:22:12] god because ultimately amen you the
[1:22:15] reward at the end of that amen is
[1:22:17] eternal life with christ and there is a
[1:22:20] reward on this side just like in the
[1:22:21] natural you feel half happy and
[1:22:23] healthier when serving god amen you have
[1:22:26] strength and courage to face the day i'm
[1:22:28] not talking about people who have given
[1:22:30] up serving god i'm talking about you on
[1:22:32] a daily basis choosing to do take up
[1:22:35] your cross and follow him you will be
[1:22:38] a stronger and more courageous christian
[1:22:41] to face the next battle you see it's a
[1:22:44] it's a it's a waterfall effect i guess
[1:22:47] you could say
[1:22:48] you do take it easy well now this one is
[1:22:51] it's twice as hard and then three times
[1:22:53] and four and it just kind of trickles
[1:22:55] all the way down until you find yourself
[1:22:56] at the bottom wondering how it happened
[1:22:58] and it was just a few simple things here
[1:23:01] and there the devil slowly slipping in
[1:23:04] right that's right but easy has a cost
[1:23:08] remember
[1:23:10] praise the lord brother says in the
[1:23:11] message what does it take to make a
[1:23:13] christian life wow i didn't know that
[1:23:15] was the title
[1:23:18] when
[1:23:22] when you get this spirit in you then the
[1:23:25] burdens of life becomes light
[1:23:28] you see it's hard
[1:23:30] but his yoke is easy and his burden is
[1:23:32] light you don't notice them anymore the
[1:23:34] yoke is lying with feathers
[1:23:36] they become so easy
[1:23:38] and then the people that pile things on
[1:23:40] you you know what you're like samson at
[1:23:42] the gates of gaza who picked up the big
[1:23:44] brass gate and packed it up on the hill
[1:23:46] and when you get to a place that
[1:23:49] the holy spirit has you not you the holy
[1:23:52] spirit but the holy spirit has you
[1:23:55] you say i got the holy ghost i don't
[1:23:57] think that should be said you must say
[1:23:59] the holy ghost got me and then when the
[1:24:02] holy ghost gets you the burdens the yoke
[1:24:04] is easy then you pick up the big gates
[1:24:06] of gaza and pack them straight to
[1:24:09] calvary see you have to do the hard
[1:24:11] thing and pick up the gates but you have
[1:24:14] a place to take that burden to
[1:24:16] amen you have
[1:24:19] a way to let off that pressure
[1:24:23] you have a way to let jeremiah even
[1:24:25] though he was i think it was at this
[1:24:27] point he was sent down into the dungeon
[1:24:29] even though he was put in shackles and
[1:24:31] sit down there i'm sure he was humming
[1:24:34] oh
[1:24:34] me
[1:24:35] amazing grace
[1:24:38] how
[1:24:39] sweet
[1:24:41] the sound you see says god when you
[1:24:43] serve god
[1:24:45] when you put your foot forward you say
[1:24:47] i'm i have not fully apprehended but i
[1:24:50] desire to attain to that which has
[1:24:53] already apprehended me so i put what is
[1:24:56] behind me forget that and i press and i
[1:25:00] reach do you know what you have to do or
[1:25:01] something's a little bit too far you
[1:25:03] have to reach
[1:25:04] you have to reach that thing on the top
[1:25:06] shelf for short guys like me you got to
[1:25:08] reach to grab it in other words you have
[1:25:10] to put effort into what you're doing you
[1:25:13] got to reach for that that thing amen
[1:25:16] that that revelation that that that
[1:25:19] staying power you have to reach for it
[1:25:22] but god is there
[1:25:24] to tip it off for you to grab
[1:25:28] amen he says he says um
[1:25:31] the burdens the those cases and there
[1:25:33] and there on mount calvary you lay them
[1:25:35] at the feet of jesus and pray for your
[1:25:37] enemies
[1:25:38] not with a grudge lord if you'd bust him
[1:25:41] open no but with something though from
[1:25:44] your heart that dear god that man is a
[1:25:47] man like i am
[1:25:48] you see what's lacking in the church
[1:25:50] friend and now what we need is we need
[1:25:52] to be we need to start all over
[1:25:55] i've seen the quote there
[1:25:59] praise the lord
[1:26:00] you see jesus paid it all
[1:26:02] we don't owe anything
[1:26:04] but full surrender to him right
[1:26:07] fully surrendered to him
[1:26:09] and
[1:26:10] you see with the devil there's a catch
[1:26:13] there's always a catch there's always a
[1:26:15] hidden claws or
[1:26:16] or an asterisk or a fine print
[1:26:20] there's always a cost yes sir
[1:26:23] eternal life with christ is a free gift
[1:26:26] all you have to do is accept it
[1:26:29] amen victory in christ is a free gift
[1:26:33] all you have to do is accept it all you
[1:26:36] have to do is step up and take up your
[1:26:38] cross and god said he'll take the rest
[1:26:40] you know that song god
[1:26:42] he never promised that the cross would
[1:26:45] not get heavy or the hill would not be
[1:26:48] hard to climb yeah that's right but he
[1:26:52] promised he wouldn't leave you there
[1:26:54] he promised when the devil comes and the
[1:26:56] devourer comes to tell you
[1:26:59] take the easy road
[1:27:01] come in
[1:27:02] you know what it was christian
[1:27:04] the prodigal or the program was progress
[1:27:06] christian come on this way is a little
[1:27:08] bit easier
[1:27:10] when that devourer begins to whisper in
[1:27:12] your ear take the easy road
[1:27:15] amen
[1:27:16] he's not gonna christ ain't gonna leave
[1:27:18] you there to fend for yourself he's
[1:27:21] gonna provide a way of escape
[1:27:24] and when he does escape as quickly as
[1:27:26] you can
[1:27:30] you see
[1:27:31] it's hard the world says oh it's hard
[1:27:33] you know you got to wear a dress it's
[1:27:34] 100 degrees outside
[1:27:37] oh it's hard you got to wear pants and i
[1:27:38] mean why are you in you know we had this
[1:27:40] guy visit the office in phoenix there
[1:27:42] and we're all in pants because we're all
[1:27:43] believers he's like man i don't know how
[1:27:45] you guys do this because he was from
[1:27:47] like colorado or something
[1:27:49] wearing pants when it's 100 degrees
[1:27:50] outside
[1:27:52] and it kind of the conversation kind of
[1:27:53] moved on but i was like yeah we're not
[1:27:54] going to wear those women's underwear
[1:27:58] you see oh it's hard you see but
[1:28:00] but but it's not
[1:28:02] you understand what i'm saying it's not
[1:28:04] because god christ already paid the
[1:28:07] price
[1:28:08] amen and now all we have to do
[1:28:10] is accept it and he'll give us
[1:28:12] everything we need you see
[1:28:13] you see the devil
[1:28:15] tells you he'll give you what you need
[1:28:18] but he doesn't
[1:28:19] yeah he's lying through his teeth oh
[1:28:21] they don't worry about that man it's
[1:28:23] like you know it's like the classic you
[1:28:24] know double crossing i'll we'll take
[1:28:26] care of you he's got a god he's trying
[1:28:29] to rob the store run you know they're
[1:28:31] the guys that set it all up that's what
[1:28:33] he does
[1:28:34] he takes you in he says look i got your
[1:28:36] back and he doesn't
[1:28:37] not at all
[1:28:39] you played into his hands if you will
[1:28:41] but you see god gives us gives us wisdom
[1:28:44] he gives us wisdom so that circle back
[1:28:46] to matthew
[1:28:48] we're closing here in a minute let's go
[1:28:50] back to matthew 11 verse 27
[1:28:53] i don't have
[1:28:54] it you do that for me
[1:28:57] oh i i didn't give you 27. so he says
[1:29:00] all things are delivered i gotta have to
[1:29:02] jump to it real fast matthew chapter 11.
[1:29:05] i'm sorry about this
[1:29:15] all things are delivered unto me of my
[1:29:18] father and no man knoweth the son but
[1:29:20] the father
[1:29:21] neither knoweth any man the father state
[1:29:23] the son enter and he to whomsoever the
[1:29:26] son will reveal him see this ties right
[1:29:28] right into a paul saying i am already
[1:29:31] apprehended of christ jesus
[1:29:33] who the son will reveal amen amen on all
[1:29:37] things
[1:29:38] all things are delivered
[1:29:41] unto him
[1:29:42] amen all these things
[1:29:45] we don't have to worry about anything
[1:29:47] being left out all things have been
[1:29:49] delivered unto him he knows the ins and
[1:29:52] the outs he knows the other side of the
[1:29:54] schemes
[1:29:56] and he will give you wisdom
[1:29:58] and whosoever hit the son will reveal
[1:30:00] him
[1:30:01] amen i
[1:30:03] what an what a privilege and an honor
[1:30:05] saying to god for god to have come and
[1:30:08] eagerly
[1:30:10] seize you arrest you
[1:30:12] from your while we were yet sinners
[1:30:15] christ died for us from and even in our
[1:30:17] daily life
[1:30:18] you know all right you take the wrong
[1:30:21] exit
[1:30:22] the lord just arrested you out of harm's
[1:30:24] way
[1:30:26] amen
[1:30:27] easy has a cost thank you god
[1:30:30] all that all you that are labor and are
[1:30:32] heavy laden i will give you rest in
[1:30:34] other words before coming to christ they
[1:30:37] were heavy laden
[1:30:39] but you see when you go across
[1:30:43] into christ
[1:30:45] to do
[1:30:46] the hard you see it's a deception it's a
[1:30:49] deception to do the hard thing
[1:30:51] he says hey look my yoke is easy and my
[1:30:54] burden is light
[1:30:56] all we have to do is one thing
[1:30:58] and that's take up our cross
[1:31:00] brother brown says you have one thing
[1:31:02] you have to do lay your self-will down
[1:31:05] and when you take up your cross that's
[1:31:07] exactly what you're doing surrendering
[1:31:09] fully to him so i pray that we reflect
[1:31:12] over the jesus you want to come reflect
[1:31:14] over the past year
[1:31:15] and and strive saints of god to press
[1:31:18] toward the mark of the hulk high calling
[1:31:20] in christ jesus finding comfort and
[1:31:23] strength in the fact that he has already
[1:31:26] apprehended us
[1:31:28] and we though we were
[1:31:31] who knows where
[1:31:33] you were already hand selected
[1:31:36] already picked out
[1:31:37] so the devil won't want to tell you take
[1:31:40] the easy road
[1:31:41] you know just give in to the temptation
[1:31:43] it's easier
[1:31:45] but remember easy has a cost
[1:31:47] and remember as a son or daughter of god
[1:31:49] nothing will come along to tempt you
[1:31:51] that you can't overcome it
[1:31:54] see that's
[1:31:55] the devil tries to convince you
[1:31:57] well you're weak because you don't have
[1:31:59] enough strength to overcome this thing
[1:32:02] this temptation
[1:32:04] but that's contrary to the word god
[1:32:08] so when you go through great temptation
[1:32:10] find it and honor
[1:32:12] that god would say you are equipped for
[1:32:14] such a difficult battle
[1:32:17] you go through a hard trial find
[1:32:19] strength and courage that wow this is
[1:32:22] hard because that's how much confidence
[1:32:25] christ has in me
[1:32:27] don't she doesn't that want to make you
[1:32:29] do the absolute best that you can
[1:32:31] when your dad when you know your father
[1:32:34] has so much confidence in you he's asked
[1:32:36] you to do this very difficult thing
[1:32:39] you you you want to just lay it all down
[1:32:42] and just go 110
[1:32:44] because of the confidence he has you see
[1:32:46] sayings of god many times we lack
[1:32:48] victory in our life because we accept
[1:32:50] the lie the devil has told us about
[1:32:52] ourselves but god's
[1:32:55] grace
[1:32:56] says we are more than able
[1:32:59] we are more than conquerors more than
[1:33:02] con what what is the word they use for
[1:33:04] the world
[1:33:05] the ones that can just defeat every
[1:33:08] conquerors
[1:33:09] but we're more
[1:33:11] than conquerors
[1:33:13] conquerors plus
[1:33:16] conquerors plus amen praise the lord
[1:33:20] let's bow our hands heavenly father lord
[1:33:22] jesus we pray that you would take this
[1:33:25] thought this morning lord
[1:33:26] father i know it spoke to my heart
[1:33:29] father and i know this kind of hits down
[1:33:31] where the rubber meets the road
[1:33:33] but isn't that where we are
[1:33:35] isn't that where we live lord jesus
[1:33:38] i pray father that you would encourage
[1:33:39] your saints lord if there's some here
[1:33:41] this morning maybe feeling a little bit
[1:33:43] condemned or convicted for taking the
[1:33:46] easy road
[1:33:47] for the mini
[1:33:49] today
[1:33:51] spiritually speaking and say
[1:33:54] i'm gonna forget what's behind me
[1:33:57] and i'm gonna reach forward
[1:34:00] and the next time the devil says
[1:34:02] take the easy road i'm gonna take up the
[1:34:05] cross and follow you
[1:34:07] lord it's a hard and rough way but
[1:34:10] it's the way that leads to life lord
[1:34:12] jesus and father you said your yoke is
[1:34:15] easy and your burden is light the devil
[1:34:17] wants to try and say it that that's not
[1:34:19] true that it's it's a heavy yoke and
[1:34:21] it's a hard burden
[1:34:23] a father

[1:34:27] live in today father that your yoke is
[1:34:29] easy and your burden is light father we
