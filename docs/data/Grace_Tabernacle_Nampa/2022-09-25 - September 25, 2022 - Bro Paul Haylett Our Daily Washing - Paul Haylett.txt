don't you come [Music] I slipped through the gates of pearl as Peter greeted me and one by one I met the Saints I long so much to see I saw my hero Stephen Paul and Timothy and for my breath could find the words them speak to me are you she the Bride of the last days [Music] he shall Crown take your place beside the throne Christ is now your very own you are the special chosen what we see [Music] what's the worst of all the ages they continue to say how did you live a Christian Life in such a Godless day question after question my heroes lifted me then I heard a voice behind me whisper tenderly this is sheep the Bride of the last days who stood the worst of times when so many Slipped Away [Music] take your place beside the throne I am now your very own you are the special chosen one we see you are these trials that you're facing may seem so big and tall but when we hear the master speak it'll make it worth it all worth it all you are sure the Bride of the last days who stood the worst of times when so many Slipped Away fears take your place beside the throne Christ is now your very own you are the special chosen one we see you are sheep [Music] praise the Lord you are she had to smile downstairs good sister Jerry was practicing with my wife and printing off a copy of my songs and I looked down I was like no it sounds familiar so we're gonna sing Here Comes the Bride Lord has has a plan for us this morning amen let's sing this is to get ready to turn the service to brother Paul what a celebration on that day we know we can't be far away foreign [Music] [Applause] oh what a glorious side Here Comes The Chosen One he had someone angel just at the side for him [Music] some from every nation will be there very spotless brought so bright and fast all of heaven will behold the bride walking down the streets of gold getting ready now to go bury our North seems to know pick up your trumpet gave your landfall forehead of surprise for him of the right I'm surprised oh what a spotless bright oh one it will reassign here come the chosen one and he ran some wands hey hey step aside for him every day amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah well you know sometimes Saints things just come in such a way that you just recognize the leadership of the Holy Spirit and uh I'm sorry I've forgotten my brother's name but sure happy to see you God bless you I hope you can stay for the fellowship today and for all the saints it's good to have each and every one of you here today God bless you and uh so as we just look at today I know our sister April had a very early start you know I always thought I want to be a world traveler and so I guess I have to change that and say I'd like to be like sister April and anyway she was up seeing family and the Lord's blessed her with that time to visit family and and to hurry home huh you notice the word home to hurry home yes I say yeah say amen hallelujah anyway sister April this is not my fault it's actually brother Jason's fault and um and I just want to put that disclaimer brother Jason in the back room and he just looked at me and he says Paul if April makes it here in time we need to ask her to come up and we need to lay hands on her you see Saints we won't go into all the details because certainly we don't want that broadcast as it were to the world but our sisters undertaking on humanitarian purposes with a gift that God has given her to help those that are in great need but this is going to be a trip that could entail risk and she sprayed through and she's willing to take that believes that's what God's asked her to do and we're going to come ask our sister April to come forward and we are going to pray that not only God just keep our sister safe right we we want her returning home safe but the gift that God placed in her mind and her hands a skill that is rare I guess you would say amongst believers but to use it the good of humanity the scripture says to be good and to all men especially those of the household of faith and sometimes we forget the all men part and we focus on the household of faith only but by God's grace we believe that our sister will have a good journey she will make a difference in the lives and uh troubles on every hand my brother and sister you realize as I just read a story recently of a man served overseas four tours Afghanistan gets killed one city block from his house by someone running a red light hard to understand isn't it the God's in control sister April will you come Brothers I should invite a few sisters actually but brothers would you come we're going to lay hands on our sister as she and takes part in this journey May God touch you see there's some things we won't go into explaining but you see our sister is not just wanting to go there to to help those who have been physically injured she's like what can I take what can I testify how can I approach this I want to make a difference not just in their physical life been a spiritual life when God opens the doors we want to be prepared to step through that door we don't want to be the person that says well I had an opportunity to witness and I didn't know what to say God help us be prepared to know what to say now that isn't us studying the message so that we can repeat it like an encyclopedia but that's us in the presence of God that we would be moved by the spirit he says you let me do the speaking you let me you just be ready and I'll use you don't think what you're going to say let me do the speaking and so we're just going to ask come Brothers we want to lay hands upon our sister amen [Music] Heavenly Father Lord we come before you today how blessed we are to serve such an awesome God and Lord the variety you have placed in the body father in the bride of Christ father you have placed gifts and abilities and desires father and Lord we want to just come and ask you father now as our sisters going with our heart's desire to change the lives of those who are injured change the lives of those father that have a deep-seated hunger Lord not even certain that there is a God but Lord let there be a living witness in their midst father that would in their time of need Lord just have a son and daughter of god father our sister Lord coming to be able to testify Jesus Christ is alive and well to testify that God is real oh Lord she's already had opportunity in the past father to witness in that realm to those who did not even believe there was a God and their lives are being changed because they're starting to see that you are real and you are present now father we ask your hand of mercy upon our sister may your Holy Spirit father just surround her keep her safe father Lord just keep her in your hand father and Lord as she walks father as she lives as she makes new friends Lord deals with those she already knows Lord may only the Life of Christ come from her may it be on display in such a maze your father that it cannot be denied O Lord blessed father give her hands father to you father that Lord every surgery every time father that she's called upon father that it would touch a life and may she be able to witness The Life of Christ to those Lord that she works with now Lord father we ask that your perfect will be done and we claim Life In The Name of Jesus Christ Lord we're not just seeing a sister travel father we're seeing a very portion of the body of Christ which is the bride of Christ which is Christ himself Lord May the people recognize that you are in their midst in the name of Jesus Christ bless my sister give her strength give her confidence Lord father Lord just surround her Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ God bless you Sister [Music] Hallelujah is it good to be in the house of the Lord today amen I tell you just uh it's just good it's just good to serve the Lord amen you know as we just look at these things my brother and sister how how God just comes he's sovereign God is Sovereign he doesn't need art counsel he doesn't need our advice but my brother and sister will Lord willing touch on that a little later in this service God does care about what you say what you think and what your heart's desires are amen you know there's been times in my life Saints and I don't know how to relate this other than to bring it back of what I have experienced there's been times in my life that I have spoke so boldly that literally when I left the situation I thought Lord what did I just say only to have the Lord come back not an audible voice but open up my Bible and the word speak and realize that wasn't me speaking that's right thank you Lord it wasn't me speaking because when I spoke my brother and sister I couldn't perform what I promised I could not fulfill but then I realized it's not us that's speaking it's our Lord Jesus Christ amen I just want to remind you I meant to announce it this last week and I'm sorry just been overwhelmed and that old carnal thing called work uh trying to do but communion this coming Sunday at 5 PM October the 2nd and doing our best just to stay on schedule before we've you know kind of ended up skipping over things and I don't like that the house of God should not be subject to the world the world needs to be subject to the house of God so communion this coming Sunday I pray all will come and be partakers let's just stand and we'll go into our thought today you know once again I've just been going through the Bible and there's way too many to preach on we could spend the rest of our life preaching on our position of strength the Bible is clear full of the things that God promises to us that he will bring to pass you know it is there my brother and sister I heard the young people singing brother Jason leading them of uh Abraham's children I don't remember the exact words of that song I'm not too good with the the children's songs but you know Father Abraham has many sons and we are here today as the spiritual sons of Abraham promise of the Sands of the sea and by God's grace my brother and sister the word promise that right it wasn't just a promise to Abraham it was actually a promise to all those sons and daughters that were promised to Abraham were part of the promise I'm fulfilling that you're fulfilling that we are a part of the promise given to Abraham we become fulfillment of the promise sometimes we look for God oh I hope it's not too complicated I mean it's so simple it's complicated sometimes we're looking to God to fulfill his promise but he's actually been waiting on us just to take the promise accept it and say This Promise is my promise because God made the promise and I am a son of Abraham's spiritual son and what I've got to do is just take this promise and act on it if I leave it on this shelf my brother and sister remember the little story brother Brown tells about the Mama she's in need and it gets the uh the local authorities or whatever it was involved and and you know she she just has this great need in their life your son oh he sends me these lovely postcards and all of this stuff you know and the man finally something's clicked with him because he's thinking this just doesn't strike me correct and he says can I see those and they're all Bank drafts but they had nice designs on them and she just thought they were some little nice postcard thing with her name on it now my brother and sister I don't want you to leave your postcard in your Bible uncashed it's time for us to take a whole of these things you say brother Paul I've got some things I'm struggling with well praise the Lord praise the Lord amen the devil's not certain he's got you yet yeah in fact he knows he hasn't got you and that's why he hates you that's why he makes and throws down every roadblock he can in front of you it's because he sees something that we ourselves sometimes don't see well thank you Lord the devil's good isn't he yeah he's actually by a challenging you throwing every stumbling block in front of you he's saying I I need to I need to do this I got to do this I got to keep them from coming to their position I want to speak to you today on our daily washing and I know that's something my wife and probably most of our sisters are quite familiar with the daily washing but let's go in our Bibles to Hebrews 10. amen and uh you know I I think it's kind of interesting you know and that the book of Hebrews has really been speaking to me for probably I don't know two or three months I read it and started to re-read again and I I found myself uh uh going back in in the same channel uh what I was reading it in before and so I said you know Lord I'm just going to move on one more book in the Bible and as soon as I've read that book I'm going to come back because you see they're all tied together and I'm going to come back and I'm going to go back through the book of Hebrews again because you see my brother and sister what God has performed is finished very simple what God has performed is finished you see the scripture tells us not going again laying again the foundation of repentance and baptisms and all we don't need to lay that Foundation again that Foundation is laid what we've got to do is believe we're part of that and act on what we read that's what we got to do is act on it amen Hebrews the 10th chapter 16 through 24. amen now as always my brother and sister we should go as our homework as it were only takes a few minutes and you have this great notebook because not all of you write things down and that's good that's fine but we should actually go back anytime the preacher is preaching and you should go back on your own time and read a few scriptures in front and a few scriptures following and you need to go to the quotes and you need to read a little farther up the book and a little farther down the book because I believe I can say from with clear conscience from my heart that brother Chris Brother David myself are not here to paint an alternative picture to the original gospel but sometimes we don't always grasp it comes to this this is what I thought you said or you said and this is what I thought I heard and so we don't want to get off on a tangent we want to stay lined up perfectly and I'm going to put this in a little different fashion sometimes you know the preachers pointed North and you know how the old-timers used to they actually used to do stuff it was land surveyed in the west by this right here and that is they would have a point and they would pick a point and then they would line an individual up and it would be like as it were me looking at brother bomb and then someone else would go further on and look back at brother Bob and me and then they would move right and left until they were lined up and then this would go on and you marked the path that you were walking by aligning to those and days gone by not a new message not a random thing where we stake out our position in Jesus Christ but lining up with the prophets lining up with the apostles lining up in the word in our day and you say but I'm just going to go by Revelation that's good but it doesn't take much for our Revelation to get convoluted are you caught that our Revelation we're not talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ so we want to keep lining up don't we and so I just encourage you a line of scripture in front and behind a quote in front and behind that we stay lined up I feel like preaching praise the Lord Hebrews 10 -24 . this is a covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts aren't you glad you don't have to carry a book around with you and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now we're remission of these is there is no more offering for sin now my brother and sister I want you to see there's something creeping into the message where we're mixing Judaism once again back into the message be careful of those spirits because they'll take you back under the law you can't claim Grace in the Old Testament as the revelation of the New Testament we see it are you with me we see it but that's not where God said he says I this is the Covenant I will make with them he doesn't Point them back into the Old Testament and say go back here to Isaiah go back to Zechariah go back to these and just follow what they did now read Moses from here to here and follow what they did he says I got a new covenant and I'm going to write the word amen my laws amen which is his word I'm going to write that in their heart praise the Lord that's a another tangent for another day but you see where the remission of these sins and iniquities is there's no more offering for sin that's why we don't have an offering of incense we don't have an offering we're not bringing turtle doves and Bullocks and Lambs because that's been done away with but you realize Jesus said I didn't come to do away with the law that's right yeah so this Grace Grace unto disgrace is not legitimate having therefore Brethren boldness see I want you to catch this this morning Saints the connection between these and boldness amen to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh now we often talk about going behind the veil what are we doing do we have a curtain in mind some people have a curtain in mind they're saying I I want to Lord I want to be behind the veil I want to get behind the veil with you you have to get into Jesus Christ to get behind the veil it's not a simple walk right it worked for it worked for the uh Chief priests it worked for those in that day to go into the holiest of holies you see that was a curtain but now it's his flesh that is our curtain yes oh sorry I kept you standing here amen and having a high priest over the house of God amen let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised can we say that together for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this time in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints Hallelujah now I want to just for just a moment or two go back through this scripture and just kind of touch on a couple things here if that would be okay this morning now as we look at this my brother and sister I believe that we are living in the Covenant that's here in Hebrews 10 16. I believe that it's there that he's come and he has taken and written his word in our hearts now some people think that when you say he's writing his word my brother and sister they think that he's writing the Bible but really the word is himself so he's riding himself on the tables of our hearts amen and so it's there that it is not as though by memorization that that proves who we are but it is the fact that Christ himself has come down now remember the word and and we're just going to hit on the edge of a couple things here you do not put wine new wine in Old vessels right and you do not put it in a vessel that is not clean now I hope this morning that you can just be mindful of who's preaching to you that I am who I am and I try to break that habit and every time I try to preach like someone else it comes off horribly amen so if you want to know when Paul tried to preach like someone else just go back and remember those horrible services but my brother and sister have you ever been in the field or been working in the garden or just life in general and you know this happened to me sometime back and it's a little embarrassing but I want to drive home a point and that is brother Paul it had a very particularly dirty day and I come home and sister Jerry's like you really aren't going to come in the house like that are you and I'm like well I I don't know what to do I actually undressed in the garage and my clothes had so much dirt in them that as as I was removing them you know it's just dirt coming out everywhere no one else was home and uh so it's there I go and I take a shower and I'm standing in the shower and it felt so good you know what I'm talking about you're just there and this is and this is luxurious and I got out and I started to towel off and I rubbed the towel around the back of my neck and as the towel come around it was filthy and I thought you know what I had not done a very good job in the shower there was no time limit it wasn't like you've got two minutes in the shower and yet I didn't do a very good job Saints you know and I used that to to make a point to you that we can say I washed but at last we are completely washed and then we can realize you know my grandma you know as I've shared times in the past my grandma would just rub my elbows till they were red because if they were red she couldn't see the brown and if they were Brown she knew you weren't clean and she used I I remember it as being a Brillo pad and uh but you look at that my brother and sister there's something there about knowing that you're completely clean not not just as it is I washed but I'm dirty behind the ears I've got ring around the collar I mean look there's a whole industry made about this soap will take the stain of the Ring Around Your Collar away now if that in the natural is such an important issue that people don't want to be embarrassed by how having a dirty caller my brother and sister how much more it ought to be to Sons and Daughters of God that we would be in a position Washed by the Water of the word that it wouldn't be oh still a little dirt in my life and God would come and deal with us in such that we would be not just uh acknowledging this is something that needs to happen but we would be not a hearer of the word but a doer of the word amen and how that would change our lives and I believe this Covenant my brother and sister have been written on the hearts of Sons and Daughters of God that we would term today as the bride of Christ and so you know I love verse 17 he says their sins and iniquities well I remember no more now my brother and sister do we believe the Bible is it is it a a you know you might say or absolute I mean the prophet of God said the Bible was our absolute I believe the Bible is our absolute and my brother and sister if he said there that their sins and iniquities will I remember no more then why do we listen to the devil why are we listening to the devil when he wants to bring it up from the past he wants to dredge you know 31 years and three weeks ago you no I'm sorry now this is only applies if you have legitimately placed it under the blood of Jesus Christ if you put it in a shoe box in your closet this does not apply do you know the police will say often times they solve a crime by just simply going through people's stuff and the devil can have a legitimate complaint by going through our stuff that's why we put it under the blood and you know I mean I had a good friend worked with him for years worked for a cattle ranch and I had a good friend and he was a devout Catholic and um you know my wife knew him well and this guy would say Paul you're just too religious and I tell him no uh yeah you might be right on one side because we know how being religious is but he was meaning you know just trying too hard to serve God he says look I love being a Catholic and I said I'm sure you do he says because I can take confession every Friday and I have all weekend to party before I go back to work now that's an understanding my brother and sister now I want you to understand that in his mind by going to confession he had just been absolved washed but he wasn't looking to break a cycle he was just looking to a sauce his conscience and the minute the priest said you're forgiven it's kind of like a memory card they do reach a limit right and for him being absolved of his sins just erased everything on the memory card so he could start over that's not the word written on the table of heart that's intellectual that's the church that's a different kind of leadership that is coming and my brother and sister it's in a place where where we're not looking to how our sins and iniquity remembered we're looking to come into a position where our sins and our iniquities are just gone but you know it's not like we want to do that once a year now I'm getting ahead of myself so if it looks like I left that hanging just please bear with me you see my brother and sister there is a place there is you might say an activity that brings Sons and Daughters of God to a place they can have boldness to come into the holiest by the blood of Jesus Christ so we don't want to just be as it were in a natural partaker that a drop of blood on our flesh is sufficient my brother and sister God's not caring about your flesh he didn't come here to redeem that can we say Amen to that and what he does is he's looking for a people that actually care enough to be focused and awake and focus on the things of God because they want to be that one if we come to a place that we think that Church's formality if we think that church is going to do it for us I went to church today well my brother and sister you're fooling your plan yourself because that's like running through the shower and saying I'm clean but you come to a place that we need to have a boldness can we can we say boldness amen that we come to a boldness to enter into the holiest not just be feel good about coming to church by a New and Living Way which he consecrated for us now my brother and sister he took this way and he committed and actually prepared this way for us by walking this way before us he didn't say you just go and try and do this you go and try and live this he walked this way that's how this way got consecrated is he walked this way and he made this way holy for us yeah that's right amen not just words but a New and Living Way what is this not the way of humanity not the way of tradition not the way of our forefathers but a new way a way that would bring us that he's consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and people identify and say I'm a Christian Jesus died on the cross for me that's good my brother and sister but are you in the veil he died for you but are you dead in him we have to be dead in him for this to matter to have an identity my brother and sister look at the identity crisis the world's going through boys don't know whether they're boys or not girls don't know whether they're girls or not the devil has come and used what they call them pronouns or whatever well I don't care what's yours you call yourself you are either saved or you are not you are either under the blood or you are not you are either in Christ or you are not I don't care what kind of title you put on that and the devil said what I'll do is confuse everyone and I'll get it now that I can be a a uh oh what was the deal I heard the other day my this will jump right off my mind if I'm not careful uh uh uh oh they were saying uh what are you he said I I am a practicing Christian football players practice baseball players practice race car drivers practice but some of them are never winners so being a practicing Christian is no Assurance you'll be a winner oh I'll tell you what my brother and sister I heard the word in by God's grace oh you'll say brother Paul I know you have come short I have come short but I'm telling you I'm not practicing at being a Christian I am a Christian hallelujah amen maybe a doctor might have to go through a period of time and you know it's kind of funny because I remember in one of the times in my life that I've been operated on the doctor said and this is Dr so and so and this is his first Standalone surgery let me off this table I'm out of here you see my brother and sister it's there then in a way it really wasn't this is the first time sister April would understand this it's the first time standing there as an authority of a doctor to say whatever the terms are hand me this give me this do this full Authority well I won't go there there's a doctor in the house Hallelujah but look at this my brother and sister that it is a New and Living Way this is not an all dead letter this is not word that we look back and say God sent a prophet and feel like that is adequate to do this this is a living word that has come right down in this church this morning to touch the lives of Sons and Daughters of God Believers as we call ourselves it is a Living Word just as living today as it has ever been in history and that brings out a point people say well do we believe we had more than the Apostle Paul had no my brother and sister we have not one ounce more than the Apostle Paul had the prophet of God even identified and said I'm preached what Paul preached but I'll tell you what we do have we have the full revelation of Jesus Christ that was revealing himself to the Apostle Paul and the word said in this day there would be a full revelation of that and there's no other age can make that claim and people want to push back you're saying that we have more that we have more no I don't have more by Revelation I understand more Louis see more because this is the culmination of all the ages and the Revelation was promised to be revealed in this day Hallelujah now look my brother and sister and I need to move on because as this is I can smell it already and that's horrible look we draw near with a True Heart right not not a false heart that's right I'm telling you what's happening things are shaking up things are shaking up people who said they believe 20 30 40 50 years one day get up and say I'm offended how can that be how can that be I tell you what they've said to themselves for years I don't like that but I don't know how to articulate they've never liked it never liked it can I drive that home to you they have never liked that and the tolerance you know you guys gave me permission you know as I get older you said you can be bolder brother Paul that's fine why aren't we just born bold we're not we're not born bull and the unbeliever might sit in the house of God for season after season after season and that spirit is getting bolder and bolder until finally it feels bold enough to stand up and say don't believe a word of it well you know I'm supposed to be impressed you're supposed to be impressed but my Bible said a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways and then you just watch their lives and they're tottering here and tottering there well what about this church no good I don't like that church what about this church no good I don't like that church and they can't even find a place to call a spiritual home or they turn around and completely go back and become trinitarians again and that just tells you never actually believed so we've got to come with a True Heart in a full Assurance of Faith having a heart sprinkled from an evil conscious and our bodies washed with pure water now my brother and sister I want you to really focus on verse 23. let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering I can think of several examples and it they don't make our heart happy but I'm not going to shy away from speaking them we prayed for a little sister up in Canada and as we're praying for her we see her withering away and when she passed from this life she was nothing but bones and until she lost her voice her profession was Jesus Christ is my healer never wavered while this demon called cancer gnaws away at her to bring our sister down to Skin and Bones and she's still there saying he is my healer and I trust him and knowing that from one breath to the next she's perfectly whole well I can't I can't believe that if God's our healing he's answered do it here he's going to do it now no I'm sorry I've given my life into his hands he's the one that's giving direction to my life he's the one that's in control and if he says this is what I'm doing then I want to say thank you Lord for including me in your plan because I tell you what my brother and sister you could live in a perfect world and there's people that are on the fence serving God struggle with this they say how come these people have such good life and life is hard for us well my brother and sister you've got it hard right now like Lazarus but you're going to be blessed they've got it good right now and they're going to be cursed you get to choose but as we have said in this church many a time you pay now or you pay later but you will pay and it all depends on what we want we can pay now or we can pay later now look at this our bodies washed with pure water and I'm going to move on here because I'm getting distracted look at this my brother and sister we are in this world are we not but we're not of this world amen so as we journey in the land now just just remember for a moment where I'm coming from as we journey in the land we find that the dirt of the world settles on us if it did not in the natural we'd never have to take a bath but the dirt of this world settles on us you can go my I'm telling you what some of the worst experiences I've had in the world in the last while have not meant me at some kind of ball game or me at some kind of whatever event it's been me in the grocery store and you walk in a grocery store and it's like oh my they forgot to dress before they left their house oh my look at these behaviors look at and you hear profanities that shouldn't be uttered even in their darkest dungeon and they're uttered in front of their children in front of people in public and this is the world we live in and my brother and sister as we work in this world you have the dust and the dirt of this world settle upon you and we go home in the natural and take a shower to deal with the dust and the dirt we come my brother and sister in a spiritual realm in a context we must do something to deal with the dust and the dirt of this world we cannot just say well I'm a Christian it doesn't affect me I would deny even the strongest Christian cannot say that going out and I say this in humor brother Donnie spoke in an open Forum I believe I can repeat this but brother Donnie one time recounting he said you know he stopped and looked a little something in the in the grocery store Walmart I was in Walmart and he said I looked a little something and I was walking to catch up with my wife sister Carol and as I see beyond Carol I see two young girls and they're walking pointing at sister Carol snickering and as they are going along their distance and they walk on by Sister Carol doesn't even pay any attention to him she just walks on by and they're looking back and the girl runs right into the post now it's funny in the humor but brother Tony is taking it into a spiritual realm you see my brother and sister somewhere beyond the Snickers and all of the filth of laodicea somebody's going to get the post somebody's going to come to a startling stop in their life and they're going to say what happened there's going to be people that are going to look one day and say how did I end up here and and in all sincerity they'll be thoroughly confused so we see that the dust of this world seems to settle and as I said already one works in the natural so what do we do we need a good cleansing not a Paul hurry up through the shower oh ring around the collar cleansing but a real honest cleansing to get out and do this and we know my brother and sister in the world we live in we barely have to do anything you can't even walk out and get the mail but what you look down and your hands are dirty now I live in a little different world than most of you do you guys have enough Asphalt in your world that it kind of alleviates that but in our world you you can't even you can't haul the trash out you can't go to the mailbox but you come back and you realize hmm my hands are dirty and there has to be something that we do about that something changes in human nature my brother and sister when we come to the place we no longer care we lose hope and we quit washing ourselves I'm talking in the natural if you've ever been in the far reaches of Argentina poverty is so rampant even amongst the Believers it's heartbreaking I've left a lot of your money there and you know it's interesting it sets the Believers apart from those in those little squalor Village the Believers in pretty much what you would call rags clean when you look around you there's a lot of dirty people I'm talking in the natural why they've lost a hope but God by God's grace my brother and sister our hope is not based on our bank account our hope is based on the fact that we've went behind the veil in the flesh of Jesus Christ and we can now say We Are One With Our Redeemer we are one with a body that we call the word we are one with this we are not separated and my brother and sister to take a position that we are separated from Our Redeemer from our bridegroom is to say I'm lost I don't have revelation of who I am and who he is but we have a revelation today Can someone say Amen that we know who we are I am a part of Jesus Christ I'm a part of my redeemer I'm not just some little poor ragged individual that got saved I'm a part of him amen and when he is there the prophet of God says wherever Jesus Christ is the Supernatural is present and I'm telling you my brother and sister it's because we are not taking that promise that we're not seeing the supernatural people say I don't see it I don't see it where is it out I've had people speak to me brother Paul where is the Supernatural Well what we got to do is quit just going to church quit being religious quit being message Believers and we've got to get into his flesh we're going to get into that Veil because wherever he's at the Supernatural is present do we believe that today Hallelujah the problem is we're comfortable with going to church now when something changes in the human nature as I said they no longer care you'll see they quit washing themselves now Sister Jerry and I many times in a certain place in Chile have passed by this and we're talking about people with no inhibitions used to walk by there and there was some stuff piled on this corner you realize people are living there and they were strategic it wasn't that they chose the corner they chose the fire hydrant next thing you know they've dug a hole in the dirt Bank they've lined it with pallets they put pallets for a roof they found 10 for that they've made a door but I'm telling you Saints with a little humor it's shocking when one day they're in Chile you're driving up to this stop sign and here's a man has cracked the fire hydrant so a spray of waters out there and there he is just as he was born standing right on the side of the street with a bar of soap what was it abject poverty doesn't even have a house to call his own there's a little kids up playing in the dirt but there was something in them I want to be clean you realize that's what sets the bride of Christ away from the rest of the world you have an intense desire to be clean you don't want to just look like the world my brother and sister we can jump and we can shout but the prophet of God says don't uh uh oh how did he say that I'm going to mess it up now amen you need to live as high as you jump or be able to live it when you come down or however my mind just scrambled that but look at this my brothers and sisters as we do this so in this change in humanity some lose hope and some say I can't live like that I have to wash even if it would be a man of zero inhibition standing literally on there's no sidewalk there but in the gutter of the street washing in the water from a fire hydrant and he didn't care why because his desirably clean now look you imagine how it'd be comes out there with four little walls and sets them up with a little deal over it and you know has a little door and a partition place to hang his towel put his bar of soap you know what had happened the next truck that come by be nothing he said I don't need formality I need to be clean put on your spiritual thinking help I don't need formality I need to be clean amen now sorry I present it to you in such a way amen now look at this we want to go in first John 2 14. I I hope I can lay this out to you today I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I've written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of God abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one what a testimony what what a word of confidence that is spoken here he says love not the world neither the things that are in the world and if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world now look what he's doing he's identifying when you say well love not the world and we can look out here and say there's a lot of good things in this world there's a lot of good people in this world but my brother and sister we have to look a little deeper than the surface and he says for all that is in the world can this really honestly Define the world it really honestly does because if there's an absent of light Darkness pervades for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh my gets down to some rough business here Saints we get squeamish come on let's face it Saints we get squeamish well like this message but we don't want to talk about the lust of the flesh oh and we don't want to talk about the lust of the eyes or even a prophet said I hang across from my rearview mirror and when I see it he saw it don't act all so shocked you know spiritual like the prophet of God never know he's the prophet no sir he hung that cross on his mirror because after the first look he needed a place to focus amen otherwise come on let's be honest Brothers we've looked twice and then we said Lord forgive me what we need is that inspiration to focus on that because this is the world right that's not too straight is it wives don't be shocked if your husband nodded his head yes when he said he looked twice do you realize the spirit of laodicea is the Same Spirit as in the beginning and it caused a whole world to be turned upside down in the beginning what is it going to do in this day but I tell you what God's doing he's moving upon Sons and Daughters of God to change their life that we are new creatures in Christ Jesus creatures as it were with tunnel vision the loss of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and this is actually one that I would say there's a lot of good people that don't suffer from these other factors but the pride of life overcomes and you say well I'm not a proud person but you know what we wore sarcar on Sunday instead of going to church amen we will mow the grass or we do these things that are more important to us on Sunday than it is to go to the house of God and you know what that all comes down to it comes down to the value you place on Jesus Christ now I understand there are things in our life that prevent us sometimes as it would be certain circumstances uh of Employments and different things that that would keep us from that but I'm talking about that habitual deal where it's not a not a old Lord I want to be in the house of God today you know I'll just tell you this happened last summer I I was coming up I was all scheduled to preach and and then you know they come along and the dairyman says uh you know um we've got all this hey bot but we don't have hay here on the dairy and we need you guys to put this hay up this weekend so we can feed it to our cows and I was like Lord seriously there's like a hundred and some acres in this field there's no way I can make it to church and I was like Lord just what do I do what do I do and I I almost called brother Chris almost called Brother David you know like you guys gonna have to cover this but I had a burden to preach what I was going to preach and you know I got up Sunday morning and it had rained thank you Lord It's not often that a hay farmer says oh thank you Lord for rain on the hay crop then I got up that morning thank you Lord and I get to go to church and I get to preach what's burning in my heart and so the Lord knew where I was at but you see my brother and sister when we get to the place that other things have more value and it what it is it's a pride of life this is important to me am I getting too strident and the world passeth away and the loss thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever I'm on board on this abiding forever amen I'm on board for eternal life amen you know some people say well I don't know if it's real or not seems like it doesn't matter seems like it is yes I hear the devil too I hear the devil too you know just like you know hearing you know some pop star rock star whatever singing Amazing Grace I hear their voice the words they're saying is good words but the pride of life behind it why because a manager I read this come straight out of their horse's mouth a manager says you will reach out to the Christian crowd and get their money also no sorry I'm not going to listen to some guy that worshiped the devil last night and sings Christian song today I don't want to listen to him amen but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever now look what Satan wants to put on his Saints each one of these Satan now Brothers you don't have to say amen I just simply know it is a fact Satan wants to put the lust of the flesh on men and women we always Focus said sorry sisters I couldn't spare you we always focus it on men men issues with us no I'm sorry no I'm sorry what happened in the garden wasn't a man thing it was a woman thing and the man was a part of it we won't go into that we know what brother Brown said but see the devil wants to put the lust of the Flesh and that will sneak up on us and the lust of the eyes that will sneak up on us and pride of life that will sneak up on us and say but brother Paul I'm not backslid no you're not unless you don't get washed from that and if you let the I think this is a joke sisters do not crucify me I don't want to be locked outside and banned from fellowship today but you'll walk into somebody's house please find humor please I beg you find humor you walked into somebody's house and you're there and they say look um forgive me but I just haven't had time to do the house cleaning lately and as you brush some great big megawatt cobweb out of your way you're like I understand yeah no we were going to go to town and eat the same it's the dirt in our lives do you know Saints we don't even need to try to explain I've been having a hard time preacher oh some are going to say he's been derogatory no I'm not I'm telling you God wants it to be obvious right can you hold on that you're all quiet can you hold on we want to hide it let's take it back to the Garden we want to hide it as a prophet of God tells us Adam and Eve should have been running through the garden oh Father father where are you at the nature I just want to hide this and the dirt in our lives my brother and sister we think it's hidden but just as the cobweb starts to grow and it's obvious the dirt in our lives is obvious God help us I'm not criticizing no one I just want us to be aware and you know they saved for the first step of recovery is acknowledging there's something there that needs to be changed and I say God help us when we see the little clutter of the dirt of our life building up in our life and we do nothing about it Satan's convinced us we're okay and I'm going to read you some scripture here in a minute that we'll just touch on that and see how Jesus chooses to deal with this amen so look what Satan wants to put on us though of these things no natural washing will take those away that's why it says well you know I I I had some troubles in my life I got baptized again I met a man one time he said brother Paul he said I've just been through everything so much in my life so many problems he said I think I've been baptized five or six times I don't even remember how many times I've been baptized and I'm thinking oh okay and he says but let me tell you the last time it stuck I was like well that's the way to look at it amen he come to a place in his life but you see my brother and sister it isn't necessarily necessary to go back every time we do because imagine we just have to be like we were in a sheep dip and when you guys walked in the door of the church it would be Splash and you would come out and go to church that's not how it works but God says I am going to wash you I don't got to baptize you again but I'm going to wash you again and again and again and again and again and I'm going to wash you so many times that you're going to say Lord why do I keep failing and he's going to say come let me wash you again Hallelujah look let's face it we don't even have to get technical the spirit of Sodom is here I jokingly say this I I preached probably 10 12 years ago well it's got to be the coming of the Lord right now because this world is Sodom and I didn't even have a clue I didn't have a clue that people would do what they do to their own offspring yeah and the spirit of laodicea the spirit of satanic worship unclean spirits evil is good good is evil amen but look what this is by tradition they're presentable now I hope this don't really strike you wrong but you know how they're cleansed to be presentable by symbolism they have all the right symbols they go through all the right motions they attend the right Church sent under the right pastor pray over their food won't walk out of the house in the morning on their way to work without praying for God's mercy as they travel they have all kinds of symbolism but they don't have him I don't want to offend you but I will go ahead and say this I was going to skip over symbolism God sent a prophet that's right exactly I believe the message of the hour my brother and sister unless you have got into Christ that is nothing more than empty words no different to the man who says I'm a Catholic people get offended about that my brother and sister but it's the truth because it comes to a place that they believe if they do all the right motions and do all the right things at the right time that everything is covered you can listen to a message at the right time but my brother and sister unless that message makes it down inside of us in a life-changing event you might as well be the one that gets up totally polar opposite and does whatever everybody's doing because unless it gets inside of you you're no different and that's kind of straightforward but I'm telling you it's Christ you getting into the Flesh of Christ which is the word amen and when you get into that position God will lead you you won't need a man to tell you what to do God will lead you amen oh hallelujah look we're not we're not uh exempt from the effects of symbolism but look how Jesus deals with this as we go Mark 7 then came together unto him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from Jerusalem and when they saw some of the disciples eat bread defiled that is to say you see now look don't you love how that's worded defiled well that is to say they never washed their hands defiled sounds really really serious it's against the law I mean you could be kicked Plum out of the assembly because you didn't wash their hands when you ate well anybody wants to come out to the farm and worship with me it looks like I've been disassociated yeah because I have in the Harvester you know you've all heard 30-second rule well you know sometimes during that 30 seconds you're too busy so I extended it to a minute and I found out a minute when you're hungry enough late in the evening still working a minute's not long enough I extended it to two and then it was to three and then it's extended to the time I can finally find time to reach down there and pick it up and shake the dirt off and I'm still going to eat it because everything I was eating the bread the meat the cheese all come out of the earth anyway and we saw some of the disciples eat bread defile that is to say with unwashing hands they found fault for the Pharisees and all the Jews except they washed their hands off eat not holding the tradition of the elders and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold amen I want to know Saints whether what you have today was given you to hold or it came by Revelation to your soul we start a tradition in this church Thanksgiving at the halots do we hold that that tradition or would God come one day and say no it's time for that tradition even to die because we're not about the tradition let me tell you sister Jerry's proposing a lot of thanks yeah sister cherries into change see been given to hold as the washing of Cups and pots and Brazen vessels and of tables now this is what worshiping God is like Saints we do it just like this and just like this and it becomes a powerless gospel this is how powerless churches are created because we give guidance to do it because that's how we do it and no leadership of the Holy Spirit oh I can remember a man one time telling me I tell you what I believe the message but I couldn't go to one of those churches where them people are up in the altar crying and slobbering and screaming I just couldn't do it it gets on my nerves that was a long time ago when I was a young Christian I just stood there never would have fit in on the day of Pentecost would he man he'd have got up and walked out there and said I I believe I believe in the Holy Ghost but I don't believe in this not realizing that was the Holy Ghost see see how careful it is by tradition by a teaching by a guideline by encouragement to go a certain way to uphold a certain standard of dignity instead we show Who We Are by washing cups and pots and Brazen vessels and tables you've heard the old phrase cleanliness is Next to Godliness have you ever seen anybody going to Rapture on that one no that's not a license to get rid of the dishwasher huh now look at this then the Pharisees and scribes ask him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashing hands you see my brother and sister they were so caught I hope I'm not dragging this out too long let me just hurry they were so caught up in the tradition their description their definition their idea of clean little Lysol rag we're clean we're clean spotless not a smidge of dust not a cobweb nothing we're clean this is what we were taught this shows Who We Are but look at this now no I tell you what I'm telling you if our Lord Jesus Christ the Apostle Paul Peter came back in this day the churches would empty out because everybody would say that's not my Prophet that's not my Apostle that's not my Lord Jesus because he wouldn't let's let me just go here and he answered and said unto them well half Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites he didn't even try and soften the blow Isaiah says prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoreth me with their lips but their hearts now I'm not going to change the scripture but I'm going to change the scripture but their hearts have not been washed you're far from me amen amen you're caught up in your own world you're caught up in the world what is it my brother and sister whatever flavor in this world and I'll speak direct this morning whatever flavor of the message you want is available today people would be like this is what I believe fine believe that I'm not even going to criticize you anymore I'm going to do my best just to go on because you see my brother and sister it don't fit right here here and here and then it don't fit in the message here here and here but it's what you want to believe believe it but as for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord and the Lord spoke through his word and said this is what I want you to follow I laid it out I give it to you you can tote it with you anywhere you want amen I'm telling you my brother and sister I just uh listen to a very interesting thing this individual was talking about where they were working in the Middle East and they were not a not a Christian not at all of a Arabian type descent or whatever you would call that and they were there but some man on the job went out of his way not even lawful for them to speak when uh when American is in another country like that to speak of these things but the man went out of his way and spoke to him and says if you believe and you would just receive God will change your life and the man said I pondered on I pondered on that pondered that and he said I started going and started secretly reading my Bible and he said in seven days seven days I found a Christian Church there in that tree and asked them to baptize me in the name of Jesus Christ seven days and we've got people in this message that in their tradition have been 40 and 50 years and you can't move them oh come on don't tell me we don't have all these same kind of spirits moving that are in the land this is not too hard is it amen I say this only I don't mean it to be strident I say this my brother and sister that God give us a warning kind of like the cartoon of two men standing on the side of the road as a beware danger ahead and these people in a sports car going oh these old scaredy cats and then the car goes around the corner and the sign says bridge out somebody's got to do the warning maybe they could have worded it different like have the bridge outside out where they were at but what they spoke was true wasn't it danger ahead oh Lord help us teaching how being in vain do they worship me teaching doctrines for doctrines the Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandment of God ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things you do what do you just tell them your tradition means nothing nothing you need to find Christ you need to get in the veil yeah in his body my let me hurry Jesus didn't hold anything back dealing with them one man fought cleanliness was I'm clean you know you have thoughts when you're preaching maybe just to go ahead and have the communion table out here and put a deal on that and I just stand here pretty much the whole service maybe my sleeves rolled up and preach to you while I wash my hands over and over again and then say something radical and ridiculous like well I lied to a man the other day to make some money but I washed my hands and I did a deal over here that wasn't quite right the other day Saints but I've washed my hands and I lied to you Church three months ago and none of you caught it but I feel compelled to wash my hands and you'd all backslide for a minute and I'd bounce once in the parking lot before I made it to the sidewalk because that's not who you are and that's not Who We Are it takes another washing it takes another washing I'll just skip over a couple little thoughts I have written here look let's just go right here to the marriage of the Lamb I mean I still have an hour so we have to hurry marriage of the Lamb Esther perched her heart you guys know how much I love Esther I'm telling you oh don't take this wrong but I'm going to say it anyhow if Esther was here I'd be in love with her yeah not the carnal flesh Esther Esther the daughter of God are you with me glad we got that all clarified some of your eyeballs sought open immediately Bing like whoa what's going on here no Esther my sister in Christ I would be in love with her Esther pursed her heart before God walked up with a Meek and humble Spirit the church that's going to be the bride of Christ now remember Esther refused the worldly adornment and why would it be so hard I I thank the Lord for for The Godly sisters we have but why would it be so hard for a message of the hour which we say that's the revealed word of God and it says I would like you sisters to dress a certain way why is it that we have such a struggle it has to be just the devil has to be just absolutely just the devil because my brother and sister we believe the word and the words what laid the foundation and the guideline so it has to be the devil that comes in and says you know what we're going to just apply these kind of things now this will sound kind of I hope you take this with humor on the way to church today sister Jerry drove me amen thank you sister Jerry a little stressed out a little tired we come up by the lake at the stop sign and here's a car pulled over side the road the door opened and a lady is I assume it was a lady leaning inside the car and as we drive up there sister Jerry and I I said isn't that interesting and all you see in this address nice longer dress and high heels that were so high I think it was the tips of her toes that touched the ground and I told Jared isn't that inner that has to be so comfortable now if any of you have high heels on this morning I want you to listen that's an anointing because it would take an anointing to cause someone to wear a shoe like that yeah so let's call it any of you got some things in your closet I'm not being I'm not being I'm not I'm not I'm not if you got those in your closet I want you to go and I want you to set them out on your bed and I want you to pray over them and I want you to wear the pair that God leads you to wear and if you can come to church and them things and say I prayed over and God led me to wear those then I'm going to resign she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king and a woman today the church that thinks she's going to get in because she's got more numbers she's best dressed crowd she's got the biggest organization the biggest church in the city and things like that you'll miss a million miles if you're depending on that it's a sweet kind reverent Spirit to the word of God wash by the water of the word and the word in you it's a washing amen the church needs a washing a Full Gospel washing that's right not just a part washing but a Full Gospel washing cleaned up made new creatures in Christ Jesus Oh I'll tell you what my brother and sister uh it's there look at this now this really comes on this clinches it Jesus bride is not a dirty bride he wouldn't have his dirty bride if a woman come up to get married and she looked like she'd come out of the pig pen out there a man that's got any dignity about him wouldn't marry her he'd make her clean herself up and when the Church of Christ comes up to get married thinks she's going to be in the bride with all the world tagging on to her Christ's bride won't be like that Hallelujah why not because the preacher said don't be like that because the spirit that is in her will not allow her to be like that something inside of her says I want to be Washed by the Water of the word I don't want to be washed by message as it were my Nazarene or Baptist or whatever I want to be washed by the word oh my brother and sister it's a word that changes Our Lives it's a word that makes us into the image of Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah look at that now now look First John 3 21 we've got to just hustle right along here beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward God and whatsoever we ask we receive we might we kind of could should maybe no it looks to me pretty positive here we receive of him because we could keep his Commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight and this is his Commandment that we should believe on the name of son Jesus Christ and love one another you know Saints for years I've read this and I know you'll be able to testify I tell you many times as we close the service love one another because this scripture became not real to me amen I must stand like a beaconess amen love one another they took your parking spot love them they took your Pew loved them amen they burnt the food at the fellowship loved them whatever it might be love them and the scripture says that love covers a multitude of sin and I know that there are things in my life that I let go oh let me just put it this way there's things in my life I let go and they have slipped from my memory oh if God wanted you to worry about it he'd bring it back sometimes God says you know what I'm just going to let you be aware that there were things that slipped and I'll cover those for you I'll cover what you should have covered because that's who I am I'm your savior I am just beyond the Veil you've come into the veil I take care of it oh amen I got lost here love one another as he give us commandment and he that keepeth his Commandments dwelleth in him and he and him and hereby we know he abideth in Us by the spirit which he has given us okay full stop self-test what kind of spirit do I have you know I didn't choose to include in my mind as well because I'm going to preach on it there's a whole multitude of quotes the prophet of God speaks about people with a temper enough to fight a buzzsaw he even talks about him being in church and jumping and shouting and praising God and speaking in tongues and the next morning fight a buzzsaw that's not Who We Are that's not who we are Saints amen What Spirit has he given us amen he's given us a Holy Spirit he hasn't given us a worldly spirit you know there's often talk go to the ball game everybody has the idea that everybody immediately goes to the Ball Game and starts jumping out of their seat and screaming you know that's not true I've been to a couple ball games in my life announcers up there now who can Mama and everybody over here and who is the left louder or the right louder is the end feel louder and pretty soon people are like I thought about trying that at church but I didn't quite know how to go about it hey man this uh well let's see which way are we looking I'm going to take it from your point of view right side of the church has got more amens in them than the left side can you prove that for me and the left side and say how dare you say we don't have amens in US and then it'd come and it's chaos Jesus didn't come down with a microphone and start saying okay everybody that's our believer let's stand to our feet and let's prove it but humble quiet Meek Spirit comes down and it starts to move you know I miss admits might be in the kitchen sister doing your dishes might be doing that favorite thing the wash and the Holy Ghost comes down and something stirs in the heart God maybe reminds you when he touched your little baby with a fever remind you of a circumstance maybe a car almost hitting your child you want to know a god shaking moment I can take you right to the place I'm sure Jerry can too I was mowing hay I did did a lot of that for a living we didn't break it we didn't bail it I just mowed Hay all over this Valley One Day Jared brought me lunch we were in South Nampa and she's giving me the lunge there our son Joel got out of the car was disobedient was running around Jerry kept telling him get back over here and a car was coming and turning there's our son on the side the road I think we both screamed at the same time Joel but he ran across the road right in front of that car then he fell down the bar ditch on the other side so when the car goes by it's not visible and you almost die on this spot the lady slammed on the brake slid to a halt jumped out of the car and said oh my god I've killed your son where is he and then our son climbed up out of the bar ditch we took him over on the other side of the road after the car was gone and whipped him but you see how callous we can get oh her son's just being disobedient get over here get over here get over here get over here I told you get over here get over here get over here and the Lord said get over here and we just run everywhere we want to run and he says you know what I I'm going to take it I'm not going to take a dirty bride get washed come on Church get washed come for your washing today Church come on get washed and look how patient God is with us that we just go on in life and he's here reminding us over and over again get washed washed get washed amen don't show up there that day with even a smudge on the Hem of your garment get washed let me hurry here I want to read this last quote to you I'm going to skip right to it skip over my other thoughts here sister Emmy will you come brother Sean let us hear the cap of all of it Zechariah 4 6 is where I'm going to close at right here the Bible said not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord not by wisdom not by knowledge not by nomination but with my spirit I will watch now look how the prophet opens this door did he change the word I don't believe so there are some critics that are like he quoted the scripture wrong while they quote everything else wrong by my spirit I will energize my word the disciples had it sowed into them then the Spirit came to energize the word see not by power not by my not by wisdom not by understanding not by this not by that but by my spirit I will energize my word but my spirit saith the Lord is the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God and makes it work oh I'll tell you Saints let's just stand here amen I'm not making an altar call I'm not trying to do that but I just encourage you right now maybe just lift a heart a hand and say Lord Jesus just let the word come and just wash me maybe maybe on the back of my as it were maybe behind my ear maybe a little something here that needs to be cleaned up in my life Lord just please come Wash Me by Your Word because I have a harsh desire Lord to be clean I have a harsh desire to stand that day in your presence and because my heart does not condemn me I have a confidence of boldness I kind of skipped over a portion of this today because of time Saints but let me just say it real quick here when you have been completely washed you can come with a boldness like you have never ever experienced in your life and the word of God says that when you come boldly he'll give to you the desires of your heart you need a child saved you need a relationship saved you need someone in your family healed you need a Deliverance in the family or in your own life let the word wash us let the world wash us and then Saints we can come boldly into his presence and say Lord I got a husband that needs saved I've got a wife that needs save I got children that need saved I need more of you Lord but what do we do by this washing it takes away the hindrance that Satan has that keeps our boldness from us oh Lord I want to be bold oh Lord from the depths of my heart today I don't mean to be emotional Lord but Lord I want to be pulled Lord I just ask you just come down not by the preacher's words Lord but by your Holy Spirit just come and wash us wash the old bitterness away yes years and years of disappointment breeds dinner bitterness Wash It Away Lord I just ask you Lord I've become weary let your Holy Spirit Come just wash that away from you Lord I don't want to be a weary Christian I want to be a vibrant on fire oh I want to be a weapon in the hands of my Lord to live this word to vindicate the word of the hour through my life that's what I desire Lord I just ask you Lord come down touch each heart touching circumstance I feel the Holy Spirit moving I feel a washing taking place oh it's not a public event Saints it's a personal very private event but when God works my brother and sister he does his job thoroughly Lord we give you Liberty today Lord we give you Liberty today come down father Lord if it's my elbows so to speak Lord then wash me behind my ears behind my neck Lord Lord if it's in my spirit that's been broken discouraged trampled come down there Lord in that place that I've guarded for so long Lord if it's an attitude Within Me father I don't want to fight the buzz saw Lord I want to be like Esther I want to be like Esther I want to forgo everything of this world I want to forgo everything Lord no matter how I think it makes me look and I just want to come before you with a Meek and a contrite spirit Lord you know we've preached it many times I believe in my heart that Esther had a boldness because that wasn't just a king Saints do you realize that when we just look at it like oh that's God you're missing it he is our husband he is our bridegroom he is the Lamb that gave us life [Music] oh [Music] Lord wash us today I pray Lord do that work no matter where we're at at home at work in the car fellowshipping with the Saints whatever it might be father do the work in her life I pray Lord wash us let your word Unleashed as it were upon us oh Father [Music] because I want the word of faith I want to say that again put that back up again brother Josh the very last wisdom versus faith Hallelujah look at this Saints not by understanding not by this and not by that but by my spirit I will energize my word now we've got that word in us can someone say Amen now if that word is in us and what our prayer is Lord energize the word we will be energized amen hallelujah because you see it's the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God of God oh Lord [Music] help us [Music] we lost him somewhere okay no
