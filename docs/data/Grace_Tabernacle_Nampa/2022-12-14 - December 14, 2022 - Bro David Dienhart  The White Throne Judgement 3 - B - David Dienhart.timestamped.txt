[25:38] amen amen
[25:40] that's what we need to do every day
[25:42] praise him I'm glad I know him
[25:45] I'm glad I have him Amen in this hour
[25:48] this is a treacherous the prophet called
[25:50] in a treacherous time God bless you
[25:53] God bless you
[25:55] called it a treacherous hour a
[25:56] treacherous time
[25:58] because we're living in the very end of
[26:00] the end
[26:03] of time
[26:04] we don't know exactly that day that
[26:06] moment
[26:08] that the resurrection will take place
[26:10] but we know
[26:11] we're in the hour
[26:14] we're in the time
[26:15] and so God bless you this evening and
[26:18] God bless those on the internet and and
[26:21] may those that are listening may they
[26:24] hear I want to continue with the white
[26:27] Throne judgment part three this is part
[26:29] 3B
[26:31] and because I didn't finish some things
[26:33] I wanted to get done so we'll try to
[26:35] just not go back and it'll be maybe a
[26:37] couple things we might touch back on but
[26:39] pretty much this is just going to carry
[26:42] right on
[26:43] amen
[26:44] and we're speaking of the names blotted
[26:48] out removed from the book of life and
[26:50] that's a that's a hard thing to preach
[26:52] on because people feel like you're
[26:54] speaking against them
[26:56] but we're not speaking against anyone
[26:58] we're bringing the truth
[27:01] to the people and whatever
[27:04] they want to do with it or you do with
[27:07] it that's between you and the lord it's
[27:09] not between me and you
[27:11] it's between the you and the Lord amen
[27:14] but I want to speak on the subject or
[27:17] make the subject of this tonight the
[27:19] dead hour
[27:21] and the borderline Believers the seat of
[27:23] discrepancy the borderline Believers are
[27:26] the seed of discrepancy
[27:28] now you can be a borderline you can be
[27:30] on the borderline
[27:33] but you don't have to remain a
[27:34] borderline believer
[27:37] but there is borderline Believers that
[27:39] will be borderline and then switch and
[27:41] go over and over disobey the word
[27:45] and become become and thereby that their
[27:49] name is removed why you say why would
[27:51] they do that because it's in them too
[27:55] why would it be uh you know you look at
[27:59] the tribulation Saints they remain
[28:01] virgins they re remain that way
[28:04] it's because it's in them to do so
[28:08] why is the bride the way she is because
[28:10] it's in her to be that
[28:13] you can't change that God placed it
[28:16] there he's Sovereign how he deals with
[28:17] with his with his creation he know
[28:21] before the foundation of the world
[28:22] foreknew everyone that he knew his bride
[28:26] he know those that would receive eternal
[28:28] life at the white Throne judgment after
[28:30] the second Resurrection he knew they
[28:33] would be in me those that would be Cast
[28:36] Away and the names were removed now all
[28:38] of that is happening now it won't happen
[28:40] then it's what we do with the word now
[28:43] in our time in our season our
[28:46] dispensation we have to we have to do
[28:49] make those decisions now and whatever we
[28:52] are here the judgment will will those in
[28:56] the Judgment are judged by their works
[28:58] and if they're found in the book of life
[29:00] if their works are there then their
[29:02] names remain
[29:04] if they're if the if the if the if by
[29:07] their Works they show that they
[29:09] their names have been removed then
[29:12] they're the ones on the left so let's
[29:15] stand together now the borderline to be
[29:18] borderline means you're uncertain
[29:20] if you're a borderline believer
[29:23] you're just uncertain you're unsettled
[29:25] you're unsure you're undecided
[29:28] and decided about what you're not
[29:31] certain
[29:32] the prophet said we have to be certain
[29:34] and if we're really certain about the
[29:36] truth we'll be concerned
[29:38] if we're certain that this is the
[29:41] absolute
[29:43] way to the Rapture we're going to we're
[29:46] going to do everything we can to believe
[29:48] it and honor it
[29:51] that's right amen so so to be in a
[29:55] borderline means you're not sure because
[29:57] you're border you're borderline see you
[30:00] just you don't know you're not certain
[30:02] you're unsettled
[30:03] but you don't need to remain unsettled
[30:06] there are going to be those that will be
[30:07] unsettled and will be and will turn and
[30:10] see we're seeing this happen in this day
[30:12] we're seeing Falling Away
[30:15] brother Branham said he saw a falling
[30:17] away before the seals were open they had
[30:20] he said there had to be a falling away
[30:22] there had to be the churches turn
[30:23] against the word they had to be bundled
[30:26] together
[30:27] and then and then bundled together and
[30:31] brought into a great big bundle which is
[30:33] the Council of churches which we can see
[30:36] that happening it's all brother Ram said
[30:37] they're already in it and don't know it
[30:41] foreign
[30:42] amen but the bride has the seals open
[30:44] and she having the understanding because
[30:47] of the word in her
[30:49] she will have a revelation to know who
[30:51] that Antichrist is and who it is that's
[30:54] that's later to be manifested but we
[30:57] know who it is
[30:59] and we're not uncertain about these
[31:02] things thank the Lord that we can be
[31:03] certain
[31:04] ly thank the Lord that we don't have to
[31:06] remain unsettled thank the Lord that we
[31:09] can not don't have to remain unsure and
[31:11] undecided we can know but it depends
[31:14] what's in your heart
[31:16] God had to put that he put that there
[31:18] see you're going to fit in one of those
[31:21] categories that we've been through in
[31:22] this little series
[31:24] amen it's either the real believer
[31:28] that has the revelation of the word the
[31:30] bride
[31:31] or you're going to be those that that
[31:33] are good to the people of God that's in
[31:35] your heart to do it you don't know when
[31:37] you're even doing it
[31:39] but you're you're you're you're
[31:41] considered a virgin
[31:43] but you can't come to the revelation of
[31:46] the word because you lack oil
[31:48] you remain you'll come to the white
[31:50] Throne judgment and you'll be judged
[31:51] according to your works the bride will
[31:53] not stand
[31:54] and be judged at the white Throne I
[31:56] think I've already made that clear I
[31:58] can't go back over all those things if
[31:59] you want it it's it's recorded
[32:03] so you can
[32:05] do what you want turn with numbers
[32:08] and I'm not speaking just to you I don't
[32:10] know who's online too so I'm just going
[32:12] to follow the lord if that's all right
[32:14] and preach like I was preaching to many
[32:16] in here tonight all right all right you
[32:19] just pull and God can speak to your
[32:21] heart
[32:22] amen but we're looking at this hour
[32:25] comes to a dead hour for these
[32:27] borderline Believers it comes to a dead
[32:29] hour
[32:30] and we know that we've received the last
[32:33] message to the Gentiles
[32:36] what we're looking for now
[32:38] the bride is looking for his Rapture the
[32:40] body change
[32:41] we have Rapture in US
[32:44] amen the rides the Rapture has begun in
[32:47] your soul
[32:48] because see everything we have we must
[32:50] have by faith before it's manifested or
[32:53] declared
[32:54] uh be fully manifest it's got to be in
[32:57] by faith first that's why we can say
[32:59] we're righteous and we're going to
[33:01] remain righteous why because it's
[33:02] Revelation to us
[33:04] he that's see so all these things all
[33:07] right
[33:08] now
[33:10] let's read numbers
[33:12] 13th chapter
[33:17] numbers the 13th chapter beginning with
[33:19] the 26th verse
[33:24] and they went and came to Moses and to
[33:27] Aaron this is now he sent over those
[33:29] spies
[33:31] and they went and came to Moses and
[33:33] Aaron and all
[33:35] let me just start with the 21st 25th and
[33:38] they returned from searching of the land
[33:40] after 40 days so it gives you where they
[33:42] were and they went and came to Moses and
[33:44] Aaron and all the congregation of the
[33:46] children of Israel unto the Wilderness
[33:49] apparent to kadish and brought back word
[33:52] unto them and into all the congregation
[33:54] and showed them the fruit of the land
[33:59] everyone that went over there saw that
[34:01] there was fruit just exactly what the
[34:03] scripture said they would they saw the
[34:06] fruit
[34:07] and they and they told this is their
[34:09] report they told him and said we came
[34:12] into the land whether thou sent us and
[34:14] surely it floweth with milk and honey
[34:18] and this is the fruit of it
[34:21] so
[34:22] nevertheless the people
[34:25] nevertheless
[34:27] the people be strong that dwell in the
[34:29] land and the cities are walled and very
[34:31] great and more moreover we saw the
[34:33] children of anak there that's with the
[34:36] Giants
[34:38] the amalekites that's considered the
[34:41] flesh man always a always a thorn in the
[34:45] flesh to the people of God the
[34:47] amalekites flesh
[34:50] that's what it refers to the considered
[34:52] the flesh man dwell in the land of the
[34:54] South and the Hittites and the jebusites
[34:56] and all these ites and amorites
[34:59] you know
[35:01] tormentors dwell in the mountains and
[35:04] the Canaanites dwell by the sea in the
[35:06] coast by the coast of Jordan
[35:09] and Caleb just got fed up with it
[35:12] Caleb stilled the people before Moses
[35:14] said let us go up at well
[35:17] sometime later
[35:20] no at once
[35:23] and possess it
[35:25] for we are well able
[35:27] to overcome it
[35:29] amen what is he basing that on
[35:32] the word of God he gave him the land
[35:36] all right but but the men that went up
[35:38] with him said now here's your borderline
[35:41] believers
[35:42] there's borderline Believers saw the
[35:44] milk they saw the honey they saw the
[35:46] fruit of it they taste they even tasted
[35:48] it they were partakers of it
[35:51] okay but when the men that went up with
[35:54] him said we be not able to go up
[35:56] remember they were right there with them
[35:57] they would be not able to go up
[36:01] against the people for they are stronger
[36:03] than we
[36:05] not some what a report
[36:07] and they brought back an evil report of
[36:10] the land see that what were they doing
[36:11] they were reasoning with their Spirit
[36:12] they they were looking at the outward
[36:15] appearance they didn't they weren't
[36:16] receiving the word
[36:18] the promise
[36:21] okay
[36:22] and we're not able to go up against the
[36:24] people they're stronger than we and they
[36:26] brought up an evil report of the land
[36:28] which they had searched unto the
[36:31] children of Israel saying the land now
[36:34] what does the land stand for see
[36:37] that stands for our promise all right
[36:40] which they had searched unto the
[36:42] children of Israel saying the land which
[36:44] through which we have gone to search it
[36:46] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[36:48] thereof and all the people that we saw
[36:50] in it are men of great stature
[36:53] either basing that all upon their senses
[36:56] their feelings
[36:57] their Spirit realm not their soul but
[37:00] what's in their soul is speaking out
[37:02] here
[37:04] all right and there and there we saw the
[37:08] Giants the son of anak which come which
[37:10] come of the Giants and we were in our
[37:13] own sight we were in our own sight
[37:16] as Grasshoppers and so we were in their
[37:20] sight and it goes on they murmured
[37:22] against Moses
[37:24] let's make a captain and
[37:27] and let us return unto Egypt in fifth
[37:30] fourth verse 6th verse of chapter 14.
[37:34] and and Joshua the son of none and Caleb
[37:36] the son of Jeff jeffaniah which were of
[37:40] them that searched the land rent their
[37:42] clothes
[37:44] and speak to the company of the children
[37:46] of Israel saying the land which we
[37:48] possess
[37:49] through to search it is an exceeding
[37:51] good land I'm on verse 7 of Chapter 14
[37:53] verse 8 if the Lord Delight in us then
[37:57] we will then he will bring us into the
[37:59] land and give us a land which floweth
[38:02] with milk and honey only Rebel not
[38:03] against the Lord neither fear ye the
[38:05] people of the land for they are bred for
[38:08] us their defenses departed from them and
[38:11] the Lord Is With Us fear them not
[38:14] and then the congregation said let's
[38:15] Stone them
[38:17] you may be seated turn with me to
[38:19] Hebrews 6.
[38:21] I think you got the
[38:23] just this I want to just get it to a
[38:26] point there
[38:27] that they admitted they saw the land
[38:30] they saw it was good they saw it float
[38:32] with milk and honey they saw it's what
[38:34] God said it would be
[38:35] they had the fruit of it they tasted it
[38:38] they partook of it they went in the land
[38:40] and partook of the land all right then I
[38:44] want you to go with me to Hebrews
[38:47] chapter 6.
[38:51] and starting with verse 1.
[38:54] therefore leaving the principles of the
[38:57] doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[39:01] perfection
[39:03] not laying again the foundation of
[39:06] repentance
[39:07] from dead works and of Faith toward god
[39:11] of the doctrine of baptisms and laying
[39:13] out of hands and resurrection of the
[39:15] dead and of
[39:17] Eternal judgment and this we will do if
[39:19] God permit
[39:20] watch the fourth verse I want to come to
[39:22] this for it is impossible for those it
[39:26] is impossible for those
[39:28] who were once enlightened
[39:32] and have tasted of the Heavenly gift
[39:36] and were made partakers of the Holy
[39:39] Ghost and have tasted the good word of
[39:42] God and the powers of the world to come
[39:44] if they shall fall away
[39:47] to renew them again unto repentance
[39:49] seeing They Crucified to themselves the
[39:52] son of God afresh
[39:56] and put him to an open shame
[40:01] for the Earth which drinketh in the rain
[40:03] that cometh offed upon it and bringeth
[40:06] forth herbs meet for them by whom it is
[40:08] dressed receiveth blessings from God but
[40:11] that which beareth thorns and Briars is
[40:14] rejected so now you have two seeds
[40:17] laying here
[40:19] amen but that which beareth Thorns the
[40:23] weeds
[40:24] and Briars is rejected and nigh unto
[40:27] cursing whose end is to be burned
[40:29] amen
[40:31] Hebrews 10.
[40:39] first Hebrews 6 4 there speaking of
[40:42] those borderline Believers that we read
[40:43] about in numbers
[40:47] amen the same thing comes right over
[40:49] into this age right now
[40:54] Hebrews 10.
[40:56] and verse 26 for if we sin
[41:00] willfully
[41:03] after now watch this if we sin willfully
[41:06] after that we have received the
[41:09] knowledge of the truth
[41:11] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[41:14] sins
[41:16] I want you to notice here the knowledge
[41:18] of the truth doesn't mean they had
[41:20] revelation
[41:22] they had knowledge
[41:24] okay and we'll bring this out Prophet
[41:26] speaks this because that that's quite a
[41:29] thing to people they think well wow if I
[41:31] have a knowledge no now wait a minute
[41:32] brother Adam said they never they never
[41:35] had the revelation
[41:36] they had knowledge
[41:38] something you can read something you can
[41:40] those in numbers we they had a knowledge
[41:44] they had knowledge that it was a good
[41:46] land
[41:47] all right
[41:49] all right now
[41:51] but willfulness comes from the soul
[41:56] he this born of God does not commit sin
[41:59] you make mistakes and have failures but
[42:02] you're not willful in it
[42:04] you can't have God dwelling in you and
[42:06] say you sin because you were willful
[42:08] your willfulness has gone from me you
[42:10] are a new creature
[42:12] you have no willfulness no conscience no
[42:15] desire the prophet said to do anything
[42:17] contrary to the word
[42:20] so these people if they willfully fell
[42:23] they had no revelation of the word for
[42:27] the hour or time
[42:29] though they saw it was a good land they
[42:31] saw the promise but they never had the
[42:33] Holy Spirit dwelling in them
[42:37] okay now be he said but there's
[42:41] remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but
[42:44] a certain fearful looking for a judgment
[42:46] and see look at there's no there is
[42:49] therefore no more sacrifice for sin
[42:54] if they willfully disobey it turn around
[42:57] and walk away from it reject it
[42:59] there's no more sacrifice but a certain
[43:01] fearful looking for a judgment and fiery
[43:04] indignation which shall Devour the
[43:06] adversaries so see
[43:09] that's their end time that's their
[43:11] judgment
[43:13] he that despised Moses law
[43:16] died without Mercy under two or three
[43:18] Witnesses of how much sore punishment
[43:21] suppose ye shall he be thought worthy
[43:24] who hath trodden underfoot the Son of
[43:26] God and hath counted the blood of the
[43:29] Covenant wherewith he was sanctified
[43:31] see he's been sanctified
[43:34] an Unholy thing
[43:36] but notice Sanctified he never went in
[43:39] to have the whole never went to the had
[43:40] the Holy Ghost he was on the border
[43:44] they they went over they partook of it
[43:46] they saw it they had a knowledge of it
[43:48] but they never could go over and possess
[43:50] it
[43:53] they willfully turned away
[43:57] you see well you understand all right
[43:59] now he said
[44:02] suppose ye that you thought worthy of
[44:04] who had trodden underfoot the Son of God
[44:06] encountered the blood of the Covenant
[44:07] where which they were Sanctified an
[44:09] Unholy thing and had despite and hath
[44:12] done despite unto the spirit of Grace
[44:15] then I want to jump down
[44:17] down to about
[44:20] verse 38 now the just shall live by
[44:23] faith
[44:24] but if any man draw back I want to get
[44:27] this word drawback
[44:30] thy soul my soul
[44:33] no if any man draw back thy Soul shall
[44:35] have no pleasure in him my soul excuse
[44:38] me my soul shall have no more have no
[44:41] pleasure in him but we we are not of
[44:44] them who draw back
[44:46] under Perdition but of them that believe
[44:50] to the saving of the Soul
[44:53] amen amen
[44:56] the word discrepancy
[44:59] I've mentioned this about so I want to
[45:01] mention it again the word discrepancy is
[45:03] a deviation
[45:05] the action of departing from an
[45:07] established course or accepted standard
[45:13] okay our standard the believer's
[45:15] standard is the word
[45:18] God's absolute that's the seeds absolute
[45:22] is the word
[45:23] that's the bride's standard
[45:26] and a discrepancy is a variance or a
[45:29] variation a lack of compatibility
[45:32] compatibility with what the word
[45:36] so it so a discrepancy is a very a
[45:40] variance or a variation
[45:44] all right
[45:46] that's a discrepancy
[45:49] it's it's it's a it's a lack of
[45:52] compatibility or continuity it it
[45:56] you know it can't Unite
[46:00] it's not flowing freely it's not
[46:02] compatible
[46:04] it's a it's a Clash
[46:07] all right we'll come in that in a little
[46:09] bit
[46:11] in James 1 17 you can turn over there if
[46:15] you'd like and just read it again
[46:17] James 1 17.
[46:35] it says every good gift and every
[46:38] perfect gift
[46:40] is from above and cometh down from the
[46:43] Father of Lights you notice that it's
[46:45] not father of light it's Father of
[46:47] Lights
[46:49] little lights off of the
[46:52] father that is light
[46:55] so the bride is light
[46:58] it's the Father of Lights the Bible said
[47:00] we are children of the light
[47:03] okay so it's a Father of Lights
[47:06] with whom is no variableness with whom
[47:09] is no variableness
[47:13] remember this this
[47:15] a a discrepancy is variation
[47:18] okay so there's no variableness neither
[47:21] shadow of turning
[47:23] because the message is God is light and
[47:25] in him is no Darkness if you even drop a
[47:28] variance in there a discrepancy it's no
[47:31] longer it's no longer complete light
[47:34] there's a shadow
[47:38] amen if you if you mix anything with
[47:40] white which is the original color
[47:43] then it turns pale
[47:46] it no longer remains white it goes to
[47:48] death because you've mixed it
[47:51] amen it's a mixture
[47:53] all right so so is no variableness of
[47:57] turning
[48:01] all right so
[48:04] neither shadow of turning and and in the
[48:06] message seed of discrepancy
[48:09] go to paragraph 29 here
[48:12] if you want to write those down or a
[48:15] seed of discrepancy message
[48:19] this was this was preached back in
[48:21] January 18 1965.
[48:25] so
[48:27] ver now he said now this is Harvest Time
[48:34] he said at the beginning when God sowed
[48:36] his seed upon the Earth and gave it in
[48:38] the hearts of the children his family to
[48:40] keep that word that was their only
[48:42] defense keep that word
[48:44] here come the enemy in and broke the
[48:46] barrier by sowing the seed of
[48:48] discrepancy
[48:50] now that's exactly what Satan's been
[48:52] doing all along
[48:54] he sows the seed of discrepancy
[48:56] something contrary let me get back here
[48:58] to what the prophet said I forgot I
[49:00] meant to read that
[49:01] brother brownham said the sowing of the
[49:04] the discrepancy means sowing Discord
[49:09] or being contrary
[49:13] sowing a Discord something different
[49:18] or being contrary to what's already been
[49:20] sowed
[49:23] see being contrary what's already been
[49:25] otherwise the original
[49:27] and so there again we have variance
[49:30] opposition contentions and strife
[49:33] all right
[49:34] so
[49:35] remember in Proverbs 6 19 there's seven
[49:38] there's six things and seven is an
[49:41] Abomination to him
[49:42] and the seventh one was the sowing of
[49:44] Discord all those six and the seven of
[49:47] them make is an Abomination the last one
[49:49] was a sowing of Discord among brethren
[49:53] something different something not the
[49:55] original not the standard
[49:58] just a little variation
[50:00] okay getting back here
[50:03] to seed of discrepancy he said and so he
[50:07] by sowing the seed of discrepancy
[50:09] contrary to the word of God is what
[50:11] Satan did if that was discrepancy in the
[50:13] beginning it's still anything that'll
[50:15] add anything to the word of God is still
[50:17] the seed of discrepancy
[50:21] so we come back to Revelations 22 18 and
[50:25] 19 you can't add or take away
[50:27] when you do it's a seed of discrepancy
[50:32] all right I don't care where it comes
[50:34] from if it's from organization if it's
[50:37] from military sources if it's from
[50:39] political Powers anything that's
[50:40] contrary to the word of God is the seed
[50:43] of discrepancy
[50:46] all right that's that's what we must
[50:49] remember see the word is our absolute
[50:51] anything that adds to or takes from that
[50:54] our message Moses in in Deuteronomy I'll
[50:58] go over there real quick in Deuteronomy
[51:01] the fourth chapter Moses said now
[51:03] hearken o Israel unto the statutes and
[51:06] in the judgments which I teach you
[51:08] for to do them that you may live and go
[51:11] in and possess the land which the Lord
[51:12] God of your fathers giveth you
[51:15] you shall not add unto the word which I
[51:19] command you now that Prophet said You
[51:22] shall not add to it our Prophet said the
[51:24] same thing
[51:25] he was a Vindicated Prophet had the
[51:27] interpretation of the word for the
[51:29] season then we must not add to or take
[51:32] from that word we can't put our opinion
[51:35] to it and put our own thinking to it see
[51:37] if you do so it's the seed of
[51:39] discrepancy it's a discrepancy
[51:43] and I believe if God's in you and and
[51:45] that should begin to happen he's going
[51:46] to show you that he's a discerner he's
[51:48] going to show you that's discrepancy
[51:52] amen how many have that confidence in
[51:55] the word amen see that's that's the seed
[51:57] of discrepancy you're stepping into
[51:59] something that's not according to the
[52:01] word taking another man's opinion what
[52:03] they think the devil offered to Eve the
[52:06] discrepancy
[52:08] through her reasoning through her senses
[52:10] through her emotional Realm
[52:13] amen Satan could offer something to look
[52:15] beautiful more beautiful and more
[52:17] repealing reasoning than the word of God
[52:20] and got her to fall by one word it was
[52:23] discrepancy then it's discrepancy now
[52:27] amen all right so you shall not add unto
[52:31] the word which I command you neither
[52:32] shall you diminish ought from it
[52:35] how many believe that's the message of
[52:37] it we have today was Son of God
[52:40] amen all right
[52:42] see he said
[52:45] you know you shall not diminish art from
[52:47] it that ye may keep the Commandments of
[52:49] the Lord your God which I command you
[52:51] your eyes have seen what the Lord did
[52:53] because of Baal peor see for all the men
[52:57] that follow Bill pior the Lord thy God
[53:00] has destroyed them from among you
[53:03] their names are blotted out
[53:06] amen amen been removed see because they
[53:10] went and followed something that was
[53:12] discrepancy wasn't according to the word
[53:15] of God
[53:15] wasn't according to what Moses had
[53:17] taught them being a Vindicated Prophet
[53:19] they took the teaching of Balaam which
[53:21] was a false prophet and his teaching was
[53:24] discrepancy
[53:26] and it's very clear today we have the
[53:29] same Spirits Among Us
[53:31] they come right down and sit right in
[53:33] and spots in your Feast of Charity too
[53:35] they'll set right Among Us
[53:38] what is that
[53:40] oh
[53:42] yeah Amber Alerts okay
[53:45] okay
[53:47] yeah I know it yeah
[53:49] okay
[53:51] anyway we'll continue
[53:55] I'll tell you
[53:56] through this series you talk about the
[53:58] devil fighting
[54:00] you don't know what I've been through
[54:01] with this
[54:03] yeah he didn't want this out people
[54:05] don't like to be challenged that way
[54:06] because they it it stirs something
[54:08] inside of them it doesn't look appealing
[54:11] it's not reasoning
[54:12] no Beauty we desire him but it's the
[54:15] truth
[54:18] amen amen so we'll just preach at the
[54:21] three or four if we do not preach it you
[54:24] know I don't care the numbers don't mean
[54:26] anything God knew who would be here and
[54:28] you're sitting right where God knew
[54:29] you'd be and he brought you here you
[54:31] think you brought yourself you didn't
[54:33] bring yourself here
[54:35] amen all right but therefore keep
[54:38] therefore and do them for this is your
[54:41] wisdom and your understanding in the
[54:43] sight of the nation see in the Nations
[54:45] there were other nations because
[54:47] Israel's a nation but to us it's
[54:49] denominations
[54:50] it's a spirit of discrepancy all right
[54:53] now
[54:55] but
[54:58] see but those those were destroyed from
[55:00] among you but ye that did cleave unto
[55:02] the Lord ye that did believe ye that did
[55:04] cleave unto the Lord your God are alive
[55:06] every one of you this day
[55:09] you weren't separated
[55:11] oh my such straight words huh all right
[55:15] so
[55:17] so we see there's no you can't mix
[55:20] you just can't mix the word of God with
[55:23] anything
[55:25] it just doesn't mix
[55:28] God's word will never mix
[55:31] and when a man has been born again by
[55:33] the word of God predestinated to eternal
[55:35] life called the elected what will it be
[55:37] it'll be word of God on top of word word
[55:40] on word word on word not a
[55:41] denominational Creed and then a word and
[55:44] then a Creed and then a word
[55:47] you see what the devil's trying to do
[55:48] mixing it wanting to mix it bring in
[55:52] something else mix it with the word oh I
[55:54] believe God sent a prophet
[55:57] that's not enough
[56:00] what did he say
[56:03] and you've got to enter into that and
[56:04] let that word become alive in you and
[56:06] only the Holy Ghost can do that
[56:09] all right so so word on top of word word
[56:12] on top of word word that's the
[56:14] believer's walk see
[56:16] and it and and not denominational Creed
[56:19] then a word then a Creed then a word it
[56:21] won't work you can't have that leaven in
[56:24] it only one eternal life Jesus Christ
[56:26] the word and this is a record that he's
[56:28] given us eternal life and this life this
[56:31] life is in his son
[56:34] so there's only one record of eternal
[56:36] life that's in his son and he that hath
[56:38] the son
[56:41] is has the New Birth
[56:44] because the new birth is that revelation
[56:46] of the son and you
[56:49] amen so the you you you have that life
[56:52] he that hath the son hath life he that
[56:54] hath not the son hath not a life
[56:57] amen see so if you have the son and have
[57:00] life they're no longer Twain now you're
[57:01] one
[57:03] with with the father with the word
[57:06] amen that's
[57:08] we could go into other scriptures but
[57:09] that's Saint John 15 7 Saint John 14 20.
[57:12] see all right now getting back here
[57:18] let's Okay so we can't have a shadow
[57:21] it's not a shadow to it see now I want
[57:23] to continue on paragraph 39 of seed of
[57:26] discrepancy
[57:34] I said
[57:37] yeah page paragraph 39 yes
[57:41] and a genuine Faith Of God will believe
[57:44] in God
[57:46] and God is the word it'll never add
[57:49] nothing to it
[57:50] the Bible tells us if we add one word or
[57:53] take one word away our part will be
[57:55] taken from The Book of Life revelation
[57:56] 22 18.
[57:58] and then paragraph
[58:00] and then uh it just I'll just read you
[58:02] know he said the first of the book
[58:04] in the beginning the first the book God
[58:06] told him not to break one word of that
[58:08] every word must be kept that word must
[58:10] slip they must live that word Jesus in
[58:13] the middle book came along and said and
[58:15] said in his that in his age man shall
[58:18] not live by bread alone but by every
[58:19] word that comes out of the mouth of God
[58:21] and the closing age of Revelation our
[58:24] our time in our day we're in foretold us
[58:26] that whosoever shall take one word out
[58:28] of the book or add one word to it his
[58:31] part will be taken from The Book of Life
[58:34] see can't you can't mix it therefore
[58:37] there can be nothing shadowy
[58:40] therefore there can be nothing shadowy
[58:44] just a genuine unadulterated word of God
[58:48] that's sons of God Daughters of God
[58:50] who's not born by the will of man or a
[58:53] shaking hand or some form of baptism but
[58:55] born but born in the spirit of God by
[58:59] the Holy Ghost and the word manifesting
[59:01] itself through them that's genuine seed
[59:04] of God
[59:06] amen all right
[59:09] we'll come back to more of that in in
[59:12] just a moment all right so you can't
[59:14] have nothing shadowy in first John
[59:17] 4. now the Bible said let me just say
[59:21] the I mean the prophet said excuse me
[59:23] the Bible the prophet
[59:27] that these these that have just a form
[59:30] of godliness that they don't have the
[59:33] true Revelation they are not able to
[59:35] receive the true revelation of the men
[59:37] referring to Second Timothy 3 8.
[59:40] they have a form of godliness but deny
[59:43] the power thereof see so you can't and
[59:47] then what are they denying the true
[59:49] revelation of the word for the season
[59:51] the time the hour
[59:54] you start bringing that
[59:56] that's what brings the separation
[59:58] see God's always been separating light
[1:00:00] from Darkness truth mayor
[1:00:03] amen he does it how by his word by his
[1:00:07] word the revelation of his word for the
[1:00:09] season is what he always separates with
[1:00:12] the true Revelation they don't have that
[1:00:14] true revelation of the message he
[1:00:15] brought not being born again you've got
[1:00:18] to be born again to understand or hear
[1:00:21] what the prophet's saying about the yeah
[1:00:23] what the prophet what the word of word
[1:00:25] or God is saying
[1:00:27] see he said not being born again they
[1:00:30] don't have the Revelation that those
[1:00:32] that have that form they just have a
[1:00:34] form
[1:00:36] and knowledge you can have knowledge and
[1:00:38] have the form
[1:00:41] it's like the truth like the real but it
[1:00:43] isn't the real you see that's what it is
[1:00:46] all right so you see and how can you
[1:00:50] have the real here again I'm saying
[1:00:51] without the Holy Ghost dwelling in you
[1:00:53] you can't have the real
[1:00:55] because the Holy Ghost in you is the
[1:00:57] real
[1:00:59] all right so now or have this you they
[1:01:03] don't have the seed of God and if they
[1:01:05] don't have the seed of God how can they
[1:01:06] be born again
[1:01:08] they've got to have the seed all right
[1:01:10] so the the Holy Ghost is sent to Quicken
[1:01:12] that seed he's the quickener of the word
[1:01:14] he brings the word to life and he brings
[1:01:17] that word predestinated word to life in
[1:01:20] its season that's the reason the the
[1:01:22] rain that fell on the just and the
[1:01:24] unjust was the Holy Ghost so both weed
[1:01:27] and wheat were both anointed but
[1:01:30] whatever the seed is is what you'll be
[1:01:32] because the seed brings forth of its
[1:01:34] kind
[1:01:36] amen so under the same anointing they're
[1:01:40] both anointed remember the weed and the
[1:01:42] seed are are weed and wheat God's seed
[1:01:45] and Satan's seed let's put it that way
[1:01:47] are both anointed by the Holy Spirit but
[1:01:50] what makes them faults
[1:01:51] amen is what's inside their soul
[1:01:55] not the anointing
[1:01:58] but if there's no seed there and there's
[1:02:00] a s and there's a seed of discrepancy in
[1:02:03] their soul than what they're going to
[1:02:04] bring forth is discrepancy
[1:02:08] because they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] abiding in them that's not dwelling in
[1:02:11] them
[1:02:12] that's why they'll go out and do things
[1:02:14] that are a little shady
[1:02:17] and yet profess to be message Believers
[1:02:19] and yet Shady because they don't have
[1:02:22] discernment of the difference
[1:02:27] amen I'm not saying I know who is and
[1:02:29] who isn't but I Know Who I Am by the
[1:02:31] revelation of God given to me personally
[1:02:33] identified in me personally go back to
[1:02:36] Christ the mystery of God revealed and
[1:02:38] see he said he'll make himself known to
[1:02:40] an individual and vindicate himself in
[1:02:42] that individual that individual in no he
[1:02:45] will where he belongs and who he is
[1:02:47] but without that revelation
[1:02:50] amen of the word for the season
[1:02:53] then if that Revelation isn't there
[1:02:55] which is Jesus Christ in you
[1:02:58] then it's another then it's something
[1:03:00] else now I don't know who can come to
[1:03:02] life and who can who can be born again
[1:03:03] who can't I'm just saying they will
[1:03:06] that's the way it'll be amen all right
[1:03:10] but we preach the word trusting it every
[1:03:12] one of them can be delivered I don't
[1:03:14] desire anybody to be lost that's not my
[1:03:17] purpose of ministry I'm the purpose of
[1:03:19] my Ministries to bring the truth that
[1:03:21] will set you free
[1:03:23] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:03:25] shall make you free
[1:03:27] to reject truth is bondage
[1:03:30] to receive the truth until the light
[1:03:32] comes on and said oh I see it I see my
[1:03:34] way isn't right now it determines what's
[1:03:36] in your soul whether you can receive it
[1:03:38] or not
[1:03:41] understand how many understands what I
[1:03:43] just said all right
[1:03:45] when light comes on your pathway and you
[1:03:48] refuse to walk in the light you have a
[1:03:50] choice to make
[1:03:52] the seed of God will walk in the light
[1:03:54] they will hear my voice a stranger they
[1:03:57] won't follow
[1:03:59] amen all right now
[1:04:02] so we we see here now first in in first
[1:04:06] John 4 4 in first John
[1:04:09] 4 4
[1:04:10] we go over there very familiar scripture
[1:04:12] you are of God see little children see
[1:04:16] first John 4 4
[1:04:19] seemed like my hands are cold my fingers
[1:04:21] and I can't turn the pages like I want
[1:04:22] to all right ye are of God little
[1:04:25] children and have overcome them this is
[1:04:28] first John 4 4 overcome them who
[1:04:30] Antichrist seed of discrepancy
[1:04:33] you've overcome the seed of discrepancy
[1:04:36] because greater Is He And into a person
[1:04:38] that's in you than he
[1:04:41] that's in the world
[1:04:43] okay they are of the world
[1:04:46] he that's in the world they of the world
[1:04:49] they are of the world therefore speak
[1:04:51] they of the world
[1:04:55] what are they speaking what's in their
[1:04:57] heart with the mouth
[1:04:59] see they they're speaking with the with
[1:05:02] the with the heart and with the mouth
[1:05:04] they speak what's in their heart all
[1:05:06] right see we are but they of the world
[1:05:09] and the world heareth them
[1:05:11] we are of God he that knoweth God
[1:05:14] heareth us
[1:05:17] he that is not of God heareth not us
[1:05:19] thereby we know the spirit of truth and
[1:05:21] the spirit of error now First
[1:05:23] Corinthians
[1:05:24] in over in First Corinthians chapter 1
[1:05:28] we find a very similar thing here first
[1:05:31] Corinthians 1 verse 12. now we have
[1:05:33] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:05:35] we receive the spirit which is of god
[1:05:37] that we might know the things that are
[1:05:40] freely given to us of God so therefore
[1:05:42] we have the spirit of God we have
[1:05:44] discernment to know the spirit of air
[1:05:45] and the spirit of Truth we're knowing
[1:05:47] your position and who you are knowing
[1:05:49] that the word is in your mouth the word
[1:05:52] of faith those that can't hear that word
[1:05:54] because the final voice is it the bride
[1:05:56] is the final voice
[1:05:59] not another voice the voice of the word
[1:06:01] for the season
[1:06:03] the voice that came through the mouth
[1:06:04] the Prophet this Prophet will say the
[1:06:06] same the bride will say the same thing
[1:06:08] and if they can't hear that then we know
[1:06:10] the spirit of air
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:16] huh
[1:06:21] what First Corinthians
[1:06:24] two
[1:06:26] twelve
[1:06:28] 212. I'm sorry I said 112 I'm sorry now
[1:06:31] we have received not the spirit of God
[1:06:34] they're seeing excuse me not the spirit
[1:06:36] of the world but we have but but the
[1:06:38] spirit which is of god that we might
[1:06:40] know that know the things that are
[1:06:42] freely given to us of God
[1:06:45] how are we going to know them by the
[1:06:46] spirit of God how are we going to know
[1:06:48] Heir by the spirit of God how are we
[1:06:50] going to know Truth by the spirit of God
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:56] because that seed that's in you cannot
[1:06:58] and that's the quickener of that seed
[1:07:00] then if that seed's quickened what's in
[1:07:02] you it's Jesus Christ revealed
[1:07:06] it's the word revealed
[1:07:08] I'll build my church Upon This Rock
[1:07:12] and the gates of hell can't Prevail
[1:07:13] against that revelation
[1:07:16] all right
[1:07:18] so we see then in verse 13 which things
[1:07:21] also we speak isn't that just what first
[1:07:24] John 4 6 said which thing we are of God
[1:07:27] which things also we speak not in The
[1:07:30] Words which men's wisdom teacheth
[1:07:33] but which the Holy Ghost teaches so it's
[1:07:35] the wisdom of the world it's not the
[1:07:38] wisdom of of seminaries it's not the
[1:07:40] wisdom of man it's the wisdom of God
[1:07:43] which we speak
[1:07:45] it's a Word of Faith it's revelation
[1:07:49] and what Cain hated Abel about was that
[1:07:52] Abel had revelation
[1:07:56] amen and God said that's my way that's
[1:08:00] how I deal with the people that's what
[1:08:02] I'll bring forth in every age I'll
[1:08:04] identify those and accept those and
[1:08:07] recognize those that have the revelation
[1:08:09] of my word because that's me in them
[1:08:14] all right now which things we speak
[1:08:18] not in The Words which man's Wisdom
[1:08:20] teaches that's the world's language see
[1:08:22] but but which the Holy Ghost teaches
[1:08:24] comparing spiritual things was spiritual
[1:08:26] but the natural man receiveth not the
[1:08:28] things of the spirit of God for they are
[1:08:31] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[1:08:33] them because they are revealed
[1:08:36] spiritually discerned
[1:08:39] amen said he that knoweth God heareth us
[1:08:42] all right just wanted to drop that in
[1:08:46] all right now
[1:08:49] so
[1:08:50] with that in our hearts knowing that's
[1:08:52] there see then Jesus Jesus said I am my
[1:08:57] father one
[1:08:59] amen Saint John 10. see
[1:09:02] he my father's given them me
[1:09:07] amen all right
[1:09:09] then that means that shows that we are
[1:09:11] one when you get that Revelation that
[1:09:14] you and God are one you and your father
[1:09:15] are one nothing's going to shake that
[1:09:18] out nothing can shake it out
[1:09:20] you're not Twain You're one Prophet said
[1:09:23] they're no more Twain talking about the
[1:09:24] bride today after the opening of the
[1:09:26] seal they are no more Twain They Are One
[1:09:31] all right now
[1:09:37] uh I just
[1:09:40] let's go to Jude a minute just over here
[1:09:42] to Jude real quick
[1:09:48] in Jude
[1:09:50] of course the one chapter in Jude so I
[1:09:53] want to read I could read a lot out of
[1:09:55] this but I think I'll just read uh from
[1:09:58] verse 11. woven to them for they have
[1:10:01] gone in the way of Cain
[1:10:03] see
[1:10:05] discrepancy now ran greedily at the heir
[1:10:08] of Balaam his teaching
[1:10:10] we're all one no we're not all one
[1:10:13] see we can show you scripture on that
[1:10:16] where God said they're not amongst the
[1:10:18] Nations
[1:10:20] I've separated them from that
[1:10:22] they're not all one I don't care where
[1:10:25] that Spirit Rises up that discrepancy
[1:10:28] you're not one with it
[1:10:31] it's the spirit isn't people it's the
[1:10:34] spirit like we stead Sunday and some
[1:10:37] weren't here but Sunday we said well
[1:10:39] well brother they say well what's wrong
[1:10:41] with Fellowship we're supposed to
[1:10:42] fellowship with them aren't we
[1:10:44] no
[1:10:47] see
[1:10:49] no it's a seed of discrepancy there's no
[1:10:51] Fellowship between the seed of
[1:10:52] discrepancy and the word
[1:10:55] we could go back to First Corinthians
[1:10:57] right here and I'll just refer to it
[1:10:59] real quickly you don't have to turn but
[1:11:01] unsay I mean second Corinthians chapter
[1:11:03] six
[1:11:06] it said right there
[1:11:07] it said it said wherefore come out from
[1:11:10] among them and be separate saith the
[1:11:12] Lord and touch not the unclean thing and
[1:11:14] I'll receive you
[1:11:16] see see because the spirit of foreign
[1:11:19] spiritual fornication is idolatry
[1:11:23] that's simple you were there Sunday I
[1:11:25] think we we covered that and what
[1:11:28] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:11:29] Idols for you are the Temple of the
[1:11:31] Living God and God has said I will dwell
[1:11:33] in them and walk in them and I will be
[1:11:34] their God and they shall be my people
[1:11:38] see and how can two be not unequally
[1:11:40] yoked together see with unbelievers for
[1:11:43] what Fellowship hath righteousness with
[1:11:45] unrighteousness what communion hath
[1:11:47] light with Darkness
[1:11:49] I'm not saying be nice to him and not
[1:11:51] talking about that I'm talking about a
[1:11:52] Divine Fellowship there's no Fellowship
[1:11:54] there there's no Oneness there we're not
[1:11:56] one because we happen to believe both
[1:11:58] with the group see and and want to come
[1:12:00] well what's wrong we all believe the
[1:12:02] same thing we believe the same Prophet
[1:12:04] we do this we're all we all related we
[1:12:06] all believe the same God will come
[1:12:08] together let's Feast no watch what Jude
[1:12:10] said
[1:12:12] he said these are he said the air
[1:12:14] greedily off the air of Balaam for
[1:12:16] reward and perished in the gain seeing
[1:12:17] of core what did Cora do he rose up the
[1:12:19] gun see authority of the prophet
[1:12:22] of his word of his message see while you
[1:12:25] make yourself only the only Holy One
[1:12:27] among us see all right you could go back
[1:12:30] into read more about that verse 12 these
[1:12:33] are spots
[1:12:35] in your Feast of charity
[1:12:38] when they Feast with you feeding
[1:12:40] themselves without reverence no fear see
[1:12:43] clouds they are without water carried
[1:12:45] about with winds just moved over every
[1:12:48] little doctor and every little thing
[1:12:49] come along trees whose fruit withereth
[1:12:52] without fruit twice dead plucked up by
[1:12:54] the roots what are these spots they're
[1:12:57] mixing the world with the with the
[1:12:59] message
[1:13:00] they're mixing psychology with the
[1:13:02] message
[1:13:04] come out of it and be separate
[1:13:07] they want to you know here's the thing
[1:13:10] God said you know just like this
[1:13:11] situation where you say well
[1:13:14] God God said there's a measure of
[1:13:16] suffering for the people of God how many
[1:13:18] know that's true
[1:13:20] yeah we have to go through trials and
[1:13:22] tests brother Branham even said what's
[1:13:24] better than comfort and peace is trials
[1:13:27] and tribulations that's what he said
[1:13:29] what's better
[1:13:32] he said because it brings out something
[1:13:34] out of you bringing and God knows how to
[1:13:36] do that but what about those ones that
[1:13:38] go out here not not considering what
[1:13:40] God's plan is and said why dear one you
[1:13:43] don't have to suffer like that you don't
[1:13:44] have to go through these kind of things
[1:13:46] and what are they dealing in the realm
[1:13:47] of the spirit Realm
[1:13:50] all of us just bring Comfort not knowing
[1:13:52] what they're doing they're working right
[1:13:54] against the will of God because Brother
[1:13:56] Brad said you better be careful who you
[1:13:58] pray for and how you'd cast that devil
[1:14:00] off of them like that he said because
[1:14:02] God may be allowed that to come upon
[1:14:05] them working with them to bring them to
[1:14:07] a position of recognition buy that and
[1:14:09] through that
[1:14:11] unless you know that for sure don't you
[1:14:13] do that see you're working right against
[1:14:15] the very plan of God God brought these
[1:14:18] things he said it's a struggle to live
[1:14:20] in this time in this hour
[1:14:22] sure we believe the word sure we believe
[1:14:24] that God will deliver but God uses these
[1:14:27] things and we'll be unto us we go back
[1:14:29] and try to remove what God's trying to
[1:14:31] do we better be careful what we're doing
[1:14:36] and a lot of these books so-called
[1:14:39] psychology books they got out today want
[1:14:42] to push that thing upon the people and
[1:14:44] and dwell in that Spirit realm that's
[1:14:46] exactly what the devil did
[1:14:48] he brought to to Eve something that
[1:14:51] looked reasonable something that looked
[1:14:52] like this you don't have to go through
[1:14:53] that why little one now let me hear let
[1:14:55] me explain to you what God meant
[1:15:01] be careful we're walking don't don't
[1:15:03] accept anything that works against the
[1:15:05] word of God the plan of God what God
[1:15:07] Said
[1:15:09] but they're not Consulting the prophet
[1:15:10] like David did he put the put the Ark on
[1:15:13] a new cart and never consulted the word
[1:15:15] that was in the midst of them Nathan
[1:15:17] the prophet until he woke up and said
[1:15:21] wait a minute something's wrong here
[1:15:24] this this arc on a new cart just killed
[1:15:26] two men
[1:15:27] it stumbled they tried to well we need
[1:15:29] to protect the word
[1:15:32] see
[1:15:34] how subtle Satan is he makes it look
[1:15:37] real reasoning and that's what that's
[1:15:39] what these a lot of these self-help
[1:15:42] books we we have a perfect word we have
[1:15:45] a perfect Deliverance through the word
[1:15:46] why don't we just stay with the word and
[1:15:49] go back and consult what God used to
[1:15:52] bring the interpretation of the word in
[1:15:54] our day and consult what that Prophet
[1:15:56] said about it
[1:15:57] instead we try to mix it
[1:16:02] you can't mix it
[1:16:05] all right
[1:16:08] I know that doesn't set with so it was
[1:16:10] some but anyway I don't mean here so
[1:16:12] much but I know that's
[1:16:15] anyway
[1:16:16] it doesn't matter doesn't matter to me
[1:16:18] because I'm not responsible how they re
[1:16:20] how they respond
[1:16:22] all right
[1:16:24] now
[1:16:25] let's get here
[1:16:27] okay so there's spots in your Feast
[1:16:29] while they feed with you Raging Waves of
[1:16:32] the sea foaming out their own shame
[1:16:33] wandering stars to whom the reserve the
[1:16:36] Blackness and darkness forever now we've
[1:16:38] read the rest of this because Enoch
[1:16:40] comes with ten thousands of its Saints
[1:16:42] see
[1:16:44] they they already were with him through
[1:16:47] the millennium they come out here to
[1:16:50] execute judgment upon all and to
[1:16:52] convince convict convince means to
[1:16:53] convict all that are ungodly among them
[1:16:55] and all their ungodly Deeds
[1:16:58] among them and all their ungodly Deeds
[1:17:00] which they have ungodly committed and
[1:17:02] all their hard speeches which ungodly
[1:17:04] Sinners have spoken against him
[1:17:07] these are murmurs complainers walking
[1:17:09] after their own lust with their mouth
[1:17:12] speaking great swelling words having
[1:17:13] men's persons in admiration because of
[1:17:16] advantage
[1:17:18] oh my
[1:17:20] all right
[1:17:22] let's go on a little further
[1:17:33] let's turn to Matthew 25.
[1:17:41] remember
[1:17:43] keep unspotted from the world
[1:17:47] it takes the holy spirit in you to
[1:17:49] recognize questionable things you
[1:17:51] remember speaking about questionable
[1:17:52] things stay away from questionable
[1:17:54] things
[1:17:56] avoid it
[1:17:58] amen because those questionable things
[1:18:01] if they're questionable let them alone
[1:18:03] don't mix it
[1:18:06] amen no mixing
[1:18:09] Satan will try to look make it look
[1:18:11] reasonable try to make it look beautiful
[1:18:17] that seed of discrepancy
[1:18:20] very much to the human flesh person
[1:18:22] looks beautiful
[1:18:25] reasonable
[1:18:29] but the Holy Spirit In You Will
[1:18:32] will show you what's questionable
[1:18:36] and then leave it alone
[1:18:39] amen Matthew 25 I'm just hearing through
[1:18:42] this and and I just want to get done
[1:18:45] with it so Matthew 25
[1:18:49] now we read portions of that
[1:18:52] in this series
[1:18:54] but we'll just we we just want to touch
[1:18:57] on this not in Matthew 25 and we'll go
[1:18:59] back
[1:19:00] to to
[1:19:03] this is the works that God's judging by
[1:19:07] scriptural works
[1:19:09] and he said and let's start with verse
[1:19:11] 41. now he's dealt with those on the
[1:19:14] right hand
[1:19:15] and and said how you fed me and how you
[1:19:18] you clothed me and how you did these
[1:19:20] things and they didn't even know about
[1:19:21] it they weren't even they didn't even
[1:19:23] realize when they did it
[1:19:25] and they said what we did this unto you
[1:19:27] when did we do this unto you when you
[1:19:29] did it to the least of my brethren you
[1:19:31] did it to me
[1:19:33] and his Brethren was his bride
[1:19:36] in this scripture the Brethren is bride
[1:19:39] all right then then we find in verse 41
[1:19:44] he said then shall he say also to them
[1:19:47] on the left hand now that was not as
[1:19:50] sheep these were goats now this isn't
[1:19:53] the Sheep that's there because brother
[1:19:55] Brown said as a Shepherd he's separating
[1:19:58] sheep
[1:20:00] the Sheep the sheep that heard his voice
[1:20:03] and came out and the first resurrection
[1:20:04] was the bride she's sitting with him in
[1:20:06] the throne
[1:20:09] but these are not sheep but as sheep and
[1:20:13] as goats he's 71 on the right hand and
[1:20:15] one on the left but he says to them on
[1:20:18] the left
[1:20:19] depart from me you cursed into
[1:20:22] Everlasting fire this is the discrepancy
[1:20:24] see speaking to prepared for the devil
[1:20:27] and his angels for I was hungered and
[1:20:29] you gave me no meat I was thirsty you
[1:20:32] gave me no drink
[1:20:33] I was a stranger and you took me not in
[1:20:36] naked and you called me not sick in
[1:20:39] prison you you visited me not see they
[1:20:41] had the same opportunity
[1:20:43] they met the word not even knowing it
[1:20:46] was Christ
[1:20:48] but they had it in their heart to not do
[1:20:50] nothing
[1:20:51] but these others had it in their heart
[1:20:52] to do it
[1:20:54] not even knowing what they were doing
[1:20:56] not even realizing what they're doing
[1:20:58] but they had it in their heart don't you
[1:21:00] miss this
[1:21:01] they had it in their heart to do that
[1:21:04] God predestinated and placed that in
[1:21:07] them to do it
[1:21:10] and because of that because of that
[1:21:13] their name was found on the Lamb's Book
[1:21:15] of Life or The Book of Life the same
[1:21:18] book
[1:21:20] and they received and they were given
[1:21:22] life
[1:21:23] at the white Throne judgment
[1:21:25] because they were good to the people of
[1:21:27] God helped them in the time of need fed
[1:21:29] them clothed them not even knowing that
[1:21:31] they were doing it to Christ
[1:21:33] but had it in their heart to help this
[1:21:35] person not even knowing why and I'm
[1:21:37] talking about people not even born again
[1:21:39] I'm talking about people not you going
[1:21:41] out and say well I'm going to do this
[1:21:42] I'll get life doing it no sir they
[1:21:44] didn't even know when they did it
[1:21:48] but they did it because it was in their
[1:21:50] heart to do it
[1:21:52] and this thing God put it in their heart
[1:21:54] to do that but they did it acted upon
[1:21:57] that and God's rewarding them for it
[1:22:03] see us all his achievements
[1:22:05] all is doing he he's Sovereign in what
[1:22:07] he does you've got to recognize God is
[1:22:10] sovereign
[1:22:11] in dealing with his people God dealing
[1:22:13] with his creation he's Sovereign what he
[1:22:15] does with him and he does nothing just
[1:22:17] by chance and by by a whim he does it by
[1:22:20] foreknowledge
[1:22:23] all right
[1:22:24] so
[1:22:26] we come back here
[1:22:30] you want to keep your like you said keep
[1:22:32] your garments unspotted stay away from
[1:22:35] questionable things keep them clean see
[1:22:38] but Matthew 25 41 and he said let's go
[1:22:41] to 42.
[1:22:43] 41 said depart for me you curse okay for
[1:22:46] I was hungered and you gave me no meat I
[1:22:48] was thirsty you gave me no drink I was a
[1:22:50] stranger and you took me not in naked
[1:22:52] and you clothed me not sick and
[1:22:54] imprisoned and you visited me not then
[1:22:56] they shall also answer him saying Lord
[1:22:58] when saw we thee a hungered or a thirst
[1:23:01] or a stranger or naked or sick or in
[1:23:03] prison and did not Minister unto thee
[1:23:06] then shall he answer them and say verily
[1:23:08] I say unto you in so much that you did
[1:23:10] it not to one of the least of these you
[1:23:13] did it not to me
[1:23:14] and these shall go away into Everlasting
[1:23:17] punishment but the righteous unto into
[1:23:20] life eternal so there's righteous in the
[1:23:24] Judgment other than bride that was
[1:23:27] already covered back on the 30th of
[1:23:29] November
[1:23:32] all right
[1:23:33] now I want to go some
[1:23:35] quotes here in the in the church AIDS
[1:23:38] book paragraph 128 to start with
[1:23:43] in this series on the Sardis Sardis
[1:23:45] Church age that's where I'm at
[1:23:47] paragraph 138
[1:23:51] reading from here
[1:23:53] and I want that known because I know
[1:23:55] people listening online follow very
[1:23:57] close to this church age book so
[1:23:59] paragraph 138
[1:24:05] I'm I'm sorry 128 excuse me 128.
[1:24:13] at the last part of that quote but it is
[1:24:16] even as most accurately set forth in
[1:24:18] Psalm 69 which you could read later that
[1:24:21] it is the wicked or unrighteous
[1:24:23] rejecters of Christ unrighteous
[1:24:25] rejectors of Christ and destroyers of
[1:24:28] his people whose names are removed
[1:24:34] all right okay now then we go to we'll
[1:24:38] jump ahead here to paragraph 144 a 141
[1:24:43] excuse me
[1:24:45] paragraph 141
[1:24:48] and it says
[1:24:50] here let me just read it the first
[1:24:52] resurrection has nothing to do with the
[1:24:54] second death
[1:24:55] this is at the end of the Thousand Years
[1:24:58] when all the rest of the Dead live again
[1:24:59] and in that day there will be those who
[1:25:02] come forth to eternal life and those
[1:25:04] others who are caught in the second
[1:25:06] death now we do not need to guess about
[1:25:08] those who in the second death are given
[1:25:11] life we are told it is given to them in
[1:25:13] the grounds that they have been kind and
[1:25:15] good unto the brethren
[1:25:18] if you want to know who the Brethren
[1:25:19] would go you can go back to paragraph
[1:25:22] 161 and find it out but since this is
[1:25:25] the word oh excuse me the Brethren those
[1:25:28] who are raised and cast into the Lake of
[1:25:30] Fire will be so treated because of their
[1:25:33] mistreatment of the brethren
[1:25:38] all right
[1:25:40] since this is the word of God we simply
[1:25:42] accept it there is no argument here just
[1:25:45] a simple statement of facts
[1:25:50] see where Faith lays so being unto me
[1:25:53] according to Thy word this this is what
[1:25:56] the prophet is saying
[1:25:59] amen amen all right now we go to
[1:26:03] paragraph 143.
[1:26:05] of that message
[1:26:07] same message and he says but upon the
[1:26:10] grounds but upon what grounds do they
[1:26:12] enter into life eternal
[1:26:14] eternal life eternal certainly not upon
[1:26:17] the fact that they already have his life
[1:26:18] as does the bride now he's speaking of
[1:26:20] those righteous I'm reading this to
[1:26:22] bring it out what I want to bring out in
[1:26:24] it
[1:26:26] he's talking about the righteous and the
[1:26:28] Judgment not bride
[1:26:31] those that are because but they receive
[1:26:34] it because they were kind to his
[1:26:36] Brethren they are not his Brethren that
[1:26:39] would make them joint heirs with Jesus
[1:26:41] they are not Heirs of anything but life
[1:26:43] they share No throne with him their
[1:26:46] names must have been in the Book of Life
[1:26:48] and not removed you see now because of
[1:26:51] their love for the people of God they
[1:26:54] are recognized and saved no doubt they
[1:26:56] served and helped the children of God
[1:26:58] perhaps like Nicodemus and gabelia they
[1:27:01] stood for the children in time of
[1:27:02] trouble
[1:27:04] yeah I went I went and showed other
[1:27:06] things there in that Wednesday service
[1:27:07] so you just have to go back and pick all
[1:27:09] that up
[1:27:10] but here's what I want to get to it if
[1:27:12] this seems to be a smack
[1:27:15] to a restoration which watch carefully
[1:27:17] now for the wicked are not restored but
[1:27:20] turned into the Lake of Fire and those
[1:27:22] unrighteous
[1:27:23] the names of many of those destroyed
[1:27:26] were in The Book of Life
[1:27:29] such as Judas
[1:27:33] they were in the book of life such as
[1:27:35] different one we can name them in the
[1:27:37] Bible they were in there they had their
[1:27:39] name recorded but also but they were
[1:27:42] blotted out because they failed to honor
[1:27:45] the people of God
[1:27:47] who were the Living manifested Word and
[1:27:50] living Epistles for their day
[1:27:55] amen now you see you see
[1:27:59] is now
[1:28:03] okay then we go to paragraph 149.
[1:28:09] all these people had their names in The
[1:28:11] Book of Life and their names remain but
[1:28:14] whose names did not remain those of the
[1:28:18] world system churches who fought the
[1:28:20] bride will be those whose names are
[1:28:22] removed that is who will lose out they
[1:28:25] will be cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:28:29] amen
[1:28:31] all right now that's not an easy thing
[1:28:33] that's not a happy thing to say but
[1:28:35] that's the truth
[1:28:37] so we must be careful we're down here
[1:28:39] in the opening of this word
[1:28:42] where the truth has been brought out
[1:28:44] unveiled to us
[1:28:46] amen amen to the bride
[1:28:49] this message has this book's been opened
[1:28:53] Revelation 10 is the third poll and
[1:28:55] you're that third pull you are that
[1:28:57] opened word
[1:28:59] amen you are that record
[1:29:05] Amen in that record that record the
[1:29:08] bride record
[1:29:11] that name because of course can never be
[1:29:12] removed that's the bride record
[1:29:18] that's right
[1:29:19] amen and that record is a section of
[1:29:22] that book that record is another record
[1:29:25] within that book
[1:29:27] amen and and it shows itself in
[1:29:30] Revelations 10 2.
[1:29:32] it's a little book
[1:29:34] whose names are in that book it's just
[1:29:37] the names of his bride and he takes the
[1:29:38] book and opens the book to claim what he
[1:29:42] had already redeemed
[1:29:44] here we are in the day see so no wonder
[1:29:48] the spirit of discrepancy raises up
[1:29:51] has spots in your the Feast of the of
[1:29:53] this charity
[1:29:56] see he's just feasting right among you
[1:29:58] okay I've got to get going because I
[1:30:00] want to bring out
[1:30:01] Judas which expresses a lot of this
[1:30:04] before you what's happening because he
[1:30:08] would had his name in the book and
[1:30:09] removed why was it removed brother Brown
[1:30:12] shows you here they weren't they they
[1:30:14] fought the children of God they were
[1:30:16] they never they well we just read it I
[1:30:18] want to go through it again
[1:30:19] all right
[1:30:21] now paragraph 153 so we have one we have
[1:30:26] the bride we have they're found in a
[1:30:27] section of the book then we have another
[1:30:29] class that get eternal life which is
[1:30:31] also righteous ones like the foolish
[1:30:33] virgins and those that were good to the
[1:30:35] people of God the foolish virgins which
[1:30:37] remain virgins
[1:30:39] and they help the people of God but they
[1:30:42] never themselves had the revelation of
[1:30:43] the word for the hour
[1:30:45] but yet there were good sanctified
[1:30:47] people they come right up in the message
[1:30:49] and believe it and help the bride right
[1:30:52] on through instead of fighting them they
[1:30:54] were a help to them now how what made
[1:30:56] the difference here's one Sanctified
[1:30:58] that were removed I breeded in in
[1:31:01] Hebrews 6 and 10.
[1:31:03] sanctified people but then lost their
[1:31:06] sanctification trampled and under feet
[1:31:08] the very blood that Sanctified him put
[1:31:10] Christ to an open shame the second time
[1:31:12] I indict this generation for the second
[1:31:14] crucifixion the prophet said see
[1:31:17] all right
[1:31:20] and they were Sanctified why didn't they
[1:31:22] retain it
[1:31:23] and why did the foolish virgin which was
[1:31:25] also Sanctified retained it because
[1:31:27] brother Branham said the foolish virgin
[1:31:28] retained the virginity
[1:31:32] they kept their garments clean even when
[1:31:34] they went out into tribulation though
[1:31:35] they had to go out to be purged and
[1:31:37] hunted like dogs and give their life
[1:31:40] they refused to be spotted they didn't
[1:31:42] give in to that hierarchy
[1:31:46] see all right
[1:31:50] all right now
[1:31:52] so paragraph 153 and brother Brown said
[1:31:55] okay so you see that second class of
[1:31:57] people which should not worship the
[1:31:59] Beast or become involved in the
[1:32:00] Antichrist system that died for their
[1:32:02] faith even though they are not the bride
[1:32:04] and having been and not having been born
[1:32:07] again but they will come up in the
[1:32:08] second resurrection and go into eternal
[1:32:10] life
[1:32:12] okay are you with me thirdly he said
[1:32:15] then there are the borderline Christians
[1:32:20] such as we have saw in Israel coming out
[1:32:22] of Egypt they had their names in The
[1:32:24] Book of Life and their Works written in
[1:32:26] the books
[1:32:28] these having failed to obey God I want
[1:32:31] you to get that point right there these
[1:32:33] having failed to obey God
[1:32:37] and being void of the spirit though even
[1:32:40] signs the signs and wonders were amongst
[1:32:42] them
[1:32:43] will have their names removed from the
[1:32:46] book of life and amongst this group will
[1:32:48] be ones like Judas
[1:32:50] who though entirely void of the spirit
[1:32:52] but are religious will have
[1:32:54] manifestation in their lives
[1:32:57] you see where the Deception comes in see
[1:33:00] because they're anointed by The Same
[1:33:01] Spirit you're anointed by
[1:33:04] but the word is not in their soul for
[1:33:06] that anointing to come to
[1:33:08] but it anoints a weed and the weed grows
[1:33:10] up and becomes what it is
[1:33:13] religious
[1:33:14] anointed to cast out Devils shout and
[1:33:17] speak in tongues and see these things
[1:33:19] but never able to come to the true
[1:33:21] revelation of the word for the season
[1:33:24] they can't receive it
[1:33:28] amen
[1:33:29] amen see see it's it's difficult because
[1:33:32] God is bringing this truth and what's it
[1:33:35] doing it's exposing
[1:33:42] the prophet said nobody wants to be
[1:33:44] exposed that's in our humanness nobody
[1:33:47] wants to
[1:33:48] to be exposed to something that's
[1:33:50] untruth and kind of hidden in the in
[1:33:52] their lives all along
[1:33:55] and now exposed but when it's exposed is
[1:33:58] for deliverance
[1:34:00] because there's only one deliverer and
[1:34:01] only one place of Deliverance that's in
[1:34:04] Christ
[1:34:06] and you can't you can't have a little
[1:34:08] discrepancy here and have it mix and
[1:34:11] have one thing and another mix together
[1:34:12] here and expect to make a rapture
[1:34:16] you won't make it
[1:34:18] and those that don't make the Rapture
[1:34:20] come up with the second Resurrection are
[1:34:22] found in the judgment
[1:34:24] they miss their millennium
[1:34:28] only only
[1:34:29] the bride will be in the rapture
[1:34:35] she's a part of it
[1:34:37] that's why you must be born again
[1:34:40] don't take a question don't don't come
[1:34:43] up and say you say well I don't know God
[1:34:45] doesn't want God wants to reveal that to
[1:34:47] you he just expecting you to lose sight
[1:34:49] of yourself
[1:34:51] say God I can't do anything about this
[1:34:53] it's either you feel me or I'm just
[1:34:55] gonna you'll find a pop of Bones here
[1:34:58] I pray God give us desperation
[1:35:02] make us desperate for you
[1:35:05] amen that's exactly right
[1:35:08] amen help us to learn to be dependent on
[1:35:10] you commit everything to you and wait on
[1:35:13] you that's the thing we get too
[1:35:14] impatient we got to wait on God
[1:35:19] so we see here so we see here amongst
[1:35:22] the group be like Judas who entirely
[1:35:24] void will have manifestation of their
[1:35:26] lives void of the Spirit dwelling in
[1:35:28] them though on the books were not
[1:35:31] elected in him
[1:35:32] such as Balaam will be in this group see
[1:35:35] all right
[1:35:37] now let's go back to paragraph 129.
[1:35:40] we'll find up here's something
[1:35:43] as Israel chosen people of God
[1:35:46] as Israel a chosen people of God in the
[1:35:49] majority forfeited their rights in the
[1:35:51] Book of Life by rejecting Jesus so the
[1:35:54] majority
[1:35:56] of the Gentile church will also come
[1:35:59] into condemnation with the resultant
[1:36:01] removal of their names in The Book of
[1:36:03] Life he's saying the majority
[1:36:06] the
[1:36:08] majority of the Gentile church will also
[1:36:12] come into condemnation remember a bride
[1:36:13] comes out of the church
[1:36:16] a church left Egypt
[1:36:19] a great majority didn't want to cross
[1:36:22] over
[1:36:23] but three two out of that that original
[1:36:27] two million were able to cross over into
[1:36:30] land because they believed what God
[1:36:32] spoke the rest of them had their names
[1:36:34] removed Jesus they said well we ate man
[1:36:37] in the wilderness and Jesus said in
[1:36:38] their everyone dead
[1:36:41] remember that
[1:36:42] eternally separated why because they
[1:36:44] refuse the Word of Promise and rejected
[1:36:47] it and took their reasoning and took
[1:36:49] their own ideas and and Mick tried to
[1:36:52] mix it and then later on said oh we made
[1:36:54] an heir we we need to go up no they were
[1:36:56] already removed
[1:36:58] and Moses said don't even try to go up
[1:37:01] and when they did what happened they
[1:37:03] they killed many of them
[1:37:05] and they wandered in the wilderness 40
[1:37:07] years
[1:37:08] until that generation died off and
[1:37:10] another generation come up that did
[1:37:13] accept the promise of the word and went
[1:37:15] in
[1:37:17] amen all right
[1:37:20] a lot could be said on much of what I'm
[1:37:22] saying it's just making you statements
[1:37:24] hitting the high points you go back and
[1:37:26] study over what the prophet said
[1:37:28] he brings it out right perfectly all
[1:37:31] right so majority of the Gentile Church
[1:37:34] will also come to condemnation with the
[1:37:37] resultant removal of their names from
[1:37:38] The Book of Life by rejecting the word
[1:37:40] and thereby entering into the world
[1:37:43] echem economical movement which is the
[1:37:46] image erected unto the Beast
[1:37:48] now remember these people
[1:37:51] these people that came out of Egypt for
[1:37:54] Canaan land
[1:37:57] they all came out under the blood of the
[1:37:59] sacrificial lamb they all went through
[1:38:01] the waters of baptism in the Red Sea
[1:38:03] they all enjoyed the mighty Miracles all
[1:38:06] eight of the Manna all drank of The Rock
[1:38:07] and so far as obvious external blessings
[1:38:10] and manifestation were concerned they
[1:38:12] all partook in like an equal manner they
[1:38:16] partook of it they had knowledge of it
[1:38:21] they were enlightened
[1:38:23] they knew it was right
[1:38:26] as far as knowledge goes
[1:38:28] but what happened then they turned away
[1:38:30] and so made it and couldn't cross over
[1:38:33] they all they said partook and like
[1:38:36] manner but when they came to Moab those
[1:38:39] who joined in the feasts of Baal peor
[1:38:42] or accepted balaam's Doctrine committed
[1:38:45] what spiritual fornication
[1:38:49] they partook of another seed
[1:38:52] a discrepancy
[1:38:55] and they died
[1:38:57] their carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:38:59] for it was there that they refused that
[1:39:02] they refused the word of God and turned
[1:39:04] from it
[1:39:05] and he said that is what Hebrews 6 1-9
[1:39:08] speaks of which was brought out so
[1:39:10] carefully he said in the pergaman church
[1:39:12] age so you can go back to pergami and I
[1:39:14] don't have time I I got places marked in
[1:39:17] there
[1:39:19] all right so
[1:39:21] so let's go back here said what he said
[1:39:23] now we you know brother Bram said you
[1:39:26] know I am already over time
[1:39:28] you know we're living in the end time it
[1:39:32] is in this age that the churches are
[1:39:34] going to come together
[1:39:36] and as they are even now controlling
[1:39:38] World politics they will soon control
[1:39:40] the finances of the world he said now
[1:39:42] they're controlling World politics okay
[1:39:45] they will control the finances of the
[1:39:47] world I see where the pope is going to
[1:39:49] reinvent the Catholic church now
[1:39:53] why
[1:39:54] because those little the lens that they
[1:39:57] can't agree with on the Protestants have
[1:39:58] got to be done away with he's going to
[1:40:00] reinvent it so they can come together
[1:40:01] they've got to
[1:40:03] you see all this is happening very
[1:40:05] quickly right under and the bride's
[1:40:07] saying hallelujah I see it
[1:40:09] the others say don't know what's
[1:40:11] happening
[1:40:13] I'm talking about people in the message
[1:40:14] don't know what's happening
[1:40:16] see here it is right here now watch what
[1:40:18] he says then if they and then if you
[1:40:21] don't belong to the world organization
[1:40:23] of churches and I'm I'm afraid there's
[1:40:25] going to be some in this message that
[1:40:28] will that will come to judgment and will
[1:40:31] be and will be disappointed at judgment
[1:40:33] they've done a good life they've been
[1:40:35] good to people they've done all these
[1:40:36] things they believe God sent a prophet
[1:40:38] they go back and all these things and
[1:40:40] lift him up and and and worship him
[1:40:43] a discrepancy
[1:40:46] and be disappointed
[1:40:49] in judgment
[1:40:52] because they tied in with that
[1:40:53] organization watch this he said you will
[1:40:56] lose all you won't be able to buy or
[1:40:58] sell if you don't belong to the world
[1:41:00] organized organized they send up
[1:41:02] churches they're going to let you go
[1:41:04] ahead and believe a prophet if you want
[1:41:06] to but you're going to do what they tell
[1:41:07] you to do you got to join with them see
[1:41:09] and to join with them is the same thing
[1:41:12] they did at the Feast of bail peor we're
[1:41:14] all one why not join together that's
[1:41:16] exactly the Pope's words right now
[1:41:19] that's what he's doing that's what he's
[1:41:21] moving for
[1:41:25] all right and and there's going to be
[1:41:27] those that seem to be very good the
[1:41:29] majority well I won't go any further
[1:41:31] I could I could Point some things out
[1:41:33] but
[1:41:34] maybe not too good to say right here you
[1:41:37] those who stay true to God and keep
[1:41:40] their garments clean from the defilement
[1:41:41] of this world system of church orders
[1:41:43] will be physically bereft now I know
[1:41:46] that that foolish virgin is going to go
[1:41:49] through that brother Branham said and I
[1:41:50] think it's his first seal paragraph 359
[1:41:53] he said he will not allow his bride have
[1:41:56] her go through that time
[1:41:58] so if that's the case how close are we
[1:42:00] now
[1:42:03] amen boy we've got to know he said
[1:42:07] you've got to keep your garments those
[1:42:09] to keep their garments clean they will
[1:42:10] be presented there will be it presented
[1:42:13] to them a great temptation to give in
[1:42:15] Preachers will give in with the excuse
[1:42:17] that they will serve God within the
[1:42:19] framework of the Antichrist be system
[1:42:22] they will give in to flatteries and
[1:42:24] blandishments of the hierarchy and the
[1:42:26] people will follow these false Shepherds
[1:42:28] right into the slaughter
[1:42:30] but in the Judgment they will be found
[1:42:32] naked they will not be given those white
[1:42:34] robes neither will they walk with him
[1:42:36] you can't walk in the spotted garments
[1:42:38] of the world holding hands with the
[1:42:40] devil here then expect to be with God
[1:42:45] amen you can't do it see
[1:42:50] oh my all right now
[1:42:54] let's look at a couple things here and
[1:42:56] then then we're gonna have to close
[1:43:00] on paragraph 111 of the church age book
[1:43:03] let me just bring these few quotes here
[1:43:06] real quickly
[1:43:07] out
[1:43:09] paragraph 111
[1:43:14] concerning Judas what he said here
[1:43:17] and then in the seat of discrepancy
[1:43:20] now
[1:43:22] if now if language means anything at all
[1:43:24] we must admit that Judas was chosen by
[1:43:27] Jesus John 13 18. he was
[1:43:30] all right his name was put on The Book
[1:43:32] of Life yet he was not clean John 13
[1:43:35] 10-11 Judas was also given to Jesus by
[1:43:40] the Father John 17 12 Let It Be noted
[1:43:43] here that the choosing and giving is the
[1:43:46] exact parallel as the illustration of
[1:43:48] Moses and pharaoh
[1:43:50] Jacob and Esau for though Esau and
[1:43:54] Pharaoh were both foreknown they were
[1:43:56] not they were predestinated to wrath
[1:43:58] while the end of Moses and Jacob was
[1:44:00] glorification
[1:44:02] first Peter 2 8-9 shows both reprobates
[1:44:05] and elect even to them which stumble at
[1:44:08] the word being disobedient where unto
[1:44:10] they also were appointed
[1:44:13] but you are a chosen generation speaking
[1:44:16] to the elect Judas was numbered with the
[1:44:18] twelve and actually had a part with them
[1:44:20] in the ministry previous to Pentecost
[1:44:26] okay we know that's true
[1:44:29] the Bible says for he was numbered with
[1:44:31] us and obtained part of the ministry
[1:44:35] the part that Judas obtained amongst the
[1:44:37] twelve and then lost
[1:44:41] was not inferior to the ministries of
[1:44:43] other 11 nor was it a devilish foreign
[1:44:46] Ministry injected among the ministry of
[1:44:47] others
[1:44:48] amen
[1:44:51] Judas paragraph 113 Judas a devil lost
[1:44:55] god-given holy loss a god-given holy
[1:44:58] ghost Ministry and killed himself amen
[1:45:02] and went to his own place his name was
[1:45:05] even in the book of life but his name
[1:45:07] was blotted out
[1:45:11] okay paragraph 113.
[1:45:17] okay I just read that excuse me 121.
[1:45:21] paragraph 121.
[1:45:25] there are people who seem involved in
[1:45:27] the things of God almost 100 percent
[1:45:29] they are like Judas no one but Jesus no
[1:45:33] one but but Jesus knew exactly what kind
[1:45:37] of a person Judas was now notice Judas
[1:45:39] wasn't out here so we're not talking
[1:45:41] about people out here in the
[1:45:42] denomination we're talking about people
[1:45:44] right amongst the Believers of the
[1:45:45] message
[1:45:48] they were involved in the things of God
[1:45:52] all right
[1:45:54] so the day came that Judas did exactly
[1:45:56] what Israel did at bail peor he decided
[1:45:59] that he wanted to join with the false
[1:46:01] Vine forces enter into Financial
[1:46:03] political organization of anti-word
[1:46:06] antichrist religion and he did so he was
[1:46:09] fooled the other 11 were not they could
[1:46:12] not be for they were the very elect so
[1:46:14] when Judas left and betrayed the Lord
[1:46:16] his name was removed from The Book of
[1:46:18] Life
[1:46:21] revelation 22 19.
[1:46:25] okay so he was removed
[1:46:27] and I had Deuteronomy 4 which I've
[1:46:29] already read to you now I'm sure that
[1:46:32] you've noticed chapter verse or
[1:46:34] paragraph 122 now I'm sure that you've
[1:46:37] noticed that those whose names were in
[1:46:39] The Book of Life were a part of the
[1:46:41] religious order of that day that
[1:46:43] centered around the true God and worship
[1:46:45] of him though they did not worship
[1:46:47] according to truth what is true worship
[1:46:50] is spirit and Truth together
[1:46:55] you cannot worship God unless you have
[1:46:58] Dynamics and the mechanics the word
[1:47:00] together
[1:47:02] there's only one way to truly worship
[1:47:04] God is when the spirit and the word come
[1:47:07] together
[1:47:09] that's true worship
[1:47:12] that's true worship when the spirit and
[1:47:15] the word come together
[1:47:17] they that worship me must worship me in
[1:47:19] spirit and in truth
[1:47:24] amen you say well I worship in spirits
[1:47:26] not good
[1:47:28] and then
[1:47:30] Slide by the word a little bit
[1:47:32] while I worship in the word I have the
[1:47:35] word but no Spirit still no good
[1:47:38] this bride will be both mechanics and
[1:47:40] Dynamics
[1:47:42] a true worshiper every day we worship
[1:47:45] God not just in church every day we
[1:47:48] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:47:52] all right
[1:47:58] now
[1:48:00] and they did not worship according to
[1:48:02] truth
[1:48:04] well like Judas they didn't go all the
[1:48:07] way how Judas was chosen of how see how
[1:48:10] Judas was chosen of God he was
[1:48:11] instructed in truth knowledge
[1:48:15] he was instructed in truth he shared
[1:48:18] knowledge of the Mysteries he had a
[1:48:19] Ministry of power granted unto him and
[1:48:22] he healed the sick and cast out devils
[1:48:24] in Jesus name but when The Showdown came
[1:48:26] he sold out for gold and political power
[1:48:28] he did not go up to Pentecost to receive
[1:48:31] the spirit of God he couldn't
[1:48:34] Prophet said he could not
[1:48:38] he was devoid of the spirit he did not
[1:48:40] go to receive the Holy Spirit he
[1:48:42] couldn't he had nothing in him to be
[1:48:44] born again
[1:48:45] see only the bride can be reborn again
[1:48:48] because she has that spirit in her to be
[1:48:50] quickened I mean the seed in her to be
[1:48:52] quickened in non-elect there's nothing
[1:48:54] in them to be quickened
[1:48:56] so if you have a pull to God as we said
[1:48:58] then yield to that pull
[1:49:02] you wouldn't have a desire for more of
[1:49:04] God or have a desire for God unless God
[1:49:06] put that in you desire him he had to
[1:49:09] have a desire for you before you could
[1:49:11] have a desire for him
[1:49:14] and if you've got that desire for him
[1:49:16] then yield to that desire and you're
[1:49:19] only going to find one thing to satisfy
[1:49:21] that desire and that will be the word
[1:49:24] for its season the scriptures and the
[1:49:26] message
[1:49:30] you don't have to live under that
[1:49:32] privilege you have you have every right
[1:49:34] to be born Anew don't let the devil say
[1:49:37] well I can't make it
[1:49:40] that shows you you can or the devil
[1:49:42] wouldn't be telling you you couldn't
[1:49:47] that's right all right God won't tell
[1:49:50] you he can't you can't
[1:49:54] God's telling you who will not but he's
[1:49:57] not telling you you can't
[1:50:00] amen
[1:50:03] so press on go in
[1:50:06] I want more I want God then take him
[1:50:09] he's yours come according to the way he
[1:50:12] said to come
[1:50:17] start feeding on the source of life
[1:50:20] amen I'm making these comments I know
[1:50:22] time is running it's like the clock in
[1:50:24] the football game you know it don't stop
[1:50:26] or it does stop actually okay 122. okay
[1:50:31] I'm reading that make no mistake about
[1:50:33] it and when they fail to go on in that
[1:50:35] word their names are taken off of The
[1:50:37] Book of Life
[1:50:39] but if you're born again and are truly
[1:50:42] baptized with the Holy Ghost you'll be
[1:50:43] in the word all the way that's the
[1:50:45] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[1:50:48] Ghost you won't leave the word
[1:50:53] you'll discern it all right now I can
[1:50:55] speak a lot about the real gift we spoke
[1:50:57] about that you can be baptized with the
[1:50:59] Holy Ghost and still be lost
[1:51:01] okay I can give you quotes on that if
[1:51:04] you want we read it Sunday
[1:51:06] all right now I think
[1:51:08] oh no one more thing here just just one
[1:51:11] more thing just give me about
[1:51:14] five minutes okay now Judas
[1:51:18] or seed of discrepancy had no real faith
[1:51:24] okay let's let's find out what real
[1:51:27] faith is
[1:51:28] so first of all we go to paragraph 38 of
[1:51:31] the seed of discrepancy
[1:51:37] well not only page 38 let's let's go
[1:51:40] back here
[1:51:41] um yeah
[1:51:43] 36.
[1:51:48] so it finally headed up in Judas
[1:51:50] Iscariot and Jesus Christ Jesus was the
[1:51:53] seed of God he's beginning of the
[1:51:55] creation of God
[1:51:56] he was nothing less than God and Judas
[1:51:58] Iscariot was born the Son of Perdition
[1:52:00] Come From Hell returned to Hell Jesus
[1:52:02] Christ was the Son of God the word of
[1:52:04] God made manifest Judas Iscariot in his
[1:52:07] discrepancy was the seed of the devil
[1:52:09] come to the world for deceit see come to
[1:52:12] the world for deceit just like he was
[1:52:15] the beginning like he was at the
[1:52:16] beginning Cain his former father
[1:52:19] Judas only played church this is
[1:52:22] paragraph 36 of seated discrepancy he
[1:52:25] said Judas only played Church there
[1:52:27] there wasn't really he wasn't really
[1:52:30] sincere he didn't actually have faith
[1:52:35] he had never betrayed Jesus but you see
[1:52:38] he sold the seed of discrepancy he
[1:52:40] thought that he could make friends with
[1:52:41] the world Mammon and have friendship
[1:52:44] with Jesus but it was too late for him
[1:52:46] to do anything about it when the dead
[1:52:48] hour came
[1:52:50] the dead hour remember the dead hour
[1:52:52] came when he did this evil thing he
[1:52:55] crossed the separating line between
[1:52:57] going forward and returning back
[1:53:00] and that's that comes to a lot of people
[1:53:04] amen so let's make our calling and
[1:53:07] election sure
[1:53:08] how
[1:53:09] by letting God do his work in you
[1:53:13] for it is God which worketh in you both
[1:53:15] to Will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:53:17] then what what's to work out your own
[1:53:19] salvation submit yourself completely to
[1:53:22] God
[1:53:25] because your salvation is in him
[1:53:28] amen
[1:53:30] and if it's God which worketh in you
[1:53:32] then give yourself completely to him
[1:53:34] quit your murmuring and place the word
[1:53:36] before you
[1:53:38] holding forth the Word of Life see that
[1:53:41] you've not run in vain nor labored in
[1:53:42] vain hold forth That Word of Life
[1:53:46] Amen Let God do that work yield to him
[1:53:49] completely give over to him completely
[1:53:51] say here's my need Lord here it is I
[1:53:54] don't know what to do but I'm giving it
[1:53:55] over to you my children and everything I
[1:53:58] own in my house come in and take
[1:53:59] possession I'm applying the token I'm
[1:54:02] walking with you
[1:54:03] this is your will I give it to you show
[1:54:06] me what I should do put your finger on
[1:54:08] things that are not right and I will
[1:54:09] obey you the way you lead me work out
[1:54:12] your own salvation
[1:54:15] amen yes
[1:54:18] you certainly can't figure it out you
[1:54:20] certainly can't produce it
[1:54:22] you've got to allow him to do it
[1:54:25] because brother Branham said he's in you
[1:54:27] both to Will and to do of his good
[1:54:28] pleasure and then he said then brother
[1:54:30] Brown said if you'll let him do it
[1:54:34] see so it's a submission it's a
[1:54:36] surrender
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:40] he's not you trying to figure out your
[1:54:42] salvation and do some kind of works to
[1:54:44] work it out that's not what it's talking
[1:54:45] about because the next verse says for it
[1:54:48] is God which worketh in you that's your
[1:54:51] salvation
[1:54:54] amen all right now Judas played Church
[1:54:58] the dead hour came okay now
[1:55:01] I
[1:55:03] he and he thought he could make himself
[1:55:05] a piece of money would be popular among
[1:55:07] the people and if that doesn't cause so
[1:55:09] many people getting that discrepancy
[1:55:11] trying to find favor with man let's find
[1:55:13] favor with God not with man
[1:55:16] That's What Judas done when the
[1:55:18] discrepancies headed up in him
[1:55:20] amen that's what he done when the
[1:55:21] discrepancies headed up see he had that
[1:55:24] to do Judas you think Judas knew he
[1:55:26] thought he was doing the will of God he
[1:55:28] thought he was doing right
[1:55:31] yeah
[1:55:32] he thought he was doing a favor
[1:55:36] amen
[1:55:39] amen he had no Revelation no real faith
[1:55:43] because he said if he did he wouldn't
[1:55:45] have done what he did all right now and
[1:55:47] we know that Jesus was the word in the
[1:55:50] beginning was the word of God the word
[1:55:51] was with God the Word was God and the
[1:55:53] word is made flesh and dwelled among us
[1:55:55] then the word is a seed then the seed
[1:55:57] became flesh and dwelled among us if
[1:55:59] Judas was the seed of the enemy the
[1:56:01] discrepancy it also became flesh and
[1:56:04] dwelt Among Us in the person of Judas
[1:56:06] Iscariot and it's also become flesh and
[1:56:09] dwelling among us today
[1:56:12] right amongst the message
[1:56:15] because there's three kinds of believers
[1:56:17] there's going to be that discrepancy but
[1:56:20] God's wanting you to see recognize it
[1:56:22] amen uncover it because that's what the
[1:56:25] seal did it uncovered the devil and
[1:56:27] showed you who you are and who he is
[1:56:35] all right
[1:56:38] you're his hidden Mystery see you are
[1:56:40] his hidden Mystery uncovered
[1:56:42] you're the open word the bride is all
[1:56:45] right now if Judas was the seed of the
[1:56:48] enemy discrepancy okay he had no he
[1:56:52] never had no real real Faith but I'm
[1:56:56] trying to emphasize something here
[1:56:59] this discrepancy he had what he thought
[1:57:01] was a faith there's such a thing as
[1:57:03] having faith and a make-believe Faith
[1:57:05] there is such a thing see and a genuine
[1:57:08] faith that God will believe in God and
[1:57:10] God is a word it'll never take nothing
[1:57:12] add nothing to it okay I've already read
[1:57:14] that therefore nothing shadowy
[1:57:18] amen
[1:57:21] Judas paragraph 44 Judas had no real
[1:57:25] Faith he had a make-believe faith faith
[1:57:27] that he thought was the son of God but
[1:57:30] he didn't know it was the son of God now
[1:57:32] let's go over here and find out real
[1:57:34] quick notice the great paragraph 61
[1:57:37] notice the great thing okay Balaam did
[1:57:40] now it did when on and on finally end in
[1:57:42] the coming of Judas Iscariot and Jesus
[1:57:44] see it was Jacob and Esau we could bring
[1:57:47] It Right Down the Line all right Judas
[1:57:49] and Jesus is exactly a figure of Cain
[1:57:51] and Abel for Judas was was for as Judas
[1:57:56] was religious so was Cain religious Cain
[1:57:58] built an altar he made a sacrifice he
[1:58:01] weren't you know what an altar is he
[1:58:02] built the church
[1:58:04] okay he built a church he made a
[1:58:06] sacrifice he worshiped God he was just
[1:58:10] as sincere in it as Abel was but you see
[1:58:14] he didn't have the revelation of what
[1:58:17] the word was
[1:58:20] there's the difference
[1:58:22] There's real faith
[1:58:24] real Faith Judas had no revelation
[1:58:28] Abel by Revelation Cain thought it was
[1:58:31] Adam and Eve eat some apples or some
[1:58:34] fruit Able by Revelation note it was
[1:58:36] wrong it was blood that brought them out
[1:58:38] and he offered a lamb God testified his
[1:58:41] offering was right then he got jealous
[1:58:43] and tried to kill his brother and as as
[1:58:45] he killed his brother upon the same
[1:58:47] altar his sacrifice died on the lamb the
[1:58:50] lamb died on the altar so Judas Iscariot
[1:58:53] betrayed
[1:58:54] betrayed Jesus Christ upon the altar of
[1:58:57] God and killed him just as Cain killed
[1:59:00] Abel became was the seed of discrepancy
[1:59:04] amen so we find then that the seed of
[1:59:07] discrepancy
[1:59:10] is very religious but it does not have
[1:59:13] Revelation paragraph 26
[1:59:18] of my message here says now we see this
[1:59:21] was the true with Cain and Abel
[1:59:23] when when Cain saw that Abel's sacrifice
[1:59:26] was received and I might stop here to
[1:59:28] say why did God receive his sacrifice
[1:59:31] why did God receive Abel's sacrifice
[1:59:33] because by Revelation he understood it
[1:59:36] was not apples
[1:59:41] see
[1:59:44] it was blood which it really was and
[1:59:47] Able by Revelation brother Brahm said
[1:59:49] Faith Abel by Revelation Faith offered
[1:59:53] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:59:55] that of Cain which God testified by it
[1:59:57] he was righteous
[1:59:59] and the whole church is built upon
[2:00:01] divine revelation of the word of God
[2:00:03] till where is righteousness where's the
[2:00:06] bride's righteousness
[2:00:08] it's in the revelation of the word
[2:00:12] that's what he accepts he already showed
[2:00:14] it right there God doesn't change
[2:00:16] all right
[2:00:20] you're with me
[2:00:22] this message in in Hebrews
[2:00:26] he says the man who comes to a knowledge
[2:00:30] remember they never got it
[2:00:32] they were borderline Believers after we
[2:00:35] have received the knowledge of the word
[2:00:36] of God you get it from a knowledge from
[2:00:38] reading and seeing it and then reject it
[2:00:40] then it's impossible for you would ever
[2:00:42] be saved did you read that now have a
[2:00:45] have received a knowledge of Truth you
[2:00:47] understand it you never got it
[2:00:51] you just understand it what's he saying
[2:00:53] intellectually
[2:00:54] you understand it intellectually but you
[2:00:57] never got it
[2:00:59] and because you never got it and had the
[2:01:01] knowledge of it and he said you've
[2:01:03] tasted it you were enlightened
[2:01:06] brother Brown said the rain fell on you
[2:01:09] you were enlightened
[2:01:12] but you weren't the seed
[2:01:14] but it did fall on the seed
[2:01:19] amen
[2:01:20] all right so so I'm just bringing out to
[2:01:24] what enlightenment knowledge of the
[2:01:26] truth tasted
[2:01:27] but brother Brown said tasted but not
[2:01:30] filled with the Holy Ghost but you
[2:01:31] tasted it
[2:01:33] they tasted it they had the fruit they
[2:01:36] sought all these things see
[2:01:38] they had the knowledge that it was a
[2:01:40] good land
[2:01:41] every bit of that okay then
[2:01:44] Brother Brad said willfully was to come
[2:01:46] to that borderline and refuse to go over
[2:01:48] that was the willfulness
[2:01:52] refused to come completely believe
[2:01:56] in the soul
[2:01:58] just like them was in the time of Joshua
[2:02:03] all right
[2:02:05] now
[2:02:09] we find that every time
[2:02:12] I'm closing
[2:02:14] we find that every time
[2:02:21] that there's
[2:02:23] that that the two come together there's
[2:02:26] a Clash
[2:02:28] now watch this
[2:02:30] and we now now we find always that when
[2:02:33] these natural and spiritual spirits of
[2:02:36] churches and organizations meet
[2:02:39] with the spirit with the with the
[2:02:41] natural and spiritual when those two
[2:02:44] when the natural
[2:02:46] and spiritual
[2:02:47] spirits and spirits of churches not
[2:02:50] spiritual and spirits of churches and
[2:02:52] organizations meet there's always a
[2:02:55] Clash
[2:02:56] it's never failed to be so it's always
[2:02:58] clashes and if they cannot the other
[2:03:02] side get the spirit
[2:03:04] take it by a political power or they
[2:03:06] substitute something to upset the
[2:03:08] people's minds that's your emotional
[2:03:10] realm your mind your spirit That's what
[2:03:13] Satan did with Eve then then they
[2:03:15] substitute something to upset the
[2:03:17] people's mind to just draw disciples
[2:03:20] after themselves
[2:03:22] okay
[2:03:26] who are those you read if you read I'm
[2:03:29] not going to read it but second Timothy
[2:03:30] 3 you know heady high-minded lovers of
[2:03:33] pleasure more than lovers of God truth
[2:03:34] speakers false accusers incontinent
[2:03:36] despises of those that are good having a
[2:03:39] form of godliness
[2:03:40] but denying the power thereof these are
[2:03:43] they that lead silly women
[2:03:46] Laden with diverse lust
[2:03:49] amen never ever learning
[2:03:53] that never able to come to the true
[2:03:57] Revelation or knowledge of the truth
[2:04:01] who is it that does that
[2:04:04] this net Church natural
[2:04:09] amen they're rising up they raise up
[2:04:12] thinking they're doing the will of God
[2:04:13] but mixing
[2:04:15] the message with other things and then
[2:04:18] bringing it to the people
[2:04:21] influencing others
[2:04:23] leading those
[2:04:26] that are so caught up in in this society
[2:04:29] and that Society be careful that we're
[2:04:31] not so caught up
[2:04:34] that we fail to have time for the word
[2:04:37] it's Satan's business to do that
[2:04:41] amen
[2:04:42] don't be a silly woman
[2:04:46] men or women those that did turn down
[2:04:49] the word are coming over here and
[2:04:50] leading those that and and presenting
[2:04:52] everything else and taking and taking
[2:04:55] away from the word instead of bringing
[2:04:57] you to the word
[2:05:00] removing your time removing everything
[2:05:03] you're you've got so busyness and so
[2:05:06] busy and so busy as Satan's doing
[2:05:09] that you learn you'd lose focus of where
[2:05:12] you should be and there's a Clash
[2:05:15] the spiritual notice Abel by faith in
[2:05:18] God
[2:05:19] the carnal believer thought it was The
[2:05:20] Works see and so what happened
[2:05:24] it made a clash we find Abraham and lot
[2:05:26] had a clash we find Moses and Nathan and
[2:05:29] Cora had a clash same Clash
[2:05:32] he was Moses the leader of the hour
[2:05:34] Vindicated leader
[2:05:36] amen and Cora being carnal wanted to
[2:05:39] raise up an organization among them
[2:05:41] he wanted to make a group of man and God
[2:05:43] doesn't deal with people like that it
[2:05:45] shows right there the scripture type of
[2:05:47] our journey now that organization is not
[2:05:49] what God ordains
[2:05:54] in other words the whole congregation is
[2:05:56] Holy why you say you're the only holy
[2:05:58] man you have no right to do that do only
[2:06:00] do any such as that you try to make
[2:06:03] yourself somebody big we're all holy
[2:06:05] we're all children God's children
[2:06:07] see see what that discrepancy does
[2:06:10] God said separate yourself from him I've
[2:06:13] had enough of it and he swallowed him up
[2:06:15] in the earth and that's what's happening
[2:06:16] now people are being swallowed up in the
[2:06:19] Earth
[2:06:20] fleshly desires Etc of the earth they're
[2:06:23] swallowed the Earth is swallowing them
[2:06:25] up
[2:06:29] the bride
[2:06:30] is going on with God
[2:06:32] she can't get enough of this message
[2:06:37] all right
[2:06:39] see there was a clash when the carnal
[2:06:41] and the spiritual meets there's always a
[2:06:43] clash when Judas and Jesus met there was
[2:06:46] a clash one the Son of God the other the
[2:06:49] son of Satan like Cain and Abel there
[2:06:51] was a Clash
[2:06:53] they Clash
[2:06:55] Cain and Abel both brothers both of them
[2:06:57] from the same the same mother
[2:07:01] they realize they're Immortal they had
[2:07:02] been put on Life In The Garden of Life
[2:07:05] they both were trying to find a way back
[2:07:06] in if you notice both boys were very
[2:07:08] religious
[2:07:09] Kane was as religious as able was they
[2:07:11] built altars otherwise a church they
[2:07:14] made sacrifice they both prayed and they
[2:07:16] served God both of them one of them
[2:07:18] served him wrong
[2:07:21] you see you can never be so sincere and
[2:07:23] yet be wrong
[2:07:25] you can ever be so sincere and yet be
[2:07:27] wrong you can you can be wrong there's a
[2:07:30] way that seemeth right but the end
[2:07:32] thereof is the ways of death
[2:07:38] amen
[2:07:40] I heard through that I apologize for
[2:07:43] doing that let's stand
[2:07:45] God bless you
[2:07:47] I'm sorry to take so long again I
[2:07:50] but you won't probably hear from me for
[2:07:52] a while now so
[2:07:55] I just
[2:07:58] believe God's delivered it I've only hit
[2:08:00] the high points or so many things that
[2:08:02] could be taken
[2:08:04] you go back
[2:08:05] and read it look it over
[2:08:07] I was going to end up with what the
[2:08:09] prophet ended up with about the seed
[2:08:12] about the wheat plant how that every bit
[2:08:16] of the carrier the Life coming up
[2:08:19] through it which is the bride the
[2:08:21] carriers those that Come Through the
[2:08:24] Ages

[2:08:27] some is burned some are saved parts are
[2:08:31] saved

[2:08:34] God bless you
[2:08:36] thank you for being patient with me I'm
[2:08:38] a long-winded preacher I can't be
[2:08:41] something I'm not
[2:08:42] [Music]

[2:08:52] judging me
[2:08:54] and I've got the answer for everything
[2:08:55] I've said

[2:09:00] stand there in judgment someday
[2:09:02] and I pray that you'll send with me
[2:09:06] I don't mean to be judged I'm talking
[2:09:08] about in judgment

[2:09:13] has been said in my I will give answer
[2:09:15] to everyone that I've spoken to through
[2:09:17] the years of my life
[2:09:19] and testified to
[2:09:21] I'll have to give an answer for that
[2:09:23] then
[2:09:25] that answer giving an answer doesn't
[2:09:27] mean I'm being judged it means I'm
[2:09:29] answering back
