[41:26] brother George's testimony just so

[41:32] the spiritual content not how he met
[41:34] sister Rebecca and you know how that she
[41:37] sat in the closet with the phone
[41:39] stretched out and those kind of things I
[41:42] want to hear what it was when God dealt
[41:44] with brother George you know if you know
[41:46] him very well you know a portion of his
[41:49] testimony born to missionary family
[41:52] and these kind of things and just want
[41:55] to I just want to have us experience and
[42:00] hear
[42:01] what it was for him
[42:03] uh coming in and the blessing that God
[42:06] has been and and uh not to make
[42:09] something too much out of it but
[42:12] um certainly God has blessed us with a
[42:14] lovely friendship with brother George
[42:15] and
[42:17] um uh he's a great encouragement to me
[42:21] um just uh all that he saw and God has
[42:25] kept him in balance and that is a
[42:27] beautiful thing on the backboard
[42:30] uh uh Brothers at Cloverdale bibleway
[42:34] sent a little letter and a flyer a
[42:38] couple Flyers concerning online
[42:41] schooling they just ask if we would post

[43:08] with us amen and uh always want to be
[43:13] appreciative of the um
[43:15] the the surrender of their gift to us to
[43:19] just uh help us Amen to worship and
[43:23] first Peter the second chapter verses
[43:26] one through ten it's actually very
[43:28] familiar scripture uh to us giving as it
[43:32] is directive to start out with and we're
[43:34] going to just draw a little thought uh
[43:37] tonight and part of my instinct says
[43:41] this will be short tonight and I know
[43:44] better than to declare that so
[43:46] um we just look here first Peter second
[43:50] chapter verses 1 through 10. wherefore
[43:53] laying aside all malice an old guy and
[43:57] hypocrisies and envious in all evil
[44:00] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[44:03] sincere milk of the word that you may
[44:05] grow thereby if so be have tasted that
[44:10] the Lord is gracious to whom coming as
[44:13] unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of
[44:16] men but chosen of God and precious
[44:21] ye also as Lively stones are built up a
[44:25] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[44:28] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[44:32] to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it
[44:36] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[44:38] in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect
[44:41] precious and he that believeth on him
[44:44] shall not be confounded unto you
[44:47] therefore which believe he is precious
[44:49] can we say Amen to that
[44:51] but unto them which be disobedient the
[44:55] stone which the builders disallowed the
[44:57] same is made the head of the corner Ace
[45:01] and a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[45:04] offense even to them which stumble at
[45:07] the word being disobedient wherein to
[45:09] also they were appointed but ye are a
[45:13] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[45:16] holy nation of peculiar people that you
[45:19] should show forth the Praises of him who
[45:22] hath called you out of Darkness Into His
[45:24] Marvelous Light which in time past were
[45:27] not a people but are now the people of
[45:30] God which had not obtained Mercy but now
[45:33] have obtained Mercy Heavenly Father we
[45:37] just ask you to bless Lord the reading
[45:39] of your word let it come to life with us
[45:42] tonight and Lord bless this time
[45:44] together those who could not be here
[45:46] tonight ask your father just to reach
[45:49] out May your presence touch each one we
[45:51] would ask this in your precious name
[45:53] amen you may be seated
[46:03] as we would look at these scriptures I
[46:06] always really appreciated this because
[46:10] it starts out laying out the fact that
[46:13] to accomplish what we want to accomplish
[46:15] or desire in our heart amen and we know
[46:18] that the desire that's in our heart is
[46:20] not our desire it's God's desire
[46:22] manifested in us and so we lay aside the
[46:26] malice the guile hypocrisies envies the
[46:29] speakings and we put all of that to the
[46:32] side and we approach the word as newborn
[46:36] babes and and when we approach that my
[46:39] brother and sister it is there we're
[46:41] coming with a hunger but that we desire
[46:44] to grow and you know as it is we have
[46:47] our young people our youth our children
[46:49] and we see them growing you know I just
[46:52] was going through some photos and how
[46:55] quickly the years pass and and those
[46:57] some here tonight amen that we're just
[47:00] little babes and now they're growing up
[47:04] into lovely young people and how quickly
[47:07] this passes and these desire them that
[47:10] God has placed in in uh Sons and
[47:13] Daughters of God to come to the word as
[47:16] a newborn babe with this desire that we
[47:19] could grow now we know even though the
[47:21] scripture here isn't dealing with it we
[47:24] know that the Babe must move on to solid
[47:27] food must move on to the meat to really
[47:30] grow we can't simply be fed
[47:34] um milk our whole life but it comes a
[47:36] time amen as the scripture says wherever
[47:39] the carcass is amen it doesn't say we're
[47:41] The Milk Jug is it doesn't say we're the
[47:45] easy things are but where the carcass is
[47:48] and the carcass my brother and sister as
[47:51] I have personally got to witness uh in
[47:53] in Africa you watch the vultures and
[47:57] they have to start first by tearing
[47:59] through the the skin to get to the the
[48:03] meat of the carcass and and they have to
[48:05] work at it and you'll see and oftentimes
[48:08] if a hang mean or something will come
[48:11] they'll just scatter without any contest
[48:14] at all one they cannot compete against
[48:16] them but two they're going to let the
[48:19] hyena or the Jackal tear through the
[48:22] hide to get to the meat and my brother
[48:25] and sister the problem with that of
[48:27] letting someone else do it for you if
[48:30] you could just bear with me using kind
[48:32] of these direct words is when someone
[48:34] else tears it open for you it's been
[48:37] contaminated by their idea amen that's
[48:40] why God called the Eagles amen the Bride
[48:43] of this day to come to the carcass and
[48:46] it's there that we as Eagles Approach it
[48:49] as an eagle would approach it not as a
[48:52] jackal or a buzzard or something else
[48:54] but we approach it from an ego point of
[48:57] view and my brother and sister we know
[48:59] that Eagles lack fresh meat amen so here
[49:02] God is giving us these words of
[49:05] encouragement and he's telling us here
[49:08] in verse 3 that uh if I could put it in
[49:12] my words tonight if you don't mind if
[49:15] it'd be that ye have tasted that the
[49:18] Lord is gracious and I would change that
[49:20] to say we have tasted and it is good
[49:25] amen God is gracious that we have an
[49:29] appetite for the open word we have an
[49:32] appetite for the open book amen and we
[49:35] can testify tonight by God's grace that
[49:38] he is gracious to us and we see also
[49:42] that while they did not recognize who
[49:45] Jesus Christ was in their presence amen
[49:48] and they put him to the side it did not
[49:51] change God's plan at all it did not uh
[49:54] disallow Jesus Christ for his uh calling
[49:58] and my brother and sister even today
[50:00] that men have taken this message they
[50:03] are doing their best some making a
[50:05] career out of uh making their their
[50:09] statements and digging up and they're
[50:11] innuendos and my brother and sister you
[50:13] can read things and we won't go into
[50:15] that but I want to make the point that
[50:18] you'll have these people I'm going to
[50:19] call them Talking Heads because really
[50:22] what they're looking for is YouTube hits
[50:24] because YouTube pays them to do this
[50:27] my I mean you see people talking about
[50:30] the most ridiculous things because
[50:33] advertisers flock to those with many
[50:35] hits and so you've got men that my
[50:38] brother and sister they're as much
[50:40] motive to tear the message down is to
[50:43] make income while they do it
[50:45] so they are getting a double dose of
[50:48] judgment there because it's there but it
[50:50] does not matter and I that's why I
[50:52] didn't want to focus on this but it does
[50:54] not matter how much negative attention
[50:58] that they project the bride of Christ is
[51:02] not a buzzard
[51:05] amen she's an Eagle
[51:07] amen so he's not going to feed on all
[51:10] this dead stuff of innuendo and of this
[51:13] and of that and they were associated
[51:15] with these people that went on to do
[51:16] this and do that and it's all very loose
[51:19] my brother and sister but what they're
[51:21] trying to do is just cast a shadow and
[51:24] amen my brother and sister the word says
[51:26] that yea though I walk through the
[51:28] valley of the shadow of death I'm going
[51:30] to interpret this for you tonight too
[51:32] I'm not going to worry about it because
[51:34] there wouldn't be a shadow if the light
[51:36] was not present amen so while the
[51:39] Shadows are all around and Satan's
[51:41] trying to make us look at the shadow
[51:44] amen it is not going to be our focus of
[51:48] the bride of Christ amen now I I kind of
[51:51] jumped ahead of myself here let me Reign
[51:54] myself in amen I titled this tonight
[51:58] chosen to go beyond
[52:00] amen and that's what we are tonight
[52:02] we're chosen to go beyond we're not
[52:05] chosen my brother and sister to just
[52:07] Coast we're chosen to actually be Trail
[52:10] Breakers uh uh to blaze a trail not with
[52:14] a new word not with a new life but us
[52:17] blazing our way through all the unbelief
[52:20] all the shadow all the struggle and God
[52:24] has given us a desire to continue to
[52:27] push through this to come to a
[52:29] completion of the plan of God Amen now
[52:33] we'll get along a little later here in
[52:35] and I'll sum it up really short and
[52:37] sweet by God's grace now we look at this
[52:40] as it's telling us that our Lord Jesus
[52:43] Christ being that stone which was
[52:45] disallowed
[52:47] that stone become a stumbling Stone
[52:50] my brother and sister when Jesus Christ
[52:53] was there you studied the history you
[52:55] you're there in Israel you see this face
[52:58] to face while the presence or Ministry
[53:01] of our Lord Jesus give Liberty to others
[53:04] it actually caused some to blaspheme it
[53:06] caused some to become murders and to
[53:09] become very vile in their behaviors and
[53:12] and this is the way it's always been the
[53:14] very word of God that has come in our
[53:17] hour has caused people to find Liberty
[53:20] and find out who they are and to be able
[53:23] to stand and say thank you Lord for this
[53:25] message that you have sent me and it's
[53:27] causing others to bring themselves into
[53:31] judgment amen and I'm not talking about
[53:33] judging yourself daily but I'm talking
[53:35] about judgment amen and so we'll find
[53:38] that The Stumbling stone is still
[53:40] present amen but to you and I it has
[53:44] become the head of the corner it is the
[53:47] all in all it's what peace is it all
[53:49] together it's what's holding it and
[53:52] everything being fitly joined by the
[53:54] word is giving you and I a confidence
[53:57] and I'm a little bit ahead of myself but
[53:59] I'm just going to go ahead and step out
[54:01] there this my brother and sister is not
[54:03] an accident that we believe
[54:06] amen we didn't just stumble upon
[54:08] something and we looked around and said
[54:10] well I guess this is just as good as
[54:12] anything else I'll believe this my
[54:15] brother and sister it goes so much
[54:16] deeper than that amen now the chosen
[54:21] isn't it you know I I focus quite a bit
[54:24] on that in the last while but my brother
[54:27] and sister the chosen or the called out
[54:32] let me put it like this
[54:34] you are the chosen or the called out of
[54:37] a generation to be the generation that
[54:40] carries the word to the coming of the
[54:41] Lord
[54:42] amen so it is as brother Branham
[54:45] describes it at calling a church out of
[54:47] the church amen God is calling you and I
[54:50] out of the generation that's going to
[54:52] see by the word the coming of the Lord
[54:55] and this is irrelevant my brother and
[54:57] sister if we grow old and gray and you
[55:00] bury us
[55:01] that's why I feel relevant of how that
[55:04] all fits God's timing is God's timing
[55:07] and I want to be in God's timing I don't
[55:09] want to be on my time because I'm
[55:11] actually an impatient guy
[55:14] I hate to admit that
[55:16] but it's the truth
[55:18] phone rings twice Jerry needs to answer
[55:23] oh don't tell me some of you don't have
[55:24] that problem
[55:26] yeah you call people and they should
[55:28] just already have a phone in their hand
[55:30] and maybe even holding it to their ear
[55:33] but you know it's a it's the age that we
[55:36] live in and it's the spirit of the age
[55:38] and everything needs to happen right now
[55:40] including God needs to answer my prayer
[55:43] right now amen so it is that we are the
[55:47] chosen of the generation that's going to
[55:51] carry the word to the coming of the Lord
[55:53] and God's going to teach us patience
[55:55] he's teaching me today I had a great
[55:57] dose of patience amen I wasn't happy to
[56:01] get that dose of patience I wanted
[56:03] everything to work differently today but
[56:06] I won't even go into that but look my
[56:08] brother and sister it's not going to be
[56:10] you and I that carry the word to the
[56:13] coming of the Lord but it's Christ in US
[56:16] amen aren't you glad otherwise the
[56:19] burden of the word
[56:21] now we don't often think about the word
[56:23] being a burden to us
[56:25] but remember we are human
[56:28] and humanity and laodicea
[56:31] there's pressure
[56:33] and so carrying the word is actually a
[56:36] burden because what it does as the words
[56:38] being revealed in you the pressure of
[56:42] laodicea is then being focused on you
[56:45] and brother Isaac didn't even realize
[56:47] really what he was saying but he was
[56:49] sharing with me a little something about
[56:51] the little personal submarine that went
[56:53] down deep and imploded here recently
[56:56] amen and he was talking about uh brother
[56:58] he's just sharing this in the back with
[57:00] me about how it is that as you go down
[57:03] deeper and deeper and the pressure
[57:04] builds up and he likened it and I was
[57:07] just sitting there I did give him a hint
[57:09] where we were at but my brother and
[57:11] sister the burden of carrying the word
[57:13] in this age is not an easy burden don't
[57:17] act like oh I just brushed this off I'm
[57:19] the bride no problem my brother and
[57:21] sister Satan has put a Target on you and
[57:24] he would like to implode you he don't
[57:27] need you to go and blow up he wants to
[57:30] implode you that people would then say
[57:33] well that's what it is when they serve
[57:35] as they serve they can't handle it well
[57:38] my brother and sister the truth is I
[57:40] cannot handle it but Christ in me Amen
[57:43] brother Isaac you summed the sermon
[57:45] right there because he gives the analogy
[57:48] of how God made these fish to be able to
[57:51] go swim all the way down there and why
[57:54] because I'm going to plagiarize your
[57:56] little mini sermon why my brother and
[57:58] sister they're not trying to hold their
[58:01] breath amen they become a part of the
[58:04] environment that they're in amen and if
[58:08] we as Sons and Daughters of God get in
[58:11] the environment of laodicea Amen then we
[58:15] don't fit there and we can't handle that
[58:17] but as we get in the environment of the
[58:20] Supernatural and we move into that as
[58:23] the pressure comes on Christ in US Rises
[58:27] up and pressurizes back against the
[58:30] things of laodicea the spirits of the
[58:32] age and we are here not of our own
[58:35] accord not of our own ability every time
[58:37] that we come into our own flesh man I
[58:41] can do this we fail
[58:44] amen it's just how it is I've I've been
[58:47] in this position before I can do this
[58:49] well our best thing is to say last time
[58:52] Lord I was in this position you bailed
[58:55] me out so I'm just coming into this
[58:57] position and Lord I'm already crying out
[59:00] Lord I need you
[59:01] amen because we were called to deal with
[59:04] the pressure
[59:05] amen
[59:07] now you look at this as Christ in you
[59:09] amen
[59:11] how can you compare Christ the Holy
[59:14] Spirit
[59:15] in you to the world
[59:20] there's really no way my brother and
[59:23] sister
[59:24] to to compare the two it's just simply
[59:27] not an equal thing and
[59:30] you look and this will sound a little
[59:32] judgmental if you'll forgive me
[59:35] but you'll find as Satan has worked his
[59:39] way into the religious world into the
[59:42] church world
[59:43] and over time you'll see the
[59:46] denominations just recently uh there was
[59:49] another uh it didn't really make the
[59:51] news but another uh uh old denomination
[59:54] is now splintering and there's just on
[59:57] the East Coast 57 churches that belonged
[1:00:01] into the Lutheran movement said we're no
[1:00:04] longer associate
[1:00:07] because the Lutheran Church as a
[1:00:09] denomination has went so far off we
[1:00:13] can't go there so what's happened now
[1:00:15] get this what would the what the prophet
[1:00:17] told us amen they will now become a
[1:00:20] denomination to themselves
[1:00:23] so they didn't get deliverance from a
[1:00:25] denominational Spirit they just will
[1:00:27] become a denomination to themselves now
[1:00:30] I want you to bring that closer to home
[1:00:32] that we see little isms and schisms
[1:00:35] coming around and well we don't agree
[1:00:37] here and we don't agree there well what
[1:00:39] we need to do is find the Altar and all
[1:00:41] pray together and come to the agreeance
[1:00:43] with God's word amen not with a group of
[1:00:46] men or women amen but to come in
[1:00:48] agreeance with the word of God but
[1:00:51] you'll see that then those things become
[1:00:53] another denomination and they will be
[1:00:55] and I'm sad to say it this way will be
[1:00:58] doomed to fail because they never went
[1:01:01] back and correct the original problem
[1:01:03] that caused it to be what it is now my
[1:01:06] brother and sister the moment they got
[1:01:08] away from the word amen that seed of
[1:01:10] denominationalism was planted and it
[1:01:14] come now to bear fruit and split it
[1:01:16] right down now I don't know if you're
[1:01:18] familiar with this I've been in houses
[1:01:19] before sister Jerry and I looked at a
[1:01:22] house right over in the to Nampa here
[1:01:24] that well I guess it's out that way that
[1:01:27] we were looking out to buy as property
[1:01:29] for a church kind of wished we had in a
[1:01:31] way amen several Acres an old house big
[1:01:34] concrete shop we could have done wonders
[1:01:37] with that amen wouldn't have been in the
[1:01:38] city too wouldn't that been awesome
[1:01:41] but my brother and sister there was a
[1:01:43] tree that was planted too close to close
[1:01:45] to house and The Roots had asked
[1:01:47] actually worked their way through the
[1:01:49] foundation and appeared inside the
[1:01:52] basement and they watered the lawn
[1:01:54] through a ditch and just flooded it and
[1:01:57] just get this now and when they flooded
[1:01:59] the yard
[1:02:01] the water filled up a foot or two deep
[1:02:03] in the basement so the tree never got
[1:02:06] thirsty
[1:02:08] but why wouldn't you the very thing
[1:02:11] that's trying to break the thing you
[1:02:14] value
[1:02:15] why would you not deal with it
[1:02:17] was the tree more important than the
[1:02:19] house
[1:02:21] but you see that's the spirit of
[1:02:22] denominationalism we we we're going to
[1:02:25] let our tree we plant to destroy our
[1:02:28] house but we can't do anything about the
[1:02:30] tree
[1:02:31] so you look and see now I hope that made
[1:02:34] sense to you that we cannot compare the
[1:02:37] holy spirit with the spirit that's in
[1:02:40] the world and all sometimes we'll look
[1:02:43] at this we've had conversations of nice
[1:02:45] people good people sincere people with
[1:02:48] good words and words of truth and how do
[1:02:51] we compare and how do we look that my
[1:02:53] brother and sister what we got to come
[1:02:55] back to does it line up with the word
[1:02:58] there that's the that's the very Crux
[1:03:00] the hard judgment as it would be is not
[1:03:03] as hard as we might think amen now as we
[1:03:07] look at this and compare the spirit
[1:03:09] that's upon the bride of Christ in this
[1:03:11] last day and the spirit that's upon the
[1:03:14] world we read or listen however you like
[1:03:17] to do that a brother Brown speaking
[1:03:19] about the astronaut age amen and I'm
[1:03:22] just going to paraphrase through this so
[1:03:24] we're quite quick amen but he's talking
[1:03:26] about how we progressed man walking from
[1:03:29] the horse to the buggy to the car to all
[1:03:32] of these things we come to the jet age
[1:03:34] and in the culmination even beyond the
[1:03:37] jet age is the astronaut age amen and so
[1:03:40] what we created now I think it's just
[1:03:43] awesome uh to be able to get on a jet
[1:03:46] airliner fly to Israel fly to South
[1:03:48] Africa fly to Asia wherever it might be
[1:03:51] and man's figured out how to pressurize
[1:03:54] this aluminum capsule and put you inside
[1:03:57] of of it and you're able to fly I think
[1:04:01] the highest I've ever seen on this
[1:04:03] screen that I've been in an airplane was
[1:04:05] 41 000 feet and that's just pretty high
[1:04:08] amen time enough for you to actually
[1:04:11] think you can fly your own self
[1:04:13] but you see when you're in that Capsule
[1:04:16] that's a temporary time and space
[1:04:21] and it comes to an end
[1:04:25] but the prophet of God said this bride
[1:04:29] this this placed in Christ
[1:04:32] pressurized against the spirits of the
[1:04:35] age is able to move through the
[1:04:38] atmosphere
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:43] a power able to move Beyond present
[1:04:46] atmosphere
[1:04:47] now if we are in the astronaut age my
[1:04:50] brother and sister should we not be able
[1:04:53] to power through the present atmosphere
[1:04:56] that we are in amen I'm not talking
[1:04:59] about being in the presence of God I'm
[1:05:01] talking about laodicea and we have to go
[1:05:03] to work we go to the grocery store we go
[1:05:06] whatever but we see my brother and
[1:05:08] sister that God said I'm not going to
[1:05:10] have you just sit here and wallow and
[1:05:13] struggle to get through this I'm going
[1:05:15] to put you as an astronaut and power you
[1:05:18] through this or power you beyond this
[1:05:21] atmosphere and that's why we as Sons and
[1:05:23] Daughters of God can exist in this
[1:05:26] present world and be Overcomers we do
[1:05:29] not have to say well I if I was here I
[1:05:33] could have I could have served God if I
[1:05:35] was here I could have served God if this
[1:05:38] had been different I could have served
[1:05:40] God
[1:05:41] no my brother and sister we've been
[1:05:42] anointed to power through that
[1:05:45] atmosphere and to say I was called to
[1:05:47] serve God and I will and by God's grace
[1:05:50] I am serving God Amen so as we'll look
[1:05:54] at this we'll see now of the power to
[1:05:57] Beyond this present atmosphere now look
[1:06:01] at this
[1:06:02] as you get higher the gravitational pull
[1:06:05] gets less
[1:06:08] the atmosphere is thinner
[1:06:11] I think you see where I'm going
[1:06:13] so it's when we're down here clucking
[1:06:16] with the chickens gravity has a
[1:06:19] tremendous impact on us the atmosphere
[1:06:22] there as as many bars of gravity as can
[1:06:26] be listed amen unless you're way on top
[1:06:29] of mountain clucking with chickens amen
[1:06:32] but that's still not going to get you
[1:06:33] away from the chickens but you look at
[1:06:36] this and so as we get higher in Christ
[1:06:38] amen as we are moving up the pull of
[1:06:42] this present World becomes less aren't
[1:06:45] you glad I say thank you Lord amen and
[1:06:48] so the gravitational pull of the
[1:06:51] laodicean spirit starts to fall away and
[1:06:55] that's why as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:57] we need to make the effort to climb up
[1:07:00] into Heavenly places not to be bound by
[1:07:04] all of laodicea and all of the struggle
[1:07:07] of laodicea Amen you know finding the
[1:07:10] right girl the right guy amen getting
[1:07:13] married starting a family buying a house
[1:07:16] all of these things are a great actual
[1:07:19] strain we Face them in increments so
[1:07:21] after a while we don't notice the
[1:07:24] pressure that's on us
[1:07:25] but the truth of it is I'm sorry to tell
[1:07:28] you young people
[1:07:29] you move beyond your youth
[1:07:33] and it's only
[1:07:35] at that stage do you start to realize
[1:07:39] what God has given you
[1:07:42] Godly moment down a home that you're
[1:07:45] secure in all of these things
[1:07:48] suddenly
[1:07:49] not having a job is not an option
[1:07:53] suddenly light bills in gasoline and
[1:07:56] cars and groceries and all of this thing
[1:07:59] starts to come in but that is really the
[1:08:02] least of the things that we become
[1:08:04] pressurized in this day and we start
[1:08:07] coming and working in in you know for
[1:08:10] businesses
[1:08:12] and they make decisions that come right
[1:08:16] down gravity pulls it right down to your
[1:08:18] level and you have to deal with the
[1:08:21] influence of their decision sometimes my
[1:08:24] brothers and sisters the decisions and
[1:08:27] the words and the conversation of others
[1:08:29] are more damaging to you as a Christian
[1:08:32] and then if somebody just called you
[1:08:34] names you know they just come and
[1:08:37] they're undermine and they're doing
[1:08:39] their best to erode but God says you
[1:08:41] know what I've called you beyond this
[1:08:43] I'm raising you umpire I've taken you
[1:08:45] through this and when you get up into
[1:08:47] Heavenly places you'll look at this and
[1:08:50] recognize that's just the devil and now
[1:08:52] you don't go to that person you know I I
[1:08:54] don't recommend you walk up to your boss
[1:08:56] and say that decision you made you're
[1:08:58] just a devil
[1:09:00] now that's probably not wisdom
[1:09:03] but you need to realize that it was the
[1:09:06] devil that anointed them to make a
[1:09:08] decision that impacted you in such a
[1:09:10] fashion now if we look at this in this
[1:09:13] point and say these people
[1:09:16] then you're missing the point
[1:09:18] it's Satan doing his very best to pull
[1:09:22] you back out of heavenly places and
[1:09:25] ground you in laodicea and hold you
[1:09:28] there
[1:09:29] amen and it affects our lives as such
[1:09:32] now as we look at this getting Beyond
[1:09:35] this gravitational pull of laodicea now
[1:09:38] you know we have many wonderful examples
[1:09:41] Amen brother Bud Southwick
[1:09:45] believed
[1:09:46] that's just a simple truth of it he
[1:09:48] believed
[1:09:51] but he still had a cigarette habit
[1:09:55] how can you be a believer in Smoke
[1:09:58] that's a filthy habit
[1:10:04] brother Brian I'm just going to go out
[1:10:06] and check the horses
[1:10:09] now brother bud
[1:10:11] this is how Satan Works he gets us down
[1:10:13] in gravity and influences they're honest
[1:10:15] brother Bud didn't go upwind of the tent
[1:10:23] no sir go out here
[1:10:26] got to have that little nicotine fix
[1:10:29] just lights that cigarette
[1:10:33] and a prophet of God speaks these words
[1:10:36] brother bud
[1:10:38] when did you quit smoking
[1:10:44] but you see what God was doing he was
[1:10:46] breaking Bud Southwick away from the
[1:10:49] gravitational pull of laodicea and God
[1:10:52] honored his very words when he made the
[1:10:55] statement just now
[1:10:58] and never smoked again
[1:11:01] you see God was pulling him that doesn't
[1:11:04] seem too Supernatural does it
[1:11:07] I mean
[1:11:09] there wasn't you know like
[1:11:11] lightning crossed the heavens there
[1:11:14] wasn't any Thunder That Shook everything
[1:11:17] there was an angel come down that
[1:11:19] anybody saw
[1:11:22] doesn't seem really spiritual
[1:11:24] doesn't seem Supernatural
[1:11:26] but I'm telling you tonight that was a
[1:11:28] supernatural event because as those
[1:11:31] words anointed in him come out of his
[1:11:34] mouth just now what he could have done
[1:11:37] is he could have said no brother Branham
[1:11:39] I still have this filthy habit I can't
[1:11:42] break it
[1:11:44] but something inside of him Broke Free
[1:11:47] from the gravity of laodicea and he said
[1:11:51] just now this Supernatural took place
[1:11:55] and I'm stepping into that now I want to
[1:11:58] bring this to you if you can step here
[1:12:00] with me how many times has God offered
[1:12:03] you and I the opportunity to speak and
[1:12:07] step into that and Satan's right there
[1:12:10] to pull us down and it says you know
[1:12:12] that if our heart condemns us not then
[1:12:14] we have confidence in God and Satan man
[1:12:17] he can bring those thoughts back quick
[1:12:19] and some would say amen he can bring him
[1:12:21] right in there some of you haven't
[1:12:23] thought about in a long time bring it
[1:12:25] right in there and it checks you
[1:12:29] and what God wants us to do is break
[1:12:31] that gravitational pull and say Lord
[1:12:33] you've delivered me Lord You've healed
[1:12:36] me I'm confessing it and I'm stepping
[1:12:39] into that right now
[1:12:41] people say but I have this problem for a
[1:12:43] long time I need to do this this and
[1:12:45] this my brother and sister what we need
[1:12:47] to do is take a moment like that and
[1:12:50] break the bonds of a spiritual gravity
[1:12:52] amen an antichrist gravity and come and
[1:12:56] break that and step up into the heavens
[1:12:59] because we're not land lovers we're
[1:13:01] astronauts
[1:13:03] Hallelujah
[1:13:05] so what do we do when we get beyond the
[1:13:07] spirit of laodicea and we're Sons and
[1:13:09] Daughters of God does it not get easier
[1:13:12] can someone agree with me or not am I on
[1:13:15] the wrong path when we break through
[1:13:17] that
[1:13:19] we suddenly realize you know what this
[1:13:21] is the devil
[1:13:22] anointing My Flesh my mind my spirit and
[1:13:26] when I can break that anointing and get
[1:13:29] under this anointing here amen I can
[1:13:32] rise up into Heavenly places and and I
[1:13:34] feel a liberty to pray I feel a
[1:13:36] confidence to pray amen what my brother
[1:13:39] and sister this scripture is so boldly
[1:13:41] declares to you and I that if we will
[1:13:44] pray and we don't pray amiss
[1:13:50] he'll give it to us
[1:13:53] amen Lord help us to cut all the little
[1:13:55] extra Frills out
[1:13:58] you know years ago Toyota tried to
[1:14:02] a marketing gimmick
[1:14:04] little Toyota pickups would show up on
[1:14:07] the car lot
[1:14:10] and um they had them all set up over
[1:14:12] here
[1:14:13] but you know you start well I just need
[1:14:16] a pickup to work in okay
[1:14:18] how come this one doesn't have a bumper
[1:14:20] it's extra
[1:14:22] oh okay
[1:14:24] how come everybody has a driver's side
[1:14:26] mirror
[1:14:27] passenger side's extra there's no radio
[1:14:31] extra
[1:14:33] no intermittent wipers extra
[1:14:38] what were they doing
[1:14:40] now some people would say I don't care
[1:14:43] I'm bumper ain't gonna stop anything
[1:14:45] anyway it's made out of tin foil
[1:14:48] and I don't need a radio
[1:14:50] and I don't care if I can't see them on
[1:14:52] that side why do I need to look a mirror
[1:14:54] and see it but what they were doing is
[1:14:56] they were leading the customer who come
[1:14:58] in and says I can afford 200 a month you
[1:15:01] can tell I'm from another generation
[1:15:05] 200 a month that's all I can afford
[1:15:08] well I would like a bumper on it
[1:15:12] and I would like mirror and I would like
[1:15:13] a radio
[1:15:15] and they have signed the papers and
[1:15:17] walked out with a 350 a month payment
[1:15:20] why because they were LED
[1:15:23] the whole plan they started sending a
[1:15:25] car salesmen to academies to teach them
[1:15:28] how to lead people into debt
[1:15:32] and Satan was the one who anointed those
[1:15:35] programs and how that he works and he
[1:15:38] comes and as the prophet of God said my
[1:15:40] brother and sister and this is no
[1:15:42] direction to no people but he said here
[1:15:44] we are looking at the coming of the Lord
[1:15:46] just read this the other day we're
[1:15:47] looking at the coming of the Lord and
[1:15:49] we're building multi-million dollar
[1:15:50] churches as though we're going to be
[1:15:52] here forever
[1:15:54] see how this all kind of comes along now
[1:15:56] I don't point that in anybody's
[1:15:58] Direction don't misunderstand but you
[1:16:00] see that is what Satan's doing while
[1:16:02] he's binding the church down
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:07] we're trying to be free
[1:16:08] but we're binding ourselves
[1:16:11] and so God is coming to unbind us if the
[1:16:15] church has a payment well I don't mean
[1:16:17] the people inside are going to be
[1:16:18] spiritually bound
[1:16:19] but there are certain obligations that
[1:16:21] must be met
[1:16:22] amen if that makes sense to you and I
[1:16:24] say thank you Lord for giving us a
[1:16:27] church very economical
[1:16:29] amen so when we get taken beyond the the
[1:16:33] atmosphere of laodicea
[1:16:35] I I want to ask you what is beyond
[1:16:40] we preach about this of how we get
[1:16:42] Beyond this we move Beyond this but what
[1:16:45] is beyond
[1:16:46] I think sometimes we need to come and
[1:16:49] quantify some of these little things
[1:16:50] that we preach about to to actually
[1:16:53] teach would be as it were our young
[1:16:56] people or whoever just what is beyond
[1:16:59] like we say get the Holy Ghost but my
[1:17:01] brother and sister a young person has an
[1:17:03] experience with God and God deals with
[1:17:05] them and they feel like they've changed
[1:17:07] but what happens in the very first time
[1:17:10] that they come to what you might say a a
[1:17:13] a a a pretty severe mistake or they come
[1:17:16] to a real challenge what does Satan do
[1:17:20] you got the Holy Ghost for sure I'm here
[1:17:22] to encourage you you got to look no what
[1:17:24] does he do
[1:17:26] you never had it
[1:17:27] you just had an emotion you just had
[1:17:29] something
[1:17:30] so what is beyond
[1:17:32] is the Holy Ghost an emotion I stand
[1:17:35] here to tell you tonight the Holy Ghost
[1:17:37] is an emotion amen if you've got the
[1:17:39] Holy Ghost there's some emotion in there
[1:17:41] somewhere but it's not now this sounds
[1:17:44] like I'm talking out of both sides of my
[1:17:46] mouth but it is not an emotion
[1:17:49] you feel literal the spirit of God
[1:17:53] anointing you
[1:17:55] it's an emotion there's something there
[1:17:58] that you're just so happy it's
[1:17:59] life-changing but if Satan has come and
[1:18:03] brother Branham says that Satan can
[1:18:05] impersonate every gift that there is in
[1:18:09] the church
[1:18:11] so if Satan can come and anoint this and
[1:18:14] impersonate this gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:17] then people have the Holy Ghost but they
[1:18:20] go on not much has changed in their life
[1:18:22] but they're convinced I got the Holy
[1:18:24] Ghost I felt the emotion
[1:18:28] this is why the prophet of God said the
[1:18:30] word must be attached to every single
[1:18:32] thing that we do it whether we're
[1:18:34] talking baptism must be attached to the
[1:18:36] word we're talking about the gift of the
[1:18:38] Holy Ghost must be attached to the word
[1:18:39] if we're talking about the gifts in the
[1:18:42] body speaking in tongues etc etc they
[1:18:44] must be attached to the word everything
[1:18:46] comes back and attaches to the word and
[1:18:48] my brother and sister we were chosen to
[1:18:51] be the manifestation of the evidence
[1:18:54] that God is in the midst of the church
[1:18:56] amen you say boy brother Paul uh we we
[1:19:00] just come across as one critic of the
[1:19:02] message said those message people are so
[1:19:04] arrogant my brother and sister I'm not
[1:19:07] arrogant if I had five dollars in my
[1:19:09] pocket and I tell you I have five
[1:19:10] dollars amen that's not arrogant I'm
[1:19:13] giving you facts
[1:19:15] and let's raise that up to where it
[1:19:17] might make a difference uh 5 000 in my
[1:19:20] pocket
[1:19:21] if I have 5 000 in my pocket that's not
[1:19:24] necessarily arrogance but if I'm
[1:19:26] boasting that I have it and you don't
[1:19:27] that's arrogance and we are sitting here
[1:19:31] today my brother and sister not as
[1:19:33] boasters but as the very literal
[1:19:36] manifestation of these scriptures in
[1:19:39] Peter that is declaring that you are the
[1:19:43] one amen this stone is a stumbling block
[1:19:46] to them but to you it is not what does
[1:19:50] that mean there's someone who comes to
[1:19:52] that stone and recognizes what that
[1:19:55] stone is Amen to them they wanted to
[1:19:58] push it out of the way they wanted to
[1:20:00] ignore it but to The Chosen they come
[1:20:03] and said this is nothing less than our
[1:20:06] Lord Jesus Christ coming to me amen it's
[1:20:09] life-changing amen so what is beyond for
[1:20:13] us well I tell you what my brother and
[1:20:15] sister there is a realm Beyond this
[1:20:19] right here
[1:20:20] it's called the supernatural
[1:20:23] and the world is exploring and
[1:20:26] constantly looking of what is this
[1:20:29] Supernatural what the events that are
[1:20:31] taking place uh you know they're trying
[1:20:34] to figure out what what is this element
[1:20:37] that's out here that we know is there
[1:20:41] now are you guys into UFOs
[1:20:46] UFOs are quite interesting
[1:20:48] when you have an airline pilot
[1:20:51] flying over the Pacific Ocean 38 000
[1:20:54] feet
[1:20:55] 565 miles an hour and something flies up
[1:20:58] by the window in their cockpit
[1:21:01] they can't see anybody's face they're
[1:21:03] not looking in there some guy with
[1:21:04] pointy ears
[1:21:06] but it flies up beside them
[1:21:09] and it goes up
[1:21:11] and disappears
[1:21:13] but what it did is it went up and it
[1:21:14] circled the planings right back to that
[1:21:16] same spot again
[1:21:17] and all of these movements that were
[1:21:20] there until finally it just
[1:21:22] is a flash of light and it's gone
[1:21:24] and you have sane people
[1:21:27] saying
[1:21:28] we saw this
[1:21:30] you have all the people in the cockpit
[1:21:32] of an airliner saying we saw the same
[1:21:34] thing
[1:21:37] well you know that wasn't crafted in
[1:21:39] Hollywood
[1:21:43] now this might seem silly example but
[1:21:46] this is how man crafts things you have
[1:21:48] Spider-Man crawling up the side of a
[1:21:52] 10-story building
[1:21:53] he's really
[1:21:55] crawling on the floor
[1:21:57] of something that's 40 feet long
[1:22:00] duplicated again and again and again
[1:22:02] digitally
[1:22:06] well what is that
[1:22:10] I hope you are with me
[1:22:12] that is a carefully devised fable
[1:22:18] because what is being presented to the
[1:22:20] people is not anywhere close to reality
[1:22:23] of what it is
[1:22:25] so God has come and he's moving in the
[1:22:27] midst of a bride in this day he's not
[1:22:30] offered her some carefully devised Fable
[1:22:32] he's not offered her something that can
[1:22:35] be just duplicated it can be
[1:22:37] impersonated my brother and sister but
[1:22:39] not duplicated
[1:22:41] amen so we look Beyond this amen so
[1:22:44] we're looking the realm of the
[1:22:45] supernatural deep things don't you love
[1:22:48] deep things I love deep things I'll tell
[1:22:51] you how much I like deep things I like
[1:22:53] deep things like a mom being able to
[1:22:55] enter behind the veil for her family
[1:22:58] into the very presence of almighty God
[1:23:00] and intercede for the needs of her
[1:23:03] children or her husband and be able to
[1:23:06] do I like those kind of deep things amen
[1:23:09] you don't need to know my brother and
[1:23:11] sister how it was God's thought was when
[1:23:14] he created the Milky Way it doesn't
[1:23:16] matter the Milky Way exists and God's
[1:23:18] thoughts are God's thoughts but I like
[1:23:20] the Deep things amen that causes young
[1:23:23] people teenagers and young people in the
[1:23:26] day that we live in when everything
[1:23:28] right down to the most pitiful of
[1:23:30] thoughts is projecting in our children
[1:23:33] and the Deep things of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:35] sealing them in this wicked day and
[1:23:38] holding them and carrying through them
[1:23:41] this world and people say your family
[1:23:44] there's something about them I'll tell
[1:23:46] you what that is it's the presence of
[1:23:49] almighty God the Holy Ghost surrounded
[1:23:52] around those children and walking with
[1:23:54] them and a mother and a father and a
[1:23:57] church body saying Lord be with our
[1:23:59] children and keep them in this wicked
[1:24:01] day I like those deep things I like
[1:24:05] those things that are life-changing we
[1:24:07] don't need to have a doctrine that when
[1:24:09] Church gets out and nobody can explain
[1:24:11] it we don't need doctrines that when we
[1:24:13] get home we look at each other and say
[1:24:15] did you understand what the preacher
[1:24:17] said I didn't understand a word
[1:24:20] that's not deep my brother and sister
[1:24:22] are deep is what anoints Sons and
[1:24:25] Daughters of God to do like our brother
[1:24:28] Bud Southwick and when we have an issue

[1:24:37] circumstance into the promise of the
[1:24:39] word and believing it

[1:25:03] brother and sister are that's
[1:25:04] Supernatural amen that's the power of
[1:25:07] God that's right here in this day that
[1:25:09] we're living when all of hell is focused
[1:25:13] to destroy our young people because he
[1:25:15] wants another kind of training
[1:25:17] and he'll start in slow and patient
[1:25:20] he'll go slow and patient my brother and
[1:25:23] sister
[1:25:24] amen I like deep things
[1:25:28] like a church that's seeking out more of
[1:25:32] Christ I like that kind of Deep thing
[1:25:34] not religion not just us coming and we
[1:25:38] come so our presence we go home we're
[1:25:40] here we're there we show up at birthday
[1:25:43] parties and this kind of party in a
[1:25:45] fellowship my brother and sister I say
[1:25:47] the Deep thing is when a body of
[1:25:50] Believers can be anointed to desire more
[1:25:53] of Christ amen and want to hold on to a
[1:25:56] standard not letting that standard the
[1:25:58] song Amen give me the word let that be a
[1:26:01] mantra that is not just words but let it
[1:26:04] be something deep in her heart that we
[1:26:06] say just give me the word I might sound
[1:26:09] old-fashioned I might not sound too
[1:26:11] exciting but I tell you what just give
[1:26:15] me the word
[1:26:16] because this word is what will take us
[1:26:18] right out of laodicea and I'm telling
[1:26:22] you my brother and sister you'll break
[1:26:23] every bond that Satan amen has tried to
[1:26:27] put on you you'll break every law of
[1:26:30] nature you'll break everything when God
[1:26:32] calls you home amen there'll be nothing
[1:26:34] stop you
[1:26:36] amen verse 5 going back ye also
[1:26:40] has some old dead letter Stones laying
[1:26:43] in the bottom of the creek
[1:26:46] no sir that's Lively stones are built up
[1:26:50] a spiritual house
[1:26:52] no one ever built a house without
[1:26:54] exerting effort
[1:26:57] amen
[1:26:58] we're Lively stones
[1:27:00] we're built up my brother and sister
[1:27:02] we're a holy priesthood and why to offer
[1:27:05] up a spiritual sacrifice that is
[1:27:07] acceptable
[1:27:08] amen we're not looking for religion and
[1:27:11] we're not asked asking our headquarters
[1:27:15] if we sing this song like this is that
[1:27:18] okay
[1:27:18] if we clap is that okay
[1:27:21] if we sing loud is that okay
[1:27:24] if we have
[1:27:25] three violins
[1:27:28] in church is that okay
[1:27:30] four or five or six would be
[1:27:39] we're in an age of the building up
[1:27:42] if you study the message of the hour
[1:27:45] with an open mind a clear heart
[1:27:49] you'll find nothing in there they said
[1:27:51] brother Brown was a woman hater
[1:27:55] but if you look through the message with
[1:27:57] an open mind and a clear heart
[1:27:59] you'll see the foundation has been laid
[1:28:03] and the spiritual house
[1:28:06] is being built that's right now I'm
[1:28:09] going to plagiarize this off of a
[1:28:11] minister in the message
[1:28:13] that was a live service tonight that I
[1:28:16] just have to be listening to when I
[1:28:18] finished up my notes
[1:28:20] brother Donnie says this
[1:28:23] when you look back through time you will
[1:28:26] see
[1:28:27] Oral Roberts left a university
[1:28:31] Billy Graham left libraries and schools
[1:28:34] and different things and he names off
[1:28:36] several ministers
[1:28:38] of what they left a legacy
[1:28:43] and he says but we look around
[1:28:47] do you see any buildings no William
[1:28:49] Branham
[1:28:51] theological Library
[1:28:55] do you do you see much of anything that
[1:28:58] he did
[1:29:00] you know brother Brian didn't want his
[1:29:01] name on The Tabernacle
[1:29:03] that was man doing that
[1:29:06] brother Brown didn't want his name on
[1:29:07] there
[1:29:11] I liked how brother Donnie put it
[1:29:13] he said these guys leave libraries and
[1:29:16] this and that and endowment funds and
[1:29:18] all this stuff what did what did Brother
[1:29:21] Brown leave us
[1:29:23] the word
[1:29:26] what a legacy my brother and sister
[1:29:29] not a building
[1:29:31] some of our kids you know if we we were
[1:29:35] in their denomination would maybe never
[1:29:37] have the funds to go to Oral Roberts
[1:29:39] University
[1:29:40] never have the funds to go over and go
[1:29:43] here or go there of these great things
[1:29:46] but one of the things about it rich and
[1:29:48] poor Every Nation every Kindred every
[1:29:51] tongue been left the word oh thank you
[1:29:56] Lord amen how precious God is amen he
[1:30:00] give us the word and that word is more
[1:30:02] than enough for us
[1:30:04] Hallelujah
[1:30:05] so brother Branham tells us that that
[1:30:08] Satan can impersonate all the signs and
[1:30:11] so because he could not take as it were
[1:30:15] the veil in the temple now you have to
[1:30:18] look at this through spiritual eyes
[1:30:19] because anyone could take the cloth and
[1:30:21] reproduce that Veil but he could not uh
[1:30:25] impersonate or reproduce the veil in the
[1:30:28] temple amen because it wasn't the cloth
[1:30:32] my brother and sister it was the
[1:30:34] blessing or anointing upon the veil are
[1:30:37] you with me otherwise why would you
[1:30:39] build a tabernacle out about your skins
[1:30:41] other than
[1:30:43] he was tearing our height off and
[1:30:45] hanging it on the walls of the
[1:30:47] Tabernacle because we're by and large a
[1:30:49] bunch of badgers leave us alone and
[1:30:51] we'll only growl at you
[1:30:53] Pocus and with scratch and bite
[1:30:56] amen
[1:30:58] so you look at this
[1:31:01] he couldn't do that so what did he do he
[1:31:04] his Recreation was a veil of
[1:31:06] intellectualism
[1:31:08] so there's no Veil for them to go behind
[1:31:11] now as it were into the holiest of
[1:31:13] holies because now they have an
[1:31:15] intellectual understanding of what's
[1:31:17] behind there so they come in there they
[1:31:19] talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:21] they talk about the gifts they talk
[1:31:22] about all these things but they're
[1:31:24] talking from an intellectual point of
[1:31:26] view it is not Revelation it's not real
[1:31:29] it's not alive amen there is not a god
[1:31:33] behind their Veil
[1:31:35] amen well there is he's just the God of
[1:31:37] this evil age amen so it is he cannot
[1:31:41] reason he did not go there is he cannot
[1:31:45] and I'm going to jump over this so I
[1:31:47] hope you catch and look over my
[1:31:48] naughtiness amen but it's their see he
[1:31:52] could not operate behind the veil in the
[1:31:55] presence of God
[1:31:56] I want you to think about Satan of all
[1:31:58] the things he do he said I'm going to
[1:32:00] rise up above
[1:32:04] he's still attempting
[1:32:06] but what he couldn't do
[1:32:08] was go behind the veil
[1:32:11] in the presence of God and operate there
[1:32:15] see he come to Jesus right when Jesus
[1:32:18] comes from the Wilderness he come to him
[1:32:21] Jesus did what we should be doing
[1:32:24] instead of trying to explain it all just
[1:32:27] take it back to the word
[1:32:28] and he didn't give him 42 scriptures
[1:32:31] there's a whole list my brother and
[1:32:33] sister somebody has studied it out a
[1:32:35] whole list of the scriptures Jesus could
[1:32:36] have gave
[1:32:38] but he gave two
[1:32:41] and they were effective
[1:32:43] so Satan couldn't operate behind the
[1:32:45] veil
[1:32:46] amen so in an age of the building up of
[1:32:49] the spiritual house now I'm talking
[1:32:51] about for the bride of Christ right took
[1:32:53] us from
[1:32:54] denominationalism legalism all these
[1:32:57] things building up the house and the age
[1:32:59] of that Satan is doing his best just to
[1:33:01] redefine the house
[1:33:03] if you can't build the house you
[1:33:05] redefine the house
[1:33:06] you you change what the image that
[1:33:09] people have and so you know it simply
[1:33:12] has come back to and I'll keep it simple
[1:33:14] here uh bigger is better
[1:33:16] and not Satan's whole program bigger is
[1:33:19] better so it doesn't matter the content
[1:33:21] right amen just like the old phrase
[1:33:24] would you rather have ten thousand
[1:33:26] counterfeit dollars or one real one
[1:33:33] but you see what the book is open
[1:33:36] Can someone say thank you Lord
[1:33:38] the book is open now any of you that
[1:33:41] have ever framed houses
[1:33:43] amen cookie cutter houses you don't even
[1:33:45] need a blueprint
[1:33:46] I mean they they are just you could
[1:33:48] actually you can actually just look at
[1:33:50] them and they can just tell you the info
[1:33:51] and you can go Frame It Up
[1:33:53] but a real house
[1:33:55] you need a blueprint and the book is
[1:33:57] open
[1:33:58] amen the blueprint is before us the
[1:34:00] blueprint has been revealed and we don't
[1:34:03] need to go ask Satan how he wants our
[1:34:05] house to be built we know what we're
[1:34:09] supposed to be building up amen and so
[1:34:11] it's there as we do this now this seems
[1:34:14] a strange thing and I hope you can
[1:34:15] follow me because these thoughts are all
[1:34:17] trimmed up here but look at Thomas
[1:34:19] remember Thomas anybody ever meet Thomas
[1:34:24] we'll all say you have because you've
[1:34:26] met me
[1:34:28] I'm a Thomas
[1:34:30] now some people would say whoa whoa whoa
[1:34:32] whoa you're really cutting down on
[1:34:33] yourself but I'm here to tell you
[1:34:35] tonight I believe I could be wrong every
[1:34:38] one of us needed a vindication
[1:34:42] we as humans needed some evidence
[1:34:46] that this is real
[1:34:49] and so every one of us in reality is a
[1:34:52] Thomas
[1:34:53] amen so you know when I first come
[1:34:55] across this kind of studying and looking
[1:34:57] at that and I started looking at Thomas
[1:35:00] In a Different Light because I was
[1:35:01] Thomas or Thomas was me or however that
[1:35:04] was as a young man coming up and looking
[1:35:07] at all of this I had my season and I
[1:35:10] want to focus on this but I had my
[1:35:11] season that I questioned whether this
[1:35:13] was truth or not
[1:35:17] sister Jerry would know and I won't bore
[1:35:19] you with all the details but God can be
[1:35:21] really gracious to you
[1:35:23] when you're working and God speaks to
[1:35:26] you not an audible voice God speaks to
[1:35:28] you and says tomorrow at church this and
[1:35:31] this will happen
[1:35:33] and you go to church the next day and
[1:35:35] you're like was that just my brain
[1:35:37] playing tricks with me
[1:35:40] and then
[1:35:42] nothing that Paul did
[1:35:44] I'm Mr oblivious
[1:35:46] but everything the Lord spoke to me
[1:35:52] you start to think
[1:35:56] that was incredible
[1:35:59] but it happened again
[1:36:02] and again
[1:36:03] and again
[1:36:06] what was he doing
[1:36:08] go ahead Thomas
[1:36:10] go ahead
[1:36:13] find out for yourself Thomas
[1:36:17] confirm it yourself don't take it as a
[1:36:20] carefully devised fable
[1:36:24] it's right here Thomas everybody's like
[1:36:27] I'm doubting Thomas
[1:36:29] You Don't See Jesus tear him up over
[1:36:32] that
[1:36:33] I mean why didn't Jesus say Thomas thou
[1:36:36] of little faith and whatever just depart
[1:36:39] and tell you you know
[1:36:40] no no
[1:36:42] because Thomas was a different kind of
[1:36:45] believer
[1:36:47] and I'm glad God had Grace for him
[1:36:49] because I'm That Kind of believer I
[1:36:51] needed the Lord to show me this was real
[1:36:55] are you with me
[1:36:57] I don't want anyone to be confused
[1:37:00] so he
[1:37:02] could be called doubter but he wanted a
[1:37:03] Vindication amen and I think there's
[1:37:06] probably a lot more Thomases around than
[1:37:08] we like to admit amen amen so he didn't
[1:37:11] he didn't want to carefully devise Fable
[1:37:13] he wanted fact
[1:37:15] and uh I tell you what I don't want to
[1:37:17] carefully devise fable
[1:37:19] I'm telling you I know this seems like a
[1:37:22] strange thing to say uh but if uh if I
[1:37:25] found out this was a fable all you would
[1:37:27] see is dust I'd be gone
[1:37:29] but I tell you my brother and sister
[1:37:30] it's just the way I am who I am I study
[1:37:33] I study all kinds of weird things and I
[1:37:35] look at all kinds of different things
[1:37:37] because I'm looking at them from a
[1:37:39] certain angle and my brother and sister
[1:37:41] you're watching everything that even
[1:37:43] resembled holiness
[1:37:45] collapsing
[1:37:47] falling apart coming apart at the seams
[1:37:50] whether it's at the bottom working its
[1:37:52] way up through the hierarchy or it's at
[1:37:53] the top working its way down or in the
[1:37:56] middle working its way out you'll find
[1:37:58] that it's coming apart
[1:38:01] prophecy
[1:38:03] fulfill
[1:38:05] amen
[1:38:07] but if you don't tell the story my dad
[1:38:09] is a young boy my dad I lied to him got
[1:38:12] my eye just whooped off of me
[1:38:14] I mean our practice had to go looking
[1:38:16] around for a spare hide somewhere to put
[1:38:18] on because he whooped it right off of me
[1:38:20] my dad drilled it into me he says son if
[1:38:23] you tell the truth
[1:38:24] you never have to remember the story
[1:38:28] hmm
[1:38:30] I learned that one
[1:38:33] people say
[1:38:34] you know it's maybe not the best way to
[1:38:37] deal with your children
[1:38:39] but I tell you what whenever you can
[1:38:41] drive A Life Lesson down in about 10
[1:38:43] minutes
[1:38:46] it's probably not a bad lesson
[1:38:48] yeah a lesson that you stop the rest of
[1:38:51] your life when the devil would tempt you
[1:38:53] and you'd be like nope not going there
[1:38:56] you still feel that all the way
[1:38:59] connected from the posterior to the
[1:39:01] depths of the core of your brain you
[1:39:03] feel that and you're like tell the truth
[1:39:06] even if it makes you look foolish
[1:39:11] oh my
[1:39:15] God proved himself didn't he
[1:39:17] I don't think we'd be here tonight
[1:39:19] if he hadn't proved himself
[1:39:21] amen we have the vindication
[1:39:25] that we needed to believe amen now I'm
[1:39:28] going to jump back to this other deal
[1:39:30] before we move on and close
[1:39:32] other people
[1:39:33] they've got their story
[1:39:37] didn't they miss the vindication
[1:39:41] Maybe
[1:39:43] they never looked for it
[1:39:45] in the beginning
[1:39:48] they liked the story
[1:39:52] God sent a prophet
[1:39:54] novel
[1:39:56] something new let's let's be part of
[1:39:58] this
[1:40:02] but
[1:40:05] when God started tearing the height off
[1:40:07] of them
[1:40:09] they said
[1:40:11] correction Begins the house of God
[1:40:15] but not in my church
[1:40:20] my church God is a loving gracious
[1:40:22] grandfather
[1:40:24] he loves everybody
[1:40:28] John 3 16 is one of their favorite
[1:40:30] scriptures for a reason
[1:40:36] but they're not going to stand up and
[1:40:38] say Lord
[1:40:39] if I'm wrong correct me
[1:40:42] because they believe they have the
[1:40:43] answer
[1:40:45] the Fable if I could be this bold the
[1:40:47] fable
[1:40:48] fits their life
[1:40:51] so there's no contradiction
[1:40:54] and without contradiction
[1:40:56] we never pursue truth
[1:41:02] when you come to contradiction
[1:41:04] my life doesn't match the word
[1:41:08] some people say well the word doesn't
[1:41:10] match my life I can't accept that but
[1:41:12] they got that backwards our life has to
[1:41:15] match the word and when we come in
[1:41:16] contradiction and my life doesn't match
[1:41:18] the word there's something in me says
[1:41:20] you're wrong Paul go said it right
[1:41:23] amen so God moving that way okay let's
[1:41:26] go to the unveiling of God here brother
[1:41:28] Gideon amen
[1:41:31] notice
[1:41:33] we then we become part of him
[1:41:36] as and I didn't elaborate on the veil as
[1:41:39] much as I intended forgive me so if it
[1:41:41] seems like there's a little dysfunction
[1:41:43] there
[1:41:44] we become part of him as you are the
[1:41:47] veil that veils him
[1:41:50] isn't that incredible my brother and
[1:41:52] sister the veil that was in the temple
[1:41:54] was rent but God says no problem I've
[1:41:57] got another Veil that I'm going to bring
[1:41:59] on the earth to hide the glory of God
[1:42:01] and you are going to be the veil that
[1:42:04] veils Christ amen and I just read that
[1:42:08] and my heart leaps because God didn't
[1:42:10] need to go back and build another
[1:42:11] Tabernacle out of badger skins and all
[1:42:14] of these fine Linens and all of these
[1:42:16] things he come and he said I've got some
[1:42:19] people then I'll just use them to be the
[1:42:21] veil now amen and so you are a part of
[1:42:26] him as long as Christ is in you as
[1:42:28] Christ was of God because God was in him
[1:42:31] made him God and as Christ is in you the
[1:42:35] hope of glory you become part of Christ
[1:42:38] amen he that believeth on me in the
[1:42:41] works that I do shall he also amen see
[1:42:45] you become part of the Christ as long as
[1:42:48] Christ is hid in you then it's veiled to
[1:42:51] the unbeliever but you know he is in you
[1:42:55] amen now people say how do you know that
[1:42:59] you've got the Holy Ghost well if I
[1:43:01] could just type it to you this kind of
[1:43:03] way tonight sorry it might come across a
[1:43:06] little foolish but if you remember the
[1:43:08] day that Christ come and stepped inside
[1:43:12] of you there is no way he stepped inside
[1:43:15] of you without you knowing he'd done
[1:43:19] that
[1:43:20] No More Than Anything Could Be oh I'm at
[1:43:24] loss for words there's just no way that
[1:43:26] that can take place and you not know it
[1:43:31] not an emotion
[1:43:33] but it'll bring emotion
[1:43:35] not intellectual but you'll be able to
[1:43:38] look at the word and realize what
[1:43:40] happened amen God's stepping into the
[1:43:43] people and as long as Christ is hid in
[1:43:47] you and then it's veiled to the
[1:43:48] unbeliever right as they come well
[1:43:51] brother Brown I don't believe this I
[1:43:52] love that brother Brown says okay I'm
[1:43:54] not going to argue with you it's not for
[1:43:57] unbelievers amen so as long as you're
[1:44:00] not the unbeliever but you know he's in
[1:44:03] you you are
[1:44:06] do you like that I love brother
[1:44:07] branham's English
[1:44:09] I I I we might have even went to the
[1:44:11] same school
[1:44:14] you are
[1:44:16] templing
[1:44:19] Christ
[1:44:23] what's a good substitute word for that
[1:44:28] we know what he meant
[1:44:31] I don't think we need another word
[1:44:34] we are templing
[1:44:36] in other words God said here let me show
[1:44:38] you the Tabernacle
[1:44:41] and what he would do is show us the
[1:44:44] bride
[1:44:45] and there she would be and he would say
[1:44:46] this is my Tabernacle this is the
[1:44:51] blueprint that I gave them to build a
[1:44:55] tabernacle for me in this day amen we're
[1:44:59] not going back to a tabernacle built in
[1:45:01] the wilderness we're God going back to a
[1:45:04] tabernacle built in Jerusalem amen we
[1:45:07] are the Tabernacle that God said here's
[1:45:10] the blueprint of what we're gonna build
[1:45:12] in this day oh Hallelujah I want to be a
[1:45:17] templing amen of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:20] hallelujah amen it's veiled to the
[1:45:24] unbeliever but you know he's in you you
[1:45:26] are templing Christ behind the veil the
[1:45:30] skin
[1:45:31] that makes it real personal
[1:45:34] Jesus on the inside working on the
[1:45:38] outside
[1:45:40] oh what a change in my life
[1:45:44] Hallelujah he's there
[1:45:49] but you know if we just go ahead and
[1:45:51] take these commas
[1:45:55] you've still got to deal with the skin
[1:45:59] he's behind it
[1:46:03] but what you all see is me
[1:46:06] and what I see is you
[1:46:12] and you don't like what you see and I
[1:46:15] don't like what I see
[1:46:19] if they would only this why did they do
[1:46:21] that they shouldn't have said that they
[1:46:23] should have done this
[1:46:25] what is it skin
[1:46:28] but let's not forget a prophet's words
[1:46:30] that said he is inside
[1:46:35] this Temple inside this skin
[1:46:40] oh thank you Lord hallelujah I look in a
[1:46:43] mirror and all I see is a man that makes
[1:46:45] so many mistakes when the prophet of God
[1:46:46] said you backslide daily I have to shout
[1:46:49] amen
[1:46:52] but then I remember
[1:46:55] he's in me
[1:47:00] then we
[1:47:02] because
[1:47:03] if you want to be one of those that
[1:47:04] thinks you have to have every part of
[1:47:06] every hesitation
[1:47:08] behind because of this Veil this Veil
[1:47:12] again in human flesh hides God the word
[1:47:15] from the unbeliever now I want to just
[1:47:18] we're actually I am closing
[1:47:21] do you know that
[1:47:23] if you'll just catch what I'm saying
[1:47:25] here
[1:47:26] you're the reason the unbeliever
[1:47:29] can't see
[1:47:30] that's right
[1:47:33] and the devil would like to make you
[1:47:35] think
[1:47:36] that it's your fault
[1:47:38] but a prophet of God says
[1:47:41] that it was God inside of you
[1:47:45] that was veiling this
[1:47:48] from the unbeliever
[1:47:51] what the scripture say I won't be able
[1:47:53] to quote the exact scripture maybe you
[1:47:54] guys could help me but I'll paraphrase
[1:47:57] it
[1:47:58] if they saw
[1:48:00] I'd have to heal them
[1:48:02] and I have to save them
[1:48:05] so there's more to this
[1:48:07] so don't start feeling bad that you're
[1:48:09] reading this and the prophet of God
[1:48:11] saying the reason the unbeliever can't
[1:48:12] see it is because of you
[1:48:15] you're actually doing the will of God
[1:48:18] instead of looking at you saying sisters
[1:48:20] young ladies
[1:48:22] mothers wives here why are you like they
[1:48:25] are
[1:48:26] instead they look
[1:48:27] with derision
[1:48:30] they look like they come out
[1:48:32] of a different century
[1:48:35] they look
[1:48:38] haggirly
[1:48:40] was one brother shared he's walking
[1:48:41] behind his wife and
[1:48:43] somebody made a comment look at that
[1:48:46] woman she looks so
[1:48:48] haggardly dressed like that
[1:48:51] and the brother is like I'm not going to
[1:48:53] make a contest with these people inside
[1:48:55] of a store but he's like huh
[1:48:59] haggardly don't look bad
[1:49:05] the beauty was in the eye of the
[1:49:07] beholder
[1:49:09] and God said right here Prophet says
[1:49:11] this amen
[1:49:13] that it's there now we'll close out on
[1:49:16] this
[1:49:17] once you come sister Ruth that'll force
[1:49:19] me
[1:49:20] as it is written see written you are
[1:49:22] written Epistles the Bible said now what
[1:49:25] is an epistle it's a written word and
[1:49:28] you are the written Can someone say
[1:49:31] thank you Lord other words you read it
[1:49:33] like this
[1:49:36] you it said you are written Epistles or
[1:49:39] you are the word that has been written
[1:49:42] made manifest nothing can be added to it
[1:49:46] you can't say I'm a written epistle and
[1:49:48] living some other kind of something but
[1:49:50] what this has already wrote brother
[1:49:52] Branham patches Bible because nothing
[1:49:54] can be added or taken away this is why
[1:49:56] now sisters you are the perfect example
[1:49:58] of the believer of the church and this
[1:50:01] is why God's anointed you and to have a
[1:50:04] heart to be who you are because nothing
[1:50:07] can be added
[1:50:09] and nothing can be taken from you
[1:50:12] or
[1:50:13] we are a denomination
[1:50:16] because then if something's added to you
[1:50:19] sister see don't let the devil convince
[1:50:21] you I need to do this and this
[1:50:24] to look pretty
[1:50:27] [Music]
[1:50:28] come on it's a hard spirit I see it
[1:50:31] happen all the time and it starts with a
[1:50:33] little something here now I hope I don't
[1:50:36] offend nobody but it can start with just
[1:50:38] a little blush
[1:50:41] now brother brother Brown said it was
[1:50:42] okay you know you had a little acne or
[1:50:44] something you can cover a lemon but I'm
[1:50:45] telling you the Devil comes and says you
[1:50:48] look so much better and if that made you
[1:50:51] look better well
[1:50:53] if a little Works how about a whole lot
[1:50:56] and then the devil's got another Avenue
[1:50:58] to work on
[1:51:00] see we're the bride of Christ nothing I
[1:51:03] know I'm stretching this please forgive
[1:51:05] me for that but nothing needs to be
[1:51:08] added
[1:51:09] or taken away
[1:51:11] we don't need to add it Saints bride we
[1:51:15] don't need to add it let's just be the
[1:51:17] word amen let it be manifested because
[1:51:21] we were chosen to rise right up out of
[1:51:24] this amen let's just stand and sing a
[1:51:28] song or two amen we were called to go
[1:51:31] beyond Saints we're not called to lay
[1:51:34] stay here amen I've never watched any of
[1:51:37] that but they had all of those Left
[1:51:38] Behind series amen you know a lot of
[1:51:41] those people they were called to be left
[1:51:43] behind
[1:51:44] but this bride wasn't
[1:51:46] it amen that's the whole reason God said
[1:51:48] I'll come and Shake Heaven and Earth for
[1:51:50] her because I am not leaving her behind
[1:51:53] amen she's the one I come for and she's
[1:51:56] the one I will take with me amen
[1:51:59] hallelujah what a contradiction I just
[1:52:02] read a little deal guys like when are
[1:52:04] they going to make another left behind
[1:52:05] story well I tell you what their version
[1:52:08] it was just a story
[1:52:11] but God as a bride that he's calling
[1:52:14] she's chosen he's not leaving her behind
[1:52:17] Hallelujah
[1:52:19] oh my
[1:52:21] Hallelujah

[1:55:23] we'll start off fast
[1:55:25] hope we can hang on to the end
[1:55:28] but it seems like the winning strategy
[1:55:32] is you start off pretty fast does
[1:55:34] something
[1:55:35] to the opponent
[1:55:38] then you run the endurance Runners two
[1:55:40] of them in the middle the ones that
[1:55:42] literally can run lap after lap the same

[1:56:06] got the word and you're running with it
