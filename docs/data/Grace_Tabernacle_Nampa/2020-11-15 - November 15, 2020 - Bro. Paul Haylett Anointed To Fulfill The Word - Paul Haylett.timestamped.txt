[47:10] lovee listen to
[47:15] our Hallelujah aren't you glad the Lord
[47:18] can just listen to your heart
[47:21] amen sometimes we as humans get so
[47:25] concerned
[47:27] that we say everything just right I can
[47:31] remember many years ago we were at
[47:34] visiting a church in the message and
[47:37] they asked me to come up and pray
[47:41] and I got up there and it was like I
[47:43] forgot English I forgot my brain shut
[47:46] off and I remember I I prayed and I went
[47:50] back to my seat and I was like oh my
[47:53] that couldn't even have made sense
[47:58] I just literally sat there for a portion
[48:00] of the service and thought Lord got up
[48:03] there and I just sounded like I won't
[48:06] use that word in the
[48:07] church I think you can imagine but you
[48:10] know after the
[48:12] service had an individual come up to me
[48:16] and say your prayer was exactly what was
[48:19] on my
[48:20] heart you see God's perfect we don't
[48:23] have to we don't have to try to get
[48:25] everything worded did just right amen
[48:29] like the little girl she just recited
[48:32] the alphabet when her parents asked her
[48:34] to pray and they said what are you doing
[48:36] honey she says well I don't know how to
[48:38] put the right words together but I
[48:40] thought if I just spoke the alphabet
[48:42] that God could put it together for
[48:45] me you know I just um uh we didn't
[48:53] um get this in the request there and
[48:55] instead of interrupting
[48:57] we want to remember our sister Miriam
[48:59] she's lost her mother and I can only
[49:03] imagine my mother's just down the street
[49:05] here and I can't go see her uh or
[49:08] haven't been in the past we'll try to
[49:10] the next few days um I guess they'll let
[49:13] us in I can't imagine being halfway
[49:15] around the world and losing someone you
[49:18] love I know there are those here that
[49:20] have experienced that and in the past
[49:23] and so we just want to remember our
[49:25] sister Miriam uh and uh just uh God
[49:29] would bring comfort and peace to their
[49:31] family uh that's just something we we
[49:34] want to
[49:35] remember and
[49:37] uh before maybe this isn't the right
[49:40] time forgive me but I just want to put
[49:42] this out um to those that are going to
[49:45] come to um our house this Thanksgiving
[49:50] uh with sister Jerry just like I would
[49:52] ask also if you could maybe just share
[49:54] with us um right your name on there how
[49:57] many you're going to come and what you
[49:59] plan to bring and so we just don't have
[50:01] chaos um so just a little reminder um
[50:05] you know Saints sometimes we um we hear
[50:10] prayer requests and we say okay we'll
[50:13] we'll pray for that we'll do that but I
[50:16] just ask if uh you would just sometimes
[50:19] we need a reminder if the brothers could
[50:21] put that first picture up on the screen
[50:24] uh this
[50:27] is uh message Church in
[50:30] Honduras and um this is after the water
[50:34] had already gone down enough that they
[50:36] could get to the church to take a
[50:37] picture not far from this church is
[50:40] Little Country Church that is no longer
[50:43] even in existence it's gone and
[50:46] Believers homes that were close to that
[50:48] church just simply swept away and so we
[50:51] see here that this is just a real thing
[50:54] and and this is actually from the
[50:56] previous storm and they have been hit
[50:58] again and uh so when you pray don't just
[51:02] give a momentary Lord help them in their
[51:06] need amen so if we would go to the next
[51:09] one this has come from our brother R
[51:12] Sorano this is in a suburb of
[51:16] Manila uh brother R shared a photo the
[51:19] other day out the front door of his
[51:21] house and the water was already over the
[51:23] wheels of the vehicles and then the
[51:25] water Rose another 3 or 4T and uh
[51:28] completely inundated the ground floor of
[51:31] their house uh this water here is uh 10
[51:35] ft deep and uh there are believers who
[51:38] live in these communities so just
[51:40] remember Saints uh when we lift our
[51:42] prayers before the Lord that these are
[51:45] real needs these are not just momentary
[51:47] remembrances but these are real needs
[51:50] that we need to lift before the Lord and
[51:53] while I don't have uh any photo support
[51:56] of this uh I was just had the privilege
[51:59] to have a nice lengthy conversation with
[52:01] brother George a few days ago he sent
[52:04] his greetings to the church says God
[52:05] bless you Saints and uh just uh sharing
[52:09] uh needs in
[52:10] Venezuela uh it is every day I've shared
[52:14] this with you before but I want to drive
[52:16] this home to you the things they passed
[52:19] over in the garbage yesterday they're
[52:22] eating
[52:23] today
[52:25] inflation has has doubled the price of
[52:27] everything in the last 30 days so what
[52:30] you could buy with $1
[52:32] us uh 30 days ago it takes
[52:36] $20 considering the fact that they have
[52:38] no money to start with this is a drastic
[52:42] thing so I just ask you to also lift up
[52:46] uh the Believers in Venezuela uh the
[52:49] people are fleeing the country in such a
[52:52] mass amount that uh Brazil uh uh
[52:57] Colombia uh uh the other bordering
[53:00] countries right there are actually now
[53:02] mobilizing their military to try and
[53:04] push the people back because now what's
[53:07] happening is every border city is inated
[53:11] with hundreds if not thousands of people
[53:13] they have no home they have no money
[53:15] they're sleeping on the streets they're
[53:17] begging and uh so we're seeing I don't
[53:20] mean to be political but we're seeing
[53:23] the aftermath of what the people in this
[53:26] country
[53:27] are voting
[53:28] for so it shows you how
[53:32] deceiving this spirit that is now coming
[53:35] into America is amen and uh so you know
[53:40] whenever and whenever we come face to
[53:43] face with with Satan and his
[53:47] lies uh I want you just to remember
[53:50] these natural reminders Satan has never
[53:54] brought life that's right he is always
[53:57] brought death our Lord Jesus Christ is
[54:00] identified scripturally as
[54:03] light Satan and his minions are
[54:05] identified as darkness and we can see it
[54:10] manifested in the world we live in amen
[54:13] so you see this so I just ask you please
[54:16] remember each and every one uh in these
[54:19] needs amen and uh you know lest we would
[54:24] get consumed by a spirit of fear
[54:27] uh we'll speak this
[54:28] morning uh a little topic on anointed to
[54:32] fulfill the word of God Amen you see

[55:22] about Talent see that's the thing Saints
[55:25] is let's never get off on the wrong
[55:27] track that it's about they hit every
[55:29] note correctly the spacing the timing

[55:36] heart amen Lord listen to our
[55:40] hearts amen hallelujah well I want to

[55:46] redemption's
[55:47] manifestation uh anointed to F fill the
[55:50] word now Saints I know and I just want
[55:53] to remind you you know the little chart
[55:55] we put on this screen the other day
[55:56] we're not off of that we're still headed
[55:58] down that but you know um I just want to
[56:01] touch on these things then we're going
[56:04] to go over and touch on the other side
[56:06] of it and then before we leave that
[56:09] level we'll go back to this side of it
[56:12] because we want the reminder my brother
[56:14] and sister we don't want to stick our
[56:16] head in the Sands that we're all
[56:18] believers we're Christians we're the
[56:19] bride everything's hunky dory uh the
[56:22] wheels fall off the wagon once in a
[56:24] while but the God who created it in the
[56:26] beginning will put it all back in its
[56:29] proper place before it's finished amen
[56:32] you know just as a reminder my my
[56:35] father-in-law was at our house last
[56:37] night uh brother Kevin Littleton and I
[56:40] don't know if you'll ever listen to this
[56:42] or somebody to listen to it and I don't
[56:44] mind but I'm telling you he had a a a
[56:47] joy he had a a brightness to him a
[56:51] Clarity to him and uh we talked about
[56:55] the good things of the Lord Lord and uh
[56:57] so you know what if we get caught in the
[57:00] middle
[57:01] ground we can't see the end so we got to
[57:05] remember God said this is finished so
[57:07] God's on the Finish Line looking back at
[57:10] us and he's telling you're going to make
[57:12] it you're going to make it problem is is
[57:15] we're the one that looks at every
[57:16] obstacle we're look at them you remember
[57:18] a little story maybe you wouldn't but
[57:20] just a few years ago there was a man who
[57:22] just a normal man uh wanted to run the
[57:25] Boston Marathon
[57:27] and uh he trained for for the longest
[57:30] time running running running running
[57:32] running now you people who like to run
[57:35] uh personally I think since they
[57:36] invented the motor there's not much need
[57:38] to run but um those of you like to run
[57:42] would understand this man and he wanted
[57:44] to run this and so it comes his season
[57:47] his time to run the Boston Marathon and
[57:50] um you know is he's he's I don't
[57:52] remember the exact details but he's ran
[57:54] a long ways he's run I think uh over the
[57:57] 20 mile Mark and uh he had a blister and
[58:02] it burst he has blood coming out of his
[58:04] tennis shoes and his mind has reached
[58:07] the point get this now his mind has
[58:10] reached the point that he says I can't
[58:12] do this and he was telling himself how
[58:15] sad you know he's running along here or
[58:17] shuffling along how sad this is that I
[58:19] it's a heart's desire and I tried so
[58:22] hard and I'm not going to do it I'm not
[58:24] going to finish this
[58:27] oh this is why Saints I've been telling
[58:29] you lift one another up in prayer stand
[58:32] with one another a total stranger comes
[58:35] out of the sidelines throws an arm
[58:38] around this man's shoulder and starts
[58:40] telling him you can do it you can do it
[58:45] you are so close you can
[58:49] finish and you know they had already
[58:52] rolled up the
[58:53] banner they were putting everything away
[58:56] and carting it away when this man
[58:58] crossed the Finish Line amen there was
[59:01] no people there with news cameras and
[59:04] all of this stuff but he went away from
[59:08] there with joy in his heart amen right I
[59:13] finished amen amen oh Hallelujah and you
[59:16] know what he you know what he got out of
[59:17] this he got a friend that lived right
[59:21] there this man that was a spectator
[59:23] looked out there and something in his
[59:24] heart says you need to encourage him and
[59:26] he went out there and went the last
[59:28] distance of that race
[59:31] hallelujah amen look at this my brother
[59:33] and sister Hallelujah I don't want to
[59:35] get sidetracked today amen anointed to
[59:38] fulfill the word let's turn to Second
[59:40] Kings the 7th chapter quite a lengthy
[59:43] scripture reading so we'll read to a
[59:45] portion of it and uh be seated then
[59:48] Elisha said hear ye the word of the Lord
[59:52] thus saith the Lord those are powerful
[59:54] words my brother and sister so but we
[59:56] know right now this is not Elisha
[1:00:00] speaking tomorrow about this time shall
[1:00:04] a measure of fine flour be sold for a
[1:00:06] shekele and two measures of barley for a
[1:00:08] shekele in the gate of Samaria then a
[1:00:11] Lord this is a man of authority then a
[1:00:14] lord on Whose hand the king leaned in
[1:00:16] other words the king sought advice from
[1:00:18] this man this is not a physical leaning
[1:00:21] this is a man that the king sought
[1:00:23] advice from answered the man of God and
[1:00:26] said behold if the Lord capital L would
[1:00:30] make Windows in heaven might this thing
[1:00:33] be in other words he's mocking
[1:00:36] right questioning and he said behold
[1:00:39] Thou shalt see it with thine eyes but
[1:00:42] Thou shalt not eat
[1:00:45] thereof and now seemingly a totally
[1:00:51] disconnected
[1:00:52] event and there are four leprous men at
[1:00:55] the entering in of the gate and they
[1:00:57] said one to another why sit we here
[1:00:59] until we die if we
[1:01:02] say we will enter into the city then the
[1:01:06] fam is in the city and we shall die
[1:01:08] there and if we sit still here we die
[1:01:11] also now therefore come and let us fall
[1:01:15] unto the host of the syrians and if they
[1:01:17] save us alive we shall live and if they
[1:01:20] shall kill
[1:01:22] us we shall but die
[1:01:26] you talk about a serious position they
[1:01:28] come in because you see we like to
[1:01:31] live but they' recognized oh we'll we'll
[1:01:35] try to focus on this a little they
[1:01:37] recognized
[1:01:39] right what have we got to
[1:01:42] lose I want to just interject this to
[1:01:45] people who haven't completely sold out
[1:01:47] to God I want to ask you what's holding
[1:01:50] you back what do you have to
[1:01:54] lose because if you sit even here in the
[1:01:57] house of God and do nothing you'll die
[1:02:00] and if you go out there you will die
[1:02:03] that's
[1:02:06] amen what have you got to lose that's
[1:02:10] right and they rose up in the Twilight
[1:02:13] to go into the camp of the syrians and
[1:02:15] when they were come to the uttermost
[1:02:17] part of the camp of Syria behold there
[1:02:19] was no man there for the Lord oh don't
[1:02:23] you love this it wasn't some leper my
[1:02:26] brother and sister it wasn't these
[1:02:28] people in a desate say it was the Lord
[1:02:30] had made the host of the syrians to hear
[1:02:33] a noise of Chariots and the noise of
[1:02:35] horses even the noise of a great host
[1:02:38] and they said one to another Lo the king
[1:02:40] of Israel have hired against us the
[1:02:42] kings of the Hittites and the kings of
[1:02:45] the Egyptians to come upon us Heavenly
[1:02:48] Father we just ask for your guidance
[1:02:50] today your anointing father let us
[1:02:52] preach the word let it be pleasing to
[1:02:54] you and beneficial to the Body of Christ
[1:02:56] we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:59] you may be seated
[1:03:02] Hallelujah and I guess we want to
[1:03:04] remember you know sometimes we just kind
[1:03:06] of Overlook things but to me each and
[1:03:09] every one of us presence is very
[1:03:11] precious or uh brother vasile sister
[1:03:14] Toma not here today our brother Ivan
[1:03:17] sister Nadia off celebrating an
[1:03:20] anniversary uh so that's a very very
[1:03:22] special thing amen we'll just go on and
[1:03:25] read a little more here wherefore they
[1:03:27] arose and fled now what happened was
[1:03:29] they heard something they didn't
[1:03:31] hallucinate it my brother and sister
[1:03:33] they heard something and wherefore they
[1:03:36] arose and fled in the Twilight and left
[1:03:38] their tents and their horses and their
[1:03:39] asses even the camp as it was and fled
[1:03:42] for their life and when these lepers
[1:03:44] come to the uttermost part of the camp
[1:03:47] they went into one tent and did eat and
[1:03:49] drink and carried then silver and gold
[1:03:51] and rment and went out and hid it and
[1:03:54] came again and entered into another tent
[1:03:57] and carried then also and went and hid
[1:03:59] it then they said one to
[1:04:02] another we do not well amen now I'm not
[1:04:06] going to bring this up again maybe a
[1:04:08] different service or something but I
[1:04:09] don't want to get sidetracked today I
[1:04:11] want you to understand that when you
[1:04:13] come to the word of God that hunger that
[1:04:15] was down in your soul the word was the
[1:04:18] only thing that would satisfied and when
[1:04:21] God gives that to you and he has given
[1:04:23] you a whole different countenance he's
[1:04:25] provid Ed your every need he's done your
[1:04:28] present and your future and he has even
[1:04:31] given you uh uh those things and you
[1:04:34] went and hid it in your heart now you
[1:04:37] did not do well if you just sat there
[1:04:39] without ever sharing that that's it if
[1:04:42] you sat there on that with those things
[1:04:44] and you've held it only to yourself you
[1:04:47] are right here in the scripture and you
[1:04:49] would have to look at yourself in the
[1:04:51] mirror and say we do not well to be
[1:04:53] reive such a incredible gift amen such a
[1:04:57] blessing when we were destined to die
[1:04:59] and go to hell and God said you know
[1:05:01] what here I I've already made the
[1:05:03] provision for you it's not anything you
[1:05:07] did it wasn't your ability it wasn't the
[1:05:10] word you spoke or the actions you took
[1:05:12] but I've made the way for you it's time
[1:05:14] for you now to share that amen and uh so
[1:05:19] they said to one another we do not well
[1:05:21] this day is a day of Good Tidings and we
[1:05:23] hold our peace if we har till the
[1:05:26] morning light some Mischief will come
[1:05:28] upon us now therefore come that we may
[1:05:30] go and tell the king's household so they
[1:05:32] came and called into the Porter of the
[1:05:34] city they told him saying we come to the
[1:05:37] camp of the syrians and behold there was
[1:05:40] no man there neither voice of man but
[1:05:43] horses tied and asses tied and Tents as
[1:05:46] they were and he called the porters and
[1:05:48] they told it to the King's house within
[1:05:50] and the King arose in the night and said
[1:05:52] unto his servants I will now show you
[1:05:55] that the syrians have done to us they
[1:05:58] know that we be hungry therefore they
[1:06:00] have gone out of the camp to hide
[1:06:01] themselves in the field saying when they
[1:06:03] come out of the city we shall catch them
[1:06:05] alive and get into the city oh my my
[1:06:09] brother and sister you look at that and
[1:06:11] realize how it is now look we can sit on
[1:06:14] that and we can hunker down and we can
[1:06:17] what I would call take this safe route
[1:06:20] that's it now sometimes in human uh
[1:06:23] reflection the safe route means do
[1:06:26] nothing that's
[1:06:28] right but if you've ever been hungry
[1:06:31] amen you've been hungry and something's
[1:06:34] been offered to
[1:06:35] you you can't get the idea out of your
[1:06:39] mind that there is something there to
[1:06:43] satisfy your hunger amen hallelujah for
[1:06:47] wherever the crumbs are the Eagles will
[1:06:52] be
[1:06:52] gathered no no no where the carus is
[1:06:57] hallelujah God didn't just offer you
[1:06:59] some crumbs from a table oh when you
[1:07:01] think about that my brother and sister
[1:07:03] how precious that is amen and one of his
[1:07:07] servants answered and said let some take
[1:07:10] now I laughed when I was reading this
[1:07:12] just felt like the Lord opened this to
[1:07:13] me it' be we we would need somebody to
[1:07:16] go out to the camp of the syrians and
[1:07:17] check out this rumor and so brother
[1:07:19] Trevor you're going to go just in case
[1:07:22] ass syrians are hiding out there in the
[1:07:24] grass brother Trevor you're going to be
[1:07:26] the one to go check I'm too important
[1:07:29] hallelujah oh my brother and sister amen
[1:07:33] that's not what the word meant when it
[1:07:35] said to prefer your brother
[1:07:38] Hallelujah let some take I pray thee
[1:07:41] five of the horses that remain they got
[1:07:43] down pretty skinny right there my
[1:07:44] brother in Samaria that was left in the
[1:07:46] city behold they are uh are as well as
[1:07:49] the multitude of Israel that are left in
[1:07:51] it behold I say they are even as the
[1:07:53] multitude of the Israelites that are
[1:07:55] consumed and let Ascend and see they
[1:07:59] took therefore two Chariot horses and
[1:08:01] the King sent after the host of the
[1:08:03] syrians saying go and see and they went
[1:08:06] after them into Jordan and lo all the
[1:08:08] way was full of garments and vessels
[1:08:10] which the syrians had Cast Away in their
[1:08:12] haste and The Messengers returned and
[1:08:14] told the king and the people went out
[1:08:16] and spoiled the tents of the syrians so
[1:08:19] a measure of fine flour was sold for a
[1:08:21] shekele and two measures of barley for a
[1:08:24] shekele according to the word of the
[1:08:27] Lord and the King appointed the Lord on
[1:08:30] Whose hand he leaned to have charge of
[1:08:34] the gate and the people troed upon him
[1:08:36] in the gate and he died as the man of
[1:08:39] God had said who spake when the king
[1:08:42] came down to him and it came to pass as
[1:08:44] the man of God had spoken to the king
[1:08:46] saying two measures of barley for a
[1:08:48] shekele and a measure of fine flower for
[1:08:50] a shekele shall be tomorrow about this
[1:08:53] time in the gates of Samaria and the
[1:08:55] Lord answered the man see he's just
[1:08:57] bringing back a reminder and the Lord
[1:09:00] answered the man of God and said now
[1:09:02] behold if the Lord should make Windows
[1:09:04] in heaven might such a thing be and he
[1:09:06] said behold Thou shalt see it with thine
[1:09:08] eyes but shall not eat thereof and so it
[1:09:11] fell out unto him what this so it fell
[1:09:14] out unto him what was this the prophecy
[1:09:17] oh I hope you see this saint the
[1:09:19] prophecy the prophesied that the wheat
[1:09:22] and The Barley would be sold and it
[1:09:24] would be available able in such
[1:09:26] abundance it also fell out to this man
[1:09:29] according to the prophecy his portion
[1:09:32] that's right oh hallelujah
[1:09:35] amen for the people Tred upon him in the
[1:09:38] gate and he died Lord we ask your
[1:09:42] blessings upon the word today amen now I
[1:09:45] just trust this morning that uh as the
[1:09:48] Lord laid this upon my heart I could
[1:09:50] express it to you amen you know as we
[1:09:53] look at these scripture it seems as
[1:09:54] though the word words of the Prophet
[1:09:56] Elijah were irrational as it were to the
[1:09:59] people at that time they had been under
[1:10:01] a great Siege they had been uh uh cooped
[1:10:04] up locked within the walls of the city
[1:10:06] you have to be very careful when the
[1:10:08] enemy is at the gate to to to leave the
[1:10:10] gate unlocked that they just have free
[1:10:12] entrance right the prophet of God told
[1:10:14] us that if we uh wanted to uh not be
[1:10:18] affected I'm just paraphrasing this
[1:10:20] didn't want to be affected uh by the
[1:10:22] spirits and the things of this world to
[1:10:24] stay on under the blood so my brother
[1:10:27] and sister you stay inside the Gate of
[1:10:29] the blood and keep that latch then Satan
[1:10:32] has he can't actually he can't get to
[1:10:35] you amen uh it's when we open the gate
[1:10:37] and step out beyond the blood that Satan
[1:10:40] does that now I'll tell you my brother
[1:10:42] and sister that's a hard one to swallow
[1:10:43] sometimes because we actually say well
[1:10:46] you know each and every day there's this
[1:10:48] something happens and that just shows
[1:10:50] you the human element and how that by
[1:10:53] our nature we consistently want to do
[1:10:55] what we want to
[1:10:56] do so we have what we would call Life
[1:10:59] habits and we can justify them amen I
[1:11:02] don't go to church because the preacher
[1:11:03] just preaches the same thing over and
[1:11:05] over again I just kind of got bored with
[1:11:07] that well maybe you need to hear that
[1:11:09] same thing over again to remind you that
[1:11:12] you need to stay under the blood amen
[1:11:15] because our human nature tends to say
[1:11:17] okay okay and we go out and do what we
[1:11:19] want to do anyhow amen now look at this
[1:11:23] these these words of the Prophet Elisha
[1:11:26] just seemed irrational they'd been under
[1:11:28] siege the city Been Under Siege been
[1:11:30] under attack they had been facing an
[1:11:34] uncertain
[1:11:36] future now I want you to think when you
[1:11:39] go back and study history and try it to
[1:11:41] this scripture they had been eating
[1:11:43] their animals history has a very graphic
[1:11:46] account that they had resorted to even
[1:11:49] eating their dead
[1:11:53] children this is a desperate time
[1:11:56] this is not just hey we missed a meal
[1:12:00] this is coming down to the time as the
[1:12:01] scripture says they had a little handful
[1:12:04] of horses
[1:12:07] left facing an uncertain time things
[1:12:09] look very
[1:12:10] Bleak for the
[1:12:12] future sound familiar y Hallelujah we
[1:12:17] might not be starving physically today
[1:12:20] but the scripture said there would come
[1:12:22] a time that the people would be
[1:12:24] spiritually
[1:12:26] malnutritioned amen come a time that the
[1:12:29] word of God the presence of God would be
[1:12:31] absent from amongst them and I can
[1:12:33] assure you my brother and sister that
[1:12:35] when the spirit of God is absent from
[1:12:37] Humanity Humanity Resorts back to a
[1:12:40] beast
[1:12:45] nature it's that
[1:12:49] simple all of these things that are
[1:12:52] happening are starting to sound familiar
[1:12:56] now we must remember speaking of Elisha
[1:12:59] here but it it applies otherwise we must
[1:13:01] remember that any real servant of God
[1:13:04] it's not the man speaking it's God
[1:13:06] speaking amen and it's interesting
[1:13:09] because it seems hard for people to
[1:13:11] remember that sometimes they they they
[1:13:14] feel like you know uh we live in a day
[1:13:16] that that uh you know uh times of change
[1:13:19] we're a more of a cultured civilized
[1:13:21] kind of people uh you know the preacher
[1:13:24] doesn't need to PR preach so hard we we
[1:13:27] understand this and my brother and
[1:13:29] sister you see what happens when that
[1:13:31] Spirit comes the prophet of God said the
[1:13:33] problems that we have now prophecy would
[1:13:36] show us scripturally that that it is
[1:13:38] bigger than this but the prophet was
[1:13:40] making a point and he said the problem
[1:13:43] we have is weak
[1:13:45] pulpits you see what invaded the church
[1:13:49] started at the
[1:13:51] pulpit and if you don't think so just go
[1:13:54] read the words of these men of
[1:14:00] old quotations that are recorded for
[1:14:07] posterity when more than a hundred years
[1:14:09] ago a quotation was made they'll come a
[1:14:12] time that the people think they can come
[1:14:14] to
[1:14:15] Christ without
[1:14:18] changing it's fulfilled right before our
[1:14:21] eyes we live in a day it's identified my
[1:14:24] I said
[1:14:26] I said I'm a
[1:14:28] Christian where was the
[1:14:33] change I won't go into quoting many
[1:14:35] other things but I on occasion look into
[1:14:39] the words of toer and
[1:14:41] Spurgeon
[1:14:43] Wigglesworth some of those things you
[1:14:45] see the prophet of God as I kind of
[1:14:47] alluded to this last Sunday the prophet
[1:14:48] of God said they were men of God some of
[1:14:51] them even Pro taught the Trinity but
[1:14:53] brother Brandon was showing us how how
[1:14:55] in the season that they were in that's
[1:14:58] all God required out of them and that's
[1:15:00] all they
[1:15:01] knew but he didn't repudiate them as as
[1:15:05] false doctors uh of the Gospel he didn't
[1:15:08] uh repudiate them or whatever that was
[1:15:10] the light that was shining in that hour
[1:15:14] now I'm going to say a statement here I
[1:15:16] hope it doesn't offend anybody but my
[1:15:18] brother and sister if you're looking
[1:15:19] back to
[1:15:20] 1965 and and saying well this was this
[1:15:23] and this we've moved on time it's it's
[1:15:26] 2020 moving to 2021 the light amen is
[1:15:31] the same gospel but God is moving
[1:15:34] forward this bride is coming into a
[1:15:37] maturity amen we don't want to say being
[1:15:40] a bride typed as female we want to be a
[1:15:43] little girl my brother and sister it's
[1:15:45] only in a messed up culture that you
[1:15:47] send a little girl to be married amen
[1:15:51] amen no man brother Donnie Reagan drove
[1:15:53] that home many years ago no man in his
[1:15:56] right mind wants a little baby girl for
[1:15:59] a wife he wants a mature uh uh fool come
[1:16:03] to the fullness of who they are he wants
[1:16:06] one that knows what she was called for
[1:16:08] and more than willing to be a part of
[1:16:11] that amen so we're not looking for some
[1:16:13] little immature bride here amen so as we
[1:16:18] look at this we'll see that as time goes
[1:16:20] on my brother and sister you just look
[1:16:22] around the world we live in as time time
[1:16:25] goes on that doubters are very quick to
[1:16:29] speak and are much more vocal than Sons
[1:16:33] and Daughters of God oh yeah that's
[1:16:36] right they don't care where they're at
[1:16:39] what the circumstances is whether it's
[1:16:42] correct polite is what I mean to say or
[1:16:46] whether they're rude they have no
[1:16:48] problem you're
[1:16:51] wrong many times not even going back to
[1:16:54] the word of God God to see simply that's
[1:16:57] what's in them you're wrong I'm right
[1:17:00] you see how vocal that is but you see
[1:17:03] just because they are loud and they are
[1:17:05] quick does not make them right now let's
[1:17:07] just look at verse two if uh brother
[1:17:09] Alex will take us back there we'll look
[1:17:11] at verse two real quick here amen and um
[1:17:15] when we look at this he said then the
[1:17:17] then a lord on Whose hand the king
[1:17:20] leaned answered a man of God and said
[1:17:23] behold now now I don't remember all
[1:17:26] these little phrases of what it was you
[1:17:29] know we have all these breakdowns of of
[1:17:33] sentences remember that from school you
[1:17:36] had to take this sentence and you know
[1:17:38] they had all this line and a little line
[1:17:39] went up and it went off and another one
[1:17:41] went up off of that and and yes
[1:17:43] diagramming there there we go some of
[1:17:45] you actually remember amen uh so you
[1:17:49] know we we can diagram everything and
[1:17:52] try to figure out what should be there
[1:17:54] or we could take Paul's method of
[1:17:56] English and that is it said what it
[1:18:00] said
[1:18:02] amen so here's a man obviously learned I
[1:18:05] don't think he had a hick standing there
[1:18:07] giving him advice in in in his uh throne
[1:18:10] room
[1:18:12] if the Lord not
[1:18:16] when if the Lord would make Windows in
[1:18:20] heaven might this thing be see he's
[1:18:23] questioning even if God opened up the
[1:18:25] Heavens how could wheat and barley how
[1:18:28] could this come to pass I don't believe
[1:18:33] it now you see my brother and sister as
[1:18:35] a counselor to the king his words would
[1:18:38] have
[1:18:39] influence I want to ask you this morning
[1:18:43] who is your counselor
[1:18:45] right that's
[1:18:49] right can I rub it till you raw every
[1:18:52] one of you has a counselor amen every
[1:18:56] one of you have someone who exerts some
[1:18:58] form of influence over your life now I
[1:19:01] want to know is that advice bringing you
[1:19:04] to the place that you could look at thus
[1:19:06] sayith the Lord and say I believe
[1:19:09] it or does it bring a doubt that's it
[1:19:12] that's it does it bring you with a
[1:19:15] hesitance
[1:19:17] H once again
[1:19:20] who is your counselor
[1:19:27] might this thing be and he said hm no
[1:19:30] problem I got a response for you
[1:19:32] buddy you know that's how God works
[1:19:34] that's right amen God doesn't argue with
[1:19:36] you he just tells you how it
[1:19:38] is behold Thou shalt see it with thine
[1:19:41] eyes but shall not eat thereof see how
[1:19:46] quickly my brother and sister you got to
[1:19:49] remember Elisha is in the midst of the
[1:19:51] royalty of Samaria these are professing
[1:19:56] believers that's right and yet doubt
[1:20:01] could be spoke
[1:20:04] openly and given a
[1:20:09] measure
[1:20:11] amen come
[1:20:13] on now we should treat each other
[1:20:16] politely yes sir but my brother and
[1:20:19] sister we're also here to walk to the
[1:20:21] Finish Line together that man
[1:20:25] that was walking or started out running
[1:20:28] in that race down to a
[1:20:32] shuffle I hope you catch this when that
[1:20:36] man come out of the crowd that man later
[1:20:39] made a statement he said I I don't know
[1:20:40] why I did it I just felt to do this he
[1:20:43] comes out he puts his arm around this
[1:20:45] man starts supporting him and he starts
[1:20:47] speaking to him you can do it don't give
[1:20:50] up don't give up you can do it keep
[1:20:53] going you know you know what would have
[1:20:55] happened my brother and sister if that
[1:20:58] Runner that man would have turned and
[1:20:59] said you're a
[1:21:02] liar I don't believe a word you're
[1:21:04] telling me I can't do it what would the
[1:21:08] result be come on we don't have to be
[1:21:11] Geniuses to figure this out amen it was
[1:21:14] because he believed this man who was a
[1:21:17] complete stranger to him and that man
[1:21:19] says you can do it you can do it you can
[1:21:21] do it now how much more my brother and
[1:21:24] sister should we be able to believe when
[1:21:27] God sends those in our midst that
[1:21:29] believe the word stand on the word got a
[1:21:31] testimony in the word and they're
[1:21:33] telling you you can do it keep going
[1:21:36] keep pressing to the mark of the high
[1:21:38] calling you can do it oh if a man that
[1:21:42] knows a stranger could believe the words
[1:21:45] then how much more we as Sons and
[1:21:46] Daughters of God Brothers and Sisters in
[1:21:48] Christ should be able to take those
[1:21:50] words and say I believe it amen that's
[1:21:53] right right
[1:21:56] am but
[1:21:58] wait our
[1:22:00] pastor I know
[1:22:03] him I've seen his hindermost
[1:22:07] Parts sorry you got that close to
[1:22:11] me but if you're looking at Paul's
[1:22:13] speaking you might as well get up and
[1:22:16] walk out of here today because it won't
[1:22:18] do you a drop of good but if you
[1:22:20] recognize that God could use vessels
[1:22:23] that's right to speak speak to you just
[1:22:25] as a man from a crowd could come out
[1:22:27] feeling led to encourage
[1:22:31] someone that's right Hallelujah now this
[1:22:33] is not some Foundation that we're all
[1:22:36] just broken and you know just forgive me
[1:22:39] as I rob a bank and do this that and the
[1:22:41] other no no I'm talking about people
[1:22:44] that want to live the word I'm talking
[1:22:46] about people that care people that that
[1:22:48] lift these things before the Lord and
[1:22:50] ask God to open it to them amen
[1:22:53] hallelujah amen you see how that the
[1:22:58] negative was able to be
[1:23:01] expressed but the word of God said God
[1:23:05] always corrects the
[1:23:07] air so he was not going to leave those
[1:23:10] words that were spoken
[1:23:12] unresponded that's right H that's right
[1:23:16] my goodness you see Elisha prophesied
[1:23:20] that it would come to the place for the
[1:23:22] wheat and the bar
[1:23:26] I say wheat and barley it's flour they
[1:23:29] make flour out of wheat excuse
[1:23:31] me as a farmer I don't think about flow
[1:23:35] I think about what it took to make the
[1:23:40] flower see sure as that was
[1:23:44] prophecy the
[1:23:45] continuation of the prophecy declared
[1:23:49] you'll see it but never get to
[1:23:51] experience I want you to come down
[1:23:53] Saints look this morning a little direct
[1:23:54] to you but I want you to come down and
[1:23:56] realize there'll be many people around
[1:23:58] this message that will see this word as
[1:24:01] they were singing We Shall do Miracles I
[1:24:03] tell you people say well where is it
[1:24:05] where is it I'm sorry you can't see it
[1:24:07] it was prophesied that would we do
[1:24:09] greater things than this and it is
[1:24:12] coming to pass but some cannot see it
[1:24:16] amen that's right does that mean we're
[1:24:19] special Hallelujah I'm so special no
[1:24:22] it's God's grace God's grace come down
[1:24:25] but see the prophecy of the word says
[1:24:27] that these things will happen but
[1:24:28] there'll be those that eyes cannot see
[1:24:30] and ears cannot hear do you understand
[1:24:32] right here is a perfect example of that
[1:24:34] that man saw how that the flour and The
[1:24:37] Barley was worth and he saw this great
[1:24:40] thing come to pass but there he is by
[1:24:43] the very people that were
[1:24:45] delivered right became his
[1:24:48] judgment cuz they trampled him right in
[1:24:50] the gate now tell me my brother and
[1:24:53] sister as we move into our thought now
[1:24:56] tell me that God did not orchestrate the
[1:24:58] king appointing him the master of the
[1:25:01] gate otherwise he'd have been in the
[1:25:03] crowd running out the
[1:25:05] gate but he's appointed the master of
[1:25:08] the gate right what was it just in case
[1:25:11] the enemy come he was responsible for
[1:25:13] the gate to get closed and locked but
[1:25:16] that become his death now let's look at
[1:25:19] this I need to move on today
[1:25:20] hallelujah amen do you realize my
[1:25:22] brother and sister
[1:25:26] doubters never obtain the
[1:25:28] promise
[1:25:30] amen yeah that's right but let's go to
[1:25:33] our real Focus this morning amen let's
[1:25:35] just go as it were and touch on those
[1:25:37] scriptures in verse three if you would
[1:25:39] brother Alex bring that it is up there
[1:25:41] okay excuse me now look at this my
[1:25:43] brother and sister our real Focus this
[1:25:45] morning is actually going to be upon
[1:25:46] these four lepers now we understand that
[1:25:49] leprosy was a disease that caused the
[1:25:51] people to be an outcast they were not
[1:25:53] allowed to live live in their own home
[1:25:55] amongst their own family amongst the
[1:25:57] neighborhood but they were then put
[1:25:58] outside of the city whether it was a
[1:26:01] walled City or just a city they were
[1:26:02] they were put out and you know not very
[1:26:04] much of a bright future for someone with
[1:26:07] Leprosy and imagine now as you would be
[1:26:09] in life and you have leprosy and it's
[1:26:12] started now to literally eat your
[1:26:14] fingers and your hands and your toes and
[1:26:17] uh a nose and ears you're
[1:26:20] marked you're marked by leprosy big
[1:26:23] sores the uh beginning of it is sores
[1:26:26] appearing on the body uh left unchecked
[1:26:29] now in modern times we have ways to deal
[1:26:31] with that and and uh but my brother and
[1:26:34] sister even in modern times the after
[1:26:36] effect of leprosy still leaves its Mark
[1:26:38] upon the people amen so you look at this
[1:26:41] he's here's these four men and they are
[1:26:43] outside of the city and they're at the
[1:26:46] gate and uh they are lepers they they
[1:26:48] have no way my brother and sister to
[1:26:50] just move into the city move into back
[1:26:53] into their normal life and they are
[1:26:55] there and now this this assault or siege
[1:26:58] that is upon Samaria uh has had an
[1:27:00] effect upon them they can't go as we see
[1:27:02] in the scripture they can't go in they
[1:27:05] can't go out they're just trapped there
[1:27:07] and they're starving just like everyone
[1:27:08] else so now my brother and sister
[1:27:11] sometimes uh you know as brother Brown
[1:27:12] really preached this drove it home to us
[1:27:14] we need to cast down our reasonings but
[1:27:17] we need a balance to that amen you can't
[1:27:19] just do that because the scripture says
[1:27:21] come let us reason together so you it is
[1:27:24] as though you cannot come and Ponder and
[1:27:26] discuss the things of the word but it's
[1:27:28] when we start to rely on what we think
[1:27:32] amen that we have a council amen we have
[1:27:34] a group of people who now run the
[1:27:37] message or run our church or run the
[1:27:39] denomination and and whatever they say
[1:27:41] contrary to the word of God or not we
[1:27:43] follow that you see my brother and
[1:27:45] sister that's not how God works the
[1:27:47] prophet of God says look God has never
[1:27:49] come down to a council he's never come
[1:27:51] down to a group he always comes down to
[1:27:53] individual ual amen and so they are
[1:27:56] there and they are reasoning together if
[1:27:58] I could just put that to you this
[1:28:00] morning and they're looking at their
[1:28:02] options and I I I just love how this is
[1:28:05] I I would actually have liked to have
[1:28:07] met these men because they had very good
[1:28:09] deductive reasoning amen might have been
[1:28:11] a simple equation they're dealing with
[1:28:13] but they're like you know what hey we go
[1:28:15] in there we just starve to death with
[1:28:18] them and we stay right where we're at
[1:28:22] and we just starve to death on the the
[1:28:24] other side of the gate from them so what
[1:28:27] do we got to lose if we go down here to
[1:28:29] these syrians and and and they're here
[1:28:31] this big vast Army and and they they got
[1:28:34] Siege on this city you know it wasn't
[1:28:36] some couple little tents out here with a
[1:28:38] couple centries this is a vast Army that
[1:28:41] is there uh laying Siege and and you
[1:28:43] know I I just love their reasoning amen
[1:28:45] they're just like you know what we go
[1:28:47] there we die we stay here we die and so
[1:28:50] what we're going to do is we're going to
[1:28:51] just go down here and if they would be
[1:28:53] one of compassion in these syrians they
[1:28:57] would say these poor guys they're no
[1:28:59] threat to us we'll throw them some
[1:29:01] scraps and they're like let's go down
[1:29:03] there and if we
[1:29:05] live we live but what's the worst thing
[1:29:08] they can do to
[1:29:11] us we
[1:29:13] die reminds me of a story I read once I
[1:29:16] don't remember now what country
[1:29:19] was but these people were making a
[1:29:22] threat
[1:29:24] to a
[1:29:25] missionary they're like we're going to
[1:29:27] kill you other people down
[1:29:31] slobbering sobbing spare our life spare
[1:29:35] our life they come to this one
[1:29:37] man and they're like we're going to kill
[1:29:40] you praise the
[1:29:42] Lord what do you mean praise the lord
[1:29:46] well I've spent my whole life trying to
[1:29:47] get to heaven maybe God sent you to help
[1:29:50] me get there sooner than I thought
[1:29:55] they're like what is wrong with you but
[1:29:57] do you see the difference in the nature
[1:29:59] the reaction something that had happened
[1:30:02] this man knew where his real life was he
[1:30:05] knew they did not control his life he
[1:30:07] didn't need to beg them cuz you know
[1:30:10] what he was doing he'd be begging the
[1:30:12] devil to spare his life and the devil is
[1:30:14] not the one who gives you life it's God
[1:30:16] that controls life Hallelujah another
[1:30:19] story that goes with that where they put
[1:30:21] the gun against the man's head and
[1:30:22] pulled the trigger and then it it
[1:30:24] doesn't go off and he pulls a trigger
[1:30:26] again it doesn't go off pulls the
[1:30:28] trigger again it doesn't go off dumps
[1:30:29] the shells out and every one of those
[1:30:32] shells had an indentation on the primer
[1:30:34] and then they even caught a revelation
[1:30:36] you're not supposed to
[1:30:38] die come on my brother and sister you
[1:30:41] know what I'm going to just go down here
[1:30:42] amongst the syrians which was their
[1:30:44] enemy and we're going to go and if they
[1:30:46] have compassion we'll live and if they
[1:30:47] don't hey what's going to happen we're
[1:30:49] going to die but we was going to die
[1:30:51] anyhow so no problem here I love their
[1:30:54] deductive reasoning oh God give us the
[1:30:56] courage if it had ever come to that in
[1:30:58] this country that we would stand there
[1:31:00] look at it and say thank you God
[1:31:02] ordained you to promote me to glory amen
[1:31:06] hallelujah so as they do that they come
[1:31:08] down now into to the host of the syrians
[1:31:12] and and um you know what they were
[1:31:16] following without realizing my brother
[1:31:18] and sister I I want you to catch this
[1:31:20] now because we're we're talking about
[1:31:22] being anointed to f fulfill the word of
[1:31:24] God is is these four lepers in their
[1:31:28] reasoning we go there we die we stay
[1:31:30] here we die let's go down and see if we
[1:31:31] can find compassion amongst the syrians
[1:31:33] what they didn't realize is God was
[1:31:35] anointing them amen in their in their
[1:31:38] flesh all they were thinking is we are
[1:31:41] emaciated we are starving to death and
[1:31:44] and what is the worst thing they can do
[1:31:45] put us out of our misery what they
[1:31:47] didn't realize is the anointing of
[1:31:49] almighty God had come down upon them and
[1:31:53] as they are reasoning this out it made
[1:31:56] their decision of such Stark Clarity
[1:31:59] that they didn't say we'll think about
[1:32:01] it or we
[1:32:03] might try and survive another day they
[1:32:06] the reasoning became so Crystal Clear to
[1:32:09] them they turn and start going to the
[1:32:12] syrians camp and little did they know at
[1:32:15] the time that they were fulfilling a
[1:32:18] prophecy oh I hope you catch this Saints
[1:32:21] we look at this oh why did I go here I
[1:32:23] made a decision and and it turned out to
[1:32:25] be a bad decision and it took me around
[1:32:27] over here and it brought me here and I
[1:32:29] went this way and I went that way and
[1:32:31] then we'll say well maybe I was just in
[1:32:33] God's permissive will or maybe it was
[1:32:35] God's anointing on your life that you
[1:32:37] needed to sit in a job in a machine or
[1:32:39] in a warehouse and look somebody in the
[1:32:41] face and say you know there was a time I
[1:32:43] serve God and and I slid away from him
[1:32:46] and I've not been happy since and
[1:32:48] something strike you and say that's it I
[1:32:51] was happy when I served the Lord and
[1:32:54] cause that man to pull back and look
[1:32:55] around himself and say you know what
[1:32:57] I've got to do if I stay here I will die
[1:33:01] in this position if I go back over here
[1:33:04] where I was as a borderline believer I
[1:33:06] will die there I need to get back to
[1:33:08] Christ I need to get back to the word
[1:33:11] hallelujah I was just reading I I was
[1:33:13] going to make a sermon out of it but I'm
[1:33:14] going to share it with you the prophet
[1:33:16] of God I I it's more than one place amen
[1:33:19] but the prophet of God says there now
[1:33:22] you know it is a son of man right we
[1:33:24] know that to be the prophet right amen
[1:33:27] introducing us to the son of man we
[1:33:31] understand that's Jesus Christ but the
[1:33:33] prophet goes on to say the son of man is
[1:33:36] the word that's right oh what was it my
[1:33:39] brother and sister you see not that you
[1:33:41] got to find a man somewhere standing in
[1:33:44] the shadows even though we sing the
[1:33:46] songs and talk about those things when
[1:33:48] the the son of man made the introduction
[1:33:51] to bring us back into the word you get
[1:33:54] fully in the word are you with me fully
[1:33:57] in the word and you have come in the
[1:33:59] presence of Jesus Christ people are like
[1:34:02] I'd like to see the Lord get in the word
[1:34:04] Christ has manifested in his word and he
[1:34:07] doesn't want to just stay in the word he
[1:34:08] wants to get into you that the word
[1:34:10] might live through
[1:34:12] you oh Hallelujah is it all right to be
[1:34:15] excited this morning hallelujah amen
[1:34:19] amen they were being led they were being
[1:34:21] influenced of the Lord to fulfill this
[1:34:23] prophecy
[1:34:24] but look at this in fulfilling this
[1:34:27] prophecy the
[1:34:28] word they found life for
[1:34:32] themselves amen that's right that's
[1:34:35] right I've heard people people I know I
[1:34:39] know them fairly
[1:34:43] well breaks your heart
[1:34:46] actually since I come to the message
[1:34:48] just been
[1:34:49] turmoil well Hallelujah whether you
[1:34:51] serve God or you don't Life's a battle
[1:34:54] I'm sorry people are out here what are
[1:34:56] they turning into alcoholics often times
[1:34:59] to drown their disappointment of the
[1:35:02] expectations they had of their own life
[1:35:05] that never come to pass so they start
[1:35:09] drowning that and Destroy whatever
[1:35:12] relationships they had I tell you my
[1:35:13] brother and sister I'd rather live in a
[1:35:15] mud
[1:35:16] hut I I apologize to the Lord I
[1:35:19] apologize this church I fight with the
[1:35:22] nature that Paul has
[1:35:25] to
[1:35:26] push as it were to gain ground to be
[1:35:29] successful to to
[1:35:32] acquire I have to fight against
[1:35:38] that some might have to fight against
[1:35:40] Pride or whatever it might
[1:35:43] beely whatever has driven me since I was
[1:35:45] a young boy to just press and press and
[1:35:50] press had a man some time back look at
[1:35:53] me I I made
[1:35:54] a I hope you see the humor in this I
[1:35:57] made a little vow to myself that I
[1:35:59] wasn't throwing this one pair of work
[1:36:00] boots away until this year was
[1:36:02] completely done the toes are wore out
[1:36:04] they're cracked out the sides I don't
[1:36:06] dare walk in deep anything because it'll
[1:36:08] be inside the boots and and the other
[1:36:10] day here while back I had that pair of
[1:36:11] boots on and I was wearing a pair of of
[1:36:14] uh uh Dicky work pants that uh uh are
[1:36:18] older than some of our children here and
[1:36:19] they're completely wore out in the front
[1:36:21] and I said I ain't throwing them away
[1:36:23] until this year is done and uh this guy
[1:36:25] looked at me and he just smiled shook
[1:36:27] his head he says my Paul he said you
[1:36:30] look like the poorest person I
[1:36:32] know I don't really care what my looks
[1:36:36] are you see that's not it my brother and
[1:36:40] sister I'm not we're not here to impress
[1:36:41] each other right I look the most
[1:36:44] believer like in our whole church what
[1:36:47] does that mean what does it it means
[1:36:50] nothing you see it's not that we look
[1:36:52] like the believer but are we a
[1:36:56] Believer that's the difference it's not
[1:36:58] how well we talk the talk is how well we
[1:37:01] can walk that walk right and it's not
[1:37:03] like we walk the walk by some training
[1:37:06] to impress everyone that's you know cuz
[1:37:09] the man just pardon me we're a little
[1:37:10] off our notes but I tell you uh you you
[1:37:13] you don't want to be that man you know
[1:37:15] but brother Trevor he's my friend so
[1:37:17] he's good here and
[1:37:19] close brother Trevor says something my
[1:37:22] first instinct is I'll tear his throat
[1:37:26] out but because I've been trained so
[1:37:30] well I'm just
[1:37:33] like God bless you brother
[1:37:37] Trevor but you see inside that's it my
[1:37:41] mind's eye has his jugular in my hand

[1:37:47] I'm better than
[1:37:49] you oh my brother and sister it better
[1:37:53] be real inside of us that someone
[1:37:56] insults you and your prayer from your
[1:37:59] heart is God help my brother amen that's
[1:38:03] right cuz you see talking about the
[1:38:05] deceiver it says that inside they are
[1:38:07] ravening
[1:38:08] wolves oh don't go running around
[1:38:11] looking for something with a long nose
[1:38:12] and big teeth and pointy ears and beady
[1:38:15] eyes cuz the ravenous wolf is hiding on
[1:38:19] the inside that's right oh Goden oh God
[1:38:23] help us don't let it be a surface
[1:38:27] conversion
[1:38:29] hallelujah oh my
[1:38:32] amen you see so it is for the day that
[1:38:35] we live in my brother and sister if I
[1:38:36] could express this it is in the word
[1:38:39] coming to pass that you and I find life
[1:38:41] for ourself amen it is not oh I I know
[1:38:45] some folks think I'm really hard on the
[1:38:47] message and that I might be headed out
[1:38:49] you know because I have some friends
[1:38:50] that quit
[1:38:54] now I don't want to go back there or
[1:38:56] whatever but I had people even without
[1:38:59] talking to
[1:39:00] me brother Jason sister Emy know what
[1:39:02] I'm talking about I preached a sermon up
[1:39:04] in Canada one time about
[1:39:06] fables there were some that went out
[1:39:08] from church that day and said he's
[1:39:10] following the rest of them he'll leave
[1:39:12] the message what they didn't catch was
[1:39:15] the season for us believing stories and
[1:39:18] when I say this I'm not discounting the
[1:39:20] stories but placing the story as a
[1:39:23] Foundation of your salvation I'm not for
[1:39:26] us looking back and saying look what God
[1:39:28] did for the prophet praise the Lord I'm
[1:39:35] saved what is it we got to have Brother
[1:39:40] David a new
[1:39:43] birth I don't care my brother and sister
[1:39:45] how well you know the birth dates of the
[1:39:49] prophet and his wife and children and
[1:39:51] when this happened here and when he
[1:39:53] visited here and when this and that and
[1:39:55] whatever those dates mean nothing my
[1:39:57] brother and sister that's us
[1:39:58] borderlining on believing fables we're
[1:40:01] believing that because somehow we
[1:40:03] memorized all this stuff that we've got
[1:40:05] the blood of Jesus Christ covering no my
[1:40:07] brother and sister it's a new birth that
[1:40:09] covers Us and if you can't remember your
[1:40:12] own mama's birthday or your own birthday
[1:40:14] it won't matter if you got the Holy
[1:40:17] Ghost
[1:40:18] right and I don't say that to be
[1:40:20] critical but I'm telling you it's coming
[1:40:22] to A Time my brother and sister that we
[1:40:24] got to realize that it is in the coming
[1:40:27] of the P coming to pass of the word of
[1:40:30] God in you and I that it'll be there as
[1:40:34] we have handled the scripture says as we
[1:40:36] have handled the word of life amen
[1:40:38] that's right that's what makes the
[1:40:40] difference anything else come
[1:40:43] on
[1:40:47] Amen reminds me of a time I wasn't there
[1:40:50] but I know men that were there and a man
[1:40:52] got up to give a testimony in church and
[1:40:53] he said I had a
[1:40:56] dream he had a
[1:40:59] dream I had a
[1:41:01] dream that I was there in
[1:41:06] heaven and I was walking along and I saw
[1:41:10] this and I did this and I spoke to you
[1:41:12] and I I spoke to
[1:41:14] you wait you skipped over
[1:41:17] me what you know what people gobbled it
[1:41:21] up that's right all of a sudden people
[1:41:23] people were like well we were part of
[1:41:24] this
[1:41:25] dream but did you know that on full an
[1:41:28] analyzation of the dream there was not
[1:41:32] one bit of spiritual significance that's
[1:41:36] it it was
[1:41:38] though oh my this is going to be
[1:41:41] difficult for me to use for an
[1:41:45] analogy but it was me and my
[1:41:48] four and no
[1:41:50] more that's scriptural isn't it
[1:41:54] no you
[1:41:55] see it's the word that's sharper than
[1:41:59] the two-edged sword it's what does the
[1:42:02] Discerning the separating that's not how
[1:42:06] I feel that's right that's right not how
[1:42:08] I feel now I actually realized I left
[1:42:11] part of it and you might realize that I
[1:42:12] left part of that dream out because it's
[1:42:14] so blunt that I'm not sure some of you
[1:42:16] could handle it and I do not like the
[1:42:18] smell of burning hair so um some things
[1:42:22] are just so blunt well maybe you guys
[1:42:25] can handle it can you handle it yes and
[1:42:30] he saw himself there in
[1:42:32] heaven as companion with another man's
[1:42:42] wife come
[1:42:44] on I don't care about your dream that's
[1:42:47] right I don't care about your dream what
[1:42:50] did the word say
[1:42:53] that's it you know what it tells you
[1:42:55] he'd been coveting In the Flesh
[1:42:58] natural exactly right and he was wishing
[1:43:01] it was so Amen on the other
[1:43:03] side God help us amen God help us amen
[1:43:08] see my brother and sister in the word
[1:43:09] coming to pass we find life for oursel
[1:43:11] and you realize the prophet of God's own
[1:43:13] words this is not Paul's words these are
[1:43:15] a prophet of God's words we cannot live
[1:43:17] in the light of another age amen we
[1:43:20] can't live under old Mana no now I know
[1:43:23] people around the message and I'm sorry
[1:43:25] for being blunt but I know people around
[1:43:26] the message that are are are so caught
[1:43:29] up that it has to be back it has to be
[1:43:31] back go back look back look back what
[1:43:34] about the fresh Mana where the prophet
[1:43:36] of God made the Declaration let this be
[1:43:38] a fresh Revelation to you today amen
[1:43:42] amen this is the word being open day by
[1:43:45] day is it a new gospel a new message a
[1:43:47] different gospel or message no it isn't
[1:43:49] but it's the gospel that was sent to you
[1:43:51] and I opened made fresh every day
[1:43:55] Hallelujah you know the wonders of
[1:43:57] sourdough it's really interesting sister
[1:43:59] Kristen take shared with my wife uh uh
[1:44:02] some sourdough I've never really been
[1:44:04] around sourdough you know it's kind of
[1:44:06] just uh you hear the phrase you know uh
[1:44:08] uh crusy sourdough pancakes but you just
[1:44:11] pour it out of a bag and put water and
[1:44:12] maybe an egg and hey you got sourdough
[1:44:14] no it's not the real thing we now have
[1:44:16] the real thing foaming up on our
[1:44:18] countertop it looks weird it looks
[1:44:20] grungy it looks like we're supposed to
[1:44:22] eat this thing it tastes so good that's
[1:44:27] right that's
[1:44:30] right you see it's not always what is
[1:44:35] beautiful sometimes this gospel is messy
[1:44:38] that's it it's not how big a
[1:44:41] church look what the prophet he preached
[1:44:44] about these big churches and look what's
[1:44:45] happening even in the message big fine
[1:44:48] multi-million dollar I'm not speaking
[1:44:51] down on that I'm not criticizing no one
[1:44:53] but we're not exempt my brother and
[1:44:54] sister so as you look at this I'm
[1:44:56] getting sidetracked Hallelujah you see
[1:44:59] we can't live in the light of another
[1:45:00] age in the old Mana you see because
[1:45:02] we're living in an open book that's
[1:45:04] right and the open book is bringing more
[1:45:06] word of fresh Revelation and when I mean
[1:45:08] fresh Revelation that means it's not old
[1:45:11] stuff but it's made new to you and I
[1:45:13] every day Hallelujah I don't remember
[1:45:15] the message book I was reading just the
[1:45:17] other day and as I was reading it I I've
[1:45:19] I've been in three or four this uh three
[1:45:22] this last
[1:45:23] short period of time but I was reading
[1:45:25] it I I I thought my this was preached in
[1:45:28] 1963 it could have been preached 2020
[1:45:32] maybe September or
[1:45:35] October that's how fresh it was you see
[1:45:38] it wasn't an old Revelation it was fresh
[1:45:40] because everything that was spoke right
[1:45:42] there was relevant right here today and
[1:45:45] especially relevant in my life and part
[1:45:47] of that was the prophet of God talking
[1:45:49] about God loves you so much he'll spank
[1:45:51] you amen and it's hard to say Thank You
[1:45:54] Lord when you've been spanked but in the
[1:45:56] end the result is beautiful Hallelujah
[1:45:59] you see this open book is the word for
[1:46:01] our day amen see my brother and sister
[1:46:03] what was happening now if you was one of
[1:46:05] these lepers or even those inside the
[1:46:08] gates of Samaria uh how much good would
[1:46:11] it do you to live on the memory of a
[1:46:14] past
[1:46:18] meal lepers hanging outside the gate
[1:46:20] right there just hoping somebody will
[1:46:22] feel bad accidentally throw something
[1:46:24] out
[1:46:29] or I remember
[1:46:32] Thanksgiving
[1:46:35] 2019 my wife cooked a 21
[1:46:40] lb prime
[1:46:43] rib it was so
[1:46:46] good it was so
[1:46:49] good I remember I went back for seconds
[1:46:52] and thirds and
[1:46:53] I also remember when I looked back again
[1:46:55] my
[1:46:56] son-in-law was eating the last piece and
[1:46:59] I was like that's not
[1:47:03] fair and about that time your stomach
[1:47:07] would
[1:47:08] growl and you'd be caught in a hunger
[1:47:11] Pang that would pull you
[1:47:17] down that
[1:47:19] memory did not do one thing for for
[1:47:25] you the prophet of God talks about
[1:47:28] coming to a man who is cold and
[1:47:30] weary and giving him a painted fire yeah
[1:47:35] that's it and telling him be warmed and
[1:47:39] go your
[1:47:40] way it won't do that person one bit of
[1:47:46] good oh but when you have a prophecy
[1:47:50] that's right when you have the word of
[1:47:52] the Lord
[1:47:53] thus saith the Lord I have no idea how
[1:47:57] God will bring it to pass I have no way
[1:48:00] that this could come there's just seems
[1:48:02] like no single way but something down in
[1:48:06] your heart and soul reaches out and says
[1:48:08] I didn't say it the king didn't say it
[1:48:11] and the King's helper didn't know what
[1:48:12] he was talking about but it's there but
[1:48:14] you see God took the lepers a step
[1:48:16] further they didn't even know I don't
[1:48:19] know the scripture doesn't show us but
[1:48:21] for sake today I'm going to tell you
[1:48:23] they didn't even know of the prophecy
[1:48:25] that's right they were just LED that's
[1:48:28] right I'm going down here to this Camp
[1:48:31] I'm going to go down here because I
[1:48:32] either get to live or die at that camp
[1:48:34] it won't be drawn out no more hunger
[1:48:38] pains oh
[1:48:40] Hallelujah now look at this Revelations

[1:48:46] put that I guess I did amen now look my
[1:48:49] brother and sister the promise of
[1:48:51] Prophecy
[1:48:53] I want you to read this scripture right
[1:48:55] here and realize that
[1:48:56] 2217 is a fulfillment of the promise of
[1:49:00] Prophecy amen because you see it's not
[1:49:03] just a spirit any longer but there's a
[1:49:05] bride who is fed on the body word of God
[1:49:09] which is the Gospel of Jesus Christ and
[1:49:11] she's fed on that until it has become so
[1:49:14] real to her she doesn't have to look
[1:49:17] back to another year she doesn't have to
[1:49:19] look back 15 20 30 40 years I'm just
[1:49:22] talking about life they don't have to
[1:49:23] look back on the time I was on fire for
[1:49:25] God they're on fire for God right now
[1:49:28] amen they don't have to look back and
[1:49:30] dream of a different day when all was so
[1:49:34] good my children were little and they
[1:49:36] just did everything I want to do well
[1:49:38] get your children under the blood of
[1:49:40] Jesus Christ pray for them like they
[1:49:42] were dying because they
[1:49:46] areen and when you catch that you'll be
[1:49:49] one with the spirit and the spirit and

[1:53:49] you to understand it's not what your
[1:53:52] want walk is it's what God's doing in
[1:53:54] your walk and he took the Walk of those
[1:53:56] lepers and he magnified that walk and
[1:54:00] all the syrians saw was a mass Army a
[1:54:04] great host of people a sound of Chariots
[1:54:08] amen the sound of foot soldiers the
[1:54:10] sound of a battle coming and oh
[1:54:13] Hallelujah all those syrians could think
[1:54:15] of there's a greater host that is out
[1:54:18] there and it's something that God by the
[1:54:21] word now look we're not manifesting this
[1:54:23] Physical Realm in that sense but by the
[1:54:26] word God said greater is he that is in
[1:54:30] you than he that is in this world and as
[1:54:33] a son or daughter of God from our youth
[1:54:36] our little children right up to the
[1:54:39] oldest of us as we are walking our walk
[1:54:43] as Believers God is magnifying that and
[1:54:46] shaking their very Foundation of Hell
[1:54:48] amen hallelujah it's not what you think
[1:54:51] about your foot steps it's what God did
[1:54:54] in you is going to shake the very
[1:54:57] Foundation of Hell Hallelujah that the
[1:55:00] devil don't know what to do with you
[1:55:03] amen the prayers of a son or daughter of
[1:55:05] God on their knees amen has the devil
[1:55:08] trembling oh Hallelujah excuse me I'm
[1:55:10] excited this morning amen I have to
[1:55:13] admit this it was a little bit humorous
[1:55:15] I was all wound up in the office and
[1:55:17] brother Jason opened the door and
[1:55:18] stepped in I was a little embarrassed
[1:55:20] cuz I was about in the motion of
[1:55:23] excuse me brother
[1:55:25] Jason but this just resonates in my
[1:55:28] soul cuz I could sit here this morning
[1:55:30] and you could sit here this morning and
[1:55:32] tell me I failed here and I drugged my
[1:55:35] feet here and I even fell down here and
[1:55:38] I went over this way here and I went
[1:55:40] back over that way here and God says I
[1:55:43] don't care I'm the one that's magnifying
[1:55:46] your walk it is not you or otherwise we
[1:55:50] would find those people that have never
[1:55:52] had a struggle in their whole life
[1:55:55] they've never had a problem in their
[1:55:56] whole life they've never lied they've
[1:55:58] never stole they've never done on of
[1:56:01] that I don't know who they are but
[1:56:02] anyway you know they'd be the ones that
[1:56:04] go in the
[1:56:05] Rapture not
[1:56:07] you I scratched the
[1:56:10] piano oh
[1:56:13] my well we'll just call it a battle
[1:56:18] Mark you see my brother and sister
[1:56:22] if it was about your walk the devil and
[1:56:26] the Syrian Army would be sitting on the
[1:56:29] sidelines right poor miserable
[1:56:36] leper Bob do we kill him or give them a
[1:56:39] little
[1:56:40] food I don't know they look like they
[1:56:42] need put out of their
[1:56:44] misery yeah but we got plenty of food
[1:56:47] yeah but still they're
[1:56:50] lepers got no reason to preserve their
[1:56:52] life they're not
[1:56:54] worthy of the
[1:56:59] Gospel can I
[1:57:01] finish
[1:57:04] Hallelujah you see now I only bring this
[1:57:06] in my brother and sister I didn't even
[1:57:08] put it on the screen I am doing the very
[1:57:11] thing I don't like people to do I'm kind
[1:57:13] of cherry picking out of a
[1:57:16] quote the prophet of God said in the
[1:57:18] greatest battle ever fought go look it
[1:57:20] up paragraph 194
[1:57:22] read before it read after it I'm not
[1:57:24] trying to change the point of view at
[1:57:26] anything these words just struck
[1:57:28] me if these Angel
[1:57:32] Spirits are anointed to bring you the
[1:57:36] word right to cause you to believe the
[1:57:41] word think about this that's exactly
[1:57:43] right the Holy Ghost God moving in his
[1:57:46] midst your midst I mean coming
[1:57:49] down Hallelujah
[1:57:53] causing you
[1:57:57] amen cause
[1:58:01] amen see God doesn't put chains on you
[1:58:05] and drag
[1:58:06] you but that
[1:58:08] anointing that was right there on those
[1:58:11] lepers they didn't realize it was
[1:58:12] causing them we can't go there we can't
[1:58:15] stay here what we need to go go here and
[1:58:17] what was it it was God himself anointing
[1:58:20] them the Holy Ghost the spirit
[1:58:23] influencing them to go down here
[1:58:26] amen because you know what they could
[1:58:28] have done they could have said you know
[1:58:30] what I think I'll do let's just go over
[1:58:32] there still a couple leaves on that bush
[1:58:34] over there and let's just eat sticks no
[1:58:36] no in their mind it was like there's
[1:58:41] either deliverance from this life or a
[1:58:42] good meal right down here
[1:58:46] right did you catch that
[1:58:49] amen we get both amen
[1:58:52] we get deliverance from life and a good
[1:58:55] meal amen but God anointed see to bring
[1:58:59] that those angels to bring the word the
[1:59:01] Holy Ghost to bring the word to you to
[1:59:03] cause you that is exactly to believe
[1:59:07] thank you Lord amen thank you Lord you
[1:59:09] believe in causeing effect it's a
[1:59:11] somewhat scientific idea but causeing
[1:59:13] effect amen it's very true very true I
[1:59:17] did that to some young people in in in
[1:59:19] Chile you know I I I had forgot my

[2:03:32] exactly right absolutely I can share
[2:03:35] testimony I I'll just give the brief of
[2:03:36] it of brother back East amen he he'd
[2:03:39] been there a long time and and uh the
[2:03:42] management kind of changed from the the
[2:03:44] father to the son of this business and
[2:03:47] uh so then they the son was decidedly
[2:03:49] not a Christian and this brother would
[2:03:51] take time off he'd ask for a Friday
[2:03:53] they'd be driving to special meetings
[2:03:55] and the son was like you know what I I
[2:03:58] I'm I'm done with this you need to
[2:03:59] conform this is in the ages the time you
[2:04:01] know that that you know kind of
[2:04:03] unemployment was up and there's more
[2:04:05] people out there than there is jobs and
[2:04:07] the sun was like no more of that and he
[2:04:10] come along and and of course you you
[2:04:12] know the system well I've got personal
[2:04:14] leave day I'm taking a personal leave
[2:04:16] day so we can leave on Friday Drive
[2:04:17] these meetings comes back from that and

[2:04:21] up to our attorney to figure out the
[2:04:23] explanation but you're fired you're done
[2:04:25] you're out of here I ain't putting up
[2:04:26] with people like you you religious
[2:04:28] Freaks and from that day right there it
[2:04:31] was not three years that business was
[2:04:33] bankrupt absolutely right did the
[2:04:35] brother go around and crawl about it no
[2:04:38] but the man one day runs into the father
[2:04:40] in a store and he says I want to
[2:04:44] apologize it was my error also because I
[2:04:48] let my son do that and it was one of the
[2:04:51] worst decisions we ever made cuz I
[2:04:54] didn't recognize till later God was
[2:04:57] blessing us yeah that's right right that
[2:05:01] might be a little narrow cross- section
[2:05:02] to judge that off but I'll tell you my
[2:05:03] brother and sister God promised he would
[2:05:06] provide for you amen amen

[2:05:23] it's a walk by faith not by sight amen
[2:05:26] amen don't be trying to look at what
[2:05:27] you're doing when God anoints you to
[2:05:29] step and to move and to do that just
[2:05:31] follow it amen amen just keep doing this
[2:05:34] but you see what happens is we can't
[2:05:35] force this to happen amen no more than
[2:05:39] we can change the course that's right I
[2:05:41] don't care if this election was stolen
[2:05:44] that's it I don't care if it was
[2:05:45] complete corruption that that took
[2:05:49] this if God allows it to stand
[2:05:53] then that's what it was meant to be and
[2:05:55] if it was corrupt that's only because
[2:05:57] the prophet of God said in Abraham
[2:05:59] Lincoln and a George Washington on every
[2:06:02] corner can't change the direction of
[2:06:05] this
[2:06:06] country come on let's just take all the
[2:06:09] quotes amen there's some interesting
[2:06:11] things just watched a video here the
[2:06:13] other day somebody mapping it all out
[2:06:15] about Camala Harris and Biden and where
[2:06:17] they're at in Scripture it was
[2:06:18] interesting my brother and sister but
[2:06:20] that's not what I'm counting on amen I'm
[2:06:22] counting on the word that wasn't
[2:06:23] speaking about Camala Harris and Joe
[2:06:26] Biden I'm counting on the word that was
[2:06:28] speaking about you and I that's the word
[2:06:30] that matters amen cuz we've already
[2:06:33] identified the devil in scripture but we
[2:06:36] don't go around focusing all our time on
[2:06:38] the devil amen it's time to focus on the
[2:06:41] word and the promise of the prophecy
[2:06:44] amen cuz we're anointed to fulfill the
[2:06:47] prophecy concerning the bride not the
[2:06:50] prophecy concerning the the devil out
[2:06:53] here amen so let's focus on the right
[2:06:55] thing Hallelujah Romans 8:14 says for as
[2:07:00] many as are led by the spirit of God
[2:07:03] come on not the spirit of Le oia not the
[2:07:06] spirit of some political oriented PR
[2:07:09] message preacher my brother and sister
[2:07:11] those that are led by the spirit of God
[2:07:13] they are the sons of God it'll take a
[2:07:16] son to follow the spirit for you have
[2:07:18] not received the spirit of bondage again
[2:07:21] now I I'm moving in a little political
[2:07:23] vein here and forgive me but my brother
[2:07:26] and sister there's people around the
[2:07:27] message that are practically crying in
[2:07:29] their lunch over the fact that Joe Biden
[2:07:32] and CA Harris got elected right crying
[2:07:35] in their lunch what are we going to do I
[2:07:37] tell you if you're a real bride of
[2:07:39] Christ you're going to look at
[2:07:40] Revelations 1967 89 and you're going to
[2:07:44] say I'm going to be
[2:07:46] ready I don't care who controls the
[2:07:49] Senate and the house and how corrupt the
[2:07:51] courts are and what is happening in this
[2:07:54] world whether they strike down Obamacare
[2:07:57] whether they take abortion off the table
[2:07:59] none of that matters I will be ready for
[2:08:02] the coming of my Lord that's the
[2:08:05] Fulfillment of Prophecy for the bride of
[2:08:08] Christ it is not that we go out and do
[2:08:11] that we'll have our day my brother and
[2:08:12] sister I don't want to sound like I'm
[2:08:14] gloating but there's going to be the day
[2:08:16] that we walk out on the ashes yes right
[2:08:19] that's exactly oh Hallelujah not that
[2:08:21] we're going to be happy H I just stepped
[2:08:23] on Joe
[2:08:26] Biden huh that's right
[2:08:29] no because you were ordained anointed to
[2:08:35] fulfill this prophecy that's right
[2:08:37] Hallelujah for as many as are led by the
[2:08:39] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[2:08:42] for we have not received a spirit of
[2:08:44] bondage again to
[2:08:47] fear but you have received the spirit of
[2:08:49] adoption amen what do we do we don't
[2:08:53] look to the old we look to the new for
[2:08:57] the spirit itself beareth witness within
[2:08:59] our spirit that we are the children of
[2:09:05] God
[2:09:08] [Music]
[2:09:10] hallelujah you know what happens Saints
[2:09:12] sometimes God brings things
[2:09:15] out good things of
[2:09:17] God and people have been so steeped in
[2:09:20] Traditions
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:22] ideologies under
[2:09:25] [Music]
[2:09:27] leaderships they'd reject the good
[2:09:29] things of God thinking somehow they're
[2:09:30] being
[2:09:32] trapped I encourage you if you have even
[2:09:36] one iota of
[2:09:38] question about whether you can be
[2:09:40] deceived or
[2:09:42] not I encourage you to go dig in the
[2:09:45] message cuz you will
[2:09:47] find in the
[2:09:49] message big bold
[2:09:54] letters the prophet of God saying you
[2:09:58] cannot be
[2:10:01] deceived don't let that Spirit of
[2:10:06] bondage it might have passed through our
[2:10:08] church yeah I'm speaking blunt I hope
[2:10:11] that don't offend anybody I'm going to
[2:10:13] keep going my brother and sister until
[2:10:15] that spirit is completely dead and I
[2:10:18] have a marker Stone on it and I'm not
[2:10:21] going to write rest in peace either
[2:10:25] no my brother and sister the prophet of
[2:10:27] God said in bold letters in the church
[2:10:29] age book and many other service you
[2:10:32] cannot be deceived if you come to God
[2:10:37] and you are ordained to go to God there
[2:10:40] is nothing will keep you from coming
[2:10:43] into his
[2:10:46] presence don't let those question marks
[2:10:48] that the devil's shelling out
[2:10:52] sorry
[2:10:53] Satan you were talking to the guy at the
[2:10:57] gate you weren't talking to me cuz God
[2:11:01] didn't need to open Windows in heaven to
[2:11:03] pour out to fulfill the prophecy because
[2:11:06] he had already made the way possible
[2:11:09] before the foundation of the world he
[2:11:12] don't have to do some Supernatural
[2:11:14] miraculous thing to catch my attention
[2:11:17] and keep my attention what he got was
[2:11:20] that seed now my brother and sister a
[2:11:22] brother I know preached a lovely service
[2:11:24] here recently and I listened to a
[2:11:26] portion of it he said my brother and
[2:11:27] sister it ain't out here in this
[2:11:30] world and you might think well okay you
[2:11:32] know the seed can only do as good as the
[2:11:34] soil it's in well this is true but this
[2:11:36] brother made the point he said the
[2:11:38] potential the scripture does not say the
[2:11:40] potential is in the world of leoda and
[2:11:43] it's not the potential of the soil the
[2:11:46] potential is in the seed that's it cuz
[2:11:49] it don't matter how good a soil you God
[2:11:52] if the seed has no potential but the
[2:11:55] word was planted as a
[2:11:58] seed oh the soil does matter my brother
[2:12:01] and sister but it's not whether you were
[2:12:03] in America in Le oysa people are like oh
[2:12:05] we've been told this before and I find
[2:12:07] it humorous a little frustrating at the
[2:12:09] time but humorous now looking back
[2:12:11] people are like oh we feel so sorry for
[2:12:13] you message people in
[2:12:15] America say
[2:12:18] what yeah yeah it's a great evil the
[2:12:22] prophet of God said there was no hope
[2:12:23] for you you got a quote that he's
[2:12:26] There's Hope for the people in Uruguay
[2:12:29] Paraguay here away there way anywhere
[2:12:33] away no sir the
[2:12:36] potential is in the seed that's it and
[2:12:39] the
[2:12:40] seed according to prophecy amen is in
[2:12:44] you and me that's it oh can we just
[2:12:46] stand and praise the Lord today huj
[2:12:49] Hallelujah didn't even get to my
[2:12:52] quotes oh my
[2:12:54] goodness
[2:12:56] oh
[2:12:58] Hallelujah can I just read the quote
[2:13:02] please Hallelujah this is getting
[2:13:03] terrible i've got such a bad habit you
[2:13:05] guys got to quit you know what I'm going
[2:13:07] to I'm going to take another approach if
[2:13:09] you guys would all just start frowning
[2:13:10] and sleeping I'd
[2:13:12] quit please don't please
[2:13:15] don't let's put that quote up brother
[2:13:18] Alex and I promise your Saints we'll be
[2:13:20] done
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:25] Abraham saw it see he did not look to
[2:13:29] any of the
[2:13:30] misunderstandings of the promise that's
[2:13:35] right you know the disbelieve the sign
[2:13:42] website has all kinds of
[2:13:44] things well this hasn't happened and
[2:13:48] this hasn't happened and this this
[2:13:51] wasn't the way he said it would
[2:13:56] be huh he didn't look at any of the
[2:14:03] [Music]
[2:14:08] misunderstandings amen and I've said it
[2:14:11] before I'll say it again of course right
[2:14:13] now every one of us
[2:14:15] knows exactly what the Lord did in the
[2:14:18] Congo today
[2:14:20] [Music]
[2:14:23] every one of us knows what God did in
[2:14:25] Chile
[2:14:29] today Russia
[2:14:34] Today and you know
[2:14:37] what yeah right here
[2:14:39] today God intended it to be that way God
[2:14:44] comes right down my brother and sister
[2:14:46] look wherever each and every one of you
[2:14:47] are from whether it's a different
[2:14:48] country or a different state or whatever
[2:14:51] a man I want you to just hold this in
[2:14:53] your heart today God come right down and
[2:14:55] many times he's bringing the word to
[2:14:58] pass right in the nucleus of a little
[2:15:00] group of people because that's what they
[2:15:02] need to be lifted up out of their
[2:15:06] circumstance
[2:15:09] strengthened if we only knew some days I
[2:15:11] wished I did honestly if we only knew
[2:15:14] how many healings yeah took place in the
[2:15:17] body of Christ every single day right we
[2:15:21] would be
[2:15:22] astounded now I'm going to give a little
[2:15:24] dig on you can I dig on you a little
[2:15:27] bit God doesn't things in our lives does
[2:15:30] he
[2:15:32] not and often times we don't even share
[2:15:35] it somebody say amen I think every one
[2:15:38] of you'd have to admit God's done
[2:15:40] something for you and and you knew God
[2:15:42] did something for you but nobody else
[2:15:43] knows
[2:15:45] now now I say that for the point God
[2:15:48] promised he would move in the midst of
[2:15:49] his people he's moving he's moving don't
[2:15:54] let the naysayers don't let the
[2:15:56] misunderstandings of the promise what if
[2:15:58] he had looked and said here I'm 75 years
[2:16:00] old and such and such a voice spoke to
[2:16:02] me and said I have a baby by my wife and
[2:16:05] she's 65 years old about 15 20 years
[2:16:07] past
[2:16:09] menopause what would he have
[2:16:11] done huh but I love that word but
[2:16:15] everything in front of it negated but
[2:16:18] what did he do he never paid PA any
[2:16:21] attention to what the Natural Things was
[2:16:25] oh I'm telling you Saints we can get so
[2:16:27] caught up in the Natural Things
[2:16:31] amen he looked at what God said it becom
[2:16:35] such a reality to him till he didn't see
[2:16:37] nothing else but what God Said right he
[2:16:42] left his home he separated himself from
[2:16:44] all unbelief anything that would try to
[2:16:47] pull him away he separated himself so he
[2:16:49] could walk alone now this is interesting
[2:16:51] cuz as the scripture talks about Abraham
[2:16:53] walking alone he had a whole group of
[2:16:55] people with
[2:16:56] him he had a wife he had servants amen
[2:17:00] this is even after lot was gone right so
[2:17:03] when God's talking about walking alone
[2:17:05] my brother and sister we don't need to
[2:17:06] move Grace Tabernacle up to to the
[2:17:08] Wilderness Area amen we got to push out
[2:17:12] any
[2:17:13] voices any voices any
[2:17:16] doubters right
[2:17:22] separate himself from all unbelief
[2:17:24] anything that would try to pull him away
[2:17:25] separate himself so he could walk alone
[2:17:27] that's what every genuine believer has
[2:17:29] to do separate yourself from these
[2:17:31] doubters and unbelievers and walk with
[2:17:34] Christ it's life to you and Abraham did
[2:17:38] such a thing and 25 years later we find
[2:17:40] him still believing the same promise why
[2:17:44] he had focused his mind to the will of
[2:17:47] God by the word of God and believed it
[2:17:51] if we can focus oursel to the plan of
[2:17:54] God to what God wants for us and what
[2:17:56] God promised us and let everything else
[2:17:59] alone no matter how long it is just keep
[2:18:04] believing right that's it
[2:18:08] Hallelujah that's right
[2:18:11] y as we'll close out here I just have to
[2:18:15] go back as the scripture went
[2:18:17] back that vocal outer of the word
[2:18:25] didn't get one drop of that flower
[2:18:27] that's right didn't drop of that
[2:18:30] barley in that day they drank wine as we
[2:18:33] might drink water he didn't get one
[2:18:36] drop
[2:18:37] why because he doubted
[2:18:42] amen but I want you to understand the
[2:18:45] deeper context of this amen every one of
[2:18:48] us faces doubts amen come on let's be
[2:18:52] honest don't let the devil anoint you to
[2:18:54] speak them he could have sat there right
[2:18:57] there by the king and thought in his
[2:19:00] heart
[2:19:01] Lord how could
[2:19:04] this and God would have brought it to
[2:19:06] pass right before his eyes and then he
[2:19:09] would understand God didn't need to open
[2:19:12] the windows of Heaven he commission the
[2:19:15] Syrian Army to bring it to
[2:19:18] them oh Saints amen
[2:19:21] don't let the
[2:19:22] devil anoint you to start speaking the
[2:19:26] ill my marriage is messed up my children
[2:19:30] are messed up I don't even know if I
[2:19:32] have the Holy Ghost I don't know if the
[2:19:33] message is true I don't know if I like
[2:19:35] our pastor I don't know this and I don't
[2:19:37] know that and I wonder about this and I
[2:19:39] wonder about that why don't we be men
[2:19:41] and women enough to be like Abraham and
[2:19:44] just say Lord your word says it my it
[2:19:47] wasn't the pastor my brother and sister
[2:19:49] amen as I told you that day I want to
[2:19:51] drive this home to you I won't keep you
[2:19:53] from the Rapture and I can't put you in
[2:19:55] it some people are like oh no no the
[2:19:57] pastor deceive the people no I'm telling
[2:19:59] you I believe the prophet of God when he
[2:20:01] said you cannot be deceived so the Holy
[2:20:04] Ghost will come down and deal with your
[2:20:06] heart and say is that on the word or
[2:20:10] not and I trust my God so much if he
[2:20:14] says that's not the word then I say okay
[2:20:16] that's not the word I'm not going to go
[2:20:18] reason with it and find an explanation
[2:20:20] for it amen hallelujah oh I got to stop
