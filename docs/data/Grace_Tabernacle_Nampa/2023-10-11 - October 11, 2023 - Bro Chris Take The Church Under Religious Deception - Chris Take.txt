Lord father may your word just come alive to us we ask we commit our pastor again into your hands in this situation Lord we love you we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you brother Alex the musicians beautiful time tonight it's good to be back here in the house of God with each one of you if you have your Bibles tonight which I hope you do came to church hopefully you brought your Bible and you didn't borrow one at the back door A B borrowed you never know the condition of a borrowed sword Galatians chapter one Galatians chapter 1 verse one nice to have my sister Melody with us tonight Galatians chapter 1 verse one says Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead and all the Brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia Grace be to you and peace from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father to him be glory forever and ever amen I like how Paul opens his letter and he puts he puts the focus on God puts the Focus On Christ you know in in our in our song and our worship and our prayer we should always be mindful to lift him up it's not all about us amen verse six I Marvel not that you are so soon removed I excuse me I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ onto another gospel so the devil has a gospel the Antichrist has a gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ remember the the devil can't create amen but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto to you let him be ACC cursed as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you that you have received let him be a cursed I don't know of any other spot in the Bible where back to back the same exact words are repeated in other words this is really really important Paul has has brought the word let's just Paul has brought the word to the Galatians he's preached to them now he's writing to them okay so he you don't write a letter to somebody per se you never met you meet them you form a relationship then you text or you call in our world their world they write a letter so Paul's already preached to them he's already laid it out for them and now he's writing to them and he's saying what in the world has happened you are so quickly removed he says for I for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated tonight so Paul is is saying here feels weird not taking my jacket off but we've had some technical difficulties so it's going to be on tonight he says did I did I come did I come to please men and he says if I came to please men then then I'm not the servant of Christ you see the conflict the conflict that we face as as as sons and knowledge of God so I'd like to take tonight for title and and um I tried to clear it up with the guys at the back last time I preached the title that they used was going to be my title but then God had me not preach that so now I'm preaching it so this is the the right title for this service we got to fix that one my title tonight is the church under religious deception I'd like to to you know Lord have his Liberty and the next few weeks or whatever I would love to have a some more time to go into this I just been in this vein now for about a few weeks and and would just feeling led to bring this out and so there's a lot in here and um I I know we're not going to get to all of it tonight 1 John chapter 4 1 John chapter 4 verse one so for context in Galatians Paul says I'm surprised I Marvel that you are so soon removed from the gospel that and he says another gospel has been preached to you a perverted gospel of Christ and he says if it's different than what I've said don't perceive it even if it comes from an angel okay so you see we're not we're not called to determine God's word based on who's delivering it that's right we are called to base God's the truth on God's word that's why we have it that's why protected this book for thousands of years is this right here even Paul you know I was reading reading uh well I'm not going to get a sidet track 1 John 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world okay so so should so now should we all be afraid and skeptical you know I think a little bit of SK skepticism a little dose would be good for some of us yes but we're not called to be pessimistic or skeptical in general but we're called to try everything by the word of God it's got to go through the word of God now I'm laying a foundation here for an example we're going to take from the scriptures so pay close attention says because many false prophets are gone out into the world we don't need to go fear we have the truth doesn't match the truth right when you see to know about the real dollar hereby there's hundreds and thousands of dollars there's only one real dollar if you know the real dollar you'll know the false dollar amen hereby know ye that the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth so he's like he's identifying John is identifying the spirit of God he says it's every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard heard that it should come and even now already it is in the world you have to remember the word of God is alive and breathing so when you read the scriptures it is present amen okay so presently this is where we are amen he says you are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you so he brings some scary stuff and then he backs it up with don't fear do not fear you have overcome them you have already overcome them amen because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he's better be in you though they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of God he that knoweth God heareth he we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us amen he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error so there's two Spirits all right now over into Jude Jude we'll start in verse one I'm I'm flying this this reading by the leading of the I'm taking this reading by the leading of the of the Holy Spirit I'm not sure where we'll stop I'd love to read the whole thing so we might end up doing that he says Jude Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when I gave all the diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints so once delivered unto the Saints so there's something happening who Jude is writing to there's a battle happening there's a conflict happening and and something is is is is is seeping into the church something has come into the church and he's saying look he says go back to the the faith that was delivered to you he's echoing Paul he's echoing Paul saying go back to what you have heard the original truth go back to that take what you've heard and run it through the filter he says for there are certain men crept in unawares so we got concerned and we get concerned when suddenly somebody surprises us when they manifest Antichrist Spirit but it's scriptural that that Spirit comes in unawares am that's right because now we're going to be surprised people are going to surprise us till the day we lead this Earth but we got to remember that this is part of the process and if you're anchored in the word of God because it's it's it's deception it's deception it's not supposed to be obvious amen if it was obvious look look people are all not everybody but in general kind of worked up about voice of God and the message that they're preaching that's not the razer's edge brother B talks about to be so close who would deceive the very elect if it was possible he said it would be like a Razor's Edge we all know the the message that they preach that brother brandham is their absolute and the tapes that's really far out there that is not close to the truth at all that's right we understand that and if we're not careful we look at that the devil has always got something that's far out there to distract us way out there says wow you know for years we preached against the denominations brother man I'm already dealt with that they're out there we're here and while we're preaching out against somebody else beyond our walls inside our walls we have we have certain men crept in unawareness because we're too focused on well that well that's look that's obvious right it is not obvious that spirit that is so close the Antichrist Spirit that's so close is not obvious if you are not a student of the word of God if you are not focused and feeding on the faith which was once delivered unto you it's not obvious but you but get in the word of God you see can't you can't just come to church it's it's fun girl boyfriend girlfriend relationship people all over the message have a boyfriend girlfriend relationship with Christ all the good feels that's right all the good feels zero responsibility the okay there's been a lot that I've been studying and and and thinking about and so I'm trying to I pray God keep Lord keep me focused on the thought tonight he says okay so he says who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ now you have to remember he he's Jude is calling this Spirit out but the spirit when it's working is not walking up to you and saying I don't believe God is God that's right the spirit is preaching that's right Jude underneath the anointing of the holy spirit is calling it out for what it is he's calling out saying hey look they're denying God they're denying the Lord Jesus Christ but that Spirit of deception is working in the church it looks like your brother it looks like your sister that's right okay it's clothed in religion that's right that's why the title tonight is religious deception I will therefore put you in remembrance amen you know what have you ever thought about the fact that to P we've been put into the into remembrance we've been put in remembrance of the original word that's right and what are we do when we take communion that's right we're doing it in remembrance you see Israel put this pillar here it's a thing to remember amen why because time goes on and with time memories fade God doesn't God doesn't forget he forgets your sin but he doesn't forget he remembers everything he's Eternal all things are are are the same for him it's one big canvas but we are time we are creatures of time so if we don't write it down if we don't put a thing put a pen or put a put a Mark or a a bookmark or we forget we don't take a picture if we don't write it in our Journal that memory Fades with time now God uses time and so does the devil over time the devil tells a lie and it starts off a little bit here a little bit there but the longer you hear that lie the more you accept it as truth that's right so it's deception it's it's it's okay and the angels which kept not excuse me you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved an everlasting chains under Darkness until the day of the great Judgment of the great day okay praise the Lord we're going to stop there in June maybe we'll come back um in the everpresent water from the rock we know that Israel has always been a historical example so we've laid a bit of a foundation in the scriptures where Jude Paul they're addressing and John addressing this Spirit of deception in the church now I want to I I want to take and we're going to step over and we're going to look at how Israel types the church he says we know that Israel has always been a historical example of the church because Israel was the people of God until they came out of Egypt then they were the Church of God because they were separated from the rest of the world and when we are separated from the rest of the world then we become the church now remember I'm laying a foundation Romans 9:6-7 not as though the word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel so Israel types the church and Paul tells the Romans look not everybody that's Israel is Israel that's right then he says neither because they are are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called so Isaac is a type of Christ so now we have a separation here we have the church which is the called out people but inside the church is the seed of Isaac that's right okay because not all church is seed that's right amen so in this day the scripture is fulfilled so the church really is in birth pains tonight again for the Deliverance of the Son of God to come again that's right all of our theologians all of our systems all of our denominations has rotted right out from under us so we are in birth pains and the message from God always through throws the church in heavier pains but after a while now watch carefully what he says here he says after a while she who she the church is going to be delivered of a bride that'll bring forth Jesus Christ amen to his bride amen all right so there's a bride in the church that's right and who is the church the church is Israel not the Baptist not the denomination it's the church what we what we call the message Church okay so not all messages seed that's right now we only bring that up because it's important to know the two Spirits operating in the framework of the church that's right amen the only way to know is you got to know the book The Seed is not air with the shook I listen just listen to this sermon and uh I'm up in the attic cuz I'm remodeling my house crammed in the Attic no place to dance because it's just every time God reveals something to you let me tell you this when God reveals something to you gives you a nugget you know what you should do take that and run it back through everything you've already heard because you'll hear it differently that's right he says in he says Church natural Church spiritual spiritual there is a church natural that these women here type and there's a church spiritual also so the natural church and the spiritual church cannot be heirs together why wrong seed that's right they are two different separate times you've got the wheat and you've got the tears amen okay do they come from two totally different branches that's right they are two different separate times two different separate peoples under two different separate covenants he says that's why the Rapture is different and will only be for the Royal Seed of Abraham it cannot come by the natural carnal seed of the say it for me church church amen so the seat of the church the church doctrine is not enough amen it's not going to change your life it's going to conform you Amen to a culture that's right that's right you are going to be in love with God but it's a fio it's a boyfriend girlfriend that's right amen and in the Church of God there'll be no fornication so guess what you're not H receiving any seed that's right exactly right when me and my wife met each other I mean we okay we're we are deeply in love but it was different when we were just boyfriend girlfriend when we were recording it was all the happy feels you know and that's what happens people try to they think that's it so then when they get married and that's not there anymore they think they've lost love for one another that's right but that is just the very beginning it's the attraction okay so so real quick real quick not to deviate too far what is the attraction at the what's the what is our goal our goal is Christ our goal is adoption that's right we will not lead this Earth till we are adopted because why do we need to write checks in in glory we need to write checks here amen that's right okay so adoption is not coming when we go on the Rapture adoption is not coming on side adoption happens here Amen in the promised land okay so what is the base adoption is the statue of a perfect man brother Bram says and he when he preaches that sermon the statute of perfect man he says this is the perfect bridge between the church ages and the Seven Seals why go back and listen to it anyways what's the very first what's the base of the pyramid Faith amen all the good feels all the good supernatural things all of that Miracles and everything that happens in that first Foundation which is faith that is exciting it's exciting to see someone's broken arm go straight and healed again but that act doesn't save the person or you amen it just attracts you Amen to the truth because because where God is there's going to be that kind of stuff so what has happened we have put all the focus on the foundation amen why because we can see it with our eyes and we can feel it with our flesh Amen brother bandam says more than one place you cannot contact god with your five senses that's right you have to contact god with faith amen but that's just the beginning because what is perfection Divine love amen 1 Corinthians 13 Paul tells the Corinthians hope faith hope love or charity above all this charity amen so love agapo love is greater than Faith amen but what do we do we talk about faith faith faith that's just the beginning amen that is just just the foundation to then step to what oh virtue that's right patience knowledge but you will never step up until you receive the responsibility of being his wife amen but that's hard to do because you have to surrender your will you have to surrender your desires young ladies who aren't married when you get married to your husband you now do his will if he's a good man his will will line up exactly with your heart if he's a bad man but hopefully you don't ever that you're not married you find the bad ones and you walk away from them but your will is wrapped up in him why that's why God that's why the devil attacks that right there so hard in the society today so he says Church natural Church spiritual so you have to contact God so I asked I asked I'm going to ask you this question maybe I'll give you the answer maybe I'll just let you chew on it describe to me the power of God moving on a person describe to me the power of God falling in a church service okay just chew on that one why am why I'm against organized religion he says that's the reason I have spoke against the church okay the holy spirit's holding me back the answer to that statement you can't that's right because the real manifestation of the spirit of God you can't see with your eyes that's right you see the blessings you see outward emotions but you can't use that to gauge God moving because music will touch your spirit spirit and will move you without Christ that's right a man's words will touch you in spirit and move you without Christ that's right but what are the fruits you're bearing amen that that's it is the question that is The Testament so you can't look at somebody in a church service who's weeping laid on the floor and say God touched them God changed them you can't do that you have to wait and watch brother B says why is SE not Arrow to shook he said they couldn't wait for God to come so they manifested that he says they committed adultery go listen back to the tape but I don't want to get off off on that but I just needed to slide that in there the Holy Spirit wanted to slide that in there that's the reason okay now I want to identify this separation here between the church because you still hear sometimes the question of of and this is just for for you know we're all coming along in our spiritual journey so maybe this is something you already know maybe it's not but this is just to really lay that foundation in strongly that the church is the message okay he says in why am I why I'm against organized religion 1962 he says that's the reason I have spoke against the church the lodge I can't call it a church there's only one church that's the Church of the body of Christ but these lodges that's called Church my Bible tells me that they are Blasphemous names all of them all organizations what are they blaspheming blasphemy is to be contrary to or speak against When God says come be born and they say come join when baptism of the spirit is falsely took over for a wafer in the Catholic Church a handshake in the Protestant church and an emotion in the Pentecostal church instead of the person of Christ coming in with all that P pyramid building we had the other day Okay so there are the lodge okay established does God change his mind 1965 he says here would be a type of the natural and spiritual meeting when when the natural and spiritual meet there's always a collision you want to find where the spirit of God is is running against the Antichrist Spirit look for the turmoil in the church that's right look where people get all heated up about it now getting heated up about it is a is you know you can be be angry and sin not okay I'll leave it there but you saw you see people in that Clash I don't even have to say it you know that Collision is the natural and the spiritual meeting amen because they run right head on into each other I want to represent it as the spiritual church Israel here I would I want to represent it as a spiritual church so he says Israel is a spiritual church he says and Moab is the natural church just the church what we call Church natural we're all sure that there is a church and there is a bride coming out of that church we know that is true and they Clash here so when he says Spiritual Church he's referring to the bride amen and we know and we notice that when they clashed here it come under something that I would like to speak a moment on as soon as they clashed and one seen what the other other one was doing there was a great impersonation that's right one of the other so catch from this impersonation remember I'm still lay the foundation so I hope that we're you're staying with me and that's where we find it today that we we do get too much impersonations and when you do that you're always in trouble you but you but pause right there you cannot impersonate the real thing that's right the thing that changes your life you can't you can't be impersonated because you would have to go then the rest of your life bearing the fruits of the spirit of Christ without the spirit of Christ that's right and you can't do that because the fruit you have the seed of the fruit you have every that's what brother B labored that every seed will bring forth of its kind an apple tree cannot that's right be a peach tree that's right you cannot be like Christ amen and you can't not be like Christ if the spirit of the seed of Christ is in you right now I water you water we got a we have a peach tree a plum tree an apple tree and Cherry they all get the same water they all get the same water they all have the same dirt they all have the same Sun do you see that's the Testament that's how I know this is a CH tree how do I know it's a oh I can look at the leaves and I can study the leaves and sure leaves are actually a fruit too but I can look at that and and and yes but then when the fruit pushes out there is no doubts amen so when the wind blows there's no fruit on the trees and the wind blows and the leaves praise God can I tell what's what no no so we have we have taken something that we want to see that's it we want to feel that's it but there says they jumped they couldn't sit and wait for God that's right he says so they jumped forward that's the and he says they committed adultery amen this isn't the Baptist Churches this is the message church now you're going to go off and say oh brother Chris is preaching against this church and brother Chris is preaching against that church I am not at all because guess what I will run the brother David's ran the aisles why what was it the word amen burned something inside of your heart amen so you'll express sometimes exactly like the the person that lays out in the spirit EXA but what is the fruits that's it that's it so therefore if you're bearing the fruit of Christ you're feeding on that's right Christ that's right amen absolutely right that's it okay so the natural spiritual church he says a spiritual church is Israel Moab is a natural Church in this context that he's taking and we're all sure that there was a church and there was a bride coming out of that church we know that is true and they Clash here and we notice that when they clashed here it come under something that I would like to speak a moment on as soon as they clashed okay okay I already read all this and when you that we do we do get too much impersonations and when you do that you're always in trouble you cannot live the other fellow's life that's right we cannot impersonate something we must be just what we are amen if this fellow does something because he does it you think you have to too he says you don't do that you're an individual to God and we mustn't try to impersonate each other amen now the condition of the children of Israel during the books of the Kings is exactly the condition of the last day church that's exactly right that's right you go and you look at the very beginning where did it all start we want a king like the world okay so if the if the church if Israel is the church who are the kings that's right the leadership that's right Church leadership that's right but you you have to have them the God told Elijah I have what was it like 10,000 who refuse to Bow the knee to Baal yet Elijah is like I'm the only one all through those books when you read of the the terrible wickedness of Israel there was people serving God so but you had to have them to carry because the shock carries the seed the seed has to have the Shu we have to have the people who are impersonators amen we have to but one day that seed will come out that's it we don't want to be the impersonators that's okay now let's jump into what we want to talk about in First Kings chapter 11 now we had Saul then God picked a king and we had David and then Solomon comes up after David First Kings 11 verse4 and it came to pass for it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods brother bam says a couple of different places the church can turn the pastor's heart from God that's right so you have a responsibility just as much as our pastor and the ministry here has you have a resp responsibility to yield yourself to the holy spirit amen to surrender to Christ and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David his father for Solomon went after asaroth the goddess of the zidonians and after milom the abomination of the ammonites and Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord and went not fully after the Lord as did David his father then did Solomon build an high place for chimos and the the Abomination of Moab in the hill that is before Jerusalem and for mik the abomination of the children of Ammon mik whole thing centered around the sacrific sacrificing of infants and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods and the Lord was angry with Solon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared unto him twice now there's a pattern here you'll notice Solomon was called of God blessed of God with wisdom but that doesn't matter that's it amen if Solomon turns from the word amen you don't follow Solomon that's it Paul said whether they be an angel that's it or anybody else so in other words what is our Compass it's the word of God that's right so why and this this this just gets me on my pedestal never mind I'm not going to go there because that's me we want to talk about God and the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared unto him twice and he commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the Lord commanded so he knew full well what he was doing that's right but he was under deception because of the women he married the choices that he made wherefore the the what he allowed you see he allowed Lord help us help us in our families help us in our church that's right that's right to always stand with Joshua as for me in my house we will serve the Lord amen okay so now for sake of time God raises up adversaries to Solomon be because of this departure from the word and he he raises up Hadi the Edomite and he raises up I think it's well there's somebody somebody else and then he raises up jeroboam now watch the story of where jeroboam starts verse 26 and jeroboam the son nebat that an ephrathite of zerada Solomon's servant whose mother's name was Zera a wi widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the king and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the King Solomon bu built Milow and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of Valor and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the House of Joseph and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of Jerusalem you know it fascinates me that it was the house of Joseph because Joseph is the type of Christ and it came to pass after at that time when jeroboam went out of Jerusalem that the prophet ahaja the shilonite found him in the way and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field and thei caught the new garment that was on him and rinse it in 12 pieces and he said to jeroboam take the 10 pieces for thus saith the Lord the god of Israel behold I will Ren the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give 10 tribes to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake so there's already One Tribe that has been removed for Jerusalem's sake the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel okay so jeroboam now he's in his position he's going to be a ruler of the C City and then the prophet comes and prophesies over Jobo Solomon finds out so Solomon sets out to kill him and Jobo escapes to Egypt then Solomon dies rabol becomes king all of Israel knows the story of jobal knows that jobal was anointed king anointed by the prophet had the prophecy over him so they get jeroboam they say look jeroboam Solomon's dead come and it says let me find it here because it's important and it came to pass okay this is 12:3 that they sent and called him so they called jeroboam and jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spake unto riab so he's already leading at that point Israel is looking to him why because he has the backing of God Solomon didn't Israel knew Solomon departed and that that there this whole thing happened this whole transition and conflict of leadership happened before the eyes of Israel they understand what's going on now rabo comes up and jeroboam they get Jer B Jer B comes and addresses the age-old question since the dawn of time are you going to lower taxes it's still an argument today RI Bal to jump ahead for time says you thought my dad was bad wait till you see the taxes I have for you so Jobo the Israel said says all it says Israel to your tents and the kingdom splits rabom jerbo have some conflict and go back and forth then ger bone begins to prosper why because he's doing the will of God God prophesied over him he's fulfilling a prophecy on his own life and on the life of Solomon because God said Solomon you did this so this is Judgment so jerob balam anointed call of God hope you're catching where we're going with this and and and so he begins to prosper and he looks at Israel and he says now shall the kingdom return to the House of David this is in 12: 26-33 if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto riab king of Judah so he gets afraid what is he doing he is disbelieving the word of God that is sin unbelief is sin definition of sin is unbelief so he's disbelieving this portion this word of God and he says you know what I'm going to do something now let's pause right here and I'm going to read read from the church age book in the Ephesian Church age but br's talking about the nicians now I want to I want you to pay attention here we we put this off and we say the nians I understand it's Wednesday night and we're we're we're only been up here 45 minutes so we're good he says he says fean Church age he says what are these nians the word comes from two Greek words niiko which means means to conquer and Laos which means the Le in plain fact somebody was doing something in that early church that was Conquering the Ley if the Ley were being conquered then there must have been some Authority there doing it so leadership what was it that God hated that was happening in that church what was going on then is now going on today is exactly what the word nickan means the people were being subjected somehow in a way that was absolutely contrary to to the word of God now to get the real meaning of what we are about to go into I must caution you ever keep in mind that religion spiritual matters if you like is composed of two parts now two parts again he says that entwine but are as opposite as black and white religion and the spiritual world are made of these two trees which have their roots in Eden Tree of Life the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so in the midst of the the garden he says thus in the Ephesian church is is the same is that same Paradox the church is made up of good and bad two Vines true and false okay he will call them the church and only the elect will really know which is the true Spirit only the elect will not be deceived he said and he reades scripture in Matthew he says so way back there in in the early church the false Vine got to intertwine itself around the True Vine and we find these Deeds of the nians and that spirit is going to be found fighting the True Vine until it is destroyed by God okay now I know that was a bit of a of a read there but I wanted to bring in that portion of the quote there where bam talks about nanism so these are men who are in leading leadership positions anointed you cannot question they that they are anointed of God you cannot question that they were called of God that's right but Paul Bel the point only take the word amen amen why does religious deception in the church happen because we disregard the word that's right amen that's right that is our holding Point that's right not a man not a not not a not a worship service look if you if you if we could take and strip away I'm going to hold off there like I said I've been studying a lot I'm trying to keep that for a different time the Lord wants it for so Jobo he's in this position nobody can question job's position but something is about to happen that's going to cause Israel to fall clear down that's right to where they are today amen and it actually didn't start with Jobo it started with Moab and the east of bpor Amen a spirit was introduced amen and fought Israel all the way through exactly right and where did that Spirit come from the days of Pentecost Israel was at the River Jordan we had you have Egypt the desert Fe ofel poror and you have the Jordan River that's right you have Luther Wesley Pentecost yes sir then you have justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you cross Jordan so right in that season of time right in the season of Pentecost what happens the Feast of bpor causes Israel to turn and what was the big thing that caused them to turn the music amen that's exactly the music caus you go back and you look in the history of Music a lot of the music that we call rock and roll today started in the Pentecostal church amen that's right yes sir why was it was a departure from the word of God okay like I said another thing another time well so that's why we are today in the promised land we're pursuing Perfection we're pursuing unto adoption we can't stop at the foundation so now Jobo makes this departure and he says you know what I I'm afraid that if the people go down to Israel down to Jerusalem to worship they're going to stop following me and go after riam so now you have two churches fighting against each other you've got Ria Bam's church and you have job Bam's Church two sides of the fence and R B said jar B says I'm going to model my church after the truth but I'm going to build statues to bail you see all the way through it was always back to bail back to bail so he set he he he literally sets up one of the high places in bethl amen which is what the house of God that's right ephra and he puts the other one in Dan and that caused Dan's names to be blotted from the book why idolatry so anytime you take a man's word over the word of God you are committing idolatry I don't care how good the atmosphere feels that's exactly right because if I I judged my life on the atmosphere that's it there's a lot of dead churches that's right amen there's a lot of dead Christians that's right and that's if you get too focused that way that's what you start to say and if you get too focused on the other side you look at anybody who manifests any emotion you say oh that's of the devil brother brandham constantly does both sides amen I told myself I wasn't going to go there this service but the point is the deception happened when the children of Israel said but he's a man of God so they took his word over Gods that's it do you see it do you see how close it is it's a Razor's Edge because they're are men of God but they took the word into their hands and went this way now that Spirit goes out there and goes far enough down through time everyone says oh yes it's obvious but when it happens that's it when it happens if you're not close with God that's it you get caught up in a movement that's it when a preacher starts to preach to support his movement that's it that's a departure from the word of God can God bring them back around absolutely and he does constantly is that to me I got too far one way and too far this way and God brings me right back right right because it's God we're here I'm here to point you to God that way if I come back in two months and say I was wrong you say that's okay we're we're focused on God anyways amen and if if Israel knew the word like they should have amen when jeroboam said look this is what we're going to do though it looked like the real thing they wouldn't have received it and some of them didn't some of them didn't God always has his seed on the earth to testify that's right amen and you watch those those those those things that they worshiped was mik and chimo mik is the worshiped by sacrificing children those are the ones who suffer that's it whole you know people who have been been in the church for years and and and they're they've gotten on in their Years or or or they or they don't have to be old they can just be not not children anymore you just keep doing the same thing you know when you hit a certain age as an adult you just you're okay with doing the same thing every day makes you happy when you're a kid you're like no way man this is boring I'm never going to be like that and then 15 years later there you are and so it's the children who suffer that's right watch you want to know what a if a spirit of the Church of a church is correct look at the children amen and the women amen okay that is so mik right departure from the word of God we see immediately the sacrifice of children the next one is chimos which which means subduer or Bor subduer to bring under control amen the spirit of controlling the people if you don't act like this you don't have it that's it if you act like this you don't have it what is that that's control that's it that's right if you don't wear this now we preach modesty absolutely absolutely but you start to get real weird and Technical about it your control if you have you never know how far to go sometimes oh if man could completely remove himself what God could say that's it so jobal caused Israel to sin a great sin but Israel accepted that sin in the Seven Seals you know what I did I totally did not mark my spot there it is so he reads about Jobo built sheim in Mount infim and and uh and he builds these these these Idol worships and the Groves and the high places he sets these up so brother bam reads this in the seventh seal and then he says this he says see Ephraim and bethl at bethl and Dan they set up idols and these people went out there to worship these idols and here we are plumbed down into the Millennium age almost and God still remembered that sin that's right they're not even counted in there that's right amen glory just as sure as he remembers every good promise you see he says amen glory you're thinking well that's really depressing what you just said but what is see a real child of God sees that and says wow praise God because you know you're on the opposite side of that and there's nothing you can do to remove your cuz you are you are married to the promise he said just as sure as he remembers every good promise he remembers every evil one too just remember that's the reason I believe friends I've always tried to stay with that word no matter how strange it seems that's it the Pinnacle of Paul's Ministry was his rejection what what what when Paul died where were his friends he was alone bring me my coat and my book that's it he died per se with a pen in his hand and nobody there oh maybe he had one friend but he didn't have this great big Ministry he didn't have all these people around him Paul died alone but you see we are afraid of being alone that's it there you are we're afraid of being weird that's it I'm not talking about to the world we have enough big enough community in the message where we have a world to but but we're afraid to be weird at at camps we're afraid to be weird when we go visit people or or in the church itself because what if calls you to a this is the whole point tonight God I want go I want the message to come across tonight that God is calling us to a higher Place let's step it up amen step up the game we're done with status quo are you ready to surrender are you ready to give it up amen I'm talking about the things that the message Believers amen say are okay amen I'm not going to get technical about different things the other I'm talking about are you consecrating your life that's it I had I I'm going to preach this tonight I had a moment in my office and I said God I'm ready to go all the way amen God has dealt me with and I'm going to be very blunt tonight God has dealt with me point blank on music amen and it was a hard part to walk I repented to my family you know what I Repent to you praise the Lord that's good the Lord because and there's and Lord willing you know what if the pastor allows it maybe we'll we'll we'll talk about that sometime amen but I and I'm just going to testify I have for the last few months because God pushes you to positions when he's ready for you to move higher okay God pushes you into a position a place where things are a certain way right there's no more fluff in the nest because he wants you to look around and say something's not right says he wants to call you higher up amen so we want to provoke unto good works go up with your position I started to deal with a temper I haven't dealt with since I was a little kid when I was a little kid I went up to my dad CU I heard brother bam say it and I told my dad I got a temper that can fight a buz saw trying to make a joke he looked at me he says you need to pray God delivers you from that amen and I did and God took it from me now remember a temper is part of humanity God gives you the ability to control it he doesn't take it from you be too easy well that in the past few months flared up and I was having I was having terrible points of Rage with people with my wife my kids I mean I would C I would catch it I would just be I would be feel terrible would repent to them and say guys I'm sorry I went for prayer felt led to go for prayer and I said I believe that's that's going to go away and everything and I'm just dealing with this confronting this every day God I need this can't be I can't get up there and preach and then walk off the platform and yell and scream at my family that is not the spirit of Christ that's right God and then God confronted me with the music we've been listening to I removed it from my life and guess what that temper is gone praise the Lord that the anointing of that Christian music was stirring up attention inside of my spirit because I am a child of Godly so what spirit is inside of me the spirit of Christ and that if I'm feeding the spirit of the flesh that's right the spirit of the flesh is going to rain that's it that's it that's exactly right so now I will listen to what I would have called before old people music praise the Lord but you know what God's always right here amen and I I was struggling God why aren't you right here anymore what's wrong why are you not right here because I was anointing myself with the wrong Spirit that's right because when if you're musician you guess what you do you listen to music all the time all the time and my started me and my wife both my wife just started to be tired of our music what's we don't like this anymore what's wrong we're not enjoying this this is we need new music or something what's going on and I look it wasn't you know it wasn't here's the crazy part it wasn't what people would call Rocky music per se it was it's it was the AC it's the accepted music of the message it's the accepted music you see people singing from the platform that's right but God showed me the spirit behind that that's why I said what I said about Pentecost back in the day you go and look at some of the modern rock and roll beats and music came from the Pentecostal Church yes sir well where did the Feast of B pure happen that's it right around the season of Pentecost okay so the pastor is away but that is from Brother Chris's heart that is my testimony amen you just receive what you want and God will take care of everything that's good but I had to just share that with you so I want to just hit this real quick in closing the re the reason Israel followed jobal is because they had institutionalized the gospel that's it institutionalized by definition isn't established in practice or custom established as part of an official organization and it when it's of a person an institutionalized person that person is apathetic and dependent after a long period in an institution that's exactly right I'm here tonight to say that we have God forgive us we have institutionalized that's it the message of the hour right we have created a culture and a custom that's it around what we call the message and you know what happens when someone is institutionalized they become apathetic do you know what the definition of apathetic is showing or feeling no interest that's it enthusiasm or concern amen enthusiasm is not this enthusiasm is a passion that's right that pushes when it's raining when it's cloudy when you're tired pushes through because you have an enthusiasm for the word of God amen amen exactly an interest is not I want to play the piano I want to sing a song that is not that is part of the institution because you want to be accepted by the club that's it that's good but in order for you to take the next step up in the Statue of a perfect man to come come unto adoption you have to walk that road alone it is you and God exactly right and that is it no church will carry you there we won't even carry you there I'm not going to get up here and tell you you're a Son of God you're a Son of God you're a Son of God no I want you to find that out for yourself amen amen that's if we get up here and we preach now it's going to sound like I'm preaching against people but I am not no sir I'm preaching against the spirit if we get up and we just preach how perfect you are and how you're the bride of Christ you will never do anything to change your position amen because the preacher told you who you are I want God to tell you who you are I want God to meet you somewhere and say look Gabriella I'm Christ and you say oh I see you now because in that moment you can't describe it amen well this happened and you'll describe but you can't tell me exactly what happened that's exactly you just know you started to change something in your life demanded more time with God Amen why it was a spirit of God but if I give you the the the description and the visual of what the power of God moving in your life is you will manufacture it yes sir that's exactly right yes sir and then what is it idolatry that's exactly what those you do it in the name of God though you do it in the Name of Christ so Lord help us not to try to describe it that's exactly let us preach a gospel amen the gospel of Liberty amen the gospel of Christ where you can find Christ if I get up here and I preach my opinion to support my position you receive no Christ that's it though it's coded in the message if I get up here and I preach to you message taglines and I tell you how you're the bride and how you're going to overcome but I don't give you any word to overcome with that's right I have failed you oh you will be excited that's it if I started to tell Gideon bro you're ripped you're strong you're buff and he wasn't you know how weird that would be he goes around thinking he's something guess what he'll stop doing he won't lift weights he won't go to the gym because he's already made it you see what happens when we just preach you to a position you have not yet attained that's it then you walk away you walk out of the camp beating you walk away from church you walk away from meetings thinking you've arrived that's exactly right and you haven't amen so let us preach the gospel of Christ that is our duty that's right that is our mission and that should be your mission too God where are you that's what Gideon said Gideon said where be all the Miracles in other words not broken arms healed no where be the manifestation that's it of God because he says that's where I'll find God that's it where is God Amen if you have some kind of mental conception of who and what God looks like you've missed the point if you have a mental idea of of what the of a good worship service looks like or a good preaching service looks like you have missed the point amen you shouldn't be looking to the person next to you to see how you should react to the word that's it that's just what brother baram said not to do don't impersonate somebody so what can we do then the best thing I ever heard from a man of God who was mentoring me in my Ministry he says you can tell the people what's wrong but don't leave them there that's what's wrong but there's always always a solution to a word problem what can we do then Christ is the mystery of God reveal I love it when you ask somebody a question and they respond with a quote in scripture yes sir look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation life something when I was in Ohio I just had God provided such a good opportunities I I only actually only preached four services but God provided such an opportunity for me to fellowship and take in other services and really spoke with my heart and he just sealed this you know you hear something over and over again you think you know it but then you catch a revelation of it that's you can have an intellectual knowledge sir of the Revelation do you know what that means you know how to describe it that's it but you don't know it that's it that's exactly you know the seals you can talk about them but you don't know Christ right do you realize how deceptive that is that's when someone has a knowledge of the Revelation but not actually the Revelation that's it that's right he says Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the Revelation not the knowledge the life of the Revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation amen Christ in the Bible and I know this is not this is a very familiar quote Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ you say brother Chris that's not what we asked we asked what can we do are you listening Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you that's it makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing that's it see what God is trying to to do that is what you need to do that is how you overcome the religious deception in the church Christ in you he says what is the new birth then he'd say well brother brandom what is the new birth ask somebody to describe that to you too say tell me what happens what does the person do how do I know a true Son of God always will respond with well it's the fruits they bear line with the word of God they do the word of God they say Amen to the word of God absolutely but if we're not careful we major on an outward expression that's the danger of it you can you can believe it the right way but are you expressing that to the world am or are you caught up in looking like your brother or caught up in being part of a group look the scripture says the tears and the wheat have to be separated amen that is in the message churches so don't look for that conflict to end that's it it won't that's right don't pick sides no that's right pick the middle of the road that's right the razor's Edge Walk The Edge you ever see a tight rope Walker Oh is he here's here's this TI Rob Walker you know he uses to balance both sides amen amen he holds a long pole that's weighted and it both sides B bow down and push him so he's centered and he walks that's right we have to have the Fanatics and we have to have the dead stale bread you have to because there would be no middle otherwise so don't get over here because if you get over here and if you look this way and start to point your finger at them you lose balance and fall that way amen if you turn this way and start to point at them you lose balance and fall that way amen but if you say I'm going to focus on Christ amen that's it then you you walk the line you get to the other side do you do you realize this is this actually frees you up this lifts a burden off your shoulders amen that's exactly because you don't have to worry about it now amen you just say well I'm going to know what the real dollar looks like don't just take my word for it take it and run it through the scriptures run it through the message that's right that's right please amen do that amen some preachers are scared of that that's right well that's because they're preaching their opinion that's it what is the new birth then you say it is revelation of Jesus Christ personally to to you amen amen see not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you set a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ amen that's it Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you amen that is the Revelation that the church was built upon amen amen you say I need victory in my life that's it go back to the book that's it your name's written there anyways amen that seven seal book of redemption is none other than the scriptures that's it this is your book of redemption and your name is written there amen have you found it yet yes sir Revelations 10:8 in closing and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and shout and dance about no go and sit quietly in the corner no go and and take the little book that's it which was open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey so it tastes really really good but then when you live it it's really bitter that's it why because it's hard if it can't be easy you know and I know we've been long but I can tell I know we've been long so you just allow me to say a couple things Church shouldn't be so easy now I have to Define that because there's always there's got to be something that's pushing you up that's got to be something that's that's moving in your spirit something that that's calling you higher up if we've all just found this place where we're happy and we're in agreement that's right that's what are we agreeing on that's good are we agreeing on the word because if we're agreeing on the word guess what we're going to have iron sharpening iron we're going to have conversation we're going to have Fellowship around the word of God but if we've all just accepted a a culture that's what I mean by easy if we all just accept a culture I'm talking about Grace Tabernacle if we all just accept a culture this is how it is and we don't check the word that's it right there it is that's good we will depart that's exactly right I'm not saying something is wrong no sir you're right not at all exactly but apathy comes from when we become accepted exact in a culture that's exactly right we call Public Schools institutions for a reason everybody has to find their group they fit in and then that that's it that's high school that that's in the church okay and we have to constantly push against it the word has to be applied to every individual amen amen I don't care who they are amen the word is the word amen go home and make sure brother Chris Brother David brother the Paul that's it the trustees the deacons that's it make sure it all lines up with the word of God right that's

they are we picked them based on the word of God that's exactly right that is where we find our balance we won't find it outside of that everything will just be a club that's it you know what a club
