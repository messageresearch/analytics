special for us want you come sister beth sing for us [Music] there lived a man and a woman in a town called tuna they made a hole for elisha and found favor in his eyes so god sent them a miracle the only thing they longed for within a year they would hold the sun as elijah prophesied one day they ran from the field brought the child to his mother she held his head there on her knees till he died i knew that day she didn't tell anyone she ran straight to the man of god and if anybody asked her she replied along the way it is well it is [Music] peace in my despair knowing god will hear my prayer and i will clean to the promise that he brings even death will have no sting no power in hell in his presence i will dwell where it is [Music] elisha stood by the bedside where she laid the boy when he died he prayed a prayer upon him and he bring their life again praying god doesn't ever change if you'll have that woman's faith send you your miracle and until then you can say it is well it is peace in my despair knowing god will hear my prayer i will cling to the promise that he brings even death [Music] is it is worth there is peace in my despair knowing god will hear my prayer i will [Music] is [Music] it is [Music] amen it is well i wasn't really paying attention to the them practicing and i chose this morning it as well with my soul and i think god has a theme for today amen all is well as we get ready to turn the service to brother paul let's sing he's in the house number 1225. amen [Music] little girl was lying there people all were we paid they just laughed at jesus when he said she's only sleeping as he took her by the hand she began to live again some began to praise the lord some began to say he's in the house death has to flee [Music] now there is life where darkness used to be now there is hope there's no more doubt praise his name praise his name he's in the house [Music] we were like that little girl dead in all our sins till jesus touched this heart of mine gave me life again i'm just a house of clay ever since that blessed day there's a light that shines on me for all the world to see all he's in the house yes death has to flee now there is life where darkness used to be now there is hope there's no more doubt praise his name praise his name he's in the heart oh he's in the house death has to flee now there is life where darkness used to be now there is hope there's no more doubt praise his name his name he's in the house he's in my house let's make it personal now oh he's in my house yes death has to flee now there is life where darkness used to be now there is hope there's no more down praise his name praise his name he's in my house oh he's in my house yes death has to flee now there is [Music] is life there's no more doubt praise his name praise his name he's in my heart [Music] hallelujah and while we're testifying that he's in the house you might say this is a little different than we normally do it brother paul but our sister dorcas not feeling well has been to the doctor and the doctor says i believe your heart is enlarged now natural physicians tell you what they know but we serve the great physician and the brothers are going to join me and we are going to just save sister dorcas the strength of walking up here and we're going to anoint her with oil and we're going to pray for her that the doctor finds nothing we rebuke satan in the name of jesus christ it is not my power it's not your power but it is in the power of the spoken word amen join me brothers amen [Music] hallelujah brother ivan yes [Music] heavenly father we come before you today lord as my sister has shared this affliction that satan is trying to push upon her lord father we think of many things simple prayers which we have already prayed lord we have thought about when and where and how but lord we come to the house of god the prophet said to receive life from the word my sister lord needs a touch from you today she needs life to flow in her body lord and we come according to your word father that you have given us the authority to call you on this scene lord we're asking your father as you come down today and move in our midst lord may your holy spirit come and touch my sister dorcas may healing virtue father lord i find it interesting all the songs and the thoughts lord father that we are here lord that we've already received our healing in the name of jesus christ it has already been granted to us now father according to thy word we make the claim lord to stand upon this and let our faith be bound with our sister lord that she would be able to step forward and has already confessed lord that she is making that claim so we stand together with our voices raised up my sister has already received her healing in the name of jesus christ now lord we bind every spirit that might bring doubt that might bring fear lord that might bring hesitation and lord let us come boldly before the throne of god to declare to you today that healing is already here and the holy spirit flowing through my sister's body will bring her to strength and peace once again lord we claim this in the name of jesus christ and may it be soul may it be so father hallelujah let's give the lord a hand clap of praise amen let's just lift it thank you lord for this healing thank you lord for touching my sister all saints we've seen it we've seen it too many times the devil might try to deny it he might try to get you to hesitate from it but we have seen the power of the spoken word moving in the bride of christ amen not a week not a month not a year goes by but what god's word is being proven over and over and over again hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen thank you sister emmy amen brother jason beautiful song service i love it when the lord just gives that kind of leadership this kind of that kind of anointing our sister beth i love that song amen it just stirs my heart because you see it would take more than carnal understanding to look at your own child flesh and blood laying there dead and the words of your mouth would say all is well that is not a human element that is god manifesting himself in flesh through flesh to be vindicated in the flesh thank you thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah amen just want to stand if you stand for a moment please um i don't know what your plans are for easter saints um we i say we sister jerry and i will be eating lunch here in the church sunday afternoon after the easter service and i put it that way because i want no one to feel obligated right some have plans that they do with their family and pre-existing you might say plans and so uh we're just going to be here going to eat lunch here at the church and um uh oh let me make this simple just bring your own food okay it might be a quick run to winco for fried chicken but whatever it is but what i'm saying is let's not make a big complicated meal and people feel obligated to do something so i would love to fellowship with you if that fits into your plans amen so i just want to look down through here just a second real quick amen brother jason's already reminded us of communion i bring greetings to you from our brother daniel fryho and just had a lovely lovely conversation with him yesterday and uh him and sister karen send their greetings and you know brother brother daniel i enjoy a very special relationship with him just as though we were uh almost closer i guess you'd say than blood brothers but i i just asked him how everything was going and uh you know some beautiful testimony there because he was talking about how he had just been invited to be a pastor of this little hispanic group and only been a pastor for 30 days when he was stricken down with that that virus infection that went in and started eating on his nerves and the muscles and the bone and and ended up in the hospital incapacitated for months and i said well brother daniel how did the church hold up in this time he said brother paul he said not only did it hold up it thrived they come to the church on sundays and had prayer meetings they come wednesday nights prayer meetings they come during the week they would just meet their their families would come they'd come home from work and go and they would have prayer meeting and god is blessing them and uh just doing a great work now many times people say oh a great work how big is the work my brother and sister the work that began in you and i was a very small work but it was a powerful work it was a work that could not be defeated it was a work that would not give up the number doesn't matter it's the work of god is what really really matters and you know our brother daniel has always had a very maybe this is why we get along very warped sense of humor um but uh i i love his sense of humor and i said how are you doing brother daniel are you getting out and about and he said brother paul he said i have a complete new hip and so with that complete new hip i am able to now preach standing up and he said trust me yeah preaching is wonderful preaching in a wheelchair is difficult and he said i now have my liberty back preaching and uh so really thankful to hear that as he put it i get a preach standing up and i'm walking again and here's where the humor come in he says sometimes i walk with the cane but really only because i think i look good walking with a cane so you know you you've got to just love that sense of humor he doesn't say yeah you know sometimes i have to pack this crazy stick around it's like no i look good anyway let's remember our brother daniel sister karen in prayer and um i put out i don't know when it will you know be for him the time he said they drove down to tucson to um visit some family and he said that two and a half hours in the car was just about the limit of what he could handle i've invited him to come and preach for us again so whenever the lord opens that door we would enjoy seeing of them again amen okay so remember winco has fried chicken you don't even have to spend your next easter morning cooking it amen let's turn in our bibles i want to speak to you on um you shall receive power now my brother and sister this actually is a a promise to us that has a caveat to it we're not just going to come start going to church and walk in the door and just be what we're going to be and receive power so the word of god puts a as it were parameter of how it will be that we'll receive power amen one we know we have to repent and we have to get baptized in the name of jesus christ not just any old form not any old words not just hey jesus said but in his name we receive that and then the word says then you receive the gift of the holy ghost but when we look at this now my brother and sister is we'll go back the same scripture out of luke that we were in last last week or or was it luke or axe acts i guess luke said it but we look at this see and and god puts it in the right context for us to be able to follow that pattern and i find it interesting just doing some studying in the life of the prophet and uh that caused me to go back and look as it were in the life of our lord jesus christ and you know many writings but writing without anointing is just words and words without anointing are just words so the spoken word by individual without anointing is just words and writing without the anointing especially when you start talking about what jesus did and what jesus said and those that were around him you can write a very dry historical memoir that is powerless that's right now having said that i don't want to offend anyone but we can look back even in our day and the prophet that god sent to our age we can render that dry and powerless that's not what god intended god intended for this word to be so powerful delivering power healing power everything we need kind of power but if we take it dry historical it will be powerless amen so let's just turn luke uh the first i mean luke i keep on to say luke amen acts the first chapter verse four amen had a lot of studying in luke and luke is on the mind i guess amen acts the first chapter we'll start with the fourth verse through the eighth now we see in the word here these people were assembled together and we'll find that as a as a trend you might say that is promoted all the way through scripture not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together to be assembled together uh how important that is to us amen now excuse me here i had one last note that i just noticed now i don't want to embarrass anybody shame anybody but um our church is going to grow here in a couple months by one more precious baby and oh nothing to be embarrassed about sister tomah i'm excited we get to hold one more little baby by god's grace whoever has the privilege to dedicate that child we get to create the atmosphere as a assembly that's what stirred my mind back to that note amen this is not their family gets a child the assembly gets a child amen and i say thank you lord i feel very blessed that one more child comes in and we get to we get to just be a part of that and lift them up in prayer and amen hug and maybe even kiss on the cute little thing amen and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem now my brother and sister while we do not hold to a mecca as it is we have to be one place to receive the word of god god laid a foundation for them he had the time and the place already picked out and god has the time and the place for you and i we can't just randomly say i'm going to worship god on the mountain on sundays i'm going to do this i'm going to do that god has a plan for us and as he shares this with them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me so this promise is not a mystery to those god's fixing to anoint with the holy ghost people say i was just walking along and the holy ghost fell on me well that's wonderful but you see my brother and sister it has to be god's choice of when where how we can't just have an emotional shiver and call it the holy ghost amen now i i was well and let me you're all standing and i'll just preach the whole sermon to you for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hints right he's put a time frame for them when they therefore will come together they ask of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel. and he saith said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all judea and samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth heavenly father we ask lord for blessings upon your word upon this thought today lord may it be food father for the bride of christ in your name we pray amen you may be seated amen so as we look at this my brother and sister we we find that that in spite of the human characteristic or desire or as i speak of myself often the curiosities to know and answer uh god said you know it's not really for you to know now many people have put it in different fashions they tried to even pressure the profit into putting a time frame to it and and that but you see it's up to god amen and he's put it in his own power and we're going to talk this morning on this topic you know ye shall receive power so this power that god has that the time and the season is contained in it is there my brother and sister that at god's choosing he's going to unleash that power to us and in that you could say he is giving us revelation you know that's what the uh the rapture will be it will be a revelation to the bride of jesus christ it it is not as it were a calculation but it is a revelation and so too many people by trying to put times and dates and circumstances and all of these factors uh try to put it into a calculation now my brother and sister it is fine it is not a sin for us to look at the signs and the seasons and what is happening in the world around us and say you know lord it's got to be getting close i think most of us would say amen to that it it's got to be getting close we're seeing all of these things that have been spoken and prophesied coming together and my brother and sister as they come together they become magnified and so it's there that we are looking at a time and a season but you know i always like to temper that kind of conversation with the fact that the prophet of god said that you should keep planting your potatoes now if you want to get real technical on the verbiage as some people would be oh we're not farmers we don't have potatoes to plant well maybe it is a season because my whole backyard is going to be 80 acres of potatoes this year but i only say that in humor because the real thing that god wants us to do is just be ready don't become lukewarm don't become cold be ready but he also didn't want us to do which is what happened to many people in 1977 and that is they sold houses lands cars businesses whatever it was only to find that they had not had the revelation that they thought they had so the prophet of god wants you to get up every morning saying i'm going to live for the lord today and when the sun sets at night say lord keep us while we sleep and we'll rise again tomorrow to serve you again and you know some of us may well grow old and you will hold a memorial for us and the lord might not have still come but my brother and sister that's not what we're doing if we take that kind of approach we're actually looking for an accent plan we're looking for a shortcut we're looking to i can hold on long enough to get to that point you can hold on as long as you desire in your heart because you are going to receive power you say brother paul i don't know sometimes uh you know you have a bad day i know none of you have bad days none of you it's just people like you yeah yeah but you see that's not that's not what god's looking at my brother and sister and and if i can get myself started here we'll kind of go down through this amen so as we look at this we see this great need now we'll bring this up in our closing quote today but speaking of satan's reasoning and i just want to interject that so that the thought of reasoning would be here uh in your mind or thoughts as we're preaching i think it's very safe to say i mean absolutely safe to say there is no true life outside of jesus christ now there is living flesh that is there but not it's not really life my brother and sister and uh so it is there that we realize that uh as as i've been studying and almost preached on this morning a topic connected to investments you know uh the word tells us that uh he has gone to prepare a place for us and many mansions and and the context of this in my house all of this is there my brother and sister but to achieve that you have to make an investment and we're living in a world today that certainly it is kind of daunting you know the the powers to be or out here saying we're headed for another bubble we're headed for another crisis we're headed for these things and many people are finding themselves paralyzed to to move forward but my brother and sister no matter what you do in life you are making an investment and those investments are either declining or they are rising and we say well we need to you know need to drive a dependable vehicle that's wonderful but remember dependability doesn't always mean expensive and so you know we look at that and we say well i if i invest in a new car the price of it's going to fall uh and that is a losing or declining asset and if i buy property it would be an investment that would uh gain or rise in value but my brother and sister all of that is still irrelevant in the life of a son or daughter of god because to us there is only one investment that we can make that actually pays off all the res rest of this just burns at some point in time all the rest of this is the prophet of god said the day will come will take they'll take your church from you and turn it to a storehouse so all the investment that we have made in this building right here would come to naught in the relevant sense but my brother and sister there's an investment that we have been given and we can make it every day amen we can invest into that every single day and that investment cannot be taken away from us it is not an investment as it were of flesh and blood or physical but it is the power of almighty god it is god preparing in you amen that's the thing sometimes we're getting the idea i'm going to go to heaven well the prophet of god preached right here that you get a taste of heaven in advance amen you're gonna live in spiritual places you're gonna live in that realm of the elevated now the devil sometimes can can uh just uh bring you into a place you get nervous about things and i i hate to be this transparent but you know i've just been really nervous lately because everything that we have tried to plan to plant etc etc it just seems like there's roadblocks and insufficient water and when you've got a landlord that you've been paying you know x amount of sum of money every year to him and it it's something that you struggle with to word it and to find and finally just have to get brave and and contact them and say i simply can't do this there's no way we can physically do this and you know i i bring this as an example to you because this man is just simply an investor his family is quite wealthy they live in california they own real estate all over the world and kind of uh the original relationship was well you meet our terms or we'll find someone who can and i'm fretting freddie freddie and i finally contact him and i say this is what's happening and i can't do it and this is the best i can do fine just do what's best i trust you now look what all my worry got me but the devil had that anointed to where i couldn't hardly sleep over this equation and many of you will have something very similar in your life amen and that is why we are called to have confidence right our healing is not in our hand saints it our healing is not in the doctor's hands our healing is in the hands of our lord jesus christ and he has not failed us now people say but but our sister laura passed away no my brother and sister our sister laura got promoted but in our human element we look at it contrary you might say to the way that god is doing and we are then under that influence of satan's reasoning so no life outside of jesus christ but you see satan will try to reason you now catch this satan will try to reason you into a position that fits your carnal feelings that's exactly right amen amen well this is how it is that's why you've still got to be real careful when you say oh no i'm not speaking doubt i'm not speaking fear i'm just speaking facts who's facts who's facts if they're god's facts it might be an entirely different conversation but if they're human facts we could say oh it's all going to come to an end this is horrible but we've got to get in the realm we're actually caught up in the mind of christ preaching the speaking god's facts amen his fact says i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i was with you in the beginning i will be with you in the end that's god's facts but we get caught up in the carnal reasoning a carnal position that this is all going downhill well you know what if we're going to talk like that maybe we ought to just be a hundred percent the other way amen and just walk around and say woe is me now i'm preaching to paul this morning amen woe is me how about we just change that and walk around and say praise the lord god's blessing me god's blessing me god's blessing me i'm gonna have more amen a greater spiritual walk i'm gonna have more strength i'm gonna have more understanding more natural knowledge i'm going to have more of everything than i've ever had and people will say something's wrong with you because otherwise we've got to walk around and say you know our country that starts with an eye and enzo with a tea guy in the white house he's just running he's sucking all the life out of our nation and it's going downhill everywhere you look going down he oh look at this yeah look at this brother jason should we move to canada he says no where are we going to go my brother and sister the word of god shows we have no refuge but jesus christ no refuge but the word but you see satan's trying to reason us into a position where we'll say well you know we're going to just have to go ahead and buy that land in montana and you guys can build there's enough pine trees there you can build your cabin i can't see you and i can't see you know blah blah blah and we'll do all this you know what will happen pretty soon somebody will say your cabin's nicer than mine you ought to give it to me somebody will say the creek behind your cabin has fish in it my no give it to me and pretty soon the devil pour in a little sand and sand creates friction and pretty soon it will blow apart and then we would say i guess there's no god after all we serve an awesome god we don't have to flee to a wilderness as it were to hide we can stand on the word of god and know that the power of the word is what is going to change our life amen now look you see satan will try and reason with you into a position that fits your carnal feeling brother branham says right here now you're familiar with this scripture i mean this quote now paul's speaking here of the valley or the shadow rather the law being a shadow of good things to come could never make the worshiper perfect yeah that's right we agree with that then he goes on to show what the perfection is now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well satan anointing my carnal feelings i'm weak now my brother and sister son or daughter of god that's not allowing their carnal feelings to be anointed it's not going to talk like this that's exactly right amen are you listening paul amen my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian see that's all anointings come on get this this is going to be a slap to you and a slap to me this never comes my brother and sister until the thought has been pregnanted in our own mind and spirit when you are standing on the word of god and you are not going to listen to the devil these words will never affect you but when we have come into that certain position in the world of psychology they call them triggers now now i know i know that you know you just you just go and do these things after this this and this happens so what you got to do to not do that is just make sure this this and this doesn't ever happen around you well absolutely i can do that i can never go to work ever again i could never drive i could never you know whatever because the trigger is always there are you with me saints the trigger is always there you can't hide from the trigger satan comes in and says well they're in that position they're headed there headed right down the deal they just opened their checkbook they got 500 worth of bills and got 300 in the checkbook they're set up or to those of you whatever it might be but you see it's strange thing that this is so much thought of of people they say well i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say oh my paul he's preaching at you this morning amen you're just talking his language right then see you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time you say how can it be positive all the time brother paul i'm living life as a human in the flesh how can it be positive all the time well the prophet of god said if you didn't want the devil to defeat you all you had to do is one simple thing can somebody tell me what that was stay under the blood there is our protection against the fiery darts of the enemy now people say you know i've never really been in a fiery trial i guess the devil doesn't count me i've heard testimony this might not be perfect word for word yeah i've never been in a real fiery trial i guess the devil just doesn't deem me worthy come on here we are you just placed value on yourself that was agreeing with the devil's anointing and you never thought you was in a battle you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive old time i am safe can we say that together i am saved i have god in my heart let's say that together i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart amen you see how simple this comes to pushing back the anointing that satan puts in the time that we're in a certain position and our human thinking is there and it coincides and it seems so reasonable see satan has us reasoning now my brother and sister this also could be brought in a sense to say that when we would agree with the devil and this just really struck me deep in my heart but when we agree with the devil of this we're making the blood of jesus christ to none effect that's not who we are that's not what we were called for not called to make the blood of jesus christ of none effect oh i never meant that but you see it's what satan anoints us to do amen now you look at this we know the scripture talks about to obey is better than sacrifice now i'm going to throw a little curve ball at you today my brother and sister because we would be then i'll just be obedient i'll be obedient so that i don't have to sacrifice but we're going to look at this today and realize that sacrifice is a part of our experience there is no getting to heaven on flowery beds of east there is a sacrifice that is required of every one of us amen as we would see in israel they had to bring the lamb or the turtle dove but man perverted that and started to make money out of that and and they started to make a tradition and they thought it would make sense my brother and sister to bring the auction yard right to the step of the church to make religion convenient sometimes we need a hard thing in our life sometimes we get just life is so full of of uh uh ease that that we actually uh become very spiritually lazy uh we become spiritually obese uh we we can't make a sacrifice because that's inconvenient for us amen i remember reading i might not have this right of those who you know this quote but i remember reading this some time back and said there's two ways a man will wear out his britches either the bottom or the knees on his knees praying for god to come or on his bottom waiting for god to come now i thought that was very interesting my brother and sister not to say that you can't be seated amen and and pray for god to come but just making that point amen to obey is better than sacrifice you see this is part of our experience my brother and sister and and it requires a sacrifice on our part and you look at this uh uh and i i think not to change scripture but you look at this i would say obedience brings sacrifice in fact there would be certain things in our life that when we're obedient to the word we'll start sacrificing certain things that were important in our life people say well well i want to be able to serve god and just live like i did before find me an example in scripture where the power of the word when it struck the seed in the heart left a person just like they was before now you study the apostles the disciples and you will see it upended their whole industry their careers their whole lives and it cost them their life because the obedience to the word caused them to break away now when you think about this my brother and sister i don't know that this is totally accurate but you know matthew tax collector right that stigma remained on him until he died in roman society the tax collector in in israel was of of the lowest we would think well he got to go no my brother and sister this is the guy that come and knocked on your door now imagine how you'd feel brother paul started implementing in the church here a mandatory inventory of your finances that we knock on your door and say okay let us see your pay stub let us see your your you think that's ridiculous i can tell you of a religion right now that does that and the people submit now you tell me oh no we wouldn't do that that's not the word but i'm telling you under anointings of reasoning people open their finances and they tell them what they're going to give isn't that amazing you see how i'm letting you off the problem see is what they've done is try to make a forced obedience and i believe any real true minister of the gospel is going to remind you what malachi 3 says you're not going to just say oh we've just scrubbed that and put it under the rug that's old testament that's god's word but you see the neat thing i was going to use the word cool but that sounds so outdated now we've got all these new woke phrases that cool is just and awesome i guess it's out also but look at this my brother and sister what the holy spirit desires today is not that you be mandated but you be molded by the word then the word brings you and you say i want to be obedient and no i'm not preaching about ties this morning but you see how god chooses to work so we study the history of the early church and and we see how the the disciples left a powerful testimony there there was there was no doubting who these men were my brother and sister when you went on the shores of galilee you went to hebron you went to jerusalem you know they come a season that nobody had to say so we heard jesus's disciples are in town who are they history clearly shows scripture and history clearly shows that they become a very focal point of walking down the street people knew who they were and some said oh praise the lord those are those faithful men and others despise them and said how can we put them to death how can we defame them you see there was something that was being brought out and it was there in that my brother and sister that the sacrifice that they were making in their mind now this is after they receive the holy ghost my brother and sister the sacrifice that would be in one man's mind and say why have they sacrificed their fishing fleet and their family and their positions here for this here and others would say oh they are so blessed it was all that anointing why today to people say the message of the hour i see things about it i believe are the truth but why do they say it's too hard to live and yet there's a people that every day are saying lord let me sacrifice myself more lord let me die to myself more today than yesterday lord i feel like sometimes i'm an utter failure now i don't want to lift no hands but the devil would like to anoint us with that spirit of utter failure and we fall under that but the prophet of god said you know that when he has redeemed you you are completely redeemed he didn't redeem one portion of you for a day but he redeemed you for eternity amen isn't that beautiful and we could turn around and say but i made mistakes yesterday that's right you made mistakes but the prophet of god says god didn't see it that's right but he says you won't willfully do it right in other words you won't say well praise the lord i'll go to church tomorrow i'll drop my shackle in the offering i'm forgiven see wrong approach the real believer's heart grieves amen it's bleeding in that sacrifice it's bleeding in that situation it's crying out forgive me lord amen amen these disciples they left a powerful testimony a powerful witness what was the witness of we walked with jesus no that would have worked on judas too i was there at the last supper should have worked on judas too there was something more something deeper something more intrinsic that gripped their hearts what it was the experience of the upper room my brother and sister the culmination of jesus ministry in that season see we got to be careful to say that's just not the culmination of his ministry that was a culmination of his ministry in that season did you know my brother and sister in every city and every place in the world there is an upper room now you're not going to walk in and find a travel guide and look through it and say okay where's the upper room in in chicago where's the upper room in san antonio where's the upper room in miami no no you're not going to find that but i can assure you in every city in every country in this world every countryside there's an upper room it might be a little shanty in the country it might be a nice beautiful church somewhere but it doesn't matter god has provided that upper room because that upper room experience is a culmination of the whole revelation of jesus christ he placed his authority my brother and sister 120 original believers believed him and i put that to that term in that way because they believed him enough to climb the stairs they believed him enough to not go back home and become a carpenter go back home and become a fisherman go back over here and become a tax collector they believed enough to come and say he said don't leave jerusalem until you've been endued with power and there was something inside of them that longed for that power it was not the kind of power to step out in the street and say whoa unto you and woe unto you and do you do this and you do that but it was a power that was down inside of their soul and they longed for that hallelujah you know the common sense thing today would have been just had brother david preach because i don't feel good but the other common sense thing today is that when god puts something on your heart you preach it hallelujah so they have this witness of upper room experience now my brother and sister you realize how much that marked them it marked them severe everyone knew those were the guys were down there in the upper room drunk they were up there drunk but they were speaking in some language we didn't even know and i'm fluent in six different languages and and i i didn't recognize any of these languages that's because it was a heavenly language and the only way you learn a heavenly language is to be in heavenly places amen you can't go down here as it were they term things you know like las vegas you can't be down here on this strip and learn a heavenly language amen you've got to be in the presence of almighty god amen so this upper room experience my brothers is something that is duplicated today as if that would be a correct word i could use because you see god brings this wherever and whenever it is not something it's like well i'm going to have to go now i don't mean to offend no one i don't mean it that way but that's why god never allowed isn't allowing this message to have a mecca because god doesn't want us thinking i'm going to get the holy ghost when i go to this building walk up here and kneel at this altar in this place at this time god gives the holy ghost when sons and daughters of god submit themselves amen and meet the criteria as it were repent be baptized and cry out for the holy ghost step into the presence of god now we believe god is all present amen and so it's not that it has to happen even in a church isn't that amazing as much as we believe in going to the house of god sitting in the house of god joining together to worship the lord you don't have to be in a church to receive the holy ghost isn't that beautiful amen i know of men that were clinging it's a lovely story actually a man went on to do wonderful things for the lord this was back in i think the 1860s or 70s and and uh quite a rough and vile man and he worked on a a whaler ship you know they they harvested whales if i don't say it right whaling whaling ship and their ship is sinking now he's clinging to a piece of wood in the middle of the ocean he knows that they are way out there up almost to sister beth's house and uh way out there and now he's clinging to a piece of wood what is left and he's thinking on his life and amazing what god would do to go back and make us rewind our life well wait my life was painful i don't want to rewind it god will make you rewind it because you can't have a whole bunch of static in your life i'm just going to use the word static because otherwise i'd be here the rest of the day describing all the various influences you can't have a lot of static in your life that has brought you to a place today you can't serve god freely are you with me so what will god do as much as you don't like it and i don't like it god's going to force you to rewind your life and go back to the static and deal with it and when you have dealt with that static and you got it out of your life then it is my brother and sister many people now i'm going to talk in psychology here but many people my brother and sister had things that have happened in their youth or whatever stage of their life that has left them with so much static they cannot trust god they want to trust him did you catch that they want to but they can't so god just starts forcing them to rewind the reel and you say but i've been a a christian my whole life no you've got to get back to the point the prophet of god said wherever you left him at come on and you say this isn't real deep spiritual stuff no you're right it's not real deep amen but you've got to be washed by the water of the word entirely not just certain portions of life but entirely you know the word has got to take you back to that place and somebody betrayed you somebody done you wrong something happened and a bitterness and a fear and anger rose up in there but you just glossed it over and you went on and now you can't trust the lord and you don't know why you cry out in prayers lord lord lord but yet we pull back the lord wants to open the whole wide world to you and we pull back and say i don't know why i don't know why trust me i prayed with these people i prayed with these people my brother and sister i don't mean to just make points but i remember a time south america amen had no idea what was happening but we were there were preaching in a church and just something come upon me and i used uh what i thought was such a silly analogy and in the church there i of course had a microphone on and i walked all the way to the back of the church and i'm preaching away and a thought to them and i'm preaching away and i'm preaching away and then i said now if you are going to see paul you're going to have to turn and look for him because the direction you're looking right now you won't see him my brother and sister no matter what the devil has thrown at you and no matter what's happening in your life you have to stop quit looking at the circumstance quit looking at those things that pain you and start looking for christ amen there's where our deliverance is it might not ever come from the person that hurts you it might not ever come from the church that hurt you it might not ever come from a family member that hurts you but if you look to christ he can come in there and wash that away and make that as it were and then the tape can replay and you come to the place you say my god is an awesome god i can trust my god he is looking out for me he will never forsake me but if that don't happen my brother and sister we wonder why we go forward in life and we can't fully trust the lord oh hallelujah look at these disciples the witnesses of an upper room experience and god took them all over the earth and you can look at the disciples the apostles and see how they died they died in india they died in turkey they died you know in rome and they died all over my brother and sister every one of them without exception paid with their life now if god would require that of them he'll require the same of you ours might not be crucified on a cross upside down it might not be us thrown in boiling oil amen but we'll give our life now the word tells us saints that we can't truly say that jesus is the christ without the holy ghost is that right amen now what is the difference there the difference of one's voice speaking it in one spirit speaking it that's right right anybody you see you know anyone can say jesus is the christ that's just good plain english or whatever language you're speaking but you know it's when it comes from the spirit that it changes that holy spirit moving us what is we we were sharing the other day ownership amen lord is ownership amen got to come to the place you say yep i don't even belong to myself i don't even belong to my family i belong to him amen amen that's right how much more the power of the word is released by the holy spirit you see my brother and sister that's why people can have the same bible same message book that you have and get an entirely different uh conclusion from it is because we go one from the flesh or from the spirit and when the spirit comes down the word said that the word of god is so sharp it will separate the morrow and the bone amen is so sharp that it can come and separate our reasoning from the word you say but we need to understand that's right understanding is not reasoning and yet the critics would come and say did they not say let us reason together the holy ghost talking to the unconverted just open your mind for a moment and look how awesome our god is look how supernatural our god is look how these scriptures have been fulfilled but satan comes in such a fashion that he makes reasoning a perfectly reasonable thing yeah isn't that amazing hope you all don't mind i haven't drank water at the pulpit forever and last couple weeks here breaking that let's look here in hebrews 7 and 14. i need to hustle right along now we see as the sanhedrin the pharisees sadducees sanhedrin while they are judging things it doesn't take a very deep review of history to show that they are simply riddled with tradition and you know lest you guys that feel real comfortable the message is actually getting riddled full of tradition and so that spirit the prophet of god says you know the devil takes his man but he never takes his spirit god takes his man but he never takes his spirit so these spirits are still here where people are saying we as message believers do this like this and if you break that now if you want to see how funny tradition can be you go to an event in an lds or mormon church and wear a colored the shirt just walked in our church how do you know that they've got a blue shirt on they've got a red shirt on and we only wear white shirts to church i can take you right to a church in the message that holds that same thing i don't know if they had a mormon background or not amen if you had a brother walk up in the pulpit with a colored shirt on the deacon should drag him and throw him out the side exit where he couldn't be seen from the street tradition but white represents purity said every catholic priest for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood oh it's in the line of david the priests don't come from there priests come from my family and your family and that family and they gave me one anybody else last year in the church so their family come on come on speak nothing concerning priesthood and yet it is far more evident for that after the similitude of melchizedek there arises another priest see god said you know what man's gonna so mess this thing up that i'm gonna already provide an avenue that falls in the priesthood but it ain't gonna fall in a carnal element because satan's already just study the history of caiaphas man they had a dynasty and it struck me i probably shouldn't even say this in public but it struck me i thought oh that's how some ministries end up being worth millions they pick up a bible a harley can stutter their way through their first sermon and 30 years later they're worth millions of dollars they've got a spirit atheist so who is made not after the law of carnal commandment see here's the problem we have sometimes my brother and sister we have stepped so far away from the word of god deluded it so down that we start to this is how we do this this is how we do this we don't do this we don't do that you know i find it interesting now i'm not mean to negative because just that's that's the way things are had a brother one time come did communion with us here in the church and afterwards he made a comment to me caught me so off guard he goes boy you guys do communion weird well um it's the way i was raised it's the way we've always done it well that's what i'm talking about you guys don't do it right and i'm like okay how should we do it well you should you should take the wine and the bread to the people you have scripture for that no but that's how brother soul and so does it oh okay well how about you go back and tell them that brother so and so does it this way and they ought to change you know that joke kind of went out because we have our our tradition we have our way but you see melchizedek this priesthood that we've been called to was not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life my brother and sister if the communion is taken to the church i just took communion sister jerry just took communion uh i think i guess we did take alia with us she was there you know you go they bring it out they pass it to you in the in the in the aisle i didn't say well this ain't communion it's ain't the way we do it it was communion what are you laughing about oh we went and got it and then drank it in our seats okay well you know i am slightly over 60. that's my excuse i'ma stick with it okay we did walk up there that's right but we drank it and ate it sitting in the in the congregation i knew i knew when i uh anyway shut up paul but you see what what's happening none of this oh let me make my point i'm trying to make here none of this my brother and sister whether it's a white horse or a white cloud the prophet of god said you just need to believe he's coming whether it's communion in the seat communion up front communion this way or whatever that way my brother and sister as long as we're in communion with jesus christ there's the issue there's the issue amen because the power of an endless life is what god intended this is what started in the upper room by brother and sister it was not a one-time pentecostal event now i'm going to skip over a few things so i'm going to throw this out we got another thing moving in the realms of the message and they'll look over and say you know what those people are just acting way too pentecostal to be message believers well my brother and sister look where the true root come from it didn't come as it were in a street and a church or a place like that it come in the upper room and they walked out spilled out in the street and quietly tiptoed off no sir there were some people that were alive they were talking in other tongues they were praising god and people around this message are then looking at that and saying you know what why can't they be message baptists or because we have our own methods message methodists you know that's what stands for they don't have some deep deep spiritual connotation it was we have a better method you guys that are ocd would know what i'm talking about you have a method nobody can put the dishes away like you do nobody can put the silverware away like you do nobody can arrange the house like you do oh somebody move the picture on the piano how do you know well when i stand right over here inside off of the flower stand it's got to be exactly between here and the corner of the picture frame because i read that in betty crocker yeah i said that on purpose but what happened this power of an endless life makes you and i priest to almighty god amen for a season no my brother and sister not just for a season but an endless life an endless life and it testified that we're after the order of melchizedek was that just a seasonal thing no sir no sir abraham knew who he was looking at abraham didn't say well i'm so glad god sent a priest my way abraham looked and said this is god amen himself in flesh now look my brother and sister this is where it gets complicated as long as we're able to look back in history and say well that was god in flesh jesus christ was god in flesh we see a prophet of god that god moved so closely that people thought he was god in flesh and we cannot bring ourselves to look in the mirror and believe that we are god in flesh for nothing you can't convince me i'm god in flesh i've heard those words and it breaks my heart because regardless of what you might see is weakness in me and what i see is weakness in me god looked down and said that's my son and that's where i'm going to pour myself and that's who's going to go forth on the earth in the 21st century and testify that i'm alive we can look back in history and say rose from the grave but is he living today oh hallelujah amen now are the priests forever after the order of melchizedek that's eternal life right there my brother and sister there is verily a disannuling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by which we draw nigh unto god god said you know what i'm not going to give you as a believer this argument over law and grace you realize that's what's going on out here in the denominational churches as they get farther and farther away from god their their their their place they go back i can't remember the word i just wanted you but the place they go their anchor post their anchor post they're getting farther and farther from it but you know what their deal is when you talk to them oh well you're under law we're under grace okay deacons turn the lights down they get up there and do their thing it's no more worship than anything but they tell you if you had a revelation of living under grace yeah got a whole nother side street we won't go there it took me too long to get here for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in a better hope did by which we draw nigh amen unto god now in the five definite identifications of the true church i want you to catch this real quick i'm going to hurry through this now you can graft citrus fruit you can take an orange tree and put a lemon on it and it'll grow that's what you men grafted in now brother brown's talking in spiritual context here saying he's saying that's what you man grafted in and these organization is what man grafted in it's a lemon isn't that funny because what do we refer to my brother and sister when something's a failure it's a lemon now i don't know if god just ordained you know anointed brother branham to use that as an example because why didn't he choose grapefruit but you see in a world we live in forever and ever history showed that when we thought something was a failure it's a lemon it's a lemon all the time it'll grow because it's stuck out in the church name but let me tell you if that tree ever puts forth another branch itself it'll bear an orange and if the power of god ever puts forth another church uh oh uh oh it took us years to get our church tamed down to fall under that anointing amen dying calf come on we're not called to come in the house of god to be dying calves you say well none of us pronounce it that way but some do in their spirit i know it's expected of me to say amen to that quote but i don't like it can i repeat that just a i got a i got a rash on you now i want to bring a little blood blood's cleansing some of you don't like these quotes that you hear but we're expected to say amen now if we can only say that jesus is the christ and the holy ghost can i step out you guys just don't know how strong this limb is i'm going to walk away out on this limb did you know my brother and sister if we can only say that jesus is the christ by the holy ghost then an amen is not an amen unless it's anointed in the spirit it don't matter how many amens we speak if there is no acceptance no anointing no revival attached then that is just as empty as you would be like a marine corps and say hurrah now imagine how shocked you go as it all be if somebody's come and sit in church and 30 times in a service hurrah and be like what's wrong with this guy that'd be just as empty as an amen that didn't come from here amen boy god help us god help us if god ever puts forth another church it'll be another pentecost they didn't tiptoe out of the upper room saints i'm not talking about how you got to be wild and jump up and down and shout and do all these things i'm talking about the fact that there's a spirit trying to subdue your spirit to keep you humbled down not humbled in the right way but beat down to where you can't really say from the heart amen to the word of god you see god hears the amends that the preacher never hears yeah yeah the one that comes from your heart amen it'll be another pentecost another book of acts will be wrote behind it that's right now it's very interesting when you talk about the book of acts you look through the quotes i encourage you to go look them up you'll see there my brother and sister some people push back on this because they think that we're trying to impersonate that early church and they're right they're right because the prophet of god in some of his closing ministry said you need to go back to the original word now we're not trying to impersonate them to find history and dress like them and grow our hair out and do this and do that but you're going to find that original church was liberated by the holy ghost satan did not have them chained down he did not have them bound down in their mind or their spirit but look history will show you many of them were hungry and destitute and everything that goes with that day but they had liberty in jesus christ they had liberty in the word oh if i could just pay all my bills without worry i'd be i'd have liberty no you just buy more stuff that you'd have to worry about another book of acts will be wrote behind it that's right because it's the church of god jesus said i am the vine you are the branches you cannot bear fruit in yourself but i throw my own self into the branch i like i like how we put that just good old kentucky english i throw myself in there hallelujah well you know the moment was there god finally got us to open up and he just threw himself right in here because my brother and sister we know that in our self there is no good thing how could i ever come how could you ever come to the place that we'd say i'd be worthy to receive the holy ghost impossible but god come and just put himself in there and then all of a sudden we found ourselves oh lord throw these magazines away throw these books away throw the television out uh start oh these clothes got to go got to do this got to do that you want to go to the lake with my family and swim no the prophet said mixed bathing's not correct so we're not going to do that well that's legalist strange my prophet that god sent to me was a legalist i guess see how the devil's so slippery oh your standard's a little different from ours you're a legalist as though that means that you have a tail on pitchfork and horns no my brother and my sister we've got to get the mind of god amen what god said now i'm not trying to be a legalist many of you you have to decide what you're going to do for yourself but the thing is you see he said i'm the vine you're the branches you can't bear fruit in yourself so we can't even oh we don't even have an idea of our own we should not even have an idea of our own lord what should i do about this look at the word lord what do i need to do about this what about a job what about this what about a house what about a car what about all this stuff what about the clothes we buy what what is it amen reminds me i think it was brother donnie reagan said this years ago he says some of you got this idea you can go down to mcdonald's three meals a day and pray pray the cholesterol and the calories right out of that stuff and then you come after years of horrible eating and say i've got heart disease of a kidney disease i've got this i've got that pray for me brother donnie that the lord would deliver me oh he can deliver you you believe that don't you but he might start with your diet as my wife says amen really loud but you see there's there's merit to this lord help me but i throw myself in the branch what kind of fruit did i it bear these signs shall follow them that believe now i'm going to close here i've still got too much more but i just want to remind some of you maybe you saw this maybe you haven't but quite a few years ago brother danny steeman was preaching down in louisiana at the camp he wanted to make a point about signs and wonders you know that's making another run through the message people are like well i just you know this just isn't producing what i thought it would and uh we don't see signs and wonders we're not seeing miracles we're not seeing you know tongues spoken or we're not seeing these things and we're starting to question this we don't know is something wrong well i like how brother danny stevens put it he chose a couple of young boys from the church and i almost was going to be brave enough to choose some children but brother brother danny he's he's a preacher in a way there and he says the problem with you guys is you are there you're thinking that signs and wonders is what proves the word of god proves the message but he said that's not it that's a promise from god himself that's not a promise from william branham that's not a promise from whoever is the pastor of this church that is a promise from god himself and the problem is is that we start going and we're moving through life here and we keep looking back to see if we have some signs and wonders but i liked how brother danny said it he spoke to these boys you can hear him he says now you know brothers you follow me no matter where i go or what i do you follow me and so this two young brothers are like yes sir and brother danny he's there and uh and he's at the at the camp and he goes down through the congregation and these two boys are following and he's preaching while he's going you see and now he says you know it's by faith and and do i need to stop and say now by faith look back and see if signs and wonders are following no god said they would i don't have to confirm it that's god's job to confirm it and brother danny then wandered through the whole church and these two young boys just following right behind him he says you see the signs and wonders would follow them that believe and he does not say if you stop and check it out it doesn't say if it's convenient for you he said that the signs and the wonders would follow the true believer and so my brother and sister we don't live for signs and wonders we live for jesus christ the signs and the wonders become part of our experience they are not what defines our experience they are not what it is but the devil has come in and he's put reasoning in there and we say but we're not seeing a great this and we're not seeing a great that and so i don't know if it's true or not no what we're going to do is say the word said the word said the word said and the quotes that i was going to read to you goes by and you'll see jesus christ never come my brother and sister he had all power and all authority amen even on the cross at the snap as it were of a finger and he let them crucify him why because i needed reading amen you needed redeemed and he caught the picture do we have the idea that it was just almost like an act and he went through it no big deal no my brother and sister when you read as i have just read what they did in the crucifixion of where they placed the spike you know why they placed it where they placed it well one that the word of god would be fulfilled but they placed it right between those two bones so that when they hung them it would be all of the cartilage and all the tendons and all the muscle would hold the weight so it wouldn't tear the hand off many depicted that it was there like out by his fingers no they had this down to a science but it also fulfilled scripture that not one bone would be broken amen and when they were there to say hey we got to get this over with we need to do this let's break his legs they went up there they pierced him with the spear and said oh he's already dead now my brother and sister if god thought it through enough to bring you and i to a place that his precious blood could redeem us oh my goodness i just was reading no doubt many of you have recently i don't know brother branham walks into that little cafe sees that young girl and then boys kind of loving on her looks over here and here's grandma with a couple old men loving on him and here's a policeman over here gambling and righteous indignation now don't look at me like you've never felt this way come on saints we've looked at people and thought them poor sorry sinners the prophet of god's thinking that and the holy spirit he steps off around that corner and he sees the world and he sees all of that vision coming forth oh that's the sins of the world no william branham that's your sin oh my brother and sister look what god has done amen he took the reasoning out of the word that you and i could look right in the word and say i would be lost i would be lost without him and the word is my redemption and jesus there in that time he had all power at the snap of a finger at a word all of those things would be bound and he would be loosed but he had he had the power within him to hold back and let the word be fulfilled you realize that's as much power my brother and sister as it would be to cast them and bind them and lose himself is this as much power for him to stop and say i'm not doing this for me i'm doing this for paul put your name in there i'm doing this for them even in the garden i'm closing sister emmy come that'll force me to even in the garden do you realize the stress and the strain that he went through was so much that blood they have a medical term for that blood popping out the pores not coming from the nose eyes ears mouth such tremendous strain blood popping out of the pores how much blood does it take to forgive our sins [Music] swan drop one drop one drop saying do you realize he was already redeeming us had already redeemed us before he ever made it to the cross to be crucified and he knew that in his flesh it would be easier to walk away but he knew that if he did you and i would be reasoned away i'm just paraphrasing some of these quotes that i won't get to he knew if he didn't do that you and i could be reasoned away from the word in this day because he made such an absolute statement and it had such a prophetic and profound effect upon you and i will look at that and say he loved me when i couldn't even love myself he loved me when no one loved me and i'm gonna love him in return you see what kind of fruit did it bear you're the kind of fruit that it's bury hallelujah you love the lord today my [Music] you know when you you just know when you've taken too much food oh well i had great pleasure in studying it but we'll stop right here hallelujah my brother and sister you want a little homework 62 0701 take on the whole armor of god [Music] brother and paragraph 42 talks about he never used his power yet he was god manifested in flesh he just took it is written now that's something you and i can do amen hallelujah oh my let's have full confidence in the word let's just stand and sing a song brother jason just help me hallelujah i'd like to sing that song i'm not even sure the words that just come to me in in my studies here we are in your presence amen you don't know the verse just the chorus well we'll just start with the chorus amen amen no is that it in your presence no yes there we are lifting holy hands god bless you saints i just i hope it made sense this morning sometimes you just study the word and things just start tying together you know you might call it a spider web because you got here you tied this to this you tied this to this even brother branham talks about this i come across the quote where he's talking about this and then pretty soon you find yourself branching off over here and you're like no i need to go back but you don't go anywhere you just go straight across the thought and put another branch on this is the word of god it's alive it's real my brother and sister not a dead letter we're not going to get up there and give you any old dead you know amens this is a living word hallelujah the living word makes people excited hallelujah hallelujah [Music] here we are in your presence lifting holy hands hallelujah [Applause] praising jesus for the things he's brought us through let's sing it again [Music] here we are in your presence lifting holy hands too here we are praising jesus for the things he's brought us through [Laughter] break every chain hallelujah amen aren't you glad we get to leave free today we are not caught my brother and sister in a dead letter brother branham several places but he speaks this he says i challenge you to show me one place in the bible were they baptized in the name of the father son holy spirit but i can prove to you by the word what we're preaching amen that's what i want i want proof my brother and sister i don't want a hypothesis i don't want a theory i want truth i want the proof of the word now you say now what are you saying paul that we've got to prove it to you yes i'm saying it's got to be proven to me but i'm telling you god uses some unique ways to prove it to us he lets us get sick so he can heal us he lets us get discouraged so he can lift us up he lets us get broke so he can become our provider but we don't like none of those things we'd like it just to show up it reminds me of time brother rich call forgive me just take a moment brother rich cobb his dad working full-time in the ministry they got so broke they literally had nothing a little bit of milk in a jug and not even enough milk or cold cereal to feed the children nothing in their house brother cobb tells the children debbie and rich write down what you would like to eat if you are given anything you wanted oh my goodness to a child we've got it brother rich wrote it even down i want it down to the quarter inch thick cut bacon they started praying knock on the door no one's there bags of groceries [Music] look at that we got it cold cereal we got this we got this we got this we got exact bacon that's on the list now tell me god doesn't know what you need and he actually sometimes just deals in the realm of what we would like him to do [Music] it's not life or death [Music] not really going to make any difference he just grants it to us because we ask him as sons and daughters of god can we say amen to that today [Music] there is power in the name of jesus there is power in the name of jesus there is power in the name of jesus to break every chain break every

in your life that is causing you not to trust him you've got to get it out say but brother paul it was painful it's all right the pain you experience over there will be nothing to compare to the joy of the deliverance of the outpouring of the holy spirit in your life or we can hold on to our past we can hold on to our pain we can hold on to our hurts we can hold on do you realize my brother and sister [Music] if you can't move away from whatever the circumstance of your life was that caused you not to trust god if you can't move to that you're not how do i say this [Music] lord you're a slave [Music] you're a slave you're slave to a circumstance some person's words an emotion a season you're a slave to that i'm telling you god's in the yoke breaking business problem is sometimes

husband for wives for children for church for deliverance for brothers and sisters and no not hope amen we prayed for our sister this morning i would pray there wouldn't be just and one even just hope
