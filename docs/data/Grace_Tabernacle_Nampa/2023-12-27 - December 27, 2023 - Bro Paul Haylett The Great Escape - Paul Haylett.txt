and uh God bless you Sister Gabriel I trust you had a good trip amen you know it's just uh such a privilege my brothers and sisters to serve the Lord we sometimes just need to have interaction with others around us in the world to just really recognize truly how blessed we are it uh we we sometimes I think as humans we we tend to adapt we get used to a certain thing and uh we kind of forget really where we're at and uh how easy it is uh to to just come to uh without the proper approach appreciation come to just expect and in the right context that is good and um out of context we just don't appreciate what God's doing for us anyway we just want to say thank you for God's grace and mercy each one of you tonight and um we want to remember um our young people in the church those right here in the body we have such a lovely group of young people and we want to remember those that are out side of the body amen that we know God has has done things in their life we know God has spoke to them uh but Satan has painted such a picture that they uh have different different things that hinder them and hold them back and we want to keep them in prayer just once again a reminder uh that um next Sunday evening uh we put 6: PM as the official time but you can come before and uh we're definitely looking forward to um uh you know songs and worship and um special songs that would be there and seem how there's not a lot of us some of you ought to just prepare for a couple songs amen I know Brother David throw you under the bus here you mentioned a all back about something stirring your heart about singing so I I just wonder uh if you can be here well we'll pray you can be here and we'll pray that God anoints you with a song Amen so let's just turn uh in our Bibles this evening God bless you our musicians uh and uh everyone and uh I want to speak to you tonight on The Great Escape and uh you know there has been a lot of worldly versions of the Great Escape but the bride amen God has made a way for her she is going to make her Great Escape and I I look forward to that my heart longs for the day that we just you might say make the Great Escape but we have to put that in the right context because in essence we're not just trying to escape this world but uh we'll just take it back to our scripture Hebrews the 2 chapter verses 1-4 today amen therefore we ought to give the more en Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast in every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him now we need to stop and just Analyze That for just a moment these things that God spoke was confirmed unto us so there was a I'm going to use the word intermediary someone in the middle God spoke it someone heard it and they confirmed it unto us amen amen aren't you glad amen we're not sitting here with just a random idea of God sent a prophet amen but it was confirmed unto us that we would know this is what God has spoken God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will Heavenly Father we just ask you lord to bless the service tonight speak to our hearts father it's touched me already Lord just to know your presence Lord Lord sometimes father we we just get so caught up in the things of life that we miss the very Simplicity of which you come to us and speak to us and lift us up we ask you father to help us Lord not to miss that Simplicity but to recognize you in all things in our Our Lives bless this body of Believers bless the prayer requests and the needs Lord we ask in your precious name amen hallelujah you may be seated Amen to each one I know that would desire to be here tonight but we don't see just pray God comes and Deals kindly with each and every one of us now as we look at this I want to focus on the third verse how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation And I think it's very clear saints that uh this uh not escaping in other words not getting out of here and neglecting our Salvation directly connected together so some will have amen a word from the Lord some will have an unction to act upon the word but they will be things that hinder them from taking the steps that are NE necessary and we know that if anything is neglected it will will deteriorate and uh you know I just remember kind of telling myself that many years ago um I wasn't really serving the Lord with all my heart I was very much focused on on be business and and farming and Etc and you know you would find that there would be things that you would do and I'm going to use a very simple analogy you would lean a shovel against a post or somewhere uh and in your busyness forgot that you had put that sh there and by the time you ReDiscover the the shovel all the varnish has weathered from the handle and it's all checked and roughed and the weakness uh the strength of the handle has faded from it and you're afraid then to use the shovel to its F full potential because it's no longer has the Integrity it did and and it's all because it wasn't the shovels fault it was all because we neglected it and did not take care of what was there I think that simple analogy would register with us amen that uh stewardship would be another way to look at that so if we uh would uh neglect this great salvation amen then it's telling us you'll be able to look and see why that uh we did not escape and I don't know about you but I was not called to sit here and stay in this world Amen not called to face a judgment that come when God said just judge yourself and come and bring your heart and soul before me and I will be judged to forgive you amen how simple is that that he would be just to forgive us if we just bring those things and so I say just in a simple context tonight let's just stop and look in our life and if there's things that are there let's just make sure that we're taking care and not neglecting uh and bringing these things together amen as we'll look at this we'll see that it is uh God's Army uh is in a preparation time aren't you glad there's a prep preparation amen there's a preparation time and she will not and now hear me through this because it is kind of a a connective thought here she will not neglect that's right we can go as far as to say she cannot neglect now it seems sometimes that we would have things that we have neglected but my brother and sister we can be buffeted by uh and I don't even know if this is a real word it didn't correct it so I'm assuming it actually is a word but we can be neglectful and we can fall under a neglectful spirit that we would stop one day and realize you know there's certain things in my life that I I used to do or I know I should do kind of iniquity and that we would be and God is so loving he's so kind to us that he doesn't then judge us for that my brother and sister he draws our attention to it he he reminds us in this Midnight Hour through the preaching of the word listening to the prophet uh through music he reminds us that there are things in our life that we are neglecting at the moment and so it's there that I would say in in a confidence today that in this preparation time we would look and be able to say I have neglected some of these duties of the Lord but God is mindful to come because he knows that you cannot be neglectful and take a full salvation into Redemption that Mak sense to you amen ever been buffeted by a neglectful Spirit oh I I think every one of us would have to be honest and say that but look my brother and sister what God does is he by the spirit moves and stirs up our minds into remembrance this is what the preaching of the word does sometimes people get a little bit like well it seems like the preacher tonight is preaching towards me my brother and sister that's God just reach ing down by his grace and mercy down from glory and stirring up your pure mind and Satan doesn't like that he's trying to push back don't that he's preaching at you yes he is because it's God saying you've been neglectful and I don't want you to be neglectful because you cannot forsake such a great salvation that God has given us amen and so while we're buffeted by this neglectful Spirit the spirit of God the holy spirit is coming down taking the word and stirring us into remembrance now my brother and sister the word cannot fall on infertile ground and you you know we might say well well that's not scriptural but my brother and sister we're not talking to the unbeliever the makeb believer the Heathen we're talking to the bride of Christ and the word cannot fall on unfertile ground in your life every seed that God deposits in your life God knew it would bring forth amen and so we have to then sometimes it's hard you know I find Farm some ground that when I'm farming out there on that ground I plant in the spring I slow weigh down with the planter because there's so many rocks not defying The Parables of scripture but I'm telling you even in a rocky situations of your life and God will slow down if you'll just follow me in this thought God will slow down because he knows that seed was intended for you and that planter will then do its job even when it's bouncing and skitting and screeching through the rocks and the stand of corn or beans or wheat will be just as good in that Rocky ground because the effort was taken to get the seed in the ground Amen in our hard Stony heart sometimes we would just be at a stage of our life and we might even acknowledge to ourselves I don't know that this service tonight is really going to do me any good it seems like the brothers preaching too straight too too hard and I don't know if I can receive it but the holy spirit will just bring everything down and let that seed make it down into the fertile soul of a son or daughter of God and it will bring forth fruit God knew what he was doing that's why we should never be in a hurry let me put it this way I'm not I'm not uh this is going to be blunt but it's not about how long we preach sometimes but sometimes in the blowing down it takes time we can't just rush through church sometimes God's got to get the seed down in the fertile soil we become so conscious of time like I said I'm not justifying a long- winded preacher like myself but sometimes we get so caught up in time we need to hurry through this and then it only brings forth 40-fold and we wonder why well I figured that out not trying to go into a gromy lesson here tonight but I figure that out every moment even in the Rocky times are you with me in the Rocky times every moment of my busy life that I give up to let the seed settle down I had ground I used to say you know this ground's just never going to produce a crop but did you know that once I slowed down and made sure the seed actually made it in the ground that ground produces and sometimes our old hard Rocky Hearts we just need to let God have time that's right that something would come forth amen so the spirit is stirring up pure Minds my brother and sister different people different results you know we can look in the world we live in today and and uh you know you can look and say well I see something happening over here I see something happening over there and it seems like this has got a little revival going on it seems like they're doing a little Revival but if we'll take the time to stop and see the seed that God has planted in us we would recognize Revival is right here in our midst because we have to come down to the definition of Revival that is God's definition not the world's definition the world's definition needs that people need to Shout Scream run jump hard do whatever God's Revival my brother and sister is the holy spirit moving down in us and stirring our Pure minds and bringing to to us a cognizant awareness of a living God in us and then we can recognize God's Reviving me again and that means you can have a one person Revival yes sir you don't have to have a whole church it doesn't have to be a multitude of reaction it can be God stirring one heart one soul to react to the word of God and that is a Revival you notice when brother brandom preaches about the Welsh Revival that man that policeman with the billy club he doesn't give them any directions to a building to a movement to a place that man had Revelation I am the revival can we say that tonight I am the Revival amen it doesn't have to be a great movement over here it doesn't need to make it to social media doesn't need to make it to a billboard the Revival is in you and I and God is coming and putting a Revival in our midst amen Les we become distracted to the things of this world you know I want to say thank you Lord for stirring the bride amen you know sometimes you'll see something and somebody will ask you know what is the bride's Revival recently saw a little a little deal somebody was like is there going to be a bride's Revival now I believe they were asking that in more of a rhetorical kind of question but I'm here to tell you tonight the bride is in Revival absolutely amen she's being stirred by the Holy Spirit each and every day her life is being brought into line with the presence of almighty God with a life that is poured out of the word she's having a Revival my brother and sister and we don't have to advertise it we don't have to run up and down down the streets the prophet of God in fact said it won't be a public show amen that's getting pretty close to home if you can have a Revival and people won't necessarily around you even know you're having a revival can you bring a thought in your mind looking back and say I've experienced that God has spoke to me God has dealt with me God has turned my heart and brought these things out to me and we don't have to then write a journal and publish it it was meant for the bride amen amen collectively when we come together as the bride of Christ there will be energy in that but my brother and sister what God's doing is selecting his own bride he's not selecting the church he's not selecting the movement not selecting the country he's selecting the individual and the individual can be in a full-blown Revival and the world doesn't even recognize it right and it's there that the word has come because it's not an outward stirring of a church as in Revival but a stirring of the innermost part of our soul that God is bringing us to that place I say this is what the bride's Revival is this is when the bride who maybe gets a little too busy and God then stirs her pure mind and she realizes you know the devil is distracting me and she comes right back maybe a little something creeps into our life and we don't even realize it till the word comes and reveals it to us and we are stirred by that and come back in line with the word we want to please God my brother and sister there is not some magic formula for pleasing God we arranged the furniture just studying this week brother bradam says it's not how you set up the church it's not the flowers on the pulpit took it back to Cain and Abel it's not those things that's not what pleases God it's Sons and Daughters of God who desire to be aligned with the word of God that's what pleases God I say tonight I want to please gone I want my life to be in line with him because when my life is in line with him he then keeps me in line I just ask you what will the bride's Revival look like do we have a pattern we must put over it to say this is the bride's Revival what you're doing here is not that's not that's not this is no my brother and sister you realize a bride revival can actually be different for you than it is for me oh no we're not talking about changing the word talking about expression we sang it tonight sometimes hallelu sometimes praise the Lord everybody's got to a different expression I pray tonight we're all in a Revival I pray tonight that we're not sitting here saying I'm hoping for a Revival but we can say I'm in a Revival God restoring strength back to me wisdom back to me the word back to me amen cleansing my life washing me the water of the word each and every day and I'm telling you there's Sons and Daughters of God that are the less vocal they're just as much in Revival as those that are extreme vocal because the vocal does not determine the Revival that's right how loud we speak does not determine Revival that's right amen I know a lot of grandmothers in this message hardly would hear them say Amen but their life is evidence there's a Revival in the land their life is evidenced that God's word is manifesting to a world today amen quietly just living the word there's Revival amen you see there's a deep stirring taking place in this Bride Can Can you agree with me tonight a deep stirring God just dealing with us on an individual level sitting reading our Bible studying the message on our own level maybe not even a public uh thing not not a church element not even Bible studies or prayer meetings or whatever but God stirring the hearts of Sons and Daughters of God because in the stirring of the word it is like the spring that is washing all the Twigs all of the little leaves all of the little things the little grasshopper the little whatever is all being washed out you notice that running water never produces a mosquito right amen living water doesn't produce blood suckers no living water my brother and sister cleanses itself in the Stream doesn't need man to cleanse it it cleanses itself and as we're washed in the water of the word we are actually my brother and sister having Revival as we're Washed by the Water of the word that doesn't mean we jump up and Shout Scream and holler but we're being Washed by the Water of the word and in evidence of that the prophet of God said of those six evidences that he speaks readily about having the Holy Ghost is one of those is is hearing believing and acting on the word we often get times and I'm not criticizing I'm not don't misunderstand me but we were looking for all these actions to have evidence of the Holy Ghost and the prophet of God said believing acting on it amen is a sign of having the holy ghost that means we don't have to jump run Shout Scream holler we don't have to do Extreme as it is but we can just be that quiet Revival taking place in our church in our neighborhood in our family amen amen there's a deep stirring though I believe I see it taking place in this brine the world may not see anything what they see is a woman a lady long hair dressed appropriate modest and they tend to kind of look at you like where did you come from where what what rock did you climb out from underneath that's what the world sees but what God sees and the rest of the bride of Christ sees is a very evidence of someone believing the word and I'm not talking about a leg legalistic form of this I'm talking about something coming from a sister's heart this is who I am this is what I believe and this is what I will manifest or live and you see then the evidence of the Holy Ghost coming forward bringing forth fruit and then the world don't even really know what they're looking at they see a woman they see young ladies they see all of this they don't understand it but they see it now one of the things that the prophet of God showed us my brother and sister he said we are not required to explain it that's right we're required to live it that's right so as we just live it we're having a Revival we literally are having a Revival as we live it oh you know the devil come along and say well you make mistakes yes of course it does it happens it's there it's present with us but you got to remember my brother and sister what God Said was perfect is perfect amen some people might look and say that house is unfinished God looks it as a finished work amen it doesn't matter what they think the Revival the finishing the stirring the completion the finality is that where God put it not what the devil put amen and the devil tries to make us align to his definitions Amen brother Brown talks about us having uh you know speaking negatively that we're speaking the devil's language so we understand the devil's got his own language and we got to be careful we're not speaking the devil's language Lord help us to speak your language cuz the devil will tell you you're not you're a failure you're this you're that you're that brother Bram defines that and says that's the devil's language and we're not called to do that amen see the devil he knows he's heard the word he he can quote it better than we can and the world doesn't even know what is stirring in this Pride because you see it's revealed by Revelation and Revelation alone that's right without revelation we wouldn't see the stirring from the simple word but with revelation we see great Mysteries being revealed in the day that we live in the the the naysayers and those that are critics my brother and sister may have things I I just was reading today and and you know it reminded me of a conversation that I'd had and and somebody tried to imply that uh you know know if you don't believe William brandom's message then you're not going to make it but here's the prophet in bold print saying the only thing that matters is the Gospel of Jesus Christ now what voice are we going to listen to what Revival Revival of who we were you know that's what it is we're either going forward or we're going backwards and Satan's trying to come up with his own Revival but his Revival and we'll tie this in in a little bit his own Revival comes with uncertainties and doubts and fears and all of these things and my brother and sister that's that's his gospel now in the greatest battle ever fought brother Brenham says here he says and so an Army first so an Army first in getting ready for a battle first there's got to be a select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting and I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go in action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers Can someone say thank you Lord amen amen been selecting his soldiers and I believe he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth much more complex than the average person really grasp and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings this my brother and sister now pardon me for tying this together but this is a thought that comes to me the prophet of God speaks to us that you don't have to worry about as it is where did a thought come from this fail this this thought come you just don't let the bird build a nest amen and this sin fell out of heaven and it's falling sin is falling right here leoa and Satan is still the debris if you would bear with me the debris is still falling Landing in our thoughts and Landing in our emotions and all of these things the prophet of God talked about and there Comes A Time For Us simply not to let the sin that is still falling to settle and take root on us it don't mean you won't have a thought won't have an emotion won't have an action but you don't have to let it stay there amen there's a merciful thought from the Lord amen cast out of Heaven fell on human beings then the battle from Angels become human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself was he talking about the pine trees was he talking about flowers destroying the flowers destroying the pine trees destroying that where is the true measure of God's creation we were created to be his bride amen we were created to be his helpmate we were created to fulfill the very thing that God longed for and that was to be worshiped not worshiped by some beetles kind of Christian band my brother and sister not kind of some beatnick kind of approach to God W with the you know flashing lights and all of the robust presentation that's not what it's looking for we the bride of Jesus Christ Christ were created to fulfill that part of Jesus Christ that he longed for and that was a wife and we as in the human element long for someone to be our mate someone that that fits with us someone that is of our nature helps us gives us Comfort gives us peace and God long for you can I say that strong enough God longed for you hard for us sometimes to grasp the idea that God was longing for your fellow Fellowship longing for my fellowship but God longed for you and made you who you are to satisfy a certain portion of who he is that's right otherwise he would have just chose bride literally out of the millions or hundreds of millions or whatever on the Earth today he'd have just selected one but he chose a Min member body that he calls the bride of Christ because there was aspects that was in him there was attributes that were in him and he wanted to satisfy that and he wanted his desire to be expressed not just here in NPA Idaho he wanted to be expressed all over the Earth my brother and sister this bride in the natural she would not be able in the natural to satisfy going each and every place to present amen a living Bride for a living God but my brother and sister he placed a many membered body out there and put in them the same attributes righten that's why you can get off of of plane on another continent you can walk through the doors of a building or the doors of a house in a few minutes you know your home because they have the same exact spirit amen it's not their spirit it's not your spirit it's his spirit and he poured that into us that we would have that characteristic amen amen you guys are quiet tonight amen Satan came to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy this and that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle begin here on Earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since Can someone say Amen to that now before anybody any battle can be put in a ra they first have to choose a meeting ground or place where the battle to be fought a selected place and we know and I'm not going to go on and quote all of this for you but we know what the prophet showed us brought out by Revelation that the mind was the battle place was the Battle Ground that was selected for this age and that's why an intellectual gospel is such a a a a trap for people that when they can come and and quote and explain they feel like they've got it but my brother and sister God said I don't need an INT ual wife I need a wife that loves me amen I need a wife that wants to live the way I want her to live I want her to be my wife amen and I thank God that the word has come there's some soldiers been selected if you'd feel like it tonight maybe you could lift a hand and say thank you Lord for selecting me we've been dressed we've been trained you can go back in paragraph 161 take these words out of it there I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them and training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start amen I believe this is what's taking place my brother and sister and you know sometimes I just want to say this we don't feel like it's a privilege to be selected because we're facing many great challenges and battles and struggles have you ever thought before like why me certainly I'm not the only one here why me Lord why do I have to go through this battle well God chose you for that battle because he knows you'll overcome that battle amen you're not going to find anywhere in scripture where God chose His People to fail he's always chose them to be victorious to be Overcomers he's always chose them to rise up above the situation that's how God has chose his people right as the prophet has explained amen predestination to us it's not god making us do it but God looking down through time and saying there's my seed that's it there's the life I'm talking about and wherever my life is there is overcoming power and people Rise Up from that why do you believe I had a man once that was walking away from the message was a friend of mine and he kept saying but there's this and there's this and I said and and this and this and you know he said this here and and and one year later he said this and they counter dict each other and I said I'm sorry that that doesn't matter to me well how can it not matter because he introduced me to Jesus Christ is what he said his job was well why do you believe I can't answer that I just do yeah I just do and maybe my own mind and eyes can read and see the very contradiction they're talking about on the page here and on a page here that it seems like it's opposed to each other but my brother and sister it wasn't that I was looking for a perfect Prophet I was looking for the word that a prophet bought and that brought and the word is perfect amen amen we're not going to receive mail at our house anymore more because our mailman that delivers it is not perfect doesn't make sense does it people looking for perfect when it's the message Jesus Christ that is the perfect one amen amen you can have an imperfect look what history says about some of these ministers that brother brandom talks about some of them would preach Mighty Services people being saved and they would go in such a dark tunnel they get drunk afterwards man I don't want to hear the gospel preached by them but he led many to the Lord does that make the word that he preached to them flawed flawed vessel not a flawed word amen amen so this battle that was chosen you know sometimes well let me just put it this way if in choose instead of choosing the Mind as a battle place maybe we think it'd be simpler if it chose some other battle maybe the heart but you'd get tired of walking around holding that Shield over your heart all the time you'd complain about that too Achilles out of what Greek mythology or whatever if he'd had known an arrow in the heel would have killed him he would have took a whole different stance but my brother and sister it wouldn't matter about all of those things you can take examples you want but God knew that this battle in the mind was already settled don't be afraid of the battle in the mind don't be afraid of what is going to take place and how Satan's trying to anoint this battle in your mind remember and recognize this battle is already finished amen God declared that you are already Victorious that you already were the winner and all you had to do is trust him so it's really not a battle in the mind it's a battle of trust amen Satan trying to get us not to trust and God declaring to us trust me amen you have a battle in the mind you feel like you lost it the Lord Jesus amen our great king is over here you've already overcome trust me now I didn't bring that in my notes but brother brand I'm speaking about that and just studying that today amen he's talking about that how it comes down to this place that God allowed the mind to be chosen but whatever that it would have been chosen you would still be victorious because he said you would be amen hallelujah now I like this also in greatest battle ever fought amen we look at this and it says now Hallelujah do we have a Hallelujah tonight Hallelujah we got a festar general called Jesus placing five stars on us f a i t h Faith he's never lost a battle Hallelujah he conquered death hell in the grave get the Devils out of the way amen look at this my brother and sister when's the last time when you had a bad day that you just said you know what devil I'm sorry to ignore you but I've got faith my general told me I've got faith and you know what Satan it sure appears that you've kicked me around I've been your bean bag today but I'm sorry I'm going to ignore you because I I've got faith amen my general gave me Faith you know I remember that well I love history many times through history there would be soldiers in the trenches and the and the uh the holes and hiding behind the trees and the stumps and and they don't they don't feel like we can't hold out any longer they'd maybe be on the radio we can't hold out any longer we need to retreat and then one man with faith would come and say now look over here they've got no one guarding this point go attack that point but but no go and when they would go the enemy it turns out couldn't cover that area and they made their objective and when they made that objective the enemy said we're threatened and the enemy themselves start to pull back because they're threatened and then when they pulled back it gave opportunity for other soldiers are you with me tonight other soldiers to move up and occupy place this is why the body of Believers is necessary we're not called to be solo cuz when my faith is weak your faith is strong and when your faith is weak my faith is strong and when we're afraid to move forward God sends a great General in our midst that says Rise Up take the land you are more than able this is why it's not about how great a Christian we are but it's being knit into the body of beli Bel vers into the word of God and it being knit into us and in our hour of desperation what does he do my brother and sister he comes and stirs up our Pure Minds in remembrance and we remember wait I've already won the victory my general has declared Us Victorious I'm an overcomer and it's come yesterday you look back and say it was a bad day but today you got up in the morning maybe a midnight prayer with tears running down your face and you're saying oh Lord why did I say that why did I act like that what was a why Lord and you wake up in the morning and you've got courage and you've got faith because God has come in the Midnight Hour to remind you you're more than an overcomer you can conquer this whatever spirit is bothering you might be a lying Spirit might be a lost Spirit might be a a doubting or fear Spirit God says it doesn't matter I come to overcome that and you will overcome that because I am in you I didn't leave when you had that bad thought I didn't leave when you kind of tempered the truth a little I didn't leave you in this circumstance or that circumstance I'm here for you amen sorry I'm getting excited tonight that's right Hallelujah I try not to get this excited at home because my office is small and I don't want have to rebuild it amen but I tell you my brother and sister this great Chief captain so the devil isn't even the picture what would our days be like if we just realize the devil's not even in our picture right sure change life wouldn't it right sure change our perspective you know I've Heard It Through The Years A lot of people say well forgive me for being so grumpy today I got out of the wrong side of the bed push that bed against the wall give yourself one way out of that bed get out on the good side see we can offer all kinds of excuse well actually we're not offering it the Satan's there speaking on our behalf this is why you're not a Victorious Christian this is why you're not an overcomer this is why you can't seem to hold on to Victory yeah you're right seems like every time we have a great move now it might not be you guys but I I'll just be open enough to tell you it happens to me all the time we'll have a wonderful awesome experience at church and for sure the devil's right outside the door to give you the bad news right remind you you're not in Heavenly places you're a human you're carinal well that's not what the word says that's right but you see what happens is is the word seems to flee from us reminds me of a story in the Vietnam War there was I believe a colonel been assigned to I I don't remember what size a group of men they were back East where the I think maybe Georgia Carolina humidity was terrible all kinds of bugs in the woods and he trained his men until they literally were talking about we are going to frat size or however they say that you know we're going to put a grenade under his bunk we're going to do something get rid of this guy but none of them had quite the courage because he used to look at him and say I know what you're thinking and he trained him and trained him and trained him until they all practically hated him they got to Vietnam in the jungles and they I'm just going to to call it unit because I don't remember just how big a group it was and one of the lowest stood the fiercest of combat and had one of the lowest rates of of uh um my brain just went dead casualties one of the lowest rates of casualties and in this writing they interviewed many soldiers that were in his deal when they come back from Vietnam and many of these men years later when they would see him with with tears running down their face and they would introduce a wife and children and grandchildren and say I'd have none of this if it hadn't been for you training us look you get to be my age my brother and sister and we look back and see the grace of God that we have children and we have grandchildren serving God and we would not have that if it hadn't been for God training us showing us the way to be Overcomers oh Lord help us amen help us Lord amen he's a great Chief Captain so the devil isn't even in the picture amen what place are we being called to the place where we believe every word we can say we believe every word are you with me tonight am I being too too rough on you my brother and sister we we talk about I believe every word but then we get in the battle and it really shows whether we believe every word right Hallelujah I mean we hear the testimonies wonderful testimonies I got my own testimony of losing my wallet once in Albuquerque New Mexico calling the wife in the middle of the night I've got a disaster all my fuel money credit cards driver's license medical cards all I've lost it can't find it God standing on his word a promise where the Prophet God talks about pocketknife and in the middle of the night I got desperate and got down and just cried tears Lord forgive me for my lack of faith my brother and sister at wallet went home with me amen it wasn't lost and found or some thief in a garbage can or something that wallet Come Back to Me by the grace of God and it's not us it's him but we have to learn to trust him amen and he brings us to a place that he's proving whether we believe every word or not oh I tell you it can be hard it can be bitter it might cause you to have great tears great sorrow but God is faithful amen if we'll trust him he'll perform now I'm going to move forward in questions and answers here amen we want to believe every word now this might be confusing and I hope it isn't to you but um I've been accused of having a terrible habit of cherry-picking quotes and that's exactly what I did right here is I cherry-picked this quote right out so now it's question and answers and people are asking a marriage and divorce question but it's not about marriage and divorce that got my attention it was the words that the prophet of God says now they're saying should I come and be married again and he says if you wish to but this is where I want to start if you don't mind my cherry picking don't have nothing in your mind that bothers your faith amen because if anything's there you can go no further than right there amen you stop right there when that question mark come that's where you end right there but now for me and then he's going back to marriage and divorce it would be all right I want to ask how many times have we come to the place of the question that's right you didn't run out to the movies you weren't drinking liquor you weren't doing all kinds of things that we might describe as Sin but the prophet of God says you stopped right there look how clever Satan is bring us to a place that a question mark in our mind stops us from moving forward into the deeper things of God somebody says well well you know we don't believe in that puts question mark there that's all Satan's got to do we go no further I don't know if any of you been there I've been there I've been there where I realized I was just so to speak parked on the side of the road going no further don't have nothing in your mind that bothers your faith what does that mean means you got to cast down imagination you got to cast down emotion you got to cast down intellectual understanding a lot of things we have to cast down that are there to hinder us going forward right but God come to deliver now I'm going to put this if you don't mind me switching directions here real quick remember that guy named L got moved down there got him a nice you might say little Mansion right there on the street and sod him life was good he was a man of authority a position it put his wife in a position not a bad position a good position as far as the world thought and you know God speaks to lot the Angels come and tell him to leave Lot's wife never put that question to rest she's there the Angels literally have to push her out of town now I hope you can move this over into the other side of the equation the Angels basically have to push her out of town drag her out of town and because she actually never settled the question of whether the word that came to her was God's word or not you really that's what it come down to Saints it wasn't about how how nice a house she had nice clothes she had and position in church and this that and the other she came down whether she believed this really was God's word or not right and you know as she went out of town we're going back now to our title The Great Escape she never got that question put to rest and as she's now on her way to escape really what happened was is this is Paul's text don't take it as some kind of Doctrine but you see because she never settled it she was looking back trying to find an answer why couldn't God just let me stay here why can't I just continue to live in Sodom we've never heard of a whole city going up in fire a pastor down at the first church says she's caught in this battle in her mind because she had no absolute she had no answer she just kind of was like okay come on Saints I'll just be honest with you I sat in church in years past heard the preaching of the word and said to myself that's their opinion only to find out later in my life that wasn't their opinion that was the word and I was questioning the word because I had no answer and I voted for the side of I sure miss Sodom but God rich in mercy God rich in Mercy never let me get turned completely back to look and while she's trying to find a balance in her life she stops against the command of an angel of God and looks back and they're certain that that pillar of salt on the side of that mountain is her the time the place everything why a Time tested Memorial don't look back don't look back don't look back look forward if God sent you forward then he's made the way for you to go forward he doesn't open the door for you to go forward to have you pry the door open to go back amen when God calls us forward let's go forward amen and so it's there we look at this amen she she never put that question to rest and I say to young and old here tonight we need to settle the question we either are going to believe and trust God's word or we're going to always be looking back trying to figure out what did I leave behind what opportunity I'll tell you about a young man in Chile he's a very handsome young man very athletic young man I mean very athletic and he he was raised up in Venezuela and and his dad was a pastor in a message Church in venezuel and this young man incredibly gifted soccer player and as he was playing his way up through at you know his young age he was being invited to go up two or three levels in the league to play and here he is amongst guys way taller than him but he was fast he was Nimble he he was accurate and and they kept boosting him and moving him and moving him and he come up at the college level and one day a man comes and and says we want before you get out here and everybody has a shot at you we want you to come to Spain now if you guys know anything about soccer you know who plays in Spain it's called Madrid and they took him there and they showed him everything a house an apartment a car and under the rules that there is certain caps and stuff none of this belongs to you none of it's a gift to you but uh this little piece of plastic will buy anything you want and gasoline and this and that and this position now these are the words they spoke to him and this position will get you all the women in your life that you want he toured the facilities they whed and dined he goes home but he had a father that was settled in the word had his mind made up had the courage to look his son in the face face and tell him if you take that contract you will never serve God he struggled over that they kept asking for an answer and he kept telling them I don't have an answer yet you need to give us an answer you need to give us an answer need to give us an answer we'll tell you what we'll do we'll keep you in the Venezuelan League here which was a very elite league right below the pros we'll keep you here for a while so you can kind of untie yourself from your family and all this stuff it happens all the time no problem and and and he was there struggling over that and his father's words echoing in his mind and he woke up one day and said I have to serve God I have to you know what they told him when he told them he wasn't accepting it they said you are insane you're going to go to church and serve God instead of wealth and women you're insane who's the crazy one what happened God settled that Amen in his heart amen that was settled that was finished no amount no amount of money he was in Spain on that trip they were just just stuffing handfuls of cash in his pockets wooing him I'll tell you the devil knows how to woo that's right it might not be a lot of cash it might not be that but there'll be something that the devil sees and he's doing his wooing but when we come to the place my brother and sister the bride of Christ got her mind made up amen and she is settled on who she is and why she is here and the devil can't offer enough of his treasure to take God's treasure away from you amen hallelujah but look at that going back to Lot's wife see she was trying to answer the question looking back why am I leaving should I leave will I be better off if I leave is this really God's word for me got to thinking about what she had to leave behind well turn the computer on this morning sat down in the chair opened up the internet and went to the news I'm ready to leave it behind I'm ready to leave it behind it's it's Insanity it's Insanity that's what's here isn't that what the prophet told us it would be 50 years ago 60 years ago he said it's going to be as they're though insane we got trillions of dollars of budget trillions of dollars of budget deficit and we're printing money and giving it away but don't worry about it the prophet of God said United States is already bankrupt 1965 so don't worry about it just scripture coming to pass yes sir amen that's right you've got to settle it in your mind that's it amen there's where it has come down you say it's a heart issue yes it is but if the mind is yearning to go back you will find you go back amen settle it in our mind amen should I come now let's just move on to the next one here and we're going to be finished amen if Sister via and uh sister Vanessa would come play for us because let us settle this in our mind now once and forever there's only one way to have life that's right and to know him is life that's the only way we can have life and no other way for God has only promised life through Jesus Christ and the great Jehovah without beginning or without ending without without beginning of days or ending of years has give us life through Jesus Christ and him alone amen amen aren't you glad tonight I I hope you understood where I'm coming from I'm not speaking as though I believe that somehow we're waffling but I'm just speaking this to you or meant to bring it out to you that by God's grace we are not sitting here tonight double-minded not sitting here tonight looking to the things of the world I could give you testimony after testimony after testimony of young men that I know amen one young man that I know Sister Jerry knows him also uh just turned out to be such uh such a smart young man amen and there come a time in the University that they started to realize the gift that he had and uh suddenly he's starting to rise to the top and it's there and one day they invite him to go to Spain to be in a science conference with the smartest scientists in the world just a couple hundred scientists all considered invitation only to be the top scientists in the world and they invite this young man and they're saying you know you could come over here and study at this University and you can study under this great scientific master and you can do this and you do that and he was there the whole time texting his Pastor is there a church there nope not going there church here nope not going there turn down every offer and they said your science career will go nowhere but today he's recognized as one of the top scientists in Chile and he's in church and God blessed him with a beautiful wife and he's got beautiful children and he's achieved all he desired and he serves God there's where it comes down that the mind has been made up it is settled I wasn't here to be a great this or a great that I was here to be a Son of God aren't you glad tonight we not might not have any great scientists in our midst tonight but we have men of great talent amen men of Great Character amen wives and Daughters of Great Character sons of Great Character amen and they're doing what God wants them to do and that makes them the most most successful on the face of the Earth amen that makes them you might say Geniuses CU they were smart enough to recognize there was only one way to life Hallelujah I don't know if this made sense to Saints but I tell you I enjoyed preaching it tonight so I hope somehow my joy got conveyed to you because you see I know in my own life CU all the stumbles I made in life it took me a little longer than some of you to come to the place my mind was made up but when it got made up I would say if I have to sleep under a bridge I'm going to serve him amen if I'm asked to leave Sodom I'm Not Looking Back there's nothing in Sodom that has any value to me to you amen God rich in Mercy Hallelujah aren't you glad tonight amen let's just stand and sing a song long or to I actually going to ask my my throat pray for my throat here we are going to overseas to preach and every time I preach my throat feels like somebody put a wire brush in there and did that but I'm not going to let the devil win amen I'm going to just keep preaching Hallelujah let's just sing this little song Holy Spirit thout welcome 7:45 and then I'm just going to
