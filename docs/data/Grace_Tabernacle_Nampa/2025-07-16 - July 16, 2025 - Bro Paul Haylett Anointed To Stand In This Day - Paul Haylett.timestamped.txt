[16:52] When

[17:00] open
[17:02] wide for all my sin.

[17:38] Give him glory all ye people
[17:44] [Music]
[17:45] for his blood has washed away each day.
[17:54] Though the way seemed straight and
[17:58] narrow,
[18:02] all I claimed was swept away.
[18:09] My
[18:11] ambitions, plans, and wishes

[19:19] Glory, glory to his name. Let's sing
[19:24] verse four.

[19:49] He has cleansed my heart from sin.
[19:57] And I will praise him.
[20:01] I
[20:03] will praise him.
[20:05] Praise
[20:07] the lamb for sinners slain.
[20:12] [Music]
[20:14] Give
[20:15] him glory all ye people.
[20:21] for his blood has washed away
[20:26] each day.
[20:30] Amen. Let's see number four uh 444. What
[20:34] a day that will be
[20:37] as uh as brother the B brother Paul
[20:40] comes.
[20:43] There is coming
[20:47] a day
[20:49] when no heartaches
[20:52] shall come,
[20:54] no more clouds
[20:57] in the sky,
[20:59] no more tears to dim the eye.
[21:05] All is peace forever more.
[21:10] On that happy
[21:13] golden shore,
[21:16] what a day,
[21:18] glorious day
[21:21] that will be.
[21:25] Oh, what a day
[21:28] that will be
[21:31] when my Jesus
[21:34] I shall see.
[21:37] And I look upon his face. The one who
[21:43] saved me by his grace.
[21:47] When he takes me by the hand and leads
[21:53] me through the promised land.
[21:58] What a day,
[22:01] glorious day
[22:03] that will be.
[22:08] There'll be no
[22:11] sorrow there,
[22:14] no more burdens
[22:17] to bear.
[22:19] No more sickness,
[22:22] no pain,
[22:24] no more parting
[22:27] over there.
[22:29] and forever
[22:32] I will be
[22:34] with the one who died for me.
[22:40] What a day, a glorious day
[22:45] that will be.
[22:49] Oh, what a day
[22:52] that will be

[23:11] When he takes me by the hand and leads
[23:16] me through the promised land
[23:22] day,
[23:24] glorious day
[23:26] that will be.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that is so glorious
[23:33] that our finite minds cannot even
[23:35] comprehend how beautiful that will be.
[23:39] And the time that we get to stand before
[23:42] God. Amen. Stand there upon the Sea of
[23:45] Crystal with the saints. Sing praises.
[23:49] Never have a tired moment. Never have a
[23:53] moment of pain. Never have a time that
[23:56] your hands seem to be heavy.
[24:00] Maybe you have a little pain in your
[24:02] shoulder and makes it hard, but that'll
[24:04] all disappear. We'll just be able to
[24:06] praise the Lord. Amen. I I just look
[24:09] forward to that. Amen.
[24:12] Uh as we go into the service here, I
[24:15] just want to bring greetings to you from
[24:17] Brother Jonah, Sister Edna, Brother Art,
[24:19] Sister Karen. Um they had a wonderful
[24:22] time. They felt very blessed to to be
[24:26] here. uh quite a long ways to drive uh
[24:29] for them, but uh brother Jonah had fit
[24:32] in uh time in the Tri Cities there uh
[24:36] with brother Jose and and the little
[24:38] group of believers there to visit with
[24:40] them. So uh just a lovely time. They
[24:44] enjoyed it and I think we enjoyed them,
[24:46] did we not?
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh uh so we just appreciate that.
[24:52] We already mentioned about brother
[24:53] Persant and his back pain. He just said
[24:55] it's just really bothering him. And uh
[24:58] he also just uh to just let us know that
[25:01] his parents have uh been allowed to
[25:05] come. They were arriving this afternoon
[25:07] there. Uh so uh his mom and dad and he
[25:11] was just uh desiring God's blessings
[25:14] upon their time of fellowship. And
[25:16] always uh I honestly can't say I don't
[25:20] know north,southeast or west, but let's
[25:22] remember sister April. We know her heart
[25:24] and we know her heart is is to the Lord
[25:26] and the things of God and and uh
[25:29] sometimes her work schedule is crazy and
[25:31] then obviously we know that when she
[25:34] does have that moment she just their
[25:37] family being very close oftent times
[25:39] just to go be with them. Uh we want to
[25:42] remember Gideon and Lily. Amen. While we
[25:45] don't understand everything that's going
[25:47] on, what we see is two souls that need
[25:50] Jesus Christ. Amen. And so let's
[25:53] remember them. Amen. Just uh be faithful
[25:56] to hold them up that the Lord will move
[25:58] upon them. And um we mention uh and I I
[26:03] can't remove the brother from this, my
[26:06] brother and sister. It's just how I feel
[26:07] about it. Um we want to remember them.
[26:10] Brother Gideon. Amen. And uh we desire
[26:13] to see Lily um you know saved, filled
[26:17] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. and uh uh
[26:21] sister Sophie's son Manassa. You all
[26:24] remember Manassa well. Uh him and his
[26:27] wife Katie have moved from Chicago back
[26:29] to Boisey. Uh they have come for what
[26:32] they see as their opportunities, but I
[26:35] see as an opportunity for God to move
[26:38] and put them back in fellowship. And uh
[26:41] so we just want to remember that. Amen.
[26:44] Um uh
[26:47] they've been coming on Sundays. My
[26:50] friends uh the Floyd's Lois uh and her
[26:55] daughter Sammy and son Cody. Uh just
[26:59] please remember them. God is just doing
[27:02] a a great work really. Just everything
[27:04] that I speak to them uh this this
[27:08] they're just saying I see it. I believe
[27:10] it. I I you know understand that. And I
[27:14] uh by God's grace I had um my started
[27:18] out just to be lunch and I think uh I
[27:22] talked with I'm going to put it this way
[27:24] is how I feel brother Cody for three and
[27:28] a half hours uh yesterday and um
[27:33] I broached the message with him
[27:36] &gt;&gt; and uh we just put that out in front of
[27:38] him uh and uh just ask them you know if
[27:41] you have questions you know, don't don't
[27:44] push it away, just pray about it. And uh
[27:47] but in the conversation in that three
[27:49] and a half hours, everything we spoke to
[27:51] him, he seemed to to accept and and
[27:54] believe that and recognize that God is
[27:56] doing something very supernatural
[27:59] &gt;&gt; in their lives. And uh so just please
[28:02] remember them. These are these are
[28:04] people, you know, sometimes we feel a
[28:06] personal investment as it were. Uh but
[28:09] like I've shared, you know, I've known
[28:11] Cody since, you know, uh he was just
[28:14] this little guy and known the family, I
[28:17] should say, and and you know, to see God
[28:20] start to deal with them
[28:22] &gt;&gt; and the way that he has dealt with them,
[28:24] you know, not us putting something out
[28:26] there, but God coming down and and
[28:30] speaking to Cody, you need to call Paul.
[28:34] And we have never had a spiritual
[28:36] conversation ever before.
[28:39] And yet God laid upon his heart, call
[28:42] Paul. And um I I just believe this is
[28:45] something the Lord has ordained. And so
[28:49] we do that. Let's just stand and go into
[28:51] the word today. Thank you so much,
[28:53] brother Alex, um and sister Ruth and uh
[28:57] brother Titus. Amen. Just uh beautiful.
[29:02] Amen. Uh, you know, I put about 10
[29:05] titles to this uh in the last two days
[29:09] until I finally settled on this one. And
[29:12] um I I trust that it would be a relevant
[29:15] title. But it's what struck my heart
[29:17] today as I was working. I just thought,
[29:20] you know what? Uh the truth of it is
[29:22] regardless exactly how this all comes
[29:24] out tonight, we are anointed to stand in
[29:28] this day. Amen. Not an accident that we
[29:31] were born and brought and everything put
[29:34] in place. Not an accident, but by the
[29:37] grace of God. There is anointing come
[29:40] down right from the throne of almighty
[29:42] God. Come right down into our lives. And
[29:46] in that, we cannot do anything
[29:48] different. Now, I believe we all have to
[29:51] recognize there's been times that we
[29:53] just felt so forlororn and we felt so
[29:56] low and we felt so distressed and
[29:58] distraught that it's like, do I can I go
[30:01] even find strength to go another step to
[30:04] go any further? And then some anointing
[30:08] just comes upon us and we say, "I can't
[30:13] quit now.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; I won't quit now."
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that anointing, my
[30:18] brother and sister, overrides every
[30:20] anointing of our flesh and of our mental
[30:23] state. It rides over that and says, "I
[30:27] called you. You are more than able."
[30:30] Amen. Let's turn our Bibles to Ephesians
[30:33] the 6th chapter verses 10-14.
[30:36] And uh by God's grace,
[30:40] we can we can give thought to this
[30:43] tonight. Amen. Finally, my brethren, be
[30:47] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[30:49] his might. Put on the whole armor of God
[30:52] that you may be able to stand against
[30:53] the ws of the devil. And I want to ask
[30:55] you, is he not a wy character? Amen. He
[31:00] is just so clever. He He just can wait
[31:03] and wait. He's got patience. He just
[31:05] waits and waits. And at the right
[31:08] moment, he springs a trap and thinks,
[31:10] "I've got them now." And that anointing
[31:12] we were talking about comes down and we
[31:14] say, "You know what? Uh, yep. Maybe I
[31:17] make some mistakes." So, we get down to
[31:19] a final quote. I think you'll like that
[31:21] this evening. We'll make some mistakes,
[31:23] but there's something in us that we
[31:26] cannot just stop. Amen. For we wrestle
[31:29] not against flesh and blood, but against
[31:31] principalities, against powers, against
[31:33] rulers of darkness of this world,
[31:35] against spiritual wickedness, wickedness
[31:38] in high places. Wherefore take unto you
[31:40] the whole armor of God that you may be
[31:42] able to withstand in the evil day. And
[31:44] certainly this day qualifies having done
[31:47] all to stand. Stand therefore. And that
[31:52] really was was the crux of where this
[31:55] thought was is we have been anointed in
[31:58] this hour when we have done all we feel
[32:00] like we can do. God just brings us to a
[32:04] place instead of tucking our tail as the
[32:06] phrase is and running. We just stand.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; And then we get to see the power of God
[32:12] come in. We get to see the Holy Spirit
[32:15] start moving. We get to see things
[32:17] changing. We see atmospheres change. We
[32:20] see attitudes change. We see all of
[32:22] these things because God's not going to
[32:25] allow us to fall.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Now, our idea of falling sometimes we
[32:31] think, "Oh, I fell." But brother and
[32:33] sister, that was a speed bump in your
[32:35] life. That wasn't that wasn't the story
[32:37] of your life. It was a speed bump. Amen.
[32:40] You rose up, you come down, but you keep
[32:43] going. Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:46] Stand therefore having your loins gird
[32:48] about with truthmen and having on the
[32:51] breastplate of righteousness. Heavenly
[32:53] Father, we ask you to come tonight. Just
[32:56] move in our midst. Father, speak to our
[32:58] hearts, Lord. To those who would hear,
[33:00] Father. Lord, may you just speak to
[33:03] hearts wherever they may be today. Lord,
[33:05] that we could realize that we have been
[33:07] called and your calling is true and it
[33:10] is faithful. Lord, it's not conditional,
[33:13] but Lord, you knew and placed within us
[33:15] the very seed of life. Lord, a
[33:18] lifechanging seed, Father, that we can
[33:21] stand here today know that we belong to
[33:23] you and you to us. Father, we thank you
[33:27] for your grace and mercy. Be with each
[33:29] one tonight, I pray. Amen. You may be
[33:32] seated. Now, as we look at this, I want
[33:35] to just put it this way, not to make
[33:38] some great emphasis of it, but my
[33:40] brother and sister, we often times
[33:43] because of our humanity find ourselves
[33:47] struggling against flesh and blood. And
[33:50] sometimes that flesh and blood is
[33:52] another individual that we seemingly
[33:55] feel anointed to have some kind of
[33:58] unconditional disagreement. But oftent
[34:01] times the real battle that we're
[34:02] fighting is our own flesh and blood. And
[34:05] and so we're not against these
[34:07] governments. We're against all these
[34:08] things, my brother and sister. We
[34:10] certainly see what the prophet of God
[34:12] has said about what is going to come to
[34:14] pass. And and uh you know, not to
[34:18] deviate off into those things, but just
[34:20] by a vote and a stroke of a pen, you
[34:23] know, you you can add just a few
[34:24] trillion to a debt of a nation that's
[34:26] already bankrupt. scripture not only
[34:29] being fulfilled but reinforced.
[34:32] Amen. Prophecy being reinforced of what
[34:34] it is and and seeing how these things
[34:37] all come and uh you know as this comes
[34:41] my brother and sister it causes us that
[34:43] we could withstand in this evil day and
[34:46] having done all to stand stand. And you
[34:49] know what is there to hold us is this
[34:53] steadfast belief that God is in control.
[34:56] Amen. And as we're here today, if we
[34:58] were looking at our own, if we were
[35:00] looking at our position, a and what we
[35:03] saw the future holding, uh we would have
[35:06] no reason to have hope. We would have no
[35:09] reason to to have uh a a a bright future
[35:13] as it was. But I'm telling you right
[35:15] now, if I could put it in the right
[35:16] words, forgive me if I don't quite get
[35:18] this right, but I'm telling you right
[35:20] now, this stage of your life is the
[35:23] dullest
[35:24] &gt;&gt; it'll ever be.
[35:27] Because when we pass from this into
[35:30] life, real complete fulfilled life,
[35:35] we'll never remember this. This will be
[35:37] something so far behind us. So while we
[35:40] look at our ups and downs and we judge
[35:42] our life by the ups and downs and and we
[35:45] uh you know are excited and depressed
[35:47] over the ups and the downs but to
[35:50] realize my brother and sister that we
[35:52] are here uh uh in the very foretaste
[35:56] right the down payment that we have come
[35:59] and it is here that in this down payment
[36:01] life is glorious we see the power of God
[36:04] moving we see the Holy Spirit nudging us
[36:06] constantly along he doesn't just leave
[36:08] us on the side of the road and bypass us
[36:11] and say, you know, well, you know, we
[36:13] just leave them alone. But he's always
[36:15] nudging us and drawing us closer and
[36:17] closer. And so we have our loins girth
[36:21] about with truth. And we have on this
[36:23] breastplate breastplate of righteousness
[36:26] and we hold fast to the simple fact that
[36:29] we know his truth that the Lord is in
[36:31] control. Now, as we wrestle not against
[36:34] flesh and blood, but against
[36:36] principalities and powers, uh we would
[36:38] see how that Satan is uh pretty amazing
[36:42] really when you think about Satan and
[36:44] and what God allowed him, the authority
[36:47] that God did allow him. Just as he was
[36:50] dealing with Job, he says, "You know
[36:51] what? I I'm going to open the hedge and
[36:53] you can do everything but take his
[36:55] life." And there, my brother and sister,
[36:57] was the very thing that bound Satan. He
[37:00] could not take that life. You can say,
[37:01] "Well, is he talking natural life?" I
[37:03] tend to believe as I read that
[37:05] scripture, he was talking about eternal
[37:07] life. You you you can do whatever you
[37:09] want to this man, but you're not going
[37:11] to take life from him. Amen. So, Satan
[37:15] really was bound. All he was doing, he
[37:17] had just been had his eye teeth pulled
[37:19] right there because no matter what he
[37:21] inflicted upon Job, Job was still a son
[37:24] of God. And I'm telling you, my brother
[37:26] and sister, I believe this with all of
[37:27] my heart, that if God would do that with
[37:29] Job, he's done the exact same thing with
[37:32] you and I. That no matter what Satan
[37:34] might try to afflict us with and
[37:36] circumstance he tries to place upon us,
[37:39] he's already been defanged. Amen. He
[37:42] cannot take our life because our life is
[37:45] hid in Christ. Amen. And when we were
[37:47] hid in Christ, that was not a
[37:49] conditional like you have a bad day. Oh,
[37:52] you're out. Hope you're having a good
[37:54] day. You're in. But it is a
[37:57] unconditional promise of God that is
[38:00] just as sure as the heavens and the
[38:02] earth and the earth being hung in the
[38:04] heavens. My brother and sister, look at
[38:06] time. They're there and they are
[38:09] forecasting time by the second into the
[38:12] future because that's how perfect God's
[38:14] timing is. Amen. No man could ever do
[38:17] that. And you know, Satan uses our own
[38:21] uh in our own life. He uses our own life
[38:23] against us. He uses our own words and
[38:27] deeds against us. Can somebody say amen
[38:29] to that? And what he's trying to do is
[38:31] render you and I ineffective. He's
[38:34] trying to bind us. Cuz if our hearts
[38:37] condemn us not, then we have confidence
[38:40] in God. So if he can rob our confidence
[38:43] then there'll be many things in our life
[38:45] we won't even approach or approach God
[38:48] for those because we don't have
[38:50] confidence in our own position and Satan
[38:53] knows he doesn't got to get us out of
[38:55] the church. He doesn't have to break up
[38:57] everything around us. He's just got to
[38:58] rob the confidence that we would have
[39:01] that we cannot come boldly to the throne
[39:03] of God. But we will come boldly to the
[39:06] throne of God because the Lord is not
[39:08] going to allow Satan to bind you and I.
[39:12] Amen. The word says that whatever is
[39:14] bound on earth will be bound in heaven.
[39:16] What is bound in heaven will be bound on
[39:18] earth, my brother and sister. And the
[39:20] word has already went forth. Let's think
[39:22] about that. when we're I was listening
[39:24] today just some beautiful beautiful
[39:27] quotes and different things and and my
[39:29] brother and sister when the prophet of
[39:31] God is speaking he is not talking about
[39:34] as a past tense he's not talking about
[39:36] as a future tense but he's talking about
[39:39] a right now atmosphere talking about the
[39:42] opening of the seventh seal how glorious
[39:45] he says oh how glorious that is that
[39:48] that seal is open that Christ is with us
[39:51] and the word is active It is by here
[39:54] doing the work on our behalf. It's our
[39:56] advocate and and it's just taking place
[39:59] right now.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; We're not saying, "Oh, God God was my
[40:03] advocate last week. He'll be my advocate
[40:06] next week. He's my advocate right now."
[40:10] Amen. That just stirs my heart because I
[40:13] don't know about you, I still am taming
[40:15] this flesh. Amen. Every once in a while
[40:17] it it kind of like a a mad lion or
[40:20] something. every once in a while this
[40:22] old flesh just kind of
[40:24] you know and God's still taming that and
[40:27] and here again I don't want to make too
[40:28] much emphasis too early but we close
[40:31] this out today this evening uh by God's
[40:33] grace by sharing a beautiful quote with
[40:35] you so Satan trying to render us
[40:38] ineffective now brother Brandham says in
[40:41] the quote perfect strength by perfect
[40:43] weakness amen this I I love this quote
[40:47] right here not in a critical sense but a
[40:49] realistic
[40:50] sense of who we are. We could each one
[40:54] take the name William Brham out and put
[40:57] our name in there.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this is not a criticism like
[41:02] some people might interpret it to be,
[41:04] but it's literally reflective to you and
[41:06] I because it's reality.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've often said the greatest enemy
[41:11] I got is William Brham. He's the one
[41:14] that gets in God's way. He's the one
[41:17] that gets lazy.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. H. Ah, this is pretty painful.
[41:22] Amen. Amen. I think without changing
[41:26] this quote, we could just add he's the
[41:28] one that procrastinates.
[41:31] You know, I mean, there's just a lot of
[41:33] lot of uh reflection in there. Amen.
[41:37] He's the one that gets lazy. He's the
[41:39] one that gets to a place sometimes where
[41:41] he thinks he can do something about it.
[41:43] And when he does, that shoves God right
[41:46] out of the picture. Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. Can anybody tonight say, "Yep, I
[41:52] understand what the prophet is saying
[41:54] here." Amen. But when I can get rid of
[41:57] that guy, when I can get to a place that
[42:00] he is out of the way, then God can come
[42:03] over and do things that William Brham
[42:06] knows nothing about. Oh, I tell you
[42:10] what, Lord, help each one of us to get
[42:13] out of the way that the Lord could come
[42:16] down and do things we know nothing
[42:19] about.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, when you just visit
[42:23] sometimes with people and they share
[42:24] their heart and they say, you know, what
[42:26] was said here at this point was almost
[42:30] exactly word for word what we spoke
[42:33] about. My brother and sister, no man can
[42:36] come and say, "Yes, I thank you. I take
[42:39] credit for that. You see, what's
[42:40] happened is is we have got pushed out of
[42:43] the way and God is doing things that we
[42:46] know nothing about. Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord, for that.
[42:53] That's when God can use you.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; And I want to be used. Can we say amen
[42:57] to that? I want to be used.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just be a church member,
[43:02] message person, goes to church, have
[43:04] some kind of perfect attendance or
[43:06] something. I want God to use me.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want him to use each one of
[43:11] us. And and
[43:14] then God can use you. That's when he can
[43:17] use any of you. He can use anybody when
[43:20] we get out of the way. But as long as
[43:22] we've got ourselves in the way, then we
[43:24] cannot. All right. Amen. Look at that. I
[43:28] love that quote because you see what
[43:30] it's doing is the prophet of God's not
[43:32] setting himself as a prophet so far
[43:35] above the people that when you guys ever
[43:37] attain to this glorious position you'll
[43:40] be overcomers
[43:42] &gt;&gt; but he's bringing right down. Now think
[43:45] about the prophet just to insert this
[43:47] think about the prophet when he said you
[43:49] know here I'm 50 years old and if I'm
[43:51] ever going to do anything for the Lord I
[43:54] better get started. Now, that might
[43:56] cause some to to feel condemned. Uh it
[43:59] might cause some to to say, "Well, if he
[44:02] felt that way, where are we at?" But the
[44:04] truth of it is that was the Holy Spirit
[44:07] nudging
[44:09] brother Brandham for more consecrated
[44:11] life.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit's not here to
[44:14] condemn you and I that we're not doing
[44:16] the supernatural, we're not doing this,
[44:18] we're not doing that. But it's the nudge
[44:20] that is nudging us to be more
[44:23] consecrated. Lord, I want to do more for
[44:25] you.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Even doing more for the Lord could just
[44:29] be your prayer life changing.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Could be being more faithful to to study
[44:36] the message, to read your Bible, uh all
[44:39] of these little things. It doesn't mean
[44:41] many of us are not called uh not to go
[44:44] out and go to foreign lands and to the
[44:46] dark side of Africa or to the far south
[44:50] of Australia, as it were, and the
[44:53] outback. and this and that. My brother
[44:55] and sister, many of us, the majority of
[44:57] us are just called to be faithful.
[44:59] That's God's calling in our life is to
[45:01] be called faithful to the word that's
[45:04] been revealed to us.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; And the Lord's calling us.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; To a higher calling.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Hebrews 12 1-3.
[45:17] Uh we look at this, my brother and
[45:20] sister, not to compare ourselves to the
[45:22] saints of days gone by because I believe
[45:25] we can make a very realistic claim that
[45:27] we have something that they never had.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Nowhere in time in the history has the
[45:36] seventh seal been revealed and open to
[45:38] humanity.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Where you come and people say, "Oh, but
[45:42] God was with them." But we're talking
[45:44] about the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[45:48] There's never been a time that that
[45:50] revelation has been opened in such
[45:52] clarity to mankind. And so we're looking
[45:56] at something that's very supernatural
[45:58] and as it is Hebrews 11 that they
[46:01] without us cannot be made perfect. So
[46:03] there had to be a word that came to you
[46:05] and I that would bring you and I to
[46:08] perfection because God's not going to
[46:10] bring the word in this day skip us and
[46:12] go back into perfection for them. But we
[46:15] are the final key as it were the
[46:18] punctuation in the paragraph that says
[46:21] this is the word come into perfection.
[46:24] Amen. And God chose us to be in this day
[46:27] which ought to give us something when we
[46:29] feel ill about our life. we feel down
[46:32] about our life, we ought to give us
[46:34] something to jump and shout about. The
[46:36] fact that God would say, "I see you as a
[46:39] perfect believer. I see you as a saint.
[46:43] I see you as a son or a daughter of God.
[46:46] I see you in this position. And I've
[46:48] placed you in this age, this time to
[46:51] fulfill this into perfection."
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; That, my brother and sister, is not an
[46:56] accident. We're not here just, oh my, I
[46:59] I believe the message and I hope I make
[47:01] it to the end. I hope this, I hope that.
[47:03] There ought to be a certainty in us that
[47:05] if God called you to this hour, that God
[47:08] has already finished the work and you
[47:10] are the perfect person to be in the
[47:14] bride in this hour, the perfect, none
[47:17] better.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; No one can take your place. Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; So Hebrews 12 says, "Wherefore, seeing
[47:25] we also are compassed about with so
[47:27] great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay
[47:29] aside every weight,
[47:31] &gt;&gt; and the sin which thus so easily beset
[47:34] us." Now remember, the prophet of God
[47:35] give clarity that sin was unbelief.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; And the actual attributes are just the
[47:44] the byproduct
[47:46] &gt;&gt; of unbelief.
[47:48] So, see what Satan's trying to do
[47:51] &gt;&gt; when we see this? He's trying to shoot
[47:53] us with the arrow of doubt.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Unbelief.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. A arrow of fear because fear feeds
[48:01] unbelief.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, it's there that it's
[48:06] interesting because how Satan works, he
[48:08] causes people to become disgruntled.
[48:12] And they think they're disgruntled with
[48:14] the message. They think they're
[48:16] disgruntled with God. But the truth of
[48:19] it is they're disgruntled with
[48:21] themselves
[48:23] &gt;&gt; because you see when they quit serving
[48:25] God, they never become happy.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; It's not their sudden uh uh moment of of
[48:31] supreme happiness. It it lingers. It
[48:34] lags. It follows them.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And I could give you real life examples,
[48:38] but we certainly would never want to put
[48:40] that into the the public forum. But you
[48:44] look at this. see every bit of unbelief
[48:47] which so doth easily beset us. Let us
[48:50] run with patience the race that is set
[48:52] before us. So we are running a race.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's absolutely without a doubt
[48:58] we are running a race
[49:00] &gt;&gt; and it's not a sprint.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; It's closer to an ultramarathon.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; And so as we run the race my brother and
[49:08] sister we actually have to pace
[49:11] ourselves. Yeah.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Now, when I say that, I'm not talking
[49:14] about you pull back from the word. But
[49:17] the thing is is instead of trying to
[49:19] force ourselves into something that
[49:21] we're not ready for. In other words,
[49:23] like revelation of the word, people jump
[49:25] in there. I believe that, but they
[49:28] don't. And someone can persuade them
[49:31] from it.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; They weren't ready for it.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; But when you are ready for it, no one
[49:36] will ever persuade you from it. And so
[49:40] that's why God doesn't want us to jump
[49:41] ahead and and try and dive into these
[49:44] things. The prophet of God said, "Look,
[49:46] you you just take those things you don't
[49:48] understand. You put that on a shelf."
[49:50] And in other words, if you don't put it
[49:52] on the shelf, you'll become obsessed
[49:54] with that and it will eat you up until
[49:57] you either create your own answer or you
[50:00] decide there is no answer.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But in God's season, it comes down
[50:06] and it fits so perfectly in that time
[50:09] and space and our life is changed
[50:12] forever.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you look at this
[50:17] in in natural I I'm going to pick on
[50:19] brother Trevor. I think I'm going to ask
[50:22] I'm tired of farming. It's too hard a
[50:24] work. I tell you, my arms are about to
[50:26] fall off my body. And um I I'm I'm
[50:29] thinking that what Brother Trevor does
[50:31] is a lot easier. And I I've watched uh
[50:35] you know, I've watched people get
[50:36] haircuts and I want Brother Trevor to
[50:39] let me come over there and just rent one
[50:41] of those seats and he can share his
[50:43] customers with me.
[50:46] Yeah. He's got that look on his face
[50:48] like, uh-huh. Right.
[50:52] But the truth is,
[50:54] with studious study and plenty of
[50:56] practice, even at this age, I could
[50:58] become a barber.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; There'd be a few nick deers and a few
[51:03] ugly haircuts. Might have to be free,
[51:06] but I could do it. But you see, my
[51:10] brother and sister, when we would come,
[51:13] if I was to go tomorrow, and brother
[51:15] Trevor said, "Fine, brother Paul. I've
[51:17] got an empty chair. Just come. first
[51:19] customer in the door in the morning, you
[51:21] can have him. Pretty soon, Brother
[51:23] Trevor wouldn't have any customers
[51:25] [Music]
[51:29] because I'm not ready for that. I'm not
[51:32] trained for that. I have no experience
[51:35] to that. I have no revelation of what it
[51:38] is. Somebody'd come in and say, "Uh, I
[51:41] want to fade." I've heard Brother Trevor
[51:43] use that word before. I want to fade.
[51:47] And I'd be like, "Fade what?
[51:50] Fade in, fade out, fade up, fade down."
[51:53] You see, my brother and sister, that is
[51:55] such a silly analogy, but it's the truth
[51:58] of the gospel that we cannot press into
[52:01] what we are not ready for.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. People can get, "Oh, praise God.
[52:08] We are going to just come into this and
[52:10] we're going to bring the rapture on." My
[52:12] brother and sister, they might not be
[52:14] the reason the rapture is not taking
[52:16] place. It might be me.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't want them to rush the
[52:20] rapture. We know they can't, but I don't
[52:23] want them to rush the rapture unless I'm
[52:25] completely ready. And I don't want to
[52:27] rush the rapture unless you're
[52:28] completely ready. Amen. So, what happens
[52:31] is as we we come into this position that
[52:34] we are anointed to stand in our position
[52:38] this day and come into a maturity. Now,
[52:42] you listen to the prophet of God talking
[52:44] about Abraham and Lot. And it was there
[52:46] that Abraham stayed up there on the
[52:49] mountain. Amen. And it wasn't the best
[52:51] feed. It wasn't the best place for
[52:53] cattle. It wasn't the best environment.
[52:55] It was dry and dusty and always windy
[52:57] and whatever. But my brother and sister,
[53:00] the season by Revelation, Abraham said,
[53:02] "This is where I belong." Amen. And see,
[53:06] he could have by the very fact that he
[53:08] was Abraham and God was blessing him. He
[53:10] could have went down into the plains of
[53:12] Mary and went down there and that lush
[53:15] grass put his cattle on there and
[53:18] physically prospered. But spiritually
[53:21] right there on that dry, dusty mountain
[53:24] is where he belonged. Amen. And we need
[53:27] to recognize that at times we are
[53:29] anointed to stand where we are. Don't
[53:31] get impatient with God. Don't get
[53:33] impatient with yourself. Don't be down
[53:35] on yourself. Just recognize my footsteps
[53:39] are ordered of the Lord. That's what the
[53:41] word says. So, I don't need to try and
[53:43] be somewhere else and be farther here or
[53:46] farther there and over here, but I need
[53:48] to stand right in the position God has
[53:51] called me. Now, this is not something
[53:53] saying that we can be lazy and we can be
[53:55] whatever. As I I read that quote,
[53:57] Brother Brandham's saying there, you
[53:59] know, we can be lazy. We're not
[54:01] justifying that laziness, but at the
[54:03] same token, don't beat yourself trying
[54:05] to be something you're not.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Everybody's talking about revelation of
[54:14] a certain scripture, a certain thought,
[54:15] a certain thing. My brother and sister,
[54:19] God will reveal it to you.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Just be patient.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Let the Lord move on that. I I'll just
[54:25] give you an example. I remember a a
[54:27] brother come many many years ago. The
[54:30] church was very small. Sister Sue would
[54:32] remember brother Herold would come and
[54:34] preach to us. And I can remember I
[54:36] remember this very vividly. The first
[54:38] time brother Herold starts preaching on
[54:40] the third pull. And I remember you know
[54:43] Paul half in and half out of the message
[54:45] you might say. You know still a lot of
[54:47] Paul's flesh that was was controlling
[54:50] Paul. And I just oh and I remember I I
[54:54] don't have the paper but I just remember
[54:56] and brother Herold talking about the
[54:57] third pole and putting this out and I
[55:00] remember writing on a piece of paper
[55:03] third pull with a big check mark like
[55:05] what is he talking about but did you
[55:08] know by God's grace see never give one
[55:12] thought about third pull coming up to
[55:15] that point but then it's presented and I
[55:18] remember after that every time I picked
[55:21] up a message book, every time I listened
[55:23] to the tape, the prophet of God was
[55:25] saying something about the third pull
[55:27] and I became so real to me. Now, I'm
[55:29] telling you, I could not have went 6
[55:32] months prior to that and dug in and
[55:34] said, "Oh, the third pull." I wouldn't
[55:36] have had any understanding. But God come
[55:38] in the right season, opened it up, and
[55:41] let us see what it was. Because we had
[55:43] to come through what? We had to come
[55:46] &gt;&gt; to be ready.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. for that.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, forgive me for
[55:52] putting it this way, and if I'm wrong,
[55:53] I'll repent.
[55:56] But I wonder if we would judge oursel
[55:58] and say, "I'm ready for the rapture
[55:59] right now."
[56:03] On one side, we can say, "Yes, we are."
[56:05] But there's still things that God's
[56:08] working on.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[56:09] &gt;&gt; we have to acknowledge God's still
[56:11] working on us. And being ready for the
[56:14] rapture is not our decision.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; It's his decision.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, the bride of Christ
[56:22] cannot miss the rapture.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We won't just be a little bit late
[56:28] or distracted from that. The bride of
[56:30] Christ is the rapture.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it will take place because
[56:35] it's the transformation of this bride
[56:38] from being bride into wife. Amen. And so
[56:42] it's this transition that's taking place
[56:44] just as is natural. Amen. You go from
[56:47] being uh single to being betrothed.
[56:50] Amen. To coming and ultimately when that
[56:53] one day is finished, you start the day.
[56:56] You're not bride. The day is finished.
[57:00] You are wife. You're the bride. And God
[57:03] is working on us. Let's not try and rush
[57:06] ourselves into this. Let us just say,
[57:09] Lord, you started this work, right? This
[57:11] is his word. You started this work. You
[57:14] will finish this work. Can we have that
[57:17] kind of confidence tonight? Amen. This
[57:19] what you started in me, Lord. Not just
[57:22] started in the bride of Christ in the
[57:23] world, but what you started in me, you
[57:26] will finish and I will finish
[57:29] triumphant.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; I will finish boldly. Amen. looking unto
[57:34] Jesus, the author and finish of our
[57:36] faith, who for the joy that was set
[57:38] before him, endured the cross. Now, my
[57:41] brother and sister, I want you to just
[57:43] stop and think for a moment as Jesus is
[57:46] coming to that point.
[57:48] They've judged him.
[57:51] They've let Barabus go.
[57:54] He's going. Does that look like joy?
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Does not look like joy.
[58:03] And when you see Jesus there under that
[58:07] burden, you're seeing a physical man's
[58:10] burden.
[58:13] But Jesus Christ was rejoicing
[58:17] because he knew when those words left
[58:21] his lips,
[58:22] &gt;&gt; it is finished.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; That there was nothing Satan could do
[58:28] &gt;&gt; to reverse it.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. No emperor, no ruler, no
[58:33] governor, no nothing could stop that.
[58:36] Those words went out and unlocked every
[58:39] key of every promise and made it so open
[58:43] and so free that we stand here today and
[58:46] we can rejoice. It is finished.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; It is finished.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I've not today was a good
[58:54] day, but you know, um uh you know, I've
[58:57] had just recently some days that would
[58:59] just qualify as bad days. Amen. You
[59:02] know, I just uh I I did some
[59:06] silly things. Forgot to lock in a a deal
[59:10] on a feeder house of a chopper. And as I
[59:12] was moving, it swung open and I just
[59:14] wasted a few hundred. Ripped hoses off,
[59:18] broke electrical fittings.
[59:21] And you just look at it and say, "Wow,
[59:26] that was not very bright."
[59:30] &gt;&gt; But in eternity
[59:33] aspect,
[59:35] not even
[59:37] a dot,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Everything I work for this week just
[59:44] went out the window right there.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; But you see, that's carnal.
[59:50] That's not who I am.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; That's not what I'm working for. That's
[59:54] not what I'm living for. That's not what
[59:56] my goal is.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; That's just the carnal side of it. And
[1:00:00] what it does is it humbles us because we
[1:00:03] amen have to learn lessons as the
[1:00:06] apostle Paul even himself expresses that
[1:00:09] he himself when he would do good evil is
[1:00:13] present with him. Some people some
[1:00:15] people have that analyzed that that Paul
[1:00:17] must have been some kind of, you know,
[1:00:19] saint by day and secret sinner by night.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; How carnal is their reasoning on that?
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. God God's not going to call him a
[1:00:27] saint by day and a sinner by night. But
[1:00:30] the Apostle Paul was acknowledging he
[1:00:32] was human just like you and I. And he
[1:00:35] had a calling in his life. And God
[1:00:37] proved that calling. But he was still a
[1:00:39] man, still flesh and still struggled and
[1:00:42] still learned.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; And that conversation we were having,
[1:00:46] Brother David, you might not even
[1:00:48] remember that, but you made the words as
[1:00:50] we're visiting with Brother Jonah, you
[1:00:52] said the words about that. Just right
[1:00:55] along that very line, we are continually
[1:00:59] growing.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; And if we're not, there's something
[1:01:03] wrong.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; There's where we need to get nervous.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] Let me hurry along here.
[1:01:13] Who for the joy was set before him
[1:01:15] endured the cross, despising the shame,
[1:01:17] is sat down on the right hand of the
[1:01:19] throne of God. And I say, "Thank you,
[1:01:20] Lord, for what you've done. For consider
[1:01:23] him that endureth such contradiction of
[1:01:26] sinners against himself." In other
[1:01:28] words, he's redeeming people that are
[1:01:30] absolutely contrary to what he
[1:01:33] represented. And he redeemed you and I
[1:01:36] anyway. He didn't stop and say, "I'm
[1:01:38] going to go find some more righteous
[1:01:40] people." Already righteous people. The
[1:01:43] Apostle Paul, when you think about him,
[1:01:45] uh just to finish that little thought,
[1:01:47] you think about the Apostle Paul. Amen.
[1:01:49] He's putting the believers to death and
[1:01:51] God still said, "You are redeemed."
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Maybe that was a little bit of
[1:01:58] Paul's problem, the midnight hour to
[1:02:01] remember.
[1:02:03] Amen. those faces
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; of those
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; that he was in control of
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; and put them to death.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Men, women, children,
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; that would be a tough memory.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; But our Lord Jesus Christ says, you know
[1:02:21] what? He endured these contradictions
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; of sinners against himself. See, there's
[1:02:27] witnesses past and present, and there's
[1:02:30] witnesses right in our midst.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to go looking out
[1:02:34] somewhere else for witnesses. They're
[1:02:36] right here in our midst. Amen. Of
[1:02:39] overcoming power, the word of God, the
[1:02:41] blood is sufficient. Some preacher, I I
[1:02:44] won't even mention his name. I'll just
[1:02:45] leave him as some preacher recently made
[1:02:48] a statement to the world that uh Jesus
[1:02:51] Christ needs a blood transfusion cuz
[1:02:53] he's running out of blood.
[1:02:56] Talk about carnal nonsensical thinking
[1:02:59] that that the world is getting. This is
[1:03:02] his reasoning. The world's getting more
[1:03:04] sinful, so there must not be enough
[1:03:06] blood to cover the sin. Oh, my brother
[1:03:09] and sister, they so miss it with that
[1:03:11] kind of carnal thinking. Because you
[1:03:13] see, there's the contradiction that they
[1:03:16] think that it has to do with how much
[1:03:18] blood is available. My brother and
[1:03:20] sister, even just the very presence of
[1:03:23] of the most minute, you might say, a
[1:03:25] blood cell would be enough to save and
[1:03:28] heal and do of every bit of humanity.
[1:03:31] and they would don't even want to
[1:03:33] acknowledge. They take John 3:16 and
[1:03:35] say, "If God so loved the world that he
[1:03:38] gave his only begotten son, then there
[1:03:40] shouldn't be any. There's something
[1:03:42] wrong with the gospel." No, something
[1:03:44] wrong with the people because the light,
[1:03:47] amen, came according to the word and the
[1:03:49] darkness comprehended it not.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The darkness didn't want anything
[1:03:54] to do with the light.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they think somehow the light
[1:03:58] is defective.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. such nonsense in the day that we
[1:04:02] live in.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we stop and examine what it is
[1:04:07] Satan's using against us.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Stop and examine that.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; I I think it's worthy for us to take
[1:04:15] time what it is that Satan's using
[1:04:16] against us.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Yourself.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Now, we're waring against flesh and
[1:04:24] blood, so we want to blame someone else.
[1:04:26] My problems are usually my wife.
[1:04:30] But that's a false statement.
[1:04:34] My problem is not my wife. My problem is
[1:04:37] me. As the prophet of God said,
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Satan uses that and we put the blame
[1:04:43] somewhere else because we don't want to
[1:04:46] have to claim our blame.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; We want it place it somewhere else. But
[1:04:51] God wants us to stop and examine what
[1:04:54] Satan's using against us. And then we
[1:04:57] can by the word and I'm I'm kind of
[1:04:59] speeding this up a little bit. By the
[1:05:01] word we recognize what Satan uses
[1:05:04] against us. We set that aside.
[1:05:07] That is a sin that so easily besets us.
[1:05:10] That's the unbelief that easily besets
[1:05:12] us. We have to consciously in and of
[1:05:15] ourselves recognize and say, "Lord, give
[1:05:18] me the strength. Give me the direction.
[1:05:20] and give me the desire to take this and
[1:05:22] set it to the side because I was not
[1:05:24] called to stand amongst those that were
[1:05:27] judged. Amen. Are going to be judged. We
[1:05:29] are already judged. We're standing here
[1:05:32] in this position today. Standing in
[1:05:34] this, anointed to stand in the day that
[1:05:37] we judge ourselves.
[1:05:40] Amen. That's what we're anointed to do.
[1:05:42] to stand in this day and judge oursself,
[1:05:45] not pushing it off to another day, but
[1:05:48] we want to set that aside and focus on
[1:05:52] running.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; I read a little clip here recently of a
[1:05:56] a man I I never knew his name and I
[1:05:59] don't remember it now, but um he he ran
[1:06:04] I think ultra marathons they call them.
[1:06:07] And people would ask him, how how can
[1:06:10] you do that when you run beyond the
[1:06:13] point that the medical field would say
[1:06:15] is beyond the point of exhaustion?
[1:06:19] How can you do that? And he says, even
[1:06:22] though it's over the horizon, I keep my
[1:06:24] eyes on the goal.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; He wasn't looking at, oh, this body's
[1:06:29] tired. Oh, this is this. Oh, this is
[1:06:32] that. But he just would look and say,
[1:06:34] "Over the hill is a goal, and I'm going
[1:06:37] to reach the goal." And I believe that
[1:06:40] that kind of thinking, not power of the
[1:06:42] mind, not not those kind of psychology
[1:06:45] things, but I think we need to stop and
[1:06:47] say, you know what? What is keeping me?
[1:06:50] What is keeping me, Lord? Let me set
[1:06:53] that aside and let my thoughts be wholly
[1:06:57] completely, solely upon you.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm here for. I'm not here
[1:07:01] to to uh acquire great wealth. I'm not
[1:07:04] here to to do this or to do that. I I'm
[1:07:07] here to live out the word of God. I'm
[1:07:09] I'm called to join. Amen. You talk about
[1:07:12] joining something. I want to join that
[1:07:15] great host of witnesses.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; I want to be one of those that would be
[1:07:18] called by the word of God. The Holy
[1:07:20] Spirit would say, "You are a witness."
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; I want to be identified in that.
[1:07:26] Amen. You see, the scripture says he's
[1:07:28] the author of our faith. Now, as the
[1:07:32] author, he starts to write the story,
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; but let's not forget he's the finisher.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It didn't stop where he's the
[1:07:40] author. Amen. He is the author and the
[1:07:44] finisher of our faith. Amen. You see,
[1:07:47] he's already paid the price. And that
[1:07:49] was the finishing of it all. He's
[1:07:51] already paid that price. And and I want
[1:07:53] to say let's not set that aside because
[1:07:56] you see if we set that aside, if Satan
[1:07:58] convinces us to set that aside, we have
[1:08:01] devalued
[1:08:05] the crucifixion.
[1:08:07] We've devalued
[1:08:09] the Holy Ghost. We've devalued God's
[1:08:13] plan. I don't want to be the man that
[1:08:15] stands before God and says, "I place no
[1:08:17] value
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; on what you said about me."
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; I placed no value on the very word that
[1:08:26] said, "I've come to make you a new
[1:08:28] creature in Christ Jesus." Oh, I
[1:08:31] couldn't do that.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; You've demeaned and devalued the word.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you want to get
[1:08:39] really stark about it, you've called God
[1:08:41] a liar.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's that's just brutal.
[1:08:46] But you see the scripture shows us very
[1:08:48] clearly that this battle can leave us
[1:08:50] weary
[1:08:52] and faint in our minds.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Now my brother and sister the word faint
[1:08:58] just to put this we understand what the
[1:09:01] word weary means.
[1:09:03] Um but faint
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; we can have a loss of consciousness
[1:09:11] like many a person has
[1:09:14] said you know I could never make the
[1:09:16] rapture and they go you might say
[1:09:19] unconscious and they just quit trying
[1:09:22] because they think that they can't.
[1:09:26] But it also means to become weak or to
[1:09:31] lack conviction.
[1:09:33] So to become faint, we can come to a
[1:09:36] place where weak and we lack conviction.
[1:09:40] My brother and sister, I don't want to
[1:09:41] deviate off into that tonight. But we
[1:09:44] understand as Revelation declares to us
[1:09:47] that I wer that you were hot or cold.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[1:09:53] because I'll spew you out of my mouth if
[1:09:55] you're lukewarm.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; See what Satan's trying to do? We can we
[1:10:01] can believe this message
[1:10:03] and become weak and lack conviction.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; But God wants us to be in the word
[1:10:10] present, not in a offendable position.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; But that we can take the very straight
[1:10:16] words of God. Amen. And say, "Well, it
[1:10:18] was the preacher that offended me." No,
[1:10:20] it's actually not the preacher if he's a
[1:10:22] real godly preacher. It's the word that
[1:10:25] offends people. It's the word that
[1:10:28] becomes the stumbling block. Amen. So,
[1:10:31] it's there. But when we stay focused,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; We don't become weak. We don't start to
[1:10:38] lack conviction.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; As the prophet of God said, you can't
[1:10:42] offend a real believer.
[1:10:45] And that's because the real believer is
[1:10:47] not an unbeliever and he's not a
[1:10:49] makebeliever. That's right.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; He's a believer.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. To keep our conviction. Now,
[1:10:59] excuse me. I'm just trying to seed the
[1:11:01] time. I don't want to. Second Timothy 2
[1:11:04] chapter verses 1-3.
[1:11:07] Um, now therefore, my son, be strong in
[1:11:10] the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
[1:11:13] Imagine now that we've been given grace,
[1:11:16] this bundle if you would call it, of
[1:11:18] grace that we can be strong in that or
[1:11:21] we can be weak in that.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, we don't take it serious
[1:11:28] enough to place its real intrinsic
[1:11:31] value.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; But you get a real believer
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; and and and we'll look at this and we'll
[1:11:38] say, "But I I I'm still struggle with
[1:11:41] this. I still there's this circumstance.
[1:11:43] You know they call them trigger points.
[1:11:45] Anybody have a trigger point?
[1:11:48] Anybody here that's not telling the
[1:11:50] truth?
[1:11:52] We all have a trigger point. Something
[1:11:54] that lights us up.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; But you see, my brother and sister, when
[1:11:59] we'll come and we're strong in the grace
[1:12:01] that God's given us. That's right.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Even if you get triggered,
[1:12:06] God's got a solution.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. God's got the antidote.
[1:12:11] That's right.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; For you and I.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Even if something,
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord will undo those
[1:12:18] triggers. He'll He'll kill them with
[1:12:20] time. Amen. And sometimes he kills them
[1:12:24] because you just get to the point you're
[1:12:25] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:12:28] and you just quit reacting to it because
[1:12:31] you're tired of reacting to it. Anybody
[1:12:34] know what I'm talking about? You know?
[1:12:36] Amen.
[1:12:38] and the things that thou hast heard of
[1:12:40] me among many witnesses, the same commit
[1:12:43] thou to faithful men who shall be able
[1:12:45] to teach others also. So it lays a very
[1:12:49] firm foundation here scripturally
[1:12:54] that the word is passed down.
[1:13:00] But the passing of the word, the
[1:13:02] teaching of the word must come with
[1:13:06] personal revelation.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we could be educated into
[1:13:11] this
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; and that won't work. Be thou therefore,
[1:13:15] thou therefore endure hardness as a good
[1:13:18] soldier of Jesus Christ. Now, my brother
[1:13:20] and sister, there's two kinds of
[1:13:22] hardnesses in the world. A hardness,
[1:13:25] let's just talk about uh being a good
[1:13:27] soldier. There's a hardness that comes
[1:13:29] with being trained a and engaging, being
[1:13:32] involved, becoming part of that
[1:13:35] conditions you that you are not a weak
[1:13:38] and weary Christian. You're not going to
[1:13:40] lose consciousness. You're not going to
[1:13:43] give up. You're not going to be faint
[1:13:44] because you've been conditioned into a
[1:13:46] hardened state that you are a good
[1:13:49] soldier able to stand and fight in the
[1:13:51] battle. And then there's a hardness that
[1:13:53] Satan likes. And that's the one what
[1:13:55] comes down on the heart that the word of
[1:13:58] God cannot penetrate the heart because
[1:14:01] it's hard. It's it's it's h brought to a
[1:14:04] place that nothing can penetrate it.
[1:14:07] Amen. See the difference? One is a
[1:14:09] conditioning that comes from the inside
[1:14:11] out. The other is a conditioning that
[1:14:13] comes from the outside in. And when it
[1:14:15] comes from the outside in, it will be
[1:14:18] that point. And I've made light of this
[1:14:20] in the past, and I don't really mean to
[1:14:21] tonight, but you know, there's those
[1:14:23] that we can be singing the song, I shall
[1:14:26] not be moved. And there's two different
[1:14:28] beliefs in the church as they sing this
[1:14:30] song because one saying the word of God
[1:14:33] is real, the gospel is real, the Holy
[1:14:35] Ghost is real, and I know that I as a
[1:14:38] son of God am real. And the other one is
[1:14:40] there. They can't change me. They can't
[1:14:43] do this. They can't influence me. I can.
[1:14:46] They won't do it. Amen. The song, same
[1:14:49] song.
[1:14:50] Two entirely different reactions. But we
[1:14:54] look at this. See, God wants you and I
[1:14:56] to be conditioned. Not a callous as in
[1:15:00] being callous to the gospel, to be
[1:15:04] conditioned.
[1:15:05] When Satan sits there with his fiery
[1:15:08] darts,
[1:15:12] it's going to be
[1:15:15] it won't work. Satan,
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; I've been conditioned by the word.
[1:15:21] Amen. I've been hardened in this battle
[1:15:25] to see the ws of the enemy and to be
[1:15:29] able to stand and fight. Not give up and
[1:15:31] run, but to fight. Satan, I'm gonna take
[1:15:35] your weapon, which might be my very
[1:15:38] nature.
[1:15:40] Are you with me?
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Might be my very nature. That arrow
[1:15:45] might be coming out of your heart. It's
[1:15:46] your very nature. And by the grace of
[1:15:50] God,
[1:15:51] snap.
[1:15:53] Not to be used against me. This is heart
[1:15:57] belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ, not
[1:16:00] you, Satan.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; You're a thief. You're a liar. That's
[1:16:04] right.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And you cannot take this heart. Amen.
[1:16:08] Amen.
[1:16:10] Because you see, we'll be battle
[1:16:12] hardened. Amen. When we get to glory, my
[1:16:15] brother and sister, some of these scars,
[1:16:17] I'm not even going to ask you if you
[1:16:18] have any scars in your life. I'm just
[1:16:20] going to make an emphatic statement. The
[1:16:22] scars you bear in your life that cause
[1:16:25] you grief right now will actually become
[1:16:28] trophies
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; before our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; That I overcome this. I overcome this
[1:16:36] grievously hurt. Overcome it by the
[1:16:40] grace of God.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, we're anointed to stand in
[1:16:46] this day. Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; The most wicked, the darkest of all
[1:16:49] ages. We've been anointed by God to
[1:16:51] stand in this day. Not to fall down, not
[1:16:54] to die, not to turn and run, but to
[1:16:56] stand. Amen. And when we've done all to
[1:16:59] stand, stand.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what God's telling us.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Because you see, no battle, no victory.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; No victory, no testimony. That's right.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look, Brother Bram says in the
[1:17:13] junction of time, I've got just a couple
[1:17:16] more minutes if you don't mind. In the
[1:17:18] junction of time, Brother Bram, God
[1:17:20] doesn't promise a flowery bed of ease.
[1:17:23] Don't falsify a Christian. Amen. I like
[1:17:27] that. Don't talk about flowery bed. It's
[1:17:29] going to be all blessing. God wants to
[1:17:31] make you rich. Don't Don't falsify being
[1:17:33] a Christian. Don't falsify a Christian.
[1:17:35] And don't falsify the message by telling
[1:17:38] them everything's going to be all right.
[1:17:40] There's nothing going to harm you.
[1:17:42] There's nothing going to ain't no trials
[1:17:45] or nothing. That's wrong. As a poet
[1:17:47] said, must I be carried to heaven on a
[1:17:50] flowery bed of ease while others fought
[1:17:52] to win the prize and sailed through
[1:17:55] bloody seas? No, sir. God doesn't
[1:17:57] promise ease and prosperity, but he
[1:18:00] promises grace to endure in every time.
[1:18:04] It's grace that we look to.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; I say amen to that tonight. Amen. It's
[1:18:10] sometimes grievious. Sometimes it's
[1:18:12] painful. Sometimes we just think, "I
[1:18:14] just quit." Amen. I'm sorry to say this,
[1:18:17] but I believe in transparency. I've quit
[1:18:19] as your pastor so many times that nobody
[1:18:22] believes me.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't even believe me. Amen.
[1:18:27] Because my flesh, if I listen to my
[1:18:31] flesh, it says, "Ah, I'm not doing
[1:18:33] this." But there's something an
[1:18:35] anointing that comes down and my soul
[1:18:37] says this is what you were called for.
[1:18:39] Do what you're called for. Come and
[1:18:42] respond to the word that called you.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we look to that grace and that
[1:18:47] grace is what brings us back up. Gives
[1:18:50] us a strength to face.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And I say this emphatically
[1:18:54] every challenge of our lives.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a single challenge that grace
[1:19:02] will not take us through.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:09] Philippians 4 1-9.
[1:19:16] I'll skip through some of this.
[1:19:22] I started at verse one, but we'll jump
[1:19:24] down.
[1:19:26] Be careful for nothing, but in
[1:19:28] everything by prayer and supplication
[1:19:30] with thanksgiving, let your requests be
[1:19:32] made known unto God. Amen. That ought to
[1:19:35] be something that we would put more. Not
[1:19:38] paralyzed.
[1:19:40] Not paralyzed by fear,
[1:19:43] not paralyzed by circumstance,
[1:19:45] not paralyzed by our own failure,
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; our own flesh. Not paralyzed by that.
[1:19:56] I was called
[1:19:58] to be an overcomer of this age.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; And I am.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; But Paul, no. No buts. I was called.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And I am.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; And if my God's not powerful enough to
[1:20:13] fulfill his word in my life, then we're
[1:20:16] in trouble. That's
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; But he is.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; And he already has.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; And we are the recipients.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. of the power of God. So by prayer
[1:20:27] and supplication with thanksgiving. See
[1:20:29] I think sometimes we do all the rest the
[1:20:31] prayer and and our idea of supplication
[1:20:34] but there's no thanksgiving in there.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; We need to be saying thank you Lord.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Imagine the culture we would create as a
[1:20:43] group of believers as families as
[1:20:45] individuals if in the worst of times
[1:20:48] we're like thank you Lord for this
[1:20:49] trial. Yeah.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the trouble that's
[1:20:53] hit the church. Thank you, Lord, for the
[1:20:55] trouble that's hit my family. Thank you,
[1:20:57] Lord, for this circumstance. Thank you,
[1:20:59] Lord, for everything. Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:01] Because you can talk that way when you
[1:21:04] have a complete confidence that God
[1:21:07] said, "It is finished." And he was
[1:21:10] talking to you.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; If you think he's talking to brother so
[1:21:15] and so the minister and this evangelist
[1:21:18] and this guy over here and those my
[1:21:20] brother and sister, the devil will beat
[1:21:22] you and beat you and beat you and beat
[1:21:26] you. But when you realize it was as
[1:21:29] though God was standing right in front
[1:21:32] of you
[1:21:34] and said, "It is finished."
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; This work I've begun in you.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; it is finished. Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; The calling I put in your life, it is
[1:21:44] finished.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Everything you need to make the rapture,
[1:21:47] it is finished.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Totally change our approach. None of
[1:21:52] this up and down, up
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; and down.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:01] Okay. Power of transformation. I want to
[1:22:04] read this quote to start the service,
[1:22:06] but we'll use it to finish it.
[1:22:11] Now, we're not a perfect people.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say amen for you. We're not a
[1:22:25] perfect people. We make our mistakes. We
[1:22:29] do things that's wrong. But you see,
[1:22:31] love covers all of that.
[1:22:36] We're willing when we see our mistakes
[1:22:38] to come back and apologize to one
[1:22:40] another. Yeah. That's warriors,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. Oh, no. Surely that's for the
[1:22:47] weak to come back and say, "I'm sorry.
[1:22:51] That's for the wimps, the warriors, the
[1:22:53] bold ones. They never say sorry."
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Not true.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Not true.
[1:23:01] That's a lie out of the pits of hell.
[1:23:05] Amen. The prophet of God hit it right on
[1:23:07] the head. Yep. That's warriors. That's
[1:23:11] really men and women. That's gallant.
[1:23:13] Any man can go out to the battlefield
[1:23:15] that's got nerve enough to walk out
[1:23:17] there, but when he gets knocked down,
[1:23:20] then get up and try it again. See, there
[1:23:23] used to be a song that a young man and a
[1:23:26] young woman used to sing in the church.
[1:23:28] If I fall or if I fail. See, if I fall
[1:23:32] or if I I forget how it goes, let me
[1:23:35] rise and try again.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Lord, and try me one more
[1:23:43] time.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; In our failure that paralyzes us, let us
[1:23:50] be like this.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; If I fall or if I sin,
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; let me rise and try again.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is my heart. Just forgive me,
[1:24:01] Lord, and try me one more time.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Can we relate to this?
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is this real to us? It's not for
[1:24:10] us. I guess I can't do it. Look, I just
[1:24:13] fell down. I just failed. I just I can't
[1:24:17] No. Lord,
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; let me rise.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; And try again.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Sister Ruth, if you would come.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. My brother and sister, we were
[1:24:26] anointed to stand in this day. Yeah.
[1:24:29] Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; In our weakness, in our failure, in our
[1:24:34] victory,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; everything that is in our life,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; God is in control of.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; And we were anointed
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; to be finishers.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Called to set aside everything that
[1:24:50] would beset us.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; And run the race with the finish line
[1:24:56] clearly.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. in our vision. Amen. Can
[1:25:00] we say thank you Lord tonight? Amen. For
[1:25:03] his word that would just make it so
[1:25:05] assured in our hearts
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; that we were called to run this race
[1:25:10] right here. I had a brother some time
[1:25:12] back. I understood the point he was
[1:25:14] trying to make, but I I I just felt like
[1:25:16] he was missing a point. And he said,
[1:25:19] "Oh, how would have loved to been back
[1:25:22] in another age.
[1:25:28] I thought about what the brother said
[1:25:30] for a moment and I said, "Brother, um,
[1:25:34] why do you say that?" And he said, "Man,
[1:25:36] this age is so hard." Now, I'm going to
[1:25:39] make a statement. I probably don't have
[1:25:41] anything to back this up.
[1:25:46] Every age
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; was hard.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Every age seemed insurmountable.
[1:25:55] Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Every age.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; If we were back in Philadelphia
[1:26:03] trying to sort between Luther
[1:26:08] and Wesley
[1:26:10] and all of these things, it's like,
[1:26:12] who's telling the truth?
[1:26:15] Go back to the colosums.
[1:26:18] What it must be like.
[1:26:21] They did these kind of cruel things. And
[1:26:23] I don't say it just to put a bad memory
[1:26:25] in your things, but they would chain men
[1:26:29] in the end of the arena and then send
[1:26:32] their wife and children and they
[1:26:35] literally were forced to watch.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; What happened to their wife and
[1:26:40] children?
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; I find that stunning.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; I find it. And we can go back in the
[1:26:48] history of Nika.
[1:26:50] They come right down and they went into
[1:26:53] Nika because they thought we can change
[1:26:55] them. They realized they couldn't.
[1:26:58] History shows that th many of those men
[1:27:01] never made it home because they sent
[1:27:02] assassins
[1:27:04] to track them down and kill them lest
[1:27:07] the truth would be taken back to the
[1:27:10] people
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; of what was happening at Nika.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Does any of that sound easy?
[1:27:19] But a prophet come and gave us an
[1:27:21] insight. You see, they were never told
[1:27:24] what was happening to them.
[1:27:27] But by prophetic insight,
[1:27:30] you and I see the ws of the devil. We
[1:27:34] see his plan. And he's still slippery
[1:27:38] enough
[1:27:39] to pull us in sometimes.
[1:27:42] But I'm telling you as we closed out
[1:27:44] that quote, "Though I fall, Lord, let me
[1:27:48] rise to fight again."
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Because you see, we see what God said
[1:27:56] about Job and we see about what God said
[1:27:59] about you and I. But Job never had that
[1:28:02] advantage. He went into this greatest
[1:28:04] trial of his life. Had no idea that God
[1:28:07] said what he said about him.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; That's it. But we stand here today by
[1:28:13] prophetic word knowing we as the bride
[1:28:15] of Christ cannot be lost, cannot be
[1:28:19] deceived, will never be forsaken, but
[1:28:22] are redeemed and washed in the blood of
[1:28:25] the lamb. And we are the overcomers.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; And we have that advantage. And we still
[1:28:31] have our battles.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; But we are anointed
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; to stand.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:28:41] He lives. 5:49, brother Alex.
[1:28:44] Amen.
[1:28:46] Let's just stand. We'll ask our brother
[1:28:49] Alex to come and just help us with the
[1:28:53] song. Amen.
[1:28:56] I serve a risen Savior.
[1:29:00] Okay. Serve a risen Savior.
[1:29:04] He's in the world today.
[1:29:09] know that he is living.
[1:29:13] Whatever men may say,
[1:29:17] I see his hand of mercy,
[1:29:21] I hear his voice of cheer.
[1:29:25] And just the time I need him, he's
[1:29:30] always
[1:29:32] near.
[1:29:33] He lives.
[1:29:35] He lives.
[1:29:37] Christ Jesus lives today.
[1:29:41] He walks with me and talks with me.
[1:29:45] Along life's narrow way.
[1:29:49] He lives.
[1:29:51] He lives.
[1:29:53] Salvation to impart.
[1:29:59] You ask me how I know he lives.
[1:30:05] He lives
[1:30:08] within
[1:30:10] my heart.
[1:30:14] In all the world around me, I see his
[1:30:19] loving care.
[1:30:22] And though my heart grows weary,
[1:30:26] I never will despair.
[1:30:30] I know that he is leading
[1:30:34] through all the stormy blast. The day of
[1:30:40] his appearing
[1:30:42] will come at last.
[1:30:46] He lives.
[1:30:48] He lives. Christ Jesus lives today.
[1:30:54] He walks with me and talks with me. A
[1:30:59] long life's narrow way.
[1:31:02] He lives.
[1:31:04] He lives.
[1:31:06] Salvation to impart.
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:12] You ask me how I know he lives.
[1:31:19] He lives
[1:31:22] within
[1:31:24] my heart.
[1:31:28] Rejoice, rejoice, oh Christian.
[1:31:31] Lift up your voice and sing.
[1:31:35] Eternal hallelu
[1:31:39] to Jesus Christ the King.
[1:31:43] The hope of all who seek him to help to
[1:31:48] all who find. Another is so loving, so
[1:31:54] good and kind.
[1:31:57] He lives.
[1:31:59] He lives.
[1:32:01] Christ Jesus lives today.
[1:32:05] He walks with me and talks with me along
[1:32:10] life's narrow way.
[1:32:13] He lives.
[1:32:15] He lives
[1:32:17] sorry to impart.
[1:32:22] You ask me how I know he lives.
[1:32:30] He lives
[1:32:32] within
[1:32:34] my heart.
[1:32:39] Amen.
[1:32:41] Um, can we sing? Can you find Hold to
[1:32:44] God's unchanging hand?
