[36:30] want to encourage the teachers
[36:33] um to to be able to find a conclusion uh
[36:37] to lessons and we'll definitely have
[36:41] that finished before we go to Family

[36:46] anyway that will will uh come to
[36:49] conclusion in the next couple weeks for
[36:51] a summer break uh brother Chris I
[36:53] believe announced to the young adults
[36:55] today that that will go into summer
[36:58] break and um that definitely don't take
[37:01] that as uh cause to just go on vacation
[37:04] from the house of God let's be fervent
[37:07] to be in the house of the Lord amen I I
[37:10] personally believe uh while he is with
[37:13] us walking with us guiding us every day
[37:15] there is something incredibly
[37:18] Supernatural about meeting our Lord
[37:20] Jesus Christ here in the house of God
[37:22] Amen so as the word says not forsaking
[37:26] the assembling of ourselves I want to
[37:28] speak to you once again on the thought
[37:30] of things that are to be and this is a
[37:33] carryover from last week as we're
[37:35] talking uh thank you musicians and song
[37:38] leaders amen a continuation of the
[37:42] thought of the elect lady and
[37:45] um my brother and sister there sometimes
[37:48] that we just have to recognize that
[37:51] there is
[37:53] there is something warm and fuzzy
[37:56] about realizing someone is giving you a
[38:00] compliment someone is speaking up as it
[38:03] were to you lifting you up and and it
[38:05] just causes something to happen when you
[38:08] hear a kind word when you hear an
[38:10] encouraging word thank you for a job
[38:13] well done it does something to us in our
[38:16] humanity and I would trust today that as
[38:19] you look in the word of God that you
[38:22] would have that reaction it's okay to
[38:24] have that reaction in the flesh amen
[38:27] just I'm sorry to phrase it that way I
[38:29] just want to keep it simple but to have
[38:31] that warm fuzzy feeling in the flesh is
[38:34] good but it should be something that
[38:36] strikes Us in the soul that we realize
[38:39] God loves us so much that he has
[38:41] recorded Us in his word for time in
[38:45] eternity amen and so as we turn in our
[38:47] Bibles amen want to speak to you today
[38:50] on an extension of last week and we're
[38:53] going to speak or title it the love of
[38:55] the truth amen and turn in your Bibles
[38:57] to second John the first chapter now
[39:00] we're going to shorten
[39:02] those verses
[39:04] down to just the first and second verses
[39:06] of second John 1. amen now as we speak
[39:11] to this and I certainly asked this
[39:12] morning you would say a prayer for me
[39:15] we've been out in the dust and the uh
[39:19] all of the springtime things here and
[39:21] our voice and congestion Etc
[39:25] um but um if you just give a little
[39:27] prayer our voice would hold up for this
[39:29] service
[39:30] the Elder
[39:32] lady
[39:34] now my brother and
[39:36] Elders in the church not just simply
[39:38] that they would be men of authority over
[39:40] others or men to to absolutely dictate
[39:45] but the elders were there for us to look
[39:49] to we find it all through this scripture
[39:52] that God has put men in a position of
[39:56] authority not to lift those men up but
[40:00] for those men to have a voice of
[40:03] experience
[40:04] and that is why that we as Christians uh
[40:08] we elect uh men into offices uh the word
[40:13] of God says you don't uh have a novice
[40:16] in in these high offices but you want
[40:18] men and it's not because they can say
[40:21] I'm older than you so listen to me but
[40:24] it is by the experience amen and what
[40:27] we're looking for today is not to say a
[40:30] young man can't have the experience
[40:31] because God has certainly taken young
[40:34] men through the fire we have not just
[40:37] young men but young brothers and sisters
[40:40] have gone through the fire Satan comes
[40:42] and he wants to attack in every Avenue
[40:44] and the world we live in today my
[40:47] brother and sister Satan has so anointed
[40:49] it that when people are attacked in the
[40:52] mind or in the spirit that they feel
[40:55] like there must be a deficiency in them
[40:58] but the word of God so clearly shows us
[41:01] that we each won the prophet clarifies
[41:04] it that we each one have a weakness and
[41:07] Satan recognizes that weakness and
[41:10] attacks it that's why we want to keep
[41:13] the things of our lives under the blood
[41:15] of Jesus Christ to be in fellowship with
[41:18] him and Satan then cannot come and do
[41:21] that but Satan has put a stigma into
[41:24] certain aspects of Our Lives to say well
[41:27] I'm a failure in this uh particular
[41:30] situation no we are not failures my
[41:33] brother and sister but that is the
[41:35] Avenue by which Satan recognizes he can
[41:38] attack you and cause and get a reaction
[41:41] so it's there the elders now speaking to
[41:45] the elect lady and her children whom I
[41:48] love in the truth now this is not to say
[41:50] that he doesn't love them overall but
[41:53] what he's declaring is there's a
[41:55] position in truth
[41:57] that we all come together today and call
[42:00] ourselves brothers and sisters call
[42:02] ourselves the body of Christ call
[42:04] ourselves a body of Believers and so
[42:07] he's not saying I don't love you if
[42:09] you're not in truth but he's saying I
[42:11] love you through the truth amen that the
[42:14] truth is bringing a Unity into this body
[42:17] that is bonding us together now sorry
[42:20] for just an everyday example but if you
[42:23] ever wonder many years ago when I was
[42:25] young starting in the trades and and
[42:27] doing you know they come around and
[42:29] little things that they use to prove to
[42:31] you when liquid nails first come out you
[42:35] know they were coming around saying this
[42:37] is what you need to use on your
[42:38] construction sites and they would be
[42:40] there and they would say here glue these
[42:42] two two befores together and just leave
[42:46] them for six hours and then try to take
[42:49] them apart and what would happen my
[42:51] brother and sister in just a mere six
[42:53] hours the bond between those boards was
[42:56] stronger than and the board themselves
[42:58] and you could beat on that until there
[43:00] was just this ribbon of wood on each
[43:03] side of the glue that was so bonded
[43:05] together and that's what the word of God
[43:07] is doing in your life and in my life by
[43:10] the truth today it's bonding us to Jesus
[43:13] Christ so tightly that the world can
[43:16] tear everything down around us even
[43:19] maybe our health and the world would
[43:21] question our sanity but it doesn't
[43:23] matter because we have been bound to
[43:25] Jesus Christ amen and that word is what
[43:29] is our very life
[43:31] amen
[43:32] amen
[43:34] whom I love in the truth and not I only
[43:37] but also all they that have known the
[43:40] truth for the true sake which dwelleth
[43:43] in US amen it's not something external
[43:46] it's in US
[43:47] and shall be with us let's say this
[43:50] together forever
[43:53] amen not a temporary fix that God has in
[43:56] our life
[43:57] but an eternal fix
[43:59] Heavenly Father we ask for your
[44:01] blessings on the word today in your name
[44:03] we pray amen you may be seated Saints
[44:18] this relationship
[44:20] that John is speaking about and to the
[44:23] elect lady
[44:24] is built on something much greater
[44:28] much more than a regular human
[44:30] Foundation
[44:32] as we would come and realize that love
[44:35] can be so great that one would lay his
[44:37] life down for his brother for his sister
[44:40] this relationship that the elect lady
[44:43] has
[44:45] it is one that is so strong because you
[44:47] see my brother and sister it's not that
[44:50] she has just experienced truth or
[44:53] believes truth she has become truth and
[44:57] when she become truth it was the very
[44:59] life of God the very nature or
[45:02] characteristic of God has then possessed
[45:05] or taken her over now the devil would
[45:08] come and say but you still make mistakes
[45:10] and that's a you know kind of set you
[45:13] apart yes that's called the human
[45:15] element and my brother and sister God
[45:17] saved us in spite of the human element
[45:19] somebody ought to say thank you Lord for
[45:22] that because if it was a human element
[45:24] that dictated whether we were saved or
[45:27] not there would be no flesh saved the
[45:29] scripture tells us there would be no
[45:31] possible way but God has come and he has
[45:34] built upon a relationship that is of his
[45:37] very nature amen and we'll find that
[45:40] while we won't go into it today we'll
[45:43] find my brother and sister maybe a
[45:44] little homework that you could do of the
[45:48] relationship of Love versus affection
[45:50] and my brother and sister people have a
[45:54] lot of affection for the gospel
[45:56] but affection is just merely a fondness
[46:00] affection is not a deep rooted
[46:03] life-changing experience now I want to
[46:07] say this in the right connection so that
[46:09] no one would misunderstand me today and
[46:11] come up with some strange deal but
[46:13] sisters of this church I have a great
[46:16] amount of affection for you and if you
[46:20] look at that in the proper context I'm
[46:22] very fond of you I'm I'm very happy to
[46:25] call you my sisters I'm very happy to
[46:28] have you as friends to be in Fellowship
[46:31] but as a prophet of God spoke and he's
[46:34] talking about this relationship and
[46:36] we'll just bump this for a second the
[46:38] prophet of God says now there's
[46:39] wonderful sisters there there's Godly
[46:42] sisters and women here in the building
[46:44] but there'll only be one who goes home
[46:47] with me tonight and she is identified as
[46:50] Mrs William Branham you see brother
[46:53] Branham had a deep abiding affection for
[46:56] the Bride of Jesus Christ but in the
[46:59] natural sense that was only one that he
[47:02] would then declare I love in that
[47:05] context now my brother and sister if you
[47:07] talk to this and you look into this
[47:10] research this you'll find that the
[47:12] prophet declares that he loved this
[47:15] bride of Christ that God give him the
[47:17] privilege of preaching to it is not that
[47:19] he said I'm affectionate of you then I'm
[47:22] fond of you you're nice people but he
[47:26] really had a deep Abiding Love and I say
[47:29] today Lord let me have a deep Abiding
[47:32] Love For The Bride of Jesus Christ but
[47:35] let it be in the same context that John
[47:37] is speaking here to the elect lady he's
[47:40] not bringing himself into a relationship
[47:43] with the elect lady but he is bringing
[47:46] the elect lady into a relationship with
[47:48] Jesus Christ and that could be one of
[47:51] the issues we see around the messages
[47:52] people have drawn to themselves there
[47:55] have been those that bring and they draw
[47:58] people to themselves my brother and
[48:00] sister that's not right I don't care who
[48:02] we are what position we occupy our whole
[48:05] goal as ministers is to draw people into
[48:08] a love affair with Jesus Christ amen
[48:11] anything short of that we have failed or
[48:14] been Direct in our duty amen so we must
[48:17] understand the context of Love versus
[48:20] affection now the foundation my brother
[48:22] and sister of Truth we can come and know
[48:26] that God spoke so strongly through the
[48:28] Apostle Paul that he said if there be
[48:31] any that would come and even change one
[48:34] word of this and let them be accursed
[48:36] and the reason was is there can only be
[48:39] one love letter
[48:42] there cannot be a multitude of Love
[48:44] Letters it has to be one love letter now
[48:48] I say this in humor amen it's just a
[48:50] human element uh brother Paul never
[48:53] never really was too much of a I don't
[48:56] know how you would say it but you know a
[48:59] lot of uh you know not a lot of young
[49:01] ladies said y'all you're our friend Paul
[49:03] but you know there was one young lady
[49:05] that wanted to have the title or the
[49:07] name of Mrs Paul heylet and after she
[49:11] had obtained that title she pulled out a
[49:14] huge box that was all the letters of
[49:16] girls that Paul had wrote through the
[49:18] years and she said you know what you're
[49:20] married now you have a wife and these
[49:24] letters now mean nothing to you
[49:28] foreign
[49:31] I hope you catch the connection my
[49:33] brother and sister this elect lady this
[49:36] bride of Jesus Christ
[49:38] is not here to have multiples of Love
[49:41] Letters
[49:43] but only one love letter
[49:45] amen only one that would would be and
[49:48] that's the one that has our heart that's
[49:50] the one that has our attention that is
[49:52] the one that is drawing us that's the
[49:55] voice that we hear and that is the voice
[49:58] we respond to Can someone say Amen to
[50:01] that amen so this Foundation of Truth is
[50:04] in its intrinsic value somewhat
[50:07] unexplainable how is it that we love
[50:09] let's just look in the natural for a
[50:11] moment amen if I was rude enough I would
[50:14] use our visitors for an example as they
[50:17] are newly married or
[50:19] are you still considered newly married
[50:21] yes the honeymoon is still happening
[50:24] amen that's good you see my brother and
[50:27] sister in the natural it's hard to
[50:30] explain now I don't mean to sound crass
[50:34] but you can have a whole row of
[50:36] beautiful holy ghost-filled girls and it
[50:39] would be their young man filled with the
[50:41] Holy Ghost and you would think you know
[50:43] what man he is a good looking young man
[50:46] he's got his pick you might say but
[50:48] really he doesn't because you see there
[50:51] is an intrinsic connection that is there
[50:54] of a whole row of young Godly ladies but
[50:57] they'll be the one that the life is a
[51:00] little different the approach the nature
[51:03] all of this is a little different and
[51:05] that is the one he's attracted to as we
[51:08] have the story of the uh the ranch wife
[51:11] you know the orphan girl there and uh
[51:14] the the ranch and and she's there and
[51:17] you know the armor Meat Packer's son
[51:19] comes my brother and sister in the flesh
[51:22] he should have been attracted to the
[51:25] rich girl
[51:27] finely dressed
[51:29] but he had a revelation aren't you glad
[51:32] God gives Revelation he had a revelation
[51:34] that this wasn't about the clothes that
[51:37] they wore this wasn't about the finery
[51:39] that they lived in or the culture that
[51:42] they had but this was about character
[51:44] and there's something in this
[51:46] relationship that draws a young man to a
[51:48] young woman and in that there's
[51:50] something that's there and you'll find
[51:52] after years and years we have those that
[51:55] have been married longer than we have
[51:56] but sister Jerry and I at 40 years
[51:58] there's just something about that that
[52:01] wild maniacal laughter that my wife has
[52:04] you all know what I'm talking about amen
[52:07] okay I've got the Ice broke my brother
[52:09] and sister if I don't hear that laughter
[52:12] I start to say where is she
[52:16] and I don't say that derogatory it's
[52:18] become very much a part of it I married
[52:21] it
[52:25] but you see there can't be another voice
[52:28] that's why in the natural the scripture
[52:31] says that a a wife
[52:34] amen has a voice that she's supposed to
[52:37] listen to
[52:39] she's supposed to listen to the Holy
[52:41] Ghost
[52:42] and she's supposed to listen to her
[52:43] husband
[52:45] and now I don't mean to go into this and
[52:47] I don't want to focus this but when they
[52:49] start to listen to voices
[52:51] that are contrary
[52:54] then it Causes Chaos
[52:56] and in the chaos there's friction and in
[52:59] the friction there's division
[53:02] and in division there's separation
[53:06] there's two voices we as the bride of
[53:08] Christ are called and that's to listen
[53:10] to the voice of the holy spirit in our
[53:12] day and to listen to the voice of the
[53:15] revealed word of the hour my brother and
[53:17] sister are not any other voices those
[53:19] voices too many voices just talking to
[53:21] brother Chris this morning sometimes
[53:23] we're going to cut out all the voices
[53:25] and just get it down to just very
[53:28] Simplicity of the voices my brother and
[53:31] sister because of too many voices too
[53:33] many opinions lead to too many thoughts
[53:36] too many thoughts lead to confusion
[53:38] and so it's there that we find this
[53:41] intrinsic value is unexplainable why are
[53:44] you attracted to the word
[53:46] this elect lady she's John is saying I
[53:49] love her because she's in truth
[53:53] she's in the truth and I love her he's
[53:56] recognizing that she herself has heard
[53:59] from God it's not her listening to the
[54:02] preacher it's not listening to this one
[54:04] over here and that one over there but
[54:06] she's listening to God this elect lady
[54:09] is she knows the voice she's supposed to
[54:12] listen to and she's listening to it and
[54:15] so it's there this intrinsic value is
[54:18] kind of unexplainable how God would take
[54:20] and lead you to truth is there not
[54:22] voices in the land amen young people I'm
[54:24] not picking on you today but I can
[54:26] assure you you can walk out of here
[54:28] today you could go on a phone you could
[54:31] go on a computer laptop iPad and
[54:34] there'll be so many voices dressed like
[54:36] this do this talk like this act like
[54:39] this it's all over voices voices voices
[54:42] and they say I want my own identity but
[54:45] they don't have an identity because
[54:47] there's only two identities on the face
[54:49] of the Earth and one of them is Jesus
[54:51] Christ and the other one is called Satan
[54:54] amen everything if I'm going to use the
[54:57] word and you'll forgive me for using it
[54:59] this way everything in this life is an
[55:02] impersonation
[55:05] we're either like the devil
[55:07] or we're like Christ there's no medium
[55:10] there's no substitute we're just
[55:12] listening to One Voice or the other
[55:15] I've done this before and I don't mean
[55:17] to make light of it and I don't want it
[55:19] to be offensive but when you see these
[55:21] young men and I know a few that dress
[55:23] that way and they're walking down this
[55:25] street and they have to walk like a
[55:26] jaybird to keep their pants up
[55:29] and you ask why are you doing this I
[55:31] have done this why do you dress like
[55:34] this I want to have my own identity then
[55:37] why is there ten thousand other young
[55:40] men just like you if this is your own
[55:43] identity
[55:44] you see it's a delusion my brother and
[55:46] sister and when the word of God said in
[55:48] the day that we're living that this
[55:50] churches would produce a certain
[55:53] identity my brother and sister if that
[55:55] identity does not have the name Mrs
[55:58] Jesus Christ attached to it and backed
[56:01] up by the word then she's impersonating
[56:04] something else am I preaching too
[56:06] strongly this morning
[56:08] you see God's not wanting us to fool
[56:10] around
[56:11] amen so look at this this connection
[56:14] that someone unexplainable is the
[56:17] connection between Christ and his church
[56:19] you see he went and he faced all of
[56:22] these things my brother and sister so
[56:24] that you would come today and I mean
[56:27] today literally the 21st day of May that
[56:31] you could sit here in the house of God
[56:33] and say thank you Lord for the
[56:35] Revelation that connected me to truth
[56:38] amen I don't need another connection I
[56:40] don't need a theological explanation I
[56:43] need a revelation that came from God and
[56:46] God alone I don't need someone to
[56:49] explain it yes we as preachers we like
[56:51] to explain things but what we really
[56:54] want is for you yourself to get a
[56:57] revelation directly from the Throne of
[57:00] God to your heart
[57:02] we can tell you young people how to live
[57:05] of what to do and not to do but until it
[57:09] becomes real to you it is just some old
[57:12] man telling you do and don't but when it
[57:16] becomes Revelation that rests down in
[57:19] your soul then you understand this
[57:22] intrinsic connection that you have had
[57:24] with Jesus Christ from the foundation of
[57:27] the world oh God how we should pray for
[57:30] that connection we should pray for that
[57:32] Revelation amen
[57:34] now the select lady as I got ahead of
[57:37] myself she only has one true love
[57:43] there's only one true love that there's
[57:45] there's nothing on this Earth
[57:47] amen they once pinned a song Take This
[57:50] horror world
[57:52] but give me Jesus
[57:54] a lot of people would say well I don't
[57:56] know if I could live in this house and
[57:59] have this kind of money and a car the
[58:02] boat the plane and the train
[58:05] you are not love
[58:08] you're not in love if that's even a
[58:10] consideration that you would trade your
[58:12] relationship with Jesus Christ for a
[58:15] house or both train a plane you're not
[58:17] in love
[58:19] but when one becomes in love and God
[58:21] would call you to the backside of the
[58:23] desert when God would call you my
[58:26] brother and sister come on I'm going to
[58:28] speak plane this morning okay amen how
[58:30] many of us have faced fiery trials in
[58:32] our lives come on let's be honest with
[58:35] ourselves we Face fiery trials things
[58:37] that we just it seems as though our
[58:40] world has crumbled but there's something
[58:42] inside of you that the final voice you
[58:45] cry out is Lord help me amen this is
[58:49] nothing less than this intrinsic
[58:51] relationship with Jesus Christ because
[58:54] if it was not there in your life in my
[58:57] life when that time of fiery trial come
[58:59] we would give up we would walk away we
[59:03] would say I'm finished I am not going to
[59:06] sacrifice like this but there's
[59:08] something down inside of us that we
[59:10] might drift away for a season but God's
[59:13] right there the whole time wooing us
[59:15] back pulling us by saying no I'm not
[59:19] letting go of you I can't let go of you
[59:22] because I'm in you and I can't let go of
[59:25] myself
[59:27] not the same relationship of a husband
[59:29] and a wife you can't go one that you
[59:32] ever truly was in love with you can't
[59:34] let go of them because they are a part
[59:37] of you
[59:39] um
[59:40] I hope you're catching the depth of this
[59:44] amen
[59:46] now look at this it's select lady one
[59:49] true love
[59:50] now the word says she's not in love with
[59:52] the world
[59:54] you say brother Paul that's not exactly
[59:55] the way this scripture says it says that
[59:57] if you have any love of the world the
[59:59] love of Christ is not in you but I'm
[1:00:01] telling you my brother and sister this
[1:00:03] bride of Christ has the love of Christ
[1:00:04] in her
[1:00:06] so therefore she's never been in love
[1:00:08] with the world she don't belong to the
[1:00:09] world the world don't belong to her
[1:00:11] she's in Christ
[1:00:13] amen that's the love affair of her life
[1:00:16] it doesn't matter whether she's rich or
[1:00:18] poor hot or cold in the uh you know the
[1:00:21] mountains or the deserts or wherever it
[1:00:23] might be none of that matters she has
[1:00:26] one love
[1:00:28] amen and I'll declare it this way today
[1:00:31] she is not in love with the world
[1:00:34] the world's made love to her cannot just
[1:00:37] be real blunt today the world's made
[1:00:39] love to her but it never brought the
[1:00:42] satisfaction the soul was longing for it
[1:00:45] never brought the satisfaction that the
[1:00:47] soul was crying for but the world has
[1:00:50] definitely made love to us
[1:00:52] amen it's offered as all kinds of
[1:00:54] fineries it's offered as all kinds of
[1:00:56] opportunities but that will never
[1:00:59] satisfy the elect lady because she's
[1:01:02] really has only the ability you say but
[1:01:05] I was in the world I was loving the
[1:01:07] world no the scripture's not talking
[1:01:09] about what you thought was love it's
[1:01:11] talking about what God Said was love and
[1:01:14] when we were in the world the love of
[1:01:16] the world that was in us because
[1:01:19] otherwise the world would have brought
[1:01:20] the satisfaction that we were looking
[1:01:22] for
[1:01:24] but when we look and we search and the
[1:01:26] satisfaction is not there then our true
[1:01:29] love is not there amen Hallelujah
[1:01:32] because I'm telling you today many
[1:01:34] people have settled for all the world's
[1:01:36] got to offer
[1:01:38] hmm we won't go into that but I could
[1:01:41] just give you some very Stark bold
[1:01:43] examples uh the declares of people that
[1:01:46] just Embrace this
[1:01:48] and say oh I I belong here well my
[1:01:51] brother and sister if you belong there
[1:01:53] and that's the love of your life it
[1:01:54] should bring a satisfaction that calms
[1:01:56] your soul gives you peace and settles
[1:01:59] you
[1:02:00] but you don't see that do you
[1:02:03] we see a world
[1:02:05] and turmoil
[1:02:09] we see ministries of some of the largest
[1:02:12] churches in America
[1:02:15] racked
[1:02:17] by Scandal
[1:02:20] you know what that tells me
[1:02:22] they didn't believe
[1:02:24] what they preached
[1:02:26] they actually didn't believe in a
[1:02:28] keeping power
[1:02:30] they didn't believe in a ceiling power
[1:02:37] because they themselves were still
[1:02:39] searching
[1:02:43] we could really deviate but I don't
[1:02:45] think Sunday morning is a good time or
[1:02:46] place too go into that
[1:02:50] you see the word as I said is declared
[1:02:54] that she's not in love with the world
[1:02:57] and she herself
[1:03:01] reminds me of a time if you don't mind
[1:03:03] bringing someone an example
[1:03:06] foreign countries setting their
[1:03:08] counseling a husband and wife that were
[1:03:09] having some issues their Pastor setting
[1:03:11] off to the sign he had tried to help
[1:03:13] them they didn't really want to accept
[1:03:15] his advice
[1:03:17] and as we're talking and I asked them
[1:03:20] what what are the issues that you're
[1:03:22] facing and the man did all the talking
[1:03:24] he said well this is how my wife feels
[1:03:27] oh I know as husbands we've done that
[1:03:29] haven't we Brothers
[1:03:31] this is my wife's favorite food this is
[1:03:34] her favorite color this is
[1:03:39] I tell you what I finally learned
[1:03:41] I'm afraid to voice those things
[1:03:46] and he speaks and says this is this and
[1:03:49] this is a situation and this is why my
[1:03:51] wife has a problem with this and this
[1:03:53] and he just went on and on and on and on
[1:03:55] and on finally I said okay brother
[1:03:58] quiet
[1:04:01] sister
[1:04:02] answer the question
[1:04:09] he was quiet all right
[1:04:11] because she countedicted
[1:04:14] everything
[1:04:15] he said
[1:04:17] she was
[1:04:25] you realize
[1:04:28] that the near Kinsmen
[1:04:31] will put the title of husband to the
[1:04:33] near Kinsmen
[1:04:36] one that is closer than I
[1:04:38] scripture
[1:04:44] he wanted to redeem
[1:04:46] he wasn't willing to pay the price
[1:04:51] but he's still here today even saying
[1:04:54] this is what she likes this is what she
[1:04:57] wants to be this is how she wants to
[1:04:58] look this is what she wants to listen to
[1:05:02] but the bride this elect lady give her a
[1:05:06] voice my brother and sister and today
[1:05:08] she has a voice
[1:05:11] and she's here to declare I want Christ
[1:05:14] and Christ alone I want the word of God
[1:05:16] pure and unadulterated I don't need it
[1:05:19] filtered for me I don't need it
[1:05:21] explained as it were for me I want to
[1:05:24] just see it living and I want to see it
[1:05:25] living in the preacher I want to see it
[1:05:27] living in everyone around me but more so
[1:05:30] than that I want to see it living in me
[1:05:34] because that's what matters
[1:05:36] can I speak boldly today the preacher
[1:05:38] might go to hell amen every other person
[1:05:41] that has influence might go to hell you
[1:05:43] are not obligated to get on the bus with
[1:05:46] them you have a desire to the word go to
[1:05:49] the word
[1:05:51] amen I hope that's not too straight for
[1:05:54] you today
[1:05:55] amen right look
[1:05:58] the words boldly declares that she has
[1:06:01] amen the love of Christ it boldly
[1:06:05] declares and that and my brother and
[1:06:07] sister I'm trying to just skip ahead I
[1:06:09] just realize I have way more stuff than
[1:06:11] I think I do amen so it's there that
[1:06:14] that she is boldly declaring that she is
[1:06:18] filled with the love of Christ and the
[1:06:20] love of Christ has a manifestation right
[1:06:22] my brother and sister if there is
[1:06:24] something there that Satan can use to
[1:06:27] hinder you recognize that as Satan but
[1:06:30] this bride of Christ this elect lady has
[1:06:33] something down in her heart and as she
[1:06:36] reads the word she hears the word she
[1:06:38] prays over the word that has to come to
[1:06:41] life now my brother and sister if you
[1:06:43] want to be a Madonna then you start
[1:06:46] dressing like a Madonna and you listen
[1:06:48] to Madonna's music and you watch every
[1:06:51] action of Madonna but you'll sometimes
[1:06:54] grow up and realize you are not Madonna
[1:06:58] and never will be
[1:07:02] but you can go
[1:07:04] out of the fellowship out of the word of
[1:07:06] God for 5 10 15 20 years and wake up one
[1:07:11] morning and the desire to serve God is
[1:07:14] still there it's still alive it's still
[1:07:17] moving you it's still calling your name
[1:07:20] why because you always were a son or
[1:07:23] daughter of God it wasn't a fanciful
[1:07:26] moment it wasn't an opinion it wasn't an
[1:07:29] emotion but it was God Christ himself
[1:07:31] down inside
[1:07:34] Hallelujah I hope I'm not preaching too
[1:07:37] forceful today amen this one happens
[1:07:39] when you sit for too many hours and too
[1:07:41] much of time to think amen
[1:07:44] I tell you the love of Christ has a
[1:07:47] manifestation don't you believe that
[1:07:50] amen a man says he loves his wife and
[1:07:53] mistreat her in every form or fashion
[1:07:55] amen I will say his words speak louder
[1:07:57] amen his actions I mean speak louder
[1:08:00] than his words do
[1:08:02] so this comes my brother and sister I
[1:08:05] want to say today I'm just lift my hand
[1:08:07] as a witness before you and before God
[1:08:09] let my actions show My Love to You Lord
[1:08:12] let my actions show my love to you Grace
[1:08:15] Tabernacle let the word of God come in
[1:08:18] such a fashion that we can Overlook the
[1:08:20] humanity side we can Overlook the isms
[1:08:23] and schisms as it is and realize we're a
[1:08:26] part of the body of believers
[1:08:29] do you realize my brother and sister if
[1:08:31] we acted on every hurt that come to our
[1:08:33] life we would not have a single person
[1:08:35] we claimed as a family member we would
[1:08:37] not have a single person we ever claimed
[1:08:39] as family we would not have friends we
[1:08:41] would have nothing because Humanity
[1:08:43] fails but my God your God never fails
[1:08:47] amen so why are we looking to humanity
[1:08:50] and judging where we're going with our
[1:08:53] life when we know that that Humanity has
[1:08:56] failed let's look to Christ and follow
[1:08:58] the word and move right into that
[1:09:00] perfect place that we can then be
[1:09:02] identified with confidence I'm the elect
[1:09:05] lady
[1:09:06] I'm the reason God sent a message a real
[1:09:10] live moving of the Holy Ghost in This
[1:09:13] Day I'm the reason God did that if
[1:09:16] you're on the same bus that's wonderful
[1:09:18] but I know for a fact God sent it for me
[1:09:21] amen he opened the word for me because
[1:09:24] he knew I needed a redeemer I needed
[1:09:26] Clarity I needed Clear Vision I needed a
[1:09:30] change in my life
[1:09:32] oh I want to say it once again Lord let
[1:09:35] my actions amen show My Love to You Lord
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:41] Hallelujah
[1:09:43] you know I want to just share if I I can
[1:09:45] this morning if it'd be all right
[1:09:49] true story sister Jerry knows
[1:09:52] I might change some of the details
[1:09:54] odds are you'll never meet them
[1:09:58] but after just an incredible
[1:10:01] youth meeting
[1:10:04] in Chile
[1:10:06] there's a young man very gifted young
[1:10:08] man
[1:10:10] I'd
[1:10:12] kind of started a friendship I just
[1:10:14] really admired him as a young man and he
[1:10:17] asked me after Services brother Paul
[1:10:19] can I talk to you for a few minutes
[1:10:22] we just went over and sat down
[1:10:25] and he says
[1:10:27] now
[1:10:29] there's a young lady
[1:10:31] at first he was going to try and just
[1:10:32] camouflage it you know there's this
[1:10:34] young lady
[1:10:35] and he said oh forget it
[1:10:38] it's so and so and I said yeah I know
[1:10:41] who it is
[1:10:42] and he goes how do you know
[1:10:45] because it's obvious
[1:10:48] when you get around her you're all like
[1:10:59] well let me just turn a corner real
[1:11:00] quick
[1:11:03] when we come in the house of God
[1:11:08] it's just pretty obvious who's in love
[1:11:12] are you with me
[1:11:14] pretty obvious
[1:11:15] oh no we as humans we have a prescribed
[1:11:18] method if they're in love with the lord
[1:11:19] they're going to be the guy that's
[1:11:20] balancing on the corner of this Pew
[1:11:22] shouting Hallelujah and spinning around
[1:11:24] on his toe yeah he shows he's in love no
[1:11:28] sir there's something that radiates out
[1:11:31] from those
[1:11:33] Better In Love
[1:11:37] and he says brother Paul my own cousin
[1:11:40] knows how much I love this girl
[1:11:44] and my own cousin is competing for her
[1:11:51] well she's a pretty special girl
[1:11:54] she's a really wonderful girl
[1:11:57] don't look down on your cousin
[1:11:59] if he sees in her what you see in her
[1:12:02] amen and what even me as an old married
[1:12:05] man sees something special there why how
[1:12:08] can you look down on him
[1:12:10] he goes but he knows and I think he just
[1:12:12] does it to torment me I said well if
[1:12:15] you're not careful one of these days the
[1:12:17] torment will be look I'm engaged to your
[1:12:20] cousin
[1:12:21] he goes what do I do
[1:12:27] well they'll sit down I've got this
[1:12:29] couple big encyclopedias for you to read
[1:12:33] and the words in these encyclopedias are
[1:12:35] so big that you're going to need to get
[1:12:36] a dictionary and probably in 18 to 24
[1:12:40] months you'll finally get through all of
[1:12:42] this
[1:12:45] have you showed her
[1:12:49] well
[1:12:53] I guess not
[1:12:56] he goes how do I show her I'm in love
[1:12:58] with her brother Paul
[1:13:00] I said well
[1:13:02] don't go ask sister Jerry
[1:13:06] if I'm any good at my advice
[1:13:14] but when you see her coming to the door
[1:13:17] do the quick two-step around her
[1:13:21] and then just smile at her
[1:13:27] when you're at a church Fellowship
[1:13:30] and you're getting up to go get
[1:13:32] Pepsi
[1:13:34] and you see her glasses empty
[1:13:37] don't stop and say oh
[1:13:41] can I fill your glass
[1:13:45] just walk by
[1:13:46] smile and grab her glass
[1:13:49] and come back with it full
[1:13:52] smile
[1:13:53] and set it in front of her
[1:13:56] and when all the young people are going
[1:13:58] to go do something
[1:14:01] don't get all weird and awkward
[1:14:03] just say hey you girls come on get in my
[1:14:06] car
[1:14:07] and she'll be comfortable because
[1:14:09] there's safety in numbers
[1:14:12] versus
[1:14:13] I love you I adore you would you ride in
[1:14:16] my car
[1:14:18] can I just drool and smile at you at the
[1:14:20] same time
[1:14:26] I give him a much more eloquent speech
[1:14:28] than that
[1:14:30] I said and not one time
[1:14:33] do you ever take possession
[1:14:38] never voiced anyone this is my girl
[1:14:44] let's show her
[1:14:47] that you love her
[1:14:49] by your actions
[1:14:53] are you with me did we make it back to
[1:14:55] the starting point
[1:14:57] by
[1:14:58] our
[1:15:00] actions
[1:15:02] five and a half years go by he sends me
[1:15:05] a message oh brother Paul I did it
[1:15:11] and I'm like what did you do
[1:15:14] he goes I'm engaged
[1:15:17] she's gonna marry me
[1:15:19] I said wow that took longer than I
[1:15:21] thought
[1:15:22] he said oh you don't understand brother
[1:15:25] Paul
[1:15:26] we we were a couple
[1:15:29] and then we fought
[1:15:31] and then speak to each other for six
[1:15:33] months
[1:15:35] pardon me but I thought that was
[1:15:37] interesting brother Stephen
[1:15:39] sharing at Camp last year
[1:15:41] I took him and Sister Sarah so long to
[1:15:44] become engaged
[1:15:46] this young man he was like then we were
[1:15:49] an item again
[1:15:50] and then we didn't talk and I said so
[1:15:53] what was going on
[1:15:55] oh
[1:15:57] we had to grow up
[1:16:01] and the minute
[1:16:03] he came to maturity and she came to
[1:16:06] maturity
[1:16:08] recognized
[1:16:10] it's not about these little things that
[1:16:13] we make such an issue
[1:16:16] but it's about that deep enduring love
[1:16:20] and we show we care
[1:16:23] and I want to ask you
[1:16:25] if you have abided
[1:16:27] and you have stayed on the path
[1:16:29] can anyone here today say our lord Jesus
[1:16:32] has not showed us he cares could we lift
[1:16:36] a hand and testify he doesn't care about
[1:16:39] me
[1:16:40] no sir you know what's happened we've
[1:16:42] had to grow up
[1:16:45] and as we grow up spiritually we
[1:16:48] recognize God has been every step by
[1:16:51] step with us everywhere we go he's held
[1:16:54] the doors for us he's refilled us when
[1:16:57] we were empty he's fed us when we were
[1:16:59] hungry he's expressed in the sunrise and
[1:17:02] the sunset I love you but we had to grow
[1:17:06] up because you see God cannot take an
[1:17:09] immature bride he needs us to grow up
[1:17:11] now not after the Rapture we got to grow
[1:17:14] up here and now and show the maturity I
[1:17:18] believe your word I will stand with you
[1:17:21] I will love you I will take your name
[1:17:23] whether it's through the fire through
[1:17:26] the flood through the famine to the
[1:17:28] deserts I will do this
[1:17:31] and then we'll wake up one day and
[1:17:33] realize he has been every step of the
[1:17:37] way with us
[1:17:39] and I thought he left
[1:17:41] anyway they're happily married today
[1:17:44] amen
[1:17:46] I just can't help believe when you put
[1:17:47] two Fireballs in a room that something
[1:17:49] isn't going to catch on fire every once
[1:17:51] in a while
[1:17:52] Hallelujah so you know what if you're
[1:17:54] Fireball and he's a fireball and
[1:17:57] whatever
[1:17:59] don't think you made a mistake just
[1:18:00] because the napkins burst into flame at
[1:18:03] the table
[1:18:03] because you disagree about something
[1:18:07] just
[1:18:09] grow up Paul
[1:18:12] grow up
[1:18:15] because the more we come into maturity
[1:18:18] we move from affection
[1:18:22] to love
[1:18:24] and we've got to move to this place
[1:18:26] of love in the word
[1:18:29] amen that there's nothing
[1:18:31] you know the scripture says if we won't
[1:18:33] leave houses and lands
[1:18:36] and father mother sister and brother for
[1:18:39] the gospel
[1:18:40] we're not even Worthy
[1:18:43] what
[1:18:46] no not father mother sister brother let
[1:18:49] me add a little bit husband wife
[1:18:55] see God 's not wanting you to have an
[1:18:57] affection to him
[1:18:59] he's wanting you to be
[1:19:01] deeply
[1:19:03] intrinsically in love with him
[1:19:06] that there's nothing else on this Earth
[1:19:09] has the value
[1:19:10] your place in Christ
[1:19:13] amen
[1:19:15] I'm not I'm not digging too deep in your
[1:19:17] lives are you
[1:19:18] I don't say this jokingly but my brother
[1:19:21] and sister I'd rather have the scrape
[1:19:23] and need the Band-Aid than never be
[1:19:25] touched by the word at all
[1:19:28] hmm
[1:19:30] okay now in first John 2 and 24 we're
[1:19:33] going to just go through that really
[1:19:35] really quick because I didn't realize as
[1:19:38] I unzipped the file
[1:19:39] that there was so much there
[1:19:42] 2 and 24 amen let that therefore abide
[1:19:46] in you which ye have heard from the
[1:19:48] beginning so what we heard in the
[1:19:49] beginning we ought to stick with Amen in
[1:19:51] that which you have heard from the
[1:19:53] beginning shall remain in you you also
[1:19:55] continue in the son and in the father
[1:19:57] this is the promise that he has promised
[1:19:59] us even
[1:20:01] eternal life
[1:20:02] now my brother and sister it really
[1:20:04] comes down to the fact that when the man
[1:20:06] says now I'm going to put this in a
[1:20:08] humorous context so you'd understand
[1:20:10] when the man says that I will this and
[1:20:13] that and whatever in the natural trying
[1:20:15] to win the girl amen he wants to win the
[1:20:17] girl married Brothers we wanted to win
[1:20:20] the girl did we not amen we didn't like
[1:20:23] yeah there's others if she doesn't no
[1:20:25] sir we want to win the girl
[1:20:27] now sometimes we'll promise a lot I told
[1:20:29] sister Jerry when we were courting that
[1:20:31] I'd buy her a Mercedes with a sunroof
[1:20:36] and I did one day
[1:20:38] only it looked like a truck
[1:20:40] it wasn't her idea she was looking at a
[1:20:43] 450 SL convertible
[1:20:46] and she's like yeah praise God he's
[1:20:49] gonna buy me a Mercedes someday I bought
[1:20:51] her a 5-ton Mercedes diesel truck that
[1:20:54] just happened to have a sunroof and I
[1:20:56] fulfilled every promise I ever made to
[1:20:58] her in our courtship
[1:21:00] now that's not fair is it that's
[1:21:02] misleading but we cannot hear today and
[1:21:05] say what God has promised to you and I
[1:21:08] that he ever misled us in one single
[1:21:12] thing
[1:21:13] someone say Amen God's never misled us
[1:21:17] amen so it's there that he has promised
[1:21:20] eternal life and I stand here today
[1:21:22] banking my whole life everything that I
[1:21:25] am amen look Saints I don't do this for
[1:21:28] exercise
[1:21:29] I don't do this for fun I don't get up
[1:21:31] here and preach because I just feel some
[1:21:33] compelling urge to stand up and talk to
[1:21:35] you I stand here because I believe this
[1:21:38] with all of my life everything that is
[1:21:40] in the fiber of my being I believe this
[1:21:43] and something inside of me says speak
[1:21:46] Paul and I have to share this my brother
[1:21:48] and sister he gave me eternal life and I
[1:21:51] believe it amen these are the things
[1:21:54] concerning them that seduce you but the
[1:21:56] anointing which you have received of him
[1:21:58] abideth in you amen so that anointing
[1:22:00] from The Seducer my brother and sister
[1:22:02] cannot displace this call of God in your
[1:22:05] life you need not that any man teach you
[1:22:07] this is the Holy Ghost but as the same
[1:22:09] anointing teaches you of all things and
[1:22:12] is true this is why I made this
[1:22:14] statement I said earlier that we need to
[1:22:17] listen to the Holy Ghost amen we need to
[1:22:19] quit I don't want you to listen to me I
[1:22:22] want you to go back to the word and let
[1:22:24] God speak to you it's not what the
[1:22:26] preacher said brother Paul said brother
[1:22:28] Paul said why what does the word say to
[1:22:31] you you've got to get in the word let
[1:22:34] the word speak to you well I'm of this
[1:22:36] Camp I'm of this camp this is my pastor
[1:22:39] this is my pastor no we need to go this
[1:22:43] is my God and this is his word and this
[1:22:47] is his holy spirit speak to me Lord
[1:22:51] amen
[1:22:53] amen and I'm going to just hurry uh
[1:22:56] quickly along here
[1:22:58] why is God doing this
[1:23:01] why is God doing this
[1:23:03] to make you mark off and check off the
[1:23:05] things I was a good person here I was a
[1:23:06] good person no God's actually wanting to
[1:23:08] build confidence in you
[1:23:10] God wants to put confidence in you to
[1:23:13] the place that when he says I'd like you
[1:23:15] to stop right here that you can stop and
[1:23:18] have a confidence this is where God
[1:23:20] wants me to be in the most improbable of
[1:23:22] times if he says go forward and we have
[1:23:26] that kind of confidence in we'll go
[1:23:28] forward my brother and sister God's not
[1:23:30] doing it for some checklist of obedient
[1:23:33] disobedient good or bad he wants to
[1:23:36] build confidence in you in the word of
[1:23:39] God Amen because in the day that we're
[1:23:42] coming it says it would be so closer to
[1:23:44] see the very elective possible now we
[1:23:46] know brother Branham said that you can't
[1:23:48] be deceived that the word's in you amen
[1:23:51] but I want you to understand this that
[1:23:53] we in the human element we are humans
[1:23:55] here
[1:23:56] is there any AI present
[1:23:59] we're humans
[1:24:01] do any of you ever come to a confidence
[1:24:04] issue
[1:24:07] come on let's let's be honest
[1:24:11] I'm 61 years old
[1:24:14] I used to have no problem climbing on
[1:24:16] three four five story building roofs and
[1:24:19] hanging over the edge pounding nails and
[1:24:20] doing whatever I now have confidence
[1:24:23] issues step ladders are pretty tall
[1:24:26] Life Changes
[1:24:28] and where we used to say I'm a confident
[1:24:31] Christian I'm confident in my
[1:24:32] relationship and then we have things
[1:24:35] happen and our confidence goes away and
[1:24:37] God says you know what I need you to
[1:24:40] have confidence in my word I need you to
[1:24:42] have confidence in me and so what is he
[1:24:45] doing he then calls on us I won't read
[1:24:47] the scripture but he says I need you to
[1:24:50] make your calling an election sure what
[1:24:53] is it not a question mark am I saved am
[1:24:56] I not saved do I have the Holy Ghost I
[1:24:58] don't have the Holy Ghost it's not that
[1:25:00] kind of question my brother and sister
[1:25:02] God wants you to go back and he wants
[1:25:05] you to go in the word and he wants you
[1:25:07] to be able to say I have followed the
[1:25:09] word I believe the word the word is
[1:25:12] alive to me it's so real let me put it
[1:25:14] in a simple analogy
[1:25:16] have any of you ever flown
[1:25:19] most every one of you at some point in
[1:25:21] time amen even those of you that didn't
[1:25:25] raise a hand
[1:25:26] didn't get here
[1:25:28] by boat
[1:25:33] okay no I want to ask you again did any
[1:25:35] of you ever fly
[1:25:37] come on you got more muscles come on
[1:25:39] Sister Miriam I'm going to call you out
[1:25:41] I'm gonna call you out you didn't make
[1:25:44] it here by boat plane or train
[1:25:47] hey man hey man I'm just looking for a
[1:25:50] little bit of muscle reaction to say
[1:25:51] I've ever flown now look okay I'm sorry
[1:25:53] sister Miriam I apologize I just
[1:25:56] couldn't help myself
[1:25:59] but look at this now
[1:26:00] you're going to get on the plane
[1:26:03] I want to just just interact with me
[1:26:05] okay
[1:26:06] let's not take ourselves too serious
[1:26:08] today
[1:26:09] I'll tell you what happens to Paul
[1:26:12] boarding flight 1524
[1:26:15] to Seattle
[1:26:18] zone two
[1:26:20] come on baby let's go
[1:26:22] on the way up there the kiosk is there
[1:26:28] gate 24 yep
[1:26:32] seat 19.
[1:26:39] this is
[1:26:42] you know what that comes from
[1:26:44] the time that Paul
[1:26:46] being so Gallant
[1:26:48] and chivalrous
[1:26:50] said here honey I'll take care of the
[1:26:52] tickets
[1:26:55] here's your ticket
[1:26:57] sister Jerry gets up there to the little
[1:26:59] thing
[1:27:00] hey lady just to you
[1:27:03] man
[1:27:10] well he's like let me see it
[1:27:13] uh ma'am this was your last flight
[1:27:24] do you have a ticket oh
[1:27:26] oh here it is
[1:27:30] I know it's a poor analogy but you see
[1:27:32] what God's wanting us to do
[1:27:37] pull the word out
[1:27:39] I am redeemed
[1:27:41] I've been washed in the blood
[1:27:44] I've got the Holy Ghost and I'm in love
[1:27:47] with him
[1:27:49] make your calling an election sure
[1:27:52] the ticket worked on one flight my
[1:27:54] brother and sister but it's not going to
[1:27:56] work on any other God has got a calling
[1:27:59] for you and I for today don't go back
[1:28:02] and say I was on fire for God five years
[1:28:04] ago that's not going to worry I'll be on
[1:28:06] fire for God five years from now make
[1:28:09] your calling an election sure today my
[1:28:12] brother and sister all we got to do is
[1:28:14] stop and we have the ticket it's called
[1:28:17] the word of God and look at that and say
[1:28:19] Lord I'm not here just to do a check off
[1:28:22] but I'm here because I am in love with
[1:28:25] you and I want to be in a marriage
[1:28:27] supper of a lamb I want to stand before
[1:28:30] your throne I want to dwell in your
[1:28:32] presence Lord and I'm willing to put the
[1:28:34] effort today to look back at my life and
[1:28:38] look back at my circumstance and make my
[1:28:40] calling and election sure
[1:28:42] amen hallelujah just remember me the
[1:28:45] next time you go again on a plane and
[1:28:47] tell me if it ain't true that you don't
[1:28:49] look at that ticket more than once
[1:28:50] before you get up there
[1:28:52] because if not you're Supreme I'd also
[1:28:55] have done the same thing with it on the
[1:28:56] phone you know me Mr technology
[1:29:00] Ben you know Jerry how do you find this
[1:29:03] thing Jerry yeah
[1:29:05] right here here you go Paul

[1:29:25] cherries
[1:29:27] down
[1:29:28] the walkway ah

[1:29:49] there you go
[1:29:51] don't lose your phone
[1:29:53] I'll say yes Mom
[1:29:56] now look my brother and sister
[1:29:58] sorry for my poor analogies but it don't
[1:30:00] matter how modern we are and how the
[1:30:04] church today looks at the word of God
[1:30:07] God is still wanting you to make your
[1:30:11] calling an election sure we can't count
[1:30:14] on this man's Revelation and on that
[1:30:17] man's Revelation that God wants to speak
[1:30:19] to you and I in person that we can
[1:30:22] literally get up in the morning of the
[1:30:25] worst day of your life and say I Am
[1:30:27] Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I am a
[1:30:30] Son of God I am a daughter of God I can
[1:30:33] do this I am getting myself ready now
[1:30:37] forgive me for my silly analogies I need
[1:30:40] to move forward here time is so fleeting
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:45] you see we're not here to just have a
[1:30:47] conversation about righteousness we are
[1:30:49] here to be righteousness
[1:30:51] Amen Let the word become more than just
[1:30:56] words
[1:30:57] let it become an action now Jesus Christ
[1:31:01] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:31:04] I like this you see
[1:31:06] you know brother Brown told us at one
[1:31:08] point in time
[1:31:09] that um
[1:31:12] we should identify ourselves in the word
[1:31:14] of God now I didn't really say identify
[1:31:16] yourself in a quote
[1:31:17] he said identify yourself in the word of
[1:31:19] God
[1:31:20] but you know if y'all don't mind for
[1:31:22] just a moment I'm just going to take
[1:31:24] this point if you'll give me liberty
[1:31:27] I like it when I can find myself even in
[1:31:29] the message of the hour
[1:31:30] and God's word is a seed
[1:31:33] and you Farmers here hello
[1:31:37] any of the rest of you able to take that
[1:31:39] position
[1:31:42] sorry about that
[1:31:44] and you Farmers here you know if you put
[1:31:46] a seed in the ground and take care of it
[1:31:48] right if it's in the right kind of
[1:31:50] ground it'll produce what the seed is
[1:31:52] God's word is a seed and if you put it
[1:31:54] in the right kind kind of of ground of
[1:31:57] faith and treat it right it'll produce
[1:31:59] just what it is if it's for healing
[1:32:01] it'll produce healing salvation
[1:32:03] Salvation joy joy and every promise in
[1:32:07] the Bible is true and just remember you
[1:32:10] can take me to record for this that the
[1:32:12] right mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:32:14] promise of God will bring it to pass if
[1:32:17] you can take the right attitude toward
[1:32:19] that promise now I've had people tell me
[1:32:21] oh that's just psychology well I'm
[1:32:23] telling you my brother and sister when
[1:32:25] you get in positions of life and you
[1:32:28] understand that there are things that
[1:32:31] are much greater to you and things you
[1:32:33] don't understand there's times you just
[1:32:36] have to believe
[1:32:39] I did a little math this morning just on
[1:32:41] that line and I've already forgotten the
[1:32:43] numbers but I'll just tell you in the
[1:32:45] last few weeks I have put millions and
[1:32:48] millions of seeds in the ground has cost
[1:32:51] me uh well up in the in the tens of
[1:32:55] thousands multiple tens of thousands of
[1:32:58] dollars for that seed
[1:33:00] now do you think that I just blindly go
[1:33:02] out there and spend tens and tens of
[1:33:04] thousands of dollars hoping that seed
[1:33:07] will come up
[1:33:08] no sir Saints I have done everything
[1:33:11] within my power to create the right
[1:33:15] atmosphere to place that seed I use the
[1:33:19] finest quality of Planters I use Aquinas
[1:33:22] quality of fertilizer I have worked the
[1:33:24] ground not too fine and not too coarse
[1:33:27] and I've done all of this so that I can
[1:33:30] plant the seed and there I can set and
[1:33:33] say well praise God praise God I know
[1:33:36] that the seed will work amen why
[1:33:40] well I don't know I've never planted a
[1:33:41] seed before and I'm just hoping
[1:33:44] no no
[1:33:46] no no I know the seed that I'm planting
[1:33:49] I know what I have done I've perfected
[1:33:52] it over 30 years
[1:33:54] by God's grace
[1:33:58] I hope you guys don't think I'm crazy to
[1:34:00] try and tie this into a spiritual
[1:34:02] context
[1:34:04] but in the natural part of life
[1:34:08] there's few things that still create the
[1:34:11] thrill
[1:34:12] as driving by
[1:34:15] and seeing all
[1:34:17] these beautiful little green lines
[1:34:20] going and disappearing up over the hill
[1:34:25] now if I come tomorrow and there's no
[1:34:27] more green in the field
[1:34:28] I don't just say oh
[1:34:30] it'll get better
[1:34:33] I would have to find out why
[1:34:35] it changed because you know what my
[1:34:37] expectation is
[1:34:40] it was this big today
[1:34:43] called the spike
[1:34:45] it's that big tomorrow
[1:34:48] and it's that big the day after
[1:34:50] and it's not big the day after
[1:34:53] and it's that big that after
[1:34:56] am I boring you
[1:34:59] you know why
[1:35:01] because
[1:35:03] we checked the calling
[1:35:09] put the seed in the ground
[1:35:11] this is what it is it's going to be a
[1:35:13] corn field
[1:35:15] is there life in the seed
[1:35:18] the test on the label
[1:35:20] says that
[1:35:21] 98.7 percent of those seeds have a life
[1:35:25] in them
[1:35:29] I had certainty when I planted that
[1:35:31] field
[1:35:32] just so you all know the conclusion of
[1:35:34] that it's about that tall now
[1:35:37] because the life is in the seed
[1:35:43] I don't care what the man out here says
[1:35:46] I don't care what the man out there says
[1:35:48] what I know is my God said I put a seed
[1:35:52] in you and it's a seed Gene of myself it
[1:35:56] is me myself and you it's not a sea Gene
[1:35:59] of a message church here and of a
[1:36:01] Methodist Church here and a Nazarene
[1:36:03] Church there and of this over here it
[1:36:06] was God that said I put the sea Gene in
[1:36:08] you and it will grow and produce exactly
[1:36:12] what I called it to
[1:36:14] oh now it's my responsibility I I I'm
[1:36:17] closing
[1:36:19] amen sister vika help me close
[1:36:21] amen now look my brother and sister this
[1:36:24] corn is beautiful it's growing so
[1:36:26] quickly I I'm just so impressed amen I'm
[1:36:29] so happy but you see I if I don't water
[1:36:32] it
[1:36:33] I'm not gonna have a crop
[1:36:36] if I don't fertilize it it's not going
[1:36:38] to grow to its full potential
[1:36:41] amen let's wash the seed that God gave
[1:36:44] us amen we get the idea that the washing
[1:36:46] of the water of the word is just simply
[1:36:48] scrubbing away or mistakes no my brother
[1:36:50] and sister whenever we come in the
[1:36:53] presence of almighty God that water of
[1:36:55] the word soaks down into our souls and
[1:36:58] we start to realize yes I need to change
[1:37:01] some things in my life but I'll tell you
[1:37:03] God loves me and I'm here to serve him
[1:37:05] he's an awesome God he's a faithful God
[1:37:07] I believe him when he said I gave you
[1:37:10] eternal life and we live like we have
[1:37:13] eternal life
[1:37:15] there's a difference going to church
[1:37:18] and living
[1:37:20] like you have eternal life
[1:37:22] I don't want you to be church goers this
[1:37:24] morning I want you to be the livers
[1:37:28] the life
[1:37:30] eternal
[1:37:31] being manifested
[1:37:33] from God's word
[1:37:35] Hallelujah
[1:37:37] oh my
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:40] my oh my
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:45] we'll just call it good right there
[1:37:46] let's just stand
[1:37:48] amen you know sometimes we as preachers
[1:37:51] we preach the same thought from 42
[1:37:54] different directions and then we'll tell
[1:37:56] you well I didn't finish my sermon
[1:37:58] it's because I didn't give you version
[1:38:00] 43.
[1:38:02] or four or five
[1:38:03] but God's good
[1:38:05] God's good
[1:38:07] amen
[1:38:09] let's be faithful take his name
[1:38:11] live
[1:38:13] let's not be affectionate
[1:38:16] to be in love
[1:38:18] amen
[1:38:19] Hallelujah
[1:38:21] you know if any of you ever wonder
[1:38:25] some of the best counsel

[1:38:32] a Bible in the middle of the table sit
[1:38:34] on each side
[1:38:36] hold hands and hold the Bible and then
[1:38:39] just fight to your heart's content
[1:38:42] because if you're a real Christian
[1:38:44] you can't fight while you're hanging on
[1:38:46] to the Bible
[1:38:48] because the word has that much power in
[1:38:52] the life of a Believer
[1:38:54] when the devil's there trying to
[1:38:56] convince you
[1:38:58] that you're not

[1:39:21] devil
[1:39:23] you ever realize the devil's not going
[1:39:25] to do that
[1:39:26] the word of God he knows he's defeated
[1:39:30] by the word every single time
[1:39:35] if you haven't been in the word Saints
[1:39:37] you haven't been handling your Bible you
[1:39:39] haven't been sitting at the table as it
[1:39:41] were with your Bible please start you

[1:40:04] need to do is not walk out of this
[1:40:06] building till you'll take a moment it'll
[1:40:07] take forever but you need to close your
[1:40:10] eyes and say Lord break the spirit of
[1:40:13] defeat that is on me that I can have
[1:40:15] Victory because I am a daughter of God I
[1:40:19] am a Son of God and I refuse to accept
