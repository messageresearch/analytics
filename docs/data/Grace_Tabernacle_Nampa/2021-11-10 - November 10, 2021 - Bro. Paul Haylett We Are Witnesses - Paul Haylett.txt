over things they've been studying so let's be in prayer for them and that they have a wonderful time as we get ready to turn the service to brother paul let's say number 878. justified glad you've been justified tonight amen let's sing this i was sitting alone and wondering about what i'm supposed to do i can't deny the times i made mistakes can't hide from happy news but i know that deep within my soul i feel sorry honest i do so i just cried and said forgive me lord forgive me lord will you oh [Music] i [Music] in the first place he looked from eternity to justify you have not done it in the first place have not done it in the first place to justify [Music] in the first place [Music] justify look at you where you are now if you look in the first place [Music] justify i've not done it in the first place justify can somebody say amen this evening hallelujah hallelujah amen the devil spends so much time and effort saying look look look but he's looking at the wrong picture hallelujah aren't you glad tonight amen we want to just bring greetings tonight you know i say this with a bit of humor i i probably shouldn't but i would like to introduce you to sister hannah's husband i've had that done to me many times brother flint and i just couldn't resist amen brother flint um just um you know my brother-in-law a lot of years and faithful got a little assembly there and uh i guess we'd call it anchorage and and they're just been pressing on for years and years and god has got his blessing then we've just had some lovely fellowship uh and uh here hunting with brother chris course a little disappointed maybe they didn't find an animal uh in the woods but i think the fellowship no doubt that they had his father and son would have outweighed any animal and uh so just lovely uh to have them here amen and uh so just there was one other thought upon my mind amen oh my brother jason where did it go amen okay well we just move forward god bless you see each one of you tonight and i just pray the lord's special blessings upon you and uh so uh let's just stand and go into my right on the edge of my mind as this other thought and i just can't grasp the holds of it amen yeah if we should write it down when we when we get that age we should write it down you know i i i just speak this i know brother david brother chris will recognize this brother flint sometimes you'll be studying and there'll be a little something come upon you and you'll think oh that would make a lovely sermon and you know if you don't stop that very second and write that down five minutes later you cannot bring that to your remembrance for nothing and uh so i don't think that's an age thing i see brother chris back there shaking his head yes yes but uh you know sometimes those inspirations just come and you know we have to grab aholts of those and god bless you sister sophie sister grace tonight good to see you amen isn't grace just the cutest girl you ever met amen i tell you i've had the privilege to know her since she was just a little little grace and she's now a big grace amen let's turn our bibles this evening i want to speak to you on the thought we'll take it from this scripture we are witness it and it's an interesting way because certainly tonight saints we stand here as witnesses of the gospel of jesus christ but we're going to look at this tonight in just a slightly different fashion to see how it is in the book of joshua as joshua is dealing with the people now remember these are the people that have left egypt under a prophetic promise and all they had to do was remain with the prophetic promise they didn't need a new revelation they didn't need a new avenue to approach it they needed to just remain under that prophetic promise and that prophetic promise was is i'll lead you from a land and i'll take you into a promised land and and uh so we'll just look at this and and take this from joshua the 24th chapter and we'll start with the 13th verse this evening amen so as we look at this i want you just to to just maybe take a second to glance in your bibles uh before this so that you can just kind of catch the context of what is taking place and and uh certainly by god's grace we can express that tonight joshua 24 13 and i have given you a land for which you did not labor and cities which you built not and you dwell in them of the vineyards and olive yards which he planted not do you eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth now remember what the prophet of god said he said in this day under that religious spirit these people would be even more sincere than the very bride of christ they would have this great degree of sincerity of devotion they'll feed the poor they'll clothe the poor they'll travel the earth to tell people about jesus christ but the ingredient they're missing is truth and if we have truth but no sincerity we're really in the same boat serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve you the lord and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me oh i hope somebody can say amen tonight but as for me and my house we will serve the lord and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord and serve other gods for the lord our god you know that's what we need to do make a very positive confession of identity of what it is the lord our god he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went among all the people through whom we passed my i'll just try and contain myself here and the lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god and joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the lord now if we stop there that would be almost taking all faith and hope away from us for he's a holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if see isn't this beautiful how there is this connection in the scripture in the word if you forsake the lord so everything that we would come and say well i i would i would be this i would be that i identify here i identify there joshua spoke pretty strongly didn't he you won't be able to serve him you won't be able to do it if you don't seek sigh and cry for the truth if you don't do all that's within you to possess the truth not forgive your transgressions nor your sins you forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you good and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord and joshua said unto the people here's where we've got our title tonight joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord to serve him and they said we are witnesses now therefore put away said he strange gods which are among you and incline your heart and to the lord god of israel and the people said unto joshua the lord our god will we serve and his voice will we obey heavenly father we're asking for your guiding hand tonight father as we just come in these things you've laid upon our heart father may we just bring it in such a way lord that you can anoint it to our hearts and souls lord we love you adore you thank you for your grace and mercy tonight amen you may be seated saints so as we would look at the word of god tonight i want to go back as i said uh where we have taken our title go back to verse 21 and then people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord so we're denying every other position that we could take and we are going to stand in a position that we are testifying and joshua says to them and i i love this my brother and sister because we know that in any time of that there is judgment god will always have a witness upon the earth uh and to satisfy as it were the judgment and so while there is a people that will be judged for all manner of unbelief and and what we would describe as sin there will be those witnesses that god has raised up who have been able by the grace of god amen can somebody say by the grace of god that we will stand in this hour as a witness of the saving delivering power of almighty god we will not my brother and sister stand that day and say well you know i really didn't do it but i guess it's just god's favor that's put me here god's favor is what makes the way for us to live this life and so by the grace of god we press into the word for the day and we are able to stand upon that word and joshua tells him ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen the lord to serve him and the people's acknowledgement or their testimony is we are witnesses and you know it's there in that powerful position my brother and sister it is that uh uh it would seem as though it would be an oddity for someone to witness against themselves but just let me step into what may be construed as a little negative position in the world we live in today people are using the lord's name in vain they are using his name associated with words as damnation etc you know the phrases that they use and so it's there in this people do not realize what they're actually testifying of they are testifying of a judgment against god or a lack of confidence in god a lack of even acknowledgement of his existence or his deity and so in all of that they're actually testifying of their own position but let's step over into the religious world and see in the world we live in today and you know i'm very fond of the phrase chino christian in name only that these people also by taking the word let's forget about all these other religions let's bring it back down home here then we testify of the power of god within the word in our day a prophetic word in our day we testify of that but then we turn around by our very actions and deny it so it's there one to take it in healing we claim that god is a healer but yet we ourselves do not take the final step to possess our healing by having an unwavering faith in the healing power or virtue my brother and sister mark 16 was not put there just to fill up space it is the word for our day amen so the prophet of god tells us over and over again that if you believe this regardless of your symptom you don't go out and say well i am healed and then the first people you meet well i'm so miserable i'm this i'm that what you have to do is by a changing now i'm not talking about just some carnal willpower thing to change it but there is a degree of that that is involved we have to make a decision that i'm going to change my language i'm going to change my presentation because i'm actually testifying either for or against myself i'm a believer then let's testify as believers but if we say we're a believer and we testify as though we are unbelievers then our testimony will then be held against us so as joshua is talking to the people and they are there declaring that we are going to serve god he tells them you are witnesses against yourself in other words joshua was saying on that day in that time in these circumstances i will not have to stand up and say this is what you've done but their very words their own words their own actions will then come as their testimony for or against them oh god help us god help us that we would be testifying that we are believers in this hour and our life and our very words back up that we are believers amen not a contradictory well are they believers or not they might be believer today but had a rough day so they're not a believer no my brother and sister good days bad days no matter what is happening uh on the mountain in the valley i'm a believer and i ask lord help me that my life will testify i'm a believer amen so you look at this now let's look at egypt and israel and all of those things for just a moment you realize my brother and sister that it was prophecy that put israel in egypt but yet it wasn't totally my brother and sister uh uh the prophecy that did it because the prophecy was actually prophesying of israel's actions so was actually israel's action that put them in egypt but the prophecy declared this is why you're going to behave this is what you're going to do this is how you're going to approach god this is how you're going to forsake god and this is what i'm going to do once you have done that now that should be enough my brother and sister for a people to look at a prophecy and say if that is the spirit of the day lord let's oh help us lord have a revival that we're not going to forsake you we're not going to go against your word because we don't want to go to egypt but you see the anointing of the age is strong it is so powerful my brother and sister that that people this is why as we've been speaking to you in these last few services that we have to stay under the blood of jesus christ because that is the only neutralizing agent that there is to the power of the age that we're living in satan's eden has a very strong spirit but we have what it takes to neutralize that and now in warfare my brother and sister whether you're talking spiritual unnatural if you possess that to neutralize the strength of the enemy do you not apply that if you can limit the enemy's ability to move forward to possess the land then you would take and apply that but look at the spirit so strong upon israel at that time that that they themselves were the one actually neutralized and so the prophecy of them going for 400 years into a land into slavery they could no more stop that than nothing but you see it was also prophecy that delivered them out of that land and so is there that prophecy after 400 years i'll deliver you into a land i will take you into a profit into a promised land and so it did not put them god didn't put them there as a random thought into egypt my brother and sister he put them in egypt one to show his people that there is consequences i'll tell you what what we need to do i don't want our young people to ever be afraid of the lord but i want our young people to realize as some of us older people can well testify there are consequences to our decisions we can't just be scotch-free and just you know hop skip and a jump and just walk away from it that's why from an age as little as we can communicate and lay this down into the heart of our children we need to lay this foundation that serving god is not just about do's and don'ts but it is the greatest blessings that can ever be poured out on mankind it is the greatest strength that can be placed into a young man's life the greatest virtue placed into a young woman's life is serving god for the world is here to take away and god is here to fill up amen to raise up amen as i heard a brother preach one time he said it's just real simple young people it is the devil is death and jesus christ is life but you see the devil look how he's dressed up death death looks so beautiful you see these guys doing all these things they jump out of planes with nothing hardly more than a sheet to fly like a bird some live some die they memorialize and make a hero out of the ones that die but what they don't realize is satan's just tempting them with death and then on the simple side of this if i would view it simply god says you know what all i'm asking of you is for your love and devotion and obedience but it's not obedience by law right it's obedience because it's been written on our hearts and our heart desires to serve god and and the devil so has put that down as though some guy who is devoted to jesus christ is somehow a weak vessel he's not worthy of our attention this over here is what is we glorify my the devil's quite a marketing agent isn't he so this prophecy is testifying actually of their actions and so as i said the lord didn't put him in egypt on a random thought but he put him there actually on their failure to obey the word of god and as we've been preaching on obedience the two sides of obedience you see my brother and sister oftentimes the disobedience uh to the word is because man chose to be obedient to man it's very simple when we have the option church and you know this is something very deep in my heart because i preach it to you a lot we have the option to take and go back to the word or simply to take some man's word for it how hard is it for us to take it back to the word we have at our fingertips today the message on phones and ipads and computers almost anywhere on the earth we can go and check it to the word but satan anoints that such a fashion now look that's what got israel in trouble they took them as we were talking about mike and his hireling priest they they took the word of someone else that they were sure he must be right and they didn't bother to go and check it again isn't this kind of scary amen but we see that it was a failure to obey the word of for their day that that set them but yet my brother and sister it was prophecy that set the stage for their deliverance so the very word this sentiment to egypt is the same word that sent them out again and so it was there in that while they are in egypt imagine now god knows what he's doing my brother and sister and he works on you and i in the same fashion and i trust tonight you can connect the dots that they are in egypt and as it was it wasn't such a bad life when they were there and everything was ample and in good supply but then pharaoh started turning up the heat they started having four dollar gas i hope you just follow me grocery bills went through the roof and they said you know what for us corporations to exist we're gonna have to lower your wages is there any parallels that you're seeing and the pressure started to build on the people and it was at a time when there was plenteous that they didn't really think about how they had transgressed the word of god because yeah we're in egypt but look at this we live in a nice house it might be a company house it doesn't matter it's a nice house we have plenty of food we're wearing the best clothes we've ever wore in our life and it's there but god just starts turning the heat up now we can look at it and say oh that rotten old pharaoh he's doing this to god's people he's punishing god's people but you realize my brother and sister this was an avenue as the clock went tick tick tick this was an avid bring the people to a place that not god himself i hope you catch this not god himself saying okay ding it's time for deliverance but it was coming to a place at the ticking of the clock that the people coming into a state of desperation and they started saying oh god deliver us oh god was there not prophecy is there not a word in our hour that has declared that there is deliverance in the house of god and the people started pressing into that and when moses is there now god speaks to him and says i have heard the cry of my people god knew all the time that this certain pressure this certain thing affect you and affect you and affect you a little different all of us a little different in our situation but god knew that that pressure would bring us to a place we would start crying out and i tell you tonight's saints i believe god is trying to bring us to a place right now that the greatest cry that we have in our life is a cry to him it is not a cry as it were to the conditions of the world it's not a cry to this injustice and that injustice but god bringing a bride to a place that our first and only thought is to cry out to him amen but you see my brother and sister the spirit of the prophecy was moving in the people because god cannot speak a word and it not come to pass so he spoke the word and then he brings around this circumstance the people do not i believe i don't think there's anything to support the idea that the people are saying okay we're going to go through this for a little season then god will deliver us they had no more idea than we do but it didn't matter to them because every day was bringing them to a place that their heart was crying out lord lord deliver us deliver us from the wickedness deliver us from evil man's intent deliver us from this that is around us the oppressive spirit of the age deliver us lord now you can take this down through history and type it you can type it right to the day here we don't have time tonight but my brother and sister you'll find that the devil will always manipulate things to cause you to have to do more with less but that's never been the case in the life of a christian god has always said i will supply your every need so we say well we're not doing so well i know i'm probably the worst among you for liking things boats trains planes aren't they fun we should own one or let's own them all but you see god said nowhere in scripture i'll supply what you want he said i'll supply what you need but here's favor under the spirit of oppression i want more out of you for less and so there he starts to wear upon the people but god's using that to bring a deliverance to the people now look at this in uh the word here my brother and sister uh let's just move along here as we would brothers uh let's go to that next slide uh in uh hearing receiving and acting and that a wonderful title you know how many sermons there's got to be at least 10 000 sermons right there in just that title alone amen but brother brown says now moses why certainly he didn't go out to some school or stand before some psychologist to find out if he was able to go down to egypt he had saw that pillar of fire wound up in the top of a bush and when he seen that he thought you know what if that attract his attention so we begin to hear a voice coming out of there saying i've heard the cries of my people and i've remembered my covenant and i've come down to deliver them first thing he did he heard he recognized it was god because it was the word now my brother and sister it didn't matter that most of israel had forgotten the promise that had been given most of them were generations removed from this and so there they had come you might say a acclimatized to the world that they were living in and that's what satan's actually trying to do to you and i get acclimatized that we hear curse words when we see nudity and we see all these vulgarities that we just kind of like yeah yeah yeah but help us lord not to be climatized to this help us lord that it be just as offensive in the next 10 years if the lord has not come as it was 10 years ago or whatever that we never allow ourselves to be desensitized to these things but so satan's just always doing this and and god's heard the cries and god says you know what i know the covenant i know my prophecy i know what i said to them and and now i've come down to deliver him so here it is that moses the thing that's so beautiful in another place and i'm sorry i can't quote the message to you brother branham says there that you know all moses had to have done was just waited a few more years and he would have been the pharaoh and then he could have just wrote a decree and said i'm setting them free but that wasn't god's prophecy he said i'll bring them out of the land with a mighty hand amen not a bick but a mighty hand don't we serve an awesome god an on-time god i'll tell you what my brother and sister so he heard he did he heard it and he recognized it was god because it was the word and this is why in the hour we're living saints we need to know what the word is otherwise we have no reference to take it back to oh i heard that now sounds good but if we don't know the word we we have no place to go back and confirm it now when we see these things going on we see things going on examine it by the word if i ever sound redundant about go back to the word go back to the word go back to the word i just ask you go to the table and type in the various variations of back to the word take it to the word the word and when i get up to the point i have said that as much as brother branham has then i'll tone it down because he constantly is telling us back to the word not this spirit that's in the land today that's like we don't need to take it back to the word because we have a vindicated prophet that's not what the prophet of god said you won't find anywhere quit taking it back to the word when you figure out i'm vindicated he just keeps on take it back to the word take it back to the word take it back to the word so if god makes a promise in the word god will send that to back it up amen i believe those words with every bit that's within me amen god will back up his word now look i believe myself and i'll put it that way so you can handle it any way you would desire but i believe this as scriptures here very much in parallel to the church today in the day that we live in amen you see my brother and sister not everyone there coming out of egypt found deliverance in their deliverance now i'm going to repeat that not everyone found deliverance in their deliverance we live in a very parallel of the day people are saying praise god i used to be this religion used to be that religion but my brother and sister we're not looking for the identity of a religion we're looking for the identity of christ and in christ we have deliverance we don't have partial deliverance we don't have a form of deliverance we don't have the concept or ideology of deliverance in christ truly in christ you have deliverance and so it's there that as these people are coming out of egypt see they not everyone found deliverance in their deliverance they were free from egypt but they were not free from themselves now we know as a mixed multitude that come out of egypt but my brother and sister let's just face it you and i sitting here tonight there's many things might have come through our family it might have been the nature we were born with some influence that come upon us as a child influencing in our in our teens or even our older age here and we do that my brother and sister and because we have the message is no guarantee that we're free from these things so where is it god's going to hear the cry of his people not well when the lord wants me to be free of my temper he'll take it from me you have to come to the place you cry out lord deliver me from this lord i need free from this spirit and whatever the spirit we won't go in that tonight because you you understand but whatever that is see it's going to come to a time as the old phrase says i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired and it's there that we have to cry but people are saying well if god wants me to be free from this no god's waiting for you to declare i will be free from this i will possess the promise of the land i will not be hindered i'm not leaving egypt to come to another egypt i'm not leaving as it were one religion to come to another religion i left a religion my brother as it were i was just a child by god's grace but as it were we left a religion to come into christ amen not into another form of religion with another hierarchy another voice telling us what we should do the voice that we are here is the voice of the holy ghost amen god's spirit himself so my brother and sister you see moses the stage was set for moses let's look at moses for a moment god raised him up in the avenue he knew the very finest of life in the house of pharaoh but god anointed him to forsake that but yet it's kind of a joke we have around our house and it is just that if you ever hear us joke about it just don't take it no deeper than just a joke but god knew moses need zippy god knew he needed zipporah hallelujah amen so i mean let's face it my brother and sister god just knew and you brothers you might have laughed at me tonight but you're married to a woman and sometimes they just have a way of cutting it right to the bone amen yeah i've got at least one amen thank you thank you and so here's moses of privilege finds himself now in a house with a brawling woman that was actually anointed of god to be what she was we'd say now according to church order and over here and over there sapori you're wrong you need to subject yourself to your husband but moses needed something to break through and god says i've got the girl she's just on the back side of a desert and moses when you're all done i'm going to have beat it right out of you where you're going to be able to say yes lord and when the lord said i want you to go down and conquer egypt he fought pardon my humor tonight i've lived with her i can conquer egypt but look what god did everything that happened we'll find it set the stage perfectly for moses to come not as a proud man not as a strong man but a man who in his own self said i can't do anything without christ i can't do anything but what the lord helps me and so god anoints moses and moses takes them or as the leadership position will put that way to lead them out and as they are heading into the promised land they're on the journey now my brother and sister i am quite sure that they were singing shouting dancing there was a lot of people whoa we're going in the promised land hallelujah but then they top arise and go down through a little cut a little ravine as it was starts out and it turns into a giant cut and they come right down on the red sea and all of a sudden they're like whoa whoa now my brother and sister they're delivered get this they're free from egypt but when they saw that red sea they realized they weren't free from themselves and then when pharaoh's army thunders into view all of the insecurities all the doubts all the fears and then praise the lord i hope you'll say amen to this when i'm done the blame game begins the reason why i'm not an overcomer is our pastor don't preach deep enough well how deep do you want him to preach preach way off to where you still can't get over a lion spirit but we want to know the deep mysteries of god no it doesn't work my brother and sister brother branham addressed that so you see we come they come down there and they come face to face this looks like they come to a geographical obstacle that in reality they were coming face to face to themselves because the truth as we all know we've heard the prophet preach it they should have walked right down there the priest and and now you know all these men and they should have never stopped there shouldn't have been a faltering in their step there shouldn't have been a head looking back to say hey guys are we doing the right thing they should have just known this is the way to the promised land then god has already opened the door for us because it's prophetic and they should have just walked right down and as they walked right into that it would have opened up amen but what did they do was it moses that hindered them aaron no themselves they were free from egypt but they weren't free from their selves but brother branham says if god makes a promise in the word god will send that to back it up see we got nothing to fear saints what we got to do is just trust the word not look at ourself not look at anything around us trust the word so now we want to look at this that that moses now has led israel and it comes to us a time that moses is now off of the scene gone off of the scene and people are like oh my goodness our promise and everything is just it has just fell to ashes at our feet because moses was supposed to take us into the promised land so it is there that when the people become struck by this but it is in that time of need in that darkest hour didn't the prophet to emphasize that in the darkest of hours god comes on the scene and has an answer and you know for them my brother and sister if you go sorry um go back one please brother sorry i got my finger out of control now look what it starts out in joshua we already jumped ahead and joshua and joshua's chiding the people for their failure to move forward in the promise has nothing to do with geographical terrain has nothing to do with circumstances surrounding them it has to do with their position they have chose to possess in the promise now you'll see my brother and sister why there's a difference in spiritual maturity in people and churches is the degree that they choose to embrace the promise so if we embrace as it is a prosperity then we will find that we will see the benefactories of prosperity or what it might be intellectualism or whatever it is my brother and sister and some people say well we should just preach a simple message and they preach it so simple that they never move forward into the revealed word of the hour god didn't say hey i'm going to reveal the word for you to put it on a shelf somewhere i reveal the word for you to receive the revelation of that and that revelation to become so real to you that you step into that and possess what's been revealed to you see if we say god's revealed something to us and we never possess it and take action on it then i would question whether it's really been revealed because a real believer cannot help but step into every revealed promise of god and possess it and see it come to fruition in their life hallelujah so right here now joshua 1 1 now after the death of moses we all cried and cried and cried come on i hope you find the parallel for the day we live in now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore turn around go back to egypt and apologize no sir it was the word of the lord saints that said come out of her my people it was not a man's word it was not a man's ideology it was not a man trying to build a church i hope you get this it was god almighty they said come out of her my people and so it was there that a prophetic word come forth and was magnified and in that magnification there was a people that said if god spoke it then we must come out we must move forward moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this jordan thou and all this people into the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even into the great river the river euphrates which if you want a historical note right now according to prophecy is drying up study it go look at it prophetic word speaking and now we're seeing even with great dams on the euphrates and the tigris here's great looming masses of concrete and a river there's a little thin trickle down here god's word comes to pass saints god's word comes to pass soul of ephesus from the wilderness lebanon even into the great river river euphrates and all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail nor forsake thee now my brother and sister i personally believe let me just put it in that realm so you can just put it on the shelf if you don't like it i personally believe this is a direct parallel to our day be strong of good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth now remember as we come into the new testament this is declared this is written on our heart so this is no longer us looking to a book and saying i must i must but now it is the holy spirit a god almighty anointed on our hearts speaking to us and people would say well do we really hear the voice of god in this day well i'll tell you my brother and sister if you read the word of god and the holy spirit moves you oh let me refrain that i'm prejudiced in my statement if you read the word of god and something moves you there's only two forces only two spirits and the devil's never going to anoint you to live a righteous and holy life so god is speaking to those naysayers that's saying well brother branham's off the scene god is no longer speaking i'm sorry saint you have missed not you but those people have missed clearly missed the opening of the word that the prophet was here for to make this and and i will touch on this if i can just get shifted somebody help me shift into a higher gear here amen so we look at this see so he's telling them to to be of good carriage be not afraid be not dismayed for the lord that god is with thee whether so ever thou goest now we see this my brother and sister you know these scriptures so you know kind of chomped them up but forgive me so we see what what is being spoken to joshua and we also know what prophet of god spoke to us about joshua what he was a type of he was not just moses's minister but this my brother and sister is the natural progression of the revealed word to deliver the people into the promise god didn't go over here and say now joshua's going to be here for just six weeks then we'll have a vote and we'll find someone else nor are we going to stop and i hope this doesn't offend anybody but nor are we going to stop here in this wilderness and build a gigantic memorial to moses and stay right here his commandment to joshua get up and go hallelujah i think i heard that i heard that thank you lord get up and go there's still a promised land right this was not at the deliverance of the promised land my brother sister this is still in the wilderness i hope you can read between the lines but look at this every word that the lord gave to moses was still ordained to be fulfilled not one word that was given to moses the prophet amen was to be shelved because we're under a new headship see that's a lot of false ministries are coming in the day we're living in and they're saying well look here this is what it is now that was then but this is now so hear me you know what we can do we can go back to the prophetic word because as it being thus saith the lord it must come to pass so you'll find these people when there's a lack of proper teaching proper leadership it would be as i've joked with you before we don't believe in acts 2 38 so we're going to tear it out of our bible well we don't believe in the anointing of the holy ghost or mark 16. when we get done we'll have a pocket-sized bible because we will have ripped so much out of it but you see every bit of this is still applicable right as we often paraphrase it not necessarily correctly in the wording of the scripture but my brother and sister jesus christ didn't come to do away with the law he come to magnify it he come to make it alive to you and i not do away with it and so well well i don't get sidetracked so every word that the lord gave to moses still ordained to be filled now look what happened is moses is bringing a ministry and if we're looking for a perfect prophet saints we're going to have to scratch moses out of the bible people in this day right here are looking for a perfect prophet they can accept moses's flaws they can expect accept all of the uh men through scripture we can accept his flaws but we're now in the 20 21st century and this prophet has to be perfect we cannot have any angry prophets we cannot have any prophets that were discouraged they must be perfect see how out of continuity people can get with the word of god they can come and say these are the rules and we're going to play by our rules and god said i don't care what you do with your rules i'm the one that set the rules i'm the one who said it in order amen so what happens is look at this now when when the lord speaks to joshua he doesn't say now joshua tell the people that day is done what does he do he seamlessly places joshua right into moses's ministry he doesn't whip out a gps and say moses had you off course we got to go over here no sir they were headed into the same promise and so it was joshua was actually magnification of the leadership god had he gave moses oh my brother and sister you look into the son of man ministry in our hour you look into the revealed word of our hour god is not stepping over here and then stepping over here and then correcting back over here it is one seamless stream of continuity of the word so when people dive off on this side and dive off on this side stop i beg you in the name of jesus christ stop and say where is the continuity of this joshua stepped right into moses's ministry and i'm declaring now that the ministry of our day hallelujah that god has ordained will seamlessly step into the prophet of our day's ministry and carry it right on hallelujah now look he was to pass this way amen brothers i don't know my finger is not working if we could go to the next quote oh maybe i have to push that down there excuse me i'm sure happy i hope you just catch this out of this it just kind of spoke to me i am sure happy to have good friends somebody say amen people who believe that might be where we find good friends with people who believe and believe the efforts that you're trying to put forth if i had any other objective just merely to be different why i would be a real sinner but my objective is to magnify jesus christ so the prophet now has declared the only thing i want to raise up in front of you is jesus christ interesting and something that's in a man when you have a message from god you cannot stop yourself there is something in you pulsating it goes on anyhow you can't slow it up stop it or start it it stops and starts and slows you up see it's the one that has control amen and we live in an hour i'm going to just make a very very direct statement we live in an hour that people say the fivefold ministry is just there to push their agenda on the message you know what it is they don't believe the one has control they believe man is in control whoa hallelujah come on amen but my objective is to magnify jesus christ and i will punctuate that with an amen punctuate it with that's what my heart cries that's what i believe that's what i see and i hope that's what you get when you hear me preach amen no other no other idea or ideology amen now i'm going to cut out a few little notes here and we're just going to go right to god's provided way little did those egyptian slaves know meaning israel when they stood on the bank after seeing the great revival that the prophet come down and brought to them they'd seen the mighty hand of god and they'd been protected and come out there and dancing in the spirit after they'd crossed through the red sea isn't this it was like a modern day oh i hope this don't offend you i'm going to say it anyhow we got folks that they have a revival oh hallelujah and then the revival's over hmm and it's like i don't even know if i'm a christian i don't even know if i'm a christian i will lord help me help me another revival and it goes on and on and on go study your bible i challenge you go study your bible through the pastor the wilderness of sin and israel lived from the supernatural to the supernatural and the lows were really low but remind you of this when the rows are really low and we've all had them somebody have courage enough to say yep we've had them but the lows are really low but you've got to climb a long ways to get back to the top right and god says you know what if you'll just trust me you don't have to go down there you can stay here in the spirit amen imagine if the holy spirit moved like our spirit moved we'd be in trouble we'd be in real trouble saints but they were dancing in the spirit after they crossed the red sea and seeing their enemies drown behind them all their habits and things see what brother brown's talking about not everyone was delivered from themselves seeing their enemies drown behind them all their habits and things like we'd call today drown behind them the things that torment them and miriam dancing in the spirit and moses singing in the spirit and so forth little did they know that when they was only about 10 days from the promised land knowing that they were 40 years away from it it just looked so good didn't it saints come on now we can take words now don't misunderstand me i trust those of you who know me know me amen but the prophet of god i believe the coming of the lord is right around the corner i believe it could even be this year i believe it can't be this much more time it can't be and people grasp at those things and when the years or tick tick tick tick and some said you know what the prophet of god said 78 nothing happened 78 this message is false 77 sorry yeah huh yeah that's when the year was over i guess you could take that maybe i wasn't wrong thank you lord thank you brother david but you know what i mean is it this place and time tick-tick i know brothers older brothers they lived through that and they said literally the churches emptied out the people that said oh that's false but you see what they were doing as they were looking at the wrong detail yeah maybe what the prophet of god saw was the thinning out of the church maybe he saw that there would be a season and this was necessary i don't know you know what i find interesting i'm getting lost but forgive me you know what i find interesting people who don't even know their own mind are explaining god how can that be ten days from promised land knowing that they were 40 years away from it why because they refused to follow god they wanted a law instead of grace and they got it so they could make their own way and have their own so and so man's always tried to do something by himself and god let every one of them perish in the wild and raised up and i'm going to shout because i believe we are that generation raised up a new generation my brother and sister that wasn't looking oh don't misunderstand me tonight i pray wasn't looking to say we were with the prophet we were with the prophet we hunted we fished we traveled my brother and sister the word says blessed are we having not seen believe amen so it's there that we didn't have that experience but we now have a holy ghost revealed experience that we are looking at and it's a real experience to us no man can pluck it out of our hand and out of our heart no man can explain what god has done to us and for us playing it away they can say whale biss and whale that my brother and sister you're too late you're too late god's come on the scene he's he's a prayer answering god he's a delivering god he's a providing god he's a holy ghost that is cleansing us with the fire of his word amen of the holy spirit and it's there we know that is real and the naysayer can say there is no promised land imagine i want to put this right before we move on there would be people standing in the congregation of israel brother trevor and they would have come to that 40 years in the wilderness not knowing that just over that little mountain range was the promised land and they'd be saying i don't even think there's a promised land i think they brought us out here just another religion as it was in the days of our fathers and people are like yeah so if this i hope you get this if this is all there is to life then i'm going to go whoop it up and i'm just going to live it up and i'm going to just jump into the big pool of sin see something was missing because the real believer anointed under a joshua ministry said god said there was a promised land i don't care if i can see a trace of a promised land i don't care if we've ever seen a speck of dust from a promised land or if i've ever seen a messenger that's been to a promised land god said there's a promised land and he said he's taking me there they would be looking at no escape route no shortcut no whatever they would be saying no god said it i believe it i will stand upon that see man's always tried to do something by himself and god let every one of them perish why because they wouldn't go god's provided way now little did the pentecostal there's pretty strong words here little did the pentecostal church know of 40 or 50 years ago when you were dancing in the spirit and them old long-haired mothers long dresses on that their daughters would ever be hollywood queens as they try to be today see saints this is why i don't want to impose my will upon this church but i feel compelled things like the shoes and certain kinds of dresses and blouses and all these kind of things for the sisters and and i'm just as judgmental and i'll just admit this is just something in me i don't think a brother ought to walk around with a shirt undone down here because to a sister that might just be uh just as much in a carnal way an influence to them right we're called to be righteous people we're called to be holy people we're called to be according to the word amen not some rule for them an exception for us but god's got a rule as it would if you put that word of holiness and it's not a not a rule it's a amen so you look at that and my little did they know when men of integrity godly men who would die for that word stand under gunfire and everything else called holy roller thrown in jail throwing the street corner run off on one corner and be on the other one uh bringing the gospel that their sons would even permit such a thing to come to bring the churches into a place like the rest of the denomination see what happened here just a generation look how close this is just a generation now i don't want to sound judgmental but the generation previous to us testifying they'll live by their testimony or be judged by their testimony but we have a problem saints we're looking back to that generation thinking their position in christ is our testimony i hope you see this i'm keeping it in simplicity their testimony will only be our testimony the faithful will only be our testimony if our testimony is kept faithful it won't be my daddy knew we were here we were there this happened to us prophet prayed for me as a child these kind of things that we see in this day and age yes i'm speaking kind of direct saints forgive me but look at this that isn't going to matter old daddy that saintly dad that saintly mother they've died they've gone to their reward and people are living in this generation off of that testimony that's right we have to have our own testimony we have to testify of the gospel of jesus christ the unerring fulfilling word of our day and our life has to be the testimony that verifies that hallelujah 40 years oh my 40 years they've been look at the type 40 years but there's a new one coming up i hope this stirs your heart like it did mine as i'm studying this after 40 years a new one's coming up god will restore saith god somebody that will walk in the spirit bringing the truth tell the truth joshua jehovah's savior led them across jordan you know what it was we know what the prophet said joshua was a representation of jesus christ look at the hour we're living in my brother and sister it's not going to be this great pastor this evangelist this great man here this person is the man of this continent and this is the person of the man of the continent it is the jesus christ jehovah leading you and i into our promised land it is the holy ghost it will not be is there a fivefold ministry is there a ministry on the earth today absolutely i'll believe it with all my life i'll read you a quote in just a moment but my brother and sister without that we can sit in the most holy ghost-filled church on the face of the earth and without the holy ghost we might as well be in a bar room that sounds harsh doesn't it we might as well be in the park we might as well be anywhere else but when you come to the place think about it katie's barnea something the lord stirred my heart so many years ago i've never been able to get away from that okay dysparnia laodicea is too wicked the devil's too tricky we won't be able to keep our children but praise the lord our children will go out and they'll be caught up in the world and they'll be defiled they'll be torn down they'll be scarred but we're going to apply the token and god will bring our children back and they'll be saved sounds good doesn't it unless of course you've got the holy ghost and then we're going to stand and say satan take your hands off of our children our children are sealed by the blood of jesus christ and we have a ring of fire around them they're not your satan you don't get to defile them you don't get to mark their life you don't get to have your way with them because these are sons and daughters of god but the other one's like well we just have to let them go i've heard this saints out of the mouth of believers well my daughter's working on her testimony seriously you know what the problem is please don't think i'm being harsh there's no cry there mama has resigned herself daddy has resigned himself my children are caught up in the grips of the devil there's nothing i can do that's the devil speaking amen do i need to belabor that or is it obvious hallelujah you see my brother and sister it comes down to the point we have to decide who's leading us amen we have to decide what's happening we have to decide whether a wife a husband children or parents a brother or a sister or a friend is worth crying for or do we resign ourselves you imagine if they caught the revelation that god's given to you and i katish barnia if they had caught the revelation that god has granted to you and i saints when joshua got up there and said we have a promise i'm just paraphrasing make the point we have a promise it doesn't matter yes they're right every one of these ministers that said that the giants are big and this and that they're all right but we have a promise rise up now possess the land what would have happened saints if israel would amen later rose up the very next morning maybe even that night i don't know and they would have went and possessed the land but you know what they did they listened oh pardon me for using this word but i just can't find another word they listen to these panty waste preachers well our young people are facing very challenging times with music and clothing and peer pressure and i'm afraid if i get down in the face of our young people and tell them they need the holy ghost that they're never going to come back to church well it will if i just go ahead and slap gabriella i know i can get away with this she's my adopted granddaughter and family you know they can't really get away from you but what if and i'm just preaching saints i'm not making a point what if i remind her how much i love her how much she means to me but you have to have the holy ghost you can't leave these worldly things in your life you've got to get rid of them you've got to get washed in the fountain in the house of david and people are so afraid of losing their young people that they're losing their young people i would rather take the risk of looking them in the face and as i said i can do that with gabriella because i know she'll forgive me because she loves me but i want to do that to every one of our young people every one of you older vika gideon titus heidi shawn every one of you my own granddaughter because i want you to know there is a life amen we don't have to stop and say the enemy's too big we don't have to stop and say oh but we're not able we don't have enough revelation i'm sorry i got prophetic word that says everything you need to make the rapture is already inside of you and i believe that word and i'm going to stand on that word and i'm going to believe that god is taking me to the rapture and taking you to the rapture my brother and sister enough that i will stand up and be a witness of this gospel this message of the hour i will be a witness and god hold me accountable for my position as a witness but beyond my human failure i can find grace at calvary i can be covered with the blood and i can press forward to say amen to the word because there is a promised land for sons and daughters to go to hallelujah hallelujah let me just go into this god hiding if you come sister ruth god hiding himself in simplicity now i love this you see there's a lot of conflicting a lot of conflicting ideas in the land today and men of great stature and influence are behind some of these ideologies uh but this is the i'd all the ideology saints that i want you to embrace i can encourage you to embrace something i want you to embrace this first of all here i encourage you go read before and after god won't leave his program what he done for them he'll do for us the grace and mercy poured out upon them he will pour out upon us his spirit that he poured out upon them he will pour out upon us hallelujah [Music] god won't leave his program that's the reason we know that this day it's got to be simple see now he works in simplicity but god in the beginning that could have made the sun preach the gospel or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preached the gospel but he ordained men for that purpose and he never changes that amen regardless of what man's idea might be my brother and sister [Music] and you'll notice he never said man it's plural he never ordained he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of men he never ordained men to preach the gospel i mean he ordained men to preach the gospel not machinery mechanical devices or any angelic being it was man now i want you to catch this the real emphasis i'm actually making is not what you might think it's right here in this first line god see i could quote this quote very political very pointed but i'll be honest with you the very meaning of this to me is right there in that first sentence god will never leave his program let me just close this out when he stood right there and spoke in egypt and said i will bring you out and i will take you in in every age right down to our day i will bring you out i will take you in god does not change his program we don't have to compromise we don't have to soften it we don't have to coat it in butter chocolate or whatever else we can do this we can preach a gospel preach it in love and the desire in the heart and soul of sons and daughters of god will draw them to the word aren't you glad hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my thank you lord thank you lord let's just stand and worship the lord for just a few short minutes before we go home amen i trust that i didn't leave any uh uncovered or uh confusing things there saint says that's what happens when paul tries to compress a lot of thoughts into a short time amen days and days and days of thoughts are hard to just speak in a little bit of time amen listening that song i will praise him that's what we're here for saints is to just lift our hands and our hearts to praise our lord amen joshua jehovah amen has come down he's right here in our midst and he said you know what i'm going to lead you through another wilderness i always thought as a young boy when i read my bible i thought why would god name that wilderness of sin i i just i thought that is a strange name and i got a little older and i figured this out saints everywhere you go everywhere you go this bush of sin and that bush of sin and that blade of sin and that tree of sin and that whatever of sin is just a wilderness amen but my god said you just stick with me follow me day and night isn't that beautiful god never said you know what what i'm going to do i'm going to provide a cloud for you to follow it and then when the sun goes down you guys will just have to endure until morning no sir he said i'll be with you day and night because i am your god and you are my people and i have made a covenant to you and i keep my covenants oh hallelujah when i saw the cleansing fountain [Music] isn't
