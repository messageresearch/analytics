[37:49] robbed out of that amen well Hallelujah
[37:53] we are so happy uh sister April we pray
[37:57] for you
[37:58] constantly uh didn't bother you too much
[38:00] sending texts and stuff sometimes they

[38:05] want you to know the church prayed for
[38:07] you constantly and uh it is a beautiful
[38:11] thing to be a part of a body amen and uh
[38:15] it's U just a lovely time amen uh just
[38:19] before we stand here um I got a couple
[38:22] things there'll be no Wednesday service
[38:24] and I bring you um greetings from
[38:26] brother Dwayne sister Connie I would
[38:29] take too much time this morning to share
[38:31] the incredible things that we
[38:33] experienced there we got to see the Lord
[38:36] I shared with brother Alex just a little
[38:37] bit we got to see the Lord do the
[38:40] Supernatural and you say well what was
[38:42] that a healing a great Deliverance no
[38:45] what it was is the Lord
[38:47] anointing now this might sound boastful
[38:50] to some people but the Lord anointing
[38:52] the
[38:53] ministry to speak the things that touch
[38:56] the lives of the people people and the
[38:58] ministry is completely naive to what is
[39:02] happening does not have any clue of what
[39:07] God is doing but yet after the fact God
[39:11] brings it about and shows that it was
[39:14] spot on and I say thank you Lord because
[39:16] I happen to be that Ministry and we're
[39:18] not here to boast about that but we're
[39:20] here to say Thank You Lord that you
[39:22] would use us to speak to your people
[39:26] amen and I forgot brother Philip right
[39:28] yeah I forgot to greet you brother
[39:30] Phillip we're glad to have you here
[39:32] brother Phillip is Sister Diane's
[39:33] brother and um so I don't know if we can
[39:36] make this claim but I think he's
[39:38] probably high on the list of of brother
[39:41] there so put right at the top of that
[39:43] list but uh we thank the Lord for that
[39:46] opportunity that we we had there
[39:48] Saskatoon and in Edmonton both just
[39:51] lovely lovely times and it would take a
[39:54] whole service literally to share the
[39:56] things that that we got to see what God
[39:59] did and uh how that he come about
[40:02] answering prayers answering questions
[40:05] and and uh just a lovely time and I say

[40:41] married yes
[40:45] Hallelujah
[40:46] yeah amen the scripture says blessed is
[40:49] the man who gets a good wife and I think
[40:52] brother Alex is blessed so uh those of
[40:55] you won't be going to the wedding could
[40:57] you let us know so we can make sure that
[41:00] we make the right decisions here uh at
[41:03] the church um just a quick text or just
[41:07] share that um if nobody's going to be
[41:10] here there's no need turning the lights
[41:12] on but if you're going to be here uh I
[41:16] don't know I put Brother David in a spot
[41:18] he said well he's still praying about it
[41:20] but he said he he would he would take
[41:23] care of uh the Saints here at the church
[41:26] if that was if that was necessary or

[41:57] and uh I just want to say I missed you
[42:00] each and every one of you I missed you
[42:02] and it was just uh you know uh thought
[42:06] about you a lot prayed for you and uh
[42:10] let's just stand as we go to the word I
[42:12] want to uh a titled the thought today
[42:15] proven to Perfection now my brother and
[42:19] sister I visited a brother who has a
[42:22] machine shop in
[42:24] Edmonton uh you know when once people
[42:27] get used to working in such tolerance
[42:31] they don't think it's anything to go to
[42:33] the hundreds of a thousands of an inch
[42:35] and the brother just talked about it
[42:37] very casually as he showed me these
[42:40] these deals that they're building as
[42:41] replacement parts for an existing
[42:43] machine and he's like these are down to
[42:46] a tolerance of 1 1,000th of an inch and
[42:51] I got to thinking about that what is
[42:55] perfection you see he's declaring
[42:57] something to one 1,000th of an inch but
[42:59] it's still not
[43:01] perfect and as we look at this thought
[43:03] today by God's grace we'll realize that
[43:06] our idea of perfection and God's idea of
[43:08] perfection are not quite the same amen
[43:11] and he said you know we ordered a new
[43:14] part which were several thousand dollar
[43:17] and they're rebuilding several hundred
[43:19] of these so you can see the math and the
[43:22] new part he said is of lesser tolerance
[43:26] than what we we are
[43:28] producing he says so we're exceeding the
[43:31] original oh I hope you catch this this
[43:34] morning we're exceeding the
[43:36] original and we don't feel like that's
[43:39] good enough that's
[43:40] it so let's look at this today proven to
[43:44] Perfection 1 Peter 4
[43:48] 12-13 now you're going to say brother
[43:50] Paul this seems like it's going a
[43:52] different direction but but please bear
[43:54] with me beloved think it not strange
[43:57] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[43:59] try you as though some strange thing
[44:02] happened unto you but rejoice in as much
[44:06] as ye are partakers of Christ's
[44:07] suffering that when his glory shall be
[44:10] revealed ye may be glad also with
[44:13] exceeding Joy because when his glory is
[44:16] revealed your glory is revealed amen
[44:20] amen is't that beautiful Lord we ask you
[44:22] to bless the service today bless the
[44:24] visitors the Saints father so happy to
[44:27] be here together with each and everyone
[44:29] come now speak to our hearts Lord and
[44:31] draw Us close to you I pray in the name
[44:33] of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[44:40] seated you know sometimes in our
[44:42] Christian walk uh we we go along and the
[44:46] ups and downs of life and some of us may
[44:48] be a little bit more uh susceptible to
[44:51] the ups and downs than others but my
[44:53] brother and sister we if we're not
[44:56] careful we almost want God to be our
[44:59] grandfather and and that grandfather
[45:02] atmosphere is such that it's kind of
[45:04] like spoil me and tell me how wonderful
[45:07] I am now those of you that are
[45:09] grandparents you know that comes quite
[45:10] easily right you just want to hold those
[45:13] kids up close and and just tell them you
[45:15] know uh I love you mostess and then you
[45:18] got the next grandchild and you tell
[45:19] them I love you most and then the
[45:21] grandchildren start to grow up and say
[45:23] now which one of us is the mostest and
[45:26] uh you know my my own grandmother love
[45:28] bless her heart you know she she told
[45:30] every one of us grandchildren you know I
[45:33] want to give this to you I want to give
[45:34] this to you until she had split it in so
[45:37] many ways there really wasn't much there
[45:39] to give and you look at that and realize
[45:42] the very nature that Humanity has we we
[45:45] love that grandfather kind of atmosphere
[45:49] and you know uh it's just spoil me and
[45:51] tell me how wonderful I am and imagine
[45:54] my brother and sister that we as Sons
[45:55] and Daughters of God just wanting
[45:57] everything to be our way we want we want
[46:00] life to go our way we want God to answer
[46:02] our prayers the way that we want God to
[46:04] answer our prayers and and we want him
[46:06] the scripture says and he makes the way
[46:08] smooth before us and our idea of smooth
[46:11] is like glass and God's idea is I knock
[46:14] the biggest of the boulders out of your
[46:16] way and so it's there you can overcome
[46:19] all the rest and so we want it to be
[46:21] kind of our way and you know we have a
[46:24] savior who promised to bring us into a
[46:26] state or a condition of perfection and
[46:29] well look at that when you think about
[46:31] that 1 1,000 of an inch is just you know
[46:34] UNP perceptible to the human eye touch
[46:37] and and it's there that we look but you
[46:40] know this man this brother is uh just
[46:43] driven to to do things in the realm of
[46:47] perfection and um I thought it's
[46:49] interesting because they'll tell you
[46:51] that um you know that uh a messy desk is
[46:54] a sign of a smart person and this
[46:57] brother must be smart beyond measure
[46:59] amen because he had a very messy desk
[47:02] but you look at this and realize that
[47:03] something down in the heart is moving
[47:06] Sons and Daughters of God that we
[47:08] actually desire deep down in our heart
[47:10] to reach the state of perfection now my
[47:13] brother and sister because we in the
[47:15] flesh can never accomplish the
[47:17] Perfection of Christ but that word
[47:20] Moving On Us stirring our hearts is
[47:22] drawing us into a position where we want
[47:25] to be perfect and in any less desire
[47:28] than that if we have a spirit saying I
[47:30] I'll be close close is close enough my
[47:32] brother and sister that'll never do you
[47:34] need to have a spirit that is moving you
[47:37] and stirring your heart where you desire
[47:39] to come into perfection in our Lord
[47:41] Jesus Christ to be Flawless in Christ
[47:44] Jesus amen they'll never be Flawless In
[47:47] the Flesh you know the word shows us
[47:49] very clearly this flesh will bother us
[47:52] amen is there anybody here today that
[47:53] your flesh bothers you amen well don't
[47:56] be discouraged amen that's the word God
[47:59] doesn't want us to come to a place that
[48:01] we're complacent on this Earth
[48:03] complacent in our spiritual position he
[48:06] wants us to constantly strive some
[48:08] people feel like that if they're still
[48:10] yearning for something more they must be
[48:12] lacking something well that's true in
[48:15] one sense but it's not true in another
[48:17] because God put that nature in us to
[48:20] desire to live a higher life amen to not
[48:23] aim for a natural life or this but to be
[48:27] having a heavenly vision and if our
[48:29] vision is not a heavenly vision then
[48:31] what vision is it amen anything less
[48:34] than a heavenly vision is a carnal or
[48:36] Earthbound vision and God wants you to
[48:39] not look at this world right here and
[48:41] and he wants you to look up it's
[48:43] interesting as we are in Canada many
[48:46] brothers and sister ask me brother Paul
[48:48] how do you feel about the election and I
[48:51] said praise God the election was perfect
[48:53] and they're like really you I said no
[48:55] cuz whatever happen happened was God's
[48:57] will God's will is perfect amen we're
[49:00] not looking at this world my brother and
[49:02] sister you know Sister Jerry threw this
[49:04] out at me as we were traveling she said
[49:06] you know I think Donald Trump might be
[49:08] just the right guy for president and I
[49:10] said oh why she says cuz I think he
[49:13] would sign the note with the
[49:15] Pope what a what a different way to look
[49:17] at it caught me off guard right but
[49:19] there's got to be someone in a
[49:20] leadership position in this world in
[49:23] this country right now to fulfill the
[49:25] prophecy and so it's there God's going
[49:28] to have the right person in place the
[49:30] one that will say I'll sign that and my
[49:32] brother and sister that debts already
[49:34] there somebody's got to sign for it and
[49:37] by the way our country is set up you
[49:39] know he has the authority to commit you
[49:42] to the debt but my brother and sister
[49:44] the devil come right in and thought
[49:46] that's a perfect plan I think I have the
[49:48] authority to sign you to the debt but my
[49:50] brother and sister look what the word
[49:52] told us there is no debt no debt at all
[49:55] it's already been covered and the
[49:57] prophet of God come across this quote I
[49:59] should have included it if I thought I
[50:00] was going this way this morning the
[50:02] prophet of God said we are incurring a
[50:04] debt every single
[50:08] day backslide daily do we believe that I
[50:13] don't know about you guys you guys might
[50:14] be perfect but this guy is not
[50:18] perfect backslide
[50:20] daily and then the prophet says but that
[50:23] debt is paid by A Perfect sacrif
[50:27] rice
[50:28] daily oh Hallelujah I'm not incre a debt
[50:32] that I come one day and stand before the
[50:34] Lord pulling this great debt with me
[50:37] it's paid every single day thank you
[50:40] Lord Can someone say thank you Lord amen
[50:43] our debt is paid every single day amen
[50:46] so we have a savior our lord Jesus
[50:49] promised to bring us into state or
[50:50] condition of perfection and the only
[50:52] place we can find to be Flawless is in
[50:55] Jesus Christ
[50:57] now this is tempered a little bit by my
[50:59] experience with this brother and he says
[51:02] for as perfect as these pieces we are
[51:05] making seem to be when magnified there's
[51:10] all kinds of flaws
[51:13] amen now my brother and sister the Lord
[51:15] Jesus Christ comes and the only time he
[51:18] ever magnifies a flaw to you and I is
[51:21] when he wants us to see where we're
[51:23] standing never condemns us with it but
[51:26] look at with his great magnifying glass
[51:28] of Leo DEA is pointing out every flaw in
[51:32] your life every mistake that you're
[51:34] making and we view under that expanded
[51:37] Vision we say I'm not good enough to go
[51:40] to church I'm not good enough to take
[51:41] communion my brother and sister there's
[51:43] all kinds of things that Satan offers up
[51:45] to us but I want you today just speaking
[51:48] about communion let me be a little
[51:49] pointed on that if you're sitting here
[51:51] today and you're not taking communion I
[51:54] want to know why that's right not a man
[51:57] you don't have to answer to me but I
[51:58] want you to face the fact that God
[52:01] called you to take communion you're not
[52:03] taking it what kind of flaw do you think
[52:05] you have in your life that would be
[52:07] keeping you from communion when God said
[52:11] every day I pay your debt for
[52:13] you every day I pay that debt I have an
[52:16] atonement a sacrifice for you what would
[52:19] keep us it's a lie of the devil I'll
[52:21] tell you that's what's keeping us and I
[52:23] hope I'm not too blunt to you but I've
[52:25] just had another little transition in my
[52:27] life in case you don't know I got a few
[52:29] days older and so I've got a few days
[52:32] bunter amen so it's time for us my
[52:35] brother and sister to stop why when the
[52:37] scripture placed it the prophet placed
[52:39] it why do we let Satan's lie keep us
[52:42] from fulfilling it from doing it we
[52:45] should be saying okay the debts paid I'm
[52:48] going to take communion I'm going to let
[52:50] the world know let the devil know that I
[52:52] am in communion with the Lord Jesus
[52:54] Christ amen but the the devil presents
[52:57] all kinds of ideas all kinds of
[52:59] doctrines men's ideas that men like well
[53:02] you have to this and you have to that to
[53:03] take communion that's not what my Bible
[53:05] showed me that's not what the message
[53:07] showed me he gives us a clear picture
[53:09] that we should be taking it till the
[53:10] coming of the Lord amen so amen if that
[53:14] stepped on your toes I'm sorry but um
[53:17] that's just how it is amen see never
[53:19] Flawless in the
[53:22] flesh flesh will bother you every day of
[53:24] your life
[53:27] job
[53:31] 1:1 there was a man in the land of us
[53:35] whose name was job and that man was
[53:37] perfect and upright one that feared God
[53:41] and rescued evil this is God's testimony
[53:44] of job isn't that awesome that testimony
[53:48] is recorded in the word amen so here is
[53:51] the word declaring that he is upright
[53:55] and perfect and feared God and Es skewed
[53:58] evil you couldn't ask for a better
[54:00] believer amen but I'll tell you my
[54:02] brother and sister job wasn't the only
[54:04] believer that God has that testimony of
[54:07] Amen it is not there that God says well
[54:10] I found a couple I'll record them in
[54:11] scripture he's reproducing his pattern
[54:15] over and over again today amen the word
[54:19] producing the same pattern again and
[54:23] again and again
[54:26] you see once God dialed it in which
[54:29] wasn't here in leoda it was before the
[54:32] foundation of the world God said this is
[54:35] when I say dialed it in it wasn't like
[54:37] he had an imperfect and cast it away
[54:39] another imperfect and cast it away when
[54:41] God said this is what I want my
[54:42] Believers to be and I'll record it in
[54:44] the word and I will uh record it for
[54:46] posterity that Sons and Daughters of God
[54:49] through all the ages will be able to
[54:51] live by the same exact pattern not a
[54:53] deviation of a pattern that's why the
[54:55] Apostle Paul said don't take one word
[54:57] away from it don't add one word to it
[54:59] because then you break God's
[55:02] pattern do you realize every one of us
[55:04] how different are we we start on the
[55:06] front row and now I'm not saying they're
[55:08] more different than the second row but
[55:14] possibility the very pattern of the word
[55:18] duplicated again and again and again God
[55:23] didn't have special standard for you
[55:25] special standard for them and you feel
[55:27] like you're inferior because you don't
[55:28] seem to be on the same standard as them
[55:30] no it's the same word same standard God
[55:33] has the same expectation and we'll get
[55:35] the same
[55:36] result that's the thing that ought to
[55:38] cause us to Rejoice is that God will
[55:40] produce the same life in you and I so
[55:43] look at the screen read the scripture
[55:46] put yourself in there right now we're in
[55:48] Idaho the city of Nampa we're off of
[55:51] Midland Boulevard and Boone Street amen
[55:54] there was a man in the land of n
[55:57] whose name was put your name in there
[55:59] and that man was perfect and upright one
[56:01] that feared God and Es skewed evil amen
[56:03] just cuz your name is not in those words
[56:05] there God's producing the same exact
[56:08] result in you and if we have any less
[56:12] expectation than that then the devil is
[56:14] lying to you and it's time for us to
[56:16] stop and say devil I'm not going to
[56:18] listen to your lies any longer the word
[56:20] says amen this is what the prophet told
[56:23] us this day that there would be a word
[56:25] bride amen amen not a denominational
[56:28] Spirit bride not a bride that's a
[56:30] mixture of this and a mixture of that
[56:33] but it would be a word bride which the
[56:35] word being perfect and being Christ
[56:37] himself amen we can expect the same
[56:40] exact result so look at this here job
[56:42] 1:1 put yourself in that scripture today
[56:47] and have expectation that you can live
[56:49] that and meet that amen now let's go
[56:52] here as it is to job 17 just jump down a
[56:56] few few verses and the Lord said unto
[56:58] Satan whence cometh thou then Satan
[57:00] answered the Lord and said from going to
[57:02] and fro in the earth and from walking up
[57:04] and down in it and the Lord said unto
[57:06] Satan hast thou considered you see Satan
[57:09] never said I'm pursuing your servant job
[57:13] God says here is my servant job yeah
[57:18] my my you mean God would volunteer you
[57:22] and I
[57:26] but not
[57:27] us not us
[57:32] Lord let someone else have that fiery
[57:36] trial I like it nice and calm I like it
[57:39] to be
[57:41] just yeah
[57:43] lukewarm yeah yeah steel that's lukewarm
[57:48] is malleable still but pretty rigid in
[57:51] its thinking pretty rigid in its form
[57:54] but you see God wants us to be able to
[57:57] be formed by the word he wants us to be
[57:59] filled and so he he says here consider
[58:04] my servant job and there's none like him
[58:06] in the earth that's a pretty large
[58:08] compliment but remember it's as a
[58:11] prophet puts it one in a million makes
[58:15] this pretty small number don't take that
[58:17] and kick everybody else reminds me one
[58:19] time I was working on a construction job
[58:21] and I had a Jehovah Witness I'm not
[58:24] speaking down on them but to just kind
[58:26] of let you see how that we have to be
[58:28] careful how we look at things and and
[58:31] I'm working on this house and the man
[58:33] comes up and says can I talk to you and
[58:37] I I climbed down off of what I was
[58:39] working on and got down and I said yeah
[58:41] how can I help you and he says oh I'm a
[58:43] I'm a I'm a Jehovah Witness he gave me
[58:45] his
[58:46] name and uh he starts to tell me why I
[58:50] should join their
[58:52] church and uh at this point uh he's
[58:55] really laying out brother Trevor you
[58:57] would loved it cuz the way you think
[58:59] about things you would have loved this
[59:00] he's laying out this perfect picture of
[59:02] why I should be a Jehovah Witness and he
[59:04] gets to a point and he says you know our
[59:06] church is growing so fast there's 6.7
[59:09] million of us and I just looked at him I
[59:12] said sir can I ask you a
[59:14] question
[59:16] yeah your belief is only 144,000 are
[59:19] going to heaven what are you doing with
[59:22] the rest of
[59:23] them he decided he had some place else
[59:26] to go but you see we don't want to
[59:29] become so narrow in our thinking that we
[59:32] build a fence around God's word and say
[59:35] well you know as it is you're in but
[59:37] you're out you know who you are right
[59:40] now doesn't look like a message believer
[59:42] to me so you must be out my brother and
[59:45] sister tomorrow the Holy Spirit might
[59:47] fall upon that man and he change his
[59:49] life and kind line himself up with the
[59:51] word and just have a miraculous change
[59:54] but we've still got him out that's right
[59:57] you know what that leaves us out of the
[59:58] will of God not him amen we need to
[1:00:02] think about this not putting people out
[1:00:06] amen so consider my servant and Satan
[1:00:10] answered the Lord and says doth job fear
[1:00:12] God for not hast thou not made a hedge
[1:00:14] about him you know what that tells us my
[1:00:16] brother and sister there's a hedge
[1:00:18] around you amen aren't you glad God's
[1:00:20] got a hedge around you amen cuz we get
[1:00:23] buffeted enough amen but you know what
[1:00:26] God's Not Afraid God's not afraid to go
[1:00:30] and open that hedge amen no one can open
[1:00:33] that hedge but him amen and so when you
[1:00:36] come to the place you're in fiery trials
[1:00:39] don't go even blaming the devil because
[1:00:42] God harnessed Satan put a bit in his
[1:00:44] mouth and put a a a harness on him to
[1:00:49] fulfill what he wanted to happen in
[1:00:51] job's life Satan thinking I'm in charge
[1:00:54] here now but God says you can't touch
[1:00:56] his life you can't take his life my
[1:00:58] brother and sister you realize that
[1:01:00] alone bound Satan this flesh is flesh
[1:01:05] God will allow this flesh to be
[1:01:06] tormented he'll allow diseases like
[1:01:08] cancer to come but that's not a cancer
[1:01:11] of the Soul it's a cancer of the flesh a
[1:01:15] cancer of the Soul comes with a lukewarm
[1:01:18] unprotected son or daughter of God or
[1:01:21] unbelief coming in and when the lifeline
[1:01:23] is cut off my brother and sister this
[1:01:25] flesh
[1:01:26] Withers Go In the Heat of the summer and
[1:01:29] just take any kind of plant you want and
[1:01:32] just take your Little Nippers and just
[1:01:34] clip that thing and see how long before
[1:01:36] that beautiful nice big flowing leaf and
[1:01:40] stem turns into nothing and that's what
[1:01:42] Satan wants to do but he can't come and
[1:01:45] use the Clipper on your life without
[1:01:46] your
[1:01:48] permission that's why Satan creeping in
[1:01:50] see he wants to creep in he wants to
[1:01:53] come in slowly so he can cut the life
[1:01:55] off slowly so we don't realize we're
[1:01:58] actually spiritually
[1:02:01] dying if the devil come and walked up to
[1:02:04] you you know the guy with horns and a
[1:02:05] pitchfork Fork tail come up and said you
[1:02:08] know what I'm going to take your life
[1:02:11] you would push
[1:02:12] back but when he takes
[1:02:14] it a millimeter at a
[1:02:19] time a day at a
[1:02:24] time the scripture says it's the lust of
[1:02:27] the Flesh and pride of life that's how
[1:02:30] he entices
[1:02:31] us you love the quote I believe brother
[1:02:35] brandham says you know that we have to
[1:02:38] go out to the devil CU if he come in he
[1:02:40] would be our brother so when we get out
[1:02:43] from underneath the blood that's where
[1:02:46] Satan starts to get to us the little
[1:02:48] things that have already creeped into
[1:02:49] our life and Satan is able then to add
[1:02:52] to it
[1:02:53] amen but that's not who we are this
[1:02:55] morning morning is it amen are we a
[1:02:57] church full of Sons and Daughters of God
[1:02:59] this morning Believers of the word amen
[1:03:02] we're going to live that word put it
[1:03:04] into action that's who we are today amen
[1:03:07] amen and we ought to be vocal about it
[1:03:09] I'm not saying that be vocal just to be
[1:03:10] heard but you know maybe it's in your
[1:03:12] closet amen maybe it's in your living
[1:03:15] room by yourself or car or whatever be
[1:03:17] vocal I am a Son of God I a daughter of
[1:03:20] God and Satan I'm not your
[1:03:23] property amen
[1:03:26] so the Lord offers job to the
[1:03:30] devil and uh you know God just opens
[1:03:34] that hedge and
[1:03:35] it it fulfills some people's idea that
[1:03:38] God is not a loving
[1:03:41] God but I want you to see get a little
[1:03:43] ahead of
[1:03:46] myself God saw something in job's
[1:03:49] life that job couldn't see that's right
[1:03:53] but let's stop now he said he was
[1:03:55] righteous
[1:03:57] man do we have a
[1:04:00] paradox here is a man who would make the
[1:04:04] Rapture follow me yes sir but God said
[1:04:08] making the Rapture is not actually the
[1:04:11] parameter I have set for your
[1:04:15] life come on are you with me we think
[1:04:18] about oh Lord I want to make the Rapture
[1:04:20] I want to make the
[1:04:22] Rapture but God says I want you to be
[1:04:24] perfect in my S it right through the
[1:04:27] word that's right so I'm not making a
[1:04:30] Doctrine here nobody get nervous okay
[1:04:33] let go of the seat
[1:04:35] cushion but you see God set a standard
[1:04:38] to make a Rapture right here but he's
[1:04:41] calling you and I even higher than that
[1:04:44] standard to make the Rapture otherwise
[1:04:47] if we just got to that little minute I'm
[1:04:50] thinking in millimeters cuz I've been
[1:04:52] listening to these Canadians for 2 weeks
[1:04:54] millimeter millimeter millimeter
[1:04:56] and I'm like um brother told me he says
[1:04:58] you know how much 40 mm is don't you
[1:05:00] brother Paul and I said uh it's a
[1:05:02] measurement cuz I have no clue what 40
[1:05:05] millimeters is but if we got a half a
[1:05:08] millimeter oh maybe let's go a little
[1:05:10] further we got to one
[1:05:13] 1,000 of an inch over God's requirement
[1:05:17] for the
[1:05:17] Rapture you know what our human nature
[1:05:19] would
[1:05:20] be I made it yeah I'll crawl in over the
[1:05:24] threshold
[1:05:26] but that's not what God's calling you
[1:05:28] and I to do he called us to be Sons and
[1:05:30] Daughters of God molded In His Image
[1:05:33] amen and he as a conqueror coming as a
[1:05:36] deliverer and bringing the word my
[1:05:38] brother and sister he said I didn't just
[1:05:39] bring enough word for them to make a
[1:05:41] Rapture I brought enough word to deliver
[1:05:43] them from every Affliction everything in
[1:05:46] life everything that could be a
[1:05:47] hindrance even if I declare them perfect
[1:05:50] I'm calling them
[1:05:51] higher amen we got to get rid of the
[1:05:53] idea that I'm just going to do enough to
[1:05:56] make a Rapture I want to do enough to
[1:05:57] fulfill God's desire in my life and in
[1:06:00] your life that God's desire will be
[1:06:02] fulfilled in us a word
[1:06:05] living amen you see if the Lord was
[1:06:09] afraid of the
[1:06:13] result in
[1:06:16] job he had never opened a hedge that's
[1:06:19] right if he was afraid of the result of
[1:06:21] the word in your
[1:06:23] life he would put a guard of Angels
[1:06:26] around you day and night not even let a
[1:06:29] single thought come to you
[1:06:34] right but he's got so much confidence in
[1:06:36] you and I that in this day Leo DEA 2024
[1:06:41] we never thought we would be here on the
[1:06:43] earth at this time and we're still here
[1:06:46] and it's not looking any better in the
[1:06:51] future and he's opening the Hedge
[1:06:56] I've got confidence in you you can do it
[1:07:00] amen why because you're my word in flesh
[1:07:05] that's it amen he no longer has to look
[1:07:08] back to Calvary my brother and sister
[1:07:10] he's not looking back to anything in the
[1:07:12] past not even before the foundation of
[1:07:14] the world because the deposit has
[1:07:16] already been made and the word has come
[1:07:18] to life and it's growing and it's
[1:07:20] growing and it's growing and God doesn't
[1:07:23] keep a low standard for you and I just
[1:07:24] so we can get and say well cuz I was
[1:07:26] bride to Christ I made it no you're
[1:07:28] going to make it because life that is in
[1:07:31] the word is living in you amen amen
[1:07:35] otherwise we would take that package of
[1:07:37] whatever and throw it out in the garden
[1:07:39] and say the seed is planted but my
[1:07:42] brother and sister God says I put it in
[1:07:43] the soil the correct soil and I will
[1:07:46] nurture that and give every nutrient
[1:07:48] does that mean that the wind won't blow
[1:07:50] no doesn't mean that it won't get cold
[1:07:52] at night no it doesn't mean that the
[1:07:54] little varmits won't Trum try and chew
[1:07:56] the leaves off of it no my brother and
[1:07:58] sister but he says my seed will produce
[1:08:01] it will produce of its own kind it will
[1:08:03] produce the word for this hour amen so
[1:08:09] God Amen opens a
[1:08:12] hedge I want to ask you a
[1:08:15] question was job more of a Believer than
[1:08:20] you come on Saints not to be a
[1:08:23] resounding no he was not more of a
[1:08:25] believer than I am because you see the
[1:08:28] word that was planted before the
[1:08:29] foundation of the world was God's word
[1:08:32] and God didn't say I'm going to you know
[1:08:34] let job be an overcomer and I'm going to
[1:08:36] make you struggle your whole life we
[1:08:38] don't know the whole story of job that's
[1:08:40] right we see what God chose to put in
[1:08:43] the book but if God wrote a second book
[1:08:46] of Acts this morning you would be
[1:08:47] shocked at what God is writing about you
[1:08:51] you would say is that really me I don't
[1:08:54] remember being like that I don't
[1:08:56] remember being that man but that's how
[1:08:59] God looked at it and says you know what
[1:09:01] this is who you are this is the second
[1:09:04] book of Acts being written over commerce
[1:09:07] facing every challenge standing on the
[1:09:09] word and having it counted as
[1:09:11] righteousness to you and we would say I
[1:09:14] don't know I don't recognize this person
[1:09:16] but you're looking through carnal eyes
[1:09:18] God's Looking Through The Eyes of the
[1:09:20] word Through the Ages and declaring who
[1:09:22] we are Hallelujah we get to this idea
[1:09:26] Enoch Superman job Superman amen Moses
[1:09:30] Superman Joshua Superman Caleb Superman
[1:09:33] they were men we got part of it right
[1:09:35] they were
[1:09:36] men but they believed the word and they
[1:09:39] took the word in and when they were weak
[1:09:42] the word made them strong amen not that
[1:09:45] they were Supermen but their grip their
[1:09:48] hold on the word is what made them who
[1:09:51] they were and you and I have that same
[1:09:53] ability to hold on to the word and not
[1:09:56] let go and say God said and I believe
[1:09:59] him amen
[1:10:02] hallelujah job not more of a Believer
[1:10:05] than you not more valuable to God than
[1:10:09] you look I'm not I'm not trying to Hype
[1:10:11] you this
[1:10:12] morning but I believe the old outage of
[1:10:16] saving the best for last is true amen oh
[1:10:19] we we sit here today man I'm a failure
[1:10:21] I'm a failure I did this I thought that
[1:10:23] I I looked at that I'm a failure I
[1:10:27] believe with all of my heart not to make
[1:10:28] a doctrine of this I don't mean to do
[1:10:30] that but I believe with all of my heart
[1:10:33] the reason you are here as a Believer
[1:10:36] today is God said I'm saving my Best For
[1:10:41] Last my sons my daughters are going to
[1:10:44] be Overcomers taking the word believing
[1:10:47] the word acting on the word they will be
[1:10:51] successful in this endeavor that I have
[1:10:54] placed them in
[1:10:56] and if you think any less of yourself
[1:10:58] what have you got to
[1:11:01] offer the prophet of God said when you
[1:11:04] speak those negative words you're
[1:11:06] talking the devil's
[1:11:08] language amen I'm not going to speak the
[1:11:10] devil's
[1:11:12] language I'm going to believe what God
[1:11:14] said about me see they were not more
[1:11:19] valuable they didn't have more value to
[1:11:22] God than you do and God come and rescued
[1:11:25] them from the spirit of their day the
[1:11:27] prophet of God said that this would be
[1:11:29] the most wicked age so of all the ages
[1:11:32] I've heard people say before Oh you know
[1:11:34] I think even as bad as the Coliseum and
[1:11:37] the Dark Ages were it might be better
[1:11:38] than this day my brother and sister if
[1:11:40] you can't overcome in this day you
[1:11:41] wouldn't have overcome in that day right
[1:11:44] and God didn't call you to go face a
[1:11:47] lion face to face he called you to face
[1:11:50] an
[1:11:51] innumerable Angels of Darkness
[1:11:54] wickedness in high
[1:11:57] places that's right I think a lion would
[1:12:00] have actually been pretty
[1:12:05] easy quite honestly right maybe we'd
[1:12:08] overcome the lion by saying hey lion
[1:12:11] Here I Am The Lion would have said whoa
[1:12:14] whoa whoa just a second now what are you
[1:12:20] doing but here we are
[1:12:22] today Lord let the Rapture come in the
[1:12:25] morning I don't think I can last another
[1:12:29] week wrong
[1:12:32] Spirit wrong Spirit
[1:12:35] Saints you see we got to come to the
[1:12:37] place that whether it's raining or
[1:12:40] shining it's hot or it's cold we're in
[1:12:43] the Coliseum of
[1:12:45] leoda or not that we can stand and say I
[1:12:49] know just like job come to my redeemer
[1:12:52] liveth amen and while the skin worms may
[1:12:56] eat this
[1:12:59] flesh I know who I am you see the
[1:13:03] problem is is we've set our sights so
[1:13:05] low that we no longer really honestly
[1:13:06] look in Heavenly
[1:13:08] places we're
[1:13:10] looking well so and so said and they did
[1:13:15] this and they did that and I don't know
[1:13:18] the song service was pretty flat I don't
[1:13:21] know if the song leader didn't study
[1:13:23] just randomly grabbed some songs or I I
[1:13:26] just don't
[1:13:28] know well I tell you imagine if God fed
[1:13:31] us naturally yeah with the hunger we
[1:13:35] have
[1:13:38] spiritually my we wouldn't need a diet
[1:13:43] program we'd come to
[1:13:46] church and we sit there and say pretty
[1:13:49] flat service we go home and open the
[1:13:51] fridge there's nothing
[1:13:53] there go to the restaurant and they'd
[1:13:55] say oh sorry here's your menu open it up
[1:14:00] water and
[1:14:02] crackers am I making
[1:14:05] sense God help
[1:14:07] us God help
[1:14:10] us see God's moving us into Perfection
[1:14:13] amen amen the Lord did not look at job
[1:14:18] in his flesh he said he was perfect but
[1:14:20] he wasn't looking at job and his flesh
[1:14:22] he was looking at him through the
[1:14:24] perfect word and the perfect word showed
[1:14:27] that job was a perfect man amen and the
[1:14:30] perfect word has come been delivered to
[1:14:32] you and I amen and this perfect word my
[1:14:35] brother and sister has come the price
[1:14:37] has been paid daily in other words the
[1:14:40] blood is still covering us every single
[1:14:43] day it wasn't a one-time event he's
[1:14:46] covering us and God's looking at us
[1:14:47] through the blood and we're standing
[1:14:49] here today I can't this and I can't that
[1:14:51] Lord asking you to do something I can't
[1:14:53] do that
[1:14:55] come on my brother and sister let's get
[1:14:57] into the right rhythm with the word and
[1:15:00] when we get in the right rhythm with the
[1:15:02] word we can see I can do all things
[1:15:04] through Christ Jesus amen that's not
[1:15:06] even just a spiritual thing but you want
[1:15:09] to go out here in the natural you have
[1:15:10] the right motive you have the right
[1:15:12] objective you want to start a business
[1:15:14] or do something and when we're
[1:15:15] approaching it correctly we should be
[1:15:17] able to stop and say you know what Lord
[1:15:19] you know my heart you know what I want
[1:15:21] to do now Lord I'm asking you with
[1:15:23] confidence with boldness bless it amen
[1:15:27] because I'm not asking that for my flesh
[1:15:30] as a Son of God I'm asking so the Lord
[1:15:33] looked at him through the perfect word
[1:15:34] at a finished
[1:15:36] work
[1:15:39] my had any fiery trials lately yes some
[1:15:43] of you didn't respond praise God you are
[1:15:46] living in
[1:15:49] Utopia but that's not the truth that's
[1:15:52] right have you asked for fiery Tri
[1:15:56] remember
[1:15:58] brother
[1:16:01] jeel praise God never pray for
[1:16:05] patience what did God do took brother
[1:16:08] juel through some of the most fiery
[1:16:10] trials a man can
[1:16:13] face what happened through all of that

[1:16:24] control amen amen amen he lifts me up
[1:16:27] amen he sets me down am he brings me in
[1:16:31] he sends me out blessed be the name of
[1:16:34] the Lord did Brother juel write that
[1:16:36] prescription I'll guarantee you not cuz
[1:16:39] I know Humanity we wouldn't write it he
[1:16:42] didn't write it but God said I know what
[1:16:44] I'm going to do amen bless our brother
[1:16:46] juwel amen because he truly as sons of
[1:16:49] God is a jewel amen so the fiery trials
[1:16:57] look what Satan put job
[1:17:02] through can I take the little switch on
[1:17:04] the
[1:17:05] recorder let's rewind what statement
[1:17:08] right here let's play it again look what
[1:17:12] Satan put job through I'm not playing
[1:17:16] games with you Saints no sir but it's a
[1:17:17] little bit of a misleading statement y
[1:17:20] let's rewind it
[1:17:23] again look what what Satan put job
[1:17:27] through who was the master of the Hedge
[1:17:30] that's it it wasn't
[1:17:33] Satan Satan never put job through that
[1:17:36] trial it was God who harness put the bit
[1:17:40] in Satan's mouth put the harness on him
[1:17:43] and said there's something in job's life
[1:17:45] that I want to burn out of job and so
[1:17:48] therefore job's going through this trial
[1:17:50] until he overcomes it and we'll cut it
[1:17:53] to the short my brother and sisters job
[1:17:55] actually had a little Spirit of Pride
[1:17:57] concerning his spiritual
[1:18:00] condition that's right and God
[1:18:03] says no no no no going to burn that out
[1:18:08] of you and I don't want to repr preach
[1:18:10] job here but my brother and sister God
[1:18:13] actually had to let the devil go to
[1:18:16] overtime and start working on job until
[1:18:19] job woke up one day after going through
[1:18:22] this fiery trial job woke up one one day
[1:18:25] and
[1:18:26] realized I'm not the Christian I thought
[1:18:30] I
[1:18:31] was cuz you know how I can make that
[1:18:33] statement that job would have said that
[1:18:36] because if we're not careful spiritual
[1:18:37] Pride will bring you and I to the place
[1:18:40] that we think we figured this Christian
[1:18:42] thing
[1:18:45] out and the minute God pulls his hand
[1:18:47] off of us y That's
[1:18:50] it right in the
[1:18:52] dust that's right
[1:18:57] Lord burn every drop of Pride out of
[1:19:00] us burn it out of us Lord that we won't
[1:19:02] think we have done a single thing the
[1:19:06] prophet of God you can look this up look
[1:19:08] at this my brother and sister under the
[1:19:10] search you'll find it human ability see
[1:19:13] what the prophet of God says about that
[1:19:15] there's not one human ability that we
[1:19:18] have amen we heard a lovely special
[1:19:20] today the music being played it blessed
[1:19:22] my heart my brother and sister but if we
[1:19:25] sit here and say look what I have we
[1:19:28] will fail but when we say thank you Lord
[1:19:30] for the gift that you placed in me amen
[1:19:34] it doesn't matter I'm not implying
[1:19:35] anything it doesn't matter if it hits
[1:19:37] every note correctly it's the anointing
[1:19:39] of the holy ghost that comes with those
[1:19:41] words because God is blessing it amen
[1:19:44] but when we think that we can do this in
[1:19:46] our own self we think we can be that
[1:19:48] kind and there was job coming dealing
[1:19:51] with his friends dealing with his wife
[1:19:53] dealing with all of this thinking no you
[1:19:55] guys don't understand I've done the word
[1:19:58] I've lived the word I've done this and
[1:20:00] God comes along and shows him job you've
[1:20:03] done nothing you've done nothing
[1:20:06] hallelujah what was he doing bringing
[1:20:09] him proving him into Perfection to come
[1:20:12] and realize my brother and sister I
[1:20:14] think we got a church full of jobes I
[1:20:16] apologize to all of you we got a church
[1:20:19] full of jobes if we're not careful we
[1:20:21] think we did something that's
[1:20:23] it my oh my amen it's God that did it
[1:20:27] that's it and let's surrender yield
[1:20:29] ourselves and let God do it again and
[1:20:32] again and again and again drawing us
[1:20:34] into Heavenly places into the Rapture of
[1:20:37] our soul my brother and sister let God
[1:20:40] bring us into the Rapture amen cuz as
[1:20:42] far as I know nobody can make the
[1:20:44] Rapture
[1:20:46] happen Christ working in his bride will
[1:20:48] bring a Rapture but we can't make a
[1:20:50] Rapture
[1:20:52] happen so he's dealing with it
[1:20:56] I'll go back and reiterate this job had
[1:20:58] a pretty high opinion of his spiritual
[1:21:00] walk and God said I don't like
[1:21:03] that no you're a perfect and upright man
[1:21:07] the problem is your own view of self
[1:21:11] that's right and God said I don't like
[1:21:14] that when you should be giving me the
[1:21:16] glory job you're taking it and I want
[1:21:19] you to rely and be completely dependent
[1:21:21] on me that's it that's it in other words
[1:21:24] I'll not give my
[1:21:26] glory to no man amen ouch that's right I
[1:21:32] tell you we can get pretty pretty high
[1:21:34] and mighty in our
[1:21:35] opinions
[1:21:38] amen you know job did really good early
[1:21:41] in the
[1:21:45] war but as it went on and his own
[1:21:47] friends and then his wife you know
[1:21:49] brothers let's let's be realistic with
[1:21:51] each other you can have somebody else's
[1:21:54] wife
[1:21:55] make that
[1:21:58] comment but when your wife makes that
[1:22:06] comment got a word to say about you
[1:22:10] too let me remind
[1:22:16] you and here's job finally comes to this
[1:22:19] place he's a little weary in the
[1:22:22] battle and he starts to assert
[1:22:26] what he has
[1:22:28] done not
[1:22:29] realizing without
[1:22:31] Christ he done
[1:22:34] nothing every goat out there was a gift
[1:22:37] from God every sheep out there was a
[1:22:39] gift from God every camel out there was
[1:22:41] a gift from
[1:22:42] God am every child a gift from
[1:22:52] God and the minute we start saying well
[1:22:54] I made this business plan and I did this
[1:22:57] and I invested there and I this and I
[1:23:00] did that and I outsmarted these guys and
[1:23:03] I I
[1:23:08] I
[1:23:13] right right oh and don't let me forget
[1:23:16] and I made the Rapture yeah really what
[1:23:20] a
[1:23:22] fallacy what God is
[1:23:25] doing he's proving
[1:23:28] us that by his
[1:23:30] grace I overcome
[1:23:33] amen amen see had a little tarnish in
[1:23:36] there is just this little spot if I
[1:23:38] could if I could project it if you guys
[1:23:40] can see this little spot that's hovering
[1:23:42] above my finger can you see that
[1:23:44] spot it's right there above my
[1:23:47] finger that's how small that spot in
[1:23:51] job's heart was no man's is ever going
[1:23:54] to see it did any of you see
[1:23:57] it no man can see it that's right but
[1:24:00] God saw it amen and God said I've called
[1:24:03] you
[1:24:04] Perfection not a man's idea of
[1:24:06] perfection no sir but to be perfect in
[1:24:10] my eyes that's it and God says I see
[1:24:13] this little thing in you
[1:24:15] job so no problem job I love you you're
[1:24:18] perfect but he hasn't told job this
[1:24:21] yet right job don't know it yeah he
[1:24:24] doesn't know God's opinion of him is
[1:24:26] that he's
[1:24:29] perfect and then God says figuratively
[1:24:33] here back in the
[1:24:35] fire we're going to burn that one out of
[1:24:38] you
[1:24:38] also now come can we be just friends
[1:24:41] this morning
[1:24:44] y wonder how many little
[1:24:49] spots that we can't even see that's it
[1:24:53] that's right
[1:24:54] and God's saying back in the fire that's
[1:24:58] it another fiery trial why me Lord I'm
[1:25:01] trying to live for you
[1:25:03] amen it's not about this flesh no sir
[1:25:07] and he's back in the fire that's right

[1:25:33] pyite and still has some iron in it and
[1:25:35] it has silicon and all these other
[1:25:38] things in it you can buy that ring for
[1:25:39] 50 bucks that'd be half the men in
[1:25:42] America like oh I'll buy a ring for my
[1:25:44] wife pawn shop wouldn't even take

[1:26:09] like honey I'd be so proud to wear
[1:26:13] this now if she has the wrong attitude
[1:26:16] and it's all about dollar signs
[1:26:19] amen look sister Gabriella when you get
[1:26:22] married hold out for the real
[1:26:27] thing cuz the men tend to be like for
[1:26:31] what that ring cost I could buy three
[1:26:33] guns a four-wheeler and a pickup to put
[1:26:36] it
[1:26:39] in but see God's not going to settle for
[1:26:42] iron pyite and this
[1:26:45] whatever right he says I'm going to take
[1:26:48] you from that position how does he do
[1:26:50] that there's gold in
[1:26:52] there he throws it in the fiery trial
[1:26:56] pulls it out getting better throws it in
[1:26:59] a fiery trial getting better throws it
[1:27:02] in a fiery trial getting better throws
[1:27:05] it in a fiery trial getting better now I
[1:27:07] want to ask you you judge yourself where
[1:27:10] are you at on this right where are you
[1:27:12] are you satisfied to be right in
[1:27:15] here
[1:27:18] no we want the real thing amen
[1:27:23] hallelujah a little confession to
[1:27:26] make when Jerry and I got married I
[1:27:28] bought her a cubic
[1:27:31] zirconium don't snort like that sister
[1:27:36] Sue and it offered an excuse I can't
[1:27:40] afford the ring that she wanted I can't
[1:27:42] afford that but we were just walking
[1:27:44] through a place one day and there was
[1:27:46] Rings there and I'm looking at rings and
[1:27:48] and and you know that ring they wanted a
[1:27:49] couple thousand dollar for it you know
[1:27:51] back in the early ' 80s and and now I'm
[1:27:53] looking and I'm like oh that ring looks
[1:27:55] just about what like Jerry really liked
[1:27:57] way back when it was like
[1:28:00] 21,000 I was like man that was an
[1:28:02] expensive back then that was like an
[1:28:06] investment and you see that's what God's
[1:28:08] doing he's not trying to fill Heaven
[1:28:10] full of immature Christians no that's
[1:28:14] right he says I want only the best
[1:28:17] that's right and so he keeps putting us
[1:28:20] in the fire putting us in the fire and
[1:28:22] about this stage right here I'm sorry to
[1:28:25] say Saints we start whining like
[1:28:29] job come on don't lift no hands but I
[1:28:32] want you to confess in your heart I've
[1:28:34] whined about what God's allowing to
[1:28:37] happen in my life I've whined about it
[1:28:40] what we should be saying is Lord just
[1:28:42] give me the patience give me the
[1:28:44] patience if I need to go through the
[1:28:46] fire again Lord let me go through the
[1:28:48] fire father I don't want to come to you
[1:28:51] as an
[1:28:52] impure person but to come to you as a
[1:28:55] perfect Son of God if I have to go
[1:28:58] through the fire again Lord just give me
[1:29:00] strength to go through the fire again
[1:29:04] because you see my brother and sister
[1:29:05] there's only a few words that really
[1:29:07] matter at that stage of the
[1:29:10] game no they're not going to be like the
[1:29:12] words coaches use to motivate people
[1:29:14] it's going to be those simple words well
[1:29:17] done my good and faithful servant amen
[1:29:21] those are going to be the only words
[1:29:22] that matter amen won't matter how many
[1:29:25] so to speak trophies we have the square
[1:29:27] footage of our house how much money is
[1:29:30] in the bank if we don't hear those words
[1:29:33] all of this is wasted all of
[1:29:37] this
[1:29:40] amen okay I have 30 seconds
[1:29:45] left you see I'm want to hit this again
[1:29:49] it just stands out off the page at
[1:29:51] me we have attitudes
[1:29:54] this
[1:29:55] tarnish little attitude now I'm not
[1:29:58] preaching to you guys I'm preaching to
[1:30:00] somebody
[1:30:01] else but we have a little
[1:30:04] attitude we still have
[1:30:08] impatience we still have a bit of
[1:30:10] spiritual
[1:30:15] pride no problem God's going to come and
[1:30:18] write you an
[1:30:19] excuse right God's got his notebook
[1:30:24] figuratively here I'm not picking on
[1:30:26] brother

[1:30:54] of Christ we are being tested amen into
[1:31:00] Perfection and don't think it's a man's
[1:31:02] Perfection I listened to a man preaching
[1:31:04] here recently just a little clip message
[1:31:06] man and he was like God has made us
[1:31:09] perfect but he was talking from a carnal
[1:31:13] realm I'm sorry I stand before you if
[1:31:16] Sister Jerry was here this morning I'm
[1:31:18] sure she would say

[1:31:39] Grandpa are you
[1:31:45] hangry I
[1:31:47] am we could
[1:31:50] tell don't look for some Perfection
[1:31:53] there

[1:31:55] word take us through the fire
[1:31:58] again let the word change
[1:32:01] us don't offer an
[1:32:07] excuse offer
[1:32:09] yourself you see I might have mentioned
[1:32:12] this in church before I don't remember
[1:32:14] where I've spoken this but you see my
[1:32:18] brother and sister if we're not careful
[1:32:20] we're going to use the word to justify
[1:32:22] ourselves instead of using the word to
[1:32:25] purify
[1:32:27] ourselves the word's not here to justify
[1:32:30] us oh we will be justified yeah but the
[1:32:34] word's not here to justify us it's here
[1:32:37] to purify us I can say from my heart
[1:32:41] this morning Lord let that refining Fire
[1:32:43] come no I don't want fiery trials I want
[1:32:46] my my heavenly father to be like
[1:32:48] grandfather to me but I also know by the
[1:32:51] word that I can't get in
[1:32:54] on a grandfather's
[1:32:56] love I get in on my father's love which
[1:33:00] is the word and when I get into that
[1:33:04] position we hear those beautiful words
[1:33:07] well done musicians would you come heyen
[1:33:12] you know when I was a little
[1:33:15] kid my mama used to tell me this all the
[1:33:19] time
[1:33:21] Paul your eyes are bigger than your
[1:33:26] stomach and obviously that transfers
[1:33:28] down to
[1:33:30] notes they're greater than the time that
[1:33:32] we
[1:33:33] have I believe I've shared this quote
[1:33:36] with you before God's only provided
[1:33:37] place of
[1:33:39] worship we could just look at it real
[1:33:42] careful think about it Amazing Grace how
[1:33:45] sweet this sound see just no way of ever
[1:33:49] explaining what it is just take my word
[1:33:51] if you believe me
[1:33:54] be sure to make or burn every bridge of
[1:33:56] the world behind you and I believe the
[1:33:58] church is beginning to hear the message
[1:34:01] look at this date that's right
[1:34:04] 11:28 of
[1:34:07] 65 and a prophet makes a statement I
[1:34:10] just believe they're
[1:34:12] beginning to see that's
[1:34:15] right where has our vision went from
[1:34:17] that time it should have already come
[1:34:21] into maturity I
[1:34:22] believe but Paul's still here and maybe
[1:34:26] I'm the one hindering the Rapture but I
[1:34:28] would speak with confidence to tell you
[1:34:30] I was called to that Rapture and so God
[1:34:33] will keep on running me through the
[1:34:36] fire amen until I come out as pure gold
[1:34:41] amen nothing to boast about there right
[1:34:44] yeah imagine we get to heaven I'm sorry
[1:34:47] to put a little humor to this brother
[1:34:49] Phillip imagine we get to heaven what's
[1:34:51] your number brother Phillip
[1:34:54] what do you mean brother Paul how many
[1:34:55] times did he run you through the
[1:34:57] fire oh oh I remember they gave me a
[1:35:00] slip
[1:35:02] of
[1:35:04] 49,8
[1:35:07] 62 brother Philip pulls his out and goes
[1:35:10] I must not have been as hard-headed as
[1:35:11] you I'm only
[1:35:14] 41,000 no that's not how God works my
[1:35:17] brother and sister but you see he's
[1:35:19] going to run us through the fire and
[1:35:22] prove us into
[1:35:25] Perfection amen where he can take
[1:35:28] that and he can run it through the word
[1:35:32] that's and
[1:35:34] say I'll pick on you brother
[1:35:36] Phillip my servant Phillip have you
[1:35:39] considered
[1:35:41] him because he's a perfect and upright
[1:35:44] man and God says one more time I see
[1:35:48] something Beyond
[1:35:50] Perfection are you with me Beyond
[1:35:54] Perfection I'll just run him through the
[1:35:56] fire one more time burn today's draw out
[1:36:00] of him right Hallelujah I say thank you
[1:36:03] Lord that's how much he loves you and I
[1:36:06] Prophet says burn every bridge of the
[1:36:08] World Behind you I believe the church is
[1:36:10] beginning to hear the message and
[1:36:12] beginning to understand but friends
[1:36:14] listen we've got to lay in the presence
[1:36:16] of the son we've got to be ripened
[1:36:20] right I'm just going to throw a little
[1:36:22] little curve ball to
[1:36:25] you what if all that God desired he
[1:36:28] needed to do in your life was already
[1:36:31] done now he's just laying us out in the
[1:36:33] presence of the
[1:36:34] Sun and letting us be ripened it I
[1:36:38] believe all the word can we lift our
[1:36:40] hand and say amen I believe all the word
[1:36:42] amen amen I believe the supernatural I
[1:36:45] believe these things I have the evidence
[1:36:46] I've seen it and I've had it in my life
[1:36:48] I believe all of it was then what's more
[1:36:50] what's more some are over here trying to
[1:36:52] repeat an experience from past ages some
[1:36:56] are over here going intellectual and God
[1:36:59] says no no no if you really understand
[1:37:01] the message I'm just laying you in the
[1:37:03] presence of the son amen I'm not
[1:37:05] speaking ill of it I believe in all of
[1:37:07] those gifts but my brother and sister we
[1:37:09] have this whole thing creeping in slow
[1:37:11] but sure if we're not screaming and
[1:37:12] running around the church we're not
[1:37:14] doing all of these things then we don't
[1:37:16] have it and this is a sign my brother
[1:37:18] and sister I'm going to throw something
[1:37:21] out if I'm wrong correct me
[1:37:25] maybe if the greatest challenge God's
[1:37:26] placing in our lives right at this
[1:37:31] moment stand still that's right and know
[1:37:35] that I am
[1:37:37] God what if that is a greatest challenge
[1:37:40] God has for our life today we've said
[1:37:44] I'm speaking to Believers we've said
[1:37:46] amen to every word there's not one thing
[1:37:49] that we have not believed and not held
[1:37:52] on to and it's and maybe God just wants
[1:37:54] you to stand in the presence of the Sun
[1:37:57] and just let the last bit of it be baked
[1:38:01] out just letting the word come in settle
[1:38:04] in our hearts and what are we
[1:38:08] doing now I'm speaking this in general
[1:38:10] terms please
[1:38:11] don't we didn't even know we still had
[1:38:14] that Speck of
[1:38:16] impatience Lord you need to Rapture us
[1:38:20] this world is wicked I want out of here
[1:38:22] Lord Rapture needs to
[1:38:24] come now we're telling the creator of
[1:38:26] Heaven and
[1:38:28] Earth that his timetable is
[1:38:32] wrong h no problem though let's just
[1:38:36] take another
[1:38:38] trip back through the fire amen amen
[1:38:42] God's not over there saying scratching
[1:38:44] your name off the list no no one more
[1:38:47] trip amen amen come out of the fire back
[1:38:51] in the fire out of the fire back in the
[1:38:54] fire and we're over here going Lord

[1:39:52] see that hesitation didn't really want
[1:39:54] to shake my hand I'm
[1:39:58] offended then the Holy Spirit deals with
[1:40:01] me and
[1:40:03] says you need to go apologize to
[1:40:10] him amen have we been there yes might be
[1:40:14] husband and wife might be parents to

[1:40:23] yes sir amen and you know if we'd do
[1:40:26] that right now and I would just come

[1:40:56] [Music]
[1:40:58] away if God asked
[1:41:01] you to repent and you don't
[1:41:05] repent it falls away but did it go
[1:41:11] away and we forget about it and God
[1:41:14] comes and says I want to start I want to
[1:41:16] burn this out of your life

[1:41:38] from his friends that's
[1:41:41] right
[1:41:42] amen I'm afraid Saints if you put Paul
[1:41:45] under examination

[1:41:57] yourself God's proving us to
[1:42:01] Perfection let us listen to the Holy
[1:42:06] Spirit let's be the

[1:42:26] hearing the message God has give us
[1:42:29] we're seeing the signs he showed us
[1:42:30] proving it by the Bible it's there but
[1:42:33] oh how the church needs to lay in his
[1:42:36] presence till it do you think brother

[1:46:45] comment
[1:46:47] imagine if when we saw an imperfection
[1:46:49] in our
[1:46:51] life maybe a
[1:46:55] response you see my
[1:47:00] brother had no
[1:47:02] reason the
[1:47:04] hesitation you know where the hesitation
[1:47:07] was
[1:47:07] [Music]
[1:47:12] at I've now
[1:47:15] created
[1:47:16] something the brother would say brother
[1:47:19] Paul I no I didn't do that
[1:47:24] and now when we recognize this imagine
[1:47:27] in our daily
[1:47:28] life we recognize that the devil's
[1:47:31] coming trying to put a wedge between me
[1:47:33] and my
[1:47:35] brother if we'd lift a hand to lift a
[1:47:38] heart and say Lord I think I need to go
[1:47:40] back to the
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:47:44] fire just take me back
[1:47:47] Lord that Refiner's Fire let it Purify
[1:47:51] Me you know all all the fussing and all
[1:47:53] the struggles that we have in that realm
[1:47:56] would all
[1:47:57] disappear if we were just volunteer amen
[1:48:02] God didn't have to grab us and drag us
[1:48:04] Kicking and
[1:48:05] Screaming if we would come to the place
[1:48:07] in our own life
[1:48:10] yeah our own
[1:48:15] life excuse me I've got to go jump in
[1:48:19] the fire the world's not going to know
[1:48:21] what you're talking about Sun Sons and
[1:48:23] Daughters of God would say I'll just
[1:48:25] join
[1:48:26] you I'll just join you and then maybe
[1:48:29] when one or two in the church would get
[1:48:31] that way it would be contagious and it'd
[1:48:33] be three and four then it' be 5 and six
[1:48:36] and then it would be well we got to
[1:48:39] leave some kind of drama here maybe it
[1:48:41] would be this side the church would all
[1:48:43] jump in the fire and I don't know about
[1:48:46] that
[1:48:48] son but what if we were
[1:48:51] here why don't all of us
[1:48:54] amen Grace Tabernacle why don't we amen
[1:48:57] just step into the fire Amen Let the
[1:49:00] Lord purify us not holding on to the
[1:49:03] past and not holding on to our opinions
[1:49:06] and our emotions and what Lord I just
[1:49:09] ask you today this is not an alter call
[1:49:11] but I just ask you today could we just

[1:49:55] foundation of the world if we deny that
[1:49:58] calling we're telling God he's wrong
[1:50:03] that's right the last thing I want to do
