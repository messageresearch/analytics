[39:18] our strength and and the you know Joshua
[39:21] positionally placed Israel in the land
[39:23] and uh brother says Ephesians parallels
[39:27] Joshua so Ephesians places us in our
[39:30] position and we read you know we know
[39:32] Ephesians 5 and how it lays out the
[39:34] family and the order and different
[39:35] things and so as Believers our desire
[39:38] then should be the the top of the of the
[39:41] list should be what is our position and
[39:43] and we we can say uh you know what is
[39:46] God's will for our life we can say what
[39:48] is what is the job I'm going to take all
[39:50] of these things and they all fall
[39:51] underneath the umbrella of our position
[39:53] and where where do God where does God
[39:55] want us to go to church and and what
[39:57] does God say in his word where we should
[40:00] be and so there's a bit of a Baseline
[40:05] there's a bit of a baseline on
[40:08] um
[40:10] where where we start from so anytime you
[40:12] have anything that you desire to do you
[40:14] know the best place to start is okay is
[40:17] it is it is it God's is it in God's word
[40:20] now we know if you're going to move
[40:22] somewhere the first thing you check is
[40:24] is there a church that preaches the word
[40:27] of God that's a baseline that should be
[40:30] a desire
[40:31] and so there's different things where we
[40:33] start with right and there's a baseline
[40:35] on our positions and you know a man is a
[40:37] man and a woman is a woman and that kind
[40:39] of thing and and so we start there and
[40:41] God designed that that that sex should
[40:43] be in marriage not outside of marriage
[40:46] so there's all of these things these
[40:47] baselines that that are in the scripture
[40:49] that we build our life from and then
[40:51] each and every detail in that well
[40:54] that's comes to you and that is from God
[40:56] but it can't deviate from the word of
[40:58] God so just to highlight a couple of the
[41:01] scriptures here I really liked this um
[41:03] verse here it just kind of popped out to
[41:06] me it says what my son what the son of
[41:08] my you know proverbs 31 is known as the
[41:10] the the Proverbs or the chapter for
[41:12] women but it starts off with the
[41:14] instruction it's actually it's 20 to to
[41:18] her son
[41:19] the prophecy of his mother lemuel's
[41:22] mother is telling him this so so he
[41:24] knows what to look for in a woman
[41:27] and and so she says my son you know he
[41:30] she says give not thy strength unto
[41:31] women nor thy ways to that which
[41:33] destroyeth Kings and so I went and I and
[41:35] I got the Amplified
[41:37] um version I don't know if everyone
[41:39] knows about the Amplified Bible it just
[41:40] kind of takes it and uh in square
[41:43] brackets and different things it'll
[41:44] it'll put in
[41:45] um
[41:46] the more of a deeper look into the
[41:49] meanings of the words and different
[41:50] things so in the Amplified version it
[41:52] says give them not your strength to
[41:53] loose women nor your ways to those who
[41:56] who and that which ruin and Destroy
[41:58] Kings so in other words don't you have a
[42:01] strength God's given you a strength as a
[42:03] man and and don't just don't give that
[42:06] out that's for your why okay we can
[42:08] start there with virtue and living
[42:10] virtuous and moral but at the same time
[42:12] you're called to your position and what
[42:15] what this what I take from this
[42:18] um scripture is and you can look up in
[42:19] Strong's Concordance as well strengthen
[42:21] strength and you can find the different
[42:23] places it was used in the same
[42:25] occurrences that strong strongs has that
[42:27] option that and it's same thing as
[42:30] Mighty Men of Valor and all these things
[42:31] so so it really what she's telling him
[42:33] is first of all be moral and that is
[42:36] your position that's a very basic thing
[42:38] as a man be moral and but to build on
[42:42] top of that strength is your position so
[42:44] he's he's telling her
[42:46] she's telling him son your strength is
[42:50] your position don't just don't give it
[42:52] away don't do go into things that were
[42:54] destroyed Kings and kingdoms and so I
[42:57] wanted to also pull in here uh in verse
[43:00] 17 says she girdeth her loins with
[43:02] strength and strengtheneth her arms and
[43:04] I wanted to pull the Amplified of this
[43:06] one as well so she girds herself with
[43:09] strength spiritual mental and physical
[43:11] fitness for her god-given task and makes
[43:14] her arms strong and firm in other words
[43:16] there's nothing lazy about this woman
[43:19] there is nothing there is no couch
[43:21] potato in her
[43:23] if you will and and I and I just want to
[43:25] notate on this um well let's go to the
[43:28] next one so
[43:29] physical fitness for god-given tax I
[43:31] thought that was very interesting how
[43:32] they put that in there and it makes
[43:34] sense you know if you're if you're
[43:36] healthy and you're and and you're taking
[43:37] care of yourself you're going to give
[43:39] you you're going to put more into your
[43:40] god-given task you know God has called
[43:42] us and I'll just put this here now
[43:44] because the next scripture will fall
[43:45] right in line with that many of you know
[43:47] that I'm I'm I I enjoy Fitness and um
[43:50] I have I I stay my my let me put this in
[43:54] my goal is not to to have you know the
[43:57] the beach bot or have the I'm not that
[43:59] we go to the beach but have the you know
[44:01] Mr Olympia that's not my goal that's
[44:03] that kind of goal is Vanity and it won't
[44:05] get you very far my goal is is as I just
[44:08] said we were gone for a week and it was
[44:10] long hours of travel it was late nights
[44:13] it was preaching it was all these things
[44:14] and and if I keep myself healthy and in
[44:17] the fitness I could give my god-given
[44:19] task to the best of my ability but if
[44:21] I'm not taking care of myself that then
[44:24] what am I giving to God because God has
[44:26] called this whole thing to his service
[44:29] and um
[44:31] same thing for for not just for the men
[44:33] so now the the young men
[44:38] we're all younger than somebody so
[44:40] everyone hears young men in a similar
[44:42] way
[44:43] urge so this is the Amplified version of
[44:45] Titus 2 verse six to eight you can go
[44:47] and read the the regular version if you
[44:48] want to but it says in a similar way
[44:51] urge the younger men to be
[44:52] self-restrained and to behave prudently
[44:54] and this really goes uh in tonight to
[44:57] what we're going to to talk about I just
[44:59] wanted to kind of lay a foundation again
[45:00] and bring our our Focus back to this
[45:03] because it's been a couple of weeks but
[45:05] um having behaved prudently taking life
[45:07] seriously
[45:10] um in in the in the world that we live
[45:12] in today everything's a joke and and if
[45:14] we're not careful
[45:16] we we let that joking around which is
[45:18] nothing wrong with that but if we're not
[45:20] careful we let that cross over and now
[45:22] we don't take life seriously you know
[45:23] you don't wear your suit to church
[45:25] young guys you should all have a suit
[45:28] now this is a personal opinion okay my
[45:29] wife was very reminded me that hey don't
[45:32] you know watch your personal opinion
[45:34] she's right I appreciate that
[45:37] but that's my personal opinion we're the
[45:39] best of church okay so taking life
[45:41] seriously so you go to a job interview
[45:42] you're going to dress your best you're
[45:44] going to put your effort into your
[45:45] resume and you're going to be respectful
[45:47] to society and the people around you
[45:48] into the community the community that
[45:50] you're in so taking life seriously and
[45:52] says and show your own self in all
[45:54] respects to be a pattern and a model of
[45:57] good deeds and words teaching what is
[46:00] unadulterated showing gravity having the
[46:03] strictest regard now this is what I
[46:04] really like having the strictest regard
[46:07] for truth and purity of motive now I
[46:11] don't want the young people here tonight
[46:12] remember when we took we took a youth
[46:14] meeting on but is it honorable and
[46:17] there's certain things that might be
[46:19] okay it might not be against the word of
[46:21] God but sometimes you have to look
[46:23] deeper and say yes but is it an
[46:26] honorable thing to do
[46:27] there are certain things that are not
[46:29] honorable
[46:30] and if you live life save your life
[46:33] seriously and you have desire to be you
[46:35] know should disregard for truth and
[46:37] purity of motive what is your motive and
[46:39] objective okay so with dignity and
[46:42] seriousness seriousness again nothing
[46:44] wrong with with taking life serious I
[46:46] think it's important and I think in the
[46:48] society like I said today we do
[46:50] we do have enough reverence and let your
[46:53] instruction be sound and fit and wise
[46:55] and wholesome so when you give somebody
[46:57] instruction don't just give it on a whim
[47:00] it make sure it's sound and fit and wise
[47:03] and wholesome now tell me is there
[47:04] anything outside of the word of God
[47:06] that doesn't fit this the best
[47:08] the word of God fits this description
[47:10] the best
[47:12] so whatever doctrines you have whatever
[47:13] ideas you have whatever uh views you
[47:16] have politically whether it be whatever
[47:18] it would be make sure it's lots of with
[47:20] the word of God and its sound fit wise
[47:22] and wholesome because you don't ever we
[47:25] you underestimate especially as a man
[47:27] you underestimate the uh influence you
[47:30] have on somebody who looks up to you
[47:32] they might not be younger than you they
[47:35] might be your period but they look up to
[47:36] you you underestimate the ability you
[47:39] have and what they do and what they take
[47:41] with what you've said
[47:42] so make sure you take it serious so your
[47:46] instruction be sound fit wise wholesome
[47:48] vigorous irrefutable and above sensor so
[47:51] that the opponent may not put maybe put
[47:53] to shame finding nothing discrediting or
[47:56] evil to say about us us not you us as a
[48:01] whole how are you conducting yourself
[48:02] outside of the walls inside of your
[48:04] family outside of the church amen so
[48:09] all of that being said and that that
[48:11] positions kind of laid out there again I
[48:14] would like to take tonight and talk and
[48:16] the balanced home about home economics
[48:19] now this is a very large subject
[48:22] so maybe if Lord Wills will take a few
[48:26] services on it but I want to start
[48:29] and and to look at this and we've kind
[48:32] of talked about the man and husband and
[48:33] the mother and the wife and all those
[48:36] things and
[48:37] and uh we haven't got to the the kids
[48:39] yet we're coming for you
[48:43] um but
[48:44] I was feeling LED you know just really
[48:45] thinking lately about about stewardship
[48:47] and and how that that um
[48:51] economics is not just money
[48:54] it's it's the whole ecosystem of the
[48:57] home
[48:58] outside of
[49:00] certain things
[49:02] you know it's how you you know did you
[49:04] paint the wall that needs to be painted
[49:06] did you fix the patch you know stuff
[49:08] like that not always you know we joke of
[49:10] the honey to do this but really it's not
[49:12] it's it's taking care of what God's God
[49:15] has blessed you with so I was thinking
[49:17] about this and and and being good
[49:19] stewards and I thought what we are we
[49:21] are ambassadors of God
[49:25] so let me put it this way very simply
[49:28] for you if you're an ambassador for the
[49:30] United States and you are over in China
[49:34] or
[49:35] um Japan or you know the Middle East
[49:38] wherever you are if you do something
[49:41] that brings shame on America if you do
[49:44] something that comes against the laws
[49:47] you
[49:49] are not if you just act any way you
[49:53] won't be an ambassador
[49:55] but as an ambassador you want you
[49:57] understand that in this country
[49:59] I am viewed as the United States
[50:03] so in this world that we live in today
[50:05] you are viewed as Christ
[50:09] so you want people to be attracted to
[50:12] God
[50:14] you want to be honey
[50:16] salty right you want to make them
[50:19] thirsty
[50:20] so you have to be an ambassador for God
[50:24] now there's a fine line on this but if
[50:27] you're taking care of your family and
[50:29] your home
[50:30] God says he'll take care of us now does
[50:34] God want us to look like
[50:37] well
[50:39] I'm not going to go there so we want to
[50:42] have good economics so
[50:43] all that being said Luke chapter 12
[50:45] verse 13. now I will tell you this
[50:52] um
[50:52] I don't know at all
[50:54] surprise
[50:57] um you know last time I spoke I
[51:00] mentioned something about you know well
[51:01] if you're a girl and you're you know
[51:03] you're 25 and you can look for a career
[51:04] and I'm sorry I didn't mean to put an
[51:06] age to it
[51:08] so I thank you for your patience and for
[51:11] taking this journey with me because I'm
[51:13] learning it right alongside of you and
[51:15] so
[51:17] my desire is to stick with the word that
[51:19] way you don't get brother Chris you get
[51:22] Christ okay
[51:24] so
[51:26] if you have this if you find a
[51:27] discrepancy in the word and you want to
[51:29] bring the word and you want to talk
[51:31] please that would be great
[51:33] Luke 12 chapter verse 13.
[51:38] um you know there's been many times
[51:39] where where in in this series that we've
[51:41] been ministering on there's been many
[51:42] times where you know at home like okay
[51:44] you know I'm preaching this
[51:45] I want this to be in my home and I've
[51:48] gone and I've sat down and just flipped
[51:50] Through the Bible Lord give me something
[51:52] to help me right now
[51:54] and so that's my desire and in Luke
[51:56] chapter 12 verse 13 Jesus is speaking to
[51:59] to a group of people and um
[52:04] and then an innumerable multitude the
[52:07] Bible says so you couldn't count them
[52:09] and he's preaching to them and he comes
[52:12] to this part in his sermon and he says
[52:13] in verse 13 and and um one of these
[52:16] somebody speaks up from the from the
[52:18] audience and says Master speak excuse me
[52:20] speak to my brother that he divide the
[52:22] inheritance with me
[52:24] you know it's like it's like that
[52:25] questions and answers where somebody
[52:27] asks a question that they know the
[52:28] answer to but they're trying to get
[52:29] somebody else
[52:36] and he said unto him man
[52:38] who made a judge who made me a judge or
[52:41] a divider over you
[52:43] I like to think he said it like man
[52:46] and he said to them take heed and beware
[52:49] of covetousness so okay so here's the
[52:51] thing that I really like about the word
[52:53] of God God doesn't always tell us see
[52:56] this this this person asked him said
[52:58] Master speak to my brother he divide
[53:00] inheritance in other words tell him how
[53:02] to split our inheritance
[53:05] and he says I'm not going to do that
[53:07] but I'm going to tell you what you need
[53:09] to know to split the inheritance
[53:11] yourself
[53:13] the best thing that I can do when I
[53:15] Mentor somebody
[53:16] in the in the secular in my in the
[53:18] business world the best thing that I can
[53:20] do is I can teach them
[53:22] how to do it themselves instead of
[53:25] telling them every little detail because
[53:27] there's a lot of details in what I do
[53:29] for a living tell them every detail I
[53:31] teach them the concept then they take
[53:33] the concept and they go and apply it to
[53:36] their daily tasks
[53:38] so God teaches us the concept
[53:41] there are certain things that we just
[53:42] know that's not right because God has
[53:45] taught us the concept
[53:46] see well there's no scripture for this
[53:48] over here there's no scripture for this
[53:50] over here it says well yeah but what's
[53:52] the content in other words what's the
[53:54] heart of God that's what he gives to us
[53:57] he gives us a new spirit he gives us
[53:59] himself
[54:02] so that we understand the concept and we
[54:05] apply those to the nuances and the
[54:07] details of our daily life so he's this
[54:09] is what he says he doesn't tell him how
[54:10] to do it but he says here's some advice
[54:13] take heed and beware of covetousness for
[54:16] a man's life consisteth not in the
[54:18] abundance of the things which he
[54:21] possesses
[54:24] now
[54:26] be careful right this is uh I wish I
[54:29] could just jump really quickly to the
[54:30] first screen this is the balanced home
[54:34] so everything's balanced okay now some
[54:37] people can take this so far
[54:40] um and they're just living
[54:42] um
[54:43] with poor economics
[54:45] they went too far
[54:47] everything in balance and he speak a
[54:49] parable unto them saying the ground of a
[54:52] certain rich man brought forth
[54:53] plentifully so he gives his text
[54:56] his subject and then he gives an example
[54:58] and he thought within himself saying
[55:00] what shall I do because I have no room
[55:02] where to bestow my fruits and he said
[55:04] this will I do I will pull down my Barns
[55:07] and build greater and there will I
[55:09] bestow all my fruits and my goods and I
[55:12] will say to my soul soul thou Hast much
[55:15] good laid up for many years take thine
[55:18] ease eat drink and be merry
[55:21] pretty much retirement okay but God said
[55:24] unto him thou fool this night thy Soul
[55:27] shall be required of Thee
[55:31] then whose shall those things be
[55:35] which thou Hast provided
[55:37] so
[55:38] in plain Modern English
[55:41] you fool you're gonna die tonight and
[55:45] all that you worked for
[55:46] now who's it does it belong to because
[55:49] it's not going to do you any good
[55:52] so if we're not careful we run with that
[55:54] and we say well yep you can't be rich
[55:56] can't have money
[55:58] you know in a second
[56:01] so is he that layeth up Treasures for
[56:03] himself verse 21 and is not rich toward
[56:06] God
[56:08] the Bible doesn't say money is evil the
[56:11] Bible says the love of money is evil
[56:14] when the Bible says you can't serve two
[56:16] masters you have to serve either God or
[56:18] Mammon when you're serving Mammon in
[56:20] other words all you care about is the
[56:22] next dollar
[56:24] we should all be motivated to make money
[56:27] for our households
[56:30] guess what
[56:31] that's how the world Works Cold Hard
[56:34] Cash
[56:35] well cold hard plastic sometimes
[56:38] that's how the world runs that is
[56:40] economics
[56:42] so we want to run our home as good
[56:44] stewards and so I we can't read the
[56:47] whole chapter so I pulled a few verses
[56:49] from this and just a touch back again on
[56:52] this one we just read and he said unto
[56:54] them take heed and beware of
[56:55] covetousness for a man's life consists
[56:57] not in the abundance of the things which
[57:00] he possessive so a couple of things
[57:03] first point
[57:06] don't be jealous
[57:07] of some other somebody else's blessing
[57:12] second thing
[57:14] life is not about what you own
[57:19] so
[57:20] we've all been there where we just knew
[57:23] we were going to have that new thing and
[57:24] it was going to be the best thing and
[57:26] then we got it
[57:27] and then some time went on and
[57:30] now we could live without it
[57:33] so it's also how much stuff you can get
[57:38] second third point
[57:41] don't put all your focus
[57:43] into building your bigger Barns and
[57:45] neglect your soul
[57:49] don't put all your focus into providing
[57:51] money for your family and neglect your
[57:54] family
[57:55] everything in balance
[58:00] fourth point if you lay up Treasures for
[58:03] yourself
[58:04] you find yourself lacking in Treasures
[58:07] of God
[58:10] so if you spend all your time putting
[58:13] Treasures to yourself you're not rich
[58:15] toward God
[58:18] so
[58:21] now in verse 21
[58:23] is the point here pull out here
[58:26] where to read this one
[58:28] life is more this is verse 23. now I
[58:31] just there's something about when you
[58:32] pull a verse by itself
[58:34] it you zoom in or you as I like to say
[58:37] we double click
[58:39] life is more than meat and the body is
[58:42] more than Raymond
[58:44] in other words you know what you got to
[58:46] have that that that that you know
[58:49] 75 dollar skirt from
[58:52] Sarah Williams Boutique
[58:55] you've got to have those
[58:59] uh
[59:01] weatherproof
[59:03] hunting boots waterproof
[59:06] crispy
[59:08] crispy boots that's a famous hunting
[59:10] brand popular hunting brand like 350
[59:12] bucks gotta have them and then you get
[59:15] them
[59:16] and then if you if you had the option to
[59:19] die or give up the boots
[59:21] you'd give up the boots
[59:23] when you're when you're fighting for
[59:25] your life and you know there's a well
[59:27] anyways you understand the point the
[59:29] body is more than Raymond and life is
[59:31] more than meat so oh we gotta you know
[59:33] we we've done this
[59:35] just be transparent we gotta have this
[59:37] food
[59:38] so we buy it and we go home
[59:41] and it goes bad in the fridge
[59:44] life is more than meat but guess what
[59:46] you can't have any of this stuff
[59:50] and live you have to have it still right
[59:52] so it doesn't say hey don't eat
[59:56] hey don't wear clothes please wear
[59:58] clothes
[1:00:00] he says for all these things do the
[1:00:02] nations of the world seek after so
[1:00:05] everyone's that's everyone's Focus
[1:00:07] that's everyone's Focus
[1:00:09] okay but you got to have them got to
[1:00:12] have clothes
[1:00:13] and I think nice calls are good they
[1:00:15] last longer for one thing
[1:00:18] and your father knoweth that you have
[1:00:21] need of these things
[1:00:23] so he's not saying it's wrong to have
[1:00:25] them he's saying it's wrong to focus on
[1:00:28] them
[1:00:30] everything in Balance home economics
[1:00:33] you know it's it's a terrible example
[1:00:35] but you've seen it that family that has
[1:00:37] let's say a Jeep Wagoneer out front and
[1:00:41] their house is
[1:00:45] I don't want to offend anybody but you
[1:00:47] understand what I'm saying their houses
[1:00:50] not good
[1:00:52] something's out of balance here right
[1:00:55] the car should be equivalent to the
[1:00:57] value of the home how about that you
[1:00:59] have a really really really nice house
[1:01:00] and it well okay never mind you
[1:01:02] understand the point that the things are
[1:01:04] out of balance so the Lord knows you
[1:01:06] have need of these things
[1:01:09] so he provides for them
[1:01:11] so he backs this up with
[1:01:13] now I know I'm probably going to make
[1:01:15] mistakes but you just bear with me and
[1:01:16] God will take care of it because that's
[1:01:18] my heart but brother seek ye the kingdom
[1:01:20] of God and all these things shall be
[1:01:22] added unto you so you see it's your
[1:01:24] focus
[1:01:25] this goes back to what a young man
[1:01:26] should focus on as he's growing up he
[1:01:29] should focus on on on you know having
[1:01:31] his schooling taken care of you know
[1:01:33] it's in the world we live in today it's
[1:01:35] good to have your high school diploma so
[1:01:37] you know you focus on that get out of
[1:01:38] that now college is optional as far as
[1:01:40] I'm concerned but um the world we live
[1:01:42] in is is a certain way in different
[1:01:43] careers what are you going to do for a
[1:01:45] living where are you going to live
[1:01:46] what's God's will for your life all of
[1:01:49] those things that's kind of your focus
[1:01:50] because you're building an economy to
[1:01:53] support a family
[1:01:55] and a girl she's growing up and her
[1:01:57] focus should be on how she's going to
[1:01:59] support the economy her future husband
[1:02:01] will provide for her
[1:02:03] that's your focus okay that's what God
[1:02:05] wants he wants you to be focused on the
[1:02:07] proper thing and when you're focused on
[1:02:09] the right thing you're in the right
[1:02:11] position
[1:02:13] they were in the right position because
[1:02:14] God looks God looks at the desires of
[1:02:17] your heart so he knows hey this is what
[1:02:19] you desire for and you always pray Lord
[1:02:21] what's your will for my life
[1:02:25] because if we're not careful we we
[1:02:27] preach it a certain way and we cut
[1:02:29] people off
[1:02:30] that God is leading on a very specific
[1:02:33] path so he says seek the kingdom of God
[1:02:36] first put God first number one rule put
[1:02:39] God first
[1:02:49] I've heard it said read your Bible
[1:02:51] before you even brush your teeth
[1:02:54] I think that's a little much
[1:02:56] so don't be legalistic about it you're
[1:02:58] putting God first
[1:03:00] putting God first is addressing him at
[1:03:02] the beginning of your day whatever the
[1:03:03] beginning of your day looks like okay
[1:03:05] you're addressing him you're seeking him
[1:03:07] and then in everything that you do you
[1:03:10] say hey well you know um
[1:03:12] I'm gonna do this over here
[1:03:14] how am I going to put God first
[1:03:16] when something comes up a choice you
[1:03:18] know you got you got a couple of things
[1:03:19] you need to do
[1:03:21] I'm being very vague so please fill in
[1:03:23] the blanks for me two choices of what
[1:03:26] you go you want to do well which one
[1:03:28] hinges on this scripture putting God
[1:03:32] first
[1:03:33] start there and then if both of them do
[1:03:36] well okay but you start there that's the
[1:03:39] Baseline keep God first in your life and
[1:03:41] all these things let me ask you a
[1:03:44] question is there anything left out of
[1:03:45] the word all
[1:03:48] all these things shall be added unto you
[1:03:54] I really like this scripture this is in
[1:03:56] Luke chapter 12 as well you know go home
[1:03:58] and read Luke chapter 12 write it down
[1:03:59] go read it it's like
[1:04:01] 59 verses long so there's a lot in there
[1:04:03] and it all kind of fits I just couldn't
[1:04:06] take the time to read the entire script
[1:04:08] chapter but I really like this one so
[1:04:10] when it comes to to this subject of the
[1:04:13] balanced home and and keeping things
[1:04:15] lined up with the word of God and having
[1:04:17] beautiful Harmony in your home and
[1:04:19] having good economics in other words
[1:04:21] being smart with your finances being
[1:04:23] smart with with your home taking care of
[1:04:25] your home you know if you've got a leak
[1:04:27] in the basement fix the leak in the
[1:04:28] basement don't leave it there
[1:04:30] which is going to make problems worse be
[1:04:32] a good Steward with your time
[1:04:34] I've been wrestling my irrigation for
[1:04:37] like two weeks and traveling everything
[1:04:39] in between and but I'm I'm staying the
[1:04:42] course because it's my I'm being a good
[1:04:44] Steward of what's God you say brother
[1:04:45] Chris it's grass if you have a God gave
[1:04:47] me that grass
[1:04:50] so if I can't be a good Steward of that
[1:04:54] how am I being you understand like
[1:04:55] someone pulls up to your house and it's
[1:04:56] just all junky and then you say you're a
[1:04:58] Christian what are they going to
[1:04:59] associate Christianity with
[1:05:04] with that now you don't have to be rich
[1:05:07] to have a nice home there's a quote that
[1:05:11] I have
[1:05:12] where it says you know keep your home
[1:05:14] nice have I read that here yet
[1:05:17] let me see if I can just grab it really
[1:05:19] quickly
[1:05:25] brother Branham what achievement should
[1:05:26] we let our pre-teenage children
[1:05:27] participate in this is a question given
[1:05:29] to him and questions and answers 1964.
[1:05:31] he says I beg your pardon what activity
[1:05:33] should our pre-teen children anticipate
[1:05:35] or participate in also how should we go
[1:05:38] about helping them select their
[1:05:39] Associates he says keep them in
[1:05:41] Christian company as long as you
[1:05:43] possibly can if it's a girl keeper with
[1:05:46] Christian girls Christian boys vice
[1:05:48] versa if she's old enough to go with a
[1:05:50] boy see that she keeps with the right
[1:05:52] kind of a boy discourage her to any boy
[1:05:55] otherwise or boy to a girl if she's
[1:05:57] going with an unbeliever try to
[1:05:59] encourage her to go with a Believer and
[1:06:01] vice versa now he says make your home
[1:06:04] nice
[1:06:06] make your home a place where your
[1:06:08] daughter or son will not be ashamed to
[1:06:11] bring their company before their father
[1:06:14] and mother
[1:06:15] in other words clean and orderly nice as
[1:06:20] well as a nice atmosphere
[1:06:24] a nice atmosphere not one of contention
[1:06:27] and all of those things and into their
[1:06:29] house make homes so happy this is his
[1:06:32] words make home so happy that they'll be
[1:06:35] pleased in their home to stay there
[1:06:38] so there's a lot packed into those
[1:06:41] sentences in this paragraph
[1:06:44] but the gist of it is make your home
[1:06:46] nice
[1:06:47] keep it clean keep it orderly you know
[1:06:50] you got too much junk get rid of that
[1:06:52] junk if it's hindering the keeping the
[1:06:54] home nice and everything right
[1:06:57] because if you have a dirt floor
[1:07:00] you still sweep that every day
[1:07:02] I don't think any of us have dirt floors
[1:07:06] you can keep doesn't being having a nice
[1:07:08] home doesn't mean you have to be rich
[1:07:11] okay I think we made the point y'all
[1:07:12] look at me like move on
[1:07:15] so all of these things are we're an
[1:07:18] ambassador for Christ and in Luke 12 35
[1:07:20] says let your loins be girded about and
[1:07:22] your lights burning
[1:07:24] and your lights burning
[1:07:27] that's that's a good one there
[1:07:31] now later on in this chapter as I hope
[1:07:33] you'll read in your devotions at home he
[1:07:36] tells another story
[1:07:37] and because Peter asks him and Peter
[1:07:39] says you know you're giving all these
[1:07:40] Parables unto us and
[1:07:44] um in other words can you explain this
[1:07:50] and he tells a story of a faithful and a
[1:07:52] wise Steward and
[1:07:54] all of these things and
[1:07:57] and
[1:07:57] um
[1:07:58] he says this is this in his in his
[1:08:00] exhortation to his disciples he says
[1:08:02] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[1:08:04] when he cometh shall find so do it
[1:08:09] in other words the master says all right
[1:08:11] I entrust you with the estate take care
[1:08:13] of this and he goes off right
[1:08:16] and when he comes back he finds the
[1:08:19] steward
[1:08:21] doing
[1:08:28] not sitting
[1:08:30] doing now when I say sitting and talking
[1:08:33] about
[1:08:35] theoretically
[1:08:36] and because you're all sitting in church
[1:08:38] but that's the best place you can be
[1:08:39] right now okay so not sitting but but
[1:08:42] but you're you're not doing nothing
[1:08:45] you're doing
[1:08:47] that's how God wants to find you
[1:08:50] you know people well anyways we've we've
[1:08:54] heard that you know well the you know
[1:08:56] Rapture is coming and and uh and that
[1:08:58] that happened years ago hopefully it's
[1:08:59] not still happening hopefully everyone
[1:09:00] learned their lesson but
[1:09:02] um you know you know the Lord's coming
[1:09:04] all this stuff so you know why you know
[1:09:06] we're not going to buy houses we're not
[1:09:07] going to have jobs we're not going to
[1:09:09] take care of careers we're going to live
[1:09:10] day to day and then now they're old and
[1:09:12] they have no retirement and things
[1:09:14] aren't going well because God says do
[1:09:18] do
[1:09:20] we I don't have we we we as Christians
[1:09:25] is it type A personality sweetheart
[1:09:27] where you work do stuff all the time
[1:09:29] never sit down is that type A
[1:09:31] okay whatever whatever one of those
[1:09:33] things people say oh well they're type A
[1:09:34] you know I'm just overachievers you see
[1:09:36] what the devil does is he pulls stuff in
[1:09:38] school like oh well they're
[1:09:39] overachievers and it's cool to be the
[1:09:40] lazy dude on the back row
[1:09:44] been there we had to sit with our
[1:09:46] slouched
[1:09:48] and then we were cool I did it I was
[1:09:50] there but that's and then I had to grow
[1:09:53] up and then I had to learn that
[1:09:55] you're not gonna get anywhere
[1:09:56] spiritually or in life if you just chill
[1:09:59] all the time
[1:10:02] now we want to be chilly I want to be
[1:10:04] even tempered
[1:10:05] but we don't want to be lazy we want to
[1:10:08] be doing there's always something to be
[1:10:10] doing
[1:10:12] always something
[1:10:13] to be doing
[1:10:15] and I know I'm probably like
[1:10:18] a little bit overboard on the doing part
[1:10:19] but that's okay I'll pull you from the
[1:10:22] other side and we'll balance each other
[1:10:23] out
[1:10:25] so I I've mentioned this before this is
[1:10:27] but brother this is Theodore Roosevelt
[1:10:29] and he he said this in a speech he gave
[1:10:31] he says I wish to preach the doctrine
[1:10:33] not the doctrine of
[1:10:36] ignorable ease but the doctrine of the
[1:10:39] strenuous life and you can read stories
[1:10:42] about him and he really liked this model
[1:10:44] but what it is is we we leave this
[1:10:47] model we leave this to the world and
[1:10:50] then we look at them and say oh they're
[1:10:52] all they're all worried about the money
[1:10:54] and everything and and and we say well
[1:10:56] we're Christians and God will take care
[1:10:57] of us so we sit and do nothing
[1:11:02] God will let you sit in your nothingness
[1:11:06] and rot until you get up and start doing
[1:11:09] something
[1:11:11] there's simple Baseline
[1:11:14] and so I love this and I and I Try by
[1:11:16] God's grace to live by the motto
[1:11:19] to live a strenuous life it's not easy
[1:11:21] right his his he says in the scripture
[1:11:28] my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:11:33] so serving God is a joy it's not a
[1:11:36] burden it's a joy
[1:11:39] and if you are at the fitness level of
[1:11:43] running 50 miles
[1:11:46] 50 miles is a light and easy burden
[1:11:51] so what God does is he gives you the
[1:11:54] spiritual Fitness you hear him again I'm
[1:11:57] Fitness I am sorry spiritual Fitness to
[1:11:59] be able to look at 50 miles and say yep
[1:12:01] when do you want me to go Lord
[1:12:04] but the world looks on or or or a
[1:12:07] Christian who's not in their position
[1:12:08] looks on and says oh that's impossible
[1:12:11] exactly
[1:12:14] it it wasn't impossible
[1:12:16] it wouldn't be up to God
[1:12:20] that's why the scripture is there With
[1:12:22] God all things are possible
[1:12:26] we cannot serve god without God
[1:12:32] so it is impossible to be a Christian
[1:12:35] on your own
[1:12:37] but with Christ it's not I know that's
[1:12:39] very simple but God calls us to a
[1:12:42] strenuous life I mean go and read the
[1:12:43] stories of the men in the Bible
[1:12:46] and what they went through
[1:12:51] none of them they were all doing okay
[1:12:55] but he that this is in the same chapter
[1:12:57] verse 48.
[1:13:00] so Less on the stripes more on the
[1:13:03] second part of the verse for unto
[1:13:04] whomsoever much is given of him shall
[1:13:07] much be required to whom men have
[1:13:10] committed much of him they will ask the
[1:13:12] more
[1:13:14] now I'm really learning this firsthand
[1:13:16] at work right now
[1:13:21] different things but I'm being thrust
[1:13:24] into more responsibilities
[1:13:26] and for a while I was didn't want it
[1:13:29] because more responsibilities more is
[1:13:31] asked of you
[1:13:34] and I remember there was a time in my
[1:13:36] life as a husband and a father where I
[1:13:39] had to come face to face with the fact
[1:13:40] that I wasn't doing enough
[1:13:43] I was being lazy
[1:13:45] I don't understand grown men who can
[1:13:48] game
[1:13:49] I don't have enough time
[1:13:51] to gain there's too much to be doing
[1:13:54] if I'm not working on a project if I'm
[1:13:57] not working if I'm not preparing a
[1:13:59] sermon if I'm not you know doing
[1:14:00] something for the Youth or for different
[1:14:02] things in the church or or traveling for
[1:14:05] the ministry or whatever then I'm
[1:14:06] spending time with my family
[1:14:08] and we said oh we're so busy I challenge
[1:14:11] you if you have the ability to do so you
[1:14:14] say you're too busy to do all the things
[1:14:16] you need to do today I challenge you
[1:14:17] turn your phone off and leave it in your
[1:14:20] bedroom
[1:14:22] you will be amazed how much time you
[1:14:25] waste just picking it up and looking at
[1:14:28] it because we just pick it up and look
[1:14:29] at it
[1:14:30] 10 minutes
[1:14:31] well you do that six times a day that's
[1:14:34] a whole hour
[1:14:35] do you know what you can do with the
[1:14:37] whole hour
[1:14:38] so I realized I had to get the games on
[1:14:40] my phone this was years ago delete them
[1:14:43] it was time to get doing
[1:14:45] and I started to to embrace that yes
[1:14:47] it's hard but but that's what makes it
[1:14:49] all the better
[1:14:51] with Vigor young men should have Vigor
[1:14:53] and vitality and be energized I mean you
[1:14:57] see me energized
[1:15:01] but you know and that's not to say you
[1:15:03] have to show the energy but have the
[1:15:05] endurance have the energy to to go to go
[1:15:08] through with it
[1:15:11] to stay awake in church sorry I couldn't
[1:15:13] resist
[1:15:15] the energy to put into because guess
[1:15:17] what that's that when you're in your
[1:15:20] youth when we're in our youth
[1:15:23] that's the energy then when we get older
[1:15:26] we can sit on the porch in the rocking
[1:15:27] chair and counsel the young men right if
[1:15:30] the Lord should Terry but you don't ever
[1:15:32] just because you have gray hairs
[1:15:35] doesn't mean you have experience so you
[1:15:37] got to get that experience while you
[1:15:38] have the energy to do so that was
[1:15:40] personal opinion
[1:15:42] so we want to be faithful ambassadors
[1:15:45] now you don't have to run around like a
[1:15:46] chicken with your head cut off when I
[1:15:48] say energized I I don't want to get too
[1:15:50] off on that but uh
[1:15:53] take Life by the horns
[1:15:57] okay
[1:15:59] do you want to be faithful ambassadors
[1:16:03] well what is that scripture we all we
[1:16:05] all want to hear one day well done my
[1:16:06] good and faithful servant
[1:16:09] so you can do this in your own studies
[1:16:12] you know it's always nice to have a kind
[1:16:14] of a fresh idea what to do in devotions
[1:16:16] go through the scriptures and look the
[1:16:19] word look for the verses look for the
[1:16:22] stories that describe a faithful servant
[1:16:27] you be that
[1:16:29] and when you get to that
[1:16:31] place in glory one day he will tell you
[1:16:34] well done my good and faithful servant
[1:16:37] if it is not going to require anything
[1:16:38] out of you that he didn't write down
[1:16:43] we want to be faithful ambassadors now
[1:16:45] in Luke chapter 16 Luke verse 10 he that
[1:16:49] is faithful in that which is least
[1:16:52] is faithful also in much
[1:16:55] now I speak from experience
[1:16:59] how many times do we say if I just had
[1:17:02] more money
[1:17:03] I'd be able to pay my bills
[1:17:07] this is the very challenging subject and
[1:17:10] we're we are still learning and we are
[1:17:12] still living this
[1:17:15] but if you're serving God if you're
[1:17:17] paying your tithes if you're paying
[1:17:19] offerings if you're if you're putting
[1:17:21] God first in your life you're being
[1:17:23] responsible with what he's given you
[1:17:26] he's going to take care of it whether
[1:17:28] you have money in the bank or not
[1:17:31] God never told us to fear always have
[1:17:33] faith okay
[1:17:36] we're not to be Beggars we don't beg
[1:17:39] God takes care of us
[1:17:41] and we're his child what do you want to
[1:17:43] what do you want to give your child when
[1:17:45] he's when they're listening and they're
[1:17:46] obeying and and they're serving you
[1:17:49] they're doing their best you want to
[1:17:52] give them the nicest thing
[1:17:55] yeah
[1:17:56] the best thing for their for their needs
[1:17:58] and everything
[1:18:00] so
[1:18:01] he that is faithful in that which is
[1:18:03] least is faithful also in much God says
[1:18:06] all right I'll give you a little bit
[1:18:08] and let me see how you handle that
[1:18:10] for years we struggled financially
[1:18:13] this is just personal testimony this is
[1:18:15] not lifting myself up for years we
[1:18:17] struggle financially
[1:18:19] as soon as I
[1:18:21] begin to be a good Steward of the money
[1:18:23] that God was giving us
[1:18:26] the money started to come in
[1:18:29] I got a better job and I got promoted
[1:18:32] then they got promoted again then they
[1:18:34] got another job that was better than
[1:18:35] that and every time just before God gave
[1:18:37] us an increase he tried us hard on if we
[1:18:41] would stick with the principles he had
[1:18:42] given us for finances
[1:18:44] and when we did
[1:18:46] out the other side would come and
[1:18:48] increase
[1:18:49] now it's not going to be
[1:18:52] it never doesn't necessarily like that
[1:18:55] for us it wasn't just up a nice little
[1:18:57] set of staircases there was some you
[1:18:59] know what do they call that you're
[1:19:01] looking at a a graph and you want to see
[1:19:03] growth you know if you zoom way out it's
[1:19:05] just it's like a straight line but if
[1:19:06] you zoom in it's like this right but
[1:19:08] it's always up okay
[1:19:10] that's how it is so God tries you to see
[1:19:14] are you going to be faithful he said oh
[1:19:16] God you know I remember one time I was
[1:19:17] like okay I'm gonna tell my landlord I'm
[1:19:19] gonna testify to her because I heard the
[1:19:20] testimony God's gonna give me a thousand
[1:19:22] dollars by the end of the day and I
[1:19:24] didn't win and I goofed off all day long
[1:19:26] so guess what it came at the end of the
[1:19:27] day and I look like an absolute fool
[1:19:31] is that the kind of representation we
[1:19:33] want to give the world of what Christ is
[1:19:35] I should have went out and tried my best
[1:19:37] first of all I shouldn't have been there
[1:19:39] I should have had rent when rent was due
[1:19:41] if you're late on rent
[1:19:44] you're late
[1:19:47] there needs to be a good reason how
[1:19:48] about that
[1:19:51] they don't just be late all the time
[1:19:53] it's if it's habitual you're doing
[1:19:55] something wrong and he that is unjust in
[1:19:57] the least is unjust also in much
[1:20:00] now this is a little bit negative but I
[1:20:01] want you to look at the positive side of
[1:20:03] this if therefore you have not been
[1:20:04] faithful in the unrighteous Mammon who
[1:20:07] will commit to your trust the true
[1:20:10] riches
[1:20:11] they say oh I I want to be I want to be
[1:20:13] used of God and I want to be a part of
[1:20:16] the church and doing stuff and and you
[1:20:18] can't take care of your home and the
[1:20:20] economics of your home
[1:20:22] God's not going to trust you with the
[1:20:23] riches of the church
[1:20:25] and I don't mean cash I mean helping the
[1:20:27] body God can I had the desire to go out
[1:20:30] and do what what we just did last this
[1:20:31] over this last week and what God has
[1:20:33] called us to over the
[1:20:35] uh called us to do now in the ministry I
[1:20:38] had desires for that years ago but I
[1:20:40] didn't have anything in place I had no
[1:20:41] experience I had I didn't my I wasn't
[1:20:43] taking care of my family wasn't taking
[1:20:45] care of my home so God said nope
[1:20:48] it wasn't until I got all of that sorted
[1:20:50] out that that desire I had in my heart
[1:20:52] that pull I felt began to manifest
[1:20:56] out here
[1:20:57] he says look I want to make sure
[1:21:00] so you're looking you're wondering why
[1:21:02] aren't things working out
[1:21:04] you know we had a recent incident I'll
[1:21:06] be very transparent
[1:21:07] we had a recent incident
[1:21:09] where
[1:21:10] it was just like you ever been there
[1:21:12] where it's like where's the money it's
[1:21:13] just gone and then sometimes it's like
[1:21:15] wow the money's just there there's not
[1:21:17] any more but it's just it's going more
[1:21:20] places
[1:21:21] and I just Lord what's going on what's
[1:21:23] going on and I realized and I'll have
[1:21:25] the scripture later on that there was a
[1:21:27] time where tithes were owed and I didn't
[1:21:31] pay an additional half so one and a half
[1:21:34] times
[1:21:35] as soon as I fixed it that that day he
[1:21:39] provided us
[1:21:41] provided for us that day
[1:21:43] it was in almost instant now I'm not
[1:21:45] saying every time it's going to be
[1:21:46] innocent but it was God showing me yes
[1:21:48] look you honor me you put me first you
[1:21:50] pay your tithes like you're supposed to
[1:21:51] even when it hurts
[1:21:53] I will take care of you because he owns
[1:21:55] a
[1:21:56] how did we do that it's the flesh I know
[1:21:58] but how do we do that we forget that God
[1:22:00] owns everything he's got all of this
[1:22:04] we should never have to beg God owns
[1:22:07] everything
[1:22:08] we just gotta do what he says and he'll
[1:22:12] bless us
[1:22:17] and if you have not been faithful in
[1:22:18] that which is another man's who shall
[1:22:20] give you that which is your own
[1:22:22] now he doesn't say
[1:22:31] he doesn't specify house car money
[1:22:34] he just says another man so if you're
[1:22:35] renting
[1:22:36] you better take care of that house that
[1:22:39] apartment
[1:22:40] you're you're leasing a vehicle renting
[1:22:42] a vehicle whatever it would be you take
[1:22:44] care of that you go you go to another
[1:22:46] state you rent a car that car better
[1:22:47] show up cleaner than it was before you
[1:22:49] say well you're just being a clean freak
[1:22:51] no that's being an ambassador for Christ
[1:22:53] people say wow yeah you go to a
[1:22:54] restaurant you tip because that's being
[1:22:57] an ambassador for Christ look there's a
[1:22:59] perfect story brother Madam the waitress
[1:23:01] was rude to him didn't deserve a tip and
[1:23:05] he tipped her a little extra
[1:23:07] and he had insight into what was going
[1:23:09] on
[1:23:10] that doesn't matter
[1:23:13] we our ambassadors are everywhere we go
[1:23:15] in public we get our drink they you know
[1:23:18] Starbucks and you ordered a Vente quad
[1:23:21] shot soy milk two pumps of sugar free
[1:23:23] vanilla one pump of caramel with whip on
[1:23:26] top and cinnamon dolce sprinkles and
[1:23:28] they give you no whip no cinnamon dolce
[1:23:30] sprinkles
[1:23:32] you don't go up there and be like I want
[1:23:34] to talk to your manager
[1:23:37] and you don't be rude you say hey do you
[1:23:40] mind can you fix this for me if your
[1:23:42] whipped cream is that important to you
[1:23:46] and you're nice they can be as rude as
[1:23:48] they want you don't you're not judged
[1:23:50] for that you're judged for how you
[1:23:51] represent Christ
[1:23:54] I'm probably gonna have to deal with
[1:23:55] this on Friday
[1:23:58] God have you speak something so direct
[1:24:00] like that every time I almost a couple
[1:24:02] days later it's like
[1:24:07] oh oh he he say humble before God I
[1:24:12] don't I'm not up here I'm pointing one
[1:24:13] finger but I got four pointing back
[1:24:15] three point see I can't count three
[1:24:16] point back at me the foolishness of
[1:24:19] preaching that's what the Bible says
[1:24:20] that doesn't give me a ride as a
[1:24:21] minister to be foolish
[1:24:23] but in God's eyes preaching is what he
[1:24:25] ordained us to anyways
[1:24:30] but we're just men who make mistakes
[1:24:33] so be faithful in what God has given you
[1:24:37] and then so you're faithful to other man
[1:24:40] he shall give you what's your own and
[1:24:42] you'll be faithful with that
[1:24:45] you know keep your car clean take good
[1:24:47] care of it
[1:24:49] take good care of your stuff
[1:24:55] you know God calls us to a higher order
[1:24:58] and I know of a story where someone
[1:25:00] borrowed a piece of Machinery from
[1:25:03] somebody else
[1:25:05] and it wasn't their fault but it broke
[1:25:07] while they had it
[1:25:11] and it was just I was already coming
[1:25:12] apart but you know what that person knew
[1:25:15] this was given to me
[1:25:17] in good faith that it will return to
[1:25:20] them the same and in good working order
[1:25:24] because it was given to that person in
[1:25:26] working order
[1:25:28] so they went and they bought a brand new
[1:25:30] one and replaced it you say wow that's
[1:25:33] way overboard yeah but
[1:25:36] is God not gonna stand behind that
[1:25:40] you see we oh we gotta we gotta hold on
[1:25:42] to it we gotta hold on to it but
[1:25:44] when have you when
[1:25:47] if you can't give now you got to have
[1:25:50] everything taken care of pay your tithes
[1:25:53] God pay your bills because that's being
[1:25:55] a good ambassador
[1:25:57] okay
[1:26:01] you could have a quarter tank and need a
[1:26:03] half a tank and God tells you to give
[1:26:05] somebody the twenty dollars you need to
[1:26:07] make your take have more gas
[1:26:11] guess what you do that
[1:26:13] turn around God fills up the whole thing
[1:26:15] now
[1:26:17] don't go out doing it expecting the
[1:26:19] whole thing but you do it because you
[1:26:20] know hey you know what God has under
[1:26:22] control or you don't have to drive there
[1:26:24] anymore right I mean you never know what
[1:26:26] how God's going to do but but how what
[1:26:28] what a place would that be if we had
[1:26:30] such total faith in God like that that
[1:26:32] he would take care of everything
[1:26:34] what kind of people would he be
[1:26:37] I think we'd be a lot more giving
[1:26:40] and eternal life by definition
[1:26:43] eternal life is living for other people
[1:26:46] and that's not just leave it to JFK
[1:26:49] to say don't look what you what your
[1:26:52] country can do for you look what you can
[1:26:53] do for your country let's not leave that
[1:26:56] phrase for them because I think that
[1:26:59] lines up with the word of God don't ask
[1:27:01] what God can do for you ask what you
[1:27:04] could arrest what the kingdom of God can
[1:27:05] do for you ask what you can do for the
[1:27:07] kingdom of God
[1:27:09] living for other people the governor
[1:27:10] says pray for other people's needs and
[1:27:14] watch God meet your own
[1:27:17] see it's a it's a it's a it's a mind
[1:27:20] shift okay
[1:27:22] a few more here to get through
[1:27:26] so tithing
[1:27:30] say great preachers after our pocketbook
[1:27:32] again
[1:27:34] well no it's in the scripture
[1:27:36] and all the tithe of the land whether
[1:27:38] there whether of the seed of the land or
[1:27:40] of the fruit of the tree is the Lord's
[1:27:42] it is Holy unto the Lord
[1:27:43] and if a man will at all redeem ought of
[1:27:46] his tithes he shall add there to the
[1:27:48] fifth part thereof in other words if you
[1:27:50] have to redeem in other words you owe
[1:27:52] Tides you add a fifth part to that and
[1:27:55] ties is is by definition in other places
[1:27:57] ten percent of of your increase now I'm
[1:28:01] just going to interject something there
[1:28:02] maybe it's on my opinion maybe not
[1:28:06] but when you get your check and it says
[1:28:08] gross and it says net
[1:28:11] in between gross and net that stuff is
[1:28:14] paying for your stuff it's paying your
[1:28:16] taxes it's paying your benefits it's
[1:28:18] paying your uh Social Security it's all
[1:28:21] of yours your stuff so they're just
[1:28:24] paying it for you so tithe on the gross
[1:28:26] that's my personal opinion but that's
[1:28:29] your increase all those things even
[1:28:31] between gross and net
[1:28:33] they are paying for your stuff
[1:28:35] they're just doing it for you
[1:28:37] if you had a 1099 instead of you have W4
[1:28:41] or whatever it is W-2 get it to 99.
[1:28:45] you would pay
[1:28:47] what you were paying you would pay
[1:28:49] tithes on it but then as soon as we go
[1:28:50] maybe that's like you guys that was me
[1:28:52] for a while and then one day I was like
[1:28:54] hang on a second okay so
[1:28:56] my personal opinion pay on the gross
[1:28:59] now
[1:29:01] um in Hebrews chapter 7
[1:29:04] part 1 1957. he says what would a man
[1:29:07] take tithings for if he never was born
[1:29:10] never he's talking about Melchizedek
[1:29:11] Melchizedek comes to Abraham and Abraham
[1:29:14] Pays His ties to Melchizedek
[1:29:19] and he's saying why does Melchizedek
[1:29:21] need the money he doesn't need the money
[1:29:33] No Maybe
[1:29:35] get that dog out the out of the church
[1:29:40] sorry folks um so
[1:29:42] never had a father so why does why does
[1:29:45] you need to pay tithing to Melchizedek
[1:29:47] when Melchizedek is is he's all-knowing
[1:29:49] he's Eternal he's right he's everything
[1:29:53] well he says so that's what he's talking
[1:29:55] about right here so he says that never
[1:29:57] will die and also the beginning to end
[1:29:59] and he never had no father or mother or
[1:30:01] descent and owned the whole heavens and
[1:30:03] earth and all in it why would he take
[1:30:05] tithe
[1:30:06] why would he ask Abraham to pay tithes
[1:30:08] you see what a strict thing it is to pay
[1:30:10] tithes so even though he's Melchizedek
[1:30:13] Abraham paid him tithes and it's in the
[1:30:15] scripture and it says that while the the
[1:30:17] Levi was in the loins of Abraham he paid
[1:30:20] tithes because it's God's money it's
[1:30:22] actually not your money that portion
[1:30:24] there
[1:30:25] is not your money it's God's money
[1:30:28] you see what a strict thing it is to pay
[1:30:29] tithes tithing is right every Christian
[1:30:31] is Duty bound to pay tithe that's right
[1:30:34] never has been changed
[1:30:36] you pay your tithes
[1:30:39] he says
[1:30:41] um
[1:30:42] but you know I feel like this that a
[1:30:44] member of a church their first
[1:30:45] obligation is with their tithe and
[1:30:47] offerings is to support their Church
[1:30:51] if you are members of These Fine
[1:30:52] churches as represented here you support
[1:30:54] your church that's your first duty to
[1:30:57] God
[1:30:59] bring your tithe and offerings into the
[1:31:02] storehouse the offerings too and the
[1:31:05] storehouse you surely know what that is
[1:31:07] what that is it's where you get your
[1:31:09] food so there is where you get your
[1:31:10] spiritual food and your obligation is to
[1:31:13] your church and not to an evangelist
[1:31:15] like me so he's saying that's your duty
[1:31:17] bound and that's your first duty to God
[1:31:19] to pay your tithes to God
[1:31:23] now here's what he says right here he
[1:31:25] says tithes pays the preacher the pastor
[1:31:28] he's he's to live by the tithe of the
[1:31:31] people but we have to get something else
[1:31:33] to do we have to have our part into it
[1:31:35] they can't make it it up there's another
[1:31:37] Society will do another Society so he's
[1:31:40] saying that they can't pay the preacher
[1:31:41] because they're not paying their tithes
[1:31:42] so they have soup suppers and they have
[1:31:44] the different kind of things like that
[1:31:46] and baking sales and everything to
[1:31:48] support the pastor instead of paying
[1:31:49] their ties like God had it to be God's
[1:31:52] way is right isn't that the truth
[1:31:55] it's not the truth if we could just we
[1:31:56] could always come back to that and say
[1:31:58] what's God's way always come back to
[1:32:01] that God's way is Right tithe and
[1:32:04] offerings goes to Levi which was the
[1:32:06] minister if everybody would pay their
[1:32:07] tithes you wouldn't have to have any
[1:32:09] soup supper see you adopted something
[1:32:11] else and leave the tide things off say
[1:32:14] it's an Old Testament argument I'd like
[1:32:15] for you to prove it to me that's right
[1:32:17] you can't do it by God's word it's a new
[1:32:19] testament order too God makes one order
[1:32:21] it can never be changed it has to remain
[1:32:23] that way
[1:32:25] so in the home economics we want to
[1:32:27] start with putting God first and we want
[1:32:29] to start with with paying our tithes
[1:32:31] because that's what it is that 10 that
[1:32:33] goes into the the the the your tithes go
[1:32:36] to the church and that pays the pastor
[1:32:39] and that's for him to take care of okay
[1:32:41] it's your offerings and everything else
[1:32:43] outside of that that help with the
[1:32:44] building and the building funds and
[1:32:47] things like that now
[1:32:50] um so in all this talk about money and
[1:32:52] different things and this is
[1:32:55] um maybe a bit of a personal opinion but
[1:32:59] um you ought to have a budget now this
[1:33:01] is a little bit silly but
[1:33:03] if you don't know where your money's
[1:33:05] going if you don't tell your money where
[1:33:07] to go your money disappears
[1:33:10] so when you got down with your to the
[1:33:12] end of your budget you should have
[1:33:13] nothing left over because if you have a
[1:33:15] left over it'll go to
[1:33:18] Starbucks or Dutch Bros it'll just fall
[1:33:22] through your hands like sand okay so so
[1:33:25] I think I put this in here since I think
[1:33:28] budget is important and it's part of the
[1:33:30] home economics you need to know what's
[1:33:32] going on
[1:33:33] you know there's no excuse to not know
[1:33:34] right you know adulting is hard stop
[1:33:38] you now prescribe to the strenuous Life
[1:33:42] as a Christian adulting is not hard
[1:33:44] adulting is strenuous and God is there
[1:33:48] to inspire you and give you the strength
[1:33:50] you need to continue living life
[1:33:53] as a good ambassador of Christ
[1:33:58] now all of these things I know for me
[1:34:00] the first time I heard it was very
[1:34:01] overwhelming and and every day you know
[1:34:04] we're faced again with our mistakes
[1:34:06] we're faced again with our discrepancies
[1:34:08] we're faced again with our failures and
[1:34:10] we say wow I did it again
[1:34:13] I bought Starbucks and I forgot to pay a
[1:34:16] bill
[1:34:17] now I don't have the money because it's
[1:34:18] been done on Starbucks
[1:34:20] or whatever apparently as you guys know
[1:34:22] now Starbucks is our problem
[1:34:26] because a preacher preaches where he
[1:34:27] lives so
[1:34:31] so here's the deal
[1:34:34] I don't know your life I don't know the
[1:34:36] nuances and the details and frankly I
[1:34:38] don't want to know
[1:34:40] you have the different things between
[1:34:41] you and God and your family that's okay
[1:34:43] you want to tell me that's fine too I
[1:34:46] don't want to sound like
[1:34:47] rude or things I do care very deeply
[1:34:49] about each one of you
[1:34:51] God says be strong and of good courage
[1:34:54] You're Not Afraid neither be thou
[1:34:56] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[1:34:58] thee with her so ever thou goeth so he's
[1:35:00] saying not just fear but don't be
[1:35:02] dismayed don't be depressed
[1:35:04] don't be downtrodden because you're
[1:35:05] looking at this and you're thinking man
[1:35:08] I need to do better
[1:35:09] but it's so hard some days you're tired
[1:35:12] and no matter how much caffeine you
[1:35:14] drink you can't shake it
[1:35:16] and you have things you have to do
[1:35:19] but you're tired
[1:35:22] some days we put them off and then we
[1:35:24] regret it you know what it I hated the
[1:35:26] saying as a kid but it stuck with me my
[1:35:29] entire life
[1:35:30] and my dad got it from his dad so my
[1:35:33] grandpa is where it started maybe from
[1:35:34] his dad
[1:35:36] but it's don't put off tomorrow what you
[1:35:38] can do today
[1:35:40] and that comes back sometimes when it's
[1:35:43] 9 p.m and it's raining
[1:35:47] I said well I can still do it today
[1:35:52] it's it's hard but
[1:35:55] so is Jericho
[1:35:57] and look what happened when Joshua said
[1:35:59] all right we're going across the river
[1:36:00] Jordan we're going to face a mountain we
[1:36:02] don't have the money for
[1:36:05] so God said March around seven times so
[1:36:07] here we are
[1:36:11] you see God was telling him what to do
[1:36:13] but then God came and said be strong and
[1:36:16] of good courage I'm with you I'm asking
[1:36:18] you to do this so I'll be with you he's
[1:36:21] asking you to be a better Ambassador for
[1:36:24] Christ in the in your home and have a
[1:36:26] balanced home that represents Christ of
[1:36:28] the world
[1:36:29] he's not going to leave you hanging by
[1:36:31] yourself he's going to come and he's
[1:36:33] going to be strong and of good courage
[1:36:35] not to hinge on this word courage and
[1:36:38] one last thing at the men as we close
[1:36:41] Charles Spurgeon said a man without
[1:36:44] courage is a knife without an edge
[1:36:50] everybody hates that knife that won't
[1:36:52] cut anything
[1:36:56] courage is not ignoring this is another
[1:36:58] one another saying I remember who said
[1:37:00] if a courage is not ignoring the danger
[1:37:03] and acting like it's not there courage
[1:37:05] is facing the danger and doing what
[1:37:07] needs to be done that paraphrase that's
[1:37:10] a paraphrase God
[1:37:12] calls us the stuff
[1:37:15] now
[1:37:16] getting up in the morning
[1:37:18] making that breakfast to the family and
[1:37:20] cleaning the house and keeping a nice
[1:37:22] home or or getting up in the morning and
[1:37:24] and and you know getting that cup of
[1:37:26] coffee and stumbling to work and now you
[1:37:29] have to stumble to work but going to
[1:37:30] work or you know up late because you got
[1:37:33] to work on this project to take care of
[1:37:35] the family and keep things going and
[1:37:36] running smoothly
[1:37:39] takes courage you don't have to be
[1:37:41] facing a AK-47 someone telling you deny
[1:37:44] Christ or I'll shoot you
[1:37:47] it takes courage just to do those
[1:37:48] everyday things
[1:37:51] and God says I will give you the courage
[1:37:54] to do so and I want to be a man with
[1:37:56] courage because I don't want to be a
[1:37:58] dull Knight
[1:38:01] Spurgeon goes on to Define this phrase
[1:38:04] and he says a man with a sharp knife can
[1:38:07] cut his way
[1:38:09] through to success It's a Jungle it's a
[1:38:12] jungle and the best way to get through
[1:38:14] the jungle is the Bowie knife
[1:38:16] now you don't face your your colleague
[1:38:19] at work and say I'm going to cut you
[1:38:20] down because I'm going to be the leader
[1:38:21] no that's not what I mean when an
[1:38:24] obstacle comes up you take the best
[1:38:26] sword I know of
[1:38:29] the word of God and if you are Mount of
[1:38:31] Courage you will take the word of God
[1:38:32] and apply it to your life only a week
[1:38:34] man will say it's too hard to live
[1:38:38] let's bow our heads
[1:38:42] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:38:45] Lord you call us to uh such a high order
[1:38:52] and I believe tonight Lord we're ready
[1:38:54] to step up to the challenge
[1:38:56] but we can't do it without you that's
[1:38:59] the beautiful thing of this of this
[1:39:01] calling that you've given us Lord
[1:39:03] we can in no way shape or form ever
[1:39:08] do it until we
[1:39:11] find you
[1:39:13] and you surrender to you and then you do
[1:39:15] it through us
[1:39:16] but we surrender to you
[1:39:19] we have things we have to do we have our
[1:39:21] part to play
[1:39:22] and we surrender everything else we
[1:39:24] servant it all to you and you guide us
[1:39:27] and you lead us
[1:39:28] and you give us the strength that we
[1:39:30] need to be courageous like Joshua
[1:39:33] to be strong to face life even when it's
[1:39:38] difficult
[1:39:39] we face it and we say God I need your
[1:39:42] strength and you call that courage you
[1:39:46] call that a strong man you call that a
[1:39:48] strong woman
[1:39:49] when we say God I can't do it without
[1:39:51] you you're not a crutch
[1:39:56] you are our life
[1:39:59] and there's no living without life
[1:40:03] thank you Lord we love you we appreciate
[1:40:05] you may you just be with us and lead us
[1:40:07] and guide us we ask in all these things
[1:40:09] we once again remember our pastors

[1:40:13] the strength to him Lord and
[1:40:16] encouragement to end father
