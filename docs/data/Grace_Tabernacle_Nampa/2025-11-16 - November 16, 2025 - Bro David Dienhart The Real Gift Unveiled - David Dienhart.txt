Lord, my heart's open, Lord Jesus, just [music] looking to receive this morning, Lord God. And Lord Jesus, [music] what a privilege and an honor we count it to be gathered here this morning. Lord, whether we're tired or our [music] body hurts or got a little whatever it might be that's trying to afflict us, Lord Jesus, I [music] pray you to just help us to look past all these things, Lord God. That our focus would be on you this morning, [music] Lord Jesus. that we put aside all these things and any other things of this world, stresses and whatever it might be, Lord God, that we can just look [music] to you this morning, Lord, the author and finisher of our faith, Lord God, the eternal creator of life, Lord God. How we love you, Lord Jesus. And as we come before you this morning, you've heard these requests, the different ones asking for [music] prayer, Lord Jesus, leadership, whatever it might be, a job, Lord God. any other out here this morning with lifted hands, whatever the [music] need would be, financial sickness in the body, Lord God, just [music] different things. Lord, you've already told us over and over and over again, [music] it's taken care of, Lord God, if we can just take and commit these things to you this morning and just find joy and peace, Lord God, in knowing that your word says, "I got it covered. We'll walk through the fire and not be burned. The floods will not overflow us, Lord God, as your word says. [music] And we claim those things this morning. Have no, be not dismayed. I am with you, Lord Jesus. I can think of so [music] many so many times in your word, you've said, "I've got it covered. I'll go before you. I'll come behind you." And Lord Jesus, we thank you for these things and we're committing it to you, [music] Lord Jesus, and believing in what your word says about it. So Lord God, knowing what your word says that you will bring [music] it to pass. How we love you Lord Jesus. The ones that aren't with us this morning, the ones listening on Lord, whoever it might be, Lord Jesus, that [music] this would just go out and touch, Lord God. I pray your spirit would be with them, be with us even now, Lord Jesus, may you just take this [music] service in your hands, Lord God.

Amen. And um let's just sing that little uh song uh 861. Wonderful, merciful savior, [clears throat] wonderful, [music] merciful savior, [music] precious [singing] redeemer and free. Who would [singing] have thought [music] that a lamb could rescue [music and singing] the souls of man? Oh, [singing] you [music] rescue the souls of man.

[music] Oh, [singing] our hearts always hunger [music] for counselor, [singing] comforter, [music] keeper, spirit we [music and singing] long to embrace. You [singing] offer hope when our hearts t hopelessly [music and singing] lost the way. Oh, [singing] we've hopelessly [music] lost the way. You [singing] are the one that we pray.

Oh our hearts [music] always hunger [singing] for. Almighty [singing] [music] infinite father, faithfully loving [music] your own.

[music] Oh, our [singing] hearts always hunger for. [snorts] Amen. So we ask our brother David to come this morning um that little chorus uh 1071 have your way. [music] Somebody help me out. Feel like I'm off this morning. My [music] tune I can't get a tune. Every [music and singing] way with your way. [music] Have your [singing] way. Holy Spirit, fill our hearts and have your [singing] way. [music] Have your [singing] way. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Have your way. Holy [music] Spirit, fill our hearts and have your way. As we [music] wait, we wait on you. And [music] as we pray, speak [music] your word into [singing] our hearts and have your way. [music] Have your way. Have your way. Holy [music] Spirit, fill our hearts and have your way. And as we wait and as [music] we pray, speak [music] your word into [singing] our hearts and have your way. Have your way. Have [singing] your way. Holy [music] Spirit, [singing] fill our hearts and have your way. One more time. Have your way. [music] Have your way. Holy [singing] Spirit, fill our hearts and have your way. God bless you, Isaac. God bless you. Let's sing [music] that again. How many want the Lord to have his way? That's what we've come here for, isn't it? That's what we desire is the Lord to have his way. Amen. If he doesn't have his way, your way won't [music] get you anywhere. So, let's lay down our way and take his way. Amen. Let's [music] have his way. Amen. Oh, have your way. [music] Amen. Have your way. Holy Spirit, fill our heart and have your [singing] way. Amen. Amen. If you'll stand [music] with me this morning. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. I was glad when they said unto me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." Because we know that there's only one provided place to meet the Lord. And that's not in grace tabernacle. That's in the house of the Lord. And the house of the Lord is present. The house of the Lord. He dwells in his body, his bride. In his the house of the Lord is the Lord Jesus. Amen. And so we've come to worship him in his house. &gt;&gt; And so we we're expecting when we come into his house, we expect to meet him. and we believe he's present with us. &gt;&gt; And so, God bless you this morning. God bless those online, those that are not assembled with us. I know I know brother Trevor called something come up. And so, as we pray, let's just remember him in prayer also. And that whatever it is that God would would have his way with all of us. That's our desire. That's what we want. We certainly don't want our own way. As I said, we want God's way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you that we can call you our Father. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Lord, thy kingdom come, thy will be done. May thy name be glorified here in the hearts of your children, in the hearts of your elect seed. May they have ears to hear and realize, Lord, that it's not what they do, but it's what you've already given to them. Help them to receive it. Help them to hear it. Lord, I pray that you would give revelation upon your word and by your word. For you said faith cometh by hearing the word. And so that's our desire. That's our prayer is that you would fill us and for we with your faith. For we know the believer is the faith of God, the revelation of the word in us. So we give you praise now. Bless your word, we pray, and have your way. That's what we've sang. That's what we'd want. That's what we desire. As we yield ourselves now to your word, to your presence. In Jesus Christ's name, I pray. Amen. Amen. Turn with me to St. John 3. Amen. There's some missing. And I know that uh we wish everybody could be here, but the Lord knows all things. And so, we just pray God's blessing on those that can't be and those that want to be and can't be. Amen. And you know, it's always what we desire, what's in our hearts, what God sees. And so, we can't hide that from him because his he the word is present and he the word discerns the hearts and thoughts and the minds of the people. So, we can hide nothing from him. We've come into his presence and the presence of light is here. So, in St. John 3 verse three, Jesus speaking to Nicodemus. Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see," and that word see is understand or visualize or or perceive the kingdom of God. And then in verse 16, we'll take verse 15 first. That whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world. Now that world there is mankind. Now that's not the cosmos because God didn't love the cosmos. The cosmos in itself is not of God. It's of the enemy. But the mankind, his creation &gt;&gt; is brought here and God has provided a way out. But it depends whether you want to accept that or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not what we try to do to please God. It's what he's already done that we receive. And so we know that by this verse here that whosoever believeth in him didn't say believe on him. It said believe in him. And we know that the only way you could really be a believer in him is that you were in him to begin with &gt;&gt; because God's got children. He's speaking to those seed, his children. And so he said, "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life. And there's only one form of eternal life, and that's God himself." &gt;&gt; And so for God that eternal life so loved the world that he gave, what did he give? He gave himself. He gave his only begotten son. And when the son when the word became flesh, that was the divine spoken word creation of God. And it and it formed itself in the womb of a predestinated seed. Now, I want you not to pass that by right that statement. It formed itself in that in that womb of that predestinated seed. And she brought forth not of herself, not of Joseph, but a predestinated word that God himself brought himself, created himself, and God became son among us, unveiled himself as the word made flesh. And he's still the same today. &gt;&gt; Not the same stature, but the same word made flesh. And so, for God so loved the world that and his love projected, what did he do? He gave his only begotten son &gt;&gt; that whosoever believeth in him now that's speaking to you is speaking to me that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life or everlasting life. For God sent his son not into the world to condemn the world. God sent not his son, excuse me, into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him, and he's here today. And that's our commission that the world through him, his body, &gt;&gt; life proceeding from the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that whosoever believeth in him should be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned. That condemned is judged. For he took our judgment at Calvary. He took all our judgment. So he that believeth on him is not condemned. But he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name. That name is not an I was. That name is I am &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ who believeth on his believe in his name of the only begotten son of God. And this is condemnation or judgment that light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because the light exposed their deeds. In other words, the Bible said because their deeds were evil. For everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light that his deeds should be reproved or corrected. But he that doeth truth, notice, doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be manifest, that they are wrought or brought about or brought forth from God. Amen. I'd like you to go with me now to St. John 5, just a few another page or two over. St. John 5 and verse 24. Verily, verily or surely, surely, I say unto you, he that heareth my word. Now, that's that there's a difference in hearing here and hearing from your heart. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is speaking about hearing it from the heart. &gt;&gt; First, it has to come through here, but then it depends on what's in the heart, whether it's received or not. And so, that's the true hearing is able to receive. And so verily I say unto you, he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath past tense. That word hath is past tense. Hath everlasting life. And shall not come into condemnation. Here it is again, judgment. But is passed from death. That word death there is an eternal separation. Has passed from death unto life. And then I want you to go with me to First Peter. And I'll let you be seated here. 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 23. Being born again. Verse 23. 1 Peter 1:23. Being born again. And that's spiritual birth. That's not a born again in the physical. That's a spiritual birth that happens in the soul. &gt;&gt; Because before you were ever spirit or became a man flesh, you were soul. Amen. So being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. How? By the word of God. You may be seated. Amen. You see there there's something happened. We weren't we weren't meant to come this way because life was there but they were given a command of the word which they did not keep and by that brought death to the human race. Every ambulance, every dead child, everything that happened was because of one person disbelieving the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just one little sentence of the word. So see God's word is perfect. You can't add to that. You can't take from it. It's perfect. And so, and so we see here then death entered the human race. You weren't meant to come this way, but you came anyway. Then God had to provide a way out of that trap. And he did. He gave himself. &gt;&gt; God did. &gt;&gt; Because no man was worthy to die for another. Everybody's born of sin through sexual birth. And there's no ability that we have to to pick another up and bring him out of sin. So, it took one that was perfect. It took one that was sinless. So it took a perfect blood. And because it was shown from the beginning, Abel offered a sacrifice that God received and that was shed blood. And so by the shed blood, and God's never changed his mind, God can't change his mind. So through the shedding of blood, a perfect blood, it looses those that were believing in him, that were his seed, his children. And so they they were loosed. And you're loosed this morning if you can receive it by perfect blood. Amen. has loosed us, has set us free. Therefore, there's no condemnation to them that are that walk that there's no condemnation to them that are that that are in Christ who walketh not after the flesh, but after the spirit. Amen. And so, here we are. So, I want to speak on the title and I and I'll just go as far as the Lord will allow me to here this morning. And I may have to pick it up. I don't know. But I just let the Holy Spirit have his way. We said we want we sang. I believe that with all my heart. That song was inspired of God to be sung here this morning. Do we want him to have his way or don't we? &gt;&gt; You're either going to have your way or his way. &gt;&gt; Now, we want to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit. We want him to have his way. &gt;&gt; It's too late down the season to have your own way. We might as well, as I spoke on Wednesday, let's let's crucify and deny the idol of ourself. &gt;&gt; Let's accept what God has done. Lay down our past. Your past has nothing to do with where you're at right now. You've already done past that past. &gt;&gt; So, quit thinking that you're not able to do or to keep the word of God. That's a lie of the devil. Because if something pulling in you to surrender your life, it shows when there's a deep calling to the deep, there's somehow God has to provide something to satisfy that call or you wouldn't be calling for it. &gt;&gt; If there's a thirst in your heart, there's something you're thirsting for or you wouldn't have a thirst. There's got to be something out there to satisfy that thirst. &gt;&gt; So I ask you this morning, why are you here? Did you come here to be seen? Did you come here as a lodge? Is it just it's something to do or did you come here with a burden and and call in your heart to meet God? &gt;&gt; That's what we want. Amen. Amen. So, so my title is the real gift unveiled. The real gift unveiled. Something someone is going to make it home. There's got to be a bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This message didn't go out for just to be going out. This message went out to take a bride that was elected and that election had nothing to do with you and I. God forneew and by fornowledge could elect &gt;&gt; because he knew what you would do. He knew who you were. Amen. &gt;&gt; And by that he could elect a bride because it was his heart purpose. Now I want you to hold that word purpose because we're coming into the scripture here. It was his purpose to have a bride. Can you understand that? That God, an eternal God, the creator of heavens and earth, had a had a part of him, a an attribute that had to be expressed to be a husband, &gt;&gt; to be a son, to be a savior, &gt;&gt; to be a healer, to be a peacegiver, to be a a deliverer, to to and on and on we could go about his attributes. And we think things are all out of cater. Well, why would he allow the devil to come down and deceive Eve? Well, because those attributes had to be expressed, but he couldn't make them fall, but he gave them a choice. &gt;&gt; But God knowing that there would be people sitting right here this morning that by God has been given an ear to hear the word for their season. Just like every season, there's been a word for every season. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll come into that as we go on. But my title is the real gift unveiled. Unveiled means it's been it's opened up. It's revealed. &gt;&gt; And so and my subject is the personalized secret. So there's a secret somebody somewhere individual and it's an individual affair truly &gt;&gt; that has this secret and holding this secrets that's been unveiled. They're different because Jesus too was that seed revealed. Right? &gt;&gt; And he was the fullness of the godhead bodily. And because of that, I say, if you are his son or child, where were you when he came to the earth? Where were you when he went to Calvary? Where were you? You were in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were in him. You took the judgment of God that you should have received in him. &gt;&gt; He bore it for you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so you see, it's the work. The work is finished. When he said it's finished, healing's finished. Salvation's finished, he now has to go forth and manifest what he's declared is finished. He said, "I'll have a bride. I'll have a wife and she is a part of me and I poured my life out to her that my life would come in her and she would recognize where she stands." &gt;&gt; And that's what the message of this hour. We say message come by because God promised it. That's why the message has come &gt;&gt; because he said that the what's been sealed in the book that God had as a secret in his mind has now been unveiled has now been revealed and someone it didn't go out just to be going out. Someone has the ability of God by grace his grace and through his faith to accept it and believe it and it becomes flesh again in the form of his bride. He does. And so we see it's a personalized secret. Christ in you. Now that scripture we'll we can we can read it. We'll read it I if we have time here this morning. The personalized secret Christ in you. I other words identifying you and him. Christ in you. His word has become personalized which is Christ in you. Identifying you. You know the whole thing today is you got to have identification. You can't even cross the border without identification. You can't get in an airline without identification. You can't do certain certain things uh dealing with banking without identification. Who are you? Where'd you come from? Who are you? What's your name? Well, when the bride realizes where she come from. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She'll begin to realize who she is. &gt;&gt; And when she re and because of knowing who she is, then she knows where she's going. She knows what's at the end of the road. If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one waiting. Eternal, &gt;&gt; not natural, but eternal &gt;&gt; in the heavens. We should have entered that to begin with, but we had to bypass that. But it was never taken away. We still have a body waiting for us, a young body. &gt;&gt; We have loved ones that have crossed over, real believers. My mother and father, they're in young bodies. They never will be old again. &gt;&gt; They can't be old again. They've already they've already fought the good fight of faith. They've stood with the word. They've stood on the word. And there they are in eternal bodies that we had a prophet go over and see and come back and told us what that mystery was. &gt;&gt; That would fulfill the scripture. &gt;&gt; And you say, "How do you know it's right?" Because none of us been wrong. &gt;&gt; There's never been anything that he saw and would vision and told us about that ever was wrong. &gt;&gt; So, how could be anything be perfect? How could a man be that perfect? It can't be. It's God. using that man and the word coming through a prophet as he said he would do. &gt;&gt; So we have no question of who it is among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. It's not taking the man. It's not following. Paul said, "Follow me as I follow Christ." We refer to Paul. We refer to all those men. So we're referring to a word, the word of God that came to a prophet in this day that vindicate God vindicated to be his own word and the interpretation of the word for this day. Then why not follow it? It's vindicated to be God's word. God himself working through a human vessel. God never changed his way. If he worked through man yesterday, he's got to work through men today. &gt;&gt; That's why we have a five-fold ministry. That's why we have apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists. It's not them. It's God working through them. That's his channel. &gt;&gt; We're not asking you to receive man nor lift up a man, but lift up the word. It's the word that God comes and brings to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're talking about the real gift unveiled. And this this message even this morning is for the bride. Now, I don't know whose bride and who isn't. I don't need to know, but I need to know myself. Am I one of them? &gt;&gt; Has God brought such an identification that you individually can know who you are and where you're standing? Are you standing on his word? Are you in the word? Are you a believer that believes the word? Were you a believer to begin with? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you weren't a believer in Christ and his thinking, existing in his thoughts as a believer then a part of him, how will you be a believer today? &gt;&gt; See, not everybody that says Lord, Lord, is going to enter in. But he that doeth the will, the will is his word, doeth the will of the father. What is the will? To obey his command. If you love me, you'll keep my word. That's what they failed in the beginning. They didn't keep the word. &gt;&gt; But it's going to come down the end when God's going to have a people that will believe this word &gt;&gt; because he's already provided the way and put his life and spirit in you that you may do and be a doer of that word and believe it and can't deny it. &gt;&gt; Because that which is in you, Christ cannot disbelieve nor deny the word. You may have all kinds of feelings out here. You may fail out here. But that word can't fail. &gt;&gt; And when you pass from death into life, you are held completely by that word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. All right. So, we see here. Now, let's go. So, this this message morning is for the bride, showing her who or what she is. This we get through here. If it takes two Sundays, it'll take two Sundays, but we'll get through it to realize who you are and what she is. &gt;&gt; And that ought to that ought to bring that little bride right up to right up to right up to going here. It it will it will just absolutely excite you, revelate you, and stimulate you &gt;&gt; because this is this is this is where our position is. This is how he has positionally placed his little bride in him before the world began. And now we see it being manifest. It's one thing that he promised it. We see we see great events that made clear by prophecy. Even had a prophet preach that message. Modern events made clear by prophecy. But now it's gone beyond the prophecy to seeing the prophecy manifested. &gt;&gt; We're seeing the the events that were made clear by prophecy. now seeing the prophecy manifested. Brother, sister, we're not living back here in 1963 and 65. We're 60 62 years down the road here. Where are you standing now? &gt;&gt; This message has been developing and growing in the formation of a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why does that have to be? Because there has to be a finish to that climax of that creation. Adam had a bride. The bride was a part of him and come from him. And Jesus Christ had a bride that went to him with Calvary. His side was opened and a bride has come out of him to fulfill the scripture to bring it back to an Eden again. And this is where we're at because we're at the end time &gt;&gt; and we're about ready to step off into Eden. I don't know where that last one is. I pray this morning that if there's a last one here that hasn't come to that realization of their position, may they see it. May they rejoice in it. May all may that light just come on and that mystery that's in you be unveiled. That word, that stone of revelation of himself become you. And you realize I am that living stone. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about first Peter 2, that living stone. He said it would be in us a living stone. Elect, precious. Amen. Yeah. That would be a stumbling to some people, but they don't realize where they're at because they don't realize this is the day the Lord has made &gt;&gt; and we'll be glad in it. Rejoice in it. So, it ought to rejoice your heart. If you're predestinated to see this message, I don't say that's not because I I'm talking about the message of the hour. It will rejoice your soul and you won't have any more question because you'll see, oh, that's where I'm at. That's what I am. That's the identification. So, we're talking about a real gift. &gt;&gt; There is a real gift. There's all kinds of gifts, but there is a real gift. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Unveiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're talking about him being personalized to you individually. &gt;&gt; I want you to turn with me to Ephesians chapter 1. Now, I want to while you're turning there, I want to take what the meaning of personalize means. first line being designated or prod or or produced to meet someone's individual requirements. [clears throat] So something that's personalized is given to designate or or produce to meet and that someone is you your need and requirement. Who could provide that? We couldn't. We couldn't provide it. He provided it. He provides our salvation. He does it. It's all his achieving. He know He knows you're helpless. There isn't a man born on earth that's good. There is none good. The Bible said there is none good. There's none that do good. &gt;&gt; Don't look to a man. Don't look to your your own self because it's none good because you're nothing to begin with. You were born into this earth earthly defeated &gt;&gt; and you had to have a savior. &gt;&gt; And so who matters and what matters is the word becoming alive in your soul. being born again of his spirit, you've passed from death unto life. That becomes your absolute. The word becomes your absolute. And it's not off here somewhere in some church or some lodge. It's dwelling in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. All right. So, so we see here Ephesians 1:3 it says, "Blessed be the God and father." Who is your God and father? Our Lord Jesus Christ. who hath blessed us hath already blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. &gt;&gt; All right. So according as he hath already past tense chosen us. He already hath already before the world began chose us in himself. &gt;&gt; See you've already done made it. &gt;&gt; You just have to realize it. And the reason how you realize it is the word of faith is being preached to you and that's how you realize it. The word for the season. You didn't come in another season. You're here today. &gt;&gt; And so in your season now, when you hear the word preach, there's got to be something inside of your soul that either can accept it or it rejects it. &gt;&gt; It's not the man's word. It's not my thoughts. It's not even brother Brandon's thoughts. It's God's thoughts &gt;&gt; that he hid in the word here for the season being unveiled &gt;&gt; because there was a secret. There were secrets unveiled that could not be loosed until this hour by the Revelation 10 message of the seventh angel. He had he held that it was the sword was in his hand to loose or unloose what's been sealed up in God's mind and would be unveiled to the bride for her to go home. Now, there's nobody but nobody except you be born again. And the only ones that can be truly born again is the bride of Christ because the seed is in her. &gt;&gt; And so, she's the only one that can be born again. And when she and they that are born again are holders of this secret. &gt;&gt; All right. So we see here then according as he had hath chosen us in him before when before not when you did good works not by your thinking you didn't come here you came here didn't know how to find him you weren't seeking for him you weren't looking for him he comes and finds you and he's I trust he's finding you this morning he's the one that found you never found him you weren't looking for him you didn't have the desire to look for him but there's inside of you a seed planted &gt;&gt; that's The thing that found you, &gt;&gt; he found it. He finds you. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he chose you. St. John 15:16. He You haven't chosen me, but I chose you. &gt;&gt; Now, just stop and think about that. He chose you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He chose you. You don't have to look to man and say, "Well, I'm identified this way. I wish I could be that way." He made you just the way you are to be and to manifest him in just the pattern, just the way, just the portion he gave to you to fill that portion of his body. &gt;&gt; If you're a little cell, you're no you're no less than the eye or the ear or the mind or the tongue. You're no less than the heart that beats. You are a part of the body. And without that, he's not complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so you we go here and see we see in verse in verse he chose us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Who is love? He is love. God is love. The eternal is love. God in you is eternal. God manifested in you showed you were in him in the eternal before the world began. And that's how you have love because he first loved you. you. It's not you producing it. He's already said, "I love you." before the world began. And therefore, that's the only way you could truly love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God is love. That eternal spirit is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, so verse five, having predestinated us. That word's a big word, but it simply means he predestined you to be here. Knew you would be here. Ordained the word to meet you. You didn't you didn't know. Here you are just walking along and and all of a sudden you meet the word and the word does something in your heart just because you were that to begin with. &gt;&gt; Just like the e little eagle put under a chicken when he was hatched because of the atmosphere. The egg was hatched but he couldn't understand the clucking of the of the chicken. I brought this Wednesday so I won't dwell on that. But why did he not understand the chicken? Because he wasn't a chicken. &gt;&gt; Why did he understand the eagle that came flying over? because he was that to begin with. &gt;&gt; You can't make yourself something the different than what you are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're that to begin with. You're the word to begin with. And God can only bring forth of its kind. Whatever seed it is that's been planted in the ground and the farmers know right well if you put that corn seed in the ground, you expect to receive corn because it's going to bring forth of its kind because that's the life in it. Well, if the seed of God's in you, what are you going to bring forth? You'll bring forth the word every time. the word for the season. &gt;&gt; Then God's obligated to search for that word &gt;&gt; because he chose you in himself. He can't lose you. If he loses you, he loses a part of himself and he can't lose that part of himself because it's eternal. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now &gt;&gt; having predestinated us unto the adoption, that word adoption means the placing of children. That's what we're speaking about. By Jesus Christ to what? Himself. Not to a church, not to a church entity, not to a group, but to himself. Amen. To himself. &gt;&gt; By Jesus Christ. By Jesus Christ, which is himself made flesh. To himself according to the good pleasure. Good pleasure of whose will? yours. No. To the pleasure of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not your will. It's his will. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the praise of the glory of his grace. That grace is given to you by divine enabling enabling you to receive his will. &gt;&gt; He you didn't produce it. You never He by grace gave it freely. He by grace did it for you already because you needed it. He could do it. So he provided it. That's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us already he already hath past tense made us accepted in the beloved which is Jesus Christ himself our Lord. All right. &gt;&gt; In whom? There again. In whom. In him we have redemption through his blood. What's redemption? Calling back. Buying back &gt;&gt; by purchase what he owned. Amen. What he had already had. See, he had you already. You think, well, I I I He already got you. He's already had you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's calling you for what? Let go and let me have my way. Now his way is perfect. Your way is not perfect. Your way, human way, carnal way is the way of death. His way is eternal life. Amen. So let him have his way. He's perfect in all his ways. He can't be imperfect. If he's imperfect, he fails. His word can't fail. Heavens and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. &gt;&gt; And because you were in him to begin with, you're a part of himself, the word. Then how are you going to pass away? You're ordained. I don't care if you have to take you and strangle you to get you to it. He'll do it &gt;&gt; to bring you to himself &gt;&gt; because he's not going to miss what he's ordained. I can't. The Bible said I can't lose them. All the father has given me will come and I cannot lose them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the father which gave them them me he said is is overall and how can I lose them because I and my father are one. &gt;&gt; See there's not a trinity involved here. It's God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. I've got to press on. to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made accepted in the beloved, in whom we have redemption through the blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known, isn't this beautiful? Where do you see yourself doing anything in works here? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "Wherein," see, having made, now watch this scripture very closely, "Having made known unto us the secret &gt;&gt; of his will, the mystery of his will, according to his good," whose pleasure? His good pleasure &gt;&gt; which he hath purposed. Now, I want you to hold that purpose because God has a heart purpose that he wanted to achieve. And he hath purposed. This is this is what he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times which we are now in. He might gather together in one, not in two, not the father and the son, two different individual. No, in one that he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him. Praise the Lord. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So you see this being personalized is a it's it's identifiable as belonging to a particular person especially by being marked with their name. And so our name been changed. Abraham's name had to be changed. Our name is being changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we have now united. And when we're birth, our name is changed. When Jacob held on and wouldn't let go of that one that he wrestled with until he his until he had victory over that and his name was changed. Then a then a then you have conquered. Amen. A victory has been had. Now you're not going forth to fight and try to get victory. Why? Because you already have victory, bride. You are victory. You are the victory. You are that victory in him. You are his victory because you are his word made manifest. &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] To personify and we'll come to that quote after a while. Maybe not today, but we will come back to that. Personify is something especially a deity or spirit. Other words, he personifying by personalizing himself in you. He is personifying himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. in the bride form. Now, just hold that because you say, "I don't understand that." Well, it's all right. Just hold to it. Romans 6:23. [snorts] Amen. The book of Romans, chapter 6, verse 23. Very simple verse. You probably learned it from a a child. Amen. Just like John 3:16. But it holds a mystery. &gt;&gt; For the wages of sin is death. Now, if you want to get right down what it is, sin is unbelief. Unbelief of the word of God. You know, to do good and don't do it, that is iniquity. And sin is unbelief. Unbelief of the word. The reason you do things out here and the world does things, smoking, drinking, prostitution, all these other things going on, all these evil things is because they don't believe the word. Now when they come face to face with the word, if they reject the word, then that seals it off, if they reject it, &gt;&gt; but if they can receive it. Amen. Then that is wiped away. You never were a sinner to begin with. But sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; And and you say, "How do you say you weren't a sinner?" Because he that's born of God, and we're coming into that, does not commit sin. because the seed of God remainth in him and he cannot sin. Now, I'm talking about the birth born of God. The reason you can be born of God, this is what we're trying to get across here this morning or these services is that to be born of God, something's got to be in you already. &gt;&gt; It's just not everybody can be born of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we're talking about a real gift here. All right. Now, so the wages of sin is death. That death is not death in the flesh. That's an eternal separation from God. The wages of sin, that's wages. You're working every day as hard as you can. If you won't accept the word of God, you're working the hardest you can to die. &gt;&gt; You're going one way or the other. Are you either going upward or you're going downward? &gt;&gt; You see how the word does a separating? &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that does separating. The word of God will always separate. &gt;&gt; It separates truth from air, truth from a lie, death to life, it separates it. Light and darkness, it separates it. Let there be light. spoken word manifest right there. Spoken word, original seed. And there was light. &gt;&gt; So it separated light from darkness. Amen. All right. And so you're sitting here receiving and hearing a word that will separate light from darkness. &gt;&gt; It's speaking beyond your physical being, your mental. It's speaking down in your soul. That's what this message will do. The message of the hour will do. The message this morning will do. It will separate you. Amen. &gt;&gt; To life, &gt;&gt; dark light. The Bible said in Isaiah 60:1, "Arise, shine." Speaking to you and I, "For thy light is come." I just read it here. Men love darkness rather than light because the light exposed their deeds. It manifests what's in their heart. But if what if light comes on your scene and it manifests something, then right then the love of God is shown to you. Because when light doth make manifest the air, you have a choice to make. You can either accept right, accept the truth, accept the God who exposed it, or stay where you're at &gt;&gt; and deny it. Now, that's exactly where every one of us, including myself, I'm just a preacher. I'm preaching it. I'm not responsible for how you react or whether you can get it or not. I'm responsible for bringing it. I have to It's given to me. I've got to do the same as you. Yes. &gt;&gt; I've got to make my calling in election sure. &gt;&gt; A preacher doesn't mean he's anything. He's a servant to serve his people &gt;&gt; and feed them the word for the season, not another season. If I was up here preaching and speak and preaching the word of Pentecost, which is another season, I would be out of order. But when I come preaching what's here 62 years later after a prophecy of the word turning from the prophet to his prophecy and see the prophecy manifest if I don't preach that to you I'm not preaching the word for the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. So St. John 14. So we see then it's death but the gift of God. Watch this verse in here on 23rd verse. For the gift of God is eternal life. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that steady. The gift singular gift. The gift of God is eternal life. Other words, it's God. &gt;&gt; The gift of God is God himself. If you've thoroughly repented and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, taking that name publicly, showing that you believe what he did for you, the Bible said you shall receive the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God knows your heart. He knows what you came up there for. He knows whether you were sincere in doing it. He knows whether you realize you're a sinner and turned around and made a 180°ree turn and repented. And when you're willing to accept that and say, "I believe him and I'm willing to live for him." And you take that baptism, which is just a a natural act. Water does not save you. You believe in the blood. And reason you take that baptism because you're taking it in the very life which he is in his name. &gt;&gt; And you shall receive the gift. Say, "How do you know, brother David? I've got it. It works. &gt;&gt; It's positive. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; But there going to be a lot of them go down wet ones and come up go down dry ones in baptism. Come up wet ones because they haven't really repented. Haven't really got the got the revelation that Jesus Christ took their iniquity and all their sin and took it to on the head and put it on the head of the devil. And through his blood and his blood only were you delivered. You've come to the blood. If you've come to the blood, what do you expect to receive? The life of it. Because on the other side of that is that shakina glory is that power of God himself down in there in your soul. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, St. John 14. [snorts] St. John 14. [clears throat] And we'll read verse 20. At that day, now isn't that a strange statement that Jesus speaking of another day. Where was he speaking down to? If you flow follow through the scriptures, he was speaking of our day &gt;&gt; at that day. Think Jesus knew you. Isn't it lovely to know? You can even go to St. John 17 and realize Jesus prayed for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can find it right in the scripture. Every one of you can go back in the scripture and see where Jesus prayed for you. &gt;&gt; You think his prayer will be answered? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; You see? See, so we find then that in this day, another day, at that day, you he's speaking of ye and ye is you. Are there any Yees here? Certainly. That's you, an individual. Ye shall know. You shall not imagine. You're not going to hope. So, it's something that will be revealed to you by grace. &gt;&gt; You shall know that I am in my father. So, where was his identification? His father in his father. And where was his father? I'm in my father, ye in me, and I'm in you. Then if he's identified by the father, where was the father? It was in him. &gt;&gt; I'm in my father, my father in me, I in you. Who is that I then speaking? It's the same person, the same God. I in you and you in me. &gt;&gt; It's going to be unveiled. The mystery, the secret will be unveiled. You always were in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. Now, [snorts] you have not chosen me, but I've chosen you. Now, according to the word of God, the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world. And the choosing of the bride, watch, was purposed in himself. Ephesians 1:9. So, the purposing wasn't your purpose. It was already purposed in him. I'm going to have a bride of my choosing. &gt;&gt; If he said he was going to have a bride, do you think that word's going to be fulfilled? It's got to be fulfilled. Every word's got to be fulfilled. And here am I and here in you, born of his spirit, fulfilling that scripture. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yes. All right. Now, so in Romans 9:11, it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand. It's not the person that it's not David out here, David that come predestinated eternally from God. Though he knew it before the foundation world, what color hair have, what I'd look like, my stature, and all about it. But that's not what comes predestinated eternally. That's not what was in God to begin with eternally. It's the thought that he had and the seed that he expressed that thought into word that was the seed that's what comes from God eternally. &gt;&gt; Now he said in in Romans nine, Jacob I loved and Esau hated. How come he could say one he loved and the other he hated when neither boy was born? Neither had done good works or evil works. How could he say Jacob I love? knowing Jacob would be there, how he would be born through through appearance, through a sexual birth. But there's something in Jacob's soul that he already knew was there. And that was his seed. He planted it there. Other words, he predestinated eternally that seed to be in Jacob. &gt;&gt; And Jacob came with that seed. And Esau, he said, I hated because Esau did not believe the word. Sold his birthright, would not accept the word. And so we have many Esau today. They won't accept it either. Neither have they in any age. &gt;&gt; There's always been unbelievers. There's always been real true believers. And there's some that just make believe. &gt;&gt; They aren't sold out to Christ. They're just make believers. Well, we'll accept the message. We'll make it a religion. We have it as a religion, as something we can do. We can come to church. We can do that. I've done my service. No. That will not save you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You might as well just right now know that cannot save you. never will save you. Never did save anybody. But I believe in going to church. If you really love the Lord, you want to be where the word is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that in itself will not save. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's only one place at salvation and that's in Jesus Christ, the revealed word for your day and time. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You either can respond positively to that or negative. You've come right. You've come in contact with it. Now, what will you do with this Jesus called Christ that was, that is, now, and will be? &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with him? You leave out of this tabernacle, he's on your hands. He's on my hands. He's on every one of our hands. What are you going to do with him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Today, the traditions of man have crucified him. Aresh right from the very pulpits of denominationalism which was not of God. &gt;&gt; Never was, never will be. &gt;&gt; God never formed a denomination, never had one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. I got off a little track here. Let's pick it up again. So, the purpose of God is being manifest according to election. You can't read it any other way. The heart purpose of the eternal or the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing. And that purpose was in himself. And being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world. Before there was ever a speck of stardust, before God was even God. You say, "How can that be?" He's eternal spirit. God, the word God is an object of worship. You can worship anything. As I said Wednesday, you can worship yourself. &gt;&gt; So God is an object of worship, but he had nothing to worship him. For the first thing he created were angels and they worshiped him. &gt;&gt; Then he became God. &gt;&gt; But before God, he's still that eternal spirit had no beginning and no end. Now you in your own carnal finite mind, in your little pea brain, my pa brain, we cannot comprehend what eternal is. We never will until we're step into that body. &gt;&gt; But it never had a beginning and never has an end. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you just love to be tested by the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what happens, what it if you put whatever your case is in God's hands and stand by that word, God is going to fulfill it and manifest it in his time and his season. &gt;&gt; I don't care what struggles you're going through. I don't care how much pressure is on you. Put it in God's hands. Just put it in his hand. That's what Job had to do. He put it in God's hands. You know, God has two hands. He has a right hand and a left hand. Job said, "I see him on the left hand doing his work. And the right hand, I can't find him. But the right hand is what holds you. The left hand is working daily, bringing you to right where you should be by revelation." &gt;&gt; Amen. You're in his hands, brother, sister. You're you're either in his hands or you're not in his hands. And if you're in his hands, you were in his hands to begin with. You can't produce enough works to get in his hands. You either already were or you're not. And it depends on your attitude right here this morning about the word that's being preached to you can determine to you your eternal destiny. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to know your thoughts. God does. &gt;&gt; You say, "That's straightforward. You might as well preach it straight." Amen. &gt;&gt; Why jump around the bend with it? &gt;&gt; That's true. That's right. &gt;&gt; Am I afraid of somebody disagreeing with it? No, I'm not afraid of somebody disagreeing with it. Is the word going to offend going to not offend anybody? Nonsense. The word the word brought forth in this season will offend someone. &gt;&gt; It always has. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't offend the believer. &gt;&gt; I don't have an I don't have an an a something in my heart to offend you. I'll just be a smart and I'll offend you. No, that's not If that was in my heart, I need an altar. &gt;&gt; I have nothing but love in my heart to tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't preach it like brother Paul. Paul can't preach it like me. I can't preach it like the next man over here. They each one have their position in place. And his ministry will differ &gt;&gt; in how they produce and how they bring forth the word. But they serve one person. &gt;&gt; Every member of that body serves one person, one individual, one headship. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they can't bring it something that's contrary to the word for the hour and the season. &gt;&gt; If you're true seed of God, you will recognize and hear the word for your season 62 years down the line. &gt;&gt; Where are we at now? What is the season? What's happening? &gt;&gt; Are we just floating around? I believe God sent a prophet. Brother, sister, that's that's unpassed. You might as well just recognize something right now. That prophet had a message. And the message is right here, right now, manifesting what he said he would do. &gt;&gt; And besides that, the Bible said that the bride is the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; What voice? The same voice. &gt;&gt; She recognizes her season and declares it and preaches it and lives it. &gt;&gt; And she's counted an oddball. She's counted a radical. She's counted everything in the book. What difference does that make? God loves me &gt;&gt; and I love him. &gt;&gt; If I loved him, I'm gonna keep his word because that's dominant. That's absolute. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, [snorts] so before there was a a speck of stardust, he chose his own bride was purposed in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world and before a speck of stardust. Before God was God, he was known only as an eternal spirit. The bride, that's you and I this morning, right here, the bride was already in his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She was existing. In other words, she was substance in him, not just an imagination. It was faith in him. &gt;&gt; And being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world. And she was existing in his mind. And what about those thoughts of God that you are? They are eternal. Are they not? Down through the centuries we go. We find a Moses. We find a Jeremiah, a John, a Baptist, John the Baptist. Each one of those were God's eternal thoughts expressed in his season. Then we come to Jesus the logos. Now don't be stumbled by that word. What you have here is a written word called remma. But in behind this letter is a thought. &gt;&gt; That's hidden behind this letter. And that is logos. &gt;&gt; That was before this was even in print. God spoke the word. Amen. And the word was manifested. Job didn't have the Bible we have, but he had the &gt;&gt; logos. &gt;&gt; He knew the word. He knew who he was and he worshiped. And all that he did know, God revealed it to him. God Job had the mind of God for his season and his time and he expressed it and he lived it &gt;&gt; and he struggled with it and he suffered through it and he suffered with it. But in the end, &gt;&gt; what happened? Same thing is going to happen to you if you hold to this promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, so you see here that the logos. Then we come to Jesus. He uh St. John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. We've come to Jesus which was the perfect and complete thought of God expressed and he became known as the word. In other words, Jesus was the the complete Godhead bodily. The fullness of God bodily. Everything God had in his heart, everything he had in his mind, his bride, everything was expressed in Jesus Christ. So therefore, you being his seed was in him. Then &gt;&gt; then the sin question is finished. The sick question is finished. It's all finished. &gt;&gt; Who's able to take the word and say it's finished? Who's able to say, "I put it in your hands because I believe what you said." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, we find him then the complete expression and he became known as the word. That's what he is. He is not was that's what he was, but that's what he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And forever will be. He's the I was and is and shall come. Revelations 1 speaks of that same person in his full revelation of himself. He which was which is and shall come. &gt;&gt; There were where were you? You was you is and you are going to be &gt;&gt; to come the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Who's spiritual enough that can say amen to that? Whether you understand it or not, it's still the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? It's the truth. &gt;&gt; That which is and forever will be. Now it says he hath chosen us in him. Jesus, he's chosen us in him. &gt;&gt; How you going to lose? Do you think God's going to choose you in him then throw you out? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He's not an Indian giver. &gt;&gt; He chose you. He's going to keep you. &gt;&gt; And it's up to him to do it. &gt;&gt; It's only up to you to believe. &gt;&gt; And that determines what's in you. Because if you're a part of him, you will believe. You can't deny it. I don't care how many things you have to go through. I don't care how much the outside thinks differently. You You're a dual person. You have two natures. You've got one nature inside of you. You're born again. Is the nature of the word himself. It's himself. You have an outside man that's carnal, sticky. It's going to bother you because we're born of sin. &gt;&gt; They come in the world in sin, shaped in iniquity, speaking lies. It's not this that's born again. It's that soul where I came from. God saw that and produced that birth. And that birth will take me to the change of this body. That's the power. That's the revelation. That's the rapture that's going on right now that's going to take me to that body change &gt;&gt; because that word is growing in the formation. It's growing in a bride to a full stature of himself. The bride is not going to grow up and be perfect someday in the flesh. No, &gt;&gt; it's perfect in him. It grows up in him, becomes him. And what's happening today is the revelation I am him. I'm not another person. The bride's not another person. She is him. &gt;&gt; She's bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh. Just as Eve was bone of Adam, bone, flesh of his flesh. She was him. So is the bride today. Him, Christ, the word in you. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; And Paul said, I live by that word, operate by that word, which workketh in me mightily. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. [snorts] Now, &gt;&gt; now it says that he hath chosen us in him, Jesus. That means you were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God, God's thoughts, God's eternal thoughts before the foundation of the world. That gives an eternal quality to you, the elect. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. Acts 21:17. Let's go over there. I'm going to I'm going to have to close now pretty quick here. And I'm I'm not even hardly started, but I'm going to close. I know you're scared to death. I'm going to go too long. The enemy tried to wear that down me at all day. I said, "I'm not going to hear you, Satan. I'm not going to hear you, but Lord, I'll hear you." &gt;&gt; Amen. I couldn't you if you want me to take another two hours, &gt;&gt; but you're not. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, and I understand that. But let me find a closing place. Okay, give me that much grace. Let me find a closing spot here. Acts 21:17. And I may just have to close on this scripture real close here. Acts 2:17. Now Sundays we have a little better opportunity. Wednesdays is hard. You work, you're here, you're live, you're in the morning. Yeah, brother David. Preach. Don't go past my lunchtime. Okay. You say, "Well, I I'm not, brother David. That's just facitious." No. Let's go real deep. Where's the motive? I'm not judging you. I just know how the devil works. What's the motive and objective? &gt;&gt; Not of your outer man. Oh, I can I don't believe that, brother. Okay. What's down inside? Are you listening to your heart or are you listening to your thinking? All right. Now, you say, "Boy, that was tough." Yeah, it's tough for me, too. It speaks to me. I'm not the only one. What's coming out of my mouth speaks to me. &gt;&gt; I may have one finger out here, but I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven pointed back. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, Acts 21:17 where the day of Pentecost and he said verse 15, for these are not drunken as you suppose, seeing as but the third hour of the day they come busting out of that room. They were filled with the Holy Ghost and the and the promise of Joel was being fulfilled and Peter speaks of it right here. This is prophecy being fulfilled in their season. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand that. What's your season? &gt;&gt; All right. But this is that which was spoken. Other words, this is that which prophet which God spoke through Joel. This is that which spoken by the prophet Joel. This is what he said. And it shall come to pass what God said. It shall come to pass in the last days, sayaith God, I will pour out my spirit upon all, say it, &gt;&gt; flesh. I'm going to pour out my spirit upon all the ground. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that because the spirit that was poured out was the Holy Spirit here. was poured out upon all flesh. And your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams, [snorts] &gt;&gt; and upon my servants, and on my handmaids, I'll pour out of those days of my spirit. Then they shall prophesy. That's a gift. And they will show wonders. They can do that by the spirit. And at heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath, blood, fire, and vapor smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord. We know that's happening. &gt;&gt; Not only did it, but it does. These are signs. And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Here there's signs going out. There's wonders. All done by the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Anybody disagree with that? Every gift, everything was ordained and ordered of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? And this spirit fell upon all flesh and and there would be people do that and do those things and never know the word for the season. &gt;&gt; And you say, "How can that be?" It's the Holy Spirit being poured out. Is that right? That's the mystery &gt;&gt; and that's what I want to get into and I don't have time to do it, but I'm laying a foundation. And if that's all I can lay here this morning, then I lay the foundation. So we go to to Matthew 5:45. This is where it's poured out. Now, let's go back to Matthew a minute and go to Matthew the 5th chapter and the 45th verse. That you may be the children of your father which is in heaven. For he maketh his son. His son. Who's his son? You say, "Well, that's natural son." He's saying the natural typing the spiritual here. For he maketh his son to rise on the evil. Oh, now wait a minute. His son to rise on the evil and the good. And he sendeth rain. Son was him and rain was his spirit. Both are him. and he maketh his son and and he on the good and sendeth rain on the just. Now you say, "Well, that's natural." But the word just and unjust is not a natural thing. Now Jesus turned it around and said, "This is a spiritual thing I'm pouring out." What is he pouring out upon it? The same rain that fell upon all flesh. Amen. Now, now this is the mystery. So the mystery, if it's a mystery in this hour, had to be made known. &gt;&gt; It had to be unveiled. It had to be revealed. &gt;&gt; That mystery. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Okay. So we see then he poured out his rain. He poured out his spirit upon all flesh. Nothing wrong with the spirit. The spirit is genuine. I'm going to come into some pretty potent things. as the prophet said and you just God bear with me and I trust you come back. You want to hear the rest of the story as we go on here. I'm going to find a place to quit and on the and and it falls upon the just. The rain and the sun both fall are come upon the just and the unjust. What's just mean? Justified. God's declared you're righteous because you were a part of him and knew him and he knew you before the foundation of the world. And therefore, you're justified as though you never sinned in the first place. &gt;&gt; You never sinned before the beginning. He saw you perfect because you were in him. &gt;&gt; All right? So, the sun shining, those things are brought to mature the seed. So whatever the seed was in the ground, &gt;&gt; whether it's just or unjust, that same Holy Ghost, will bring forth both. &gt;&gt; And that's what we're seeing happen today because maturity is upon us. &gt;&gt; We've laid in the presence 62 years down here. What's happening? that spirit, the Holy Spirit himself, a genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit can fall. I'm going to go a little jump ahead a little bit, but it's going to fall upon the just and the unjust. It's going to baptize the unjust. &gt;&gt; And it's going to baptize the just, &gt;&gt; but each seed is going to bring forth of its kind through the period of time. &gt;&gt; Even though they declare they have, see, they declare I believe this message, but they can't live it. By their fruits they're known and the fruit is the fruit for the season where you're at today. &gt;&gt; Are you recognizing the day? Do you recognize? Are you just going back 60 years ago and saying, "Well, wasn't that a wonderful message? We'll lift up that and we'll lift up that and propagate that." That's not saving you at all. &gt;&gt; That's not seed of God at all. The seed of God is in the promise of the word for now &gt;&gt; today. What did that message do? &gt;&gt; What did it start? It started a growth. And not only that, he looked up to heaven and pointed us to the astronomic of heaven and said, "There's a bride. There's an infant bride coming forth &gt;&gt; and the latter rain's going to fall out, which would be the rapturing faith &gt;&gt; upon that bride. Going to bring something that she has in her. And we're going to start a rapture cycle. And it's going to go on until that rapture leaves and goes &gt;&gt; because the bride has come to the realization what she is. &gt;&gt; Now there's a lot of words left right in there. And I'm showing you the pouring out of that. Notice here the life was it was in the husk. So you had you had a wheat plant coming up. It went into the ground. It died under denominationalism. It started coming forth in Luther. Wes Luther justification made way for Wesley's message of sanctification. Wesley's message of sanctification made way for the Pentecostal baptism and restoration of the gifts. &gt;&gt; But what did that bring forth? &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; There was many baptized. Many thought they were born again and are not. &gt;&gt; Because they cannot receive the except the perfect word. the Holy Ghost himself is not made manifest and real in their soul. &gt;&gt; They can go as far as sanctification and it's all right. I'm not saying they're lost, but they'll never make the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that at the judgment sometime they stand before them and because they are saved people, virgins like the foolish virgin, they will receive and get eternal life at that time. But the bride doesn't stand before the white throne judgment. &gt;&gt; She stands in the throne judging. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she's judged right now by an open book. &gt;&gt; She's judged right now by the revelation of that book being open. And there's only a certain number of people. I'm talking You say, "What book?" I'm talking about the marriage certificate. The book, the lamb's book, the book of life. &gt;&gt; Both foolish and wise had the word, but only the wise had the oil. &gt;&gt; They both had the rema. They both knew God sent a prophet. They both knew that he had a message, but only one could hear it. and receive it and enter into marriage. &gt;&gt; They that were ready went into the marriage with him. &gt;&gt; Is that right? With him. &gt;&gt; And that's the mystery. And that's the secret right now is that union, that invisible union is a secret to everyone but the bride. She holds that mystery opened. The life that was in the stock went out to make the other. Justification made way for sanctification. Sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. And the baptism of the Holy Spirit made way for the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost itself, same person to come right down in perfection. &gt;&gt; Back to the word again. Not and both of them. Both of them. Both both the just and the unjust. Both the both the seed and the tear. Satan planted the tear. God planted the wheat. Satan came behind him because he's a perverter and planted in the same ground his seed. &gt;&gt; That's what's happened through these years. Amen. He came right behind him. Then what's taking place? A genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost baptizes them both. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the anointing. They'll both do signs. They'll both do wonders. They'll both scream. They'll both shout. And I'm not a thing against it. I believe in shouting. I believe in signs. I believe in wonders. I believe in gifts of the spirit. But you can have every one of them and not have the word himself dwelling in your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's pretty quiet around here. But that's the truth &gt;&gt; and that's the mystery. In fact, the prophet said we need to teach it &gt;&gt; and talk about it. &gt;&gt; I can bring you right to where he said that. He said, talking about that right there, that mystery, they're both, and I'm going to come to that. I'm going to close. They both come to that genuine baptism. There's not a wrong, there's nothing wrong with that Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; They are both anointed, but one is anointed in the soul because the anointing was sent for his seed. &gt;&gt; Whatever your soul is, that's who you are. &gt;&gt; That's who you are. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; We just begun. This might be a three-part service. All right, I'm going to make a mark here. This is where we ended right here because [snorts] we know the swer of the good seed was the son of man. Look who goes first and look who goes follows. Whatever goes first is original. Whatever follows is a perversion of it. &gt;&gt; Satan is a perverter. He's not a creator. &gt;&gt; The only thing he can do is add to the word or take from it. &gt;&gt; When it leaves that promised original seed, be careful. That's not God. &gt;&gt; You say, why did it bring death? Because there was a there was a subtle instrument called the serpent in the beginning that fed to Eve reasoning about what God said and she accepted it because she first had to receive it in her mind before the act was fulfilled. She had to receive it in her thought first. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; And so receiving that, what did it bring? You tell me. We all know what it brought. It brought death. You say, "Well, then why did Adam have to do that?" He turned around. She turned around and gave to her husband of that tree. Said it's pleasant. Adam knew exactly. The Bible said Adam was not deceived. He came straight from God. Eve was a byproduct of that man. She wasn't in the original creation, but she had the same spirit. Took the spirit, the feminine, out of Adam, became in a form. But you know what God said today? I will restore that form back to myself. And that's your mystery. We were going to come to it. I'll just jump way ahead. That's the mystery of who you are. &gt;&gt; But what did Adam do? He said, why did he have to partake of it if he knew it? He knew when he parttook of that that God said, "Don't do." He knew that all creation would fall beneath him. &gt;&gt; Absolutely, every bit of it. &gt;&gt; But God said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord." And he provided a way through the blood to bring life that would restore us back to our original condition. So where are we facing now? We're facing back to Eden. &gt;&gt; Husband and wife, bride and bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Word coming to word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you say, why did Adam do it? Because he was he was absolutely portraying what Jesus Christ would accomplish at the cross. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Why did Jesus Christ come through a woman? Why did Jesus Christ have to bear our sin? Because it came, the fall came through a woman, but he couldn't come. He had to come the way it should have come originally through a spoken word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's how it came originally. That's what God came to restore. So, he came not born of a woman sexually. Had nothing to do with Joseph. Had nothing to do with Mary. It was he was a spoken word creation. That's why his blood can redeem us and has. [music] &gt;&gt; So what did Adam do in the prefigure? He stood. He took [music] her place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He knew what would happen, but he was showing redemption. He was showing it. Maybe not even knowing what he's doing. But what did he do? He took Eve's sin because if she if he didn't, God would have destroyed her and he stood and took her place. Think of [music] that. And just think what Jesus Christ did for you. He had to come through, not sexually, but he had to come through a woman. Ah, you know, I don't believe that ser. The Bible said the serpent had a seed. &gt;&gt; But where is he today? He's on his belly. Every bone in his body doesn't there's nothing it even resembles. Science cannot find that missing link. &gt;&gt; They would like to but they can't find it because he was able to cohabitate with the woman. His seed would mix but he wasn't human. He was a beast. &gt;&gt; And he was beautiful and he could talk and Satan could speak through him. &gt;&gt; He couldn't come. Satan couldn't come and anoint Adam, but he could come and anoint an animal. Amen. &gt;&gt; That beast. And he did. He spoke right to Eve. Well, didn't God say, "Yes, God has said we'll not touch the tree unless we die." He said, "Oh, but surely you won't die." Because God knows. He's trying to hide something from you. He knows if when you receive that, you're going to know you're going to be like God. They already were gods. Little gods. They came right directly from God. He did. Adam, can you All right. So, what did Adam do? He showed the very thing that Christ would do [music] 4,000 years later at Calvary. And by that, we're able and are redeemed by [music] this precious blood. God bless you. Amen. Amen. I haven't even got to what the [music] re real gift is, and yet I've been speaking all around it. Amen. But I'll get to it again. I don't know about Wednesday, but [music] Lord willing, by Lord willing, I'll preach it next Sunday. I have something on my heart for Wednesday, but we'll see how the Lord leads. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What are you playing? Original life. Are you okay? Well, that's a good song. One of my favorites. Okay. Do you believe in the original life? &gt;&gt; What is it? Original seed. What's in that seed? eternal [music] life. Amen. It's the original life. It's the original word. God's attributes were [music and singing] manifested to his bride in this. Caught the [singing and music] revelation by the last prophet's message. And we know who we are and what we are [music and singing] raised up for. Praise the Lord. for the original life. [singing] The original life, the original seed, the original word that is the seed is what I [music] believe. Jesus Christ is revealed. Seven is [music] himself unveiled. The original life, the original [music] seed. We are the word made flesh today. This is what the scriptures say. And we're are [music] seen within, [singing] redeemed, perfect without sin. Yes, we are [singing and music] anointed and inspired by our God whose original life, [singing] the original life, the original seed, the [music] original word is what I believe. That's what the bride believes is revealed, unveiled. Himself, the secret original life, the original seed. Our eyes of yours, mine has opened up at last, and sweet victory is ours. who were chained down in the past. But true jubilee has sounded and we have you individually are God whose original life, the original life, [music] the original seed, the original word. Yes, that [music] is what I believe. Well, the son of man himself is unveiled. The seventh seal is unveiled. The original life, the original seed. We are called to placing full authority [singing] and power. Sleeping saint will wake and join us very soon. [music] Translation in the we're in the hour. Gentile days will soon [singing] be over. Glory hallelujah to our God. Who's the original life? [music] Well, the original life, the original seed, the original word is what I believe. The son of man is revealed. Seventh seal is unveiled. The original life, the original seed. [music] See, the original seed was God's mind. His thought that you were existing in, that you were a part of himself [music] was expressed and it was made manifest in the fullness of Jesus Christ. [music] For what purpose? To take our place. Just what Adam did. To be crucified, [music] to take death on himself for us and you and I. Amen. All right. You remember last two weeks ago [music] or I think Sunday before last, brother Paul took a message and said, "If thou can't believe, [music] Amen. that son would be healed." And the man [music] said, "Oh God, help my unbelief. I do believe." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. It's the same thing when it [music] comes to salvation. If thou can't believe, &gt;&gt; you are saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. It applies to both. It's a double covenant. It's a double cure. Not only [music] for sickness and health, &gt;&gt; but for salvation of your soul. It's a do a double cure. &gt;&gt; All you have to do if [music] thou can't believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You see, it's unveiled. Brother, sister, the book, the lid's been taken off. The seal been removed. Christ is [music] risen. And we're realizing a bride realizing when he raised, I raised with him. It's finished. I've already raised. [music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. You pray for one another. &gt;&gt; Pray for each other. Pray for me. I'll pray for you. Have been praying. I will pray. We have needs. God knows those needs. But don't you turn your eyes from the word and begin to reason and lift up that idol of yourself. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. you just completely give yourself over to that word because that cannot fail &gt;&gt; and go to [music] confessing it. Don't you take what somebody else says and what the reasoning says and what this one says and this child or this one or that one. Don't you become burdened down by what they think.
