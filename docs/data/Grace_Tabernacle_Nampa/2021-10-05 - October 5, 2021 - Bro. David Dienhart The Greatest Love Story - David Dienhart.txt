not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding there we go sorry how many heard that anybody want me to repeat it okay you want me to repeat it okay isaiah 40 28 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not amen there is no there neither is weary there's no searching of his understanding will he not reveal his word to whom he will you don't have to mentally try to figure it out amen let's stand together this morning i thank the lord for his presence i'm expecting god to bless his word this morning i'm expecting him to give it to you as he desires it individually and personally and i'm expecting him to speak through his word through these lips his thoughts may they be expressed i have no business being here trying to figure out and trying to give you my thoughts but god let god give you his thoughts he quickened through the things that he laid in my heart may have opened your heart if you come here kind of stirred up i just say lord just quiet my spirit satan just did everything he could to keep this from coming this morning stop my printer everything he could do but he's lost he doesn't have the victory so we're expecting god i'm expecting how many has come expecting him to speak to you is that your desire are you willing to lay yourself down for that to happen amen oh no lord i'll have my own way you can't have your way in his way you've got to have one or the other his way is perfect amen let's just have word of prayer heavenly father our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come lord right here in the heart of your saints is coming it's coming lord you're manifesting yourself present with us individually lord it's a love affair lord the kingdom come thy will be done in this earth that i'm hidden behind lord in this earth and in this earth here lord i will be done in earth as it is in heaven i'm willing to have that father i know there's people here willing lord to do everything they can what they do must do lord is die to self give up themselves and take that perfect word lord jesus we love you we commit this service have committed it i believe you brought everyone here that should be here lord may your perfect will be accomplished and ministered i pray and for your glory in jesus christ's name we ask you to bless your word amen amen been a while since i've ministered and it's you'd get nervous because it's a dying of this old self but i know he's present right yeah they always here that's all i need to know i trust you will not leave here and i do not believe you can come in the presence of the lord and leave here the same as you came in you're going to either be closer drawn to him or further from him and the word will do the separating that's right so in isaiah the 55th chapter if you turn feed your bibles and i've been kind of a quandary where to start reading but i think i'm going to start with verse one here and maybe skip a little bit forgive me if i i don't know what it is when i get up to preach my nose runs and says you just use your use your rag here i lost it there it is thank you brother now that's a good that's a good mic controller okay now you've seen me raise that again turn it down would you okay okay isaiah 55 and verse 1. and i might just add here when we were visiting with brother jason's sister emmy i mentioned brother jason this song oh everyone that thirsts this is where this is taken from isaiah 55 1 whole everyone that thirsteth come into the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yay come buy wine and milk without money without price isn't that wonderful why can't you give up yourself you can't purchase this there's not enough work you can do to merit it why don't you just let yourself go and repent the problem is with so many today there's not so many new births as the problem is they haven't truly repented repentance is a sorrowfulness for your sin a breaking a turning around and a faith in your heart to say god you you purchase my salvation isn't what i do it's what you've already done for me and my faith in that you repent and be baptized in water but it's repentance first water baptism will not save you amen it will not it's only an outward expression of an inward faith of what you have the final work in calvary that's repentance you truly repent and you truly take that baptism in his name there's nothing going to stop you from having the holy spirit see where it becomes short if anybody's here that hasn't really repented it's not a mental makeup it's not a mental work up you can re you can you can quote scriptures right unless the devil does the same thing even quote the message but unless you're born again unless the holy ghost himself comes from works in you then it's a growing up you don't stop right there then you lay in the presence of the sun and ripen that's the only way that you can have a body change amen takes repentance first a sorrow god forgive me take these sins from me birth yourself in me i'm taking my stand for you you love me first it's that faith that genuine faith that causes repentance in what jesus christ did for you i won't go any further with that so but wherefore why do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfyeth not hearken diligently unto me and eat that which which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david behold i have and let's stop it seek ye the lord verse six seek ye the lord while he may be found i don't know the door may shut any moment and it may already be amen the bride will still be on earth for a period of time preaching to the eternal loss i'm not saying it is please understand but if you have a pull in your heart for more of god you better run quickly to his grace and give up your life to him don't you depend upon some sensation and some emotion it's got to be that word genuinely revealed in you because the new birth is jesus christ revealed it is jesus christ in you amen how many believe that then what are you worried about he's not going to take it away you're in him you're in him amen we're coming into that god help me that he may be found call upon him while he is near let the wickedness is too loud let the wicked forsake his way and the righteous man his thoughts that's better thank you let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him is still getting a rebound you can turn that down a little bit let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord he'll have mercy upon him and and to our god for his abundant will abundantly pardon i'm coming into my thoughts here for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord may god reveal that to every one of us my thoughts david's thoughts david's carnal thoughts david's ways are not his ways so let go of your ways let go of your carnal thinking you say those thoughts come yes they do but you don't have to keep them there because it's not you satan want to present a thought but that come from your soul you know whether you're born again or not you have the mind of god if you are if the holy ghost is dwelling in your soul you have the mind of christ and christ don't think those thoughts so where did it come from didn't come from you didn't come from your heart then take authority over by the word amen so my thoughts my thought david's thoughts are not my excuse me my thoughts god's thoughts god speaking are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts then your thoughts so now therefore his thoughts and his ways then become my absolute yes he's expressed that in his word to us so our absolute is the word now god sent a prophet because god's word comes to his prophets and the prophet has the interpretation of the word for the season then that becomes absolute that that interpretation for the word for this season don't you add to it and take from it if you do then you really don't believe god sent a prophet a vindicated prophet because when he interpreted this word to be something how dare you try to add to or take from god's thought because he sent a prophet to interpret the word for the season [Music] i may believe that i can show you quote after quote the prophet said that amen be careful we don't water the message down amen the message i'm talking about the message is jesus christ revealed amen not your interpretation nor my interpretation it's his what he said brother brown said we now have the perfect interpretation of the word by divine vindication that you argue with him amen you can't take this and just figure it out and even know what god's speaking unless god sent a prophet to interpret it for us 2. not the man i'm not talking about william branham the man i'm talking about god the word who came to that man vindicated his own word see amen so when these two come together you've got mechanics and dynamics that's right when the holy spirit and this word come together you've got the mechanics and dynamics without the holy spirit you'll never discern what it's saying you'll never get what the prophet's saying i don't care how many quotes you give of the prophet you can add your own thinking and give your own quote but if what he said doesn't line up with this word in your thing in your heart and see it properly in the word you said the wrong thing you can quote him all you want you're not saying what he said i hope you understand that all right now for the rain cometh down from and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither other words he sent the rain down it was for a purpose he sent the snow down as for a purpose but watereth the earth and make it that bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater verse 11 so shall my word hallelujah so shall my word that's his word and that's your word if you be in him amen are you with me yes okay so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void other words it's going to return to him but it won't return void it's got to come to manifest it will manifest what he sent it to do it won't return to him void amen it will not return to me boyd but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereunto i sent it now sent it that's my absolute yes for ye shall go out now it's ye what's he speaking of here the prophet said now if you be that word heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not fail and if you be that word that come out of his mouth if you be that word you cannot pass away either amen all right so my word who is there anybody here that would be his thought express so my word shall not return to me void but and for ye shall go out with joy he sent it and ye shall go off with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you unto singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands so you've got a hope you're looking for you're looking for a fulfillment of what he started in you he will finish you can be seated i got some more scriptures here job chapter 38. i want to bring these in so we can lay a basis here for what we've got to say my subject my title this morning is the greatest love story the greatest love story a subject is ripening in the presence of the sun having spiritual contractions that sound like a a funny saying doesn't it that we're the greatest love story and then we're in the midst of spiritual contractions why we're in travail for a body change amen anybody in travail for a body change amen the next thing for the bride is body change we don't live by dogmas we don't live by some man's idea some thought saying well there's got to be this or that if it's not in the scripture it's dogma amen amen i don't care if you quote the prophet and then try to tell by the prophet's quotes that you try to express your own thoughts if your thoughts isn't in this word amen it's dogma it may seem true but it's not i'll just leave that there i was going to preach a message dogma versus truth but it's a anyway but in job 38 verse 3 gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me where wast thou when i laid the foundation of the earth declare if thou hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy where were thee where were you bride where were you all right ephesians chapter one starting with verse three these are little lengthy scriptures but you just bear with me we really don't have anything to rush for if you do and you need to get up you're welcome you see i got so much built up over two months that i have to let it out somehow now part of that is just kidding the part of it's serious it's true but i will follow the lord and that is true verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him where were you according that he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world in him he chose us in him you didn't choose that he did amen before the foundation of the world before you performed anything before any works were done right you were chosen in him that ought to settle it we could say amen and go home happy full of joy having victory over the battlefield amen you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that you should be holy and without blame before him in love now that's god's determined work having predestinated us unto the adoption placing of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so lay down yours to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved when he came to this earth god did in the sun form amen are you with me there was the fullness of the godhead bodily there you were amen joseph's in him he said according he said it to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath abounded have made us accepted in the beloved you already accepted amen in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will that's his word according to the good pleasure where he had purpose in us no in him having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time that's where we're at he might gather together in one all things in christ how are you in christ before the foundation of the world he'll gather together all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen i think i'll stop right there saint john 16. saint john 16. now this is going to be a little unusual term but remember my subject here and it's a love story and we have a little bride today that is pregnanted with eternal life amen and she's bearing an eternal word child amen all right verse 20 1620 john 16 20 verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and you shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour is come wake up bride let's be alert here satan wants to turn this thing around oh you've done something wrong or you must not be right you wouldn't do those you wouldn't have those pressures and those trials those tests and all those things we're in a spiritual contractions and they're getting stronger amen thank the lord they're getting stronger i'm way ahead of myself here but they're getting closer together too amen bless you brother scott thankful for god healing that shoulder amen god's no respecter of persons what do you have need of this morning settle it right now it's finished quit leaning on your own self putting trying to figure out things just give way give over to god i can't do it i'm a sheep all right go back to our scripture a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she's delivered of the child she remembers the more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world now and and you know and you now have therefore have sorrow brother sister jesus is speaking to seed here they had to come to a new birth now i'm going beyond the new birth that had to happen we had to have this right here happen for a new birth a new birth is a mess you're going to lay down everything yeah it's going to be a it's going to be a real repentance amen and you take that water baptism with that faith in your heart knowing that what god did is a final it's finished you're going to come with the holy ghost you'll be at something take place in that soul because faith will be answered by god amen that's right is that right or is it right how many know that i know it's right i've experienced it i know it's right amen don't try to come some other way don't try to come in the back window this is a feast fit for the bride don't you try to come in some other way you got to come in one way you got to come through the door repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost god has to keep that word and if you've got that true faith in that word he's got to keep it right and he gives you that faith amen i was going to preach a whole message on repentance and deep on my heart and paul said this we do if god permit you young people don't try to come some other way you've got to recognize what he did for you and be godly sorrowful for what your sins have come before god with our true heart yeah lay it all down forgive me cleanse me wash me i invite you and i want you to live my life i want you to come in and then take that water baptism right something's got to happen something's got to take place the reason it isn't because many times i say it again no true repentance you don't come with a dried confession brother it's just a dried confession something got to drop in your heart that it's finished and you're willing to lie right there and give yourself over to it amen all right amen i have to pray that god help me to i think maybe said enough right there and therefore you have sorrow but i will see you again and he says now he said 21 second verse and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again amen and your heart shall rejoice in your joy no man taketh from you and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it you amen amen amen all right these things have spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall show you openly all right i think that day's come it's here sure absolutely i say it not in bed it's been another day but we've returned back to the restoration of that again amen openly plainly of the father amen all right he said you will have sorrow but your sorrow shall be turned to joy the bible said in his presence his fullness of joy amen that's where that's where we live his fullness of joy at his right hand is pleasures forevermore amen amen where are you living in christ amen all right but does the devil come and try to beat you out of that sure he does because you got an outer man that's not born again and he's against you it's an enemy i may know that brother brown but scripture i mean scripture said your carnal self is an inmate enemy enmity against god it's an enemy so you have an enemy a lot closer than you realize it's called self but that doesn't change what's laid in your soul by the baptism of the holy ghost they can't move that right amen all right so you're in a battle somebody told me that the other day i said i said yes good he's defeated at the battle i said good you're in the battle that show satan don't got you he's trying to get you but you're not going to let him he can't get you he can't come where you are you can't get to where you are and who you are just take what you are that faith that believer and take the word and blow him out of the battlefield refuse it reject it it's not it's not just it's not god's thought amen then you've won you're not a loser you're a winner right you're not a loser you're a winner all right okay and at his right hand that's where you're seated that's where your position is in heavenly places in christ you are at his right hand there are pleasures forevermore and now the old has to die a decreasing you know it's not so much to say calling for say lord lord give me more faith that's not against that but really is lord let me have a greater decreasing of self it's a decreasing of self amen that's what we need the faith lays there just get yourself out of the way let me decrease myself that's a daily thing it's a dying daily it's it's me david i must decrease so he can increase i must decrease and he increases every time you decrease he increases amen is that right all right said i did that paul said i die daily a daily dying a laying down of self-crucifixion and follow him leading you to the word follow him who's leading you by the word all right leading you he is the word jesus said in saint john 15 no greater love than a man has this that he would lay down his life for his friend what is your his life his self lay down yourself for your friend who's your friend amen is that right no greater love than this that a man will lay down his life for his friend and i'm your friend jesus said you are my friends and what is he closer than a brother amen i'm my wife's friend she's my friend a friend knows the secrets amen he'll stand right by you or we lay down our life ourself daily take up your cross and follow me he said you want to find me you want to follow me what are you going to have to do lay down yourself amen all right romans 8 23 let's turn there romans 8 23 let's start here let's start with verse 18 romans 8 18. for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god that creatures creation for the creature or creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope but the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god this whole earth will someday be absolutely changed to a new heavens and the new earth and the earth is in birth pains for that to happen amen is that right and the pains are getting closer and the pains are getting stronger than we know it's got to give way amen is are you with me what are they looking for because actually the pains are rejoicing and a leaping and a joyous thing because sons of god are coming to their position they fell under a son of god they're going to be redeemed under a son of god are you with me they're actually rejoicing over it that's why they're leaping and things are happening they're going to give way yet it's a it's labor pain what about this little bride today she's going to have a new earth also a new body amen all right something's happened the devil don't want you to really recognize what's happening if he can keep you beat down so you don't recognize your position and who you are but if you recognize your position and who you are amen he's defeated to you he's already defeated but he's going to try to keep you not to believe that amen see all right i want to go into that starting right here very quickly now go in and show you what you are then come up and finalize this message god help us are you with me okay okay so verse 22. for we know that the whole earth groaneth and travaileth in pain and together until now what are they in pain for or a new one all right for we know that the whole um excuse me verse 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the change of our body amen he redeemed you the blood covered the body the blood bought it it's got to be changed you have the assurance and the evidence that it will be changed because he that word that changed you in your soul has also purchased you and you're his and it's this has got to be changed according to that all right now first john 1 1-5 i want to read the very scriptures that brothers paul i thought that was so good last wednesday or was it wednesday yeah wednesday first john 1 that was wednesday wasn't it for brother paul freeze his last win okay i'm just i'm just checking it's a anybody listening all right all right first john 5. first john 1 excuse me verse 1 that which was from the beginning in the beginning was the okay that was just from the beginning which we have heard which we have heard which we have seen and with our eyes we we was seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life i shake hands with it every time i come to church and sometimes during the week amen are you with me not lost anybody on that statement all right verse 2 for the life the life the life was manifested and we have seen it in other words revelation of the word is christ or god's way of making himself known to his bride i don't want you to forget that we could go back to saint john 17 verse 3 he said that which things we know and well i'll just let's just let's just clip over there just a minute saint john 17 hold your place right there i'm coming right back but i want to make this statement here and you'll see where we're talking about remember his word can't return void amen his word cannot return void so we go back here to saint john 17 and verse 3 says and this is life eternal that they may know thee amen let's know thee intellectual no no you will get anywhere with an intellectual knowledge of him you must know him he said i don't know you what didn't he know of you you weren't part of him but he's you're a part of him and he reveals himself to you i just read it out of ephesians you'll make the mystery known all right and this is life eternal that they may know thee the only true god which is only eternal life there is and jesus christ whom thou hast sent that doesn't mean jesus christ is another being it was god manifested they're not separated it's one god right there the scripture tells it amen amen this is eternal life that they may know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sinned a lot more in that scripture we could go to but we won't take time now revelation of the word revelation is god's way of making himself known to his church his pride for the life was manifested i want you to hold that because we are in the midst of seeing life manifested and life manifested as more than i'm not against it more than shouting jumping it's living the word the holy ghost is an action in you it's a word lived it's the word live for the season you recognize and you receive the word of promise for the season because you are seeing it you hear it all right so the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and we see it being manifested where today the word the light being manifested is jesus christ but where is he the greatest love story he reveals himself and you and i amen all right and we have seen it and we bear witness and this has all been preached i'm not trying to preach brother paul's message again we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life we have something to show and unto you that that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you may have fellowship with us so you see where fellowship is it's in the revealed mystery so you so that you may have fellowship with us or it's the message revealed brother brown said the new birth is the message of the hour amen all right he said he said you may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship was with the father and with himself manifested in flesh truly our fellowship is with the father with his son jesus christ verse 5 this then oh i'm sorry and these things we write unto you that your joy may be full i just told you the presence in his presence is what fullness of joy he sings we write unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all not even a shadow of eternity it's perfect god's ways are perfect and he said and i made your way perfect all right all right now the elect only the elect will see and here only the elect only the elect can be reborn you know why don't you because the seed is there to be quickened what seed god seed the word seed is there to be quickened in this hour to manifest the word for the hour that's why you will see the hour and the time you receive it you see it others say i can't see it but you see it right amen all right now the word is god's thoughts express i may say amen the word of god the word is god's thoughts expressed of course that's what a word is and i'm talking about god's word is god's thoughts expressed revelation okay which is his way of making himself known to the church now on the message 318 64 i didn't write down the message but you can look it up in the beginning paragraph 81 i'm playing this out so you go back as brother paul always said many times go back and read ahead and behind now you say well why don't you put it up i've got so many i don't want to put them up and i'm not used to that i'm an old order preacher and if you either just sit there and pick it up you just it makes you listen doesn't it all right i don't have to worry about you reading ahead of me something could come out of it anyway all right in the beginning in the beginning god was not even god now isn't that a statement why because god's an object of but he was eternal being he was a being all right but he had to have something to worship him you know the rest of the story created angels okay but in the beginning god was not even god he was the great eternal and in there in there where in that great eternal was attributes attributes was his thoughts whose thoughts god's thoughts all right and then he became a word like this and a word expressed well a thought expressed is a word a word expressed is a thought all right so in the beginning was the word keep that in mind and the word was with god and the word was god paragraph 82 same message and then remember if you ever was in god's thinking you will always be there if you ever was in god's thinking you'll always be there right now you see right now right there the devil's defeated amen when that revelation comes in you alive there's nothing going to take you out of this oh he may try i'm not saying we'll try your old man will speak back to you but that doesn't change the revelation right all right and remember if you ever was in god's thinking you'll always be there if you've got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute of his thoughts for this age if not there is only one eternal life and it always existed and you in his mind existed existed existed before there was a world hallelujah before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world why you were in the thinking of himself therefore being in himself you are perfect you say well brother david you don't seem very perfect when you get upset and you do this you say this and the wife says this and i say that and this something else says this you're just talking about the wrong side of the veil why brother branham you make yourself god to the people he said well is that so far off the truth isn't that what the prophet said mighty god unveiled he said i knew which side of the veil he was talking about to make him god william branham is antichrist but to making that word living in its day and hour is the truth so is the bride amen amen my word will not return to be void it's going to accomplish you're going to accomplish you're going to do exactly those works have been predestinated in him before the foundation of the world you're his workmanship created in christ jesus under good works which he hath before ordained where do you ordain it in himself it's not your will it's his will he placed his will showed himself in you amen all right now so he says and you the real i'm talking about the real you the word living in you the real you the holy spirit in you that revelation of that word is the true believer amen all right he said and you in his mind existed before the there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world isn't it isn't what we think what somebody else thinks not even what david thinks this man's always against me every time i turn around against me is that right oh well how do you know why you would look at now it's only reasonable to say why your feelings are testifying something different does he ever speak to you like that certainly if you're a real believer you're in battle you're not on a picnic and you're fighting for every inch of ground god's already given you and this battle getting hot and heavy is getting closer and closer together but we're only showing one thing i'm ready for a body change i'm coming to that amen all right all right so and you and his mind existed it isn't what we think what somebody else thinks it's what god eternal it's what god eternal thinks you always was see in his thinking this is his thinking revealed the word is this is a letter but you aren't ministers of the letter even and yet we are but how are we ministers of the letter by the spirit that wrote it without the spirit that wrote it you won't understand the letter you'll take a mental conception about it and go off in sin amen that's exactly right but if you believe it hold the mental conception by the same token god said you're i've given right mental attitude amen i'll make it known so something's got to control that all right i won't go any further than that all right now verse paragraph 83 it was in him to be man that's the reason christ was expressed image of himself it was in him to be man in christ in god to be man and here he was the eternal thought of god expressed in the sonship and therefore if he was the eternal thought of god expressed the sonship of the godhead bodily you were in him then see you've already been accepted in him there's your answer you have the devil's answer not me that liveth but christ liveth in me there's the devil's answer hold the word he can't break through the word hold that faith in that word and god's faith the faith of god will take its resting place in the unmovable unchanging unable to be broken word of god amen it's god it has this resting place it's wrestling plays in some reasoning and don't reason faith doesn't reason faith humbles itself to the word faith humbles itself to the word amen all right his love for you his love for you expressed in jesus christ his love for you is elective his love for you is elective love you say well how do i know he loves me because he said so and then he gave you his very life to prove and to testify that he loves you he placed you as his son amen then how do i prove my love back to him by believing what he said by believing what he said don't add your reasoning to it don't take from it don't take away from it and put something else to it you believe what he said so be it unto me according to thy word lord amen you believe what he said and conduct yourself there's your manifestation and conduct yourself there's the manifestation of the word today in bride form and conduct yourself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom has allowed to come to pass he knows better than you do he's ordained you to a body change he knows how to get you there he knows how to develop character that's fit to rule we all must go through pressures we all go through suffering this life this human life is a struggle and will be until you're delivered of it amen but you don't have to let it remain god tests you with that it's the trying of your faith where's your faith based in yourself i have no confidence in man the bride doesn't have confidence in the man you don't have confidence in your reasoning you're thinking i have a mental thought i have a better thought about it you have no confidence in that the confidence is in the word revealed and expressed in you living in you manifested in flesh in this hour amen amen now in the summertime church age church age book romans 9 11 says that the purpose of that the purpose of god according to election might stand amen purpose of god according to election all right you can't read it any other way the heart purpose you've heard me these quotes are not new you heard us mentioned before but the heart purpose god's heart purpose look at what god's heart purpose is his heart purpose the very core of his being his heart purpose the eternal purpose brother man the lord just expands it further not his heart purpose but the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing a bride of his own choosing already a part of him already existed in his thoughts eternal with him how are you going to be in eternity and then cast out of eternity if god cast you a part of himself out of eternity he's cast himself away hallelujah hallelujah did you get that he can't lose any part of himself god may this be revealed to saints and seed laying here quicken it further lord quicken it further let them see let them see the word made flesh right here right in them amen let them see that manifested amen the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in no other was in himself now brother sister this will cause this will this will make you with this revelation you'll lay your veil upon his shoulders that's all there is to it you you give him the key amen you give him the key he no other person no other being no other man has any responsibility you've given the full responsibility to him let go and let god then have his responsibility let him do what he wants to do let him act the way he wants to act through you quit leaning on your own self deny yourself there's no greater love than this and a man would lay down himself for this word it's not will he be present has he present the headstone is here brother sister the headstone the capping time is right now the message of the hours the capping of the bride it's the bride time it's bride's season it's bright age it's the raptured age amen he's capped it off the bride is not another age it's the capping of the ages it's himself we're caught up in the manifestation and manifesting himself in the bride form that's the full revelation of himself makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing christ in you makes you the complete revelation amen amen amen amen so the heart the purpose of god the heart purpose the eternal purpose was a bride of his own election his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world you have a thing to do with this he decreed it before the world began watch carefully now and see this before there was even a speck of stardust before god was god god's an object of adoration no one there to worship him so he was that time only potentially god and he was known only as an eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind oh what's this got to do with all these little ideas that he sought you that you know is the devil talking to you what was he defeated with in the beginning it is written it is written where in your heart it right here in the word and this becomes in you you are the word living and in action the manifestation of the holy spirit let me just say this that manifestation holy spirit is not will be is not going to be is catching away a bride is sounds like a rapture going on to me what's the rapture going to end in the change of my body glory how many believe that the truth here we are we've arrived what's left for the bride to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen how can you lay in his presence if he hasn't here how can you be pregnant with life if he hasn't come how are you going to have a marriage unless he's come here to have a marriage the headstone i could take we can take just quotes after quotes after quote brother i'm showing the time the season the headstone she's making up the headstone the headstones here she's been molded through those ages right up clear up to the prophet for running as john 4 rhonda said i'll declare him to you i'll i'll tell you and pretty soon he said here he is here's the one i talked to you about here he is even the picture taken of him there right on sunset mountain here he is the headstones come what's happening there's an invisible union that's not known to the public it only can be known to his elect bride amen but he said well what's a different preaching because it's got to be preached this faith has got to be preached it's the season it's the hours the time and it's separating shock from the true wheat it's delivering you out of denominational darkness it's definitely delivering you from idolatry from some other image beside the true word living image bowing to another image you're not bowing those images they want to create they could go on and on i could preach in the flee idolatry message right now anything that comes between you and the word being preeminent and dominant and and the and the and the deity in your life is an idol bout of that thing i don't care what it is and god's trying to shake you out of it realize there's more of this life than your games and your videos and everything else you've got to play with you better get down to business this is an urgent message you better hurry up because what if the door is shut only once he's going to reveal to us himself to the bride she's already in i'm telling you right now individually you were in before the foundation of the world and it's got to be manifest because that word that he decreed will not return to him void he spoke of his bride he showed it it was a hidden mystery of himself a hidden thought in his mind in the back part of his mind is now revealed in the heart of the bride the bride has that revelation and it's putting her into a body change and by that you're coming to more testing you're coming to more trials you're coming to more you're turning more circumstances more pressure more this pressure that pressure turn here turn there just keep your focus on one thing keep your focus on jesus the revealed word that is in our midst i may preach hard i may preach this way but brother sister leave me alone i'm having a good time you may not like it i didn't choose what kind of ministry i'd have i didn't choose that god did there's one thing i know i love you and i love him and i can't love him and not love you and i know i love you i love you beyond words to express i'm going to express it you may not like the way it's expressed it neither did they like john the baptist when he expressed it i'm not saying i'm john the baptist by any means i'm just saying that nature it does don't you start looking at the outside and judging the outside start judging the word the truth is there a life lived amen amen amen amen you know something's wrong with that word and you do it anyway you are sin you are in sin and you're dying you just go right on thinking you're all right when the word says you're not why don't you just humble yourself give yourself up to god repent confess you're wrong forsake it and then the word said you'll have mercy you're not willing to forsake it you want to reason with the devil about it well it's okay this is okay it's not with people you don't have to worry about this that just the same old thing he told them to leave he didn't mean that here let me interpret to you what the prophet said let me tell you let me tell you what jesus meant don't you accept his own religious doctrines perfect interpretation of the word by divine you ask god to reveal it to you that's it you won't make it right you're not going any further you're stopped right there you're sucking on the wrong filter you're going to suck on the filter that satisfies the taste in your soul but god's given us a filter that'll bring in the holy spirit in your life you can't draw through the word filter you can't draw through the message filter you won't draw through this word filter anything but the holy ghost himself to quicken the word in you for the season and there's a resurrection god has provided this filter why are you trying to manufacture and produce another one you'll hear it i may not have another chance i know someday i've got to send the judgment and give testimony for what i said and i know i have to answer before him at a judgment bar judgment for reward or not and i know i'm full aware i would like to preach a message and will the lord willing if you help me i want to preach on who are those righteous at the white throne judgment that are saved not the bride bride's already in but who are those righteous that he separates the sheep from the goat what are they where's their place who are they and who are those that are cast away and taking the name off the book what makes them do that what produces that judgment it's a great mystery and i and it's so i just can't hardly stand it i'd like to preach it i almost preached it here but i just felt checked again god has a time if i ever do but you go to the sumerian age and read what he said this bride's name is not only in the lamb's book of life she's in a section of the book of life and that section is the eternal life record and that name can never be removed from it i'm telling you right here he can't remove your name from his because your name and his is the same name you're blood related amen i'm expressing this right here and god help me i've got to get through this what time is it okay i've got just a little bit more to be to be brother david's preaching would you rather me take your way of preaching your mind or what god showed me you see what i'm saying it's not even mine my normal is about an hour and a half plus now if god don't want that done i believe god will stop me if he wants it to you have you have grace his grace is sufficient you're feeding keep feeding but you're looking at your time and deny yourself all right listen to me now i believe we've been i believe we've grown up over these things brother sister we've grown up here we've grown up over that amen now let's get back to where i said this here i got a little no i didn't okay the bride was existing in his thoughts she was existing already in his mind and what about those thoughts of god what about those thoughts of his bride are they eternal or are they not saint john 1 i've already quoted in beginning was the word matthew 24 35 said my word will not pass away heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away and you were those thoughts expressed and now expressed into a being into flesh into a veil behind skin which you're just wrapped in and trapped in paul said oh wicked man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this corruption but i thank god through jesus christ my lord so the law of his spirit hath made me free from the law of sin and death think on these things amen are you with me all right he said that that in me that is in my flesh or life no good thing so why are you putting confidence in it god's trying to get our confidence based on one thing let's look beyond the curtain of time like john did and said there's john look beyond the curtain of time second corinthians 4 18 said while we look not at the things which are seen see taste feel smell here the things which are seen but the things which are not seen are eternal for the things which are seen are temporal temporal so my do we put so much emphasis on temporal when our total emphasis shouldn't be anything between me and the word the word is my eternal amen that's where i judge everything is from that little wheel in the middle of the wheel amen let the little wheel do the moving not your feelings not your senses quit trying to be something you're not be what you are be what you are on the inside don't make a make-believe out of this be genuine amen i'm not saying that to scare anybody i'm saying you just start looking down here on the inside of the inside what are you where are you putting your confidence in amen i'm i may not get to where i want to get here let's go a little bit further he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything he can't change what he thought of you what he said about you he's expressing it right here through a prophet and this what the prophet said brought us right back to this i can't leave it you believe that you can't leave it the prophet won't leave the word amen amen but god's word is of no private interpretation but the prophet is not the private interpretation it's the word interpreting you don't believe that oh yes that's what he said that's what the word said god of old wrote the scriptures how did he write it through men of old were moved by the holy ghost amen they had god's interpretation of the word i know there's somebody here doesn't believe that but i don't care it's the truth amen amen whether they believe it or not all right now those thoughts of god are eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint that is drawn up which will someday be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and they're part of god amen it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride saint john 15 16 you have not chosen me but i've chosen you now according to the word the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world the choosing of the bride was purpose in himself we read it ephesians 1 9. psalm 139 15 and 16 will give you a little idea of this my substance mean my substance you was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect and thy and in thy book were all my members written which in continuance was fashioned as yet there was none of them so the thought was there in his mind that thought was eternal and had to be expressed when he created adam was formed in the dust the earth his spiritual being was created being created by god then adam became god sought express and those eternal thoughts were now manifested this mystery is only revealed as he promised to his bride all hell is against this truth what are they against the revelation of jesus christ being here now that's what all hell's against amen and the bride is standing on it because that's her stand the revelation of the mystery where was the mystery hid under seven seals amen there you are the book was sealed with seven seals what book you're the word in the book right look then why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's a father trying to reveal this hidden secret hidden secret to you brother branham said it's a hidden secret it would only be known to the bride and brother brown said it is that seventh seal and it's what the thunder said and it is the mystery of his coming i don't want to just say cliches brother sister it's not what i'm up here for i'm causing you to go look i'm causing you to go seek go search it for yourself go feed go feed go feed you'll feed your you'll feed your emotions you'll feed your your physical being you'll feed your your mental your spirit being you'll feed in all kinds of of things what about your soul what are you feeding is that become secondary in your life what are you putting first amen when god's pulling at your heart and pulling at your heart to go sit down and pray and read the word so what are you putting first what are you bowing to i'm just i'm just i'm challenging you the holy spirit's challenging you go consider your ways consider your ways are you in or out amen watch why do you hunger why do you thirst is god trying to reveal the sitting secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let you go right down the line you know what the prophet said you let a mother you let a father you let something else you love pleasures you love you let this you let that you'll let some false teacher get it out of you false preacher get it out of you you'll let some emotion some something that god don't even judge you by that's not even it's not even the evidence you can be so anointed in your spirit by that and think and you're anointed and cast out devils and speak in tongues and all these things and still not being the word you know that's right that's exactly true that's one of the mysteries of the hour that had to be restored revealed actually revealed because it wasn't until this time when they would make known that would be made known brother braham said i'm gonna i'm gonna bring it to you so you won't be deceived by that spirit when it comes up here in maturity in this day so close it would deceive the elected if possible it's what you do with this word it's what you hear this word amen it's how you receive it and only the holy spirit can teach it right i didn't get the holy because i shouted i got the holy spirit spoken tongues got the holy spirit i prophesy god that's none of those things are evidence we've already preached what the evidence is and we'll start there all right now then come back in the last days and he picks up these mysteries and clearly explain it and reveals it why it's all the last days when the great mystery of god that he had in his heart is being revealed it's in the last days look well see the seventh seal opening was the evidence that we're in the last day the end of time of all thing end of politics end of church life end of this end of that we're at the end we've arrived how much longer none of us know we don't know that moment when we're going to be changed in the twinkling of an eye we're looking for that sudden moment but there's a secret catching away prior to that we're being secretly caught away amen the manifestation of the holy spirit is catching away a bride it's a secret catching way and a sudden secret change but it's that mystery that's revealed to the bride amen all right i'll hurry i've got to close look what was once god's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer i know you're tired but listen to me carefully listen to this just bring your bring your being under subjection say satan i'm not going to give you this opportunity look at what was once great god's great secret mysterious secret in his mind it wasn't open until the seals all right is now put is now now not going to be is not put in the heart of the believer because where was the headstone in the pyramid what was unveiled you're that unveiling you're the mysterious part the final revelation the full revelation of jesus christ that was kept hid now you see him now you're expressing him now he's being manifested there's marriage taking place there's a union an invisible union it's a secret union that nobody but the bride can see that doesn't mean i'm putting this one in and out i'm talking to the bride if you see it happy are ye it's an identification where you are who you are and where you've come from amen are we identified or not identified the token is the identification the token is the person eternal life is a person the token is a person not a feeling not an emotion just not even an anointing even it is the anointing sent for that person to be unveiled it's that word in your soul that's unveiled it's what he placed there that thought that i'm talking about that was in him is now expressed in a human vessel the unveiling of his word it's the third pull it's the opening of that word i had to go west to get the revelation of what that secret was in that white stone the seal had to be taken off this had to come in the light of the sun brother branham said the headstone was revealed in the pyramid in it it was missing where is it where is the complete revelation of himself where is the capping stone where is the headstone to be revealed the greatest love story is as revealed in you you're a part of that you are that bride you are that you are she is him he is she well i failed and i guess i don't have it anymore don't you believe that lie when that's revealed inside of you and living in you and the word is revealing revealed day by day moment by moment you're living in that it's unveiling itself it's unveiling itself don't you believe that devil's lie to tell you well you didn't have it well i guess i didn't what was me what was you who what you are you talking about i'm not trying to be funny people i'm dead serious you want to hold your grudges you want to forgive you need a birth you need a new birth you want to find fault with the word you need a new birth amen you can just try to produce every little thing you want i'm a messy believer i was raised in a message family i got message books nonsense that's all good but that's not it you need a new birth you need to really repent if you can amen now i don't know why i'm saying all some of these things i'm saying i don't know why i'm saying it all but he knows but if i told you the truth they bear record he said it's put in the heart of the believer that is the body of christ what was once god's great secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest think of it see how many believe that i just thought ready to shout this rook down it's not made manifest i'm one of them amen i'm his amen i don't know what's going to happen tomorrow never been that way i've not been the way the remainder of this day haven't been that way before but who's leading me are you confident he's leading then just follow let go let him have his way don't try to figure out how he's leading the sheep don't have to don't have to give an explanation why the shepherd led him through the shadows of death why led him to this pond not that pawn brought him over here not there why are you trying to explain god his thoughts are higher than your thoughts why don't you just take him at his word and know where you stand because he's revealed it to you and he's identified it in your life by manifesting it over and over and over again is that right every time you come out of the trial you're closer to it why because you had to go through the trial to develop some character god's wanting to bring out himself what for he's wanting to bring you to a body change he's wanting to take you forth he's you have one position that's to sit by his side as a queen you didn't just become queen you always were queen you didn't just become his wife you always were his wife you were never married to this thing to begin with right god said you weren't so that settles it he's got trapped into this amen are you with me but i'm telling you what god thinks about you i'm telling you what what your position is right he's i'm not he is why i'm spending so much time with this all right i've not quit just bear with me just a few more minutes amen i'm not trying to wear your patience brother sister this is life the manifestation of his spirit he's the same yesterday today and forever and i've told you the truth and the and the record is bore that i've told you the truth he's the same yesterday today and forever and the manifestation of his spirit is catching away a bride so it's a secret catching away oh brother david you're already body shaped no that's the secret also it's all a part of the secret amen but there's a secret taking place when the bridegroom he said behold the bridegroom cometh they all rose and trim their lamps just like the little story of the of the rancher you know he went down there and they all the women know he was coming to my i'm going to get this rancher's son he's the owner and they all rose up and trimmed their lamps they'll put the dresses on and everything trimmed their lamps you look up the word trim and see if it's not dressed but that's not what he come for he came for the one that had oil they that were ready went in to the marriage with him and when the last one that he's put that name on that book that book's been opened the last one to catch the revelation they come in amen and mature in that presence that last one the door is shut not no more amen amen we're going to a wedding supper amen are you with me not to a marriage the marriage has come a secret catching away romeo said come to mary he caught her in the back but throwing the dishwater out my purpose of coming is to find a wife and you need the qualification you're ready will you marry me i'm not worthy i made you worthy none of us are worthy you're going to look at your worthiness we're all lost it's not me worthy it's him it's his work not mine it's his working it's his choosing his grace is sufficient do you believe that his grace is sufficient it's made perfect in your weakness oh my oh if i was just a little stronger god's got you where he wants you so you'd look at him and surrender all i can't do it lord i can't do it so i've been trying to get you to see for years then where can you do it my word is your strength the lord god is your strength all right same closing i got 10 closings you know let's look beyond the curtain of time second corinthians 4 18 that's looking at the things which are not seen that's me that one beyond the curtain of time that's me that's the eternal one god's own thought of himself manifested let that revelation let that faith that that's that the manifestation of the spirit is catching away a bride brother brown said let that faith and then in parenthesis he puts revelation let that faith revelation fall into your heart this is the hour amen amen let it drop into your heart this morning amen first sets alone second just turn me a few more scriptures and that's it ii thessalonians let me read this by the coming of the lord we're gathering together unto him you say well brother david i don't believe he's come then you've missed the message because he's coming and his mystery is coming is in mystery and it's a secret catching away i didn't say it's all finished the body changes are finished that's what he's come for he's come to unite with you he's come making himself one with you it's an invisible union that's just your own thinking well you think it is that's fine it isn't it's the word amen all right now second thessalonians 2. i just want to read this because this is this is certainly 2 thessalonians chapter 2 paul says now we beseech your brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be soon not shaken in mind or troubled in spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us that that day of christ is at hand amen all right this is the hour let that faith revelation drop into your heart this is the hour the seals were open to someone you see the man of sin you see what's happening you see what idolatry is you see what these things are you see that you become the word living that christ is in you glorifying you're here now we're doing what revealing manifesting the son of man what is it now the son of man revealed again amen all right okay hide me psalm 27 said hide me he preached that he took that scripture when he preached rapture he said hide me hide me in the secret of your tabernacle hide me in your pavilion in the secret what's what makes this bride so different the word is in her amen all right then hide me it's a secret catching away going on until the last one comes in the door is shut amen it's the secret brother brown said it's the secret going of the church remember what brother branham said he said on christ the mystery god revealed he said now we see the promise being fulfilled christ the true headship is going in brother david is there a going oh yeah we've heard the rustle in the mulberry trees there's a going have you ever heard that wrestling all right it sure is a rustling in our hearts all right a going he said now we see the promise being fulfilled christ the true headship the headship going in coming in his bride what about that this is the hour do we see where we're standing do you see what is faith going to do humble itself to the word not a big shock amen didn't even try to make numbers try to build a church build this build that no back to the old storeroom brother graham said back to the dimly lit rooms less of the world less of me and more of him okay i've got to close i've got to finish this up though real quick here i'll i'm just going to come to the head where i was we know the marriage is here capstone first thessalonians said he descends from heaven with a shout brother brahm said the headstone descends this coming the secret coming descends with a shout a voice i've got it right here voice a shout and the trumpet what's the trumpet do the trumpet is a gathering together bringing us together under what one head amen the trumpet sounded it's in this day of that trumpet that seventh great trumpet the seventh seal which is the seventh seal amen you see is this off again yeah well okay i'm getting a red sign i guess it's time to quit isn't it do i go by this or do i go by the holy spirit what's that pull it oh the pulpit mic okay this mic testing one two three that's perfection four is the word do you know he said that there's there's one something that follows that perfection the holy ghost made way for the holy ghost himself to come right down in perfection back to the word again brother brahm said that deliverance is the word himself steps forth that's the capstone of the ages oh we could take the stature we could do all these things right here to show you it's not another age it's the covering over it's the bride age it's a rapture time how many know it's rapture time seed time bride time you can say it all kinds of ways amen turn the corner it's the corner that's been turned many can't turn the corner piece of many aren't bride that doesn't mean i know who is and who isn't i'm just saying that he said it i can say it amen but in but that predestinated seed will see and understand they will receive now brother sister if that pulls in you for more of him let go and let god have his way then yield to the pool brother braham said the pool's in you that's what's got to be quickened god's given you a filter amen i won't go there anymore we are in the bride age okay i've already just said that let me just keep going here we've been pulled out of the pentecostal church that's high bread pulling it out finishing up the word and here comes the headstone crying grace grace amazing grace the headstone you are now wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace a wedding band of grace unmerited of your own it's already put on your finger amen hallelujah praise our god he slipped it on you before when he put your name on a book on the book what a thanksgiving the bride knows where she stands she is very few there won't be many saved just a very very very few but remember when the grain began to ripen we find before the grain can ripen everything in that stock has to be dead hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it with the word impregnated go back to christ the mystery god revealed world christ the mystery of god revealed i can't have time to get into that but you know what he said she's pregnanted bearing light bearing his name bearing the evidence of his name all right just exactly the same grain that when the ground it's the same jesus in the bride form i pray that god will let you look beyond the curtain of time it's the same jesus in the bright form same power same church same thing it's the same word the same word sucked up through these these ages and come out here and come to a head here amen amen i might say amen come up and and forming up into a head here he says in all excuse me sucked up out of here and come to a head here and all that life what do you think the sign was uniting time sign what's the sign it's a headship coming in to unite with his body all right that's why those that's why those doctrines everything had to be restored brought up right up to where they should be see then what the head stone comes toned and so it could sit right on it amen caps it off with himself you see your position bride do you see where you're at you see why you're going through these things listen now listen he says the same jesus in the bride form the same word sucked up through there and all that life and it came to a head here and all that life come up through through here picked up its people every age picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the rapture remember it's a secret catching away and a sudden secret body change disappearing you you become you be you be you you in a sudden secret body change you disappear from the earth you're gone so you're growing going gone you're growing going gone and in the spiritual sense right now you've already left just still here in your body but you're growing going and will be disappeared maybe even the next moment we don't know that moment amen that's one thing we don't know but we know it's under this coming amen we have the assurance of that in our hearts that i know i'm a part of that amen look look he says before their creation there has to be a creator blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness see there's something in us you raised your hand a while ago i want more of god how many want more of god i didn't see it my every hand ought to be up here you want more of god well you say brother david i want more of god then obey what he said do first all right you want me to come down the line a little further why won't you take communion when it's command of god to do so three things he left us three things water baptism foot washing communion three ordinances if you won't keep those ordinances you have no part with the tree of life if you won't take communion it's a showdown it shows you have no part with him if you don't have the holy spirit you take that baptism or excuse me i communion unworthy i'm talking about the lord's supper and you take it unworthily you bring damnation upon yourself you go out of here saying that you communion with god and go out and live another life unworthily but when you're filled with the holy ghost brother ram said you shouldn't even take communion until you're born again now go look and see what he said future home other places but he said it's a showdown communion 1965 it's a showdown if you don't take it you have no part with him you're showing it and if you take it unworthily you bring damnation upon yourself so you see what place it puts you in it's a command of god and you say i believe the prophet's message i believe message and do what he said this due in remembrance of me brother braham said this is a sacred thing we come here with a sure assurance of where we stand in christ that we are partakers and you won't do that you're not born again and if you are born again you never knew it before now you do i'm sorry if that hurts your feelings nobody's hurting your feelings it's love projected it's the light across your pathway now you can either reject it or accept it that's up to you i'm not telling you how often but you're not taking it when he commanded you to do so how can you say you love him and won't keep his commandments all right phew okay if you love the world going out that way and the things of the world the world's travel you'll go and in the fall you'll be come out your sons and daughters of the king the king be lady and gentlemen walk like christians live like christians act like christians look in your looking glass tonight see which way am i headed is jesus preparing a place for me a body the body that body is perfect that body walks ordinally orderly it's a son or daughter of god before god and i'm i and i'm in birth pains in here to be born into that body there if i still love the world it shows that i'm not i have no body there i'm just a church member i wasn't the germ of god i'm not he's not my father you see what he's saying all right and so is it in the spiritual realm it's water justification by faith believing god receiving him as your personal savior repentance see and being baptized second sanctification of the spirit that god cleanses the spirit from all elements of the world and the desires of the world and then the holy spirit comes in and gives a new birth and fills up that sanctified vessel if you want to go read about that justification you go read romans 5 1-7 we live by faith not sight time to read these second corinthians go read home go home and read second corinthians 5 1-7 if this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling be dissolved we have one waiting amen we're looking unto jesus the author and finish of our faith consider him who who through contradiction of sinners and suffered and pain by contradiction of sin consider him lest you be weary and faint in your own mind you're going through the same suffering amen amen i i i think you got that how many got that second corinthians 5 all right consider it because you're going to go through this trials and tests too contradiction of sinners contradiction of unbelievers claiming to be in the message but unbelief we are putting it we carry these things brother sister we're pressured by these things why it's a part of our going home all right you say oh i don't i don't believe god would do that i believe god will just take all that away from me and and i just live a happy-go-lucky no i'm sorry you don't know my lord i don't have to have pain suffering i didn't say you have to receive it and hold it i'm saying but you're going to suffer amen go back and read church age book page 116-119 and see what he said i don't have time to read it this morning and see if there's not suffering for the individual believer and if you're going to be birthed you're going to give birth into a new body there's going to be suffering there's going to be travail there's going to be contractions and the contractions are going to come and they're going to seem awful hard and they're going to disappear and you say why praise the lord and then the other one comes and it's harder and then why my it lets up and then another one comes it's harder than ever how many know that's happening you wonder why every day there's pressures you hear this you'd and and then and then the politics and then the the world and and this covet and this that and something else you're bombarded and bombarded and bombarded you don't have to listen to it amen but you're what's happening you're just under pressure oppression the devil's trying to do his best you see this old man raises up and you you reason with this and that and something else just stay steady people press in keep your focus press in press in with the reality and revelation of who you are and if you don't know ask god to reveal it to you feed on his word don't let these other things come in it's too late i know you got to go to work and they say i'm not talking about that but when you have opportunity amen amen it's urgent i'm making it urgent it is urgent you have birth pains here to be born into that body and so is the spiritual realm it's water justification by faith believing on god receiving a personal savior being baptized second see all these things and god cleanses the spiritual elements of the world all right i really quoted that excuse me that's the same thing in new birth we never go back we go forward when you're born again you never go back you go forward so many so many i think so many rather genuine new births we don't have too many genuine new verses because the seed maybe will sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to rot away from the old system they're in they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system and claim the new birth the message of the the new birth the message of the age if the doctor went to an examine a patient and it was in labor one of the first things the doctor would do which i'm talking in the presence of two or three i know of good medical doctors and i would ask this one of the first things the doctor does after it's been watching the patient is the time the pains birth pains he times the pains how close are they are together how much more terrific each one gets one is more harder than the other one and next one still harder gets closer closer spiritual contractions you wonder why where did that thought come from why am i going through this the devil's right there to give you an answer but the word's given you the answer that's what god knows you're coming down to this but you see what it's for it shows you're about ready to be changed right you're about ready to step over right now it's coming stronger and stronger just take heart raise your head look up hold that word before you look beyond the curtain live beyond the curtain walk beyond the curtain live by that revelation god bless you amen amen amen we see the word the word that we see the church of the church ages had to deliver a word bride and it has she's come out of her amen it's given birth to a word bride it went through pains i'm in this wonderful fellowship peace that passes all understanding the holy spirit living in me i live every day if death comes what can it do to me can't harm me your soul longs for something out there daily you're looking for it and seeing where it's at your old tabernacle your aches and groans and squeaks and oh my as the old birth pains coming upon it that's right what does it mean this whole lump of clay somebody someday is going to fade away but there's something inside of that little lump of clay that's trying to get out trying to liberate itself well what is it that little bird called the soul and the only way it can free itself one morning the clay will break away and will drop and rise and evers and sees the everlasting prize when the soul goes to meet its lover yonder with both arms out the only thing that's keeping you here is this little old wreck racket rack that's what he said rocklety bunch of clay but there's a birth pain there's pains within you you're going through struggles and trials and it just seemed like lord i prayed and i prayed and paul said i prayed three times this thing believed me he said but paul my grace is sufficient lord i don't know why and devil it makes you think well something wrong know that nothing wrong he given you the answer with it today it's just your birth pains coming on amen yield yourself more and more deny yourself take up your cross daily and follow him give way to self give way i mean give over to god decrease himself yield to him let's live let's walk let's look beyond the curtain of time god bless you sorry if i kept you along and you didn't like that you pray for me all right god bless you let's stand together brother if you would come brother jason i have a song i want to sing have sung and let me just remind you this one other thing here god able to prepare

take heart keep your thoughts um and say god open your word to me reveal to me my position if you don't know that if that's not a revelation let god reveal to you we always were in him you were always in the thoughts of him amen do you love him do you love me i love you amen god bless you we're going out of here together together bride togetherness we're going out together i didn't say as a church
