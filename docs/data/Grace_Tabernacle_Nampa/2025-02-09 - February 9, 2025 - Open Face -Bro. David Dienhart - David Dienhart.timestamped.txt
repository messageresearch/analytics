[1:05:35] about you have nothing to murmur
[1:05:39] about why because you're chosen in him
[1:05:42] what do you have to
[1:05:46] fear when your life was ordained before
[1:05:49] the foundation of the world and every
[1:05:51] step you make is ordained everything you
[1:05:53] do is ordained nothing can happen by
[1:05:56] chance to a True Believer it's all
[1:05:59] ordered of God and the Bible said your
[1:06:02] let's let's just go over there just a
[1:06:03] minute I just read that that's the part
[1:06:05] I want to get
[1:06:08] to the Lord is risen upon thee and His
[1:06:11] glory shall be seen upon thee but let's
[1:06:13] go to Psalms a minute Psalm 37 let's
[1:06:16] look at this a
[1:06:20] second Psalm 37 and verse 23 and 24 I
[1:06:24] brother preached this
[1:06:26] and that just struck me and I I just
[1:06:29] have to share it with you you say are
[1:06:31] you going to share what somebody else is
[1:06:33] preach the message why certainly it's a
[1:06:35] body ministry right my goodness I love
[1:06:39] to receive it and love to pass it on but
[1:06:42] I have to pass it on how I've been
[1:06:44] ordained to in the body and he had to
[1:06:45] pass it the way he was ordained to in
[1:06:47] the body and each one have an ordained
[1:06:49] position and place in the
[1:06:53] body amen is that right who is the
[1:06:57] body you say well it's the bride but
[1:06:59] who's the
[1:07:00] bride Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:07:03] and today and
[1:07:06] forever oh well you make yourself God
[1:07:09] yeah that's right depends what side of
[1:07:11] the veil you're looking
[1:07:13] at this human man David is not
[1:07:17] God but that inside the inside
[1:07:20] is amen this has got to change to that
[1:07:27] amen but he has already provided for me
[1:07:29] a new
[1:07:30] body is that right
[1:07:33] already for who he justified declared
[1:07:35] righteous he's also
[1:07:39] glorified all right now okay let's go
[1:07:43] here Psalm 20 37:23 the steps of a good
[1:07:46] man are ordered by the Lord and he
[1:07:50] delighteth in his way yes amen right
[1:07:54] look at verse 2 3
[1:07:57] 24 though he fall who who who who wait a
[1:08:01] minute though he fall I thought you just
[1:08:03] said my steps are ordered of God how
[1:08:05] could I fall
[1:08:09] right yeah you're going to have mistakes
[1:08:11] and errors you'll probably go out of
[1:08:13] this service to stay and say something
[1:08:15] you didn't want to say do something you
[1:08:16] didn't want to do and God will tell you
[1:08:18] to do and you'll disobey
[1:08:21] it I'm not calling you unbelievers I'm
[1:08:24] saying this is the body this is the
[1:08:26] humanness the truth does God forgive yes
[1:08:29] he does he forgave you before you even
[1:08:32] he knew brother Ram said he knew when
[1:08:34] you made that mistake he had already
[1:08:36] forgiven you because he knew what was in
[1:08:38] your heart not to do it hallelujah thank
[1:08:41] you Lord think of
[1:08:44] that all right if you want to find that
[1:08:48] number 20 the quotation on uh it's a
[1:08:51] quote out of out of uh August 17th uh uh
[1:08:55] book three of the family altar if you
[1:08:58] have
[1:08:59] it read what the prophet said there
[1:09:04] amen oh yeah he said did Brother Ram
[1:09:07] make mistakes did he disobey God he did
[1:09:10] he disobeyed him when he could have God
[1:09:12] could have kept him from doing what he
[1:09:14] did with his mother-in-law right do you
[1:09:17] realize that yeah look how he kept him
[1:09:20] from shooting these boys look how he
[1:09:23] kept him from committing suicide right
[1:09:25] but he allowed him to go through that
[1:09:27] what for Brother David what for for a
[1:09:30] Divine Purpose to be manifest in his
[1:09:33] life he had to form him y bring him to
[1:09:36] that purpose that God had purposed in
[1:09:38] himself and the Bible said you were
[1:09:40] already chosen in himself now are you
[1:09:43] not under that purpose or are you under
[1:09:45] that
[1:09:46] purpose
[1:09:48] amen is that right all right so we see
[1:09:52] here though he fall the steps are
[1:09:54] ordered though he fall God allowed you
[1:09:57] to fall that's right
[1:09:59] amen amen you can say what you want to
[1:10:02] say but look at what else he says he
[1:10:04] allowed you to fall but then turned
[1:10:06] right around and though he he but but he
[1:10:09] shall not be utterly cast down right
[1:10:13] there it is he's only let you go so far
[1:10:16] because
[1:10:17] why because he upholdeth because because
[1:10:21] for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand
[1:10:25] do you realize you're in his hand
[1:10:28] nothing can happen unless he allows it
[1:10:30] nothing can come your way unless he
[1:10:31] allows it you're in his
[1:10:37] hand praise the Lord you're in his
[1:10:41] hand
[1:10:43] okay so let's go back over here now we
[1:10:47] read Isaiah 60 Maliah 4:6 you say
[1:10:50] Brother David those are very fundamental
[1:10:52] yes they are but how many realize
[1:10:54] malakiah 4 a minute
[1:10:56] and tie it with first 2 Corinthians 3
[1:10:59] that we just
[1:11:00] read about he when it shall turn to the
[1:11:03] Lord when what shall turn to the
[1:11:07] Lord okay let's go over here to Malachi
[1:11:10] and we'll find out what's turned to the
[1:11:12] Lord now I'm sure you probably answer
[1:11:14] that before you get to it but we'll read
[1:11:17] it
[1:11:22] anyway malakiah 4:6 and and he shall
[1:11:25] turn the heart the
[1:11:28] what the
[1:11:30] heart of the children I'm reading the
[1:11:33] last portion of it he shall turn the
[1:11:34] heart of the children to the of the
[1:11:37] children to their
[1:11:40] fathers amen restore he's going to
[1:11:43] restore what the
[1:11:46] faith I want you to hold that not a
[1:11:49] faith he's going to restore perfect
[1:11:53] faith not in intellectual
[1:11:57] perfect there's only one perfect Faith
[1:12:01] that's God's own
[1:12:02] faith and if God's Own Faith to be God's
[1:12:05] own faith in you it had to be God in
[1:12:11] you
[1:12:13] amen he's going to restore that Faith
[1:12:16] who eternity What whose Hearts the
[1:12:18] children the
[1:12:20] seed he's going to turn the seed of God
[1:12:24] to the original faith of those
[1:12:28] fathers brother Ram said he would do two
[1:12:31] things the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:12:33] Revelation 10 does two
[1:12:35] things he restores the mystery amen and
[1:12:40] reveals the seven Thunder what the seven
[1:12:43] Thunder said are you with me all right
[1:12:47] and then he said those Mysteries
[1:12:49] contained in those Seven Seals the
[1:12:51] mystery of those Seven Seals would
[1:12:53] literally turn the heart of the children
[1:12:56] to the faith of the fathers then without
[1:12:58] the seal being opened you could not
[1:13:01] literally be turned to the original
[1:13:03] Faith but now the fullness of that time
[1:13:07] has come and he's turning that faith of
[1:13:09] those children back to realize they're
[1:13:12] Gathering into where they're Gathering
[1:13:14] into the very personal revelation of
[1:13:16] himself in
[1:13:19] them and to the reality of who they are
[1:13:25] it goes right hand in hand together all
[1:13:29] right so it's Jesus now watch he said
[1:13:32] here and I'm going to read
[1:13:38] uh I'm just going to give you this quote
[1:13:40] here first paragraph 290 this is the
[1:13:43] fourth time I've taken this over the
[1:13:44] last four meetings every meeting I've
[1:13:47] had to read this why because God is
[1:13:49] trying to get the reality to his people
[1:13:54] I cannot get away from this it's real
[1:13:57] and it's becoming more real all the time
[1:13:58] to the Bride Watch what he says
[1:14:01] paragraph 290 of Christ's the mystery of
[1:14:03] God revealed it's Jesus Christ the new

[1:14:50] have faith in what you are I just read
[1:14:53] to you what you are
[1:14:57] yes now watch this I'll go on with that

[1:15:46] preeminence is that he might
[1:15:48] Express Express his
[1:15:53] words what's the expression of words a
[1:15:56] thought
[1:15:58] spoken is the
[1:16:01] expression amen and the expression is
[1:16:04] when it's spoken it's made manifest so
[1:16:06] then he spoke he he expresses his words
[1:16:09] and anything that he promised in these
[1:16:12] last days he can bring it to pass
[1:16:14] through his
[1:16:17] body through what through his body is
[1:16:21] anybody here his body
[1:16:26] anybody that's the reality that's the
[1:16:28] Revelation that's your

[1:25:32] Fulfillment of every member of that body
[1:25:34] in that position watch The
[1:25:37] Rapture watch the change take place I'm
[1:25:40] going to preach on that one of these
[1:25:42] times when I have next time on the
[1:25:44] revelation of the
[1:25:47] Rapture Lord willing I usually don't
[1:25:50] announce what I'm going to preach on but
[1:25:52] but I'm not going to go any further with
[1:25:56] that because brother Ram said the bride
[1:25:58] is looking for the revelation of the
[1:26:02] Rapture amen all right now but look what
[1:26:06] he said now don't murmur no matter what
[1:26:08] is stay with it and God will work it all
[1:26:10] right the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:26:13] ordered of the Lord and he said and
[1:26:15] that's the
[1:26:16] truth though he
[1:26:18] fall oh my brother now God yeah God
[1:26:22] could keep you from falling and he has
[1:26:24] many times and he allows you to fall
[1:26:26] allows you to make mistakes I've had him
[1:26:28] do things and say things I disobeyed say
[1:26:30] I'm never going to do it again and
[1:26:32] disobey it again and disobey it again
[1:26:34] I've had things I've had things happen
[1:26:35] to me that were strange and unusual
[1:26:37] couldn't understand why it was all
[1:26:38] happening I made decision to leave
[1:26:41] something when I shouldn't have left
[1:26:43] it that's right I made a decision to
[1:26:46] leave the pastorship when I shouldn't
[1:26:47] have
[1:26:48] gone oh well now Brother David you sined
[1:26:51] no I didn't God's already taken care of
[1:26:53] that he allowed it for a purpose to get
[1:26:56] me and fulfill his purpose he allow you
[1:26:59] to go through the hardest and the
[1:27:00] strangest things for a Divine ter
[1:27:03] purpose that he himself purposed for you
[1:27:06] in that
[1:27:08] body now that's scripture you can go
[1:27:10] back David look at what David
[1:27:13] did did he kick him out and say you're
[1:27:15] out of
[1:27:16] here nope he allowed David to go through
[1:27:19] it what for a Divine
[1:27:20] Purpose look at all these other things
[1:27:24] and yeah you're going to suffer for it
[1:27:26] you're going to seow you're going to
[1:27:27] reap that doesn't do away with it but
[1:27:30] you're never going to be lost you're
[1:27:31] already sealed in so God is working it I
[1:27:34] hope you get this I could we could just
[1:27:36] take a lot more time on it but that
[1:27:38] Divine Eternal purpose of God must be
[1:27:40] fulfilled and he's going to do whatever
[1:27:43] he knows to do sovereignly to get you in
[1:27:45] that purpose of himself it's himself
[1:27:47] working through you to bring you into
[1:27:49] that
[1:27:50] purpose and you've got to fulfill it
[1:27:53] before you leave here
[1:27:55] right
[1:27:57] whoa that's pretty good isn't it you
[1:28:00] mean God be that perfect oh
[1:28:03] yes yes now so the footsteps the
[1:28:07] righteous are
[1:28:09] ordered and every one of us is given a
[1:28:11] different temperament well I don't like
[1:28:13] your temperament and you don't like mine
[1:28:15] but God gave me that temperament and and
[1:28:18] will work his own life and his own truth
[1:28:20] through my temperament do you realize
[1:28:23] that oh well you see he doesn't have
[1:28:25] love how come how do you how do you how
[1:28:28] do you say what love is it's either F or
[1:28:32] agape and agape love is beyond your
[1:28:34] reasoning and beyond your ability to
[1:28:36] even produce
[1:28:37] it but aelio love is human and many
[1:28:41] people will look at they they don't have
[1:28:42] love because they do this and they do
[1:28:44] this brother sister listen I could tell
[1:28:47] you where the Lord himself looked upon
[1:28:48] them with anger and braided cords and
[1:28:50] whipped them out of that Temple upset
[1:28:52] their cages and you tell me that was and
[1:28:54] it
[1:28:57] was that was
[1:28:59] love oh we we walked through two 2,000
[1:29:03] people by the pool of
[1:29:06] Bethesda in love divine love and went to
[1:29:10] one man when there was Halt and and
[1:29:12] blind and naked and and and and sickness
[1:29:15] and diseases all around him he could
[1:29:17] have said to the whole group arise and
[1:29:19] be
[1:29:19] healed but he went to one
[1:29:22] man so what is perfect
[1:29:27] love you see what I'm saying it goes be
[1:29:29] because I'll tell you who it is it's a
[1:29:32] person and when that person lives in you
[1:29:34] and abides in you you are in love with
[1:29:38] God because God loved you first he loved
[1:29:41] you first or he couldn't have put his
[1:29:43] holy spirit in you and identified you as
[1:29:45] being in that love amen now that's as
[1:29:48] perfect as it is I can say then why
[1:29:50] can't we relax and rest in the rest of
[1:29:52] how else he delad and guides
[1:29:56] us well Brother David I just don't
[1:29:58] understand he never said for you to
[1:30:00] understand it he said Do you believe
[1:30:02] what I've
[1:30:05] said quit trying to explain it try to
[1:30:08] reason with it the devil can wrap you
[1:30:10] around the pole through his reasoning
[1:30:12] right and he does and every one of you
[1:30:14] in here know he does that he does but
[1:30:16] God's bringing you up to your position
[1:30:18] in place and and showing you this is
[1:30:21] where your Victory is this is who you
[1:30:23] are this is what you're depend on this
[1:30:25] is your focus yes
[1:30:30] amen hey amen amen amen that's the focus
[1:30:35] that's what he wants you to see he said
[1:30:38] he said now I in myself he knew that
[1:30:41] with perfect Faith he was anointed
[1:30:43] Messiah that the spirit of God was upon
[1:30:46] him do you realize that the prophet said
[1:30:48] this when the word is revealed to you
[1:30:51] it's perfect faith that cannot fail

[1:30:57] word is revealed to you personally
[1:30:59] revealed to you it's perfect faith that

[1:31:27] can't fail
[1:31:30] today and if he didn't fail yesterday
[1:31:33] how are you going to fail
[1:31:35] today you say I you just said I did fail
[1:31:38] but there's an inner man that can't
[1:31:41] that's who he's pointing you to now is
[1:31:43] that inside of the
[1:31:45] inside that cannot fail that's already
[1:31:48] resurrection and

[1:37:34] in Matthew 25 in Matthew 24:27 said or
[1:37:39] 2437 excuse me heavens and earth will
[1:37:42] pass away but my word shall never pass
[1:37:44] away and the prophet said if you be that
[1:37:48] word and you become the word as you
[1:37:50] receive the word and if you in me and my
[1:37:54] word in you abides in you ask what you

[1:39:50] is over it's finished and when he
[1:39:52] reveals himself and you you're
[1:39:54] identified that you always were in

[1:40:27] Headstone who is that headstone where's
[1:40:29] what form is The Headstone
[1:40:32] in it's he The
[1:40:35] Headstone then who's the head of the
[1:40:38] body and they are one he can't s on
[1:40:42] something else it's word coming to word
[1:40:44] it's his word coming to his word it's
[1:40:46] Life coming to life amen you were
[1:40:50] predestinated to receive that life that
[1:40:52] germ was in him before the foundation of
[1:40:54] the world found you today that spoken
[1:40:57] word was The Germ that found you yes

[1:41:23] that
[1:41:25] book and opened and claimed his own
[1:41:28] people do you realize that's exactly
[1:41:30] what's happening he's claiming his
[1:41:37] own amen there's a people today that
[1:41:40] literally is Walking with
