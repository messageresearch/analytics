[25:51] [Music]
[25:54] oh
[25:57] [Music]
[26:06] and this world is worthy
[26:12] [Music]
[26:21] the power of
[26:27] [Music]
[26:36] and this
[26:44] i wanted a million
[27:00] [Music]
[27:12] [Music]
[27:14] spoken and clarified so clearly
[27:18] we could change the words of this song
[27:20] and say i have proof
[27:24] amen not some future tense of i might or
[27:27] it might be a possibility but i have
[27:29] proved that i'm one in a million and i
[27:32] am
[27:32] showing my my brother and sister let's
[27:35] look at the world around us and look
[27:37] what's happening and
[27:38] you'll see that there's such a great
[27:40] influence
[27:42] that that has come upon the world today
[27:44] that around us uh
[27:46] people are just compromising right and
[27:48] left and it's going to take
[27:50] an absolute infilling of the holy ghost
[27:53] which i believe
[27:54] god is fulfilling right now
[27:57] to stand in the hour that we are living
[28:00] and not compromise amen
[28:02] i'm i'm so glad that we can say thank
[28:04] you lord that we can stand on your word
[28:07] and not compromise
[28:08] on it amen uh so just uh
[28:11] just uh oh my my heart is stirred today
[28:14] i hope
[28:14] um as we speak today that uh
[28:18] i can convey to you the enthusiasm
[28:21] by which this topic had come to me and
[28:24] i hope you can take this with just a tad
[28:26] bit of humor but
[28:27] when our brother david was preaching a
[28:29] couple sundays ago
[28:31] i think i probably missed part of the
[28:33] service because i had a pen and a paper
[28:35] and i was just scribbling things down as
[28:37] fast as i could
[28:38] because an inspiration hit me and and i
[28:41] i just was
[28:42] thanking the lord amen you know let's
[28:45] just remember our kids
[28:47] uh going to camp our young people i
[28:49] should say not kids
[28:51] but our young people uh going to be
[28:53] going to camp and
[28:55] you know i pray you know what an awkward
[28:57] world we live in but i pray more of our
[28:59] young people if the lord tarries
[29:01] uh more of our young people next year
[29:03] will be able
[29:04] uh to go to school getting out late lots
[29:07] of factors that were there but
[29:09] uh anyway just let's be faithful i
[29:12] believe it's tuesday that they're
[29:13] leaving
[29:14] and going to spend this uh uh this
[29:17] coming week and through the weekend
[29:19] uh i i don't want our kids just come
[29:21] home and say i had fun as i mentioned
[29:23] the other day i don't want them to come
[29:24] home and say i'm so happy my team won at
[29:26] volleyball or
[29:27] soccer i want them to come home saying
[29:29] you know what i have a greater
[29:31] appreciation for who i am in jesus
[29:33] christ
[29:34] i know that i've been filled with the
[29:36] holy ghost and i know that i've made a
[29:38] decision to stand amen so
[29:40] let's remember them in prayer amen
[29:43] now i put this as a side note brother
[29:46] chris
[29:47] sent out to the youth group and i
[29:50] believe it would be the sunday
[29:52] afternoon of june 13th that youth group
[29:55] will be taking place at brother chris's
[29:57] house
[29:58] they'll be gone on the regular scheduled
[30:00] camp and so
[30:02] um let me say this carefully
[30:06] grace kids is not just following along
[30:10] uh in in some footsteps but still for
[30:13] the sake of the parents
[30:14] and and what is happening um we have
[30:18] if you would call it permission from
[30:19] brother sergey and sister yulia once
[30:21] again used their home
[30:22] so on sunday the 13th
[30:26] we will also have grace kids at brother
[30:29] sergey and sister yulia's house
[30:31] also so that makes it convenient for the
[30:33] parents when they come
[30:34] bring their older children to the youth
[30:37] group
[30:38] that it makes it very easy instead of
[30:41] having some split
[30:43] thing so i will announce this in this
[30:46] context
[30:47] uh grace kids will be meeting sunday
[30:50] june 13th five o'clock brother sergey
[30:53] and sister yulia's house and
[30:55] i have to say brother chris brought the
[30:57] youth group on himself but we have
[30:59] pressed
[31:00] the kids of sergey and sister yulia so
[31:02] we just say thank you
[31:04] uh they have a lovely backyard and it
[31:06] just is very convenient and we
[31:07] appreciate
[31:08] uh what they're doing and also i don't
[31:10] know that we announced that
[31:12] brother trevor and sister kerry are
[31:14] hosting a fellowship this afternoon
[31:16] and uh so i believe they have uh
[31:20] made everyone welcome if you didn't
[31:22] receive an invitation
[31:23] personally uh you know as someone like
[31:26] sending you a
[31:26] monogrammed letter uh you're all welcome
[31:31] that's how it works i don't want it ever
[31:32] to be that we have a fellowship that
[31:34] someone says
[31:35] i was not invited let me declare it to
[31:38] the heavens
[31:39] when there is a fellowship in this
[31:41] church that is termed as a fellowship
[31:44] everyone's invited don't don't use the
[31:46] excuse don't let the devil anoint you
[31:48] with the deal
[31:49] well i didn't get invited because let me
[31:52] just drop a note to you
[31:54] about two-thirds of the time i'm not
[31:58] invited
[32:00] but brother adam hit this right on the
[32:03] head yesterday
[32:05] where two or three are gathered in my
[32:06] name and then he laid this out and says
[32:09] we're family
[32:10] you see my brother and sister brother
[32:12] branham lays it in the message he says i
[32:14] didn't
[32:14] get invited to be a branham
[32:17] i was born of random my brother and
[32:21] sister
[32:21] we don't need an invitation to call
[32:24] ourselves part of the family of god
[32:26] here in grace tabernacle we were born
[32:29] into this
[32:29] god ordained this so anyone who ever
[32:32] lifts up this thing i wasn't invited i'm
[32:34] here right now this morning to just kill
[32:36] that spirit
[32:38] that the fact that it's happening you're
[32:40] invited
[32:41] now let me put it in a context all you
[32:44] old people
[32:45] if they're having a birthday for a
[32:47] four-year-old or three-year-old or a
[32:49] two-year-old or an eight-year-old
[32:51] that doesn't necessarily mean you're
[32:54] invited
[32:57] so let's separate the differences
[33:00] of what is happening you know we don't
[33:04] want to show up
[33:07] well anyway i'll just
[33:11] my shoe isn't that clean and i don't
[33:13] really feel like chewing on it so we'll
[33:15] just stop right there
[33:17] amen i'd like to speak to you once again
[33:19] saints um
[33:20] on redemption's
[33:23] we believe amen that the word of god
[33:25] will produce exactly what it said it
[33:27] would
[33:28] when he said let there be light
[33:33] we didn't have to come with a scientific
[33:37] cosmic explanation of how there's a
[33:40] possibility of light
[33:42] he said let there be light and there was
[33:44] light
[33:45] amen and so we are here today
[33:48] knowing that the word of god has
[33:50] declared there must be a manifestation
[33:53] right the seventh seal is the full plan
[33:56] of redemption
[33:57] completed amen not not talking about
[34:00] it the possibilities of what could be or
[34:03] how it might work
[34:04] but you see we have to understand my
[34:06] brother and sister just like our healing
[34:08] amen any of you need healing today i
[34:11] want you to just be able
[34:13] today to confess i'm not waiting for my
[34:16] healing
[34:16] my healing has already been purchased
[34:19] it's already
[34:20] finished and i believe it is my healing
[34:23] amen
[34:24] and so we just want to be able to
[34:27] realize
[34:27] that this whole plan of god this great
[34:30] mystery of god
[34:31] was for one purpose and that was to
[34:33] bring about redemption
[34:35] and it is a completed work we're not
[34:37] waiting for it to happen
[34:39] but it is done amen let's just stand we
[34:42] want to remember today
[34:44] our brother vasily out on the road and i
[34:46] don't know of any of those that we
[34:48] might forget forgive us today uh
[34:50] there'll be those that are not present
[34:52] with us today and
[34:53] and uh we just remember them uh in our
[34:56] hearts our brother bob sister joanne of
[34:58] course um
[34:59] i was visiting my mother yesterday and
[35:02] she just wanted you all to know that
[35:04] um she she loves you and appreciates you
[35:07] and um you know she she has that app and
[35:11] she goes and you know has some
[35:14] circumstances that keeps her from
[35:16] listening to the whole service they're
[35:19] pretty rigid about
[35:20] lunch is it 12 o'clock and she said so i
[35:23] don't
[35:24] get to hear what's beyond 12 o'clock
[35:26] because my
[35:27] long-winded preacher son it goes well
[35:30] beyond
[35:31] 12 o'clock and so i don't get to hear
[35:33] that but anyway she's thinking of you
[35:35] she's praying for you
[35:37] and wants to be remembered of you so
[35:40] and always we remember in our hearts
[35:42] brother prashant sister concha
[35:44] amen let's just turn your bibles this
[35:46] morning to matthew the seventh chapter
[35:49] the seventh first
[35:50] to the tenth and i want to speak to you
[35:53] today
[35:54] on the rapture is knocking
[35:58] amen so we are not my brother and sister
[36:01] just simply
[36:02] waiting there's no signs there's nothing
[36:04] but
[36:05] it literally is at the door and i had a
[36:08] much longer title
[36:09] and i will just share that i decided for
[36:12] reasons to just cut it down simple but
[36:15] the rapture is knocking at the door of
[36:17] your heart amen now the prophet of god
[36:20] shows us that the heart is a doorway
[36:24] into the soul
[36:26] and so it's knocking on our heart and
[36:28] when he gets
[36:29] each one of us beyond that point
[36:33] that it is complete it is finished work
[36:36] amongst the whole bride of christ
[36:38] we'll see a rapture it is not a fallacy
[36:41] uh you know you read some people's words
[36:43] and they say well
[36:44] do we have a scriptural uh evidence as
[36:47] it were of a rapture
[36:49] well my brother and sister uh those that
[36:51] believe say yes those that don't believe
[36:53] say no isn't that
[36:54] normal are there ufos those that believe
[36:57] say yes and those that don't believe say
[36:59] no
[37:00] is there healing those that believe say
[37:02] yes those that believe
[37:03] don't believe say no so it doesn't
[37:06] matter what we're talking about it's the
[37:07] position that
[37:08] you and i take
[37:11] oh i want to take sides with a word
[37:14] ever whatever the word says that's what
[37:17] i want to take sides with
[37:18] amen amen matthew the seventh chapter
[37:22] ask and it shall be given you
[37:27] seek and ye shall find knock
[37:30] and it shall be opened unto you
[37:34] now i want to just interject this real
[37:36] quick here
[37:37] my brother and sister
[37:41] the rapture is knocking on the door of
[37:44] our hearts
[37:46] i want to ask you today are you
[37:49] knocking on the door of the rapture
[37:57] you've got to want to be part of that
[38:00] you've got to be
[38:01] seeking it also
[38:06] whom if his son ask bread we'll give him
[38:08] a stone
[38:10] or if he ask a fish will he give him
[38:13] a serpent heavenly father we ask you
[38:16] today
[38:17] lord move in our midst and speak to our
[38:19] hearts
[38:20] father we look at the world around us
[38:22] and father
[38:24] we thank you that the prophet of god so
[38:26] clearly brought it to us that the
[38:28] greatest battle
[38:29] ever fought would not be over land it
[38:32] would not be over
[38:33] some kind of possession but the greatest
[38:36] battle
[38:36] ever fought would be in the mind and
[38:39] lord knowing that is a gateway father
[38:41] for our hearts and our hearts to our
[38:43] soul we realize how satan would battle
[38:46] for our mind control of the mind so
[38:48] greatly and
[38:49] lord we're in the world and the world is
[38:52] around
[38:53] us but we are not part of it and father
[38:55] i thank you for that that you've given
[38:57] us a place or a way to escape to let off
[38:59] the pressure
[39:01] and we i believe each one of us would
[39:03] recognize what it is lord to be subject
[39:05] to the pressures of this life
[39:07] those ones those things that would come
[39:10] and cause us to
[39:11] to disagree be grumpy angry maybe even
[39:14] lord help us shout and be
[39:19] completely upset with those we love with
[39:22] all of our heart
[39:24] and then we would recognize this is
[39:25] nothing but satan trying to pressurize
[39:28] us
[39:29] but lord you said that the pressure
[39:33] would drive the bride into and
[39:35] desperation
[39:36] would drive us not away from you lord
[39:40] oh thank you lord how this come out so
[39:42] clearly to us lord
[39:44] but desperation would drive us into the
[39:47] presence of god
[39:49] oh father let that be in our hearts and
[39:52] lives today
[39:53] we thank you father for your word and
[39:55] ask you to remember our brother david
[39:57] sister diane sister ruth lord as they
[39:59] would travel
[40:00] for the saints father that would be far
[40:02] flung lord
[40:05] would maybe hear even my brother
[40:08] jake this morning lord somewhere in
[40:09] montana on his way home
[40:12] father with this situation that's
[40:14] happened to sister lisa
[40:16] lord just bring a peace bring a comfort
[40:19] deal kindly with him and with them today
[40:22] lord
[40:23] father we love you and adore you in the
[40:25] name of jesus christ we pray
[40:27] amen you may be seated saints
[40:34] as we would look at these words i felt
[40:38] led to use this scripture
[40:41] because here it is speaking to you and i
[40:44] in a very positive tense that
[40:47] um what we have asked for
[40:51] shall be given us amen the scripture
[40:54] says
[40:54] that you have not because you ask not
[40:56] and
[40:57] then when you get in a position where
[40:59] you are in
[41:01] a flux you are in uh some kind of uh
[41:04] stress and strain or or under anointing
[41:07] of another kind
[41:08] then we ask a miss we don't even ask
[41:10] correctly
[41:11] so i pray that god would just move upon
[41:14] you and i today
[41:15] that we would be able to with confidence
[41:18] correctly come
[41:19] and ask for the right things in the
[41:21] right way and
[41:22] says that if you would seek you shall
[41:24] find and i say my brother and sister we
[41:27] know that no man has ever sought god but
[41:29] god has sought
[41:30] us and to knock and it shall be opened
[41:33] unto you and so
[41:35] we would see there that this and we'll
[41:37] carry this
[41:38] lord willing a little later in the
[41:40] service to to catch that
[41:42] about the knocking amen now we
[41:45] always understand we do understand uh
[41:48] that there are key factors that
[41:50] influence
[41:51] us and uh we approach god my brother and
[41:54] sister because of these influences
[41:56] as the scripture says to train up a
[41:59] child so
[42:00] we would have our children that they
[42:02] would be here
[42:03] in the midst uh this body of believers
[42:06] and and it is
[42:07] my brother and sister much of what we
[42:10] say and do
[42:11] uh how we approach this how's this uh
[42:14] very
[42:14] uh indelible impact upon our children
[42:18] and so it's oftentimes how we are
[42:22] taught is how uh we we are influenced by
[42:26] how we are
[42:26] taught and and you know if we uh
[42:28] approach
[42:29] this or are influenced by the teaching
[42:32] that god is unapproachable
[42:34] because in sister there is uh much
[42:37] teachings
[42:38] uh throughout the land and even some in
[42:41] our own midst that
[42:42] still are putting god at a distance to
[42:45] you and i
[42:45] and here again i want to just bring this
[42:47] up how we train up a child we
[42:49] the lord tarries we want our young
[42:51] children we want our young people
[42:53] to realize that god is right there
[42:55] accessible
[42:57] to them he is not a distant god he is
[42:59] not an uncaring god
[43:01] i knew a man many years ago uh had many
[43:04] struggles in his life and
[43:05] as it turns out he had been trained or
[43:08] taught as a young man
[43:10] that basically god was angry at humanity
[43:13] and once in our life and we'll feel like
[43:15] we come very short
[43:17] of of the word of god might feel like a
[43:19] complete failure
[43:20] and then the wheel falls off the car and
[43:22] we're sure that the wheel fell
[43:24] off the car because of what we did
[43:27] yesterday or last week and
[43:28] my brother and sister god doesn't
[43:30] operate that way and if god did make the
[43:32] wheel fall off your car he did it for
[43:34] your benefit
[43:35] not because he was angry the word of god
[43:37] shows that god clearly loves you as a
[43:39] husband loves his wife
[43:41] is how christ loves the church and my
[43:43] brother and sister
[43:44] no man the scripture says hateth his own
[43:47] flesh and
[43:47] so we are of the very dna of god and so
[43:51] it's there that the idea that satan
[43:53] would like
[43:54] to put out here in the world that we
[43:56] serve an indifferent god a
[43:58] a uncaring god an untouchable god an
[44:01] angry god is merely satan's way of
[44:04] constructing an
[44:05] atmosphere that influences you and how
[44:08] you approach god oh i'll tell you what
[44:11] my brother and sister when you catch
[44:13] that um god loves you so much that he
[44:16] was willing to give his life we all
[44:18] oh yes yes that's the scripture that's
[44:19] the scripture no that's a revelation
[44:22] that's a revelation when you finally
[44:24] understand just
[44:25] how much god loves you you might have
[44:29] been
[44:29] in sin and transgressions just you know
[44:32] the prophet of god
[44:34] yesterday just listening to him and he
[44:36] was talking about how that people would
[44:38] come and
[44:39] and they would be so far deep down in
[44:41] sin
[44:42] and they would be there and satan would
[44:44] do his very best to convince them
[44:47] that was their position but a loving god
[44:50] oh i love how he put that a loving god
[44:52] reach down into that
[44:53] and let you know that you always were
[44:56] his
[44:57] a loving god oh i thank you lord today
[45:00] to know that we serve a loving god
[45:03] amen not a god that is angry with us now
[45:07] we look at this and i just want to kind
[45:09] of lay a little foundation
[45:10] so hopefully you can catch the steps
[45:14] that we're taking this morning
[45:16] but in second timothy now he's actually
[45:19] kind of speaking to the preacher amen so
[45:23] it is there that i hope you can follow
[45:24] this he says preach the word
[45:28] right not preach a tradition
[45:33] not preach some kind of
[45:36] man-made doctrine but he says preach the
[45:40] word be instant in season out of season
[45:42] reprove rebuke
[45:46] exhort with all long-suffering and
[45:47] doctrine for the time will come when
[45:50] they will not
[45:50] endure now i want to try just a little
[45:52] bit to our last sunday service
[45:54] my brother and sister he who endures to
[45:56] the end
[45:58] see so there comes a time now when they
[46:00] will not
[46:01] endure sound doctrine so there's a
[46:04] shifting or a pulling back from sound
[46:06] doctrine
[46:06] now look we know that we have a position
[46:08] to take when we hear the word preached
[46:11] we either line up to the word or we bend
[46:13] the word to line up to us
[46:15] right there's really only two positions
[46:17] to take so we come to a place that we
[46:20] have to say
[46:21] whether it's ouch me oh my whatever it
[46:23] is that we will then
[46:25] line up with the word not asking for a
[46:28] compromise but
[46:29] willing to be moved and of course the
[46:31] word says that
[46:32] to those he loves he chastens so
[46:34] therefore sometimes
[46:36] the word is coming as a rebuke
[46:42] people don't like rebukes
[46:46] mostly it's pretty good that we would
[46:48] have the idea that we're all just going
[46:50] to go to heaven
[46:52] you know that's becoming a more and more
[46:54] prevalent
[46:55] teaching in the world today that this
[46:57] here life is just a little series of
[46:59] tests kind of like high school
[47:01] and in the end you're all going to
[47:03] graduate and get a diploma
[47:05] well they got that right but they didn't
[47:07] say where they were going after they got
[47:09] their diploma
[47:12] right so that's the watering down right
[47:14] everyone gets a diploma you finished
[47:16] this life you finished the race
[47:17] here's your diploma but sorry you didn't
[47:19] win
[47:21] not good all right not good
[47:25] for the time will come oh that reminds
[47:28] me though so something my
[47:29] daughter joe lynn shared with me god be
[47:32] with them today they flew to mexico
[47:34] yesterday morning to spend time with
[47:37] family
[47:38] uh so we want to remember them in prayer
[47:40] also
[47:41] but um you know joe lynn is working
[47:44] there
[47:44] in the high school or grades middle
[47:46] school whatever it is there in wilder
[47:48] and um a lot of students really like her
[47:51] she's firm but fair
[47:52] she's encouraging to them and they want
[47:55] her to be part of their
[47:56] graduation stuff and we were talking and
[47:59] she said well dad you must understand
[48:01] that
[48:01] it's not whether we can say we're
[48:03] christians or not
[48:04] right i i don't know i know there's
[48:06] others that have used the same phrase i
[48:08] it come upon me years ago and i've used
[48:11] it for many many years now
[48:13] uh but chino you know christian and name
[48:15] only we don't we don't want to
[48:16] be a christian in name only we want to
[48:18] be a christian amen because anyone can
[48:21] put any kind of name
[48:22] you know
[48:26] they will not endure sound doctrine but
[48:28] after now look at this oh this is my
[48:30] brother and sister
[48:31] i'm not going to defend the preacher
[48:33] every one of us will stand here brother
[48:34] chris myself here this morning brother
[48:36] david
[48:37] is gone but we'll stand before god and
[48:38] account for every single word we preach
[48:41] to you
[48:42] but you see sometimes people want to
[48:45] blame i'm not serving god today because
[48:46] of the preacher
[48:47] but that's not really what the jewel who
[48:50] will preach
[48:51] those things to them and so it is
[48:54] them searching for the preacher
[48:58] that will preach it in a way they can
[49:00] remain comfortable
[49:02] in their own life or as the term says
[49:06] they'll be comfortable in their own skin
[49:10] but that isn't what the gospel says
[49:11] right the gospel says we die to ourself
[49:14] that we
[49:15] change that we line up with the word of
[49:18] god not the word of god having to be
[49:20] shifted to line up with us
[49:21] and my brother and sister i'll just
[49:23] throw this out just so you'll you'll
[49:24] just do i don't mean to
[49:26] stir anybody up but around the message
[49:28] you know there's what they call the two
[49:29] soul
[49:30] doctrine and that is those people who
[49:32] are there saying well
[49:33] you know here we are sunday morning
[49:35] isn't it good to be in the house of god
[49:36] there's those missing from us
[49:38] uh you know but it's good to be here
[49:40] today and there's those that are here
[49:42] and my soul is hungry for the word of
[49:44] god and i want to make it to heaven
[49:46] but and when they go to work on monday
[49:48] then they might cheat a person here and
[49:50] do a little something here and lie a
[49:52] little bit there
[49:53] and so instead of letting the holy
[49:55] spirit change them
[49:57] somebody cooked up this whole idea that
[50:00] they're really
[50:00] two souls and there is that spiritual me
[50:03] and there is that carnal me and the
[50:06] carnal me can do these things that the
[50:08] spiritual me
[50:09] can't do but when i go to church the
[50:13] spiritual me
[50:14] is good in the eyes of god my brother
[50:17] and sister that's somebody searching out
[50:20] someone who will heap to themselves a
[50:22] teacher
[50:23] with itching ears they're there now i i
[50:26] don't want to change
[50:27] but the truth is is i like this man out
[50:30] here
[50:33] now the scripture says no man hateth his
[50:35] own flesh
[50:36] so let's be honest this morning saints
[50:38] there are certain things that we have to
[50:40] keep correcting in our life before god
[50:43] that seemingly come natural to us
[50:51] help us lord that's right brother chris
[50:54] help us lord
[50:56] because that thing that comes seemingly
[50:58] natural to us
[50:59] i always like to pick on the irish you
[51:01] know i've got a temper because my
[51:02] family's
[51:03] irish well my brother and sister you got
[51:06] uh i hope you follow me this morning
[51:07] nobody get confused you got a temper
[51:09] because you are
[51:10] believing to soul
[51:14] i'm just fine with god because i can
[51:17] fight a buzz all over here but when i go
[51:19] to church i never behave that way
[51:25] yeah no the thing is god wants you to be
[51:27] converted from that nature
[51:29] to this nature amen not to
[51:32] compromise well some people say i have
[51:36] balance in my life i've heard this
[51:38] before i have balance in my life
[51:41] on this side i'm very spiritual and on
[51:43] this side i'm very worldly and in the
[51:44] middle i have balance
[51:47] no i think the way it works no
[51:50] no no so we look at that see in the
[51:53] training my brother and sister
[51:55] now i want to just take a verse 4 here
[51:57] and touch on it
[51:59] and they shall turn away their ears from
[52:01] the truth
[52:03] so this is a point that there comes a
[52:05] time that that the people themselves
[52:07] have now found a preacher
[52:09] that preaches a form of the message
[52:11] they're comfortable with
[52:13] and so then they no longer well they'll
[52:16] say
[52:17] you know what we've we've been part of
[52:19] this for 40 years or 50 years my
[52:21] grandfather or whatever right on down
[52:24] you hear it even sometimes and i hope
[52:25] this don't bite anybody but
[52:27] we hear it sometimes while our family
[52:29] knew the prophet well that's good my
[52:31] brother and sister
[52:32] but if you have heap to yourself a
[52:35] teacher
[52:36] that is not preaching sound doctrine
[52:39] then it doesn't matter who your
[52:41] grandparents knew
[52:42] amen you'll find that when the truth
[52:44] comes they'll actually turn away from
[52:46] that truth
[52:47] because it doesn't fit what they think
[52:49] it doesn't fit
[52:50] the agenda and shall be turned into
[52:53] fables
[52:54] now i'll tell you what i preached this
[52:56] up in canada one time thought i was
[52:58] going to be a tartan feather before it
[53:00] was all over
[53:00] because my brother and sister the truth
[53:02] of it is i believe this message
[53:04] just to make sure anybody here or
[53:06] anywhere else will understand
[53:07] i believe this message just as much as
[53:09] any other human on the face of this
[53:11] earth
[53:11] but i tell you what i don't need a story
[53:14] from 50 years ago
[53:16] i need a real living god here in my
[53:19] midst
[53:20] this morning i don't need oh see this
[53:23] gets you in trouble
[53:24] i don't need a story about how brother
[53:26] branham this i like those stories
[53:28] i read those stories i listen to those
[53:30] stories and they encourage me to stand
[53:32] up
[53:32] but my brother and sister that story
[53:34] from 50 or 60 years ago
[53:36] will not be a substitute for the holy
[53:38] ghost today
[53:40] but people get into fables which are
[53:43] stories
[53:46] i don't want to belabor this but i want
[53:47] you you see because the story makes you
[53:50] feel good
[53:53] and i tell you there's things about
[53:55] these stories that happen that
[53:57] encourage me i'll can i take one moment
[54:00] just share one with you real quick
[54:02] brother bud southwick never knew him
[54:03] myself but i've known people that were
[54:05] bosom friends with him brother bud was
[54:08] what you would call
[54:09] a man's man in the sense that he was a
[54:11] man of the wilderness he was a man
[54:12] probably a lot of people around the
[54:14] message would say that man's too rough
[54:16] around the edges to be a believer
[54:18] because he was rough around the edges
[54:21] but this was a man that had the seed of
[54:23] god in
[54:24] him the germ of life was in him and he
[54:27] is there hunting with the prophet now
[54:29] don't you know
[54:30] that god knows what he's doing and here
[54:32] is brother bud
[54:33] he is believing this prophet he's
[54:35] believing this message
[54:37] he has seen the example he has felt the
[54:39] presence of almighty god
[54:41] before he ever gave his heart completely
[54:43] to the lord he knew this was something
[54:45] different than he had ever seen in his
[54:47] life
[54:48] and one night he's there they're sitting
[54:49] in the tent and he says well
[54:51] uh uh uh brother bill i i'm gonna go out
[54:54] and check the horses one last time
[54:56] and go outside check which way the
[54:58] breeze is blowing
[55:00] get off to the far end of the string
[55:01] where the horses are pull out a
[55:03] cigarette and lights a cigarette
[55:05] and the smoke is drifting away from the
[55:07] tent and he's out there in the dark
[55:09] puffing on a cigarette and he hears
[55:10] brother branham's voice
[55:12] hey bud when did you quit smoking
[55:20] he had a decision why i don't smoke
[55:24] no he had an anointing my brother and
[55:27] sister because he wasn't turning his
[55:29] ears
[55:30] to a preacher that told him you can have
[55:32] the holy ghost
[55:33] and smoke those evil things he was in
[55:36] the presence of someone who believed in
[55:38] the truth
[55:39] an anointing come upon him and he took
[55:41] as it were the shame upon himself and he
[55:44] says
[55:44] just now brother bill just now
[55:49] brother branham didn't say well you know
[55:50] what's good you this you're killing
[55:51] yourself you're this you're that
[55:53] it was just praise the lord you know
[55:57] what that encouraged me because there's
[55:58] been times
[55:59] oh i hope this applies to you not just
[56:01] me there's been times i've sat in church
[56:03] and the preacher has preached and they
[56:05] come anointing upon me and said paul
[56:07] when are you going to quit this
[56:09] and abel in my heart because i have this
[56:11] recollection of this story
[56:13] to be able to say just now lord just now
[56:17] i'm not going to give an excuse i'm not
[56:19] going to try and hide this
[56:20] i'm not going to try and coat it with
[56:21] butter or sugar i'm going to accept this
[56:24] it's god speaking that's what brother
[56:26] bud southwick said
[56:27] it wasn't brother branham speaking to me
[56:29] it was almighty god
[56:31] calling to me this is the moment
[56:36] but you see if we just feel good to tell
[56:38] the stories
[56:40] something's missing if we never
[56:44] change if brother bud had went on his
[56:47] next
[56:47] guide trip into the wilderness of
[56:49] british columbia and took a carton of
[56:51] cigarettes with him my brother and
[56:52] sister it would just be a story
[56:55] but we're talking about a real life god
[56:57] come down in the midst
[56:59] of that man's life changed him forever
[57:03] yeah but we got too many people that are
[57:07] willing to settle for stories
[57:09] i was brother branham here i was with
[57:11] brother branham there he told me this
[57:13] he told me that i could name names and i
[57:16] could put this out but it would not be
[57:18] good but my brother and sister there's
[57:20] people today that i'm personally
[57:22] acquainted with
[57:23] that are holding on to certain things in
[57:25] their life and according to the word of
[57:27] god the message of the hour
[57:29] those things are not right but when
[57:30] brother branham
[57:33] you fill in the blame everything will be
[57:36] all right
[57:37] no i'm sorry my brother and sister we
[57:40] have a message
[57:41] we have a word we have an answer
[57:44] amen the prophet don't need to come back
[57:47] right we've got it
[57:49] he gave us all that was necessary right
[57:51] did he not tell us
[57:52] that we have everything we need for a
[57:55] rapture is already
[57:57] inside of us we don't need someone to
[58:00] come back we need god
[58:02] we need the holy ghost hallelujah
[58:05] now i want to just carry this on a
[58:07] little bit if i could here
[58:10] you see my brother and sister we'll turn
[58:13] to titus
[58:14] once again speaking to the preachers
[58:19] because they're not exempt holding fast
[58:21] the faithful word
[58:22] has been taught that he may be able by
[58:25] sound doctrine to both exhort and to
[58:28] convince the gangsters
[58:31] so we're finding i'm laying this little
[58:32] foundation down to you
[58:34] that it is important that we do
[58:37] not get tired we do not get weary we do
[58:41] not get discouraged we do not get
[58:42] deceived
[58:43] and move away from sound doctrine god
[58:46] requires it through the word to his
[58:48] ministry
[58:49] and he will require it to you and i
[58:52] in titus 2 and 1 coming on just an
[58:55] extension of this thought into the next
[58:57] chapter
[58:58] but speak about the things which become
[59:01] sound doctrine so we see how important
[59:04] this is
[59:05] that that the foundation is built upon
[59:08] sound
[59:08] doctrine my brother and sister sound
[59:11] doctrine
[59:12] is the bible foundation of doctrine it
[59:18] is not
[59:18] another interpretation now i change
[59:21] those words around a little bit but
[59:23] you'll find that the prophet of god
[59:24] actually spoke that if it's necessary
[59:26] for people to
[59:27] to have that endorsement on that the
[59:29] prophet of god said everything has to be
[59:31] built upon the foundation
[59:33] of the bible now
[59:36] i want to move into just a little deeper
[59:38] and hopefully hopefully it makes sense
[59:40] this morning are we doing okay
[59:42] amen unto the angel of the church of the
[59:44] laodiceans right these saying saith the
[59:47] amen the faithful and true witness
[59:49] the beginning of the creation of god
[59:52] now we see my brother and sister as he
[59:54] is now
[59:55] starting to speak he spoke through these
[59:57] other six
[59:58] church ages and gave them a word for
[1:00:01] their day
[1:00:02] a word that was completely as we look
[1:00:03] back through history absolutely accurate
[1:00:06] of the needs and the times and the
[1:00:08] days that it was done and now he's
[1:00:10] speaking to the angel of the church of
[1:00:12] the laodiceans
[1:00:13] and he's telling them so these words
[1:00:16] that then follow
[1:00:17] and i kind of clip this out for the sake
[1:00:18] of time would know this scripture if we
[1:00:20] don't we should
[1:00:21] amen but in verse 20 says behold i stand
[1:00:24] at the door and knock
[1:00:28] so that means in the age that we're
[1:00:29] living christ is at the door
[1:00:32] knocking right no way to deny it no way
[1:00:35] to get around it we're not looking for
[1:00:36] another day in fact brother branham has
[1:00:38] words concerning that
[1:00:39] but i stand at the door and knock and if
[1:00:41] any man hear my voice
[1:00:45] and open the door i will come into him
[1:00:48] and will sup with him and he with me now
[1:00:51] i want to just uh focus for just a
[1:00:53] minute
[1:00:54] on on that right there we see my brother
[1:00:57] and sister
[1:00:58] how that it comes a time and it comes a
[1:01:00] place
[1:01:01] that we need to maybe put it into a type
[1:01:04] and
[1:01:04] and uh it is there you know it's pretty
[1:01:06] funny i've actually had this happen to
[1:01:08] me
[1:01:08] uh before you know and uh
[1:01:12] you you go to a door and you knock
[1:01:16] and you hear scurrying and you hear a
[1:01:18] chair sliding and you hear a clink of a
[1:01:20] glass
[1:01:20] but no one comes to the door you're not
[1:01:23] a bill collector
[1:01:25] you're a brother or you fought
[1:01:31] you see a decision was made the knock my
[1:01:34] brother and sister
[1:01:35] did not go silent the knock you heard on
[1:01:38] the outside
[1:01:39] is a knock that is heard on the inside
[1:01:42] are you with me
[1:01:43] amen so someone had to make a decision
[1:01:47] whether to respond to the knock and i
[1:01:50] can assure you
[1:01:51] that uh in case you guys ever decide to
[1:01:53] do this
[1:01:54] don't bother pulling the curtain back
[1:01:56] that's right beside the door they will
[1:01:57] see you
[1:02:00] but people will then peek out and
[1:02:01] they're like oh i don't want to talk to
[1:02:03] this person
[1:02:04] and they want to act like and ultimately
[1:02:07] word it in such a fashion when they see
[1:02:09] you at church
[1:02:10] in the coming week to to go oh you
[1:02:13] stopped by my house
[1:02:16] yeah yeah you had your blue frame
[1:02:18] glasses on you were in the window left
[1:02:20] of your deal
[1:02:21] i heard you set down your coffee cup and
[1:02:23] you tripped over the chair
[1:02:29] but you looked at the screen and some of
[1:02:31] you might say that you might have done
[1:02:32] that to me brother paul
[1:02:34] i might have i look at that
[1:02:42] not now i have a little button on the
[1:02:45] side of an iphone that you can push and
[1:02:46] the phone goes right on ringing
[1:02:50] but is now silent
[1:02:54] can someone say amen
[1:02:59] would someone be brave enough to say
[1:03:01] i've been there and i've done that
[1:03:04] hallelujah those that didn't lift your
[1:03:06] hand you must not have a telephone
[1:03:13] we could put that also into the type of
[1:03:15] the doorbell
[1:03:18] now we live in a day and age when they
[1:03:19] have these things called ring and
[1:03:21] whatever other names they have and now
[1:03:23] you don't even have to go to the curtain
[1:03:25] because the curtains right there on your
[1:03:27] phone
[1:03:29] and i can assure you your car is in the
[1:03:32] driveway
[1:03:33] your dog's barking your kids are in the
[1:03:36] backyard
[1:03:38] they know you're there but you look at
[1:03:41] your phone
[1:03:42] and it's like it's them
[1:03:46] we'll just act like we're not here well
[1:03:49] you be careful because somebody might
[1:03:51] call
[1:03:51] child protective services if you've left
[1:03:53] your dog
[1:03:54] alone in the house and your children
[1:03:57] alone
[1:03:58] in the backyard better off to have the
[1:04:02] courage to open the door and say god
[1:04:03] bless you brother god bless you sister i
[1:04:05] just don't want to deal with you
[1:04:09] at least they know where they stand
[1:04:13] you say brother paul you're being funny
[1:04:14] but my brother and sister this is
[1:04:16] exactly what it is when the holy spirit
[1:04:17] comes down in our midst and starts
[1:04:19] knocking in our life
[1:04:20] and we choose to ignore the knock
[1:04:23] because we
[1:04:24] think we can act like we didn't hear we
[1:04:27] didn't know
[1:04:28] it didn't happen to us come on saints
[1:04:33] let's not let's not think we can just
[1:04:34] ignore this knock
[1:04:49] but let me just go on couple thoughts
[1:04:51] that just came on my mind there i think
[1:04:52] sometimes we shouldn't speak everything
[1:04:54] that we think
[1:04:55] can someone say amen to that but look
[1:04:58] the rapture
[1:05:00] is knocking can someone say amen to that
[1:05:03] the rapture is knocking there
[1:05:04] is a people that the holy spirit has
[1:05:07] come down
[1:05:08] into the age and he says you know what
[1:05:10] behold i
[1:05:11] stand i didn't it isn't me it isn't the
[1:05:14] preacher
[1:05:14] it isn't paul the pastor or this person
[1:05:16] or that person it's god himself says
[1:05:18] behold i stand at the door and knock and
[1:05:21] if any man would hear my voice
[1:05:24] and we know the word of god says that he
[1:05:26] closes the eyes and the ears of those
[1:05:28] of the unbeliever and he opens the eyes
[1:05:31] and the ears of
[1:05:32] the believer so it's still there now
[1:05:35] on our court that god is speaking to you
[1:05:38] and i
[1:05:39] this is not some random person out here
[1:05:41] this is not the person that will never
[1:05:43] move
[1:05:44] of the spirit of god and receive it this
[1:05:46] is you and i
[1:05:47] the people that we call believers the
[1:05:49] people we say
[1:05:50] we're filled with the holy ghost and god
[1:05:52] is knocking you say but isn't this just
[1:05:54] about salvation
[1:05:55] no this might be about some unbecoming
[1:05:58] thing
[1:05:58] in your life and god's knocking
[1:06:01] it's time to deal with that it's time to
[1:06:05] let that complex go
[1:06:07] it's time to respond to my word it's
[1:06:10] time to move forward time to grow
[1:06:13] and i don't want to grow you know i i'm
[1:06:16] probably i'm trying not to be so
[1:06:18] transparent saints not that i've got
[1:06:19] something to hide from
[1:06:20] but you know sometimes i realize i'm
[1:06:22] probably not beneficial
[1:06:24] but you know sometimes
[1:06:27] the other day i told jerry i'm not
[1:06:28] dealing with this deal i'm not doing
[1:06:29] this i'm not doing this
[1:06:31] she gets this smirk on her face i hope
[1:06:33] she don't mind sharing this i've thrown
[1:06:34] her under the bus so many times she
[1:06:36] should be used to it by now
[1:06:39] and she gets a smirk on her face and she
[1:06:41] goes off and usually when my wife has a
[1:06:42] smirk on her face
[1:06:45] it's better to deal with it sooner than
[1:06:46] later because the smirk grows into
[1:06:48] something bigger
[1:06:50] and i was like what are you what is your
[1:06:51] deal and she says
[1:06:53] well you just don't want to be an adult
[1:06:58] today
[1:07:02] and you know i was so anointed by that
[1:07:04] spirit i was like
[1:07:05] you're right i am not going to be an
[1:07:08] adult today
[1:07:15] it didn't work
[1:07:21] the word of god shows us the prophet
[1:07:23] reiterates it you won't hear his voice
[1:07:26] unless it's been made known to you
[1:07:31] some people can't respond to that saints
[1:07:34] we've been given the word the anointing
[1:07:36] of the hour the revelation for our age
[1:07:39] and if god is speaking don't ignore the
[1:07:42] voice
[1:07:44] god's doing that for you and for i he's
[1:07:47] coming he's speaking for our benefit
[1:07:49] he's not here to tongue-lash us he's not
[1:07:51] here to beat us to brutalize us to lash
[1:07:54] us
[1:07:54] you know to oppose to leave us there my
[1:07:57] brother and sister he's doing this for
[1:07:59] our benefit
[1:08:00] and if any man would hear my voice can
[1:08:02] someone say lord let me hear your voice
[1:08:04] today
[1:08:05] and open the door see it takes an action
[1:08:08] beyond just hearing the voice
[1:08:09] we've got to open the door oh god let me
[1:08:12] be quick let my feet be
[1:08:13] fleet as it says in the book of psalms
[1:08:15] let my feet
[1:08:16] go quickly to thy presence
[1:08:20] and open the door and say lord i've been
[1:08:23] dealing with
[1:08:24] this and i've been pushing it now i know
[1:08:25] none of you do this but sister jerry and
[1:08:27] i just moved here recently
[1:08:29] and we've we it was almost like a
[1:08:30] treasure hunt
[1:08:32] and ignored for so long tried to bury it
[1:08:35] for so long
[1:08:38] come on saints i know i'm preaching to
[1:08:41] you
[1:08:42] because you're human
[1:08:47] some of you didn't even say amen wow
[1:08:53] so what is this i will sup with him
[1:08:57] he with me i tell you what there's
[1:08:59] nothing nicer than feeding
[1:09:01] on the word of god with the lord with
[1:09:04] the holy spirit present
[1:09:06] come and dine amen so as it looked my
[1:09:09] brother and sister we'll find now
[1:09:11] as this is it's showing here even as i
[1:09:14] overcame and sat down with my father and
[1:09:15] his throne he that hath an ear let him
[1:09:17] hear what the spirit
[1:09:18] saith unto the churches and the spirit
[1:09:20] is speaking today we have a word
[1:09:22] a sure word of prophecy for our day and
[1:09:25] if you are hiding in a hole you will not
[1:09:27] know this
[1:09:28] but there is literally dozens of
[1:09:30] scriptural prophecy
[1:09:32] and prophetic prophecy has come to pass
[1:09:35] in the last year well you say but
[1:09:38] they're they're not
[1:09:39] this and how can you be certain well my
[1:09:41] brother and sister no i'm not
[1:09:42] i don't know kamala harris might be that
[1:09:45] woman the prophet of god was talking
[1:09:46] about
[1:09:47] she wouldn't be in my book but anyway
[1:09:49] you know so you look at that
[1:09:50] but it might be according to god's word
[1:09:52] that she would be that one very much
[1:09:54] looks like we have a president
[1:09:56] who is out absolutely uh cognitively
[1:09:59] dysfunctional
[1:10:00] and and it's there that he appears that
[1:10:03] he's just being coached and led along
[1:10:05] some people use the word puppet
[1:10:06] we should show a respect it's hard
[1:10:10] but we should and we can look at all
[1:10:12] these signs and whether that's the exact
[1:10:14] sign or not we have people are like well
[1:10:16] until i have proof that's a sign i'm not
[1:10:18] going to do it well i'll tell you what
[1:10:20] the prophet of god said it the scripture
[1:10:21] says it
[1:10:22] it is going to come to pass whether that
[1:10:25] is the individual that fulfills it or
[1:10:27] not
[1:10:27] it's coming and so if that is coming
[1:10:31] and the word of god can't fail then when
[1:10:33] the word said there would be sons and
[1:10:35] daughters of god
[1:10:36] when it got so dark that people didn't
[1:10:39] think
[1:10:39] there was any way possible he said i
[1:10:42] will be the light
[1:10:43] that shines from the darkness i will be
[1:10:46] the light that shines out of
[1:10:48] zion into your pathway it's coming
[1:10:51] saints
[1:10:52] you just need to stand on the word and
[1:10:54] believe it and if whether you think that
[1:10:56] is the exact sign of the time
[1:10:58] that's fine but i tell you it is coming
[1:11:01] it is coming to a day that they will try
[1:11:03] to silence your voice
[1:11:05] it is coming look what's happening in
[1:11:06] canada up there in edmonton
[1:11:08] it's happening to a bunch of churches
[1:11:10] there in that area
[1:11:12] that they put they put chain link fences
[1:11:14] around the whole church
[1:11:15] so no one could even come close and then
[1:11:17] told the church you'll pay the bill for
[1:11:19] this
[1:11:21] they come to another church maybe that
[1:11:23] church has different ideas
[1:11:25] they've come to that church escorted
[1:11:26] everybody out locked it up they had
[1:11:28] church on the lawn
[1:11:29] and now a judge is telling you keep this
[1:11:31] up we'll take it all away from you and
[1:11:32] make it ours
[1:11:35] you don't think it can happen we live in
[1:11:38] conservative old idaho might be one of
[1:11:40] the last places that happens but the
[1:11:41] word of god says
[1:11:43] prophet said there'll come a time
[1:11:46] they'll turn your church
[1:11:48] into a sore house
[1:11:53] but he also said
[1:11:56] the bride would be gone
[1:12:01] come on amen hallelujah eat the hat and
[1:12:04] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:12:06] unto the churches
[1:12:07] now look we move on right here into the
[1:12:08] fourth chapter and john now is speaking
[1:12:11] after this i looked and behold
[1:12:13] a door was opened in heaven but if god's
[1:12:16] not dealing with you personally
[1:12:19] not talking to you personally
[1:12:22] if all you're getting out of this
[1:12:25] is coming through another channel
[1:12:27] through a person
[1:12:28] i ask you to get down and pray and get
[1:12:30] serious
[1:12:32] we're in a season right now that god is
[1:12:35] talking to sons and daughters of god
[1:12:38] the prophet of god said lip to ear
[1:12:43] this is a season my brother and sister
[1:12:44] not to expect it to come from somewhere
[1:12:46] else but it comes from almighty god
[1:12:48] directly to you brother and sister if
[1:12:51] you don't care enough
[1:12:52] to get in a position for god to speak
[1:12:54] lip to ear to you
[1:12:55] then you've got more troubles in your
[1:12:57] life than you ever thought
[1:13:05] see we look at this and we we catch this
[1:13:09] revelation as it were now first
[1:13:11] thessalonians some people
[1:13:13] would say is there really a rapture uh
[1:13:15] you know in my studies looking around
[1:13:17] you've got these whole crowds and
[1:13:18] they're like well you know
[1:13:19] we think the rapture is a figurative
[1:13:21] thing well that's good
[1:13:23] i figure i'm in it so that's figurative
[1:13:25] enough for me
[1:13:27] amen first thessalonians the fourth
[1:13:30] chapter verse 14 says
[1:13:32] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:13:34] rose again right first
[1:13:35] first point on the checklist we have to
[1:13:37] be able to check off
[1:13:38] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[1:13:41] will god bring
[1:13:42] with him for this we say unto you by the
[1:13:46] word of the lord so he
[1:13:49] either was light or this
[1:13:53] is god speaking
[1:13:56] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:13:58] the coming of the lord shall go through
[1:14:00] the tribulation and be tortured and
[1:14:02] driven
[1:14:02] and be beaten and
[1:14:12] oh i was
[1:14:15] in the wrong deal wasn't i
[1:14:20] that we which are alive
[1:14:24] oh i hope you catch these saints and
[1:14:27] endure unto the coming
[1:14:30] of the lord we've got to still be
[1:14:33] remaining
[1:14:34] we're going to still be here serving him
[1:14:36] it can't be that we say
[1:14:38] you know 15 years ago or at this stage
[1:14:40] of my life i was on fire for the lord
[1:14:42] praise the lord god owes me to
[1:14:43] to do something no my brother and sister
[1:14:45] we've got to be still
[1:14:47] enduring amen i hope you don't mind me
[1:14:50] taking that little bit of liberty with
[1:14:52] this
[1:14:52] but you've got to be alive and remaining
[1:14:55] in
[1:14:56] the service of the lord
[1:15:03] until the coming of the lord shall not
[1:15:05] prevent them which are asleep
[1:15:07] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:15:09] heaven with a shout and with the voice
[1:15:10] of the archangel
[1:15:11] and with the trump of god and no this
[1:15:13] isn't donald
[1:15:15] trump i'm serious there's all kinds of
[1:15:19] these churches out here
[1:15:22] oh there it is there it is there it is
[1:15:24] there it is the prophet of god i've
[1:15:26] heard message people the prophet of god
[1:15:27] said there would be like a superman come
[1:15:29] in the last days
[1:15:30] well you know what they have some poster
[1:15:31] thing of donald trump standing here
[1:15:33] ripping his suit open and it's superman
[1:15:35] poster behind it
[1:15:36] i tell you what there ought to be some
[1:15:38] of those people that believe that he's
[1:15:39] the superman
[1:15:40] uh they they might just very well just
[1:15:43] ought to buy that poster and hang it up
[1:15:46] but i'm sorry my brother and sister the
[1:15:47] superman that they're gonna be is is
[1:15:49] going to be
[1:15:50] a pope that comes with a solution
[1:15:53] to hunger and poverty and violence and
[1:15:57] wars and pestilences
[1:15:59] there's a superman because i can tell
[1:16:01] you even as rich as donald trump is you
[1:16:03] don't have enough money to even be a
[1:16:04] drop
[1:16:05] in the bucket
[1:16:09] but the one who controls the wealth
[1:16:12] of the world look it up see what the
[1:16:14] prophet talks about one who controls the
[1:16:16] wealth of the world
[1:16:18] will have that kind of influence in fact
[1:16:21] already right all them big businesses
[1:16:23] met with the pope how can we change the
[1:16:24] world we pledge
[1:16:26] billions you imagine how the
[1:16:29] pope probably thought that was actually
[1:16:31] kind of funny
[1:16:32] in the deep rooted side because he would
[1:16:35] have said i already own you
[1:16:38] you're pledging something i already own
[1:16:40] you
[1:16:44] now i don't mean to preach my opinions
[1:16:46] but i just see all these little things
[1:16:48] saints it's things the prophet of god
[1:16:49] said a little isolated thing here you
[1:16:51] say well brother paul you're putting
[1:16:52] them together
[1:16:53] well you know what maybe i am but i
[1:16:54] believe these things are words that were
[1:16:56] spoken
[1:16:57] and you take and you can put a direct
[1:16:59] line between them
[1:17:00] and this event direct line between this
[1:17:03] and it's not a doctrine we're not
[1:17:05] creating a doctrine what we're doing
[1:17:06] is taking the timeline by which god
[1:17:09] revealed it to a prophet
[1:17:10] that he saw certain things take place
[1:17:13] and then you can see that those certain
[1:17:15] things don't have to be all tied
[1:17:16] together
[1:17:17] they don't have to have a string
[1:17:18] connected to them but he says right here
[1:17:20] all the way back in the 50s saints he
[1:17:22] speaks things
[1:17:23] that are so perfectly in tune with what
[1:17:25] is taking place
[1:17:26] right now that you cannot deny it
[1:17:31] but those which are alive and remain
[1:17:33] endure
[1:17:34] shall be caught together with them in
[1:17:35] the clouds to meet the lord in the air
[1:17:37] so shall we ever be with him wherefore
[1:17:40] comfort one another with these words
[1:17:42] if that doesn't mean there's going to be
[1:17:44] a body change if that doesn't
[1:17:46] declare that there's going to be a
[1:17:48] calling out a raising up my brother and
[1:17:50] sister i don't know what scripture that
[1:17:51] you need or
[1:17:52] how much you need to influence that now
[1:17:55] look right here in the message the
[1:17:56] rapture um
[1:17:58] i guess you can probably tell what i've
[1:18:00] been thinking
[1:18:03] but to the church the bride
[1:18:06] see clearly identifies that right we're
[1:18:08] not talking church like up the road or
[1:18:10] down the road
[1:18:11] amen although i keep telling sister
[1:18:14] jerry that church that's just beyond the
[1:18:15] mega church down here a few blocks
[1:18:17] only has about 10 cars there on sunday
[1:18:19] and i've i don't know
[1:18:20] i might be covered in but i'm thinking
[1:18:22] you know what they don't they can't
[1:18:23] utilize that but we could
[1:18:26] it's got grass and it's got a bigger
[1:18:27] parking lot i don't know we might
[1:18:30] might slip down there in the middle of
[1:18:31] the night and just go lay hands on their
[1:18:32] building
[1:18:38] to the church the bride the rapture
[1:18:42] is a revelation to her now my brother
[1:18:45] and sister this is not
[1:18:46] us going back into thessalonians and
[1:18:49] saying oh here it is sure enough there
[1:18:50] it is in the scripture
[1:18:51] this is now the word applied this is the
[1:18:55] word manifested
[1:18:56] and now the rapture is becoming a
[1:18:59] revelation
[1:19:00] to you and i and what is revelation
[1:19:03] something revealed
[1:19:07] i see myself i hope i don't sound
[1:19:09] presumptuous
[1:19:10] put yourself in this i see myself
[1:19:13] in the rapture i see myself fulfilling
[1:19:17] all of these parts that are necessary
[1:19:19] every ingredient
[1:19:21] has been put in and it's now coming
[1:19:23] together
[1:19:24] and i see myself in the rapture i
[1:19:26] recognize that people would contest that
[1:19:28] how dare them say they are the rapture
[1:19:30] or the raptures taking place in the
[1:19:32] rapture is an event well i'm telling you
[1:19:34] the event is now
[1:19:36] it is not some day in the future the
[1:19:39] body
[1:19:39] change is taking place right now
[1:19:43] because i can tell you i may not be what
[1:19:45] i ought to be
[1:19:46] but i can thank god today i am not what
[1:19:49] i used to be
[1:19:50] because there is a body change taking
[1:19:54] place
[1:19:54] and i've got a mind in this body and
[1:19:56] i've got a heart in this body
[1:19:58] and i've got a soul in this body and
[1:20:00] it's all coming together
[1:20:02] and it's changing oh people are just
[1:20:06] like i've been 40 years you still got a
[1:20:08] temper
[1:20:08] you still don't come to church you still
[1:20:10] got a super super super big screen in
[1:20:12] your house
[1:20:13] and you watch whatever they throw in
[1:20:15] that filthy thing and try to justify it
[1:20:17] you've got books and magazines
[1:20:19] and you're busy busy busy with
[1:20:21] everything but god
[1:20:22] and you say well i believe the message
[1:20:24] my family's been in for 50 years
[1:20:26] my brother and sister that is here and
[1:20:28] the wheat is being thrashed
[1:20:30] and everything else is being bound
[1:20:32] together and burnt
[1:20:35] am i preaching too hard okay i'm just
[1:20:38] getting excited the other day sister
[1:20:39] jerry's like you realize you're yelling
[1:20:41] at me no i didn't realize that i'm sorry
[1:20:44] but you look at this my brother and
[1:20:46] sister you see that the revelation the
[1:20:48] true bride of christ will be
[1:20:50] waiting she's not going to sit there and
[1:20:53] go well someday it'll show up
[1:20:55] if god wants me to have a revelation of
[1:20:57] the rapture then god will give it to me
[1:20:59] what's happening my brother and sister
[1:21:00] they're waiting for that revelation
[1:21:02] because they know it's coming
[1:21:06] they know that god is going to speak to
[1:21:09] them
[1:21:10] did you know that my brother enoch oh
[1:21:13] yes i can
[1:21:14] i can trace my bloodlines right back i'm
[1:21:16] enoch's brother
[1:21:19] and my brother had a revelation of a
[1:21:22] rapture
[1:21:23] that it wasn't hey one of these days
[1:21:26] praise the lord i get out of my house
[1:21:28] payment i get out of my car payment i
[1:21:30] get out of this payment and that payment
[1:21:32] i get out of this stuff i get out of
[1:21:34] this ugly old world
[1:21:35] no my brother and sister that was not
[1:21:37] the revelation of the rapture that epoch
[1:21:39] had
[1:21:39] enoch had a rabbit revelation of the
[1:21:41] rapture and every day he got up and said
[1:21:44] oh god
[1:21:45] oh god let me please you today let me
[1:21:47] live a life today lord
[1:21:49] that would be worthy of your gospel lord
[1:21:52] i want to please you
[1:21:56] he wasn't counting the days down oh
[1:21:58] another day gone i'll be out of here
[1:22:00] another day gone what was he he was
[1:22:02] concerned about the here and now
[1:22:03] he was concerned about lord let my life
[1:22:05] today in this moment lord
[1:22:07] let my life be pleasing
[1:22:10] you see what satan's doing to us he's
[1:22:13] getting us so caught up in this this
[1:22:14] this this and this
[1:22:16] we forget our sole purpose is to please
[1:22:18] god
[1:22:22] i preached about enoch a few times
[1:22:28] i tell you i was preaching about enoch
[1:22:30] south africa
[1:22:33] and it had to be the hand of the lord
[1:22:34] because i was walking down an aisle in
[1:22:36] the church
[1:22:37] i didn't know anybody from anybody and i
[1:22:40] stopped right at the end of a pew
[1:22:42] of a brother it turns out it had a
[1:22:44] mental breakdown
[1:22:46] and any kind of pressure threw him in
[1:22:48] such a deal that he just couldn't even
[1:22:50] function
[1:22:52] and god in his grace and mercy saints
[1:22:54] had nothing to do with this man right
[1:22:56] here i was so oblivious
[1:22:58] in fact when the man leaped out of his
[1:22:59] chair and started screaming and shouting
[1:23:01] and jumping around
[1:23:02] it scared the fire out of me because i
[1:23:05] had stopped
[1:23:06] right here at the end and he is sitting
[1:23:08] right here
[1:23:12] you say bro paul that's just so simple
[1:23:14] just
[1:23:15] please god is it simple saints i want to
[1:23:20] ask you be honest with yourself today
[1:23:22] is it simple to get up every single day
[1:23:25] and live a life
[1:23:27] it's pleasing to god
[1:23:31] come on i don't know if you got any
[1:23:32] feedback but i'll tell you what it's a
[1:23:33] fight in my house
[1:23:35] well wait i don't i don't want to brush
[1:23:38] sister jerry without it there's a fight
[1:23:39] in
[1:23:39] my house
[1:23:44] because i have a mouth and i have
[1:23:48] body english my
[1:23:51] body english speaks louder than my mouth
[1:23:54] does
[1:24:00] yes but back to the brother in south
[1:24:03] africa
[1:24:04] do you know right there saints a
[1:24:06] revelation
[1:24:08] touch this brother i can live it i can
[1:24:11] live it
[1:24:12] i can be pleasing to god i am not a man
[1:24:15] who is mentally crippled and emotionally
[1:24:18] crippled and i guess he shared later he
[1:24:21] made a commitment right there as he was
[1:24:23] leaping to his feet
[1:24:24] i am free
[1:24:30] not only did the lord give him back to
[1:24:32] his rightful position
[1:24:33] oh here you know let me just go ahead
[1:24:35] and finish the story it does have
[1:24:36] some very good content
[1:24:40] you see the prophet of god said often
[1:24:42] times the wife
[1:24:44] rises up and becomes dominating in her
[1:24:46] spirit
[1:24:47] taking that headship role because
[1:24:52] she's just a mean rotten woman
[1:24:56] is that what he said what did he say
[1:25:00] because the husband won't
[1:25:05] and the wife had to go out of the house
[1:25:07] and get a job
[1:25:09] and the wages were not sufficient enough
[1:25:11] so she had to devote herself to learn to
[1:25:13] type and to do this and to do that and
[1:25:14] she rose up and got more and more
[1:25:16] responsibility more and more
[1:25:17] responsibility more and more pressure
[1:25:18] and then she's coming home to a husband
[1:25:20] who has emotionally mentally just
[1:25:23] crippled because of this mental
[1:25:24] breakdown
[1:25:25] and she become quite domineering
[1:25:30] because she would come in the home and
[1:25:32] it was like you do this you do this you
[1:25:33] do this
[1:25:34] everybody sunday morning get dressed
[1:25:35] we're going to church you get more
[1:25:38] and then her family started fracturing
[1:25:43] i can speak this because the son is now
[1:25:45] serving god but
[1:25:46] their son had a very beautiful voice
[1:25:49] decided he
[1:25:50] was elvis reincarnated and he sounded
[1:25:53] like him
[1:25:55] but he got banished from the church
[1:25:56] because he was then teaching
[1:25:58] hey sister gabrielle you want to learn
[1:26:00] to sing like elvis
[1:26:02] sister donna sisters you want to learn
[1:26:04] to speak
[1:26:05] come brothers we can all sing and we can
[1:26:09] we can also do that other stuff like
[1:26:10] elvis they're like you're out of here
[1:26:15] so he's not in church now he's gonna
[1:26:17] find someone else to hang out with and
[1:26:18] they thought it was great
[1:26:22] and i had one daughter that was in such
[1:26:25] turmoil
[1:26:26] i won't go into all the details but she
[1:26:29] tattooed herself
[1:26:32] and it was a tattoo that reflected her
[1:26:34] emotion
[1:26:36] of how she did that and she tattooed the
[1:26:39] words hate
[1:26:40] into her forearm
[1:26:46] but there come a time because it's a
[1:26:50] revelation of faith
[1:26:51] there come a time that god said i've put
[1:26:53] up with enough
[1:26:55] and it's time it's a season for my
[1:26:57] people a jubilee
[1:26:58] and god come right down and started with
[1:27:00] one daughter and delivered her by the
[1:27:03] grace of god
[1:27:04] and then that come and another daughter
[1:27:06] they had a daughter that was just sold
[1:27:07] out to the lord just serving the lord
[1:27:09] and we got to see right there in a
[1:27:11] little short time my brother sister
[1:27:13] not brother paul not sister jerry god on
[1:27:16] the seat
[1:27:17] god doing a work and we saw a little
[1:27:20] girl delivered
[1:27:21] and then we saw a mother suddenly
[1:27:23] realize god is on the scene
[1:27:25] i thought i'd lost another child we got
[1:27:28] to see on a sunday morning
[1:27:29] god stop at the end of a pew oh yes i'll
[1:27:32] be bold enough to tell you
[1:27:34] god stopped at the end of his pew
[1:27:38] and god said now is the season my son
[1:27:41] stand up and claim your deliverance
[1:27:45] and the power of god moved and now a few
[1:27:48] years down the road
[1:27:49] we have a son married to a catholic girl
[1:27:52] while living he was living with a
[1:27:53] catholic girl
[1:27:54] and it was there that god had allowed a
[1:27:57] word to be spoken
[1:27:58] your son will serve me and then the day
[1:28:02] comes
[1:28:02] that he and his girlfriend walk into
[1:28:04] church go to an
[1:28:05] altar give their heart to the lord my
[1:28:09] brother and sister
[1:28:09] don't tell me god's not on the scene
[1:28:12] don't tell me that god
[1:28:13] is blind to what is happening in our
[1:28:15] world don't tell me my brother and
[1:28:17] sister
[1:28:18] that these things are not happening
[1:28:20] don't tell me
[1:28:21] hallelujah that the rapture is not
[1:28:23] knocking on the hearts of sons and
[1:28:25] daughters of god
[1:28:27] don't tell me i've seen it i've seen it
[1:28:30] what's happening is we've created an
[1:28:32] atmosphere
[1:28:33] where we justify why we feel like we
[1:28:35] feel
[1:28:36] and that it's not important or i will
[1:28:38] deal with it tomorrow
[1:28:39] no he is knocking respond
[1:28:43] respond hallelujah
[1:28:47] oh you can't have revelation
[1:28:50] without it being faith faith is a
[1:28:53] revelation because it's something that's
[1:28:54] revealed to you
[1:28:56] faith is a revelation
[1:28:59] faith is something that's been revealed
[1:29:01] to you like it was
[1:29:02] abraham now i want to ask you saints
[1:29:04] anybody got any faith
[1:29:06] then you have experienced revelation
[1:29:10] god is on the scene revealing himself
[1:29:13] because there's no such thing as a man's
[1:29:15] faith
[1:29:17] it's only god's faith and faith is a
[1:29:19] gift from god to you and i
[1:29:22] hallelujah faith is something that's
[1:29:24] been revealed to you like it was to
[1:29:25] abraham
[1:29:26] that could call anything contrary to
[1:29:29] what have been revealed to him
[1:29:30] as though it wasn't so you know what the
[1:29:33] world calls that
[1:29:36] cognitive dissonance you're denying the
[1:29:39] reality
[1:29:40] you have a disease you have marriage
[1:29:43] problems
[1:29:44] you have this over here and you have
[1:29:46] that over there you have cognitive
[1:29:48] dissonance
[1:29:49] because you're denying that yes i do
[1:29:53] praise the lord i will call those things
[1:29:57] that are
[1:29:58] as though they are not and i will call
[1:30:01] those things that are not
[1:30:02] as though they are my children are saved
[1:30:06] i am healed in the name of jesus christ
[1:30:09] i've got overcoming power the holy ghost
[1:30:12] but you say brother paul it don't seem
[1:30:14] to fit no
[1:30:16] that's right it don't seem to fit in the
[1:30:18] flesh
[1:30:19] but i stepped out of the flesh i stepped
[1:30:21] over into another realm
[1:30:23] and that realm is called faith amen
[1:30:25] hallelujah
[1:30:28] forgive me for getting excited this
[1:30:30] morning
[1:30:32] call anything contrary did you hear me
[1:30:37] anything don't go down a list
[1:30:40] exempting certain things that you feel
[1:30:43] like just can't be done
[1:30:45] well i've had this certain little thing
[1:30:47] brother paul for so long
[1:30:49] good today's as good a day as any just
[1:30:51] like that little brother in south africa
[1:30:53] he had had a mental make breakdown for
[1:30:55] like four years
[1:31:00] four years you know what four years can
[1:31:03] feel like sometimes
[1:31:04] a whole lifetime
[1:31:09] what happened god come
[1:31:12] not and the season was right
[1:31:17] and he responded right and god gave him
[1:31:20] his
[1:31:21] mind back gave him his emotions back
[1:31:24] gave him that determination where he
[1:31:26] literally admitted i guess later
[1:31:28] that the reason he went to church he
[1:31:30] wasn't sure he was even a believer in
[1:31:31] where he went to church because his wife
[1:31:32] basically got him out of bed every
[1:31:34] sunday morning and said you're going to
[1:31:35] church
[1:31:36] sounds like some of us they'll expect me
[1:31:40] there
[1:31:41] well you've heard this story about the
[1:31:42] man that was laying in bed
[1:31:44] sunday morning he's got the covers
[1:31:45] pulled up over his head and his wife's
[1:31:47] coming in there honey it's getting later
[1:31:48] and later and later
[1:31:49] i ain't going to church come on honey go
[1:31:51] to church i ain't going to church
[1:31:52] finally he says well just give me a good
[1:31:54] reason why i should go to church and she
[1:31:56] said
[1:31:56] because you're the pastor
[1:32:07] now faith that's what faith is
[1:32:10] is the revelation of god
[1:32:15] let's not attribute it to anything else
[1:32:17] i know this sounds anti-message
[1:32:19] but people sometimes i think get
[1:32:21] confused what the message is
[1:32:22] my brother and sister this is not
[1:32:26] a revelation of the message
[1:32:30] are you with me this
[1:32:34] is a revelation of jesus christ
[1:32:38] we have put the title the message to it
[1:32:42] [Music]
[1:32:45] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:32:47] word was
[1:32:48] with god and the word was god
[1:32:53] we've put the title message but some
[1:32:55] people say if you don't say this the
[1:32:56] revelation of the message
[1:32:57] you're wrong well that's good if the
[1:32:59] message is the bible
[1:33:01] i'm all for it but if the message is a
[1:33:04] title we have given it
[1:33:06] are you with me and you just go study it
[1:33:09] saints
[1:33:09] i i would press upon you go study what
[1:33:11] it is
[1:33:12] the whole foundation of what it was that
[1:33:15] created traditions in the church
[1:33:20] i'm preaching all your happiness away
[1:33:22] here
[1:33:23] now faith that's what faith is it's a
[1:33:25] revelation of god the church is built
[1:33:27] upon a revelation
[1:33:28] the whole entire body amen
[1:33:32] now can i have just a few more minutes
[1:33:36] so we look here let me find myself
[1:33:40] in my notes here in proverbs 23
[1:33:44] 7. now what i preached on this last
[1:33:48] wednesday my brother and sister i
[1:33:49] stopped just right above this
[1:33:51] so i want you to see how this drives in
[1:33:52] and i thank the lord for that
[1:33:54] because you see what is our our
[1:33:57] expectation what is our
[1:33:59] our deal we see the signs saints look we
[1:34:01] see the signs do we not see the signs
[1:34:04] we see the signs the hour has come the
[1:34:06] prophet of god
[1:34:07] even himself i believe i have it in the
[1:34:09] quote here if we can get to that
[1:34:10] then we see the signs it's here the hour
[1:34:12] is come the bride amen with this
[1:34:15] revelation
[1:34:17] come on not another revelation with this
[1:34:19] revelation
[1:34:20] will produce the results come on this
[1:34:24] isn't like we hope we can make it
[1:34:26] if you are if you're vocalizing i hope i
[1:34:29] can make it to the end i hope i can
[1:34:30] finish the race i hope i can go in the
[1:34:32] rapture i hope that
[1:34:33] something's wrong don't let the devil
[1:34:35] twist you up don't think that you've got
[1:34:37] to do
[1:34:37] i want you to just shift your thinking a
[1:34:39] little bit my brother and sister
[1:34:41] we have the word of the hour amen we've
[1:34:43] got the holy ghost
[1:34:44] and the holy ghost in the word of the
[1:34:46] hour is to produce
[1:34:47] a certain result and we are producing it
[1:34:50] can i say that a little louder
[1:34:52] we are producing it you say brother paul
[1:34:56] we have troubles
[1:34:57] amen there's still a thing called the
[1:34:59] devil
[1:35:01] but it's whether you are going to
[1:35:02] produce the result or not
[1:35:04] well i feel like i'm almost backslid
[1:35:06] that's good the devil would make you
[1:35:07] confirm your backslid
[1:35:09] if you listen to him but you keep
[1:35:11] standing on the word
[1:35:12] and still receive from god and you will
[1:35:15] fight the greatest battle ever fought
[1:35:17] and you will come out shouting the
[1:35:19] victory it won't be just i feel like i
[1:35:22] might make it to
[1:35:23] in the rapture i might make it to heaven
[1:35:25] my brother and sister
[1:35:27] the word of god showed us right here
[1:35:29] that the bride
[1:35:30] with this revelation will produce the
[1:35:33] result
[1:35:34] because the word of god said the hour
[1:35:36] was coming again when the word
[1:35:38] would be in flesh again
[1:35:42] hallelujah so look it's oh how
[1:35:46] oh my well look at this
[1:35:49] i gotta i gotta just ask it to you this
[1:35:51] way
[1:35:52] what is your anticipated result
[1:35:59] well i i personally don't know anybody
[1:36:02] that's ever had an experience with god
[1:36:03] that says well i
[1:36:04] i'm just imagining brother paul that
[1:36:06] i'll i'll probably go about 40 years in
[1:36:08] the message
[1:36:09] and then i'll get discouraged and then
[1:36:14] i was raised lutheran imagine probably
[1:36:18] after about 40 years in the message i'll
[1:36:20] just become a lutheran again
[1:36:22] well if that's your anticipated results
[1:36:24] what's keeping you go become a lutheran
[1:36:26] right now
[1:36:29] well i'll probably just backslid and go
[1:36:31] off in depression and be on some kind of
[1:36:33] medication the rest of my life because
[1:36:35] it just didn't work out like a plan
[1:36:37] no no that's your expectation or
[1:36:40] anticipation right now something
[1:36:41] seriously is wrong
[1:36:43] amen there's there's there's a clarkson
[1:36:45] going off there's lights flashing
[1:36:47] there's something wrong saints
[1:36:51] what is i want you to stop think about
[1:36:53] what's your anticipated result
[1:36:56] come on i knew a man that made this
[1:36:58] declaration and he hid it so right on
[1:37:00] the head almost to the day
[1:37:02] he said well you know i'm going to marry
[1:37:03] this girl but i imagine we'll probably
[1:37:05] only be married about half a dozen years
[1:37:06] get divorced
[1:37:07] we'll have a couple kids by then and
[1:37:09] we'll just fight and fuss over that
[1:37:10] spend thousands of dollars on a lawyer
[1:37:12] half a dozen years goes by young man
[1:37:14] gets divorced
[1:37:15] they fight over the kids they spend tens
[1:37:18] of thousands of dollars and i thought
[1:37:20] hmm yeah i wonder if you ever put that
[1:37:21] together i tried to hint at him you know
[1:37:23] did you realize you kind of prophesied
[1:37:24] that what's prophecy i don't know what
[1:37:26] you're talking about
[1:37:27] well i'll tell you what it is it is your
[1:37:30] anticipated
[1:37:32] result low expectation
[1:37:38] low result high expectation
[1:37:41] yes high results and when i'm standing
[1:37:46] before the throne i'm going to be really
[1:37:49] thrilled to look out
[1:37:50] and see every one of you there i'm going
[1:37:53] to shout
[1:37:54] to the heavens the grace of almighty god
[1:37:58] that when i get to heaven i'll see you
[1:38:01] there
[1:38:05] when we all try to get to heaven
[1:38:09] oh what a glorious day that could
[1:38:12] possibly be
[1:38:15] when we all hopefully see jesus
[1:38:19] we'll maybe sing and shout
[1:38:22] the victory there's a reason that isn't
[1:38:26] the real words of that saints
[1:38:29] there's a reason the songwriter was not
[1:38:31] anointed to put maybes and ifs and butts
[1:38:34] hallelujah amen i want to ask you
[1:38:38] this sounds a little psychology wise
[1:38:42] what is the result of your absolute
[1:38:46] reality your an absolute reality is
[1:38:52] the one that has no additional
[1:38:56] additions no additional
[1:38:59] subtractions it is the finished
[1:39:04] reality you know what that means
[1:39:08] that means when you catch the revelation
[1:39:10] of who you are the prophet of god said
[1:39:12] when the bride the church you recognize
[1:39:16] who you are
[1:39:19] you will be an invincible
[1:39:22] army what is that that's your absolute
[1:39:25] reality
[1:39:26] i'm going to be invincible hallelujah
[1:39:28] right after i just get
[1:39:30] you know over this tizzy and that tizzy
[1:39:32] and i get over
[1:39:33] no no look saints look saints i know
[1:39:35] this is a little hard for some people to
[1:39:38] grasp
[1:39:40] it's time for us to deal in the realm of
[1:39:42] the absolute yes
[1:39:44] right go listen to this message brother
[1:39:46] brown preach the absolute
[1:39:48] amen there's no i got this and but i got
[1:39:50] this also
[1:39:52] it's absolute now the word's producing a
[1:39:55] rapture right
[1:39:57] it's not not what the scripture says the
[1:39:58] words producing a rapture a body change
[1:40:02] i hope this don't sound like you think i
[1:40:04] fell off the ledge
[1:40:06] did you know that you your body
[1:40:10] is the vessel of the rapture
[1:40:17] if god had chose to bring the rapture in
[1:40:19] any other form
[1:40:20] god didn't need you god didn't need me
[1:40:24] i just listened to the prophet yesterday
[1:40:26] said god don't need us
[1:40:29] we need him you realize god chose
[1:40:33] this vessel to be the body the body the
[1:40:36] vessel
[1:40:37] of the rapture why didn't he why didn't
[1:40:40] he take the trees they're innocent
[1:40:44] why didn't he take something else god
[1:40:46] said no i choose you
[1:40:48] i choose you you are the body of the
[1:40:51] manifestation
[1:40:52] of the change that the word of god
[1:40:54] promised would come to pass did that
[1:40:56] make sense to you
[1:40:57] i don't want anybody walking away saying
[1:40:59] brother paul's got some new weird
[1:41:00] doctrine
[1:41:01] well i'll tell you what it's the
[1:41:02] absolute the truth amen
[1:41:04] amen what is a vessel it's a container
[1:41:08] we contain the rapture in us
[1:41:13] you didn't feel like that yesterday
[1:41:15] afternoon did you
[1:41:17] you didn't feel like you were the
[1:41:19] rapture
[1:41:21] well good i don't care how many days you
[1:41:23] don't feel like you're the rapture
[1:41:24] you catch a revelation that you are the
[1:41:27] rapture and you'll quit looking at this
[1:41:29] vessel of flesh
[1:41:31] and you will start looking at the vessel
[1:41:33] of the spiritual man
[1:41:34] you will start recognizing god said it
[1:41:37] god will fulfill it and i believe that
[1:41:39] and i will act upon that
[1:41:42] because well praise the lord
[1:41:45] i'll keep my mouth zipped here
[1:41:48] yeah god could use anything he wanted
[1:41:51] but he chose you isn't that amazing
[1:41:53] so the word jesus christ himself using
[1:41:56] your body to house the rapture
[1:41:59] is that not incredible
[1:42:04] do you know that this has been years ago
[1:42:06] kind of an old story maybe you can find
[1:42:08] the research of it
[1:42:09] but did you know the united states
[1:42:10] government somewhere back east there
[1:42:13] stored literally hundreds of millions of
[1:42:15] dollars of gold
[1:42:17] in a just plain old ramshackle warehouse
[1:42:22] no big thick steel bars no big thick
[1:42:25] concrete
[1:42:26] ceilings and walls no foundation that
[1:42:29] went 20 or 30 feet of solid concrete to
[1:42:31] keep them out
[1:42:33] they literally just packaged it up like
[1:42:36] it was
[1:42:36] nothing used forklifts to unload trucks
[1:42:40] and took it into a warehouse set it down
[1:42:44] but you see the reason nobody stole it
[1:42:47] is because nobody knew
[1:42:49] it was there they weren't looking
[1:42:52] for gold in a warehouse
[1:42:56] and this world is not looking for the
[1:42:59] holy ghost
[1:43:00] in you just
[1:43:03] this old warehouse that god said
[1:43:06] i'm going to fill myself up i'm going to
[1:43:08] store myself in you
[1:43:11] and i'm not going to make you oh can you
[1:43:14] imagine brother tim wouldn't we look
[1:43:15] good in them big robes
[1:43:18] and of course you know in the old you
[1:43:20] know arabian method of
[1:43:22] family whatever our wives and our
[1:43:25] daughters would be trailing behind kind
[1:43:27] of like a
[1:43:28] bride in a wedding and we would be
[1:43:30] walking along with our big robes
[1:43:33] i am the word of god made flesh
[1:43:44] no sir he hid it in you
[1:43:49] the very place the world
[1:43:53] wouldn't look amen
[1:43:59] hallelujah thank you lord
[1:44:04] some of you better start voicing that
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:08] you better say thank you because the
[1:44:09] lord might think you're not appreciating
[1:44:11] that
[1:44:12] look okay we know the word says the body
[1:44:14] change has already taken place right
[1:44:16] one we know it's a catching away from
[1:44:18] this world now here
[1:44:21] is a i think interesting thought
[1:44:24] the scripture clearly shows us what
[1:44:26] sends us to hell right
[1:44:28] can you pick your bible up and figure
[1:44:29] out what sends you to hell it's
[1:44:31] very clear amen yet the flesh still
[1:44:34] finds these things
[1:44:36] attractive come on don't lie down don't
[1:44:38] lie don't lie to me please please don't
[1:44:40] lie to me this morning
[1:44:42] the flesh still finds these things
[1:44:44] attractive
[1:44:46] come on it's maybe time we face a little
[1:44:48] rubber on the road
[1:44:49] brothers it's still a challenge isn't it
[1:44:51] there's a pretty woman
[1:44:53] the prophet of god said i hang that
[1:44:54] cross everybody's got this idea oh
[1:44:57] we're just no no no the prophet of god
[1:44:59] do you realize get the depth of the
[1:45:00] story the prophet of god spoke
[1:45:02] right there on tape to the world and
[1:45:03] says the reason i have this cro
[1:45:05] this cross on my mirror is when i look
[1:45:07] over here and i see this girl
[1:45:09] of this purdy this perfect stature i can
[1:45:11] turn my eyes and look to the cross
[1:45:14] what was he doing he was telling us i'm
[1:45:16] not exempt
[1:45:18] a prophet of god not exempt no we've had
[1:45:20] angry prophets through the scriptures
[1:45:22] we've had all kinds of prophets
[1:45:23] discourage prophets prophets that
[1:45:25] clinically psychologists now
[1:45:27] religious ones are looking at going we
[1:45:29] believe a lot
[1:45:30] must might have suffered from depression
[1:45:33] you think so huh well i know one thing
[1:45:37] he suffered from the presence of god in
[1:45:39] his life if you want to call that
[1:45:40] suffering
[1:45:41] and the old flesh just can't do that
[1:45:43] people are like oh go on youtube see how
[1:45:45] many people
[1:45:45] i i was in my room last night and god
[1:45:48] come down and stood in my midst
[1:45:49] and he gave me these ten points that i'm
[1:45:51] to share with the world
[1:45:53] and so i'm here to tell you this this
[1:45:54] this and this and this
[1:45:56] well let's just start with it and take
[1:45:58] it back to the scripture okay
[1:46:00] no no no no no no
[1:46:03] though an angel of light should come
[1:46:07] well if his angel light had to be god
[1:46:09] right
[1:46:10] no no no okay
[1:46:14] for as he thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:46:17] i want to get back and move on here
[1:46:20] what is your expectation saints please
[1:46:22] look at me focus
[1:46:24] what do you think about yourself today
[1:46:28] so as you think of yourself in your
[1:46:30] heart if you see yourself
[1:46:31] as bitter and defeated and unable
[1:46:34] and and just on down that negative line
[1:46:37] that's what you are
[1:46:39] this is not psychology saints this is
[1:46:42] scripture
[1:46:45] i will see you in the rapture
[1:46:49] see you in the rapture
[1:46:53] oh i can't sing this tractor version too
[1:46:55] you guys will go man he butchered that
[1:46:57] but i'm telling you that's where i see
[1:46:59] myself
[1:47:00] that's who i am i'm in the rapture
[1:47:03] i am the rapture i am the word in a
[1:47:08] vessel
[1:47:08] called into the presence of almighty god
[1:47:12] hallelujah oh let me just
[1:47:15] let's go on see we also see the word
[1:47:18] shows us clearly what will save our
[1:47:20] souls right
[1:47:22] and the flesh finds that hard to do
[1:47:25] would someone agree with me
[1:47:27] the things that send us to hell seem to
[1:47:29] come so naturally
[1:47:31] things that would save our souls is a
[1:47:33] bitter fight
[1:47:45] come on get that picture
[1:47:51] but how do you see yourself
[1:47:55] i made mistakes yesterday
[1:48:00] right scripture lays out all these
[1:48:03] things
[1:48:04] there as it were a transgression of the
[1:48:06] word of god
[1:48:07] and i can stand before you today and say
[1:48:11] pride of life a little token of
[1:48:14] bitterness here
[1:48:16] a little anger oh no we don't talk like
[1:48:19] that you're a preacher in the message
[1:48:20] you can't talk like that yes i can
[1:48:24] i can tell you that i get to face those
[1:48:25] things and i get a struggle with those
[1:48:27] things
[1:48:28] but i get to come at the end of my day
[1:48:30] and stop and look
[1:48:32] in the word of god and say thank you
[1:48:34] lord for the blood
[1:48:36] thank you lord for the revelation of who
[1:48:38] i am in jesus christ
[1:48:40] thank you lord and i can rise up from
[1:48:43] that with the confidence
[1:48:44] that i shall not be defeated i shall not
[1:48:48] give in to the enemy i shall not do
[1:48:50] why because the rapture has now been
[1:48:54] expressed in me and i no longer see
[1:48:57] myself in the flesh
[1:48:58] but i see myself in the spirit the word
[1:49:01] says that you have to get into even know
[1:49:03] he's the christ
[1:49:04] you have to be filled with the holy
[1:49:06] ghost
[1:49:09] prophet of god said i'm keeping you a
[1:49:11] little long aren't i
[1:49:13] it's not mother's day it's not father's
[1:49:14] day it's just memorial day and so we're
[1:49:16] just going to remember why we're here
[1:49:19] amen
[1:49:24] now i'll leave some of those thoughts
[1:49:25] out praise the lord now
[1:49:28] john 1 and 12 said but as many as
[1:49:31] receive him
[1:49:32] to them gave him power to become sons of
[1:49:35] god even to them that believe on his
[1:49:37] name
[1:49:37] which were born not of blood nor the
[1:49:39] will of the flesh nor the will of man
[1:49:42] but of god are you familiar with the
[1:49:46] lafontaine song you're looking more like
[1:49:48] your father
[1:49:49] every day hallelujah i am it's just
[1:49:52] amazing
[1:49:53] i don't want to sound egotistical i
[1:49:55] don't want to sound lifted up in your
[1:49:56] sight
[1:49:57] but i get up in the morning and i go
[1:49:58] look in the mirror and i'm thinking yeah
[1:50:00] i'm looking more like my father every
[1:50:02] day
[1:50:04] no i'm not talking about my earthly
[1:50:05] father i'm not ashamed of him
[1:50:08] but i'm looking more like my heavenly
[1:50:11] father of who i really am
[1:50:13] hallelujah every day i'm looking because
[1:50:16] you see when you catch the revelations
[1:50:17] brother paul you're making revelation
[1:50:19] out of a lovely stuff i
[1:50:20] am because we struggle with it and it
[1:50:22] has to be a revelation for you to
[1:50:24] live and use that victoriously amen so
[1:50:26] as many as received him he gave them the
[1:50:28] power to become sons and daughters of
[1:50:30] god
[1:50:30] now look my brother and sister you can't
[1:50:32] be a son of god and a son of perdition
[1:50:35] at the same time
[1:50:36] it's impossibility we don't have two
[1:50:39] fathers we don't have a two soul
[1:50:41] doctrine around here
[1:50:42] i'm of my father amen
[1:50:45] the lord jesus christ that's what i'm of
[1:50:49] which were born see not back to the
[1:50:51] flesh

[1:50:59] two child
[1:51:00] three child four child a van i mean

[1:51:14] flesh
[1:51:14] not the will of man our children that
[1:51:16] are here
[1:51:19] because god desired them to be amen
[1:51:24] that's simple
[1:51:29] body change is knocking one more shot
[1:51:31] here
[1:51:32] are we okay go through this one last
[1:51:33] quote in the days of the pentecostals
[1:51:36] restoring back of the gifts the
[1:51:37] restoration of the guests speaking
[1:51:39] tongues casting out devils
[1:51:40] and the gifts why it testified there was
[1:51:43] no joke about it people said
[1:51:44] when it first raised up i read the books
[1:51:46] in the history of pentecost they said it
[1:51:47] can't last it'll burn down
[1:51:49] it's still burning why is this because
[1:51:52] you'll never put it out
[1:51:53] god said it would be there it's that
[1:51:55] portion of the word and no more could
[1:51:57] you put that out
[1:51:58] then when the bride is being called out
[1:52:01] how you going to put it out
[1:52:03] you see this word my brother and sister
[1:52:04] that's calling you and i
[1:52:06] nothing's going to stop that i don't
[1:52:09] care how many people i'm just going to
[1:52:10] be blunt with you i don't care how many
[1:52:12] people
[1:52:13] quit i don't care how close they were to
[1:52:17] you
[1:52:17] that quit you cannot put the fire out
[1:52:21] to this bride of christ amen
[1:52:24] the rapture is a revelation to her it's
[1:52:27] not i read it in a book i read it in
[1:52:28] scripture
[1:52:29] but it's becoming something that is
[1:52:31] playing out of your life
[1:52:33] and just like enoch you get up in the
[1:52:35] morning and you say lord
[1:52:36] i'm gonna do my very best to please you
[1:52:38] and you realize god looks at this
[1:52:40] now look my brother and sister when when
[1:52:43] we look
[1:52:44] oh my i'll just be taking more time
[1:52:53] i have i just have to i'm sorry i had
[1:52:58] the privilege sister jerry and i to sit
[1:52:59] in brother willie
[1:53:00] and sister betty retief's home eat
[1:53:03] home-cooked food they apologize sorry
[1:53:05] this isn't very good i didn't care
[1:53:09] sitting here with a man that has such an
[1:53:12] incredible testimony
[1:53:13] a sister with such an incredible
[1:53:15] testimony of the labors that they've
[1:53:17] done
[1:53:18] of what they they gave through those
[1:53:20] years through the 50s
[1:53:21] 60s and coming right on up now they both
[1:53:24] passed to their reward
[1:53:26] and you look at that and and we got to
[1:53:27] sit there in their house and
[1:53:29] and i i don't know how to tell you i'm
[1:53:31] not a respecter of persons but i i do
[1:53:33] have a respect for these men that can
[1:53:35] just share with you yes brother paul
[1:53:36] i used to take everything but uh
[1:53:39] virtually the equivalent of ten dollars
[1:53:41] every drop of money we had but ten
[1:53:43] dollars i left that for sister betty
[1:53:46] and i would get books and i would get
[1:53:47] bibles and i would get this and
[1:53:49] i would go and i would go up through
[1:53:51] these countries and up through these
[1:53:52] places and i would sleep in my car
[1:53:54] and he had a sense of humor too he says
[1:53:56] you know i would sleep in my car because
[1:53:58] you see they'd say oh
[1:53:59] here this bed is for you and you'd look
[1:54:01] in there and there'd be four dogs and a
[1:54:03] baby camel and this and that and
[1:54:04] whatever sleeping in the bed they'd be
[1:54:06] like no the back seat the car don't look
[1:54:07] bad at all
[1:54:12] and sister betty sharing her testimony
[1:54:14] i'm glad i got to hear this in person
[1:54:16] and she's there and she says you know
[1:54:18] brother paul it was this time it was
[1:54:20] this place and brother branham was
[1:54:21] coming and we were going to have this
[1:54:22] interview with him
[1:54:23] and i went down to the to the hair salon
[1:54:26] deal and
[1:54:26] got my hair trimmed and permed and all
[1:54:29] this stuff and i got a dress and
[1:54:30] i wanted to just be as presentable as i
[1:54:33] could and we were going to be with
[1:54:34] brother branham right after this
[1:54:36] meeting and the service and and and so
[1:54:39] i'm there and as he's preaching
[1:54:41] i just was sinking and sinking she said
[1:54:43] in my heart
[1:54:45] because you realize i just went before
[1:54:48] the prophet of god
[1:54:49] come and we're going to meet him and the
[1:54:51] very thing i shouldn't have known i went
[1:54:52] and
[1:54:53] had my hair all done up and trimmed and
[1:54:57] and that's against the word of god and
[1:54:59] she's heart broke
[1:55:01] and they're there with brother branham
[1:55:04] she shares that with him
[1:55:06] i want this to encourage you and she
[1:55:09] tells brother branham i i did this
[1:55:11] brother brown
[1:55:11] i'm so sorry and he said it's all right
[1:55:15] sister betty
[1:55:16] in the service when those words and he
[1:55:19] repeated
[1:55:20] the words when they were spoken
[1:55:23] in your heart you said oh lord forgive
[1:55:25] me
[1:55:26] and in god's eyes right now sister betty
[1:55:29] you have long
[1:55:30] beautiful hair not a ritual
[1:55:35] no i go to this and i go to that but he
[1:55:37] said in your heart
[1:55:39] when you said and he tells her what she
[1:55:42] said
[1:55:43] in her heart she never
[1:55:46] doubted she said i was a little
[1:55:48] embarrassed when i was around other
[1:55:49] people that believed the message of the
[1:55:51] hour that my hair was there
[1:55:52] but it just kept growing and it kept
[1:55:54] growing and it kept growing and
[1:55:56] and but she just knew she said i have
[1:55:57] confidence
[1:55:59] a prophet of god told me god saw
[1:56:03] my heart isn't that beautiful thank you
[1:56:06] lord sister emmy would you come
[1:56:09] amen how are they going to put that out
[1:56:11] when the bride is being called out how
[1:56:13] are you going to put it out
[1:56:14] it's the revelation of the manifestation
[1:56:17] of the word
[1:56:18] made true and we're living in that day
[1:56:20] praise be to god the revelation of the
[1:56:23] mystery
[1:56:23] of himself and it's more real today
[1:56:27] saints than it was when the prophet of
[1:56:28] god preached this in 1965
[1:56:31] it's more real today of the revelation
[1:56:34] oh hallelujah a revelation of the
[1:56:38] mystery of himself now the rapture is
[1:56:40] only this rapture
[1:56:40] we're talking about is only for the
[1:56:42] bride
[1:56:44] you talk about having a revelation when
[1:56:46] you by revelation can stand and say you
[1:56:48] know what
[1:56:49] i'm in the rapture what you're actually
[1:56:51] making a revelation i know who i am as
[1:56:53] the bride of jesus christ
[1:56:55] i'm not a hope so i'm not a maybe soul i
[1:56:58] might be
[1:56:59] i am i am
[1:57:02] remember the bible said in the rest of
[1:57:04] the dead live not for a thousand years
[1:57:07] this great rapture now listen to this
[1:57:10] carefully we're closing
[1:57:12] if there's not a rapture friends where
[1:57:15] are we at
[1:57:17] what are we going to do what age are we
[1:57:19] living in what promise do we have
[1:57:21] there oh could i just put that in bold
[1:57:24] letters
[1:57:25] there is going to be a rapture
[1:57:28] the bible says there will be and it'll
[1:57:30] only be for the elected the elected lady
[1:57:33] the bride in this day that's pulled out
[1:57:35] the church
[1:57:36] the very word church means called out of
[1:57:39] and moses called the nation out of a
[1:57:41] nation
[1:57:41] the holy spirit is calling a bride out
[1:57:43] of a church
[1:57:44] a church out of a church members from
[1:57:47] every denomination
[1:57:48] making up a bride bride tree it's in the
[1:57:50] tape the bride tree bride coming out
[1:57:52] call
[1:57:54] that's the one thing the bride tree is
[1:57:56] the bride rather
[1:57:57] is the one that's going to be in the
[1:57:59] rapture that alone
[1:58:01] nothing but the bride the elected ones
[1:58:04] foreknown by god from the beginning
[1:58:07] the father's spiritual genes
[1:58:11] oh hallelujah hallelujah when the word
[1:58:14] says that you were
[1:58:15] always in him that's because it was his
[1:58:19] spiritual genes that brought you to this
[1:58:23] all saints look
[1:58:26] look at this rapture
[1:58:30] i've seen people get up excited and
[1:58:33] upset
[1:58:34] because it would be spoken such terms
[1:58:37] but i'm just going to make one closing
[1:58:39] parting shot with the canon
[1:58:44] if you don't believe you're the rapture
[1:58:50] then the prophet of god has just showed
[1:58:53] you
[1:58:54] you're not the bride
[1:58:59] because if you're the bride you are the
[1:59:02] rapture
[1:59:03] so therefore they can't be a rapture
[1:59:06] without
[1:59:07] you the bride so if you claim to be
[1:59:10] bride
[1:59:12] but don't believe you are the rapture
[1:59:15] we've got a misunderstanding somewhere
[1:59:18] and that might well go back to
[1:59:20] the teaching let's just say what the
[1:59:23] prophet said
[1:59:25] can we do that saints can we just stand
[1:59:27] on what the prophet said
[1:59:30] hallelujah i was known by god from the
[1:59:33] beginning
[1:59:35] because i'm his child i'm his word
[1:59:39] manifested i like what was spoken here
[1:59:42] recently
[1:59:43] the seventh seal is not a doctrine
[1:59:47] it is the word and the word is the bride
[1:59:51] and the bride is the word
[1:59:52] so therefore the mystery of redemption
[1:59:54] which was hidden
[1:59:56] throughout all the books revealed in the
[1:59:57] seventh seal
[1:59:59] i am redemption also you see redemptions
[2:00:03] all through me
[2:00:05] it's redeemed every molecule of me
[2:00:08] imagine a person would stand in front of
[2:00:10] you and say well
[2:00:12] praise the lord i i'm redeemed i'm
[2:00:15] saved i've got the holy ghost except for
[2:00:16] my hands
[2:00:20] or my feet or my eyes or my ears or my
[2:00:23] mind
[2:00:24] or my heart no sir
[2:00:27] if we're redeemed we're redeemed just
[2:00:30] the same as if we're lost we're lost
[2:00:33] but i'm telling you this word has come
[2:00:34] i've got the holy ghost you've got the
[2:00:36] holy ghost
[2:00:37] confess it stand on it amen i wish
[2:00:40] somebody would just
[2:00:42] maybe electronically be able to shut off
[2:00:45] hallelujah we'll just call that good
[2:00:48] amen
[2:00:49] no ye not amen brother jason
[2:00:52] hallelujah always marveled by it is very
[2:00:55] few preachers can sing
[2:01:00] hallelujah no ye not no ye not
[2:01:03] ye are a temple
[2:01:04] [Music]
[2:01:12] [Music]

[2:02:43] i am a temple
[2:02:49] hallelujah well you know i don't really
[2:02:52] shouldn't spill the beans here but
[2:02:54] if you guys just want to maybe do a
[2:02:57] little study in your own self listening
[2:02:58] the prophet
[2:03:00] reading some words we're going to just
[2:03:02] move on into just a little study
[2:03:05] amen of where the mercy seats at
[2:03:09] not too long ago i encountered an
[2:03:10] individual he says so
[2:03:12] paul you believe if god these are words
[2:03:15] saints
[2:03:16] you believe god's right here in your
[2:03:18] church
[2:03:20] in your midst
[2:03:23] i said yes i do he said you mean
[2:03:26] figurative like the holy ghost i said
[2:03:27] well the prophet of god says
[2:03:29] it's all god come on
[2:03:33] look it up it's quotes it's not some
[2:03:36] portion of you got the holy ghost you've
[2:03:40] got god
[2:03:41] and he said i can't believe that because
[2:03:43] if god's here with you in that form
[2:03:45] he's off the mercy seat
[2:03:49] caught me so off guard i thought what
[2:03:53] what no no i'm sorry prophet of god
[2:03:57] didn't word this in various forms a few
[2:03:59] hundred times
[2:04:00] to come along and say oh sorry i got the
[2:04:02] got off the mercy seat
[2:04:04] so if you get an opportunity just study
[2:04:06] it now the mercy seat
[2:04:08] we'll preach and i want to just make
[2:04:09] sure the church here that we have
[2:04:10] clarity
[2:04:12] on the mercy seat amen i could just
[2:04:15] put it in one paragraph to be done but
[2:04:17] that would be no fun
[2:04:19] hallelujah we'll look through the word
[2:04:21] of god we'll study this out and realize
[2:04:24] my brother and sister how awesome our
