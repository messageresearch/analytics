[27:07] Saints when the presence of the Lord
[27:09] comes and moves right at the beginning
[27:12] of the service I'll just tell you it
[27:14] makes it so easy to preach I mean you
[27:17] can just pour your heart out because
[27:20] there's just I don't know there's just
[27:21] something already there
[27:23] so you know as you know sometimes I my
[27:27] calm my nerves I just reach up in the
[27:29] bookcase and I pull a book out and I
[27:31] just turned randomly to it you find that
[27:35] I'm a terribly random person yeah anyway
[27:38] I just want to share this I don't think
[27:41] that we need to put it up on the screen
[27:43] but in the message then Jesus came and
[27:46] called page 7 it be paragraph 46 if you
[27:50] want to read in front of it I encourage
[27:52] you to and behind it amen because you
[27:55] might say I'm cherry-picking a quote out
[27:58] of this but it was something that I
[27:59] picked the book up opened it and came
[28:01] right there a man I got to pick the
[28:04] fruit right off the tree that's right
[28:06] brother David amen so just beautiful
[28:08] because I just looked down on the page
[28:10] and here this was paragraph 46 he said
[28:14] maybe somebody said the church has been
[28:17] kind of dry for a while we haven't had a
[28:20] good fresh water for a few months we
[28:24] haven't had a revival looks like
[28:27] everybody is so stagnant or something
[28:29] another we just go to church and sing a
[28:32] hymn and hear a few messages go back but
[28:36] all of a sudden then we begin to get dry
[28:42] then Jesus comes on the scene freshens
[28:46] us up bring something new to us is
[28:50] always there to do that New Hope's come
[28:54] when Jesus comes in his presence brings
[28:57] new hope hey men aren't you so glad amen
[29:02] that's why we just always want to dwell
[29:03] in the presence of the Lord amen you
[29:06] know we don't this whole world just has
[29:08] a way of being a negative you know it
[29:11] might be as simple as
[29:12] opening up your bank statement and
[29:14] looking how small it is and it'll just
[29:16] have a dampening effect on you and then
[29:18] the devil will let you then go and open
[29:20] up the next bill and it's equal to your
[29:23] bank account amen and you go what am I
[29:27] going to do now Oh what am I going to do
[29:29] now well what we do now is say Lord you
[29:31] said you'd be my provider and I'm just
[29:34] trusting you Lord and it doesn't matter
[29:36] what the cares and the things of this
[29:38] world of this life have I'm trusting you
[29:41] Lord amen hallelujah I'd like to speak
[29:44] to you not tonight once again on
[29:46] preparations of the inner man god bless
[29:48] you thank you our musicians so blessed
[29:51] to have such a talented group amen
[29:54] hallelujah well I guess they don't think
[29:57] you're talented but anyway I'll say Amen
[30:01] for them amen hallelujah
[30:04] I'll forgive me I'm just in a good mood
[30:07] tonight amen
[30:09] just a lovely time to serve the Lord I
[30:12] want to speak to you tonight confidence
[30:14] in the finished work you know it's it's
[30:18] just something my brother and sister
[30:19] that God really wants to anchor in our
[30:23] soul we ever you know sometimes we find
[30:27] ourselves you know making little
[30:29] statements you're like why did I say
[30:31] that and maybe you know you'll be
[30:34] talking to somebody and you tell them
[30:36] something or you're asking them to do
[30:38] something and you will just say trust me
[30:42] it's interesting to see people's
[30:45] reactions when you say trust me some of
[30:50] them you can see that like mmm some not
[30:55] gonna happen some say I got enough
[30:59] confidence I'll trust you you realize we
[31:03] react that same way to God
[31:05] we act out what is actually going on
[31:11] inside of us my brother and sister it's
[31:17] it's the truth I mean we act out what is
[31:20] going on inside of us you know brother
[31:22] Brown said often time the minister
[31:23] preaches on the things that he's going
[31:25] through in his own
[31:26] life now it doesn't mean that the if the
[31:29] preacher is talking about fear and
[31:31] unbelief that he's got fear and unbelief
[31:32] but the devil's been bombarding him with
[31:35] fear and unbelief Amen and so then God
[31:38] anoints him to come and preach and
[31:39] somebody says well that was just for me
[31:41] well you see it was for the body hey man
[31:44] let's just stand and read the word
[31:45] tonight just to speak for a few minutes
[31:49] on confidence in the finished work we'll
[31:52] go to Psalms 118 starting with verse 8
[31:54] and it's just to me this is such a
[31:58] lovely Psalms 118 just a lovely a bit of
[32:02] Scripture I always enjoy reading it and
[32:06] we're going to just pull out these
[32:07] scriptures for our thought tonight
[32:09] Psalms 118 and eight it is now this is
[32:13] not a question this is a statement it is
[32:17] better to trust in the Lord than to put
[32:20] confidence in man it is better to trust
[32:24] in the Lord than to put confidence in
[32:26] Princes all nation compassed me about
[32:29] but in the name of the Lord will I
[32:32] destroy them hey man this is not a son
[32:35] of God saying Lord if they'll just treat
[32:38] me okay a little bit of a truce we'll
[32:40] get along but this is God anointing
[32:43] David as he writes here that as the all
[32:46] nation can pass me about but in the name
[32:48] of the Lord will I destroy them they can
[32:51] pass me about yay they can pass me about
[32:53] but in the name of the Lord I will
[32:55] destroy them

[33:02] in the name of the Lord I will destroy
[33:05] them Amen my brother and sister I don't
[33:07] care what it is that the devil's been
[33:09] bugging you with Amen you just have to
[33:11] stand on the word and in the name of the
[33:13] Lord I will destroy that whatever that
[33:16] spirit is whatever that circumstance is

[33:47] that I might fall but the Lord helped me
[33:51] the Lord is my strength and song and has
[33:55] become my salvation the voice of

[37:04] spirit my brother and sister the prophet
[37:07] of God was not hesitant to call out the
[37:10] spirits amen he didn't say well we'll
[37:13] kind of phrase it in such a way that it
[37:15] doesn't offend anyone here he called out
[37:18] the spirit he laid it out very clearly
[37:21] even to the point as I shared with you a
[37:23] while back calling out speaking these
[37:25] deals while I was speaking to brother
[37:27] so-and-so and he had committed adultery
[37:29] and I told him you're gonna have to
[37:31] repent from that now my brother and
[37:33] sister in the day and age we live in
[37:34] people would just flee from the church
[37:36] because they would say look he might
[37:38] call me out next and I'm just ain't
[37:40] gonna deal with it but the people should
[37:41] be crying out to God Lord
[37:44] all out my shortcoming call out my
[37:46] failures Lord I need this to be exposed
[37:50] goes totally against a human nature amen
[37:54] but we should be able to say thank you
[37:55] Lord that you love us so much that you
[37:58] would keep washing us with the water of
[38:00] the word amen now look I just want to
[38:03] tag this right to verse 11 you might be
[38:06] compassed about in the day that we live
[38:08] in all kinds of spirits but in the name
[38:10] of the Lord I will destroy them now my
[38:13] brother and sister it takes character to
[38:15] wield the sword of the Lord amen you
[38:17] cannot just go and and you know exhibit
[38:20] the nature of I'll just slash and hack
[38:22] and cut and you know if they're the
[38:25] bride they'll believe it that's not the
[38:28] way we present the gospel we present the
[38:30] gospel as a living God but a God that is
[38:33] also a God of judgment amen and so
[38:36] people make the decision themselves
[38:37] whether they want to face a loving God
[38:40] in grace and mercy or they want to face
[38:42] a God of judgment amen we are not there
[38:44] to set the stage for that but yet I'll
[38:47] just throw this out Jen the church and
[38:49] I'm going to extend that write down many
[38:51] of the problems we have on the message
[38:52] is weak pulpits
[38:53] men who will not stand up and speak the
[38:56] truth because they don't want to offend
[38:59] anyone in the church now I'm not talking
[39:01] about the mean guy that just picks on
[39:03] people and beats on people but my
[39:05] brother and sister we need to be lifting
[39:08] up I don't say this for my sake I you
[39:09] can name any amount of brothers you want
[39:11] point north-south-east-west we need to
[39:13] be lifting up the ministry that the time
[39:16] goes on that there isn't a political
[39:18] correctness comes into the message that
[39:21] controls the pulpit it's already enough
[39:23] of that we need men they're going to
[39:25] stand up and they're going to tell the
[39:27] truth and that truth my brother and
[39:28] sister the word says will set us free
[39:30] amen so we want free we need to have a
[39:34] good strong ministry but my brother and
[39:36] sister the prophet of God said that you
[39:38] as a congregation as the people actually
[39:41] operate the gift in the man in the
[39:43] pulpit so we need a good strong church
[39:46] amen we need a people that are willing
[39:49] to sacrifice a little time of their life
[39:51] a little effort to lift up to pray for
[39:54] encourage and support you know I've been
[39:57] really
[39:57] enjoying the little what you call it oh
[40:00] my my mind just fled what's up you know
[40:03] that you know I've been enjoying that
[40:05] because Saints you've been encouraging
[40:07] each other
[40:08] I don't always respond to them you know
[40:10] we'll be working I have grease on my
[40:12] hands I hear the phone ding you know
[40:14] curiosity just kills the cat doesn't it
[40:17] what is that ding but you know sometimes
[40:22] I'll fumble around there and get that
[40:24] and I'll see you guys encouraging each
[40:26] other for birthdays and for prayers and
[40:28] prayer requests and blessings of God I
[40:30] think this is good we need this kind of
[40:32] interaction in a body amen not a bunch
[40:35] of distant strangers coming into a
[40:37] building trying to worship together but
[40:39] sons and daughters of God a body the
[40:41] scripture says that is knit together
[40:44] hallelujah and so you know it's there
[40:47] that we realize the Lord is my strength
[40:49] and my song and is become my salvation
[40:53] now you look and see what God has done
[40:55] in our lives if we would just unwind our
[40:58] lives for a moment you might say the
[41:00] film of our life and realize that the
[41:02] Lord has not left us powerless amen we
[41:05] are not what we were a year ago five
[41:08] years ago 10 years ago the Lord's giving
[41:10] us confidence amen he has become our
[41:14] strength but that's strength my brother
[41:16] and sister is being manifested through
[41:18] you and I amen God didn't say okay
[41:21] usually set there is a weakling and I'll
[41:23] come along but he said I want you to be
[41:26] in the word amen because if you're in
[41:28] the word you can't be deceived amen if
[41:30] you're in the word you're fortified
[41:32] you're in the word you are built up amen
[41:35] and he wants you to be built up amen I
[41:38] was reading a little book and it was
[41:40] talking about this man he was still a
[41:41] soldier in his fleece and he was just
[41:44] they they described him as hard as a
[41:46] rock and stronger than most young men
[41:50] well how he did that as a soldier my
[41:52] brother and sister is he continually
[41:54] fortified himself he continually you
[41:57] might say exercise and it wasn't merely
[41:59] an exercise of the muscles but it's also
[42:01] an exercise you might say of the brain
[42:04] amen and also he had a great heart to
[42:07] serve his country and now as you look at
[42:09] that my brother and sister we
[42:11] sons and daughters of God as time goes
[42:13] on and we have fought battle after
[42:16] battle after battle we should not be
[42:18] getting weaker we should be getting
[42:20] stronger hey man we should not be
[42:23] looking for a shortcut but we should be
[42:25] looking for the way that the Lord sends
[42:27] us if he sends us straight in the face
[42:30] of the enemy to do battle then we should
[42:32] say the Lord has prepared me for this
[42:34] battle and I am Not Afraid amen and so
[42:38] we must remain fortified in the Word of
[42:41] God now being fortified in the Word of
[42:43] God I mentioned because the Prophet
[42:45] mentions it it's not about just being
[42:46] deceived my brother and sister because
[42:48] the word shows us that this work he
[42:50] began in you will not falter it will not
[42:54] fail it will not be incomplete he said I
[42:57] will finish it amen and so you look at
[43:01] that we're not in the word just because
[43:03] we're afraid to be deceived but we're in
[43:05] the word because he need to function
[43:07] amen
[43:08] so as we look at this we press into the
[43:10] word and he certainly becomes our
[43:12] strength and he becomes our song and is
[43:15] become my salvation now I'm not going to
[43:18] interpret this but I'll tell you when
[43:20] you look at that and say become my
[43:22] salvation we recognize that we were
[43:23] saved before the foundation of the world
[43:25] God called us before the foundation but
[43:27] my brother and sister when it becomes a
[43:30] salvation and we recognize who we are in
[43:33] Jesus Christ that is as the song says
[43:36] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[43:38] the righteous do what run into it they
[43:43] don't crawl they don't wait they don't
[43:45] yet they run into it amen and so then
[43:48] the Lord becomes our salvation which is
[43:52] our sanctuary amen so that's our
[43:55] dwelling place that we want to be
[43:57] it's our heart's desire not just on
[43:59] Sunday not just on Wednesday but every
[44:01] day of the week amen hallelujah
[44:04] you know for a man to say I shall not
[44:07] die but live the world eternal nature
[44:09] amen because we have the nature of God
[44:12] in us we have been become of an eternal
[44:15] nature amen so it's there that the word
[44:18] has rejuvenated or brought to life the
[44:21] seed that was planted amen no I like
[44:25] this now
[44:25] to really focus for a minute if you
[44:27] don't mind on verse 18 amen
[44:29] so you look at this and realize my
[44:31] brother and sister how God works and
[44:33] we'll we'll just look now amen so the
[44:37] LORD hath chasing me sore what happened
[44:51] to the believer the true believer he
[44:55] pouted he ran away no sir
[45:02] he chastened me sore because that's I
[45:09] love I chasing if we are never I want to
[45:16] reverse this Amen I want to reverse the
[45:19] polarity tonight if we are never
[45:22] chastened it's the opposite of what
[45:29] Satan tries to get us to face Satan says
[45:32] man they are ripping your hide and they
[45:33] got no right to do that while they're
[45:36] picking on you that was pointed hmm stop
[45:41] reverse the polarity if you're never
[45:44] chastened you are not a son daughter
[45:50] well unless of course we're already
[45:53] perfect shut up Paul
[46:04] they're like you but they ain't you and
[46:11] if you ask them they'll tell you they'll
[46:15] give you a good insight into how perfect
[46:17] they are but my brother and sister I'd
[46:21] rather be chasing so that I quit
[46:24] mumbling and bumbling about you know
[46:26] kind of trying to quote it from memory
[46:28] but the prophet of God was talking about
[46:30] South somebody tried to correct him and
[46:31] he said nope not going there I'm gonna
[46:33] let the Lord correct me
[46:35] amen so in other words this was could be
[46:37] someone's opinion but if God corrected
[46:40] him he knew he needed to change amen if
[46:42] you can understand what I'm saying there
[46:43] so he says here the Lord had chasing me
[46:45] sore but he hath not given me over unto
[46:49] death now my brother and sister God can
[46:53] whoop the hide right off of us Amen and
[46:55] we'll feel like that we are just right
[46:57] down at the dirt level if that's a good
[46:59] acceptable phrase we feel like we were
[47:02] just well low as dirt but you see if God
[47:05] ever let go of you you would be lower
[47:06] than dirt but God said it says here
[47:08] never let go of you amen he kept a hold
[47:12] of you he never gave you over unto death
[47:14] he might have just whipped you and
[47:16] whipped you hard and we as humans don't
[47:18] like that right and now I'll put the
[47:20] other angle of it just in the very
[47:22] nature of humanity we don't like to be
[47:24] whipped but one of the things that
[47:26] bothers us almost as much as if feather
[47:27] people know we're being whipped
[47:30] that's called pride that's called pride
[47:33] when we look out and say you know it's
[47:35] like oh they know they know they know
[47:38] God's whipping me and it hurts so bad I
[47:40] mean I'm not talking about the Lord is
[47:42] it hurts my pride so bad we ought to be
[47:46] doing this rejoicing yes imagine if we
[47:49] could get so filled with the Holy Ghost
[47:51] the Lord would be just whooping on
[47:52] brother Trevor and we'd become an over
[47:54] old brother Trevor praise the Lord God
[47:56] just whippin the hide off of you
[47:59] why because I know I know if I'm a
[48:03] witness to him being whipped I know God
[48:07] loves him it's exactly the opposite of
[48:10] our human thinking
[48:12] amen then you can say I know God loves
[48:15] my brother Trevor and I'm not saying
[48:17] he's been being whipped on so well are
[48:21] you but look my brother and sister you
[48:25] see because he chasing a sword sore here
[48:29] sword
[48:30] did I say sore amen but he hasn't given
[48:34] us up he hasn't given up on us I say
[48:36] thank you Lord I'll accept Lord I'll
[48:39] accept the chastening Lord please just
[48:42] don't let go of me hallelujah
[48:46] oh and we know he won't hallelujah
[48:49] oh my I'll tell ya that's a wonderful
[48:52] thing amen verse 23 I thought was also
[48:56] very wonderful of this scripture as I
[48:58] read it's kind of just well the Lord
[49:02] does stuff like that no big deal
[49:05] no my brother and sister let it never
[49:08] cease to be marvelous in our eyes amen
[49:12] the simplest things of God that he does
[49:15] for us let it never cease to be
[49:18] marvelous people might think you're
[49:20] crazy when you say you know what I
[49:22] prayed about something last and I got up
[49:24] this morning you know I'm gonna tell I'm
[49:26] gonna pick on brother Trevor said okay
[49:28] brother Trevor Amen brother Trevor one
[49:30] time went to I don't know a second-hand
[49:32] store or something furniture store
[49:34] whatever and brother Trevor sits down in
[49:37] a recliner and he likes that recliner
[49:38] and whatever the circumstance was he got
[49:41] up and left that day didn't buy that
[49:42] recliner but his pickup keys disappeared
[49:46] amen and so brother Trevor looks high
[49:48] and low correct me if I get this wrong
[49:49] brother Trevor but he looks his keys
[49:51] amen and so what for two weeks amen and
[49:56] then one day whatever the inspiration is
[49:58] we know what the inspiration was he goes
[50:01] back to look at that recliner again and
[50:03] he sits down in the chair he'd ask the
[50:07] church to print in two weeks before and
[50:10] he's sitting there and he see it feels
[50:12] something there and he pulls out his
[50:14] keys now my brother and sister you tell
[50:20] me God does not care about us tell me
[50:22] that the simple things of life that God
[50:24] does not
[50:26] anoint him to go right back to that very
[50:28] chair to do that did you buy the chair
[50:30] yeah yeah see he didn't even buy the
[50:34] chair so what was it it was the Holy
[50:37] Ghost led him right back what was it the
[50:40] answer to prayer but it might have been
[50:42] the idea that I I really like this chair
[50:45] I'd like to buy this chair but this
[50:48] chair is expensive and I'm gonna go sit
[50:51] in it one more time and God says no
[50:53] you're gonna go sit in a more time
[50:55] because I'm answering your prayer amen
[50:59] I'll tell you my brother tell me God
[51:01] don't hear our cry tell me God doesn't
[51:04] come in the simple things
[51:06] hallelujah some people would say well he
[51:08] was lucky yeah well I'd rather be
[51:10] blessed and lucky hallelujah amen so as
[51:15] we look at this we realize that
[51:17] everything God does for his bride should
[51:20] be marvelous in her eyes oh my my my my
[51:24] my amen well this is a day which the
[51:28] LORD hath made we will rejoice and be
[51:31] glad in it hallelujah I don't know some
[51:35] days they don't feel like they're real
[51:36] blessed days right amen the wheels fall
[51:39] off the wagon this goes wrong that goes
[51:42] wrong but we need to stop look back to
[51:45] the scripture and say you know what this
[51:47] is a day that the Lord hath made he knew
[51:50] what would be in my life today and I say
[51:53] thank you lord
[51:55] I will come out of this day victorious
[51:59] hallelujah hallelujah now as we're
[52:02] talking this evening for a few minutes
[52:04] I've already burnt up most of those few
[52:06] minutes but we have confidence in the
[52:08] finished work now my brother and sister
[52:11] when you have confidence in something
[52:14] you you cannot have a partial trust you
[52:18] have to as we would look at this a
[52:20] partial trust versus a complete trust as
[52:23] I was speaking earlier you know if you
[52:27] speak to someone trust me now they're
[52:30] going to be very prone to trust you if
[52:32] you are proven Amen if your proven
[52:35] article if you you have something they
[52:38] can trust in
[52:39] amen so partial trust means I will trust
[52:43] you so far you know it depends on what
[52:45] you're doing you say well you know I'll
[52:47] Drive you down to the ice-cream shop you
[52:49] know ride with me trust me well you know
[52:52] if it's only two blocks away they might
[52:54] calculate in their mind the odds of
[52:56] surviving that ride they might not want
[52:58] to drive across the country with you
[53:00] though amen so partial and complete
[53:02] trust right simple analogy but it's
[53:05] there my brother and sister what happens
[53:07] is is if we have a partial trust in God
[53:11] we have a point that will trust God so
[53:14] far we would trust God to to work
[53:16] certain things out for us now I hope I
[53:19] don't speak out of line this evening but
[53:20] my brother and sister our brother Tim we
[53:22] see the witness of him being here
[53:23] tonight
[53:24] now brother Tim said please pray because
[53:27] I didn't come out here to to miss all
[53:29] these services because I have to work
[53:30] and so I want God to change his schedule
[53:32] and we stood right here in the four-year
[53:34] of this church and he said well I don't
[53:36] just want God to change that my schedule
[53:38] I don't know if you remember the words
[53:40] you spoke brother Tim he said God will
[53:41] change my schedule amen what is this
[53:44] this is not a partial trust like I'm
[53:46] hoping but he's speaking this saying I
[53:49] believe I'm declaring I'm trusting God
[53:52] will hear my cry and honor what I desire
[53:56] and that's to be in the house of the God
[53:57] now you know if it's like Lord I need
[53:59] you to change my schedule so I can be on
[54:01] the bowling league on Wednesday night
[54:02] well my brother and sister I don't know
[54:04] whether that prayer will come to pass or
[54:06] not hey man it might be just as a test
[54:08] you know hallelujah because Allah Lord
[54:11] will chasten you sore yep hallelujah
[54:17] reminds me of a guy years ago he's a
[54:18] denominational man but he skipped church
[54:20] to go bowling and forgot his ball
[54:23] borrowed else's ball it stuck on his
[54:25] fingers let go of it broke two of his
[54:27] fingers hallelujah
[54:29] you know what his wife told him we don't
[54:32] even go there yeah yep yeah I think she
[54:39] said something to him on the order of
[54:41] you have to clap really hard to break
[54:42] them fingers in church hallelujah what
[54:49] is faith a complete trust or confidence
[54:55] now if something my brother and sister
[54:57] is complete that means it is finished
[55:00] hallelujah now let's just put on the
[55:02] whole armor of God here for just a few
[55:04] minutes
[55:04] amen and so Paul here is speaking of a
[55:07] soldier dressing going to war a soldier
[55:10] getting himself in armor preparing for a
[55:12] battle and I kind of I kind of like the
[55:15] way that he places it preparation you
[55:19] know I believe it was Lincoln that said
[55:21] one time in the time of peace prepare
[55:23] for war or it might not have been he but
[55:25] it sounds like seize me rather that it
[55:27] was he that made that statement in time
[55:29] of peace prepare for war now my brother
[55:32] and sister went all's well in your house
[55:34] we don't quit praying we don't quit
[55:36] reading our Bible we don't quit
[55:38] listening the Prophet we don't quit
[55:39] going to church because hey everything's
[55:41] going good right in the time of peace we
[55:44] prepare ourself for war hallelujah amen
[55:48] yeah that would be a good thing for us
[55:51] to think about in time while everything
[55:53] is running smooth you berry long you're
[55:56] in a convention now and everything will
[55:58] just pour along fine but you're going to
[56:01] leave here in a few days and you're
[56:02] going to meet the enemy he might not
[56:04] even wait till you get ready to leave he
[56:06] might attack any time he so he's wicked
[56:09] and ruthless he just carries on whenever
[56:12] he can whatever he can say or do he does
[56:16] it right now he so it's best to be
[56:18] dressed all the time
[56:20] amen you might meet him on the street
[56:22] you might meet him in your car in the
[56:24] car hard telling where you meet him or
[56:26] he will meet you right in the seat there
[56:29] and me right here in the pulpit here
[56:32] anywhere he just wicked and he doesn't
[56:35] care so we want to be prepared for it
[56:39] and this great teacher st. Paul was
[56:42] teaching the church how to put on the
[56:44] armor and he was likening to a soldier
[56:46] getting ready for a great
[56:47] battle ahead now we find out about in
[56:52] nations that there is many times that
[56:54] nations no matter whether they're
[56:55] friendly are not friendly each nation
[56:57] has its spies now we have our spies all
[57:00] over the world every nation in the world
[57:02] has their spies here whether they're
[57:04] friendly or not friendly amen let's just
[57:07] proceed that forward please and they're
[57:10] kind of a little suspicious you know now
[57:14] England is one of our sister nations but
[57:16] yet we got spies in England England's
[57:21] got spies here we have them everywhere
[57:23] yet so they make their rounds and
[57:26] they're friendly nice people but there's
[57:34] really really nothing that you can say
[57:36] against them but they're just on the
[57:38] alert watching see what's going on and
[57:40] watching for some new weapon that's
[57:42] going to be developed and they'll slip
[57:44] right in and see how that weapon is and
[57:46] then they'll send it to their own
[57:47] country and they'll prepare for the
[57:50] counter-attack whether if we use this
[57:52] weapon why they could counter-attack it
[57:54] to us or if we should use their weapon
[57:57] or they use their weapon on us our spies
[58:00] and we'll build some weapon to combat
[58:02] the weapons that they're planning on
[58:04] using or some secret secret service or
[58:07] some secret thing they're planning we
[58:09] are planning on doing and they'll make
[58:11] ready because they got spies here for
[58:13] that purpose to spy and see what we're
[58:15] doing
[58:16] we got spies they're spying out see what
[58:19] they're doing seems like we just can't
[58:21] really trust one another I hope you
[58:26] catch this in the spirit that brother
[58:28] Branham was preaching it just it just
[58:30] looks like there's something in human
[58:32] beings that just goes so far Wow
[58:42] and that's all the farther it can go and
[58:47] I'm glad there's something we can put
[58:49] complete trust in aren't you something
[58:52] that's we don't have to wonder think
[58:56] about just know that we could just rest
[58:59] like little children I think that's the
[59:03] way we should be especially Christians
[59:05] we should be like in the beginning you
[59:07] notice man is trying to find that place
[59:09] because when he was first made in the
[59:11] image of God he didn't have to shift for
[59:14] himself and God taken care of him but
[59:18] since he become an alien a wonder then
[59:20] he has to shift for himself and he's
[59:23] suspicious of spooky everything looks a
[59:27] little leery he's gone he don't want to
[59:32] wait for you now my brother and sister
[59:36] the reason that I bring this quote to
[59:39] you is that when we come to a place that
[59:43] the moving of the Holy Spirit comes and
[59:46] we don't have a complete trust in God we
[59:51] cannot open ourself and say Lord here am
[59:55] i we start to guard ourselves we start
[59:58] to say well I get nervous about this
[1:00:01] when people start shouting and people
[1:00:03] start hollering and people start
[1:00:04] speaking in tongues you know I remember
[1:00:07] one time we had a brother when we were
[1:00:09] down by the post office visiting the
[1:00:10] church he was speaking in tongues and
[1:00:13] and most of the church just was just
[1:00:15] their mouth was their jaw was slack and
[1:00:17] they were just like what's going on you
[1:00:23] see my brother and sister we've got to
[1:00:26] come to the place we have complete trust
[1:00:29] in God amen the scripture says the heart
[1:00:34] is deceitful so we can't trust the heart
[1:00:37] Amen it says that man has been an is an
[1:00:40] alien from God though we you can't trust
[1:00:42] the man but we've got to come to the
[1:00:46] place that there is so much of the word
[1:00:48] which is God right John 1 so much of the
[1:00:51] word in us that when we
[1:00:54] here the word the wording us can respond
[1:00:56] to the word that is spoken amen we
[1:00:59] people say well that's good we trust but
[1:01:02] verify
[1:01:03] well if we are studying the Word of God
[1:01:05] amen
[1:01:06] a brother from Canada I won't name his
[1:01:08] name tonight I have from the pulpit
[1:01:10] before but you know he's preaches and
[1:01:12] he'll just tell you no I'm not going to
[1:01:14] give you quotes I'm not to give you all
[1:01:16] of this stuff because if you are in the
[1:01:18] message like you should be in the
[1:01:19] message you will know whether I'm
[1:01:21] telling you the truth or not now people
[1:01:24] don't like that right because they don't
[1:01:25] know whether to say Amen or not and last
[1:01:28] brother Branham said it out we need to
[1:01:36] be in the word so far that we can trust
[1:01:38] it because we know it's the word that we
[1:01:41] can understand what is being spoken
[1:01:43] because that is the word Amen that is
[1:01:47] God Himself speaking to us and so we
[1:01:49] come into this place my brother and
[1:01:51] sister that if we do not have complete
[1:01:53] trust or confidence then we will hold
[1:01:56] back and I believe as brother Branham
[1:01:58] talks about the moving of the
[1:01:59] supernatural coming to that presence
[1:02:01] where the veil is right there and he
[1:02:03] talks about our paraphrases he says
[1:02:06] we'll come right up to that veil but
[1:02:07] we're afraid to go beyond it all my
[1:02:10] brother and sister we shouldn't be
[1:02:12] afraid to go beyond the veil we should
[1:02:14] long to go beyond the veil it should be
[1:02:17] at the very heart desire it should be
[1:02:19] the very thing that we're searching for
[1:02:21] is to get beyond the veil into the
[1:02:23] presence of Almighty God hallelujah oh
[1:02:27] and I would just speak to you here from
[1:02:29] this now and look at this the Church of
[1:02:32] the Living God amen now the prophet of
[1:02:34] God this is a prayer line this is
[1:02:36] something that he is speaking over an
[1:02:39] individual once again it's right here if
[1:02:42] you don't have notes you can obviously
[1:02:43] go to the to the recording of it and get
[1:02:47] this but brother Branham is now talking
[1:02:48] to an individual that has a need needs
[1:02:52] healing and he says if I can only get
[1:02:55] you to believe but you see he can't he's
[1:03:03] not gonna talk to him for two or three
[1:03:04] hours convince them
[1:03:06] he's not going to twist their arm he's
[1:03:09] not going to bribe them he's not going
[1:03:11] to threaten them
[1:03:13] he says if I can only get you to believe
[1:03:17] it's going to leave you if I can't
[1:03:20] it can hold you amen
[1:03:25] now it lays in your faith in the
[1:03:30] finished work at Calvary it in other
[1:03:32] words if you take what Webster says it
[1:03:35] lies in your confidence in the finished
[1:03:38] work of Calvary amen at Calvary do you
[1:03:43] believe that God can that God sent Jesus
[1:03:45] and he died for your healing all right
[1:03:48] sister your confidence has saved you now
[1:03:53] hey man I want to read it correct so
[1:03:55] nobody say I'm twisting it your faith
[1:03:56] has saved now you see she had to declare
[1:04:01] emphatically I believe this not I
[1:04:05] believe this if or I believe this as if
[1:04:08] I can get you to believe it we'll leave
[1:04:10] and there was something inside of her
[1:04:13] that says I believe this and I believe
[1:04:16] as I believe then it will leave me amen
[1:04:21] your faith has saved you now it's
[1:04:23] stopped audience come here Billy all
[1:04:25] right you can go off the platform be
[1:04:27] made well sister in the name of the Lord
[1:04:29] Jesus Christ your faith your confidence
[1:04:36] in God oh my brother and sister remember
[1:04:42] brother Brown talked about you know that
[1:04:43] that Oral Roberts you know would on the
[1:04:46] radio or television would talk about
[1:04:48] being a point of contact you notice
[1:04:50] brother Branham never never disputes
[1:04:52] that never rebukes and in fact he
[1:04:53] acknowledges that and speaks of people
[1:04:56] would view it but my brother and sister
[1:04:57] the prophet of God became a point of
[1:05:00] contact this woman who needed healing
[1:05:02] she needed something to change in her
[1:05:04] life amen if she could have just got
[1:05:06] that anywhere she could have went to any
[1:05:08] Church any pastor any individual but
[1:05:10] brother Branham became that point of
[1:05:12] contact that he puts that right before
[1:05:14] her and that presence of God that
[1:05:16] beautiful wonderful Spirit of God the
[1:05:19] Holy Ghost come
[1:05:20] right down there and in her and she knew
[1:05:22] that was the truth and her faith said
[1:05:24] amen to the word amen and it left her
[1:05:27] and her faith made her whole my brother
[1:05:30] and sister you see people get caught up
[1:05:33] in these things and and it will be their
[1:05:34] one encourage one can one help one can
[1:05:38] one say the right words as anointed by
[1:05:40] the Holy Ghost can one offer to pray for
[1:05:42] you can one come and you might say
[1:05:45] confront you in the fact that would say
[1:05:47] you need prayer and we're willing to
[1:05:49] pray for you God works in those ways my
[1:05:52] brother and sister but it's the faith in
[1:05:54] the Word of God God Almighty Amen John
[1:05:58] one their faith in the word of God is
[1:06:01] what moves mountains it's not faith in
[1:06:04] the preacher not faith in the church
[1:06:07] amen so you look at that you see now it
[1:06:14] lays in your faith in the finished work
[1:06:20] at Calvary
[1:06:21] oh my you realize what's laying inside
[1:06:25] of you
[1:06:26] Amen what lays inside of you we'll put
[1:06:31] the Word of God to work what lays inside
[1:06:34] of you will bring to pass the very word
[1:06:36] of God for this hour amen it lays inside
[1:06:40] of us it's already here right the
[1:06:43] prophet of God said everything you need
[1:06:45] to make the rapture is already inside of
[1:06:49] you what is the word doing it's
[1:06:50] unlocking it unlocking at a key a door
[1:06:53] you might say at a time getting a little
[1:06:55] deeper down into the soul the Spirit of
[1:06:58] the Lord invading you oh look at it hey
[1:07:02] man he's picking the lock no you've got
[1:07:04] to invite him in it's the lock and sneak
[1:07:07] in like a thief he wants to be invited
[1:07:10] Lord the doors open oh can we lift a
[1:07:13] hand tonight Lord the door is open come
[1:07:16] in Lord I'm inviting you in I don't need
[1:07:20] you to sneak in I want you to come in
[1:07:23] the door is open the front door is open
[1:07:25] the living room door is open the kitchen
[1:07:28] door is open every door in my house is
[1:07:31] open but the only way she
[1:07:33] we can allow that to happen is if we
[1:07:36] have complete trust anything short of
[1:07:39] complete trust now I don't want to get
[1:07:41] personal but it will be personal you got
[1:07:44] something in your life that you're
[1:07:45] hiding you're gonna lock that door
[1:07:47] you're gonna guard that door you're not
[1:07:49] gonna let him in that door and you think
[1:07:52] he don't know that come on it's time for
[1:07:58] us to have complete trust complete trust
[1:08:01] says no matter what has happened in my
[1:08:03] life no matter what I'm going through no
[1:08:06] matter the circumstances of it Lord the
[1:08:09] door is open come Lord amen reminds me
[1:08:15] of a minister once he said I sometimes
[1:08:16] question whether people want delivered
[1:08:19] or not and same Minister says there was
[1:08:27] a time an individual come right here to
[1:08:29] the platform I leaned over the rail and
[1:08:32] I was praying for him and I spoke he
[1:08:34] spoke he says I spoke these words to him
[1:08:37] in the man denied it and the Holy Ghost
[1:08:40] called him right there and said you're
[1:08:42] lying to my servant you talk now whole
[1:08:48] church hears the fact the man lies to
[1:08:51] the minister and gets called for it now
[1:08:54] if you're guarding it enough to lie you
[1:08:59] would think that would cause you to be
[1:09:00] angry well what happens the man realizes
[1:09:06] it was God that called him out not the
[1:09:09] preacher and he repents Life delivered
[1:09:14] amen repentance brings life Oh
[1:09:17] hallelujah look I'm not saying
[1:09:20] somebody's got hidden saying don't
[1:09:21] misunderstand on fidence in God I'm
[1:09:25] talking about us trust in him so much
[1:09:27] that if he calls us to the carpet we say
[1:09:30] Lord forgive me chasing me sorry Lord
[1:09:35] just don't let go of me hallelujah amen
[1:09:41] because my brother and sister
[1:09:43] it's that confidence in the word that
[1:09:45] puts it to work in us
[1:09:47] hey Ben now look at this hallelujah now
[1:09:51] Hebrews 3 and 14 amen
[1:09:57] for we are made partakers of christ if
[1:10:01] and to the end
[1:10:04] not very sweetness of the holy spirit
[1:10:06] when God called us we knew that we
[1:10:09] weren't of this world we knew we weren't
[1:10:11] the chicken hey man we knew we were an
[1:10:13] eagle if we can keep ahold of that does
[1:10:22] it say keep old so that promise no it
[1:10:27] says confidence
[1:10:30] you see there's got to be a point that
[1:10:32] we recognize I'm a son of God I'm a
[1:10:35] daughter of God and I don't care who or
[1:10:38] what devil says I am NOT I believe with
[1:10:41] every fiber of my being I am a son or
[1:10:45] daughter of God see you got to hold on
[1:10:47] to that confidence because if the devil
[1:10:49] starts to these things went sideways
[1:10:52] people that I knew people that I was
[1:10:54] well acquainted with ministers that had
[1:10:57] invited me to preach for them and they
[1:11:01] started making little statements well I
[1:11:03] don't know what brother Brown said here
[1:11:05] if I can believe that
[1:11:08] okay you know I am a fairly open guy to
[1:11:15] ideas honest you don't believe what
[1:11:21] brother Brown said right there that's
[1:11:22] good because he did speak it in a
[1:11:26] different way over here and so if you
[1:11:31] don't like the words here I could have
[1:11:33] grace for that but over here he uses
[1:11:37] Scripture and he ties it right back when
[1:11:42] you deny this it's not just words it's
[1:11:49] doubt it's fear
[1:11:51] it's unbelief
[1:11:53] so I'm actually I'm pretty pretty huh I
[1:11:58] don't like the word but I'll just use it
[1:12:00] I'm pretty liberal you can tell can't
[1:12:04] you but my brother and sister you ever
[1:12:08] see an individual whose confidence in
[1:12:11] God is waning you might as well write
[1:12:14] him a card who is good to know you
[1:12:17] because they will be gone
[1:12:21] hmm we won't get into that tonight
[1:12:23] because it take us in another direction
[1:12:25] amen what the prophet of God said about
[1:12:27] those spirits of those people who
[1:12:29] couldn't believe and then he says they
[1:12:31] have a religious spirit yeah so when
[1:12:34] they leave God it doesn't mean they just
[1:12:36] left God
[1:12:40] Lord Lord didn't we do many mighty works
[1:12:44] in your name no I didn't know I don't
[1:12:50] remember you I don't know you hmm
[1:12:56] you see they didn't leave religion they
[1:12:59] left God
[1:13:03] so Saints keep lots of that pulse of
[1:13:07] that confidence amen
[1:13:08] keep a hold to that you fall on your
[1:13:10] face you got mud on your face you look
[1:13:11] in the mirror and say oh my goodness
[1:13:13] what has happened to me I got mud on my
[1:13:14] face stand up say I'm a daughter of God
[1:13:16] I'm a son of God it doesn't matter about
[1:13:18] the mud amen the word will wash that off
[1:13:20] of me a man who doesn't matter about all
[1:13:22] these circumstances around me God will
[1:13:24] take care of that Oh I you know I got
[1:13:27] whipped in school you know I had a
[1:13:29] principal unfortunately from the third
[1:13:30] grade all the way to the ninth grade and
[1:13:33] well technically the tenth grade same
[1:13:35] guy kept following me around hey men
[1:13:38] this is a man that four things I didn't
[1:13:40] even do I say this a little bit humor
[1:13:42] but it's the truth
[1:13:43] this is a man the nature of it he was
[1:13:44] like Paul he said and it's like okay sir
[1:13:47] I'll go into his office one time
[1:13:49] something I never even did I won't go
[1:13:50] into it's kind of a disgusting thing
[1:13:52] that somebody and I just simply laughed
[1:13:54] I thought it was funny it was right in
[1:13:56] the class happened right there I laughed
[1:13:58] my head off the teacher says go to the
[1:13:59] office I go to the office principal says
[1:14:01] well Paul you shouldn't laugh and I said
[1:14:03] sir is there something against the rules
[1:14:05] about laughing he says well and
[1:14:06] you know laughing at the wrong time is
[1:14:08] is bad and they so he says hey did you
[1:14:10] know it was it was his like 58th
[1:14:13] birthday he says you know it's my
[1:14:14] birthday and I was like no I didn't sir
[1:14:16] and he says what get a plate right there
[1:14:18] and a fork and and there's some punch
[1:14:20] and get you a big piece of cake
[1:14:22] I'm like whoa my lucky time I sat there
[1:14:27] in his office I drank punch I ate this
[1:14:28] huge piece of cake and I took the last
[1:14:30] bite of cake he says grab the doorknob
[1:14:32] whoa what and he goes you didn't think
[1:14:37] you were getting off did you I was like
[1:14:41] this isn't fair he said I don't remember
[1:14:44] bringing up the word fair in our
[1:14:46] conversation and he hit me two times and
[1:14:51] then he said and here's the price for
[1:14:55] not telling your parents and hit me so
[1:14:58] hard it lifted my feet off the floor oh
[1:15:00] I had to go find me the back side of the
[1:15:03] restroom somewhere and cry cuz it hurts
[1:15:05] so bad but you know what I never did
[1:15:07] after that I never laughed in class now
[1:15:14] the Lord you might think has whipped you
[1:15:18] unnecessarily but I'm telling you if he
[1:15:21] needs to teach you a lesson
[1:15:23] say Lord whatever that lesson is let me
[1:15:25] receive it hallelujah now I when I say I
[1:15:29] never laughed in class I laughed in
[1:15:31] class when it was appropriate amen amen
[1:15:35] hallelujah well I hope I'm making sense
[1:15:37] tonight I haven't lost you out in the
[1:15:39] woods have I
[1:15:39] now Hebrews 10 let's look at this as we
[1:15:42] just move here to finish Hebrews 10:35
[1:15:45] he says cast not away therefore your
[1:15:47] confidence which has great recompense of
[1:15:50] reward so what the devil's actually
[1:15:53] coming down my brother and sister then
[1:15:55] I'll just gonna be blunt tonight he
[1:15:56] might not cause our sisters to cut her
[1:15:58] hair dress wrong he might not cause a
[1:16:00] brother
[1:16:00] out and do this and do that wrong but if
[1:16:03] he can steal our confidence in God if he
[1:16:07] can come down to where we pray but we
[1:16:09] don't really expect it to be answered we
[1:16:11] pray for others and we don't expect it
[1:16:13] to be answered we look at this and we
[1:16:16] say well Lord I know I've got
[1:16:17] shortcomings but you know please forgive
[1:16:19] me
[1:16:20] and
[1:16:20] there's just simply a complete sense of
[1:16:22] utter despair of seeing some change or
[1:16:26] result my brother and sister Satan's
[1:16:28] good at it you know there's two times
[1:16:31] the Satan really really works on
[1:16:33] individual when he's first saved he
[1:16:35] keeps them there ain't no way ain't no
[1:16:37] way ain't no way you what you've got is
[1:16:39] just nonsense and then he also works on
[1:16:42] the seasoned believer who has been
[1:16:45] serving God for so long but has become
[1:16:48] weary in well-doing
[1:16:50] they have prayed many a prayer maybe
[1:16:52] prayed prayers for their children prayed
[1:16:54] prayers for different things and they
[1:16:56] don't feel like God is hearing their
[1:16:57] prayer then they get into a certain
[1:17:00] state you might say of despair and their
[1:17:02] confidence and it comes that it comes to
[1:17:05] a place they quit praying they don't
[1:17:08] believe God's gonna even answer their
[1:17:09] prayers so they quit pray I remember a
[1:17:12] brother one time we went to his house
[1:17:14] sitting there waiting you know and when

[1:26:51] have a warped sense of humor nobody said
[1:26:53] he was following his wife through
[1:26:54] Walmart and these two young girls he
[1:26:57] said very worldly girls and when the
[1:27:01] brother's wife walked by they were

[1:27:18] was a little humorous this one girl's
[1:27:19] looking back snickering his wife said
[1:27:22] something about being a Holy Roller when
[1:27:24] the religious
[1:27:25] runs right into that one of them big
[1:27:26] support pipes in the middle store he

[1:27:57] desire in your heart to want to take the
[1:27:59] pure word amen that's a that's a
[1:28:02] privilege that's a blessing
[1:28:04] hallelujah hallelu now look how just one
[1:28:09] one more quick quote sister Emmy amen in
[1:28:14] the Seventh Seal but if you'll read
[1:28:16] Ephesians 4:30
[1:28:18] it says grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:28:20] God whereby you're sealed unto the day
[1:28:21] you of your Redemption yes sir
[1:28:24] when the mediatorial work is done and
[1:28:27] your Christ comes to redeem his own
[1:28:30] you are sealed not until the next
[1:28:34] revival when your one filled with the
[1:28:38] Holy Ghost it's a finished work that God
[1:28:42] has received you and there's no getting
[1:28:44] away from it hallelujah
[1:28:47] reminds me of a brother told me one time
[1:28:49] he said brother Paul he said I was
[1:28:51] raised in the message we got kind of
[1:28:52] comparing testimonies he said I was
[1:28:55] raised in the message and he said I
[1:28:58] wished I had a testimony like yours he
[1:29:00] said but I went out and he said I had
[1:29:03] many girlfriends a lot of liquor a lot
[1:29:06] of drugs a lot of things happened in my
[1:29:09] life and he said I ran fast and I ran
[1:29:13] far and when I got to the other end
[1:29:15] Christ was standing there waiting for me
[1:29:20] think about it
[1:29:21] how far we could run how fast we could
[1:29:25] run but if we have been called by God
[1:29:28] amen you can't get away from it
[1:29:32] oh and we ought to be thanking him for
[1:29:34] that too hallelujah
[1:29:36] you say well I had it and I went away no
[1:29:41] you didn't have it
[1:29:42] see you can't say you got the Holy Ghost
[1:29:45] you've got God himself deny his word and
[1:29:49] walk away from that that shows you never
[1:29:53] had him you don't find God and lose him
[1:29:57] amen God said it goes to the day of
[1:30:01] redemption
[1:30:01] now you just argue with him I like that
[1:30:06] line you know like that
[1:30:08] it's argue with him amen
[1:30:11] you see what it meaning till the day of
[1:30:14] your Redemption isn't it good to have
[1:30:19] confidence in gone amen to trust him
[1:30:22] trust his word trust the life he has
[1:30:24] poured into you and I hallelujah amen
[1:30:28] just move forward Saints just have
[1:30:30] confidence we're not called to be under
[1:30:33] the spirit of fear and then I kind of
[1:30:35] skipped over because I kind of got away
[1:30:36] from my notes there but my brother and
[1:30:38] sister you see when when God calls you
[1:30:41] when God lays down this foundation there
[1:30:44] comes a time my brother and sister you
