[14:10] a little bit behind. Um, God bless you.
[14:13] Good evening.
[14:14] Good to see each one. Not many, but
[14:18] still look forward to a good
[14:19] service.
[14:22] Amen. Let's go to number 447.
[14:30] [Music]
[14:37] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[14:42] the pilgrim way for the hand of God in
[14:46] all my life I see.
[14:50] And the reason of my bliss, yes, the
[14:54] secret all is this, that the comforter
[14:58] abides with
[15:01] me. He
[15:05] abides. He
[15:08] abides. Hallelu, he abides with me.
[15:15] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[15:19] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[15:24] with
[15:26] me. Once my heart was full of sin. Once
[15:31] I had no peace within till I heard how
[15:35] Jesus died upon the tree.
[15:40] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[15:44] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[15:48] abides with
[15:51] me. He
[15:54] abides. He
[15:57] abides. Halleluah. He abides with me.
[16:05] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[16:09] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[16:14] with
[16:16] me and he is with me
[16:19] everywhere and he knows my every care.
[16:23] I'm as happy as a bird and just as
[16:29] free for the spirit has control. Jesus
[16:34] satisfies my soul since the comforter
[16:38] abides with
[16:41] me. He
[16:44] abides. He
[16:48] abides. Halleluah. He abides with me.
[16:55] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[16:59] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[17:04] with
[17:06] me. There's no thirsting for the things
[17:10] of the world. They've taken wings. Long
[17:14] ago I gave them up and
[17:19] instantly all my night was turned to
[17:22] day. All my burdens rolled away. Now the
[17:27] comforter abides with
[17:31] me. He
[17:35] abides. He
[17:38] abides. Hallelu. He abides with me.
[17:45] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[17:49] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[17:54] with
[17:57] me. Amen. Let's go to number
[18:00] [Music]
[18:06] 621. There's a country far beyond the
[18:10] starry sky.
[18:13] There's a city where there never comes a
[18:18] night. If we're faithful, we shall go
[18:22] there by and
[18:25] by. Says the city where the lamb is the
[18:31] light. In that city where the lamb is
[18:35] the
[18:37] light. In that city where there come it
[18:41] no
[18:43] night. I have a mansion over there. And
[18:48] when free from toil and care I am going
[18:52] where the lamb is the
[18:56] light. Here we have our days of
[18:59] sunshine. But we
[19:02] know that the sun which shines upon us
[19:06] now so
[19:09] bright will be changed to clouds and
[19:12] rain until we
[19:15] go to the city where the lamb is the
[19:21] light. In that city where the lamb is
[19:26] the light.
[19:29] In that city where there cometh no
[19:34] night, I have a mansion over there. And
[19:38] when free from toil and care, I am going
[19:43] where the lamb is the
[19:46] light. There the flowers bloom forever
[19:51] and the
[19:53] day shall be one eternal day without a
[19:59] night. And our tears shall be forever
[20:03] wiped
[20:06] away. In that city where the lamb is the
[20:10] light.
[20:13] In that city where the lamb is the
[20:18] light. In that city where there cometh
[20:23] no
[20:25] night. I have a mansion over there and
[20:29] went free from toil and care. I am going
[20:33] where the lamb is the
[20:37] light. Here we have our
[20:40] disappointments all the
[20:43] while. And our fondest hopes but meet
[20:47] with bitter
[20:50] blood. Though by night we weep, the
[20:53] morning brings a
[20:56] smile. In that city where the lamb is
[21:01] the light.
[21:03] In that city where the lamb is the
[21:09] light. In that city where there cometh
[21:13] no
[21:15] night. I have a mansion over there. And
[21:19] when free from toil and care I am going
[21:24] where the lamb is the
[21:27] light. Then let sunlight fade the
[21:31] twilight bring its
[21:34] gloom. Not a shadow can my blissful soul
[21:38] a
[21:40] fright. For I know that up in heaven
[21:44] there is
[21:46] room. In that city where the lamb is the
[21:51] light.
[21:53] In that city where the lamb is the
[21:59] light. In that city where there cometh
[22:03] no
[22:05] night. I have a mansion over there. And
[22:09] when free from toil and care I am going
[22:14] where the lamb is the
[22:19] light. Amen. Let's go to number two. Um
[22:24] 247 before we go to the
[22:27] [Music]
[22:36] prayer. Heal me, oh

[31:01] come, let's sing number two um
[31:04] 206. I love you, Lord.
[31:13] I love you
[31:18] Lord and I lift my
[31:25] voice to
[31:29] worship you.
[31:32] Oh my
[31:36] soul,
[31:39] rejoice. Take joy, my
[31:45] king,
[31:46] in what you hear.
[31:52] Let it be a
[31:55] sweet,
[31:56] sweet
[31:58] sound in your
[32:04] ears. Let's dance together.
[32:07] Oh, I love you,
[32:12] Lord, and I lift my
[32:19] voice to
[32:23] worship
[32:25] you, oh my
[32:29] soul,
[32:32] rejoice, take joy, my
[32:37] King
[32:39] in what you
[32:44] hear. Let it be a
[32:47] sweet sweet.
[32:54] Let's sing that once more time.
[32:57] Oh, I love you,
[33:03] Lord, and I lift my
[33:09] voice to
[33:13] worship
[33:15] you, oh my soul.
[33:22] Rejoice. Take joy, my
[33:27] king,
[33:29] in what you
[33:33] hear. Let it be a sweet,
[33:38] sweet
[33:40] sound in your ear.
[33:45] [Music]
[33:47] May he grant it tonight.
[33:50] May our hearts be centered on one thing.
[33:53] He's in our midst tonight. He's here. If
[33:57] you've come to meet him, he's here.
[33:59] You're going to get what you expect. You
[34:01] say, "Well, there's not many here." That
[34:02] does not mean anything to the Lord.
[34:05] Where two or three are gathered in my
[34:06] name, there am I in the midst. Now, he's
[34:10] here and he will do abundantly above
[34:13] what you can ask or even think or even
[34:16] desire. So, let's look to him. Don't
[34:19] notice the two bit 2x4 preacher out
[34:23] here, this lump of clay, but you notice
[34:25] him in his
[34:27] word. That's what he wants you to see.
[34:29] He wants you to see himself in you. He
[34:33] wants you to come to realize your
[34:35] position, who you are. And so, I'm
[34:39] thankful for his mercy. I'm thankful
[34:41] that he's present. And I'm thankful
[34:43] we're gathered together and we are
[34:45] expecting him to move according to his
[34:47] will.
[34:50] I appreciated the song he carth or I
[34:53] that's not the name of it but in there
[34:55] he carth for you. That's exactly right.
[34:58] Do you believe he cares for you? The
[35:00] Bible he carth for you. It's not someone
[35:02] just cares a far off out here. No, he
[35:04] carth for you. Every bit of your going
[35:08] and coming, he's ordering and directed
[35:10] bride. Do you realize that he's in
[35:13] control?
[35:15] you try to take control, it won't ever
[35:17] work. But if you'll let go and let him
[35:19] have control, you'll see him manifest
[35:22] himself more and more. Amen. God bless
[35:25] you. The musicians, God bless you. Amen.
[35:28] I just greet those that are online. May
[35:31] the Lord open his word to us and bless
[35:33] his word tonight. That's what we're
[35:35] asking to do. May he bless his word.
[35:38] Let's have a word of prayer before we
[35:39] open the word. Heavenly Father, we give
[35:42] praise to you which you are worthy of
[35:44] all praise, all honor, all glory. And we
[35:47] know we cannot truly worship you except
[35:50] we worship you in spirit and in truth.
[35:53] The spirit and the word must come
[35:55] together. And that's what's happening in
[35:56] your little bride, Lord. The spirit and
[35:58] the word are uniting, too, because he
[36:01] can't marry outside of himself. He
[36:04] marries himself. He marries his own
[36:07] word. And so, Father, we're thankful for
[36:10] this great unity that we have in this
[36:12] hour. A great relationship, a great uh
[36:16] participation, not only a participation,
[36:18] but you are but you are partnership
[36:22] partnering
[36:23] partning with man. And we Lord, we
[36:27] acknowledge this. May you take my this
[36:29] vessel, speak your words as as far as I
[36:33] know right now, I'm in your total
[36:34] control. May you minister to every
[36:37] individual heart as they have need. In
[36:40] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[36:44] I'd like you to turn with me to the book
[36:45] of
[36:47] Ephesians. I have scripture here and
[36:50] I'll let you be seated. I've got other
[36:52] scriptures as the Lord will lead here
[36:55] tonight. And I want to title this here
[36:58] am I so relax. Let go. Here am I. So
[37:05] relax. Let
[37:07] go. His works. If I was to put a subject
[37:11] here, his works you'll
[37:13] do. Amen. Because why? God has a
[37:16] prisoner, a
[37:18] bride, a love, a love. He called a love
[37:21] slave, but is a prisoner. We are
[37:23] prisoners of his love. Amen. Amen. So
[37:26] thankful for his grace and mercy. Let's
[37:29] just take our minds off. And now what
[37:31] the affairs of today because when you
[37:33] come in with things on your mind, what
[37:35] you think about is an
[37:37] atmosphere. What you speak is an
[37:40] atmosphere. And so we want to bring the
[37:42] atmosphere of his presence. We have come
[37:44] here for one purpose, not to be seen of
[37:45] others. We've come to meet him. And
[37:48] that's my purpose isn't to be seen. My
[37:50] purpose is to give myself to him and let
[37:52] him speak through this vessel. He wants
[37:54] to reveal himself in you and use your
[37:56] vessel.
[37:57] I wonder how many of us would realize
[38:00] that and let go and recognize. I say
[38:03] God, let us realize, keep revealing to
[38:05] us that we are
[38:06] prisoners, a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
[38:09] And wait patiently on him. We get in
[38:12] such a hurry. Everything's a hurry up,
[38:14] hurry up, hurry up. Because we live in a
[38:15] hurry up age. We live in a nervous
[38:18] tension. Riches, soft living. We weren't
[38:22] meant to be that way. We're meant to
[38:23] depend completely upon God, but because
[38:26] we have an outer man that's against it.
[38:28] My enemy is David Deanhard. He's always
[38:30] getting in God's way, but God is taking
[38:33] him out of the way. God is showing me my
[38:35] position of who I am and taking
[38:38] authority over this clay. And so, let's
[38:41] let's realize that that we are at the
[38:44] very end of of the time. And so, God
[38:46] bless you. Ephesians
[38:48] 2 and verse
[38:51] 10. For we, is there any we in here? For
[38:55] we are his
[38:58] workmanship. Created in Christ Jesus.
[39:02] Where are we
[39:04] created? We are created in in Christ
[39:08] Jesus. He come he was the fullness of
[39:10] the Godhead bodily. When God made man,
[39:12] become the son. He was the fullness of
[39:16] God in one man. And so, but we were in
[39:20] him when he was a created. How many know
[39:22] he was a created being? Amen. God
[39:25] created himself in the womb of a of a of
[39:27] a woman, a a
[39:30] carrier. And and that was God's
[39:33] creation. But when he created that, he
[39:35] created you. You were in him. So, we got
[39:39] to realize that we are his
[39:41] workmanship. Amen. There's a there's a
[39:44] great difference when you being his
[39:47] workmanship. Amen. And that's a great
[39:50] understanding. So being his workmanship
[39:52] in Christ Jesus unto good works. Notice
[39:56] we are created for a purpose. We are
[39:58] brought into the earth for a purpose.
[40:00] That's unto good works which God hath
[40:04] depended upon you to make happen. Not at
[40:07] all. Not at all. It's his achieving.
[40:11] It's his doing. Salvation is absolutely
[40:13] of the Lord alone. And and and we are
[40:17] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[40:19] which God hath before ordained.
[40:24] Now do you believe he can keep what he
[40:25] ordained? Which God hath before ordained
[40:28] that we should walk that we should walk
[40:32] in them.
[40:34] Now that's taken therefore with this
[40:36] scripture and we'll go on to it further.
[40:38] That's taken that completely out of your
[40:40] hands as a man.
[40:42] You don't have to look to do good works.
[40:43] The good works will be there. They're
[40:45] there. They've been ordained of God. If
[40:46] you're in Christ Jesus, your works are
[40:49] already, your good works are
[40:50] alreadyained of God that you would walk
[40:52] in them. So, quit complaining on where
[40:55] you are and who you are and what God
[40:56] made you to be.
[40:59] You find fault. We're finding fault.
[41:00] Well, I don't like this. I don't like
[41:02] this pos. I don't like this situation. I
[41:04] don't like this atmosphere. But God
[41:05] allowed it. But God's in control. Amen.
[41:09] You're not in control. So you're out of
[41:10] control. But when you're in control is
[41:13] when you submit yourself to the Lord
[41:14] Jesus and let him work through you. God
[41:17] wants to work through you. He's
[41:18] partnership with you. He wants to work
[41:20] through you. So he's saying, "Here am
[41:24] I.
[41:26] Relax. Let go." All right. You can be
[41:30] seated. I'd like you to turn with me to
[41:33] Galatians chapter
[41:36] two. You say, "Well, relax." But yeah,
[41:38] I'm talking about relaxing in something.
[41:40] I'm not talking about you just letting
[41:42] go and happy golucky and no, I'm I'm
[41:45] saying relax in him. Then relax. If he's
[41:48] in you and he's controlling the thing,
[41:51] what else do you have to do but just
[41:53] relax, let off the
[41:56] pressure. Amen. Amen.
[41:58] Philippians or excuse me,
[42:01] Galatians chapter
[42:06] 2 and verse
[42:09] 20. These are very familiar scriptures.
[42:11] But oh, I don't care how familiar the
[42:13] scriptures are. You you you have a lot
[42:16] of but until God reveals
[42:18] it, it's just intellectual. You're
[42:22] intellectually you receive it but then
[42:24] God has to take that and quicken it to
[42:26] you, reveal it to you. Amen. So
[42:30] Galatians 2:20, I am crucified with
[42:34] Christ. Amen. Can you say amen? I am
[42:37] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[42:41] live. Yet not I. Paul wants you to know
[42:45] that it's not Paul, but Christ
[42:49] livingth in me.
[42:52] Amen.
[42:53] And the life and the life which I now
[42:56] live in the
[42:59] flesh. I live by the
[43:02] faith. By the faith. Whose faith? Of the
[43:05] son of
[43:07] God, his own faith. Remember the
[43:10] believer is the faith of God. Where does
[43:12] faith rest? Where do you find faith? In
[43:14] the word.
[43:16] Amen. Because before it was a word, it
[43:18] was a thought. And that thought existed
[43:21] in God. And he expressed that thought.
[43:24] When he expressed that thought, he
[43:25] expressed his faith because when he
[43:27] expressed it in a word, he believed what
[43:29] he said. Amen. All right. So we find
[43:32] faith in the word. So the believer is
[43:34] the faith of God. Not not your faith.
[43:37] It's God's faith. Right? The believer is
[43:39] the faith of God or the seed of God made
[43:41] alive and quickened moving in you.
[43:44] That's why the bride could say that the
[43:46] word living would be the bride. The
[43:48] bride would be the word living and in
[43:51] action. All right. So, let me read this
[43:54] again. I am crucified with Christ.
[43:57] Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I. It's
[44:00] not I living, but Christ liveth in me.
[44:03] And the life now, that's a new creature.
[44:05] That's a new life. That's a that's a
[44:07] created
[44:09] life. See, the new birth is a spoken
[44:11] word creation. It's not something you
[44:13] imagine. is something you have, you
[44:15] know, and it's alive, living. It's
[44:18] Christ in you. And I'm I I am crucified
[44:22] with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet
[44:24] not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the
[44:27] life which I now live in the
[44:29] flesh. I live what life? What life is he
[44:32] living in the flesh? He said it wasn't
[44:34] his his life. Then what life is it? It's
[44:38] eternal life. It's Christ's own life.
[44:41] And the life which I now live in the
[44:43] flesh, I live by the faith of the son of
[44:47] God. Now watch this. Who loved me
[44:50] and gave
[44:53] himself for me. Well, you say, "Yes,
[44:55] brother David, that's so." He gave
[44:57] himself, but it's more than just
[44:59] somebody dying on a tree 2,000 years
[45:02] ago. What does that have to do with me
[45:04] now? Because he gave himself. He
[45:06] imparted himself. Now, that one that
[45:08] died poured out that blood. life was in
[45:10] that blood and now comes in us. He gave
[45:14] his own life for us. Where does that
[45:16] life go?
[45:18] Where is it gone? He's gone to his
[45:20] people. He He redeemed his own, right?
[45:24] But there's a next step from redemption
[45:25] is the claiming what he redeemed. And
[45:27] that's the opening of this seals. That's
[45:29] the opening of the book. And so, and so
[45:32] because why? Now, I'm going to step
[45:34] ahead of this because another sermon,
[45:36] but because you are the word opened in
[45:38] the book.
[45:41] Amen. So, so where's this life? He He
[45:45] gave himself. It wasn't just something
[45:48] you say, well, you know, everybody just
[45:49] believes, well, yeah, Jesus gave
[45:51] himself, but it's more than that. He
[45:55] gave himself so you would live. He gave
[45:57] himself so you would manifest him. It's
[46:00] himself in you. He gave himself. Now,
[46:03] there should be no that should take away
[46:05] the friction. That should take away the
[46:07] fr frustration. That should take away
[46:09] the
[46:09] fretting. Amen. Because he's given
[46:12] himself for you and I. For me, me
[46:15] individually. Me. Yeah. It's a life
[46:18] lived. It isn't It isn't a religion
[46:21] lived. Don't ever let this message
[46:22] become your religion. That's right.
[46:24] Amen. It's a life. It's eternal life.
[46:27] It's not church life. It's not this
[46:29] life. It's not another. It's his life.
[46:31] Amen. Living in you. Amen. Growing in
[46:34] you. If we had growing in the bride to a
[46:37] full stature. Amen. It's it's beyond the
[46:40] birth now. Amen. To the bride. It's
[46:42] beyond the birth. It's the birth. That
[46:44] word birth growing into a word bride.
[46:48] Amen. Amen. She's here for one thing.
[46:51] The message of the hour is a capstone
[46:52] ministry. She's here to manifest that.
[46:55] Amen. So, he gave himself for me. I
[46:57] don't want to get off on these sides
[46:59] because I have things I need to bring
[47:01] here. So, God help me. John 20. Let's go
[47:04] to John chapter
[47:06] 20. John chapter 20 and verse 21 and
[47:14] 22. Verse 21. Then said Jesus unto them
[47:17] again. Let's start up here with verse
[47:23] 20. No, let's just stay with verse 21.
[47:26] Then said Jesus to them again, peace be
[47:29] unto you. He's meeting with his
[47:31] disciples. He came when the door was
[47:33] shut and he said, "Peace be." But he
[47:35] said again, "Peace be unto you. As my
[47:39] father hath sent me," now watch this.
[47:42] "As my father hath sent me, even so send
[47:47] I
[47:49] you." Verse 22. And when he had said
[47:52] this, he breathed on them again, and
[47:54] saith unto them, "Receive ye the Holy
[47:56] Ghost." Now, his word is being breathed
[47:58] on you tonight. If you don't have the
[48:01] Holy Ghost, he's breathing on you,
[48:03] saying, "Receive it."
[48:06] Amen. You say, "Well, that's just No,
[48:07] it's that simple.
[48:10] He just said, "Peace be unto you." He
[48:12] said, "As my father has sent me, as my
[48:15] father has sent
[48:18] me, so send
[48:22] you." And then he said, "Receive ye.
[48:25] Breathe unto them. breathe on them and
[48:27] saith unto them, "Receive ye the Holy
[48:30] Ghost. I gave myself for you." What did
[48:33] I give to you? I'm giving it to you
[48:34] right there. Receive ye the Holy Spirit.
[48:38] Holy Ghost. Whosoever sins you remit,
[48:41] they are remitted unto them. And
[48:42] whosoever sins you retain, they are
[48:45] retained. So there's power. There's a
[48:47] there's there's authority in that life.
[48:51] Now, it's him that comes in. It's not
[48:54] you anymore living. It's him. Paul said,
[48:56] "It's not I that liveth, it's Christ
[48:57] that liveth in me."
[49:00] Amen. Amen.
[49:03] So in First John, 1 John
[49:11] 3, 1 John chapter 3 verse 1.
[49:20] Behold, what manner of love the Father
[49:23] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[49:26] called the sons of
[49:28] God. Therefore the world knoweth not us.
[49:32] That's
[49:33] mankind. That's not that is the world.
[49:36] Mankind
[49:38] knoweth therefore the world knoweth us
[49:41] not because it knew him
[49:44] not. Now it knoweth us not because it
[49:48] knew him not.
[49:51] So why would he say that? Because his
[49:53] life is in you. Now what manner of love
[49:56] hath God bestowed upon us that we could
[49:58] be called the sons of
[50:01] God? Therefore the
[50:04] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[50:07] not. Beloved, verse two, beloved, now
[50:11] are we the sons of God, and it does not
[50:14] yet appear what we shall be, but we know
[50:18] when he shall appear. Now, brother,
[50:20] sister, you can differ with this. Many
[50:22] of and every scripture is has a dual
[50:26] revelation. We know by the message, by
[50:30] the word, by the seals being opened, we
[50:32] know that he's appeared.
[50:35] Amen. We know that. And when he appears,
[50:38] it it's not just it's just not
[50:40] happening. Well, when he appears, we
[50:42] meet him in the sky. We're going to meet
[50:43] him. But first, there has to be an
[50:45] appearing here. There has to be a
[50:46] fulfilling of his second coming because
[50:49] when that takes place there, that's
[50:51] opening the third
[50:53] coming. We we there's three comingings
[50:55] of Christ, but we're in his second.
[50:58] Amen. Because what was how was he to
[51:01] appear to us in this day? He was to
[51:04] appear the same one, but in another
[51:05] form.
[51:07] It's the same Christ. Amen. Amen. Now
[51:10] watch. He said, "For when he shall
[51:13] appear, we shall be like him, for we
[51:15] shall see him." That see is
[51:18] understanding.
[51:20] For we shall see him as he is.
[51:26] Now dropping back here to St. John 20
[51:30] 21.
[51:33] He He that knows me knows my father. Now
[51:37] St. John 14:20, let me just back here a
[51:40] little bit. You don't turn to this, but
[51:41] St. John 14:20, Jesus said, "At that
[51:44] day, you shall know." Not imagine, you
[51:48] shall know. And we know, we had a
[51:50] prophet interpret that scripture saying,
[51:52] "We are in that day." We knew we were in
[51:55] that day because this is the day for
[51:57] this to be fully known. He said, he
[52:01] said, "At that day," that's this day,
[52:04] "you shall know." Now, ye, I know that
[52:06] there's ye here, he's talking
[52:09] specifically to an individual. You shall
[52:13] know. Amen. You shall
[52:16] know that I am in my
[52:19] father, and ye in me, and I in you.
[52:25] Okay, that's something you know. Yes.
[52:29] Amen. Amen. Because why? It's revealed
[52:33] to you. This new birth is Jesus Christ
[52:35] revealed in you is the new birth.
[52:38] Amen. If you're born again, that's who
[52:40] it is. That's who you are. That's that
[52:44] new creation. All right. You're his
[52:46] workmanship,
[52:48] created in Christ Jesus unto good
[52:52] works. Unto good works. Now, if God
[52:55] ordained you to do good works, who's
[52:57] going to stop it?
[52:59] Who's going to say it can't be done? You
[53:01] just need to let go and relax and let
[53:03] him do it. We're always trying to get in
[53:06] the way trying to find a way to do good
[53:08] works. You don't need to go out here
[53:09] seeking to do good works, trying to find
[53:11] ways to do good works. Stop you trying
[53:13] to do it and let him do it. He'll
[53:15] inspire. He'll direct. He'll guide you
[53:17] to be where you are. He'll He'll direct
[53:20] you and guide you in those works. We're
[53:23] always trying to figure it out. Quit
[53:25] trying to figure it out. He never asked
[53:27] you to figure it out. He said he's
[53:30] already ordained you to good works which
[53:32] he hath before ordained that you would
[53:34] walk in them. So let go and let God have
[53:37] his wonderful way. He's the one that's
[53:39] leading. You may not understand. You may
[53:41] not know why, but all things work
[53:43] together for good to them that love God,
[53:46] to them that are called according to his
[53:48] purpose. Now, you can either settle that
[53:50] in your heart and quit your striving and
[53:52] struggling about it and give away to it
[53:55] and say, "God, it's all in your hands.
[53:56] I'm born of your spirit. You've given
[53:58] yourself to me. It's your life living in
[54:00] me. Then what am I struggling for?"
[54:02] Right? Because you have an outer man
[54:05] that doesn't believe the word.
[54:08] It's an evil one. It's an enemy to you.
[54:10] But he's can't conquer you because
[54:12] you're of God. And because you're of
[54:14] God, greater is he that is in you than
[54:16] he is of the world. Then why question
[54:18] where he's guiding you? He already has
[54:20] control over you. You either believe
[54:22] that or you don't. Now you're going to
[54:24] get what you believe. That's right.
[54:26] You're going to have what you believe.
[54:29] Amen. That's exactly right. You can
[54:31] believe you. You're taking Don't try to
[54:34] find fault with God. He's your his
[54:36] workmanship.
[54:38] He He already He already created you. He
[54:41] was the firstborn among the dead. He was
[54:44] the first one I mean the the living
[54:45] firstborn to raise among the dead. He's
[54:48] the firstborn among many creatures. Is
[54:50] he? Who's his creations? You are his
[54:54] body is the fullness of him that filth
[54:57] all in all. Now I haven't got that
[54:59] scripture but notice he is the head of
[55:01] the body which is the church which is
[55:04] the fullness of him. Hello. Which is the
[55:08] fullness of him that fillth all in all.
[55:10] In other words, he fillth every one of
[55:13] those members. He's directing it. He's
[55:15] the head. Then why not just relax and
[55:17] let go and let him lead? Amen. Amen.
[55:20] Quit threatening about it and struggling
[55:22] over it and say, "God, I accept your
[55:25] promise. I accept your word. I'm
[55:27] accepting your
[55:29] leadership. Your ways are perfect. Your
[55:31] ways in me and your leadership of me
[55:33] can't be anything but perfect." And you
[55:35] have also said that because of that, my
[55:38] way is made perfect. Right. Amen.
[55:42] Amen. All right. So, who's who's in your
[55:46] way? Who is it that would hinder you?
[55:48] I'll tell you who's hindering it. It's
[55:50] man called David is hindering me. But
[55:53] when I can move David out of the way and
[55:55] quit trying quit trying to quit trying
[55:58] to do things in my own thinking and my
[56:00] own and my own way and relax and let him
[56:02] have his way. You know what? We have
[56:05] need of patience.
[56:07] And my mother always used to say, "God
[56:09] is working. God is faithful. Only wait."
[56:13] That's the truth. God is working. How
[56:16] many believe he's working? God is
[56:18] faithful. You don't understand it
[56:20] because his thoughts are higher than
[56:21] your carnal thought. His ways are higher
[56:24] than your ways. But you are his
[56:26] workmanship and he's living in you.
[56:29] Then let him work his work. Let him do
[56:31] what he wants to do. Let him let him let
[56:33] him do it. Well, I don't understand it.
[56:35] He never asked you to understand it. He
[56:37] said, "Do you believe it?" Then you are
[56:39] in a trust affair or a love affair with
[56:42] God. If you're in a love affair with
[56:43] him, you're going to depend on him.
[56:45] You're going to say, "Lord, I know that
[56:47] you're in me. I know that you're leading
[56:49] me. I'm born of your spirit. You gave
[56:52] yourself for me." Yes, Lord. Amen. Then
[56:56] why am I reacting contrary to your word?
[57:00] Because God's not watching that. You
[57:03] say, "Well, I failed. I fail all the
[57:04] time. Listen, you you're we are flaw. We
[57:07] are flawed people. But God's not judging
[57:10] us by the flaws. He's trying to get you
[57:12] to see that being born of his spirit,
[57:15] you are a new creation. You're not of
[57:16] this old creation. You're a new
[57:18] creation. God's not judging you by the
[57:20] ways of the flesh. He's judge he's taken
[57:22] and put his spirit in you to get you to
[57:26] realize all you need to do is relax and
[57:28] let go and let him do it. Amen. Depend
[57:31] on him. re rest in him. Amen.
[57:36] We don't have to go out seeking how to
[57:38] do good works. Just follow him. He
[57:41] inspires it to be done. Do it. How many
[57:43] know he'll inspire you to do something?
[57:45] You be going along, all of a sudden it's
[57:46] inspired. You You just move it. Do what
[57:49] he said to do. You do your part. He's
[57:51] got to back up his part. Amen.
[57:54] Amen. Is that right? What's your part?
[57:56] Believe what he said. Conduct yourself
[57:59] with joy amidst the trials that he and
[58:01] his wisdom has allowed to come to pass.
[58:05] Well, I don't like my position where I'm
[58:07] at. So, you find fault with it. You're
[58:09] finding fault with God. You're finding
[58:11] fault with his leadership. That's right.
[58:13] Amen.
[58:16] Amen. All
[58:18] right. All right. Because he said when
[58:21] he would appear and he's appeared. He's
[58:23] appeared in the heavens. He had his
[58:25] picture taken. He's appeared. He's
[58:26] uniting. His head has come with the to
[58:28] the body. He's appearing. Where's he
[58:31] appearing? In the bride form. Where is
[58:33] his appearing? It's in you. Here I am I.
[58:36] So relax. Let go. His works you'll do.
[58:39] St. John 14:20 said, "He that believeth
[58:42] in me." Yes. Now I know the scripture
[58:45] said, "On me." The prophet made a
[58:46] correction on that. Said the
[58:47] translators, "It should have been in
[58:49] me."
[58:50] Hello.
[58:52] Amen. Now, so he said, "But he that and
[58:56] brother Ram quotes it that way. He says,
[58:59] now let me let me well, I'll yes, I'll
[59:01] I'll go on with
[59:03] this. In that day, you'll know that I'm
[59:05] in my father, father me, and I in you.
[59:08] You'll know that I am in you."
[59:14] Amen. Well, I don't like the way he made
[59:16] me. He made you the way he wanted you to
[59:18] be. He put qualities in you that I don't
[59:21] have and he put qualities in me that you
[59:23] don't have. And so we must we So the
[59:26] body works together as a unit. Amen.
[59:29] Amen. It's a varied body. You're the
[59:31] body of Christ and members in
[59:32] particular. In particular means you're
[59:34] different.
[59:37] I'm different. I'm speaking to different
[59:39] people tonight. I could be preaching
[59:41] this right here tonight and somebody
[59:42] else preaching the same thing, but
[59:44] preaching it that way for those people
[59:46] there. But we're saying the same thing
[59:47] and we're seeing that happen over and
[59:49] over again in the body. Why? Because
[59:51] it's the mind of God working through his
[59:54] body. How is he displaying himself? He
[59:56] works in and through his bride. Pick up
[59:59] your pen and write. He said he works in
[1:00:02] and through his bride. Amen. What's the
[1:00:06] secret of this? She has his mind. The
[1:00:08] word is in the bride.
[1:00:11] The word is in the bride. Living,
[1:00:13] moving, acting. The the word. The word
[1:00:16] is in the bride and in that word is his
[1:00:18] faith.
[1:00:20] Amen. Where do you find faith? In the
[1:00:22] word.
[1:00:23] Amen. God isn't in his church. God is in
[1:00:26] the word. If the word's in the church,
[1:00:28] God's in the church. Is that right? So,
[1:00:31] the word is in you. The word is leading
[1:00:33] you. Why find fault with how God's
[1:00:36] leading you?
[1:00:38] You say, "Well, I'm just depending on
[1:00:40] Well, then you're depending on somebody
[1:00:42] else. You're not depending on him. He
[1:00:44] asked you to depend on him. Amen. He put
[1:00:48] you there. He put you in a position. He
[1:00:50] He gave you the family year round. He's
[1:00:52] the one that put you in a certain
[1:00:53] church. He's the one that brought you
[1:00:55] there. Why find fault with his leading?
[1:00:57] Right.
[1:01:03] He just said you're his workmanship and
[1:01:05] he ordained that you would do good works
[1:01:07] and walk in it.
[1:01:11] Then can we trust him? Can we believe
[1:01:14] that? Amen. Is there something in you
[1:01:16] that's question or do we really believe
[1:01:19] that? Oh Lord, that's right. You said
[1:01:22] it. He that he he knows he that knows me
[1:01:26] knows my father. So he that knows me
[1:01:29] knows my father. Jesus just said it. In
[1:01:31] that day you'll know that I'm in my
[1:01:33] father and ye in me and I in you. So he
[1:01:36] that's in me knows my
[1:01:38] father. Hello.
[1:01:42] That scripture tells you who you are
[1:01:43] right there. If you're in him, who are
[1:01:46] you? If he's in you, who are you?
[1:01:50] And if he's in you, who's then he's you
[1:01:53] are now his son. What manner of love
[1:01:56] hath the father bestowed upon us that we
[1:01:58] are called in the scripture? He called
[1:02:00] it, he placed it. He gave himself for
[1:02:02] you that you would be the word
[1:02:04] manifested in flesh, the son.
[1:02:08] He made you that way. Yes, he makes no
[1:02:11] faults. He doesn't fail. The Bible says
[1:02:13] in Psalm 139:14 that you're fearfully
[1:02:16] and wonderfully made. Then why don't we
[1:02:18] go back? You can read. I don't have time
[1:02:20] to read it. Read Psalm 139. You were
[1:02:23] substance in his thinking before there
[1:02:24] was any part of you there. You were in
[1:02:26] his thoughts, a substance in his mind.
[1:02:29] You existed right
[1:02:32] there. And you come down here in your
[1:02:34] day to manifest the word of promise for
[1:02:37] this day.
[1:02:38] Then he then look at brother sister.
[1:02:41] This is enough that ought to make you
[1:02:43] just shout for glory. You are his
[1:02:44] workmanship.
[1:02:47] He makes no junk. That's right. He
[1:02:49] doesn't whatever he does is perfect and
[1:02:52] you're his workmanship created. You're
[1:02:54] already created in the beloved. You're
[1:02:56] already accepted then in the beloved.
[1:02:58] You are already under his purpose. You
[1:03:00] are chosen in him. Thank you Lord. Let
[1:03:04] him achieve what he wants to achieve
[1:03:06] through you. Then just follow. Deny
[1:03:09] yourself. Take up your cross. Take up
[1:03:11] the cross. Reckon yourself dead. Well,
[1:03:13] you say I'm very much alive. This Well,
[1:03:15] then reckon it dead. Yes.
[1:03:19] Amen. Reckon it. Other words. Other
[1:03:22] words, you crucified with him. You were
[1:03:24] buried with him. You rose with him. The
[1:03:26] inner man, that inside, the inside is
[1:03:28] his workmanship. He's already created
[1:03:30] you in Christ Jesus. He's already
[1:03:32] received you. You are in his power. He
[1:03:35] gave himself for you that you would his
[1:03:37] life would live through you. That's
[1:03:38] enough right there to relax.
[1:03:42] That's right. That's enough right there
[1:03:44] because St. John 14, watch this. St.
[1:03:47] John 14:12 said, "The works that I do
[1:03:50] shall you do also." He did not say, "The
[1:03:53] works I did do."
[1:03:55] That's good. Yeah. He didn't say that.
[1:03:58] He said, "The works I do." Then where is
[1:04:00] he working? In you. Yeah. The works I do
[1:04:04] shall he that believeth in me, he
[1:04:06] believed in me before the foundation of
[1:04:08] the world. He's a believer.
[1:04:11] Amen. When were you believing in him?
[1:04:14] Did you just become a believer? You
[1:04:16] didn't become seed by the rebirth. You
[1:04:18] always were seed. Amen.
[1:04:22] Then let's relax. Let off the
[1:04:25] pressure. He's made everything perfect
[1:04:28] for you. Can we believe that? Can we
[1:04:31] accept that? Can we see that
[1:04:35] he said
[1:04:37] so? Then will he not do what he said?
[1:04:40] Will he not govern you? Will he not
[1:04:42] direct you? Is he going to make a Is he
[1:04:45] flawed? No, he's not flawed. He's
[1:04:47] flawless. And being in him, we are
[1:04:49] absolutely flawless. I don't care how
[1:04:52] many flaws you have here. This doesn't
[1:04:53] identify who I am. Who I am is the
[1:04:56] created word in me. He's gave himself
[1:04:58] for me. That's his love for you. Will
[1:05:01] not your love go back to him then and be
[1:05:04] and and say Lord my I'm a prisoner of
[1:05:08] your love and I you love me
[1:05:10] unconditionally and my love comes back
[1:05:12] to you unconditionally. No matter what
[1:05:15] state I'm in, I'm there with content
[1:05:17] because my love is not based on
[1:05:19] condition. My love for the Lord Jesus is
[1:05:22] not based on condition. It's based on
[1:05:24] his love for you, his word of promise to
[1:05:27] you. He gave himself for you that you
[1:05:29] would live and he's moving in you
[1:05:31] because he gave himself. It's himself
[1:05:34] that you have. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:39] Hallelujah.
[1:05:40] Amen. See, see. So, he never said he
[1:05:44] never said the works that I He said,
[1:05:46] "The works I do. He that believeth in
[1:05:47] me, the works I do." He didn't say, "The
[1:05:49] works I did
[1:05:51] do, you shall do also." He said, "The
[1:05:54] works I do, shall you do also.
[1:05:58] Amen. Then who's doing the works?
[1:06:02] He is. Because he's already ordained
[1:06:05] that you would walk in good works.
[1:06:08] Then let him let's let him fulfill those
[1:06:12] works. Let's let off the
[1:06:15] pressure. You say, "Well, you just don't
[1:06:17] know how I feel." Get off your feelings.
[1:06:19] Get off your reasoning. trying to push
[1:06:21] your reasoning around and take God at
[1:06:23] his word because he said so and leave it
[1:06:25] alone and let's believe it that way.
[1:06:28] Amen.
[1:06:30] A child won't try to reason with it and
[1:06:32] himhaw about it. Daddy said so and that
[1:06:34] settles it. He will do what he said.
[1:06:42] Hallelujah. I don't mean to scream at
[1:06:44] you. I'm talking like I'm talking to a
[1:06:45] hundred out here.
[1:06:50] You just have to pardon me. That's what
[1:06:51] I am. And I'm not ashamed the way he
[1:06:53] made me. I may be different, but so are
[1:06:55] you. And so am I. We're all different.
[1:06:58] We've been ordained in the body, but
[1:07:00] we're members of the body. Do you
[1:07:01] realize every instrument in the symphony
[1:07:03] is played out by a by a player, by one
[1:07:06] that plays that instrument. You can't
[1:07:08] play your instrument, man. I David can't
[1:07:10] play this instrument. If I try to Well,
[1:07:12] I got to go out. I got to make sure I
[1:07:14] try to find some good works to do.
[1:07:15] forget it.
[1:07:19] You don't have to go out seeking good
[1:07:20] works. Let him perform that in you. And
[1:07:23] right on time and right in season, he'll
[1:07:25] do it. Amen. All right. So, so he said,
[1:07:30] so he said, "The works I do shall you do
[1:07:32] also." All right. Now, he said this 1
[1:07:35] John 3 1-2, I just read it. We see him
[1:07:38] as he as he appearing. He's appearing.
[1:07:40] The seals have been open. The book's
[1:07:42] been open. We are the open book. Then we
[1:07:44] see him. We see him today as he
[1:07:47] positionally has placed us and ordained
[1:07:49] us for to be. What are we looking for
[1:07:51] now? A body change. But this seeing,
[1:07:54] this revelation is taking us to that
[1:07:57] body change because this revelation is
[1:07:59] the rapture in you revealing. It's
[1:08:01] revealed in you. It's substance. Then if
[1:08:04] it's a revelation, the rapture is a
[1:08:06] substance in you. You can't miss that
[1:08:09] substance. You say, "Well, I might miss
[1:08:11] it." Quit your fretting about missing
[1:08:12] anything. If he's ordained and put
[1:08:15] himself in you, you can't miss it. You
[1:08:18] can't miss something you're supposed to
[1:08:19] see.
[1:08:24] Well, I might miss it. Don't let you let
[1:08:26] the devil point that down your throat.
[1:08:27] The Bible never said you might miss it.
[1:08:30] He said you won't miss it.
[1:08:34] It's God which workketh in me both to
[1:08:36] will and to do of his good pleasure. I
[1:08:39] haven't even got to that. Philippians
[1:08:40] 2:13.
[1:08:42] Let me just get to that in just a second
[1:08:44] here. But
[1:08:46] watch. He knows. He that knows me knows
[1:08:48] my father. And and Jesus said, "As the
[1:08:51] father sent me, so send I you."
[1:08:55] So send I you. Amen. Is that right? The
[1:08:59] God that sent Jesus went in Jesus. The
[1:09:03] Jesus that sends
[1:09:04] you is
[1:09:06] where? In you. He goes in you. Amen.
[1:09:11] Now, what greater guide could you have
[1:09:15] then relax where he's got you? Relax and
[1:09:18] realize you are under a divine purpose.
[1:09:20] You are not just sitting there. You're
[1:09:23] not just moving. You are under a divine
[1:09:25] leadership and a divine purpose.
[1:09:31] Amen. Quit complaining and quit
[1:09:34] murmuring about where you are and how
[1:09:36] you feel and let God control you. Amen.
[1:09:39] and do the works that he intended for
[1:09:41] you to walk in. If he intended it, if he
[1:09:44] ordained it, it's got to happen. It's
[1:09:46] got to be. It's got to be right on time
[1:09:48] and in his season. Not in your season,
[1:09:51] not in your thinking, but in his in his
[1:09:54] thinking. In his season, in his time.
[1:09:57] He's not going to miss it. He's not
[1:09:59] going to miss the time.
[1:10:01] You see? See, we're we're if we're not
[1:10:03] careful, we come under the we come under
[1:10:06] an influence. We're coming under
[1:10:08] influences
[1:10:10] and Satan is quick to influence you to
[1:10:12] get you to reason against the word.
[1:10:16] Amen. Be careful of of how or what
[1:10:19] you're what you're coming under the
[1:10:21] influence of. We're under the influence
[1:10:23] of of of something. Let it be the word.
[1:10:28] Let it be the word. I don't care if if
[1:10:30] there's a if there's negative. He said,
[1:10:32] "Don't even receive a negative thought.
[1:10:34] If Satan tries to present you something
[1:10:36] negative about me, cast it out. If he
[1:10:38] puts something negative about you, about
[1:10:40] in my mind concerning you, let it be
[1:10:42] cast out. Don't speak it to anybody and
[1:10:45] go pray for that person. Amen.
[1:10:48] Let's allow God to do the good works.
[1:10:50] Amen. There's only one
[1:10:53] good. That's him. Is that right? Then
[1:10:56] the Bible said the steps of a good man
[1:10:59] are ordered of the Lord. What makes a
[1:11:01] man good is because the Holy Spirit's in
[1:11:03] him leading. Yeah, that's it. There's no
[1:11:06] man that's good. Not in themselves.
[1:11:08] There's no
[1:11:08] man. Amen. There's none. You can't rely
[1:11:12] You can't go back and rely upon your
[1:11:14] reasoning and your feelings and your
[1:11:15] senses and say, "I've got it because I
[1:11:18] feel this." You've got it because the
[1:11:20] word said you do. Then if you'll take it
[1:11:22] that way, God will perform his word
[1:11:24] through you. Amen.
[1:11:29] I don't know how to make it any clearer.
[1:11:31] So I just say relax.
[1:11:35] Amen. And the Jesus that send you goes
[1:11:38] in you. He that believeth in me, the
[1:11:40] works that I do shall he do also.
[1:11:44] Notice he that believeth in me
[1:11:48] the works.
[1:11:52] The works. Who was leading him to do the
[1:11:54] works? Is the same one leading you to do
[1:11:57] the
[1:11:58] works? All right. Because he said, "I
[1:12:00] gave myself for
[1:12:02] them. As the father sent me, so send I
[1:12:05] you." And then he turned around and
[1:12:06] breathed on him and said, "Receive ye
[1:12:08] the same Holy Ghost. I've imparted it. I
[1:12:11] gave my blood for it." And the in that
[1:12:13] blood is the life. Receive
[1:12:16] it. And it will guide. It will lead. It
[1:12:19] will take you into a body change. I'll
[1:12:22] never leave you. I'll never forsake you.
[1:12:24] I will be with you, even in
[1:12:26] you. I don't see how we could get it any
[1:12:28] better than
[1:12:29] that. And how could we have it any
[1:12:32] better knowing that all things work
[1:12:33] together for good?
[1:12:36] Paul said, I quoted this before, but let
[1:12:38] me say it again. Paul said, "No matter
[1:12:40] what state I'm in, what state? No matter
[1:12:42] what state I am in, I therewith am
[1:12:45] content." Yes. Wonder if we can have
[1:12:48] that same contentment.
[1:12:50] Sure we can. Why? Because you're not
[1:12:53] looking at your discontentment. You're
[1:12:55] looking at his contentment. You're
[1:12:57] looking at the promise. You're standing
[1:12:58] on the promise. You have nothing to do
[1:13:00] but give praise to God in all things.
[1:13:04] Give him thanks in all things. Rejoice
[1:13:06] ever more. Rejoice in all things. Well,
[1:13:09] I don't like it because I don't have my
[1:13:11] own way. That's the problem.
[1:13:13] You don't have your own way.
[1:13:16] But God's way is not your way. His ways
[1:13:19] are not your ways. His thoughts are not
[1:13:22] your thoughts.
[1:13:25] Amen. That's exactly right. Well, I
[1:13:27] don't understand why I had to miss this.
[1:13:28] If I should If I would have done this, I
[1:13:30] would have had to do this. I should
[1:13:32] have. I should have. I should have.
[1:13:33] Nonsense. Let go of that spirit. He's
[1:13:36] driving you down in a
[1:13:39] hole. It's not say, "Well, I should
[1:13:41] have. I should have." No. If you were
[1:13:43] should have, you would have. That's
[1:13:44] right. Amen. You say, "Oh, that's
[1:13:47] radical, Brother David. That's radical.
[1:13:49] You better be careful. You're going on
[1:13:50] the radical side. No, I'm not radical.
[1:13:53] God is in leadership. God's directing
[1:13:55] it.
[1:13:57] You may not understand why you made that
[1:13:59] turn, why you said that. But God, if
[1:14:02] it's wrong, he'll correct it. Do you
[1:14:04] have enough under enough reality to know
[1:14:07] that if you do something wrong, he'll
[1:14:08] show you?
[1:14:10] If you say something wrong, will he not
[1:14:12] show you? Is that love expressed to you
[1:14:14] and you know it? Will you not make it
[1:14:16] right as quickly as you can? Brother
[1:14:19] Bram said that is the Holy Ghost working
[1:14:21] in you when you see your wrong and make
[1:14:24] it right.
[1:14:27] Ask forgiveness.
[1:14:29] Forgive. Amen. That's God's nature. He
[1:14:31] will forgive. He always
[1:14:33] forgives. Well, I don't like the way he
[1:14:36] does this and does that. But why don't
[1:14:37] you realize you're different and I'm
[1:14:39] different or they're different? But
[1:14:41] they're in the
[1:14:42] body and they're there for a purpose
[1:14:45] because they they have something you
[1:14:47] lack.
[1:14:49] Amen.
[1:14:51] And I may have some or you may have
[1:14:52] something that I lack, but I may have
[1:14:54] something that you lack.
[1:14:56] Then why don't we just recognize each
[1:14:58] other as being flawed in our bodies, our
[1:15:00] humanness, and let's unite under one
[1:15:03] heart, one accord, one mind under the
[1:15:06] word. That's right. That's where it is
[1:15:09] right there. It's not this church I
[1:15:11] belong to and this church and I don't
[1:15:12] like this church. I don't care what
[1:15:14] church you go to. There's three kinds of
[1:15:16] believers and there's always flaws and
[1:15:17] there's always mistakes and there's
[1:15:19] always failures.
[1:15:22] Oh no, we're the perfect church here.
[1:15:24] Yes. Oh yeah. But the word is perfect
[1:15:26] and the word moving among believers is
[1:15:28] perfect. And if we'll stay with the
[1:15:30] word, your influence will drive others
[1:15:32] to one person, the word.
[1:15:35] That's right.
[1:15:37] Amen.
[1:15:42] Let that be driven home, Lord. All
[1:15:45] right, let's see him as he is. Same
[1:15:48] brother Brandham said invisible union.
[1:15:50] Can you see where we're at? Excuse me.
[1:15:53] Can you see where we are standing?
[1:15:55] Talking about this day. Can't you see?
[1:15:57] Can you see where we are standing? Life
[1:16:00] is in the grain
[1:16:03] again. Life is in the grain
[1:16:11] again. What? What is
[1:16:13] it? Brother said, "Well, life is in the
[1:16:16] grain again." What is it? Same Jesus in
[1:16:19] the bride
[1:16:21] form. We shall see him as he is. Do you
[1:16:26] recognize your day and hour? Do you
[1:16:28] recognize how he said he would come in
[1:16:30] this day
[1:16:32] in the bride form? Did not our prophet
[1:16:35] say that this wave she chief would
[1:16:37] awaken that bride and bring her to a
[1:16:39] maturity because she's the bride coming
[1:16:42] of Christ.
[1:16:44] Did not scripture have to be fulfilled?
[1:16:47] Did that have to come back to that
[1:16:48] seventh
[1:16:51] day?
[1:16:53] Amen. Didn't there have to be a bride
[1:16:55] coming of Christ? She went in the
[1:16:57] ground. She she had to go in the ground
[1:17:00] unless how can she if she don't die, she
[1:17:02] can't come forth again. But God has
[1:17:04] restored a bride the second time. Yeah.
[1:17:07] Amen. Are you with me? It's Christ. The
[1:17:11] son of man is being revealed. Where?
[1:17:12] Where is he? Where is he? He said, "Here
[1:17:15] I am. Here I am. Where is he?" Bride
[1:17:18] form. Amen.
[1:17:22] Amen.
[1:17:24] Amen. You talk about it. I'll tell you
[1:17:26] what the birth I tell you. The birth of
[1:17:27] the word will drive you to this
[1:17:30] revelation will lead you I shouldn't say
[1:17:32] drive lead you to the well brother gee
[1:17:35] brother brother the word said that when
[1:17:37] God when the b when the holy ghost fell
[1:17:39] on
[1:17:39] Jesus he was driven into the
[1:17:44] wilderness driven one place it says he
[1:17:47] led led but another place it said he was
[1:17:49] driven
[1:17:50] there the Holy Spirit drove him into the
[1:17:53] wilderness oh well that can't be God
[1:17:55] wouldn't drive us into the wilderness Oh
[1:17:57] no. Watch out what you say God will do
[1:18:00] and won't do. You've got to realize one
[1:18:02] thing. He's in you, living in you,
[1:18:05] motivating you, leading you, guiding
[1:18:07] you, correcting you, doing everything
[1:18:09] about it. You never had one thing to do
[1:18:11] with it.
[1:18:14] I'm talking about man. You never had in
[1:18:16] your part to do anything with it.
[1:18:20] God saved you because he chose you. He
[1:18:22] elected you. You didn't choose yourself.
[1:18:24] You didn't elect yourself. He elected
[1:18:26] you. He chose you in himself and said,
[1:18:28] "I give myself for you." Everything
[1:18:30] about it is his doing. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:40] You need to just relax. Put it back in
[1:18:43] God's hands. If you don't like it, put
[1:18:45] it in his hands. Quit ftting over it.
[1:18:49] Quit striving over it. I'm talking about
[1:18:53] myself, brother David, brother, sister.
[1:18:55] I'm talking about myself. I'm with you,
[1:18:56] too. I'm not standing up here think,
[1:18:58] "Well, David's perfect." No, David is
[1:19:00] flawed, right? But my Lord in me is
[1:19:04] perfect. I don't rest in David. I'm not
[1:19:07] looking at me and how I feel to
[1:19:09] determine whether I have this or don't
[1:19:11] have it. Amen. It's what his word said I
[1:19:13] have or don't have. Do you understand
[1:19:16] what I'm trying to say? Amen.
[1:19:23] All right.
[1:19:28] Now then we see that's the same Jesus in
[1:19:32] the bride form. We see him. We're seeing
[1:19:34] him. The seals open. We see the book. We
[1:19:37] see the mystery. Your name is the
[1:19:39] mystery in the
[1:19:41] book. I I'm wanting I know why I'm
[1:19:44] falling back on that because that's
[1:19:45] another message. But but that's what it
[1:19:49] is. All right.
[1:19:53] Then see the great Holy Spirit come down
[1:19:56] visible before the people. Even take
[1:19:58] pictures of it. See it working and
[1:20:00] showing it's not a man, not just a
[1:20:01] preacher, not a certain congregation.
[1:20:03] It's the Holy Spirit showing the same
[1:20:05] thing he did when it was embodied in the
[1:20:07] body of Jesus Christ. Now it's embodied
[1:20:10] in the body of his bride.
[1:20:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:21] Philippians
[1:20:22] 2
[1:20:25] um 2:5. Philippians 2:5. You want to go
[1:20:29] there real quick, you can. If you just
[1:20:31] listen to Philippians 2:5, let this mind
[1:20:34] be in
[1:20:35] you. Let we let so many other things.
[1:20:40] Why not? Let the mind be in you. Let his
[1:20:42] mind, his spirit, his faith be in you.
[1:20:46] Let his mind, let this mind be in you
[1:20:49] which was also in Christ Jesus, who
[1:20:51] being in the form of God, that's
[1:20:53] immorph. Who being in the form of God,
[1:20:56] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:20:59] God. All right. So what act is he in
[1:21:02] now? What form is he in now? In this
[1:21:04] act, he's in bride form. Amen. All
[1:21:07] right. You have his mind. You have his
[1:21:09] very thought. You are and have his mind.
[1:21:12] You have his word.
[1:21:14] You have his thought expressed. You are,
[1:21:16] you have the Holy Spirit in you, the
[1:21:18] word made
[1:21:19] spirit. All right?
[1:21:22] So, having the same mind, he just
[1:21:25] changes his mask. All right. Philippians
[1:21:28] 2:13. Now, watch this scripture.
[1:21:31] Philippians
[1:21:33] 2:13 says this, "For it is God." Who is
[1:21:37] it?
[1:21:40] Another person, one of the people of the
[1:21:42] Godhead. No, it is God which workketh in
[1:21:46] you both to will and to do of his good
[1:21:52] pleasure. For it is God which workketh
[1:21:54] in
[1:21:55] you. Can we believe that? Can we accept
[1:21:59] that?
[1:22:02] Hello. You can if you're seed because
[1:22:05] you can't deny
[1:22:08] that it's alive. You can't deny the
[1:22:11] word. You're a part of the word.
[1:22:17] Amen. For it is God which workketh in
[1:22:21] you both to will. Both. Now watch. To
[1:22:25] will and do. Both. To will and to do.
[1:22:30] To
[1:22:31] will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:22:38] You are his workmanship, created in
[1:22:40] Christ Jesus unto good works. For it is
[1:22:42] God which workketh in
[1:22:45] you, both to will and to do, workketh,
[1:22:49] workketh, workketh in you, both to will
[1:22:52] and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:22:58] Then verse 14, do all things without
[1:23:01] murmurings.
[1:23:03] Hello. Hello, brother David. Hello.
[1:23:08] Do all things without murmurings and
[1:23:11] disputing. Disputing about what? His
[1:23:15] leadership. I don't like the situation
[1:23:18] I'm in. But he allowed you to be in that
[1:23:20] situation. He's going to test you. He's
[1:23:22] going to try you. He's going to perfect
[1:23:24] his character in you and through you
[1:23:26] through the trials and testings of this
[1:23:28] life. But you ought to start giving him
[1:23:30] praise because he's allowing it to
[1:23:34] happen. Amen. because he's not doing it
[1:23:38] just without a reason for it. He's not
[1:23:41] an author of frustration. He doesn't
[1:23:43] allow you to go through trials and
[1:23:45] sufferings and tests that be an author
[1:23:47] of frustration. He's got a purpose in
[1:23:50] your life. He's working out for you have
[1:23:52] you are in an eternal purpose. You have
[1:23:55] you are in his purpose. It's his
[1:23:57] working. He's carrying you. He's doing
[1:23:59] and he knows exactly what you need. You
[1:24:01] don't know what you need.
[1:24:04] He knows what you need and said, "I
[1:24:06] shall supply all of your need according
[1:24:09] to my riches and glory." Amen. Amen.
[1:24:13] Amen.
[1:24:16] So, Brother Brandham made this statement
[1:24:19] just reading that scripture. Now, watch
[1:24:20] what he
[1:24:23] says. And I didn't write down where this
[1:24:25] is, I don't think. No, I don't believe I
[1:24:29] did. But this is his statement. And what
[1:24:32] a beautiful thing it is just to lay your
[1:24:35] life in his hands and say, "Here am I,
[1:24:39] Lord." Now watch. He said, "Here am I."
[1:24:42] Your love goes back to him. Said, "Well,
[1:24:44] here am I, Lord."
[1:24:48] Amen. Here you are, then here am I.
[1:24:51] Where you are, I am. And all that I am,
[1:24:53] you are. And all that you are, I am. Do
[1:24:57] you realize that the prophet said that
[1:24:58] in the on the message unveiling of God?
[1:25:00] I wonder if that is unveiled in you.
[1:25:02] That all you are, he is. And all he is,
[1:25:06] you
[1:25:07] are.
[1:25:09] Amen. What's God asking you to do? Let
[1:25:12] off the
[1:25:14] pressure. Relax in my word. Give way to
[1:25:17] me. Quit your complaining. Quit your
[1:25:20] murmuring. Quit saying, "I should have
[1:25:22] done this. I should have done that." And
[1:25:24] let me guide you contrary and radical,
[1:25:27] contrary to your thinking. Yeah.
[1:25:31] Well, that didn't sound very good, did
[1:25:33] it? Is God's ways radical? It is to your
[1:25:36] thinking, your human thinking. Many
[1:25:39] times, it's unusual. But do you know
[1:25:42] him? Do you know that he's perfect? Do
[1:25:45] you know that he can't do anything else
[1:25:47] but make your way perfect? Amen. That's
[1:25:50] what the Bible said. Psalm 18. It said
[1:25:53] his ways are his works and his ways are
[1:25:55] perfect. And then it says, "And he's
[1:25:57] made your way perfect.
[1:26:00] Oh my
[1:26:03] goodness. I I was out the other morning
[1:26:06] walking, praying. I said, "Lord, forgive
[1:26:08] me for finding fault with the way you
[1:26:11] made
[1:26:12] me. Forgive me for complaining about
[1:26:16] your
[1:26:18] leadership because you've ordained that
[1:26:21] I should walk in good works." That has
[1:26:23] to happen. That has to be. I don't
[1:26:27] govern that. You govern that. I'm in you
[1:26:30] and accepted in you and it's you gave
[1:26:32] yourself for me. And now who's living?
[1:26:34] Me? David? No. No. I reckon him dead.
[1:26:38] Yes. Amen. Christ is in me living.
[1:26:41] That's my reality. That's the bride's
[1:26:45] reality. She's united in wed to him. She
[1:26:48] has his name. She goes in his name. She
[1:26:51] She moves in his name. She does
[1:26:53] everything she does in word or deed in
[1:26:56] his name. Amen.
[1:26:58] And if you can't do it in his name, you
[1:27:01] better stop a minute and say, "Wait a
[1:27:03] minute. Why can't I do this? Why can't I
[1:27:05] look at this? Why can't I hear this? Why
[1:27:08] can't I hear this gossip? Why can't I
[1:27:10] hear what this person is finding fault
[1:27:12] with the bride? Why can't I hear them?
[1:27:14] Why am I Why do I have to stop being
[1:27:16] influenced by that person or
[1:27:19] persons?" Because it's the wrong
[1:27:21] influence. They're leading you away. Be
[1:27:24] careful what you're influenced by
[1:27:25] because you're under the influence of
[1:27:27] something. Every one of us. Then what
[1:27:30] are you being
[1:27:32] influenced? Are they influence you to
[1:27:35] more of God, more of Christ, more of his
[1:27:38] word, a greater relationship with
[1:27:40] himself? Or where are they being leading
[1:27:43] you? Where are you
[1:27:45] influenced? Who's influencing you?
[1:27:51] I believe a Holy Spirit directed person
[1:27:54] will have discernment of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:56] to have a question. When that happens,
[1:27:58] there's a question in their heart about
[1:28:00] it. They need to stop and go back to the
[1:28:03] word. The word is your absolute. Not
[1:28:06] yourself, not your mind, not your
[1:28:09] feelings, and not what somebody else
[1:28:11] says about it. The word is your
[1:28:14] absolute. And I've just have been giving
[1:28:16] you the word. So why not relax and let
[1:28:18] the word have its way? The word is your
[1:28:20] absolute the amen and the ultimate in
[1:28:23] everything we do, hear, and say, and
[1:28:25] think, it's the word. Amen. And if God
[1:28:28] said, "I'm leading you. Sons of God are
[1:28:30] led by the spirit of God." That settles
[1:28:32] it. It is God which workketh in me both
[1:28:35] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:28:36] That settles it. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:40] Well, Lord, I don't know now. The
[1:28:42] reasoning, my reasoning says that that
[1:28:43] couldn't be right. You're the same.
[1:28:46] You're listening to the same reasoner
[1:28:48] that Eve listened to. Here, I'll tell
[1:28:51] you why God didn't mean what he said.
[1:28:53] I'll tell you I'll tell you what God
[1:28:54] really meant. You let me reason with you
[1:28:56] a minute.
[1:28:59] Lay down your
[1:29:01] reasoning. Lay down your idea of what
[1:29:04] good works are.
[1:29:06] Your idea. And let God perform it as he
[1:29:10] said he would. He has to do it because
[1:29:12] he's ordained you. You're the his his
[1:29:15] you're his own. I'm speaking to the
[1:29:17] bride tonight. This message doesn't go
[1:29:19] to everyone. This message is to his
[1:29:22] bride. He he's ordained you to walk in
[1:29:25] those good works. He'll see to it that
[1:29:27] it's done. He wants you to relax and
[1:29:29] he'll bring about everything to get you
[1:29:31] to relax. Whatever it takes. Yeah.
[1:29:36] Amen. That's
[1:29:38] right. You know what? If we would in our
[1:29:41] situation we don't like it, we just
[1:29:43] start giving God praise over the matter
[1:29:46] and give him thanks. You know why we
[1:29:48] give him thanks? The Bible said we give
[1:29:50] God thanks in all things because it's
[1:29:51] the will of God concerning us.
[1:29:55] Let's hear that again. Amen.
[1:29:57] We give God thanks in all things because
[1:30:02] whatever you're going through, whatever,
[1:30:04] however you're led, whatever is
[1:30:06] happening, if it's off the word now,
[1:30:08] it's not God doing it. We understand
[1:30:09] that. But he'll show you that.
[1:30:12] But give God thanks in all things
[1:30:14] because it's the will of God concerning
[1:30:16] you. Other words, he's in control.
[1:30:20] And you're going through it because he's
[1:30:22] he's led you to go through it. Jesus was
[1:30:26] led to be tempted of the devil.
[1:30:30] Boy, I don't hear anybody say amen. Am I
[1:30:32] the only one saying amen up here? The
[1:30:35] Bible said he was led Yes.
[1:30:38] in the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:30:40] devil. Why? Because he took every
[1:30:42] temptation to the highest for you and I.
[1:30:45] And he overcome by the word. What are we
[1:30:47] to overcome by? He's teaching us.
[1:30:50] We have and we don't He's not a far off
[1:30:53] and say, "Well, where are you, Lord?
[1:30:54] Where?" He said, "Here I am. I in here.
[1:30:58] I've ordained you to do this. I've
[1:31:01] ordained this walk. Now, if you'll just
[1:31:03] let me take care of it, watch what
[1:31:05] happens.
[1:31:06] Will he not do his part?
[1:31:10] Will he not take care of you? Will he
[1:31:12] not provide? Will he not get you out of
[1:31:14] that? He's just waiting for you to relax
[1:31:17] and say, "Lord, it's in your hands."
[1:31:19] Commit it to him. Watch how fast the
[1:31:23] situation's taken care of. He'll do it
[1:31:25] beyond your reasoning, thinking. You
[1:31:27] say, "Well, the door shut. It can't
[1:31:28] open." Who do you say the door can't
[1:31:30] open or the door can't shut or this
[1:31:33] can't happen? That's good. He's going to
[1:31:35] stone that with a 100 pound
[1:31:36] hailstone. Do you ever seen a 100 pound
[1:31:38] hail stone?
[1:31:41] Oh, that's not reasonable. No. The same
[1:31:44] thing they said to Noah, you're not
[1:31:45] reasonable. Why, Noah, don't you realize
[1:31:47] you're an old man? You might have a
[1:31:49] heart attack working out there like
[1:31:50] that. Do you not realize, Noah, that
[1:31:52] you're just too old to be doing those
[1:31:54] things? But God's leading me to do it.
[1:31:56] God said to do it. What was Noah
[1:31:59] standing
[1:32:00] on? who was directing Noah in those good
[1:32:03] works.
[1:32:06] I don't care how contrary it was even to
[1:32:08] Noah's thinking. Yeah. I don't know how
[1:32:10] I'm going to do this. The Lord said do
[1:32:12] it and the Lord will provide it. All I
[1:32:13] have to do is believe. I do my part,
[1:32:15] he'll take care of the rest of it.
[1:32:19] And we could give example after example
[1:32:20] on that right there. When they did their
[1:32:23] part, God moved on the scene. Amen. You
[1:32:26] speak, you spoke. Now let God work.
[1:32:29] Moses when he was before the Pharaoh, he
[1:32:32] said, "You cast down your rod to Pharaoh
[1:32:34] and it turned to a snake." They cast
[1:32:35] their rod and they turn out snake. Now
[1:32:37] Moses didn't know what else to do. He
[1:32:38] did what God
[1:32:40] said. He did his
[1:32:42] part. Moses just waited. Oh my. It's a
[1:32:47] hard thing to wait
[1:32:49] sometimes. Oh, we got to figure out
[1:32:51] something to do here. I know. I know.
[1:32:53] No, you just wait. Watch God move on the
[1:32:57] scene. swallow up the other snakes. Yes.
[1:33:03] And just apply that to everything,
[1:33:05] right?
[1:33:07] Men were flawed. I mean I mean look at
[1:33:09] David, a murderer. Look at look at the
[1:33:11] different ones. Look at look at here.
[1:33:14] Look at those look at those ministers of
[1:33:16] these church ages. Look at the
[1:33:18] ministers. Look at the prophets back in
[1:33:20] those days. Talk about flawed. Moses
[1:33:23] rebelled. Jonah disobeyed. Samson
[1:33:26] sinned. David murdered,
[1:33:29] but all were and are his.
[1:33:36] Amen. So see, God not God gave himself
[1:33:40] for you and I. Are we willing to receive
[1:33:42] him? No matter how he leads us, are we
[1:33:45] willing to accept what he gave to you?
[1:33:47] He gave himself.
[1:33:51] If you are born of his spirit, you had
[1:33:53] the seed of God in you to be quickened.
[1:33:55] And that new birth is himself in
[1:34:00] you. He gave himself. That's the life in
[1:34:04] you. I think we ought to be sure. If you
[1:34:06] don't know
[1:34:08] that, then he's saying to you tonight,
[1:34:11] he's breathing on them and saying,
[1:34:12] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." Because he
[1:34:15] showed his love to us by giving himself
[1:34:17] for
[1:34:19] us. Amen. Amen. Well, you say, "Brother
[1:34:22] David, I'm sure I do." Then then just
[1:34:25] then just say, "Lord, let me completely
[1:34:28] let go of myself. Let go of my teach me.
[1:34:30] Continue to bring me in." He said, "When
[1:34:33] he the spirit of truth has come, he will
[1:34:35] lead you into all truth." Then let him
[1:34:37] do it his way. Yes. Amen. Let him do it
[1:34:41] the way he wants to do it.
[1:34:46] Let him fulfill his word.
[1:34:48] You don't have to step in and put your
[1:34:50] two cents in it. Just stand with the
[1:34:52] word.
[1:34:53] Watch God move. Commit yourself. Commit
[1:34:55] your way unto God and he would direct
[1:34:57] your own thinking
[1:35:00] even. Amen. Amen. Oh, I know it. But but
[1:35:05] what will others say? It it looks so
[1:35:07] radical to me. Now you're back to
[1:35:09] depending on your thinking over it. You
[1:35:11] see what I'm saying? All right. Now,
[1:35:14] let's I don't even know what time it is.
[1:35:16] Oh, it's about time to quit. All right.
[1:35:18] So, watch what he says. What a beautiful
[1:35:20] thing it is just to lay your life in his
[1:35:22] hands and say, "Here am I,
[1:35:26] Lord. Just use me now. Lead me and guide
[1:35:31] me and direct me in the way that would
[1:35:34] be pleasing unto
[1:35:36] thee." Not you, not pleasing to me,
[1:35:40] pleasing unto him.
[1:35:44] And you realize you cannot please God
[1:35:47] without believing what he said. Without
[1:35:50] faith, it's impossible to please
[1:35:54] God. Oh, if I could just do these works.
[1:35:56] If I could just I'll go out and look.
[1:35:58] I'll go out and I'll try to do some
[1:35:59] works. I'll try, Lord. I'll try to bring
[1:36:01] the works. He never said for you to try.
[1:36:03] You, Brother David, say you've said that
[1:36:05] two or three times. Yes, I have. He's
[1:36:07] driving something home to you.
[1:36:09] He never asked you to go out and do it.
[1:36:11] He said, "Trust me. to do it. I've
[1:36:14] ordained you to walk in
[1:36:22] it. All
[1:36:24] right? He said, "Guide me, lead me,
[1:36:27] direct me in the way would be pleasing
[1:36:28] unto thee." And then and then and then
[1:36:30] he said, "Don't
[1:36:33] murmur. No matter what the path is, stay
[1:36:37] with it
[1:36:38] anyhow." Now, you've just said, "Here am
[1:36:40] I, Lord. I've given myself to you. Shall
[1:36:44] I read it
[1:36:47] again? You lead me. You guide me. You
[1:36:51] direct me in the way that would be
[1:36:52] pleasing unto thee. And then don't
[1:36:53] murmur. No matter what the path is, stay
[1:36:55] with it anyhow. And God will work it all
[1:37:00] right. The footsteps of the righteous is
[1:37:04] ordered by the Lord. And that scripture
[1:37:08] is true. Amen.
[1:37:12] He said he would work in and through the
[1:37:13] bride. He's living in the bride. He's
[1:37:16] working in and through the bride. It's
[1:37:17] just like a symphony. Not only the body,
[1:37:20] you're a body member. And the body
[1:37:23] members are all different. My tongue
[1:37:24] doesn't look like this cell in my end of
[1:37:26] my finger here. But without that cell,
[1:37:29] my my body is not perfect. That's right.
[1:37:33] Amen.
[1:37:34] Without my ear, my ear is not my eye.
[1:37:38] But without my eye, my ear won't work
[1:37:40] properly. That's right.
[1:37:43] Everyone is dependent on the other one.
[1:37:45] We are not serving self. We are serving
[1:37:47] the body. Amen.
[1:37:50] You as a member of the body is serving
[1:37:52] the body.
[1:37:54] Amen. And how you going to serve the
[1:37:56] body? By allowing that seed that God put
[1:37:59] in you to fulfill what it is in you and
[1:38:01] bring forth every fruit he endured you
[1:38:03] to bring.
[1:38:05] That apple tree. How many bushes of
[1:38:08] apples? How many limbs? How many leaves?
[1:38:10] Everything that tree would produce is in
[1:38:11] the seed to begin with.
[1:38:14] Amen. Is that right? Then what about us?
[1:38:17] We were created in Christ Jesus. We the
[1:38:20] everything we are to being seed of God.
[1:38:23] Everything we need to do and will do in
[1:38:25] producing what he called us to do in the
[1:38:27] measure we have will be done
[1:38:31] because it's in the seed.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:36] All right. Now, see, God is a God of
[1:38:40] variety. Sometimes we don't like the
[1:38:41] variety he chooses, but God's a God of
[1:38:43] variety. Now, if it leaves the word, I'm
[1:38:46] not talking about you accepting
[1:38:47] something off of the word. If it leaves
[1:38:49] the word, leave it. Right? Get away from
[1:38:52] it because it's contrary to the word.
[1:38:54] God is the one you serve is the word.
[1:38:57] That's right. All right.
[1:38:59] That's why you need a new birth to
[1:39:01] discern what's right and what's wrong
[1:39:03] because the two spirits are so close
[1:39:05] today. You can't discern the difference
[1:39:07] without the Holy Ghost being in you. The
[1:39:09] one that wrote the word will discern.
[1:39:11] The word is a discerner.
[1:39:13] And the secret is the word. The
[1:39:15] discerner is in the bride.
[1:39:17] That's why she can hear and receive the
[1:39:19] word. All right.
[1:39:21] Now we watch. And a symphony. It's like
[1:39:26] a symphony. You're you're an instrument,
[1:39:29] but you can't play that instrument. This
[1:39:31] mic is mute until something speaks
[1:39:33] through it. Now, watch. We don't believe
[1:39:35] in a trinity. We don't believe in a
[1:39:36] trinity of spirits. So, the composer is
[1:39:39] the director and the director is the one
[1:39:41] that plays the
[1:39:43] instrument. They aren't three separate
[1:39:45] people. Not in this symphony. Our
[1:39:49] composer is the director and the
[1:39:52] director is the one that plays. The Holy
[1:39:55] Spirit plays and uses you and works
[1:39:59] through you and moves through you and
[1:40:01] works in you. He did not fulfill all of
[1:40:03] his works while he was on earth. So now
[1:40:06] he works in and through his bride. She
[1:40:09] knows that. That's what we're speaking
[1:40:11] of today. She knows that. So then relax.
[1:40:14] Let him do
[1:40:15] it. All right. Now, I'm just moving over
[1:40:19] this real quickly because it's time to
[1:40:20] close.
[1:40:25] He is perfect in all his works. We said
[1:40:27] that we see him as he is. Now, there's
[1:40:30] one thing important that we must master.
[1:40:37] One thing that we must master. Listen to
[1:40:40] this. Brother Brown saying this on
[1:40:42] perfect strength and perfect weakness.
[1:40:44] There's one thing we must master.
[1:40:47] whether you're leoty or
[1:40:49] preachers. He said, he said
[1:40:54] this, there's one thing that we've got
[1:40:56] to master if we expect to fulfill God's
[1:40:58] desire, God's desire in our life. That
[1:41:03] is we have to master the thought of
[1:41:05] human ability. Yes.
[1:41:10] Amen. Oh, well, see, that's what always
[1:41:12] gets in the way. I am my ability. Am I I
[1:41:15] have the ability to do this and do
[1:41:18] that. I can make it overdo it good
[1:41:21] because I'm going to do this because
[1:41:22] it's good works. No. Is it if it's not
[1:41:25] him directed?
[1:41:27] Now watch what he said
[1:41:29] here. There's one thing we've got to
[1:41:31] master. We expect to fulfill God's
[1:41:34] desire in our life. That is we have to
[1:41:36] master the thought of human human
[1:41:40] ability. If we ever get to a spot where
[1:41:43] we think that we can do it with our own
[1:41:45] intelligence and with our own abilities,
[1:41:48] we've got to master that in such a way
[1:41:50] that we get rid of the thing and lay it
[1:41:53] aside so that God can use
[1:41:58] us. Amen. Amen. That is right. Amen. His
[1:42:03] thoughts are higher than our thoughts.
[1:42:05] Amen.
[1:42:09] Amen. Amen. And I'm bypassing this now.
[1:42:12] I want to bring out this one last thing
[1:42:13] and I'm
[1:42:24] closing talking about the apples.
[1:42:26] Talking about the apple seed. It's I'm
[1:42:28] just going to apply that to the word
[1:42:29] seed now.
[1:42:33] Okay. No matter
[1:42:35] what we're talking about a bride tree
[1:42:37] here.
[1:42:39] what you have what you have. He
[1:42:42] says when you that seed that's in you
[1:42:46] that's been quickened that's been
[1:42:48] planted other words and then it's been
[1:42:50] watered then you have to water it. And
[1:42:53] as you water it it doesn't do nothing
[1:42:55] but drink. Drink. Drink. So what are we
[1:42:59] to do? Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink what?
[1:43:07] All right. Drink. Drink. Drink. It has
[1:43:09] to drink more than its portion. And the
[1:43:12] more it drinks, the bigger it swells. It
[1:43:14] just pushes out limbs. What's the word
[1:43:17] going to push out? It pushes out leaves,
[1:43:20] pushes out blossoms. It pushes out
[1:43:22] apples. Is that right? And that's the
[1:43:24] way a Christian is. We are planted
[1:43:27] together in Christ Jesus, who is the
[1:43:29] inexhaustible fountain of life. We're
[1:43:32] planted in Christ and we just drink and
[1:43:35] drink and drink and push out
[1:43:42] and push out and everything we have need
[1:43:44] of for the earthly journey. Everything
[1:43:48] we have need of in this earthly journey,
[1:43:50] whether it's divine healing, power of
[1:43:52] God, all these other things is in is in
[1:43:56] in every individual here that's received
[1:43:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. In other
[1:44:00] words, you're born again for you're
[1:44:02] planted in Christ. Hallelujah. You're
[1:44:06] planted in Christ. Hallelujah. The Holy
[1:44:09] Ghost baptism. Yes, sir. And everything
[1:44:12] you have need of for this life's
[1:44:14] journey. Everything you have need of for
[1:44:16] this life journey is in you. Even the
[1:44:19] rapture is right in you then. Amen.
[1:44:25] Amen. All right. Even the rapture is
[1:44:28] right in you then. Don't. He said,
[1:44:30] "Don't resent that.
[1:44:32] That's the truth. The rapture is in us
[1:44:35] now. I will prove it by the
[1:44:38] gospel." He said, "Those who he called,"
[1:44:42] anyone called? He justified. And those
[1:44:45] that he
[1:44:46] justified, he hath
[1:44:53] glorified. I'll read it again.
[1:44:56] He that's justified is declared
[1:44:59] righteous. And who he has declared
[1:45:01] righteous?
[1:45:04] Amen. Who's declaring you
[1:45:07] righteous? Well, it certainly isn't by
[1:45:09] human works.
[1:45:13] It's the new birth, the seed in you. God
[1:45:16] sees that. He's identified you as being
[1:45:18] righteous. He's identified you in him.
[1:45:20] He's identified he's in control. He's
[1:45:23] identified that he chose you. He's
[1:45:24] identified that you're in the rapture.
[1:45:26] He's identified you as himself. Amen.
[1:45:34] So relax.
[1:45:38] You say, "But you don't know what I have
[1:45:40] to go through." Forget what you have to
[1:45:42] go through. Commit it to the Lord and
[1:45:43] say, "Lord, here I am. You know what I
[1:45:45] need. You know the direction I need to
[1:45:46] take, how I need to take it. I commit it
[1:45:49] to you and leave it in his word
[1:45:53] and he'll show you. He'll inspire you.
[1:45:56] He'll reveal the word to you as you need
[1:45:58] it. Maybe driving down the road when you
[1:46:00] least expect it
[1:46:03] when you're when you're not thinking of
[1:46:05] yourself. And but remember, brother
[1:46:06] Brown said this, if we would have our
[1:46:08] minds more on him,
[1:46:11] allow our m have our minds more on him
[1:46:13] every day, he said he would draw near.
[1:46:15] If you draw nigh to him, he'll draw nigh
[1:46:17] to
[1:46:18] you. But we got our minds on all kinds
[1:46:21] of other things. Internet, this and
[1:46:23] that, and something else that he wants
[1:46:26] to reveal himself to you, but you're
[1:46:28] letting these other things stop
[1:46:31] it. Amen. Satan is busy. He's busy and
[1:46:34] he's keeping you busy. He's keeping you
[1:46:37] away from the
[1:46:40] truth. Amen. Now, I'll just leave that
[1:46:44] where it is. Let's even the rapture.
[1:46:46] Hallelujah. Who is justified, he hath
[1:46:49] past tense glorified. Hallelujah. Then
[1:46:52] in heaven today, we are glor we are
[1:46:54] glorified in the presence of God right
[1:47:00] now. Watch what he says. I'm just
[1:47:02] pushing out to
[1:47:05] it. I'm just pushing out to it. How am I
[1:47:09] pushing
[1:47:10] out? Drinking. Drinking. feeding.
[1:47:15] Draw nigh to him. Let your thoughts be
[1:47:17] on
[1:47:18] him. Satan rises up. Take the word. It's
[1:47:21] written. Don't Don't give him your
[1:47:24] reasoning. Don't try to reason with him.
[1:47:27] He's a master reasoner and he'll reason.
[1:47:30] You can't outreason him. Amen. But you
[1:47:33] take that word and he can't break
[1:47:34] through that word
[1:47:36] because why? The word created him.
[1:47:41] Amen. He has to obey the creator. That's
[1:47:44] right. He doesn't want you to believe
[1:47:45] that. But we do believe it. Yes. All
[1:47:48] right.
[1:47:50] Okay. I'm pushing out to it. Amen. Glory
[1:47:53] said God is in his word. You believe it.
[1:47:56] All right. Philippians 2. I'm closing.
[1:47:59] Philippians
[1:48:09] 2:21. I'm sorry. Sorry, it's 3:21.
[1:48:11] Excuse
[1:48:14] me. 3:20. For our conversation is in
[1:48:17] heaven at conversations not only your
[1:48:20] speaking in your but manner of your a
[1:48:22] manner of life behavior is in heaven
[1:48:25] from whence also we look for the savior
[1:48:28] the lord Jesus Christ who shall change
[1:48:31] our vile body. See pushing out to it.
[1:48:33] who shall change our vile body, that it
[1:48:36] may be fashioned like unto his glorious
[1:48:39] body, according to the working to the
[1:48:42] working whereby he is able even to
[1:48:46] subdue all things unto
[1:48:50] himself. Amen. There you are. Who's
[1:48:53] working? Right? Whose working is it?
[1:48:56] Who's working in you? Whose works is
[1:48:59] it? It is he that workketh in you.
[1:49:04] Let's rest in that, brother, sister.
[1:49:06] Let's rest in that. Amen. Amen. I I
[1:49:10] could go on more, but I'm going to stop.
[1:49:13] For we are his workmanship. Watch how
[1:49:15] the prophet says it, quoting that
[1:49:17] scripture, created in union with Christ
[1:49:20] Jesus unto good
[1:49:23] works. Now, Romans 9:21 said what?
[1:49:27] Refers to this. He made you. You're his
[1:49:30] workmanship. Just as the power potter
[1:49:32] has power over the clay, he did not make
[1:49:36] you a vessel of dishonor, bride. He's
[1:49:39] made you a vessel of honor.
[1:49:42] Amen. Because he said, "You're his
[1:49:44] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, a
[1:49:47] vessel of
[1:49:49] honor unto good works which he hath
[1:49:52] before ordained that you should walk in
[1:49:54] it." You're not a vessel of
[1:49:56] dishonor, but the power, the potter has
[1:49:58] power over the clay to make one thus and
[1:50:02] another thus. So what has he made you?
[1:50:05] The Bible just said what he made you.
[1:50:08] His workmanship.
[1:50:10] He made you himself. He created you,
[1:50:13] chose you in himself. You are himself.
[1:50:16] He can't marry nothing but himself.
[1:50:21] Amen. What a position. What a place to
[1:50:24] stand. That's your stand, brother,
[1:50:26] sister. Your stand, your position is
[1:50:29] Christ. The God's great revelation is
[1:50:31] Christ in you.
[1:50:35] All right. The potter now watch because
[1:50:38] the body, he works in and through his
[1:50:39] body because life is in you coming
[1:50:42] through the body. That's the ministry
[1:50:45] that God has today. One the member to
[1:50:48] another member to another member to
[1:50:50] others. Amen. life being on display,
[1:50:55] token on
[1:50:56] display. That could not happen till
[1:50:59] after the opening of the seals because
[1:51:00] the token is a literal life of Jesus
[1:51:03] Christ on display. And because you are
[1:51:06] his body, you're the fullness of
[1:51:08] him that fillth all. Who's the all?
[1:51:12] Every member who fillth all and in
[1:51:18] all. Who's in all? He is. He's in every
[1:51:22] member working. I don't care what you
[1:51:26] can just relax and let off the pressure.
[1:51:29] He made you to have a certain demeanor.
[1:51:31] He made you a certain way. He made you
[1:51:33] to be loud. He made you to be soft. He
[1:51:35] made you to be big. He made you skinny
[1:51:37] like me. He made you all kinds of
[1:51:39] things, but he made you. Quit finding
[1:51:43] faults how he made you. And say, "Lord,
[1:51:46] I'm in your hands. Let me keep drinking
[1:51:49] from the fountain, the inexhaustible
[1:51:51] fountain of the opened word in our day
[1:51:54] and hour. Amen.
[1:52:03] Amen. Praise the
[1:52:06] Lord. 1 Thessalonians 5:24. As I said,
[1:52:09] I'm closing 5:24. If you'll turn with me
[1:52:11] this first Thessalonians
[1:52:19] 5:24, faithful is
[1:52:23] he. Faithful is he that calleth you, who
[1:52:29] also will do
[1:52:32] it. Faithful is he that calleth you, who
[1:52:36] also will do it.
[1:52:41] All right. Philippians
[1:52:50] 1:6. He that is being confident of this
[1:52:53] very thing, that he which hath begun a
[1:52:56] good
[1:52:58] work in you will perform it until the
[1:53:03] day of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:07] Psalms
[1:53:14] 1388 says this, "The Lord will perfect
[1:53:18] 138." And I'm reading just a portion
[1:53:21] 138a. I just want to bring this portion
[1:53:23] out. The Lord will perfect that which
[1:53:26] concernth
[1:53:29] me. Amen. Amen. Do you love him?
[1:53:33] Amen. May Lord make us your
[1:53:38] prisoner that you work through us in his
[1:53:42] perfect your work. Amen. Let us realize
[1:53:45] that. Let's stand together. God bless
[1:53:47] you tonight. Sorry I went a little
[1:53:49] overtime in man's overtime. I believe
[1:53:52] God wanted what he wanted said done.
[1:53:54] That's all. Amen. Maybe I left some
[1:53:57] things out. I probably will go home now
[1:53:59] and see, oh, I left that out. I left
[1:54:00] this out. But that's all right. Doesn't
[1:54:03] matter what he left out. He wanted this.
[1:54:07] I either have to rest in that and
[1:54:09] believe that or I'm gonna I'm just going
[1:54:11] to fret and fret. And the Bible said
[1:54:13] fret not. That's right. Be anxious for
[1:54:16] nothing. Is that right? Anxious.
[1:54:21] Fearful. Anxious. Tore up. Amen.
[1:54:25] Careful. Being careful means
[1:54:29] anxious. Don't be anxious about
[1:54:31] tomorrow. Don't be anxious about the
[1:54:33] next moment. What you need to do at the
[1:54:36] moment, he'll show you. He'll order it.
[1:54:39] He'll direct it. Did not he promise
[1:54:44] it? Then believe his promise. Take him
[1:54:47] at his word. Believe his promise. Any
[1:54:50] believers here that believe his promise?
[1:54:53] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. That's
[1:54:57] right. Amen. Well, I'll just stop
[1:55:01] looking for other things to say and
[1:55:03] start
[1:55:05] singing. I have a father. Do you have a
[1:55:08] father? Do you know you have a
[1:55:12] father? Will not he direct and guide you
[1:55:15] and keep
[1:55:17] you? Who was it that made that that
[1:55:21] young man that was the prodigal son? The
[1:55:24] Bible said he came to himself.
[1:55:28] who did
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:31] that? He came to himself. He realized, I
[1:55:35] have a father. That's what he That's
[1:55:37] what he said. I have a
[1:55:39] father. Wouldn't it be good to see
[1:55:41] everybody wake up and realize they have
[1:55:43] a father
[1:55:46] that's leading, that's feeding
[1:55:49] us, that's ordained the good works that
[1:55:51] we should walk
[1:55:52] in, that's provided everything we have
[1:55:55] need of in this journey, even to where
[1:55:57] we live, where we go to church,
[1:55:59] everything. Brother, sister, it's not
[1:56:01] about this church and that church. This
[1:56:03] is an individual affair between the
[1:56:05] bride and himself.
[1:56:11] Let's let go and let him have his way.
[1:56:14] Amen. I have a
[1:56:16] father. I have a
[1:56:19] father. No. Maker. Wait a minute. Is
[1:56:23] there a first verse? Is that first
[1:56:25] verse? Okay, that's the second verse.
[1:56:27] So, we'll start with the second verse
[1:56:28] and then go to the first one. All right.
[1:56:31] I have a father.
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:37] He calls me his
[1:56:40] [Music]
[1:56:43] own and he'll
[1:56:45] never leave
[1:56:48] me no matter where I go. Isn't that a
[1:56:53] wonderful thought knowing it? He knows
[1:56:58] my name.
[1:57:02] He knows my every
[1:57:07] thought. He sees each tear that
[1:57:12] falls and hears me when I
[1:57:18] call.
[1:57:21] Well, I have a maker.
[1:57:28] He formed my
[1:57:31] heart. Amen. He's your creator. And
[1:57:35] before even time
[1:57:38] began my life, I was existing in his
[1:57:42] thought of himself.
[1:57:45] Amen. He knows my
[1:57:48] [Music]
[1:57:51] name. He knows my every thought. Amen.
[1:57:58] He sees each tear that
[1:58:01] falls and hears me when I
[1:58:07] call. Hallelujah. Do you believe that? I
[1:58:11] have a
[1:58:12] father. Who's your
[1:58:14] father?
[1:58:16] Amen. My father owns a cattle on a
[1:58:19] thousand hills. My father said he would
[1:58:22] never leave me nor forsake me. My father
[1:58:25] is my shepherd.
[1:58:27] My father said, "I'll meet your need."
[1:58:30] My father said, "I'll
[1:58:32] provide." My father said, "I've ordained
[1:58:36] the works you do to walk in
[1:58:38] them." Oh, brother, sister, let's
[1:58:43] relax and let
[1:58:46] go.
[1:58:48] Amen. Amen. And have his way. Amen.
[1:58:51] Let's sing this song. Have thine own
[1:58:54] way, Lord.
[1:58:55] [Music]
[1:58:57] Have thine own
[1:59:01] way. Have thine own
[1:59:05] way, Lord. Let's sing the hymn this
[1:59:08] morning, this evening. Have thine own.
[1:59:12] Not my way, your way,
[1:59:14] [Music]
[1:59:16] Lord. Thou art the potter.
[1:59:24] I am the
[1:59:28] clay. Mold me and
[1:59:33] make
[1:59:36] me after thy
[1:59:43] will while I am waiting.
[1:59:51] build it and
[1:59:54] still. Let's sing that
[1:59:57] again. Have thine old way. Yes, Lord. My
[2:00:03] hands are
[2:00:04] raised. Have thine. I don't want my way.
[2:00:09] My way won't lead me in the right way.
[2:00:12] Thou art the
[2:00:17] potter. I'm in your hands.
[2:00:21] the clay.
[2:00:26] Hold me and
[2:00:30] make
[2:00:33] me after thy
[2:00:39] will. While I am
[2:00:46] waiting,
[2:00:48] yielded and
[2:00:50] still. When's the last time you got
[2:00:54] still before him?
[2:00:56] When's the last time that you just
[2:00:59] stopped and got still before
[2:01:02] him and you prayed until you could
[2:01:04] you've entered into his very
[2:01:07] presence? When's the last time you
[2:01:10] waited on him?
[2:01:15] And
[2:01:17] Lord, let you said the Bible said you
[2:01:20] said let patience have her perfect work
[2:01:22] that you may be perfect and entire
[2:01:25] wanting
[2:01:27] nothing. God help us. We don't want our
[2:01:31] way. We want your way.
[2:01:32] [Music]
[2:01:34] Lord, you
[2:01:36] direct. You guide us. You ordained that
[2:01:39] we would do good works. And these works
[2:01:43] are not our works. They're your works.
[2:01:45] are not the works of man. They're the
[2:01:47] works they're your works that you for
[2:01:49] ordained through this measure to
[2:01:53] work. So you guide us. You lead
[2:01:56] us. It may not be the way this others
[2:01:59] led, but you're leading me this
[2:02:03] way. And you don't have me by chance
[2:02:05] where I'm
[2:02:07] at. You have me there for a purpose.
[2:02:11] your
[2:02:13] purpose to do good works to do and to
[2:02:16] manifest you to others. Live for others.
[2:02:19] Eternal life is not living for myself,
[2:02:21] Lord. It's living for
[2:02:25] others. Grant this now we pray. Let us
[2:02:28] be your
[2:02:29] prisoners. In Jesus' name we ask this
[2:02:33] and we say
[2:02:35] amen. Amen. Let's sing one more song
[2:02:38] before we go here. Let go and let
[2:02:42] God have his wonderful way. Amen. What
[2:02:47] are you letting go of
[2:02:50] yourself? What did Brother Brown do? He
[2:02:52] said, "When I
[2:02:54] come, what do you what did he do?" He
[2:02:56] waited on God. He waited on the Lord. He
[2:02:58] said, "Now what I have to do is relax
[2:03:03] myself and just move myself out of the
[2:03:05] way." I was going to bring
[2:03:08] that and I I think I just forgot it. I
[2:03:11] may have it. I don't know.
[2:03:15] But you can go and look it up. Look up
[2:03:18] the word relax. The
[2:03:21] definition. Amen. It's getting out of
[2:03:24] your own thing, out of yourself. Laying
[2:03:27] yourself
[2:03:27] aside.
[2:03:29] Relax. Amen. Amen.
[2:03:33] Let's drop that down a little bit. Can
[2:03:36] you drop it a little bit more or
[2:03:38] not? Let
[2:03:40] go and let God have his
[2:03:45] [Music]
[2:03:47] wonderful
[2:03:49] way. Let
[2:03:51] go and let God have his way.
[2:04:00] Your
[2:04:02] sorrow will
[2:04:05] vanish. Your night
[2:04:08] turn
[2:04:10] today. Let
[2:04:12] go and let God have his Let's go out of
[2:04:18] here determined. Lord, I'm determined to
[2:04:21] let you have your way.
[2:04:23] Go. I have a choice. I can have my way
[2:04:27] or your way.
[2:04:30] full
[2:04:31] weight. Let
[2:04:34] go and let God have his
[2:04:39] [Music]
[2:04:41] way. Your
[2:04:44] sorrow will then why you've given it to
[2:04:48] God. Your night
[2:04:50] turn today.
[2:04:53] let
[2:04:54] go and let God have his
[2:05:00] way. Amen. God bless you. Let's be in
[2:05:03] the prayer for the meeting on
[2:05:06] Sunday. Don't know for sure if Brother
[2:05:08] Glover will be here, but regardless if
[2:05:10] he's here or our pastor speaks, whatever
[2:05:13] it may be, you come expecting and expect
[2:05:16] God to speak to you. Amen. And he will.
[2:05:20] Remember, you're led by him. You're
[2:05:22] guided by him. So relax. God bless you.
