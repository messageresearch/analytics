don't know Scrabble as some of the family went to Arizona yes so you are left we will definitely be praying for you so for each one a lot of sickness in our midst I say this jokingly but it might have been a good weekend for us to be away whatever has passed through the church amen hallelujah I just have a couple things I want to share a bible study this coming Sunday at 5 00 pm and then we'll close with a time of prayer so just pray that all those that are able to come uh we will post that on WhatsApp um brother Gideon's memorial service his homecoming services this Sunday so please pray for the family there always seems to be a finality that comes when you have a memorial service and it's uh it's been just a shock for the not just their church but a whole a whole community of believers that has lost a brother a mentor an encouragement to the body of Christ and then on top of that if you would just please remember the family and the church of brother George Martin there in Pretoria South Africa which is just literally a few miles down the road uh brother George has passed away just stunning so please remember those amen another group of believers that is just shocked brother George was getting up in years a little bit but I just listened to him preach just a few days ago and sure seemed like he had a lot of life in him and uh so it would be a shock to them I want to speak to you on our journey once again tonight and amen just caught up thank you amen I sure appreciate brother Alex it's beautiful song service and uh sister vika sister Donna I'm just playing very lovely look as the Lord would tarry for many years of enjoying their uh commitment their talent that God has given them amen that they give to the church here I want to speak to you today on our road to Nineveh and I think Saints you know as we take this uh these thoughts these titles here uh I'm putting each one of us as you have noticed in these in these Wednesday Services because truly it wasn't just something that happened and that was a Biblical event we're literally experiencing the same things in the day that we live in we're we're experiencing the Bible coming alive Satan certainly would be here to Buffet us and try and spread his message but God is alive and well in his church amen which means he's alive and well in you and I and we get to look at these things and realize of what we're seeing by brother and sister and I have to say that because we are human that we have different views that we approach from but in the last few weeks before his passing brother Gideon was preaching on Ground Zero Jerusalem and in that he was taking the things that he absorbed the things that he saw and then looking back in the word of God and and uh it was it was just a very encouraging very insightful uh that he was bringing out of that and I think we can say that uh you look at Israel you look at Jerusalem and you have a different perspective it changes your outlook and so we just want you know not to drive a stake down as I've been to Israel but we do want our perspective our eyes to the word to be opened we want our hearts to be changed we want to be able to to look at the word and appreciate it and see it in the fashion that God ordained for us to receive the word in this day 2023 and so I just want to speak to you tonight on our road to Nineveh and uh as we would turn into the Book of Jonah the first chapter we're going to try to limit this to the first eight verses plus a little bit out of the second chapter uh tonight just to uh not to try and make you eat the whole Smorgasbord tonight the whole Buffet but just to just to take a little portion of this that we can go away remembering what it is that we have looked at and recognize it and apply it in our own lives now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Mitte saying arise and go to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarsus anybody ever done that my oh my yeah the Lord speaks and the first thought is it's a run to flee into tarshish from the presence of the Lord and went down into Jabba and he found a ship going to Tarsus and so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the Lord but the Lord sent out a great wind unto the sea my brother and sister this is the same God that put breath in you and I the same God that parted the Red Sea Jonah should have known better but how often we should have known better um my the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty Tempest in the sea the so that the ship was like to be broken then the Mariners were afraid and cried every man into his God and cast forth the Wares that were in the ship and to the sea to lighten it of them but Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep so the ship master came to him and said unto him what meaneth thou o sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God would think upon us that we perish not my oh my and they said everyone to his fellow come we've got a glitch in here we have a glitch let's just go back right here the shipmaster came to him said what meanest thou asleep or arise call upon thy God if so that be God would think upon us and we perish not and they said everyone to his fellow come let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us so they cast lots and the lot fell upon Jonah then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose cause this evil is upon us what is thine occupation whence cometh thou what is thy country of what people art thou you see they were grasping at straws there's got to be a reason they recognize that but we don't have a clue not one single thought come down there's somebody in our midst that's running from God never entered their thoughts they've already prayed to their gods you think they got an answer no their gods are mute it reminds me of what we visited caesaree felipei all of the carvings in the rock all of the little temples it's there they say that's this spot and it makes sense to me that Jesus spoke to Peter we have all these little temples on the rocks in the cliffs here carved into the Rock the very Headwater the I'm brain dead Jordan River I'm stuck on Galilee and I'm just like that's not the Galilee River the very headwaters of the Jordan River come from this place and all of these carvings and all these little temples and Jesus says to Peter who do you say I am God brings it to a point my brother and sister that all the gods of this world all the gods of laodicea and God's asking us who do you say I am Heavenly Father we just ask you to come tonight speak to us father let us take something away tonight that would just remind us and strengthen us Lord stir up our hearts father just to take a whole to the word each day Lord we were not called to a spirit of compromise we were not called father to Lord take a watered-down message father you called us to the truth and father truth Lord can only be called truth if it's in it's pure form we ask for your word father and it's Purity we ask you to speak in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I almost brought the card out with me the church got a card in the mail that would give us for just a small fee to bring some people from the church to a another local church to attend a conference that would teach us how to pack our church out on Easter I thought my what is the world my brother and sister they believe it's just the amount of people they just believe it's it's filling every Pew it's just putting seats people in the seats they they have this idea and they have all kinds of of strategy to keep the people afterwards to bring them into the community of your church and my brother and sister it just struck me as ironic that it come out of the mail today and and I would have that because here we are looking into these scriptures that are dealing with being in the will of God and my brother and sister we see the scripture how it declares to us that we're now living in a day that everyone says that they are serving God and they have a purpose behind them the prophet of God said they're very sincere and we realize that but it's not about just being sincere and it's not about filling up the church but it is about being in the will of God and so it doesn't matter the numbers that there are it doesn't matter my brother and sister what kind of a presentation we have to the world but it is about being in the will of God and we see here now that uh Jonah is there and God speaks to him and he finds himself in a position now we don't have a lot of back history on Jonah to understand the circumstances of his life and what it was maybe he had some complex or there'd been some time that he felt like he had failed God we do not know but what we do see is that there is not a single hesitation In Jonah to flee from the perfect will of God he he gets right up out of his chair or out of his house or whatever it might have been and just fled from the will of God now my brother and sister we recognize this is our actually a more common occurrence than than we would like to admit sometimes God deals with us and it just doesn't seem to fit our current plan it doesn't fit our current resume as it were and but you know I say that God is working and the reason this thought struck my heart so much to bring it to our day how many times and I won't even toss it out at you but how many times I myself have turned from the perfect will of God I I know that I'm not making the right decision but it's an easy decision it's a convenient decision and things that lead us to make decisions like that oftentimes come you know that maybe we see ourselves as unworthy but my brother and sister when God called us whether we have an office in the body or we're just uh you know here as Believers my brother and sister God never called us to say hey when you become Worthy he is the only one that is worthy and the only one that will ever be worthy and so we look at this and realize when God asks us to do something speaks to us leads us to something we don't want to stop and say well I'm unworthy neither do we want to stop and say I am unable to do this because through Jesus Christ we are more than able and so as we look at this sometimes in their situations and I think that if you would tonight you would agree with me that sometimes we are unable but mostly it's because we're unwilling there is no no uh uh a push in our heart no push to step out into the promise of God and and just claim it amen you know uh the little story The Prophet tells about the little boy and the plank and winning a bicycle now my brother and sister there'd be a lot of things that you could use to to say you know what I'm not a very good bicycle Rider I've never tried to ride a plank before I've never this I've never that but really when it comes down to there was no penalty for trying and failing you follow me no penalty no penalty at all for trying and failing often times we come to a point where unwilling because we are actually afraid to fail and so we do nothing but we'll see as that little boy was he gone on that bicycle and he looked to the end which was a strategy different than the rest of them and I say my brother and sister the strategy that God has given to the bride of Christ to finish this race that we are in is to look to the end and not look to our circumstance so we look at this and see whether these things how they come about in his life and we look and conceive in here in the word that Jonah just simply gets up and flees he he runs away but somewhere along the line he has a plan you might say and he gets up and he doesn't just go wander Into the Wilderness but he is there and coming and he has a plan and and says you know what I know the shipping schedule I know what ships go to Tarsus and I know what ships go to Nineveh and I'm going to run up here and I'm going to get on a ship that's going to go where I feel comfortable how many times have we you know we hear that in the world today you know of my comfort zone well my brother and sister I don't believe any Christian could come in his flesh now let me speak of this just from the flesh position no Christian that I know of could say I'm in my comfort zone step over into the spirit realm and suddenly we are comfortable but in the flesh it is all uncomfortable the supernatural the prophet of God tells us that that men fear the presence of God and and rightfully so because he is a righteous God a holy God but my brother and sister the word of God also shows us that we've been called to live in that presence in that atmosphere and so we should not lose the fear as in reverence but we should not be in such a position that we are thinking more in the carnal afraid to approach Our God he is our God there is a a measure of possession in him claiming us and a measure of possession in US claiming him and so it's not a stranger we're approaching but it's our God Amen so it's there that we recognize that God has given a claim on us and given us the right to make the claim back on him so as we look at this now you know as he's no wandering he just simply gets up and he flees he's going somewhere I can assure you I know all about this I did it as a Young Man knowing that I really shouldn't run but I ran anyhow and when you get in the habit of running it's hard to stop now God wants us my brother and sister not to forget how to run you know that so the Running part is how Satan would anoint us God would anoint us because you see the scripture teaches us shows us that we should run this race amen so he wants us to have the ability to run and Satan comes in and perverts that ability to run and gets us turned around it might be an offense and a misunderstanding it might be something we've done or said and we just turn and we start to run but we're running the wrong direction and so God doesn't want to take your running away from you he wants to just turn you around get you pointed in the right direction that we can run this race Amen to finish it amen and so God looks I don't want to get sidetracked there there's a whole thought that ties with that but so it's there that we come to a place you know in the world my brother and sister there's a all kinds of songs from days gone by about gonna do it my way my brother and sister there is just no provision in a Christian to do it his way God never made a provision for us to do it our way but we are to do it his way and every time we do it his way he makes the way before us the scripture said he makes the rocky ground smooth laughs he makes that way before us I say Lord help me I want to walk amen I want to walk in a way that is pleasing to God I want to walk in the way that he has laid out before me Can someone say yes Lord amen because if we don't we'll find ourselves my brother and sister now it makes for great music it makes for great testimonies then oh I come the hardest way and I ran and this and that and God still called me back that's wonderful I have a little bit of that testimony my own self but much more the testimony that I listened to the word of God I look to the word and I followed it he illuminated my way before me he made the path smooth before me there's nothing to be ashamed of in this day that God has come and made that way before us but people seem to Glory and the fact of how bad I was and this and that or whatever my brother and sister there's nothing to glory in in that position but we'll look and see how God can use this in such a fashion uh here if I'll just get moving along amen and so the you know to do it my way you know they talk about how dangerous certain things are you know uh the most dangerous roads the most dangerous mountains the most dangerous this but I tell you the most dangerous Journey that we have is to be walking outside of the will of God that is the most dangerous Journey amen because we have a perfect road map today if we'll just simply follow it you know isn't it interesting my brother and sister that in the day that we live in people uh face certain uncertainties and in that well they they allow themselves to be consumed by the uncertainties and not of the certainties but this is why God come and Vindicated his word to this day in the heart of his believer so that we can eliminate the uncertainty that Satan is constantly bombarding us and putting in our heart now my brother and sister if Jonah had not had an uncertainty he would not have run from God but he had an uncertainty of his position and so it was in that uncertainty that he said you know if I'm not there I won't have to do that I won't have to face that but it's there that God comes brings a perfect word with a perfect plan to imperfect humans now those of you that are perfect please stand up I better find a chair but you see God's got a perfect plan but the problem is As we judge the plan by our imperfect self are in perfect thinking our imperfect life is how we judge the plan of God and what God's will is and Satan loves that because he's a major at uh Illuminating the imperfection amen you know if you ever go to a real honest Diamond dealer you know diamonds with flaws my brother and sister are not considered garbage Friday many a woman is walking around today with a beautiful diamond on her finger and that diamond would have what you might call a major flaw but if you're looking at that diamond my brother and sister are you looking to find the flaw or are you looking at the wonderful Beauty of what the light does and the creation of that see the world has it that we sell Flawless diamonds but that's really not true because there's nothing on Earth that is flawless hmm a Bugatti cars that cost millions of dollars still have recalls the fact that they cost Millions is a value that man placed upon that car its Rarity but that cannot make that car perfect so God says I didn't even try to make you in the flesh a perfect human but yet Satan comes and anoints Sons and Daughters of God real Christians to uh question their life question the things around them because they are not achieving perfection so we look at this imperfect humans now let's look at this without even looking into a theoretical concept we would know better but as you would take it my brother and sister even in time God has come and says you know what what I'm going to do is I'm not going to take you out as a believer and start teaching you algebra until I have brought you through your ABCs all of the small things isn't it amazing how many times we have to go to class to get some of the small things down right just reading in questions and answers is a it's obviously a sister uh writing to brother Branham about her temper and I need the Lord I know I shouldn't have this I need the Lord to deliver me from this and the prophet of God gives her this incredibly deep formula I mean it was just it was incredible it was a lot of parentheses and a lot of stuff just like algebra is and he says the longer you stay in the presence of God the less that will be in your life he didn't tell her she had to go through some kind of prayer line she didn't have to be slapped on the back she didn't have to no you stay in the presence of God and that will leave you I think that would go for a lot of things wouldn't it tonight Saints a lot of things in her life but we know that Satan tries to keep us we are amen easily the busiest generation ever so we look at this and realize that that we need to focus on the ABCs now I know this is a very simple thought tonight and I intended for it to be where can we apply getting in the presence of God do we have to have a certain place that we have to go to get in the presence of God only in church only in a prayer closet I want to drive home my brother and sister wherever a son or daughter of God is the prophet of God said the Supernatural is present with them whatever we're facing whatever has been thrown before us and we tend to want to pull back from that we kind of tend to want to flee from that our own self but there's something inside of us that really doesn't want to flee but we know oh Lord I I just need you just stop and get in that presence right there and we can then stop the influence that Satan has in our life now I want to just take you uh into this quote here believe us thou this now as we look at this my brother and sister would we agree that Jonah had some symptoms would we agree that as it is that Jonah has now been he's pulled the lot which is basically gambling but it was very accurate because God wanted it to be very accurate and even then my brother and sister it wasn't enough that it was identified that Jonah was the problem with the ship that uh God had to get him God wanted him out of the ship so now he anoints these men on the ship to tie him up and to literally cast a man into the sea which is called Murder some of them must have thought oh how can we do this but God anointed them even Jonah throw me overboard I'm the problem now this church of that attitude nobody's going to get thrown overboard but you see the length that God will go to to bring about his will we can run as far as we want to but God will tie us up and cause us to come to a place we can't run any further I say thank you Lord amen that we can run from things we know that we should do and things all of it I won't go into all the details tonight I believe that you grasped that but you see God will bring you to a place that he's going to tie you up and then he's going to bring you to a place that you have all kinds of symptoms and you don't have a solution for the symptom but I'm telling you my brother and sister in this we'll look real quick talk about symptoms look at Jonah down in the belly of the whale now I just read in my little study on this thought along the way here I love that little story I just want to interject that where the little girl you know the unbelievers coming along there and and he's talking to this little girl and he says surely you don't believe in Jonah and the whale and you know she says I do the Bible says it I believe it and the man's going along and she says and I'll I'll talk to him when I get to heaven and he says well what if he ain't there he said well when you get to hell you can talk to him so my brother and sister you see we should have an unshakable Faith they say what is this whale what could this whale be what could be that well I want to tell you we're going to be an advocate for the whale here in just a little bit you look at this my brother and sister that that this whale that God prepared was not on the ship out here it wasn't on the ship going over here but it was on this ship my voice has given up here I knew I shouldn't have swallowed that frog so the ship is there and now look how God coordinates everything just as it was on the road to Emmaus Jesus was there all the time waited till they got to the correct position and comes right in and walks right into the conversation now here is a ship that is a I mean a a whale that is a supernaturally anointed whale that is right there in a position and it's waiting there's got to be a ship come over the top this whale didn't suddenly go ding there's a splash 50 miles away gotta swim as fast as I can it was right there Jonah lands in the water the fish is there now my brother and sister if we can't believe that out of the word of God then what can we believe that God ordained that so we see now if anybody could have had symptoms he had them backslidden hands tied behind him out on the sea a storm come up pitched him out whale swallowed him went to the Bottom of the Sea any fat fish when you see when he feeds he goes and rests his fin on the bottom of the sea and there he was down there with a belly full of backslidden preacher when I read that my heart went out to this whale my he's resting on the bottom he's got this big chunk of backslidden preacher and he doesn't even get a digest him God's going to anoint him to have to go spit him out on the beach now you all know I hope I don't sound too disgusting but you all know what it's like when you have to give everything that was in your stomach up this whale can't be happy other than the fact he's anointed to fulfill the word of God I like this though he's down there with a belly full of backslidden preacher laying down there on the banks that down there under the sea a storm on the sea backslid what a condition he was he looked this way it was whale's belly he looked that away it's whale's belly we're talking my brother and sister a problem that there is no human solution to it's done it's finished everywhere he looked it was whale's belly and I want to just ask you tonight we've been in places in our life that we look every direction of the compass up and down and there is nothing but a problem in our life and we come to that place and we can give up but God never lost a one and he anointed you to keep searching for a solution till you come to his solution now his solution is not always the most convenient solution but his is the only one that always works amen so we hear it was he looked that way whales Billy everywhere he looked it was whale's belly you know what he said he said I'm not looking at that whale's belly there was something that was in him and I want to say tonight I believe every one of us here maybe our youngsters I haven't quite experienced that but every one of us that's lived life has come to the place that we realize we have to go back to the word of God and the word of God says you cannot look to your circumstance you have to look to the promise and I say God help us to look to the promise amen because the circumstance is so daunting it would cause man to lose heart but when we look to Christ we start to see there is a buoy provided there's a way opening before us the word of God the prophet preached that sermon God's provided way my brother and sister that's not just about coming down to Doctrine God's got a provided way for everything that comes on the man or human on this Earth he's got the provided way for that he's got the answer already before we even come to our problem he's given the answer amen so there it is now look at this I love how he said this because we have to all come to this place right here he said I don't know why I find this so humorous he's looking at whale's belly and he says lion vanity I can poke it seaweed wrapped around me and whatever else is there you know a bunch of oh anyway you look at that and he says that's a lion vanity Lord once more I look to your Holy Temple Hallelujah he didn't see the whale's belly he's seen God's Temple for he knowed this and so as we look at this I kind of cut this food short because there's just almost you know I I'd be just up here reading it all to you but you see Jonah knew the word of God he had read the word and he knew how that the temple being consecrated he knew that God had come into His Temple and in that he said I'm going to look to the temple I'm going to look my brother and sister he didn't look to a building he was looking to the one who filled the temple and he looked at all else and says you know what Solomon saw God in this Temple the Saints as it were saw God in this Temple I know God is in this Temple and I call the rest of this a lying vanity because whatever my position is right now I know I have a position in the temple in the house of God and he claimed that position and he speaks out about this for he knew that now we'll come and the reason I didn't go ahead and go with the quotes is because I just want to go ahead and go into the second chapter of Jonah and just take it right from the scripture I believe that would just be very fitting then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and he said I cried by reason of mine affliction now I want to bring you to this point here's a backslidden preacher who runs from God and now he's there and he says my reason of mine affliction he knew why he was there he wasn't sitting there going I have no idea if God why God would punish me he knew what his Affliction was and he knew while he was there and he said unto the Lord and he heard me and out of the belly of Hell cried I be and thou hurt us my voice for thou Hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the season the floods come past me about all thy Bellows and thy waves passed over me then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward thy Holy Temple I'm telling my brother and sister there's no better position when we are in the depths of our struggle of life we can just put the term backslidden on that to be able to stop and say I will see the Holy Temple again I will see Christ I will see his presence I will see the out pouring of his spirit I will see this I'm not going to look at my problems at my symptom but I'm going to look to the Holy Temple which is Christ himself amen and so he says there I'm going to look again towards our Holy Temple the waters come past me about even to the soul the depth closed me around about the weeds were wrapped about my head this wasn't a comfortable there was no velvet chair in the belly of this whale he was caused by God to come face to face with the very thing that caused him to run in the beginning now I didn't go into this but brother Branham says you know we all say that Jonah was backslid but brother Brown says that Jonah was operating in God's will so we look at this and realize whatever position we're in tonight whoever may hear this whatever position we're in tonight as Sons and Daughters of God always brings us back to his will he said I'll never lose a one I won't lose a single one so what does that guarantee my brother and sister that whatever it is we're fleeing from God circling us right back and putting us in a position to fulfill the will of God and we'll touch on this on a later study I believe but I just want you to understand that the problem that we have as humans is we will operate under the anointing of the leadership of the Holy Spirit and then we'll end up like job sitting under a Vine going boohoo Nineveh repented now what am I to do look at all this boo who God lets the gourd grow up and God sets a worm to cut it down blessed be the name of the Lord amen you know it's all in the molding of the character so as he looks there we'll come here and go on I went down to the bottom of the mountains and the Earth with her bars was about me forever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption O Lord my God when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee unto thine Holy Temple that they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy I want you to take that away my brother and sister when we'll look at the words and the things that Satan would do maybe he would put a stumbling Stone before us and we trip over that stumbling Stone but if we stop and look at that stumbling Zone and says that must be my identity then we are coming into lying vanities we are believing the devil over the word and the will of God but God says that's not what I want you to do I don't want you to observe the lying vanities nor do I want you to forsake the mercy that comes to us and and here is Jonah if a man ever needed Mercy my brother and sister Jonah needed Mercy Can someone say amen amen he needed Mercy at that moment and he was anointed by the Holy Ghost to come and claim his own deliverance from this God didn't say I'll let him stew in the Wales Bailey for a while and then I've still got work to do over here so then I'll make this this fish just go barf him up I'm sorry I didn't mean to use that word it's kind of gross but but no my brother and sister what happened God anointed Jonah to start claiming Deliverance there was no hope in sight when he comes into this anointing my brother and sister he didn't like have a father meter and realize hey we must be headed for a beach it's getting shallower there was nothing to give him any kind of indication that Deliverance was on the way other than the anointing that was down in his soul and he started to verbalize that and say I will see the temple again now whether you could say maybe it was in his death he's claiming that no no I don't believe that I believe it was life everything in life he was claiming that because there was an anointing come over him I say God anoint us God anoint us to always claim Life Look To Life claim the life no matter how hard it is and I'll be real blunt we have children and we have those around us that would be the extended part of this body of Believers my brother and sister we should not be out here boohoo but we should be coming and saying I see amen God in his Temple I see the veil how has written and God is present for his people and I claim that and I speak that and I believe that and I will act on that oh my brother and sister otherwise we might as well join them because our own pity party will take us to forsake our own huh they forsake their own Mercy oh my my soul fainted within me I remember the Lord my prayer came in unto thee and to thine Holy Temple they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy but I will sacrifice unto thee with my many sacrifices on this altar in the whale no he became the altar his voice of Thanksgiving became the offering literally I say this in all kindness because it applies to me too but my brother and sister we got no excuse our voice to lift up Thanksgiving to the Lord Anytime Anyplace any circumstance it's here God has given it to us to be able to say I've refused to receive these symptoms these lies this circumstance and I will give praise unto God but I will sacrifice thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and at the point he's look at this now maybe I would over emphasize this but at the point that he is declaring this that I'm going to offer up to you Lord a voice of Thanksgiving and that I'm going to fulfill my vow and salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spoke to the fish come right in line God didn't say I'll just I'll work on him while we come to the shore that little that little whale however big he was was resting he's in God's will he's doing his job imagine the fish would be saying hey what are you doing he said well I don't know but God anointed me to swallow this backslidden preacher he didn't taste good at all now I'm just waiting for whatever the Lord tells me to do I don't know if fish communicate that way but I'm telling you what when God commanded that fish to do that that fish obeyed that fish was not out of the will of God and the Lord spaking to the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon dry land now my brother and sister this dry land was a little bit of travel distance but at that point and I say this with humor tonight at that point my brother and sister I have been down that Journey you have been down you have you have all of us down that Journey we are more than happy to do what God asked us to do at that point in time and I say thank you Lord that you would bring us back you'd have Grace you'd have mercy on us you would you would care enough to just draw us woo us back to you and at that point my brother and sister our attitude is entirely different our attitude has over been overwhelmed with a great desire Lord whatever you want Lord whatever you desire of me Lord I'm here Lord Hear My Cry I'm here for you here at my father amen because you see my brother and sister sometimes we look at this and realize that I'm just going to put this into my own accord if you don't mind Jonah's character just got molded a little bit if there ever was another circumstance and there was you would think Jonah would instantly heed and I'm not going to go and preach about that tonight but maybe we'll pick this up again on another Wednesday Jonah finds himself outside of the city he should have been out there almost like a jubilee dance brother Trevor sister Kerry praise God I preach the word they repented praise God but what's he do that anointing leaves him hmm woe is me come on preachers in this assembly woe is me yeah I don't even know why I'm a preacher I don't know why I'm a pastor I don't even know why I do I don't know yeah oh my I'll cut into time here but look at this now how it is it comes along God knew exactly what he was doing and look how the Lord knew I think I think just looking at this Saints I think Jonah was a hard nut to crack until I started comparing my life and realized that I matched Jonah almost point for point and I don't think I'm a hard nut to crack but we have all witnessed the time I think this will cut every age except for our babies even include some of our young people here tonight that we know better to do what we do or say what we say and we did it anyway do you realize that nut is no harder to crack than Jonah the word says that Sin is Sin no degrees that's why I bring that out no no degrees I lied to Mom or Dad I did what I wasn't supposed to I talked back they're all equal they're all equal come right up into adult Behavior All equal Sin is Sin my brother so and so did this I don't know if God can forgive him we pray for him for 365 days and if he's willing to come and crawl up the center Isle of the church and ask forgiveness now my brother and sister Sin is Sin we are all hard nuts to crack unless the Holy Ghost comes down and anoints we'll look at this now the condition he's in and then God puts Jonah in this place where under this conviction he suddenly has a prayer life again come on be with me on this we know what the cares of life let's not act like that's always someone else we know what the cares of life and the struggles are to us and how it is so easy we can't miss a meal but we can miss a prayer but God knows how to bring us right to a place that we are like Lord I need you to come on the scene I need you to speak to me Lord I need answers for my situation or someone else's situation and it's there that we come and our prayer life is revitalized Satan tries to make that sound like you're only crying out in prayer because of this circumstance but my brother and sister it's actually the opposite God is using the whale experience to revive a prayer life it we think it's all about us my brother and sister if it was about us we would go on and it would become more uh frequent and frequent and frequent that we did not pray but God says I'm going to give my son my daughter I'm going to give them a reason and I'm going to light the fire and I'm going to Fan the flame oh that's our God that's his grace and his Mercy that's not something for us to look at ourself and say I don't know why it's always takes some hard difficult thing for me to get a prayer life again my brother and sister God used a whale hands tied throat in the ocean look like all hope is gone to get Jonah A Prayer life again hmm imagine that amen not just a prayer life but a heartfelt mound from the sincerity of the Soul oh Lord I believe your word and I believe I'll see the temple once again amen so what does he do God also knows how to bring you and I from our hitty and high-minded into a position of submission to come and say Lord I need you to lead me I thought I could I thought after all these years I could do this but Lord I realize I need you amen you might say God lined him up same God's here tonight Desiring to line us up oh some people say I don't I'm don't go for that I want a God that's just grace and mercy it don't get any more grace and it don't get any more Mercy my brother and sister than God bringing you and I back to a position of Fellowship bringing us back to where our heart is fervent and on fire again there's no greater grace and mercy on the earth oh people have such an idea well I can do whatever I want just reading where brother Brown speaking of this I can do whatever I want I'm a Christian now no my brother and sister God knows how to line us up people say I won't go to that church that's legal is what they saw was legalist was God actually coming and lining up his Saints to the word of God and people would say well they preached too hard well if it's just the preacher he might be preaching too hard if it's the Holy Ghost you better listen yeah yeah amen now remember just to balance this the Holy Ghost is a gentleman amen so we look at this and moving forward here real quick this is the Lord as difficult as this was this was the Lord wooing Jonah back hmm you imagine I just want to give you one moment of Terror not only are you on an ocean and I have been not on an ocean but I have been on a very large lake when the waves coming looked like the side or the end of this building coming towards you and suddenly I know I say this with a little humor but I say it in all seriousness suddenly you feel very compelled to cry out to the Lord in fact in the both that day as the water was slopping in the boat and the boat had probably 12 14 inches of water in the bottom of it and this is not a boat but flotation there was four of us in that boat all four of us was crying out one man was backslid had not been in church in probably six eight months started getting very worldly knelt down in a foot of water with the waves crashing over the side the boat and prayed through at the moment we were angry with him because we're saying this boat is sinking and you are what you're having a prayer meeting maybe that was his Jonah experience and maybe at that point in my life it was part of a Jonah experience for me because you start to have a very heartfelt conversation with the Lord Forgive Me Lord forgive me Lord forgive me Lord forgive me Lord I thought brother Alex the songs You Sang tonight were beautiful he loves you and me oh how much he loves you and me we ought to stand up as it were and say thank you Lord for a Jonah experience you didn't just let me go you didn't just let him throw me out of the boat and let me settle or whatever to the Bottom of the Sea and really honestly become fish food but you love me enough had everything in place to catch me when I was falling I say thank you Lord for Jonah experience let me close this the Lord wooing Jonah back into Fellowship I've got here on a side note some serious wooing but I don't know my brother and sister many of us have had that same serious wooing in our life amen this life twists and turns easy to get off the track isn't it I mean let's not be over spiritual here tonight okay I want you to be very spiritual but I just want us to stop and be able to admit it's easy to get off the track and it's easy to get back on the track amen when we act like Jonah it's just harder and harder to get on the track but I'm telling you my brother and sister poor analogy I've used it my whole life when I when the Lord wooed me back I started to realize all the things that he had kept me from we laugh about this some sister Jerry and I have some humor in this but it is like putting the dog on the chain and we've all seen this dog where he's the one that you know people are passing by on the sidewalk and he's over here and a hundred times maybe 500 times a day he runs as hard as he can hits the end of the chain does the somersault flops down on the ground gets up shakes his head wanders back over here to the stake and waits for the next victim never realizing by his own behavior he is the victim but God rich in Mercy God rich in Mercy one day we got out there on the end of the chain and something said you don't need to do this I'll set you free amen Hallelujah sister vika will you come I could preach the rest of this but I believe we got the point amen God's led us given each one of us our road to Nineveh and he's come and met us along the road and we can look back and say thank you Lord because Without You catching me I would be lost and isn't it amazing I want to just make this one point they drew Lots which we would kind of view as more of a gambling kind of thing but isn't it amazing just guaranteed they were going to pull Jonas lot [Music] the prophet of God talking about one in a million let's just stand to Worship the Lord for a couple of songs aren't you glad tonight as it were if you'll follow my thought when they pulled the Lots aren't you glad they pulled yours aren't you glad that God just come down and anointed that and said of all these millions and billions of people on the Earth I choose you oh I tell you it serves my heart Saints just as I studied this I thought Lord if this is not Grace some people think that doing what they want and God will forgive them is Grace but I tell you my brother and sister this is Grace this is Grace that when we tried to run he was there all the time we tried to flee from him we tried to do our own thing he was right there all the time imagine the presence of God is right there [Music] he's sleeping in a ship that's getting all broke up by the waves and he's able to sleep in that ship and then when they said hey why are you sleeping what's going on he was anointed to say my fault my fault oh what are we gonna do toss me in the sea you think there could be just some residual of the revelation of predestination hiding in us even in our moments we're running away I'll close with this Sunday morning preaching to the Saints there in Monmouth now I don't know who's there and who isn't only find this out after the service but there was a man setting would have been to my right side [Music] quite reactive in the service shook his head a lot raised his hand a couple times clapped [Music] turns out just moved there from Arizona [Music] raised in the message been backslid for years upon years upon years [Music] something anointing him [Music] I need to get my life right I need to get my life right you know what was really interesting this is where you see God's perfect will coming into our lives Brother Rich is there out in the driveway because the man was kind of leaving promptly and talking to him and the man says I'm not lifting Paul up but God did bless us I believe with a good service it just and the man said hey that preacher where is he from [Music] Nampa Idaho Brother Rich said the man got a funny look on his face and said when we decided to move we were in a question between Portland and Nampa Idaho [Music] all that matters Saints said he finds Christ again amen God tossed him out of the boat you might say and he landed where God wanted him to land and that's back in his presence amen God knows what that man needs just an interesting little thought to share with you Hallelujah let's keep on the road amen hallelujah created me a clean heart I didn't look up the numbers Brothers amen created [Music] Spirit Within Me create in me are clean oh [Music] and renew our eyes Spirit Within Me ask me not away from thy presence my Lord and take all thy holy Spirit from me restore unto me all the joy of thy salvation and renew our eyes Spirit within me listing that verse again away [Music] from my presence oh Lord and to ignore thy Holy Spirit from me restore run to me all the joy of thy salvation and renew our eyes Spirit Within Me oh yes Lord risk knew a right Spirit Hallelujah Hallelujah listen praises to your name sing praises to his name amen Hallelujah aren't you glad tonight we can lift a voice amen there he was in the belly of that whale that anointing of God was stronger than his circumstance his emotions what he saw and felt and he was able to lift a Voice Hallelujah I sing praises to your name oh Lord praises to your name oh Lord oh your name is great and greatly to be praised I sing praises to your name oh Lord I'll sing praises to your name oh Lord for your name is Grace and greatly to be praised we give glory to your name oh Lord Oh Glory to your name oh Lord for your name is great and greatly to be praised

a strong tower you can be dismissed As we sing this amen just remember Saints God will never allow you to be thrown overboard without the rescue plan already in place we are covered by the blood of our Lord Jesus amen that is the answer to Satan's question we should have no fear amen when we say that have no fear Hallelujah the name of the Lord is a strong tower will the righteous run and that's
