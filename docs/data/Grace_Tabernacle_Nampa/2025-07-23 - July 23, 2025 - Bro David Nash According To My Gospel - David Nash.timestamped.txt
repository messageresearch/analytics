[21:47] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[21:51] Amen. We have a few prayer requests
[21:53] written down this evening. I'm going to
[21:55] ask I'm going to ask our brother Paul if
[21:56] you'd come just take these before the
[21:57] Lord this evening. Um we want to
[21:59] remember uh
[22:02] brother Paul's asking please pray for
[22:04] Mike Margarite uh last few days it he
[22:08] had a sore on his leg that has turned
[22:10] into an inflamed sore that now requires
[22:12] surgery. Um if I remember he's a friend
[22:15] of Joel's and and brother Paul's met the
[22:18] man. Amen. So I just want to pray for
[22:20] him. I don't know where his situation
[22:22] is, but also pray for Lord to save his
[22:26] soul. Amen. I don't know what, but
[22:28] um also remember pray for my uh nephew
[22:32] Matthew. He's going through a going
[22:34] through a time, you know, those teenage
[22:36] years can be tough on a kid and he's
[22:38] having a tough time of it. So Lord, just
[22:41] just pray, you know, Lord, just speak to
[22:44] his heart and point him in the right
[22:46] direction. Amen. Um,
[22:50] I'll just continue to remember my sister
[22:51] Elizabeth or cousin Elizabeth sister
[22:54] sister cousin, you know what I mean? Um,
[22:56] in prayer as well. She I can't remember
[22:58] the last report, but uh she was having
[23:00] some more treatments and they were um
[23:03] she had some low blood levels. So, just
[23:05] continue to hold her up in prayer. Amen.
[23:08] Also wanted to just give a praise
[23:10] report. mom was when they were in
[23:11] Wyoming this last week. She was not I
[23:15] mean pretty bad off and thought she'd
[23:18] have to go to the hospital um maybe that
[23:20] night, but um we prayed and she woke up
[23:23] in the morning and just said it was
[23:24] miraculous how much better she felt. So
[23:26] the Lord is still working. Amen. We give
[23:29] him thanks for that. Hallelujah.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. I just went
[23:48] happening so quick
[23:55] [Music]
[24:03] oaks that pray, but I need prayer. And
[24:06] uh so we just want to remember remember
[24:08] that. And that opened the door for a
[24:10] lovely
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. And that opened the door for a
[24:15] lovely conversation with my son. Amen.
[24:17] So, we thank the Lord for that. Amen.
[24:20] And uh so just want to remember all of
[24:24] our normal prayer requests. I know we uh
[24:27] talk about them a lot, but um those up
[24:30] north and Montana, Washington, Idaho, uh
[24:34] just remember each and every one. I was
[24:37] thinking about Daniel last few days.
[24:40] Haven't seen him for a bit. And uh we
[24:42] just want to lift him up before the Lord
[24:43] and certainly every one of our children
[24:46] in their situations. Amen. Heavenly
[24:49] Father, Lord, we come before you this
[24:52] evening with thanksgiving in our hearts,
[24:55] Lord, for we stand just as our brother
[24:57] Isaac said. Father, we don't have to
[24:59] feel it. We don't have to have any kind
[25:02] of external stimulation. Lord, you said
[25:05] it. We believe it and father it will
[25:09] come to pass. And father, we want to
[25:11] stand here in faith, Lord, knowing with
[25:15] expectation that these things will come
[25:17] to pass and that the very life that you
[25:20] have spoken, Lord, would be there, that
[25:24] we would reach out and claim it, Lord,
[25:26] not to let doubt and fear, anxiety rob
[25:31] us of our victory, but Lord, that today
[25:34] we can just simply steadfastly stand
[25:36] upon your word. So we remember Mike,
[25:39] Lord, today. He's got young children.
[25:42] Father, we just ask you, Lord. Lord, he
[25:45] has met some people who have prayer. And
[25:48] Father, we just lift him up before you.
[25:51] May this be a door, Lord, that would be
[25:53] open to his soul, Lord, that he would
[25:56] not have to look for others that pray,
[25:58] but Lord, may you just stimulate a
[26:01] prayer life in him. Lord, we pray for
[26:04] him, his wife, his children. May they
[26:06] find salvation, find you in this
[26:09] situation. And Father, we pray for
[26:11] Matthew. Lord, a young man in a troubled
[26:14] time, a troubled age that we live in, a
[26:17] young man, Father, needs to find an
[26:19] anchor in his life, an absolute. And we
[26:22] just ask you to come, Father, and just
[26:25] settle that question for him, Lord, that
[26:28] he would be able to then go on with
[26:30] confidence to live all the days of his
[26:31] life knowing who he is in you. Lord, we
[26:35] just lift up every prayer request.
[26:36] Father, those that are overseas, our
[26:39] sister Toma, uh, Brother Vasilei on the
[26:42] road, Brother Sergey, sister Julia,
[26:44] Father, uh, soon to return from their
[26:47] family vacation, Lord, uh, each and
[26:51] every one, Father, we just lift up
[26:53] before you, Father, just to touch, Lord,
[26:56] every life in the way, Father, that you
[26:59] would just love to touch us, Lord. For
[27:01] we know the prophet told us that you you
[27:04] desire to heal us more than we want
[27:06] healing. You desire to save us more than
[27:09] we want to be saved. You desire to do
[27:12] all of these things, Lord, more than we
[27:14] even know how to ask. And Father, we
[27:18] just want to reach out in faith and
[27:19] claim each need, Father, each situation.
[27:22] And Lord, we just want to come and ask
[27:25] you tonight, Father, for more opening of
[27:28] your word, more revelation, Father, that
[27:30] you would give to your bride. For,
[27:32] Father, the season is now that you are
[27:35] fulfilling your word. And we see that.
[27:37] And Lord, we just long, Father, for more
[27:40] of you. Ask you to move in our midst
[27:42] tonight. Use our brother to speak to our
[27:45] needs spiritually, Lord. That it would
[27:47] encourage each and every one of us.
[27:49] Lord, we thank you for your grace, for
[27:51] your mercy, your kindness upon us, Lord,
[27:54] as every believer, Father, in the realm
[27:56] that we have influence, Lord, would just
[27:59] be blessed and come closer to you. Lord,
[28:01] we thank you for your kindness tonight
[28:03] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats.
[28:14] Amen.
[28:16] Number 480. He paid the debt. Song's
[28:19] been on my heart the last couple days.
[28:22] [Music]
[28:28] He paid a debt. He did not
[28:34] owe the debt. I could not pay. I needed
[28:41] someone
[28:43] to wash my sins away.
[28:50] And now I sing a brand new song.
[28:56] Amazing
[28:58] grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[29:05] debt that I could never pay.
[29:12] He paid a debt at Calvary.
[29:18] He cleansed my soul and set me free. I'm
[29:24] glad that Jesus.
[29:27] Did all my sins erase.
[29:34] I now can sing a brand new song. Amazing
[29:41] grace. All day long, Christ Jesus paid a
[29:48] debt that I could never pay.
[29:56] One day he's coming back for me to live
[30:02] with him eternally.
[30:06] Won't it be glory
[30:10] to see him on that day?
[30:17] I then will sing a brand new song.
[30:23] Amazing grace
[30:26] all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt
[30:32] that I could never pay.
[30:39] Amen.

[36:20] Lord.
[36:26] [Music]
[36:32] Oh, give thanks.
[36:37] Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[36:40] If we could stand for just a moment as
[36:42] we approach the scripture.
[36:45] I'm grateful to be here tonight. Thank
[36:47] you, brother Paul. and uh we just had a
[36:53] kind of had a vacation. We've been off
[36:55] for a few weeks and he asked, "Well,
[36:57] would you speak tomorrow night?" And I
[36:58] said, "Wow, if I remember how
[37:03] fortunately, it's not up to me. It's up
[37:05] to God." So, and all I have to do is let
[37:07] go and let God. So, that's the nice
[37:10] part.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; But, uh happy to be here. And for all
[37:14] the people out there online, I don't
[37:16] know if I got this little thing on you.
[37:18] change deals and it's still red. How do
[37:20] I turn it on?
[37:55] Well, I know I know how to use this one
[37:58] if we have to.
[38:02] all the, you know, the modern stuff and
[38:04] then we go just calling as it is we get
[38:09] and I was looking here at this notebook
[38:12] where we try to keep some kind of order
[38:14] to notes and and I feel sorry sometimes
[38:18] for guys that they don't get out that
[38:20] much because if you're not real busy but
[38:24] you're always gathering notes and things
[38:25] and then it's that thing where you want
[38:28] to give them the whole bail and at least
[38:30] in in what I do. So sometimes I know
[38:33] brother David I look at him and I go I
[38:35] feel for you brother David. I really do
[38:38] because at least you know I go to
[38:39] Nicaragua. I spoke I think uh 11 times
[38:43] in 12 days so I can just start through
[38:45] the notes
[38:47] and uh uh it's very helpful sometimes
[38:52] and but we're just thankful to the Lord
[38:54] for what he does for us and um we have
[38:59] somebody was asking well where's your
[39:01] next trip and
[39:02] [Applause]
[39:05] I don't know to be real honest the ones
[39:08] that have been coming back the most to
[39:09] us we hear from India every week. We
[39:12] hear from Chile about every other week
[39:14] or third week. And not to mention El
[39:17] Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama. I heard
[39:21] possible for Brazil recently. Uh
[39:26] Italy has several times and I just go,
[39:29] Lord, I don't have a clue.
[39:32] If it's not you, if it's not you leading
[39:35] and you providing for it, then it's just
[39:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; They're just little electronic digits.
[39:41] That's all. So, we just praise the Lord
[39:44] for that and do pray for us. We covet
[39:46] your prayers. And uh I was telling
[39:50] somebody just recently,
[39:52] you know, because they were like, "Well,
[39:53] why would you want me to pray for And I
[39:55] said, because when you look at Exodus,
[39:58] God told Moses, "I heard the cry of my
[40:01] people."
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Moses wasn't crying out to God.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; He was just a happy sheep farmer.
[40:08] And but God said, "No, Moses, you're
[40:11] going down there because I heard their
[40:14] voice." So do pray for us and pray for
[40:18] some of these people in these other
[40:20] countries there. It is a famine
[40:23] &gt;&gt; for the hearing the word of the god.
[40:25] Word of God worldwide.
[40:27] And
[40:29] so we just praise the Lord. Happy to be
[40:32] here tonight. Happy for each one of you
[40:34] and all those that out in electronic
[40:36] land. Let's turn first to uh second
[40:39] Timothy the the uh second chapter.
[40:55] Happy to have my wife with us here
[40:57] tonight. She has her struggles with and
[41:00] I know I've said I probably maybe didn't
[41:02] say it here, but because she's had the
[41:04] colon surgery and stuff, the kids call
[41:06] her our mom the semicolon.
[41:08] And uh so she has her struggles. But I'm
[41:12] happy to have you here tonight, darling.
[41:16] So, uh,
[41:19] well, here we go. Going the wrong
[41:22] direction,
[41:24] still working this this we got this new
[41:27] Bible. It's been about a half a year ago
[41:29] or so. A little more. No, a little more
[41:31] than that now. But, uh, I still, you
[41:33] know, you go through and you start
[41:34] marking things and I still don't know
[41:37] where everything at is in this new one.
[41:39] And the other one I thought, well, I'll
[41:40] use it. And you open it up and the pages
[41:42] are falling out. So that don't work
[41:44] either. But second Timothy in chapter 2
[41:48] and verse 8, he said uh we'll start with
[41:52] verse 7. Consider what I say and the
[41:54] Lord give thee understanding in all
[41:56] things. Remember that Jesus Christ of
[41:59] the seed of David was raised up from the
[42:01] dead according to my gospel.
[42:05] And then if we could turn also uh to
[42:09] Ephesians the first chapter
[42:15] and there we'll read a little longer
[42:17] portion. We'll start about verse I think
[42:19] it's 17
[42:21] uh well we'll start 16. cease not to
[42:25] give thanks for you, making mention you
[42:27] of you in our prayers, that the God of
[42:29] our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
[42:32] glory, may give unto you the spirit of
[42:35] wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[42:37] of him. the eyes of your understanding
[42:40] be enlightened that ye may know what is
[42:42] the hope of his calling that the riches
[42:44] of the glory of his inheritance in the
[42:46] saints and what is the exceedingness
[42:50] exceeding greatness of his power to
[42:52] usward who believe according to the
[42:54] working of his mighty power which he
[42:57] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[42:59] from the dead and set him on his own
[43:02] right hand in heavenly places far above
[43:05] all principality power might and
[43:08] dominion ion and every name that is
[43:10] named not only in this world but also in
[43:13] that which is to come. Gracious heavenly
[43:16] father, we've read your word tonight. I
[43:18] ask you Lord just
[43:21] get this man out of the way and let the
[43:23] spirit of God that you placed within it
[43:25] speak to the hearts of your people in
[43:27] Jesus' name. Amen. Please be seated.
[43:32] as we look at it at at that first
[43:34] scripture that we read from second
[43:36] Timothy and how it appears is kind of a
[43:39] strange verse in some respects because
[43:43] we think well Jesus Christ was raised up
[43:47] uh you know at the resurrection and we
[43:50] read about you know through Matthew,
[43:51] Mark, Luke and John and each one has
[43:53] their uh description of the resurrection
[43:57] and what happened at the resurrection
[43:58] and after the resurrection and how that
[44:01] the the power of God as we think about
[44:04] it. But nobody really even in those
[44:07] gospels really explains as to what
[44:10] brought that resurrection power
[44:14] to pass. And here we see in Timothy when
[44:19] uh Paul is speaking here to to Timothy
[44:22] and he says remember that Jesus Christ
[44:26] of the seed of David was raised
[44:31] from the dead according to my gospel.
[44:34] Now as we think and we know in this the
[44:37] end of Timothy when it talks about every
[44:39] scripture has compound meaning and
[44:41] compound revelation. And as we look at
[44:44] this and we and and we take a close exam
[44:47] or I take a close examination of this,
[44:49] it said that Jesus Christ, he's of the
[44:52] seed of David. Well, what is the the
[44:54] seed of David? So, we start thinking
[44:57] about Jesus Christ is being raised from
[44:59] the dead. And he said it's according to
[45:01] my gospel, but this came from the seed
[45:04] of David.
[45:05] Well, so we go back and and we covered
[45:08] this, I think, a few a while back when
[45:10] we were here and we spoke about uh how
[45:14] that David was used and how that when he
[45:17] was first called and we we'll just read
[45:20] that first. It's in 1st Samuel chapter
[45:23] 16
[45:25] and how we took that when God became uh
[45:28] took showed kingship through David. But
[45:31] it starts out there in 1st Samuel 6
[45:34] first. I'm sorry. I have a broken tooth.
[45:36] So, I'm talking funny because I try to
[45:38] keep my tongue off of that tooth because
[45:40] it scratches it. So, if I'm talking
[45:43] funny, it's not that I'm
[45:45] just be merciful to me. Praise the Lord.
[45:47] And the Lord said unto Samuel, "How long
[45:49] wil thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have
[45:51] rejected him from reigning over Israel?
[45:54] Fill thy horn with oil, and go, and I
[45:56] will send thee to Jesse the Bethleamite,
[45:58] for I have provided me a king among his
[46:01] sons."
[46:03] And he continues there and and in verse
[46:06] the ne in verse three he says and call
[46:08] Jesse to the sacrifice show thee what
[46:11] thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto
[46:14] me uh whom I name unto thee. And so we
[46:19] look at this and he when Paul speaks
[46:22] this in Timothy he said that Jesus
[46:24] Christ was raised from the dead. He's
[46:26] he's of the seed of David and he's
[46:29] raised from the dead according to and
[46:32] then Paul says my gospel and if we think
[46:36] about this as okay the seed of David
[46:38] what is the seed of David we started out
[46:41] and the Lord speaks to Samuel.
[46:45] So if we were to turn as it were to John
[46:48] the first chapter it says in the
[46:49] beginning was the word the word was with
[46:51] God and the word was God. And so we see
[46:55] when it says the Lord or that God is
[46:57] speaking to Samuel and Samuel I believe
[47:00] is the first man that's mentioned in the
[47:03] scripture that it says that God was
[47:05] revealed to Samuel by the word of the
[47:08] Lord. There were other prophets other
[47:10] they had visions. They had all different
[47:13] kinds of ways that God dealt with them.
[47:15] But God that Samuel was the first one
[47:17] that it said that he was he that God was
[47:20] revealed to Samuel by the word. So here
[47:24] the word of the Lord comes to or the
[47:27] Lord the word comes to Samuel. So Samuel
[47:30] is beginning to understand and perceive
[47:34] that the word of God or God the word is
[47:37] here and he's speaking to me. And as he
[47:40] speaks to him, he gives him certain
[47:42] instructions.
[47:44] And those instructions were to go and
[47:47] anoint me and that me is God himself to
[47:51] be king.
[47:52] So God is telling Samuel, I'm going to
[47:56] show myself as a king and whoever I
[47:59] anoint.
[48:01] And then he tells him, go down to Jesse
[48:03] the Bethleamite. And we went over that
[48:05] how the Jesse means where I ex means I
[48:09] exist. And he exists where? In
[48:12] Bethlehem,
[48:14] the house of God's bread. So immediately
[48:17] we begin to see the word of God coming
[48:21] from the presence of God and and putting
[48:25] the seed of God. You know we look at it
[48:28] as words on pages but that behind that
[48:31] seed there is a power of God a power of
[48:35] creation that goes back to the very
[48:37] personality of God. In the very
[48:40] beginning of the book it says in the
[48:42] beginning God created. So we see that is
[48:45] God's way of demonstrating himself into
[48:50] these realms that we live in. And so
[48:53] when he speaks to Samuel, he is going
[48:56] forth now an he's giving that power of
[49:00] creation into his prophet Samuel by his
[49:03] word.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; And so Timothy says he was raised up. He
[49:08] he that Jesus Christ he said remember
[49:10] this Jesus Christ was raised up. He's of
[49:14] the seed of David. So what is the seed
[49:16] of David? It is the word of God.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; It is the power of creation behind the
[49:24] word of God.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; And so that prophet goes down. He goes
[49:29] to where God exists. Go to where I exist
[49:34] and that is in the house of my bread.
[49:37] Jesus said, "I am the bread of life."
[49:41] And so we see the power of creation has
[49:44] come and begins to demonstrate
[49:48] this seed of David that brought forth
[49:52] Jesus Christ. And here Paul said, "And
[49:55] he was raised from the dead according to
[49:59] my gospel by the seed of David."
[50:03] Are you with me? Okay. So
[50:07] as we look at that in a little deeper
[50:10] thought or with a little more depth and
[50:14] how that
[50:16] we thinking that each scripture or every
[50:19] scripture has compound meaning and
[50:21] compound revelation and he says there
[50:24] that he was ra let me let me get turn
[50:27] back to it so I'm quoting it correctly.
[50:33] We uh today kind of started off with a
[50:38] wow wild day. Phone calls, visitors,
[50:41] whatever. It was just kind of an amazing
[50:44] day. But and I just said at one point
[50:48] because I had three phone calls I think
[50:50] in a row and I'm looking at I'm going,
[50:52] Lord, I know this is just the enemy
[50:54] trying to get me goofed up. So, praise
[50:58] the Lord.
[50:59] And remember that Jesus Christ of the
[51:02] seed of David was raised from the dead
[51:04] according to my gospel. So as we think
[51:07] of Jesus Christ was raised from the
[51:10] dead. He was of the seed of David. Well,
[51:12] we look at other things in the life of
[51:14] David and we can see those seed. The
[51:17] seed that came through that prophet is
[51:20] now being expressed. We know when he
[51:23] went to and faced Goliath here was
[51:25] Goliath and he had the sword. And I
[51:29] remember a little further in there when
[51:32] David goes down to I believe it's a
[51:34] Himlec and said, "Do you have any
[51:36] weapons here in the church?"
[51:39] And a Hima says, "Well, I I yeah, I just
[51:42] got one." And and well, what is it? And
[51:45] it's the sword of Goliath, which you
[51:47] took from the valley of El. And David
[51:50] said, "Give it to me. There's no sword
[51:53] like that sword."
[51:55] Now remember, we're talking about this
[51:56] is the seed of David coming through
[51:59] history.
[52:01] Goliath held that sword.
[52:04] How did Goliath get that sword?
[52:08] Well, and why were all of those men
[52:11] afraid of Goliath? We know he represents
[52:15] Satan, of course, because David stood up
[52:17] against him and said, "Why do you let
[52:20] this happen? Why is he even allowed to
[52:23] uh speak against the armies of Israel?
[52:27] How did it did and how did Goliath get
[52:30] that sword? And and what was the seed
[52:32] that we're talking about that's going to
[52:34] come forth later on?
[52:37] Because David now is representing God as
[52:40] king. And when he goes and faces that
[52:43] giant, how did Goliath get the sword?
[52:45] And why were those men so afraid? In the
[52:48] book of Hebrews, the 2 chapter, it said
[52:50] that well, let's read it. It's just a
[52:52] few pages away
[53:02] for as much. And this is Hebrews 2:12.
[53:05] This is to show you why these people
[53:07] were afraid and why we were part of and
[53:10] have been part of this fear and yet we
[53:13] shouldn't be now. For as much then as
[53:16] the children are partakers of flesh and
[53:18] blood, he also likewise talking about
[53:20] Jesus Christ, took part of the same,
[53:23] that through death he might destroy him
[53:26] that had the power of death. That is the
[53:28] devil.
[53:31] Through death he would destroy the power
[53:33] of death. And that's the devil because
[53:36] he held the power of death. Goliath
[53:40] represented the power of death by
[53:42] holding that sword.
[53:45] And he's saying that uh and that that is
[53:50] the devil and deliver them who through
[53:52] the fear of death
[53:56] &gt;&gt; were all their lifetimes subject to
[53:58] bondage.
[53:59] What was holding them? Who held the
[54:03] sword? Was Satan?
[54:06] David said there's no sword like that
[54:08] sword because that sword represented the
[54:10] word of God in the hands of Satan. And
[54:14] how did Satan get that sword? Because
[54:17] when he spoke to Eve, she was the one in
[54:20] the transgression. You can read that in
[54:22] Timothy also. And how that she fell and
[54:25] and when she did that, because the word
[54:28] of God said, "In the day you eat
[54:30] thereof, ye shall surely die."
[54:33] That was the word of the Lord.
[54:37] That was God's word concerning their
[54:40] partaking of that particular tree,
[54:44] which we know it was
[54:48] sensual. I'll use that word. And how
[54:51] that when they did that,
[54:54] Satan was able to put the fear of death
[54:57] on them right there.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:00] &gt;&gt; They became afraid of the word of God.
[55:04] They became afraid because they knew
[55:07] they had fallen into disobedience.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about the seed of
[55:18] David. We know that God in David as an
[55:24] anointed king and he wasn't he was he
[55:27] was anointed king but he wasn't king
[55:29] yet. He was still out in the shepherd's
[55:32] field
[55:33] doing his thing because God is our
[55:35] shepherd.
[55:37] But he goes and when he slays that giant
[55:40] and he takes that sword away from him,
[55:44] what's the one thing he did with the
[55:45] sword? He didn't have a sword of his
[55:47] own. He picked up Goliath's sword and
[55:50] chops his head off.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Satan's headship is finished
[55:57] &gt;&gt; by the sword
[55:58] &gt;&gt; of God's word.
[56:01] headship done, finished. Stop talking
[56:03] about him.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; He's dead.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Just saying what the word says.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; That devil is dead. And yet he runs
[56:14] people around. He does it. All of us, I
[56:16] suppose.
[56:18] And but we forget he's dead.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; That
[56:24] That guy's dead, man. And how did they
[56:26] cut his head off? Right here. Amen.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; The seed of David. And so he's talking
[56:34] about that seed
[56:36] coming through there and how that they
[56:38] were afraid, but Jesus Christ took death
[56:41] himself to take the fear away.
[56:46] And let's I wasn't going to do this, but
[56:48] I it's come to my mind a couple of times
[56:51] in Genesis that's Genesis that chap
[56:53] first I think it's third chapter.
[56:59] as they have fallen
[57:03] uh
[57:06] and it's when God comes to them. We'll
[57:10] start with verse 7 is it's chapter 3:7.
[57:12] And the eyes of them both were opened
[57:14] and they knew that they were naked and
[57:16] they sewed the fig leaves together and
[57:18] made themselves apron and they heard the
[57:20] voice of the Lord God walking in the
[57:22] garden. What's the voice of the Lord?
[57:24] It's the word, friends.
[57:26] It's the word, the agape or the the love
[57:29] of God, the word of God, the logos
[57:33] speaking to them, excuse me. And uh they
[57:37] heard the voice of the Lord God walking
[57:39] in the garden in the cool of the day.
[57:41] And Adam and his wife hid themselves
[57:45] from the presence of the Lord God
[57:47] amongst the trees of the garden. What
[57:50] had happened?
[57:53] Satan had begun to anoint them with his
[57:58] anointing
[58:00] because when God when the voice the
[58:03] logos voice of God comes walking in the
[58:07] garden and it says the Lord God called
[58:09] unto Adam and said unto him where art
[58:12] thou Adam or where art thou and he and
[58:15] Adam answers and said I heard thy voice
[58:17] in the garden and I was afraid
[58:20] because I was naked and I hid myself.
[58:24] What happened here? He's a son of God.
[58:28] He even knew what he was doing.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; He knew what he was doing.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; And he took her and we realize he did it
[58:37] because he loved her
[58:39] because she was part
[58:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; of him.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; But the voice of the Lord or the word of
[58:46] God had said, "The day you do that,
[58:49] you'll die." So the judgment against the
[58:53] disobedience
[58:55] as it were was the death shall be a part
[58:59] of your your life from here on
[59:04] and by that word of the Lord.
[59:08] But when Satan by had got a hold of that
[59:11] word now through disobedience and he's
[59:14] holding every man, woman, and child
[59:18] captive to fear from this day on because
[59:22] Adam said, "I was afraid."
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:26] So God and it's a whole different
[59:30] message but actually when you take where
[59:32] it says the voice of the Lord there it's
[59:35] you look at all the things that were in
[59:37] the voice God came to them in absolute
[59:40] mercy and grace and they hid themselves
[59:44] from the grace and mercy of God
[59:50] &gt;&gt; and they and because they hid themselves
[59:54] he said I heard thy voice. He heard the
[59:57] mercy, the grace, the blood, and and all
[1:00:01] there's there's a whole list of
[1:00:03] definitions that go behind that voice of
[1:00:06] the Lord. And he heard that and was
[1:00:08] afraid. And so God asked him these
[1:00:12] questions, but then God has him to stand
[1:00:15] up and they go into judgment
[1:00:18] because they turned down the mercy.
[1:00:22] Wow. Lord, please take over.
[1:00:26] I was afraid. I hid myself because I was
[1:00:28] naked. And he said, "Who told thee?" And
[1:00:30] so forth. And then the Lord, you know,
[1:00:34] asked the woman, "What happened?" And
[1:00:35] she said, "The
[1:00:37] and right immediately after that, what
[1:00:40] happens is God begins to give judgment
[1:00:43] on the situation. Serpent, you're going
[1:00:46] on your belly. Eve, every woman from
[1:00:49] here on is going to have trouble in
[1:00:51] their childbirth. because of what you
[1:00:53] did. It's not so much to me the fact
[1:00:58] that they committed the act as it is the
[1:01:01] fact that they became afraid of the
[1:01:04] grace and mercy of God.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; When mercy came to them through the
[1:01:10] voice of God
[1:01:14] and they hid themselves.
[1:01:17] And we see that seed goes all the way
[1:01:20] through history because when it comes to
[1:01:22] Isaiah, it says we hid ourselves from
[1:01:25] him. Every man, woman, and child, when
[1:01:29] we feel the judgment of God or we think
[1:01:33] about the situation of mankind, we
[1:01:36] become afraid.
[1:01:41] And he said through the seed of David
[1:01:43] going back to Timothy and he was we
[1:01:46] think about the other things that
[1:01:48] happened within the life of David and in
[1:01:50] the Psalms there's so so many things
[1:01:54] where when David speaks things in the
[1:01:57] Psalms and and I think it's uh it's I
[1:02:00] don't believe it's 19. I forgot which
[1:02:01] one it was. I got it written down in a
[1:02:03] different notebook. The different places
[1:02:06] where it said, "Thou wil not leave his
[1:02:07] soul in hell, nor suffer my holy one to
[1:02:09] see corruption."
[1:02:11] And how that what was that? David spoke
[1:02:16] it, but what was it? It was a seed from
[1:02:20] God that came through the life of David
[1:02:24] as God was showing himself as king.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] And from that seed,
[1:02:32] he said, Paul says, remember
[1:02:36] that Jesus Christ of the seed of David
[1:02:38] because David was the manifestation
[1:02:42] of the seed that came from God through
[1:02:45] that prophet to be manifested through
[1:02:47] history and show up as Jesus Christ.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:52] Jesus also talked about then how that uh
[1:02:55] when they ask him for a sign and and we
[1:02:59] ministered on this a while back uh with
[1:03:03] Jonah and Jesus says the only sign
[1:03:05] you're going to get is the sign of the
[1:03:06] prophet Jonah
[1:03:09] and how that that in that seed was the
[1:03:12] power of the resurrection
[1:03:16] and that
[1:03:20] that seed was manifested And that seed
[1:03:22] came down through Jesus Christ. But time
[1:03:25] after time, things that happened in the
[1:03:28] life of David showed us Christ.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; And the the the beginning of Christ. And
[1:03:36] and even we mentioned to him and how
[1:03:38] David said there's no sword like that
[1:03:40] sword. And remember that sword was
[1:03:42] wrapped in swaddling cloth.
[1:03:45] It was wrapped in swaddling cloth and it
[1:03:48] was behind the altar. And I think before
[1:03:50] we, you know, we hung the coat on the
[1:03:52] front and be and that because that was
[1:03:53] the ephod of the priest hung on the
[1:03:56] front of the altar. The yuroman was on
[1:03:58] there, but the sword was in the heart of
[1:04:01] the altar.
[1:04:04] And he said, "There's no sword like that
[1:04:06] sword. Give it to me."
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; David was a man after God's own heart.
[1:04:11] And when the high priest hands David the
[1:04:15] sword, what did he just give him?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. the heart of God.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Because the heart of God is the word of
[1:04:24] God. And how did the word appear? He had
[1:04:28] to unwrap the sword
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; and the sword, the word of God. And the
[1:04:33] angel came to those shepherds and said,
[1:04:36] "Behold, is born this day a Savior,
[1:04:39] which is Christ the Lord. And this will
[1:04:41] be a sign unto you. You shall find the
[1:04:43] babe, the heart of God wrapped in
[1:04:47] swaddling cloth,
[1:04:49] lying in a manger where? In Bethlehem?
[1:04:55] In the house of my bread. God's bread is
[1:04:59] where my heart lies.
[1:05:03] You love him. Yes.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:05:08] we see time after time that seed of
[1:05:11] David manifested in Christ over and over
[1:05:14] and over. So much so and uh when David
[1:05:20] after David fell
[1:05:23] where we look at it as he fell and had
[1:05:25] taken Ba Sheeba and
[1:05:28] he falls under the curses also.
[1:05:32] And cuz you know the prophet said,
[1:05:34] "David, you're not surely going to die.
[1:05:36] You're not going to die, David." David
[1:05:38] had pronounced his own judgment. He was
[1:05:41] the highest voice or highest authority
[1:05:43] of the land. And what the king says is
[1:05:45] what's supposed to happen. And he said,
[1:05:47] "Let that man die."
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; He should have died
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; under his own commandment.
[1:05:56] But that prophet stepped forth. And have
[1:05:58] we ever noticed he used the same words
[1:06:01] that Satan did?
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Satan said, "You'll not surely die." And
[1:06:07] that prophet said, "You'll not die,
[1:06:09] David.
[1:06:11] Even though you did this, you'll not
[1:06:13] die." And we but the but what happened
[1:06:17] the fear of death even on him as king
[1:06:21] now because can you imagine what went
[1:06:23] through his mind when he realizes when
[1:06:26] the prophet said that guy was you David
[1:06:29] he has just condemned himself to death
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; his guards or whatever could have took
[1:06:36] their swords right there and killed him
[1:06:38] and had every right to do it
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; because that's how kings work. Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; And but then that voice comes back and
[1:06:49] he brings to remembrance the words from
[1:06:52] the garden. And when God used that
[1:06:55] voice, no, death has been abolished.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; David, you already cut the head off
[1:07:04] and you have the sword in your hand.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] But we see then all those curses that
[1:07:11] fell upon David. And so he gets thrown
[1:07:13] out of his kingdom and as he's going out
[1:07:15] of his kingdom and he goes up the hill
[1:07:17] and he stops
[1:07:20] and he weeps on a on a rock and we see
[1:07:23] that and then he goes on from there and
[1:07:26] we see that I believe it was about 600
[1:07:28] years later here's Jesus Christ
[1:07:32] thrown out of his kingdom because the
[1:07:34] Bible said that he came to his own and
[1:07:36] his own received him not.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Right? So, he's been thrown out of his
[1:07:41] kingdom and he's going up perhaps the
[1:07:43] same hill, perhaps the same rock. And he
[1:07:47] stops to weep over Jerusalem.
[1:07:50] And as he weeps over Jerusalem, Jesus
[1:07:54] says, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often
[1:07:56] would I have gathered you, but you would
[1:07:59] not."
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; What drove David to that rock?
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; It was the sin of adultery.
[1:08:06] What took Jesus to that same rock?
[1:08:09] Adultery in the Garden of Eden. That's
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; You see the seed of David coming through
[1:08:16] over and over and over.
[1:08:22] But then he comes down. I don't
[1:08:25] there
[1:08:27] as he looks at it.
[1:08:31] Paul making that particular statement
[1:08:35] and he said remember that Jesus Christ
[1:08:38] of the seed of David. So we've
[1:08:39] established Jesus Christ has the seed of
[1:08:42] David over and over and over manifested
[1:08:45] through Jesus Christ. He said remember
[1:08:47] this that Jesus Christ was of the sa
[1:08:50] seed of David and he was raised from the
[1:08:53] dead according to my gospel.
[1:08:57] Hm. Paul wasn't even on the scene yet
[1:09:00] when Jesus Christ was raised from the
[1:09:02] dead.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; So, how and why would he be relaying it
[1:09:08] to us this way from this scripture?
[1:09:12] He wasn't alive. He even said so. I was
[1:09:14] born out of season. I wasn't with the
[1:09:16] original 12. I'm we'd call it, you know,
[1:09:19] the odd duck or or whatever. And so, he
[1:09:23] wasn't even there. But he's saying that
[1:09:25] that seed of David that he was raised
[1:09:30] according to my gospel. Well, you know,
[1:09:33] in the English language, we can say,
[1:09:35] well, he's just relating back to it.
[1:09:37] Well, if we just relate back to it,
[1:09:39] we're taking on a denominational spirit
[1:09:41] because it always looks back and it
[1:09:43] always looks ahead and ignores what's
[1:09:45] going on right
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; now.
[1:09:49] And so in the right now when Paul speaks
[1:09:51] this to Timothy,
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; he's saying that the seed of David has
[1:09:56] brought forth the you know the
[1:09:58] resurrection of Jesus Christ according
[1:10:01] to my gospel. So he's saying the gospel
[1:10:04] that's being preached right now
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; has the power of resurrection in it
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; according to the seed of David that was
[1:10:13] in or brought forth Jesus Christ
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; the power of the resurrection. Thank you
[1:10:24] brother David.
[1:10:26] We we work we work together
[1:10:30] I believe. And so that power of
[1:10:32] resurrection you too brother Paul
[1:10:36] he's say saying that the power of the
[1:10:38] resurrection is in the gospel that's
[1:10:42] being preached right
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; now. We are delving or going in tonight
[1:10:49] to the same gospel
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; that brought Jesus Christ from the dead
[1:10:54] that Paul could look back and say what
[1:10:56] I'm preaching is the same thing that
[1:11:00] brought Jesus Christ from the dead.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; And that was according to the seed of
[1:11:06] David which is the word of God.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's right. So we see the
[1:11:13] power of resurrection is in the word of
[1:11:15] God.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; So why would Paul be relating this to
[1:11:20] Timothy? Well, Timothy's going out among
[1:11:22] all the Gentiles and
[1:11:25] as you read through there and he's, you
[1:11:27] know, he's with those other apostles and
[1:11:29] God has now turned away from the Jews or
[1:11:32] is in the process of turning away. It
[1:11:34] wasn't an instantaneous thing, but uh
[1:11:38] and as so he's telling these Gentiles,
[1:11:40] the power of resurrection comes to us by
[1:11:43] way of the seed of David according to
[1:11:45] what I'm preaching,
[1:11:48] according to my gospel.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Why would that be important?
[1:11:56] And we get look again. We go back to
[1:11:58] Jesus Christ. And when the Gentiles came
[1:12:01] to Jesus Christ, sir, we would see
[1:12:03] Jesus. You've heard the tape.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Sir, we would see Jesus. Jesus didn't
[1:12:08] even go talk to them.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; No, that's right.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; He did not even give those guys a
[1:12:14] chance. I I
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; No, he just told I believe it was the
[1:12:18] disciples, just go back and tell them
[1:12:21] except a corn and wheat fall in the
[1:12:23] ground and die, it abides alone. What
[1:12:26] was he telling them?
[1:12:29] Gentiles, you're going to go through the
[1:12:32] same thing that I'm about to go through
[1:12:37] because now it's going to change from
[1:12:39] Jesus Christ the man into Jesus Christ
[1:12:43] the church.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; When it goes to the Gentiles,
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; And he's telling them, Gentiles, this is
[1:12:50] not your season.
[1:12:53] That's
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; This season is for the Jews because this
[1:12:56] is their three and a half years. you'll
[1:12:58] get your time.
[1:13:01] Go back and look for that seed and that
[1:13:06] resurrection power because it wasn't
[1:13:08] until after the resurrection the
[1:13:10] Gentiles could even have any
[1:13:13] comprehension of receiving Jesus Christ.
[1:13:16] Prophet of God said we were the ones
[1:13:18] wandering around with a club on our
[1:13:19] back. We weren't looking for a Messiah.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; We were looking for kingdoms. Babylon
[1:13:25] and Assyria and Egypt and Rome and
[1:13:28] Greece and
[1:13:30] we were only worry our only concern was
[1:13:33] worldly kingdoms
[1:13:35] and Jesus said accepted corn wheat falls
[1:13:38] in the ground and dies.
[1:13:40] So why is Paul saying this in to
[1:13:43] Timothy? Because the power of the
[1:13:46] resurrection for the gentile church is
[1:13:50] in the word that we speak.
[1:13:54] the power of the seed of David that
[1:13:59] raised up Jesus Christ from the dead
[1:14:03] according to the gospel of Paul.
[1:14:07] According to the gospel that we preach
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; right now has the power of resurrection
[1:14:14] in it.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] When they when Jesus went to the tomb of
[1:14:20] Lazarus, what did he say? And Martha
[1:14:24] came out. Oh, if you'd have been here,
[1:14:25] my brother would not be dead. You know,
[1:14:28] wouldn't have died. And and Jesus said,
[1:14:30] I am.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; The resurrection. So, who is the I am?
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection. Well, what came
[1:14:39] to Samuel? The I am.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Because it was the same God only in the
[1:14:45] form of the word. Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Came to Samuel.
[1:14:50] Came to Moses in vision and in other
[1:14:52] however ways different ways that he
[1:14:54] dealt with Moses. But to Samuel, God was
[1:14:58] revealed to him by the word.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And he's saying by the word, the I am
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; the resurrection.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; The power of the resurrection. It's not
[1:15:12] something. Yeah, there will be a
[1:15:14] resurrection.
[1:15:16] as far as you know an event that
[1:15:18] happens,
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; but it'll happen according to the word.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen by somebody's
[1:15:26] denominational idea. Sorry friends,
[1:15:29] forget it. It's not going to happen.
[1:15:31] It's just not going to be there. You
[1:15:33] know, you see, I've seen these pictures
[1:15:35] and you know, the Mormons, they have a
[1:15:37] certain way that they Oh, they're neat
[1:15:39] pictures.
[1:15:40] And the I believe it's the Seventh Day
[1:15:42] Adventist, you know, they have all these
[1:15:45] graves with people standing there and
[1:15:47] they look like little gophers or
[1:15:48] something. And no,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; no, friends, that's not it at all.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; We are stepping from this dimension into
[1:15:57] another dimension. That's right.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; And the power to do that is right here
[1:16:03] revealed
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; from this book.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:06] by the preaching of a man called Paul
[1:16:09] whom a prophet in this day said I
[1:16:12] preached what Paul preached. So where is
[1:16:15] the power of the resurrection?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And he also you know to continue that he
[1:16:23] said and I am the life.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; He that was alive
[1:16:30] shall never die. And what was the only
[1:16:32] thing the only requirement? You believe
[1:16:34] it. Yeah.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that the power of God is
[1:16:43] in this book that we preach?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Do we honestly
[1:16:48] believe?
[1:16:50] We've we've heard pray for revelation.
[1:16:53] You need it more than anything you can
[1:16:55] ever imagine.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how we read there
[1:17:02] um
[1:17:04] in Ephesians,
[1:17:08] how that
[1:17:13] boy
[1:17:16] was chapter one.
[1:17:19] He says that the God of our Lord Jesus
[1:17:21] Christ and the father of glory may give
[1:17:23] unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:17:26] revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; that your eyes of understanding might be
[1:17:34] enlightened that you might know what is
[1:17:35] the hope of his calling and the riches
[1:17:37] of his glory of his inheritance in the
[1:17:40] saints.
[1:17:41] What is the exceeding greatness of his
[1:17:44] power to us? Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; His power to us word
[1:17:51] what
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; to believe.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; His power to us word who believe.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I believe this gospel.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; I believe the power of God
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; is in the foolishness of preaching.
[1:18:05] Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; I believe that what Paul said, he knew
[1:18:09] what he was talking about
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; because the gentile church was going to
[1:18:12] have to go through the exact same thing
[1:18:14] because it was the seed of Jesus Christ
[1:18:16] that brought forth the gentile church.
[1:18:19] That's why the church had to go out and
[1:18:22] had to die and then begins to come forth
[1:18:25] stage after stage coming forth coming
[1:18:28] forth unto what we call the headstone or
[1:18:31] the capstone.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Capstone's not actually in the
[1:18:35] scripture. It's headstone. And when you
[1:18:37] look it up, it's a feminine word.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. That's exactly
[1:18:41] right.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Because in the in the language of the
[1:18:43] Hebrew, there's masculine words. There's
[1:18:46] feminine words. The headstone is a
[1:18:48] feminine word. Friends,
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; the bride is the headstone,
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; of Christ being revealed.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; By his power working in us that believe.
[1:19:04] Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; It's the power of God being revealed in
[1:19:11] what we call the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my fair one, come away. It says in
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Song of Solomon.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Why hideest thou in the cliffs of the
[1:19:24] rock? Come, my fair one. What causes
[1:19:28] that dove to come is the voice. the
[1:19:32] voice of my beloved
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Come away.
[1:19:37] Come away." The same voice that brought
[1:19:41] Jesus Christ on the scene through this
[1:19:44] by way of the seed of the life of David
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; is the same voice that will call us away
[1:19:50] as we believe according to this book
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; and according to the spirit of God upon
[1:19:57] us.
[1:20:02] And he continues there which we which he
[1:20:04] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:20:06] from the dead and set him at his own
[1:20:08] right hand in heavenly places.
[1:20:12] He showed this the revelation of God in
[1:20:15] Christ is now the revelation of Christ
[1:20:18] in the bride.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. That's right. The
[1:20:21] same revelation that res or brought
[1:20:23] Jesus Christ from the dead is the same
[1:20:26] revelation that will bring us from the
[1:20:28] dead because of Jesus Christ in us.
[1:20:31] Christ in you,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Christ in me, Christ in us,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:41] So he mentions there the power and I I
[1:20:43] wanted to read uh
[1:20:47] second Timothy first chapter
[1:20:51] because he said a very interesting thing
[1:20:53] going into there
[1:20:59] and that is in starting there
[1:21:02] he uses that word in verse in chap in
[1:21:05] number six there. Wherefore I put thee
[1:21:08] in remembrance that thou stir up the
[1:21:10] gift of God which is in thee.
[1:21:13] Here he says by the putting on of my
[1:21:16] hands. For God hath not given us the
[1:21:19] spirit of fear.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't give you a spirit of fear.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; We read that Jesus Christ took death.
[1:21:30] He paid for death. Death fell on Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ that the sons and daughters of
[1:21:36] God do not have to go through fear.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Of death.
[1:21:43] I felt the fear of death before.
[1:21:46] And it's I shook like a leaf.
[1:21:50] Should have been, you know, according to
[1:21:52] what you think of as natural science, I
[1:21:54] should have been dead.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; But God stepped in and took away that
[1:22:00] fear for a split second.
[1:22:02] And I walked away as though nothing
[1:22:03] happened. He did it in front of
[1:22:05] witnesses.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Three men saw it happen and they said,
[1:22:08] "You should be dead. Should have been a
[1:22:11] log hit me. I should have been like a
[1:22:12] bug on a windshield, man. Should have
[1:22:15] been done." But he said he didn't give
[1:22:17] you a spirit of fear.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; But
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; and they say that in the language of
[1:22:23] English, English language, that the word
[1:22:25] but means that it pretty much, you know,
[1:22:28] neglects the things that's before it. So
[1:22:30] that spirit of death, you don't even we
[1:22:32] don't have to even think about it.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Because what he gave us is a spirit of
[1:22:36] power
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; and love
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; and a sound mind. We read in in
[1:22:42] Ephesians here, I want you to have a
[1:22:44] revelation of God in your minds so you
[1:22:48] understand what's going on. Yeah.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; And so he's saying and and so God gave
[1:22:53] us a spirit not of fear but of power
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; and of love and of a sound mind. And as
[1:23:00] we look at just the simple definitions
[1:23:02] there uh the word power there is uh
[1:23:08] in and a sound mind it actually means to
[1:23:11] be able to control your spirit of
[1:23:13] feelings is one of the definitions.
[1:23:18] And I hate to say this, but I see it
[1:23:20] overseas a lot. And there's guys, they
[1:23:22] come out and they preach these big, you
[1:23:25] know, the the Bible says in another
[1:23:27] place, great swelling words and, you
[1:23:29] know, and the people, they run to the
[1:23:31] altar and they have their prayer lines
[1:23:33] and they do what they do.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; But that's not the point,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; right? That's it. I could care less
[1:23:40] about a prayer line than I care about
[1:23:42] the person that came in one way and when
[1:23:44] they walked out that door, their life
[1:23:46] was totally changed and they'll never be
[1:23:49] again the same again.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Because the power of God came into them
[1:23:55] and by the love of God and changed their
[1:23:59] mind.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's right.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "What is
[1:24:04] repentance?" It's the changing of the
[1:24:06] mind.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Peter said repent and be
[1:24:11] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:24:14] he's saying change your mind and come
[1:24:16] and get immersed into Jesus Christ.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; And that's enough to change because
[1:24:24] that's the love of God being expressed.
[1:24:26] And when you walk out those doors, if
[1:24:29] your life is changed, I'll know the love
[1:24:31] of God has touched you tonight in a way
[1:24:35] I couldn't touch you. What's that?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And there's a few other things it means
[1:24:42] to, you know, to control the feelings,
[1:24:45] to to curb the the middrift, to have a a
[1:24:49] disciplined mind, a correct mind. And
[1:24:51] the word power there, I found this
[1:24:54] interesting
[1:24:56] because it means it's a force. It's it's
[1:24:58] it's a strength. It's a spirit that
[1:25:01] moves. And as you begin to read through
[1:25:04] it, it's a power of the miraculous. A
[1:25:07] miracle was the word it used. Strength
[1:25:11] and a power that gives you the ability
[1:25:14] to not be timid,
[1:25:16] but timid concerning what?
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Timid concerning the word of God. Don't
[1:25:23] be timid with it. because it gives you
[1:25:27] the ability to call things or to call
[1:25:30] God as able to fulfill his promise.
[1:25:34] Remember Mad, Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:25:35] Abednego?
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Well, we don't know what's going to
[1:25:38] happen, but we really don't care because
[1:25:41] we know God is able.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; That's that's not really timid, is it?
[1:25:45] Where's the fire, man? We want to get on
[1:25:47] with this.
[1:25:50] And so it's a spirit of power to not be
[1:25:53] timid concerning the things of God. And
[1:25:56] that comes by way of the love of God.
[1:25:58] And the word there is agape, which is
[1:26:01] God's, you know, God's love. And it says
[1:26:05] uh, you know, a couple of the other
[1:26:07] words that went along with that is the
[1:26:09] the breath.
[1:26:11] What's in the breath?
[1:26:14] What do you you see that?
[1:26:17] No, you can't see it. What is it? It's
[1:26:19] air.
[1:26:20] Where is our meeting place with God?
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Where do we meet him? For this we say
[1:26:30] unto you by the word of the Lord.
[1:26:34] Praise the Lord. I'm sure you're
[1:26:35] familiar with that. And so
[1:26:39] also means charity or uh that possible
[1:26:44] was the the next the last word in that
[1:26:46] list there. And it means what was the
[1:26:48] the song that went around the world
[1:26:51] seven times? All things are possible.
[1:26:54] Only believe. What was the requirement
[1:26:57] for resurrection and life? Only believe.
[1:27:01] And so we see here he says that and then
[1:27:04] he said with this power that it's a
[1:27:07] power to to to receive to believe that
[1:27:10] all things are possible. But there's
[1:27:13] another part there that we'll we'll get
[1:27:16] to here in just a second because then it
[1:27:19] says the power of love and that was
[1:27:21] agape to do over to be a lover of God's
[1:27:25] word to be we God is doting or or or
[1:27:29] being so careful with his little bride
[1:27:33] because he loves you
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; right
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; it's his agape love that he is
[1:27:38] projecting to us how
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; through the seed of David.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Through the power of God that's in this
[1:27:46] book, he's he's doing was the word it
[1:27:48] used. Dope to dot over
[1:27:51] to to c to bring charity. And one of the
[1:27:54] other things there was to have a love
[1:27:56] feast. Well, then you go to the book of
[1:27:57] Jude and all of a sudden you see, you
[1:28:00] know, there's spots in he said in in
[1:28:02] your love feast. There are spots
[1:28:07] in the love feast of this hour. Yeah,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; there are spots that they don't control
[1:28:14] the emotions. I've been in services, we
[1:28:17] call it the message, friends. The guys
[1:28:20] were screaming so loud, I couldn't even
[1:28:22] tell you what the preacher was saying.
[1:28:24] That is not a spirit of control.
[1:28:29] In fact, it's out of control. The
[1:28:31] deacons should have took him out of the
[1:28:33] the the courtroom. Yeah, it's a court.
[1:28:36] It really is.
[1:28:39] said, "The judgment begins at the house
[1:28:40] of God."
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; They should have been escorted out.
[1:28:43] Said, "Hey, you're not under in control.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; You don't have a a spirit of a sound
[1:28:50] mind."
[1:28:52] Just my opinion. You don't have to
[1:28:53] believe that.
[1:28:55] But that was out of control. The love
[1:28:58] feast has its spots according to the
[1:29:00] book of Jude. But there's something
[1:29:02] else. Well, now we'll just Lord willing,
[1:29:04] we'll close here
[1:29:06] as we go back to John the first chapter
[1:29:10] because part of this what he's given us
[1:29:13] is a power,
[1:29:16] a spirit of love, a spirit of power.
[1:29:21] And in John the first chapter
[1:29:26] and
[1:29:28] I hear so many people preach about the
[1:29:31] first you know out of the first chapter
[1:29:33] of John and of course they should. It's
[1:29:36] such a beautiful chapter
[1:29:39] and it starts out as you all know in the
[1:29:41] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:29:43] with God. The word was God. The same was
[1:29:46] in the beginning with God. If you really
[1:29:48] want to go on off on a little different
[1:29:51] branch there, who's the beginning?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm the beginning. I am the
[1:29:58] beginning." So, and he is the word of
[1:30:00] God. And then it comes down, but in
[1:30:03] verse 12,
[1:30:06] to me, this is almost an ignored verse.
[1:30:10] But as many as received him, to them
[1:30:13] gave he power
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Even to them that have met the
[1:30:20] qualification of belief.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; I know I'm expanding.
[1:30:26] To them that believe, but believe on
[1:30:28] what? His name. And we've been told the
[1:30:30] name and the word.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Are the same thing. Yes, sir.
[1:30:36] And if we have received him,
[1:30:40] the word of God, the seed of David, and
[1:30:45] we have met the qualification that we
[1:30:47] believe it, we have now, according to
[1:30:51] Paul, received a a a mind,
[1:30:57] a mind that is conforming to the word of
[1:31:00] God, a mind that has the power to create
[1:31:04] or to make us
[1:31:08] h
[1:31:10] power to become the sons of God. The
[1:31:13] power to become sons of God lies in the
[1:31:18] word of God
[1:31:20] by as Paul said according to my gospel
[1:31:26] according to this gospel. And it was so
[1:31:29] important that in that catching up
[1:31:32] vision, whatever you want to call it, he
[1:31:35] turns back and he said, "I preached what
[1:31:38] Paul preached." Yeah.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; So the power the same power of the
[1:31:42] resurrection that was in according to
[1:31:45] Paul's gospel is the same power of
[1:31:48] resurrection that lives
[1:31:51] in the God of this message
[1:31:55] in the God of what I have received and
[1:31:58] what you have received. If we if thou
[1:32:01] can't believe all things are possible.
[1:32:06] The power of resurrection is here.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; It's not Yeah, it was back there. And
[1:32:13] yeah, it is up there, but it's also
[1:32:16] right here.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; If thou can't believe. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:22] Sister, why don't you come to the piano?
[1:32:26] Otherwise, I might, you know, like I
[1:32:28] said, I missed a few weeks.
[1:32:32] Might go a long ways.
[1:32:35] God bless you. Let's just stand. Let's
[1:32:37] sing that song once more. I love that
[1:32:39] song. And we, you know, first time I
[1:32:41] ever heard it, uh, Lord, you are so
[1:32:43] precious. And I think I've probably said
[1:32:47] this here before, but I I learned it in
[1:32:48] Madagascar. And I learned it in the
[1:32:51] Malagasi language. And in that language,
[1:32:54] it's Jehosho
[1:32:57] siri kuo
[1:33:00] and
[1:33:02] tiao. So if you want to say I love you
[1:33:04] to somebody in Malagas, you just say tia
[1:33:07] cano.
[1:33:09] And uh so Lord,
[1:33:12] you are
[1:33:15] so preious
[1:33:18] to me.
[1:33:23] Lord,
[1:33:25] you are
[1:33:28] so preious
[1:33:32] to me. When love projects, love
[1:33:39] you.
[1:33:42] Yes, I love
[1:33:46] you
[1:33:49] because
[1:33:52] you first
[1:33:54] loved
[1:33:56] me.
[1:34:01] Oh Lord,
[1:34:04] you are
[1:34:08] so graceious
[1:34:11] to me.
[1:34:15] Lord,
[1:34:17] you are
[1:34:21] so graceious
[1:34:24] to me
[1:34:27] and I love
[1:34:31] you.
[1:34:34] Yes, I love
[1:34:38] you
[1:34:40] because
[1:34:44] you first
[1:34:46] loved
[1:34:47] me.
[1:34:51] I'll sing it for you and we'll do it
[1:34:53] once more and I'll I'll sing it in
[1:34:55] Malagasi. It's a beautiful language. You
[1:34:58] go ahead and sing in English or Spanish
[1:35:00] or whatever. We did that once at Brother
[1:35:02] Riches. We sang in seven different
[1:35:04] languages at the same time. First two or
[1:35:07] three times through it was pretty rough.
[1:35:10] But when the Holy Spirit came down
[1:35:12] because when you project your love to
[1:35:14] him, he answers with the love of God in
[1:35:18] the Holy Spirit. And by the last two or
[1:35:20] three times we sang it, it was like one
[1:35:23] voice.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; So let's sing it once more.
[1:35:27] He so
[1:35:30] he
[1:35:34] sitt
[1:35:37] I'm
[1:35:41] J. So,
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:48] I'm cool. I'm
[1:35:59] tea.
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:03] Oh
[1:36:06] tree
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:11] me allow.
[1:36:20] You are
[1:36:24] so preious
[1:36:27] to me, brother.
[1:36:30] Oh Lord,
[1:36:33] you are
[1:36:36] so preious.
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:43] I love
[1:36:46] you.
[1:36:49] Yes, I love
[1:36:53] you
[1:36:56] because
[1:36:58] you first
[1:37:01] love
[1:37:02] me
[1:37:07] and I love
[1:37:11] you.
[1:37:13] Yes, I love
[1:37:17] you.
[1:37:20] because
[1:37:23] you first
[1:37:25] loved me.
[1:37:30] God bless you. Thank you for your time
[1:37:32] for coming out.
[1:37:35] I love you.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; And just remember when love projects,
[1:37:40] it's like the echo is one place in the
[1:37:44] Bible. It says that when the voice
[1:37:46] speaks, the vi the bride's recovery is
[1:37:50] the echo. It's the same voice going back
[1:37:52] to him that came to us. It's the love of
[1:37:55] God in Jesus Christ. Let's pick up the
[1:37:58] speed here. Do you know that I am
[1:37:59] resolved? And I'll hand it over to
[1:38:01] Isaac, my son.
[1:38:04] I am resolved no longer to linger,
[1:38:09] charmed by the world's delight.
[1:38:14] Things that are higher, things that are
[1:38:18] no, these have a Lord. God bless you.
[1:38:25] I will hasten to him. Hasten so glad and
[1:38:33] free.
[1:38:36] Jesus
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:38] greatest high.
[1:38:41] I will come to thee.
[1:38:46] I am resolved to go to the Savior,
[1:38:51] leaving my sin and stri.
[1:38:57] He is the true one. He is the just one.
[1:39:02] He hath the words of life.
[1:39:07] I will hasten to him. Hasten so and
[1:39:15] free.
[1:39:18] Jesus
[1:39:20] greatest, highest,
[1:39:23] I will come to thee.
[1:39:28] I am resolved to follow the Savior,
[1:39:33] faithful and true each day.
[1:39:39] Heat what he sayith, do what he will. He
[1:39:44] is a livinging way.
[1:39:49] I will hasten to him. Hasten so glad and
[1:39:57] free.
[1:39:59] Jesus
[1:40:02] greatest, highest, I will come to thee.
[1:40:10] I am resolved to enter the kingdom.
[1:40:15] Uning my paths of sin
[1:40:21] may oppose me, foes may beset me. Still
[1:40:26] I will enter in.
[1:40:31] I will hasten to him. Amazing so glad
[1:40:38] and free.
[1:40:41] Jesus
[1:40:44] greatest highest I will come to thee.
[1:40:52] I am resolved and who will go with me.
[1:40:57] Come friends without delay.
[1:41:02] taught by the Bible, led by the spirit.
[1:41:08] Will walk the heavenly way.
[1:41:13] I will hasten to him. Hasten so glad and
[1:41:20] free.
[1:41:23] Jesus
[1:41:26] greatest highest. I will come to thee.
[1:41:35] Amen.
[1:41:36] Amen. Hallelujah. Did you enjoy that?
[1:41:40] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:41:42] Amen. I amum. Greater is he that is in
[1:41:46] me.
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:55] Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to
[1:42:00] and fro
[1:42:03] seeking whom he made devout. The Bible
[1:42:08] tells me so.
[1:42:11] Many souls have been his prey to fall in
[1:42:16] some weak hour.
[1:42:19] But God has given us today his
[1:42:24] overcoming
[1:42:26] power.
[1:42:28] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:42:32] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:42:36] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:42:40] is in the world.
[1:42:44] On the day of Pentecost,
[1:42:47] a rushing mighty wind
[1:42:51] blew into the upper room and baptized
[1:42:57] all of them
[1:42:59] with a power greater than any earthly
[1:43:05] flow.
[1:43:07] And I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm
[1:43:11] going to let the whole world know.
[1:43:15] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:43:19] Greater is he that is in me.

[1:43:27] is in the world.
[1:43:30] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:43:34] Greater is he that is in me.
