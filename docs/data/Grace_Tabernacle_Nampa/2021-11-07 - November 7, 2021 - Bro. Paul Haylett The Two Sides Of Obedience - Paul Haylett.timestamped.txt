[35:40] rich is
[35:44] is
[35:51] [Music]
[35:58] [Music]
[36:10] was
[36:19] one more
[36:23] time and
[36:29] [Applause]
[36:31] [Music]
[36:35] i
[36:40] [Music]
[36:48] heaven came down
[36:56] isn't that beautiful
[36:58] amen heaven truly has come down
[37:00] hallelujah
[37:02] it's uh interesting i just early this
[37:05] morning
[37:06] i was uh in my studies
[37:09] just looking at that and that song in my
[37:11] studies this morning would have went
[37:12] perfect together
[37:15] but uh just good to be here this morning
[37:17] can we say amen
[37:19] to be in the house of the lord today i
[37:21] just want to remember those that are not
[37:23] with us just as we're sitting there
[37:25] thinking about brother pershant sister
[37:28] akoncha all the way down in
[37:30] california just believing
[37:33] that the lord would
[37:35] just answer their prayer and uh
[37:38] i just remember brother prashant telling
[37:40] me one time he said brother paul he said
[37:42] i
[37:43] i just like to be free from you know the
[37:45] confines of the green card work visa
[37:49] uh you know just like to be free to be
[37:51] able to just
[37:53] go
[37:54] where our hearts are to to live where
[37:56] our hearts are and so let's be faithful
[37:58] to remember brother prashant's sister
[38:00] concha that
[38:01] the whole visa the whole thing it's
[38:04] interesting now uh this will sound
[38:06] political but i just want you to just
[38:09] catch how the spirits of the day are
[38:11] so here is brother perchant
[38:14] uh just incredible in his knowledge you
[38:16] know i remember one day we're sitting
[38:18] there and he's talking about how brother
[38:20] paul i said break it down real small for
[38:22] me
[38:23] brother personally so i can understand
[38:25] it he says brother paul we'd take a
[38:27] grain of sand and give it memory
[38:31] okay that's that's small enough for paul
[38:33] paul can do that so none of the sand
[38:36] that i deal with has any memory at all
[38:38] but anyway let's just remember them and
[38:41] it seems a paradox right a man who's
[38:43] contributing to the economy and to you
[38:45] might say technology and knowledge
[38:48] that's in the world today is
[38:50] on such a constraint but
[38:52] um pardon me for putting this way i
[38:54] don't mean to just be funny but i've
[38:56] seen a little a little meme or whatever
[38:59] four guys all dressed up and they said
[39:01] we're gonna go to mexico and sneak back
[39:03] into the united states so that we can
[39:05] receive all these things from our
[39:07] government
[39:08] and uh it just is a paradox right a man
[39:11] contributing can't hardly become legal
[39:13] but they're offering legality to
[39:16] anybody and everybody that wants to
[39:17] sneak in
[39:18] so let's lift them up in prayer
[39:20] so
[39:21] i might not get brother dan's name right
[39:24] sister kristin might have to speak it
[39:26] out for me but our brother dan rubelke
[39:31] ruboki
[39:32] um him and brother rodney brander was
[39:35] here a few wednesday nights ago
[39:38] and uh
[39:41] they're you know down in in phoenix and
[39:43] they were traveling come in those of you
[39:45] is here that wednesday it was good to
[39:47] see them
[39:48] and uh i have especially fond memory of
[39:51] uh brother dan in the sense that he
[39:53] takes copper wire and he twists it up
[39:56] and makes little
[39:57] things out of it and
[39:59] he had gave me a little uh scorpion that
[40:03] he had
[40:04] rolled up out of wire and it's just a
[40:06] beautiful little thing
[40:07] very artistic
[40:09] but we were visiting and um
[40:12] in the foyer and we were talking and i
[40:14] made a comment and he says well brother
[40:15] paul
[40:16] uh it was actually another poem that he
[40:19] says you know fit with what you said
[40:20] tonight and then he shared this and if
[40:23] brother mason will put that poem uh up
[40:25] on the screen i i just thought it was uh
[40:28] just a beautiful thing
[40:30] uh that i wanted to just share that with
[40:33] you
[40:35] and uh
[40:36] i know there'll be those of you that
[40:38] have already read the first paragraph
[40:41] but um we'll just go ahead and read it
[40:43] to you
[40:44] amen
[40:46] the words effect now let me just bring
[40:50] this to you
[40:51] the word was intended to have an effect
[40:53] on us correct
[40:55] not for us to read it and forget it but
[40:57] it was meant to be life-changing it was
[41:00] meant to
[41:02] for us to stop
[41:04] and say that applies to me
[41:06] thank you lord
[41:08] oh and that is whether it's correcting
[41:10] you or just simply blessing your soul we
[41:13] say thank you lord
[41:14] and so this had a a lovely effect upon
[41:17] me as i was reading it and then brother
[41:20] dan ended up giving me a copy of that
[41:25] the words effect things are said
[41:28] in such a way
[41:30] to cause some to go
[41:32] and some to stay
[41:34] some will look and never see
[41:37] god's unfolding mystery
[41:40] what's required to be god's wife
[41:43] is it the truth or is it
[41:46] the life amen
[41:48] if we live in the word and the word
[41:51] lived in us it's a living epistle all
[41:54] can trust
[41:56] our lives in journey we can see
[41:58] from mortal man
[42:00] to theophany word on word
[42:03] outlives transformed
[42:06] back to the mind of god we are conformed
[42:10] the life of our sacrifice
[42:13] on display
[42:15] she is he
[42:17] in this day
[42:19] we have walked through time and time is
[42:22] done
[42:22] omega god at the evening sun
[42:26] she's fully dressed for all to see she's
[42:29] pure she's white
[42:30] she's heavenly amen amen
[42:33] part of this struck me because there
[42:35] will be a portion of what we're going to
[42:37] speak this morning that will fit right
[42:40] in line with this my brother and sister
[42:42] because you see in the day that we're
[42:45] living we look and we say well you know
[42:47] people are not seeing this word or they
[42:49] see portions of it or they want to
[42:52] conform it to themselves but remember
[42:54] the prophet of god showed us so clearly
[42:56] that the spirits of the ages have never
[43:00] died
[43:02] they are here everyone that they dealt
[43:05] with through the ages is right here in
[43:07] the day that we live in
[43:09] and having the same similar effect
[43:13] so when a spirit was sent forth
[43:16] uh and released
[43:17] and it went out to anoint people to
[43:20] whether it be murder or whatever it
[43:22] might be that spirit today has still
[43:25] been released
[43:27] affecting people causing them to dwell
[43:29] in that same realm
[43:31] so you'll see now that as the spirits
[43:34] are moving through the day
[43:36] god when he
[43:38] brought up
[43:39] and placed and set it in order
[43:42] and our lord jesus come now as the
[43:44] reflection of the manifested body of
[43:46] christ
[43:48] uh of god in the day and walked among us
[43:50] right it says the word was
[43:52] made flesh
[43:55] everything he said in order my brother
[43:57] and sister you can say well he was
[43:58] speaking to the sadducees and the
[44:00] pharisees
[44:02] he was speaking to the spirit
[44:06] he didn't pick a certain man and say
[44:07] like i'm speaking to you
[44:10] he was speaking to the spirit
[44:12] and so as it is that same word that was
[44:15] spoken then has come right down in full
[44:18] manifestation into the day that we live
[44:21] in and is dealing with the spirits of
[44:24] our day
[44:25] so therefore we have to have we need no
[44:27] hesitation to take that word and say
[44:30] lord it worked then and i'll apply it
[44:33] today just as it was applied then
[44:35] because you see the word that loosed
[44:37] those spirits and set men and women free
[44:40] were there again not dealing with the
[44:42] woman at the well not dealing with this
[44:44] one not dealing with that one it was
[44:46] dealing with the spirit
[44:48] and so it was the spirit of life the
[44:50] spirit of god in them the spirit of
[44:52] christ if you want to put it that way in
[44:54] them that he was speaking to and so as
[44:57] that same spirit lives in full authority
[45:00] and power today the word is still
[45:02] speaking to the very spirit that is in
[45:04] you and i
[45:05] amen as sons and daughters of god the
[45:07] holy ghost is coming still stirring
[45:10] still moving still calling still drawing
[45:13] and still working
[45:14] amen and so we deal in this realm of the
[45:17] spirits we often times
[45:20] look and we get caught in the realm of
[45:22] the flesh and we think well it's this
[45:23] person it's that person stop stop stop
[45:27] that person
[45:29] delivered of that spirit
[45:33] the man in the tombs
[45:36] they didn't know how to deal with him
[45:37] when he went back home
[45:39] it was easier to deal with him as that
[45:42] crazy man
[45:44] and then isolate him
[45:46] but what happens when that man comes
[45:48] back in
[45:49] to their very midst to his very home his
[45:52] very street
[45:53] and starts talking
[45:54] about the power of the man
[45:57] called
[45:58] jesus and they themselves
[46:01] not believers
[46:04] they still had to put him in the box
[46:07] and isolate him
[46:09] so the difference of their isolation was
[46:12] not of whether he was insane
[46:14] or whether he was delivered
[46:17] the isolation was actually of their own
[46:20] creation
[46:22] they either received or rejected based
[46:25] upon their own thoughts and their own
[46:26] ideals and their own does that make
[46:28] sense
[46:29] well let's just stand and go into the
[46:31] word this morning i want to speak to you
[46:33] thank you brother jason sister emmy sean
[46:36] appreciate that amen i missed heidi
[46:39] i thought i thought she had a spot right
[46:41] over here on the corner but i was
[46:43] mistaken
[46:44] amen
[46:46] uh let's learn in our bibles the two
[46:48] sides of obedience we want to look at
[46:50] this this morning and i pray by god's
[46:52] grace i can articulate it to you
[46:55] to realize the two sides of obedience
[46:57] and we'll turn in our bibles to acts the
[46:59] fifth chapter starting with the 25th
[47:02] verse
[47:03] amen her lovely reports of the uh
[47:07] are our young people's participation in
[47:10] i don't know what do you call that
[47:11] uh junior hammers but is that a recital
[47:13] is that a performance whatever it is
[47:16] just
[47:16] hear a lovely report of the beautiful
[47:19] music and uh
[47:21] just uh
[47:22] thank the lord for the talent that god
[47:24] has placed in our midst and
[47:27] uh
[47:28] my i hope you don't mind but i'm still
[47:30] waiting for those that were singing this
[47:32] special
[47:32] at brother sergey and julia's house here
[47:35] recently to um appear in church
[47:38] amen
[47:39] acts the fifth chapter the 25th verse
[47:43] amen
[47:48] so what we're looking at here is
[47:50] uh we'll focus as it were and i'll use
[47:53] peter as a reference point
[47:56] uh to just keep it concise so here we
[47:58] see that peter they're acting upon the
[48:01] word upon the commission given them and
[48:03] they've been preaching and and those in
[48:05] the community
[48:06] in authority didn't like that and you
[48:08] know had them thrown in prison
[48:11] and uh you know they're going to silence
[48:13] my brother and sister they're going to
[48:14] do their very best to silence what god
[48:18] is doing
[48:19] in a
[48:20] humanistic
[48:22] way
[48:24] so we want to silence them we'll throw
[48:26] them in prison
[48:28] we're going to silence the move of god
[48:29] we're going to put a halt to the move of
[48:31] god in our day by beheading killing
[48:35] burning doing all of but they don't
[48:37] realize see they can't catch the
[48:39] understanding that the move of god is
[48:42] not a flesh and blood thing
[48:45] it is god himself moving in the midst
[48:48] and so now they've thrown him in prison
[48:50] and we'll start here in verse 25 he says
[48:52] then came one and told them saying
[48:54] behold the men whom he put in prison are
[48:57] standing in the temple
[48:59] and teaching the people
[49:01] imagine the confusion they had look we
[49:03] turned the key we know they are locked
[49:05] up they're silenced but now they're
[49:08] suddenly standing in the temple
[49:10] then with the captain with the officers
[49:12] and brought them without violence for
[49:14] they feared the people lest they should
[49:16] have been stoned
[49:18] and when they had brought them they set
[49:20] them before the council and the high
[49:21] priest asked them saying did we not
[49:24] straightly command you that ye should
[49:26] not teach in this name and behold you
[49:29] have filled jerusalem with your doctrine
[49:32] and intend to bring this man's blood
[49:34] upon us
[49:35] then peter and the other apostles
[49:37] answered and said
[49:39] we
[49:40] ought to obey god
[49:42] rather than man
[49:45] that's a pretty strong when you really
[49:47] think about those words a pretty strong
[49:49] rebuttal
[49:50] to what they've been told
[49:54] the god of our fathers
[49:57] raised up jesus
[49:58] whom ye slew and hanged on the tree
[50:03] and him hath god exalted with his right
[50:06] hand
[50:07] to be prince and a savior for to
[50:10] repentance to israel
[50:15] oh where we at here yes
[50:18] okay
[50:20] we are witnesses of these things and so
[50:23] also
[50:24] right hand to be prince and savior for
[50:26] to give repentance to israel and
[50:28] forgiveness of sins and we are his
[50:30] witnesses of these things now i want you
[50:33] to key in on this what they're declaring
[50:35] is is we have not come in our own name
[50:38] we have not come in our own authority
[50:40] we've not come in our own program we
[50:43] simply came as witnesses
[50:45] and i pray today that we could as a
[50:47] little group of believers this morning
[50:49] say we are here as his witnesses amen of
[50:54] the power of the saving grace of our
[50:56] lord jesus christ
[50:58] amen as a healer and i believe we can
[51:00] lift hands and say yes witnesses of
[51:02] healing a witnesses of deliverance
[51:05] witnesses of provision witnesses of
[51:08] every promise that there is amen we are
[51:11] his witnesses of these things and so
[51:13] also the holy ghost
[51:16] whom god hath given to them that obey
[51:18] him
[51:20] so now we look at this and i don't want
[51:22] to preach this but i just don't want to
[51:23] skip over this key point the holy ghost
[51:26] now in this scripture is very much
[51:29] connected as being given to those who
[51:32] obey
[51:34] there's not another avenue doesn't say
[51:36] to those who made great donation a great
[51:39] give a great amount of time uh whatever
[51:42] it would be it's to those that are
[51:45] obedient
[51:46] amen
[51:47] so
[51:49] when they had heard that they were cut
[51:51] to the heart and took counsel to slay
[51:53] them and they stood there up one in the
[51:56] council a pharisee
[51:58] named camille
[51:59] a doctor of the law and had in
[52:02] reputation among all the people in other
[52:04] words well respected
[52:05] and commanded to put the apostles forth
[52:08] a little space and said unto them ye men
[52:11] of israel take heed to yourselves what
[52:13] that you intend to do as touching these
[52:16] men
[52:19] look at this
[52:20] for before these days now what does he
[52:22] do saints
[52:23] he doesn't tell him by opinion
[52:28] he doesn't tell him by the law of the
[52:30] church but he brings them under
[52:33] anointing to real life
[52:36] experience
[52:39] now if i was to ask you just a simple
[52:40] question this morning do we really
[52:43] believe that god is a healer
[52:47] now why would we do that
[52:51] we have
[52:52] in us a desire to believe the word
[52:55] but see the mercy of god
[52:58] he can take it right back to experience
[53:02] we are a people of experience
[53:06] god didn't say just blindly follow me
[53:08] although by faith we would blindly
[53:10] follow him does that make sense
[53:12] by real true faith in the word we would
[53:15] just follow him because he said so but
[53:17] god is gracious knowing we in our
[53:19] humanity and says i'll give you
[53:21] experience
[53:23] ever been
[53:25] in a situation where maybe you felt
[53:27] bound that song you know some midnight
[53:29] hour
[53:30] if you should find
[53:32] you're in a prison
[53:33] in your mind
[53:35] i believe we can all say we've been
[53:37] there
[53:38] and i want to ask you by experience is
[53:41] he a deliverer
[53:43] see we can stand upon that so now we'll
[53:47] see
[53:47] that it's there that gamil is i didn't
[53:50] pronounce that right i even listened on
[53:52] the internet ten times the pronunciation
[53:55] of his name and i still can't get it
[53:57] right
[53:58] just like our brother
[54:00] but
[54:01] he gives an example for before these
[54:04] days in other words in the past rose up
[54:06] thudius boasting himself to be somebody
[54:09] to whom a number of men about four
[54:11] hundred joined themselves now you think
[54:13] about that four hundred throw in some
[54:15] wife throwing some kids that's a pretty
[54:17] good-sized church
[54:21] join themselves who is slain in all as
[54:23] many as
[54:26] obeyed him
[54:29] see the two sides of obedience here
[54:33] we're scattered and brought to naught
[54:35] after this
[54:37] man rose up judas of galilee in the days
[54:39] of the taxing and drew away much people
[54:42] after him he also perished and all even
[54:45] as many as
[54:46] obeyed him
[54:49] were dispersed
[54:51] and now i say unto you refrain from
[54:53] these men
[54:54] and speaking of the apostles and let
[54:56] them alone for if this counsel
[55:00] oh look how god includes them drew the
[55:03] circle not around
[55:06] peter
[55:08] and the apostles
[55:09] but included the very counsel
[55:13] into this judgment
[55:16] to me i find it so remarkable
[55:18] amen for if this counsel or this work
[55:23] be of men it will come to not
[55:26] but if it be of god you cannot overthrow
[55:28] it lest happily ye be found even to
[55:30] fight against god
[55:32] and to them they agreed it made sense
[55:34] right
[55:35] he is speaking as one respected a voice
[55:39] that they are willing to submit to
[55:44] do you catch this
[55:46] they
[55:47] obeyed him
[55:54] and to him they agreed and when they had
[55:56] called the apostles
[55:58] and i love this way of getting your
[56:00] point across
[56:02] and beaten them
[56:04] we want you to know that our church has
[56:06] the right spirit so as you leave our
[56:09] church our group we're going to beat you
[56:13] just so you'll know it's of god
[56:18] i've met them people
[56:21] they commanded that they should not
[56:22] speak in the name of jesus christ
[56:25] and let them go
[56:26] and they departed from the presence of
[56:29] the council
[56:30] rejoicing oh saints i hope we have this
[56:33] spirit rejoicing that they were counted
[56:36] worthy to suffer shame for his name
[56:40] and then
[56:41] you can see how well they obeyed and
[56:44] daily in the temple and in every house
[56:46] they ceased not to teach and preach
[56:49] jesus christ
[56:50] heavenly father we just ask for your
[56:52] leadership your guidance today lord how
[56:55] gracious you are to us
[56:57] how loving how kind how faithful
[57:00] lord when i just think
[57:03] as the song says when i think of the
[57:05] goodness of jesus
[57:07] father my heart would take that in
[57:09] another chorus when i think of the
[57:11] patience
[57:12] of jesus when i think of the love
[57:15] of jesus
[57:16] and truly your goodness
[57:18] father we thank you for that and ask for
[57:20] your leadership your guidance today
[57:23] speak to the hearts of your saints lord
[57:26] those who are not here today i pray your
[57:27] holy spirit just move around surround
[57:30] them father and stir hearts and fill us
[57:33] lord with your presence
[57:35] lord not just your presence that would
[57:37] fade away but the enduring presence of
[57:40] our lord jesus christ which is the holy
[57:42] ghost
[57:43] to go with us and lead us every day we
[57:46] love you lord thank you now in the name
[57:48] of jesus christ amen
[57:50] you may be seated saints
[57:56] now as we would look
[57:59] at this my brother and sister
[58:01] we would want to
[58:03] just kind of take a little stroll
[58:06] uh through this scripture and uh
[58:09] i must admit you know this whole
[58:12] um
[58:13] this whole time change is
[58:16] is um
[58:18] was kind of nice
[58:20] but it had me very confused as i'm
[58:22] wandering around the house with my coat
[58:24] on and my bible laying there and
[58:27] sister han is like
[58:28] we're leaving right now and i looked at
[58:30] the clock and it's like
[58:33] yeah in just like an hour
[58:36] real soon real soon
[58:39] so you know i got a little flustered
[58:41] this morning you know because just it
[58:43] seemed like my internal clock was off
[58:45] but we'll just ask the lord to just come
[58:47] down and and kind of calm our spirit and
[58:50] and be able to uh uh uh
[58:52] go into the word
[58:54] um and so i want to just go back into
[58:57] the scripture uh and uh i want to tie in
[59:00] uh at verse 28 if the brothers would
[59:02] take us there and we would see my
[59:05] brother and sister uh of what is
[59:07] happening uh in this
[59:10] so it's there that the these apostles
[59:13] they throw it in prison and um
[59:16] it isn't so much that these men were
[59:18] there but i want you in verse 28 to look
[59:21] at this saying did we not straightly
[59:23] command you in other words they were not
[59:26] asking for obedience they were demanding
[59:29] obedience that we told you not to speak
[59:32] not to preach not to do this
[59:34] and uh that you should not teach in this
[59:37] name see they wouldn't even name the
[59:38] name and behold you filled jerusalem
[59:41] with your doctrine you you have done
[59:43] this but my brother and sister if we'll
[59:45] go back and let me just kind of touch
[59:47] upon your memory the prophet of god said
[59:50] it's not so much what we say as what we
[59:52] do
[59:53] so i have to believe that going into
[59:55] this scripture that the life of jesus
[59:58] christ was moving through jerusalem
[1:00:01] after as it were his death and burial
[1:00:04] and resurrection and his ascension the
[1:00:07] life was moving through jerusalem and
[1:00:09] what frustrated the pharisees is there's
[1:00:12] nothing they can do
[1:00:14] about the life
[1:00:17] they can lock people up in prison and
[1:00:19] the life is still there
[1:00:21] they can do everything they want to do
[1:00:23] the life is still there and my brother
[1:00:25] and sister we live in the day that we
[1:00:27] live in and how the strong spirit of
[1:00:30] religion is upon the land but the life
[1:00:33] my brother and sister is still living
[1:00:35] and is still in demonstration regardless
[1:00:38] of what is done and so you know we look
[1:00:40] at this and they said you know we told
[1:00:42] you not to do this you filled jerusalem
[1:00:44] with your doctrine and intend to bring
[1:00:47] this man's blood
[1:00:49] upon us
[1:00:50] oh my brother and sister we'll look in
[1:00:53] just a minute and delve deeper into this
[1:00:56] but it's there that we have to
[1:00:58] understand
[1:00:59] that the very intent uh and the reason i
[1:01:02] was confused trying to tell you i kind
[1:01:04] of got almost two sets of notes and some
[1:01:06] are here and some are there and they're
[1:01:07] speaking of the same things and and i i
[1:01:10] kind of needed to reconcile those but i
[1:01:12] started well anyway
[1:01:15] anyway anyway anyway
[1:01:17] but you look at this see so it's there
[1:01:19] that that they are saying you know what
[1:01:21] you're you're intending to bring his
[1:01:25] blood this man's blood upon us but you
[1:01:27] know that is the very reason of the
[1:01:30] preaching of the gospel is to bring the
[1:01:33] blood of jesus christ upon mankind amen
[1:01:36] so it's there that there is a push back
[1:01:39] we we we don't want we don't want this
[1:01:41] blood upon us
[1:01:43] we don't want to to be partakers we
[1:01:46] don't want to have the
[1:01:48] responsibility and uh you know peter in
[1:01:51] them i'm just gonna go over this and
[1:01:53] we'll hit it again kind of coming back
[1:01:55] and they answered and said you know what
[1:01:57] we're gonna obey god rather than men so
[1:01:59] what you have commanded just kind of
[1:02:01] went in one ear and out the other what
[1:02:03] you have said you must we must do is not
[1:02:06] applicable to us you you might be
[1:02:08] speaking to mere mortal men you might be
[1:02:10] speaking to the carnal man but we are of
[1:02:13] a higher calling we are of a priesthood
[1:02:16] and we are going to follow the calling
[1:02:18] in our life regardless of what you think
[1:02:22] and so it's in that realm that uh
[1:02:24] obviously these men very high authority
[1:02:27] and uh they they don't want to uh have
[1:02:30] men telling them we're not listening to
[1:02:32] you because they're used to
[1:02:34] the instantaneous obedience
[1:02:38] now my brother and sister we'll look in
[1:02:39] the world today and we don't have a time
[1:02:41] this morning uh as it would be very
[1:02:43] drawn out in the world today
[1:02:46] there is conformity
[1:02:48] not conversion
[1:02:51] so we have to be very careful that we're
[1:02:54] not conforming
[1:02:56] what we're looking for is a true
[1:02:58] conversion
[1:02:59] amen we don't want to conform to the
[1:03:01] gospel of jesus christ we want a
[1:03:03] conversion to the gospel of jesus christ
[1:03:05] and too many people spend and this i
[1:03:08] don't mean to speak in a negative aspect
[1:03:10] this morning but too many people spend
[1:03:12] too many years of their life conforming
[1:03:14] to the message and come to a place in
[1:03:17] their life they can no longer empower
[1:03:19] themselves to conform but there's no
[1:03:22] foundation no conversion there to hold
[1:03:25] them and when they give up on the
[1:03:27] conforming they're gone
[1:03:31] but catch this now
[1:03:33] they just move to the next stage and
[1:03:35] conform to something else
[1:03:41] no child has been born that says i want
[1:03:44] to disfigure my body
[1:03:49] it's a conforming
[1:03:51] i love this i hope you have a sense of
[1:03:53] humor this morning but i love this
[1:03:56] you see these young men with their pants
[1:03:58] hanging down and their bloomers hanging
[1:04:00] out over that and i don't know they must
[1:04:02] use a safety pin or something to keep
[1:04:04] them things up but you know they walk
[1:04:06] like this with their knees out otherwise
[1:04:08] their pants fall down
[1:04:10] and they say this is my identity
[1:04:13] as they walk
[1:04:14] with 25 others who look just like them
[1:04:20] you see that's not a real identity
[1:04:21] that's a conforming
[1:04:24] now i believe that was brother donny
[1:04:25] reagan that said one time and if it
[1:04:27] wasn't brother i know it was brother
[1:04:28] donny i said you know if god had called
[1:04:31] you sisters
[1:04:34] to go and you're in the grocery store
[1:04:37] store and you got hair about as short as
[1:04:39] mine and you were called to have purple
[1:04:42] hair and you know green eyelashes and
[1:04:45] this and that and tattoos all over you
[1:04:48] if that's what god called you to do
[1:04:51] the devil would have you here in a long
[1:04:54] skirt with long hair
[1:04:57] yeah do you catch the point he's making
[1:05:00] see regardless of what it is god called
[1:05:02] you to do the devil is going to come and
[1:05:03] anoint or
[1:05:05] cause them to conform to something
[1:05:08] different
[1:05:10] so to me i remember you know thinking
[1:05:12] about that i thought isn't that right it
[1:05:13] doesn't matter what it is that the word
[1:05:15] of god is called
[1:05:17] the devil will be there to anoint to
[1:05:19] conform to something else
[1:05:21] amen so you look at that and and you see
[1:05:24] now
[1:05:24] i want to and as i said we'll touch on
[1:05:27] this again real quick here but verse 32
[1:05:30] uh he says you know we're witnesses of
[1:05:32] these things now my brother and sister
[1:05:34] uh there's no two witnesses see the
[1:05:36] exact same thing right many years ago
[1:05:39] there was a bank robbery here in town
[1:05:42] and um you know they they uh this is
[1:05:44] when they first started to separating
[1:05:46] the witnesses to things like this and so
[1:05:48] they took these people that were in the
[1:05:50] bank and uh it happened to be my banker
[1:05:52] that was robbed but they they separated
[1:05:55] them and then they asked them
[1:05:56] individually now this robber
[1:05:59] um what did he look like and some said
[1:06:02] well it was this way and some said now
[1:06:04] get this some said he's wearing a
[1:06:05] button-up shirt and some said he's
[1:06:07] wearing a t-shirt and some said he had
[1:06:09] white tennis shoes on and some said he
[1:06:11] had blue tennis shoes on and and you do
[1:06:13] this but as the police through
[1:06:15] experience took each one of these
[1:06:17] people's deals they would find that out
[1:06:19] of the 12 people or whatever number it
[1:06:21] was if you follow me uh they said well
[1:06:24] you know what there is six of them said
[1:06:26] he had blue tennis shoes on
[1:06:28] and there's so many said that he had
[1:06:31] not a shirt not a button-up shirt but he
[1:06:33] was wearing a certain color t-shirt
[1:06:37] and they start doing that and because of
[1:06:39] the preponderance of the evidence they
[1:06:41] start putting together an image of this
[1:06:44] individual and so it's there you think
[1:06:47] well 12 people saw a man with a gun
[1:06:49] standing in a bank it would be clear
[1:06:52] that you should be able to say blah blah
[1:06:54] blah
[1:06:55] he wore this and he wore this and he
[1:06:57] wore this and he wore this and maybe
[1:06:59] even somebody would say oh he was
[1:07:01] packing a glock
[1:07:05] but witnesses were saying things like he
[1:07:07] had a shiny gun in his hand
[1:07:11] okay
[1:07:12] that'd be good
[1:07:14] but the police
[1:07:16] are getting this all together they're
[1:07:18] figuring this out they're starting to
[1:07:20] get a profile
[1:07:23] this story has a interesting twist to it
[1:07:26] because there was a man who come up to
[1:07:27] the police line at the bank
[1:07:29] and a policeman there told him he said
[1:07:31] uh sir you have to stand back we're
[1:07:33] dealing with a robbery and he says can i
[1:07:35] talk to you we don't have time to talk
[1:07:36] to you and they just kept pushing him
[1:07:38] back he kept staying there patiently
[1:07:40] finally the policeman goes up there okay
[1:07:42] what do you got to say well sir a man in
[1:07:45] a blue gray t-shirt blue jeans blue
[1:07:48] tennis shoes jumped into a chevy
[1:07:50] chevelle with license plate blah blah
[1:07:52] blah and drove away
[1:07:54] and the police are like why didn't you
[1:07:55] tell us that before
[1:07:57] i tried to
[1:07:59] they look it up deputy drives the house
[1:08:02] in middleton
[1:08:03] and waits down the street till the man
[1:08:04] pulls in his own driveway and arrests
[1:08:07] now my brother and sister are one that's
[1:08:09] the way the devil works right
[1:08:11] but you see these witnesses
[1:08:14] here
[1:08:15] every one of them sought a little bit
[1:08:17] different does that mean there's
[1:08:18] conflict in the scripture no sir i want
[1:08:21] to ask you today is jesus christ been
[1:08:23] present in our lives
[1:08:25] present in this church do we all have
[1:08:27] the same witness
[1:08:30] but it's a true witness
[1:08:32] because it's our witness
[1:08:34] of jesus christ in us
[1:08:36] amen otherwise we would only need one
[1:08:39] recipe as it were
[1:08:41] because we would all be exactly the same
[1:08:43] so you see these witnesses and they're
[1:08:46] declaring also the holy ghost is a
[1:08:49] witness whom god hath given to them who
[1:08:51] obey so placing a very high evidence he
[1:08:54] could have said yep nope the holy ghost
[1:08:56] is also a witness but you see they're
[1:08:58] making a declaration to come down to our
[1:09:01] day to be a true witness of jesus christ
[1:09:04] now this is not to say the world out
[1:09:06] here has not witnessed and not been
[1:09:08] blessed by god but to be a true witness
[1:09:11] of jesus christ you need the holy ghost
[1:09:15] see we can talk of what god is doing we
[1:09:17] can talk about this
[1:09:19] you know and and uh you know these
[1:09:21] things and i don't want to sound
[1:09:22] judgmental but they have an experience
[1:09:26] but they have to deny
[1:09:28] the power of the full experience or they
[1:09:31] would be converted
[1:09:33] and jesus said we've got to hide it from
[1:09:35] them lest they would see and be
[1:09:37] converted thank you lord for
[1:09:39] predestination
[1:09:40] amen never take it lightly don't sit
[1:09:42] here with a frown on your face i'm not
[1:09:44] saying anybody is but just don't sit
[1:09:46] here with a frown on your face and say
[1:09:47] oh me my poor life i want you to come to
[1:09:50] a place that the witness of jesus christ
[1:09:52] in your life is enough to cause you to
[1:09:54] lift a hand and say thank you lord no
[1:09:56] matter how difficult my life is the very
[1:09:59] fact that i can be a true witness of
[1:10:02] jesus christ is a blessing that's been
[1:10:04] placed upon my life something's been
[1:10:06] released into my life that i can stand
[1:10:09] in this position and so it's there my
[1:10:12] brother and sister we see
[1:10:14] as i said in verse 28 this expectation
[1:10:17] of
[1:10:18] man's obedience to man's command amen
[1:10:21] see sometimes these commands are outside
[1:10:23] of the word of god but people still
[1:10:25] expect obedience to that the leadership
[1:10:29] expects obedience even if it's outside
[1:10:31] of the word and so we have to come and
[1:10:34] there's a time if i could quali uh quote
[1:10:37] it or put it this way uh and i i might
[1:10:40] preach on this anyhow even though i'm
[1:10:41] bringing it up right now uh the quiet
[1:10:43] rebellion
[1:10:45] amen you see what's happening in the
[1:10:47] bride today my brother and sister we're
[1:10:49] seeing riots in the cities we're seeing
[1:10:51] all kinds of young people mostly
[1:10:53] speaking out pushing back against the
[1:10:56] government pushing back against all of
[1:10:58] these things they're not a quiet
[1:10:59] rebellion my brother and sister the
[1:11:01] quiet rebellion is the one who does what
[1:11:04] is necessary to produce what they're
[1:11:06] called to produce
[1:11:08] these have a spirit of destruction
[1:11:12] just watched a clip this took place back
[1:11:14] east i believe south carolina
[1:11:16] young people coming to a fast food joint
[1:11:18] and when they left
[1:11:20] there they operate the person in there
[1:11:22] is calling 9-1-1 you can hear it in the
[1:11:24] background yes yes there's people here
[1:11:25] tearing up our deal
[1:11:27] and then the person hangs up the phone
[1:11:29] and just moves in the back and they
[1:11:31] totally destroyed everything in that
[1:11:33] place
[1:11:36] but you see the bride of jesus christ is
[1:11:38] having a quiet rebellion
[1:11:40] and she's walking according to the word
[1:11:43] and the spirit of this age right the god
[1:11:45] of this evil age is anointed the world
[1:11:47] to be in such a fashion but here is the
[1:11:50] bride walking counter to every command
[1:11:53] of the god of this evil age she is in
[1:11:55] her own world in her own realm under her
[1:11:58] own anointing because she's a witness of
[1:12:00] the spirit of jesus christ which is a
[1:12:02] spirit of restoration amen a spirit of
[1:12:05] restoration the prophet of god says is
[1:12:07] not replacement
[1:12:09] amen it's restoration we always were in
[1:12:12] him hallelujah so we don't have to come
[1:12:14] and try to make ourselves be something
[1:12:17] because he promised to restore us back
[1:12:19] so our quiet rebellion against the
[1:12:21] spirit of this evil age is us standing
[1:12:23] with the word of god just as we see
[1:12:26] these apostles right here standing and
[1:12:28] saying you know what sorry but we are
[1:12:30] going to go and their actions spoke of
[1:12:32] that and they went and uh uh
[1:12:35] continue to preach the gospel
[1:12:37] now
[1:12:39] look how this is
[1:12:40] they're concerned they don't want the
[1:12:42] blood
[1:12:43] of this man upon them
[1:12:45] look how spirits work the two sides here
[1:12:49] one not wanting to be judged
[1:12:53] you know that's what what's interesting
[1:12:56] how the blood works
[1:13:00] every one of us is judged
[1:13:02] the very blood that we stand and confess
[1:13:05] confess has washed us from our sins
[1:13:07] judged us
[1:13:10] now
[1:13:11] i'm not trying to make a doctrine out of
[1:13:12] this i hope you follow the idea
[1:13:15] this blood comes down upon you and i
[1:13:18] and it judges sin in our life
[1:13:22] as unworthy
[1:13:24] for who we are
[1:13:29] not that we're unworthy
[1:13:31] it's judging the sin
[1:13:34] as unworthy for who this is
[1:13:37] you see the blood cannot take sin away
[1:13:39] from the sinner
[1:13:41] unless there's something deeper there
[1:13:43] a deep calling into the deep a life a
[1:13:47] predestination if we want to just cut to
[1:13:48] the chase amen so sin will not be taken
[1:13:51] away my brother and sister from the
[1:13:53] atheists from the heathen from those
[1:13:55] that denounce and curse god
[1:13:57] will never be done but god comes and he
[1:14:00] puts blood over you and i and says this
[1:14:01] is my son this is my daughter and
[1:14:04] they're not worthy this blood this sin
[1:14:06] is not worthy to be upon them and he
[1:14:08] removes that
[1:14:09] delivers us from that now we can take
[1:14:12] that and you say brother paul you're
[1:14:13] preaching that kind of counter type but
[1:14:14] i preached a counter type on purpose my
[1:14:16] brother and sister for you realize it's
[1:14:18] god who took the sin away and if he said
[1:14:20] you're worthy of the sin that is upon
[1:14:22] you i'll just leave it there we're lost
[1:14:25] but he looked at that sin and says no i
[1:14:27] will take that sin
[1:14:29] upon me
[1:14:30] brother jason i just had he didn't
[1:14:32] realize this was part of my sermon we
[1:14:34] joked about it but yeah i'm going to
[1:14:36] take this sin upon me
[1:14:38] amen i'm going to take it into me
[1:14:42] because this sin is not worthy to be on
[1:14:44] my bride
[1:14:48] that's a counter typed a way to preach
[1:14:50] it saints but i hope you catch did you
[1:14:51] catch it
[1:14:52] amen so
[1:14:54] they're not wanting to be judged and one
[1:14:56] is wanting to be judged isn't this
[1:14:58] amazing we see in the world today the
[1:15:00] spirits that are out there and even
[1:15:02] around the message people are like i i
[1:15:04] don't i didn't like what the preacher
[1:15:05] said he was judging me no he wasn't
[1:15:08] no he wasn't that word was
[1:15:12] and so one doesn't want to be judged at
[1:15:14] all so any reference to life
[1:15:16] circumstance behaviors attitudes is
[1:15:19] you're judging me but the counter type
[1:15:21] of the two sides of obedience one is
[1:15:24] declaring judge me lord
[1:15:26] judge me and if there be any fault any
[1:15:29] failure in me lord please lord come i
[1:15:32] ask you in the name of jesus take it
[1:15:34] from me
[1:15:35] cover it with your blood so what are
[1:15:37] they doing they're inviting the blood
[1:15:39] and one is saying oh you're trying to
[1:15:41] put his blood
[1:15:43] do you catch that
[1:15:45] one is saying you're trying to put his
[1:15:47] blood on us
[1:15:50] and one is saying lord pour your blood
[1:15:51] on me
[1:15:52] i want to be in your blood lord i want
[1:15:54] to be washed i know that this is my
[1:15:57] avenue to be washed whiter than snow
[1:15:59] lord i want your blood upon me
[1:16:02] and one is saying you're trying to put
[1:16:04] his blood upon me and i reject that
[1:16:07] oh look at the spirit of the day that we
[1:16:09] live in saints
[1:16:10] what is happening
[1:16:13] i would say a message believer should
[1:16:14] never bring from his lips i believe the
[1:16:17] preacher was judging me it should never
[1:16:19] come from our lips we should be there
[1:16:21] saying lord i want to be judged
[1:16:24] i don't want to be shamed none of us
[1:16:25] want to be shamed right none of us want
[1:16:27] to come to church and be shamed
[1:16:30] but i tell you under the right spirit
[1:16:31] would come to church and say judge me
[1:16:34] judge me let the word be preached if
[1:16:36] there be error in me lord if there be
[1:16:38] weakness or failings or
[1:16:41] whatever lord i've been tarnished by the
[1:16:43] cares of this life lord then just wash
[1:16:45] me judge me lord
[1:16:47] so you see those two sides those two
[1:16:49] spirits
[1:16:50] but look at how this is
[1:16:52] the two sides of obedience
[1:16:55] both
[1:16:57] are obedient
[1:16:58] to the anointing
[1:17:00] upon them
[1:17:07] i could take that much
[1:17:08] deeper lord leeds will we'll come back
[1:17:12] preach on that a little more
[1:17:14] but you see both are obedient to the
[1:17:17] anointing
[1:17:22] you see under satan's influence
[1:17:24] do everything they can to turn
[1:17:26] everything into religion
[1:17:30] you catch that
[1:17:32] because religions are covering
[1:17:34] all we want to do is be covered just
[1:17:36] cover me cover me cover me
[1:17:39] now that phraseology to a real
[1:17:42] believer is an entirely different
[1:17:45] meaning
[1:17:46] in other words the scripture says that
[1:17:48] we cannot even declare jesus the christ
[1:17:51] without the holy ghost
[1:17:53] so when we are here saying cover me
[1:17:56] what is that saints
[1:17:58] that's us pour the blood on me lord
[1:18:01] pour the blood on me lord
[1:18:03] amen i submit to the word i say forgive
[1:18:06] me lord forgive me of my shortcomings
[1:18:09] forgive me of the lust of flesh the
[1:18:10] pride of life forgive me of this forgive
[1:18:13] me whatever it might be lord forgive me
[1:18:15] because i want to be covered
[1:18:18] now i tell you just go look it up you'll
[1:18:21] find several times through history
[1:18:23] brother brown saying i feel so religious
[1:18:26] right now
[1:18:27] now my brother and sister to people that
[1:18:29] are the hard-liner as it were that all
[1:18:32] religion well what are they going to do
[1:18:33] with that
[1:18:35] you know why they have a problem
[1:18:37] because they don't understand what he's
[1:18:38] saying
[1:18:41] what is that song maybe remember this
[1:18:43] sister emmy would play it at the end of
[1:18:44] the service
[1:18:45] cover me when i am
[1:18:50] hallelujah
[1:18:53] when i'm triumphant i'm bold when i'm a
[1:18:55] conqueror
[1:18:57] no cover me when i'm weak
[1:18:59] cover me when i'm tired cover me when
[1:19:02] i'm afraid cover me when i have done
[1:19:04] wrong
[1:19:06] cover me
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:10] so satan come and says you know what
[1:19:13] i'll what i'll do is just put them in a
[1:19:14] religious spirit they'll feel covered i
[1:19:17] don't want to feel covered saints i
[1:19:19] don't want you to feel covered i want
[1:19:20] you to be covered
[1:19:22] amen we don't want to just acknowledge
[1:19:24] there's the blood of jesus christ we
[1:19:26] want that blood on us
[1:19:28] and some men say no no i don't want that
[1:19:30] blood on me
[1:19:31] oh no i do
[1:19:34] i do
[1:19:35] amen
[1:19:37] why they don't want accountability
[1:19:41] you know what saints it's hard right
[1:19:44] we have our issues come on let's let's
[1:19:45] be men and women enough to just admit we
[1:19:47] have our issues
[1:19:49] amen we have our our little times that
[1:19:52] we speak out of turn and we are offended
[1:19:54] and we have a little attitude and we
[1:19:56] what come on let's just admit that
[1:19:59] but you see
[1:20:00] we're also
[1:20:02] men and women enough as sons and
[1:20:03] daughters of god to take accountability
[1:20:06] to go back and say i was wrong forgive
[1:20:08] me
[1:20:09] i was wrong lord forgive me
[1:20:12] the first wrong was to husband wife
[1:20:14] parents children whatever
[1:20:18] lord forgive me i want accountability
[1:20:20] you see some men's sins go before them
[1:20:22] and some men's sins follow them and i
[1:20:25] want the accountability of when i stand
[1:20:27] there one day if it was that way and my
[1:20:31] sins and my life were read
[1:20:35] i
[1:20:36] want them
[1:20:38] this is just my own little rendition to
[1:20:40] you
[1:20:43] and he lied
[1:20:45] and another voices
[1:20:47] under the blood
[1:20:49] he stole
[1:20:51] under the blood
[1:20:53] he lusted
[1:20:55] under
[1:20:56] the blood
[1:20:57] he this he that under the blood under
[1:21:00] the blood under the blood under the
[1:21:01] blood under the blood under the blood
[1:21:06] and maybe another individual would come
[1:21:11] the same things
[1:21:15] but no voice
[1:21:17] declaring accountability
[1:21:22] and one hears well done my good and
[1:21:24] faithful servant you see all of these
[1:21:26] things that were read from that list if
[1:21:27] it was that way
[1:21:30] and he comes and says well done my good
[1:21:32] and faithful servant why because saints
[1:21:34] let me just make it very simplistic it's
[1:21:36] a little deeper than this and you know
[1:21:38] that
[1:21:38] but here we are
[1:21:40] whatever it might be in our life
[1:21:43] and the holy spirit moves down
[1:21:46] and we're like
[1:21:47] i was wrong
[1:21:48] lord forgive me
[1:21:50] now it's not going to get under the
[1:21:52] blood
[1:21:54] by us sitting here and saying
[1:21:56] okay lord i acknowledged i'm wrong will
[1:21:58] you put it under the blood
[1:22:01] no sir
[1:22:02] you have to pick it up
[1:22:05] you have to bring it over here
[1:22:07] and you come on can i get that you
[1:22:11] have to put it
[1:22:12] under the blood amen
[1:22:14] god provided the blood you have to
[1:22:16] provide the willingness or submission to
[1:22:18] place it there
[1:22:20] isn't that beautiful
[1:22:21] amen thank you lord that we're anointed
[1:22:24] right now look at this in john 9 and 41
[1:22:28] move forward brothers if you would
[1:22:29] please
[1:22:30] john 9 and 41 we look at this now i've
[1:22:32] just preached a little bit or referenced
[1:22:34] this here recently jesus said unto them
[1:22:37] if you were blind now he's not talking
[1:22:40] about natural eyesight because right
[1:22:42] before this they said are are we blind
[1:22:45] do we not see
[1:22:48] yeah
[1:22:51] if you're blind you should have no sin
[1:22:54] now think about this
[1:22:55] a man or woman
[1:22:57] living wherever it might be in the world
[1:22:59] that never hears the gospel of jesus
[1:23:00] christ it never comes to their ears the
[1:23:03] name of jesus never passes their lips
[1:23:07] and god says i'm going to judge you
[1:23:11] but
[1:23:13] in all honesty in all fairness
[1:23:16] what is he going to judge them of
[1:23:17] something they never knew
[1:23:22] jesus tells him
[1:23:25] if you were blind you should have no sin
[1:23:28] never saw one thing never never had a
[1:23:30] clue you have no sin
[1:23:33] but now ye say
[1:23:35] we see
[1:23:37] therefore your sin remaineth
[1:23:40] now i'm going to change this if you'd be
[1:23:41] kind enough to let me
[1:23:44] when we would say
[1:23:47] we see
[1:23:49] we are really saying
[1:23:51] we believe
[1:23:53] i see this
[1:23:54] i believe
[1:23:58] so what happens is
[1:24:00] when we say we believe
[1:24:02] when we say we see the gospel of jesus
[1:24:04] christ we're then taking accountability
[1:24:07] to ourself and saints we have a choice
[1:24:10] to take this our iniquity our unbelief
[1:24:14] we have a choice do i take it over here
[1:24:16] and put it under the blood
[1:24:19] or do i just put a covering over myself
[1:24:22] i'm a message believer
[1:24:25] look let's not look at the denomination
[1:24:27] let's bring it down
[1:24:28] home i'm a believer i believe god sent a
[1:24:31] prophet my brother and sister that
[1:24:33] doesn't change the fact you've got to
[1:24:35] take your sin and iniquity and bring it
[1:24:37] over here and put it under the blood
[1:24:40] amen
[1:24:41] it is not just because we confess that
[1:24:43] we believe because you see if we were
[1:24:45] entirely blind then god would give grace
[1:24:47] to us in our circumstance i'm not here
[1:24:49] to determine what god will and won't do
[1:24:52] but god would give grace to you but we
[1:24:54] are here saying we see we see we see we
[1:24:57] believe
[1:24:58] now we have this accountability
[1:25:01] now look at the true believer
[1:25:03] amen that's where we really always want
[1:25:05] to look right to the true believer
[1:25:07] look at the true believer
[1:25:09] they want the blood
[1:25:11] now the prophet of god said we backslide
[1:25:13] daily do we believe that
[1:25:18] now some of you that are nice and mellow
[1:25:20] and
[1:25:20] not high strung and not nervous and not
[1:25:23] massively in debt
[1:25:27] so you have no worries
[1:25:30] not a care on this earth
[1:25:34] no i think i'm going to believe the
[1:25:35] prophet's words
[1:25:36] and he said we
[1:25:38] backslide daily
[1:25:42] now some of the back signs might be
[1:25:44] bigger than others
[1:25:46] remember the little lady that brother
[1:25:47] branham talks about and she got
[1:25:49] delivered and then she's walking down
[1:25:50] the street one night and and she knew
[1:25:53] better than to stop at the door of that
[1:25:54] honky tonk or dance hall but she just
[1:25:57] remembering old times isn't amazing how
[1:25:59] we can reminisce in old times
[1:26:02] and then she stopped right there and
[1:26:03] then next thing she knows she's looking
[1:26:05] in the door and next thing she know
[1:26:07] she's inside and next thing she knows in
[1:26:09] arms of some boy
[1:26:12] and when she sees the prophet again she
[1:26:14] says i'm lost
[1:26:16] i failed i'm done it's finished
[1:26:20] and he says
[1:26:22] no it's not
[1:26:25] it's not
[1:26:26] because you see
[1:26:28] while she failed
[1:26:31] the anointing may have been more on the
[1:26:33] ins outside of her than it was on the
[1:26:36] inside
[1:26:38] but god said i know how
[1:26:41] to get it to the inside
[1:26:43] now you say why do you say that brother
[1:26:44] paul
[1:26:45] because she didn't run and hide from the
[1:26:47] prophet she went back to him and said
[1:26:49] this is what i've done
[1:26:52] i don't know how i did i i just
[1:26:55] the prophet didn't say you worthless no
[1:26:57] good lady
[1:26:58] no sir he says look
[1:27:00] your first mistake
[1:27:02] you stopped and listened
[1:27:05] what was it that was a bible that was
[1:27:07] inside there it sounded like music it
[1:27:09] sounded like laughter it sounded like
[1:27:11] joy and happiness but it really was just
[1:27:14] the devil
[1:27:15] because the devil knows how to
[1:27:16] impersonate amen and he creates this
[1:27:18] atmosphere
[1:27:20] so it's look the the true believer wants
[1:27:22] the blood look how they're attracted to
[1:27:24] the blood i'm talking to true believers
[1:27:26] this morning am i not amen attracted to
[1:27:29] the blood that when we come short and
[1:27:31] holy spirit deals with us we don't run
[1:27:34] away from the blood we run to it
[1:27:36] amen every time oh it's hard to admit
[1:27:39] especially as we get older that we still
[1:27:40] make these mistakes but look at what
[1:27:42] god's doing he takes us he's appointed
[1:27:44] us we go right back to the blood and you
[1:27:47] realize when you're going back to the
[1:27:48] blood you're actually telling god hold
[1:27:51] me accountable
[1:27:54] well i mean otherwise my problems that i
[1:27:57] have as a man are not really my fault
[1:27:59] their brother jason's fault
[1:28:04] come on have you ever done that
[1:28:07] well let's get it right down where it
[1:28:08] usually happened husbands wives
[1:28:14] well he wouldn't fight i wouldn't fight
[1:28:16] but you're fighting
[1:28:20] and fighting is really
[1:28:21] not an issue you know that i don't even
[1:28:23] think fighting's an issue
[1:28:25] that just shows we haven't really
[1:28:26] learned how to deal with it
[1:28:30] god help us to learn
[1:28:32] you know sister jerry there's a lot of
[1:28:33] things and i don't say this in lightning
[1:28:35] to make her look bad a lot of things
[1:28:37] that she says
[1:28:39] i must have a red button on my forehead
[1:28:42] and there's things that she's just like
[1:28:48] now what results would she expect
[1:28:53] vice versa
[1:28:57] what she really should expect is someone
[1:29:00] who's got the blood on them
[1:29:04] see you thought i was speaking on jerry
[1:29:08] i'll just turn it around
[1:29:10] she shouldn't push the button
[1:29:13] but just because she pushed the button i
[1:29:14] don't have to react wrong
[1:29:18] god help us families husbands wives
[1:29:21] children
[1:29:23] we don't have to react that way
[1:29:26] we are as it were in a sense as sons and
[1:29:28] daughters of god in control of our
[1:29:30] destiny
[1:29:31] amen
[1:29:32] you called me a what
[1:29:36] thank you
[1:29:39] you know how hard that is to do
[1:29:42] you called me a what god bless you
[1:29:45] you did what
[1:29:47] well i'm sure that there has to be a
[1:29:49] reason because god's in control when's
[1:29:50] the last time you use that one
[1:29:54] come a little closer i'll slap you silly
[1:29:56] as more common response
[1:29:59] come on saints let's look at this in the
[1:30:01] correct deal you see the real believers
[1:30:03] attracted to the blood the real believer
[1:30:06] is willing to be held accountable by the
[1:30:08] blood
[1:30:09] amen
[1:30:11] and a real believer is identified in the
[1:30:14] blood
[1:30:15] now let's just go look right here in the
[1:30:16] token amen
[1:30:18] the the believing worshiper was
[1:30:21] identified with his sacrifice by the
[1:30:24] token i don't wish to stay too long on
[1:30:27] these little quotations but which you
[1:30:28] could take the entire service on one of
[1:30:30] them but i want to stop here for a
[1:30:32] moment to express that the believer had
[1:30:35] to be identified with his sacrifice so
[1:30:38] here is the priest in the temple
[1:30:41] declaring we don't want his blood on us
[1:30:46] you know what they were saying i never
[1:30:48] saw him as the lamb
[1:30:51] he never was a lamb to them so therefore
[1:30:55] the blood became offensive where the
[1:30:57] believer recognizes that christ is our
[1:31:00] sacrifice our lamb and we know that not
[1:31:04] only do we want that blood upon us we
[1:31:07] want to handle our sacrifice and so look
[1:31:11] at this now the believer had to be
[1:31:14] identified with his sacrifice see if
[1:31:17] it's just a sacrifice and made somewhere
[1:31:19] out there he had to give it but he had
[1:31:21] to be identified in it frankly he had to
[1:31:24] place his hands on it first
[1:31:29] to identify himself with his sacrifice
[1:31:32] and then the blood was placed where he
[1:31:34] could stand under the blood
[1:31:36] the blood must be over him and that was
[1:31:38] a token that he had that he had
[1:31:41] identified himself guilty
[1:31:44] isn't that amazing one of the first
[1:31:46] things we got to do as a believer i
[1:31:47] backslide daily
[1:31:49] i won't put it on any of you i will use
[1:31:51] you for an example i backslide daily you
[1:31:53] know the first key things of me
[1:31:55] backsliding daily is i have to
[1:31:57] acknowledge and speak out i'm guilty
[1:32:01] now i'll bring this back and here again
[1:32:02] i'm not meaning to slight sister jerry
[1:32:04] i'm trying to break that habit
[1:32:07] i don't care if she was as mean as a
[1:32:10] junkyard dog
[1:32:13] and i got angry and i did
[1:32:17] i can stop and say
[1:32:19] the reason i got angry is her fault
[1:32:23] but did you know that when you go lay
[1:32:26] your hands
[1:32:27] on the lamb
[1:32:29] the lamb
[1:32:30] doesn't say
[1:32:32] you confess it and i'll forgive her
[1:32:37] the lamb says you confess it i'll
[1:32:40] forgive
[1:32:41] you
[1:32:43] now for us to confess it saints what do
[1:32:45] we have to do
[1:32:47] i'm guilty lord
[1:32:49] i'm guilty lord i have transgressed the
[1:32:51] word of god i am guilty lord
[1:32:54] we have to make that acknowledgement we
[1:32:57] have to bring that
[1:32:59] to
[1:33:00] identify ourself
[1:33:03] with our lamb yes
[1:33:06] we can't
[1:33:07] have that remote nature that we live in
[1:33:09] right we live in a world today
[1:33:11] wait till they come down to the time
[1:33:13] that brother trevor
[1:33:15] is the recipient of some of this
[1:33:16] incredible technology
[1:33:18] brother trevor will be sitting up there
[1:33:20] in the house and sister carrie will be
[1:33:22] making him a cup of coffee and a
[1:33:24] customer will walk into the barber shop
[1:33:26] and sit down in the chair and there will
[1:33:28] be 42 cameras in that room
[1:33:30] and brother trevor will be watching all
[1:33:32] these cameras and he'll look at this and
[1:33:35] the profile of the head or the history
[1:33:37] of the head of that customer will rise
[1:33:38] up and the camera will identify and
[1:33:40] little things will pop up there and then
[1:33:41] brother trevor will say
[1:33:44] good
[1:33:44] push the button
[1:33:48] no no no
[1:33:54] and the man slides his credit card
[1:33:56] and walks out
[1:33:58] while brother
[1:34:00] drinking some coffee and eating a
[1:34:01] croissant
[1:34:08] i want you to think about that silly
[1:34:10] example
[1:34:13] in the world of religion
[1:34:20] brother brown said
[1:34:22] the lord spoke to him and said all that
[1:34:24] you
[1:34:25] love
[1:34:27] all that you ever loved and loved you
[1:34:31] will be there
[1:34:33] and people are going
[1:34:35] well praise the lord i'll sit right down
[1:34:36] here in my little chair
[1:34:38] and that prophecy to be fulfilled now
[1:34:41] i love brother branham
[1:34:44] i'm going to be there
[1:34:47] and religion comes to him a little here
[1:34:49] and a little there and a little this way
[1:34:51] a little that way
[1:34:52] no effort
[1:34:54] on their own
[1:34:56] no altar to plead at
[1:34:58] no sacrifice of their self-will
[1:35:02] no change of nature
[1:35:04] they're counting on this
[1:35:06] kind of you might say shortcut
[1:35:12] but in that shortcut there's no laying
[1:35:15] their hands
[1:35:16] on the lamb
[1:35:18] they're counting on someone else to lay
[1:35:20] their hands on the lamb
[1:35:22] but the word declared they had to lay
[1:35:26] their hands on the lamb
[1:35:28] but at the flip side of this now
[1:35:30] there'll be some people
[1:35:32] that will look at the word hear the word
[1:35:34] believe the word something stir in their
[1:35:35] heart and they'll be saying lord jesus
[1:35:37] come close to me come nigh to me lord
[1:35:39] you are my lamb and i must possess you i
[1:35:42] must have you i want my life to be
[1:35:44] changed i want to be judged by the word
[1:35:47] if brother paul preaches so hard i walk
[1:35:49] out of church crying in myself pity i
[1:35:52] want to say oh lord i receive that
[1:35:55] and those are the ones my brother and
[1:35:56] sister that never get offended they
[1:35:58] never walk away they never say i won't
[1:35:59] go to that church they're too hard
[1:36:01] they're never doing that because they'll
[1:36:02] look at that and say that wasn't that
[1:36:04] man that man loves me that man would
[1:36:06] never do this to me that's the holy
[1:36:08] ghost rooting out the little plants the
[1:36:12] little foxes
[1:36:17] but he had to place his hands on it
[1:36:19] first
[1:36:20] to identify himself with his sacrifice
[1:36:23] then the blood was placed where he could
[1:36:25] stand under the blood
[1:36:27] now brother branham says i don't
[1:36:28] remember what sermon it is brother adam
[1:36:30] says the devil can't get to you if you
[1:36:32] stay under the blood
[1:36:35] amen hallelujah
[1:36:37] so what does he do
[1:36:39] he gets placed
[1:36:41] where he's under the blood
[1:36:44] this is not clever writings my brother
[1:36:45] this is not clever preaching this is god
[1:36:48] speaking to you and i let's stay under
[1:36:50] the blood get under the blood stay under
[1:36:53] the blood and our lives will not be
[1:36:55] filled full of chaos and whatever of
[1:36:57] this tormenting devils of the day that
[1:37:00] doesn't mean your tire won't go flat
[1:37:03] it doesn't mean your car won't run out
[1:37:05] of gas if you don't stop and refill it
[1:37:08] and but then again we have testimony
[1:37:11] coming out of africa of missionary
[1:37:12] brothers driving the gas station they
[1:37:15] were counting on was closed they're in
[1:37:16] the middle of nowhere they just said
[1:37:18] lord you know why we're here you know
[1:37:20] what our purpose is lord you know what
[1:37:22] our whole intention was
[1:37:25] and uh
[1:37:26] they get in the car and start it and
[1:37:27] drive for hours till they're back to
[1:37:29] their home go out the next morning gonna
[1:37:30] drive their land rover to the gas
[1:37:32] station
[1:37:34] and the tank boom
[1:37:37] it won't start
[1:37:42] i wouldn't suggest you go do that weekly
[1:37:45] because you're too lazy to stop at a gas
[1:37:46] station
[1:37:50] the blood must be over him that was a
[1:37:52] token he identified himself guilty
[1:37:55] and he proven that innocent substitute
[1:37:57] had taken his place
[1:37:59] now
[1:38:00] my
[1:38:02] somebody quickly turned the clocks back
[1:38:07] we're going to do
[1:38:08] daylight savings times too
[1:38:11] so they got to be identified in the
[1:38:13] blood
[1:38:14] now look
[1:38:16] let me just hurry
[1:38:18] we're going to look at first peter here
[1:38:20] peter an apostle of jesus christ to the
[1:38:22] strangers scattered throughout pontus
[1:38:24] galatia cappadocia asia and bithya
[1:38:28] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[1:38:30] god i love this scripture actually tell
[1:38:32] you the truth
[1:38:34] elect according the foreknowledge of god
[1:38:36] the father through sanctification of the
[1:38:38] spirit unto

[1:39:34] happy
[1:39:35] your name
[1:39:36] is on the book
[1:39:38] that in itself ought to be enough for us
[1:39:40] to shout and sing
[1:39:43] oh
[1:39:44] won't we have a time
[1:39:47] remember the last time brother jewel was

[1:39:52] head a brother jewel up here

[1:40:05] goodness he's almost died two or three
[1:40:07] times here had strokes and had you know
[1:40:09] minor heart attack this and that and all
[1:40:11] this stuff and you call him up and he
[1:40:13] can barely talk and he's saying praise
[1:40:15] god brother paul
[1:40:16] the lord is with me
[1:40:20] what
[1:40:22] oh
[1:40:23] brother jewel
[1:40:25] no

[1:40:27] you know he blitzed through town
[1:40:29] what we got it was a god bless you and
[1:40:31] tell the saints hi
[1:40:33] that was that's what we got but my
[1:40:36] brother and sister here's a man it's
[1:40:37] like
[1:40:38] praise the lord brother paul
[1:40:41] the lord's lifted me up again
[1:40:44] and again and you came
[1:40:47] amen now you sit here and say woe unto
[1:40:49] me you need to go catch that spirit
[1:40:52] you need to go catch that spirit
[1:40:54] has got us
[1:40:56] again into a lively hope by resurrection
[1:40:58] of jesus christ to an inheritance
[1:41:00] incorruptible undefiled that fadeth not
[1:41:02] away reserved in heaven for you who are
[1:41:04] kept
[1:41:06] by the power of god
[1:41:08] my brother and sister don't sit here and
[1:41:09] go woe unto me of my circumstance you
[1:41:12] are being kept by almighty god
[1:41:19] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:41:21] revealed in the last time
[1:41:23] now look at this
[1:41:24] my brother and sister we're living in
[1:41:26] the last time are we not
[1:41:28] amen
[1:41:29] so it's there
[1:41:30] in this last time god's revealing these
[1:41:32] scriptures right here wherein you
[1:41:34] greatly rejoice though now for a season
[1:41:36] if need be you're in heaviness through
[1:41:39] manifold temptations
[1:41:41] none of us i think like to be tempted
[1:41:43] right
[1:41:44] but there's two sides of obedience here
[1:41:46] saints
[1:41:48] it's not the trial
[1:41:51] you know what can somebody acknowledge
[1:41:52] that
[1:41:53] it's not the trial
[1:41:55] it's what you do
[1:41:57] in the midst of the trial
[1:41:59] that matters
[1:42:01] you can speak faith
[1:42:05] or you can speak doubt and fear
[1:42:08] you can say god's with me
[1:42:10] or you can declare god has abandoned you
[1:42:15] two sides of obedience
[1:42:18] he says we're kept
[1:42:21] he says we're gonna rejoice in the midst
[1:42:23] of these trials
[1:42:24] manifold temptations that the trial of
[1:42:27] your faith
[1:42:29] i struggle on this one saints i'll just
[1:42:31] be honest with you
[1:42:33] that the trial of my faith being more
[1:42:35] precious than that of gold that pairs
[1:42:37] though betrayed with fire might be found
[1:42:39] into praise and honor and glory at the
[1:42:41] appearing jesus christ
[1:42:44] there's times that satan sets the stage
[1:42:46] on closing
[1:42:47] there's times that satan sets a stage
[1:42:50] and he lets you just have
[1:42:52] a
[1:42:53] stub your toe
[1:42:56] just figurative here stub your toe
[1:42:58] then you trip you fall down
[1:43:01] you get up you hit your head when you're
[1:43:03] getting up
[1:43:04] and then you walk a little ways and you
[1:43:06] realize oh this isn't where i wanted to
[1:43:08] go and you have to backtrack and you
[1:43:10] turn on another path and that path you
[1:43:13] don't remember it's so difficult
[1:43:18] and we think man the devil's just
[1:43:19] pounded on you no what he's doing he's
[1:43:21] setting the stage
[1:43:23] for his real assault amen
[1:43:26] all the rest of this in military terms
[1:43:28] is just a probe
[1:43:30] how is it
[1:43:32] have you ever noticed saints
[1:43:35] when we have little struggles in our
[1:43:36] life
[1:43:38] when we won blame it on someone else
[1:43:41] or to
[1:43:43] feel like god's not hearing us
[1:43:46] i know some of you well enough to know
[1:43:48] that you have declared that before i
[1:43:49] don't think god's hearing my prayer
[1:43:51] i'll just speak for the rest of you
[1:43:56] and the devil's watching
[1:43:59] his spirit
[1:44:00] a little lower than it was yesterday
[1:44:03] a little lower than it was the day
[1:44:04] before a little lower a little lower
[1:44:07] than the devil approaches but you ever
[1:44:08] noticed
[1:44:10] god moves in your midst
[1:44:13] your heart's on fire
[1:44:15] and the wheels fall off the wagon
[1:44:18] and you say praise god
[1:44:20] there'll be another wagon coming
[1:44:23] praise god there's something better the
[1:44:25] lord has for me praise god satan you're
[1:44:28] already defeated even if you're trying
[1:44:31] to you know the devil never quite has
[1:44:34] the same effect
[1:44:37] when you tell the devil that now pardon
[1:44:39] me for saying it this way but when you
[1:44:40] tell the devil that he is an ugly liar
[1:44:45] and i'm not even going to listen to you
[1:44:48] it has a different effect though when he
[1:44:50] whispers in our ear
[1:44:51] and we say
[1:44:53] yeah you're right
[1:44:55] you're right nobody loves me
[1:45:00] you're right i'm no good
[1:45:03] you're right
[1:45:04] i'm unworthy
[1:45:07] the devil's like yes
[1:45:09] yes
[1:45:11] but what about we just throw a little
[1:45:12] curveball at him
[1:45:16] but satan is unworthy as i am
[1:45:19] i think i'm just going to go find me a
[1:45:21] place and curl up
[1:45:23] under the blood
[1:45:26] and he's like
[1:45:27] i've wasted weeks on this person
[1:45:30] i put all this time i knocked the wheels
[1:45:33] off their wagon and i did this and i did
[1:45:35] that and they're gonna go climb under
[1:45:37] the blood and say lord forgive me for my
[1:45:40] fears my doubts my
[1:45:42] the devil is like wow
[1:45:46] come on saints
[1:45:47] we're going to have a little practice of
[1:45:49] our warfare
[1:45:50] amen
[1:45:51] we're kept
[1:45:53] now look at this
[1:45:55] whom having not seen you love in whom
[1:45:57] though now you see him not yet believing
[1:46:02] we just hold on we're believing
[1:46:04] nothing's going to turn us away
[1:46:07] how can you do that
[1:46:09] well it's god in me
[1:46:11] let me put it into a different term
[1:46:13] i got some quotes if i had just piled
[1:46:14] them on today
[1:46:16] i could bring to you
[1:46:19] you can come in that position
[1:46:21] because
[1:46:22] your hands are not on
[1:46:24] religion your hands are not on church
[1:46:27] your hands are not on our preachers so
[1:46:29] revelated your hands
[1:46:32] are on the lamb amen
[1:46:35] and there's no way satan can shake you
[1:46:37] loose
[1:46:38] when your hands are on your sacrifice
[1:46:42] when he is right there so personal
[1:46:46] hallelujah you got your hands on the
[1:46:48] lamb satan's like i can't even get to
[1:46:50] him what am i going to do now
[1:46:53] well praise the lord satan that's what
[1:46:55] the whole plan is
[1:46:56] what are you going to do now
[1:46:58] see we can rejoice with joy unspeakable
[1:47:01] and full of glory
[1:47:02] receiving the end of our faith
[1:47:05] you see our faith is not going to come
[1:47:06] short of
[1:47:09] our
[1:47:09] faith get this now saints your faith is
[1:47:12] not going to bring you to a rapture you
[1:47:14] know that
[1:47:16] ponder that for a minute your faith is
[1:47:18] not going to bring you to a rapture
[1:47:21] your faith
[1:47:22] is going to bring you to the throne of
[1:47:24] almighty god
[1:47:26] the rapture
[1:47:27] is just a sequence of time
[1:47:30] and event
[1:47:32] that takes place
[1:47:34] and people i hear it all the time well
[1:47:36] if we can just hang on to the rapture
[1:47:39] sorry hang on to the rapture nothing man
[1:47:41] there is a spot before the throne of
[1:47:43] almighty god that has my name on it
[1:47:47] i'm not just wanting to make a rapture
[1:47:49] i'm going right on through the rapture
[1:47:50] and right after the rapture my brother
[1:47:52] and sister is the marriage of the lamb
[1:47:54] and right after the marriage of the lamb
[1:47:56] is the millennium
[1:47:58] i'm i'm going to transfer all the way
[1:48:00] through all of that and step in that and
[1:48:03] be living right in the very presence of
[1:48:05] my lord jesus christ not just looking to
[1:48:08] make it another day
[1:48:09] now if some of you are in this position
[1:48:11] financially please forgive me for
[1:48:12] putting it this strongly but people have
[1:48:15] a way of living
[1:48:17] they spend their money
[1:48:18] they live their life that way and they
[1:48:20] spend their money that way that they
[1:48:22] pick a projected point in time
[1:48:26] and they think if i can just make it
[1:48:27] till the next payday
[1:48:29] if i can just make it to this if i can
[1:48:30] just make it to that my brother and
[1:48:32] sister the fault of their thinking is
[1:48:34] they'll never break the cycle because
[1:48:36] their expectation is i have this money
[1:48:39] and if i can just make it right there
[1:48:40] but the man as it were that has a
[1:48:42] savings account that has built up
[1:48:44] through the years is the man who says i
[1:48:46] am looking to this point way off here
[1:48:50] do i need this
[1:48:52] sure enjoy things of life
[1:48:55] absolutely enjoy things of life but if
[1:48:57] you have to choose between good
[1:48:59] stewardship
[1:49:01] and yourself
[1:49:02] choose good stewardship
[1:49:04] amen
[1:49:06] hallelujah
[1:49:07] so here let me finish
[1:49:12] i'm so lost in my own notes i don't even
[1:49:13] know where i'm at
[1:49:15] well praise the lord
[1:49:16] i like it when i don't preach from notes
[1:49:21] once again i want to remind you of that
[1:49:23] beautiful verse 38
[1:49:25] for if this council or this work be of
[1:49:27] man it will come to not
[1:49:31] you know we have
[1:49:33] well brother paul we have this problem
[1:49:35] in the message over here
[1:49:37] and we have this doctrine over here and
[1:49:39] we have this thing that happened over
[1:49:41] there and
[1:49:42] no no no
[1:49:46] don't look at that
[1:49:48] look at the word
[1:49:50] now i want to ask you a question
[1:49:53] is the word not more powerful in your
[1:49:55] life today
[1:49:56] than it was a year 5 10 ago
[1:50:00] is it not more real today than it was at
[1:50:03] any time in your past is it coming to
[1:50:06] naught is what i would put to you is the
[1:50:08] word coming to not where you feel less
[1:50:10] inclined to believe or act upon the word
[1:50:13] my brother sir if we're in that position
[1:50:14] we need to find an altar
[1:50:16] and if you need a quote i've got to
[1:50:18] quote
[1:50:20] if you come to that place we need an
[1:50:21] altar see this should be refining us
[1:50:24] this refining fire is refining us in our
[1:50:27] faith to stand on the word of god to
[1:50:29] trust the lord
[1:50:30] he says i believe
[1:50:32] amen so this council is not coming to
[1:50:35] naught but look now the prophet of god
[1:50:38] said these two spirits
[1:50:40] would go side by side right down to the
[1:50:42] end
[1:50:46] so this spirit here now this is going to
[1:50:49] sound judgy
[1:50:50] hope it's not judging to any of you
[1:50:54] can you look out
[1:50:55] saints
[1:50:56] even amongst the holiness groups
[1:51:00] i have for years now
[1:51:02] looked at
[1:51:04] listened to
[1:51:05] have my own reason my own purpose why
[1:51:07] listen to it
[1:51:09] of the preaching
[1:51:10] of the pentecostal world in the holiness
[1:51:12] world
[1:51:16] there has been a steady
[1:51:18] decline
[1:51:20] hallelujah steady decline
[1:51:23] saints i don't mean to speak personal
[1:51:25] but
[1:51:26] brother brown told us that you can look
[1:51:28] at the wives the sisters in a church and
[1:51:30] know where condition of a church is
[1:51:32] when we're in needle skirts and high
[1:51:34] heels
[1:51:35] when we're in tight blouses
[1:51:38] when we want our hair to grow more for
[1:51:40] the glory of god so we're going to trim
[1:51:42] off our split ends
[1:51:44] why don't you just ask god to
[1:51:46] trim off your split ends
[1:51:48] i know a sister i met her sister one
[1:51:50] time that was her testimony she had
[1:51:52] really long hair all the way down on her
[1:51:53] bottom
[1:51:54] but her hair was just getting ragged it
[1:51:56] was horrible
[1:51:57] and she went and all the hairdresser and
[1:51:59] all the people was like nope you have to
[1:52:01] cut it and she's like i ain't cutting it
[1:52:04] she started getting down something
[1:52:05] smoked her heart she started getting
[1:52:06] down and saying lord you gave me
[1:52:09] this hair
[1:52:11] and it looks horrible lord even though
[1:52:13] i'm going to wear it this way for your
[1:52:15] glory because your word says so and she
[1:52:17] started doing that and
[1:52:19] then one day her hair started growing
[1:52:21] again and
[1:52:22] a miracle happened
[1:52:24] and
[1:52:25] she didn't have split ends any longer
[1:52:28] you see the devil's
[1:52:30] alternative was
[1:52:31] yeah i know you're a believer
[1:52:34] but this is the solution
[1:52:37] no
[1:52:38] the word is the solution
[1:52:40] prayer is what changes things
[1:52:43] not reasoning not a hairdresser not of
[1:52:45] this or that it's the word
[1:52:48] and so see how satan's coming
[1:52:50] because he says
[1:52:52] i have
[1:52:54] an alternative obedience
[1:52:57] for you
[1:52:59] and it makes sense
[1:53:00] i
[1:53:03] will preach that in another service
[1:53:06] that's what i'll do i'll just preach
[1:53:07] that portion another service
[1:53:12] is it
[1:53:12] saints
[1:53:14] an obedience to redemption
[1:53:17] and an obedience to judgment
[1:53:20] the two spirits in the framework of the
[1:53:22] church sister emmy will you come
[1:53:25] amen
[1:53:28] you see my brother and sister this word
[1:53:30] is not going to come to naught because
[1:53:32] it's god's word
[1:53:34] and
[1:53:36] when man's expectation doesn't meet
[1:53:38] god's word then we don't go with man's
[1:53:41] commandment we go with god's word
[1:53:44] so what we want to do today saints is we
[1:53:47] want to just exercise
[1:53:50] this judgment of the holy spirit
[1:53:53] now this judgment of the holy spirit i'm
[1:53:54] speaking in this sense
[1:53:56] and that is how many of us pray for
[1:53:58] wisdom
[1:54:00] amen it doesn't matter if you go through
[1:54:03] you know three thousand dollars a month
[1:54:05] on a paycheck or you go through a
[1:54:07] hundred thousand dollars a month or
[1:54:08] something in a business or whatever i
[1:54:11] believe any of us that have any we're
[1:54:12] praying for god's wisdom lord i want
[1:54:15] wisdom
[1:54:16] now my brother and sister when we
[1:54:17] constantly apply that to our life that
[1:54:20] prayer that attitude then would we not
[1:54:23] expect god to give us wisdom
[1:54:25] on what we
[1:54:27] give our allegiance and our obedience to
[1:54:31] see now the scripture says and boy does
[1:54:33] this open up a can of worms be so close
[1:54:37] that's it come on think about it saints
[1:54:39] so close to deceive the very elect
[1:54:43] and i've had people that were just like
[1:54:45] oh brother paul
[1:54:48] and they literally almost in tears
[1:54:49] because
[1:54:50] you know we we just can't
[1:54:52] we can't
[1:54:54] we're going to be deceived like what
[1:54:56] bible what quote are you reading
[1:55:00] if
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:02] if
[1:55:04] it were possible
[1:55:06] they said well brother paul that almost
[1:55:08] borderlines on arrogance you're saying
[1:55:10] you can't be deceived
[1:55:12] praise the lord
[1:55:14] i'm glad you got the message
[1:55:16] i'm glad you heard what i was trying to
[1:55:18] say
[1:55:20] because i can't be deceived because paul
[1:55:23] is so smart so intelligent so educated
[1:55:25] so
[1:55:26] no sir
[1:55:28] because
[1:55:30] i've been obedient to the word
[1:55:33] and i have christ in me
[1:55:36] and the prophet of god makes this
[1:55:38] statement
[1:55:39] the holy spirit
[1:55:41] will never lead you away
[1:55:44] from
[1:55:47] hallelujah so the whole solution here
[1:55:49] now i say this in all kindness so don't
[1:55:52] nobody misunderstand this brother david
[1:55:54] preaches a lot about getting the holy
[1:55:56] ghost and i say amen
[1:55:58] because you have the holy ghost
[1:56:01] you can't
[1:56:02] be deceived
[1:56:04] that's god himself
[1:56:06] speaking through you it's not of high
[1:56:09] attainment
[1:56:11] you know if you're a mormon
[1:56:13] then we've got a lot of mormon relatives
[1:56:15] and some of them i've had some
[1:56:16] connections with through the years
[1:56:18] now if you want to be a mormon
[1:56:21] you start off taking care of the young
[1:56:23] men
[1:56:24] and then you move into this you that
[1:56:26] then you get invited to the council in
[1:56:28] your local ward
[1:56:30] and then when you're gifted and you
[1:56:32] speak well they offer you more and they
[1:56:34] offer you more and they offer you more
[1:56:36] until
[1:56:38] you have attained
[1:56:39] a position
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:44] the holy ghost said
[1:56:47] if you'll die daily
[1:56:51] i'll lift you up
[1:56:53] i don't need your ability i don't need
[1:56:56] your thoughts i don't need any of that
[1:56:58] you just die come on this time come on
[1:57:00] saints can we just die today just die a
[1:57:02] little bit more to ourselves today just
[1:57:04] give up a little bit more and say lord
[1:57:06] thy will be done
[1:57:08] [Music]
[1:57:09] i want to be completely obedient to your
[1:57:11] word lord i don't want to be part
[1:57:12] obedient i don't want to be a little bit
[1:57:14] obedient i don't want to be
[1:57:15] three-quarters obedient i want to be
[1:57:16] obedient the fullness of the extent of
[1:57:19] the word i want to be obedient lord
[1:57:21] because as i surrender
[1:57:24] you
[1:57:25] have promised to lift yourself
[1:57:27] and that's our heart's desire today
[1:57:29] saints
[1:57:30] amen i'm sorry i jumped around a little
[1:57:32] bit today like i said i just i struggle
[1:57:35] you talk about
[1:57:36] that proverbial phrase about pandora's
[1:57:39] box
[1:57:40] you just open the word and you start
[1:57:42] looking
[1:57:43] and it's like oh my i'll include this
[1:57:44] scripture i'll include this quote and
[1:57:46] then pretty soon you're like you know
[1:57:48] that's probably five hours
[1:57:51] so then you spend an hour
[1:57:54] putting this back and putting that back
[1:57:56] but you don't want to lose quotes so you
[1:57:57] got to then create another file and
[1:57:59] start storing them over here and and it
[1:58:01] just takes time
[1:58:03] so i'm sorry if i
[1:58:05] kind of spoke a little notchy this
[1:58:06] morning i
[1:58:08] was trying to trim my thoughts down
[1:58:11] to remind you
[1:58:12] [Applause]
[1:58:13] the two sides of obedience
[1:58:17] i believe we're sitting here today as
[1:58:18] sons and daughters of god because we've
[1:58:20] already chose that sign
[1:58:22] we've already lifted the word up
[1:58:25] we've already declared lord
[1:58:27] you say it
[1:58:28] i want to believe it i want to act on it
[1:58:30] i want to be obedient to it
[1:58:33] hallelujah
[1:58:34] you know it reminds me a little story in
[1:58:36] closing
[1:58:37] can i share this
[1:58:40] the cleverness of humanity of the devil
[1:58:43] reminds me of a little story
[1:58:46] boys over there cookie jar
[1:58:48] got his hand in the cookie jar and the
[1:58:50] mom walks in the kitchen
[1:58:52] and she said johnny
[1:58:53] get out of that cookie jar
[1:58:56] don't you dare have a cookie before
[1:58:58] supper
[1:59:00] so john's like yes mom
[1:59:03] right after supper
[1:59:05] and everyone who went in the living room
[1:59:06] and sat down
[1:59:08] tony just almost the cookie jar again
[1:59:11] without permission
[1:59:13] and in his mind
[1:59:15] it's after supper
[1:59:17] i'm not breaking the rules
[1:59:19] [Music]
[1:59:20] and it's so funny because in this little
[1:59:22] story johnny
[1:59:24] has a cookie out of the cookie jar
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:27] everything's going well
[1:59:29] he remembers
[1:59:31] i've got to put the lid on the cookie
[1:59:33] jar or else mom will know i'm in the
[1:59:34] cookie chart
[1:59:37] he reaches over with a cookie in one
[1:59:39] hand
[1:59:40] a lead to the cookie jar in the other
[1:59:43] and he's so enthralled with his cooking
[1:59:46] he has to take a bite of this cookie his
[1:59:48] ill-gotten gain
[1:59:50] his disobedience
[1:59:52] and he misses the cookie jar and he
[1:59:54] drops the porcelain lid
[1:59:56] on the floor
[2:00:01] would it not been better
[2:00:03] though said mama
[2:00:05] you said after supper
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:08] would it not been better to have
[2:00:10] submitted if mom said no to do it
[2:00:14] the scripture says whatever we've done
[2:00:16] in secret would be made
[2:00:18] whatever is done in the darkness shall
[2:00:19] be revealed in the line
[2:00:22] let our obedience saints
[2:00:24] let our obedience
[2:00:26] you want a new car
[2:00:29] ask god for it
[2:00:31] don't just do it
[2:00:33] ask god for you want a different house
[2:00:35] ask god for it
[2:00:36] need a change in your life ask god for
[2:00:39] it
[2:00:42] don't think
[2:00:43] that god will have
[2:00:45] i left the quote out i sort of product
[2:00:48] that's all i'm going to speak it out to
[2:00:49] you prophet of god says
[2:00:51] [Music]
[2:00:53] i believe it's in the oneness
[2:00:55] it could be mistaken because sometimes
[2:00:57] you look too many
[2:01:00] you do something in the perfect will of
[2:01:01] god
[2:01:03] goes wrong
[2:01:05] god will help you fix it
[2:01:08] but if something goes wrong
[2:01:10] and you're out of the will of god
[2:01:13] you have to go back and get in the will
[2:01:15] of god
[2:01:16] for god to help you
[2:01:19] obedience saints
[2:01:21] is better than sacrifice

[2:06:01] [Music]
[2:06:13] hallelujah when our eyes are open saints
[2:06:15] [Music]
[2:06:18] obedience
[2:06:20] becomes a much clearer picture
[2:06:24] [Music]
[2:06:25] sometimes saints we don't really like to
[2:06:27] recognize it in these terms and i don't
[2:06:29] want to be offensive but
[2:06:31] we come to one of the greatest battles
[2:06:34] many of us fight
[2:06:36] is this is what i want lord
[2:06:40] and we don't really spend time
[2:06:42] to ask the lord what he wants
[2:06:44] [Music]
[2:06:47] be still
[2:06:49] and know that i am god
[2:06:55] saints
[2:06:57] i'm telling you the time is coming
[2:07:00] i had something shared with me the other
[2:07:02] day
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:06] can i just have a moment
[2:07:11] that's something shared with me the
[2:07:12] other day i come from a position of
[2:07:15] what i would call
[2:07:17] great authority
[2:07:19] [Music]
[2:07:24] and when you look at that the influence
[2:07:26] that these things have on people
[2:07:28] [Music]
[2:07:30] when you look at
[2:07:32] influence anyone has
[2:07:35] on those around us
[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:43] people sharing
[2:07:46] quoting quotes
[2:07:48] building a foundation
[2:07:52] quotes this is what you should do
[2:07:56] um
[2:07:57] and in that
[2:07:59] you can look at that first off and say
[2:08:01] you know what that's exactly right
[2:08:05] that's exactly right
[2:08:09] i'm struggling to find the scripture
[2:08:11] excuse me
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:16] as i was reading this it troubled me
[2:08:18] saints
[2:08:20] troubled me very much
[2:08:23] someone using quotes using a position of
[2:08:25] authority
[2:08:27] to encourage people
[2:08:30] don't do this
[2:08:32] do this
[2:08:35] giving quotes to support it
[2:08:38] i went to bed that night i was praying i
[2:08:41] said lord
[2:08:42] i know i don't believe what was spoke
[2:08:44] right there
[2:08:46] i have also
[2:08:48] i study a multitude of quotes
[2:08:51] that i believe would
[2:08:53] repudiate that would would neutralize
[2:08:56] that as it were but i want to tell you
[2:08:58] saints how powerful something can be
[2:09:00] when you ask god
[2:09:02] lord i want i want you to show me
[2:09:04] i don't want paul's opinion
[2:09:07] i don't want to just declare from my
[2:09:09] past experience this is what it must be
[2:09:12] but how about
[2:09:14] when we would come to a place
[2:09:17] and you would get up early in the
[2:09:18] morning and you'd sit in your chair and
[2:09:20] your bible that you normally study out
[2:09:22] of and read has been closed
[2:09:25] so it's not where you've been reading
[2:09:29] and you reach over and you pick that
[2:09:31] bible up
[2:09:32] and it falls open
[2:09:34] to judges
[2:09:35] 18.
[2:09:37] and in judges 18
[2:09:40] we see the children of dan
[2:09:42] and we see micah
[2:09:44] backslid
[2:09:46] and he takes to him
[2:09:49] molten images
[2:09:51] he takes to him
[2:09:53] idols
[2:09:54] he's backslid
[2:09:56] [Music]
[2:09:59] and he hires
[2:10:01] himself his own personal levite
[2:10:04] that will speak to him
[2:10:06] what he
[2:10:08] wants to hear
[2:10:11] i won't go into the whole detail because
[2:10:13] it would require quite a time
[2:10:16] but i tell you i know what was on my
[2:10:18] heart saying to know what i was praying
[2:10:19] and as i read that i thought oh god
[2:10:22] we're coming to a day
[2:10:24] as it was with dan
[2:10:26] as it was with micah
[2:10:29] we're seeing the spirit rising up and
[2:10:31] people now understand saints i want you
[2:10:34] to go to the church that you feel
[2:10:36] blessed in i never want you to feel like
[2:10:38] brother paul's trying to keep us here
[2:10:39] it's got a leash on us no no i don't
[2:10:41] believe that i don't believe that but
[2:10:44] i'm telling you we're coming to a day
[2:10:46] when people are looking out
[2:10:48] and they're hiring themselves a preacher
[2:10:51] to preach what they want to hear
[2:10:56] and then they're raising up
[2:10:59] images
[2:11:01] and idols
[2:11:03] and then they come and say this
[2:11:05] is what we believe
[2:11:08] i'll just tell you from my heart right
[2:11:10] now i believe god supernaturally took me
[2:11:12] to judges 18 to answer
[2:11:15] that very
[2:11:16] thing that was shared with me
[2:11:18] god
[2:11:19] i pray this for you saints for myself
[2:11:22] for my family don't fall under that
[2:11:25] spirit
[2:11:26] i will sit in a church
[2:11:29] that preaches what we like to hear
[2:11:32] let us pray and ask god lord
[2:11:36] let it be preached what i need
[2:11:39] to hear
[2:11:40] not what i want to hear
[2:11:44] saints
[2:11:45] please
[2:11:47] powerful forces the devil hates this
[2:11:49] message
[2:11:50] he wants to rip it to shreds don't look
[2:11:52] at anybody and say oh they're bad this
[2:11:54] is that no no no don't do that but i
[2:11:56] encourage you to pray lord
[2:11:59] lead us
[2:12:00] lead us lord into obedience lead us
[2:12:03] father that to your word is still our
[2:12:06] absolute as the prophet declared it to
[2:12:08] be
[2:12:09] lead us to these things father and then
[2:12:11] give us a spirit to surrender ourselves
[2:12:13] to it because you see my brother and
[2:12:15] sister
[2:12:16] it's one thing to drive down the highway
[2:12:19] limit sign 55
[2:12:23] that's all right it don't apply to me i
[2:12:24] drive any speed i want
[2:12:25] [Music]
[2:12:28] now you'll find the natural and the
[2:12:29] spiritual parallel to each other
[2:12:31] now the word says i shouldn't but
[2:12:33] [Music]
[2:12:35] that applies to you not me
[2:12:38] what is that
[2:12:39] an idol
[2:12:41] it's an idol raised up that's exactly
[2:12:43] right
[2:12:45] well brown said we can become a
[2:12:47] denomination unto ourselves
[2:12:50] i just want to encourage you saints go
[2:12:52] back to the pure word pray over it lord
[2:12:54] reveal to me make this real to me not
[2:12:57] because paul preached this brother david
[2:13:00] preaches brother chris preaches make it
[2:13:02] real to me lord because i want your word
[2:13:05] and then lord give me a spirit to be
[2:13:07] obedient to that word
[2:13:10] hallelujah
