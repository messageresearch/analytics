[31:29] many
[31:29] days many times of fellowship amen
[31:33] hallelujah well just to clarify
[31:37] something brother sergey
[31:38] is i i happen to ask sister yulia in the
[31:41] foyer
[31:41] he is probably going to be home tomorrow
[31:44] so
[31:45] we're thankful for the lord uh just to
[31:48] give him that
[31:48] job that he was searching that load he
[31:51] was searching for to come home so
[31:53] we're very happy to do that sister toma
[31:56] i pray that you have a
[31:57] lovely lovely trip home as lovely as
[32:01] flying
[32:02] in this time can be but god bless you
[32:05] all your connections and all your
[32:07] travels amen
[32:09] so well saint i found the perfect
[32:12] formula for brother paul not preaching
[32:14] too long and that is don't charge your
[32:16] ipad very much and therefore you can't
[32:20] preach too long so and then also i want
[32:23] to just put everyone to rest
[32:25] sister jerry and i are doing just fine
[32:27] she just decided to sit on the other
[32:29] side of the church so
[32:31] all is well there amen let's just stand
[32:34] and uh go to the word once again uh
[32:36] age old proverbs i want to just kind of
[32:39] go back we're going to
[32:40] just take some thoughts as we find them
[32:43] we want to place
[32:44] placing value in the correct place and
[32:47] we want to start actually in the new
[32:49] testament
[32:49] and uh ii corinthians and kind of take a
[32:54] uh modern more when i say modern i mean
[32:57] new testament new covenant uh um
[33:00] a foundation for our thought tonight and
[33:03] uh so second corinthians the fourth
[33:05] chapter starting with the first verse
[33:07] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[33:10] now remember saints
[33:11] every one of us has ministry
[33:15] this is not a there's a preacher in the
[33:18] pulpit and i'm just here to go to church
[33:20] we have a ministry as we have received
[33:24] mercy
[33:25] we faint not but have renounced the
[33:27] hidden things of dishonesty
[33:30] now i want to tell you saints just uh
[33:32] just give you a little example
[33:34] of how satan would throw things or put
[33:37] things in your path
[33:38] i uh recently just purchased a an
[33:42] object or a thing and and the man as he
[33:45] was filling out the title
[33:47] he says i'm willing to write any value
[33:50] in what i sold it to you for
[33:52] you just name it i'll put it on here and
[33:54] so it would be easy to take a value that
[33:57] is the true one
[33:58] and say i don't have to pay as much
[34:00] sales tax if we
[34:01] lower the value but you see we
[34:05] have rejected renounced the hidden
[34:08] things of dishonesty
[34:10] now let me put it to you in this context
[34:12] as a pastor
[34:13] you would never know if i told that man
[34:16] oh cut the price in half
[34:18] see that would never never never you
[34:20] come to your knowledge
[34:22] but you see i could never preach truth
[34:24] to you
[34:25] with the hidden things of dishonesty
[34:30] it's tainted many a man and we have to
[34:33] guard ourselves
[34:34] to remain completely honest in all
[34:36] things regardless
[34:38] whether it costs us in the flesh cost us
[34:40] financially
[34:41] emotionally we have to be honest
[34:45] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[34:48] the word of god deceitfully
[34:50] but by manifestation of the truth
[34:52] commending ourselves to every man's
[34:54] conscience
[34:55] in the sight of god but if our gospel be
[34:58] hid it is hid to them that are lost
[35:01] in whom the god of this world hath
[35:03] blinded the minds of them
[35:06] which believe not lest the light of the
[35:08] glorious gospel of christ
[35:10] who is the image of god should shine
[35:13] unto them
[35:14] for we preach not ourselves but christ
[35:16] jesus the lord
[35:17] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[35:20] sake
[35:21] for god who commanded the light to shine
[35:23] out of darkness has shined in our hearts
[35:25] can we say amen
[35:27] to give the light of the knowledge of
[35:29] the glory of god
[35:30] in the face of jesus christ but we
[35:33] have this treasure in earth and vessels
[35:38] the excellency of the power may be of
[35:40] god and not of us
[35:42] we are troubled on every side yet not
[35:45] distressed
[35:46] we are perplexed but not in despair
[35:49] persecuted but not forsaken
[35:53] cast down but not destroyed
[35:57] heavenly father we just thank you lord
[35:58] for your word ask you to move tonight in
[36:01] our midst speak to us father
[36:03] lord let it be fresh from your throne we
[36:05] pray lord for every need every request
[36:07] every circumstance lord named or unnamed
[36:10] uh brother kerry brother kerry
[36:13] brother trevor sister kerry on vacation
[36:15] lord
[36:16] uh with the family lord each and every
[36:18] one our sister sue
[36:20] every one father that would not be here
[36:22] with us tonight
[36:24] just ask you lord just to come and be
[36:26] fresh to them brother prashant sister
[36:28] concha father just remembering each one
[36:31] that's a part of this assembly
[36:33] we ask for your guidance now in the name
[36:35] of jesus christ
[36:36] amen you may be seated hallelujah
[36:40] i hope i don't speak to you tonight like
[36:42] i was speaking to
[36:43] everyone else today and i kept just
[36:47] my thoughts were too far ahead and i
[36:49] kept jumbling up my word so lord help me
[36:51] tonight that i
[36:52] i won't jumble this up to you as we look
[36:55] here in ii corinthians
[36:57] as we have just read we look at verse
[36:59] seven but we have this treasure in earth
[37:01] and vessels and
[37:02] often times saints we have read this
[37:05] scripture
[37:05] and uh you know if we're not careful
[37:07] we'll just simply look at the earth and
[37:09] vessel
[37:10] we'll look at this and say oh my you
[37:12] know uh
[37:13] god in us you know uh christ in you the
[37:16] hope of glory
[37:17] many people struggle with that i've
[37:19] heard people before say if god is in me
[37:21] where is he
[37:22] at my brother and sister we we don't
[37:24] want to get caught up
[37:25] in trying to discern what it is and i
[37:28] propose to you tonight that while we are
[37:31] looking at these scriptures
[37:32] as we are studying this thought we won't
[37:35] talk i i really appreciated
[37:37] the leadership of the holy spirit had no
[37:39] idea what brother jason was going to
[37:41] sing
[37:41] he had no idea what i was going to speak
[37:44] on
[37:44] but this last song my brother and sister
[37:47] was just very moving to me
[37:49] because it is there if we are not
[37:50] careful the devil will keep
[37:52] dredging up everything that we've ever
[37:55] every mistake
[37:56] and maybe even worse than ourself in the
[37:58] greatest battle ever fought
[38:00] uh dealing with our own mistakes is that
[38:02] we would be anointed to
[38:04] dredge up everyone else's mistakes also
[38:06] so god
[38:07] help us that we would be able to take
[38:09] the mercy
[38:10] and grace of god apply it in our life
[38:13] today
[38:14] and let the talk not be of whether we
[38:16] are worthy or not
[38:18] not to talk of our failures but tonight
[38:21] we want to talk on
[38:23] the place that god chose to put his
[38:26] treasure
[38:26] now if we'll look at this and realize
[38:28] the value that the word of god is right
[38:31] heavens and earth
[38:33] shall pass away but god's word
[38:36] will never fail so we're talking about
[38:39] something that is not even
[38:41] using the word intrinsic would not even
[38:44] cover
[38:45] the base of the value of the word of god
[38:48] to sons and daughters of god
[38:50] the word was spoken has never failed
[38:53] it's the same yesterday today and
[38:54] forever
[38:55] and that word is the very life of a
[38:57] believer so we want to
[38:59] look tonight at not just uh this vessel
[39:02] this earthen vessel
[39:03] which is prone to its mistakes prone to
[39:06] its shortcomings prone to many things
[39:08] but my brother and sister it is the
[39:10] place that god deemed worthy
[39:13] a place that god said i can clean that
[39:15] right the word of god shows us very
[39:17] clearly
[39:17] that god will not place his spirit in an
[39:20] unclean vessel
[39:21] he will not place his spirit in a dirty
[39:24] vessel
[39:24] so my brother and sister the word of god
[39:26] shows us clearly that we must wash the
[39:28] vessel
[39:29] inside and out it must be spotless and
[39:32] god pours himself in it
[39:34] and the word has declared that he has
[39:36] amen
[39:37] that the power of verse 7 may have this
[39:40] treasure in earth and vessels that the
[39:42] excellency not just the base value my
[39:45] brother and sister
[39:46] but the excellency of the power may be
[39:48] of god
[39:49] so there's going to be a people that are
[39:51] going to in the eyes of god
[39:53] be exceedingly worthy can someone say
[39:57] amen tonight exceed
[39:59] exceedingly worthy to be filled with the
[40:02] spirit of god
[40:03] not just oh i'm just barely getting by
[40:06] but come to the place to realize that
[40:08] god
[40:09] is the one who does the cleansing god
[40:11] does the sanctifying
[40:13] god does the filling and god in the
[40:15] beginning we call it predestination
[40:17] did the choosing of the vessel he wanted
[40:20] to pour himself
[40:21] in so you can stop and i'm going to
[40:23] speak this a little strong right here
[40:25] you can make a decision you can choose
[40:28] to look at your failures
[40:29] and those failures around you and dwell
[40:32] on them
[40:32] or you can choose to choose to choose oh
[40:36] god help us to choose to be
[40:39] one that says you know what the
[40:41] excellency of the power
[40:43] of god in me was god's decision
[40:46] not mine so therefore if god can't make
[40:49] a mistake
[40:50] he did not make a mistake when he said
[40:53] i'm going to pour
[40:54] my excellency into you hallelujah
[40:57] somebody ought to actually be excited
[40:59] about that
[41:00] come on saints i know maybe a long week
[41:02] so far but
[41:03] you're not amending me you are ameniting
[41:06] the word of god you're telling god
[41:08] thank you that you chose me to pour
[41:10] yourself
[41:11] into amen so you know as i said you can
[41:14] talk about the failures
[41:16] but we want to choose to talk tonight
[41:19] about the place that god chose to put
[41:21] his
[41:21] treasure now my brother and sister the
[41:23] scripture talks about
[41:25] how that they would be places that those
[41:27] that and will i think i have that in
[41:29] here
[41:29] if not i meant to but people will will
[41:33] put their treasure in places that the
[41:35] moth will eat
[41:37] and it will canker
[41:44] your choice my choice
[41:48] or we can recognize who we were called
[41:51] to be
[41:52] and say that's where i'm putting my
[41:54] treasure
[41:56] i'm going to put myself in the place god
[41:58] wanted me to be in
[42:00] now remember as i spoke to you and i
[42:02] have quotes to back it up if anybody
[42:04] needs me to defend it
[42:05] but my brother and sister the word of
[42:07] god is not self-fulfilling god
[42:09] wanted you to do your part he wanted me
[42:12] to do my part
[42:13] so we can't just sit back and say if god
[42:15] wants this to happen it'll happen
[42:17] you know that's kind of like you know
[42:19] just saying well if if i'm to get a good
[42:21] job they'll call me while i sit on the
[42:23] couch at home
[42:24] it don't work that way my brother and
[42:25] sister the self-fulfilling
[42:28] side of god is you being anointed to
[42:30] stand up and say i believe
[42:32] i am one that was called i believe that
[42:34] the treasure of god
[42:36] has been placed in me and i'm gonna move
[42:38] into this position
[42:40] and claim it i'm going to act on it now
[42:42] in
[42:43] proverbs we'll take this now to to uh
[42:46] collect this uh thought and put it into
[42:49] place tonight
[42:50] uh my son if i will receive my words and
[42:55] hide my commandments with thee
[42:58] so my brother and sister it's not hiding
[43:01] the commandments as it were
[43:04] somewhere else you've got to hide that
[43:07] in you
[43:10] so that thou incline thy ear unto wisdom
[43:13] and apply thine heart to understanding
[43:16] yea if thou criest after knowledge
[43:20] and lift us up thy voice for
[43:22] understanding
[43:24] if thou seekest her as silver
[43:27] and searches for her as for hid
[43:30] treasures
[43:31] now my brother and sister we can live in
[43:33] a day to day well let me finish this
[43:35] then thou shalt understand the fear of
[43:37] the lord and find the knowledge of god
[43:40] now my brother and sister many times in
[43:42] the age that we live in the word of god
[43:44] says it will happen we are watching it
[43:46] come to happen
[43:46] that people start to search the word of
[43:49] god they will search the message they're
[43:51] trying to find
[43:52] something different they're trying to
[43:54] find as it were something more
[43:56] and they're not waiting for revelation
[43:58] they're not waiting for god himself
[44:00] to open up their eyes and their ears
[44:02] they're they're
[44:03] they're just looking and you know often
[44:06] times
[44:07] when we come outside of the will of god
[44:10] trying to
[44:10] put together maybe something of a new
[44:13] revelation as it might be
[44:15] that we'll do that and we come up with
[44:17] wrong conclusions
[44:18] but as we look at this word right here
[44:21] this
[44:22] is not a man this is not a a woman this
[44:25] is not a brother or sister
[44:27] who is trying to come to be the most
[44:30] knowledgeable
[44:31] or be the one of the greatest
[44:33] understanding
[44:34] but this is one who's actually simply
[44:36] crying out to god
[44:38] they are not looking to man they're not
[44:40] looking to
[44:41] answers from man but seeking the
[44:44] answer from god and so when they become
[44:47] in in a place that their heart and their
[44:50] desire
[44:51] is so strong that they constantly as the
[44:54] scripture
[44:55] says those that sigh and cry for the
[44:57] wickedness in the city
[44:58] the prophet of god said if you have the
[45:00] holy ghost you will be
[45:01] sighing and crying for the abominations
[45:04] in the city
[45:05] so it's there that you see that example
[45:07] what the holy ghost would move upon sons
[45:09] and daughters of god
[45:10] to cry for the sin out there how much
[45:13] more would the holy ghost
[45:14] move upon you and i to cry for more
[45:17] understanding and more of god
[45:19] and so as we are there it's satan is
[45:21] there to distract us i tell you
[45:23] i'll just i'll just be bold to put it
[45:25] this way i have recently just praying
[45:28] lord help me have a better prayer life a
[45:30] stronger prayer life
[45:31] i don't want to just pray oh lord
[45:33] there's this problem over here in this
[45:35] problem over here
[45:36] i want to pray in the spirit i want to
[45:38] be able to claim the victory
[45:40] of those things that i see no evidence
[45:42] of victory
[45:43] i want to be anointed to pray for
[45:45] victory and claim it right there even
[45:47] though
[45:47] the devil and the world would say you
[45:49] can't claim that victory that's not
[45:51] victory right now
[45:52] but i believe this word i believe what
[45:55] the word has said and
[45:56] i want to live in that realm where i can
[45:58] look out in a need yes i'll be bold and
[46:00] say it tonight
[46:01] maybe i see something in a in the body
[46:04] of believers here
[46:05] that troubles me something that i
[46:07] struggle with and i don't want to sit
[46:08] here
[46:09] and just moan and groan oh lord if they
[46:12] would just
[46:12] oh lord if they could oh lord i want to
[46:15] stand up
[46:16] and say lord your word promise these are
[46:18] sons and daughters of god
[46:20] i believe that the victory has already
[46:22] been declared and i'm claiming it today
[46:25] so therefore i'm going to stand up and
[46:26] say
[46:27] victory is in the camp hallelujah oh
[46:31] some of you say well i don't know i
[46:33] don't feel like much victory
[46:34] well i'm here to tell you you might just
[46:36] fulfill what you feel
[46:41] come on saints i feel defeated
[46:45] then you're gonna approach everything in
[46:47] front of you with a spirit of defeat
[46:49] oh i'm going by my feelings brother paul
[46:52] well you go by your feelings my brother
[46:54] and sister
[46:54] it doesn't work very well doesn't work
[46:57] at all
[46:58] reminds me one time some brothers was
[47:02] hunting and their set up their tent uh
[47:04] just a little ways from the creek and
[47:06] there was a little trail went down to
[47:08] the creek a little bank there
[47:09] it was dark out and one of the brothers
[47:11] said well guys i i'm going to get up
[47:13] here and
[47:14] i'm just going to he had to call in
[47:16] nature and he said i'm just going to go
[47:18] off over here and
[47:19] and one of the brothers says well here's
[47:20] my flashlight and he said i don't need a
[47:22] flashlight i can just kind of feel my
[47:24] way along
[47:25] a few minutes later or not even minutes
[47:27] they hear a great big splash
[47:29] he felt his way along all right he felt
[47:31] it right over to the bank and fell in
[47:32] the crick
[47:33] now my brother and sister i hope you can
[47:35] see and make the context of that
[47:38] to realize it's not about feeling it's
[47:40] about knowing
[47:41] amen it's about us knowing who we are
[47:44] and knowing that god didn't come down
[47:46] and pour his holy spirit and call a
[47:48] vessel that would spend its whole life
[47:50] saying i'm unworthy i'm unworthy i'm
[47:51] unworthy
[47:52] it's time for us as a bride of christ to
[47:54] stand up and say
[47:55] if god chose to pour the excellency of
[47:59] his treasure
[48:00] into me i must be worthy
[48:04] hallelujah come on saints this is not a
[48:07] raw raw
[48:08] this is a stepping stone or foundational
[48:10] stone
[48:11] for you being able in the face of all
[48:14] challenges
[48:15] be able to say i'm victorious
[48:18] hallelujah amen now let's look at this
[48:22] word
[48:23] taken here in
[48:26] context of of uh of proverbs 2
[48:30] the word treasure reference number 4301
[48:34] now i love this i got excited my brother
[48:36] and sister when you see this
[48:38] because the very first words of this
[48:41] treasure in reference to this scripture
[48:44] is
[48:45] secret storehouse
[48:51] did you know come on are you with me
[48:52] tonight saying so i'm going to harass
[48:54] you until somebody comes alive
[48:58] do you realize i'm not picking on
[49:00] anybody you're just the closest
[49:04] a secret storehouse
[49:07] the world doesn't see what god has
[49:10] chosen to hide
[49:12] in each one of you the world cannot see
[49:15] will not see
[49:16] it's a secret remember the prophet of
[49:18] god said that what is going to move i'm
[49:21] just paraphrasing it the moving of the
[49:23] holy spirit
[49:24] in these last times will not be a
[49:27] public display it is a secret
[49:30] storehouse of god himself
[49:34] poured into you and i god didn't just
[49:36] say well i got to put myself i got to
[49:38] pour my spirit somewhere
[49:39] i guess i'll just pour it here and i'll
[49:41] just pour it there no my brother and
[49:43] sister he
[49:44] knew exactly where he was pouring it you
[49:46] wouldn't go down here and put your money
[49:48] in a bank that was advertising that it
[49:50] was going broke
[49:52] you wouldn't go out here and bury your
[49:54] money in something that was fixing to
[49:56] fall in the canyon
[49:58] amen god knew exactly god didn't look
[50:01] down and say i just hope
[50:02] that these people don't fail in laodicea
[50:07] i i hope that they don't give up
[50:10] in this last hour god looked down and
[50:13] said i'm going to pour myself into this
[50:15] vessel right here
[50:16] because this vessel is predestinated to
[50:19] be an
[50:19] overcoming vessel this vessel is going
[50:22] to be one
[50:22] that when it gets difficult they might a
[50:25] waiver they might be pushed to the side
[50:28] they might be buffeted but they will
[50:30] stand they will not give up and when it
[50:32] gets difficult
[50:34] they will get more determined to serve
[50:36] me hallelujah
[50:38] god didn't say well i just hope my
[50:39] brother and sister that's not how god
[50:41] works
[50:42] amen god knows amen so a secret
[50:45] storehouse aren't you glad tonight
[50:47] that you are a secret storehouse of the
[50:49] holy ghost in laodicea
[50:51] amen i tell you i get excited about that
[50:54] the definitions go on to be secreted
[50:57] valuable hidden riches
[51:01] hallelujah imagine how god looks at you
[51:05] now you know esther being one of my
[51:07] favorite ladies in the bible
[51:08] favorite sisters you know when esther
[51:11] come
[51:12] and stood in the 48 to go to the king
[51:16] she put on the very best of her rags
[51:21] to see the king
[51:24] no sir do you understand my brother and
[51:27] sister
[51:28] how the king dressed
[51:32] the queen was not a reflection of the
[51:36] queen
[51:38] it was a reflection of the king
[51:42] and the scripture says that we've been
[51:44] clothed in righteousness
[51:45] revelations 19 amen we're not clothed in
[51:48] rags my brother and sister
[51:50] we're not as the scripture also
[51:51] describes in the book of revelation
[51:53] standing here
[51:54] naked but we've been closed with the
[51:57] righteousness of almighty god
[51:59] because it's not a reflection we think
[52:01] oh oh it's so difficult especially young
[52:03] people i you know i i get made fun of
[52:05] her people look at me or snicker or this
[52:07] and that
[52:08] because you know how we live and what we
[52:10] believe my brother and sister do you
[52:11] understand
[52:12] it's not a reflection of you it's a
[52:14] reflection of the king they're
[52:16] snickering the king
[52:20] but god clothed his bride in his very
[52:24] righteousness
[52:25] because that's a reflection of him
[52:29] oh my goodness are you getting this
[52:31] tonight saints
[52:32] come on i don't you know i don't want to
[52:35] just keep harassing you
[52:37] but i got 10 bucks can i get an amen
[52:40] amen
[52:42] hallelujah now if god be
[52:46] with us then where are all the miracles
[52:48] i really like this quote
[52:51] a good thoroughbred christian knows
[52:54] where the storehouse of god is
[52:56] they know he doesn't say they're
[52:58] studying or searching
[53:00] for or hoping he's speaking of a past
[53:03] tense state of knowledge they know
[53:09] a good thoroughbred christian knows
[53:10] where the storehouse of god is
[53:12] they know that they are born of the word
[53:15] can someone say amen the word is made
[53:18] flesh
[53:20] amongst them no sir he says
[53:23] in them see there's a struggle you say
[53:27] well brother paul
[53:28] you don't have a struggle with that i
[53:29] know but a lot of people do
[53:31] they think god's present with them they
[53:32] struggle with the idea that god's in
[53:34] them
[53:34] that the manifestation of jesus christ
[53:36] the lord jesus christ on the earth today
[53:39] is not him in that same physical body
[53:41] that went to
[53:42] calvary that manifestation of him today
[53:45] is you people struggle with that
[53:50] the word is made flesh in them every
[53:52] word that god says they don't different
[53:54] with it they say it's right amen and
[53:58] amen
[53:58] they punctuate it with an amen every
[54:01] time amen amen
[54:03] something in them see it's not a mental
[54:06] conception
[54:07] it's not just something of knowledge
[54:09] it's something in them it's something
[54:11] that is responding to the word and
[54:14] taking them to that position
[54:16] that something in them punctuated what
[54:18] is it that causes them to punctuate it
[54:22] himself back to the scripture
[54:25] christ in you the hope of glory
[54:28] the very life jesus christ the same
[54:31] yesterday today and forever
[54:33] amen he that believeth in me the works
[54:35] that i do shall he do also
[54:36] amen go into all the world preach the
[54:39] gospel to every creature
[54:40] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[54:42] be saved and these signs shall follow
[54:44] them that believe amen
[54:48] you see we're not looking at a gospel
[54:50] that's declining my brother and sister
[54:52] you look here in the day that we are
[54:54] living uh
[54:55] and this might sound a little harsh but
[54:58] we're looking in the day that we're
[54:59] living
[55:00] look around the pentecostal movement
[55:03] is getting more worldly all the time you
[55:06] look in the denomination
[55:07] more worldly all the time you look at
[55:10] the
[55:10] various offshoots of holiness getting
[55:13] more worldly all the time
[55:15] my brother and sister this word of god
[55:17] as a prophet of god talked about how
[55:19] long revivals last
[55:20] in the moving of the holy spirit if you
[55:23] want to
[55:23] stay around i'm hoping for a rapture
[55:26] myself but if you want to stay around
[55:28] you'll find this true word of god
[55:30] will not decline it will not falter it
[55:32] will not compromise
[55:34] it will not give up and it will not in
[55:36] the sense of
[55:39] hiding from persecution go underground
[55:43] it will always be lived openly the life
[55:46] of the believer
[55:47] will always be lived before this world
[55:51] so as we look and realize my brother and
[55:53] sister as we are coming into these times
[55:56] we have to make sure that we place our
[55:58] value
[55:59] in the correct place we'll come to a
[56:02] time and i know i hit on this once in a
[56:04] while but
[56:05] i keep having you know push back as it
[56:07] were and different people that don't
[56:08] don't agree but my brother and sister i
[56:11] i'm telling you
[56:12] i don't i don't really want to fuss
[56:14] about it it's just a spirit that's there
[56:15] and getting stronger every day
[56:17] now the prophet of god says here that
[56:20] the true believer right
[56:22] the thoroughbred christian knows where
[56:25] the storehouse of god is
[56:26] you know that's really something that's
[56:28] actually kind of a little fuss around
[56:29] the message right
[56:31] people talking about where the
[56:32] storehouse is where the storehouse is
[56:34] well the prophet of god is telling us
[56:36] the word is our storehouse
[56:38] amen now i would put it this way that
[56:40] the word expressed through the message
[56:42] meaning
[56:43] the word of god expressed through the
[56:45] message is the sore house for the
[56:47] believer
[56:48] we are not having to go and try to go to
[56:51] a certain place to be
[56:52] doled out a certain amount of something
[56:55] at a certain time
[56:57] but god through revelation is speaking
[56:59] to the hearts of sons and daughters of
[57:01] god
[57:02] that we can come and realize that the
[57:04] storehouse
[57:05] is right there now the prophet of god
[57:07] tells us my brother and sister that if
[57:09] you want to get closer to god
[57:11] get down on your knees and pray and ask
[57:13] god to reveal himself to you
[57:15] and i i just say you don't have to no
[57:17] one please lift your hand but i want to
[57:19] ask you
[57:19] do we do that do we get down on our
[57:21] knees and say lord i need you to reveal
[57:24] yourself to me
[57:26] or do we sit back and hope that somehow
[57:28] we just find things to keep us
[57:30] encouraged
[57:31] i would say my brother and sister let's
[57:32] get down on our knees
[57:34] let's not sit back and say oh well you
[57:36] know if god wants my brother and sister
[57:37] that is a very feeble
[57:39] very feeble approach to the word of god
[57:41] well if god wants
[57:42] well of course he wants look at what the
[57:45] prophet of god says go look it up
[57:46] yourself amen sometimes
[57:48] good for you to do homework go look what
[57:50] brother branham says about john 3 16.
[57:52] there's enough power
[57:53] in john 3 16 to save the world
[57:57] but how many people actually accept it
[58:00] how many people really applied john 3 16
[58:03] correctly
[58:07] ouch
[58:14] okay put your seat belts on i don't say
[58:16] this with anything more
[58:18] than to make a point to you the word
[58:21] express
[58:22] through the message is a storehouse for
[58:23] the believer and now look my brother and
[58:26] sister you will find quotes just look up
[58:28] storehouse you'll find quotes where
[58:29] brother branham talks about the
[58:30] tabernacle
[58:32] being the storehouse and a lot of people
[58:33] feel very strongly today
[58:35] about the tabernacle being the
[58:37] storehouse but you'll also find quotes
[58:39] where brother branham says that the
[58:41] tabernacle has problems
[58:44] so if we're going to just take word for
[58:46] word now look don't don't pick on me
[58:48] folks
[58:48] here or anywhere else don't pick on me
[58:50] but if we're going to just take
[58:52] say only what the prophet of god said
[58:54] the storehouse has problems
[59:01] but you will not find a single quote to
[59:04] support the idea
[59:05] that brother branham thought the bible
[59:07] had one single problem
[59:09] he said the bible from beginning to end
[59:11] genesis to revelation
[59:13] dovetails and has not one mistake
[59:16] because
[59:16] it is the written word of god
[59:20] so even though you've got three more
[59:21] quotes that say the tabernacle might be
[59:23] the storehouse and only one quote that
[59:26] says that the word is a storehouse
[59:27] my brother and sister this was a prophet
[59:30] he is not a prophet of the people
[59:32] he is not a prophet of an age in that
[59:35] sense
[59:35] he was a word prophet amen his whole
[59:38] goal his whole desire
[59:40] his whole presentation was to take you
[59:42] and i back to the word
[59:43] not a location we're not muslims we
[59:46] don't have a mecca we don't got some
[59:48] certain place we have to go worship
[59:49] but the word of god is our absolute amen
[59:54] it is the place that we can
[59:55] anchor and there is the storehouse that
[59:58] we can feed on and it don't matter if
[1:00:00] you're in the jungles of
[1:00:02] south america you're in the deserts or
[1:00:04] jungles of africa
[1:00:06] you're in the far north in the cold or
[1:00:08] the far south in the cold
[1:00:10] wherever you might be that storehouse is
[1:00:12] there and the door
[1:00:14] is open to feed us hallelujah you know
[1:00:17] there'll come a time now the prophet of
[1:00:18] god eludes to this and i
[1:00:20] i don't know how it will be because he
[1:00:22] says in other places things that
[1:00:24] seemingly would would not go together
[1:00:27] but my brother and sister i believe that
[1:00:29] we'll come to a time
[1:00:31] that it won't be just a little cake walk
[1:00:33] and then we take a rapture
[1:00:34] there's gonna be a squeeze the prophet
[1:00:36] of god talks about a time
[1:00:38] that a squeeze is gonna cause the bride
[1:00:40] to go into desperation and desperation's
[1:00:42] what's going to get her in the face of
[1:00:44] god did he not say that
[1:00:46] amen and so you look at this what it's
[1:00:48] going to be what if this church becomes
[1:00:50] a storehouse
[1:00:51] what if it comes you know a warehouse
[1:00:53] what if they come and
[1:00:54] and no longer able to say we know that
[1:00:56] you know them and them and them and
[1:00:58] we deny you the right to get together
[1:01:00] them what if you find yourself isolated
[1:01:02] you don't have a telephone any longer
[1:01:04] you don't have this what are you going
[1:01:06] to do with her up and blow away
[1:01:08] no sir you're going to go to the
[1:01:09] storehouse you're going to go right in
[1:01:11] there the door is open you're going to
[1:01:13] feed
[1:01:13] feed feed and rapturing faith is going
[1:01:16] to come to you
[1:01:17] and you'll remember what the word of god
[1:01:18] is he'll lay it on you
[1:01:20] and you will understand it you'll
[1:01:21] confess it and god will honor that i
[1:01:24] tell you my brother and sister don't let
[1:01:25] ourselves
[1:01:26] be caught up in the denomination idea
[1:01:28] that we just have to do this and we have
[1:01:30] to do that
[1:01:31] but come to the place that god would
[1:01:34] come
[1:01:34] and put our priorities put our values in
[1:01:38] the right place
[1:01:39] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:01:42] i'll have to say amen to myself tonight
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:46] and i don't like preachers that amen
[1:01:48] themselves
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:53] now look here i hope you weren't if any
[1:01:56] of you weren't offended about what i
[1:01:57] said right there but it's the truth
[1:02:00] it's the truth we have to realize that
[1:02:02] the storehouse
[1:02:03] is the treasure of the word of god the
[1:02:06] holy ghost
[1:02:08] that was poured in you the life that is
[1:02:11] in you
[1:02:12] i'll share this i shared this with
[1:02:13] sister jerry today i read a book many
[1:02:16] years ago i can't even tell you where
[1:02:18] this took place i'm thinking it was like
[1:02:20] england or europe or something
[1:02:21] and and these men wanted to steal this
[1:02:24] big diamond
[1:02:25] but there was such security around this
[1:02:28] diamond that it was
[1:02:29] impossible to get to the diamond without
[1:02:31] setting off the alarm
[1:02:33] so what they did is they went to every
[1:02:35] public display
[1:02:36] everything every picture they could get
[1:02:38] of this diamond
[1:02:39] and they made a a uh uh a counterfeit
[1:02:43] diamond
[1:02:44] that looked exactly like the diamond
[1:02:48] that was worth so much and they knew
[1:02:51] that the alarms would go off when they
[1:02:52] got close to the diamond
[1:02:54] but you see they chose an avenue that
[1:02:57] would be contrary to the thinking of man
[1:02:59] and so
[1:02:59] they got themselves all prepared and
[1:03:01] they got ready and got
[1:03:03] entrance into that room and boldly they
[1:03:06] didn't try to creep
[1:03:07] up there they knew the alarm would go
[1:03:08] off they took the fake diamond
[1:03:10] went into the room and where all of the
[1:03:13] lasers were shining that were the alarm
[1:03:15] they just simply took their fake diamond
[1:03:17] pulled the real one out
[1:03:19] set the fake one in there and went and
[1:03:21] went back up into the ventilation of the
[1:03:23] building
[1:03:23] and when security flooded into the room
[1:03:26] and they come in there
[1:03:27] and they're looking for somebody who has
[1:03:29] stolen they see
[1:03:32] the diamond
[1:03:35] and they come to a conclusion that it
[1:03:36] was a false alarm
[1:03:39] and while they're concluding it's a
[1:03:41] false alarm
[1:03:42] the thieves are getting away
[1:03:48] you realize saints satan don't have to
[1:03:51] take you away from this message
[1:03:55] he's just got to set something that
[1:03:58] looks
[1:03:59] like the message we'll have the right
[1:04:01] doctrines
[1:04:03] we'll dress walk talk do everything just
[1:04:05] right
[1:04:06] and we'll place value in that
[1:04:10] but the only place we can place value
[1:04:13] is in the real word of god you know the
[1:04:16] holy spirit says that
[1:04:18] we would not even be able to call jesus
[1:04:21] the christ
[1:04:23] without the holy ghost
[1:04:27] but yet the world's full of people that
[1:04:29] say jesus is the christ what does it
[1:04:31] mean
[1:04:33] you'll only be able to discern the real
[1:04:35] jesus christ in our midst my brother and
[1:04:37] sister
[1:04:38] with the holy ghost so it's not a matter
[1:04:40] of how many books or how many tapes or
[1:04:42] what church we attend or who our pastor
[1:04:44] is
[1:04:44] it's that experience that relationship
[1:04:47] of
[1:04:47] jesus christ in our life is why the
[1:04:50] scripture can say
[1:04:51] it would deceive the very elect if it
[1:04:53] were possible
[1:04:55] because with the holy ghost in you it's
[1:04:56] not possible
[1:04:58] but just as an individual as a man or a
[1:05:00] woman or a young person
[1:05:02] it would be possible to be deceived
[1:05:04] that's why it's so important
[1:05:06] that we get the holy ghost because then
[1:05:07] we truly can say
[1:05:09] that jesus is the christ because we know
[1:05:11] him
[1:05:13] hallelujah
[1:05:17] well i could share another little story
[1:05:18] but i won't go there
[1:05:20] i won't go there maybe can i can i go
[1:05:22] there thank you for giving me permission
[1:05:25] once upon a time years ago these people
[1:05:27] had a little project
[1:05:30] and some of them were makeup artists you
[1:05:32] know not
[1:05:33] as in trying to make
[1:05:37] you know weird stuff but like well maybe
[1:05:40] you'd call it weird stuff
[1:05:41] so what they were their little project
[1:05:43] was
[1:05:44] is and all men involved
[1:05:48] i i think this is the funny part the men
[1:05:50] got together all the men involved
[1:05:52] were in it together and they studied
[1:05:54] videos of each other's
[1:05:56] mannerisms and then the makeup
[1:06:00] artist made this man
[1:06:03] like this man and then they tried to see
[1:06:07] if they could fool
[1:06:08] the wife
[1:06:13] sounds fun actually
[1:06:16] but did you know in the end they
[1:06:18] couldn't fool a single one of them
[1:06:20] because there's no way to
[1:06:23] impersonate the personality
[1:06:32] and one of them come in greeted
[1:06:38] his wife and laid the mail down on the
[1:06:42] counter
[1:06:44] and she stopped and said what's wrong
[1:06:45] with you
[1:06:48] and because the man doesn't know he's
[1:06:51] like well
[1:06:52] what do you mean and she says you
[1:06:54] haven't got the mail
[1:06:55] in 20 years
[1:07:01] i hope you get my point amen that's why
[1:07:04] we must know
[1:07:06] christ himself as it were personality
[1:07:10] because we would know him so personal
[1:07:13] the devil could come in
[1:07:14] any form and could not fool us because
[1:07:17] we know him
[1:07:18] personally not just a representation of
[1:07:22] him not just a
[1:07:23] as it were an image of him but the real
[1:07:27] jesus christ in our midst
[1:07:30] hallelujah now
[1:07:36] are we all right now you want to know
[1:07:39] where our hearts are the scripture tells
[1:07:41] us
[1:07:42] that uh in matthew 6 19
[1:07:46] lay not up for yourself treasures upon
[1:07:48] earth
[1:07:49] or moth and rust doth corrupt
[1:07:52] right so any treasure on earth is going
[1:07:54] to corrupt
[1:07:56] and where thieves break through with
[1:07:58] steel but lay up for yourself
[1:08:00] treasures in heaven where neither moth
[1:08:02] nor roth
[1:08:03] doth corrupt and where thieves do not
[1:08:06] break through nor steal
[1:08:07] for where your treasure is there will
[1:08:09] your heart be
[1:08:10] also so as you look at this my brother
[1:08:13] and sister
[1:08:14] you know you look at that it says for
[1:08:16] you where your treasure is is where your
[1:08:17] heart is at
[1:08:18] and now i i say today tonight wanna know
[1:08:22] where your heart is
[1:08:24] oh lord search my heart
[1:08:28] that's what david he cried out to the
[1:08:32] lord lord
[1:08:32] search my heart
[1:08:36] well let's just stop and look what our
[1:08:38] treasure is
[1:08:40] there's where our heart is at where's
[1:08:41] our treasure
[1:08:43] the real bride of christ my brother and
[1:08:45] sister
[1:08:48] she has a different heart you realize
[1:08:50] this
[1:08:51] examination is not for the faint of
[1:08:53] heart you know many people are like i
[1:08:55] don't want my preacher to preach like
[1:08:56] that
[1:08:57] i don't want him to to do that i don't
[1:08:59] want it down in such a personal level
[1:09:01] in fact i would prefer that the preacher
[1:09:03] never make eye contact with me in church
[1:09:05] i in fact i want him to just look i had
[1:09:08] a brother tell me this once
[1:09:09] and it was just he says you know brother
[1:09:11] paul sometimes you'll go preach
[1:09:12] somewhere
[1:09:13] and you realize people just they're just
[1:09:15] not agreeing with you and i said my
[1:09:17] yeah i know what you mean brother he
[1:09:18] goes you know what i do
[1:09:20] he says if they don't have a clock in
[1:09:22] the back of the church i just stare at
[1:09:24] the spot the clock should be
[1:09:26] and i preach
[1:09:32] and some of you hmm
[1:09:36] no my brother and sister this is a
[1:09:38] personal gospel
[1:09:39] it's not a gospel that we hope and pray
[1:09:41] that the preacher don't step on our toes
[1:09:43] we should come to church saying lord let
[1:09:46] him come
[1:09:46] and if there's something shy in my life
[1:09:49] something that shouldn't be there
[1:09:51] let him deal with it lord i give you
[1:09:53] permission lord
[1:09:54] to come and just bear me by the holy
[1:09:57] spirit
[1:09:58] people are like well the preachers got
[1:10:00] it out for me maybe it's god that's got
[1:10:02] it out for you
[1:10:03] maybe he wants to shed these things in
[1:10:05] your life so that you can
[1:10:07] come into a proper position so you see
[1:10:09] this kind of examination is not for the
[1:10:11] faint of heart
[1:10:13] this is not for the person that just
[1:10:14] wants religion
[1:10:16] come on my brother and sister i've said
[1:10:18] this before and i know i'm misunderstood
[1:10:20] i've been kind of
[1:10:21] hacked on this but if we're just coming
[1:10:23] to church for religion's sake let's go
[1:10:24] be mormons they have way more programs
[1:10:26] they have baseball teams basketball
[1:10:28] teams
[1:10:28] they have well anyway hallelujah
[1:10:32] those of you that dance they even have
[1:10:34] dances in their church
[1:10:37] so we're looking for a church for fun
[1:10:40] well hello there's a lot of churches
[1:10:42] have a lot more fun
[1:10:44] reminds me one time we're down in
[1:10:45] phoenix we're driving around and
[1:10:47] a brother tells me he says hey brother
[1:10:49] paul see that big church right there
[1:10:51] i thought it was like a college campus
[1:10:53] and he says no
[1:10:54] no that's like one of the biggest
[1:10:55] churches in phoenix and did you know
[1:10:58] that their summer baseball league
[1:11:00] has 400 men show up to play
[1:11:06] and i said wow i asked how do you know
[1:11:08] it goes oh i work with a man
[1:11:10] change churches so he could be on a team
[1:11:13] over there
[1:11:15] that's what i want church to be about
[1:11:17] hallelujah who's got the winningest team
[1:11:20] who's won the intercollegiate church
[1:11:22] championship
[1:11:23] 10 years in a row
[1:11:26] no sir i'm here because i want god to
[1:11:30] cleanse me wash me prepare me
[1:11:32] because i want to go in the rapture amen
[1:11:35] hallelujah so this is not for the faint
[1:11:38] of heart but this kind of
[1:11:39] examination is for those who are
[1:11:40] committed to be what they're called to
[1:11:42] be
[1:11:43] nothing like falling short my brother
[1:11:45] and sister of the goal that you have set
[1:11:47] before you
[1:11:48] and so you look at that now if you want
[1:11:51] to
[1:11:51] look about the treasure the value of the
[1:11:53] treasure in us
[1:11:55] see you can't place that value on
[1:11:57] yourself right the scripture already
[1:11:58] says that it's in him
[1:12:00] because if you place this value on
[1:12:02] yourself as we use
[1:12:04] this uh phrase which is kind of a take
[1:12:06] off from the scripture that pride cometh
[1:12:08] before the fall
[1:12:10] you know if we start getting lifted up
[1:12:12] hey we we grace are more message than
[1:12:15] they are
[1:12:16] we're more message than they are we're
[1:12:17] more spiritual than they my brother and
[1:12:19] sister that's not what it's about
[1:12:21] it's about us preparing ourselves to be
[1:12:23] washed by the water of the word
[1:12:24] to fulfill what god called you amen
[1:12:29] hallelujah proverbs 11 verses 1 and 2
[1:12:32] i like this scripture a false balance
[1:12:35] and
[1:12:36] abomination to the lord so if we don't
[1:12:38] balance things in our life we judge
[1:12:40] things
[1:12:40] unfairly unbalanced we are an
[1:12:43] abomination to the lord
[1:12:44] but a just wait is his delight when
[1:12:47] pride cometh then cometh shame
[1:12:49] but with the lowly is wisdom god help us
[1:12:52] to put that
[1:12:53] to work in our life amen we're here my
[1:12:56] brother and sister
[1:12:57] not to place a value on this vessel but
[1:13:00] to place a value
[1:13:01] on what he has placed in this vessel
[1:13:05] and if we value what's placed in this
[1:13:07] vessel then we
[1:13:08] do what is best for the atmosphere of
[1:13:12] the holy spirit remember brother branham
[1:13:13] says that the
[1:13:14] holy spirit's like a dove very timid
[1:13:18] when you find boastful and arrogant
[1:13:21] people my brother and sister you very
[1:13:24] rarely find
[1:13:25] the moving of the holy spirit
[1:13:34] in the sermon door inside the door
[1:13:35] brother brown says the eyes open
[1:13:38] we look at flashy things remember
[1:13:40] everything that glitters is not gold
[1:13:42] i've done a lot of prospecting and
[1:13:44] fool's gold which is iron pyrite
[1:13:46] shines a lot brighter than real gold but
[1:13:49] the value in it
[1:13:50] be sure that your eyes see the right
[1:13:53] thing
[1:13:58] amen i'll just throw this in because i
[1:14:02] just recently read it brother brown i'm
[1:14:04] talking about how
[1:14:05] the churches would come to a time that
[1:14:07] they would choose their ministry
[1:14:09] because he was tall good-looking had
[1:14:12] dark wavy hair
[1:14:15] uh oh
[1:14:19] not tall not good looking
[1:14:22] don't have dark wavy hair
[1:14:26] we got trout we got trouble so we got
[1:14:28] problems
[1:14:30] but go look the quote up i'll let you do
[1:14:31] the homework on what the profit of god
[1:14:33] said
[1:14:34] oh i can't help myself
[1:14:37] he said that real believers a real
[1:14:40] church now i'm paraphrasing this a real
[1:14:41] church
[1:14:42] real believers want a man they don't
[1:14:45] care what he looks like
[1:14:46] they want a man that will get in the
[1:14:48] word of god and tell them the truth
[1:14:52] look at the difference tall
[1:14:56] good-looking wavy hair
[1:15:00] my it never was wavy and it's
[1:15:03] well it was wavy it's waving goodbye
[1:15:08] but
[1:15:11] but the american people this this is us
[1:15:14] saints we've just seen so much of god
[1:15:18] god's been so good to us until we don't
[1:15:20] recognize him
[1:15:21] it becomes you say let's go down to the
[1:15:23] meeting to some neighbor
[1:15:25] who's preaching well so and so oral
[1:15:28] roberts
[1:15:28] oh oral roberts is a great man of faith
[1:15:31] oh he has a
[1:15:33] if you'll excuse the inspection a
[1:15:35] bulldog grip he will stand there
[1:15:37] and throw that big hand down and holler
[1:15:39] three or four times
[1:15:40] and if nothing else he will scare the
[1:15:42] devil out of you
[1:15:43] he has such a bulldog grip and he
[1:15:46] believes it and god honors it
[1:15:48] or roberts is my bosom friend a mighty
[1:15:50] man of faith
[1:15:54] oh i've heard
[1:15:58] oral roberts before you say well brother
[1:16:01] branham is down there oh yes
[1:16:03] i've seen brother branham stand up there
[1:16:05] and it'd be a discernment and tell the
[1:16:07] people i've seen that before
[1:16:09] the trouble of it is you've seen so much
[1:16:11] of it
[1:16:13] it's become so common to you till it
[1:16:16] doesn't give
[1:16:17] the results it ought to give
[1:16:22] you realize saints right here in grace
[1:16:25] god has walked the aisles
[1:16:26] of this church over and over again
[1:16:31] we have felt the presence of god
[1:16:32] strongly
[1:16:35] and people walk out into the foyer
[1:16:38] and tell you of their troubles and their
[1:16:41] problems
[1:16:43] and the things in their life
[1:16:46] why weren't they here getting rid of
[1:16:49] those things
[1:16:51] why weren't they taking god at his word
[1:16:53] at his promise and
[1:16:54] saying i want deliverance from the
[1:16:56] spirit that's bothering me tormenting me
[1:16:58] binding me why why is it my brother and
[1:17:01] sister because we've seen
[1:17:02] god do so much it's become so common
[1:17:06] until it doesn't give the results that
[1:17:09] it ought to give
[1:17:10] god help us saints i'm not condemning no
[1:17:14] one
[1:17:14] i'm put myself right out here on the pew
[1:17:16] i'm preaching to myself tonight
[1:17:19] but see if we want results
[1:17:22] we've got to expect results we've got to
[1:17:25] claim results and we've got to actively
[1:17:29] pursue results not sit back and say
[1:17:33] if god wants if god wants
[1:17:36] god wants you to stand up and
[1:17:39] claim what is rightfully yours
[1:17:42] god's not going to force you you know
[1:17:45] i've set in services
[1:17:46] as a young man now figuratively my
[1:17:50] brother and sister this
[1:17:51] seems humorous but in reality
[1:17:55] it's not at all i've sat in services
[1:17:58] where the preacher believing had
[1:18:00] discernment believing he had cause
[1:18:02] would come and come right down in the
[1:18:04] sanctuary
[1:18:05] and maybe grab a young man like brother
[1:18:08] sean's hand
[1:18:09] and reach down here and go boy you are
[1:18:12] going to the altar
[1:18:14] and literally drag them out of their
[1:18:16] seat
[1:18:18] to the altar you know what it did to
[1:18:20] that young man
[1:18:22] yeah he knew there was things in his
[1:18:23] life that weren't right he wants to
[1:18:25] serve god
[1:18:26] but it shamed him it didn't move him
[1:18:30] it shamed him and he's embarrassed
[1:18:32] because now everybody's like what's he
[1:18:34] doing
[1:18:34] what's going on with him but when the
[1:18:37] holy spirit comes down in our midst and
[1:18:39] the word of god speaks to our heart
[1:18:41] and we won't respond it's not hey i just
[1:18:44] didn't want to go up there
[1:18:45] you're not telling brother paul or any
[1:18:47] other preacher no
[1:18:48] you're telling god no
[1:18:54] let's start placing value where we
[1:18:56] should
[1:18:57] let's start pursuing as it were the
[1:19:01] excellence
[1:19:02] of what god has placed in us
[1:19:06] and not put this low value
[1:19:09] that if i feel like
[1:19:12] i'll respond
[1:19:15] you know the old phrase if the shoe fits
[1:19:19] wear it we know that phrase
[1:19:23] i think it's a worldwide phrase i've
[1:19:25] heard it spoken africa
[1:19:27] i've heard it spoken europe i've heard
[1:19:29] it spoken south america
[1:19:31] i've heard it in australia i've heard it
[1:19:34] here in the united states
[1:19:35] and canada if this shoe fits wear it
[1:19:39] why are we so resistant
[1:19:44] because we're not placing the right
[1:19:45] value
[1:19:48] we're not placing the right value not
[1:19:49] placing it in the right position
[1:19:52] are we okay tonight hallelujah
[1:19:57] you know i think we'll just stop right
[1:20:00] there sister emmy would you come
[1:20:02] i'll just read the last of this quote
[1:20:04] i've got it highlighted
[1:20:06] the trouble of it is you've seen so much
[1:20:09] of it
[1:20:10] it's become so common to you till it
[1:20:12] doesn't give the results
[1:20:14] that it ought to give i say tonight
[1:20:17] saints from my heart and like i said i'm
[1:20:19] preaching to paul he's on the pew
[1:20:22] it's time for us to place value where we
[1:20:25] ought to place value
[1:20:27] it's not how we dress or how people view
[1:20:31] us isn't it so silly
[1:20:34] isn't it so silly we worry about what
[1:20:36] people think about what we do or
[1:20:38] how we look or what's going on in our
[1:20:40] life
[1:20:41] we're so consumed with the idea it's
[1:20:44] important that these people
[1:20:46] look up or look up to us or think well
[1:20:48] of us
[1:20:50] what we should be consumed with is
[1:20:53] lord what are you pleased
[1:20:57] because i tell you if we have a church
[1:20:58] of like-minded believers
[1:21:01] no one's going to look at you and say
[1:21:03] well we dress a little better we have a
[1:21:04] little better car a little better house
[1:21:06] we have a house
[1:21:07] we have this we have that but nobody
[1:21:09] cares
[1:21:10] nobody cares if we have a church full of
[1:21:12] like-minded believers we're all going to
[1:21:14] be here
[1:21:14] desiring a moving of the holy spirit in
[1:21:17] our life
[1:21:18] a washing of preparing as it were
[1:21:21] and knowing the best part
[1:21:25] of rejoicing that god would not pour
[1:21:28] the excellency of himself into just any
[1:21:32] old vessel
[1:21:33] but he chose you he chose you he
[1:21:36] anointed you he washed you he prepared
[1:21:38] you
[1:21:39] and he's going to redeem you oh my
[1:21:41] brother and sister
[1:21:42] i was thinking about adding another
[1:21:44] little portion to the scripture
[1:21:46] and maybe we'll just bring that out in
[1:21:48] another time
[1:21:49] but you look at this and realize we
[1:21:52] wouldn't be here tonight
[1:21:54] if it wasn't for god's will if it wasn't
[1:21:57] for god's disney
[1:21:59] this world would have consumed us
[1:22:02] already
[1:22:04] oh god help us saints i pray just
[1:22:08] just take time i ask you that's all i
[1:22:10] can do is just ask you take time
[1:22:13] ask god reestablish the value
[1:22:19] of who he is in our life and who we are
[1:22:22] in the word hallelujah you know i'd like
[1:22:25] to sing that little song
[1:22:27] the same god amen just reading
[1:22:30] as i studying for this and looking
[1:22:32] through things you know i'm brother
[1:22:33] branham
[1:22:35] making the point it's the same god he
[1:22:37] goes and he names all these different
[1:22:39] events that took place in scripture
[1:22:41] and then he makes this emphasis it's the
[1:22:43] same god
[1:22:45] my brother and sister we read the song
[1:22:47] same god part of the red sea
[1:22:49] amen same god brought darkness on egypt
[1:22:52] and light and goshen
[1:22:54] the same god my brother and sister where
[1:22:56] some were there
[1:22:58] and and and you know we look in the dark
[1:23:00] ages and
[1:23:01] and we see the christians being forced
[1:23:03] out on the ice
[1:23:04] and you know they stripped them naked
[1:23:07] that's embarrassing isn't it
[1:23:10] some of us would turn back because we
[1:23:12] just simply wouldn't
[1:23:13] be naked as it were physically because
[1:23:15] the gospel we'd say nope ain't doing
[1:23:16] that
[1:23:18] but god's so anointed a man who is a
[1:23:21] guard
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:25] that he is there took off his sword took
[1:23:27] off at everything and laid it down on
[1:23:29] the ice
[1:23:30] and he told the man that was turning
[1:23:32] back he says don't do this this is
[1:23:34] real this is real the man continued and
[1:23:36] this man
[1:23:37] started shedding his clothes as he
[1:23:40] walked out upon the ice
[1:23:42] because he saw god in flesh
[1:23:45] real before him i want to be that kind
[1:23:48] of believer
[1:23:49] i want to be that kind of man that would
[1:23:51] be able to stand up and say
[1:23:52] this is of god and i don't care what it
[1:23:55] is going to stand out here
[1:23:56] on the ice in a bitter cold day and
[1:23:59] freeze to death
[1:24:00] and i'm willing to do it he could have
[1:24:02] just been a secret believer
[1:24:04] could have walked away from there as a
[1:24:05] soldier and said i think that's right
[1:24:07] you know i'll i'll embrace that
[1:24:10] but he was willing to stand up and say i
[1:24:11] want to be counted
[1:24:13] i want to be counted he placed a value
[1:24:17] where the value should be placed
[1:24:20] oh the same goes i look back
[1:24:25] on history see the mighty god
[1:24:41] but i can't keep on dwelling
[1:24:46] on some past memory
[1:24:52] cause he's a saint god
[1:24:55] who's living in me
[1:25:00] oh the same god is spoke to
[1:25:06] that woman at the well
[1:25:10] he's the same god as wonders
[1:25:15] to marry to tell
[1:25:19] the same god who
[1:25:24] did
[1:25:26] sea he's the same
[1:25:30] god who's living
[1:25:34] in me
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:38] the same god who created
[1:25:42] all the heavens and all the earth
[1:25:47] came back living in jesus
[1:25:50] there's power
[1:25:55] but now in these last days
[1:25:59] i'm beginning to see
[1:26:04] that it's the same god who's
[1:26:08] living in me
[1:26:12] yes the same god is spoke to
[1:26:18] the woman at the well
[1:26:21] he's the same god as wonders

[1:26:34] the raging breathing
[1:26:40] he is the same god who's living
[1:26:44] in me
[1:26:45] [Applause]
[1:26:48] oh the same god who created
[1:26:52] all the heavens and all the earth
[1:26:57] came back living in jesus
[1:27:01] there is power

[1:28:13] one that was
[1:28:14] lost and dying one that wasn't worthy
[1:28:17] one that was
[1:28:18] struggling you never find jesus christ
[1:28:22] condemned him
[1:28:24] he constantly offered you might say the

[1:29:04] give
[1:29:05] get him to give his all
