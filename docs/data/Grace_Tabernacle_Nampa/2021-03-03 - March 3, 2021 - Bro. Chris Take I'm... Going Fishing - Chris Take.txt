testament after mark luke chapter 24. amen luke 24 13. and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs about seven and a half miles and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk and are sad like he didn't already know and one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem who are you man and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yeah and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher and when they found out his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ who have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself i would love to stand on that sermon and they drew near drew nye unto the village where whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abi with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them let's bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus not as we come to partake of the bread of life lord may the man not get in the way lord mother move me out of the way lord i yield myself to you father each one here tonight lord yields their heart lord opens themselves up to you father desiring lord you to come father and lord work on us lord give us great revelation of your word expound to us lord like you did the two on the road to emmaus lord father may we not look to the world around us father and the chaos that we live in but father we would look to the truth the solid foundation which is christ lord in revelation of who you are or a desire to not listen to hear special words or to hear things that are that are new and and lord just great father but lord to hear your word father which is truly great what man calls great you call foolish but when man calls foolish you call great lord i pray you just minister to our hearts may we just yield into your hand tonight lord let you could have your way we thank you for your presence lord now we just give ourselves to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated tonight amen you know my title tonight is i'm going fishing can you put the title up there because the three dots are important i'm going fishing uh the subtitle is follow me so we're going to get to that well first we're going to talk about these two disciples on the road to emmaus you see emmaus actually means warm baths and cleopas which is the one that's mentioned it the name meaning is of a renowned father and i think that we as children of god are of the renowned father the lord jesus christ and so um here we are on the road to emmaus okay we're the same as them tonight and we're going to take a walk i'm in history because these people aren't just stories in the book these were living breathing disciples of jesus christ no different than me and you and this really happened so here they are they they were disciples of christ children of the renowned father and they had been following jesus on the shores of galilee they saw the miracles they saw the great things done and then then they they they had the the last supper and they took jesus the the pharisees and the romans they took him and these two men witnessed the death of what they believed to be the messiah and so all of this transpires and they meet jesus on the road because as as it says they were talking about him and when you talk about the lord he likes he comes by because he likes to sit in on that conversation he loves to be worshipped and when you're talking about him you're worshiping him and so he he steps out of the bushes and he says hey what's going on um what are you what are you guys lamenting about what are you discouraged about and they they said you know because anybody in the know would know that jesus had been crucified it was the headlines of the paper and um there this man now approaches them and doesn't know what's going on or what's being talked about and there's a little bit taken back and and kind of you know you kind of get this impression that cleopas just starts to vent right he's frustrated he's discouraged he's venting he's saying you know this man that that that we follow uh i'm gonna pick the scripture up here for reference he says uh a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people and the the chief priests they took him they condemned him and they crucified him he says but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done and so there's uh there's this this this uh statement made that you know this was who we trusted to have been the redeemed to to to redeem israel this was the messiah or so we thought is what cleopas is saying and then he says oh and by the way the the women they went to the sepulcher and they say you know this that or the other and so they're discouraged and um i don't know if i picked up the quote um here i did so we'll get to it now actually no we're just going to go with this okay so brother adam says in proof of his resurrection he said um let me make sure this is the right quote oh yeah so he's talking about the these two other rotimates he says oh how could that man ever fail how could he ever let us down like this and now we stand in shame and disgrace we are going back home to start up our fishing and carpentering again so we'll finish that quote later but so you see the state these guys are in they're like they left everything right they they put their the the um their lathe down their their their chisels they put down their nets and they went to follow jesus the messiah and they saw great evidence that this was who they've been looking for they saw great evidence that this was the man that the scripture said he even had a virgin birth this is him yet something happened something happened he was crucified he's dead so they're saying okay he's dead what's the point now right okay so what happened here is is things didn't go how they thought they would go they had this vision in their mind now you see you had cleophas and his friend and then you have the pharisees the sadducees the pharisees and sadducees turned him down nothing that he did or said they said this man is upbeat was above because they had an idea in their mind of how things should go that's one side of it but then you know you have like you have this thought in your head you know about how thing an event is going to transpire you you're excited about it and then it happens and it comes and then you're kind of let down because it didn't go exactly how you thought in your head that's carnal nature and sometimes it can be a very important thing and and you thought things were a certain way and and by all reasons they were but then something changed and now it's not panning out how you thought it would it's very discouraging right and so here is cleopas and and his friend here and talk about coming off a high they were on the mountain elevated off the mountain they're walking with jesus the messiah for who knows how long we're gonna say three and a half years from the time he called in the beginning of his of his ministry jesus began to call the disciples perhaps they were part of that group and um they've been they've seen all this stuff john says in the book in in the gospel of john it says you know there's no way we could have written everything we saw jesus do there wouldn't be enough books to cover the books would fill the world the earth and they were a part of this they were there day in and day out seeing all of these miracles happen and everything testifying i want you to catch this now everything testifying that jesus was the messiah but then one thing changed he died one thing changed one thing was different than their carnal understanding of what the messiah would do but the scripture says they didn't remember the scripture they didn't remember the scripture about what would happen and that how he would die and raise again it's right there i don't remember which book it is i read it tonight i just didn't write it down it says they forgot the scripture that's right so yet everything panned out right to according to their revelation until he died then they said oh this can't be him or they just didn't know what was going on they were discouraged one thing happened that was contrary to their carnal understanding and here they are saying never mind we're going back to emmaus warm baths or laodicea i like to say going back to warm right it doesn't say lukewarm but it doesn't say cold it doesn't say hot baths or cold baths it says warm baths they're going back to what they thought what they knew was familiar okay so we were wrong but what jesus does when he steps on the path with him is he begins he preaches himself from genesis to revelations he preaches himself to them but what is he doing he's reminding them they already know what the scripture says but he is reminding them look you forgot you let one thing change your mind you say well that one thing was big it doesn't matter he says stop look at the whole picture step back and look at the whole picture they were basing their conclusion of his death on circumstantial evidence you say well they saw it happen right but that's not how god works god doesn't work by what you can see all the time so you see a death but that's just circumstantial evidence that he's defeated there's something about that that that isn't known or was forgotten and circumstantial evidence i just wanted to put this in here because i didn't even know what it was i just knew i'd heard about it circumstantial evidence in law evidence not drawn from direct observations of a fact in issue if a witness testifies that he saw a defendant fire a bullet into the body of a person who then died this is direct testimony material facts in murder and the only question is whether the witness is telling the truth if however the witness is able to testify only that he heard the shot and that he arrived on the scene seconds later to see the accused standing over the corpse with a smoking pistol in his hand the evidence is circumstantial the accused may have been shooting at the escaping killer or merely have been a bystander who picked up the weapon after the killer had dropped it so just because they saw him die they assumed all was lost they assumed that this evidence was not circumstantial that it was factual but it was just circumstantial evidence because they were basing what they saw of what they knew death means you don't come back but in god's kingdom that what happened there is just circumstantial evidence it is not the truth or whether or not that person will never come in i'm not talking about the resurrection i'm talking about now yet how many testimonies do you have of people being raised from the dead you say well that's impossible not in the kingdom of god death is just circumstantial evidence and so here we in in other words you can't base a verdict off of what you saw that's what that is right circumstantial evidence you can't say that person's not going to come back because you saw them die they saw jesus die that didn't mean anything but it was different to what they thought it would be i hope you're catching this thing so if they would have stood back and eventually they did stood back to look at the whole picture say okay he died yes let's set that on the table but what about everything else he did that proved him to be who he said he was what about every see what happens is is as we get something happens and that's all we see we hear one thing about someone and then that we are to think about that and when we see that person so yeah i think that's the way they this other person said they were yeah but see that's circumstantial evidence i had some this at work somebody told me some stuff that was pretty uh not good about a person you know and it bothered me at first i was like whoa am i missing something so i studied the this other person when i'm interactions with them i would watch them you can tell a lot about a person with how they interact and and i i just kept telling my wife i'm not picking up on any of what they said then sort of think about who they were and who they were talking to i was like oh i realized what they were saying was coming from someone else who has a jealousy problem so what they saw was not actually what they saw it's what they wanted to see so if i stood back and by god's grace i didn't i looked at the whole picture my interactions with him from the very beginning to the very end and to present none of that lines up if you take the message this is the big thing right now right it's a message look at the whole thing did he say it he said it that it wasn't this who cares look at everything that was preached it's not is it not truth find it in the scripture where it was not truth order wasn't corrected later on praise the lord so what happened was cleopas and his friend they they they got so discouraged and this is what happens to us sometimes they got so discouraged their eyes kind of filmed over they forgot everything else all right sometimes you get in the heat of a moment you get that fight-or-flight mentality and your brain something kicks in you just you can't even talk you forget how to talk that happened to me one time there was a loud crash in the basement and i thought someone busted through my front window and i couldn't even speak oh my god that's all i came out of my mouth and so fear or things they do that to you and and you just freeze up you know if i asked uh you know sean come up here and and speak for 30 minutes you know he may or may not just uh um right depends on the person but you freeze up sometimes so they they got super discouraged and we get discouraged on sometimes and we oh you know we get to look at our circumstances and we we think oh you know nothing's right nothing's good i'm gonna tell my little girl something bad will happen and she'll just say oh this whole day is terrible right we do that sometimes too we all this you know we we sp we're driving to work we're tired we spill our coffee all over our lap now we stink like coffee because coffee when it's spilled on you stinks it smells good in the cup but it doesn't mix well with cotton i guess i don't know and now it's the day's ruined right but sometimes and sometimes the circumstances can be even more overwhelming but god's grace comes along and walks with you on the road to erase he didn't he didn't say hold on guys stop you're going the wrong way you need to go that way he just said hey how's it going and he walked with him what are you guys talking about oh okay okay okay he heard them out he listened then he says you fools apparently they were so discouraged they didn't even care because let's be honest if someone said that you'd be like huh you say what right they're just kind of like whatever i guess we are right talk about discouraged and so he begins to tell them and remind them okay so you can't yes look at the whole picture you can't go and go back through everything he said everything the word said then draw your conclusion not from circle circumstantial evidence but from the word never ever base your eternal security on circumstantial evidence they said she said he saw they said she said he saw he said they said she saw the dr seuss book he well well this guy said brother branham said this so i have the privilege privilege i don't know if i can call it that of knowing somebody who is part of the i don't know the believe the sign thing and and they say stuff every once in a while and god's given me the grace and putting the words in my mouth but they say stuff that's not even anywhere in the message because somebody they know said that which is hilarious because you think about it that's totally hypocritical because that's what they're blaming us for doing anyways because they're basing their assumption off of circumstantial evidence because it's what they want to believe okay they simply have circumstantial evidence and they are misinformed but here's the deal with the word of god the catch-22 if you're looking for christ you'll find him in every line every word every scripture if you're looking for him if you're looking for mistakes and contradictions you'll find those instead every line every scripture every verse you'll find a contradiction because the word of god is not just any old book that's right it's alive it's the word of god it's the bread of life and it was written in such a way to have that effect because god doesn't want everybody he only wants who he called so we've got to thank him for his grace for calling us but but everybody gets a chance everybody gets a chance everything about the christian life revolves around your heart and soul amen it's revelation it's faith you have to believe it you can't answer every question i'm sorry you can't if you could the lord wouldn't be revealing himself to us for eternity and that's scripture praise the lord so the cleopas and his friend got discouraged they started looking at circumstantial evidence and they started they based their assumption of the messiah on what they saw happen that hope he died everything else has to be false i can't find the newspaper clipping it all has to be false if amen the two on the road were looking to their circumstances but god's grace jesus came by he said and he he came by why because they belong to the kingdom well i think these people are out here you never know who's going to be who okay but these people out here will just mask them together because it's a spirit the tears and the wheat being bound up together but where am i going with that but why why did why are they allowed to just go to emmaus without ever encountering jesus the reason cleopas and his friend encountered jesus because they were children of the kingdom at some point in time you may or may have encountered a spirit of doubt is this true i remember one time i was out in the village civic alaska right on the bering sea and i was getting ready to preach i'm in the office right i'm praying you're in the office back there you know get ready to preach your adrenaline i just i have to move my legs i'm just you know getting worked up and nervous and that's just you're just kind of not not to uh be sacrilegious but you're kind of getting in the zone right it's like you're fixing to go out and box you know your shoulders are getting robbed you're getting warmed up you're you're praying you're you're laying in the unknown the anointing and and making sure and everything and and all of a sudden boom this message is false brother branham's a liar that's what i was going through this the the anointing went away and i was just standing there like i'm ready to go to preach and i don't even believe the message that's the thoughts going through my head right and i i i was like man this is incredible i i was like what what's going on right because by the grace of god he'll never give you anything you can't handle so even though these thoughts are going through my head these strong thoughts of doubt still that voice in my heart was like you're just wrestling with the spirit and so i begin to talk out loud you might try this sometime and i said okay devil so it's a lie what about when god did this okay you think it's not true what about when god did this and i sort of testify what god did in my life people i knew testimonies i'd heard to be true and confirmed and i could testify next thing i know he tucked his tail and ran out the door and the spirit of the lord came down and we had a wonderful service not sure why i said that because god came by jesus came by that spirit of doubt came along but jesus came by where the man preaches the uh evangelistic sermon jesus then jesus came praise the lord and so this is the same thing that happened to cleopas and his friend they needed to be reminded who they were he preached to them part one of christ is the mystery of god revealed he did something in their hearts connected deep color to the deep they begged him to stay you have to ask him to stay you have to ask him he's a gentleman hey lord i need you he likes to be needed he likes to be asked for help then what did he do he broke bread in their presence bread is what life bread of life who is the bread of life christ before their eye and then their eyes were open he broke the bread just like in our day he broke the bread he revealed himself to us our eyes were opened amen we went back to the faith of our fathers christ broke the bread and ormas the bread a type of the word of god being broken opened up to them then their eyes were open and he vanished but they went back to jerusalem to be with the other believers they had a full complete revelation they were hearing the word being preached from jesus but it wasn't until he opened their eyes that they had a revelation of who he was and went back to to to the other disciples so now we're gonna pick this quote up again proof of his resurrection 1955 and paragraph 134 isn't that just the modern christian today we'll restart oh how how could that man ever fail how could he ever let us down like that like this and now we stand in shame and disgrace we are going back home to start up our fishing and carpentering again see isn't that just a modern christian today oh let the healing take place and they're shouting the victory let the power of the holy spirit fall and they're shouting the victory and those who are really filled with the holy ghost remains that way down through life's journey but the man that's still walking with the carnal mind little discouragement come up something go wrong and they go away saying well i thought it was all right but oh my look at it now i thought that little church would never fail i thought this person oh saints watch that it's not one person it's never ever one person it's not me it's not our pastor it's not brother david it's not brother jason it's not one person there's nothing to do with that for you you get to christ because i let me tell you i'm going to fail you because i'm a human i pray that god has grace and you forgive me when i do i'm going to say something and i'm going to offend you maybe i already have because we're human beings but the grace of god what is it love covers a multitude of sins offenses you got he said you got your mind on the wrong thing see but he says put your mind on him that can't fail let your conversation not be about your church lord i convicted me because i've been guilty of that maybe not my church but churches stop talking about it leave them to their own wheat leave them to their own grass you have your own you eat it you feed on the word of god he says let your conversation not be about your church but about your lord that's the one not about your neighbor but about your lord let your conversations be of him you'll never get in trouble if you talk about jesus that's right talk about your neighbor your neighbor might walk up or the person you're talking to might talk to your neighbor stop talking about this preacher that church or that pastor focus on christ there will be a lot less problems if we all just shut up praise the lord be a lot less problems amen so let's let's go over in our bibles to john chapter 21. praise the lord oh that's after luke there okay john chapter 21 verse three oh i'm sorry respond after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberius and on this wise showed he himself there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana and galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples simon pierce said it saith unto them i go fishing there my title they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come jesus was on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus they said then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it up for the multitude of fishes therefore the disciples whom jesus the disciple whom jesus loves saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he gird his fisher's coat onto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes as soon as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid there on and bread jesus saith unto them bring up the fish which he have now caught simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes and hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken he just saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciples just ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord so now here we have peter and brother um here we so here we have peter now the this the scripture says jesus showed himself again to the disciples and then at the end of towards the end of the chapter it says that this was this was the third time he appeared unto them so we're going to just kind of take a little bit of liberty here in this story and we're going to go with this the lord had risen from the dead peter denied the lord three times he cursed and denied the lord three times that he even knew him then the lord comes back and you don't we don't read of any interactions between the lord and peter we hear the lord appearing to the two honor roche maest and he appears as they're eating a meal and it shows himself to them but we don't read of any interactions with peter so we're going to take that and we're going to tell this little story tonight and so here's the lord risen from the dead he interpreted his word by bringing it to pass but then he went away they saw him peter saw him once he appeared into their midst and then we don't know where he went after that but here's peter and and and and he peter was perhaps now confused the lord raised from the because guess what the lord raised from the dead and peter says i'm going to go fishing that doesn't make sense why wouldn't peter go tell everybody that jesus rose from the dead because he did eventually you see so there's something going on in peter he's discouraged about something he's confused he doesn't know what's going on okay the lord raised from the dead did we really see him was that really him alive there in the room you know what guys i'm going fishing i don't understand because you know peter peter was a rough guy who spoke his mind a little bit outrageous out of control and you get the impression that he likes things in his control he drew the sword and chopped the guy's ear off right and then he you know he he tried to to uh um he was getting mad at them at the people for breaking the roof in his house and and he he he's a man who likes to be in control of what's around him and now he's completely he has no control on what's happening and he doesn't know exactly what's going on yet we're going to take this liberty if you feel differently so so he says what's next what's going on he's discouraged i'm going fishing that's why it's i'm dot dot dot going fishing i'm going fishing and the disciples are like you know what man we're going with you let's go fishing perhaps peter's thinking it to himself you know i don't understand all this all this this stuff over here it's it's different and then i don't know what's going on but i know how to fish i can control fishing so they went and they caught nothing i don't know how many of y'all fish but when i go fishing and i catch nothing i really enjoy myself i still do but if you're fishing and your friend's fishing and he's catching his limit and you're getting nothing it's frustrating have you caught any fish no fished all night no fish this is what i do for a living peter turns to john this is what i do for a living bro and i haven't caught nothing i can't even catch a fish i can't i can't even i can't even uh um stand up for my lord i deny him three times john's like whoa i thought we're talking about fish i i can't do anything i can't even fish i i what am i doing here john why why do i even live i should just jump overboard and let it take me to the bottom what's the point of all this did we see jesus was he real was he alive is it truth is he the messiah or was that some kind of ghost or some fig in a figment of our imagination i thought i could fish and now i can't even i caught nothing who who is this joker on the shore no no fish do you see fish he's discouraged throw your net on the other side he doesn't argue why because he did the first time and then he cast his net and he couldn't drag it to shore throw your net on the other side peter and his heart goes i've heard that before yes sir i've heard that before come on guys throw the net over toss the net over the side one more time peter we've been out here all night bro you're really losing it we don't even know who that guy is he's probably over there laughing at us because we're throwing our net like he said on the right side let me ask it john uh peter what's the difference between the right side of the ship and the left side of the ship five and a half feet just throw it overboard they throw it overboard and they can't even they barely drag it to shore now i'm just gonna take it as as it's red here simon peter pulls the net of fish onto the shores what it says didn't say anybody helped him 153 fish the fish they caught were tilapia galilee tilapia 13 to 15 pounds apiece but the spiral says great fishes so we'll say 15. that's 2500 pounds of fish peter just dragged down to the shore by himself big strong guy fun tidbits i don't even know if that's important but anyways the lafayette sounds good on the fire right now and so here they are and and now we see we see peter you know he thought he blew it and then the lord blesses him with all these fish and john says peter it's the lord boom out of the boat he goes to shore you ever been discouraged sometimes and god blesses you just to remind you how much he loves you how much he cares for you here's peter discouraged god doesn't come up and knock it off son he says here have 153 fish that's good money no matter what you do god comes along right and he says hey son it's okay there's this song the yantz brothers wrote do you know grace amazing grace have you heard how sweet the sound and i think it was at the the camping bible way he tells the testimony and how he the brother who wrote it remember his name louis um lineal's brother he had a dream and it's like he fell down in the dream and and and and he saw himself fall down and uh you know it's like he was gonna go say hey come on son get up knock it off but instead he was like he said he said he just wanted to pick him up and hold him close and say it's going to be okay and he said his that was like the lore with me i fall down and get all skinned up and he doesn't come along and whip me up say get up son knock it off he pulls me in close and says i love you here's peter discouraged denied the lord three times cursing while doing it god says here's some fish peter i love you he goes to shore and now he pulls peter aside when they had died jesus said to simon peter verse 15. simon son of jonas loveth thou me more than these what is these his brothers the fish thus life these what what is your these that god is asking do you love me more than all of this do you love me more than this peter peter says and now i can see this in my head just as real as as you all here's peter discouraged the lord pulls him aside just him and peter not john the beloved of the lord not the other disciples pulls peter aside knowing he denied him three times cursing denied him cussing bad words i don't know blank that guy blank talk to me i don't know him right just like you hear on the street people say he said peter the one giving the keys to the kingdom the lord pulls him aside says peter do you love me all more than this i can just see peter get a little choked up yes lord yes what does he say yea lord thou knowest that i love thee yea lord thou noah said i love thee exactly though peter denied him three times god could see his heart and he knew that the flesh was contradicting how peter actually felt inside sometimes you meet people they have the most arrogant attitude you can't even stomach their ego because inside they're a hurt little boy or they're a hurt little girl and you gotta look past that shell that that you just want to punch and look into their heart and say they're acting like that because they're afraid of the world and you reach out to them and you show them the love of christ they might spit in your face but at least you did your part and they may come back later and say thank you right you don't know so he says peter do you love me he says lord you know that thou knowest that i love you he says unto him feed my lambs he say it to him again the second time because peter is thinking i can't i denied him in the pressure how am i gonna preach how am i gonna feed the lambs how am i gonna do this i i couldn't even stand the pressure and confess i knew him the lord pulls him in again and says peter do you love me yay lord now no one said i love me he says unto him feed my sheep peter's still having a hard time i wish i could remember but i heard one time three times he denied him three times jesus asked do you love me feed my sheep he said unto him the third time simon son of jonas loveth thou me the lord gave him three chances to redeem what he said before for every time he denied him god gave him the chance to confess him and his love for him he says he says peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time loveth thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus says unto him feed my sheep verily verily i say unto thee when thou was young thou gerdest walk as dither thou woodest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hand and another shall gird thee and carry thee wither thou wouldest not this spake signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me amen oh saint god has such grace god has such mercy god has such love for you pulling you aside giving you the chance to confess your love to him and then he has two simple words follow me follow me then peter turning about sees the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breasts that supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee excuse me so that's what he said at the supper and then 21 peter seeing him say to jesus lord and what shall this man do the lord pulls him aside i think i think it is it's significant feed my sheep follow me then he says he begins to look at the other preacher or the other pastor or the other church what about them what about the situation over here what about what you said about this the lord says something that we can take to heart tonight if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee what does it matter what i do with them or what they're doing with them follow me he says follow thou me r in other words the lord paul peterson says peter in other words he says peter you are forgiven he doesn't approach the subject he just pulls him in close letting him know peter you are forgiven have courage and go do what i called you to do because pete god the lord gave peter the key to the kingdom yeah what does peter peter do when the lord goes he goes fishing discouraged yet believing he's able to do what god asked him to do so god pulls him in go do what i called you to do john we already read the scripture so just follow him whether you fully understand it or not excuse me he hasn't asked you for your theology he doesn't ask you to have an answer for everything happening around you he said simply follow me when you ask him lord what about this he says what is it to you follow me what about what about this did this really happen what does it matter follow me because if you follow christ he will lead you to all all truth there's nothing you can do to separate yourself from the love of god there's nothing you can do to separate yourself from the love of god amen there's a song i'm trying to remember there's the words to it i just can't remember it basically it's a song as it goes the lady sat down to counsel with this pastor and she says you know i've done all this how how could i come back just to serve to to you know how how could the lord even want me now what because of what i've done and uh man i can't remember the words basically uh does it he oh that's what it is he'll do whatever it takes he'll he'll go lower than your worst mistake he'll do whatever it takes maybe i'll sing that sometime you see it's not about your ability it's about faith in history goodness gracious if it was up to us i wouldn't be here god places the gift in my life to minister and i love following what god has called me to do so when i say this it's a bib tongue-in-cheek do you think i want to be a preacher but you can't get past it because what god calls you to do and you find joy and inspiration in it but the carnal flesh he doesn't want to do this the carnal flesh doesn't want to raise their hands wednesday night carl fletcher doesn't want to be here wednesday night it's not about your ability it's about faith in his it's not about your accomplishments it's about his victory it's not you about your understanding it's about revelation only he can give next time you decide to just go back to emmaus or just go fishing remember these words follow me next time you find something magicians you want to come tonight next time you find something you just you just girl you can't get over it you can't get it out of your head remember follow me follow me say to god it's that simple you say oh you see these people we left and now we just follow jesus and they're living a life directly contrary to the scripture they don't have revelation for one thing and what does it matter what they're doing it grieves me to bring that up but it it just comes up i don't put it in my notes it just comes up and that's because that's just what we're dealing with right now right you understand that i'm not pointing my fingers at any man or any people um it doesn't matter what they're doing that's why we don't read their stuff let them know who cares what they say when they try to tell you that tell you they try to preach their doctrine to you if you have to just hang up the phone if you have to mute their notifications on their on whatever message or whatever it is delete their conversation block their phone number i give you permission even if they're your relation because you don't have to be subject to their gospel you don't have to accept it in the carnal in the on the on the the secular carnal side i i i encourage you to to there's books on what's called boundaries boundaries with people but as a message believer we have boundaries why because do i fear that they're going to convince me otherwise absolutely not but guess what i'm flesh i'm man remember and when i read their stuff the man rears up and starts to scream down in my head i don't want to deal with that that is just going to bring me down do you want do you do you want to go and hear negative stuff all the time it actually makes you physically ill did you know that negative people get sick being around negative people can make you sick why do you think you just feel ugh when it's cloudy for days or rainy for days because you get depressed the sun comes out today was a beautiful day by the way i hope you got outside and got some of that sun because we're so much affected by what's around us and the atmospheres we're in so if you want to be the best christian you can possibly be what atmosphere should you always be in the atmosphere of the lord because that's going to build you up every time you get tore down okay did you know when you fly an airplane but the david here knows if you push down you have to pull back up to go up you can't just you know how you steer you turn around the corner and they let go the wheel and it straightens itself out you can't turn in an airplane and let go and let it straighten itself out you got to turn back the other way that's one thing you got to learn at first you know a little bit of rudder a little bit of turning of the yolk if you're not careful you go the whole time fine i've done it you have to learn to turn it and then turn it back right at the right minute so you level out it's harder than you think to get those wings to go flat the same thing every time you do something that brings you down or turns you the wrong way you can just let go and play oh it's going to be okay you got to take the yolk and you got to turn back and you got to be careful because if you overturn you get legalistic you got to just turn it right just knees it in hey as you start to see that the wings swing over that bubble start to come into its spot you step on the bubble okay right rudder the bubble's going right step on the right rudder pull that in little yaw right bring it right in flat and then you can get a little wheel there right it's been a while since i'm flying but flow but you can adjust it and then you can hands off right trim thank you you can trim it right not your hair you trim it okay and then it then it's coasting along but when the weather gets rough now we're not talking about 737's talking about small airplanes small engine plane the weather gets rough you got to have your hands in the controls you gotta fly through that storm guess what god is the best he's not really your co-pilot he's the pilot you're the co-pilot god will bring you right through he'll bring you right through the storm i mentioned a story here a while ago there's a he was called the bush pilot doctor he flew to remote places in alaska to give medical attention to people and he was a what you call fairweather pilot he had never gone through a serious storm right small airplanes for the most part don't have instrument rating you can't fly ifrs instruments you have to fly via visual flat rooms and so um he got through into this they had to go through this path and it just closed in right airplane airplane can't just go above the clouds and fly over the mountains there's wind up there flip that thing right over so he's going through the valley and through the valley and it's muggy right next thing you know all he sees is white you can't see the ground he can't see the blue sky what happens is your head goes upside down with that and you get vertigo and so a more experienced pilot had already made it through and he said okay keep no matter what you feel keep watch the instrument keep it flat keep it lined up you're not upside down here's the other pilot talking in through the valley you're not upside down keep flying and fly this heading [Music] he couldn't look at around him if he looked past the windshield and out the door out of the side he would have got disorientated tried to turn try to go and he would plow right into the side of the mountain but he had some on the other side he couldn't see the other pilot but he could hear him you can't see christ per se but you can hear him and he's saying heading 360. keep it steady keep it flat keep it level some pilots used to put a glass of water on there dash right because you know if the water's in the cup you're right side up [Music] it's true it sounds silly but you need that when you're in those conditions so what i'm saying is when you get to a valley and you can't see up or down hands on the yoke and listen to the voice and follow your heading and you will make it completely through to the other side the clouds will split and you'll see the sun and you'll know you were right side up follow me praise the lord let's stand [Music] tonight amen let's pray heavenly father lord jesus lord i thank you for your word tonight thank you for being with your people lord and always lord we're never out of range of the tower on the flight of life we always have a good solid connection and
