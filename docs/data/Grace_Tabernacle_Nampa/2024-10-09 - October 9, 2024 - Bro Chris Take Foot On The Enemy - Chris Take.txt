them tonight we pray in Jesus name amen praise the Lord thank you brother Alex musicians amen if you have your Bibles please stand with me I want to read from James chapter 1 amen our hearts are with the dean Hearts tonight we know that uh this is the greatest moment in brother Bob's life but uh also the hardest for his family James 1: 18 while you're turning there I want to read from 1 Corinthians 13 verse1 says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things James 1:8 of his own will he begot he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures so James pulling directly from the ministry of Jesus he understands that by the New Birth the new birth of his own will the new birth to us through the word of truth because it was with the word of truth that we receive the new birth and then by the fuit fruits of that we become a kind of first fruits of his creatures so we are New Creation in Christ Jesus to look and act like Christ himself verse 19 wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to wrath Lord help us for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God you know one of the biggest things that disappears with anger is patience so right here let us not let it be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath when we get in a hurry that's where we deal with anger the most wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be you doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetthe into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain so don't just talk it walk it pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated tonight I my my subject this evening is or excuse me my title this evening is um foot on the enemy and my subtitle is avoiding the Trap of a self-centered life James here is referring to looking in a glass and and this is where we draw from from text that of the uh the subject on looking in the mirror of God's word and I and I and I have uh I have come to find out that the hardest part in the journey as a Christian is seeing yourself truly in the mirror of God's word and and seeing your discrepancies coming face to face with your inadequacies coming face to face with the realization that you are not all you thought you were and that's uh a place of humbleness humility Brokenness it's it's not easy and brother bham says in perfect strength by Perfect weakness he says I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William brandham he's the one that that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he is out of the way then God can come over and do things that William brandham knows nothing about that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we get ourselves in the way then we cannot so there's there's there's a couple of different ways we we we have self-centered is is is in our subject and what does it mean to be self-centered well the natural definition is a focus on one's own needs desires and interests above those of others involves prioritizing personal goals Comforts and opinions without regard for how one's actions affect others a self-c center person tends to view situations primarily from their own perspective we have we because we are a self we all are self we all are humans um do not Pitchfork this definition to anybody else this is us every single day of our life I was listening to questions and answers and brother benham's he's preaching along and he says he says you backslide every day he says that's why Paul said I Die daily so in order for it us to lead a successful life then as a Christian every day we must commit ourselves back to God we must surrender ourselves back to God we must we must lay oursel down at his feet and and and every day we must remember now you can you can reflect on your personal mistakes without it being a hindrance to your self-esteem that is the trick the trick is that is where we need God the most because lots of people have an understanding of their mistakes perhaps and in doing so become become low in self-confidence and have a low self-esteem they won't look you in the eye they they don't have any courage to do anything in life they just feel like they're miserable wretches but the problem with that is that you they saw a discrepancy in themselves and instead of realizing that that's an attribute and that is not them that is an attribute of them that is that is a characteristic of the of themselves but that is not something that is permanent nobody has to stay bad nobody has to stay bad we have the blood of Jesus Christ to fix that so there there's two ways you can come face to face with yourself and and if you and if you receive it in such a way where where you you say well I'm just no good you're actually you're actually not accepting though you though you are by by appearance accepting this m this discrepancy in your character this flaw in your character though you are accepting it you're actually accepting it through a selfish motive in that you now you take that discrepancy and you say see I knew I was worth nothing and now you want somebody to come along and tell you no you are amazing you are worth everything you are all of this instead of coming instead of coming to a place where you see it and you say God help me fix that so see there's two ways you can receive it and I've seen this in my own self now I'm just going to preach at myself tonight because this is this is a slippery slope to begin to point fingers I I think I think tonight the the subject that we're speaking on on I I would ask that you don't wound the effect uh this Revelation can have on your life by casting it onto someone else that's the first thing we can do when we begin to talk about self-centeredness and selfishness we can think we think of somebody but if you're thinking of somebody somebody's think thinking about you we all have this this this this thing and so so I'm going to preach that myself tonight so I have done this where I have I have someone has come to me and said you know brother Chris you are doing this and we don't appreciate it or it's not correct now it is my job to take it to the Lord and say Lord is this something I need to change because as a minister you know you're public facing people won't always agree with what you have to say but as long as you know you said what God put in his word then that's for something for them and that's not something you need to go change but if if it's something that is a discrepancy in your character it is your obligation to God and to the public and to your brothers and sisters to take that to the throne of grace and say God change me but it if you take it and then and then it causes self low self-esteem where you get you get you put yourself down and I'm I'll just say this one more time cuz I'm trying to get it out correctly instead of saying I need to fix this you just hold on to it you say well this is who I am nobody likes me but that's not the way we should do it so self-centeredness is often lacking it empathy humility or consideration for the feelings and needs of others you know the world that we live in today everybody's telling you you know you need a day off you need to um you know take a hot bath with epsom salt you need to you need to go to the spa you need you need to treat yourself you need to take care of yourself when actually the the the greatest antidote to uh to depression is living for other people says if you're doing if you're if you're if he said if you're if you're always that one that you know you want your way and all these things he says do the direct opposite start to give out to others so we see that the Rich Young Ruler in the scriptures this was the biggest thing he struggled with because if he was not self-centered he would have had no issues giving everything he had away but he was he thought he was important because of the money that he had so he was identified by the the quantity of what he held on he was he he had he had wrapped his identity into an object money is an object he had wrapped himself into into into this thing and so that can be applied to many things in our life even discrepancies we can wrap up our our identity into something uh that is that is a flaw in our character we can become identified by that thing and if we're not careful when that thing becomes challenged and we and and and we realize it's it's somebody says this is wrong because we have identified oursel with it for so long we will look to that person and say you have something against me because God uses one another uses each of us to show us and you know it's the old old adage that says the thing that bothers you most in somebody else is probably the main problem you have so self-centered individuals may have a difficulty considering how their actions affect those around them and may seek constant atten attention or validation now I pulled this these definitions kind of from online and and this really this really struck a chord for me in my studying it says may seek constant attention or validation you know you would think it that you wouldn't think it a a bad thing to look to someone and say you know did I do okay but yet that is that is that is a a characteristic of being self-centered now not in the not in the way of saying like to my wife like honey in that conversation did I handle myself correctly that's different right you're now you're you're looking for feedback you go to your manager you say hey how did I handle that that that that meeting we had or you go to your your your friend your buddy and say hey you know what when I talked to that person and you were there you know did I how did I handle that right that's that's getting cultivating feedback saying Hey did I did I do it right did I have a did I was I respectful but but instead of but that's not self validation that's checking to see hey am I handling myself correctly we need friends around us to to to do that for us but this validation here is is looking saying you know am I cool enough did I did I did I you know it's it's it comes from a place of they're unsure of themselves they're they're they're not and and it really is it really is a paradox how characteristics of selfishness some of them R hide themselves in the fact that that we just need to be nicer to each other but that's not not the problem the problem is we are selfish we we should be able to stand knowing hey God put me here should be able to stand and and and and and have a conversation and and witness and do your job and and take care of your family and and come to church because you have a desire to please God if if we're going to church to please other people even in trying to please other people we can be selfish because because what we're trying to do is make ourselves look better you say well going to church is a good thing encouraging our brother is a good thing but what is your motive and objective the objective is to encourage your brother all right we can all agree that's a good thing but what is the motive behind it why are you wanting to encourage encourage your brother is it because you want him to say you encouraged me why do you want to why do you want to you know sorry Titus you walked up why do you want to play the violin is it to just simply Express the gift to God or do you want someone to see you playing the violin why do you clean the church because you want someone to know hey they clean the church see objective many many many times we have the objective correct and because we have the objective correct we think the motive is correct by proxy but it's not you can have the right objective and the wrong motive you can have the right motive and the wrong objective now on the spiritual side of that's kind of the natural thing and and now we're all feeling a little bit bad right because we're thinking about being selfish but on the spiritual side you know just just to thinking about this um this is kind of pulled from a couple of different sermons brother Brandon preaches perfect strength by perfect perfect weakness and the greatest battle ever fought you know relying on your own strength relying on your own now we're talking spiritually relying on your own strength your own intellect your own achievements rather than surrendering to God you are a selfish disciple you say God I got this I'm going to handle this not even realizing you are displaying the attributes of the flesh under the cloak of spiritualism you are displaying the the the the the characteristics of of what you want rather than what God wants God doesn't want let me put it like this God doesn't want what you have to offer if you what you have to offer is other than yourself he wants you to lay yourself at the altar he wants to surrender your body he doesn't want your abilities he doesn't he doesn't want what you have he doesn't want he doesn't want what you think you can do he wants you you see we we can do things we all have talents right and we talk about talents oh use your talent for God use your talent for God and if we're not careful we use our talent for God but we won't give him ourself and when you do that you got the cart before the horse and you might sound good you might you know people might enjoy it you might you might you might be a good speaker people might people might enjoy it but it did you give God yourself the the three men in the scriptures one was given five talents one was given two talents one was given one Talent they all knew knew the heart of the master they all knew the heart of the man the king because the one had one Talent said I knew that you you you you reap where you didn't plant and he says well you should have just put it in the bank so I could gain in interest on it so but instead he buried it but the the five and the two all he did was give them the talents and they surrendered themselves to his will by going out and saying he would want us he would want us to do to to double this he would want us to to invest this to use this for something good so they they Sur rendered themselves maybe they wanted to take the five talents and go spend it on something but because they were given five God knew their heart so because he knew their heart he knew in in their heart was the right desire and so they took those talents and they surrendered them to the market they surrendered them to the to to to well to the market and in doing so they took a risk they took a calculated risk that this is going to return this is going to return on my investment because they they knew that the master would want them to give the talents up give it up and they did they said we spent the five and we got five more in return I spent the two and I got two more in return they took a risk giving it away right they took a risk they didn't go and use it for themselves everything they did with the Talent was for the master except for the guy who had W he acted selfishly cuz he said you he pointed his finger at the man who gave him the talent and said you you know you reap or you didn't plant so in his fear in his selfishness he just buried it instead of going out and doing something with what God had given him selfishness spiritually presents a barrier to spiritual growth because it pre prevents full dependence on God's power and it it limits our ability selfishness limits our ability to serve others selflessly you say we we want to do more for the kingdom of God we want to we want to we want to I think I hope we all have that desire to do more for God and the the first the best thing you can do for God is surrender yourself because as soon as you do suddenly doors open you you you can't make something happen you can't make it happen in the kingdom of God we're we're not a we're not a denomination it won't work if you're a child of God it won't work remember remember that that thing from um that that brother I always forget his name but brother Sergey has it over his mantle but it's the it's this it's this thing it's the um what's it called brother sery a higher calling right it's the desire say I want to go make something of myself I want to go have success I want to go I I I but as it says in the quote God won't let you so I do not believe me and my wife we're talking about this you can be poor financially you can be poor and have the same attitude the Rich Young Ruler had because his Focus was the money I need the money you can be poor and always think I need more money I need more money if I had more money if I had more money I don't believe God's children whether poor or Rich should be in that condition I think believers who are in a poor position because God put them there to hold to hold a testimony they're going to have the they're going to take care of themselves they're going to take care of what they own they're going to have the attitude of a good Steward and they're going to give off the impression that they're rich they're not going to closeth themselves in garments of the poor and and sackcloth and Ashes remember Jesus talks about the Pharisees who would who would fast and they would change the way change their demeanor and change their clothes so everybody knew they were fasting the only one who needs to know your poor is God himself the only no one who needs to know your rich is God himself now there are certain things that just they attributes and let me say it this way if you live that way God will show what you're capable of to those who need it God will show forth what you can do for the kingdom of God if you will lay those things on his on his altar but we shouldn't go around saying well you know what you know I just you know I'm just you know can't pay my bills and wowy woo and feel bad for yourself and cast off this demeanor that you you know you go down to the I think you understand what I'm saying I hope so because you're scowling at me the world has a secular world I spent some time in my career life a few years in the uh in the um research of of self-help of self self- embedment uh that's the right word and uh the the company I was working for the the the boss the CEO there he he really pushed that and so he had books and all this stuff and and I went through it and I found out it's it's more headache uh than help and um because I realized that as Christians the way we get better is so so let me say this so the world they have this this concept 1% better every day 1% better every day so what's one little step you can make every day to be a better person and and I and I I and I looked at that and after some time God dealing with my heart I realized as a Believer 1% better every day is 1% more surrendered to Christ every morning you get up you say God what is the thing I can surrender to you today every day you have to surrender yourself will for one thing your self will you have to surrender but a Christian who is pursuing surrender every day of their life finds themselves further down the journey finds themselves closer to Christ finds themselves closer to the goals you know as you climb a mountain because we're climbing a mountain it's called a pyramid it's called the statue of a perfect man as you climb the mountain The View gets better and better sometimes there's hikes you know that are climbs that'll start off in the trees my wife and I uh um we we we went up and we were hiking there's a peak and Flagstaff um I think it Peaks out at 12 or 14,000 ft um and so we said hey let's let's do it and um we got up the Tre a little ways and and and while it it Peaks out really high and and for a long time up there it's just rock and and gravel and everything for the first several miles you're in the trees and you can't see anything so you're in your journey as a Christian and you're just like I don't know what's going on you know it's just the same old trees I'm just walking along you know and it's the same old trees and and if we're not careful we get discouraged and we say this is too hard and we keep stopping for a break and we stop for a break and we stop for a break but as you know those of you who hike is when you stop for a break what keeps going time and the longer you spend break taking a break the less light you have for your journey so those who take breaks often but they still have the desire to finish finish in the dark and then did you bring a headlamp nope right so these things happen but so that's the same way the Christian Journey you got to keep on walking brother says you can only go forward or backwards you can't there's no pause and that's because time doesn't stop for anybody time does not stop for anybody so the longer you sit in a on a as a bump on a log along the Christian Journey the longer you sit there the more time goes by and guess what the more complicated things in your life get if you struggle with things in your life and you sit down with instead of continuing on those those struggles get harder and harder to shake it's kind of like when you're tired you know your body hurts your muscles are sore the worst thing you can do if you're doing something strenuous is sit down for too long because your your muscles they say okay it's time to break and they they tense up or they or they just say hey well let's chill and then all of a sudden their legs don't work like they did you know before so in a Christian Journey the same thing happens you sit down for too long your faith gets weak and when your faith gets weak your relationship with God struggles and it's all because we were too self-centered we said I need a break God didn't say you need a break if God says you need a break guess what you'll come to a downhill on the trail in Joshua chapter 10 we're going to read here where I got my title and um Joshua chapter 10 ver14 definitely is not a conventional way to approach this subject but NE nevertheless the point still stands John Joshua 10:14 and there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel and Joshua returned and all Israel with him unto the camp to gilgal but these five Kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at maada and it was told Joshua saying the five kings are found hid in a cave at Ma and Joshua said roll great Stones upon the mouth of the cave and and set Men by it for to keep them and stay you not but pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand now this is the battle as we'll read where Jerusalem was delivered unto the Israelites who was one of these Kings as the king of Jerusalem for God hath delivered them into your hand and it came to pass when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great Slaughter till they were consumed that the the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua and M in peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel then said Joshua open the mouth of the cape and bring out those five Kings unto me out of the cave and they did so and brought forth those five Kings unto him out of the Cave the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of jarmuth the king of Lish and the king of Elon it came to pass when they brought out the those kings unto Joshua that Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said unto the captains of the men of War which went with him come near put your feet upon the necks of these Kings and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them and Joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the Lord do all do to all your enemies against whom you fight and afterward Joshua smote them and slew them and hang them on five trees and they were hanged upon the trees until the evening it came to pass that the the time of the going down of the Sun that Joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in the Cave's mouth which remain until this very day now interesting part here about these Kings these Kings and and and we have you we have heard this if we've been in any any number of meetings or any number of services in our life we've heard this subject brought up about putting our foot on the neck of the enemy and that enemy can be cancer the enemy can be all these different things and brother bam lists the greatest enemy he he talks about the greatest enemy of the Gospel is is doubt he says the greatest enemy excuse me he says the greatest enemy of faith is doubt and he says he says uh he also gives a definition of the greatest enemy of the Gospel but he said when it comes to the greatest enemy of ourselves it is ourselves for the Christian the greatest enemy of the Christian is ourselves so now we have the children of Israel who are on I'll try to slow down here on the other side of the River Jordan fighting for their rights of the promised land they are under the leadership of Joshua who is a type of the Holy Spirit now as the children of Israel were fighting they fought Jericho great battles they they had the situation with aan and they saw how God deals with with trouble in the church and and uh they went on to fight more and more battles and in this story brother Bram talks about this and he says it's the only time God ever paid attention and listened to a man and that was when Joshua said Sun and Moon MO stand still I've heard it said I don't know if it's true that there's a day or two missing and that in in the in the in the calculation of time but nevertheless that's for a different time so they have this great battle now we all understand leadership to a point uh as men with with families we understand leadership from another perspective than perhaps a young man who is a son and he's living at home men especially understand leadership because we are called to be leaders once you're born you grow up if you have a good father he will teach you how to be a leader because you are a man and that is a characteristic that you should hold so we have five Kings now these five Kings decided hey we're going to attack Joshua and the reason that they attacked is because they found out that the gibian made a uh pact with Israel and through the through a you know the Shady business deal and the the five Kings said hey let's go and take gibian because they turned their back on the rest of us and uh because uh G Israel gave made a pact with gibian Israel said we're going to go defend gibian gibian also called for the help and they said hey we'll come because we gave you our promise and so they have this great battle and now these five Kings they you know we've heard them labeled in it labeled different things and those are all good there scripture has compound meaning but there's there's there's a part there's a enemy in this story that is hidden it's not it's not mentioned in name it's mentioned in deed and we read in James basically that you know by your fruits you are known he says if you hear and you do you're child of God James is basically preaching the same sermon Jesus preached in the book in the gospels talking about those that hear my word and do them they are part of me and James says you know it's important that I know I'm going to jump back so I don't misquote it here he says if any if hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in the glass and when he behold himself and goeth away he forgets what he looks like so here in this scripture we see another enemy that is hidden hidden and it is it is the the enemy of self centeredness here here you have five Kings they made a pack together they said hey we're going to attack now they they are they are they the final leadership for their Kingdom you know leadership goes up in stages right if it's in a family you know there's a situation the the the the children you know they look to Mom mom looks to Dad dad looks to God right there just this and to the then the pastor then they got the deacons to the pastor so on and so forth so leadership moves up until it ends with god well leadership that moved up in each of these kingdoms there was captains there was generals there was all of these things but where it ended was with the Kings he they are the ultimate leader so in other words they are the ones who much must pay the biggest sacrifice for their decisions but instead of instead of laying hold of the decision that they took and the defeat that they were experiencing all five of them left their army left their duties and tried to save themselves and doing so were completely cornered long before Israel defeated the rest of the army armies they knew where these five Kings were hiding so they abandoned their post of Duty and in a in an act of selfishness they ran to the caves and hid themselves now we're not here to preach about the Kings because those kings are those kings and they answered for their sins and they're not part of the part of the plan of God as far as living on the other side but me and you are and the children of Israel were God's people so Joshua calls them and says put your foot foot on their on their necks and this is what you'll do to all of your enemies against whom you fight all your enemies against whom you fight little did they know that the number one enemy in their this new promised land was they themselves Joshua gives each of them they fight they finish fighting Joshua gives each of them their portion he assigns to them some of them had some more fighting to do Joshua goes on to glory and we have the Book of Judges and now these are the children of Israel and how does the Book of Judges open Daniel excuse me Daniel Dan commits idolatry the greatest enemy in the Book of Judges was not those infidels who surrounded them it was themselves through the Book of Judges you will watch the children of Israel simultaneously commit self-destruction yet they were given a promise by Joshua put your foot on the neck of the enemy and I fear that we in the church will only look to those outside enemies and say I put my foot on the neck of cancer I put my foot on the neck of pornography I put my foot on the neck of of lust I put my foot on the neck of whatever it might be bad books or bad movies I I put my foot on the neck of the enemy but the reason you do those things is because yourself has not been conquered it is it is an attribute of a self centered life sin in your life is an attribute of a self centered life you say how can you make such a statement because if it wasn't you would be surrendered to God he says brother B says the number one thing you have to surrender is your self-will that's it he says God can't do anything with you until you surrender your self will God in his grace and his Mercy has ministers and has the Bible and all these things to encourage you and direct you and give you feedback and give you Direction but you will make no Headway in your life until you surrender yourself so sin though you say oh you be crestf fallen when you make a mistake and you look down on yourself and you say oh I'm such a terrible person instead say God let me surrender this to you Lord what about myself is what what about me is so selfish how what am I holding on to sometimes sin is an attribute of a hurt in your life you did not forgive they've scientifically proven that a problem and we're in a mixed audience i w go to details problem that young men can have can be directly related to the displeasure of their father directly related to an emotional instability so they find stability in other things again we're mixed mixed audience they find stability in these other things and it's simply a byproduct of emotional damage so now because of that emotional damage they don't give that to God you see that's why we need more teaching in the house of God we more teaching for for young men and young women around these things cuz many times it's not that you need a preacher to lay hands on you and say say you know be delivered it's that you need to recognize actually this is not the problem this is the problem over here brother Brandon when they would come to him in the line he would discern them and says he wouldn't just say oh you have an ulcer let's pray God delivers you from an ulcer he would says oh you have an ulcer cuz you're really stressed and you're really stressed because there was a dog that chased you when you were younger and you it put a fear in you now what did he do he exposed the real demon he SPO the ulcer was just the byproduct of the real issue many times cancer is just the byproduct of the real issue because it's a bruised Spirit brother mam says but if we're not careful when we try to we try to release the pressure that we feel through the things of the world that's being selfish because the things of the world give us pleasure but the things of God give him pleasure that is selfs surrendered when you had the desire to give and make the other guy have the better deal you are fulfilling the scripture that says no greater love hath any man than this that a man would lay down his life for his friend that is not just in battle saying I'll jump in front of the bullet and you hope your heroics made it to the cinema that is not what it's about laying your life down for your brother brother is saying I'll take the blame even though it wasn't me I won't correct them because it would damage the reputation I'm not saying you go out and say it was me it was my fault and lie I'm saying if blame is indirectly put upon you don't defend yourself put it in God's hands God will deal with it lest you damage brother B many many times in in in his opening statements his the preliminary of a sermon many times and just talking he would say oh this but I would have damaged that brother's reputation and the man didn't even agree with him didn't even didn't even agree in the godhead didn't even agree in water baptism yeah brother bham didn't shame him and correct him slow to wrath quick to hear slow to speak slow to wrath these the attributes you know I've been think thinking a long time about things in well about people I think a lot about people and about myself because I realize I'm preaching at myself tonight Saints I need to hear this I need to hear this because if I want to be any effect I can't do anything he has to do everything but you have to remember that good men can speak and not act we do not judge a man's ability or his character or his beliefs or his Revelation on what he can say we judge all of that based on the fruits of his life somebody can be very anointed but the fruits don't point to Christ that's where we judge if my peach tree had Peach has by all appearances I have can we you guys know we have Peach Tree got the leaves of a peach tree it's got the the shape of a peach tree it's got the bark of a peach tree if you cut it you know it's got the smell of a peach tree now what if it put out plums boy we'd all be really confused what would we say oh we were mistaken that's a plum tree so what happened a Believer a member of the message Community says he believes says right and then it comes down to the harvest season and instead of God fruit it's devil fruit we're going to say oh it's a devil tree we were mistaken we are not going to say oh yes this tree brings for devil fruit even though it's God tree always judge by by the fruits now what did I say earlier don't cast this sermon to someone else we're going to bring it right back to ourselves we say we believe we come to church but can I look at my life and see the fruits of the Gospel can I see my look at my life and see the fruits of the spirit that's probably the least preached on scripture in the Bible in my personal perspective of of of things you hardly ever hear the fruits of the spirit preached on we'd much rather hear about the Seven Seals they much rather hear about the the be behind the veil we much rather hear about you know the the the Tabernacle in the wilderness we much rather hear about these things yet we cannot be with Christ unless we are like Christ so James puts it this I can't read write the Bible pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world James defines pure religion in this way how do we Define pure religion we say pure religion is a belief that God sent a prophet and we adhere to a message Community culture and a code and we say you're it you got it cuz you act like the rest of us and we say hey I got it CU I act like you then we've just adapted to some moral code guess what Germany did that on the the regime of Hitler and they murdered innocent people so what's truth what is truth everybody sister R everybody has to adhere to her moral code everybody has to adhere to her moral code everybody picks something to follow everybody picks unless you misunderstand she had a question on Sunday sun in Sunday school everybody has has something that they're going to live by they're going to pick and and and and they're going to be a lot of it has to do with how they're raised you know if they're raised to be Christians and they go to college they're going to going to be atheists if they raised to be atheists and they go to college they going to be Christians because when kids hit that age they want to do the opposite of what their parents did because yuck that's stale look at them they're old it's the desire of the Next Generation to to put new life and and that's a god-given desire channeled in the right direction that's what brings positive change in the church and and everywhere else in our communities but it has to be direct directed by God so everybody has something that they're going to follow so what do we follow what do we do well I choose to follow the word because I think the word brings the best fruits that's actually all it comes down to it all comes down to that so James says Hey bear the fruits so if you bear the fruits you say you're a peach tree come Harvest we're expecting peaches come Harvest God is expecting wheat amen trying to do God of service without it without 1965 he preaches this sermon title is too long he says that's the way God sees you it ain't what you see your own self it's the way God sees you you know there's that scripture in Proverbs I think it's Proverbs see the Proverbs or Psalms where it says every man is right in his own eyes that scripture has been bringing through my my head probably every day the past few weeks I'll think of something I'll think of of a situation and I'll and I'll judge it a certain way and then I remind it again you think you're right because it's your opinion you think you're right because you are talking to yourself you are agreeing with yourself the world calls that an echo chamber because all you are is surrounded by people who agree with you brother B said today in in the the tape I was listening to he says you need to be surrounded by people that challenge you that challenge what you believe he says you need people to disagree with you you need it lest you he says lest you become stale so it ain't what you see your own self it's the way God sees you so it therefore it is imper ative that we look ourselves into the mirror of God's word he says no man sees himself wrong when you look in the mirror of God's word it tells you whether you're wrong or not you see back to the word look to the word of God say the fruits I see are they of the word and if they are praise God the fruits you see if they're not of the word you need to kill that tree and don't use this water down stuff that's all natural from you know Walmart go to the farm grade Roundup and poison that thing so it shrivels up and dies he says oh we just you know we'll throw a little watered down religion on this issue you know we we won't really we won't really we don't want to get too harsh you know we don't we don't want to get too pointed in our in our statements we don't get too pointed in what we preach we don't want to get too pointed in in our worship song so we'll keep it vague we you just water it down and and there's still some poison in there to kill the devil but but but not enough not enough when the rain comes down it washes away you know what happens when you spray round up and it rains it kills everything else it doesn't wash away the real power of God is in our lives to destroy what is not of God because where God is there is light and darkness can't exist as simple as that it isn't that there's some magic behind it it's just simply that the more of God the less of the devil to put it in denominational terms the the more of God the less of you more when you look in the mirror of God's word it tells you whether you're wrong or not had this conversation with my my daughter the other day I said sweetheart you're like your dad and I'm sorry I said you have to learn to be more honest with yourself about yourself because I have a tendency to say well and talk myself out of something that I did well you know I just this that and the other it's like no this is why you did it be more honest be more honest and it's the same thing look in the mirror of God word of God's word be more honest hon with yourself say don't become legalistic don't become legalistic don't become a Pharisee you have Grace you have the blood of Jesus Christ to cover those things you don't even know you did wrong but there's always room to grow there's always room to grow but don't be legalistic things that are to be he says now they say oh I've done this I've shouted the spirit I've spoken tongues but look there is something lacking in my life I look in the mirror of God's word I know there's something I go to church but I'm not what I should be see that shows that something now if you can look at yourself and see that you're not lined up with God's word and there's nothing in there that'll cause you to raise your hand then you know there's something wrong he's making an alter call so he's saying you act like a Christian you act like the message in church but then you look in the mirror of God's word and there's something lacking he says now that shows that something but you recognize it the key is here the difference between the two is one sees himself in the mirror of God's word recognizes the error and says God help me the other looks at themselves not lined up with the word of God and there's nothing in their hearts that'll cause them to go to repentance sometimes a true child of God can be so wound up in Pride that that's what holds him back sometimes they're just not children of God but I believe I'm speaking to the children of God so don't let Pride hold you back when you see you're in error don't don't don't take it don't take it as correction from a man say is it God is it God is God directing me to you know there's so much in our lives that that you know there there's so many blessings that God have in store for us know God's been dealing with my heart saying Chris I've got so much more for you if you'll just give me more time should I then should I then say well you know that's just Brother David or that's just brother Paul if the man is behind the pulpit and you're sitting in the congregation then that means you agree with the ministry if you don't you shouldn't be here find a different church but if you agree with the ministry then you agree to say that God is speaking through that man then if God is speaking to that man don't pick and choose take what he says back to the word of God with an unbiased perspective when a brother get up here you think he's being too harsh take what he says back to the word of God Is it true if it's not true then I know that myself Brother David brother Paul we would want you to come and say you said this and I can't find it in the Bible can you please help me by by all means please do I love I love talking about the word of God anyways but you see then there there in lies now back to leadership there in lies the the the the the sacred responsibility we have as leaders in our home in our church in our in in in in our business we have to cultivate a approachable character getting up and telling you give me feedback please give me feedback tell me when I'm wrong oh I'd love to hear it but then your fruits are not the fruits of a person who is approachable you can kiss whatever you say goodbye somebody can ask you and tell you that that they'll take your feedback they long their if their characteristics are a man of of like nope it's got to be this way or or the highway nobody's going to tell that man you're wrong it's going to take a special anointed man especially in the church a special anointed man who is Led of God given the strength and courage of God to go and talk to them feedback is not is not requested feedback feedback feedback shouldn't be requested shouldn't have to be requested feedback should just generate from the atmosphere that you create as a leader in your home especially in your home especially in your home Lord I I pray all the time God help me to be more approachable because I remember growing up and different times in my life you know different situations you just he go through things that brother Ben mccaffery most of you know know who he is you know he said the best thing I ever heard and never forgot it he says he says don't worry about it he says no matter what you do when your kids become adults they'll need therapy because of you and it's true because you have an imperfect human raising an imperfect human and for a large portion of their life as you were raising them they are completely unconverted and they're heathens cuz they don't have God yet you apply the token to your home and you have an atmosphere in your home that that draws th those those those responses from them you'll see the response and then that response to to the moral code of the word of God will lead them to Christ himself then they have a new birth so they'll they they'll act like God because you're they're in your home if you are creating that kind of atmosphere they'll act according to the word of God because you're training them up that's the Bible says train a child in the way they should go and they will not depart from it that is not commanding them how to live like God that's showing them how to live like God and creating an atmosphere in your home that promotes Godly behavior and then they as they live in that atmosphere for a while they'll begin to see there's a difference between home and the world there's a difference between home and church and the world and they begin to ask themselves do I want that and if it's the right atmosphere and it's the right guiding and leading along they'll receive it that is training a child in the way they should go go it is creating an atmosphere that promotes Godly Behavior so we as Leaders we must create that atmosphere where our children can come to us and say I'm having a hard time with this and and even even you can do the best that you can and you can create a positive atmosphere and there are just certain things that kids deal with that are just very hard to speak they're just just takes great courage on part of a child to speak you know kids are born in the world you know shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies you know your your kid is your kid is is until converted is unconverted simple as that and we think we have to remember that we have to remember that we're dealing with them but you're dealing with them you know sometimes you say Hey you know you told the truth all right thank you right this is where I with thank you for telling me the truth now you're in trouble but there's a balance sometimes kids need to be encouraged say thank you for telling me the truth the sacrifice you made to tell me the truth was a punishment enough to correct the error talking about when somebody lies then they make it right so there's all these things that we have to deal with you know I think all of us know who Dale Carnegie is he was an American writer from lived from 1888 to 1955 and he was one of the the Pioneers for self selfimprovement and and and and you know public speaking and he wrote the famous book How to Win Friends and Influence People and um he just he's a classic when it comes to personal development and he he had this folder he kept that he Acron as DFT and um basically it was a collection of his blunders and mistreatments of others so he maybe having a conversation maybe got upset with somebody and you know spoke down to them he would write that down and put it in this folder and every once in a while he would bring the folder out and he would so this is direct quote he says reread the criticisms I have written of myself they do more to help and direct me than anything Solomon could have written this is a this is a man I don't don't believe was converted I don't know you know back in them days things were different but he says they help me to deal with the biggest problem I shall ever face the management of Dale Carnegie and that just struck me I I just happened to read this this blog post and talking about this this man reflecting on on these mistakes and I thought how powerful a man who who who who perhaps did not even have a relationship with God didn't I don't his life didn't seem to reflect that but wasn't a Christian he's just a man of self-improvement he laid hold of the the the the the the biggest principle and the thing we struggle with the most the management of ourselves he says that is the biggest problem I shall ever face that is the biggest problem you and I will ever face is the management of Chris take the management of Trevor Cox the management of VI I'm trying to use the feminine version gas right that the management of ourselves that's the biggest problem we'll ever have to face yet we treat problems in others like the world's ending we got to fix them but here's what happens let's say in the church there a situation and it doesn't line up with the word of God whatever is happening and you say I have the scripture right here to show and I'm closing soon the scripture right here to show that they're wrong I better get the pastor we better go to them or I better go to them personally cuz that's also in the scripture right says go to your brother okay so by all means of the scripture you are in the correct position but your objective is is right what's your motive motive is is the the vehicle that gets you to the objective if your objective is to to get to Denver Colorado the motive is the airplane it's a simple way of describing so the motive well you the objective is is to say Hey you know we want we want peace in the house of God we want things in order in the house of God it's all true it's all bible-based but what is your motive are you going because they're wrong and I need to correct them here's the thing many times that's the case unfortunately so what we should do is take it lay ourselves before God for the bandom there's a quote where brother brandham see if I can pull it up really quickly he talks about being neutral he's talking about going to prayer I don't I don't have it here uh Gideon he talks about going to prayer and I have this this little reference document that called quotes for later you should all start one or just keep a running list of of quotes for quotes for later and uh so he he's talking about uh getting he he's talking about getting neutral and um see if I can get it right here and this is in questions and answers 1961 well that's just fantastic I was reading from that today he says he's a question he says how do you feel it's a long quote you just bear with me because I think it's important tonight how do you feel is the best way to find how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord's will in some important matters now we're talking about this as an example right now of important situation in the church for example that needs to be dealt with and everything around it is scriptural even even you going to them is scriptural but now watch what he says he says you still need to find the will of the Lord because God's word is his will but he says God's Will has a time and a season he says now I don't believe let me see if I can get the continuity to it so he says how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord's will in some important matters I tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of God in some important matters is prayer here's a wonderful little thing here if you have a matter that's very important here's the way I do it I take it before the Lord it's always been my strength I wait upon the Lord and see what he says and I just let myself neutral to it don't take either side say now heavenly father of course now in my my case most of the time if it's very important I wait on a vision we're not the prophet he says but many people God doesn't deal with in Visions so therefore I wouldn't advise you to do that because it's just some people that has visions and some does something else God deals with us differently so I would if I was in your place didn't have visions from before the Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now you show me what's the decision to make so but the point I want to get back as he says I just let myself get neutral to it so here's a situation you know the right way according to scripture to approach it you you you you you by by your perspective it needs to be corrected because wrong should be made right that that is a that is a that is a just desire but so that's a just objective but he says go to prayer and get neutral on it in other words Lord Lord either way I'm fine with and it's not just saying the words Lord either way I'm fine with it right then we're just Catholics repeating a prayer but in your heart you say God I'm you got to pray until you don't pray for the situation you just spend time praying Lord your will is always perfect Lord I I you know you you know the ways you you know you know my struggles father you know my self you know you know where I'm lacking God you know give you the glory Lord lord it's so good to serve you right you're praying until that atmosphere comes down and now you're just standing with God and you don't care either way you don't care which direction it goes now he says now you can pray for the leadership of the Lord because otherwise we'll go to prayer with a decision already made in our head and as we pray we'll say oh God spoke to me been there and done that I can't stand it it's it's a it's a shame was embarrassing for myself you know just look and say what was I thinking CU I didn't get neutral first he didn't get neutral first in closing here the definition of eternal life is living for others that day on Calvary 1960 first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly ET etal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life that about dismantles every single one of us my wife and I we we some years ago we received we received um like information or or just blog Post article something from online an influencer basically about this concept of you can't pour from an empty cup basically the idea was you know we're called to they were a Christian so-called at the PO at the at the time the the the point was that they were making was how can you pour your pour yourself out for other people if you have nothing to pour from so my wife and I we thought hey that sounds pretty good and in following that practice this is why you have to be so careful with social media and fluences online because there's a lot of things that sound good but they're not they don't they're not founded on the word of God and we started to to say well we're too tired to do that we we don't have enough money to do that we don't have you know we don't want to go there because of this and we don't have you know we're just working and we're trying to take care of the family so we're going to just stay home and and sleep we're going to we're not going to go over there we're not going to do that we're not going to do this cuz we don't we don't want to pour from an empty cup and what happened is we became selfish we became selfish we lost some friends because you know if you don't invest in if you don't invest into your friendships you won't have friends people say oh I just have no friends and I people just don't like me if you always want your way when you're around those people people don't want to deal with that so you have to go you have to you have to give of yourself I'm not talking about compromising on the word of God don't go there but just be a friend those who have friends show themselves friendly and so this idea and then and then I I came across this I came across this and I thought we missed it he says he says when you live your life for yourself you haven't eternal life he doesn't say when you feel good when when you have a full cup when you have enough money in the bank when you have enough food on your shelf he says no he says eternal life is living for other people the reason Society is so depressed is because everybody lives for themselves there are some who have some some coaches who you know personal therapist coaches that have picked up picked up on the concept of giving and how giving actually incre so so there's some of that out there but for the most part everybody's saying hey you feel terrible it's CU you need to do more for yourself and so all that does is compound the problem he says eternal life is living for other people so next time you're faced with a decision coming to church I I say this a bit tongue and- cheek because I've said some other things in this sermon that might seem to contradict it so take it for what it's worth but coming to church sometimes if if the only thing that can get you here I I hope this is not the case but if the only thing can that can get you here is to say I want to be there to show my brother I'm with him then let it be that coming to church should not just be about yourself what can the preacher tell me what what what your presence alone your your your prayed up position is a help to the house of God sometimes coming to church can be for those around you now I would hope hope that you come to church because there's something in your heart that says I got to be there right that's what we want now I read the first scripture because all of this comes into this context when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child so your understanding changes as you grow I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things and if we constantly in our own lives season the reproach season the correction with a well but sometimes days are hard that's what children do children season flaws in their character with well but she said but he hit me first that's a childish thing to do a man a mature Christian takes the correction and says yes I need to do better and understands the nuances you shouldn't have to constantly season correction when you're talking to an adult you should be able to say this and this okay got it as a child you have to explain the nuances and explain the details of why and all of the behavior because you're training them but when they became a man you say this and they say okay you're right right they change it but if you constantly season it with well the day was hard or well I had to work late or well I had to you know I wasn't feeling well or I just I just didn't have the energy if you're constantly giving yourself excuses you won't change your behavior but as soon as you own up to the discrepancy in your life and you say God this is a problem I can't fix it you will see mountains move suddenly going to church is just what you do bad to say that on a Wednesday night when nobody's here like I said we should be able to talk to each other mono on mono right man to man woman to woman understand we we we we talked about this I said I was closing okay I'm sorry so he says it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself sister you come to the piano he live for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become Sons see Elisha had the ability a type of the Bride had the ability to redeem those children and their families instead he called she Bears out to eat them you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons if I wonder if step did not call to Heaven Lord forgive them for they do not know what they do if Saul would have been judged and condemned but for the sake of Saul step lifted his voice to heaven and forgave them he redeemed that man because he said I live for others he says you become Sons he says and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons so many times we get amnesia and we forget who we are if you knew you were a son of the king you would act like a son of the king if I really knew I was a son of the king I would act like a son of the King Church has forgotten they were Sons you're a son you're taking Christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others brother brandom I can live for this brother cuz he sure is a nice man that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who would kill you if they they could that's what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them the very people who put him on the cross he saved that's eternal life we love to talk about all the other attributes of God let's not leave this one undisclosed [Music] when you that's in your bosom you're facing heaven
