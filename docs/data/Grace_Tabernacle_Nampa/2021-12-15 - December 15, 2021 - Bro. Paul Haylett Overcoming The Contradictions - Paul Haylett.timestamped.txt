[20:43] brothers that have uh if you if you walk
[20:45] downstairs
[20:46] you'll see what has taken place in this
[20:49] last week is a tremendous transformation
[20:53] of um
[20:54] of the basement
[20:55] and uh
[20:56] brother sergey i know you know he just
[21:00] worked until he changed his clothes just
[21:03] a few minutes ago
[21:05] and uh go downstairs the water fountain
[21:07] works and the bathrooms work and
[21:10] the sink and the kitchen's all hooked up

[21:20] and
[21:21] brother isaac was down working on the
[21:23] wiring the other night and i come with
[21:25] him and
[21:27] well maybe it's time for me just to be a
[21:29] pastor and not think that i could
[21:31] actually be much help
[21:34] i found myself standing in its way quite
[21:36] a bit
[21:38] but
[21:39] anyway i'm just very happy to see that
[21:42] and
[21:43] you know um
[21:44] we just want to remember brother bob
[21:46] sister joanne we just want to remember
[21:48] every need
[21:50] uh some of them outside of our assembly
[21:53] amen uh you know sometimes we we have a
[21:56] prayer request for them and if we kind
[21:59] of i don't know about you i'm just being
[22:01] honest sometimes they just slip from our
[22:02] thinking and uh the need is still there
[22:06] and uh so just let's try to be cognizant
[22:09] of of all of those needs around us and
[22:13] may the lord just touch um
[22:16] those in our community
[22:18] this gentleman paul
[22:20] um you know and things like that
[22:23] because
[22:24] i'd be a little bit of what we're going
[22:26] to speak on tonight amen
[22:28] now
[22:29] we are considering not having church on
[22:31] the wednesday between christian
[22:33] christmas and new year's
[22:36] because there's things that we need to
[22:38] tear apart here at the church
[22:41] that if not finished
[22:43] we'll leave the sisters without a door
[22:45] on their bathroom
[22:47] uh we'll leave the brothers with outdoor
[22:48] in their bathroom some things like that
[22:51] so
[22:51] we'll have it finalized this coming
[22:54] sunday as to what will happen there and
[22:58] so
[22:59] anyway let's just stand and go right
[23:00] into the word of god
[23:06] i want to speak to you tonight on uh we
[23:09] are witnesses once again
[23:11] uh and uh
[23:13] overcoming the contradiction
[23:15] and uh it'll be self-explanatory very
[23:18] short scripture tonight
[23:20] uh and uh we'll turn in our bibles to
[23:23] hebrews the 12th chapter
[23:25] uh starting with the first verse
[23:27] and um you know it's uh
[23:30] it's always a joy my brothers and
[23:32] sisters um oh i know the other thing i
[23:34] want to mention
[23:36] those that are not here tonight let's
[23:38] just lift them up in prayer i know
[23:40] sister sue's heart she always wants to
[23:42] be here in the house of god and
[23:44] i'm not sure if anybody heard from
[23:46] brother trevor or sister kerry but you
[23:47] know they're faithful so whatever the
[23:50] circumstance be just
[23:52] just lift them all up in prayer amen
[23:55] now
[23:56] starting here in hebrews 12 1 he says
[23:59] wherefore seeing
[24:01] we also
[24:02] so this term we also my brother and
[24:05] sister is speaking
[24:07] into the fact of what is taking place
[24:10] includes
[24:12] us
[24:13] it's not just something speaking of
[24:15] someone else
[24:16] in a different time and place but
[24:18] speaking to us wherefore seeing we also
[24:22] are compassed about with so great a
[24:24] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[24:28] every weight and the sin which doth so
[24:31] easily beset us
[24:33] and that's not something we normally say
[24:35] amen to saints but the truth of it is we
[24:38] have to admit there are certain little
[24:40] things
[24:42] that beset us certain little things you
[24:44] know the phrase that is often used well
[24:47] they know how to push their button
[24:49] well the devil knows how to push
[24:52] your button
[24:54] but
[24:55] that's not the end of the story
[24:58] the sin which doth so easily beset us
[25:01] and let us run with patience the race
[25:04] that is set before us
[25:05] looking unto jesus the author and
[25:08] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[25:10] that was set before him
[25:12] endured the cross now tell me what joy
[25:14] could he have had
[25:18] that's exactly right brother david
[25:20] he said what i'm doing right now
[25:24] will seal the way into eternal life
[25:28] for my people
[25:30] boy i had to bring joy to the heart of
[25:32] our lord even while he's enduring
[25:35] even while he's suffering
[25:37] my brother and sister just because he
[25:39] was god in flesh didn't mean that that
[25:41] pain was not there
[25:43] it did not mean that that literal
[25:46] suffering was not there this is not
[25:48] figurative
[25:52] endured the cross despising the shame
[25:54] and set down on the right hand of the
[25:56] throne of god
[25:57] for consider him that endured such
[26:00] contradiction of sinners against himself
[26:04] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[26:07] minds
[26:08] heavenly father we ask you lord jesus
[26:10] just come
[26:12] bless our time in the word tonight
[26:13] father i pray lord just as it encouraged
[26:16] my heart to study this
[26:18] father i pray tonight it would encourage
[26:21] the hearts of your saints
[26:23] father once again we lift you up ask
[26:26] father lord you just receive our praise
[26:29] lord receive our worship our adoration
[26:32] father to to just lord
[26:35] stand in your presence to base in your
[26:38] word father what a privilege you've
[26:40] given to us we ask this tonight in the
[26:43] name of jesus christ amen
[26:45] you may be seated
[26:49] now for the third time over my memory
[26:51] kicks in let's remember sister kristen
[26:53] with her broken foot
[26:54] uh that it would heal quickly for her
[26:58] amen
[26:59] now as we look at this tonight saint
[27:01] time i want you to see wherefore seeing
[27:04] we also are compassed about what's so
[27:06] great a cloud of witnesses and you know
[27:08] when you study these words out you
[27:10] realize it's telling us that uh
[27:12] compassed is the same as uh surrounded
[27:16] and you know here we are surrounded by a
[27:18] great cloud of witnesses and you know
[27:21] it's easy for us to look back into the
[27:23] ages gone by here we are in the book of
[27:25] hebrews and and you know we can take
[27:27] that and by faith and by faith and by
[27:30] faith and we look at that and heroes of
[27:32] the gospel heroes of faith we look at
[27:35] that and we say boy look at look at them
[27:37] look at this great cloud of witnesses
[27:39] that is surrounding us uh in the ages
[27:42] gone by those that in the lions uh you
[27:45] know uh
[27:46] dan
[27:47] those of you in the coliseums and look
[27:49] at this but my brother and sister we
[27:52] don't really look or really shouldn't
[27:54] focus now this might sound a little
[27:57] counterintuitive but we don't look back
[28:00] in time as it were to say look what they
[28:02] suffered look what they suffered but
[28:04] what we should do is be looking at that
[28:06] the spirit of god was upon them now my
[28:10] brother and sister you cannot be
[28:11] anointed by the spirit of god
[28:15] and truly be suffering
[28:18] sounds counterintuitive don't it
[28:20] because you see god everything he lays
[28:22] upon us just as it was with job he said
[28:25] you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna lay
[28:27] this upon a son or i'm gonna lay it upon
[28:29] a daughter of god and allow this to
[28:30] happen and god's saying i know that no
[28:33] matter what this is uh they have already
[28:36] overcome this because i am the overcomer
[28:39] and so as it was the plan of god i don't
[28:41] know if any of you took the time to to
[28:44] listen to brother timothy's uh sermon
[28:46] down in phoenix uh but i would encourage
[28:49] you to because he is just laying out a
[28:51] very beautiful plan or pattern that you
[28:54] see god's work god's plan everything is
[28:56] perfect and so there is as it were as
[29:00] suffering as the scripture says in this
[29:02] flesh in this current time but you see
[29:05] that is nothing compared to the joy that
[29:07] is to come and so we would say well look
[29:10] what they suffered but look what they
[29:12] received for reward that would be the
[29:14] greatest thing that we could focus on in
[29:17] looking back in the saints of ages gone
[29:19] by is look at the reward that god has
[29:23] given them the overcomers the victorious
[29:26] amen what stories they shared through
[29:29] the word of god through history of the
[29:31] power of god through the ages and all
[29:34] the demonic powers that come up against
[29:36] them my brother and sister someday you
[29:39] know that i think it's the lafontaine
[29:40] sing that song are you she
[29:43] my brother and sister to me is a very
[29:45] inspiring song because truly the word of
[29:48] god shows us that the age that we're
[29:50] living in is not just accumulation my
[29:53] brother and sister of all the spirits of
[29:55] the ages but it's also a magnification
[29:58] so it's not just adding one and adding
[30:00] one but my brother and sister it's a
[30:02] magnification of the spirits of the ages
[30:06] and you can take that and look as it
[30:08] were in a negative sense and say oh my
[30:11] look at this all of these demons
[30:13] released out of the river euphrates and
[30:15] look at all this happening no wait the
[30:17] magnification my brother and sister is
[30:19] the word in you and i there's the true
[30:22] magnification of the day that we're
[30:24] looking at don't look at the evil of the
[30:27] day because god has already promised
[30:30] that you would overcome the evil of this
[30:32] day he's already said that when this
[30:34] evil would rise up the standard he's not
[30:37] out building fence around you saints
[30:39] he's pouring himself into you
[30:42] amen and as he pours himself into you
[30:45] you have more as it were a resource to
[30:48] stand against the spirit of the day
[30:51] amen so we're not out here looking for a
[30:53] fence or a wall to hide behind but we
[30:56] have the word and that is christ himself
[30:58] to stand upon amen now
[31:02] we look at this and know this for a fact
[31:04] i broke a lot of chains in my life
[31:07] uh but look my brother and sister
[31:08] brother brown preaches on this and he
[31:10] says the chain is only as strong as its
[31:12] weakest link right totally makes sense
[31:15] amen now look at this the plan of god
[31:19] i've got wrote here in emphasis the
[31:21] great plan of god was not made to have
[31:24] the link break in this day
[31:28] so god didn't carry his word through all
[31:29] the ages to come to have a failure of
[31:32] the manifestation of the word in this
[31:36] day
[31:37] oh you say oh man we have troubles in
[31:39] our house and we got uptight about this
[31:41] and i'm upset about that and they did
[31:43] this and this looks like this my brother
[31:45] and sister i want you to realize the
[31:47] devil hates you so bad
[31:49] amen he's just gonna irritate now have
[31:52] you guys ever done that
[31:54] i tell you right now just to make a
[31:56] point i was out in the wind a lot today
[31:58] and you know it's just strange you don't
[32:00] think about it at the time but my neck
[32:02] is
[32:03] chopped or chafed enough and just the
[32:06] moving of this collar is enough for me
[32:08] to just want to
[32:11] and that's what the devil is doing to us
[32:13] he's coming an irritation an irritation
[32:16] now look he would want to come on now
[32:18] look at the cleverness that satan uses
[32:21] and i'll just use brother david i'm
[32:22] trying to break this habit saints
[32:25] but it would be that something i would
[32:28] say to brother david or brother david
[32:29] would say to me that there is a small
[32:32] degree of irritant in that
[32:35] and the devil would come and say
[32:37] brother david's irritating me
[32:41] but do you know the real truth of it is
[32:43] it's a devil that's doing the irritating
[32:46] it's not our brother it's not our sister
[32:49] amen it's the devil who's coming as it
[32:53] would be to bring something to bring an
[32:55] irritation now you tell me my brother
[32:58] and sister if you don't respond to
[33:00] irritations
[33:02] amen
[33:03] hallelujah kids
[33:05] shut up
[33:08] most of you don't have a basement but go
[33:10] in the basement
[33:12] amen look we respond to irritations so
[33:15] look i want you to understand this that
[33:17] satan starting with the simplest to the
[33:21] greatest of things
[33:23] wants to break the link
[33:27] now i want you to think about this if we
[33:29] actually think in the deepest recess of
[33:31] our mind that the link can be broken we
[33:33] actually don't have faith in god's word
[33:37] we have to look at this word and declare
[33:40] to the world and we'll come to that in a
[33:42] minute and declare to ourself that i am
[33:45] not the weakest link and the weakest
[33:47] link he will not be broken because this
[33:51] is god himself
[33:53] amen it's not the preacher it's not this
[33:56] it's not that you know now look brother
[33:58] brown says here and behold i stand at
[34:01] the door and knock
[34:02] now look at this i think it's really
[34:04] really good myself i was inspired by it
[34:06] in the book of revelation the third
[34:08] chapter 20th verse i want to read this
[34:10] one verse many of you will read has read
[34:13] the entire book i wish you to read this
[34:15] third chapter anyhow when you go home
[34:18] tonight but the 20th verse reads this
[34:21] behold i stand at the door and knock and
[34:25] if any man hear my voice and open the
[34:27] door i will come into him
[34:30] come on saints do you see this
[34:32] simplicity
[34:34] amen
[34:35] the simplicity that the devil would try
[34:37] to keep us from if
[34:40] any man
[34:44] amen come on any man not not i'm
[34:47] i'm going to point to you you you and
[34:49] everybody else is out of luck
[34:51] if any man
[34:56] if any man hear my voice can someone say
[34:59] amen
[35:00] you see this is not a casual we bumped
[35:02] into a thing but god already anointing
[35:05] us to hear the voice
[35:08] and if any man hear my voice and open
[35:11] the door
[35:12] oh lord
[35:14] oh lord
[35:15] come on saints it's time for us to push
[35:17] every barrier you say oh
[35:20] brother i'm going to tell on you how was
[35:21] your day oh oh i guess it was pretty
[35:23] good i don't remember what i call my
[35:25] andre he goes are you setting me up
[35:28] no my brother and sister look we're
[35:30] already been set up
[35:32] god's already said i put you in a
[35:34] position and i will maintain you in that
[35:37] position the devil can't knock you off
[35:40] amen so i'll come in and i will sup with
[35:42] him and he with me
[35:44] look
[35:45] that's just a little portion of this
[35:47] great message to the laodicean church
[35:52] so opening
[35:54] are you with me saints
[35:56] just hearing the voice
[35:58] and opening
[36:00] the door
[36:02] the prophet says that's
[36:04] just a little portion
[36:07] but what a life-changing portion
[36:10] what an absolute
[36:12] life-changing
[36:13] portion
[36:16] but you see there's enough there
[36:19] oh see i love this come on my brother
[36:21] and sister
[36:22] this is beautiful
[36:24] but there's enough there if god will
[36:26] just open that up to us then we will
[36:30] have sufficient
[36:32] see just this little portion if we hear
[36:37] and open the door
[36:39] if that is opened to us it will because
[36:42] we as sons and daughters of god it will
[36:45] lead us into everything sufficient but
[36:48] just that revelation that i need to open
[36:51] the door
[36:52] yes sir oh thank you lord that i hear
[36:54] the voice
[36:55] thank you lord that you give function
[36:58] within our bodies within this flesh to
[37:01] sometimes come on saint sometimes the
[37:04] devil has just beat us around we want to
[37:07] keep the door locked we want to find our
[37:09] favorite pillow and we want to find our
[37:12] favorite blanket and we want to find our
[37:14] favorite corner and we want to wrap the
[37:16] blanket around us and lay our head upon
[37:18] that pillow and let the world just pass
[37:21] without us
[37:23] and the devil says huh it works
[37:25] not just on you
[37:27] but humanity
[37:29] but when we catch a revelation what i've
[37:31] got to do a rough day i open the door
[37:33] wider
[37:35] amen the lord said if you'll draw nigh
[37:37] unto me i'll draw nigh unto you and so
[37:39] we open the door wide open and we shout
[37:41] to the heavens lord i'm here
[37:44] and i'm crying out to you amen the song
[37:47] amen tonight lord i'm crying out to you
[37:50] it's my voice lord i'm telling you i'm
[37:52] here
[37:53] and i want to worship you and i want to
[37:55] serve you
[37:58] it's his word
[37:59] and there is many times like in the
[38:01] message sometimes we could preach hours
[38:04] amen
[38:06] but sometimes just 10 minutes
[38:11] it depends on what part of the word that
[38:12] god opens to us
[38:16] i tell you what i liked that quote when
[38:18] i read it
[38:20] you notice the 10 minutes didn't come
[38:21] first
[38:24] hallelujah i didn't even hear an amen
[38:27] out of you
[38:29] [Music]
[38:30] folks so look at this depends on what
[38:34] part of the word
[38:38] see sometimes
[38:39] come on saints and i think we're in an
[38:41] hour and i'm not trying to justify
[38:42] anything don't misunderstand me
[38:44] but this is not the hour we're not
[38:47] living in the hour
[38:48] to go on a spiritual diet
[38:51] this is the hour for us to feed
[38:55] on the word of god
[38:57] to be partakers of it to eat the meat
[39:01] amen nothing against you people that
[39:03] like to be really really healthy but i'm
[39:05] telling you eagles don't eat carrots
[39:09] they don't eat broccoli
[39:12] they eat meat and i'm an eagle
[39:16] is there any eagles here tonight
[39:18] hallelujah
[39:19] now look i hope you don't mind just the
[39:21] moment of humor there
[39:23] but look at this it's the little things
[39:25] that we leave undone
[39:27] trying to do the big things
[39:30] see this is where the devil trips us off
[39:32] we think if our church is full if we've
[39:34] done this we've done this we're doing a
[39:36] great thing but let's do great things
[39:38] saints i'm here to call on you for great
[39:41] things but let's make sure we do all of
[39:44] the little things as we move along and
[39:46] remember brotherly love brotherly
[39:48] kindness is one of those amen
[39:52] so the irritations that come
[39:54] amen
[39:56] we have to remember the devil wants us
[39:58] to not
[39:59] feel that
[40:01] kindred spirit to one another
[40:05] well i'll tell you i say amen
[40:10] the chain is only at its best its best
[40:13] at its weakest link remember no matter
[40:15] how great the other links are never hold
[40:17] no more than its weakest link and the
[40:20] church is the same no stronger than its
[40:24] weakest
[40:25] member
[40:28] we can have great faith saints
[40:31] come ministry that can god answers their
[40:33] prayer they lay hands on the sick and
[40:35] whatever but if the sheep are starving
[40:40] you know it's possible my brother and
[40:41] sister i won't go into the whole story
[40:42] but one time we were in south america
[40:45] and a whole thing that come there and
[40:47] young people coming out of these
[40:49] meetings
[40:51] and their pastor he's the one who
[40:52] confessed this to me he said my young
[40:54] people come and i thought there should
[40:56] be something more from these great
[40:58] meetings what was there and finally he
[41:00] asked one of the spiritual young men in
[41:02] his church he said you know what what
[41:04] what what was the dare and he said i
[41:06] don't know it all went over my head
[41:09] so great deep mysteries
[41:11] but the lambs
[41:13] are starving
[41:16] you see we've got to have a balanced
[41:17] diet
[41:18] amen i love deep things of god
[41:21] i love those things that that have been
[41:23] you might say nuggets dug out but you
[41:25] see if our lambs starve
[41:28] now would you all humor me tonight
[41:31] you want to know who you should be
[41:32] praying for
[41:34] just turn around
[41:36] and start looking
[41:38] come on none of you are doing it
[41:40] i want you to literally look i want it
[41:42] to be sealed when you see things it
[41:44] seals it in your
[41:46] mind
[41:48] that's who you should be praying for
[41:52] well i don't need to pray for them
[41:53] they're real strong are they
[41:59] come on i want to get right down to the
[42:01] bitter end of this sometimes the people
[42:02] you think are the strongest are hurting
[42:04] the most
[42:06] so we intend to pray for this brother or
[42:08] tend to pray for this sister but you
[42:10] should be praying for the body because
[42:13] oh let's put it this way
[42:17] let's have a little poll who's the
[42:18] weakest in this church
[42:25] are you talking about midnight or noon
[42:31] talking right after
[42:32] you fought on the way to church
[42:37] right after you've been irritated
[42:41] you see every one of us has something
[42:43] that is our own personal
[42:45] weak link
[42:48] some of you just look at me that way i
[42:50] just don't know what to think
[42:56] well note
[42:59] to the weakest member
[43:01] and i'm not sure who you are
[43:03] but here is a note to you
[43:05] second corinthians the 12th chapter
[43:08] verses 7 through 9.
[43:12] paul speaking of the corinthians now if
[43:13] you go
[43:15] in
[43:16] his
[43:18] uh speaking to the corinthians when you
[43:20] go to this whole thing you're you're
[43:22] going to with a little insight you're
[43:24] going to see
[43:26] in in the previous chapters you're going
[43:27] to see him talking about
[43:29] uh
[43:30] uh fornication lasciviousness and you
[43:33] talking about my brother and sister this
[43:35] wasn't just some great jubilee of a
[43:36] church these are a people that had to be
[43:39] real believers in that midst but there
[43:41] was issues
[43:42] everyone wants to go to the victorious
[43:44] church that always preaches about we're
[43:46] going in the rapture but somewhere along
[43:48] the line we have to deal with our
[43:49] weakest link
[43:51] and he said
[43:52] and now look what paul's saying right
[43:54] here
[43:55] and lest i should be exalted above
[43:58] measure through the abundance of the
[44:00] revelation
[44:02] paul my he's speaking in a very bold
[44:05] terms
[44:06] lest i i have this incredible
[44:08] revelations that god has given me and in
[44:11] all reality it would be justified that i
[44:13] would be lifted up because none of you
[44:15] were given these revelations they were
[44:17] given to me to bring to you and so
[44:20] therefore i could in a sense be
[44:22] justified to be lifted up as the one
[44:24] that god chose to bring the word to you
[44:27] in this fashion but
[44:29] i love the word but
[44:31] unless i should be exalted and measured
[44:33] through the abundance of the revelation
[44:35] there was given to me
[44:37] a weak link
[44:40] amen
[44:41] a thorn
[44:43] in my flesh in the flesh
[44:46] the messenger of satan
[44:49] to buffet me
[44:53] we've heard all kinds of the reasons of
[44:54] what this thorn is my brother and sister
[44:57] and whether satan would use an
[44:59] affliction actual sickness or something
[45:01] of the body
[45:03] or affliction of the mind or the spirit
[45:06] paul acknowledges or identifies and says
[45:08] this is a messenger of satan
[45:12] whether it be an affliction that would
[45:13] cause you in the body to not be able to
[45:16] function as you would desire or whether
[45:18] it was something that afflicts your
[45:19] spirit or your whatever your mind it's
[45:22] still a messenger of satan it was not
[45:25] from god
[45:26] and so there he's telling you you know
[45:29] this messenger of satan to buff at me
[45:31] last
[45:33] paul's talking about his own human
[45:35] vanity
[45:37] lest i should be exalted above measure
[45:40] for this thing i besought the lord
[45:43] thrice
[45:44] that it might depart from me come on
[45:46] saints how many times let's be honest
[45:48] tonight okay where you just open up some
[45:49] of you're looking a little stiff tonight
[45:51] amen look we open up we've prayed about
[45:53] things and we didn't see an answer to it
[45:56] and we prayed about it again we don't
[45:57] see an answer to it we pray about it
[45:59] again we don't see an answer and the
[46:01] messenger of the devil the messenger of
[46:03] satan is there saying god don't care god
[46:05] doesn't hear your prayer this is not
[46:07] this is all nonsense and that messenger
[46:10] is there to continually prick you and
[46:12] put a thorn into your flesh to keep you
[46:15] from finding complete victory in this
[46:18] because you see we can have victory
[46:19] whether the prayers answered the way we
[46:21] thought it should be
[46:23] or not
[46:25] we don't find victory just because god
[46:27] gives us what we want
[46:29] we find victory because the word the
[46:32] voice that we read earlier the voice has
[46:34] been given to us that we can hear it
[46:38] and the revelations of god that come my
[46:41] brother and sister now i'll try to
[46:43] remember to touch on this but those
[46:45] revelations that come to us my brother
[46:47] and sister these are no small
[46:49] revelations you say well i hear the
[46:51] message and as i hear the preaching of
[46:53] the word and as i i grow in in spiritual
[46:56] maturity and physical maturity and these
[46:59] things i see this my brother and sister
[47:01] do you realize that places you as a
[47:04] minority amongst the minority on the
[47:07] face of the earth you are not just one
[47:09] other person hearing this we walk in our
[47:11] circles we call the message my brother
[47:13] and sister and we look around us and
[47:15] there's lots of people but put that
[47:17] number the scripture says against the
[47:19] whole world and it will be nothing
[47:24] you compare what god's done for you
[47:27] he's given you
[47:29] a measure
[47:30] amongst measures my brother and sister
[47:33] but now look at this note to the weakest
[47:35] member
[47:36] for this thing i besought the lord
[47:38] thrice that it might depart from me
[47:41] lord
[47:43] lord
[47:44] lord
[47:46] and
[47:47] somebody read it with me
[47:50] he
[47:51] said unto
[47:53] come on read it
[47:55] i want you to have the emphasis
[47:57] me
[47:59] don't say oh he was talking to him no
[48:02] read the word put yourself into the word
[48:05] and he said unto me
[48:07] my grace is sufficient
[48:10] for thee
[48:12] hallelujah speaking to you and i today
[48:15] this is a living word amen not a day
[48:18] gone by my brother and sister but an
[48:20] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[48:22] and ever-present help in this age and he
[48:26] said my grace is sufficient for thee
[48:29] for my strength is made perfect
[48:32] in a very strong bride
[48:36] or
[48:38] maybe
[48:40] to put it in the context of the spirit
[48:41] of the age
[48:43] a headstrong
[48:45] bride
[48:47] have you ever noticed that
[48:51] sometimes things are preached on it
[48:54] there is a absolute immediate
[48:58] immediate backlash from that
[49:04] i remember a brother
[49:06] might even been in this church preached
[49:07] on the dominating female spirit
[49:11] blew the roof off our church
[49:13] knocked the windows out
[49:15] caused people to slam doors and stomp
[49:17] feet
[49:22] i hope that wasn't you
[49:25] that you see what it is
[49:27] when those spirits are called out
[49:30] they don't like it
[49:33] but look this might sound pointed and
[49:35] i'm sorry if it does but it's the truth
[49:37] and i've got to preach it
[49:38] now if i had come along and said
[49:41] you have dominating feel or you or you
[49:45] or you
[49:46] but you see that dominating female
[49:48] spirit doesn't know gender
[49:55] but that spirit don't like it because it
[49:57] thinks it's talking to you because you
[49:58] said female
[50:00] but the woman is always represented in
[50:02] the bible as the church
[50:04] so a dominating
[50:07] church spirit
[50:12] how much time do we have tonight
[50:17] he said look
[50:19] my grace is sufficient for thee my
[50:20] strength is made perfect weakness
[50:22] speaking of our weakness most gladly
[50:25] therefore will i rather glory in my
[50:27] infirmity that the power of christ may
[50:30] rest upon me
[50:31] so no emphasis of these great things i
[50:34] prayed we talk about these things you
[50:35] know you're getting a conversation i can
[50:37] recount to you the places we have been
[50:39] the things we have seen people we have
[50:41] prayed for and saw god come on this
[50:43] scene and deliver
[50:45] my brother and sister not just
[50:47] something it might have changed their
[50:48] life we're talking about homosexuals
[50:50] chained we're talking about people that
[50:52] are ready to murder people change we're
[50:55] talking about people committed to all
[50:57] kinds of things and the power of the
[50:58] word changing them
[51:01] hallelujah i've witnessed this can we
[51:03] say amen it's there we see this we're
[51:06] not talking a historical god
[51:10] and yet he's declaring them
[51:12] i had to be humbled down
[51:15] i had to humble myself
[51:18] you see this didn't happen without it
[51:19] isn't amazing
[51:21] when your temper goes away you know it
[51:25] when your stubborn spirit goes away you
[51:27] know it amen
[51:29] and paul's acknowledging
[51:32] i had these revelations no one none of
[51:34] the apostles had this or these others
[51:35] didn't have this god gave it to me
[51:39] and then god had to humble me
[51:42] to keep me from being lifted up
[51:45] above what i should have been
[51:47] amen well i tell you what my brother and
[51:49] sister i've
[51:54] i'll just pass on
[51:56] yes
[51:57] not this thank you lord
[52:00] he says most gladly therefore will i
[52:02] rather glory in my infirmity
[52:05] i'll tell you what saints i can i can
[52:06] just instill this to you
[52:09] i'm not ashamed to tell you
[52:11] i make mistakes
[52:13] i'm not ashamed to tell you i have to
[52:15] repent every single day
[52:18] i'm not ashamed to tell you that the
[52:20] devil does his very best to turn my
[52:23] thoughts to the side
[52:26] but i tell you what
[52:28] when we come to that place that we
[52:30] realize how weak we are and how great
[52:34] our god is then we can come and actually
[52:37] glory in the fact that without christ i
[52:40] would be nothing without him i would be
[52:43] as it were of whatever man in this city
[52:46] but
[52:47] he has come
[52:49] he has anointed us he has poured his
[52:51] spirit out on us and we can stand and
[52:53] some would say you're kind of boasting
[52:55] you know they said well it sounds like
[52:56] you're boasting on jesus
[52:58] christ brother brown's life i am amen
[53:02] i am oh my look at this that the power
[53:05] of christ that's what i want
[53:07] i'll tell you having a a conversation
[53:09] with a brother you know and i was just
[53:12] sharing with him the things i would
[53:13] desire to see happen in our church and
[53:16] amongst the people my brother and sister
[53:17] and i'm not ashamed to declare i want to
[53:19] see us get more sincere i want to see us
[53:22] get more fervent i want to see us more
[53:24] faithful i want to see us more on fire
[53:27] is that too much to ask
[53:30] would that be a wrong desire or should i
[53:32] pray that we all start being able
[53:34] brothers to wear a nice silk suit and
[53:36] our sisters were the finest of fashion
[53:42] you see the connection my brother and
[53:43] sister
[53:45] now i hope that you can follow this
[53:49] you know if what you can preach to
[53:51] yourself could ever be preached over the
[53:53] pulpit
[53:54] um
[53:55] it would be beautiful yes sir
[53:58] but look at this connection
[54:00] the abundance of revelation he's
[54:02] speaking of this abundance of
[54:04] revelations but look at you today my
[54:06] brother and sister the seals have been
[54:08] opened and you understand it now can
[54:10] that understanding the seals and
[54:11] believing it doesn't mean you could go
[54:13] out here and just spill this all out and
[54:16] quote everything and say what pages are
[54:18] that's not what it's about it's
[54:19] registering down in the heart and soul
[54:21] amen and so you have been given this
[54:24] revelation in this hour of the opening
[54:26] you see the church ages you see the
[54:28] spirits moving through it you see the
[54:30] power of god coming along you see all of
[54:32] this you see how that when it comes to
[54:34] this and the vials and and uh the
[54:37] thunders and all of these things my
[54:39] brother and sister we're not here
[54:40] ignorant why because of revelation
[54:43] and so we can actually make the
[54:45] declaration tonight that we have this
[54:47] connection with the apostle paul of the
[54:50] abundance of revelation
[54:52] and it's here in this abundance of
[54:54] revelation we should never get raised up
[54:56] above like i am more spiritual than they
[54:59] are and they are and they are we should
[55:02] be here humble that the presence of
[55:04] almighty god would rest upon us
[55:09] but let's not step away from the fact
[55:12] that we have revelation that has not
[55:14] been given by the word of god vindicated
[55:17] revelation of the word of god that was
[55:20] not given to most of the world
[55:24] the power of god resting on us
[55:28] amen
[55:29] he's declared the power of god's resting
[55:33] on me
[55:34] can you not say today you share that
[55:37] same connection with the apostle paul
[55:40] that the power of god is resting on you
[55:45] oh hallelujah
[55:47] see these are the same positions god's
[55:48] granted to you today
[55:50] now let's look i need to hurry along i
[55:52] don't want to keep you late and i didn't
[55:54] want to say that earlier because i
[55:55] always say that and then i keep you
[55:57] alone
[55:58] and then some people are starting to
[55:59] look at me like i can't tell the truth
[56:02] i can
[56:03] it's just hard
[56:06] back to hebrews 12 verses 2 and 3
[56:09] looking unto jesus the author and finish
[56:11] of our face see we never authored this
[56:14] and we'll never finish it
[56:16] but we will be part of the original word
[56:19] we are a part of the original word and
[56:22] we will be a part of the finished word
[56:26] now you don't find finished word as a
[56:28] phraseology but my brother sister you
[56:30] know what i'm talking about this word's
[56:32] going to deliver a people into a rapture
[56:35] and that's not just a rapture the
[56:36] catching away that's just a little bit
[56:39] of the part of it my brother and sister
[56:41] did you know that the rapture is
[56:43] actually like you going into costco and
[56:45] getting a grocery cart
[56:49] you catch it
[56:51] everyday living
[56:52] something going to carry you from here
[56:55] to there the real goal is not rapture my
[56:58] brother and sister the real goal is the
[57:00] presence of almighty god who is our
[57:03] bridegroom his who is everything we are
[57:06] we are the recipients of all of who he
[57:09] is
[57:10] amen so the rapture is just to move us
[57:13] into his presence just like brother
[57:14] branham talked about death harness death
[57:17] to take us into the presence of almighty
[57:19] god
[57:20] and people then lift the rapture up like
[57:22] oh it's all about the rapture all about
[57:23] the rapture is all about the life
[57:28] yes the eternal life
[57:31] so we look to jesus because he's the
[57:33] author of who we are
[57:35] and the finisher of who we are
[57:37] who for the joy
[57:39] was set before him endured the cross
[57:42] oh
[57:44] how it must
[57:46] bring joy to his heart
[57:49] to see his saints worship him
[57:52] so much they even collected up
[57:56] as a sweet saver before him
[57:58] your prayers
[58:01] holding your prayers in his presence
[58:04] that he can just savor
[58:07] oh
[58:08] i love that because you give example to
[58:10] us that we can understand as it would be
[58:12] to take whatever flower that you would
[58:14] love that fragrance and to be able to
[58:16] smell that
[58:18] and realize that's your prayers
[58:20] coming up before the lord
[58:23] moving him
[58:25] smelling them as it were
[58:28] they're praying again
[58:30] how beautiful
[58:32] they're praying again
[58:34] no he doesn't have to open up his ipad
[58:37] and look and see if you're online
[58:40] he knows it
[58:42] because your prayers
[58:44] are coming by
[58:47] oh
[58:48] how beautiful
[58:51] you know i feel bad to admit this but
[58:54] many many years ago when
[58:56] i was working my way back to serving the
[58:58] lord
[59:00] i um i worked with a gentleman i gave
[59:02] him a ride to work every day we were
[59:04] doing construction work in boise
[59:06] and on the way from his house to my
[59:08] house i drove by an intersection in the
[59:10] city of caldwell that had probably here
[59:13] to the back door
[59:14] rose bushes
[59:17] and at the time i didn't seem to think
[59:19] much was wrong with the idea that i was
[59:21] just helping him
[59:23] prune his
[59:24] bushes and
[59:25] you know jerry started to respond to
[59:28] this like okay paul you're a cheapskate
[59:34] where are you getting all these roses
[59:36] from
[59:37] you know i don't know i mean i remember
[59:39] one time i jumped out and i'm cutting a
[59:41] rose off this guy's bush and it turns
[59:43] out this guy was standing right there
[59:45] and i was just like
[59:46] from my wife
[59:48] he went
[59:50] i thought that was like it's okay
[59:54] i just kept right on doing it the street
[59:56] side of that rose bush was pruned right
[59:58] back to the sidewalk
[1:00:00] hallelujah
[1:00:02] but look my brother and sister you see
[1:00:03] something in me
[1:00:05] my wife
[1:00:07] a little something
[1:00:09] from that
[1:00:10] but then things changed and i didn't go
[1:00:12] by that rose bush anymore and she didn't
[1:00:14] get any more roses
[1:00:16] so
[1:00:17] my motives probably weren't quite what
[1:00:19] they should have been
[1:00:21] but you see
[1:00:22] we look at this word
[1:00:24] now the prophet of god and i i pruned
[1:00:26] this down just to make this statement to
[1:00:28] you you can find it
[1:00:30] brother brown says you know abraham had
[1:00:32] no
[1:00:33] clout of witnesses
[1:00:35] as we have today
[1:00:39] look at the advantage we've got
[1:00:43] how many of you remember the original
[1:00:46] internet
[1:00:52] i'm like what did it just say
[1:00:57] i decided it was like paul's trying to
[1:00:59] get on the computer help him
[1:01:04] but you see moses had nothing to tap
[1:01:06] into
[1:01:08] to go back and see a direct correlation
[1:01:11] but did you know that actually is a
[1:01:12] strength for him and not a weakness
[1:01:15] now i'm going to drive this home in just
[1:01:16] a very personal way and forgive me if it
[1:01:18] offends you
[1:01:19] but we have today
[1:01:21] a a group of people
[1:01:23] it would be their desire for brother
[1:01:24] branham to come back
[1:01:27] and that he would now preach to us to
[1:01:30] finish this work
[1:01:34] i want you to just think about this
[1:01:35] saints
[1:01:36] i'm not mocking
[1:01:39] would you want to be brother branham and
[1:01:41] come back in this day
[1:01:44] he would have to hide in the wilderness
[1:01:46] and then somebody would rent a
[1:01:48] helicopter and try to find him
[1:01:51] and we'd be calling i was going to buy a
[1:01:52] car brother brown what should i i was
[1:01:54] going to do this brother i was going to
[1:01:56] do that what should i do should i buy a
[1:01:58] house it's at the end of time should i
[1:01:59] have a savings account should i invest
[1:02:01] when you said keep planting your
[1:02:03] potatoes did you mean literally we as
[1:02:05] the bride must have potatoes in our
[1:02:06] backyard
[1:02:08] oh you think i'm just being funny
[1:02:11] people have these kind of questions
[1:02:14] now imagine if brother branham was still
[1:02:15] here
[1:02:16] he would be bombarded day and night of
[1:02:20] the silliness of humanity
[1:02:24] but instead what did he do
[1:02:26] he said you know what god's led me to
[1:02:28] store this up for you
[1:02:31] let's go back to our original scripture
[1:02:34] those that hear the voice
[1:02:38] will be able to discern what he was
[1:02:40] talking about
[1:02:44] and it is only that voice my brother and
[1:02:47] sister that will guide us through
[1:02:48] laodicea
[1:02:50] because it was god's voice
[1:02:52] it was god's voice my brother and sister
[1:02:54] and god will use whoever he wants to
[1:02:56] right amen so abraham had no clout of
[1:03:00] witnesses in his day but god was
[1:03:02] speaking to him and here we are in this
[1:03:05] day and the word of god is still
[1:03:07] speaking and we are here led by this
[1:03:10] word now my brother and sister look at
[1:03:12] this now more demons have been loosed in
[1:03:14] this day according to the scripture and
[1:03:16] then we look at this and we can say oh
[1:03:18] my oh my look how filthy this world is
[1:03:20] but the word of god says more revelation
[1:03:23] has been released in this day to the
[1:03:26] bride of christ so why are we looking at
[1:03:28] the negative when god is flashing the
[1:03:31] urim thumb right in front of our face
[1:03:34] saying this is me this is i jehovah in
[1:03:37] your presence the holy spirit moving in
[1:03:40] your midst we should be standing up and
[1:03:42] saying it's right here all i have to do
[1:03:45] is say lord i need more of you i need
[1:03:48] more of you i want to understand you
[1:03:50] lord i want to worship you correctly i
[1:03:53] want to serve you faithfully
[1:03:56] but you see that spirit of denomination
[1:03:58] comes in and we get cold and formal and
[1:04:00] you say oh brother paul we're not a cold
[1:04:02] formal church
[1:04:03] but the spirit's still irritating you
[1:04:13] i don't care how many demons are loosed
[1:04:15] in this day
[1:04:16] the holy ghost is here
[1:04:18] god himself has been poured out on his
[1:04:20] people
[1:04:21] he has opened up his word and just
[1:04:23] poured it out upon us i don't care how
[1:04:26] many demons are here because we have
[1:04:28] been sealed to the day of our redemption
[1:04:32] and it's not about what the devil's
[1:04:33] doing but it's about what god's doing
[1:04:36] oh hallelujah let me just move on i want
[1:04:39] to be timely
[1:04:41] now look
[1:04:45] sometimes we
[1:04:47] kind of just
[1:04:48] get a little wavy you know
[1:04:50] wind blows real hard
[1:04:53] you ever want to know the power of the
[1:04:54] wind my brother and sister
[1:04:57] you just get out where there's no houses
[1:04:59] you get out where there's no trees you
[1:05:00] just get out where it's just nothing but
[1:05:02] you
[1:05:03] and the grasslands
[1:05:06] and you will see the wind
[1:05:08] is such an incredibly powerful thing
[1:05:13] and it's subject
[1:05:14] to the holy ghost
[1:05:17] so all the power of the wind
[1:05:20] is still subject
[1:05:22] now look at this
[1:05:24] this is the third time i am coming to
[1:05:26] you
[1:05:26] and the mouth of two or three witnesses
[1:05:29] shall every word be established
[1:05:32] i told you before and foretell you as if
[1:05:35] i were present the second time and being
[1:05:38] absent now i write
[1:05:39] to them which or heretofore have sinned
[1:05:45] pretty straightforward isn't it
[1:05:46] everybody's sinner i'm writing a letter
[1:05:48] to you
[1:05:49] and to all rather oh we're all included
[1:05:52] that if i come again
[1:05:57] praise the lord
[1:05:59] praise the lord
[1:06:02] how many want the apostle paul to come
[1:06:05] and preach to us
[1:06:08] how many of us are willing to bring our
[1:06:10] band-aids to church
[1:06:12] because he says i'm not going to spare
[1:06:14] you
[1:06:15] i'm going to tell you the truth whether
[1:06:16] you like it or not
[1:06:20] since ye seek proof of christ speaking
[1:06:23] in me
[1:06:24] which to you word is not weak but is
[1:06:27] mighty in you i say amen to that the
[1:06:29] word of god in me is not weak for though
[1:06:32] he was crucified through weakness yet he
[1:06:34] liveth by the power of god
[1:06:36] so for we also are weak in him but we
[1:06:41] shall live with him by the power of god
[1:06:44] toward you amen i'm telling you my
[1:06:47] brother and sister that same power that
[1:06:49] spoke to paul that anointed him to
[1:06:51] declare i have great revelation i have a
[1:06:54] great position in jesus christ in the
[1:06:56] word of god amen that same power is
[1:06:58] loosed on you and i when was the last
[1:07:00] time that came from your mouth that's
[1:07:02] right come on when was the last time
[1:07:04] that you stood even in private and said
[1:07:06] i am the power of god on the earth today
[1:07:10] oh whoa whoa whoa brother paul that's
[1:07:11] way far out there that's way out far
[1:07:13] that's too far
[1:07:16] well it has to be
[1:07:18] either that or god gave a watered-down
[1:07:20] version of himself to you
[1:07:22] who's going to claim that one
[1:07:29] anybody can lift a hand and claim the
[1:07:30] watered-down version of christ in you
[1:07:33] no sir so we ought to be looking at this
[1:07:35] it is a powerful
[1:07:37] two-edged sword that is inside of me
[1:07:40] it's living in me and it's keeping my
[1:07:43] life clean
[1:07:46] and it's keeping the word clean
[1:07:50] you know
[1:07:50] saints i'm deviating just a moment just
[1:07:52] spare me a little
[1:07:54] you know no nicolas and spirit ever come
[1:07:56] and conquered a church
[1:07:59] i don't care how nicolaitan that
[1:08:01] preacher is how dominating he is he
[1:08:04] never conquered the church
[1:08:06] until you
[1:08:08] let him
[1:08:10] just as satan cannot overpower you
[1:08:14] until
[1:08:15] you
[1:08:16] let him
[1:08:18] come on saints
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:25] i love that for we also are weak in him
[1:08:30] but we shall live with him
[1:08:34] we're not living with some other husband
[1:08:37] come on saints i know this ties into a
[1:08:38] lot of things i've been just studying
[1:08:40] all over the map but look we're not
[1:08:42] living with another husband
[1:08:44] we have not taken another husband in the
[1:08:46] house of god and embraced it and give
[1:08:49] our vow to live with him in better and
[1:08:52] worse no i already made that vow to one
[1:08:55] and he is my husband and i am his bride
[1:08:59] and i will not deviate from good day to
[1:09:02] bad day to whatever it is because my vow
[1:09:04] was to him and him alone
[1:09:08] hallelujah
[1:09:10] by the power of god toward you examine
[1:09:12] yourselves
[1:09:15] right
[1:09:16] right along the lines of communion
[1:09:19] examine yourselves
[1:09:21] whether you be in the faith
[1:09:23] prove
[1:09:24] your own selves
[1:09:26] i should just quit the service right now
[1:09:28] and just give us all time to sit here
[1:09:30] and examine ourselves
[1:09:32] but you see that's our real true job
[1:09:33] saints
[1:09:34] not to have the preacher come on it's
[1:09:36] not to have the preacher have to go oh
[1:09:38] my here we are again i have to go out
[1:09:40] here and deal with you sean
[1:09:43] no that's not what it's about that's
[1:09:44] what the holy ghost is about
[1:09:46] that's what the spirit of god comes down
[1:09:48] reaches into a young man or young
[1:09:49] woman's heart an old man or old woman
[1:09:51] and says you didn't do right there and
[1:09:54] something in us has already been made
[1:09:56] and proven that we can respond to that
[1:09:59] because remember if he chastens you and
[1:10:01] you rebuke it
[1:10:03] now i don't like to speak these words
[1:10:04] especially for their young people but
[1:10:06] i'm not going to shirk from the word of
[1:10:07] god
[1:10:08] if we
[1:10:11] step back or
[1:10:12] will not receive correction we're
[1:10:14] bastard born that don't describe me i
[1:10:17] hold i know who my father is
[1:10:19] i know who my father is amen and forgive
[1:10:22] me for saying that for the children but
[1:10:24] still it is the truth
[1:10:26] amen
[1:10:27] so examine yourselves be in the faith
[1:10:29] prove your own selves know ye not your
[1:10:32] own selves how that jesus christ

[1:11:34] it's all the same amen one
[1:11:39] except you be re reprobates
[1:11:42] but look now he doesn't say now i want
[1:11:44] you to kind of figure out you know and
[1:11:46] hope that you're not
[1:11:48] but he says i trust that ye shall know
[1:11:50] that we are not reprobate in other words
[1:11:52] the knowledge that we're not reprobates
[1:11:54] is already here he just wants you
[1:11:57] to see it
[1:11:58] amen
[1:12:00] hallelujah comes back to knowing who we
[1:12:02] are
[1:12:03] now let me hurry along here somebody's
[1:12:05] stealing the time again
[1:12:09] now look
[1:12:14] speaking
[1:12:16] in the early verse there two or three
[1:12:18] witnesses shall every word be
[1:12:20] established
[1:12:21] and we use that as a format you might
[1:12:24] say of of establishing the scriptures
[1:12:25] full of that if you bring in accusation
[1:12:27] against a brother you know and these
[1:12:29] kind of things but my brother sister i
[1:12:31] hope you can see where i'm coming from
[1:12:32] on this we look at this now two or three
[1:12:35] witness shall every word be established
[1:12:39] speaking the word to others
[1:12:43] right what are you doing you're
[1:12:44] establishing the word you're speaking
[1:12:45] the word to others
[1:12:47] you speak
[1:12:48] the word to one another
[1:12:53] are you following me
[1:12:56] and
[1:12:58] you speak the word
[1:13:00] back to god himself
[1:13:02] you know what the lord likes to hear you
[1:13:05] he likes to hear you lord i believe your
[1:13:07] word
[1:13:08] lord you're beautiful lord i love you
[1:13:10] lord i thank you for the blood lord he
[1:13:13] likes to hear you what are you doing
[1:13:15] saints every time you speak that
[1:13:17] you're establishing that
[1:13:19] you're anchoring it more and more firm
[1:13:23] and you know if you do it in the right
[1:13:24] way you can speak that to neighbors and
[1:13:26] friends and co-workers and family and
[1:13:29] you see what it is is the words being
[1:13:31] established as you speak it you know i
[1:13:34] don't remember the man who made this
[1:13:35] statement but a a a brother shared this
[1:13:38] with me the other day and he said uh
[1:13:40] whoever it was and i don't remember now
[1:13:43] wished i could but he says you know this
[1:13:45] person which goes back a long ways he
[1:13:47] said the more outrageous the lie
[1:13:52] the more people will believe it
[1:13:57] somebody saints are you with me
[1:14:00] somebody's got to be establishing the
[1:14:02] truth
[1:14:03] satan has this outrageous lie that the
[1:14:06] earth just popped out of nowhere and we
[1:14:08] all just come
[1:14:10] from
[1:14:11] moss ponds
[1:14:12] come
[1:14:14] methane gas
[1:14:17] that
[1:14:19] somehow just
[1:14:21] bang
[1:14:22] and here you are
[1:14:25] like the little joke says no no honey
[1:14:28] your dad's side is not true your dad's
[1:14:30] speaking about his side the family
[1:14:33] god created us
[1:14:36] see my brother and sister
[1:14:38] the more outrageous
[1:14:40] the lie
[1:14:42] the more people will believe it
[1:14:45] and so you look at this
[1:14:47] and you recognize what satan is trying
[1:14:49] to do he's trying to get us all to come
[1:14:52] to such a lackadaisical place in the
[1:14:55] word that we actually would say okay
[1:14:58] well i don't know it could be this it
[1:15:01] could be that but here again i take you
[1:15:03] back to the quote where the prophet of
[1:15:04] god said look some say he's coming on a
[1:15:07] cloud
[1:15:08] some say he's coming on a white horse
[1:15:10] but just so you believe he is coming and
[1:15:14] then let god manifest his own word
[1:15:19] you won't miss it if you believe he's
[1:15:20] coming
[1:15:21] now look at this we're part of the
[1:15:23] establishment of the word did i get that
[1:15:25] do i need to go back and drive over that
[1:15:27] again or did i make that clear enough
[1:15:29] we are part of the establishment of the
[1:15:31] word in this hour it wasn't for prophet
[1:15:34] to come his voice to go on to magnetic
[1:15:36] tape or whatever it is and then we just
[1:15:38] mail tapes all over the world my brother
[1:15:40] and sister the word says there'll be a
[1:15:42] living epistle upon the earth red of all
[1:15:45] men
[1:15:46] amen that's you and i we're here in the
[1:15:49] establishment of the word for our age
[1:15:52] now look at this revelation 10 7.
[1:15:55] let's put that up there brother
[1:15:57] amen
[1:15:58] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:16:00] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:16:02] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:16:04] finished now some people say this word
[1:16:06] should
[1:16:07] leaves a possibility that it's not
[1:16:09] entire
[1:16:11] but you know the word should
[1:16:13] is also a command
[1:16:17] not a maybe not an if not a possibility
[1:16:20] but actually a command
[1:16:23] the mystery of god should be finished as
[1:16:25] he hath declared to his servant the
[1:16:26] prophet so we look at this and the word
[1:16:29] is very clear
[1:16:30] that it's in the days of the voice of
[1:16:32] the seventh angel now
[1:16:34] my brother and sister
[1:16:36] is this message prophetic
[1:16:41] did you know a prophetic word
[1:16:44] is making
[1:16:45] this book
[1:16:47] edible
[1:16:49] to the bride amen
[1:16:51] otherwise
[1:16:52] we don't know otherwise we can't deal
[1:16:55] with but a prophetic word come down
[1:16:58] and broke it down
[1:17:00] and prepared it and then delivered it to
[1:17:03] us and then i hope you don't
[1:17:05] misunderstand my use of this word
[1:17:08] enticed us
[1:17:10] or attracted what word you want to use
[1:17:12] they kind of interchange
[1:17:14] to eat it
[1:17:17] well praise the lord
[1:17:19] throw brother george under the bus
[1:17:21] i was talking to brother george about a
[1:17:22] certain circumstance one day and he said
[1:17:24] i got one better than that paul
[1:17:27] and i was like oh yeah and they started
[1:17:29] to tell me how this person
[1:17:31] they've had like 25 years of ties
[1:17:35] hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[1:17:37] dollars
[1:17:38] in a bank account
[1:17:40] and when brother branham comes back
[1:17:42] he's going to give it to him in cash
[1:17:46] does that fulfill the word of god no no
[1:17:49] man hadn't been hadn't darkened the door
[1:17:51] of a church in years
[1:17:53] when brother branham preached on the
[1:17:54] queen of sheba what did he say
[1:17:57] the people wouldn't even cross the
[1:17:58] street
[1:17:59] to go to church
[1:18:01] but the queen of sheba would rise up in
[1:18:03] that day
[1:18:04] to judge them
[1:18:06] see we have to put this all together
[1:18:08] saints we can't isolate and say this is
[1:18:10] what i think and this is what i think we
[1:18:12] have to have a balanced word of god we
[1:18:14] have to come and
[1:18:16] you know what happens
[1:18:18] when you eat a little of the book
[1:18:20] you get a little benefit of the book
[1:18:23] when you eat a little more of the book
[1:18:26] you get a little more benefit of the
[1:18:28] book when you eat the whole
[1:18:32] book
[1:18:33] you get the benefit of the whole
[1:18:37] book
[1:18:38] amen what was the prophet trying to do
[1:18:40] did he go in here and say now i only
[1:18:42] want you to read right here i want you
[1:18:44] to read right here i want you to skip
[1:18:45] that read this right no what'd he do he
[1:18:48] told us you pick your bible up you read
[1:18:51] your bible you pray over when you read
[1:18:53] your bible
[1:18:54] and you continually every day read your
[1:18:57] bible
[1:18:58] what was he doing knowing as he by
[1:19:01] prophetic word prepared the book to make
[1:19:03] it edible to you when you ate it now i
[1:19:06] like to apply i hope you don't mind just
[1:19:07] a tad bit of humor i kind of apply that
[1:19:09] same principle to a piece of pie
[1:19:12] amen i see people they cut off the end
[1:19:15] of the pie they nibble off one edge of
[1:19:17] it just leave the rest of the pie i'm
[1:19:18] sorry you just left the whole benefit of
[1:19:21] getting that piece of pie amen and
[1:19:23] that's why i'm a firm believer if
[1:19:24] there's still pie left there to eat it
[1:19:26] should be eaten
[1:19:28] because when you take the book don't
[1:19:30] stop
[1:19:31] don't stop my brother and sister keep
[1:19:33] eating the book and the more you eat of
[1:19:36] the book the more you want to eat of the
[1:19:38] book
[1:19:40] and people say well i don't know i'm
[1:19:41] just not inspired you know going to
[1:19:43] church the message just don't inspire me
[1:19:45] anymore i want to know what kind of
[1:19:47] appetite you've got
[1:19:49] i don't say that rudely i just say it as
[1:19:51] a fact
[1:19:52] now look my brothers and sisters we're
[1:19:54] not to have a rear view uh uh uh a rear
[1:19:57] view view of the word of god right amen
[1:20:00] we are the witnesses do you realize
[1:20:02] there's been a transformation
[1:20:04] we preach
[1:20:06] of this cloud of witnesses and we go
[1:20:07] back in our bible we talk about abraham
[1:20:10] and we talk about all of these others
[1:20:11] coming up through the new testament but
[1:20:13] do you realize my brother and sister the
[1:20:15] prophet of god shows us clearly from the
[1:20:17] scripture he breaks it down and makes it
[1:20:20] edible for us to realize that when he
[1:20:23] when we read the scripture in revelation
[1:20:25] that the spirit and the bride say come
[1:20:27] the prophet of god said the bride would
[1:20:29] be the final voice to the final age you
[1:20:31] realize oh some people got us now now
[1:20:33] we're going to be here the bride and
[1:20:35] we're going to be speaking and then the
[1:20:37] spirit's going to come down and confirm
[1:20:39] this and call them also
[1:20:42] you realize my brother and sister the
[1:20:44] prophet of god said it'd be the spirit
[1:20:46] of christ in you calling the rapture it
[1:20:48] will be you calling the rapture not god
[1:20:51] saying hey it wraps your time it will be
[1:20:53] a bride so filled with him so desirous
[1:20:56] of him so looking to him that she is
[1:21:00] going to cry out and she's going to draw
[1:21:02] the rapture to her
[1:21:04] so when the spirit and the bride say
[1:21:05] come
[1:21:07] there's not another voice going to show
[1:21:08] up to call the people
[1:21:11] it's the same voice saints and that
[1:21:13] voice is in you
[1:21:14] oh it's not going to be me walking out
[1:21:16] on a street corner saying come rapture
[1:21:18] come
[1:21:20] but it will be sons and daughters of god
[1:21:22] so desirous
[1:21:24] of being a true witness for jesus christ
[1:21:27] that their life will change the world
[1:21:30] around them can someone say that i want
[1:21:32] that lord
[1:21:34] hallelujah
[1:21:35] see we're witnesses
[1:21:37] that are living the word out today
[1:21:40] amen we can look back to all those um
[1:21:42] days gone by we can look back even to
[1:21:44] brother branham's life and f f
[1:21:46] baldsworth and others we can look back
[1:21:48] to that my brother and sister that won't
[1:21:49] change your neighbor that's got a blood
[1:21:51] clot
[1:21:53] what will change that neighbor is to see
[1:21:55] people that registers in that man or
[1:21:58] that family's heart that these are real
[1:22:00] christians and i have confidence in them
[1:22:02] they said they'd pray for me they'll ask
[1:22:04] their church to pray for me i see the
[1:22:06] manifestation of god in them they've got
[1:22:08] something our family don't got and if
[1:22:12] they hear that voice
[1:22:14] they won't be able to stop till they eat
[1:22:16] the book
[1:22:18] we won't have to force the book on them
[1:22:21] come on
[1:22:25] you know what'll happen
[1:22:28] we are being brought to a place that we
[1:22:30] are overcoming the contradiction
[1:22:33] of our age
[1:22:35] we're no longer in contradiction
[1:22:37] with our lord jesus christ we're coming
[1:22:40] in one with him and when his spirit
[1:22:43] moves upon us we respond
[1:22:46] i remember one time this man was kind of
[1:22:48] debating this other man
[1:22:50] and one was i don't know he's atheist or
[1:22:52] agnostic or whatever
[1:22:54] and uh
[1:22:56] he said the problem i have with you
[1:22:57] christians
[1:22:59] you're just a bunch of parrots you're
[1:23:01] just a bunch of puppets
[1:23:04] and he said yes sir and the guy's like
[1:23:06] you agree and he goes yes sir i agree
[1:23:09] when the holy spirit pulls the strings
[1:23:12] of my heart
[1:23:14] i respond
[1:23:15] and the guy's like i knew it bunch of
[1:23:17] puppets
[1:23:18] then the guy just looked in my face and
[1:23:20] says
[1:23:20] i actually would like to meet who's
[1:23:23] pulling your strength
[1:23:28] but i think i know
[1:23:29] and i really don't want to meet him
[1:23:33] oh my

[1:23:48] that the word can overcome
[1:23:50] the contradiction of our heaven amen

[1:23:55] has now become the witness
[1:23:57] amen that the word of god is
[1:24:00] overcoming this world

[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:53] we see
[1:25:55] saints
[1:25:57] what we're looking for
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:03] we don't deny our faults
[1:26:06] i was in arizona and that's what i want
[1:26:08] to share with you
[1:26:10] lovely brother just a really lovely
[1:26:12] brother him and his wife just very
[1:26:14] special people
[1:26:17] he told me he said brother paul
[1:26:20] he said
[1:26:21] when i go to church i go everywhere else
[1:26:24] i'm amongst the believers amongst the
[1:26:25] saints
[1:26:27] he said i
[1:26:29] i take these passes with me
[1:26:33] and when someone does something or says
[1:26:36] something
[1:26:38] maybe i find it offensive or i don't
[1:26:40] think it's quite right he said i just
[1:26:42] pull one of the passes out he said it's
[1:26:44] really just taking place in my mind
[1:26:47] i give him a pass
[1:26:50] because it's by god's grace
[1:26:53] i've been given a pass
[1:26:55] it's by the
[1:26:57] grace of our lord jesus christ and he
[1:26:59] said you know brother paul
[1:27:00] he said it just has
[1:27:02] i thought this was good it wasn't like
[1:27:04] it changed anybody else he said it's
[1:27:06] just done so much for me
[1:27:08] i go through life and it's like oh about
[1:27:11] no i gave him a pass
[1:27:13] oh about this deal no i gave him a pass
[1:27:16] he actually shared a real life story
[1:27:17] with real life names
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] and i thought that's beautiful
[1:27:22] that's beautiful because the brother he
[1:27:24] was sharing about i know well
[1:27:26] and he said sometimes you know he just
[1:27:27] has this certain thing and i'm like yep
[1:27:29] he does and he said i just give him a
[1:27:32] pass
[1:27:33] instead of remembering instead of
[1:27:35] holding it against him instead of making
[1:27:37] a big fuss over it i was like yup that's
[1:27:39] a brother that might be
[1:27:41] his thorn
[1:27:44] and i'm going to stand up and say well
[1:27:46] that
[1:27:48] come on stop
[1:27:50] i hope you don't mind
[1:27:51] but
[1:27:52] maybe we need to find the mirror
[1:27:55] look at our own thorn
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:27:59] spiritually saints
[1:28:01] give the pass
[1:28:03] pray for them
[1:28:04] because you see we are not
[1:28:08] a counter addiction
[1:28:10] to our lord jesus christ
[1:28:13] and the saints of this body are not a
[1:28:15] contradiction to our lord jesus christ
[1:28:18] and we are not a contradiction
[1:28:21] to one another
[1:28:23] amen
[1:28:24] have grace have mercy
[1:28:27] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:30] i'd like to sing the song you know
[1:28:33] sometimes you know when we're
