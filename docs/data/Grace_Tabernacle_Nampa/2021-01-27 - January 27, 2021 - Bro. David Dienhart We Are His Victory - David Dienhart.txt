let me say this my title tonight you want to put that up i don't know if you got it okay my title tonight is we are his victory how about that brother jason amen hallelujah right on time see how god runs everything right doesn't he amen amen i'm happy in the lord how many is happy tonight are you happy praise the lord amen it's good to be happy the joy of the lord is our strength amen amen we can choose to be happy in the lord or we can choose to be sad because of politics right we're happy in the lord let the politics go that's not who we are anyway that's not even what we're associated in amen stand with me this evening let's take your bibles first peter as i said my title here as we are is victory my subject is who you are amen it's who you are the real you we can focus all you want satan wants to focus on who you're not but god's by the opening of his word the third pull opening of his word how many understand what i'm saying by the opening of his word the bride who is that opened word is his victory that is what satan's against is the revelation but we have his answer why is he howling the way he is because the bride knows who she is that's what he's howling about because it's being revealed it's being revealed amen amen so we just thank the lord for that amen turn to me the first peter i'd like to uh first peter 1 23 and 24 and 25 putting emphasis here on the 23rd and i have other scriptures and just see how the lord leads i certainly appreciate the lord and how many know and i know i know and i can testify and do declare that every day his mercy is new mourning by morning his mercy is new i've never had a time in prayer and out in the morning in the word where i didn't see his mercy new every every morning something it just quickens quickens quickens how many say and realize that's the walk of a believer is that word being quickened quickened again and again and again from glory to glory to glory to glory he's changing me where am i being changed what am i being changed into his very image for what purpose to meet him in the air there has to be a bride there has to be a full bride come into full manifestation there has to be a bride coming of christ before we are able to meet him in the air there has to be that union invisible union which is taking place now why you say brother david if it's taking place now you ought to be able to explain it to us i can't explain faith but i know it's happening i see it in the word i see it happening in my life i see it happening through this word and it's through his word amen he has made us and we are whatever he conquered he said this is my victory and he pointed to the bride this is this is what i this is my victory here she is amen hallelujah being born again chapter 1 verse 23 being born again of not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible seed by the word and the word of god is the seed of god being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god so we see here is a word birth which liveth and abideth forever for all flesh all flesh now i'm thankful that god sent a message to tell us who we are where we've come from who we are and where we're going it took the word the open word took the very mystery of god that was in the back part of his mind kept it until here at the end so the devil doesn't have a chance we have we have come into the complete full revelation of jesus christ amen and you know who that is his bride amen without his bride is not complete amen he's not complete take it right back to genesis what completed adam what was the revelation of adam eve was the revelation the hidden mystery of adam revealed amen amen so we see here for all flesh and i'm thankful he sent his word because his word divided asunder between the spirit and the soul this open word this third pull this revelation this message that god has sent us is absolutely showing us who we are and we mature he sent a word to mature his bride the opening of those seals was set to mature his bride into full maturity of himself amen so we see here but for all flesh for all fleshes as grass and all the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower fadeth away but you're not born of flesh you are born of flesh but not born again of flesh because it says here being born again what is the new birth what is it and who is it and then you'll see who you are all right so in in verse 25 the flesh you just said what the flesh was but the word of the lord but the flesh is grass but you're born of the word and the flesh is grass and it's a weakling you can't put any trust in it it's your enemy it's enmity to the nature revealed of god in you all right but the word of the lord but the word of the lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you i'm glad today that we have a spoken word light sent to quicken the bride to quicken the seed amen to its maturity for what a body change amen let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you for the opportunity that we have to be assembled here tonight in thy name not a name i was not a name that will be and though it was and will be but lord the present tense i am this glorious victory we're speaking of the i am lord that name that is present that name we are called by we are named by you you you called your name forth and we responded now lord we are not under a man's headship we are under the very headship of our lord under the administration of the son of man for lord we are your bride the very the very manifestation the very revelation of yourself in this hour being manifested being brought forth into a full complete oneness with you we thank you for this union taking place now father we just ask you to bless the word speak through these lips of clay lord and lord open the word to your people individually by revelation for it's the only way that we are saved is by revelation in jesus christ's name we pray amen we're saved by revelation and that by what grace you may be seated i want you to remember something as we go through here that abraham's seed not abraham's seed natural but abraham's seed spiritual brother branham said that seed was the faith abraham had amen i want you to lay that into your heart because we have the evidence when you have the when you are born again and we're going to come into what this is here and i just read it to you it's a word birth amen to be born again is a word birth it's a spoken word birth you have your season to be here you weren't called in we've come here in an end time season with an end time message amen with a final full revelation of jesus christ to take us out of here amen we are on our way homily believe the bride is marching in step being the word in step with the word amen she's very few but that's none of my business how few amen i'm just called to preach who she is and what she is amen and that's our revelation in this hour the prophet said those seals were open for that very purpose to show the bride how she was in the beginning and how she'd be here in the end and who she was right in the middle amen the whole revelation if the bible the word is the complete revelation of jesus christ it is so with the bride because she cannot be a word born bride and be something different than who he is hallelujah let me just say this that the word birth the word birth is jesus christ amen it's not another you can't have the word born and not be jesus christ the word born the word birthed amen the word for the season birthed is jesus christ it's not another amen it's not another that i just read it to you we're born by the word amen the word that birth there is jesus christ amen amen amen we are his victory we are his word living and operative now read i'll read as i well let's go to hebrews right now let's just go over there just at the moment i was going to read it towards the end it's amazing how sometimes the lord takes what's at the end and puts it at the beginning we know that as ministers we know that i have to just follow how the lord leads in hebrews 4 12 for the word of god this is what we're speaking of tonight the word of god amen the word of god is quick and powerful if you have a school field that quick and powerful means living and operative it's the same thing the prophet said he says who is this bride she is the word living and in action amen she's not just not just a word you can't have the word living and not be an action the word living is the very literal life of jesus christ living amen and it's got to be active it'll follow the word it'll act the word it won't be you it won't be david trying to act it out it'll be the word acting it out that's quite a difference it's not gonna be the flesh man trying to figure out how to do it it'll be a revelation to you to do it amen we live and walk by faith we don't we don't live by our own thinking we we we're not here to express our own thinking we're here to live by faith now faith is the substance of things hoped for and we know faith is a revelation so the revelation is the substance of things hoped for the revelation of the word it's the substance of things hoped for and the evidence it's the evidence you want to know what the evidence of a spirit-filled believer is it's that faith seed inside of you it's christ revealed in you amen is the evidence of things not seen in other words everything you when the holy spirit fills you with himself everything you have need of in this journey is in you amen you always in fact you always you always had the token but you didn't know what to do with it you didn't know what to do with it it was always there i wasn't just become a believer i was a believer before the foundation of the world i was in jesus christ the token before the foundation of the world but it's got to come to manifestation in a season amen is that right and just like you know just like uh rahab she had the token there she had the she had the the red red rope or the red twine or the red she had it she just didn't know what to do with it but until its predestinated season and time when it would come in the manifestation then it went into action hallelujah now we we have caught we've got a message beyond pentecost here we're not doing away with pentecost we've got to come through our pentecost but we've got a message that pentecost makes way for amen and the baptism of the holy ghost made way for what the holy ghost himself the token himself jesus christ himself the very literal life of christ himself to come right down in perfection or maturity again back to the word itself amen amen you see this is where we're at and that's why the devil's upset and that's why he's trying to get you every day to get your thoughts off of that word that's why he's trying to trying to get you to look at look at your how you feel and how you what you reason with and this and that and pull you this way and pull you that way and it's getting hotter and hotter this battle getting hotter and hotter all the time but so is the word getting more perfect and more perfect and more perfect in maturity all the time amen amen so so we see his we are his word living we just read it here the word of god the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of who you are and who you're not amen that's what is sent to do what else is going to unveil to you who you are it'll have to come through the word amen amen the spirit always the holy ghost travels through the word amen but if that word is not in the soul to meet it amen then it won't it that holy spirit can be there it can be anointed you can be anointed but if the word isn't in your soul to meet that word it'll never produce jesus christ because the dynamics of the word must come on the word amen are you with me because the bride's got to be both dynamics and mechanics you say well i i'm a good person i have let me just read to you what the prophet said here he said satan doesn't care how religious you are this is in this is the this is in the arising of the sun paragraph 30. satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine well brother david doesn't matter you can have an intellectual conception of the doctrine and if satan can get you just on your intellectual side with that and make you feel like you're a right smart boy you know the doctrine but that isn't enough amen are you with me okay he said he said i if you miss he said he don't care how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to and we're talking about message churches because that's where we're at today or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing it only it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again the new birth is who you are this is my what i'm wanting to deal with tonight this new birth this word birth is who you are you say no brother david you just said it's jesus christ you're getting the message because that's who the bride is amen you start bringing the word you start bringing you start living the word as a word test just let just let it live out of you just go to acting out of you you're coming back to the word coming back to the word satan doesn't like that but jesus took who he was the word and defeated the devil by the word he took his father's word he took the word he knew his position he knew he was the word living he went back to the word he went back to the very scriptures wrote of him and took the word and defeated the devil are you with me amen amen he knew where his victory laid he knew he was sent amen as god's own victory over all sin sickness amen he defeated it amen that's his victory what he when he went for he got it because he's a conqueror amen all right he said so by one spirit we're only born again by one spirit we'll come down to that in just a moment more brother branham said as the end time prophecies will repeat repeat what you'll get in this next statement i believe as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god that was john first forerunner 1933 on the river the star that pillar of fire come down told the prophet look up and he looked up and and voiced the voice out that people heard people were standing right there they saw it come down pictures of it taken went on the associated press he says that john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ your message your message amen your message will forerun the second coming of christ amen all right so as the end time prophecies will repeat he said i believe as the first forerunner came from the wilderness now this is pick up your pen and write this is not this is brother brown this is god taking his pen and writing through him this is god speaking right here writing writing right just pick up your pen and write he started writing what was coming to him god was given him to write this to us as a part of this love letter remember we said you know god god just said it in such a way he said i pray that you would have revelation and come have a spiritual understanding of what god's saying what god is doing without coming right out and saying it oh no brother david we have to have it just the way it was said well i'll have you know he said it in such a way to thin down his crowd and he said it in such a way that it would stumble some and some would hear it and god still does it that way amen now that's his way that's not my i'm not telling you that that's his way some are going to receive some are going to hear but he said it in such a way that that seed will hear that word amen okay he does it all right thank god for the word that was laying here in us ready to be quickened in the hour that we're here he had to speak it amen for we are his spoken word bride all right so he said as those end time prophecies will repeat i believe as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner who's the second forerunner malachi 4 our prophet is that right he said he said i've i've introduced you to him i've introduced you to him he said what's my purpose of coming on earth spoken words original seeds what my purpose of coming on earth is to forerun that coming word remember my subject is who you are he said he said that's who i've come to forerun now watch what he says the second forerunner will probably do the same as these things repeat will do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride who is who himself is that right it's himself remember how brother brown said he come in three sons names son of david son of god i'm excuse me son of man son of david son of god son of david is that right he said to begin with it was son of man then son of god through the ages and then right here just before the millennium steps in or the rapture he's got to come again as son of man is that right how many know that's right according to the message he said it's got to be son of man again and he said the son of man and his coming would unite these two together him and his body as one because the son of man's return is the head he was the corner now he's the head of the corner amen if there was a first in order to have the first adam he had and he fell he had to restore a man that couldn't fall is that right it wouldn't fall that was the second adam but the second adam come up had in himself when he went to calvary both male and female and out of him come a bride is that right he was smitten just like adam was in the beginning and out of him come a bride and that bride started out as that bride she was original brother branham saw her in the preview of the bride saw her marching then he saw the worldly church and it got worse and worse and worse come to the the church of the us and it was filthy vulgar low down he said he didn't have words describe it but then again here come that little bride brother branham said masterpiece she is alpha and omega he is alpha and omega there had to be a first bride went into the ground there had to be a restoration of that bride i will restore my message and my end time messenger i will restore all that the palmer room the cankerworm the caterpillar the locusts had eaten right down to a stump but he couldn't get to the root because out of the middle of that tree brother brahm said out of the heart of it out of the middle of it he would produce another bride amen he would produce himself which she was in the beginning she'll produce himself in bright form you say how do you mean that because he told paul why are you persecuting me is that right he told he said paul saul saul light struck him down he said why are you persecuting me what do you mean i'm persecuting you lord he knew that was the lord why is it hard for you to kick against the pricks you're persecuting me because i'm here in bride form is that right okay what about at the end when the bride's supposed to return again amen it would have to be the bright coming of christ amen and it would have to mature to the complete oneness with himself so the head and the body are uniting we're not waiting for it to unite we are uniting hallelujah and so here we are in this end time and he's and then we're being put people are pointed not to another not to something else to himself in bride form and she's pointed and said here's the lamb here's your husband here is the one that you come out of here's the one you're married to amen amen all right now in john 1 13 let's go over there just a minute now that word will discern what's in your heart that word brings out what's in you because remember we're what we're what we're dealing with here tonight is the very is eternity unfolding behind badger skins only men on that one but that's what it is what were you what was laying inside your heart you didn't have anything to do that with it god put it there so he comes he unveils himself when he unveiled himself brother branham said when he unveils himself he said you come to yourself he has to unveil himself for you to be come to yourself that's what the seventh seal was all about it's his coming again as he promised he would for the rapture for the meeting in the air there has to be that unfolding there has to be the unfolding of himself in the bride form in order for it to be complete that's why the prophet said christ in you christ revealed in you which is the new birth christ revealed in you is the new birth christ revealed in you is who you are christ revealed in you identifies the evidence and how is it evidence by you being able to hear and receive the word for your season to receive revelation of that word is the evidence that you always were in him because the seed is that faith that was in him is now in you how did he know who he was how did jesus know it it was revealed to him that's right he was he was he come in this earth he was to say but he was the word yes he was but he had the re he had to go to jordan and receive the holy spirit and become both mechanics and dynamics or dynamics and mechanics are you with me that word as long as it's laying there without the dynamics it's good mechanics but it won't go anywhere without the dynamics upon it amen all right so he became he was the full complete he was he was our masterpiece but out of him was taking a portion apart now he's got to bring that part back into himself to make it complete all right are we getting the picture you didn't come this word birth you're born by the word you can be nothing else but him amen that word birthed in you will identify itself by hearing and receiving the word for your season and it's always a true revelation is going to be identified back in this word it will never leave this word if you have the word truly open to you it's going to dump it's going to speak through genesis to revelation got to come together amen all right now so she is him she must be restored now okay now let's john 1 john 1. back to john chapter 1. i just want to drop this in as i read first peter 1 23. let's see what john 1 says 1 13. let's take verse 12. but as many now he came to his own his own creation his own his own that he made and his own received him not but as many as received him there was always an elect few wasn't there but as many as received him to them gave he power or authority to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood all you had your first birth was a blood sexual not of blood and i'm talking about sexual now natural because we are born by the blood of god how many know that all right but he's talking about now he's talking about not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but you were born of god you were born of god the gift of god is eternal life are you with me you were set by grace through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not from god of god you had your very portion in him to begin with amen to be expressed in this hour what is the expression of himself amen all right let's go to first john 5 first john 5. i don't know how far i'm going here tonight so just only go so far as far as the lord wants first john 5 whosoever believeth now that's the key right there believeth brother branham said the holy ghost the holy ghost the token the token in you identifies the believer recognizes the believer what is the believer brother bam said in perfect faith the believer is the faith that is in you he said that's the believer he said oh i like that don't you he said he said the faith in you is the believer what's god recognized what do you recognize in adam or excuse me abraham by giving him the circumcision natural it was it was a token that he was that his faith had been received he was in the covenant unconditionally all right now the token is our seal is our recognition see why the token is a must you must have the token if you don't have the token you haven't even been recognized a believer your faith has not been recognized by god he says a strong statement but that's the truth brother brahms said that that circumcision of the spirit identifies and recognizes you in christ and that faith that you have is that that you are genuine seed of god and that faith is his and that faith is recognized and it is recognized as his own faith and by that abraham by that was i'm trying to find that word um let me just get back here what he said there i've just got to find that word i'm wanting in the fourth chapter oh yeah accounted to him for righteousness that faith was counted to him for righteousness then that faith was recognized to be his own are you with me it identified it you see you say well i believe in the blood but have you come through the blood you can't see have you come through it yet that's the thing you come through it what's on the other side of it if you genuinely come through it life is there to identify amen you've got to enter all the way in you've got to come all the way into the inside of the inside we've got to enter in all the way into the very presence of himself you come face to face with him then you realize that he is your revelation he is then you come face to face with who you are brother brown said he's he's pouring himself into you he said he he manifesting himself pouring himself out pouring himself into you and he said he's becoming you're he's becoming personalized to you he's becoming personalized brother braham said another place he said the revelation of this message would unite the so to two together until they're both the same self person the revealing of the son of man would so unite the bride in him as one that they're the same self-person amen first john 5 whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god didn't say whosoever believeth that jesus was the christ is the christ and no man can call jesus the christ only by the holy spirit so it's got to be revealed to you that he is the christ and if it's a revelation to you that he is the christ that's he that's born again that's he that's born of god amen without brother bram said without being born again how can you say he is the christ or he is lord right that's first corinth that's first corinthians 12 3 if you want to look that scripture up no man can call jesus the lord except by the holy ghost amen he can't say he's lord without having the holy ghost he's amen are you with me a lot of people a lot of people have a title the title i believe the message it's a message title but they don't have the abstract to it are you with me it's not having just the title you need to have the abstract that identifies that title that that title is genuine and you're cleared and there's nothing behind you that can stand your way and nothing ahead of you your future is clear every trial every test you have to go through your future is clear those that he foreknew he called and those that he called he justified and those that he had justified he's already glorified amen your future can you realize what the token is it's the birth of the word in you and that's got to grow and how's it going to grow if that word's living in you you can't stay out of this message you've got to feed on it you've got to eat on it you've got to you've got to drink in the light living water and as you drink it in you mature you mature you grow you grow the path of the justice as a shining light that grows more and more amen unto that perfect day hallelujah what a perfect day what a perfect day a perfect day a millennium amen see we're right in the throes of his second coming we're right here we're right here you say oh be great when he comes he's coming amen it just consummates in it in a body change amen is that right what for it then opens it up right back for us to come back to the earth after its baptism right back into the earth both husband and wife without a bride being in a maturity if we meet in the air it's both husband and wife it's the same god all the time now he has a family are you with me now it's family it's a it's a masterpiece family and where we go from there husband and wife come right back out in the millennium in the third coming of christ i'll just let you chew on that all right now first john 5 he says again whosoever believeth believeth not just to make believe not just some high hope that's right but believeth substance faith revelation it believeth a real believer it's revealed to you that this jesus is christ christ in you the mystery is christ in you unveiled unveiled unfolding god's great revelation is christ in you and brother brahm said watch that revelation unfold it unfolds it unfolds it unfolds it unfolds right into a body change you just follow him from glory to glory until you step into that final glory amen amen it's what he said amen you're walking like enoch you're walking with god amen you're walking with him he said i'll not only be with you i'll not only walk with you i'll walk in you i'll be in you you will the world won't see me but you see me amen i am that revelation i am the victory i am the revelation in you that makes you my victory all right first john 5 1 again he says and everyone that loveth him that begat what identifies you love him and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him amen all right see by this we know we love the children of god by this by this by this we know we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous the love of god is to keep his commandments this is the love of god that you keep his word you keep his command how can he birth then you do anything different he won't do anything different you're identified a believer you're identified you're it's your faith identified but oh brother you don't know what god did yesterday and i did this who did it you did it or you the man did it it must have been because that word inside of you birth and i'm not i'm not talking about something you hope it happens i'm talking about a divine revelation of himself in you you know you pass from death unto life the new birth is christ revealed in you the new birth is jesus christ revealed personally to you individually to you and you walk after spirit brother the prophet said pick up your pen and write he said you can't make her disbelieve the word then who failed it wasn't the word this failed but that's not counted to you because it's already been counted to you who you are then you rise right back up and say lord i didn't mean to do that is that right you never did anything to merit this revelation in you you didn't do one thing to merit it you didn't do one thing it was by grace through revelation that you're saved and not of works lest any man boast you can do all kinds of works you can and i'm not against good works but you can have all these good works and never have the love of god in you why you can you can have faith to move mountains and never have the love of god in you hello because you'll move mountains by the holy ghost but that doesn't mean he's living inside of you without having the evidence of receiving and hearing the word for your season you can be anointed and still not have it in your spirit it's the seed brother sister that makes the difference i'm talking about a word birth i'm talking about a seed birth i'm talking about that seed being quickened he sent the holy spirit to quicken the seed all right we're talking about as i said eternity unveiled unfolding in you maturing onward marching forward amen all right so we come down here to verse 4 what i want to get to for whatsoever for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world the revelation of who we are our faith which is what his faith whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen who's who's going to overcome the world that seed faith seed christ in you makes you his victory amen amen all right galatians 3 29 if you'd like to turn over there just a moment let's look at this a minute and i've got some quotes if i can get to a few of them we'll try before we close here um galatians 3 and verse 29 and if you be christ if ye be christ then are ye abraham's seed faith and heirs according to the promise according to the promise now as i said you know when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law galatians 4 4 the fullness of time came he sent his son to redeem them that were under the law that they might receive the adoption of sons amen so he came out of him was what his bride them then she fell and what and in the dark ages she went in the ground what what came up you can't keep life down don't touch my oil and wine keep your hands off of it see and she sprang back up luther denominated god pruned it off wesley denominated i mean is they messy they denominated after his message wesley and luther didn't but those that followed and god just pruned it off the vine is that right long come pentecost all under the man age luther wesley pentecost was all under the man anointing amen but now when the seven seals were opened we've come under an eagle anointing now we've come under a word for maturity amen no longer a man anointing now it's under the anointing of the eagle revelation of the word amen prophetic are you with me amen now pentecost come out they denominated god pruned it off but i'll come the eagle and i will restore saith the lord i'll bring this thing right back to what she was in the beginning i will restore the original faith i will restore that original word i will restore that original seed will bring it right back to his position and i've kept this full revelation a mystery until this day now i'm gonna pull back the seventh seal and let you see who you are fully i'm going to let you come into the full revelation of jesus christ now let's just go into some of the things he said if we can just get into this some of this he said and the church age you'll recognize what i'm saying here he said it's the seed he said be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god he said it is the word or seed amen what's a word it's god's thought expressed but that word first was in him before it was expressed it was thought is that right god had in his own mind eternally his eternal thoughts but it had to be expressed in order for it to become creation it had to be expressed so what came eternally from god was his own seed there's only one form of eternal life and that's god if you have eternal life dwelling in you it showed that you were in god to begin with you were a believer to begin with you never sinned to begin with you were always his to begin with amen amen and because you're his to begin with and you come down here and you are his now you're going to live the word for its day and hour and time amen see so here we are he said it is the word or the seed that comes predestinated eternally from god that is it he said that is it way back too far way back there too far for the human mind to grasp the eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed jacob i have levi loved and esau have i hated other words esau god eternally hated him esau didn't have eternal life esau was eternally separated from god can you say amen all right but jacob i loved now how many knows that he loved you you can't have the love of god in you to love him without him first loving you and when you go around saying well i guess i did this i guess i don't have this and i be careful you're speaking the flesh language the language he wants you to speak is what you do have i have his perfect will i have his life i am him manifested i'm the message manifested the world doesn't want to hear that and neither do a lot of message believers but to the saints that's their confession i know who i am i know that i'm one with him i know that i am the i am i know he said brother david you're just both i'm not boasting anything in this i can't boast in this but i can boast in him and i'm in him he chose me in him before the foundation of the world when did he choose you before the either boy did good or bad good or evil what do you have drawing inside of you what's the draw inside of your heart as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so quit trying to make believe this and get genuine be what you are in your heart and if your heart condemns you i have a remedy i have a cure you say brother i want to serve god i want to please him don't try to hide away then be what you are in your heart amen from the heart the mouth speaketh if it isn't from the heart it's hypocritical you've got to be what you are don't try to hide it don't try to make believe it don't try to act like it dress like it if it's not in your heart to do it you're just being a hypocrite amen do i hear an amen hallelujah all right we don't want to be that i want to be what's in me i want to be in my heart i want to speak what's in my heart i want to live what's there amen can i do that myself no can he do it yes i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me all right see neither child was born neither had done good or evil but god knew so when did he justify you when did he declare you righteous when didn't you sin he said you never sinned in the first place you were justified already justified you say well brother outbourne and sin shape and iniquity yes but you had the word inside of there that just had a time to be quickened and it was quickened you'll stay with the word you'll live the word you'll walk with the word amen and you'll discern the difference between good and evil you'll discern the difference between that which is of god and that which isn't of god even though those spirits are so close you have the discerner and the discerner will not lead you that way he will lead you into all truth amen we're not out here flirting and letting that other spirit uh try to control and lead you you have a lot of people out here that claim to be messy believers that don't have any discernment i'm not trying to be mean i'm just trying to show the difference when the discerner comes and lives in you it said it would discern the thought of the heart i don't see visions i'm not talking about that but he sees and he guides you and he leads you and will direct you into all truth all truth you won't flirt with the world you're not going to flirt with that ungodly spirit you're not going to flirt with that spirit that wants to suck you into its intellectual denominational domination you're going to recognize it amen and if husbands ahead of their home like they ought to be they ought to recognize it all right the thought became expressed and jacob alone was the seed and jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birth and the covenant of god the birthright amen if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of christ filling you other words you'll be born again if you are that true seed the holy ghost the spirit will baptize you you will hear the word the spirit will baptize you into the body of christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age you will receive the voice again jesus was the royal seed who are you i've got another quote right here he said you're the royal seed well is there two jesuses no there's only one is there three gods no only one amen and who are you you're that one born of god you're that one you can't be born of god and not be that one that was quite a statement are you with me how can you be born of god and not be what birthed you if you're the seed of god and god is the seed and his eternal life what is in you what are you who are you where is he then where is he he's in you just exactly to the promise that he said he would be he would be in you now let's just can i just well it's 8 55 about five minutes his message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way and that certain way is by revelation they will hear what the messenger has already received from god and they'll receive it and by that they will become the final voice to the final age amen all right god is known by simplicity and revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person it's not your theology god has known it's a revelation of jesus christ christ in you is god's great revelation amen he said when jesus christ by revelation comes through into you by the new in the new birth he he's he is he said that the revelation of jesus christ through the new birth he he is born in there when christ comes into you he is born in there who is born in there he is he said he built his church upon the revelation of who he is all right then who are you if he builds a church on the revelation of who he is who are you it had to be who he is amen you're not going to build another he's not going to build another another he'll build his self in bride form amen are you with me the the she the bride is his body amen she's the hearer of the word all right i'm just skipping real fast right here because i've got to close now then his life will be projected your life is gone he borns he bore he he's he's birthed in there he ejects his own life and your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminences lords he's got the preeminences to the people they see the very life the very works the very signs the very wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest is not even called to at all watch god's great revelation unfolding he that has begun a good work in you the work of his own self will will finish it he that called you will also faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it will not lead you away from his word he does not lead you by sensations and feelings because you got happy you could shout that is no you can do that all you want that's no sign you still are born of god i believe in shouting i believe in those things but but you can do that and still not be born again we're talking about a word birth we're talking about the word himself we're talking about the word coming to life in you then you're going to see that word you're going to hear that word and you'll line up with that word amen all right now it's seed time he said now remember he said it's what is it not them people he said the headship and the body has become one unit quite a statement isn't it has become one unit paragraph 591 christ the mystery of god revealed he said it's god manifested god manifested god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer twain no longer twain must be a spiritual union taking place an invisible union it's not known to the public it's not a public show it's christ in you all right he said he said god and his church are no longer twain they're one they are one god in his church is one christ in you god's great revelation glory to god you're even you're bearing his name you're bearing his life you're bearing the name jesus the anointed the reason is called jesus he is the anointed it's the anointed body of christ proving manifesting god like that body did and that body redeemed every one of these bodies and through there god works his threefold manifestation god all he was poured into christ christ poured into the people bride the church is that right god sanctified a people that he himself would come and live in what's next millennium amen the rap we have a rapture to take we're taking a rapture we're on our way in a rapture we are raptured daily having being quickened daily walking with god daily you remember brother branham walking with god and he come walking with god after that storm was moved and he's walking with god and then all of a sudden he said he sees his wife out there black-headed her arms out like that and he said in every way i was a young man what do i wonder what just swept over him and what was happening and then he said i come out of that and he says he said what was i doing oh yes he said i was walking with god he said god said why don't you walk with me and he started walking down through those trees and that just changed right oh yes he said i was walking with god that's the simplicity who do you see as a young woman black headed there was his wife before him who are we aiming on meeting we're meeting loved ones we're meeting the bride we're meeting those that have gone on before we're going to meet them they're going to be young they're going to be young is that right we're going to meet him and you're ready to be changed hallelujah that is so close brother sister there's a bride that's in their maturity i'm telling you in the name of the lord it may not be very many but there's a bride in maturity amen and she's getting very close because all these other we see these other natural things moving coming up to where they are and insanity what about the bride moving up into what she is in not insanity but in sanity see the only sane one among them we have the mind of god aren't you happy tonight that you have the mind of god now it's seed time how may it say amen to that it's seed time it's bride time brother brahm said this is rapture time it's uniting time we've had the sign right up there 1963 right up the mountain he said it is the rising of the sun he was preaching all about it we've had the sign of the uniting who's uniting what's uniting with the head amen she's uniting the head and her becoming one i wish i had time to get all of this but i'm just skipping over it and i've just got to close now it's time he said brother braham said when he that when he the holy ghost has come he will take these things that i told you and revealed them to you there's your evidence there's your evidence when he the true spirit of truth is come he will reveal these things to you and we'll show you things that is to come he said that's the birth amen the birth is a revelation christ in you a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new birth that's a new birth he said he was the word revealed to you we are his victory paragraph 594 christ the mystery of god revealed justified in his sight we are are we why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in his last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory you can't how do you have a gospel is something you have experienced yourself that's the gospel you have experienced it you lived in it you have something to preach what are you preaching what's been revealed to you that's the gospel that's power in that word all right when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us we're already potentially raised up because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to an eternal word of the eternal god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever it's seed time it's bride time he said the shucks are dead the chucks are dried up the virgin word time not touched it's a virgin remember he said remember a virgin word time if you put it in the hands of a denomination it won't be virgin it'll be manhandled the time you get to it will be manhandled but god's church is not touched by denomination hallelujah it's a virgin born word of god made manifest jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever did you hear what he just said but then again did you hear what he just said we all have these ears but i pray god let it drop into this heart he that has an ear to hear amen amen that's not judging anybody that's just saying the truth that's the truth of it amen now you see who she is she jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever hallelujah how wonderful i love it i believe it i know it's the truth it'll not be touched there'll be no denominational manhandling in the virgin birth of the bride brother david virgin birth of the bride spiritual birth for a natural body change amen hallelujah is that right what's going to take you there this opened word do you understand this book you're to eat the book you become the book who are the people of that open book what did he open it for to claim what he redeemed and when the master of the house is risen up how many know he's risen up amen sure he has and conjunction something to follow he will close the door when the last one's in you say well that could be it could be i don't know but i'm going to preach it like there's still somebody can receive it just be thankful if you're in you're in and it ought to put a desperation in our hearts to get in amen all right closing here how can prophecy come only through the prophet it's the word of the lord hear ye dry bones let me just back up here notice i'm going to close i'll try to close on this right now notice when the word moves down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing be added or taken from it so the same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife their flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit see amen how do you know it bears the same record the same fruit same word manifest christ same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same signs things i do you do also oh hallelujah he said notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell preached to the souls in prison that's right his flesh only died then he raised it up again and quickened it quickened means to be made alive his fled because i live he said you live also his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years his flesh quickened made alive now watch carefully what he says his flesh which was his body who is the bride brother brown said to be his body she had to be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone she is he said that's the bride what makes this mortal flesh his flesh because the same spirit that raised up jesus christ from the dead dwell in you it'll also quicken your mortal body identifying that he's redeemed it and it's his and he'll bring it subject to the word if you see that say you have the spirit and it quickens you away from that word it's not the spirit of god he said i'll quicken them to the word if that same spirit dwells in you then it's then your body's recognized to be his and he'll raise it up again amen all right and he said that's the word his body the bride is that's the word he said she's the word it's being it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in in the reformation and now she is standing upon her feet can these bones live again referring to ezekiel he said yes he said prophesy how can prophecy come only through the prophet it's the word of god hear ye dry bones the word of the lord and sinews skin come upon them they stood up a mighty army and began to march towards zion glory to god that's him that's him the victory who's him she's him the victory that's him that's him we are him we are his victory let's stand together therefore do we have a promise in paul said for me to live is christ philippians 1 21 for me to live is christ and die is gain it's a win-win for me to live as christ for me to live is him this is who i am paul said for me to live is him and to die is gain brother sister i can say with all my heart there is no more fear there's nothing to fear when you see who you are when you see the head and the body are becoming one unit in you individually when you see in the revelation of that that it's him in you it's him and you and i in him and he and me as he said would be our revelation in this hour you'll know that i'm in you and you and me [Music] amen what's going to take me away what's going to stop me i have my refuge i have my place satan cannot put his hands in there and get me out when i'm sealed in satan is sealed out satan can't reach me i'm in christ christ defeated him he's a conquered devil aren't you thankful that you've conquered the flesh aren't you thankful you've conquered death you've conquered sin you've conquered the world you've conquered darkness that's you the bride that's christ that's christ what's unfailing what's unfolding [Music] eternity you are eternal life you are his eternal possession you are his kingdom the word made spirit made power living in you that's who you are wait brother sister this is just a touch tonight i wish i could have taken everything here but that would be still a touch you can't even stop it dovetails back and forth back and forth all the way all the way brother brown preaching right here and come out here the seals brother sister his coming was in secret that's why we're having such a time because the secrets revealed to you [Music] amen hallelujah that's under that seventh seal he kept it a mystery he didn't let it come out amen brother brown said it's open and you know what he said he said that seventh seal opens up his coming amen opens up his coming hallelujah are you one of them [Music] see are we one of them are you one of them someplace here it ought to produce oh yeah can i just read one more [Music] therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creator denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living who is this bride his love [Music] the bible said come arise my love my one come away amen we're on the move we're marching out of here why don't we join us i feel the tug then release yourself to that tug that's in your soul because brother branham said that little tug toward him is what he come to quicken if you know you're not right and yet your desire in your heart is i want to be right i want to be what he is i want this revelation in me then yield to that tug yield to god let him quicken that hunger that thirst that desire in you amen then we at the end of the messages see the action of the great holy spirit come down see him come down visible before the people even take pictures of it see it working and showing it's not a man it's not a preacher it's not a certain congregation it's the holy spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of jesus christ now it's embodied in the body of his bride it should throw us into desperation amen amen that's right see he was the firstborn of the creation of god firstborn beginning of the creation he was the firstborn among many brethren this bride is the literal spoken word seed right amen do you love him tonight the revelation of jesus christ in this hour that's what he's saying to you this morning this evening he's bringing to you the revelation of jesus christ in this hour what's he saying not what he was in another hour but what he was is now what he was is now he's the same and the bible expresses that it's growing in the bride to the full stature amen you are the living operative word praise the lord do we know that song i had some song here do we have do you i don't know maybe jason might know it i it i just know one part of it his his word will stand his word will stand you know do you have do you know that one let's and you are my sanctuary if i can read or do those two okay just keep eating brother sister don't let nothing keep you away from that word husband wife children let nothing come between you and that word what god sent through his prophet was sent for your deliverance and ascent for your rapturing your change this message was sent for that purpose [Music] don't let nothing come between you and that word if husband won't believe it you go on and believe it if wife won't believe it you go on to believe it don't worry about your family and children claim them under the lord jesus your husband your wife put them in the hands of god and you live the word before him or before her that's right what are you going to do with this jesus called christ what are you going to do so maybe mommy and daddy make it i make it no what are you going to do sis what are you going to do brother what are you going to do with this jesus called christ who is evidently proven and vindicated to be present in this hour he come to bring you home amen we're looking for him we're going to meet him there's a wedding supper there's a great union yet to come to pass we can't but we can't physically meet him that way physically as a as as seeing him and unless we have this uniting of himself in us because he pours himself into you and you are becoming one with him for the wedding supper amen i'll stop preaching go ahead you sing sing that song [Music] some says one more book upon don't you let the devil tell you that but the message it contains that's right [Music] amen his word will stand amen think of it are you his wife is that your desire for more of him everything else is gonna pass away brother sister that word will stand a man believes to his promise is sure his love will endure and forever his word [Music] can you say that you have no fear for the word of god gates of hell with a sword that conquers every hallelujah the gates of hell shall not prevail this against of jesus christ amen that's my revelation is it your revelations [Music] what about you still god's word is true it's the absolute promise is sure is love will [Music] [Music] his word will stand now listen to that brother sister his word will stand it's not the things that are seen they're temporary [Music] his his promise is sure love will endure he's gonna keep his words amen i say amen amen and amen he will not bypass his word he will keep his word that ought to put every individual here in desperation [Music] don't leave me here lord let me know you reveal yourself to me i must see you personally you gotta lord i can't bypass this token you're gonna keep your word and your word requires the token [Music] amen it's the requirement not your church affiliation not your good merits not your good works any of that it's his life is the token and it must be birthed in you heavenly father i just feel such a press [Music] such a warning going out lord as the bible said take heed that you neglect not so great as salvation lord jesus search every heart here tonight your word is the searcher lord just open search let them see what's inside their soul tonight discern it

come to a real death just a real death to self lord and recognize that they has to have that life they've got to have that life the only way we can get it is go to him that promised and take him at his word and say god i i just i'm not going to be settled until i know that you're in me reveal yourself in me lord fill me with your [Music] life here i've met the requirements i've come the way of

your hunger you can tell what's in you by the drawing amen it said this if the deep called it to the deep there must be a deep to respond to that call there has to be a deep out there to respond to your call for him if you're truly hungry for god there's more of god for you i hunger for more of god i know there's more of him for me amen brother sister this walk with god is you ceasing and god doing that's what it is it's you ceasing and god doing [Music] oh heavenly father i present this congregation to you and these words that have been that have gone out over the airwaves those on the internet whatever it may go lord i know not but it's your word don't let them miss don't let them miss this unveiled word lord in them you know those that are yours you know you knew them before the foundation of the world i don't believe they're here by chance tonight i believe you brought them and they've come under your word which can never fail it can never pass away you'll keep every word oh
