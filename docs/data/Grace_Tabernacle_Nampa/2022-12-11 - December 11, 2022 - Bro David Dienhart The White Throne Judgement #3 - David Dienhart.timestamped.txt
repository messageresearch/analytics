[24:27] the presence we're feeling here will be
[24:29] in her room as she's listening to the

[28:28] we love you Lord we thank you in Jesus
[28:31] Christ name we pray
[28:32] amen
[28:34] [Music]
[28:45] I'd actually like to read a couple of
[28:47] scriptures just really quick
[28:50] and you can read along if you'd like
[28:51] Psalm 143 starting in
[28:55] verse 6 and I'll read through 12.
[28:58] I stretch forth my hands unto thee my
[29:01] soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty
[29:04] land Salah
[29:06] Hear Me speedily O Lord my spirit
[29:09] faileth hide not thy face from me lest I
[29:13] be like unto them that go down into the
[29:14] pit
[29:16] cause me to hear thy loving kindness in
[29:18] the morning
[29:19] for in thee do I trust cause me to know
[29:22] the way wherein I should walk
[29:25] for I lift up my soul unto thee Deliver
[29:28] Me O Lord from my enemies I flee unto
[29:31] them to hide
[29:32] to hide me
[29:34] teach me to do thy will
[29:37] for thou art my God thy spirit is good
[29:40] lead me into the land of uprightness
[29:44] Quicken Me O Lord for thy name's sake
[29:47] for thy righteousness sake bring my soul
[29:50] out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off
[29:53] mine enemies and destroy all of them
[29:55] that afflict my soul for I am thy
[29:59] servant
[30:01] also I just would like to read out of
[30:02] Deuteronomy 8 8.
[30:07] I know I'm not a pastor I'm not your
[30:10] minister brothers and sisters
[30:12] I'm not super spiritual now that I've
[30:14] been to Israel so
[30:18] everybody just relax including me Trevor
[30:21] just relax okay
[30:24] [Laughter]
[30:26] lawyers might have a yamaka I probably
[30:29] brought one back let's see
[30:32] uh
[30:33] Deuteronomy 8 and verse 8. isn't that
[30:37] interesting eight and eight
[30:39] it's interesting a land of Wheat and
[30:42] barley and Vines and fig trees and
[30:45] pomegranates a land of olive oil and
[30:47] honey
[30:48] a land wherein Thou shalt eat bread
[30:51] without scarceness thou shalt not lack
[30:54] anything in it a land whose stones are
[30:57] iron and out of whose Hills thou mayest
[30:59] dig brass
[31:02] when thou shalt when thou Hast eaten and
[31:05] Artful then Thou shalt bless the Lord
[31:07] thy God for the good land which he hath
[31:10] given thee
[31:12] so
[31:14] those scriptures are very touching to me
[31:18] right now having just been back I think
[31:21] for sister Kerry and I both right now
[31:23] our head is spinning we can scarcely
[31:26] take in everything we've seen
[31:28] in nine days on a bus with 40 believers
[31:32] well a total of 40. and a quite a lovely
[31:36] man he's a a secular Jew who was our
[31:40] guide
[31:41] but very full of knowledge and a very
[31:44] just a delightful person
[31:47] and uh in nine days on a bus
[31:51] we we kind of hunkered down in four
[31:55] different areas
[31:57] um first at the Sea of Galilee that's
[32:00] where our first hotel was Carrie and I
[32:02] got there three days early we spent
[32:03] three lovely days in Netanya and brother
[32:05] Paul met us and sister Jerry about a day
[32:08] and a half later
[32:09] but um
[32:11] so the Sea of Galilee was our first tour
[32:14] Hotel then on down to the Dead Sea
[32:18] and then eventually to Jerusalem
[32:20] and um
[32:22] we saw about 42 sites
[32:26] and many of them biblical sites now
[32:29] brother George
[32:31] um
[32:32] he really tried to encourage us to not
[32:35] be upset with the Catholics
[32:37] because
[32:40] they have preserved these sites brother
[32:44] George says that if it were up to the
[32:46] Protestants or some of the locals there
[32:48] there would be no sites to see
[32:51] so we can at least thank the Catholics
[32:53] that they have preserved these sites
[32:55] and so not to undermine brother George
[32:58] because I do I actually appreciated that
[33:00] after he said that I'm glad he did
[33:02] but um
[33:04] uh
[33:06] unfortunately
[33:08] many of these sites that we would love
[33:09] to see raw and end their
[33:13] crude form as the way not only Christ
[33:16] but Peter and you know Elijah and many
[33:20] of the the different locations we went
[33:22] to were Joshua crossed the river and
[33:24] such
[33:26] it would be nice if we could just see
[33:27] them the way they were
[33:29] and there is a Catholic a Catholic
[33:32] stigma kind of on everything I don't
[33:34] want to discourage anybody if you'd love
[33:36] to go I think you should it was a an
[33:39] amazing experience
[33:41] but I can't go into every detail of
[33:44] every place we saw because
[33:47] first of all as Carrie and I compiled
[33:50] this list of these 42-ish sites that we
[33:53] went to and I have to give Kerry a great
[33:56] deal of credit because she was diligent
[33:58] every day to journal everything that we
[34:02] had seen so we referred to that journal
[34:04] a lot when we started compiling this
[34:07] list so we could kind of keep things
[34:09] straight in our minds
[34:10] you'd be surprised on day four of a day
[34:13] nine trip or like where have we been
[34:16] uh well we uh let's see you know and
[34:20] you're kind of Soo
[34:24] but some of the more touching
[34:27] areas that we got to see is my five
[34:30] minutes up yet give us your height
[34:33] we all went across the Sea of Galilee
[34:36] and um
[34:37] that day was really kind of Cloudy and
[34:40] as we did
[34:43] um it was just a really nice time it was
[34:45] cool there was just a just lovely little
[34:48] boat
[34:49] that held the 40
[34:52] plus yair and George I think there was
[34:54] maybe 42 of us and the crew of this
[34:57] little vessel
[34:58] and then brother George asked if you
[35:01] know he arranged with the crew if we
[35:03] could just stop the boat and he played
[35:04] some brother Branham we listened to
[35:06] maybe 20 25 minutes of brother Branham
[35:10] and my did it set an atmosphere
[35:13] it was really amazing brother Brandon
[35:16] was just telling stories about being on
[35:18] the Sea of Galilee and Peter meeting
[35:20] Jesus and
[35:22] and uh
[35:24] afterward I can say the Holy Ghost fell
[35:28] on that little boat
[35:31] we had just glass like Sea and the sun
[35:34] was setting and it was very cool
[35:37] and the Saints as you know brothers and
[35:39] sisters we've all experienced just the
[35:41] love that we feel for each other
[35:43] and that was an amazing amazing
[35:45] experience
[35:47] also let me just
[35:48] state that one of the most
[35:53] significant things impacting
[35:56] things for me
[35:59] it's wonderful to see those sites it
[36:01] truly is but what's even greater in part
[36:04] of the reason I read this scripture is
[36:07] to see how the Lord is working today
[36:11] in these promises he has kept
[36:15] to see the Israelites
[36:19] their military we got to visit one of
[36:21] their military sites and
[36:23] formidable you guys
[36:27] these young soldiers carrying m4s and
[36:32] who are delightful people to speak to
[36:35] and they have a lot to be proud about
[36:39] another site we went to was just a
[36:41] garden where I'm not sure of the whole
[36:44] story I believe it was a Ukrainian
[36:46] family that actually decided you know
[36:49] we're gonna we're going to take this
[36:53] piece of land that's kind of between Tel
[36:55] Aviv and Jerusalem
[36:57] and we're going to plant all of the
[37:02] different fruits and vegetation that are
[37:05] mentioned in the Bible
[37:07] and in many cases brothers and sisters
[37:10] these places in natural they don't grow
[37:13] together
[37:15] you don't find this anywhere in the
[37:17] world except Israel
[37:19] Israel where you find this Lebanese
[37:21] Cedar right next to a date palm tree
[37:25] and pomegranates growing and this family
[37:28] who did this some 75-ish years ago and
[37:31] of course the sun took it over and made
[37:34] it into what it is today and yair really
[37:37] shined in this area he was very
[37:39] knowledgeable about all these plants and
[37:41] he has a very good understanding even as
[37:44] a secular Jew of the scriptures and so
[37:47] showing and demonstrating how all of
[37:50] these things and how God has kept his
[37:52] word and brother George was diligent
[37:54] throughout that the reason
[37:56] all these things are taking place is
[37:59] because they were prophesied it was thus
[38:02] saith the Lord and now today it's
[38:04] amazing to see
[38:06] that Israel is is
[38:09] blooming a blooming flower and it's it's
[38:13] delightful to see
[38:15] I'll stop right there brothers and
[38:16] sisters I appreciate this opportunity
[38:18] but uh if you ever get a chance
[38:21] go to Israel
[38:23] God bless you all
[38:26] all right
[38:28] I was just warming him up for
[38:31] dinner dates
[38:33] all right
[38:34] so you have a lot of dinner dates
[38:39] praise the Lord

[42:01] and so God bless you brother Trevor
[42:03] sister Carrie we've been there we know

[42:17] Dove appeared above us in the cloud
[42:19] such a presence

[42:24] talking about I can feel it already
[42:25] right now

[42:33] amen
[42:34] I know you've come back change we did
[42:38] nobody can express
[42:40] yes there's a lot of other things but to
[42:44] know you were walking on the very ground
[42:45] that Jesus Christ did the word made
[42:47] flesh now here he is in Bride form
[42:50] walking on the same ground the word made
[42:53] flesh
[42:56] that's enough to make me shout the roof
[42:59] off if you want to know
[43:01] I don't want to take any more time I'm
[43:03] starting a little bit here late and I
[43:05] want to
[43:06] title this again as we take the word if
[43:09] you'll stand with me
[43:11] the white Throne judgment part three

[43:21] and give me your undivided attention
[43:23] don't that doesn't mean stop drawing

[43:30] preach
[43:31] so so it's just God knows all things and
[43:35] he's in control
[43:36] and I want to be submitted completely to
[43:39] him and stop where I should stop

[44:01] encourage you to get or when I
[44:02] ministered last Wednesday that was on
[44:06] I don't know I was the 30th
[44:08] and get that message because these
[44:11] things all go together
[44:13] and I I can't go back and reiterate
[44:15] everything and this is taken out of the
[44:18] Smyrna or not summer and Sardis Church
[44:21] age
[44:22] and at the at the at the beginning of it
[44:25] it's it's on the promise to the
[44:28] overcomer and it goes right on to the
[44:30] end so if you want to read it and can
[44:32] read it I suggest you will and let God
[44:35] speak to your hearts amen because it
[44:37] Blends every I had you can't take
[44:39] everything it's all over the message
[44:40] just everywhere
[44:42] I spent all day yesterday going through
[44:45] quotes saying Lord how do I break this
[44:48] down
[44:51] I just stepped on the scene
[44:54] this is the way I want it
[44:58] I answer to nobody here
[45:00] I'm answering to God for what I can be
[45:03] I'm saying
[45:05] and God knows I have nothing but Divine
[45:07] love for you and I trust you have the
[45:10] same for me
[45:12] because I speak the truth
[45:15] there's someone going to receive the
[45:17] truth
[45:19] the bride speaks the truth
[45:22] amen
[45:23] okay turn with me to to your Bibles to
[45:26] Revelations 20.
[45:29] and before we
[45:31] well I'll take the scripture and then
[45:32] I'll come back to a few things here my
[45:35] subject under this part 3 a is names
[45:39] blotted out this is a very hard subject
[45:42] to preach
[45:43] but it's a very needed subject to preach
[45:49] name splotted out or other words we re
[45:52] we are are speaking of removed from The
[45:55] Book of Life
[46:00] these that are removed are borderline
[46:03] Christians we're talking about
[46:05] borderline Christians
[46:08] the seed of discrepancy
[46:11] their name is on the book but then
[46:13] blotted out removed
[46:16] Revelations 20 11 which we've read at
[46:18] the start of this through 15 and I saw a
[46:21] great white Throne judgment or excuse me
[46:24] I saw a great white throne in him that
[46:26] sat on it from whose face the earth and
[46:29] the heaven fled away and there was found
[46:31] no place for them
[46:33] and I saw the dead small and great stand
[46:36] before God this is the second
[46:38] Resurrection after the second
[46:40] resurrection and the books were opened
[46:43] the books
[46:44] here
[46:45] are
[46:47] is of your life the books is the record
[46:50] of your life
[46:52] so everyone that stands before there
[46:55] everyone that stands Before the Throne
[46:58] to be judged come up at the second
[46:59] Resurrection those books were opened and
[47:02] the record of their life was absolutely
[47:04] opened
[47:06] foreign
[47:07] it's the book of your life
[47:10] and the books were opened then another
[47:13] book was opened which is The Book of
[47:15] Life Now not
[47:17] not
[47:18] plural their books books its book of
[47:22] life and only names are therein names
[47:24] are persons
[47:26] and
[47:28] and the dead were judged out of those
[47:30] things which were written in the books
[47:33] so there's their works there's their
[47:35] life everything is wide open I've
[47:37] already covered all that so I won't try
[47:39] to and according and they're at the
[47:41] written in the books according to their
[47:43] works
[47:45] so their Works had to match if their
[47:48] names in The Book of Life their Works
[47:50] had to match that book and the Book of
[47:52] Life Is The Word
[47:54] has to be found in the word amen
[47:58] amen
[48:00] and the Sea gave up the dead Witcher in
[48:02] it second resurrection and the death and
[48:04] Hell gave up the dead which were in them
[48:06] and they were judged every man according
[48:09] to their works
[48:10] and death and hell were cast into the
[48:13] Lake of Fire this is the second death
[48:17] and whosoever was not found written in
[48:20] the book singular of life
[48:23] was cast into the Lake of Fire
[48:27] you may be seated
[48:29] have other scriptures
[48:33] to blot brother Brandon used the word
[48:35] blot and the and the and the brother
[48:38] bran and the scriptures also use the
[48:40] word blot because in the scripture found
[48:42] in in Revelations 3 and 5 it says he
[48:47] that overcometh the same shall be
[48:49] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[48:51] blot out his name out of the book of
[48:54] life but I will confess his name before
[48:56] my father and his only angels
[48:59] brother Brown said he that overcometh
[49:01] referring to the scripture again
[49:03] paragraph 101 he that overcometh I will
[49:06] not blot now when I say paragraph
[49:08] numbers I'm using Brother George's
[49:10] book here okay so if you wonder where
[49:13] the paragraph numbers I do that for
[49:15] those online and greetings to those that
[49:17] are in line God bless you welcome
[49:20] this morning amen
[49:22] and I say welcome to every one of us
[49:24] amen because we're here now in the
[49:26] presence of the king
[49:28] I hope you're aware of that
[49:30] you're not in the presence of a man a
[49:33] preacher you're in the presence of the
[49:34] king of kings
[49:36] amen and he I believe is going to speak
[49:40] and does speak through the same voice of
[49:43] his seventh angel speaks to the same
[49:45] that voice speaks through the ministry
[49:47] today of the fivefold ministry
[49:50] amen we're all going to stand at that
[49:53] time all will be there
[49:55] there will be some standing before the
[49:57] judgment and a bride standing in
[49:59] judgment
[50:01] of them amen so we're all going to be
[50:04] there at that place
[50:06] it's going to be a final disposition
[50:09] of the whole thing after that the books
[50:12] are sealed that's it
[50:15] amen all right so we're so now we're why
[50:18] are you bringing this in this hour
[50:19] because we're very close the bride's so
[50:22] close of leaving
[50:24] remember the Gentiles are finished then
[50:28] are you with me
[50:29] it turns completely to Israel
[50:33] amen that's why they're in their land
[50:35] that's why they're prospering
[50:40] he said it would return that way
[50:42] and we see scriptures being fulfilled my
[50:45] my and if you really are in the message
[50:48] of the hour and feeding on the word and
[50:49] feeding on the message I took those both
[50:51] the same you know
[50:55] you must have your Bible in this message
[50:57] must go together
[50:59] and you're never going to understand
[51:00] what the Bible's saying of this day
[51:02] unless you come through the
[51:03] interpretation of God using a prophet to
[51:05] interpret his word you'll never do it
[51:08] you can have all the words you want but
[51:10] you'll never come to the revelation of
[51:12] this without hearing what a prophet has
[51:13] said what God has said to a prophet and
[51:16] what God has said to the prophet the
[51:17] bride will say the same thing right
[51:21] amen so so you see we're we're in a
[51:25] we're in a real
[51:27] position
[51:30] today at this time
[51:32] we're at the end
[51:33] how many realize we're at the end the
[51:35] prophet said we've arrived the Seven
[51:37] Seals
[51:39] defined that that we have arrived we are
[51:42] at the end of time we're not the end we
[51:44] say the end the end we don't know when
[51:46] that day will be for the Gentiles but
[51:49] that day of the Resurrection but we're
[51:51] at the end and it's this and no other
[51:53] age to follow
[51:55] we are in the grain time
[51:58] amen we're in the bride time Jesus
[52:00] Christ in Bride form time
[52:06] okay I won't want to get to preaching if
[52:07] I don't I won't get finished what I want
[52:10] to do today
[52:11] I say what the Lord would have us to do
[52:14] so
[52:16] I want to take this and so I've just
[52:18] read here where he said he said and he
[52:21] that overcometh I will not blot out his
[52:23] name out of the book of life and brother
[52:25] Graham said we come to a most difficult
[52:27] portion of the word
[52:30] because God has before the foundation of
[52:33] the world written not now no names being
[52:36] written now the old statement is when a
[52:38] a son or daughter is born of God the
[52:41] name put on the book no it isn't it was
[52:42] put on the book before the foundation of
[52:44] the world
[52:46] amen through the sovereignty and you've
[52:48] got to realize God is Sovereign how he
[52:50] wants to you but he has his
[52:52] foreknowledge and we were and those that
[52:54] were in him were written down his elect
[52:57] before the foundation of the world in a
[52:59] section of This Book of Life the book of
[53:01] life and the land Book of Life is the
[53:03] same book
[53:05] and the bride
[53:07] section is another record in that book
[53:11] and if you want to go to that first John
[53:12] chapter 5 verse 10-12 and this is the
[53:16] record
[53:18] Revelation 10 2 he held that little book
[53:20] that record in his in his hand was
[53:22] sealed with Seven Seals
[53:24] amen and so we see then that without
[53:28] being on that record and God Knows by
[53:30] foreknowledge who's on that record and
[53:32] already put them on it he put Judas in
[53:35] the book of life chose him
[53:37] but his name was blotted we'll cover
[53:40] that later on
[53:41] taken away
[53:42] and the reason why and God wants you to
[53:45] know the reason why these names are
[53:46] removed I went back on the last time we
[53:49] ministered and took took to you showed
[53:51] you there's going to be righteous ones
[53:55] amen and why they were righteous and why
[53:58] they were given life
[54:00] now some of you weren't here and I
[54:02] suggest you if you're going to get the
[54:03] whole picture you'll want you to go back
[54:05] and listen to that not that I'm wanting
[54:06] to hear you hear me preach but if you're
[54:09] going to if you're interested in hearing
[54:11] what is being said go back and hear the
[54:13] rest of it the rest of the story
[54:16] all right
[54:17] so blotting to blot something in
[54:20] scriptures to blot out of the book of
[54:22] life is to reject him from the number
[54:27] of those who are to rejecting from the
[54:30] number of those who are to be saved
[54:32] remember there's going to be those that
[54:33] the white through judgment given life
[54:36] on a basis and I won't go into detail
[54:39] how they were but it's based on their
[54:41] works that were found in the scripture
[54:42] we went and covered those scriptures but
[54:45] they were also righteous
[54:47] so there's righteous ones besides the
[54:49] bride that are at the Judgment that will
[54:52] be given life based
[54:55] on being good to the people of God the
[54:58] bride
[55:00] amen
[55:01] amen all right now so blot to blot out a
[55:05] name a person or a nation is to destroy
[55:08] the person or Nation to exterminate or
[55:10] consume
[55:14] now we want to look at this
[55:17] I want to take another
[55:20] description here which I'm going to go
[55:22] into and I've already said the
[55:25] borderline Christians the subject is the
[55:28] name removed from the book and these are
[55:30] the borderline Christians and the seed
[55:32] of discrepancy
[55:35] now discrepancy means a deviation I'm
[55:37] taking this now from the King James
[55:39] dictionary there's a dictionary of the
[55:42] King James meaning of words and you can
[55:44] take it whatever you want but I'm going
[55:46] to come to what brother Branham said and
[55:48] I'd rather take his definition than any
[55:49] others but it goes with that and so
[55:52] discrepancy is a deviation because I
[55:54] believe the way God interpreted his
[55:57] these words and put them and interpret
[55:59] the scripture we have no right to add to
[56:01] or take away what that Prophet said
[56:03] about it
[56:06] or put your interpretation or your
[56:08] opinion to it to do so if you're not
[56:11] careful you better watch out because
[56:12] your name can be easily removed
[56:16] amen
[56:18] so you must take word by word
[56:20] don't you put your thought to it
[56:24] you do what he says do
[56:26] because it was disobedience is the
[56:28] reason these things were blotted
[56:31] amen all right now so a deviation of
[56:34] discrepancy is the deviation the action
[56:36] of departing from an established course
[56:38] or accepted standard
[56:44] our standard the bride standard
[56:48] is the word
[56:50] the seed of God's
[56:53] absolute
[56:55] see the seed of God's absolute that the
[56:59] that's the bride's standard the word is
[57:02] the seed of God's absolute
[57:05] in other words the word is this you and
[57:08] I
[57:09] I believe I'm seed it's revealed to me
[57:12] that I'm a seed of God
[57:15] so the the seed of God's absolute
[57:19] is the word
[57:21] because that is the seed all right they
[57:23] can't deny that see that is the seed
[57:26] so
[57:27] that's the bride's standard
[57:31] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[57:33] Holy Ghost will raise a standard what
[57:35] does he raise up
[57:36] imagination reasoning conscience no he
[57:39] raises up his word
[57:42] amen amen okay now so so I standard and
[57:46] so a discrepancy also is a variance
[57:49] or variation
[57:51] and it's a lack of compatibility
[57:53] compatibility
[57:56] with what the word
[58:00] amen it doesn't take very much Eve
[58:03] disbelieved one word and and caused
[58:05] every every death every dying baby every
[58:09] ambulance everything that could be evil
[58:12] it came through that woman
[58:14] and that's what started this seed of
[58:17] discrepancy this idolatry this is that
[58:21] is that fornication which is idolatry
[58:26] to begin right there where to carry
[58:28] through we see it we we see it carried
[58:31] right through and the sons of God cess
[58:33] line Seth chose the word which was the
[58:35] seed but then to begin to mix
[58:39] and saw the daughters of man not
[58:40] Daughters of God
[58:43] amen
[58:45] and cause the fornication and went into
[58:47] idolatry and God had to wipe the whole
[58:49] thing in Noah's day
[58:52] are you with me
[58:54] all right
[58:56] this this is a as I said this is a very
[58:59] touchy subject but it has to be
[59:01] ministered in this hour
[59:04] okay now
[59:06] so it's it's so and brother Branham says
[59:09] and it means it's sowing Discord
[59:11] discrepancy is sowing Discord now God
[59:15] hates it
[59:17] if you'd like to if you just turn with
[59:18] me over to Salt Proverbs what didn't
[59:22] know if I'd read this or not but I'm
[59:23] going to read it proverbs 6.
[59:27] Proverbs 6
[59:29] no yeah six right and and uh verse 16.
[59:35] starting with verse 16. These six six
[59:40] things does the Lord hate yea seven are
[59:44] an Abomination unto him
[59:47] a heart that devises Wicked imaginations
[59:51] excuse me a proud look it's number one
[59:53] number one proud look a lying tongue and
[59:56] hands that shed innocent blood
[59:59] a heart that deviseth Wicked
[1:00:01] imaginations
[1:00:03] feet that be Swift in running to
[1:00:05] mischief
[1:00:08] you watch all this comes right down the
[1:00:10] Discord
[1:00:11] all right
[1:00:13] a false witness that speaketh lies and
[1:00:16] he that soweth Discord among brethren
[1:00:22] all right that's pretty straight that's
[1:00:24] pretty pretty strict isn't it all right
[1:00:26] brother Brown said sowing Discord
[1:00:29] this excuse me discrepancy means a
[1:00:31] sowing a a sewing Discord or being
[1:00:35] contrary
[1:00:38] Webster says sowing a Discord something
[1:00:41] different or being contrary to what's
[1:00:43] already been
[1:00:46] you can't change God God doesn't change
[1:00:50] all right you can't come along and say
[1:00:52] well we have a brand new thing no Jesus
[1:00:54] Christ is the same yesterday and today
[1:00:56] and forever he doesn't change his
[1:00:59] Revelation brother Brown said he can add
[1:01:01] to it but he never changes the
[1:01:03] revelation
[1:01:04] right and so he's he's brought us more
[1:01:07] light on the same Revelation at the
[1:01:09] opening of these seals this message has
[1:01:11] done this
[1:01:14] all right so it so it means variance
[1:01:18] it's a variance it's opposition
[1:01:21] contention and strife it's a clashing
[1:01:26] a clashing is Discord
[1:01:29] now that's a big word and brother Brown
[1:01:31] speaks much about how what clashes
[1:01:34] together
[1:01:36] when the carnal and spiritual come
[1:01:38] together there's always a Clash
[1:01:42] amen you have that every day you're in
[1:01:44] you're alive and awakened you have a
[1:01:47] clash what's clashing your own carnal
[1:01:50] thinking to what's inside your soul The
[1:01:52] Living Word
[1:01:54] Brother Brad said which voice are you
[1:01:55] going to listen to
[1:01:57] here's the promise the outside man says
[1:02:00] that's not for you
[1:02:02] the inside man says it is now which one
[1:02:05] you're going to take
[1:02:07] so he said let go of the outside man and
[1:02:09] take the Inside Man
[1:02:12] I was talking to born-again believers do
[1:02:14] you have that Clash
[1:02:17] sure you do every day Jesus said if
[1:02:19] you're going to follow me you have to
[1:02:21] deny yourself
[1:02:22] take up your cross and follow me
[1:02:26] all right so
[1:02:29] let's go over here
[1:02:31] brother Branham says this
[1:02:35] I preach here sometime to go on the
[1:02:37] disappointments at the Judgment I said
[1:02:39] The Bootlegger The Gambler The
[1:02:40] Prostitute and so forth they will be
[1:02:42] surprised they know what's coming to
[1:02:44] them and what's going to be and what's
[1:02:46] going to be the surprise is that is
[1:02:49] those fellows who thinks who thinks he's
[1:02:52] right and not
[1:02:53] that's when you see your name is not on
[1:02:56] the book that's what it's going to be
[1:02:58] hard when you think you're a Christian
[1:03:00] when you're not there's a way that
[1:03:03] seemeth right you believe intellectually
[1:03:06] that you are right you've done the right
[1:03:09] things that you thought was right you've
[1:03:12] been good you've been kind and we play
[1:03:15] with it we tamper with it with what
[1:03:19] we play with it we tamper with it and
[1:03:22] just Petty around with it and never get
[1:03:24] right into it what the truth
[1:03:27] the message
[1:03:30] the word
[1:03:32] the message is the word opened without
[1:03:36] the opening of the word there is no body
[1:03:38] change for you
[1:03:42] without the word opening in you
[1:03:45] without the opening of the word without
[1:03:46] the revelation of the word
[1:03:49] without the operation of the word
[1:03:54] we're not playing with this
[1:03:56] this is this is between death and life
[1:04:01] it takes the opening of the word to put
[1:04:04] you in your position in place
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:08] all right now so there's where so many
[1:04:11] people today is going to be so terribly
[1:04:13] disappointed at the day of judgment he
[1:04:16] said today and we want to remember
[1:04:18] everything that's being judged in the
[1:04:21] judgment
[1:04:22] is happening to you now
[1:04:24] other words other words what I'm trying
[1:04:26] to say is if whatever you are now and
[1:04:29] whatever you're is what you're going to
[1:04:31] be there
[1:04:33] Now's the Time to make things right you
[1:04:35] can't get it right there
[1:04:37] you're not going to have opportunity to
[1:04:40] to well Lord I'm sorry no there's not
[1:04:42] going to be that
[1:04:44] is going to be forgiveness
[1:04:47] your works are happening now you're
[1:04:49] portraying what you are now right now in
[1:04:52] this hour in this time that you're alive
[1:04:53] here on this Earth
[1:04:55] so we must make sure not take an
[1:04:57] imagination we must be sure where we're
[1:04:59] standing
[1:05:02] you must be know that you met Christ
[1:05:04] don't take it because you imagine you
[1:05:06] have don't take it because you hope you
[1:05:08] have you got to have a no-so it's got to
[1:05:11] be a revelation in your soul that you
[1:05:13] have
[1:05:17] he said I'll build my church Upon This
[1:05:20] Rock of the revelation of who I am and
[1:05:22] the Gates of Hell will prevail against
[1:05:23] it
[1:05:25] you've got to have that the new birth is
[1:05:27] that opening of that word in you who is
[1:05:29] it Jesus Christ in you
[1:05:33] amen all right so he said that's where
[1:05:37] there's so many people is going to be so
[1:05:39] disappointed the day of judgment today
[1:05:41] he said today is to know that they've
[1:05:43] lived in church to know that they've
[1:05:45] done good deeds to know that they have
[1:05:47] treated their neighbor nothing can be
[1:05:48] said about good deeds and those things
[1:05:49] that's all right we believe in Good
[1:05:51] Deeds but you can have good deeds and
[1:05:53] still not be that now watch what he says
[1:05:55] treat their neighbor right to know that
[1:05:57] they have been loyal to the people loyal
[1:05:59] to the church
[1:06:00] and in their mind they believe that
[1:06:02] Jesus Christ
[1:06:05] and in their mind have believed that
[1:06:07] Jesus Christ the son of God and be
[1:06:10] condemned
[1:06:13] at the day of judgment
[1:06:16] amen
[1:06:18] all right remember these ones that were
[1:06:20] given life had done those deeds didn't
[1:06:22] even know they were doing it
[1:06:26] those righteous ones that were given
[1:06:28] eternal life that the Judgment did not
[1:06:30] know that they gave him a drink and and
[1:06:32] met him when he was in hospital and did
[1:06:34] those things I had something happen just
[1:06:36] here the other day that absolutely took
[1:06:39] place that I that fulfilled I just after
[1:06:41] I preached that on Wednesday something
[1:06:43] happened I said There It Is
[1:06:48] didn't know what they were doing they
[1:06:49] didn't know they met the word but it was
[1:06:51] already positioned in their heart to do
[1:06:54] what they did
[1:06:55] and who who determined that the Lord
[1:06:57] determined that when their name was put
[1:06:59] on The Book of Life
[1:07:04] to be receive eternal life
[1:07:06] at that day
[1:07:08] see they already did something here they
[1:07:11] don't do it over there they do it here
[1:07:14] amen
[1:07:16] they will help remember that well I'll
[1:07:18] go into that a little bit later here
[1:07:19] I'll get ahead of myself all right now
[1:07:21] Jesus said many are called and few are
[1:07:23] chosen straight is the gate and narrow
[1:07:26] is the way that leads to life and but
[1:07:28] few there be that find it
[1:07:33] so many can be called but there's few
[1:07:35] chosen
[1:07:37] amen no man he said can come to me
[1:07:39] except my father draws him and all that
[1:07:41] the father has given me will come
[1:07:44] now you didn't have anything to do with
[1:07:46] that you weren't looking for him you
[1:07:48] were the elected that God chose in his
[1:07:50] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:07:52] and you cannot be lost
[1:07:55] because you always were a part of him
[1:07:57] you were his heart purpose
[1:08:00] you were in his thoughts as substance
[1:08:02] and he spoke the word and you had to
[1:08:04] come here in this day an hour and
[1:08:06] receive that word because you cannot
[1:08:08] deny Who You Are
[1:08:10] and he can't deny you that's the elect
[1:08:16] and they come because the father Tross
[1:08:18] them they didn't have anything to do
[1:08:20] with it they were drawn by him
[1:08:24] amen so it's not a make-believer not a
[1:08:28] made-up religion
[1:08:29] it's absolutely the achievement of God
[1:08:32] through and through absolutely all the
[1:08:34] way through so don't try to get eternal
[1:08:36] life he said I go out and do good deeds
[1:08:38] and do this and try and try and try by
[1:08:40] my Works to find favor with God know
[1:08:42] it's by grace through faith
[1:08:45] faith is a revelation you can't
[1:08:49] manufacture that you can't work up
[1:08:50] enough to get that that's given you
[1:08:52] sovereignly by God
[1:08:57] amen
[1:08:59] all right
[1:09:00] now many are called and few are chosen
[1:09:03] I'd say let's brother Brown said it's
[1:09:05] not something you make up and have to do
[1:09:07] and must they think you have to do and
[1:09:09] and no he said it's just him and you
[1:09:12] living out his word
[1:09:16] a lot could be said on these little
[1:09:18] things they're all little messages but I
[1:09:20] I just got to continue on here with this
[1:09:22] all right
[1:09:24] and few that said now and I don't know
[1:09:26] how many few I pray that everyone in
[1:09:28] here makes the bride
[1:09:31] I don't know it's none of my business to
[1:09:33] know who few and who isn't few I don't
[1:09:35] know only but God does know where you're
[1:09:38] standing today and does know your heart
[1:09:39] and knows your motive and objectives you
[1:09:41] couldn't hide from him if you wanted to
[1:09:43] we already know that's been Vindicated
[1:09:45] to us
[1:09:48] that word is the discerner
[1:09:52] and the word going out right now will
[1:09:54] discern hearts
[1:09:56] and the bride will hear the word
[1:10:00] for she has an ear to receive to hear
[1:10:03] the word of God and receive it for her
[1:10:06] day and her season
[1:10:08] I don't know who that is
[1:10:10] Ministry preaches the word I'm not
[1:10:13] responsible for how you react to it
[1:10:17] how if he could get it or don't get it
[1:10:19] that's not my responsibility that's
[1:10:22] God's responsibility my responsibility
[1:10:24] is spread it
[1:10:27] every day I live I'm here to spread it
[1:10:30] you're here to spread it no matter what
[1:10:33] part you have in the body if you're born
[1:10:34] again that little portion cannot it's
[1:10:37] not bigger little portions it's
[1:10:39] absolutely God's portion it's his
[1:10:41] portion it's his doing it's his thoughts
[1:10:44] in action
[1:10:48] amen all right now the people here this
[1:10:51] morning I want you to set up and take
[1:10:53] notice of this you're old enough now
[1:10:55] you've heard enough gospel preaching
[1:10:57] till you ought to be able to get off of
[1:10:59] milk
[1:11:01] and come to a real solid gospel diet
[1:11:04] come to a place where men and women
[1:11:06] ought to stand
[1:11:08] Paul said when you ought to be teachers
[1:11:12] why you have to be taught yet
[1:11:16] he said let's go on to Perfection let's
[1:11:19] leave these little principles
[1:11:21] amen principles are okay this will do if
[1:11:24] God's so desire or so permit but let's
[1:11:28] go on Perfection I'm gonna I don't even
[1:11:30] know if I'll get to that I have Hebrews
[1:11:31] six I gotta bring out but I don't know
[1:11:33] if I'll get there but let's let's see
[1:11:36] this they have to come into Wednesday
[1:11:40] the Revelation I want you to go with me
[1:11:42] to Revelations 22.
[1:11:45] verse 8.
[1:11:47] I have to really watch here because I
[1:11:48] little Marks here that I
[1:11:52] have written down
[1:12:02] let me just look at something here
[1:12:10] yeah I think I made that clear to come
[1:12:11] today when all stand together as seen in
[1:12:13] Daniel 7 that's speaking of the same
[1:12:15] thing we just read in Revelation 20.
[1:12:20] the king will be there with his bride
[1:12:22] and in front of them will be multitudes
[1:12:25] multitudes who are to be judged yes all
[1:12:27] are there all books are open books and a
[1:12:31] final disposition of all is made
[1:12:34] amen at the Harvest indeed is over
[1:12:40] amen all right so
[1:12:43] Revelations 20 2 verse 8.
[1:12:52] and I John
[1:12:54] now John is the type of the Bride how
[1:12:57] many know that
[1:12:58] so I want you to position you are
[1:13:01] positioned in the Book of Revelation
[1:13:02] because the Book of Revelation is the
[1:13:05] full complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:13:09] amen
[1:13:10] all right
[1:13:13] and so I John saw these things what he
[1:13:16] saw he was commanded to write what he
[1:13:18] saw et cetera et cetera you know and
[1:13:19] heard them and when I had heard and seen
[1:13:22] I fell down to worship before the feet
[1:13:25] of the angel
[1:13:28] which showed me these things now I'm not
[1:13:31] afraid to tell you that angel happened
[1:13:32] to be that Prophet that stood before us
[1:13:35] in this hour that had the revelation of
[1:13:37] those seven sealed given to him the
[1:13:38] sword of the King was put in his hands
[1:13:40] and the King set forth and roared like a
[1:13:43] lion and seven Thunders uttered their
[1:13:44] voices which was the Mysteries contained
[1:13:47] in those seals revelation of those
[1:13:49] things contained in those seals
[1:13:54] I'm not ashamed to tell you that was the
[1:13:57] prophet that he went right to
[1:13:59] and bowed was going to bow at his feet
[1:14:03] right I wonder if we can see our
[1:14:05] self-identified in the scripture here
[1:14:08] all right now 9 verse 9 he showed me
[1:14:13] these things he said who was it God or
[1:14:15] the man no God did the messenger Angels
[1:14:18] the messenger
[1:14:19] all right then saith he unto me watch
[1:14:24] this messenger see thou do it not don't
[1:14:26] bow at my feet
[1:14:27] for I am thy fellow servant how many
[1:14:31] know that that's exactly the attitude
[1:14:33] our Prophet had
[1:14:35] yes never never will you find brother
[1:14:38] Branham exalting himself never he always
[1:14:41] pointed us right to Jesus Christ friends
[1:14:44] it's Jesus Christ that's in your midst
[1:14:46] who is this you say it friends it's
[1:14:48] Jesus Christ in your midst he said I can
[1:14:51] do nothing I'm waiting on him
[1:14:55] and now here he is in Bride form the
[1:14:57] same son of man is revealing himself as
[1:14:59] he promised to in this hour in a bride
[1:15:01] coming of himself it has to have that
[1:15:04] happen to fulfill the full revelation
[1:15:11] amen and the full Revelation and the
[1:15:14] opening of that word is the third pull
[1:15:18] and Satan cannot receive that
[1:15:21] neither can anyone else besides the
[1:15:23] bride
[1:15:25] I don't care it's you I believe in being
[1:15:27] good you could have all kinds that you
[1:15:29] can be good you can have every picture
[1:15:30] on the wall of brother Branham you can
[1:15:32] have all the tapes you want you can have
[1:15:33] all of that and still be lost
[1:15:39] now we're going to come to that I said
[1:15:41] this is not an easy message to preach
[1:15:43] but we're going to come down and lay it
[1:15:44] on the line
[1:15:45] can you do anything what are you going
[1:15:48] to do you're gonna if if you're one of
[1:15:50] his
[1:15:53] that word's got to come alive and open
[1:15:55] in you
[1:16:00] and it's not your guesswork you know
[1:16:02] where you're standing and you will not
[1:16:04] be flirting with these other things and
[1:16:07] trying to mix this message with other
[1:16:09] things
[1:16:10] because that Spirit of denominationalism
[1:16:13] that idolatry that that fornicating
[1:16:15] spirit is very strong is very strong and
[1:16:18] very much alive trying to infiltrate
[1:16:21] message churches
[1:16:24] right
[1:16:28] and I think if you lack discernment of
[1:16:31] that is the reason is because you need a
[1:16:33] new birth
[1:16:36] and these two spirits will be so close
[1:16:38] they will deceive even their very lack
[1:16:41] if
[1:16:42] it were possible all right now I want to
[1:16:45] keep reading here
[1:16:46] verse 9 we read okay now it says I am
[1:16:50] thy fellow servant of thy and of thy
[1:16:52] brother and the prophets and of them
[1:16:54] which keep the sayings of this book
[1:16:55] worship God
[1:16:57] verse 10 he saith unto me he says
[1:16:59] worship God who keep the sayings of this
[1:17:02] book worship God I'm of thy brother and
[1:17:04] the prophets and of them who's them
[1:17:08] you and I
[1:17:10] are portions of them
[1:17:12] amen that worship God who keep thus
[1:17:15] excuse me who keep the sayings of this
[1:17:17] book
[1:17:20] amen if God said it that settles it I
[1:17:24] don't have a right to put what I think
[1:17:25] upon it do what he said at Thy word Lord
[1:17:28] I'll let down the net Behold thy
[1:17:31] handmaid at Thy Word
[1:17:33] that's right
[1:17:37] amen but you want to put your
[1:17:39] interpretation to it and add something
[1:17:42] I'm going to get to that scripture I'm
[1:17:43] coming right to it
[1:17:45] all right now
[1:17:48] he said and he saith unto me same Angel
[1:17:50] seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
[1:17:53] this book see it's been unsealed don't
[1:17:54] you seal the sayings of the prophecy of
[1:17:57] this book for the time is at hand
[1:18:00] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[1:18:03] still he that's filthy let him be filthy
[1:18:06] still he that's righteous let him be
[1:18:07] righteous still and he that is Holy let
[1:18:10] him be holy still
[1:18:12] you're holy you're gonna be holy here
[1:18:14] you're righteous you can be righteous
[1:18:15] here you're filthy you'll be filthy here
[1:18:20] this word is the discerner and this word
[1:18:23] of this message of this full Revelation
[1:18:26] is a separator
[1:18:31] amen it's going to separate it's got to
[1:18:33] separate
[1:18:35] and separation is never easy because
[1:18:38] you're going to be think down upon
[1:18:39] you're going to be misunderstood because
[1:18:41] you're separated to the word
[1:18:45] amen you're going to be separated from
[1:18:47] your own carnal thinking
[1:18:52] amen
[1:18:54] amen all right now he that is unjust
[1:18:56] okay now verse 12 and behold I come
[1:18:59] quickly
[1:19:01] see behold he's saying now right behind
[1:19:04] that there's something going on then he
[1:19:06] says I come quickly and my reward is
[1:19:08] with me to give every man according to
[1:19:10] his work
[1:19:13] shall be now there there's a dual
[1:19:16] meaning in that
[1:19:17] because there's a bride will stand
[1:19:19] before him to receive reward
[1:19:22] or lack of reward
[1:19:24] but their salvation is set
[1:19:28] that's after the Rapture they're already
[1:19:29] in a raptured position meeting the Lord
[1:19:32] is well done by good and faithful
[1:19:34] servant Henry and I'm not talking about
[1:19:36] that's not the white Throne judgment
[1:19:39] that's another that is another standing
[1:19:42] before the bride stands before that
[1:19:43] throne
[1:19:45] to receive reward
[1:19:47] amen all right but that's not the one
[1:19:51] judgment we're talking about here
[1:19:52] okay
[1:19:54] blessed are they that do his
[1:19:57] Commandments hello
[1:19:59] here's the criteria blessed are they
[1:20:02] that do how can you do it without having
[1:20:05] revealed to you
[1:20:07] and how can you do it without the Holy
[1:20:10] Ghost in you to do it
[1:20:13] amen how can you do it without the Holy
[1:20:16] Spirit working through you
[1:20:18] and if something's being worked through
[1:20:20] you and just contrite the word without
[1:20:22] the Holy Spirit you won't even know it
[1:20:23] but with the Holy Spirit you will know
[1:20:25] it and you will repent and you will make
[1:20:28] it right
[1:20:29] so by your fruits you're known
[1:20:34] are you still with me
[1:20:37] amen all right so we come down here
[1:20:41] blessed are they that do his
[1:20:42] Commandments that they may have right to
[1:20:44] the tree of life and may enter in
[1:20:46] through the gates into the city
[1:20:50] the only one dwelling in the city
[1:20:51] brother sister is the bride and the
[1:20:54] groom
[1:20:57] there's many come in and out of the city
[1:20:59] but the only one that dwells in that
[1:21:00] City and is that City on that mountain
[1:21:04] that's the brighter self
[1:21:08] all right he said if or without without
[1:21:12] what the city are dogs and Sorcerers and
[1:21:16] warmongers and murderers and adulterers
[1:21:18] that goes right down here to today who's
[1:21:20] without who's without the truth those
[1:21:23] names that have never been put on The
[1:21:24] Book of Life are going to be there too
[1:21:27] you know never had their name even
[1:21:28] written anywhere
[1:21:32] such as pharaoh and such a certain one
[1:21:34] see their names weren't anywhere they
[1:21:36] were ordained to do what they did but
[1:21:37] what for what purpose to make the word
[1:21:39] of God shine
[1:21:43] that's a whole that's another portion
[1:21:45] we'll get into
[1:21:46] not today
[1:21:49] blessed are they that okay go down I
[1:21:52] Jesus
[1:21:54] see now watch see without our dogs
[1:21:56] sorcers War mongers even the Bible even
[1:21:58] the scriptures speak of dogs as being
[1:22:00] ministers
[1:22:02] and Sorcerers and more mongers and
[1:22:04] murders and idolaters and whosoever
[1:22:06] loveth and maketh a lie
[1:22:09] be careful what you imagine someone's
[1:22:11] doing and go scatter it to somebody else
[1:22:15] amen all right bless thou watch I Jesus
[1:22:19] has sent mine angel now who's speaking
[1:22:21] through that angel I Jesus has sent mine
[1:22:24] Angel to testify unto you these things
[1:22:27] in the churches I am the root and The
[1:22:31] Offspring of David he wasn't Only The
[1:22:34] Offspring of David he was the root
[1:22:37] not only are you the Are You The
[1:22:40] Offspring of him but you're in the root
[1:22:44] to begin with
[1:22:45] to be a right Branch to Bear the the
[1:22:48] orange that the tree was in the root
[1:22:49] you're gonna the true branches will bear
[1:22:51] what was in the root
[1:22:56] I am the root and offspring of David and
[1:22:59] I'm the bright and Morning Star
[1:23:02] and the spirit and the bride brother
[1:23:04] Brown said what the spirit says to the
[1:23:06] prophet the bride will say and the
[1:23:09] spirit and the bride say come
[1:23:12] and let him that heareth say come and
[1:23:15] let them deceit speak the same word same
[1:23:17] message and let him that Sarah say come
[1:23:20] and let him this thirst come and
[1:23:22] whosoever will take let whosoever will
[1:23:25] who has the will let him take the Water
[1:23:28] of Life freely
[1:23:31] you don't have to work up something to
[1:23:33] get it you don't have to manufacture
[1:23:35] something you don't have to try to be
[1:23:37] this and try to be that it's him working
[1:23:39] through you what a place brother Adam
[1:23:41] said what a place to live what a place
[1:23:44] to to relax and let off the pressure
[1:23:48] because you know that you've met him
[1:23:50] face to face inside that little room of
[1:23:53] your soul
[1:23:56] and you know where you've come from you
[1:23:58] know where who you are and you know
[1:24:00] where you're going
[1:24:02] I'm not saying it's being revealed more
[1:24:04] and more it is because we have that
[1:24:06] maturity growing into that headstone
[1:24:08] that headstone is our complete
[1:24:11] revelation of who we are and there's a
[1:24:13] bride today that will be absolutely
[1:24:15] their position is The Headstone the
[1:24:17] Capstone Ministry and without us they
[1:24:20] can't be perfect the ones before us
[1:24:24] we received the perfect ministry the
[1:24:27] message of the Capstone
[1:24:30] now you can take stature of a perfect
[1:24:32] man
[1:24:34] amen you have to be born again of the
[1:24:37] spirit to grow in that stature
[1:24:40] amen amen all right now
[1:24:45] let's take another oh go keep going
[1:24:47] verse now here comes the meat of it I
[1:24:50] wasn't going to read all that but I felt
[1:24:51] like the Lord wanted me too far I
[1:24:52] testify unto every man that heareth the
[1:24:55] words of the prophecy of this book
[1:25:00] every man every individual If any man
[1:25:03] shall add
[1:25:04] unto these things God will add unto him
[1:25:07] the plagues that are written in this
[1:25:09] book If any man shall take away from the
[1:25:12] words of the book remember these two
[1:25:13] things will go right together if any man
[1:25:16] shall take away from the words of the
[1:25:18] book of this prophecy God shall take
[1:25:20] away his part out of The Book of Life
[1:25:23] and out of the holy city now watch
[1:25:26] he already had his had his part in the
[1:25:28] book
[1:25:29] but it was taken out why because he add
[1:25:34] to or take away
[1:25:37] brother Brandon put those two things
[1:25:39] together to add to or take away
[1:25:41] is the same
[1:25:42] you add it or you take it away
[1:25:45] and he said their part is taken out of
[1:25:47] the book of life though they're in it as
[1:25:49] Judas was
[1:25:50] his part was taken out
[1:25:53] in fact he went right up and believed
[1:25:55] all the message except coming to the
[1:25:57] revelation of who he was the birth
[1:26:02] he couldn't take real Pentecost I'm not
[1:26:06] talking about your denominational Flair
[1:26:07] of Pentecost I'm talking about the real
[1:26:10] eternal life living and Abiding and
[1:26:11] dwelling in you it's not a make-believe
[1:26:13] it's not a bunch of emotion it's not a
[1:26:15] bunch of of works all those things are
[1:26:17] fine but it's a reality and revelation
[1:26:19] of himself living and you recognizing
[1:26:21] the day you're living in
[1:26:26] amen amen all right
[1:26:30] amen now let's go to Matthew 13.
[1:26:36] Matthew 13 brother Brown read this in
[1:26:39] seed of discrepancy
[1:26:41] and I want to take Matthew 13 36 and he
[1:26:44] said this was Jesus coming back and
[1:26:46] expressing what he just said to them
[1:26:48] about how sower went forth
[1:26:50] who the sower was and for the 36 then
[1:26:53] Jesus sent the multitude away
[1:26:55] and he and and went into the house into
[1:26:59] the house you have to meet him in the
[1:27:01] house
[1:27:03] you went into the house and his
[1:27:05] disciples came into him saying declare
[1:27:07] unto us the parable of the tares of the
[1:27:09] field
[1:27:11] and he answered and said unto them he
[1:27:13] that soweth the good seed is the son of
[1:27:15] man now brother Branham went back to
[1:27:17] this when he first met the Pentecostal
[1:27:19] people in Mishawaka Indiana
[1:27:22] he said I met them and I hear two men
[1:27:24] prophesy and it'd be exactly right
[1:27:27] speak in tongues and prophesy
[1:27:30] but I found one was a devil and the
[1:27:33] other was a genuine Christian
[1:27:37] how could he said the Holy Spirit be
[1:27:39] falling and it was the Holy Spirit be
[1:27:40] falling on both
[1:27:46] amen and one was a hypocrite one was a
[1:27:50] fornicator
[1:27:52] living with a woman had a child by her
[1:27:54] and had still had a wife
[1:27:57] and yet the anointing was the genuine
[1:27:59] Holy Ghost falling on that man
[1:28:02] so you see tongues and interpretation
[1:28:04] there's no evidence that you've got it
[1:28:06] in your soul at all
[1:28:11] I know this rubs the wrong way
[1:28:14] that's the absolute truth
[1:28:17] amen all right now brother Brown refers
[1:28:20] to that I know these things are deep
[1:28:22] this is not something you just lightly
[1:28:24] take
[1:28:26] all right but I'm expecting God
[1:28:29] to reveal it
[1:28:32] to those that have ears to hear
[1:28:34] all right now so he said so he goes on
[1:28:38] to verse 37.
[1:28:40] they wanted to declare the Terrors of
[1:28:42] the field and he answered and said unto
[1:28:44] them he that soweth good seed to the son
[1:28:46] of man I want you to notice that went
[1:28:47] first
[1:28:50] remember in the vision he saw the son of
[1:28:52] man going around first sowing seed upon
[1:28:55] the Earth the Earth was the world the
[1:28:56] Earth
[1:28:58] okay in our day there's a sower went
[1:29:00] forth to sow the son of man went forth
[1:29:02] to sow the messenger of the hour is the
[1:29:04] son of man not the prophet the son of
[1:29:07] man he was revealing he was used to
[1:29:09] reveal the son of man you're not feeding
[1:29:11] on the bot on the on a man you are
[1:29:13] feeding on the body word of the son of
[1:29:16] man that's the carcass of our day
[1:29:20] there you'll find the Eagles are
[1:29:22] gathered where the word for the season
[1:29:24] is being preached the Eagles will
[1:29:26] gathered will gather right we're old
[1:29:29] Pentecostal brother Brown said we have
[1:29:31] gone beyond speaking in tongues
[1:29:33] countdown 1964. we're beyond that
[1:29:39] so if you use that as an I believe we
[1:29:41] speak in tongue don't get me wrong
[1:29:42] anything God put in the body but that's
[1:29:44] not that that is not the evidence of
[1:29:46] today that is not
[1:29:48] that is not the emphasis
[1:29:51] the emphasis is the revealing of the son
[1:29:54] of man in the bride form
[1:29:58] ah
[1:29:59] Hallelujah
[1:30:01] that's it because here the son of man is
[1:30:04] revealing the full revelation of himself
[1:30:06] and without that bride he's not complete
[1:30:10] it has to be an unveiling of that bride
[1:30:12] that bride is none other but himself
[1:30:14] revealed the bride brother Brown said
[1:30:16] the body the bride is himself revealed
[1:30:19] amen
[1:30:21] all right
[1:30:23] not another person it is not another
[1:30:26] voice under her messenger she is the she
[1:30:28] the bride is the final voice and it
[1:30:31] can't deviate from what God already
[1:30:33] brought
[1:30:34] and if you see what this messenger said
[1:30:36] you're going to see it in the scriptures
[1:30:39] it's not some your idea about what this
[1:30:42] quote said give me a bunch of quotes
[1:30:44] that doesn't put you in the bride
[1:30:45] revelation of the word is the evidence
[1:30:48] that you're in him and always was by the
[1:30:50] revelation of himself living in you and
[1:30:52] working through you
[1:30:56] to the promise to the hour to the time
[1:31:00] and its characteristic is known in her
[1:31:04] amen not in others in her alone
[1:31:09] that's right his nature you'll see it
[1:31:11] right in her
[1:31:13] she's a different person physically but
[1:31:15] she's the same person spiritually
[1:31:18] Hallelujah
[1:31:20] Eve looked like a different she was a
[1:31:23] woman figure and Adam but she was Mrs
[1:31:25] Adam to Mr Adam
[1:31:27] she was the mystery of Adam revealed
[1:31:30] she was the climax she was the culmation
[1:31:33] she was absolutely the finished
[1:31:35] revelation of Adam
[1:31:39] incomplete
[1:31:42] it was all in Adam but he had to express
[1:31:44] himself into a form amen
[1:31:50] Hallelujah that is your secret revealed
[1:31:59] all right now
[1:32:01] so we go on to verse 39 the enemy that
[1:32:04] sold them so we see we see the son of
[1:32:06] man went for sowing the field is the
[1:32:08] world the good seed are the children of
[1:32:10] the Kingdom but the tares are the
[1:32:12] children of the wicked one so both have
[1:32:15] seed
[1:32:16] children
[1:32:18] all right and we see that from very
[1:32:20] beginning Abel Cain and Abel met two
[1:32:22] different seeds out of two different
[1:32:24] fathers
[1:32:27] but the same mother
[1:32:30] so you see where that denominational
[1:32:32] thing went through it came through the
[1:32:34] woman
[1:32:37] Hallelujah we can follow it all the way
[1:32:38] down the scriptures
[1:32:40] go right down through the scriptures to
[1:32:42] this very day right now and you find a
[1:32:45] dominating female with an iron
[1:32:46] disposition
[1:32:48] they will try to usurp the authority of
[1:32:50] man
[1:32:51] or of God himself the word by an
[1:32:54] organizational denominational Spirit
[1:32:56] which is not of God it is a fornicating
[1:32:59] idolatrous spirit
[1:33:01] and it's the spirit of organization it's
[1:33:03] the spirit of denominationalism it's a
[1:33:06] system that is against the word and yet
[1:33:08] so close without the Holy Ghost the
[1:33:11] elect would be deceived
[1:33:15] because they appear informed to be
[1:33:18] exactly alike and good works my
[1:33:20] reasoning my reasonable oh yes
[1:33:24] but not the word
[1:33:26] not the truth
[1:33:28] we better thank God that this book was
[1:33:30] opened I'm telling you what you better
[1:33:32] get yourself in that book and you better
[1:33:34] start feeding on that until all of your
[1:33:36] videos and all of these other nonsense
[1:33:38] and foolishness and everything else that
[1:33:40] you got to feed on that Satan's taken
[1:33:43] from you and hidden away from you you're
[1:33:45] going to end up on the short end
[1:33:50] because every time you feed on something
[1:33:52] off of this word you're allowing another
[1:33:54] Spirit to come in and influence you and
[1:33:56] tempt you away from the word Satan hates
[1:33:59] the word Satan hates revelation of that
[1:34:02] word but we the bride love it
[1:34:06] but that's the faith
[1:34:09] that is our Salvation that's the faith
[1:34:12] that is who we are that's the faith seed
[1:34:16] that possesses every gate of his enemy
[1:34:25] all right
[1:34:26] now
[1:34:28] God help me to get through here I just
[1:34:31] started
[1:34:36] now
[1:34:37] he says
[1:34:39] verse 39 the enemy that sold them is the
[1:34:42] devil the Harvest is the end of the
[1:34:43] world and the reapers are the Angels
[1:34:47] and therefore now the Harvest is when
[1:34:51] is the end of the world
[1:34:53] I've got something the prophet said he
[1:34:55] said
[1:34:56] we've arrived
[1:34:58] all right he said then therefore the
[1:35:01] tares are gathered and burned in the
[1:35:02] fire so shall it be in the end of this
[1:35:05] world now you're looking at the end of
[1:35:07] the world
[1:35:10] where at the end time now we're at the
[1:35:12] end of the world
[1:35:13] all right the new heavens and new earth
[1:35:15] hasn't come forth yet
[1:35:17] the millennium's over with now we're at
[1:35:19] the judgment
[1:35:21] all right now the son of man shall send
[1:35:23] forth his angels now he's come right
[1:35:25] back here at this hour that we're in the
[1:35:27] son of man shall send forth his angels
[1:35:29] and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom
[1:35:31] all things that offend it is a binding
[1:35:34] uh or bundling of the tares
[1:35:38] what's doing the separating I'll go that
[1:35:40] just a minute it's the angels
[1:35:44] but the voice of those angels comes
[1:35:46] through an angel
[1:35:50] at the end
[1:35:52] said we've arrived and this is Harvest
[1:35:55] and he sends an angel
[1:35:59] all right now he says of the Kingdom all
[1:36:02] things that offend in them which do
[1:36:04] iniquity do iniquity do what do that
[1:36:06] which they know is the right thing to do
[1:36:08] but they will not do it because they
[1:36:10] have to say face before others
[1:36:14] that's a lot of the reason that's not
[1:36:16] the only reason they can't do it because
[1:36:18] it's not in them to do it
[1:36:21] see it's got to be in you
[1:36:23] if you have a pull towards god you're an
[1:36:25] individual
[1:36:27] when you have that pull you better yield
[1:36:29] to that pull toward him
[1:36:31] you've got to yield to that that's what
[1:36:34] God wants you that's what he put that
[1:36:35] thirst in you to do
[1:36:38] and quit trying to lift yourself up
[1:36:40] among the people and think I've got to
[1:36:42] do something to serve the people to
[1:36:43] satisfy the people what will they think
[1:36:45] about me if I don't that's exactly those
[1:36:47] names that are removed
[1:36:52] I'd said that because that is true but
[1:36:55] if you have me one of his bride it'll
[1:36:57] strike your heart say God forgive me I
[1:36:59] don't mean to do like that
[1:37:02] okay now
[1:37:05] and so they offend he'll draw out and
[1:37:08] they shall and shall cast them brother
[1:37:10] Brown said they aren't burned at the
[1:37:12] bundling
[1:37:13] they're burned later at the white Throne
[1:37:15] they're cast so he says and then shall
[1:37:18] cast him into a furnace of fire there
[1:37:20] shall be there shall be wailing and
[1:37:22] gnashing of teeth that's the Great
[1:37:24] Tribulation they miss it
[1:37:28] amen all right and then shall the
[1:37:31] righteous shine forth as the son as what
[1:37:33] as the sun I wonder if that could be
[1:37:35] s-o-n in the Kingdom of their father who
[1:37:37] hath ears to hear Let Him hear
[1:37:41] all right
[1:37:44] I want to take you to the seat of
[1:37:45] discrepancy here paragraph five
[1:37:53] and this was this was preached on 65
[1:37:58] January 18th
[1:38:02] Jesus given the interpretation of the
[1:38:04] parable himself therefore we know what
[1:38:06] the interpretation means and now as we
[1:38:08] approach this of this sowing of the seed
[1:38:10] and of the reaping now he interprets it
[1:38:12] and then I believe that Jesus was
[1:38:14] speaking of the parable in his day but
[1:38:16] was meaning it to be at the end of the
[1:38:19] world at the end of the age he said or
[1:38:22] he said at the end of the world or the
[1:38:24] End of the Age which is this day
[1:38:29] so brother Brown I'm saying this is what
[1:38:31] this is the day we're in
[1:38:34] everything going to fall right off and
[1:38:36] certainly
[1:38:37] it's going to come to full manifestation
[1:38:39] and judgment
[1:38:40] all right
[1:38:41] okay now he said which is this day so
[1:38:45] work to what's happening the word goes
[1:38:47] out the Revelation goes out the bride
[1:38:49] picks it up the others can't receive it
[1:38:52] and we'll move off into tribulation come
[1:38:54] up at the second resurrection and what
[1:38:57] they did what they how they thought and
[1:38:58] what their attitude was toward the word
[1:39:00] that was ministered to them will be
[1:39:02] judged
[1:39:05] amen all right now
[1:39:10] the Gathering he said it said I believe
[1:39:13] the little text tonight is very
[1:39:15] appropriate for the hour we're living in
[1:39:18] because Jesus distinctly said here the
[1:39:21] Gathering would be at the end of the
[1:39:22] world and that's when the end would be
[1:39:24] the Gathering of the wheat also the
[1:39:27] garnering of the tares and burning them
[1:39:29] and take and to take in the wheat into
[1:39:33] the kingdom
[1:39:36] all right then we go to then we go on
[1:39:39] here to uh paragraph six now Jesus said
[1:39:44] the two would be so close
[1:39:46] next paragraph would be so close
[1:39:48] together
[1:39:50] till it would deceive the very elected
[1:39:52] if it were possible almost exactly the
[1:39:55] same
[1:39:58] so it's not that closeness isn't out
[1:40:01] here
[1:40:02] in these denominations the closest is
[1:40:05] right here in the message around the
[1:40:07] message
[1:40:09] we've been 50 some years since the
[1:40:11] denomination put the word out
[1:40:14] been knocking trying to get that last
[1:40:16] one to come out is that right on the
[1:40:18] door of the church to the individual
[1:40:20] calling the individual out
[1:40:23] come out go into what life
[1:40:28] and at the same time the bride that
[1:40:30] comes out then laying in the presence of
[1:40:32] the sun to ripen but so the sun shines
[1:40:35] upon them and
[1:40:39] the tares
[1:40:41] and the prophet already sent out his
[1:40:43] word it already went out his mouth as a
[1:40:45] sharp sword the word did and it's going
[1:40:48] to separate those two gonna bundle one
[1:40:51] gonna deliver the other
[1:40:55] amen
[1:40:57] all right gonna gather one and get
[1:40:59] bundle the other one gather the other
[1:41:01] one into the into the
[1:41:03] let's go back here and see what
[1:41:05] something the prophet said here I want
[1:41:06] to pick this up
[1:41:07] right here
[1:41:12] talking about those borderline
[1:41:14] Christians
[1:41:15] no that isn't where I want it at all let
[1:41:17] me see just a minute now
[1:41:35] um
[1:41:36] well we'll get to it
[1:41:39] I just can't locate it right now
[1:41:50] oh
[1:41:52] I think I know where I'm at now 226.
[1:41:58] well I'll just go to it I just felt
[1:42:00] checked on that so let me just I'll get
[1:42:02] to it because I have it in my in the
[1:42:04] book here
[1:42:08] okay
[1:42:13] I have page 91 and 92 of this church age
[1:42:17] book page 91 and 92.
[1:42:26] okay and I just read to you if you add
[1:42:28] to or take from
[1:42:33] 91 and 92 paragraph 75 70 75.
[1:42:42] brother Graham said it sounds like to
[1:42:45] you this anti-word Antichrist spirit is
[1:42:47] a complete repudiation of the word a
[1:42:49] denial of the Bible culminating in its
[1:42:51] rejection no sir it's not that
[1:42:56] he said what it is
[1:42:57] it's the changing of even just one word
[1:43:00] and by taking away or adding to it
[1:43:05] oh my God sent a prophet we believe that
[1:43:11] okay but what did he say
[1:43:18] well we we believe in dressing long
[1:43:20] dresses what's that slit there
[1:43:24] kind of like cutting hair why are you
[1:43:25] trimming it
[1:43:29] it's the same as cutting
[1:43:31] well my dress is long yeah but how skin
[1:43:33] tight is it
[1:43:35] what are you drawing attention to
[1:43:37] the holy God or the holy self
[1:43:43] a man that will look upon you because
[1:43:45] you dress that way and lust after you is
[1:43:47] committed adultery with you that
[1:43:49] and will be accounted in adulterer and
[1:43:51] he'll say well who would I do it with
[1:43:52] here she is or who'd I do with here he
[1:43:55] is
[1:43:58] don't tell me they're not religious
[1:44:02] they're more religious than what you
[1:44:04] think and they can act religion a lot
[1:44:05] better than the bride can
[1:44:11] and put on clothes that pertain you can
[1:44:14] have a dress that even even pertains you
[1:44:16] look up the word pertained
[1:44:18] you want to have pockets you want to
[1:44:20] have something that pertains to a man
[1:44:24] even pertaineth to them be careful don't
[1:44:27] see how close you can get to the edge
[1:44:28] see how far away you can stay from it
[1:44:32] see I didn't know what brother if you
[1:44:34] were here Wednesday I didn't know what
[1:44:36] brother
[1:44:38] Chris was preaching on
[1:44:40] but I said brother don't go any further
[1:44:44] because he was talking I took up Judas I
[1:44:46] had the same quotes I said it seamlessly
[1:44:48] put together
[1:44:50] he didn't know it I I was preaching on
[1:44:52] and I didn't know what he was preaching
[1:44:54] on so that's the Holy Ghost working
[1:44:55] Among Us not the man
[1:45:00] all right now it's changing even just
[1:45:03] one word
[1:45:04] Eve fell by one word
[1:45:09] well I'll let him get by today without
[1:45:11] with one word they don't disability I
[1:45:13] don't believe that one word you know I
[1:45:15] thought that's all right I'm a
[1:45:17] wishy-washy God I can compromise with
[1:45:19] him no he won't
[1:45:23] one word disbelief taken from this are
[1:45:26] added to it don't you put your
[1:45:28] interpretation of what God
[1:45:30] spoke through a prophet and interpreted
[1:45:32] to you
[1:45:33] this is what the scripture means well I
[1:45:36] don't believe what he said be careful
[1:45:38] your name can be easily removed right
[1:45:40] there and you go and live and act that
[1:45:42] out
[1:45:44] what is in your heart to make you do
[1:45:46] that
[1:45:50] you say Brother David what are you
[1:45:52] preaching for I pray that somehow the
[1:45:54] word might strike and uncover a spirit
[1:45:56] that you might be delivered
[1:46:02] aren't you afraid of pending people if
[1:46:04] the word offends you I'm sorry
[1:46:07] but if David has in his Spirit to be an
[1:46:09] offensive thing to you I need to be at
[1:46:11] the altar
[1:46:13] but woe unto me if I don't preach this
[1:46:15] gospel because I'm going to have to give
[1:46:17] answer well who said this when did I
[1:46:19] hear that hear am I Lord
[1:46:22] there it is right before him
[1:46:24] here's what was said
[1:46:28] amen
[1:46:30] on the 11th
[1:46:32] of December
[1:46:35] 2022.
[1:46:40] amen that's how real you've got to
[1:46:42] recognize this message is not a play
[1:46:44] thing coming to church is not a play
[1:46:46] thing either you have the love to come
[1:46:48] to church and want to be among the
[1:46:49] people or you don't and you're doing it
[1:46:52] because you think it's your duty may God
[1:46:55] Smite that soul and open up if there's
[1:46:57] anything to be opened in your soul may
[1:46:59] you realize where you're standing
[1:47:08] huh
[1:47:10] well I don't like the way you preach it
[1:47:12] I'm sorry God does
[1:47:17] amen
[1:47:19] you see it Pricks my heart it defends me
[1:47:21] well well can we live a Christian Life
[1:47:23] and not be offensive to someone
[1:47:28] can the gospel be preached in its
[1:47:30] straightness and not offend
[1:47:32] I guarantee you the gospel itself the
[1:47:35] living word for this season preached in
[1:47:36] that power of revelation will never
[1:47:39] offend the bride never she may wonder
[1:47:42] how it's why and then God unveils it to
[1:47:44] her you can be absolutely sure that if
[1:47:47] you're right with God God's not going to
[1:47:49] let you deviate off the path
[1:47:51] that he'll scream and say get in line
[1:47:57] quit getting your eyes out here upon
[1:47:59] what other people are doing quit
[1:48:01] comparing yourself with someone else
[1:48:02] especially young people
[1:48:04] it's you between you and God it's an
[1:48:07] individual Affair you are answerable to
[1:48:10] him you're not answerable to your
[1:48:11] friends
[1:48:12] you're not answerable to anyone else but
[1:48:14] him
[1:48:16] right all right but just change one word
[1:48:19] by adding or taking it away just see how
[1:48:21] close you can do and to dress and be
[1:48:24] careful what you're doing because you
[1:48:25] have a spirit motivating you on
[1:48:27] everything you do everything you say
[1:48:29] even the color clothes you wear
[1:48:32] right
[1:48:33] it's got a spirit that motivates you one
[1:48:36] way or the other look what you're
[1:48:37] dabbling into trying to mix the word
[1:48:40] with some something else that's off the
[1:48:42] word instead of taking the word as your
[1:48:45] absolute you've got to take that plus
[1:48:49] it's not Jesus Plus
[1:48:51] it's Jesus alone
[1:48:54] his word is absolutely perfect
[1:49:00] and the fruit you're bearing is not that
[1:49:01] word it's a mix
[1:49:04] a little of the world a little of what
[1:49:06] others have said trying to bring
[1:49:08] something else that's contrary to the
[1:49:09] word but you can't discern it the reason
[1:49:11] you can't you need a new birth
[1:49:14] you can be Sanctified and still go to
[1:49:17] hell
[1:49:20] hello if you don't retain that
[1:49:23] sanctification
[1:49:25] and you trample under feet because you
[1:49:27] won't believe the word and despise that
[1:49:29] blood that did sanctify you and counted
[1:49:32] an Unholy thing the prophet said you you
[1:49:35] are absolutely indicted as crucifying
[1:49:37] Jesus Christ afresh and he's here right
[1:49:40] here in Bride form bringing the word to
[1:49:42] you every day not only the preacher the
[1:49:45] members of his body can't do anything
[1:49:47] but declare him today to be the same
[1:49:53] will they suffer yes they'll suffer
[1:49:55] they'll suffer the very closest thing to
[1:49:57] them a lot of times their own family
[1:50:02] that's the truth
[1:50:04] what God what Brother Brad what'd the
[1:50:06] word say I bring a sword to do what
[1:50:10] Jesus said I bring a sword
[1:50:15] to separate separate you to who to some
[1:50:19] theology some idea to something off his
[1:50:21] word to some other dictate to some other
[1:50:23] book to some other reading to some other
[1:50:25] psychology
[1:50:29] it's the word everything you need but
[1:50:32] the devil's buffaloing you and making
[1:50:34] you believe you don't have everything
[1:50:36] you need in this message
[1:50:38] if you are in the message you would
[1:50:40] absolutely live it
[1:50:46] amen all right it's the original trick
[1:50:49] of Satan in the Garden of Eden he just
[1:50:51] added one little word to what God Said
[1:50:53] that did it it brought death and
[1:50:55] destruction
[1:50:56] and Ephesus it was the same just a word
[1:50:58] added just a word taken away and the
[1:51:00] anti-word Antichrist Spirit began to
[1:51:03] flourish
[1:51:04] did you get it there are those twins
[1:51:07] again
[1:51:08] and today we have twins again
[1:51:11] brother Brandon said that the one twin
[1:51:14] will be a Pentecostal denominational
[1:51:15] Fair
[1:51:17] and the other will be a genuine word
[1:51:19] birthed
[1:51:21] it's grain seed of the season
[1:51:24] again
[1:51:26] Alpha and Omega and the prophet said she
[1:51:30] is omega
[1:51:32] he's Alpha she's Omega he's Alpha he's
[1:51:35] Omega amen it's him you can't separate
[1:51:39] the bride from him whatever he is and
[1:51:41] promise of him Promises of her for she
[1:51:44] is in him
[1:51:45] she doesn't come before him she comes in
[1:51:47] him
[1:51:50] men amen a
[1:51:53] man amen hallelujah those two trees are
[1:51:56] growing again side by side in the same
[1:51:58] the same Earth ground partaking of the
[1:52:01] same nourishment drinking in the same
[1:52:03] rain benefiting by the same Sun but they
[1:52:06] come from different seeds one tree is
[1:52:09] for the word of God exactly as God gave
[1:52:12] it and loves and obeys it the other tree
[1:52:16] is the seed that is anti the word of God
[1:52:18] and changes it where it wants to it
[1:52:21] substitutes its own Creed and dogmas for
[1:52:23] the living true word exactly as did Cain
[1:52:25] who ended up killing Abel but fear not
[1:52:28] little flocks stay with the word keep
[1:52:30] that word between you and the devil Eve
[1:52:32] did not do that and she failed and when
[1:52:35] the church lets down on the word and she
[1:52:37] goes into the depths of the darkness of
[1:52:39] Satan
[1:52:40] that's not speaking of the church bride
[1:52:43] going in the depths of Satan
[1:52:45] the bride comes out of that church
[1:52:48] that she will go into those depths
[1:52:50] because she will not keep the truth but
[1:52:53] if you're really born again if you're
[1:52:54] really truly child of God you'll be in
[1:52:57] that word the prophet said all the way
[1:52:59] he said there's your evidence
[1:53:03] amen
[1:53:04] amen
[1:53:06] I love it I love the word it just lays
[1:53:09] it out straight I love it amen all right
[1:53:12] now first John 4. now let's let's go
[1:53:15] back here to seed of discrepancy I'm
[1:53:17] coming I got to come to a close and I
[1:53:19] haven't even touched this message I
[1:53:21] don't know how I'm going to finish it on
[1:53:22] Wednesday
[1:53:23] God help us that's all I can do
[1:53:27] maybe I'll have another opportunity some
[1:53:28] other time
[1:53:30] first John 4 I mean excuse me you can
[1:53:34] turn there but in in chat in verse in uh
[1:53:38] paragraph 17 of the seed of discrepancy
[1:53:41] and the vision was interpreted the rain
[1:53:43] falls on the just and the unjust The
[1:53:45] Same Spirit can fall in a meeting and
[1:53:47] everybody rejoice in it Hypocrites
[1:53:49] Christians and all together exactly
[1:53:51] right but what is it by their fruits
[1:53:53] they are known brother Brahm to it over
[1:53:55] and over again anointed once the end
[1:53:57] time said what is the fruit it's the
[1:53:58] fruit
[1:53:59] it's the word for the season not your
[1:54:03] emotion not how many Devils you he said
[1:54:05] never judge your life by how many Devils
[1:54:07] you can cast out
[1:54:09] because Judas cast out Devils through
[1:54:11] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:54:14] and he was a son of Satan
[1:54:17] then what did it was it Satan cast out
[1:54:19] Satan no but it was the it was the word
[1:54:22] that he received from Jesus I give you
[1:54:24] power over it
[1:54:25] and he took that word and believed that
[1:54:27] amen are you with me and the Holy Ghost
[1:54:30] casts out that devil
[1:54:32] and Satan using that anointing
[1:54:39] see
[1:54:41] how close it is
[1:54:44] you can dress the part you can live the
[1:54:46] part you can work the part everywhere
[1:54:47] part you want to but unless that soul is
[1:54:49] the seed of God you're going you're not
[1:54:51] going to go in the rapture
[1:54:57] and who determined that God in his
[1:54:59] sovereignty
[1:55:00] placed it on the book of life before the
[1:55:02] foundation World by what he knew
[1:55:06] now who's going to tell him he made he
[1:55:08] didn't know the right thing
[1:55:12] so you see where we're at
[1:55:14] but I'm not saying you're in and you're
[1:55:15] out you're in you're out no but they're
[1:55:17] fruit
[1:55:19] the word has to be ministered because
[1:55:21] it's by the opening of the word is the
[1:55:22] only way you're going to be delivered
[1:55:26] from
[1:55:27] that thing that wants to hold you bound
[1:55:32] and that thing happens to be the devil
[1:55:36] amen
[1:55:37] he's anti-word Antichrist
[1:55:42] but God wants you to see your position
[1:55:44] is Christ the devil doesn't want you to
[1:55:46] see your position as Christ
[1:55:48] and if it's Christ then you're going to
[1:55:49] stay with the word and if something
[1:55:51] you're doing and preaching and no woman
[1:55:53] has a right to your serp authority over
[1:55:55] a man and go out and teach something
[1:55:56] that's contrary to this word you can't
[1:55:58] even do it you can't even teach it
[1:56:01] and try to take a position even as a
[1:56:03] preacher we know that I think we're
[1:56:06] versed enough in that but what these
[1:56:08] other things that you think you can go
[1:56:10] out there and mix with the word
[1:56:12] and it's off of the word
[1:56:14] I I say to you if you don't think that's
[1:56:16] true go and search it out and find out
[1:56:18] if it's off the word or not if you say
[1:56:20] you've got the Holy Ghost why aren't you
[1:56:21] Discerning what's right
[1:56:26] instead your your wife is your serpent
[1:56:28] authority over her husband
[1:56:33] and you don't have enough discernment to
[1:56:35] keep your house in order
[1:56:37] where are you ending up
[1:56:40] amen
[1:56:42] that wasn't me that said that
[1:56:47] that may have been my voice but that
[1:56:49] wasn't me that said that
[1:56:52] he said that
[1:56:55] and God knows who he's talking to
[1:56:58] it's time you better make sure where
[1:57:00] you're standing don't just play with
[1:57:02] this message well I'll come and see if
[1:57:04] it's right or not
[1:57:07] all right now I've got to have to close
[1:57:10] because I have something I wanna I wanna
[1:57:12] I wanna read a testimony
[1:57:15] so I may have to skip a lot of this
[1:57:25] by the fruits they are known
[1:57:27] see you see how Wild Oats and wild wheat
[1:57:30] and grain sometimes impersonated genuine
[1:57:32] domestic grain so close that would
[1:57:33] deceive the very elected I think we're
[1:57:35] living in a timely age when these things
[1:57:37] should be preached on and talked about
[1:57:44] I'll read that quote again
[1:57:46] what's he talking about Hebrews 6
[1:57:48] Hebrews 10. the rain falling of the just
[1:57:51] and the unjust
[1:57:53] what makes it what makes the difference
[1:57:54] their soul not the anointing
[1:58:02] they can't hear the word they can't
[1:58:03] receive the word and therefore they come
[1:58:05] away and they reject the word they don't
[1:58:07] obey the word they say well it doesn't
[1:58:09] mean it there it add to and take from
[1:58:12] amen all right and he said now
[1:58:16] notice
[1:58:18] these things he said we're living in a
[1:58:20] timely age when these things should be
[1:58:23] preached on and talked about
[1:58:25] notice verse 41 2 very close so close in
[1:58:29] the last days he could not depend on
[1:58:31] some certain Church to separate him
[1:58:33] you say the well I'm just going to take
[1:58:35] it from Methodist the Baptist to some
[1:58:37] message church out here over there
[1:58:39] somewhere else around the world
[1:58:42] to separate them
[1:58:43] amen
[1:58:45] all right it's not you belong to church
[1:58:47] you need to come to church but you
[1:58:49] better be careful where you're feeding
[1:58:50] on what you're feeding on
[1:58:55] all right now
[1:58:58] he said he sends his angels to separate
[1:59:01] them now watch what the prophet says an
[1:59:03] angel Not Angels an angel
[1:59:06] he sends his angels did not isn't that
[1:59:09] what we had
[1:59:10] shown to us in the sky angels
[1:59:16] what'd they do made up is what Authority
[1:59:18] God had his authority to those angels
[1:59:21] Seven Stars
[1:59:23] seven angels met with one messenger in a
[1:59:28] little room an angel
[1:59:31] and God took that word and put it in the
[1:59:34] hand of that angel
[1:59:36] his own sword
[1:59:38] then who are we who are we hearing from
[1:59:40] when we feed on this open book we are
[1:59:43] hearing from the king of kings that
[1:59:45] ought to make some difference to you
[1:59:50] put it in his hand and said it's the
[1:59:53] sword of the king not a king the king
[1:59:56] and he cried with the voice of the lion
[1:59:58] roarth and when he had cried
[2:00:02] the book opened
[2:00:04] and in that book was the mystery
[2:00:06] revealed that called your name
[2:00:13] amen there it is right there that little
[2:00:15] book was the record it was a record it
[2:00:18] was a section of the Book of Life whose
[2:00:20] names could never be removed because the
[2:00:23] record he gave us the records of his own
[2:00:24] life which is eternal
[2:00:27] and he who hath that son hath life who
[2:00:30] has the seed has life he who hath not
[2:00:33] the son hath not life
[2:00:36] amen and brother Branham In This Very
[2:00:38] message I'm taught I've already done it
[2:00:39] the first message I preached right here
[2:00:41] on this series he said right there he
[2:00:43] said that little book that open book
[2:00:45] which he called the bride book he said
[2:00:47] and also he called the the weddings the
[2:00:50] marriage certificate
[2:00:53] he said be an opened calls her
[2:00:56] amen
[2:00:58] come right by his side and take her
[2:01:00] position as Queen
[2:01:02] having this having under him the the
[2:01:05] ownership of the property he owns
[2:01:08] and under under his sovereignty she's
[2:01:10] Sovereign under sovereignty amen she's
[2:01:13] given Authority Under sovereignty
[2:01:15] are you with me
[2:01:17] just go back to Esther and queen and
[2:01:20] king assurus and see if that isn't right
[2:01:24] Ashera so whatever you call it okay now
[2:01:27] I've got to close off and I gotta get to
[2:01:28] one quote here
[2:01:31] well watch this
[2:01:32] but an Angel is coming to bring the
[2:01:35] separation he said
[2:01:37] brother Branham bringing the
[2:01:38] interpretation an Angel is coming to
[2:01:40] bring the separation the segregation
[2:01:43] between the right and the wrong and no
[2:01:45] one can do it but the angel of the Lord
[2:01:47] he's the one that is going to tell which
[2:01:49] is right and which is wrong
[2:01:52] all right brother Bradham said I had to
[2:01:54] be caught up in that that those angels
[2:01:56] to make the seventh I had to meet that
[2:01:58] Mighty Angel and I had to meet him to
[2:02:00] come back with the interpretation of
[2:02:02] that seventh seal
[2:02:06] all right so there's something pertains
[2:02:09] and brother Brad and the prophet said
[2:02:11] it's the revelation of his coming
[2:02:13] and he said only the bride knows that
[2:02:15] secret why because only she can see that
[2:02:18] the words being fulfilled now we see the
[2:02:20] Promise being fulfilled Christ the true
[2:02:23] headship going in his bride coming in
[2:02:26] his bride
[2:02:28] okay
[2:02:29] Christ The Mystery of God revealed now
[2:02:31] we see it he didn't say we're going to
[2:02:34] that's our Lord up there he said
[2:02:37] and you talk about something the devil
[2:02:39] wants to water down and water down and
[2:02:41] water down is the Turning of the corner
[2:02:43] in 1963. you say that's not Soul then
[2:02:46] how why'd he turn a corner in 1956
[2:02:50] he said God doesn't turn those Corners
[2:02:51] oh yes he does he said we're building a
[2:02:53] house
[2:02:54] not a straight wall
[2:02:58] it had a meaning absolutely had a
[2:03:01] meaning
[2:03:02] or he said this this this nation's
[2:03:04] either going to receive or reject
[2:03:06] this gospel and make the difference in
[2:03:08] 1956 he divided it he turned the corner
[2:03:12] and in 63 he did it again nobody's taken
[2:03:15] away with what he said earlier nobody's
[2:03:17] taken away anything but we see the
[2:03:19] Turning of the corner to the grain
[2:03:21] itself
[2:03:22] and to see that uniting of the Bride
[2:03:25] with him
[2:03:27] and it's his coming and now she is
[2:03:30] fulfilling that in another form and it
[2:03:32] has to be fulfilled that way because
[2:03:34] we've got to meet him in the air and
[2:03:36] without this Revelation there would be
[2:03:38] no meaning
[2:03:41] it's the Revelation and it's that
[2:03:44] mystery that you are was in him and was
[2:03:47] hid away under that seventh seal that's
[2:03:49] completely opened up
[2:03:50] to you
[2:03:53] and Vindicated to you
[2:03:57] amen amen now
[2:04:00] so an angel Not Angels down through here
[2:04:02] these Seven Ages Not Angels but Angels
[2:04:05] but Angels at the last time would gather
[2:04:08] together amen
[2:04:10] angels with the last time would gather
[2:04:13] together
[2:04:15] foreign
[2:04:17] now we know that this is the coming
[2:04:20] Harvest time now
[2:04:23] now an angel is actually interpreted a
[2:04:25] messenger and we see there are seven
[2:04:28] angels through the churches but now he
[2:04:31] said now now he said no
[2:04:34] the seven angels not now Angels now he
[2:04:36] said no he said no through the church
[2:04:39] ages
[2:04:42] but now an angel comes to deliver the
[2:04:45] message
[2:04:48] amen the hidden Mystery the hidden
[2:04:51] secret what is it through there that
[2:04:53] pertains to you who you are and your
[2:04:57] ordained position
[2:05:01] he uncovered that devil
[2:05:07] and he can't have what you've got
[2:05:10] he can't receive it and God hid it right
[2:05:12] down to the end he has no time to do
[2:05:15] anything with it too late
[2:05:17] Glory
[2:05:20] amen
[2:05:23] so the seed of God the word of God and
[2:05:25] the children of God the children of the
[2:05:27] Kingdom has become the seed of God and
[2:05:29] they must be the word of God the word of
[2:05:31] God manifested in the age that they're
[2:05:33] living in
[2:05:34] they're the pro they are the promised
[2:05:35] seed of the age each age had its seed
[2:05:38] its time its promise
[2:05:40] now we see the Promise
[2:05:43] all right now
[2:05:49] each age is given a promise of the word
[2:05:51] and the people of that age that manifest
[2:05:54] the promise word is the seed of that age
[2:05:57] the manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[2:05:59] operating through his children brother
[2:06:01] Brown said he would come and he would
[2:06:03] work in and through his bride
[2:06:07] all right now
[2:06:09] he said there's only the
[2:06:16] now I could speak a lot about Judas but
[2:06:18] if I get into that I'm going to carry
[2:06:19] way over
[2:06:21] you know I'm only on page two
[2:06:24] and I have seven of them
[2:06:28] so God help us
[2:06:29] I've got to get to this and I will
[2:06:31] intend to get to it all the way through
[2:06:33] as God will open the door
[2:06:35] but listen I'm just trying to hit the
[2:06:37] synopsis of it fast here because Judas
[2:06:40] was one of those that the spirit fell
[2:06:41] upon but his name was removed why
[2:06:43] because he couldn't come up to Pentecost
[2:06:45] to receive a new birth
[2:06:50] amen
[2:06:51] he couldn't
[2:06:52] the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy
[2:06:55] Ghost falling upon a genuine seed of God
[2:06:57] is the new birth
[2:06:59] now will you give me about 10 minutes
[2:07:01] okay and I will I will try to close this
[2:07:04] off so the seed of God brother Branham
[2:07:07] said is the interpretation of the word
[2:07:09] you are written Epistles red of all men
[2:07:12] now I didn't say she was You're The
[2:07:14] Interpreter you're the interpretation it
[2:07:17] went from Prophet to his prophecy and
[2:07:19] you're the interpretation
[2:07:21] of the Word of Promise of this day
[2:07:23] that's the seed if you only realize that
[2:07:27] you're the seed it'll change you because
[2:07:29] that thought of you had to come forth as
[2:07:32] a word
[2:07:34] and you were in that thought
[2:07:36] then that thought of himself which is
[2:07:38] what you are was eternal if you ever get
[2:07:41] a hold of that
[2:07:43] I'll tell you right now you can't unless
[2:07:44] you're born again
[2:07:47] but if you ever get a hold of that
[2:07:48] you'll never doubt it again you know
[2:07:51] you're walking with God
[2:07:53] and if you're walking with God I say
[2:07:55] what do you have to fear
[2:08:02] amen don't you depend on you have
[2:08:05] knowledge of the Mysteries you can have
[2:08:07] an intellectual knowledge of every
[2:08:08] mystery find every quote that won't do
[2:08:11] you a bit of good unless you have
[2:08:13] charity which is God himself in you it's
[2:08:17] of no good
[2:08:18] you have faith to move mountains amen
[2:08:21] every bit of it I'm going to First
[2:08:23] Corinthians 13. the difference is that
[2:08:25] God is love he is that love and without
[2:08:27] him and you none of those matter
[2:08:32] exactly because without him dwelling
[2:08:35] abiding dwelling I'm not talking about
[2:08:37] just an anointing I'm talking about him
[2:08:39] coming in and and that seed becomes
[2:08:41] alive it's been quickened to the promise
[2:08:43] you are that Living Word made manifest
[2:08:46] for this day
[2:08:48] you are the word living and in action
[2:08:51] you are the operational Living Word
[2:08:54] absolutely that can discern the
[2:08:56] difference between good and evil light
[2:08:57] and dark I don't care how close they are
[2:08:59] it's that word that discerns the
[2:09:01] difference it's that real seed that's
[2:09:03] inside of you that was birth in you that
[2:09:07] holds you and keeps you that's the real
[2:09:09] gift
[2:09:11] not my many Devils you can I believe in
[2:09:13] casting out devil don't let me I'm not
[2:09:15] trying to give a negative to that
[2:09:16] because the bride does it first then
[2:09:18] then the impersonators come behind it
[2:09:21] how many know that's right
[2:09:25] who went first Moses or Janice and
[2:09:27] Jeffries
[2:09:31] that's right he obeyed what God Said to
[2:09:33] do
[2:09:35] he didn't try to say here here you can't
[2:09:37] do that I'm the only one no they were
[2:09:39] carnal impersonators
[2:09:41] and anointed of God to do it
[2:09:43] yeah go back to Second Timothy three and
[2:09:46] find out if that's not so
[2:09:48] having a form of Godless but denying the
[2:09:51] power thereof having a form I I wanna
[2:09:54] I'll have all these things down here to
[2:09:55] get to having a form what is the form
[2:09:57] shadow
[2:10:00] it's a shadow
[2:10:03] it's just a form of a true object
[2:10:07] they look the part even believe God sent
[2:10:09] a prophet Naval able to receive the true
[2:10:11] revelation of the message that he
[2:10:13] brought not being born again or have the
[2:10:15] seed of God in their soul quickened to
[2:10:17] Life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:20] amen the Bible said this is the message
[2:10:23] God is light and the Bible said in James
[2:10:25] 1 17 there is no variableness
[2:10:28] discrepancy or Shadow discrepancy of
[2:10:31] turning
[2:10:34] you can't add anything to white white is
[2:10:36] the original color you know what the
[2:10:38] prophet said to add anything with white
[2:10:40] is to go pale and go to death
[2:10:43] so you can't add or take away this
[2:10:45] perfect truth the perfect word
[2:10:48] this message this message which is this
[2:10:51] Bible made known in this day the promise
[2:10:54] of the day
[2:10:55] ought to be your absolute
[2:10:59] right
[2:11:01] yes sir praise the Lord
[2:11:04] that's exactly right
[2:11:08] because you know it's been Vindicated by
[2:11:10] God you know it's perfectly the truth
[2:11:16] so there's no shadow
[2:11:18] only the elect can be reborn did you
[2:11:20] know that only the elect can be born
[2:11:22] again because in them lays the seed of
[2:11:24] God to be quickened in non-elect there's
[2:11:27] nothing there to Quicken they're where
[2:11:30] soul
[2:11:34] there you are okay then so of James 17
[2:11:37] there's no variable this is neither
[2:11:39] shadow of turning no mixing light and
[2:11:41] darkness it will not mix
[2:11:44] it cannot mix
[2:11:51] all right
[2:11:52] now we have we did I just I'm gonna have
[2:11:54] to I'm gonna have to stop
[2:11:58] oh Lord Lord have we crossed out devils
[2:12:00] in your name spoke in tongues in your
[2:12:01] name done this prophesied in your name
[2:12:02] cast out Devils saw Mighty Miracles done
[2:12:04] miracles in your name he said depart
[2:12:07] from me you worker of those that knew to
[2:12:09] do what's right and you wouldn't do it
[2:12:10] iniquity I don't know you
[2:12:14] is that right yeah
[2:12:18] he never said they didn't do it Jesus
[2:12:20] said if I cast out Devils by the Finger
[2:12:22] of God who do you Pharisees and
[2:12:24] Sadducees who do your children cast them
[2:12:25] out by
[2:12:30] cathus prophesied it was correct this
[2:12:32] prophecy Balaam prophesied and was
[2:12:34] correctness prophecy both anointed to do
[2:12:37] so
[2:12:38] but faults in their teaching
[2:12:41] their teaching of Balaam was idolatry
[2:12:43] the teaching of Balaam was to mix the
[2:12:46] true word and God looked upon that
[2:12:49] Israel and said you belong to no Nation
[2:12:51] I've accepted you as a separate people
[2:12:53] and you don't belong to those other
[2:12:55] nations I've got that scripture to bring
[2:12:58] I'm just kind of hitting these side
[2:12:59] points right now did you know you can
[2:13:02] have the baptism the genuine baptism of
[2:13:04] the Holy Ghost on your spirit
[2:13:07] you are Spirit man is that right you can
[2:13:09] have that genuine baptism on your spirit
[2:13:11] and go to hell
[2:13:13] because the soul is the thing that God
[2:13:16] sent his holy ghost to Quicken
[2:13:19] you say well you're judging me I'm not
[2:13:20] judging nobody if anything's judging you
[2:13:23] it's the word
[2:13:24] that's the truth and these things need
[2:13:26] to be talked about and preached on
[2:13:30] but there's a lot of scared preachers
[2:13:31] that don't want to preach it why because
[2:13:33] it'll cleanse and set you free
[2:13:36] when you can recognize what this spirit
[2:13:39] is today it's an antichrist anti-word
[2:13:42] Spirit that's so close to the real it
[2:13:45] could deceive if it was possible the
[2:13:47] elect
[2:13:51] right now I've got quote after quote let
[2:13:54] me just let me get to one
[2:13:56] here
[2:13:58] you'd want you don't want your garment
[2:14:00] unspotted so leave alone let me let me
[2:14:03] just read something I know I'm I know
[2:14:05] I'm going a little over time here but
[2:14:06] just bear with me just a minute
[2:14:10] if you were in my shoes you wouldn't
[2:14:12] well I won't say that
[2:14:14] it doesn't matter you're not in my shoes
[2:14:16] so there all right 97
[2:14:19] paragraph 97 of this same of this
[2:14:21] message
[2:14:23] he said
[2:14:25] he said he's referring to the few who
[2:14:27] have not defiled their garments
[2:14:30] he said years ago we used to have a
[2:14:32] saying No Doubt was taken from this
[2:14:33] verse it was keep your skirts clean now
[2:14:35] I'm talking about unspotted here
[2:14:38] you don't have a form we do we want more
[2:14:40] than a form brother sister we've got to
[2:14:42] have the real thing not a form of
[2:14:45] godliness
[2:14:46] oh I go to church I believe the message
[2:14:48] I believe the prophet then why are you
[2:14:50] doing and dabbling in those things
[2:14:52] that's contrary to the word
[2:14:55] why are you doing it because you're not
[2:14:57] certain of where you stand
[2:15:00] you don't know
[2:15:02] all right now watch he said it was keep
[2:15:04] your skirts clean I mean it means don't
[2:15:07] get involved in questionable things
[2:15:10] hello
[2:15:11] questionable
[2:15:17] you have a pure word what do you need
[2:15:20] something else for
[2:15:22] nothing will deliver the soul or any
[2:15:25] Deliverance outside of this word
[2:15:34] I could say something real strong here
[2:15:37] but it would be too pinpointing
[2:15:40] I pray that you'll get the revelation
[2:15:43] stay away from questionable things
[2:15:47] others will be involved and might be
[2:15:49] tempted to be in to might be 10 you
[2:15:52] might be tempted to be involved now I'm
[2:15:54] leading up to something I want to read
[2:15:56] on the testimony here to close this
[2:15:58] service off so bear with me it's a true
[2:16:00] testimony of a sister
[2:16:05] I'm gonna read it it was sent to me by a
[2:16:07] minister a well-known minister in this
[2:16:08] message I requested it I heard him give
[2:16:12] it he said absolutely no problem he sent
[2:16:15] it to me
[2:16:18] and I'm intending it to stir stir you up
[2:16:23] I'm intending it for it to just put you
[2:16:26] under conviction if you're doing what
[2:16:28] I'm about to read
[2:16:30] and if you're dabbling around
[2:16:31] questionable things you better forget it
[2:16:33] because if you've got the Holy Ghost you
[2:16:34] know if there's a question you know what
[2:16:36] you ought to do about it leave it alone
[2:16:39] because everything we do is by faith and
[2:16:42] if it's not Faith it's sin
[2:16:45] and if it's not Faith it's off the word
[2:16:49] because Faith only one thing that
[2:16:51] pleases God and the just shall live by
[2:16:54] faith and only one thing that pleases
[2:16:55] God and that's faith
[2:16:58] true revelation of the word
[2:17:03] amen that's how Enoch
[2:17:06] went home in a rapture
[2:17:09] was by revelation
[2:17:13] all right now let's go right here he
[2:17:15] says now he said
[2:17:17] they he said God's going to reward those
[2:17:20] who follow this advice he said he said
[2:17:23] you might be tempted to be involved or
[2:17:25] someone may even try to involve you
[2:17:33] or you or you or here or anyone
[2:17:37] someone may be tempted to involve you
[2:17:40] into this questionable activity
[2:17:45] that has nothing to do with feeding your
[2:17:48] soul you need to be looking to the word
[2:17:50] if you want Deliverance
[2:17:55] not to some psychology of a man written
[2:17:58] in a book
[2:18:02] all right
[2:18:04] you say you offended me by saying that
[2:18:06] okay that's all right it's the truth
[2:18:13] now God is going to reward though he
[2:18:15] said you might even he said or someone
[2:18:18] might even try to involve you he said
[2:18:20] but stay clear of it all do you believe
[2:18:21] what that Prophet said he said stay
[2:18:23] clear of it all
[2:18:25] by setting a course away from it
[2:18:29] flee it get away from it don't you
[2:18:32] dabble in that thing it's removing you
[2:18:35] yourself away from the truth
[2:18:37] well but I had a spirit tell me whatever
[2:18:39] Spirit told you to do it is not of God
[2:18:44] he said why because it's off the word
[2:18:52] all right
[2:18:53] now God is going to reward those who
[2:18:56] follow this advice they are going to be
[2:18:58] clothed in white even as he is clothed
[2:19:02] in white
[2:19:04] he said his clothes were as white as
[2:19:06] light that is how the Saints are going
[2:19:08] to be clothed these their garments will
[2:19:10] be shining exceedingly white this sin is
[2:19:13] the message God is light and in him is
[2:19:17] no shadow
[2:19:19] you can't inject something else into
[2:19:21] this word you quit your dabbling and get
[2:19:24] where you need to be and start feeding
[2:19:25] on this open Word and things will start
[2:19:27] straightening up in your house and in
[2:19:29] your life and everything else and your
[2:19:31] children
[2:19:34] amen that's exactly right you are here
[2:19:37] to apply the token you say I walk with
[2:19:39] God then walk with him why are you
[2:19:41] trying to mix him with somebody else
[2:19:45] then start applying the token to your
[2:19:48] own life to what you read to what you
[2:19:50] hear to what you're teaching others to
[2:19:52] do that's off the word
[2:19:58] amen
[2:20:01] all right
[2:20:03] now
[2:20:04] I won't go any further with that
[2:20:07] okay he said no he said he said that the
[2:20:10] Believers have always been spoken
[2:20:13] against criticized
[2:20:15] watch what he said on a message 57 9 22
[2:20:19] evening paragraph 349 and you people
[2:20:22] with these saw blade tempers that's
[2:20:24] always spouting off at the mouth of
[2:20:25] somebody can't put up and things like
[2:20:28] that be careful you're guilty if you
[2:20:30] speak a word against your brother
[2:20:32] that's not right not just go around and
[2:20:35] tear down you don't have us you don't
[2:20:38] have to stick a knife in a man's back to
[2:20:40] kill him you have you can break his
[2:20:43] character and kill him kill his
[2:20:45] influence speak against your pastor and
[2:20:47] say something bad about him you might as
[2:20:49] well have shot him
[2:20:55] amen told something that wasn't right
[2:20:57] about him be careful you're guilty said
[2:21:02] and you go off and spread something
[2:21:03] contrary and maybe him out of it just
[2:21:06] your imagination and you go on and
[2:21:08] influence somebody else against what's
[2:21:10] being ministered and put it on uh
[2:21:13] whatever books they call it Facebook or
[2:21:14] everything else and you talk about it to
[2:21:17] somebody else you are guilty you need to
[2:21:20] repent
[2:21:23] because that's the very thing
[2:21:24] that remove the names
[2:21:28] one of the very things that removed the
[2:21:30] name from The Book of Life
[2:21:33] amen
[2:21:34] I can prove that to you I'll go right
[2:21:36] back to what the prophet said what I'm
[2:21:37] saying it for now because I hope there's
[2:21:39] a space to repent
[2:21:40] and get right
[2:21:42] don't you do it
[2:21:45] if you've got something you feel it's
[2:21:46] not little not right with somebody you
[2:21:48] go to prayer your Prophet told you to go
[2:21:50] to prayer not scatter it to everybody
[2:21:52] else now go pick up the pieces
[2:21:56] you broke his character you broke his
[2:21:58] influence over the people and you spread
[2:22:00] it to this one into that one and
[2:22:01] everything else
[2:22:03] and here's the damage
[2:22:05] you see
[2:22:07] you see where we're standing today
[2:22:09] be careful what you're doing let's judge
[2:22:12] the spirit
[2:22:14] of what motivates you to do what you're
[2:22:16] doing
[2:22:20] all right
[2:22:22] I think it was laid out real good by
[2:22:24] brother Chris Sunday about the parents
[2:22:26] the children or Wednesday excuse me of
[2:22:28] the children the parents
[2:22:30] amen
[2:22:33] you can see what I'm talking about
[2:22:35] these names taken away
[2:22:38] brother Chris said I felt to go a little
[2:22:40] deeper to that but then the Lord checked
[2:22:41] me
[2:22:44] amen why
[2:22:47] it isn't anything about the preachers
[2:22:50] it's about God as a headship over his
[2:22:53] body
[2:22:54] and he knows how you need to hear it
[2:22:55] somebody else can preach the same
[2:22:57] message to another church and deal with
[2:22:59] different needs
[2:23:04] all right now
[2:23:07] there's a lot of things you just okay
[2:23:10] and I'm going to close off here now so
[2:23:12] don't get unspotted don't get a spotted
[2:23:14] garment
[2:23:16] don't think you got a form of godliness
[2:23:19] silly women Laden with diver's lust
[2:23:22] ever learning but never able to come to
[2:23:24] the true knowledge of the truth ever
[2:23:26] learning
[2:23:27] ever learning knowledge
[2:23:30] intellectual learning and Satan talking
[2:23:33] to him and say well you know this is
[2:23:34] this makes sense this is reasonable
[2:23:38] yeah and it takes you exactly the way
[2:23:40] you're going off of the word and taking
[2:23:42] now another Direction
[2:23:44] able
[2:23:49] okay
[2:23:50] all right 1206 1965.
[2:23:57] there's many people just can't believe
[2:23:58] it message
[2:24:00] even Spirit-filled people and watch what
[2:24:03] he said
[2:24:05] I'm going to give you one that'll choke
[2:24:06] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't
[2:24:08] mean you're going in not at all not on
[2:24:10] that don't have anything to do with your
[2:24:12] soul
[2:24:15] all right he said that's the baptism see
[2:24:18] that's the baptism
[2:24:21] brother Branham in in 1205 65 that was
[2:24:24] 1206 this is on uh
[2:24:27] the message
[2:24:30] I have uh no things that are to be I got
[2:24:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that still
[2:24:34] has nothing to do with it that's only a
[2:24:36] temporal gift for you you've got to have
[2:24:39] it but that's temporal
[2:24:41] watch what the real gift is the real
[2:24:43] gift is your soul down in there
[2:24:45] that was born of God how is it born of
[2:24:47] God the seed would lay in there
[2:24:50] it was born of God and that controls the
[2:24:53] whole thing what does it control the
[2:24:54] whole thing too the word of God
[2:24:57] that inside will control you to the word
[2:24:59] of God so when you see something that's
[2:25:02] off the word Let It Go if you can't
[2:25:04] discern that then it's fruit you're
[2:25:06] bearing the wrong fruit
[2:25:07] it's not the word for the season that's
[2:25:10] your answer
[2:25:15] what's Satan trying to do take you down
[2:25:17] another Direction and you're going to
[2:25:19] come up short
[2:25:22] and you you think I've got I why I hear
[2:25:25] prophecy I prophesy yes you prophesy you
[2:25:28] can even prophesy truth
[2:25:31] it still doesn't make your soul right
[2:25:36] amen
[2:25:38] is that cast out Devils speak in tongues
[2:25:40] shout and dance and Hallelujah louder
[2:25:43] than any bride member could do
[2:25:45] and I'm not against any of that because
[2:25:47] the original
[2:25:49] is that
[2:25:51] but that's not the evidence
[2:25:55] God never said that was the evidence
[2:25:57] brother Branham in First Corinthians 12
[2:25:59] never said that these things you could
[2:26:01] do having those gifts working in the
[2:26:02] body he said I wish I could say that was
[2:26:04] the evidence but I can't
[2:26:09] amen go back and see what he said
[2:26:12] the reason you don't know what he said
[2:26:13] because you're not reading what he said
[2:26:15] you're not hearing what he said you're
[2:26:16] not feeding your soul and asking God to
[2:26:18] reveal it to you
[2:26:20] you're too busy with other things you're
[2:26:22] too busy in yourself you're too busy
[2:26:24] caught up in your own program
[2:26:28] your too self-centered you haven't died
[2:26:31] to self you've got to die to self
[2:26:34] completely to resurrect in a new birth
[2:26:39] amen
[2:26:41] the gift the real gift is that soul that
[2:26:43] was born of God the whole controls the
[2:26:45] whole thing to the word of God and the
[2:26:47] will of God and there you grow up there
[2:26:50] you grow up and your son and daughter of
[2:26:52] God you're a child of God and these
[2:26:53] things you come up like a mother you're
[2:26:55] now in the bottles of the earth trying
[2:26:57] to come forth and he said you're a Son
[2:26:59] of God coming forth and you see the word
[2:27:00] says I should do this I should be born
[2:27:02] again well I belong to church that don't
[2:27:05] mean one thing see well my My Method my
[2:27:08] mother and father were well let's make
[2:27:10] it what it message believers that's good
[2:27:13] for your mother that's good for your
[2:27:15] father well I'm Pentecostal I belong
[2:27:17] that if you don't line with that word
[2:27:19] there's something wrong then you see
[2:27:21] your real father ain't God because the
[2:27:23] real start in your soul before it was
[2:27:25] even a spirit it was your soul the soul
[2:27:27] didn't come from God if it wasn't a germ
[2:27:30] of God to begin with or a gene of God a
[2:27:32] seed of God you're deceived you're in a
[2:27:34] patch of weeds bearing the world's
[2:27:36] record of the weeds coming forth acting
[2:27:38] like the world loving the world is
[2:27:39] because you love of the love of God is
[2:27:41] Not In You
[2:27:43] and you're dabbling with the world
[2:27:45] you're mixing the world with the word
[2:27:50] amen I hope that's straight I want it to
[2:27:54] be straight
[2:27:55] all right
[2:27:58] look here
[2:28:00] he says in leadership
[2:28:02] your spirit he said can be anointed I
[2:28:04] just I haven't read that yet remember in
[2:28:06] that Spirit you can be baptized with the
[2:28:09] genuine spirit of God and still be lost
[2:28:12] it's the soul that lives that was
[2:28:15] ordained of God
[2:28:19] okay I'm gonna I'm gonna break that off
[2:28:23] I want you to turn to be the first
[2:28:25] Corinthians I'm going to go into this
[2:28:26] testimony and I know I'm late you're
[2:28:28] just going to have to you'll have to
[2:28:29] just love me
[2:28:33] and if you believe God's in control you
[2:28:35] will
[2:28:36] because I believe he is I do too I do
[2:28:39] amen all right
[2:28:44] and God knows how bad I want to get to
[2:28:45] the rest of this but I will in due time
[2:28:48] God knew all about it
[2:28:50] all right
[2:28:52] now First Corinthians
[2:28:55] foreign
[2:29:01] I've got I've got
[2:29:05] Jude five to go into Jude Matthew 7.
[2:29:08] there's a lot of other scriptures First
[2:29:10] Corinthians 10 1.
[2:29:13] see you can all you've all come through
[2:29:15] the we've come through the we've come
[2:29:17] through receiving a prophet we come
[2:29:18] through the baptism we come we we
[2:29:20] shouted at the other side of the baptism
[2:29:22] we came down through the Wilderness but
[2:29:24] when we come to Moab
[2:29:28] foreign
[2:29:31] idolaters that say why we ought to all
[2:29:33] come together what's wrong with
[2:29:35] Fellowship anyway aren't we supposed to
[2:29:36] love them
[2:29:43] I'm sorry people
[2:29:46] we just someone keeps pulling
[2:29:49] okay let's go back here and find out
[2:29:53] page 220.
[2:29:57] 6
[2:30:05] foreign
[2:30:24] so he planned away
[2:30:26] Balaam
[2:30:28] he formulated a plan that would force
[2:30:30] force Israel to force would force God to
[2:30:34] deal with Israel and death just as Satan
[2:30:36] knew he could single out even cause her
[2:30:38] to fall in fleshly sin thus God to pass
[2:30:42] judge pronounced sentence of death upon
[2:30:44] sin Balaam see he so his Doctrine the
[2:30:47] Bible said we didn't get into Jude yet
[2:30:49] but the doctrine of Balaam his teaching
[2:30:51] was false
[2:30:54] brother Branham in Matthew 24 24 why are
[2:30:57] they false prophets false teachers
[2:30:59] because their teaching is false
[2:31:02] not their anointing
[2:31:06] all right all right so he said so he
[2:31:10] planned a way to get them over and join
[2:31:12] in sin he went out he sent out
[2:31:14] invitations to come to the Feast of Baal
[2:31:16] peor which was an idolatrous Feast it
[2:31:18] was fornication
[2:31:20] it was an organized Church calling for
[2:31:23] the rest of them who were not organized
[2:31:25] just wanders so they said to see God
[2:31:28] from the top of the Rocks God said I see
[2:31:30] Israel I see him I see Christ I Behold
[2:31:33] Him to the people that dwell alone and
[2:31:35] shall not be reckoned among the Nations
[2:31:37] Israel could not be reckoned among those
[2:31:39] Nations they were on their way out
[2:31:42] and Nations to us is denominations
[2:31:46] it's an idolatrous spirit that began
[2:31:49] right in Eden
[2:31:50] and went through Cain's wives
[2:31:53] and even Cain
[2:31:56] had to go to the land of not to get his
[2:31:58] wife and it was his own sister you tell
[2:32:00] me where that Spirit went into her
[2:32:03] to marry a man
[2:32:06] that was a seat of the serpent
[2:32:09] where did that come it came from her
[2:32:10] mother Eve
[2:32:12] even though
[2:32:14] Adam was her father
[2:32:16] what about Jacob and Esau both righteous
[2:32:19] parents where did that spiritual seed
[2:32:21] come from I'm talking about spiritually
[2:32:23] now where'd that spiritual seed come
[2:32:25] from and Esau where'd that spiritual
[2:32:26] seed come from in the LA I've went to
[2:32:28] the Land of Nod and brother Branham said
[2:32:30] Cain had to marry his own sister
[2:32:32] were those children of men come from
[2:32:34] that that tempted the sons of God which
[2:32:37] was Seth
[2:32:40] into a fornication Spirit which was
[2:32:44] brought out Wednesday said it's a
[2:32:46] marrying which is a giving of seed
[2:32:51] all right
[2:32:53] what is wrong so he planned to get them
[2:32:55] to come over and join in sin he sent out
[2:32:57] invitations they don't think that was
[2:32:59] reasonable looking well I word don't
[2:33:00] have anything why we just got Moses look
[2:33:03] how reasonable this man is look at this
[2:33:05] looks reasonable this looks
[2:33:07] well it looks like the way to go we're
[2:33:10] all supposed to be one aren't we not
[2:33:12] that kind of one
[2:33:14] we're supposed to be one if God's in you
[2:33:16] and God and Me It's that kind of one
[2:33:18] all right what is wrong with Fellowship
[2:33:20] anyway we are supposed to love them
[2:33:22] aren't we come on over and worship with
[2:33:25] us what is wrong with Fellowship anyway
[2:33:27] we're supposed to love the army or how
[2:33:29] can we win them
[2:33:31] pretty reasonable isn't it
[2:33:34] but God's word calls for a total
[2:33:36] separation
[2:33:37] from unbelief
[2:33:40] are you going to take his word or are
[2:33:42] you going to take God's word
[2:33:44] you can take the devil's word or God's
[2:33:46] word
[2:33:48] that's just not one place
[2:33:50] he said that was never forgiven Israel
[2:33:52] for what they did they went and flirted
[2:33:54] with that spirit
[2:33:56] it's Spirits brother sister I thought
[2:33:58] that was brought out very good Wednesday
[2:33:59] it was Spirits it's not people it's
[2:34:01] spirits
[2:34:04] those Spirits are at work right here in
[2:34:06] this congregation
[2:34:08] those Spirits are at work in every
[2:34:09] congregation we have three kinds of
[2:34:12] believers
[2:34:13] but I'm telling you brother brownham
[2:34:15] said this he said that Anna 97 things if
[2:34:18] I ever think because of the the the uh
[2:34:20] the because of the maturity of that
[2:34:23] church will not put up with that thing
[2:34:25] sin he said ought to be called out
[2:34:29] and it will be not because I
[2:34:31] intellectually decided it's in God's
[2:34:33] time in God's season and in God's way
[2:34:36] but he will expose it
[2:34:41] amen
[2:34:44] okay
[2:34:46] all right so he said well well we're
[2:34:48] being friendly never hurt anyone or so
[2:34:52] they thought
[2:34:54] prophet's words but when they but when
[2:34:57] those sexy moored by this woman and sexy
[2:35:00] spiritually because they're sexy because
[2:35:02] they're bringing through a word that
[2:35:04] they've already rejected the truth
[2:35:05] turned against it got up and walked out
[2:35:07] a dominating female spirit
[2:35:11] against the truth
[2:35:13] and yet we think we have to fellowship
[2:35:15] with them why they're so nice I wonder
[2:35:17] what was said what was scattered around
[2:35:19] with them
[2:35:23] I just said watch out what you say
[2:35:28] because you can you can kill a man's
[2:35:32] character and influence
[2:35:34] preachers influence and character
[2:35:37] by just you're spreading around those
[2:35:39] imaginations and those little ideas that
[2:35:41] you have that's contrary to the word
[2:35:43] it's better to this person the other
[2:35:45] person this person oh you know well you
[2:35:47] know I you know they said this the other
[2:35:49] day and this well I wouldn't believe
[2:35:51] that way you know okay
[2:35:53] begin to dance and undress Whirled
[2:35:56] around doing their rock and roll and
[2:35:57] twists and and and and lust rose up in
[2:36:00] the Israelites this is natural but
[2:36:03] brother Branham said the the natural
[2:36:06] fornication is the same as spiritual
[2:36:09] fornication he said it's the same spirit
[2:36:12] he said idolatry is fornication
[2:36:17] spiritual fornication idolatry is
[2:36:21] anything that comes between you and the
[2:36:23] word even questionable things
[2:36:28] okay I know you're getting tired and I'm
[2:36:30] quitting but I'm going to read this
[2:36:32] testimony First Corinthians is what I
[2:36:34] told you to turn to First Corinthians

[2:37:02] and God comes along and says make you
[2:37:04] wait
[2:37:06] um
[2:37:07] gets me I don't like that preacher
[2:37:09] because he preaches so long
[2:37:13] really
[2:37:16] where are you going you stand out there
[2:37:18] in that foyer out there a half hour and
[2:37:19] talk
[2:37:21] you go out there to the rest of what you
[2:37:23] do
[2:37:25] all right I know I know that stings you
[2:37:27] go to a ball game you don't think of
[2:37:29] three hours
[2:37:31] or a basketball game or a football game
[2:37:34] this is feeding your soul and your flesh
[2:37:36] hates it
[2:37:37] is the problem
[2:37:42] nice well
[2:37:43] say what it is all right now let's go
[2:37:47] over to what he said here
[2:37:49] closing I even have it written down
[2:37:51] closing I'm far from it but all right
[2:37:56] 63 evening of 63 6 30 Evening of 63.
[2:38:01] paragraph 223 they cut their hair wear
[2:38:04] the worldly clothes walk out in the
[2:38:05] street like that and God's Bible warns
[2:38:07] against it even forbids a woman to even
[2:38:09] pray with bobbed hair
[2:38:13] and and says that a man she does that
[2:38:16] she claims herself to her husband that
[2:38:18] she's immoral she claims to herself if
[2:38:20] she cuts her hair listen I'm going to
[2:38:22] read it in just a minute
[2:38:24] I cuts her hair Bobs her hair she claims
[2:38:28] to her husband that she's immoral
[2:38:30] herself and he has a perfect right to
[2:38:33] give her a divorce and send her away
[2:38:34] from him that's exactly right the word
[2:38:37] of God saying that and a woman hear that
[2:38:39] and continue to wear short hair and then
[2:38:41] call herself a Christian
[2:38:44] and dress in clothes that are so tight
[2:38:47] that it shows everything about you why
[2:38:50] do you do it because there's a spirit of
[2:38:53] lust in there
[2:38:55] that causes you to do it he said bless
[2:38:58] God will never hear that preacher again
[2:39:00] do what you want to do
[2:39:02] they didn't want to hear Brother Brown
[2:39:04] them again either
[2:39:05] and you hear the same thing
[2:39:08] but when a preacher comes down and lives
[2:39:10] among you and starts bringing it oh he
[2:39:13] had no right to say that
[2:39:16] all right
[2:39:19] look it is that my motive to tear you
[2:39:21] down no to awaken you
[2:39:25] if God told you about it isn't he have
[2:39:27] to turn around and then forgive you with
[2:39:29] it when there's still Mercy if you know
[2:39:31] what's right
[2:39:33] let's not be iniquitous
[2:39:36] all right
[2:39:37] First Corinthians 11 1.
[2:39:41] this scripture is very seldom ever read
[2:39:43] again but I want you to know something
[2:39:45] in this first Corinthians I got second
[2:39:48] here first Corinthians 11.
[2:39:51] now I praise you brother and that you
[2:39:53] remember me in all things and keep the
[2:39:55] ordinances as I have delivered them to
[2:39:57] you
[2:39:59] what's an ordinance communion is an
[2:40:01] ordinance foot Washings and ordinance
[2:40:04] I've delivered these ordinances now you
[2:40:06] keep them as I've delivered them but I
[2:40:08] would have you to know that the head of
[2:40:09] every man is Christ and the head of
[2:40:12] every woman is who
[2:40:14] okay and the head
[2:40:16] of Christ is God
[2:40:20] every man praying or prophesying with
[2:40:23] his head covered dishonor his head well
[2:40:27] bless God I shouldn't wear a hat that's
[2:40:28] not talking about hats that's talking
[2:40:31] about uncut hair
[2:40:33] uncut hair
[2:40:36] okay A man should cut his hair
[2:40:39] you cut his hair it's not long
[2:40:42] hello women if you cut your hair even
[2:40:45] trim it
[2:40:46] you might as well shave it
[2:40:49] because it cuts your hair
[2:40:52] is defying headship
[2:40:55] you you said I'm not under the headship
[2:40:58] of my husband
[2:40:59] I defy his headship and you defy Christ
[2:41:02] to cut your hair it's no longer long
[2:41:06] I'm talking about just trim it
[2:41:10] that's the testimony I want to come to
[2:41:12] in a moment
[2:41:13] I'm leading up to this
[2:41:15] okay
[2:41:16] but every woman that prayeth or
[2:41:18] prophesied with her head uncovered
[2:41:21] dishonest her head for that is even all
[2:41:24] one as if she were shaven so uncover it
[2:41:28] means to cut it
[2:41:31] okay for a man indeed ought to cover
[2:41:35] no excuse me affordable woman be not
[2:41:37] covered let her be also her also be
[2:41:41] shorn
[2:41:42] see there it is if it be a shame for a
[2:41:45] woman to be shorn or shaven let her be
[2:41:47] covered for a man indeed ought not to
[2:41:50] cover her his head for so much as he is
[2:41:52] the image and glory of God but the woman
[2:41:54] is the glory of the man
[2:41:58] neither was the Man created for the
[2:42:00] woman but the woman for the man
[2:42:02] amen for this cause ought to women to
[2:42:05] have power on her head because of the
[2:42:09] angels I want you to hold that tight
[2:42:11] that scripture it'll be in this
[2:42:13] testimony
[2:42:14] for as the women as the woman is of the
[2:42:17] man even so the man also by the woman
[2:42:20] but all things of God
[2:42:23] see for the woman is of the man it was
[2:42:25] she was she an Adam
[2:42:27] even as the man also then is by how'd
[2:42:31] you get here
[2:42:33] what the woman come out for she was a
[2:42:35] man with a womb she was to Bear another
[2:42:37] Adam
[2:42:39] but what she yield to
[2:42:42] see okay another seed adulterous she
[2:42:46] bowed she reverenced another word
[2:42:49] besides her husband's word God's word
[2:42:53] are you with me and when she did that it
[2:42:56] was idolatrous
[2:42:57] anything that comes between you and that
[2:42:59] word is an idolatrous spirit
[2:43:02] you need to wake up to that Paul said
[2:43:05] flee idolatry First Corinthians 10 last
[2:43:07] verse
[2:43:09] okay
[2:43:11] now let's get over here
[2:43:14] so nevertheless neither is a man without
[2:43:16] the woman see you can't have a man
[2:43:18] without being both masculine and
[2:43:20] feminist neither the woman without the
[2:43:22] man
[2:43:24] in the Lord
[2:43:26] so you see I hope you catch all that I
[2:43:28] don't have time to go into it for as the
[2:43:30] woman is of the man even so the man also
[2:43:32] by the woman
[2:43:35] judge in yourselves is it comely or
[2:43:37] seemingly comely
[2:43:39] I was going to mark that down what that
[2:43:41] meant but anyway is it comely or
[2:43:44] seemingly or or or right just that a
[2:43:47] woman pray to God uncovered unto God
[2:43:50] uncovered
[2:43:52] doth not even nature itself teach you
[2:43:54] that if a man have long hair it's a
[2:43:55] shame unto him but if a woman have long
[2:43:58] hair it is a glory to her
[2:44:01] now look at this it is a glory and to
[2:44:05] her for her hair is given to her for a
[2:44:09] covering
[2:44:11] so air is their covering and then you
[2:44:14] cut it you cut your glory
[2:44:18] all right now
[2:44:22] page 238 of the church age book
[2:44:30] page 238 Church age book paragraph seven
[2:44:34] that is why a woman cannot wear that
[2:44:36] which pertaineth to a man
[2:44:39] excuse me let me back up here just a
[2:44:41] minute
[2:44:43] the woman that is truly female
[2:44:44] all-female
[2:44:46] will want to be submissive to the mail
[2:44:48] that is commanded of her
[2:44:51] she will be of that disposition she will
[2:44:53] not be a doormat not a doormat no real
[2:44:55] male makes a female a doormat but she
[2:44:58] will want to be under Authority and not
[2:45:00] rule over the mail for he is the head of
[2:45:02] the house if she breaks then you are
[2:45:04] responsible if your wife's doing
[2:45:06] something that is not right you are
[2:45:08] going to answer for your home man listen
[2:45:11] to me
[2:45:12] you're going to answer for it
[2:45:15] that's why you better start applying the
[2:45:17] token
[2:45:18] you better talk the word and start
[2:45:20] applying it well I walk with God then
[2:45:22] apply the token that's him
[2:45:26] and the token must be on display
[2:45:31] and it has to be applied
[2:45:33] to be on display
[2:45:35] all right now
[2:45:38] for she is the head for for he is the
[2:45:41] head of the house if she breaks that
[2:45:42] image that God made for her she is
[2:45:44] perverted any male that lets the woman
[2:45:47] take authority has also broken the image
[2:45:49] and he is perverted
[2:45:52] that is why a woman cannot wear that
[2:45:54] which pertaineth to a man why she's
[2:45:57] entered into man's domain
[2:45:59] she's usurping Authority
[2:46:02] all right and and pertaineth to a man or
[2:46:05] cut her hair she is never to wear
[2:46:06] garments that pertain to a male or cut
[2:46:09] her hair when she does just pertain to
[2:46:11] it let alone pants just wear some that
[2:46:13] pertains
[2:46:15] all right
[2:46:17] and when a woman invades the pulpit
[2:46:19] which she's commanded she must not do
[2:46:21] she shows what Spirit she's of being a
[2:46:23] dominating female is Antichrist and the
[2:46:26] seeds of the Roman Catholic Church which
[2:46:28] are in her though she may deny this ever
[2:46:30] so vehemently when it comes to the word
[2:46:33] let God Be True in every man's word a
[2:46:36] lie
[2:46:39] who caused the fall a byproduct of the
[2:46:42] man
[2:46:44] she's guilty of the transgression
[2:46:47] that's why she's no longer equal to a
[2:46:49] man she's putting on a different
[2:46:51] position now the man will rule over her
[2:46:56] be careful that that denominational
[2:46:58] Spirit don't come sweeping on in and you
[2:47:01] just suddenly say I don't believe and
[2:47:02] don't care about what my husband said
[2:47:04] I'll do what I want to do
[2:47:09] okay all right now page 394 lady Lucian
[2:47:15] church that was in that was in the
[2:47:16] thyatiron church age we could say a lot
[2:47:19] about that page 394 of the ladocian
[2:47:21] church age
[2:47:25] now I know you ladies don't like the
[2:47:27] kind of preaching this kind of preaching
[2:47:29] he said
[2:47:31] but sister you're dead wrong in what
[2:47:32] you're doing the Bible forbid you to cut
[2:47:34] your hair
[2:47:36] God gave it for recovering he gave a
[2:47:39] command to you to wear it long it is
[2:47:41] your glory when you cut your cut cut
[2:47:43] your hair you signify that you've left
[2:47:46] the headship of your husband like Eve
[2:47:48] you walked out and went on your own
[2:47:52] you need to repent and come back to God
[2:47:56] okay
[2:48:02] I want to read this to you
[2:48:04] it's quite striking and I hope it stirs
[2:48:06] all it stirred me
[2:48:08] I want to I want to get this to you here
[2:48:13] this testimony was given on 329 of 18.
[2:48:18] I won't give the sister's name I can
[2:48:20] give it to you personally if you'd like
[2:48:22] but I don't think it's necessary to give
[2:48:24] her name
[2:48:25] but it is a true testimony
[2:48:28] and it's called the importance of long
[2:48:30] hair
[2:48:32] it was early in 2007 when I became very
[2:48:35] tempted to cut my hair although I knew
[2:48:38] it was wrong and that I've been taught
[2:48:40] that long hair in the Bible means uncut
[2:48:42] hair
[2:48:44] at that time in my life I was struggling
[2:48:46] with a few worldly things and several
[2:48:49] sisters I knew had begun to trim their
[2:48:52] hair and I heard every excuse as to why
[2:48:56] it was okay so I eventually decided I
[2:49:00] would trim my hair but when I went to do
[2:49:02] it I felt so convicted thank God
[2:49:06] that I decided I would first ask God to
[2:49:09] clearly show me if I should cut it at
[2:49:12] all and if he didn't answer me I would
[2:49:15] cut my hair the following week
[2:49:18] look what she did know she went to God
[2:49:23] okay now God's not going to tell you to
[2:49:25] do something you're prophet and the word
[2:49:27] said no new
[2:49:31] okay I think it was two days later I had
[2:49:35] a dream where a man was chasing me with
[2:49:38] a knife
[2:49:39] and had me cornered and tried to stab me
[2:49:42] but was unable to touch me with it
[2:49:45] though he was stabbing wildly towards me
[2:49:48] then a voice said to me he can't touch
[2:49:51] you because you have uncut hair
[2:49:55] the next night I had another dream I saw
[2:49:58] myself holding scissors about to cut my
[2:50:01] hair and all her and all around and all
[2:50:04] around Angels were crying and pleading
[2:50:07] for me not to cut it saying they only
[2:50:10] have authority to protect me if my hair
[2:50:13] is uncut
[2:50:17] I want you to remember that scripture in
[2:50:19] verse 10. I told you to remember
[2:50:23] I suddenly realized though I can't write
[2:50:26] it in the words in Words what it would
[2:50:29] mean in the Unseen spiritual world if I
[2:50:32] cut my hair and I started screaming at
[2:50:34] myself don't cut it
[2:50:39] please don't cut it and needless to say
[2:50:42] I didn't cut it
[2:50:46] about three to four weeks after this it
[2:50:49] was a strangely quiet afternoon at work
[2:50:52] I work in our family business the knife
[2:50:55] shop selling knives at about 4 pm there
[2:50:59] wasn't a person in sight when a drunk
[2:51:01] crazed man staggered in swelling
[2:51:04] swearing and shouting that he was going
[2:51:07] to stab me and kill me he was very
[2:51:10] worked up and angry and used extreme
[2:51:12] foul language I looked at him and
[2:51:15] suddenly realized that this was the same
[2:51:17] man who had unsuccessfully tried to stab
[2:51:20] me in my dream
[2:51:22] and I felt such a peace and just looked
[2:51:25] straight at him knowing he could do
[2:51:28] absolutely nothing to hurt me
[2:51:30] he suddenly went all nervous and ran out
[2:51:34] a few seconds later he walked back in
[2:51:36] and said sorry about that lady and then
[2:51:39] left
[2:51:42] it's just the grace of God to have
[2:51:44] prevented me from cutting off my
[2:51:46] god-given protection when I was already
[2:51:49] determined to cut my hair praise the
[2:51:52] Lord a couple of years after this I was
[2:51:55] walking home from work
[2:51:57] the route I took was one I had
[2:52:01] walked many times before and the
[2:52:03] majority of it was along busy roads and
[2:52:06] out in the open but there are a few
[2:52:08] secluded sections at one of these
[2:52:11] sections I came across a man standing in
[2:52:13] the middle of
[2:52:14] of path
[2:52:16] her path with a dog which I had to walk
[2:52:19] past as soon as I got right by them
[2:52:22] three other men jumped out from behind
[2:52:24] the bushes and I was surrounded
[2:52:27] at first I was really terrified because
[2:52:30] I knew they planned this attack on
[2:52:32] someone and it just happened to be me
[2:52:35] but then I felt a power on my head
[2:52:39] and I realized that they couldn't harm
[2:52:41] me at all because I have uncut hair and
[2:52:45] all fear left me
[2:52:47] I pushed the dog out of the way and
[2:52:50] continued walking on and they just
[2:52:52] stared at me as if they couldn't really
[2:52:54] move
[2:52:55] as soon as I got out of their sight I
[2:52:57] ran all the way home rejoicing and
[2:53:00] praising the Lord
[2:53:02] First Corinthians 11 10 for this cause
[2:53:04] the woman for this cause ought the woman
[2:53:07] to have power on her head because of the
[2:53:10] Angels
[2:53:11] let's Stand Together
[2:53:18] all it takes it takes brother sister you
[2:53:20] say why'd you read that Brother David
[2:53:21] well number one is because the holy
[2:53:23] spirit said to read it and number two
[2:53:26] just takes one word is all it takes
[2:53:28] disobeyed
[2:53:32] you can even give in your heart the Lord
[2:53:34] been baptized all come through it
[2:53:36] Sanctified but all it takes is one word
[2:53:39] of Disobedience I don't believe it and
[2:53:42] walk away from it
[2:53:43] what happens
[2:53:46] I pray this won't happen
[2:53:48] but they fall away
[2:53:51] and the Bible says in Hebrews 6 never
[2:53:54] to come to repentance again
[2:53:59] be careful we're not playing with the
[2:54:01] church
[2:54:03] let's take this to Heart
[2:54:05] if there's a sister here or even a
[2:54:08] husband that will allow his wife to do
[2:54:09] it you're guilty too
[2:54:12] but now because the word has come to you
[2:54:16] you have the you have a chance by grace
[2:54:19] to repent
[2:54:20] God would have never told you you're
[2:54:22] wrong
[2:54:23] if he didn't know and he'd give you a
[2:54:26] space to repent
[2:54:31] leave your hair alone
[2:54:34] he said well the dirt the dryer you can
[2:54:36] take every reason you want to take but
[2:54:38] don't you put a scissors to your hair
[2:54:40] again
[2:54:41] you keep off of trimming those ends
[2:54:44] uncut hair is the same as having it off
[2:54:49] and shaven
[2:54:51] it's not long so it's not length that
[2:54:54] determines what long hair is it's uncut
[2:54:59] because there's our brother David knows
[2:55:02] in the mission field there's a lot of
[2:55:03] women that can't grow their hair hardly
[2:55:05] over that or that or whatever but they
[2:55:08] don't cut it you know what that God
[2:55:10] God's eyes she's covered
[2:55:15] and the angels are here to protect those
[2:55:17] that stay with the word
[2:55:19] are you with me
[2:55:22] you go out of the grasp of the word of
[2:55:24] God
[2:55:25] and you're in trouble
[2:55:27] there's a lot of things we could have
[2:55:29] said and I apologize I'd sincerely do
[2:55:31] for taking so long that I can't say
