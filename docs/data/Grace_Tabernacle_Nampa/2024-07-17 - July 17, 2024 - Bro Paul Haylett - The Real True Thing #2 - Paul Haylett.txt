simply makes me tired to be immersed in the world it just wears on you there's so many things you see and you hear and the Very nature of behavior of humanity in this day but by God's grace we have Refuge that we can come into and and uh be safe and feel Comfort amen God bless you brother Phil so good to see you my brother amen hallelujah yeah I you know sometimes you just don't remember we certainly want to remember sister Sue brother Trevor sister Carrie uh brother Sergey is on the road I believe brother vasile be on the road um I was very happy to hear that uh sister Nadia uh senior is how I often identif that was in church this last Sunday and so the Lord touching her in her body from the surgery and stuff so just very happy to hear that and happy even though we're just a kind of a sparse group tonight so happy to see each and every one of you amen Let's uh I want to speak to you once again kind of a part two real true thing thank you musicians you play so beautifully tonight amen and brother Alex I appreciate the song Service uh spoke to my heart just certain thoughts that that we think on Amen the Lord's faithful and true the real true thing amen we took that from um uh a quotation um brought that out of a quotation brother brandham says and uh I want to speak to you tonight on the Scarecrow is placed at the real thing amen and um it will be kind of self- exlan an atory as we go into the word if you'll turn this evening to Matthew 13 uh verse 24-30 and then verses 37- 40 and we'll just draw a a little foundation for our thought and U he says like this another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is like un to a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and SED tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit now it wasn't when the blade just come up but it's when it come to the season of bringing forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir D thou not so good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tears and I want to interject this real quick my brother and sister the world has such a a watered down or loose view of John 3:16 that um it's almost in their world you if you go to church you have fulfilled John 3:16 but we recognize that it goes much deeper than that there is a personal commitment to our lord Jesus himself not to our church I I I hope this doesn't shock you but I've been watching some documentaries on people who have come out of different churches different religions and and I find it quite interesting uh that you look and and um people come out but in these documentaries very few of them actually go into uh you might say a church or or a body of Believers that's much different than what they came out of and uh so they'll say we've been delivered we've been set free but they have just turned and brother brandom deals with this and we won't go into it in depth but they just turned and went to another and uh they're never really found absolute true deliverance from the spirit of the age and so you know it's there that uh uh we're not looking my brother and sister to convert the tear this is something that people sometimes get questionable about John 3:16 because they think that we're here to convert the world but the prophet of God himself says that um they won't hear it so sounds a little harsh doesn't it basically it's just saying there's a huge chunk of the the populace that will will never hear it and yet we're called to live the gospel and present the gospel to each and every one as though they are seed and uh that's how we should approach it we shouldn't be the one trying to judge so you look and see how this is uh he said uh unto them an enemy hath done this the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and I can tell you at the harvest season you can tell the difference between the wheat and The Tear and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn verse 37 he says answered and said unto them he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the wor the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one so taking them right back and tying them to can seed taking them right back to the very beginning of the wicked one the enemy that Seth them is the devil and the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so it shall be in the end of this world Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity to come into your house today and while many are not here tonight father we come together father not to socialize but to gather in your presence and we thank you Lord your promise of being here and we know it's true it's fulfilled in our lives you are here tonight and Lord we ask you to bless each and every one that are here and those father maybe listening in maybe circumstances kept them from the house of God tonight but Lord we ask you to be with them and lead them and guide them we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now I think we can take this and and see from the natural in the spiritual uh and tie that together as we go tonight so I don't have to spend too much time making each one of these correlations but there is a lot of seed sown amen and in that good seed is strong and full of vigor and and you know when you have good seed because it immediately shows an Evidence of strength and growth uh everything about it shows that it it is doing well and Bad Seed which is low germination often times is a sign uh in the natural bad color slow growth all of these things are are a sign of Bad Seed and my brother and sisters we'll take this into the context of what we are drawing our thought from tonight we'll see that in this realm that the difference of the good seed and bad seed is not evident at the moment the seed is planted it is there it's not not obvious but we will find that as time goes on there is a lot of times that we will as as uh especially those in the ministry we we'll see people and it seems like you know that God starts to do something they get over into maybe a certain movement or group or Fellowship and and they just don't appear to be doing so well it's not really what we would would desire for them but remember sometimes God just allows uh those things to go and and they uh take place and and it appears that it's went a different way but then there's a hunger and thirst in that individual or family that draws them out of that because it's not us against them it's not our church against their church it's us and we are standing for the word which you might say it's us against the devil but even then it's not really us it's the word amen that is against the devil we we are not going to conquer Satan of ourselves but the word that is in us and so we'll see how that God will take and allow people to go sometime for years and then he starts working on them and and they find themselves with a great desire to be in the house of God a great desire to hear the word preached a great desire to dig in and and uh find it for themselves you might say and you know The Bad Seed amen they can handle watered down theological teaching low Vigor they they just it doesn't bother them they can be in the house of God and and say you know what that was good enough for me today but U my brother and sister the seed of discrepancy the prophet of God talking about that the seed of discrepancy is the same looking seed even you might say has the same genetic background but that seed was never called to bring forth a h hundredfold that seed is unable to produce what is desired of it and so that seed of discrepancy H it is there it appears to be so a perfect example in the natural is to have Wild Oats growing amongst your oats uh you don't know it until the head has completely come out that the wild oat is there but we'll look and see my brother and sister as the prophet of God so clearly shows us and the word shows it so clearly that it appears so close it you see it in a field a as it's growing in the vegetative state and it's all nice and green and dark green and Broad leaves and it's just growing waving in the wind all worshiping but yet when the head comes forth and I hope you can make that correlation yourself we won't dwell on it when the head comes forth and shows itself in evidence that's when each plant each seed really shows what it is not until the head comes forth I say my brother and sister to keep this short tonight I've left a lot of things out but my brother and sister the head has come amen it's in our midst and we see what it is and it's bringing forth and showing us who we literally are amen not figurative not some kind of analogy but it is showing literally who we are in Jesus Christ amen some people get all nervous I'll touch on that in a minute they get all nervous about this I don't want to be deceived but my brother and sister tonight we're going to be talking about some scarecrows and I read this standing in the Gap uh I read this last Wednesday amen I believe I did yes we have a lot of impersonations we have people that get up and try to act like Christians and their lives don't compare so there is something wrong Jesus said by their fruits you'll know them see that's how you know a Christian by how he lives don't ever jump any higher than you live so then just now look my brother and sister we might get disappointed in looking at ourself of not trying to jump any higher than we live and we think oh my sometimes I I probably just need to keep my feet on the ground amen but look at what the prophet of God says but in that so he's catching this and tying it back into that but in that it's a devil making a scarecrow to keep the real genuine believer away from the true thing of it amen so what is Satan doing he's using our own flesh our own thoughts and emotions against us as a scarecrow to keep us from stepping into that word and stepping into that promise hindering us from from taking the full power of the word but God help us to separate and to be able to discern between right and wrong and I say yes Lord help us and the word will always straighten that out I say thank you Lord for the fact that the word amen we're not here for a theology we're here for the word and the word is going to keep us straight I say thank you Lord that it straightens us out some people say well the word is pretty Sharp pretty hard that hurt a little bit thank God for that it's keeping us lined up amen and so we move forward I say thank you Lord because I know that if it hadn't been for the Lord I'd be really messed up but he keeps straightening us up now the Devil he's pretty clever he likes nothing better than to cause you to limit yourself the scripture says if your heart condemns you not what does Satan do he tries to jump in there he uses the word it comes we don't accept it in quite the right fashion or or we're we're struggling in that and all of a sudden we're limiting ourself I can't tell you how many times through the years that people have not taken communion over things that all they needed to do is stop and say Lord forgive for me for that and then step forward and take communion and draw the strength from communion to press forward but Satan gets them in such a position so bound up that all they can see is the mistake that they made and then they hinder themselves instead of repentance they hold and pull themselves in kind of like the turtle you know why Turtles don't go very far because every time they sense there's a threat they pull back into themselves and they don't keep on walk walking amen that's why Turtles are slow well my brother and sister we want to be Sons and Daughters of God and when we realize that there's a threat as it were we want to just walk right into the word walk right into the presence of God not pull our head in our legs back in and say well I'll just not do anything no we need to stand up and say Lord there's an altar there's blood I want to be there I want to be right and so many people hinder themselves when it comes to communion because of that so Satan loves to cause you to limit yourself amen now my brother and sister this is kind of a I'll give you just the briefest of explanation here I've been recently contacted by what appears to be a denominational uh uh Minister from Tanzania and and he wants us to support his Outreach into the the bush and and um you know we don't know anything about him he's looking for that but on his little um uh uh deal there with some words that struck me very very uh uh just very direct and underneath his little deal it says faith has no reverse Hallelujah we got nowhere to go backwards to my brother and sister we were called to go back in other words we've never been equipped with reverse as Christians amen so by God's grace now now if Satan can get us to go back up on the word then what are we backslid amen but you see if we cannot go back on the word then Satan has no power over us amen he is completely limited when we don't back up amen when we stand our ground stand on the spot I don't care if it's something maybe in your own personal life I don't care if it's in your marriage I don't care if it's with your children or whatever the issue is if we don't back up on the word then God is there to stand behind his word because he's never walked away from his word he's never let his words fall to the ground he's never let a promise go unfulfilled and if we don't back up that means those promises are going to come to pass not a hope so but they will absolutely come to pass because that's God's word amen and so you see if we don't backslide or back up on the word see it's not about it's not about uh you and I my brother and sister it's about the word too many people they they get well I I have this and I have that I feel spiritual or or whatever it might be my brother and sister it's not about how we feel it's about the word amen we're not the primary factor the word is amen and we need to stay in the word amen that's our refuge that's our count to hide in amen now in identification of Christ in all ages we look here got quite a few quotes tonight I hope you don't mind amen Heavenly Father we're grateful to see the Risen Messiah 1900 years of all kinds of Theology and movements amen I've been studying on movements so that might be a little bit why we have this quote here but still it it it's applicable but still in the darkness of all of it you promis that you would appear here in the last days in this Sodom day and you would make yourself known to the children of Abraham the called the elected and here you are tonight after 19900 years you're just as much alive tonight as you was when you talked to the woman at the well can we say Amen to that it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride is there any bride here tonight that means God is manifested in our flesh here tonight now I'm not expecting some great reaction don't misunderstand me but I can tell you when you work hard and bust a few Knuckles during the day you come to church you don't always feel like God's in your flesh do you have those kind of days yeah you don't feel like how could it be God in this flesh well my brother and sister he felt that before you felt that he was tested in every way that we are tested so he knows exactly what it feels like to be weary and discouraged and have things go wrong and and you know it just seems like it it's not there he knows but he still chose your flesh I say thank you Lord tonight thank you Lord Lord that you would choose us tonight now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the same self flesh these two are one amen I love that my brother and sister you talk about something in other words I know I will never satisfy this I know that you can never satisfy this but Christ in you will be Victorious and overcome and satisfy this word amen it's not us alone but is us with our bridegroom amen and the church is becoming the bride all the time by her works and her labors and her struggle and her knowledge oh did I misread that quote by believing the word this is a Works gospel do you know that some people would go whoa whoa whoa not a Works gospel it is a Works gospel and the work is you believing the word there's the work it's not how good you've been how much you gave to the poor or whatever you've done my brother and sister it's believing the word so that the word and the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign God identifying himself the word in the church so we got to get the word inside this building see that's not the church God's looking for you are the church you are the body that he's put himself in and then he's looking down on that and saying I'll bless them because my word is in them and yet he's the one who put the word in us but he blesses us for having the word in us now that's a win-win if I've ever heard one amen where he does the work he makes the way he provides everything and then blesses us for receiving amen oh thank you Lord hallelujah amen you see it's not so much how much we can quote now I know it seems like I'm not on my subject but it is amen it's not how much we can quote come on Saints I I've known men that I knew personally could quote quote quote but I'll be honest with you uh they're unnamed so I'm not judging them I wouldn't trust them with a dollar but could quote this message is that what we're looking for no it's not how much we can quote it's what we can live what he in us can live out that's what he's looking for he's not looking for our abilities or natural or the IQ you know I I I me being on the opposite end of this spectrum uh forgive me for using this as a little analogy but um if it was about how much we could quote I'd be lost because you see uh I can read something and 10 minutes later I have a hard time repeating the exact words of it I don't know if you're like that we know there's some Minds out there that that can uh read something a week ago and quote it word by word right now amen I knew a kid in high school could quote the whole Gettysburg DRFT and I forget what the other deal was see I forgot but he could quote those word for word perfect pause in the punctuation and I got past line two and the rest got fuzzy and I flunked that in class in history but it's us so immersed in the word till we have become the word that's what God's looking for be immersed in the word that it becomes it soaks in and becomes our very I of our being you know there's so many different things um I I'll just use this as a little uh carnal uh comparison but you take lacker thinner I painted for many years was a little bit sloppy about my health and and I it has affected me but you take lacquer thinner and you put your hand in a bucket of lacquer thinner pause and then pull it out and in 7 Seconds Locker thinner is in your bloodstream and then your kidneys your liver your brain your heart all have to deal with the effect of lacquer thinner it's nowhere listed in the healthy guide but if in the natural lacquer thinner would do that and enter into your bloodstream so quickly how much more so we as Sons and Daughters of God immersing ourselves in the word of God will come in and affect every phase every attribute everything about our life he comes in if we will pause long enough to let it in Hallelujah now I'm working Along on this okay if you don't mind we're getting there in the seven Church ages the sman church age chapter 4 uh brother Brown shares this and uh it it's just very interesting to me because I'd had some thoughts along in this come out uh this quote why just a few weeks ago I read an editorial an unsaved businessman not by a Christian he said that he was amazed at the churches he could not understand them they had seminaries filled with professors who taught the word of God in order to destroy it I personally in my inquisitive mind was looking at some teachings of a certain man here recently big audience 10,000 people in the in the auditorium and he makes a statement now if these words talking about the Bible if these words are true let's not put that kind of language in our mouth if this be true he went on to to say this is so miraculous beyond anything that we can comprehend and I thought as I was listening to this truly it is beyond what humans can comprehend but it's not above God's mind in you and I it's not above him giving us Revelation to understand what it is to stand in Heavenly places what it is to be so filled with the power of God they could boil you in oil and can't kill you they could throw you in Fire and can't kill you they can do everything they want to do and they can't harm you the Viper can bite you and it won't harm you it is beyond the human comprehension and they would look at that and say if that was a certain kind of Viper there's no way he shook it off and lived but that's because they're approaching it without the Holy Ghost they're approaching it in a carnal realm they're approaching it the scarecrow has said and they don't believe it can go beyond what the scarecrow has said they had seminaries filled with professors who taught the word of God in order to destroy it now then this man could not figure that out he was appalled by it and rightly so he said that he could understand the atheist or communist or freethinker or someone else doing that but when the church itself destroyed the word of God it was Tatam out to premeditated murder now imagine these Souls that would be there under that influence and say it doesn't matter God doesn't care it's unimportant that's premeditated murder they're sending those souls to hell because a scarecrow in a fine suit in a building or in this day it would be more like ripped jeans in a muscle shirt got to have a nice big gold cross right because a gold cross makes you a Christian amen if that's the case half the mafia are are saved but my brother and sister see when they look at that and they are doing what have they done they've killed their soul it will take the grace of God to break down the influence of that uh uh scarecrow that has been put out there my brother and sister you know I think we a little exercise right the scripture says that it profiteth little doesn't say it doesn't profit that's fine but when you have a whole world that's attracted to a culture of guys standing up there you know and you you know sorry for putting it this way you know how these guys look all pumped up before they they go out in public or do whatever they just don't walk around like that all the way they go in a gym room somewhere and they pump some iron for a little while and get the blood flow and they walk out with these big bulging muscles that tells you these men premeditated to come out looking like they look they didn't go into a back room and get down on their knees and pray and come out with some spiritual muscle to share with the body of Believers to encourage and strengthen them they come out to impress with a world carnal view that would cause them why because it's of the wicked one it becomes a scarecrow when the church gets away from the word it will believe oh let me move back up but when the church itself destroyed the word of God it was Tatam out to premeditated murder there is your hybrid religion wake up America before it's too late when the church Church gets away from the word it will believe anything Grace Tabernacle we ever get away from the word we will start believing anything amen the word is our security the word is our strength the word is our defense the word is our very life and there is no other life in this leoan age that will give to us what we need amen but the word will amen it's it is like Eve and when Cain was born she said I've gotten a man from the Lord now do you realize that she really meant that see see where Eve was at so deceived so caught up in that deception that scarecrow had been put out there that this was of God I have just went and and had a relationship with a man who is whole stated intention is to destroy the word of God and I'm going to declare that was from God God look where it's at my brother and sister watered down Theology and it makes them feel good so they say it's from God and they believe amen once she'd been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the word of God she then thought that whatever she said was right if she said that she had a man uh from God then she had a man from God but God has set laws in his universe and I'll tell you I'm going to say this it's kind of strong words forgive me but I'm going to go ahead and say it there's men that come in and read into the message what they want to read into the message and they have gone around the world preaching and they believe everything that they're saying even though the message won't back it up and their Bible won't back it up but they declare it to be fact where does that Spirit come from we have it right here the prophet documenting where that Spirit come from it didn't come out of the word so there's only one other place it can come from but they believe it so strongly that they get adamant and argue and stand and and their veins just bulge over their this is it my brother and sister but it won't line up with the word sorry for venting a good seed can only bring forth good fruit an evil seed can only bring forth only evil fruit now each seed though different will utilize the same Earth nourishment moisture Sunshine but will bring forth after its own kind notice the history of the can line notice the history of the Seth line only one difference between them the Original Seed and nothing else oh that's getting close my brother and sister Original Seed is the only difference between those two lines amen hallelujah are we doing okay in this world have you ever seen someone go out in an empty weed fi filled field and put up a scarecrow there's nothing there there's thistle and puncture Vine and kosa nobody's going to go out there and put up a scarecrow in that empty field so we look at this and see natural typing spiritual amen you won't find a scarecrow unless there's something good there now I want you to look at this I find this funny you probably all know who charity Gil is right she some kind of Pentecostal I think isn't it Pentecostal whatever it is and and she sings you know and here's some guy condemning her called her a heretic for her confidence that she is a daughter of God she knows who she is she this and she that she's a herotic because all this and he finishes off by saying well she's a heretic because she she uh doesn't believe the Trinity but you go and do research about this and go back and look at the church of the people who are saying heretic heretic heretic and my brother and sisters and not one thing they're communicating is evidence that they are Sons and Daughters of God but there's we're using her for the example there's fruit here I don't want you to eat it I'll put up the Scarecrow now that's just a simple analogy I just drew out a thin air but um you look at this and you'll see today how it is that people use all kind of words I can remember back in the days when when someone would say oh you you believe that brandom uh you're in a cult and it used to shut me down I used to not not have one I didn't have one defense to to do to them and I I could Mumble words like well it's not what you think and they would go you're an Ault yeah you're an Ault then well my brother and sister I've said it across this Pulpit many times if we're in a cult it's the worst managed cult on the face of the Earth and that's a fact amen I have not showed up at your door to demand of you have I not very many people here tonight were safe amen my son-in-law and daughter are not here so certainly I'm safe but look at this my brother and sister if we are cult where's the enforcement where's the condemnation where's the the preaching and teaching that if you don't believe this you're going to hell you're lost you're doing this no my brother and sister I want the word coming from the pulpit in this church be a word that shows us encourages us gives us strength to go back to the Bible follow the word of God live the word of God and let that be our guide let the word be your guide amen not not not anything else just the word amen so there's always something you know the scarecrows go up wherever there's a promise of God to be fulfilled they put a scarecrow up of this you know if if the if the you know Oneness and and modalism and they got all these words that they throw out here about this and yet what did the prophet of God say he said over here the Trinity is not right but neither is the Oneness it's in the middle but you see they don't recognize there's a middle to them you're either this or you're this and there's more of these than there are of them so this has to be the truth my brother and sister voting with the majority is not always right amen God wants us to vote with the word amen so we find that thatth the scarecrows they don't show up where there's old dead theology you don't find people my brother and sister if there was ever a cult on Earth it was a Roman Catholic church but if there is protests against them it's a little minority that's easily overrode they use the word cult there and it's just brushed away but where the truth is preached they want to make an emphasis went off in the end the end of what the end is not here see they're talking about a man's life and trying to put a a scarecrow in front of the man's life to to keep people veering away from that but the truth of it is my brother and sister the word says In the End Amen that the word will come and Blossom forth and redeem a bride and that Bride is a response to Christ himself it's not a response to the church or what the world thinks their Revelation amen so put the Scarecrow up get people we've had visitors come to this church that literally stood in the foer and told me before this is the word of God it's the truth we'll be back and never see them again go home would brandom enter wow I'm glad I survived that I know I told them it was the most moving experience I've had in a church in 25 years but man I just barely escaped out of there why Google is a good scarecrow the devil knows how to use Google amen so old dead theology it doesn't need a scarecrow and you know the cold they don't need any scarecrow for the cold H every church is just a social thing everything I've got better things I'll Worship in nature I'll I'll do this I'll do that I'm not interested in that they just want my money you don't need a scarecrow for that the lukewarm don't need a scarecrow for them they're in church for the baseball team the basketball team the debate class they don't need a scarecrow only where the promised word is coming forth why remember the little story from last Wednesday the strawberry field they didn't need a scarecrow there if there wasn't any strawberries there but there is something that the bride wants and they want to put the Scarecrow up to keep the bride from it you see this is not about the man down the street or the pastor of that church or the pastor of that church over there my brother and sister this is spiritual warfare and those scarecrows they're anointed to put those up and tell their people now that little group down there on the corner at Midland they're they're they're in a little cult they they're deal called bromism well I want to know I hope I'm not speaking too blunt tonight are you a bromite anybody a bromite here tonight I didn't think there was we are Christians but you see I hope you don't maybe I ought to be careful about making this statement I don't go down the street and call them bapti ties or Mormon ites or Catholic ites so what do they do they throw the Scarecrow out those people are to be watched why because our wives and our daughters look holy because our men are honest truthful hardworking H as though you can't find that in the scripture as though you can't find that in the word of God but yet the Scarecrow scares remember the quote from last week all but those two and those two were out there just eaten away on strawberries all the rest of them C ca ca and screeching and chirping and whatever why you see the Scarecrow was all they could see they couldn't see a single strawberry in the field cuz if they had saw the strawberry the Nugget in the word and they were hungry they'd had to went into the word to get it but it was easier to sit on the power line and the tree branch and to say you you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong look at the Scarecrow you're wrong but there will be those this bride of Christ right this bride this word that's coming to the church and the it's becoming the bride right I just read the quote to you brother Bram says the church is becoming the bride we're talking about God's chosen church amen not denomination not even the name Grace Tabernacle it's God's chosen church is becoming the bride and they're not seeing scarecrows they're not seeing diversions and distractions they're seeing the word and the word is pulling them in and they once they take a bite imagine going down there and giving a lecture to one of those birds that's there eating those strawberries you know that tastes good right now but you'll regret it later as they eat another strawberry and another strawberry but see the word is here today even in oh I hope this doesn't hurt anybody's feelings even within the realm of the message you see little scarecrows don't bother reading the seals it'll be over your head no I've got a promise of the word that I'm rising into Heavenly places so even if there's part of the seals that's above of my head God's going to take me right up there and going to show me what this is because I am his bride I have been called and if he wrote it he wrote it for me amen what a philosophy isn't that what a what a way to look at this that if he wrote this in the message and reveal this in the message he did it for me amen he didn't do it for a theologian out there amen we've seen the Scarecrow say well just leave that to your pastor that's not for you that was for a prophet that was for the apostles that was for this my Bible says it was for me amen that he has given me the word that I can see who I am in Christ Jesus amen no scarecrow going to keep us from that one and now look at this it's only where the promised word is coming forth that you see their scarecrows Galore do you know you'd get less rebuttal if you were a Christian Science then you will if you believe the message after all Hollywood likes Christian Science but imagine pardon me for going off on this tangent imagine if what Hollywood produced lined up to the word of God nobody would watch Listen by they would have no interest at all why because they have went and taken of the fruit of the tree of the garden amen that's where they're at they're not following the word they've rejected the word and chose something different amen cuz look at this amen where the promised word is is there scarecrows all over the place good seed is still producing good seed that's the beauty of the message this is one of the things that makes me so happy is what the prophet of God said now this is what this word will produce this is the message of the hour it will produce this this and this and we are seeing it come to pass I I would just once again ask you are any of you being forced children you're not in this question are any of you being forced to serve God and I believe our children are not either so I'm not I say that kind of humorously we're not forced to serve God there's something in us that wants to serve him there's something that draws us to him and my brother and sister the world cannot understand that because to them they feel like there's an obligation but the prophet of God said this message will produce this this this and this and we are seeing it produced in this day right now without coercion without Force without bribery without whatever it is because the true word comes to the bride and she sees who she is and realizes I'm a part of this word I'm a part of the bridegroom I'm a part of the one who wrote the word and that's where I belong is in that right there it's not that I was just in there I just attended there I just did this now sorry a lot of confusing things and I I tried to sort them out but my brother and sister when you see somebody and I might preach on this here sooner or later but when you see people 41 years in the message and they wake up one day and say I've been fooled for 41 years you know what the bigger shame is they acted for 41 years it never was real all it took was one scarecrow to cause them to walk away from 41 years of serving God God having healed children God having healed them of cancer God having dealt with them of heart problems God having dealt with all kinds of things in their life and they could turn and say I followed a cult for 41 years maybe you did but that doesn't mean the word of God is a cult amen that means you are following some self-crafted amen I hope this making sense amen now in joov V Gyra part two I I want I just time is fleeing um brother bram's in a prayer here he says father we pray that you will take Thy word Thy word is truth and the Bible said Jesus speaking the word is a seed that a sewer sowed now we realize that if a seed is a good seed it's gerti so there's a separation of the seed a good and bad seed it's there there is life in that one seed but in a sense as the brother braham's bringing this out it's not gerti it's got a life in there you cannot take and and say that if you went over here to a uh you know a church somewhere we won't name names but you go over to a church somewhere that that there is not a lifechanging impact within that church if if you listen to what they do they'll encourage you you can do that you can overcome smoking drinking all behaviors you can do all of that but not germatize to the word see they germatize to to almost the equivalent of AA or something like that I can change myself I can think only positive thoughts every day and it will change me but not germatize to the word now realize if a seed is a good seed it's gerti and if that seed has been carried out in its plan in God's will then it leaves a gerti seed and when Jesus was on Earth he was that vine and the seed that he sowed was his word and we know that it's gerti by his own life and we know that a seed when it falls into the right kind of ground not upon rocks with no root nor in Thorns or thistles that would soon choke it but in good Rich fertile Faith every seed will bring forth of its kind and we know that every seed or promise of God will bring forth of its kind that it promised if it strikes the right ground the ground that's prepared and ready all the Rocks has been thrown out and The Roots and the bitterness and the selfishness and the indifference and jealousies had all been grubbed out that root of bitterness that Springs up that sometimes so spoils the thing that God is trying to do we pray pray God that won't be among us that the good word will find good ground in these see here is part of the good seed is a dependent where it's planted go take it in the natural you go out here and we Farm some rough and Rocky ground and you know when you plant the seed in there I could take you right now and show you corn fields and it looks like a gravel pit we're farming the edge of a gravel pit and this corn right there is a same seed if it had been planted down the hill in that other soil it'd be about 12T tall right now but as it is it's about 6 feet tall now do we blame the seed or the atmosphere it's sewed in see it's also our responsibility in Grace Tabernacle to create an atmosphere for the word the SE need to take root in we can be cold formal as a church and wonder why we have a cold formal church we can be all fanatical run jump shout scream at the top of our voice and wonder why the only thing we've got is the ability to run jump shout scream at the top of our voice but if we have that right atmosphere and we can sink that down look my brother and sister I'm not I'm not speaking one way or another but in the message right now there's a whole tug-of-war over these people are acting like Pentecostals these people over here are cold and formal these people are this and people are that my brother and sister I don't want to look at what they're doing I want to look at the atmosphere of Grace Tabernacle we don't need a scarecrow that says if we jumped up and said Hallelujah that we're some kind of Pentecostal we don't need a scarecrow that says that if we sit here and we don't have much respon wants that that we're some kind of dead formal throw that scarecrow out throw those things out that would limit us and be able to say Lord this is the word I say Amen to this word that doesn't mean you got to stand on the Pew and scream amen you can say Amen in the depths of your heart and say I believe that Lord amen you can find it in the prayer line where brother brandom's speaking to people ask him do you believe they don't nod their head they don't say yes they don't say no they don't say nothing and brother brandham says yes you believe why he was in contact with their spirit and their spirit said I believe amen they didn't run across a platform screaming and shouting leaping over the chairs but something inside of them responded to the word but we get scarecrows if I get too carried away what will the people think if I don't get carried away at all what will the people think why you care what the people think we're here to serve God Amen it's our heart our soul our spirit speaking to Jesus amen him speaking to us it's not about what that family thinks or that family thinks or how these people react have you ever noticed some families they're just well we see this a lot in South America some families I mean you can just greet them in the parking lot of the church and say God bless you and they about have a Shakedown Revival right there and others you could run over them with a boss couldn't hardly get an amen out of them but their life lines with the word perfectly the two ends of the spectrum now who's putting the Scarecrow out there we need to reject that scarecrow we need to not let that scarecrow control how we respond to the word of God how we respond to one another you know CU what happens amen if things don't work it's the message fault how many times have we seen that but you walk in the home there'd be a gentleman you would know his name connected with a lot of controversial things I'd been in his home he had more contemporary music in his home than he had message had a whole wall full of every kind of whatever but I'm sorry my brother and sister if AC DC sings Amazing Grace that is not gospel music come on are you with me amen so you look at this and realize what has happened if it doesn't work you find something to blame it on without finding why the seed never took root am I digging in too deep never once do they look at the expected place for the seed all they have to do is take this scripture and read it and realize this seed needs to go in the best soil I can find but we'll offer God second place third place fourth place you know you can break this down I won't preach it tonight but you can break this Parable down as first place in your life second place in your life third place in your life fourth place in your life and when you get all the way out in the thorn my brother and sister and every little scarecrow comes along and you believe them because when you walk out in the Thorns barefooted it hurts and you say oh this is what the message produced I'm sorry scarecrows the word will produce good fruit if we put it in the best soil of our life amen where' that seed get planted you got good seed good soil you got a good result amen now I'm going to jump over couple things here no I'm going to read this perseverance let's put that up uh always is it's the devil trying to put a scarecrow out see scare you away but remember the Scarecrow is always at the good tree just remember that not out on the old Sour Apples no it's always where good eating's at so he said Just remember now there'll be some raised up saying they're this and some saying they're that and some are saying they're so forth and claiming Messiahs and everything else but don't you believe it now the only way to be sure is take what the word says see got all these scarecrows out here interpreting amen oh this and that I I mentioned to Sister Jerry I was a little surprised some wording that was on a little flyer uh of of a minister and I was a little surprised at that but you know uh Jerry was very quick to point out to me rightfully so it was good that you know um maybe uh what they're doing fits the wording you know and and I want to be sufficiently vague there but you see if a scarecrow I I'll just put out a little a little nugget of it if someone says they're an apostle they walk into Grace Tabernacle and say I'm an apostle now are we me immmediately going to throw up all kinds of flags that what is this person or we could go back to what the prophet of God said and said you know a missionary AP Apostle setting forth establishing it's not out of line but we have scarecrows and someone says Apostle and we're immediately like whoa who's this person but you know sometimes we need to stop and and not let the Scarecrow control our thinking amen so our only way is to make sure what the word says now we're winding down here so amen now in the restoration of the brid tree brother Brown says here you know you've always put scarecrows you always put the scarecrows where the good tree is at the Devil does the same thing to scare you off of It Don't You Worry go right on in behind that scarecrow amen I remember I've said it over the pulpit here I remember the first time I ever heard the words preached about the third pole I was like where did they get that well what that really was my statement really proved my ignorance of the word right we understand the separation of ignorance and stupidity right we often say that person's ignorant we really meant to say they're stupid ignorance is a lack of knowledge stupidity is the lack of the application so you look at this and realize that when I heard the third Poll for the first time I was all just like man what is this man preaching about brother Harold hilderbrandt actually and uh what's he preaching about oh man I wrote all kinds of notes big highlights and arrows and check marks and and then I went home and looked in the message and everywhere I looked there's the third poll third third pole third pole third pole and I thought how did I miss this all the time but you see how I miss that all the time is we come out of a church or a leadership that said these things are over your head stay away from it and because we were sure it was going to hurt us we stayed away in regardless to the words on the page we never ever uh joined ourselves with those words never joined ourselves with that Revelation and therefore the Scarecrow worked but one day by God's grace the Scarecrow was taken down and it was given to us opened to us revealed to us can you say Thank You Lord amen you put the Scarecrow where the good trees is at the Devil does the same thing to scary don't worry go right on in behind that scarecrow scarecrow says brother Brown preached this a lot he didn't say the Scarecrow says but I'm saying that uh the days of Miracles are passed that's nothing but a scarecrow amen healing is for days gone by that's just a scarecrow amen that's only for the prophet that's a scarecrow amen that was for the Old Testament Church that's a scarecrow amen it's too deep for us that's a scarecrow amen God preached this word through a prophet that you and I would understand who we are and the revelation of the word the prophet if you can find I'll I'll eat the page it's on if you can find one place where the prophet of God says now this mystery is too deep for you bride I'll eat the page my brother and sister because it doesn't exist amen he come and said that the mystery would be fulfilled in that day and if it's still a mystery to you amen not to the Theologian we're not talking to the Great Men of the message we're talking to the bride of Christ the everyday individual that is the bride of Christ if it's still a mystery to you then don't give up then get in and God will show you amen hallelujah cuz the Hebrews 13 and8 amen isn't that almost like a prophet's one of his themes he laid that out to us over and over and over again Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever isn't that beautiful amen sister Ruth will you come hopefully the big gaps I left in here uh well the Lord the Lord will take that up amen Saints the real true thing don't be detoured by scarecrow hold to the the word let the word interpret to you the Life of Christ amen it was preached in this day because Malachi 4:5 doesn't say behold I sent you to a prophet Malachi 4:5 says I sent a prophet to you amen and he sent him to us that this would all be set in order and all revealed that we could come to that final awareness of exactly who we are and every scarecrow we maybe by God's grace we'll preach this in another Wednesday or something but I just love the little story given away in the next sermon but I love the little story brother Brown talking about planting the butter beans and that little the ground little groundhog guy brother Brown makes the scary little face and puts it out there in the field if you haven't read that lately find it read it it's really interesting because see that little groundhog that scary little face he knew that just beyond that scary little face that scarecrow was butter beans brother Brown talks about how that little groundhog goes up there he looks at it and jumps back he looks at it and jumps back he looks at it jumps back finally he reaches out hits it and it rattles he jumps back hits it again rattles pretty soon he just ignored it and went on and started eating butter beans now I don't want this to be too personal but sometimes in our life we see sister nauy I hope you don't mind that I would mention you that you're in the university life was in front of you and someone who is your friend share something man there must have been a lot of scarecrows [Music] but for every scarecrow there was something inside to respond to the word and the draw of the word was greater than every scarecrow and that is the very evidence of the word manifested in our day that the call of the word is greater than the scarecrows that Satan can throw up around it and we'll find that every one of us has something of that nature in our life as teenagers there's going to be a lot of influence that's brought and scarecrows oh you you know you don't have you have a boring life you have this you have that all of these kind of things my brother and sister and the truth of it is they're all scarecrows just trying to keep us from serving God do you know I I am closing one of the greatest scarecrows that is in the world today is not about what you will get but about what you have to give up you won't be able to you can't sing you can't dance you can't this you can't that nothing but scarecrows trying to make being a Christian look like it's at the bottom of the barrel but I tell you there's something refreshing you see a Believer I don't know what age to choose cuz it actually reflects all ages so I I won't have to be specific there's just something wholesome about someone who served the Lord all the days of their life whatever age that they are something wholesome about them and then you take s Satan's counterpart whether it's 30 40 you know you the 20 year olds they get out cuz natural youth makes anybody look good but you know you start getting up there late 30s you know in the 40s 50s 60s 7s and you have these people have lived for the Lord their whole life there's this wholesome presence about them and you look at the world and you think that person's 60 and it turns out they're 48 and I I say that serious not not in humor and you you'll see them they look they look rugged they look thrashed [Music] out and Satan would say if you are a Christian look at what you're going to miss out on I often Marvel at that how convincing Satan is with his scarecrow that you're going to miss out having all kinds of disease and troubles and struggles and people will turn down serving God CU they don't want to miss out and yet the very thing they're missing out on is eternal life when something's presented make sure it's not a scarecrow amen we want the word hallelujah amen change my heart oh Lord amen oh God 895 I believe amen [Music] change my heart oh God make it ever true change my heart oh give me like you for you are the [Music] part I Am The Clay a hold me and make me this is why I [Music] pray change my heart oh God make it ever true change my heart oh God oh may I be like Hallelujah I'd like to I was just listening to this song being sang a couple days ago just beyond the veil 348 amen I I have quite an extensive w writing or addition to this song I maybe should someday write it down I just never really wanted to make any big deal out of it but it's such a beautiful beautiful thought beautiful words inspiration that comes
