[40:08] Lovely song service I appreciate that
[40:12] music amen
[40:15] um
[40:16] forgot to put down on the list or
[40:18] remember Sister Joel Lynn not only is
[40:21] she
[40:22] um
[40:24] I say this a little bit joking wondering
[40:26] about her chosen profession
[40:28] back in the classroom with all these
[40:30] kids and whatnot and I think she's a
[40:33] little mentally exhausted plus she kind
[40:36] of has a obligation to further her
[40:38] education so she's having to do night
[40:41] school and those things so please
[40:43] remember her I had not totally put this
[40:47] out to to the Sunday School teachers but
[40:51] I would like to start Sunday school and
[40:53] young adults on Sunday September the 3rd
[40:56] and so uh just like you to keep that in
[41:00] mind amen let's turn in our Bibles
[41:04] um I want to speak to you on age to age
[41:06] the perfecting of the Bride part two
[41:09] amen we didn't make it through all the
[41:12] way uh last Wednesday and uh just would
[41:15] like to continue that but you know there
[41:18] was a little something that brother Stan
[41:19] uh said did you enjoy brother Stan's
[41:22] Ministry I I really just he was there in
[41:25] the home with us and just a lovely time
[41:28] uh it's really sad when you see two old
[41:31] men almost in tears when they left
[41:34] um and um so it wasn't all just brother
[41:36] Stan but you know it was just such a
[41:39] joyous time we were able to just
[41:42] interact talk about the word of God uh
[41:45] share share some Vision you might say
[41:48] and and that so but one thing that
[41:50] brother Stan said that struck me and uh
[41:53] you know I started into speak this
[41:57] um
[41:58] kind of coming and I'm I'm not bashful
[42:01] about giving credit where it's due but
[42:03] rather Vitale uh preaching about
[42:06] building the church and you know uh that
[42:10] night or that I guess that was day
[42:12] whatever I I just really was caught up
[42:14] with the fact that
[42:16] um Revelations 2 and Revelations 3 gives
[42:19] us a very clear view you might say the
[42:22] overall construction blueprint of the
[42:24] church and it really struck me and uh
[42:27] and then coming and coupling with
[42:29] something brother Stan spoke and he was
[42:32] talking about how if you remember he
[42:34] said I started on this series and I was
[42:36] just hurrying to get through this series
[42:37] and he said the Lord spoke to him and
[42:40] said what's your rush and he said then
[42:42] it turned into 60 some uh sermons that
[42:45] come out of that thought and so Saints
[42:47] if you don't mind
[42:49] my rush through the seven Church ages uh
[42:54] would uh turn into a little more of a
[42:57] study or going through the resume of the
[43:01] ages and so I don't know how many of you
[43:03] have the little book or have in that
[43:07] your church age book you can study it
[43:09] out of that so if Lord willing you would
[43:12] maybe the coming Wednesdays would bring
[43:15] your church age book or if you have the
[43:17] resume of the age book separate and and
[43:20] uh we will just stop and and let's just
[43:23] dig in okay because I believe the church
[43:25] age book is is a very beneficial to us
[43:29] it lays it out so clearly and so we can
[43:32] see that in there and and let's just dig
[43:34] through it let's look at what was
[43:36] happening in that day not brushing it
[43:38] off because just to give you a little
[43:40] glimpse of that that as the Lord struck
[43:42] to me as I've started re-reading the
[43:44] resume of the ages is the fact that my
[43:46] brother and sister the word of God had
[43:48] come and was so fresh in the first age
[43:52] but in such a short span of years
[43:55] Satan had already come in and was
[43:57] drawing it away already had added to it
[44:02] and already had started to put in man's
[44:05] ideas and I think it do us good because
[44:07] you see I don't believe amongst real
[44:10] Believers that we ever come to the place
[44:12] that we say oh I'm just tired of hearing
[44:14] this or that but my brother and sister I
[44:17] believe it's it's very important and we
[44:19] can see it through all the ages the
[44:21] emphasis of staying with the word
[44:24] it Satan would just love for us to to to
[44:28] to just pull back just a little bit to
[44:32] soften our stance here to compromise a
[44:35] little there but my brother and sister
[44:37] the anointing of the age of this age on
[44:40] the bride of Christ amen we're going to
[44:42] dismiss all the naysayers and all the
[44:44] negative people the anointing on the
[44:47] bride of Christ is stay with the word
[44:49] amen and as we hear the word preach we
[44:52] should never even if you hear a topic
[44:55] preached over and over again we should
[44:57] never get tired because if we believe
[44:59] God's leadership is guiding the church
[45:02] then someone needs to hear it
[45:05] you say but we've heard that preached
[45:07] someone maybe was yawning at the moment
[45:12] someone had went to the restroom or
[45:15] stepped out or whatever it might be and
[45:17] hey we want to make it amen that's our
[45:20] that's our goal that's our heart's
[45:22] desire to make it amen so we don't want
[45:24] to miss any instruction
[45:27] it reminds me one time as we went and uh
[45:30] was on a little holiday and there was
[45:32] kind of a little uh video deal on the
[45:34] screen and the man stood in the front
[45:37] and said now there'll be people waiting
[45:39] this was at the science deal in in
[45:42] Arizona he says now there's going to be
[45:43] people waiting behind that door
[45:46] you cannot exit that door
[45:50] now did you hear me you cannot exit that
[45:53] door
[45:53] when the little film thing was over half
[45:56] of the crowd went down to push their way
[45:58] out that door and so we realized just in
[46:00] the realm of humanity that when we were
[46:03] listening we're not always hearing
[46:05] amen
[46:07] Hallelujah first Peter
[46:09] hi amen sorry about that brother Gideon
[46:11] I probably just confused you all because
[46:14] I told them pick up where I left off but
[46:16] uh that's fine Brother Gideon they can
[46:19] it's a short scripture amen first Peter
[46:22] 2 5 ye also as Lively stones are built
[46:27] up a spiritual house so this is God's
[46:29] intent to us Saints is to build up a
[46:33] spiritual house not a 5 000 square foot
[46:36] mansion with a four or five car garage
[46:40] amen a spiritual house
[46:43] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[46:46] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[46:50] Christ now we'll drop down a little bit
[46:52] into the second chapter verses 9 and 10.
[46:55] same ones that we read the other day and
[46:57] want to just reiterate this Foundation
[46:59] but ye are a chosen generation Can
[47:02] someone say Amen to that and we are a
[47:06] royal priesthood and a holy nation of
[47:08] peculiar people that ye should sow forth
[47:12] the Praises of him who hath called you
[47:14] out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[47:18] now this is not just like my brother and
[47:20] sister this is Marvelous Light amen
[47:25] don't let Satan ever diminish this and
[47:27] and come to the place that we say well I
[47:30] follow the message I believe the message
[47:32] I I'm pretty sure the message is truth
[47:34] my brother and sister God called you now
[47:37] if God made a promise to you as it is in
[47:39] Malachi 4 5 behold I send you
[47:44] you know I've made this emphasis many
[47:46] times want to make it again behold I
[47:48] send you God is not speaking my brother
[47:50] and sister to the Elders of the church
[47:52] or to the hierarchy here or to those
[47:54] there he's speaking to you and I a very
[47:58] personal statement that he made and so
[48:01] as we'll look at this right here we'll
[48:04] realize that God has come and reiterated
[48:07] this personal statement amen that ye
[48:10] should show forth the Praises of him who
[48:13] hath called you
[48:15] well we got to be identified I know
[48:18] there's jokes out there if you're a
[48:20] sheep you're you
[48:21] but my brother and sister you've got to
[48:23] identify yourself in the word the
[48:26] prophet of God said so find yourself
[48:29] in the word
[48:31] amen how important that is he's called
[48:34] you out of Darkness into his marvelous
[48:36] life which in time past were not a
[48:38] people but are now the people of God
[48:41] which had not obtained Mercy but now
[48:44] have obtained Mercy Lord we ask you for
[48:48] your blessing upon the word tonight in
[48:50] your name amen you may be seated Saints
[48:53] now I would like you to turn in your
[48:55] Bibles
[48:56] to Revelations the third chapter and
[49:01] we'll start with the first verse
[49:03] now
[49:05] as we are looking at this we have we
[49:09] went through the other Church ages there
[49:11] in the second chapter on last Wednesday
[49:13] evening and we're just catching these
[49:16] few little portions and I'm I'm really
[49:19] happy because I felt a little uh I don't
[49:21] know a little sad to jump through this
[49:23] so quickly but then just those as I
[49:26] shared with you brother Stan saying that
[49:28] it struck me I thought what is my Rush
[49:30] amen so you look at this now Revelations
[49:33] 3 1 and unto the angel of church and
[49:36] Sardis right these things saith he the
[49:39] hath the seven spirits of God and the
[49:42] Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou
[49:44] has a name that thou livest and art dead
[49:48] he that overcometh verse 5 he that
[49:50] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[49:52] white raiment and I will not blot out
[49:56] his name out of the book of life but I
[49:58] will confess his name before my father
[50:00] and before his angels amen as well look
[50:04] at this my brother and sister there's
[50:06] nothing like
[50:08] having a church and I'm going to speak
[50:11] direct if you all don't mind there's
[50:12] nothing like having a church that
[50:14] declares that they have life but when
[50:16] you go in and you sit down in those
[50:18] Services you sit down in that that there
[50:21] there's no presence there's no life
[50:23] there and we're not going to throw
[50:25] stones outside here but we'll pray that
[50:27] it's not in our midst that we're talking
[50:29] we'll pray that it's not in our our
[50:32] faith but my brother and sister I've had
[50:35] family Through The Years in different
[50:37] denominations and had occasion to go to
[50:40] church with them and you know when you
[50:42] go into a a service and the only
[50:45] response the preacher gets is when he
[50:47] tells a good joke
[50:49] amen you realize that when they read the
[50:52] scripture very few people even open
[50:55] their Bibles and very few people even
[50:58] enter into this and you realize while
[51:01] they profess to be the Church of the
[51:03] Living God that basically they're more
[51:06] excited when the church posts its summer
[51:08] baseball league on the board amen then
[51:11] they get excited about what is happening
[51:14] or the church fantasy football amen
[51:17] would any of you be interested in
[51:19] joining a fantasy football group my
[51:22] brother and sister are no place in the
[51:24] house of God should such things be it
[51:27] shouldn't even be named as it were in
[51:29] the house of God but that's what it
[51:31] takes to put life in the church amen
[51:35] because in the preaching of the word now
[51:37] I don't know you know and I don't
[51:39] necessarily encourage you to do it but
[51:41] you know there's certain things that
[51:42] every once in a while I Glimpse at to
[51:44] just kind of see where it's going right
[51:46] because the prophet of God showed us or
[51:49] told us that uh when they start to seek
[51:52] the oil my brother and sister that the
[51:54] coming of the Lord is nigh upon us and
[51:56] you know you just kind of keep looking
[51:58] at that wondering what is this and my
[52:00] brother and sister there is some of
[52:02] these uh churches that that are
[52:04] preaching now I'll just share my opinion
[52:07] for what it's worth all two cents of it
[52:09] amen and I give rebate for nickels so
[52:12] you see where this value is at it's
[52:14] there my brother and sister I assure you
[52:16] and they're very verbiage they use that
[52:19] they're reading the message of the hour
[52:21] or they're that close in their seeking
[52:25] of the oil
[52:27] it's right there and so we see how that
[52:31] this is coming either way they are
[52:33] searching and you'll see ministers
[52:35] preaching to their churches and they are
[52:38] preaching a sermon my brother and sister
[52:40] you might question my judgment on this
[52:43] but they're preaching sermons that could
[52:45] be preached in this church and we would
[52:48] say Amen to it but there's no life in it
[52:52] it's Hollow it's empty all the nutrients
[52:56] you might say have been drawn from it
[52:58] and so they're quoting the scripture and
[53:01] speaking the thought but it's not
[53:03] changing the people and I tell you
[53:05] wherever this gospel is preached in the
[53:07] anointing of the Holy Ghost it changes
[53:10] lives you cannot sit under the preaching
[53:12] of the word that is Anointed by God and
[53:15] it not change our life amen and so it's
[53:19] there that we realize that what is
[53:21] coming in our day that that there's a
[53:23] time these Spirits lingering and coming
[53:26] forth as the prophet taught us that
[53:28] every Spirit of every age didn't go away
[53:31] because it was only to that age but it's
[53:33] now compounded with the spirits of the
[53:35] previous age and coming and that's why
[53:37] laodicea is such a mess is because we
[53:40] now have a compound of seven spirits
[53:44] amen talking in the negative seven
[53:46] spirits compounded together against the
[53:49] bride of Christ but look at this bride
[53:52] she's got Seven Ages worth of the
[53:55] anointing of the Holy Ghost than has
[53:57] been poured out on her that everything
[53:59] Satan's been able to do for seven Church
[54:02] ages the bride has an answer for that
[54:05] amen and I thank God for that hallelujah
[54:08] amen because this bride is going to have
[54:11] a name that she lives amen not a name
[54:13] that she lived in is dead but she's got
[54:15] a name that she lives amen and so it's
[54:18] there he says you know what to those
[54:21] that overcome they shall be clothed in
[54:23] white raiment you know I just love I
[54:27] just love that little picture you know
[54:28] that shows a little bride and she's all
[54:31] clothed in that gown of the word now you
[54:35] know I I love that picture because
[54:37] that's literally what is happening in
[54:39] our lives is that we are becoming the
[54:41] word and the word is becoming us we are
[54:44] so clothed in the word if you follow me
[54:46] that you can't see anything else now
[54:48] don't look at your flesh right we heard
[54:51] brother Vitale we heard brother Stan
[54:53] preach just very connected sermons my
[54:55] brother and sister it's not what we see
[54:58] in ourselves but it's what God sees in
[55:01] US amen because if we saw in ourselves
[55:04] I'd probably just get discouraged and
[55:05] quit because I don't see a guy that's
[55:07] got his act together I don't see a guy
[55:09] that's special but the word shows us
[55:11] that we are the word declares we are and
[55:15] God says I'm looking through the lens of
[55:17] my own blood through my own word at you
[55:20] and all I see is a bride coming to
[55:23] maturity
[55:24] amen I thank God for that I thank God
[55:27] for a timely preaching of the word amen
[55:30] so it's there he's saying you know to
[55:32] those that overcome I'm going to close
[55:34] them in that white raim it and I'm I'm
[55:37] telling you my brother and sister if you
[55:40] just get over yourself okay let's get
[55:43] over ourselves tonight
[55:45] when Satan comes like the flood
[55:48] we react in a human element
[55:52] we are react in humanity
[55:54] they said this did they mean it to me
[55:57] how did they mean that did I take it
[55:59] like they meant it did I hear like they
[56:01] meant it or is there misunderstanding
[56:02] and we'll go into a great battle about
[56:05] what this is and if we're not careful
[56:07] we'll convince ourselves we're offended
[56:10] but what happens I'm not making a point
[56:14] about that
[56:15] what happens right behind that initial
[56:18] influence of the spirit of the age
[56:21] the word comes right in
[56:24] and we start to say no
[56:26] that's not what it is that's my brother
[56:28] that's my sister this is the word
[56:33] Satan's trying to trying to break our
[56:36] fellowship like it was broken in the
[56:38] garden
[56:39] it's not about who's writing the word
[56:41] and who's wrong my brother and sister we
[56:43] need to take that whole thought that
[56:45] used to be so prominent people would say
[56:47] well you know praise God I would rather
[56:50] be right in my spirit and wrong in my
[56:53] Doctrine than to be right in my Doctrine
[56:55] and wrong in my spirit but my brother
[56:57] and sister are what we got to do is get
[56:59] out of our carnal thinking and know that
[57:02] God has sent the pure word to us amen
[57:07] it's not going to be about what the
[57:08] doctrine is if you're the bride of
[57:10] Christ you'll have the right Doctrine
[57:12] and what Satan's trying to do he's
[57:15] trying to stir it all up that we're
[57:17] trying to find our own footing but God
[57:19] says I will give you your footing you
[57:22] come unto me draw nigh to me I'll
[57:25] position you where you need to be and
[57:28] it's not going to be on sin it's not
[57:30] going to be out here at the landfill
[57:31] it's not going to be in laodicea I'm
[57:34] going to put you on the rock of my word
[57:36] and there you're going to be buffeted
[57:39] but you won't fall you won't be washed
[57:42] away you won't collapse you won't be
[57:44] taken my brother and sister because what
[57:47] happens is we will have the word come
[57:51] back not from the preacher well it might
[57:53] come from the preacher it might come
[57:54] from the prophet's voice but my brother
[57:56] and sister what God's really intending
[57:58] is the word that's already in you is
[58:01] going to rise up I was offended
[58:03] yesterday but now the word has rose up
[58:06] and I realize oh God but for your grace
[58:10] and we forgive and we reconcile and we
[58:13] move into our proper position it's not
[58:15] God running out with a Craftsman
[58:17] building a wall around you to keep you
[58:19] safe but it's a word that's already in
[58:23] you it's a word in you and you say but
[58:25] why didn't it rise up immediately
[58:27] because we are human
[58:30] and God wants to stir up our Pure Minds
[58:33] and in the stirring of our minds we can
[58:36] come back and that's why a Christian
[58:37] will repent if he's offended or that's
[58:40] why a Christian will always come back to
[58:42] the word of God because God says hey I'm
[58:45] now raising up the standard that's
[58:48] already in you we don't need to get out
[58:52] on the horizon and start looking for
[58:54] this standard this this Fortress this
[58:56] buttress that God is going to give my
[58:58] brother and sister look in Christ is
[59:00] here
[59:01] amen the Apostle Paul declared it
[59:05] amen quite strongly
[59:08] Hallelujah were we going to find Christ
[59:10] my brother and sister
[59:14] huh
[59:16] it's been taught around the whole world
[59:18] you've got to run down talk to the
[59:19] priests got to talk to the preacher got
[59:21] to go here what did he say he said it's
[59:22] in you
[59:24] amen that's where your hope of glory is
[59:26] at it's in you
[59:27] oh sounds like we're into some new age
[59:30] thing here oh it's in me it's in me it's
[59:32] all about me well I'm telling you my
[59:34] brother and sister the New Age spirit is
[59:37] just Satan's Twist on the truth
[59:40] amen that our Redemption is in US
[59:44] are you with me
[59:46] because if Christ is in us our
[59:48] Redemption is in US amen and if Christ
[59:52] is not in us we got serious problems
[59:57] we got really serious problems we don't
[59:59] need to argue over verbiage if we the
[1:00:02] Christ is not in me my brother and
[1:00:03] sister I'm stunned you could knock me to
[1:00:05] the ground with a feather how many
[1:00:07] people in the last couple years that
[1:00:09] I've run into that are there like no no
[1:00:11] he's not in me we're waiting for him to
[1:00:13] come well I'm telling you my brother and
[1:00:15] sister I'm sitting here in Grace
[1:00:17] Tabernacle and I will testify with my
[1:00:20] life he is here
[1:00:22] he is here tonight because you come in
[1:00:25] the house of God hungry with a desire
[1:00:28] Lord I'm hungry and I want to be fed and
[1:00:31] he made the promise I'll be with you
[1:00:33] even in you so where does this come from
[1:00:39] oh it's my pastor
[1:00:42] it's my pastor's doing it he's he's the
[1:00:45] reason I'm an overcomer you're backslid
[1:00:49] amen you're not your pastor
[1:00:52] it's Christ in you and the word is just
[1:00:56] stirring up what is already been placed
[1:01:00] in you
[1:01:01] Hallelujah
[1:01:05] you know sometimes we don't even realize
[1:01:07] what we like sorry to throw sister Jerry
[1:01:09] under the bus but tonight she made some
[1:01:11] kind of whatever you would call that and
[1:01:13] she told me you know this is what it is
[1:01:16] and it's going to be on a bed of
[1:01:17] mushrooms and I don't trust her anymore
[1:01:19] because somewhere in there cauliflower
[1:01:21] is hidden
[1:01:26] but when we're all done eating I had to
[1:01:28] look over and say honey
[1:01:30] that was really really good
[1:01:32] really really good
[1:01:34] and we come to the house of God
[1:01:36] sometimes we don't like
[1:01:38] what God decides to serve up to us
[1:01:41] but if we just sit down
[1:01:43] and say Lord I came hungry
[1:01:46] and I want to be fed and if this is what
[1:01:49] you have for me then Lord I'm just going
[1:01:52] to sit down and both elbows on the table
[1:01:54] it's not legitimate kids don't eat that
[1:01:56] way it looks like you're a Savage
[1:02:00] but I tell you know a Hungry Man when he
[1:02:02] sits down to the table got an elbow on
[1:02:04] the table and his head down and just
[1:02:05] starts putting the food in
[1:02:07] you see what God's doing
[1:02:09] he's feeding us what we need
[1:02:12] there's the standard raised in laodicea
[1:02:17] he's feeding us what we need because if
[1:02:20] it was what we wanted let's talk about
[1:02:22] that fancy fantasy football league we're
[1:02:25] going to never start
[1:02:28] you see my brother and sister Humanity
[1:02:31] let's let's face it
[1:02:34] let's face it Humanity
[1:02:37] likes those who will tickle
[1:02:40] their ears
[1:02:42] they're attracted to the ticklers
[1:02:45] hmm
[1:02:47] remember brother Jason you know a lot of
[1:02:51] our little kids
[1:02:52] you'd hear them over there don't tickle
[1:02:54] me don't tickle me as they stand there
[1:02:55] right next to him don't tickle me don't
[1:02:57] tickle me
[1:03:00] that's really the world we live in
[1:03:03] yeah oh just give us the word preacher
[1:03:05] tickle me
[1:03:07] make me happy
[1:03:09] you know I used to think the phrase
[1:03:11] preach me happy was a good phrase but I
[1:03:14] don't like it anymore because my brother
[1:03:16] and sister it's a phrase that can be so
[1:03:18] easily misconstrued because some people
[1:03:20] will be like preach me happy and they
[1:03:22] want to be able to walk out of church I
[1:03:24] feel so good well I tell you what makes
[1:03:26] you feel good my brother and sister is
[1:03:28] when you take the spiritual vitamin of
[1:03:30] the word and you are there and it's what
[1:03:32] happens tomorrow and the next day and
[1:03:34] the next day and as you look in the word
[1:03:36] and the prophet of God says the token is
[1:03:39] no longer the blood amen my brother and
[1:03:42] sister it's kind of startling when you
[1:03:44] look at that it's no longer the blood
[1:03:46] it's the life
[1:03:47] amen so we can have the blood people
[1:03:50] people repent and they get baptized and
[1:03:54] they move forward but if it's not the
[1:03:57] real life amen there's nothing there
[1:04:00] they can call on the token all they want
[1:04:03] and say we've applied the token we've
[1:04:05] applied the token my brother and sister
[1:04:07] that's to say I'm I'm getting off track
[1:04:09] but that's to say I've got the message
[1:04:11] on the mantle
[1:04:13] but what God wants is not on the mantle
[1:04:16] he wants it on our hearts he wants it in
[1:04:18] our life he wants it being manifested
[1:04:21] and then we can stand and say when my
[1:04:24] house is in order when my life is in
[1:04:26] order when everything is in order then
[1:04:29] God is obligated but not because I
[1:04:31] believe the message
[1:04:33] but because I'm living the word the life
[1:04:36] is in me it's in you and it's coming out
[1:04:40] Hallelujah let me get back on track here
[1:04:43] amen
[1:04:45] you see as you look at this he says he
[1:04:47] won't blot our name out of The Book of
[1:04:49] Life
[1:04:50] and so that's wonderful aren't you happy
[1:04:53] that he's not going to blot your name
[1:04:54] out of the book of life amen but you see
[1:04:57] it's not just the book my brother and
[1:05:00] sister because the bride of Christ is
[1:05:02] written on the palms of his hands we in
[1:05:05] other words are identified directly in
[1:05:08] him
[1:05:10] this is not just hey you can find my
[1:05:13] name
[1:05:16] where are we going to find you
[1:05:19] in
[1:05:21] Christ
[1:05:23] not just a name on a book I'm glad my
[1:05:25] name's on the book and I say thank you
[1:05:27] Lord that my name's on the book but you
[1:05:29] see I want to be identified in Christ
[1:05:33] Hallelujah I don't know if that made
[1:05:35] sense or not
[1:05:36] amen
[1:05:38] so he says then you know that I'm going
[1:05:40] to uh I'm going to declare you before my
[1:05:43] father I'm going to confess your name
[1:05:44] before my father
[1:05:46] before his angels
[1:05:48] you know there's nothing like
[1:05:50] I just remember years ago
[1:05:54] be careful young ladies
[1:05:57] when young boys start to pay attention
[1:05:59] you be careful the words that you use
[1:06:03] many years ago
[1:06:05] I started
[1:06:07] well I think the day I first met her I
[1:06:09] was very attracted to Sister Jerry
[1:06:12] and
[1:06:14] anyway my point being is one she said
[1:06:17] she'd never marry me
[1:06:21] amen be careful what you say young
[1:06:24] ladies
[1:06:25] God does have a sense of humor
[1:06:28] and that kid that you say he's a geek a
[1:06:30] dork and all those other words that are
[1:06:31] not legal to say in this day and age you
[1:06:33] might come back and haunt you I just as
[1:06:35] a friend share that with you
[1:06:38] but you see there was a special day in
[1:06:40] my life
[1:06:41] when I was before friends
[1:06:44] then I uttered Jerry's name
[1:06:48] you might say possessive for the first
[1:06:50] time
[1:06:52] the first household I ever took sister
[1:06:54] Jerry 2 was brother Dan and sister Sue's
[1:06:57] house I probably fell asleep
[1:07:00] and sister Sue visited with Jerry
[1:07:03] later told me good choice Paul
[1:07:08] but you see it starts with the
[1:07:11] confession
[1:07:13] I had to confess I believe this girl is
[1:07:18] the girl
[1:07:21] and you say but what's that got to do
[1:07:23] with God
[1:07:24] the devil
[1:07:26] needs reminded
[1:07:29] come on Saints
[1:07:31] the devil needs reminded and God is
[1:07:35] confessing us
[1:07:38] amen Before the Throne before the angel
[1:07:41] he's confessing us it's not a one-sided
[1:07:44] relationship I Love You Lord if we could
[1:07:46] hear the Heavenly Anthem we would hear
[1:07:49] God saying I love and you put your name
[1:07:51] in there I love them I have redeemed
[1:07:55] them they are my bride they are my
[1:07:58] possession and it's being spoken but we
[1:08:01] are caught in a Earthly realm and the
[1:08:03] voice is being projected as it were in a
[1:08:06] spiritual realm a Heavenly realm but I'm
[1:08:08] telling you how God's expression of his
[1:08:11] words his confession is is that there's
[1:08:14] something comes down and touches you and
[1:08:16] I in the preaching and the ministry of
[1:08:19] the word it touches us and we just say
[1:08:22] oh God's moving upon my spirit my
[1:08:24] brother and sister in a realm that we
[1:08:26] cannot recognize you are hearing that
[1:08:29] Heavenly voice declare your name and
[1:08:32] it's coming down through the heavens and
[1:08:34] you're responding to it but we're still
[1:08:36] caught in an Earthly real film that we
[1:08:39] don't realize that's the very voice of
[1:08:42] God that's wooing you
[1:08:44] oh it's not the preacher it's not the
[1:08:47] special singer that's God's voice wooing
[1:08:50] you and I into his presence
[1:08:54] oh thank you Lord Jesus
[1:08:57] Hallelujah
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:02] I just I love that amen
[1:09:05] Sardis had something really going for it
[1:09:09] but just all of these Church ages my
[1:09:11] brother and sister
[1:09:12] will recognize that there was a great
[1:09:15] move of God and then something started
[1:09:19] cooling off
[1:09:21] something started to change
[1:09:23] and as we go through the resume of the
[1:09:26] ages we'll look into that little closer
[1:09:28] but my brother and sister you can have
[1:09:30] the volcano but it can't stay red hot
[1:09:33] forever
[1:09:34] amen so it's there that once the lava
[1:09:37] comes out flows down the mountain pretty
[1:09:39] soon it gets hard and you look at the
[1:09:42] church ages and you'll see the same
[1:09:44] thing the church hot amen it flows out
[1:09:48] covers goes moves it's on fire and give
[1:09:52] it time
[1:09:54] and it becomes so solidified that even
[1:09:57] the moving of the holy spirit in its
[1:09:59] midst can't put heat that's right back
[1:10:02] in it
[1:10:04] oh
[1:10:05] think about it
[1:10:07] that's why God's going to stir his
[1:10:08] church and keep it on fire we might get
[1:10:10] a little cool sometimes but God is just
[1:10:13] going to pour a little bit more out on
[1:10:15] us amen keep us head up aren't you glad
[1:10:18] aren't you glad Hallelujah
[1:10:20] now let's go into the age of
[1:10:22] Philadelphia here Revelation 3 7.
[1:10:25] and uh
[1:10:27] so to the to the angel of the church in
[1:10:30] Philadelphia right
[1:10:31] these things saith he that is Holy he
[1:10:34] that is true he that hath the Key of
[1:10:37] David
[1:10:38] he that openeth and no man shutteth and
[1:10:41] shutteth and no man openeth now we jump
[1:10:44] to verse 12. he said him that overcometh
[1:10:48] will I make a pillar in the temple of my
[1:10:51] God and he shall go no more out
[1:10:54] and I will write upon him the name of my
[1:10:57] God and the name of the city of my God
[1:11:00] which is New Jerusalem which cometh down
[1:11:04] out of Heaven from my God and I will
[1:11:07] write upon him my new name
[1:11:10] amen now as we look at this my brother
[1:11:13] and sister we'll we I have quite a bit
[1:11:16] I'd like to expound on this but I want
[1:11:18] to just go into the Philadelphian Church
[1:11:20] age uh to just to read to you starting
[1:11:23] with paragraph 244. amen and and just
[1:11:27] really take this from from the position
[1:11:29] the prophet lays out before us he said
[1:11:32] oh let's just take it word by word for
[1:11:35] just a moment will you bear with me that
[1:11:37] long just a little bit I know it's hot
[1:11:40] you know it's hot up here too but let's
[1:11:43] see I'll make he that overcometh will I
[1:11:46] make a pillar in the temple of my God
[1:11:48] pillar a pillar or a foundation a
[1:11:52] foundation in the temple of the house
[1:11:54] the house of God the Temple of my God or
[1:11:58] the house of my God it's a pillar the
[1:12:00] foundation these are those that took the
[1:12:04] word which they heard verse 8 and went
[1:12:07] back to the foundation
[1:12:09] you see how important this is prophets
[1:12:12] laying this out we didn't start a new
[1:12:14] religion people are like well I don't
[1:12:16] know why people are so enthralled with
[1:12:18] this William Branham about everything
[1:12:20] that he's ever preached has already been
[1:12:24] preached does it say anywhere in the
[1:12:26] word that it was a new revelation it was
[1:12:29] a correct Revelation it was coming back
[1:12:33] to build the foundation because my
[1:12:36] brother and sister remember the spirits
[1:12:38] of the ages coming forward there had to
[1:12:41] be the foundation laid in Philadelphia
[1:12:44] that God could build on
[1:12:48] now Philadelphia has a lot of different
[1:12:50] titles but it was definitely the age of
[1:12:52] knowledge the age of wisdom age of man
[1:12:55] progressing and we see that in the
[1:12:57] natural that it probably was as great of
[1:12:59] time for change has ever been upon the
[1:13:02] face of the Earth although now it's
[1:13:04] pretty stunning
[1:13:06] have to admit it's pretty stunning so a
[1:13:08] lap over of that Spirit has come here I
[1:13:11] mean I remember brother Prashant God
[1:13:13] bless you brother person he got right
[1:13:15] down at Paul's level I said what are you
[1:13:18] working on right now he looks at me
[1:13:22] okay brother Paul
[1:13:24] let me just put it like this
[1:13:27] I'm writing a book on a grain of sand
[1:13:30] I don't think you'll understand it any
[1:13:32] deeper than that
[1:13:34] I think you're right brother Prashant
[1:13:37] because um
[1:13:39] yeah
[1:13:41] that's pretty small and I tend to kind
[1:13:43] of write kind of big
[1:13:46] so yeah okay good God bless you brother
[1:13:50] you know
[1:13:52] but he said brother Paul where I don't
[1:13:54] know how they how that's come for them
[1:13:56] but he said what you might recognize is
[1:13:59] a microchip
[1:14:01] we're going to shrink it
[1:14:03] to maybe a quarter of that size
[1:14:10] wow
[1:14:12] you imagine the memory that's in your
[1:14:14] phone
[1:14:16] I've been blessed to have my library at
[1:14:19] the house
[1:14:20] could have been a spare bedroom but
[1:14:23] we felt like the company would be
[1:14:24] insulted if we opened the door shoved
[1:14:26] them in pulled the doors up behind them
[1:14:28] God bless you have a good evening
[1:14:32] but we filled it full of books
[1:14:35] got most of the message
[1:14:38] in book form
[1:14:41] imagine taking all of that
[1:14:44] and putting it on a grain of sand
[1:14:48] hard to fathom
[1:14:50] this little boy can't fathom that
[1:14:53] what's God doing now
[1:14:55] he's taking this word
[1:14:58] and he's building
[1:15:00] a foundation
[1:15:02] amen
[1:15:06] Let's see we went to
[1:15:09] my
[1:15:10] was it nephew second nephew
[1:15:14] went to a birthday party last night
[1:15:16] we'll keep it that simple
[1:15:18] and uh
[1:15:21] great
[1:15:24] Mel's friend
[1:15:27] Sage
[1:15:28] was talking about how you
[1:15:30] get underneath the house how you maybe
[1:15:32] put a basement in or how you do this he
[1:15:34] was mentioning you know it's kind of
[1:15:35] like interesting how do you take a house
[1:15:36] and just put a basement under it
[1:15:38] well he's just explaining the process
[1:15:42] you realize that the church
[1:15:44] indoctrinated anchored down and God come
[1:15:48] along and says you know in the
[1:15:49] Philadelphia age we can't go any further
[1:15:51] the Overcomer of this age I'm going to
[1:15:53] make a pillar in my temple but I've got
[1:15:56] to have a foundation under this pillar
[1:15:59] so God come back through the word and
[1:16:02] excavated all of the faults out my
[1:16:04] brother and sister and dug down there
[1:16:06] and built this Foundation that a church
[1:16:09] could be built upon that God would say
[1:16:11] that's my temple that's my house that's
[1:16:13] my dwelling place and that's why people
[1:16:16] who are approaching in a denominational
[1:16:18] intellectual mindset to the message
[1:16:20] don't even understand why God needs to
[1:16:23] send a prophet how men look at you and
[1:16:25] say why would God even need to send a
[1:16:27] prophet the Bible's been around all this
[1:16:29] time because your foundation's no good
[1:16:32] your foundation will not support the
[1:16:34] word of God or the word of God won't
[1:16:36] support your theory
[1:16:39] amen so it's there the foundation of the
[1:16:41] temple the house or House of God Amen
[1:16:44] these are those that took the word that
[1:16:46] they heard and went back to the
[1:16:49] foundation look what brother branham's
[1:16:51] standing my brother and sister goes
[1:16:52] beyond the curtain of time and he's
[1:16:54] standing there and as it's all coming to
[1:16:57] pass he's saying are these branhams no
[1:17:00] these are your converts and so who are
[1:17:03] all these well Apostle Paul and what's
[1:17:06] he doing he's declaring everything's
[1:17:09] going to be okay because we've went back
[1:17:11] to the foundation and we've built upon
[1:17:15] that foundation so I'm secure and then
[1:17:18] there's a bride that says we're counting
[1:17:21] on that amen and I stand here tonight
[1:17:23] and tell you I'm counting on that
[1:17:25] because I look I'm kind of kind of
[1:17:28] pragmatic I'm kind of analytical I'm
[1:17:30] kind of a skeptic in a sense and I look
[1:17:33] over here and I don't see anything
[1:17:35] that's going to do it I look over here I
[1:17:37] don't see anything that's going to do it
[1:17:38] I'll look over here I don't see anything
[1:17:40] to do it but that's not why I believe
[1:17:43] the message my brother and sister I
[1:17:45] believe the message because I've heard a
[1:17:47] voice that was wooing me into the word
[1:17:49] and when I got into the word I realized
[1:17:52] that we have been given the foundation
[1:17:56] amen the pillar the foundation amen
[1:17:59] let's I'm just getting excited excuse me
[1:18:01] went back to the foundation now let's
[1:18:04] get Ephesians 2 19 over the Church of
[1:18:06] Ephesus you know you have to go back to
[1:18:09] Ephesus that was the beginning is is the
[1:18:12] right all right let's go back to Ephesus
[1:18:14] where Paul was the church that he
[1:18:15] established and let's see now where
[1:18:18] we're at all right the Church of Ephesus
[1:18:20] let's go back now and see what this
[1:18:23] Foundation is back there
[1:18:26] what the prophet do
[1:18:28] he didn't say let's go back to
[1:18:30] Philadelphia
[1:18:32] right because he shows us clearly in the
[1:18:34] church ages that in every age there were
[1:18:37] those who lived all the Revelation they
[1:18:40] had for their day
[1:18:42] so if he'd taken us back to Philadelphia
[1:18:44] or Sardis or Ephesian Ephesus my brother
[1:18:48] and sister we we say well we're living
[1:18:50] all the word but you see we're living in
[1:18:52] a day of the Fulfillment of perfection
[1:18:56] of the finale my brother and sister and
[1:18:59] so it's got to all be put into place and
[1:19:02] it has to be built on the right
[1:19:03] foundation look they have that big
[1:19:05] building is it Los Angeles or San
[1:19:07] Francisco or what my brother and sister
[1:19:09] they're destroying half the city around
[1:19:10] them trying to save one building
[1:19:14] and the thing just keeps on leaning
[1:19:17] I think it's a perfect spiritual type
[1:19:19] they built it when they originally built
[1:19:22] it they said this building is a proof
[1:19:28] as it slowly loses this equilibrium
[1:19:31] and falls down without even the
[1:19:34] influence of an earthquake
[1:19:37] they might be right it might be
[1:19:38] earthquake proof but it's not uh it's
[1:19:42] not secure amen I'll get distracted
[1:19:44] excuse me
[1:19:45] but look God God's not going to let them
[1:19:48] their bows stand God's not going to let
[1:19:50] this world Satan's bow stand amen so
[1:19:54] it's there I got yeah okay
[1:19:57] calm down Paul
[1:20:03] now he's talking to the Ephesians now
[1:20:05] therefore you have no more strangers or
[1:20:07] foreigners
[1:20:09] but fellow citizens with the Saints and
[1:20:11] of the household of God and are built
[1:20:14] upon the foundation of Lutheran or a
[1:20:17] Baptist no wait I got mixed up didn't
[1:20:19] die oh but are built upon the foundation
[1:20:23] of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ himself being the Chief
[1:20:27] Cornerstone everything went in at the
[1:20:30] door Jesus amen and he that overcometh
[1:20:34] will I make him a pillar in other words
[1:20:36] part of the foundation what will I give
[1:20:41] him I'll put him in the doctrine of the
[1:20:44] Apostles and prophets from the beginning
[1:20:47] and give him the revelation
[1:20:50] Hallelujah isn't that beautiful and that
[1:20:53] we don't need to be identified as some
[1:20:55] big giant pillar all shiny and carved
[1:20:58] out of marble or whatever but we have
[1:21:00] come back to the very Foundation or
[1:21:02] revelation of the word that Paul was
[1:21:06] preaching in that day and very few
[1:21:08] understood
[1:21:12] because God hid in Paul's message
[1:21:16] so much
[1:21:18] it took the ages
[1:21:20] to reveal it
[1:21:22] it took ages to unfold the real depth of
[1:21:26] what he was preaching
[1:21:29] but the word says then this day
[1:21:32] all the Mysteries
[1:21:34] will be finished
[1:21:36] aren't you glad
[1:21:37] amen God says I'm not going to go
[1:21:39] further and keep hiding this I'm going
[1:21:42] to reveal it but it's going to be as as
[1:21:44] the scripture says a select group
[1:21:47] the prophet of God very much defines it
[1:21:50] as a select group it really sounds like
[1:21:53] we're egotistical and arrogant but my
[1:21:55] brother and sister what the truth of it
[1:21:57] is is we are seeing age to age God
[1:22:01] building and perfecting his church and
[1:22:05] we are here now with that knowledge
[1:22:07] we're here with that understanding
[1:22:10] so as we look at this amen let me keep
[1:22:12] going on I just thought oh I can finish
[1:22:14] this easy tonight but not Paul amen now
[1:22:18] as well look at this my brother and
[1:22:19] sister we recognize that um as this is
[1:22:23] coming forth the age of Philadelphia one
[1:22:25] of the greatest expanse of the Gospel
[1:22:28] around the globe
[1:22:30] man had the printing press man had
[1:22:33] developed a audio recording all of these
[1:22:37] things it was there now my brother and
[1:22:39] sister visiting with brother Stan he
[1:22:41] recounted some of the Early times of him
[1:22:43] growing up around the message in the
[1:22:44] message
[1:22:45] and he said you know one thing that he
[1:22:48] learned as a young man that you can be
[1:22:50] sitting there listening to a service
[1:22:54] over a telephone wire and he said that
[1:22:56] there are those old believers they had a
[1:22:58] bunch in their church that I think
[1:22:59] they're all but one gone now and and
[1:23:01] these old Believers would witness they
[1:23:04] would declare to you these things and he
[1:23:06] had a brother in the church and he asked
[1:23:08] him he says why don't you come to church
[1:23:09] he says oh I I listen to all the
[1:23:12] services brother
[1:23:13] but he says you know brother he said um
[1:23:17] it's not the same
[1:23:20] and I know that there are those maybe
[1:23:22] even listening to this service tonight
[1:23:26] but you see it's just not the same
[1:23:30] and we have witnesses
[1:23:32] of a prophet's message and the
[1:23:34] atmosphere that was in those churches
[1:23:36] and auditoriums when the prophet was
[1:23:38] there no Holy Ghost was moving and I
[1:23:41] could tell you my brother and sister
[1:23:42] about some of my own experiences of of
[1:23:45] how God has dealt with me and in dealing
[1:23:48] with me was dealing with others and what
[1:23:51] I experienced at the time knowing that
[1:23:53] God was there and going to work but if I
[1:23:55] just tell you about that it won't move
[1:23:58] you
[1:23:59] like it did when it happened
[1:24:03] now
[1:24:04] gives my thoughts
[1:24:07] a testimony I love sister Sarah's mom
[1:24:09] and dad
[1:24:10] sitting in a service I don't remember
[1:24:12] now all the exact details but within a
[1:24:15] few rows of the front right there had
[1:24:17] some questions and it's just not real
[1:24:20] clear on the tape
[1:24:22] but brother Branham coming right over in
[1:24:24] their area looking down upon them
[1:24:27] tells them
[1:24:29] it's going to be all right it's going to
[1:24:31] that's whatever they were thinking they
[1:24:33] had some doubts or question marks and he
[1:24:35] he speaks to them now my brother and
[1:24:37] sister I've sat right at a table in the
[1:24:39] restaurant and they've shared that with
[1:24:40] me
[1:24:42] but it didn't move me
[1:24:44] I acknowledge it and I'm excited
[1:24:48] but
[1:24:49] what did it do for them
[1:24:52] their own testimony it took all those
[1:24:54] doubts away
[1:24:55] removed every question mark there was
[1:24:57] and they could move forward
[1:25:00] you see we can't live on a second hand
[1:25:03] so we can talk about everything of the
[1:25:06] previous Church ages coming right up to
[1:25:08] Philadelphia right on the doorstep of
[1:25:10] our age and we can talk about the
[1:25:12] supernatural manifestation and how God
[1:25:15] moved and what God did and what was
[1:25:18] happening in that day my brother and
[1:25:19] sister I'm I don't remember the man's
[1:25:21] name now but there was a a man who was a
[1:25:24] riding a circuit preacher in Eastern New
[1:25:28] England many many years ago and he's
[1:25:30] riding at night so he would be at a
[1:25:32] church on a Sunday morning and he's
[1:25:33] riding in his horse steps in a hole and
[1:25:35] breaks its leg and he's there and he's
[1:25:38] thinking man what am I going to do it's
[1:25:40] too far to walk I'm not going to make it
[1:25:41] to the service Lord I told them I would
[1:25:44] be there got down on his knees laid his
[1:25:47] hands on the horse's leg and said Lord
[1:25:49] you know you are ordained this Beast to
[1:25:54] carry me
[1:25:55] got up got the horse up got on him and
[1:25:58] rode
[1:25:59] my brother and sister
[1:26:01] today we got a snotty nose and we can't
[1:26:03] make it to the house of God
[1:26:06] I've done that Lord forgive us
[1:26:08] amen I'm not throwing a stone at no one
[1:26:11] but you see the difference is that we're
[1:26:13] living in a shadow and they were living
[1:26:16] in the presence
[1:26:18] I don't want to live in the shadow I
[1:26:19] want to live in the presence
[1:26:21] I don't want to shadow in our church I
[1:26:23] want the presence in our church I want
[1:26:25] the power of God in this building I want
[1:26:27] the power of God in our lives amen and
[1:26:31] I'm not preaching down to anybody I'm
[1:26:32] just telling you that's the difference
[1:26:34] that's coming the age because we can sit
[1:26:37] here tonight and talk about all the
[1:26:40] supernatural that happened in brother
[1:26:41] branham's Ministry but we should be able
[1:26:44] here tonight talk about the supernatural
[1:26:47] that's happening in our ministry oh wait
[1:26:50] my wife has a Ministry you better
[1:26:52] believe she's got a Ministry our
[1:26:55] children have a Ministry we Brothers
[1:26:57] have a Ministry my brother and sister
[1:26:59] and we should be able tonight to recount
[1:27:02] what the Supernatural is moving in our
[1:27:06] presence we don't need to say brother
[1:27:08] so-and-so's church over here and brother
[1:27:10] so-and-so's church over here has got a
[1:27:12] supernatural move in its midst we should
[1:27:15] be able to say God is in Grace
[1:27:17] Tabernacle moving and changing and
[1:27:19] delivering and opening the word it
[1:27:22] should be that alive to us
[1:27:25] yeah
[1:27:27] Hallelujah I don't want to live in
[1:27:28] another age I want to live in this age I
[1:27:31] don't want to live under the witness of
[1:27:33] a anointing of a spirit of another day I
[1:27:36] want to live under the witness of the
[1:27:38] anointing of that Spirit here today in
[1:27:41] my life
[1:27:42] now I'm sorry I'm getting excited
[1:27:44] Hallelujah
[1:27:45] Hallelujah
[1:27:47] oh my
[1:27:52] you know I like some of these quotes
[1:27:53] because like brother Brown was starting
[1:27:55] that quote there let's take a word by
[1:27:57] word for just a moment will you bear
[1:27:58] with me amen
[1:28:01] so you know if I ask you to bear with me
[1:28:02] just remember I'm just quoting the
[1:28:04] prophet
[1:28:06] yeah
[1:28:07] I hope you don't mind the humor
[1:28:10] now as we look at this
[1:28:11] coming right down to our day
[1:28:14] Revelations 3. 14.
[1:28:17] and unto the angel of the Church of the
[1:28:19] laodiceans right
[1:28:21] these things saith thee amen the
[1:28:24] faithful and true witness the beginning
[1:28:26] of the creation of God
[1:28:29] now my brother and sister this is none
[1:28:31] other than our Lord Jesus Christ that's
[1:28:33] commissioning this because all things
[1:28:35] were made for him and by him by him and
[1:28:38] for him amen so you look at that that
[1:28:41] there it is the very essence this is the
[1:28:45] word
[1:28:46] from the foundation
[1:28:49] actually
[1:28:50] before the foundation
[1:28:52] because
[1:28:54] at the foundation time God was already
[1:28:57] speaking
[1:28:58] to lay the foundation
[1:29:00] are you with me it could be about a
[1:29:03] four-hour sermon if we tied that
[1:29:04] Foundation back to the foundation we
[1:29:06] just talked about because my brother and
[1:29:08] sister I'll just if I can just bring it
[1:29:10] very brief
[1:29:12] I want to ask you a question you might
[1:29:14] think it's rhetorical you might think
[1:29:15] it's ridiculous that I would ask you but
[1:29:17] I want to ask you and you need to answer
[1:29:19] if you would please humor me and answer
[1:29:21] it to yourself were you in Christ
[1:29:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:29:32] that should just settle where this word
[1:29:34] come from
[1:29:36] this should just settle it to us of
[1:29:39] where we fit in the plan of God but
[1:29:42] brother Paul I make mistakes it doesn't
[1:29:44] say before you made mistakes
[1:29:48] or
[1:29:50] after you made mistakes those are things
[1:29:52] we quantify
[1:29:54] those are things that Satan magnifies
[1:29:57] but God wants to identify you were in me
[1:30:02] before the foundation of the world and
[1:30:05] if you're in me then you are of me
[1:30:08] you know they have proven isn't it
[1:30:10] amazing you know some of these whodunit
[1:30:12] type things you know there was a mystery
[1:30:14] of something somebody you know
[1:30:16] assaulted or killed somebody and in the
[1:30:19] old days they just kind of had to go
[1:30:21] around and try and figure out oh here's
[1:30:23] a boot print and here's this and here's
[1:30:24] that but look at what's happening my
[1:30:26] brother and sister and you'll find that
[1:30:28] all of Nature and all of mankind and all
[1:30:31] knowledge has a foundation back in the
[1:30:34] word that has a mirror image of it
[1:30:37] coming out and now my brother and sister
[1:30:39] they can take even the slightest bit of
[1:30:43] your saliva and identify Who You Are
[1:30:48] not only that they can tie you to your
[1:30:51] daddy
[1:30:56] Hallelujah can I dance and get a little
[1:30:58] excited tonight everything the devil
[1:31:01] told me turned out to be a lie because
[1:31:03] they took just one little snippet of
[1:31:06] this no good piece of Flesh and proved
[1:31:09] who I belong to amen it isn't what the
[1:31:13] devil said it isn't what they said it
[1:31:16] wasn't what the church said because if
[1:31:18] you go back in the foundation of my
[1:31:20] family I would have to tell you tonight
[1:31:22] that I'm a Latter-Day Saint
[1:31:27] thank you brother David
[1:31:30] Hallelujah
[1:31:32] or
[1:31:34] as brother Stan shared a joke with me
[1:31:36] about this guy everybody knows this guy
[1:31:39] and they took him to the hardware store
[1:31:40] the banks and they went to the mayor and
[1:31:42] they went to the governor and they went
[1:31:43] to everywhere and the guy says I'll tell
[1:31:45] you what I'll go to one place where they
[1:31:47] won't know you and so they go to the
[1:31:49] Vatican and the guy goes in there and
[1:31:51] here this guy comes out old Charlie
[1:31:52] comes out on the balcony he's standing
[1:31:54] there with the Pope and he turns to the
[1:31:57] guy and says hey hey you know them he
[1:31:59] said well I know Charlie but I don't
[1:32:01] know that other guy
[1:32:05] my brother and sister that's how God's
[1:32:07] looking down
[1:32:09] he knows who we are
[1:32:11] there's no way that we can camouflage or
[1:32:15] be done and Satan can do he knows who we
[1:32:18] are and so what is he doing here to this
[1:32:21] he's taking us right back to the very
[1:32:24] beginning that is the foundation look
[1:32:26] how this ties together so beautifully
[1:32:28] this is the foundation the beginning
[1:32:32] amen so these these ages and these words
[1:32:36] tying together they're not individual
[1:32:38] thoughts of the age but if we was and I
[1:32:41] just want to make this point to you if
[1:32:42] we was in in a smarter way than Paul can
[1:32:45] do it just remove the Clutter as it were
[1:32:48] but it's the word of God so it's not
[1:32:49] clutter but if you know what I mean and
[1:32:51] we could remove all of that you could
[1:32:52] build a phrase as it were of the
[1:32:55] Overcomer of every age and it has
[1:32:58] cohesion it has continuity it makes
[1:33:01] sense God building the church from the
[1:33:03] beginning oh I tell you I just love that
[1:33:05] the other night reading that my brother
[1:33:07] and sister God allowed you and I to go
[1:33:09] behind the veil that was rent he allowed
[1:33:12] us didn't strike us dead that was
[1:33:14] Through the Ages those old prophets and
[1:33:16] all those priests they had to be as it
[1:33:19] were so totally prepared and so careful
[1:33:22] but we as Sons and Daughters of God not
[1:33:24] careless but sons of daughters of God we
[1:33:27] can go behind that Veil and we can reach
[1:33:29] into that Golden Pond and we can pull
[1:33:31] the Manna of the word out and we we can
[1:33:33] eat that word in this hour and God says
[1:33:36] I'll bless you for coming and reaching
[1:33:39] into the pond and taking this word and I
[1:33:42] bless you for eating the word and
[1:33:44] believing and confessing it
[1:33:47] and for them it was death but for you
[1:33:49] and I it's life
[1:33:51] Oh look The continuity I'm not going to
[1:33:53] repreach this tonight but look at this
[1:33:55] it comes right down through here and
[1:33:58] everything tied together shows us that
[1:34:00] God was actually building a church
[1:34:03] he was building a people then in the
[1:34:06] worst of times
[1:34:08] in an age where lies become truth and
[1:34:11] truth becomes lies and darkness is
[1:34:13] settled upon the land my brother and
[1:34:15] sister if you want the natural now we
[1:34:18] can't go back there but if you would
[1:34:19] want the natural example that I believe
[1:34:22] would be closest to the day we live in
[1:34:25] is when darkness settled everywhere but
[1:34:29] Goshen
[1:34:32] they were all in darkness
[1:34:36] and they couldn't explain
[1:34:38] why there was light in Goshen
[1:34:41] now I've heard some brothers say that
[1:34:43] God veiled their eyes and they actually
[1:34:45] didn't see
[1:34:46] the light that was in Goshen
[1:34:49] I hadn't really thought that through but
[1:34:51] in a sense it would make sense
[1:34:54] but I believe
[1:34:56] they see the light
[1:34:59] because they see you
[1:35:02] they see your life
[1:35:05] so there's Darkness here
[1:35:08] but there's light walking in their midst
[1:35:12] isn't it interesting how people come up
[1:35:14] with all kinds of theorems on the word
[1:35:17] I never I walk out that door right there
[1:35:19] but when I stop and say Lord let me only
[1:35:21] preach truth
[1:35:22] all I want to ever preach is truth Lord
[1:35:26] I don't want to be the guy that starts
[1:35:28] some new revelation that swept through
[1:35:29] the message I'm just fine with the tried
[1:35:32] and the true I'm just fine my brother
[1:35:35] and sister
[1:35:36] yeah
[1:35:38] Amen to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:35:41] to sit with me now look at this we've
[1:35:43] progressed from going behind the veil
[1:35:45] and getting Manna out of the pot
[1:35:48] and now we've
[1:35:50] moved up here and we become the very
[1:35:53] Foundation the pillar
[1:35:55] but look what God's doing everything is
[1:35:57] moving us closer and closer and closer
[1:36:00] to him
[1:36:02] now I say it's wonderful to be a pillar
[1:36:05] in the house of God
[1:36:06] but I'll tell you what I gotta move and
[1:36:08] you got to move beyond the pillar status
[1:36:10] and we get to sit with him in his throne
[1:36:14] the prophet of God elaborates this not
[1:36:17] on the throne my brother and sister it's
[1:36:19] not on the throne we are in Christ
[1:36:23] amen not on the throne hey we've got the
[1:36:27] revelation of God you know we can no my
[1:36:29] brother and sister he's drawing us into
[1:36:31] himself
[1:36:33] oh Hallelujah
[1:36:36] now look here and how can I overcome
[1:36:39] I don't know if any of you have listened
[1:36:41] to this sermon lately
[1:36:43] but how can I overcome is Scott just a
[1:36:46] ton of nuggets in it Amen brother Chris
[1:36:49] and I was just discussing something
[1:36:50] along that line the other day and I
[1:36:53] would say brother Chris that that was
[1:36:54] inspired but I already had these notes
[1:36:58] amen
[1:36:59] but look at this did you notice the
[1:37:02] arrangements of that
[1:37:03] see
[1:37:04] set with me in my Throne not on my
[1:37:07] throne in my Throne that's in his domain
[1:37:12] see and there as Christ is the ruler
[1:37:16] Throne ruler at this time of the
[1:37:19] complete domain of God so will the
[1:37:22] church be with him did you catch that
[1:37:27] in the complete domain
[1:37:31] not me or you sitting in church going
[1:37:35] whoa unto me
[1:37:38] I just keep failing
[1:37:40] I don't know if I can do this can I
[1:37:42] really be a Christian the devil's like
[1:37:44] of course you're not
[1:37:46] of course you're not you have identity
[1:37:48] crisis
[1:37:49] just like the girl with the purple hair
[1:37:51] and the guy who don't know what he is
[1:37:53] identity crisis
[1:37:56] but
[1:37:57] believe the word
[1:38:00] and the word really is all that I care
[1:38:03] for
[1:38:06] and then we wake up
[1:38:10] God Opening Our Eyes one more time
[1:38:13] and we realized it never was me that's
[1:38:18] right
[1:38:19] I could not make it to the throne room
[1:38:22] I could not go and say I believe I'll
[1:38:25] just sit down here by my Lord
[1:38:28] and everything will be all right
[1:38:31] what did he do
[1:38:34] he drew us
[1:38:35] right into himself
[1:38:39] now if we was to look in the mirror
[1:38:41] tonight
[1:38:42] it's actually interesting exercise
[1:38:47] they do this in a lot of different
[1:38:48] Realms I won't go into that
[1:38:51] but you know one of these exercises in a
[1:38:54] self-identity class that sounds strange
[1:38:56] doesn't it self-identity class
[1:38:58] because I I want to know who I am so I
[1:39:00] actually believe in self-identity
[1:39:03] yeah see I already mentioned it earlier
[1:39:05] in the service see you have to see
[1:39:07] yourself in the word
[1:39:09] so we really this sounds like psychology
[1:39:12] and forgive me but you have to have a
[1:39:14] self-identity
[1:39:16] because if you don't identify in this
[1:39:18] age if you don't identify in Christ you
[1:39:20] will identify in something else you're
[1:39:23] not going to just stand here void of an
[1:39:24] identity
[1:39:25] and so in these self-identity classes
[1:39:28] they have these people come up in front
[1:39:30] of the group I mean isn't that what you
[1:39:32] would always like to do
[1:39:34] hi I'm Paul I'm here because I have
[1:39:37] problems
[1:39:42] stand in front of the mirror and tell
[1:39:44] all the rest of us
[1:39:46] what you see
[1:39:48] well there's a story that goes with that
[1:39:50] this guy's been a drunk alcoholic all
[1:39:54] that you name the whole stuff he goes to
[1:39:56] one of those classes mandated by the
[1:39:58] court
[1:40:00] and he's standing there
[1:40:02] and he'd caught such a revelation of who
[1:40:04] he was in Jesus Christ
[1:40:06] they said now tell us what you see
[1:40:10] he stands right there for the longest
[1:40:13] time they're like okay go ahead speak
[1:40:16] said okay but I don't think you're gonna
[1:40:17] like it oh we can handle anything
[1:40:20] I see a redeemed
[1:40:23] Son of God
[1:40:25] you're delusional
[1:40:33] what do you see in the mirror tonight
[1:40:35] Hallelujah I don't see Paul heylett the
[1:40:39] son of David and Geraldine Halen I see a
[1:40:42] Son of God Amen I see myself not sitting
[1:40:46] on a throne sitting on the side saying
[1:40:49] oh I made it I just crawled into heaven
[1:40:51] I used to believe that saint that I used
[1:40:53] to confess that when when I was making
[1:40:55] my transition back to serve God I would
[1:40:57] even tell sister Jerry if I can just
[1:40:59] crawl and drag myself over the threshold
[1:41:02] of Heaven
[1:41:04] but ask me how I feel about that now I'm
[1:41:07] not going to drag myself over the
[1:41:09] threshold of Heaven I am going to walk
[1:41:11] in and they're going to say who are you
[1:41:13] and I'm going to say my name is Mrs
[1:41:15] Jesus Christ
[1:41:18] Hallelujah
[1:41:20] that's the perfect type of that she
[1:41:22] didn't stand there and say I hope he
[1:41:24] doesn't banish me no sir she knew he
[1:41:27] wouldn't banish her because she knew she
[1:41:29] was his wife and he was her husband she
[1:41:34] had no fear
[1:41:35] hey Hallelujah
[1:41:39] my I was asking brother Alex if he had
[1:41:41] maybe help me rewrite a song Amen and uh
[1:41:45] first thing he did is correct me I'd
[1:41:46] been singing it wrong all day long in
[1:41:48] the tractor
[1:41:49] but I like my version of the song and I
[1:41:53] might I might see if I can't you know
[1:41:55] turn it to a song and maybe teach it to
[1:41:58] you so you can all sing it wrong amen
[1:42:02] what is it the complete domain of God so
[1:42:06] will the church be with him the bride be
[1:42:08] with him in his throne in the entire
[1:42:11] domain scene not on my throne but in my
[1:42:14] Throne seat where his domain reaches a
[1:42:17] throne is over a domain and a domain
[1:42:20] reaches just as far as its boundaries
[1:42:23] does and this is from eternity to
[1:42:26] Eternity now I want to ask you what has
[1:42:28] God given you authority over Hallelujah
[1:42:31] I'm just trying to get authority over my
[1:42:33] wild children I'm just trying to get
[1:42:35] authority over my relationship with my
[1:42:37] husband I'm trying to get authority over
[1:42:39] my temper I'm trying why don't you set
[1:42:42] your sights a little higher and realize
[1:42:44] when you realize you've got authority
[1:42:47] over eternity to Eternity the rest of
[1:42:50] these things we've placed so much value
[1:42:53] on
[1:42:55] you're trying to take my identity from
[1:42:57] me I sure am
[1:42:59] and so is the Lord
[1:43:01] because he's given us a much greater
[1:43:04] identity
[1:43:05] Hallelujah so we could see and this is
[1:43:08] from eternity eternity let me finish I
[1:43:10] don't even know what time it is oh my
[1:43:13] oh my
[1:43:15] I shall get over saying this won't be
[1:43:18] very long
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:22] see modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:43:24] just pulling this out paragraph 177 the
[1:43:28] believer can see the word made Flash the
[1:43:31] others cannot do it
[1:43:33] Hallelujah now let me remind you of I am
[1:43:37] interpreting the prophet's quote there
[1:43:39] let me get the mirror out let me get the
[1:43:42] mirror out the believer can see Christ
[1:43:47] amen see God see our lord Jesus made
[1:43:50] flesh
[1:43:52] and you're going to say but that's me in
[1:43:54] the mirror yeah that's right
[1:43:56] that's right Hallelujah
[1:43:59] oh my some people think it's going to be
[1:44:01] brother branham's image looking back at
[1:44:02] him
[1:44:04] oh my goodness
[1:44:07] so let me close this out Through the
[1:44:09] Ages Every Revelation every portion is
[1:44:12] relevant to the next and to the previous
[1:44:16] and I say the previous my brother and
[1:44:18] sister because the prophets and sages of
[1:44:20] old
[1:44:21] those faithful Godly men
[1:44:23] are looking and saying
[1:44:25] Lord if they don't want to be there I'll
[1:44:28] gladly I'll gladly take their position
[1:44:31] and there's a spirit in the land
[1:44:34] well if we could just go back
[1:44:37] and just live in those days
[1:44:40] my brother and sister
[1:44:42] when we do the resume at the ages you'll
[1:44:45] see
[1:44:45] the spiritual the the
[1:44:48] religious spirits
[1:44:50] of that day
[1:44:52] we're so strong
[1:44:54] and so convincing
[1:44:57] that if you think you would go back
[1:44:59] there
[1:45:00] because it would be easy
[1:45:02] you would find that you'd say Lord
[1:45:05] send me back to laodicea where I have
[1:45:08] all the word opened to me
[1:45:11] where I can identify I'm not trying to
[1:45:14] figure out
[1:45:16] who is this Man From Galilee this
[1:45:18] Nazarene who is this we've got open word
[1:45:21] amen amen the devil's clearly marked
[1:45:25] Hallelujah
[1:45:28] oh
[1:45:30] my come sister so I can stop preaching
[1:45:33] amen
[1:45:35] let's just take a very quick summary can
[1:45:37] we have a like a couple more minutes I'd
[1:45:40] like to brother Stan's deal
[1:45:42] I like that can I have just a little bit
[1:45:44] more maybe just an hour
[1:45:47] okay let's take this little quick
[1:45:49] summary
[1:45:50] First Age we get to eat of the Tree of
[1:45:52] Life That's Christ himself
[1:45:55] second age we're free of the second
[1:45:57] deaths free of spiritual death
[1:46:00] I really am lacking the hidden Manna
[1:46:03] amen because between the lines lies the
[1:46:07] revelation of God
[1:46:11] if it wasn't between the lines my
[1:46:13] brother and sister the word says that he
[1:46:15] had to hide it lest they would see and
[1:46:17] he'd have to heal them that heel is
[1:46:20] talking about restoring
[1:46:24] so we look at that power of the Nations
[1:46:29] this ties directly
[1:46:31] amen of us having power
[1:46:35] over the atmosphere where we live right
[1:46:38] here this is not you and I going over to
[1:46:40] the U.N and walking in there and
[1:46:43] this is power over our world here
[1:46:48] amen
[1:46:50] white Raymond clothed in the word
[1:46:53] Christ himself confessing our name you
[1:46:57] know there's always a little name
[1:46:59] dropping ghost in life business have
[1:47:01] somebody call you if I call me today
[1:47:04] oh yeah well now so and so
[1:47:06] okay I'm thinking what's that got to do
[1:47:08] with it
[1:47:10] I want to sell your farm my farm is not
[1:47:12] for sale well when you decide to sell
[1:47:14] your farm I'd like to sell your farm for
[1:47:16] I'll have forgotten who you are by then
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:20] but you see what they're trying to do is
[1:47:22] they're trying to find a way to relate
[1:47:25] to you and let me put it this way
[1:47:28] my brother and sister the devil is
[1:47:31] working really hard
[1:47:33] to find a way
[1:47:34] to relate to you
[1:47:38] and Christ is here saying
[1:47:41] I can relate to you bring all your heavy
[1:47:45] burdens
[1:47:46] bring all the pain bring all the sorrow
[1:47:49] bring all the disappointment
[1:47:51] I can relate
[1:47:53] Hallelujah
[1:47:54] Hallelujah I'd like to elaborate on that
[1:47:57] but I've kept you too long
[1:47:59] then we see becoming a pillar the word
[1:48:03] having to go back to the foundation amen
[1:48:06] so that God could build a rapture
[1:48:10] in you
[1:48:11] come on that's what he's doing Saints
[1:48:13] God's Building the Rapture In You and I
[1:48:17] people are like I'm waiting for the
[1:48:18] Rapture if you're not in the Rapture
[1:48:20] right now my brother and sister you're
[1:48:21] not going to be in that Rapture amen
[1:48:24] this catching away catching away from
[1:48:25] the spirit of laodicea and all the
[1:48:28] spirits of Ages gone by and catching us
[1:48:30] away from ourself
[1:48:32] we can be sitting here saying oh praise
[1:48:34] God I've got free from the spirit of
[1:48:35] laodicea but if we're not free from
[1:48:38] ourself we're not really free from the
[1:48:39] spirit of laodicea amen so God's coming
[1:48:43] and he's bringing us and delivering us
[1:48:45] from this amen and then we get to sit
[1:48:48] with Christ in his throne
[1:48:52] for a guy that for a few minutes today
[1:48:55] had a real strong mental struggle
[1:49:00] um
[1:49:00] no those won't be appropriate words
[1:49:02] useful
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:10] it's hard for us to see sometimes that
[1:49:12] we're sitting in domain Authority
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:17] it's hard for us to grasp
[1:49:21] as a song says some Midnight Hour if you
[1:49:24] should find they don't have to be
[1:49:25] midnight it can be noon
[1:49:27] it can be nine in the morning and be
[1:49:29] three in the afternoon
[1:49:30] but some mine some Midnight Hour if you
[1:49:34] should find you're in a prison in your
[1:49:36] mind amen you don't need bars around you
[1:49:39] if your mind's in a prison my brother
[1:49:41] and sister you don't need no other bars
[1:49:43] around you
[1:49:44] but what is this domain Authority say
[1:49:46] brother Paul domain Authority that's
[1:49:48] where you stop and say Lord you know who
[1:49:51] I am you know my heart
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:56] live
[1:49:57] I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:50:01] and the rest of your day
[1:50:04] as though that never happened
[1:50:08] why
[1:50:09] Mind Over Matter
[1:50:12] if it's God's mind it's definitely over
[1:50:14] the matter but not our mind over the
[1:50:17] matter no that Sons and Daughters of God
[1:50:19] that have a revel and I have domain
[1:50:21] Authority amen God's over everything and
[1:50:24] I'm in God and God's in me hallelujah
[1:50:26] hallelujah
[1:50:28] I I really thought this wouldn't take
[1:50:30] this long I I yeah

[1:51:06] resting on
[1:51:10] your way

[1:51:44] mean that I have found Lord plant my
[1:51:49] feet on higher grounds my heart has
[1:51:55] no desire to stay where doubts

[1:52:16] Lord Lift Me Up and let me stand
[1:52:23] there by faith on

[1:52:31] plane that I have found Lord plant my
[1:52:36] feet on higher ground
[1:52:40] I want to
[1:52:42] live above the world no Satan's darts
[1:52:49] at me or heard
[1:52:52] for Faith was gone
[1:52:55] other joyful sound of the song of Saints
[1:53:01] on Higher Ground Hallelujah
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:22] plant my feet on higher ground I want to
[1:53:30] scale the utmost
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:39] but still I'll pray
[1:53:43] still have not found
[1:53:46] Lord lead me onto Higher Ground
[1:53:51] Lord let's be up and let me stand by
[1:53:57] faith on

[1:54:32] redeemed
[1:54:34] 556
[1:54:36] redeemed our love to Proclaim it
[1:54:39] ought to be our confession my brother
[1:54:41] and sister you know I was listened to a
[1:54:43] brother preach the other to me
[1:54:45] he made a statement I thought it was
[1:54:48] the problem is you see we get in a
[1:54:50] situation maybe he is the example you
[1:54:53] lose your temper
[1:54:55] and that creates an atmosphere right
[1:54:58] there
[1:54:59] and then you start to dwell in that
[1:55:01] atmosphere and it's easy to lose your
[1:55:03] temper again and it's strange we can
[1:55:04] lose our temper 10 times a day but still
[1:55:07] find it
[1:55:09] yeah but if we start confessing
[1:55:15] I'm redeemed
[1:55:16] I'm redeemed I just lost my temper but
[1:55:19] Lord forgive me because I'm redeemed
[1:55:21] amen the prices paid the evidence is
[1:55:25] there the title deed is filled out I'm
[1:55:27] redeemed and I just love that and it
[1:55:30] just registers in my heart that ought to
[1:55:32] be our answer to our problems
[1:55:34] Satan you're right I lost my temper but
[1:55:37] I'm redeemed
[1:55:39] the blood of Jesus is sufficient
