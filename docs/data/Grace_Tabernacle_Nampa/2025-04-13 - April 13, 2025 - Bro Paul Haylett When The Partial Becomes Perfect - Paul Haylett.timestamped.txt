[9:00] Heat. Heat.
[9:15] [Music]
[9:33] on the mic.
[9:35] Um, let's start with that song,
[9:37] Boundless Love. She's
[9:40] playing number 866.
[9:46] There is not a
[9:48] mother, sister, friend, or brother loves
[9:52] the way that Jesus
[9:56] can. He proved his love for me when he
[10:00] died on
[10:02] Calvary. He gave his life for fallen
[10:06] men.
[10:08] Oh, his
[10:10] love is a
[10:12] boundless love and it reaches down and
[10:16] touches
[10:19] me. His
[10:21] love is an endless love that will last
[10:26] through all
[10:31] eternity. Jesus wants to love you. There
[10:35] is none above you. You are precious in
[10:40] his
[10:42] sight. He will never fail you. When the
[10:46] doubts assail you, he'll be with you day
[10:51] and
[10:53] night. His
[10:55] love is a boundless love and it reaches
[11:01] down and touches me.
[11:05] His
[11:07] love is an endless love that will last
[11:12] through all
[11:14] eternity. Jesus wants to love you. Oh
[11:17] Jesus wants to love you. There is none
[11:21] above you. You are precious in his
[11:26] sight.
[11:29] He will never fail you. When the doubts
[11:33] assail you, he'll be with you day and
[11:38] night. Oh, his
[11:42] love is a boundless love and it reaches
[11:47] down and touches
[11:50] me. His
[11:53] love is an endless love that will last
[11:58] through all
[12:00] eternity. His love, oh his
[12:05] love is a boundless love and it reaches
[12:10] down and touches
[12:13] me. His
[12:16] love is an endless love that will last
[12:21] through all
[12:24] eternity. Oh, that will last through all
[12:29] [Music]
[12:31] eternity. Amen. Well, why don't we dance
[12:33] together? Number
[12:41] 834. Through my
[12:44] disappointments, strife and
[12:47] discontentment, I cast my every care
[12:50] upon the
[12:53] Lord. No matter what
[12:56] obsession, pain, or deep depression, I'm
[13:00] standing on the solid
[13:04] rock. I'm
[13:06] standing on the rock of ages.
[13:12] Save from every storm that rages.
[13:17] Rich, but not from
[13:20] Satan's wages. I'm standing on the solid
[13:27] rock. Even though he's gone now, I don't
[13:32] feel alone now. With comfort came the
[13:35] spirit of the Lord.
[13:39] Now with his hand to guide me from
[13:43] temptation, hide me. I'm standing on the
[13:47] solid
[13:50] rock. I'm
[13:52] standing on the rock of ages.
[13:58] Save from every storm that
[14:02] rages.
[14:04] Rich, but not from
[14:06] Satan's wages. I'm standing on the solid
[14:13] rock. Now I'm pressing
[14:16] onward. Each step leads me homeward. I'm
[14:20] trusting in my Savior day by
[14:25] day. Close is our
[14:28] relation. Firm it says foundation. I'm
[14:32] standing on the solid rock.
[14:37] I'm
[14:38] standing on the rock of ages.
[14:44] Safe from every storm that rages.
[14:50] Rich, but not from Satan's wages. I'm
[14:55] standing on a solid
[14:58] rock. Oh, I'm
[15:01] standing on the rock of ages.
[15:07] Save from every storm that
[15:12] rages. Rich, but not from Satan's wages.
[15:17] I'm standing on the solid
[15:22] rock. Amen. Number 584, please.
[15:33] Blessed
[15:37] asssurance Jesus is mine.
[15:43] Oh, what a
[15:47] foraste of glory
[15:53] divine. Heir of

[16:03] God, born of his

[17:07] Visions of
[17:10] rapture now burst on my
[17:16] side. Angels

[17:26] above. Echoes of
[17:31] mercy whispers of love.

[22:41] lamb. Amen. We're going to go to prayer.
[22:44] Have a few prayer requests.
[22:48] [Music]
[22:55] Um I have another one uh note saying
[22:58] from sister Susan. Um want to thank the
[23:00] Lord for touching my uh thumb. The
[23:03] swelling is almost gone and just uh
[23:06] praying for continual continual touch of
[23:09] healing. Amen. Um, also let's remember
[23:12] brother Ivan, sister Nadia as they
[23:13] travel as well as brother David, sister
[23:16] Diane and sister
[23:17] Ruth and uh also sister
[23:21] April and
[23:23] uh let's remember sister Dorcas for
[23:26] healing and for health for brother
[23:28] Gideon and uh brother Basile and brother
[23:31] Sergey as they're either on the road or
[23:34] brother Sergey will be heading out today
[23:36] and also brother Paul and sister Jerry
[23:39] traveling
[23:40] heading out tomorrow. Brother Trevor,
[23:42] could you pray for these
[23:47] needs? God bless
[23:50] you, hope you guys don't mind me just
[23:52] sharing a little something with you. Uh
[23:54] we just went to Evening Light Fellowship
[23:57] last last weekend for the meetings and
[24:00] they were very good.
[24:02] Uh brother Jason Watkins took the
[24:05] evening ones, two of them. Brother Chad
[24:08] Lamb took the morning ones, two of them,
[24:11] and they were both just very good. If
[24:13] you guys could, you should watch them.
[24:16] They're they're very amazing.
[24:18] Um, brother
[24:21] Jason, his Saturday night message was
[24:24] about onward and upward. And it really
[24:27] relies on it refers to brother
[24:30] Brandham's vision of the churches
[24:32] marching by, the church of America going
[24:34] down, but the church of the bride going
[24:37] up.
[24:38] And
[24:40] um just to move forward with the message
[24:44] in the truth in Christ is to move up. To
[24:48] move forward, to move onward is to move
[24:51] upward. But he said, "If you don't move
[24:54] and you just stand still, the world is
[24:56] going so fast
[24:59] downward that you're backsliding just by
[25:02] staying still because the world is just
[25:06] getting darker and it's going right past
[25:08] us and it's leaving us in putting us in
[25:11] darkness." That's just a tremendous
[25:14] thought. Yes.
[25:16] [Music]
[25:17] So, okay, let's bow our heads, saints,
[25:20] brothers and
[25:24] sisters. Let's just all give
[25:26] our
[25:28] attention to the great God. Lord, we
[25:32] love you, Lord Jesus. We're so grateful
[25:34] that you speak to us. You meet every
[25:36] need. Father, we're hungry this morning
[25:38] and we're asking, Lord Jesus, for you to
[25:40] come meet us again as we've seen you do
[25:42] so many times, Lord. And we don't want
[25:45] it to get old. We don't want to become
[25:47] complacent, Father. But we're so
[25:48] grateful that you meet our need. Speak
[25:51] to every heart here,
[25:52] Father, to whatever we have need of. And
[25:55] you know our needs greater than we do,
[25:56] Lord Jesus. I lift up all of these Lord
[26:01] requests, this praise report from our
[26:03] sister Susan um being healed. Lord, we
[26:05] just give you glory for that and just
[26:07] pray continue healing for that. And
[26:10] Lord, there's many traveling. Uh,
[26:12] Brother Ivan, Sister Nadia, the Dean
[26:14] Harts, and Brother Vasilia, and Brother
[26:16] Sergey will be leaving. And we just pray
[26:18] that you be with them as they travel,
[26:20] Lord Jesus. Sister Dorcas, and and her
[26:23] needs, Lord, for healing
[26:26] and for her family, Lord Jesus. We just
[26:30] and I'm sure there are many other spoken
[26:32] and unspoken requests, Lord. And I lift
[26:35] my own hand, Lord Jesus. Just pray that
[26:37] you would meet every need, touch every
[26:39] heart.
[26:40] Father, you know our needs, Lord, and we
[26:43] we just rest knowing that you know them
[26:45] and that you will answer them in your
[26:46] time, Lord
[26:47] Jesus. Father, come and minister to us
[26:50] the words of life. We pray speak through
[26:52] our brother
[26:54] Paul and Lord, listen and hear through
[26:58] every believer
[27:00] here. We love you, Lord. We pray that
[27:02] you would bless the tithes and the
[27:03] offerings and the cheerful giver. And we
[27:06] love you, Lord. In the precious name of
[27:07] Jesus Christ, we pray.
[27:11] Amen. You may be
[27:16] seated. Once again, God bless you
[27:19] all who can be here. Everybody listening
[27:21] on the internet. God bless you. Uh we do
[27:24] have a special sister Jerry.
[27:35] [Music]
[27:49] from the
[27:54] beginning. You've been unchanging.
[28:02] Age to age you
[28:07] stay. Constant you
[28:11] remain every
[28:16] mystery. The questions I've
[28:20] [Music]
[28:23] carried are safe within your will.
[28:29] Though I trust you, even
[28:33] still I
[28:37] believe you are who you say you
[28:42] are. You'll do what you say you'll
[28:47] do. You'll come
[28:50] through. You
[28:53] are
[28:54] always faithful.
[28:58] [Music]
[29:07] Oh, okay. Sorry, I lost my place. Jesus,
[29:10] show for
[29:14] me, holding me steady.
[29:22] Every word you
[29:25] speak is a promise that you
[29:30] keep. This firm
[29:36] foundation cannot be
[29:42] shaken. My God, you never fail.
[29:48] Never once, you never
[29:52] will. I
[29:56] believe you are who you say you
[30:01] are. You'll do what you say you'll
[30:06] do. You'll come
[30:09] through. You are
[30:13] all faithful.
[30:22] So
[30:27] I'm
[30:29] that that on the cross your blood was
[30:34] spilled and by your stripes I have been
[30:39] healed. and every promise you fulfill. I
[30:47] believe I
[30:49] believe that you rose again in
[30:55] victory. And that same power lives in
[31:01] me. I've been born again. I've been set
[31:06] free. I
[31:08] believe. I
[31:10] believe that the gates of hell will not
[31:17] prevail. Your church is still alive and
[31:22] well. This gospel truth I'll live to
[31:27] tell. I
[31:29] believe I
[31:32] believe that one day soon you'll split
[31:37] the sky. You're coming for a spotless
[31:43] bride until my faith has been made
[31:48] sight. I
[31:51] believe. I
[31:56] believe you are who you say you
[32:02] are. You'll do what you say you'll do.
[32:08] You'll come
[32:09] through. You
[32:11] are
[32:13] always
[32:15] aable. I
[32:18] believe you've already made a
[32:23] way. So I'm running through parted
[32:28] waves straight to you.
[32:32] You are
[32:35] always
[32:37] faithful, I
[32:42] believe. And on that day I've run my
[32:48] race. I'll finally see you face to face.
[32:54] And nothing will then separate.
[32:59] I
[33:01] believe. I
[33:04] believe. I'll join with every tribe and
[33:09] tongue and bow before the lamb of God
[33:15] singing,
[33:16] "Holy, holy, holy one, I believe.
[33:25] I believe
[33:27] [Music]
[33:36] he Thank you, Sister Jerry. That was
[33:39] beautiful song. Enjoy
[33:46] that. Let's just sing song number 895 as

[34:53] potter. I am the
[35:00] clay. Mold me and make
[35:06] me. This is what I
[35:12] pray. Change my heart, oh God.

[35:59] [Music]

[36:08] God. Make it ever true.
[36:19] She was here the other day.
[36:21] So I be like
[36:25] you. Let's just stand and sing that
[36:28] again. Maybe just sing it as a a prayer,
[36:31] a
[36:32] praise.
[36:36] Certainly we know that it's the Lord
[36:39] that controls.
[36:41] Change the atmosphere of our
[36:44] hearts. Change my heart, oh
[36:52] Lord. Make it

[37:47] ever
[37:51] true. Change my heart, oh
[37:56] [Music]
[37:58] God. May I be like you. I trust that's
[38:04] our heart's desire this morning just to
[38:08] take on the very nature, the very spirit
[38:10] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[38:15] Amen. Just uh certainly desire for you
[38:18] to pray for the meetings there in South
[38:21] Africa. Uh just
[38:24] uh just desiring that the Lord would
[38:27] just come on the scene, speak to the
[38:30] hearts of the people.
[38:32] uh just had a lot of people reaching out
[38:37] uh desiring,
[38:39] expressing and uh I believe that uh
[38:43] God's on the scene. He's he's present.
[38:46] He knows exactly what we need. But he
[38:49] also desires it when we actually express
[38:52] our needs to him. When we actually would
[38:54] would reach out to him and say, "Lord, I
[38:57] I need you to touch me. I have this need
[39:00] in my life. And I want to see these
[39:03] things come to pass in my life. And you
[39:06] know, if we're mute, my brother and
[39:07] sister, you'll find that God will be
[39:09] mute back to you. He wants to hear his
[39:12] people. And when we ask, he will speak.
[39:15] Amen. Let's remember our brother
[39:18] Daniel is going to be speaking our uh
[39:21] next Sunday service, Easter service.
[39:24] Just lift brother Daniel up in prayer.
[39:26] to give traveling mercies for them also
[39:29] as they would come down and of course
[39:31] remember there is a potluck following
[39:34] the Easter service. Amen. So good to be
[39:37] in the house of the Lord today. Amen. We
[39:40] thank you. God bless our visitor. Good
[39:42] to see you back again. Amen. Let's turn
[39:45] in our Bibles uh Ephesians 3. Thank you
[39:48] musicians. Very beautiful music this
[39:51] morning. Appreciate that. Amen. I want
[39:54] to speak to you when the partial becomes
[39:58] perfect. And um as we'll look at this
[40:01] quite a few things, quotations, there'll
[40:04] be a little bit of reading, a little bit
[40:05] of expression this morning of that
[40:07] fashion. Uh but if you'd be patient with
[40:10] me this morning, uh there's certainly a
[40:14] lot on the plate, but uh by God's grace,
[40:16] we can stay focused and in that in that
[40:19] line. Ephesians the 3 chapter uh verse
[40:24] 10- 21 and
[40:27] uh just uh I want to say I appreciate
[40:30] each and every one of you and God bless
[40:33] you
[40:34] today. Ephesians 3:10 to the intent that
[40:38] now unto the principalities and powers
[40:40] in heavenly places might be known by the
[40:43] church the manifold wisdom of God. So an
[40:47] expression that the church would know
[40:50] the wisdom of God according to the
[40:53] eternal purpose which he purposed in
[40:55] Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have
[40:58] boldness and access with confidence by
[41:01] the faith of him. Wherefore I desire
[41:04] that you faint not at my tribulations
[41:06] for you which is your glory. For this
[41:09] cause I bow my knees unto the father of
[41:12] our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole
[41:14] family in heaven and earth is named,
[41:18] that he would grant you according to the
[41:20] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[41:23] with might by his spirit in the inner
[41:26] man. that Christ might dwell in your
[41:29] hearts by faith, that ye being rooted
[41:32] and grounded in love, may be able to
[41:35] comprehend with all saints what is the
[41:38] breadth and length and depth and height,
[41:41] and to know the love of Christ, which
[41:44] paths all with past knowledge, that you
[41:48] might be filled with all the fullness of
[41:51] God. Now unto him that is able to
[41:54] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[41:56] ask or think according to the power
[41:58] which workketh in us. Unto him be glory
[42:02] in the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[42:05] all ages, a world without end. Amen.
[42:09] Heavenly Father, we just ask Lord that
[42:11] you would just bless the reading of your
[42:13] word Lord and just guide these words.
[42:15] Let these words be your words today
[42:18] father. Bless each and everyone that is
[42:20] here, Lord, that they might be able to
[42:23] leave the house of God today, saying it
[42:25] was good to be in the house of God.
[42:28] Thank you, Lord. We love you and
[42:29] appreciate you. In your name, amen. You
[42:32] may be
[42:37] seated. As we look at this this morning,
[42:42] we just uh take a second. There's so
[42:44] much here, but I have so much on my
[42:46] plate uh that um I I hope I can get
[42:49] through it. But verse 10, to the intent
[42:52] that now unto the principalities and
[42:54] powers in heavenly places might be mo
[42:57] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[42:59] of God. And so we look at this and
[43:03] realize there is an expression in the
[43:05] word that is telling us there is much
[43:07] more than what we have now. More than we
[43:10] h have had in the past even at this
[43:13] moment there is much more for us to
[43:16] have. And so he's wanting to bring this
[43:19] not to bring it as the wisdom of man. My
[43:22] brother and sister through the ages
[43:23] we'll find that the the very nature of
[43:26] man coming in each age they come there
[43:29] was something fresh but ultimately it's
[43:32] the very nature of man to build it
[43:34] around the church they they bring the
[43:36] church as the answer but it is actually
[43:40] the wisdom of God Christ Jesus himself
[43:42] the Holy Spirit moving in our midst is
[43:45] our answer it's not the building it's
[43:47] not the doctrine it's not it's not our
[43:50] our thoughts as humans, but it is the
[43:53] wisdom of God. And so this expression
[43:56] that there is more for us, I believe we
[43:58] would understand the deep calling unto
[44:01] the deep. If there's something to call,
[44:03] there's something to respond. And and we
[44:06] recognize that today. And this wisdom of
[44:09] God is this manyfold. The manifold is
[44:12] really, you could take it into a longer
[44:14] version of words and say this manyfold
[44:17] wisdom of God. In other words, there's
[44:19] many aspects to it and there's many
[44:22] angles that God is is got uh to share
[44:25] with us to raise us up into his wisdom.
[44:29] It it comes from even natural life. You
[44:31] know, I remember a story many years ago
[44:34] that a man in in Kansas that was very
[44:37] wealthy and um he he uh uh in the town
[44:41] that he lived in, he gave uh just
[44:44] exceeding amounts of money uh to every
[44:47] church in town. And finally one day
[44:49] someone asked him, you know, hey, you're
[44:52] always giving money to the church uh
[44:55] churches, but but you yourself don't go
[44:57] to church. And he said, you know, uh, I
[45:00] I want you to understand I believe in
[45:03] God. I believe God is real. And, uh,
[45:05] what I'm looking at when I give or share
[45:08] to these churches is I'm looking at the
[45:10] principle that's in God's word. I'm
[45:12] looking at it. And he said that if you
[45:14] rob God that you'll have holes in your
[45:17] pocket, but if you are faithful to God,
[45:19] he will bless you. And he said, I have
[45:21] proven that in my life, all the years of
[45:25] my life, and I give and God blesses me.
[45:28] Now my brother and sister, the greatest
[45:30] gift that God has given to you and I is
[45:32] salvation himself. So we don't want to
[45:35] just take this as a business principle
[45:38] that we can apply and that God will
[45:40] honor. But even in a case like that, God
[45:42] would honor a man who would honor God's
[45:44] word. So if we are here today h and we
[45:48] are from the depths of our heart serving
[45:50] God just just not to have a a better
[45:53] life uh to become a wealthy man or
[45:55] something of that nature but truly to
[45:58] serve him from our heart and he's still
[46:01] pouring out his wisdom upon us. He's
[46:03] showing us who he is. And my brother and
[46:06] sister this is the the blessing that
[46:10] comes from the word of God. And you know
[46:12] verse 16 says that he would grant you
[46:15] according to the riches of his glory to
[46:17] be strengthened with might by the spirit
[46:19] in the inner man. Now we can choose to
[46:22] be strengthened in the outer man. I just
[46:24] here recently uh uh saw some deal. I
[46:28] forget the title now. It just kind of an
[46:30] afterthought. Uh you know it was fitness
[46:32] buffs for Christ or something like that.
[46:35] And these guys have great big muscles
[46:37] and they're they're they're doing this
[46:39] for the glory of God. But my brother and
[46:41] sister, I don't think that's what God
[46:43] intended as to justify becoming
[46:46] bodybuilders and being fit and all of
[46:48] this, you know, to give glory to God. We
[46:51] give glory to God from the inner man.
[46:53] Amen. It's the inner man that is lifting
[46:55] up the word and and he is strengthening
[46:58] us in the spirit by in the inner man.
[47:01] Amen. By the spirit in the inner man.
[47:03] And so we're being strengthened by the
[47:06] word. Really, it's what God is doing.
[47:09] He's strengthening us by the word. And
[47:12] uh you know, there's just no way around
[47:13] it. It's the word of God that makes the
[47:15] impact on our life. You can go to church
[47:18] all the days of your life, go to hell.
[47:20] You can you can read your Bible every
[47:22] day, go to hell. It's the strength of
[47:25] God in the inner man, the presence of
[47:28] Jesus Christ on the inner man. And you
[47:30] see, it's revelation that's pouring out
[47:32] of the word. Now my brother and sister,
[47:34] you have to look at the the reflection
[47:37] of what revelation is uh in a correct
[47:40] fashion. You can have something revealed
[47:42] to you uh and say, "Oh, that's
[47:45] revelation." But you see, the revelation
[47:48] of Jesus Christ is a revealing of
[47:51] himself. Not a bunch of facts, not a
[47:54] bunch of history, not a bunch of uh
[47:56] things. It's Christ himself revealed to
[47:59] us. And if he's revealing himself to us,
[48:03] then we have to be able to see him. We
[48:06] have to pay attention and and give our
[48:08] focus as it is to what he's revealing to
[48:12] us. And so I just uh maybe take a halt
[48:15] of that and we'll we'll uh touch on that
[48:18] again in a little bit in the seventh
[48:21] week of Daniel. We'll see now at these
[48:23] last days when God's going to reveal
[48:25] these secrets to the church. So we're in
[48:28] the last days. We're in the time God's
[48:30] chosen to open his word and give secrets
[48:33] to the church. Amen. He hasn't done it
[48:37] before. And the reason he hasn't done it
[48:39] is to keep the church watching and
[48:41] praying all the time, not knowing when
[48:44] it was coming. Imagine, my brother and
[48:46] sister, if we knew exactly when the Lord
[48:49] was coming. If we knew that it was on
[48:51] Easter Sunday, uh, and we knew it would
[48:54] be mankind, the very nature of man, we
[48:57] would just be worried about that the day
[48:59] before Sunday, we we wouldn't live our
[49:02] life in that expectation. We'd say, you
[49:04] know, I've got time. I can, you know, I
[49:06] I'll make sure that I I fast and pray on
[49:09] Saturday and when the rapture comes on
[49:11] Sunday, I'll be ready. But that's not
[49:13] how it works. God wants his bride. He
[49:16] wants his church to have herself
[49:18] prepared every single day. Amen.
[49:21] Consecrated to him, focused on him. My
[49:25] brother and sister, it's just like in
[49:26] the youth banquet here, we had had a
[49:28] young man had a question about the
[49:30] Sabbath. And you know, you look at that,
[49:32] we realize if we're not careful, we we
[49:35] serve God by the day. We look at that of
[49:38] the traditions of days, weeks, months,
[49:40] and years. And and so we focus that this
[49:43] is a day that I worship. But the word of
[49:45] God shows us very clearly that every day
[49:48] is a Sabbath. Every day is our day to
[49:50] worship God. Every day is our day to
[49:53] live for him. Not just a day of the
[49:56] week, but every day. And so we look at
[49:59] this the time not knowing when it's
[50:01] coming. But you remember in Daniel 12,
[50:03] he says, "The wise shall understand in
[50:06] the last in the last day." See, it's
[50:09] been given to him. The spirit of wisdom
[50:12] comes into the church to make known to
[50:14] the church by the revelation of the Holy
[50:17] Ghost, bringing the church in and
[50:19] revealing what day that we're living in.
[50:22] Now, my brother and sister, I I'm going
[50:25] to speak just a tad bit political here
[50:27] if you don't mind for just a moment. Uh,
[50:29] another denomination has now their
[50:31] council general leadership has uh,
[50:34] pronounced that um, anyone who does not
[50:37] accept the current uh, gender uh,
[50:40] movement uh, is really not welcome and
[50:42] they're actually firing or or dismissing
[50:46] pastors that uh, stand against that.
[50:48] They're saying we don't need you. This
[50:50] is what we accept. We're standing on
[50:53] this. Now, that is directly opposed to
[50:56] the word of God. But you see, the church
[50:59] is not now worried about the word of
[51:02] God. They're worried about the church.
[51:04] They're worried about if we do this.
[51:06] Now, this same denomination has lost
[51:09] over 1 million members in the last few
[51:12] years because of this argument over this
[51:15] gender identity stuff. My brother and
[51:17] sister, now the church is taking a stand
[51:20] because they don't want to lose more
[51:22] members. But it's not lose more members
[51:25] cuz you know they're going to lose
[51:26] members cuz not everyone is on that
[51:29] side. They're choosing what members they
[51:31] want to have. And so it's not there my
[51:35] brother and sister Grace Tabernacle here
[51:37] this morning. We would say well aren't
[51:39] we choosing what members we want? Well I
[51:42] want this to be what does the choosing?
[51:45] Not us. Not what we stand for. Not what
[51:47] we promote but what the word of God said
[51:50] is truth. Let that be what gives us our
[51:54] members. Amen. Let that be what
[51:56] determines where we stand in the day
[51:59] that we live in. And so here taking
[52:01] this, it comes to make it known to the
[52:04] church by revelation of the Holy Ghost
[52:06] bringing the church in and revealing
[52:08] what day we're living in. My brother and
[52:11] sister, when I look at the day that
[52:13] we're living in, it tells me it's the
[52:16] last days. It's the last of time. It's
[52:19] the the culmination of everything that
[52:21] would come. It's it's right there. It's
[52:23] very clear in the scripture. It's just a
[52:26] matter of whether we hold value to it
[52:28] and whether we'll choose to live by it.
[52:30] Amen. Just the same as Gabriel come to
[52:33] Daniel. The Holy Spirit comes to the
[52:35] church in the last days to reveal these
[52:37] great deep secret things. Do you
[52:40] understand now? Now, as you look at
[52:42] this, my brother and sister, what God is
[52:44] doing, he's called the bride, right? We
[52:46] recognize that out of the scripture very
[52:49] very clear. He's got a called out people
[52:51] in the last days. So as we come the
[52:54] calledout people are going to be there.
[52:56] Now is it by my wisdom or is it by your
[52:59] wisdom? Is it by our great
[53:01] understanding? No. It's God's gift to
[53:04] you and I that he's showing us. He's the
[53:07] Holy Spirit coming moving upon us to
[53:09] show us where we stand in this hour.
[53:12] Now, my brother and sister, if we can
[53:15] take the intellectual, which I'm not
[53:17] totally opposed to the intellectual,
[53:19] that's good. Break it down. Know with
[53:21] the Greek, the Hebrew, the Aramaic, all
[53:23] of those things. There's nothing wrong
[53:24] with that. But if there's no spirit in
[53:27] there, you just have knowledge. You have
[53:29] nothing that is of great value other
[53:32] than you can tout that to those around
[53:34] you. My brother and sister, we can also
[53:36] be uh uh so spiritual that we can't
[53:39] hardly live life day by day because
[53:43] everything has such a huge spiritual
[53:46] significance that everything is going on
[53:49] and it's really more what it is as our
[53:52] brother Rap spoke at the youth banquet a
[53:54] red herring. We get so spiritual that
[53:57] you know somebody does something a
[53:59] little something happens and and you
[54:01] know oh my look at this my brother and
[54:04] sister how about we just get steadied by
[54:06] the presence of the Holy Ghost in our
[54:08] lives. Get steady to look at the word
[54:10] and say I know the hour I'm living in
[54:14] and I know that the bridegroom is
[54:16] coming. Therefore, I know I must have
[54:19] oil in my lamp. And I know that the word
[54:23] has given the direction on how to put
[54:26] oil in my lamp. Amen. It's not going to
[54:29] be just some little, oh, I believe. The
[54:32] devil
[54:34] believes. It won't be just how much you
[54:36] can
[54:37] quote. The intellect can quote. Those
[54:40] with great memories can quote. But my
[54:42] brother and sister, it's revelation down
[54:44] into the heart and soul of a son or
[54:46] daughter of God that recognizes this is
[54:48] the hour of my preparation. This is the
[54:51] hour that God is giving me this time to
[54:54] be prepared for this that I won't have
[54:57] to be one of those that is saying give
[54:58] me of oil. I need your oil, but I be one
[55:02] that can stand on the word in that day.
[55:04] Is that your heart's desire? Amen. 1
[55:06] Corinthians 13 and 9 going to verse 12.
[55:11] For we know in
[55:13] part and we prophesy in
[55:16] part. Now think about the title. When
[55:19] the partial becomes perfect. See, so we
[55:22] know in part and we prophesy in part.
[55:25] But when that which is perfect is come,
[55:28] then that which is in part shall be done
[55:30] away. When I was a child, I spake as a
[55:33] child. I understood as a child. I
[55:35] thought as a child. But when I became a
[55:38] man, I put away childless things. For
[55:41] now we see through a glass darkly, but
[55:43] then face to face. Now I know in part,
[55:46] but then shall I know even also I I am
[55:50] known. Amen. So look at this. God is
[55:53] bringing us here. We are today. Now, as
[55:55] long as we're in this flesh, we're going
[55:58] to be in that partial realization. We're
[56:00] going to be in a partial understanding.
[56:02] In other words, my brother and sister,
[56:05] we say, "Well, the love of Christ, do we
[56:07] know it that love in its fullness?" I
[56:10] don't believe we'll fully understand the
[56:12] love of Christ, the grace of God, until
[56:15] we are on the other side. When we're
[56:16] standing there in the sea of crystal
[56:18] before the throne, we won't really fully
[56:21] understand what it is. We have our
[56:24] comprehension of what love is. We have
[56:26] our comprehension of what grace is, what
[56:30] mercy is, but we don't have a fullness
[56:33] of that. And when we come and we'll look
[56:35] at this in this scripture here, see, we
[56:38] know in part and we prophesy in part. In
[56:41] other words, what we understand in this
[56:44] human element, we speak of. We talk of
[56:47] the good things that God has done for
[56:48] us. We can talk about how that the word
[56:51] has been opened to us and we see more
[56:54] than we saw last week, last year, the
[56:57] last decade. We're moving closer into
[57:00] this atmosphere, but we're still dealing
[57:02] from a human element. So, we are still
[57:06] just in part and we could only prophesy
[57:09] in part, but that which is perfect is
[57:12] come. Now, my brother and sister, we
[57:14] could look at this and say, "Well, I
[57:16] believe we have a perfect word. I
[57:18] believe we have a perfect word. Amen.
[57:20] But it is there. That word is being
[57:22] manifest. It's drawing you and I deeper
[57:26] into the presence, deeper into the word
[57:29] of God, the life of Christ, the nature
[57:31] of Christ. We're being drawn into that.
[57:33] Can you acknowledge that you're closer
[57:36] to him today than you was last year? I I
[57:39] hope that is something each and everyone
[57:41] would say, "Yes, I know that I am closer
[57:44] to my Lord Jesus than I was a year ago."
[57:47] uh even hopefully a few weeks ago and
[57:50] it's there. What we're doing, we're
[57:52] changing. We're being drawn into his
[57:54] presence and we are changing. But you
[57:57] see, the perfect is coming and that
[58:01] partial
[58:02] realization is fading away as we're
[58:05] drawn into the perfect element of who we
[58:07] truly are. Now, we look at that and we
[58:10] acknowledge that uh you know, it's by
[58:12] revelation. You can say, "I'm a
[58:14] Christian," and have no idea who you
[58:17] really are. Yeah. Does that make sense
[58:19] to you? You can say, "I'm a Christian,"
[58:22] and not even understand what you are
[58:25] saying. But as your experience deepens,
[58:28] as you are drawn closer to the Lord, you
[58:31] start to realize just truly who I am. I
[58:34] am not, my brother and sister, just a
[58:36] man who one day decided I couldn't live
[58:39] without the Lord and that I'm going to
[58:41] go find the Lord. The word says that no
[58:43] man's ever sought God. It was always God
[58:46] seeking man. And and so we didn't come
[58:48] and decide we wanted to get closer to
[58:50] God. It's God reaching out, getting a
[58:52] hold of us, drawing us into his
[58:55] presence. And as he pulls us into his
[58:57] presence, our realization is changing.
[59:00] If it's not changing, we need to stop
[59:02] and get get serious about something. But
[59:04] our realization of who we really are, we
[59:07] can say, "Well, I'm a Christian. What
[59:09] does that mean, my brother and sister? I
[59:13] believe in Jesus Christ. Lucifer
[59:15] believes in Jesus Christ. Does that make
[59:17] him a Christian? No, it doesn't. Amen.
[59:20] So, you look at this as this perfect is
[59:23] starting to come out. It's showing in
[59:25] verse 11, how we was when we were a
[59:27] child was how we talked. Amen. As how we
[59:32] understood, is how we thought. But as we
[59:36] are becoming adults, put it that way,
[59:40] becoming a a man, I put away the
[59:43] childish things. So now, while we look
[59:46] through the glass
[59:48] darkly, we have our
[59:52] idea. I use my daughter Jolyn's car. You
[59:55] know, I drove it some time back. She has
[59:56] a lovely little car. The windows are so
[59:59] dark. It's night at day. And so, you
[1:00:03] know, I was driving her car at night
[1:00:04] here a while back and and it's her car.
[1:00:07] I don't want to put a ding in my
[1:00:08] daughter's car. So, I'm turning in an
[1:00:11] intersection that had a center island
[1:00:12] that come quite a ways out there. I
[1:00:14] rolled the window down and I probably
[1:00:16] look silly in the dark, a grown man
[1:00:18] sticking my head out the window to make
[1:00:21] sure that I turned into the right place.
[1:00:23] But you see, my point being is we look
[1:00:26] at God through this glass darkly. We're
[1:00:30] not entirely certain what we're seeing.
[1:00:35] Yeah. Are you with me? Yeah. Not
[1:00:39] entirely certain what we see. And when
[1:00:42] you look through that glass at your own
[1:00:45] relationship with the Lord, we can look
[1:00:48] at that. My, you know, I always ask you
[1:00:50] guys this question, and I don't mean to
[1:00:52] be so redundant, but did anybody make a
[1:00:54] mistake this last week? Did anyone have,
[1:00:56] you know, a little attitude or say words
[1:00:59] they wish they hadn't said or thoughts
[1:01:01] they wish they hadn't thought? Amen. I
[1:01:04] I'll lift my hand for you. Amen. So,
[1:01:06] it's there, my brother and sister. If
[1:01:08] you are looking through a glass darkly
[1:01:10] at yourself as a Christian, you'd say,
[1:01:13] "What is missing in my life?" But the
[1:01:16] reality of it is is God is pulling you
[1:01:18] from a partial realization of who you
[1:01:22] are into a full manifestation or full
[1:01:27] perfect re uh realization of who you
[1:01:30] are. Because you see, it's not about
[1:01:31] what you've done. It's what he did for
[1:01:34] you. There is a closer vision of the
[1:01:37] realization of who we are as Christians.
[1:01:40] It's not about what I can attain to.
[1:01:42] It's not about what I can do or what I
[1:01:45] have done or what my plans are for the
[1:01:47] future. The whole thing centers and we
[1:01:51] look through this glass darkly. We don't
[1:01:53] really see the true grace of God that
[1:01:56] before a foundation of the world as the
[1:01:58] scripture says he claimed us. He put
[1:02:01] your name in the lamb's book of life.
[1:02:03] And that had nothing to do whether
[1:02:05] you're a good person or a bad person.
[1:02:07] But what he knew was in you that he
[1:02:10] placed there and that he would bring to
[1:02:12] manifestation. And we can get
[1:02:14] discouraged. We can get depressed. We
[1:02:16] can get all of these things about how it
[1:02:19] seems like we just struggle so hard. But
[1:02:21] the perfect realization of it is it's
[1:02:24] all in Jesus Christ. It was never in us
[1:02:27] in the beginning. And when we surrender,
[1:02:30] our job is to surrender to his perfect
[1:02:33] will. And when we surrender, we'll find
[1:02:36] that the clear the picture is starting
[1:02:38] to come clear or it's starting to come
[1:02:41] that we were here that God said, I'm
[1:02:43] going to bring you as a living witness.
[1:02:47] You see, every work that God has done
[1:02:49] through the ages. You can find it in
[1:02:51] scripture. Every work that he has done
[1:02:54] has witnesses. There's nothing takes
[1:02:56] place without a witness. And we are here
[1:02:59] in the day that we live in this 21st
[1:03:02] century. And God has witnesses once
[1:03:04] again on the earth. Do you know any of
[1:03:06] them? Amen. Do you look in the mirror in
[1:03:09] the morning and say, "I I'm a witness of
[1:03:11] Jesus Christ. I will be the witness
[1:03:14] today. I will be a faithful witness."
[1:03:17] Amen. If you are not a faithful witness,
[1:03:19] you're a
[1:03:20] perger. Amen. It's just that simple. So,
[1:03:23] we have to be a faithful witness. So, we
[1:03:26] see a transition in the Christian
[1:03:28] experience. We don't just get up one day
[1:03:31] and we're suddenly perfect when somehow
[1:03:35] does we just always make the right
[1:03:36] decisions. We always say the right
[1:03:38] thing. We always think the right thing.
[1:03:40] My brother and sister, this is a
[1:03:41] transition that's taking place and the
[1:03:44] glass is getting less dark for us
[1:03:46] because we're getting closer to the
[1:03:47] light. We're getting closer to the one
[1:03:50] who is the whole word, the revealed word
[1:03:53] of the hour. And so this transition of
[1:03:55] the Christian experience, Amen. It's a
[1:03:59] transition of earthbound people. We're
[1:04:01] here today. We are in the flesh. Amen.
[1:04:05] Do any of you can any of you acknowledge
[1:04:07] you're just flesh people? Amen. They
[1:04:11] might be able to send somebody to the
[1:04:12] moon in a rocket, my brother and sister,
[1:04:14] but remove him from the rocket and he's
[1:04:17] an earthbound person. So, it's there
[1:04:20] that we are here. We talk about heavenly
[1:04:22] places, but in this flesh, I'm talking
[1:04:24] about in the carnal realm, in this
[1:04:26] flesh, we are an earthbound people. So,
[1:04:30] the transition is of earthbound people
[1:04:33] climbing upwards into heavenly places.
[1:04:37] Now, God's not going to just put you on
[1:04:39] the elevator and push the top floor.
[1:04:42] Amen. You're going to have to labor this
[1:04:44] to manifest or uh uh uh live out the
[1:04:48] word that has been revealed to you. As
[1:04:50] the glass is getting less dark, God is
[1:04:52] requiring more of you. You see, we don't
[1:04:55] come to this place that God requires the
[1:04:57] same amount out of us a as mature,
[1:05:01] experienced uh believers. Uh God doesn't
[1:05:04] say, "Look, I I'm going to just let you
[1:05:07] act like you was when you was first
[1:05:09] converted, act like this and act like
[1:05:11] that." No, he's asking more. He's
[1:05:13] requiring more out of us. But remember
[1:05:16] that requirements, not
[1:05:19] works. You guys are quiet this
[1:05:23] morning.
[1:05:26] Amen. You see, the only thing that's
[1:05:29] going to get you in heavenly places is
[1:05:30] the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:32] Amen. There's nothing else going to put
[1:05:34] you there. No amount of church
[1:05:36] attendance, no amount of
[1:05:39] giving, nothing will put you there. That
[1:05:42] man in Kansas, that rich man, the
[1:05:44] story's old enough, that man will have
[1:05:46] passed from this life by this
[1:05:50] time. If he didn't have a personal
[1:05:52] relationship with Jesus Christ, his
[1:05:55] money he gave didn't get him there.
[1:05:59] So none of that matters. perfect
[1:06:01] attendance. It doesn't matter how much
[1:06:04] you give, whatever you do. None of that
[1:06:06] matters without that personal
[1:06:08] relationship. And you say, "Brother
[1:06:09] Paul, we know that." Well, my brother
[1:06:11] and sister, this fullness of this person
[1:06:13] personal relationship is the full res uh
[1:06:17] realization of who we are. And when we
[1:06:20] come into that full realization of who
[1:06:22] we are, a rapture is the next thing you
[1:06:25] will see. Amen. We're not going to walk
[1:06:28] on this earth as these educated,
[1:06:30] enlightened Christians. Amen. God's
[1:06:33] bringing us into maturity. And in that
[1:06:36] maturity, he calls us home. Amen. I was
[1:06:39] just talking to Sister Jerry. It's been
[1:06:40] on my mind a lot lately. Uh you know, uh
[1:06:44] the the services that uh you know, I've
[1:06:47] made comment about this. you know, we're
[1:06:49] in Israel and um you know, I'm I'm
[1:06:52] sitting here looking at the temple and
[1:06:55] and uh you know, the weeping wall and
[1:06:57] all of these things and I'm sorry,
[1:07:00] doesn't sound very spiritual. I'm
[1:07:02] thinking, man, how did they build this?
[1:07:04] They had no cranes. They had nothing.
[1:07:06] You know, how' they do this? Amen.
[1:07:09] Brother Trevor, Sister Carrie were
[1:07:10] there. Incredible. But brother Gideon's
[1:07:12] got his head against the wall and he's
[1:07:14] thinking about ground zero and he's
[1:07:16] thinking about the eagle and the wind
[1:07:18] under his wings and he goes home and
[1:07:21] preaches these
[1:07:22] things. And you go back now and look at
[1:07:25] that he was preaching his own perfect
[1:07:31] realization and when he come to that
[1:07:33] place God took him home.
[1:07:36] You see, my brother and sister, it
[1:07:38] doesn't have to happen as a
[1:07:41] rapture. As we come in maturity, a
[1:07:44] perfect realization of who we are. God
[1:07:49] takes us
[1:07:50] home. You see what's going on around us,
[1:07:53] my brother and sister. We have so many
[1:07:56] herrings in our
[1:07:57] life. We're not focused like we should
[1:08:01] be.
[1:08:02] We're we're not as concerned as we
[1:08:04] really ought to be about the time that
[1:08:07] we're actually living in because we have
[1:08:10] so many red
[1:08:12] herrings. We're so focused on these kind
[1:08:15] of
[1:08:16] things that Satan is just there letting
[1:08:19] our own
[1:08:20] distraction keep us from coming to a
[1:08:23] perfect
[1:08:24] realization. We're still living in the
[1:08:26] partial. And I'm sorry to say it. I hope
[1:08:29] this isn't too blunt. We're happy to be
[1:08:32] living in a partial
[1:08:34] realization. If we're not careful, we'll
[1:08:38] say, "Well, we've got the message that
[1:08:40] makes us in a better position than many,
[1:08:42] many people." My brother and sister,
[1:08:45] God's not comparing you to those people.
[1:08:49] God's comparing you to his word. His
[1:08:52] word is what we are in the balance with,
[1:08:55] not the rest of humanity and what they
[1:08:57] believe or how sincere they are. Because
[1:08:59] I can assure you that there's a lot of
[1:09:01] people out there that are much more
[1:09:03] sincere than you are, but do not have
[1:09:06] the revealed word of the hour. They do
[1:09:08] not have the fullness of the gospel, but
[1:09:11] they have ze they're zealous. They they
[1:09:14] would qualify as zealots, my brother and
[1:09:16] sister, but they don't have the truth.
[1:09:18] And we have truth and we have
[1:09:22] distractions. Oh, Satan's a clever
[1:09:24] fellow, isn't he? Because it doesn't
[1:09:26] matter how zealous you are if you don't
[1:09:28] have
[1:09:29] truth. And it don't matter if you have
[1:09:32] truth if you're not
[1:09:35] focused and not zealous towards the word
[1:09:38] of
[1:09:42] God. But you
[1:09:44] see, lest I would sound like I'm
[1:09:48] speaking down to
[1:09:49] you. Slowly but steadily, God's opening
[1:09:53] our eyes. Slowly but steadily, God's
[1:09:55] changing our focus and and who we are
[1:09:58] and why we're here. We're walking on a
[1:10:00] journey. Amen. This is this is not just
[1:10:03] a step from one place, a giant leap of
[1:10:06] faith into another place. God wants you
[1:10:09] to walk. We'll be speaking on this
[1:10:11] probably in South Africa. But you look
[1:10:13] at the story of the road to Emmas, my
[1:10:16] brother and sister. Here were some
[1:10:18] people. I don't want to give too much
[1:10:19] away, but here's the people. Here's
[1:10:22] these men. They're walking down the road
[1:10:24] to Emmas and they're talking about
[1:10:26] everything that went
[1:10:28] wrong. Jesus was supposed to He was
[1:10:30] going to be our deliverer. He was going
[1:10:32] to be our savior. He was going to be all
[1:10:34] these things. We thought he was going to
[1:10:36] deliver us from the Romans. He he was
[1:10:39] going to take care of all this stuff. He
[1:10:41] was going to be a mighty general. And
[1:10:42] then he's gone. He's crucified. He's
[1:10:45] gone. And and they had this and the
[1:10:47] atmosphere around it. When Jesus steps
[1:10:49] out and starts to walk with him, he asks
[1:10:52] him, "What manner of conversation are
[1:10:55] you having right now and are
[1:10:59] sad?" I want to
[1:11:01] know speaking to Paul also, is our
[1:11:05] manner of conversation making us happy
[1:11:07] or
[1:11:08] sad? Is it bringing forth a a zeal or
[1:11:11] excitement in our life that that we are
[1:11:14] realizing, you know what, I I want to I
[1:11:17] want to come closer to the Lord. I want
[1:11:19] to live this word. I am this word. I'm
[1:11:22] going to be this word. And I don't care
[1:11:24] about whether I stumbled over this stone
[1:11:26] on the road of the journey to Emmas. It
[1:11:29] doesn't matter if I stumbled. It don't
[1:11:31] matter how dirty my feet are. It doesn't
[1:11:33] matter if I sweated today. It doesn't
[1:11:36] matter all the concerns of the politics
[1:11:38] and whether the Romans are getting
[1:11:39] stronger or getting weaker. I know that
[1:11:42] my redeemer liveth and the word has come
[1:11:45] to deliver me. You see, it's going to
[1:11:47] matter, my brother and sister, because
[1:11:49] partial realization puts politics into
[1:11:52] what we believe or where we believe
[1:11:54] we're at. It puts all kinds of things
[1:11:56] into that. It puts social levels and it
[1:11:59] puts racisms and all of these things
[1:12:02] impacting our thing. But when it comes
[1:12:04] down, as we get closer to a perfect
[1:12:06] realization of who we are and what God
[1:12:08] called us for, none of that matters.
[1:12:11] What matters is our relationship with
[1:12:13] the Lord Jesus Christ. Do we have oil in
[1:12:16] our lamp this morning? Or are we sitting
[1:12:18] here saying, "I'm just fine. I'll get it
[1:12:20] later." My brother and sister, it
[1:12:22] shouldn't be, "As long as I got a little
[1:12:25] oil, I'll be okay." We should be
[1:12:28] desiring for that to be filled up. It
[1:12:31] should be a place where we want the
[1:12:32] perfect realization. It's going to take
[1:12:35] oil in our lamp to get out of here.
[1:12:38] Not just God sent a prophet. Not just we
[1:12:41] see this. Not just we see that. My
[1:12:44] brother and sister, it takes oil in the
[1:12:47] lamp and nothing else. Amen. It doesn't
[1:12:51] matter where we went, who we knew, how
[1:12:53] long we've believed it. None of that
[1:12:55] matters. It's whether there's oil in
[1:12:58] that lamp. Amen. And I'm sorry, getting
[1:13:01] too strident here. Amen. But I believe
[1:13:04] we're slowly but steadily gaining
[1:13:06] realization of who we truly are. Now, my
[1:13:10] brother and sister, sorry to be this
[1:13:12] blunt, but it is the verbal or
[1:13:15] intellectual position of a message
[1:13:20] believer. What does that
[1:13:24] mean? Recently, I come across a deal. I
[1:13:27] won't go into it, but a man is bantering
[1:13:30] on one side of it what's wrong with
[1:13:31] everyone else, which he would include
[1:13:33] you in the side that's messed
[1:13:37] up. And he's using a quote to prove
[1:13:41] it. Does that make it
[1:13:44] so? No,
[1:13:47] not at all. For one, he's using the
[1:13:50] quote out of
[1:13:52] context, but obviously he uses it over
[1:13:55] and over again. So, it's a favorite
[1:13:56] quote of
[1:13:57] his. But my brother and sister, see, it
[1:14:00] doesn't matter how many quotes he can
[1:14:02] quote trying to show that you're
[1:14:04] wrong. That has nothing to do with your
[1:14:09] realization. His realization is based on
[1:14:14] quotes. Our realization should be based
[1:14:17] on relationship. Amen. Our realization
[1:14:21] should be a position that we know who we
[1:14:25] are in Jesus Christ. Not that we can
[1:14:28] banter this was said or this was said,
[1:14:31] but what we have is the word. And the
[1:14:35] word is what's in our lamp. Amen. And
[1:14:38] that is what's changing our life. Amen.
[1:14:45] Now hopefully I'm not speaking too
[1:14:47] direct. Is are we doing okay?
[1:14:50] Amen. Now in fellowship the blood was
[1:14:53] bathing the ground from the innocent
[1:14:56] Abel plum on till to that time through
[1:15:00] the lamb after lamb after lamb and
[1:15:03] hepher after heer after hepher. But now
[1:15:06] the word was being made manifest. The
[1:15:08] word was going to become spirit. The
[1:15:10] word was going to be dwelling among us.
[1:15:13] We believe that, right? That's what the
[1:15:14] word says. I'll be with you. Amen. The
[1:15:17] word's going to be in
[1:15:20] us. I'll be with you even in you. You
[1:15:25] know, my brother and sister, when we
[1:15:27] take that scripture for its absolute
[1:15:31] value, we will never question what is
[1:15:35] happening in our life ever again.
[1:15:40] How could the Lord forsake me to go
[1:15:41] through this lonely time of my life? How
[1:15:44] could the Lord forsake me to go through
[1:15:46] these fiery trials? How could the Lord
[1:15:48] forsake me? No, my brother and sister,
[1:15:49] he's never forsaken anyone. He is with
[1:15:52] us, even in us. And you know that day,
[1:15:56] I've shared it here at the church. That
[1:15:58] day at white throne judgment, there's
[1:16:00] going to be a witness.
[1:16:02] Everyone that comes with an excuse of
[1:16:04] why they did not serve God. God's got to
[1:16:06] have a witness on the other side. Oh,
[1:16:09] poverty is why you couldn't serve God.
[1:16:12] He's got somebody over here who came out
[1:16:14] of poverty serve God. Oh, I had sickness
[1:16:17] in my flesh. I couldn't serve God. He's
[1:16:20] got someone who has suffered. We'd say,
[1:16:22] Lord, why are you letting this person
[1:16:24] suffer like this when you could heal
[1:16:26] them? Is because God always has a
[1:16:28] witness. And so think about it not as,
[1:16:31] "Oh, poor me. I'm a witness and this is
[1:16:34] what it is." My brother and sister, say,
[1:16:36] "Thank you, Lord, that the Lord saw me
[1:16:39] fit to be a witness." Amen. In that
[1:16:41] white throne judgment, they're going to
[1:16:42] come and offer every excuse under the
[1:16:45] sun why they couldn't. And God's got
[1:16:47] someone to offer every reason why they
[1:16:50] could. Oh, I want to be a true witness
[1:16:53] to God. Whatever position he calls me
[1:16:55] to, I want to be that witness. I don't
[1:16:58] want to be the one over here with the
[1:17:00] excuse
[1:17:02] cuz you can be assured that God's got a
[1:17:04] witness to counter every excuse. Cuz
[1:17:07] imagine God has no witness to counter
[1:17:09] the excuse. And they'd come and say, "It
[1:17:12] was because of this and this in my life
[1:17:14] I could not serve you." And God would be
[1:17:16] there saying, "I never thought of that
[1:17:18] one." Could he judge him for that? No,
[1:17:21] he
[1:17:23] couldn't. And no one is going to go
[1:17:27] stand in his presence in the glory of
[1:17:30] God without having passed through the
[1:17:33] test, the hall of critics before the
[1:17:37] hall of fame. And everyone goes through
[1:17:40] the fiery trial. So you see what God's
[1:17:43] doing? He's bringing our awareness. He's
[1:17:45] bringing the realization of who we
[1:17:48] really are. I was just reading here
[1:17:51] recently and it made me think of the
[1:17:52] story there and and
[1:17:55] uh Fox's book of martyrs uh and u you
[1:18:00] know in there how many of you read
[1:18:03] that? I I would encourage every one of
[1:18:05] you. It's it's tough reading. It really
[1:18:08] is tough
[1:18:10] reading. But here's a soldier guarding
[1:18:12] these saints and they herded them out.
[1:18:14] Took all their clothes from them. And
[1:18:17] you know the reason that they do that in
[1:18:19] many cases is humiliation brings
[1:18:22] subjection. So they strip all their
[1:18:24] clothes from them and they herd them out
[1:18:26] on a frozen lake and they're going to
[1:18:28] leave them there until they freeze to
[1:18:30] death. That was their lovely idea of
[1:18:32] proving that God was real. After all,
[1:18:35] they're defending the faith against
[1:18:38] heretics without understanding that the
[1:18:41] word says it would worship in the way
[1:18:43] that's called heresy. So, we're going to
[1:18:45] punish them as heretics when the word
[1:18:49] said they would worship as that. And
[1:18:52] that story there is interesting because
[1:18:55] here's a soldier. He's guarding them and
[1:18:58] he sees these people and they're driven,
[1:19:01] men, women, children out on the ice and
[1:19:04] something smoked him in the heart and
[1:19:06] says, "Someone has to believe to do
[1:19:10] that. Someone has to really truly
[1:19:12] believe." And there was something inside
[1:19:14] of him. And he starts to take his armor
[1:19:17] and his cloak and all of this off. And
[1:19:19] they said, "What are you doing?" And he
[1:19:20] says, "I'm going to join them." The
[1:19:22] minute, one minute he's in fellowship as
[1:19:25] a Roman soldier. Another he is
[1:19:27] completely rejected and pushed into the
[1:19:31] same position as the
[1:19:33] heretics. See how fickle Satan is? You
[1:19:36] serve him, he loves you. But one minute
[1:19:39] you stand up and say, "Wait, that's not
[1:19:41] the truth. He hates you. Yeah. But a man
[1:19:46] who no doubt we don't know any
[1:19:49] backstory, probably wasn't faithful in
[1:19:51] church, didn't have a lot of reading,
[1:19:52] didn't do what he did is he saw you. He
[1:19:56] saw people just like you and saw your
[1:19:59] stand for Jesus Christ and something
[1:20:02] struck his heart and said, "That's true.
[1:20:05] That's real." And so what did he have?
[1:20:07] Right there in the briefest of times we
[1:20:10] get an idea as we move from partial
[1:20:12] realization and through the years of
[1:20:14] hearing the word preached we think that
[1:20:17] oh it takes all these years it takes all
[1:20:19] these years but what about the 11th hour
[1:20:21] worker what about those that come in in
[1:20:23] the end what about this soldier who in
[1:20:25] just the briefest of time comes to a
[1:20:27] realization this is true Jesus Christ is
[1:20:31] true and the gospel is true and he goes
[1:20:35] from partial realization to a full
[1:20:37] realization in that very brief
[1:20:41] time. But in the message, we think we
[1:20:43] have
[1:20:44] seniority. Almost like, well, I've been
[1:20:46] believing the word for 30 years.
[1:20:50] Oh, I've been a Christian for
[1:20:53] 40. Somebody else will come along and
[1:20:55] go, hm,
[1:20:57] 42. Ah,
[1:20:59] 50. Does any of that matter? If the
[1:21:03] realization is not moving, not changing,
[1:21:06] not growing, none of that matters. You
[1:21:10] can be the same cold stone on the pew
[1:21:12] for 40
[1:21:14] years. where you can be as this young
[1:21:18] man back east just got in a car
[1:21:21] wreck. Slipped away, quit serving
[1:21:25] God, but right in the very end of his
[1:21:28] life come back, started reading his
[1:21:31] Bible, started praying, started
[1:21:33] attending church, started doing this,
[1:21:35] become very
[1:21:37] focused in a little brief time. Died way
[1:21:40] too young as far as we look at humanity.
[1:21:43] But you see, something happened that
[1:21:45] moved him from just a partial
[1:21:47] realization into a full
[1:21:50] complete
[1:21:53] realization.
[1:21:54] Look, curtain of
[1:21:56] time. Do you know who that was? No. You
[1:22:00] led that lady to the Lord when she was
[1:22:02] 90 or 90 something years
[1:22:05] old. Wow. Is that God's grace or what?
[1:22:09] She's lived 90 years of her life without
[1:22:11] Jesus Christ in her life. But then in
[1:22:14] the very end of her life, God says,
[1:22:16] "It's time for you to go not to
[1:22:18] acknowledge there's a God, not to
[1:22:20] acknowledge there's a message, not to
[1:22:21] acknowledge this and that and the other,
[1:22:23] but to bring them into a full
[1:22:25] realization of who they really
[1:22:29] are." Help me not get sidetracked,
[1:22:33] Lord. The word's going to be in us. The
[1:22:37] scripture says, "I'll write my laws upon
[1:22:38] the fleshly table of their hearts."
[1:22:41] Anybody been writing on you lately? I
[1:22:43] pray the Lord's been writing on your
[1:22:45] heart lately. I pray that it's real to
[1:22:47] you and more real than ever before. You
[1:22:50] know, there's something that is
[1:22:52] happening. Um, and uh, you know, I would
[1:22:56] say that our realization is being
[1:22:58] awakened. We're we're coming to a place
[1:23:00] that that uh, I I'd rather be poor than
[1:23:03] give up the gospel. Amen. I'd rather be
[1:23:07] destitute. I'd rather be uh bear
[1:23:10] sickness, a thorn in my flesh like the
[1:23:12] Apostle Paul speaks of than to give up
[1:23:14] the gospel. I say our our realization is
[1:23:17] being awakened. Now, I've got quite a
[1:23:19] bit of reading here. I I hope you guys
[1:23:21] are we okay?
[1:23:24] Okay. He that hath the key of David,
[1:23:27] this beautiful phrase follows and
[1:23:28] continues out of the preceding phrase,
[1:23:30] he that is true. Christ the perfect
[1:23:33] realization contrasted with partial
[1:23:36] realization. Here it is. Moses was a
[1:23:38] prophet of God. But Jesus like unto
[1:23:41] Moses was the prophet of God. David, a
[1:23:45] man after God's own heart, was king of
[1:23:47] Israel. But Jesus is the greater David,
[1:23:50] King of kings, Lord of lords, God, very
[1:23:54] God. Now David was born of the tribe of
[1:23:56] Judah, out of whom no priests came. Yet
[1:24:00] he ate of the shoebre reserved for
[1:24:02] priests. He was the great warrior
[1:24:04] overcoming the enemy, establishing the
[1:24:07] people as king. He sat on the throne. He
[1:24:11] was a
[1:24:13] prophet. He was a wonderful type of
[1:24:16] Christ. Now it says in Isaiah
[1:24:19] 22:22, "And the key of the house of
[1:24:22] David will I lay upon his shoulder. So
[1:24:25] he shall open and none shall shut. and
[1:24:28] he shall shut and none shall open. The
[1:24:30] spirit uses this Old Testament reference
[1:24:33] concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his
[1:24:36] ministry in the church. What the key of
[1:24:38] David signified at that time is a mere
[1:24:42] shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus
[1:24:45] Christ standing in the midst of the
[1:24:48] lampstand. So we see this has moved from
[1:24:50] a partial realization now that was a
[1:24:53] shadow of the type and now God brought
[1:24:56] that shadow to fullness. He brought it
[1:24:59] into its entirety or maturity. And so
[1:25:03] it's there at that time was mere shadow
[1:25:06] now fulfilled and Jesus standing in the
[1:25:08] midst of the lampstand. It has to do
[1:25:10] with our Lord after his resurrection and
[1:25:13] not his earthly pilgrimage. But what
[1:25:15] does this key signify? The answer lies
[1:25:18] in the position of the key. It is not in
[1:25:22] his
[1:25:23] hand. It's not worn around his neck.
[1:25:26] It's not placed in the hands of other
[1:25:28] men. Or the verse could not be saying
[1:25:30] that he alone has the use of that key.
[1:25:33] For he alone opens and shuts. And no man
[1:25:37] has that right but Jesus himself. Isn't
[1:25:40] that right? But where is the key? It's
[1:25:42] on his shoulder. But what does shoulder
[1:25:45] have to do with it? Read Isaiah 9:6. And
[1:25:48] the government shall be upon his
[1:25:50] shoulder. But what does this mean? The
[1:25:52] answer is this. The phrase government
[1:25:54] upon his shoulder comes from the wedding
[1:25:56] ceremony of the east. And you'll go in
[1:25:58] certain countries. Amen. We we uh been
[1:26:02] South America. It's a very strong custom
[1:26:05] there. I don't know other countries.
[1:26:07] That's all I can really reference it to.
[1:26:10] But you'll see uh what is being spoken
[1:26:13] right here in just a minute. Okay. When
[1:26:16] the bride has been committed to the
[1:26:18] groom, she takes off her
[1:26:22] veil and places it over the groom's
[1:26:25] shoulder, signifying that not only is
[1:26:28] she under his dominion, that she has tr
[1:26:31] transferred her rights to him, that he
[1:26:34] is the head, but also that he So, it's
[1:26:38] not just the
[1:26:41] bride saying, "I give all of this, my
[1:26:44] rights, everything I give it to you. But
[1:26:48] you see, by the acceptance of that veil
[1:26:51] on his shoulder, he's now declaring to
[1:26:55] her that he bears responsibility and
[1:26:58] care. And that he and he alone, no one
[1:27:01] else, no other man, no other power has
[1:27:03] any right or responsibility. And that,
[1:27:06] beloved, is the key of David. God being
[1:27:08] sovereign, he forneew by divine decree
[1:27:11] exactly who would be in his bride.
[1:27:15] Come on. People struggle with
[1:27:17] predestination, but it's all through the
[1:27:18] Bible. God declaring before the
[1:27:21] foundation of the world. God declaring
[1:27:24] that he knows his own. And he's never
[1:27:26] lost a one. So, he has to know who that
[1:27:29] is. And the that he knew by divine
[1:27:33] decree who would be in his bride. He
[1:27:35] chose her. Oh, somebody ought to raise a
[1:27:38] hand and say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:27:40] you, Lord. You chose me." Amen. She did
[1:27:43] not choose him. He called her. She did
[1:27:47] not come on her own. He died for her. He
[1:27:50] washed her in his own
[1:27:53] blood. My paid a price for her. She
[1:27:57] belongs to him. See how this goes
[1:27:59] against the culture of our day? The
[1:28:01] culture of our day comes right down. And
[1:28:03] sorry sisters, I I'm not referring to
[1:28:06] you. But you know what? Uh, I I'm in
[1:28:08] control of my own destiny, my body, my
[1:28:10] decision, my choice. All of these things
[1:28:13] are now a defiance. You see them as an
[1:28:16] expression. It's a defiance in the
[1:28:19] natural, but it's also a defiance in the
[1:28:22] spiritual realm. They're telling God, "I
[1:28:25] can control my destiny. I don't need to
[1:28:27] be under your headship. In fact, I would
[1:28:30] refuse to put my veil on your shoulder
[1:28:33] and give complete control to you."
[1:28:36] Oh my brother and sister, Lord, help us.
[1:28:38] You see, that's what's wrong with our
[1:28:40] churches in this day is the church
[1:28:42] herself, right? The church always
[1:28:45] reflects is is represented as a woman.
[1:28:48] She's refusing now to give complete
[1:28:50] control to the bridegroom, right? She
[1:28:53] wants to have her own doctrine. She
[1:28:55] wants to interpret the word of God,
[1:28:57] God's word, the word that God put
[1:28:59] together. She wants to interpret it how
[1:29:02] she wants to interpret it. Which is why
[1:29:04] I brought out the little deal about this
[1:29:06] recent denominational thing. You know,
[1:29:08] they want to not take the word what the
[1:29:11] word says. They want to take what their
[1:29:13] emotion, their feeling, inclusiveness,
[1:29:15] and all of these things. You know, God
[1:29:17] was
[1:29:18] inclusive. He gave eternal life. Amen.
[1:29:22] He said to all that would believe.
[1:29:25] Just the fact that he knew who would
[1:29:26] believe, my brother and sister, it
[1:29:28] wasn't a roll of the dice. Oh, maybe
[1:29:30] they will or maybe they won't. God knew.
[1:29:32] He didn't force us to believe, but he
[1:29:35] knew. Either that or he's not God,
[1:29:38] right?
[1:29:40] He knew who would believe.
[1:29:42] And he knew they wouldn't. And he knew
[1:29:45] you would. Lord, help us. Let us never
[1:29:48] take that for granted. Oh, God chose me.
[1:29:50] I don't have to do it. No, we have our
[1:29:52] part to play. Amen. We got a life to
[1:29:54] live. We've got a gospel to represent.
[1:29:57] Amen. We We've got a testimony to share.
[1:30:01] Amen. So, as we look at this, we realize
[1:30:04] she's wholly committed. Well, let me
[1:30:08] back up. She belongs to him and to him
[1:30:11] alone. My none of this. I'll go search
[1:30:15] for one that'll treat me
[1:30:17] nicer. This is some time back. And if it
[1:30:20] sounds like I'm being harsh on churches,
[1:30:22] I'm not. They're good people in there.
[1:30:23] They're just not doing their job
[1:30:28] anymore. Some time
[1:30:30] back, I saw an article of how this
[1:30:34] church, the pastor had, he said, a
[1:30:37] vision. And so they added a sports
[1:30:40] complex and a daycare and a library to
[1:30:44] their
[1:30:45] church because in this vision the people
[1:30:48] poured into their church and that's what
[1:30:51] would attract
[1:30:52] them. When has it ever been a sports
[1:30:55] complex and a library and a daycare been
[1:30:59] the foundation of the gospel? Right.
[1:31:02] See, not the word,
[1:31:05] all the amenities. Right. Exactly. And
[1:31:08] they had like a 140% increase in single
[1:31:13] mothers attending their
[1:31:15] church. And this is what blew me away
[1:31:18] because we had the revelation that these
[1:31:21] single mothers needed a break from their
[1:31:24] children and we could provide that.
[1:31:28] Not they needed more of the Lord, more
[1:31:31] of the word of God, needed a heightened
[1:31:34] spiritual awareness of who they were,
[1:31:37] just a
[1:31:40] break. My brother and sisters, see how
[1:31:42] it's convoluted the gospel.
[1:31:47] Cuz I'll tell you what, you get them
[1:31:48] mothers, single mothers, what a life,
[1:31:50] difficult, hard life. I mean, let's not
[1:31:52] deny it. It's just hard life. But if we
[1:31:54] get those mothers filled with the Holy
[1:31:56] Ghost, the Holy Spirit will pour the
[1:31:58] strength into them that they can endure
[1:32:01] their circumstance and raise their
[1:32:03] children to serve God. Instead, we don't
[1:32:06] change their life. We just give them a
[1:32:08] break.
[1:32:11] Am I being harsh? No.
[1:32:17] She is wholly committed to him and he
[1:32:19] accepts the obligation. He is her head
[1:32:22] for Christ is the head of his church.
[1:32:25] Sarah called Abraham Lord. Even so the
[1:32:27] bride is happy that he is her Lord. He
[1:32:31] speaks she obeys for that is her
[1:32:34] delight. I say Lord when your word
[1:32:36] speaks to me. Amen. It is our delight.
[1:32:40] Oh you know yes it is sweet in our mouth
[1:32:43] and it is bitter in our belly. Let's not
[1:32:46] deny that. That's what the word said it
[1:32:48] would be. There'll be times we've faced
[1:32:50] great adversity, but there's also a joy
[1:32:52] in our heart to know God loves me enough
[1:32:54] to give me the truth. Amen. He doesn't
[1:32:57] call me by emotion. He doesn't call me
[1:32:59] by circumstance. He called me by the
[1:33:01] word. And the word is sufficient for our
[1:33:05] need in this day.
[1:33:07] Amen. I don't even know what time it
[1:33:11] is. Running out of time.
[1:33:29] I think I will just go ahead and move a
[1:33:32] little bit farther forward there.
[1:33:33] Brother
[1:33:38] Isaac, you see what's happened?
[1:33:43] Jesus, the word says he's the true bread
[1:33:45] from heaven. And we can eat
[1:33:48] mana, natural mana, religious
[1:33:52] mana, but we'll be hungry
[1:33:55] again. But we eat of that mana, which is
[1:33:58] the word of God, Christ himself, and
[1:34:00] we'll never hunger again. We eat of that
[1:34:02] mana, and we are then being filled or
[1:34:06] brought into eternal life. So, it's not
[1:34:10] just that we're eating, it's what we're
[1:34:11] eating. We can eat a lot of religious
[1:34:14] commentary and some of that is good. But
[1:34:18] I can share I won't but I could share
[1:34:20] right now a situation of where a young
[1:34:23] man's life is t turning upside down
[1:34:25] because he's just reading all this
[1:34:27] religious commentary and there's
[1:34:30] confusion contradiction between the
[1:34:32] commentaries and now he's not found a
[1:34:35] peace or a security or a solid
[1:34:38] foundation. and he's found confusion
[1:34:40] because this commentary says this, this
[1:34:43] commentary says that, that commentary
[1:34:45] says that, and I don't know which one to
[1:34:47] believe. My brother and sister, forget
[1:34:50] their commentary. Read the word of God.
[1:34:52] Ask God to open or uh interpret the word
[1:34:56] to it, and then we won't need that. We
[1:34:58] won't have a a reality that's confused
[1:35:01] by opinion, but we can have a reality
[1:35:04] that's settled. We no longer need to
[1:35:06] just live in the shadow when the light
[1:35:09] has come. And the word says that the
[1:35:11] light has come. Amen. So, we need to
[1:35:13] just live in the light. Amen. And going
[1:35:16] on here, just grabbing some of these uh
[1:35:19] top notes here. Amen. There's no need
[1:35:21] for partial
[1:35:24] salvation, my brother and sister. No
[1:35:27] need partial
[1:35:29] salvation. Well, praise God. I quit my
[1:35:33] drinking. I quit my smoking. I quit my
[1:35:35] pornography. I quit this and I quit
[1:35:37] that. But no relationship with Jesus
[1:35:40] Christ. Just overcame these things. And
[1:35:44] then that constitutes. My own son shared
[1:35:47] with me testimony, which is kind of
[1:35:51] ironic because my son's not even
[1:35:52] faithful in church, but he said he was
[1:35:55] working with a guy and the guy was he's
[1:35:58] he's definitely a changed
[1:36:00] guy now. cuts his hair, looks nice and
[1:36:04] neat, doesn't go out, you know, partying
[1:36:07] anymore. He's home with his family, and
[1:36:10] he's telling my son, "You, you ought to
[1:36:11] come join this church up in the North
[1:36:14] Valley, Phoenix." In the North Valley,
[1:36:17] awesome
[1:36:19] church. And my son's like, "Oh, okay.
[1:36:21] What What is that?" He goes, "Oh, man.
[1:36:23] It's so awesome. They've got bowling
[1:36:25] league. They got basketball. They got
[1:36:27] baseball. They've got soccer.
[1:36:40] We don't have enough men for a men's
[1:36:42] soccer
[1:36:43] league. And we don't have enough young
[1:36:45] ladies for a young lady's soccer
[1:36:49] league. Man, we're out of
[1:36:52] luck. But you know, even my son said,
[1:36:55] you know what? He never
[1:36:58] mentioned never mentioned the gospel.
[1:37:05] Come on, saints.
[1:37:08] Don't let Satan tell you you've missed
[1:37:10] something because you can have every
[1:37:12] league there is. But without Christ,
[1:37:16] you've joined a club. That's right.
[1:37:19] We're not a club. We're the body of
[1:37:22] Christ. We're believers. We're
[1:37:24] Christians.
[1:37:25] And we're desiring to be the word
[1:37:28] manifested.
[1:37:30] Amen. You see, I know this is redundant.
[1:37:34] Forgive me, but just stirring up your
[1:37:35] pure minds. Our salvation is in Christ
[1:37:38] alone. No other place. That's right.
[1:37:45] Amen. Brother Alex, you were right. I
[1:37:48] have way too much.
[1:37:53] He asked me in the back room I was going
[1:37:56] to be able to do get through this. And
[1:37:58] just like I was as a little boy, my eyes
[1:38:00] are much bigger than I can
[1:38:04] handle. Let's go into um chapter nine,
[1:38:14] Leodysian. Here's the true witness. Now
[1:38:16] this word true is the same word we saw
[1:38:20] back there in Revelation 3:7. You recall
[1:38:22] that it does not mean true as in
[1:38:24] contrast to
[1:38:26] false. It has a richer, deeper meaning
[1:38:29] by far. It expresses perfect
[1:38:32] realization in contrast to partial
[1:38:36] realization.
[1:38:38] Now my brother and sister, what we want
[1:38:42] is to have a full
[1:38:46] true realization of this gospel.
[1:38:50] Without a true understanding of that
[1:38:53] here again, as I said earlier, we can
[1:38:54] attend church. It might clean us up as
[1:38:57] this friend of my
[1:38:58] son. Joel asked him, he says, "So why
[1:39:01] did you get a haircut and all this
[1:39:03] stuff?" He says, "Well," he says,
[1:39:05] "That's the way all of those guys are,
[1:39:07] and I wanted my family, so my boys and
[1:39:10] I, we we got haircuts and stuff so that
[1:39:13] we fit in with
[1:39:17] them. Is that what we want to
[1:39:21] do? Dress a certain way, look nice and
[1:39:24] clean and tidy, have a wholesome look to
[1:39:26] us to fit in? Or is the gospel
[1:39:31] actually causing us to change in our
[1:39:34] heart's desire not to please anyone
[1:39:37] around you? Don't misunderstand me
[1:39:39] today, but I'm not here to please you.
[1:39:42] I'm here to please the Lord. You can
[1:39:45] give accolades yourself. You could say,
[1:39:46] "Well done, Paul." That won't mean one
[1:39:49] thing, but for him to say, "Well done,"
[1:39:52] is everything. And so we have to come to
[1:39:55] this place that we get our priorities
[1:39:57] right and we want to get our perfect
[1:40:00] realization in contrast to partial real
[1:40:03] realization. Now back in the
[1:40:05] Philadelphiaian age the coming of the
[1:40:06] Lord was drawing nigh what great love
[1:40:08] that age manifested for him. It reminds
[1:40:11] me of those beautiful words of first
[1:40:13] Peter 1:8. Whom having not seen you
[1:40:17] love, in whom though we now see him not,
[1:40:20] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[1:40:22] unspeakable and full of glory. With them
[1:40:25] we rejoice also. And we haven't seen
[1:40:28] him, but we have felt him. Who's felt
[1:40:31] the presence of God in your life before?
[1:40:33] Amen. If you haven't, I would encourage
[1:40:35] you to come with a greater uh
[1:40:39] expectation, a greater desire. Approach
[1:40:41] God in a greater level of sincerity if
[1:40:44] you have not felt him. Amen. We're not
[1:40:46] talking about an emotional kind of
[1:40:48] feeling. We're talking about that
[1:40:49] presence of God that you know that he is
[1:40:53] here. Amen. And it's not like a terror
[1:40:56] of some demon coming in the room. But my
[1:40:59] brother and sister, literally there is a
[1:41:01] peace that passes all understanding when
[1:41:04] he is here. Amen. Amen. We know him now
[1:41:08] as much as our limiting senses can let
[1:41:12] us. But one day it will be face to face.
[1:41:14] Are you looking for that day? That is
[1:41:17] for this age. He is coming at the end of
[1:41:19] this age. And partial realization will
[1:41:22] be made perfect realization, completed
[1:41:25] realization. We can talk about the
[1:41:27] throne of God, being in the presence of
[1:41:29] God, standing there praising him,
[1:41:31] singing for eternity, my brother and
[1:41:34] sister, but none of us can comprehend
[1:41:36] what that is. We we have a a sing along
[1:41:39] or a long service. Uh we we get tired at
[1:41:42] two or three hours in church. We're
[1:41:44] we're all tired. We're ready for a
[1:41:46] change. But you see, so we cannot fathom
[1:41:49] what it would be to stand on the sea of
[1:41:52] crystal before the throne of God and
[1:41:54] just praise him for a thousand years. We
[1:41:57] can't comprehend that. But it's coming.
[1:42:00] It's coming. It's promised in the word.
[1:42:01] It's coming. We're going to come to that
[1:42:03] day when we're standing there. That will
[1:42:05] be that perfect realization. Amen. Now,
[1:42:09] I tell you, it is here. We haven't seen
[1:42:11] him, but we felt him. We know him as
[1:42:13] much as our limiting senses can let us.
[1:42:16] But one day, oh thank you Lord. One day
[1:42:19] it will be face to face. That is for
[1:42:22] this age. I know I reread that on
[1:42:25] purpose. He is coming at the end of this
[1:42:27] age. Partial realization will be made
[1:42:30] perfect realization, completed
[1:42:32] realization. Hallelujah. We have been
[1:42:34] looking through a glass darkly but soon
[1:42:37] it will be face to face. We have been
[1:42:40] going from glory to glory, but soon
[1:42:41] it'll be right in the glory. And in his
[1:42:44] glory, we'll shine. We shall be like
[1:42:46] him. Ain't that wonderful? You know, my
[1:42:50] I can't wait to be like him because we
[1:42:52] know in him was perfect love, perfect
[1:42:55] grace, perfect peace, perfect the word.
[1:42:58] And we find ourselves always just a
[1:43:01] little short here, a little short
[1:43:03] there. You
[1:43:05] know, I remember reading this man. and
[1:43:08] he was actually quite a skeptic. He
[1:43:11] said, "I hear you Christians talk about
[1:43:14] love. Why can't I see it?"
[1:43:22] It's a pretty sharp rebuke.
[1:43:25] If you have love like Christ, why can't
[1:43:28] I see it?
[1:43:34] My oh my. And you know, like they say,
[1:43:38] impostors can't impostor all the time.
[1:43:43] Sooner or later, the real man comes out.
[1:43:47] Yeah.
[1:43:50] You know why actors and
[1:43:52] actresses over time, many of them kind
[1:43:55] of go a little
[1:43:57] crazy? because they're living another
[1:44:00] personality
[1:44:02] and they lose track of their own.
[1:44:08] I don't want to be an actor.
[1:44:11] I want to be a son of God. I want to be
[1:44:13] the word. I don't want to act it. I want
[1:44:16] to be it.
[1:44:24] Soon be face to face. been going from
[1:44:26] glory to glory, but soon it'll be right
[1:44:28] in the glory and his glory will shine.
[1:44:30] We shall be like him, wondrously like
[1:44:32] him. Jesus, our savior, divine. Isn't
[1:44:34] that wonderful? I love this line. I
[1:44:37] singled it out in my notes right here. I
[1:44:40] broke it away from that and made the
[1:44:41] print
[1:44:43] larger. We are complete in him.
[1:44:49] I don't need Christ and
[1:44:51] Leodysia. I don't need Christ and the
[1:44:54] church. All the church has its place. I
[1:44:57] don't need Christ and the
[1:44:59] preacher. I'm complete in Jesus Christ.
[1:45:02] Amen. Now, his word says, you know,
[1:45:04] don't forsake your assembling together.
[1:45:06] All of these other things that are
[1:45:08] there, they're all part of it. But we
[1:45:10] are complete in him. That is true. He
[1:45:12] would not lie to us about that. But one
[1:45:14] day, we will be changed in the atoms.
[1:45:16] We'll put on immortality. We'll be
[1:45:18] swallowed up in life. And then we will
[1:45:21] realize realization.
[1:45:23] I'm going to just I'm not going to keep
[1:45:26] you to to go through all of the rest of
[1:45:29] my notes, but I tell you the partial is
[1:45:32] becoming perfect. Amen. Christ in you,
[1:45:35] the hope of glory. The work he has begun
[1:45:37] in you, he said, "I will
[1:45:41] finish." We have nothing to worry about,
[1:45:45] saints. Just take your
[1:45:49] veil, spiritual veil.
[1:45:54] Take it off your
[1:45:56] eyes. Say, "I'm done with my own
[1:45:58] headship." Yeah, that's right. I'm going
[1:46:01] to pin it on your shoulder, Lord, and
[1:46:06] let you be in complete control.
[1:46:09] And when we give him complete
[1:46:12] control, you'll find that life gets
[1:46:16] easier. And the deeper we get in Christ,
[1:46:20] the shallower we will be in
[1:46:23] Leodosa. Shallower we'll be in the age
[1:46:26] that we live in. But you'll find, now I
[1:46:30] know this sounds a little harsh, but
[1:46:33] you'll find when you go out in the world
[1:46:34] and you
[1:46:36] mingle, you'll find a lot of shallow
[1:46:40] Christians. Hopefully this isn't too
[1:46:42] hard for you to you find a lot of
[1:46:44] shallow Christians.
[1:46:47] very deep in culture and music and
[1:46:51] fashion and all of these things. But
[1:46:54] that's exactly the opposite of what God
[1:46:56] wants us to be. He wants us to be deep
[1:46:59] in his word, in his life, in him, and
[1:47:03] shallow in the things of this
[1:47:07] world. I just read a little deal about
[1:47:09] the Amish. This reporter got permission
[1:47:12] from the Amish to come travel in their
[1:47:15] midst and do this report. And when they
[1:47:18] went there after the fact, this young
[1:47:20] lady says, "I I initially went there and
[1:47:23] deep down inside I was going to take
[1:47:26] this opportunity and I was going to
[1:47:28] prove how the Amish people live such a
[1:47:32] shallow life and, you know, so limited
[1:47:35] and all this stuff." And after spending
[1:47:37] three months with them, she went back to
[1:47:40] her life and thought, "My my life is so
[1:47:48] shallow." Lord, help
[1:47:51] us not to be deep in the things of this
[1:47:55] world.
[1:47:57] Let's go to Revelations
[1:48:00] 22 and
[1:48:13] uh I Jesus have sent my angel to testify
[1:48:16] unto you these things in the churches. I
[1:48:19] am the root and the offspring of David,
[1:48:21] a bright morning
[1:48:23] star. And the spirit and the bride say
[1:48:27] come. And let him that heareth say come.
[1:48:32] And let him that is a thirst come. And
[1:48:35] whosoever will, let him take of the
[1:48:38] water of life freely. For I testify unto
[1:48:43] every man that heareth the words of the
[1:48:46] prophecy of this book. If any man shall
[1:48:48] add unto these things, God shall add
[1:48:51] unto him the plagues that are written in
[1:48:53] the book, this book. And if any man
[1:48:56] shall take away from the words of the
[1:48:58] book of this prophecy, God shall take
[1:49:00] away his part out of the book of life
[1:49:03] and out of the holy city and from the
[1:49:05] things which are written in this book.
[1:49:07] Come, Sister Rica. Amen. He that
[1:49:10] testifies these things saith, Surely I
[1:49:12] come quickly. Amen. Even so, come Lord
[1:49:18] Jesus. Let that be our heart's
[1:49:22] desire. Let us come to the place that
[1:49:25] that realization is so
[1:49:28] real. We're not looking for another
[1:49:31] year, 10, 20 on this earth. But Lord, if
[1:49:35] you would choose to come today or come
[1:49:37] on an Easter morning, whatever it would
[1:49:40] be, Lord, I want to be ready. I want to
[1:49:43] just be there and let that realization
[1:49:45] soak into me that I have one way into
[1:49:49] eternal life and that is my Lord Jesus
[1:49:51] Christ. And as we press into that, my
[1:49:54] brother and sister, you'll find, you
[1:49:56] know, brother Paul's been to the doctor
[1:50:00] a few times lately
[1:50:01] and you know, you ask them,
[1:50:04] "Hey, how long does it take for this to
[1:50:07] take effect? How long does this take to
[1:50:09] be there?" and they'll tell you,
[1:50:13] "Oh, it's not inst instantaneous. You'll
[1:50:16] you'll have to take it for a little bit.
[1:50:19] It'll start to have an effect on you."
[1:50:21] My brother and sister, this gospel is
[1:50:23] not going to in most cases, I would say,
[1:50:26] not going to be an
[1:50:27] instantaneous complete change of your
[1:50:29] life.
[1:50:31] I always think
[1:50:33] back, you know, remember that man got
[1:50:37] converted, kept telling brother
[1:50:39] Brandham, he says,
[1:50:41] "Uh, I can't stop
[1:50:43] smoking and I just I can't do
[1:50:46] this." But you see the antidote there,
[1:50:49] as much as he had tried to do it on his
[1:50:52] own, he thought he was doing
[1:50:54] it, but he was doing it on his own.
[1:50:58] But God used something to jar him, to
[1:51:00] change him. And I hope you guys don't
[1:51:03] mind
[1:51:04] today. If we've been just a little bit
[1:51:08] slack as a church, a group of
[1:51:11] believers, I hope God jars
[1:51:15] you. I hope he causes something to cause
[1:51:19] you to
[1:51:21] realize, I need you, Lord. I need you
[1:51:25] more than I thought that I needed
[1:51:28] you. God bless you, saints. Let's just
[1:51:30] stand. We'll sing a song or two.
[1:51:37] Amen.
[1:51:39] 969. Listen to our
[1:51:42] hearts. Hallelujah.
[1:51:45] [Music]
[1:51:49] How do you
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:54] explain? How do you
[1:51:59] describe a love that grows from east to
[1:52:06] west? Earth as deep as it is wide.
[1:52:13] You know all our
[1:52:18] hopes. You know all our
[1:52:24] fears. When words could not express the
[1:52:28] love we feel, but we long for you to
[1:52:33] hear.
[1:52:38] Listen to our
[1:52:43] hearts. Hear our spirits
[1:52:48] sing. The song of praise that
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:54] flows from those you have
[1:53:00] redeemed. And we will use the words, the
[1:53:03] words we know to tell you
[1:53:08] what an awesome God you are. When words
[1:53:14] are not enough to tell you of our love,
[1:53:20] just listen to our heart.
[1:53:26] words could fall like rain
[1:53:32] from these lips of
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:37] mine. And if I had a thousand
[1:53:42] years, I would still run out of
[1:53:48] time. So if you listen to my heart,
[1:53:56] Every beat will
[1:54:00] say, "Thank you for the life. Thank you
[1:54:05] for the
[1:54:06] truth. Thank you for the
[1:54:12] way. Listen to our
[1:54:18] hearts. Hear our spirit sing.
[1:54:24] The song of praise that
[1:54:29] flows from those you have
[1:54:35] redeemed. And we will use the words we
[1:54:39] know to tell you what an awesome
[1:54:45] God you are. When words are not enough
[1:54:50] to tell you of our love, just listen to
[1:54:55] our
[1:54:58] hearts. Amen. Number
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:04] 994.
[1:55:07] Amazing
[1:55:09] grace, how
[1:55:11] sweet the
[1:55:14] sound that
[1:55:16] saved a
[1:55:19] rich like
[1:55:24] me. I
[1:55:26] once was
[1:55:29] lost, but
[1:55:31] now I'm found.
[1:55:34] was
[1:55:36] blind but
[1:55:38] now I
[1:55:43] see. Was
[1:55:45] grace that
[1:55:47] taught my
[1:55:50] heart to
[1:55:52] fear and
[1:55:54] grace my
[1:55:57] fears relief.
[1:56:03] How
[1:56:05] precious
[1:56:06] did that
[1:56:09] grace
[1:56:11] appear. The
[1:56:13] hour I
[1:56:16] first
[1:56:19] believe. My chains are
[1:56:24] gone. I've been set
[1:56:29] free. My God, my s
[1:56:35] ransomed
[1:56:38] me and like a
[1:56:43] flood his
[1:56:45] mercy reigns.
[1:56:49] Unending
[1:56:52] love,
[1:56:54] amazing
[1:56:58] grace. The
[1:57:01] Lord has
[1:57:03] promised
[1:57:05] good to
[1:57:07] me. His
[1:57:10] word my
[1:57:12] hope secures.
[1:57:18] He
[1:57:19] will my
[1:57:21] shield and
[1:57:24] portion
[1:57:26] me as
[1:57:28] long as
[1:57:31] life
[1:57:35] endures. The
[1:57:37] earth shall
[1:57:40] soon
[1:57:42] dissolve like snow.
[1:57:45] the
[1:57:47] sun
[1:57:49] forbear to
[1:57:53] shine. But
[1:57:56] God who
[1:57:58] called me
[1:58:00] here
[1:58:02] below will
[1:58:05] be
[1:58:07] forever mine.
[1:58:11] My chains are
[1:58:15] gone. I've been set
[1:58:19] free. My God, my
[1:58:25] Savior ransomed
[1:58:29] me. And like a
[1:58:33] fl his mercy reigns.
[1:58:39] Unending
[1:58:43] love, amazing
[1:58:47] grace. My chains are
[1:58:52] gone. I've been set
[1:58:56] free. My God, my
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:01] save, ransom me.
[1:59:06] And like a
[1:59:10] flood, his
[1:59:12] mercy
[1:59:15] reigns.
[1:59:16] Unending
[1:59:20] love.
[1:59:21] Amazing
[1:59:25] grace. Amen. Before we dismiss number
[1:59:27] 894, sorry, 8:49.
[1:59:34] [Music]
[1:59:38] 8:49 In the harvest fields now
[1:59:43] ripened, there's a work for all to
[1:59:48] do. Hark the voice of God is
[1:59:53] calling to the
[1:59:55] harvest calling
[1:59:58] you. Little is much when God is in it.
[2:00:03] labor not for wealth or
[2:00:07] fame. There's a crown and you can win
[2:00:12] it. If you go in Jesus
[2:00:17] name, does the place you're called to
[2:00:21] labor seem so small and little known?
[2:00:27] It is great if God is in it and he'll
[2:00:33] not forget his
[2:00:36] own. Little is much when God is in it.
[2:00:41] Labor not for wealth or
[2:00:45] fame. There's a crown and you can win it
[2:00:51] if you go in Jesus name. When the
[2:00:57] conflict here is
[2:00:59] ended and our race on earth is
[2:01:04] run, he will say, "If we are
[2:01:09] faithful, welcome home, my child, well
[2:01:13] done. Little is much when God is in it.
[2:01:19] Labor not for wealth or fame.
[2:01:24] There's a crown and you can win it if
[2:01:29] you go in Jesus'
[2:01:33] name. When we
[2:01:35] enter heaven's
[2:01:37] portals and our
[2:01:40] Savior's face, we
[2:01:42] see cares of life will be
[2:01:47] forgotten. We'll be happy, glad, and
[2:01:51] free.
[2:01:53] Little is much when God is in it. Labor
[2:01:58] not for wealth or
[2:02:01] fame. There's a crown and you can win
[2:02:06] it. If you go in Jesus name. Oh, little
[2:02:12] is much when God is in it. Labor not for
[2:02:19] wealth or fame.
[2:02:22] There's a crown and you can win it if
[2:02:27] you go in Jesus
[2:02:30] name. Amen. God bless you.
