[3:05] [Music]
[5:19] Good evening
[5:21] friends. God bless you
[5:23] all. Uh why don't we start with um
[5:26] actually the song that you're playing,
[5:27] one of the few.
[5:29] [Music]
[5:33] I am one of the
[5:36] few. One of the few. And by faith in
[5:41] God's word, I can claim
[5:44] it. Though the way may seem long, though
[5:48] the opposition strong, for the bride,
[5:52] there's a way
[5:56] provided. If I plan to go through just
[6:00] to hope will not do, I must be firmly
[6:07] decided to follow the Lord by obeying
[6:13] his word and believe that I'm one of the
[6:18] few. One more time. I am one of the
[6:23] few. One of the few. And by faith in
[6:28] God's word, I can claim
[6:31] it. Though the way may seem long, though
[6:35] the opposition strong for the bride,
[6:39] there's a way
[6:43] provided. If I plan to go through just
[6:47] to hope will not do, I must be firmly
[6:54] decided to follow the Lord by obeying
[7:00] his word and believe that I'm one of the
[7:06] few. Amen. Number 699,
[7:11] [Music]
[7:16] please. As the deer panteth
[7:23] for, the water so my soul
[7:29] longeth
[7:31] after thee.
[7:38] You
[7:40] alone are my
[7:43] heart's
[7:45] desire and I
[7:48] long to
[7:51] worship thee.
[7:58] You
[8:00] alone are my strength, my
[8:06] shield. To you
[8:10] alone does my
[8:13] spirit yield.
[8:17] [Music]
[8:20] You
[8:22] alone are my
[8:25] heart
[8:27] desire and I
[8:30] long to
[8:33] worship
[8:38] thee. You're my friend and you
[8:44] are my brother.
[8:48] Even
[8:49] though you
[8:52] are a
[8:56] king and I want you more than
[9:04] any other so much
[9:08] more than
[9:16] anything. You
[9:20] alone are my strength, my
[9:25] shield. To you
[9:29] alone does my
[9:33] spirit yield.
[9:39] You
[9:42] alone are my
[9:45] heart
[9:46] desire and I
[9:49] long to
[9:52] worship
[9:57] thee. I want you more than
[10:04] gold or silver. Only
[10:09] you can
[10:13] [Music]
[10:16] satisfy. You
[10:20] alone are the
[10:23] real joy giver and the
[10:28] apple
[10:30] of my eye.
[10:37] You
[10:39] alone are my strength, my
[10:44] shield. To you
[10:49] alone does my
[10:52] spirit yield.
[10:59] You
[11:01] alone are my
[11:04] heart
[11:06] desire and I
[11:09] long to
[11:12] worship thee.
[11:16] [Music]
[11:19] He
[11:22] has
[11:25] forgiven
[11:28] me. My
[11:30] sins have been
[11:34] washed from his memory.
[11:37] [Music]
[11:41] by the
[11:42] blood of the
[11:45] [Music]
[11:46] lamb of
[11:53] calary.
[11:56] He
[11:58] has
[12:02] forgiven me.
[12:05] Oh,
[12:08] he
[12:10] has
[12:13] forgiven
[12:16] me. My
[12:18] sins have been
[12:21] washed from his memory.
[12:25] [Music]
[12:28] By the
[12:30] blood of the
[12:34] lamb of
[12:35] [Music]
[12:40] calary.
[12:43] He
[12:45] has
[12:49] forgiven
[12:51] me. Let's go to number
[12:54] 884. Sing it this Sunday, but it's a
[12:57] beautiful song. I thought we sing it
[12:58] with the
[12:59] [Music]
[13:04] verses. No one
[13:07] knew how
[13:09] alone I was
[13:14] feeling and the
[13:17] emptiness I tried so hard to hide.
[13:26] Though I laughed and said my life was
[13:31] fine without
[13:36] you. I was covering up the secret tears
[13:43] I cried.
[13:48] Then one
[13:50] day someone told me of your
[13:58] mercy and the love you showed on a hill
[14:03] called
[14:05] [Music]
[14:08] Calary. There you
[14:12] die and purchase my redemption.
[14:20] when you broke sin's power and set my
[14:26] spirit
[14:29] free. And I'm
[14:35] amazed that you love me.
[14:42] I'm
[14:46] amazed how you
[14:51] care. Through your
[14:55] preious
[14:56] blood I found
[15:01] pardon and my
[15:05] sins are washed.
[15:09] They're all washed
[15:12] away. All my
[15:15] sins are
[15:18] washed
[15:23] away. Oh, it's
[15:25] true. There have been
[15:28] days when I failed you.
[15:34] Lord, you know the many times I've gone
[15:43] astray. But I've learned your love is
[15:48] stronger than my
[15:54] weakness. And your ear is
[15:58] open every time I pray.
[16:06] No one else has ever cared for me like
[16:12] you,
[16:15] Lord. Other friends could never be as
[16:21] close to me.
[16:25] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[16:36] tomorrow. Knowing you are
[16:40] everything I'll ever need.
[16:47] I'm
[16:51] amazed that you love
[16:56] me. I'm
[17:01] amazed how you
[17:06] care. Through your
[17:10] preious blood, I found pardon.
[17:18] And my
[17:20] sins are
[17:23] washed. They're all washed
[17:27] away. All my
[17:30] sins are
[17:33] washed away. I'm amazed.
[17:37] Oh, I'm
[17:42] amazed that you love
[17:47] me. I'm
[17:52] amazed how you
[17:57] came. Through your
[18:01] preious blood, I found pardon.
[18:09] And my
[18:11] sins are
[18:14] washed. They're all washed
[18:18] away. All my
[18:21] sins are
[18:24] washed
[18:28] away. Amen. Number 321. As we prepare
[18:31] for
[18:34] prayer, that's KFC.

[19:47] already
[19:51] proided.
[19:53] Everything you need, he's
[19:58] already provided.
[20:05] Every promise you can
[20:10] claim, just ask it in his
[20:17] name. Everything you
[20:22] need. He's
[20:24] already
[20:25] proided every promise.
[20:29] Oh, every promise you can
[20:36] claim, just ask it in his
[20:42] name. Everything you
[20:47] need, he's
[20:49] already
[20:54] proided. Amen.
[20:59] You know, usually brother Paul gives me
[21:01] the prayer requests. I came out here not
[21:04] uh with nothing written down, but
[21:07] um we know to remember the Graham's
[21:09] family as they travel to Arizona and
[21:12] that whole situation. So, we'll remember
[21:14] them in prayer as well as the sister
[21:17] Rebecca uh from the group
[21:19] chat. Um sounds very dire. So, we'll
[21:22] just remember them in prayer.

[21:27] circumstances. Let's just pray for each

[23:04] strength, Lord. And I'll just be excited
[23:06] to see them. Um we just commit

[23:23] Amen. Amen. Let's go to number 471.
[23:32] [Music]
[23:43] shackled by a
[23:46] heavy
[23:47] [Music]
[23:50] burden and beneath the load of
[23:55] guilt and shame.
[24:02] Then the hand of
[24:05] Jesus touched
[24:09] me and
[24:11] now I am no
[24:14] longer the
[24:18] same. For he touched

[27:02] as we sing this last song as we invite

[27:08] chorus.
[27:12] of course is all we
[27:14] [Music]
[27:20] have. Don't
[27:23] lose your
[27:26] vision of
[27:27] [Music]
[27:30] Jesus. Keep your
[27:34] eyes ever on him.
[27:39] [Music]
[27:41] Many friends and dear loved
[27:46] ones have
[27:48] lost their
[27:50] way. They have
[27:53] lost their
[27:55] vision of him. One more
[28:00] time. Oh, don't
[28:03] lose your
[28:05] vision of Jesus.
[28:10] us. Keep your
[28:13] eyes

[28:25] ones have

[28:30] They have
[28:33] lost their
[28:35] vision of
[28:39] him. Amen. Let's sing u Lord prepare me
[28:42] as this last song.
[28:45] [Music]
[28:54] Lord
[28:56] prepare
[28:58] me to be a
[29:06] sanctuary, pure and
[29:12] holy, tried and
[29:18] true, and with thanksgiving
[29:24] living. I'll be a
[29:31] living
[29:33] [Music]
[29:37] sanctuary
[29:39] for you. Lord, I'm willing now.
[29:44] Oh Lord, I'm
[29:49] willing to be a
[29:52] [Music]
[29:56] sanctuary, pure and
[29:59] [Music]
[30:02] holy, tried and
[30:09] true with thanksgiving.
[30:14] living. I'll be a
[30:19] [Music]
[30:27] living
[30:29] for
[30:33] [Music]
[30:35] you. If you're willing to be a
[30:39] sanctuary, God will use you.
[30:43] But you've got to be willing.
[30:47] Amen. And he does prepare us. He knows
[30:49] how to prepare
[30:51] us. He works in and through his bride in
[30:54] this
[30:56] day. Amen. Are you happy to be in the
[30:59] Lord in the house of the Lord tonight?
[31:02] Amen. It's more than just this house.
[31:06] We're happy to be in the house in his
[31:09] house. Yes, sir. Amen. His place of
[31:12] worship, that's quite a place to be in
[31:14] in this hour. Quite a place to
[31:17] abide. And it's a it's a secret
[31:22] place. It's a hiding
[31:25] place. But thank God, he provided it for
[31:28] his people, his bride. In the midst of
[31:31] all this turmoil and confusion, we we
[31:34] are at peace. We have total peace. We
[31:38] are completely hid away. Satan couldn't
[31:41] get to us. No way, no shape, no form
[31:45] unless God would allow him to. But
[31:50] there's one thing he cannot do. He
[31:52] cannot take you out of eternal life. So,
[31:56] thank God for that. Thank God for his
[31:58] grace. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[32:00] prayer. Our heavenly father, we give
[32:04] ourselves over to you tonight.
[32:06] This is a message, Lord, you know that
[32:08] has been on my heart for a long time,
[32:11] well over a month or better. And Lord, I
[32:14] I just thank you for it. It's simple,
[32:18] but Lord, may we realize the pro the
[32:21] profoundness of it and what it means and
[32:24] the secret of it, Lord, that to see you
[32:26] made manifest in our midst. Father, take
[32:30] this vessel, speak through me. I'm
[32:32] willing to speak whatever you lay in my
[32:33] heart and bring this message in the way
[32:36] you would have it
[32:37] brought regardless of what I have on
[32:39] notes. Regardless, Lord, it's in your
[32:42] hands. Lord, I believe that with all my
[32:45] heart. And these people haven't come in
[32:46] vain. Though there be a few here, yet
[32:49] where two or three are gathered together
[32:51] in my name, there am I in the midst of
[32:54] them. And so, Father, we exalt you. We
[32:57] are No, you're here. It's not the
[32:59] number. It's nothing. But Lord, I know
[33:03] if there's a hungry heart here, you're
[33:04] willing to feed
[33:06] it. We're willing to serve you, Lord,
[33:08] but there's only one provided way of
[33:10] serving you, and that's through your
[33:12] word. And we thank you for providing
[33:15] that perfect way, for your ways are
[33:17] perfect. And we rejoice in this with
[33:20] thanksgiving. Speak now through your
[33:22] word. Speak what's in your heart. and
[33:25] speak it through these lips of clay that
[33:27] I give over in submission to you and for
[33:30] your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[33:35] Amen. May God bless those that are
[33:37] online. May God feed their souls. Also,
[33:40] if you'd like to turn with me in your
[33:42] word, in your Bibles, and that is our
[33:44] word. Amen. Turn with me in your
[33:50] word. Exactly right. Turn with me in the
[33:53] word to to Luke chapter
[33:57] 1 beginning with the 26th
[34:01] verse. A little lengthy reading. I
[34:03] wouldn't necessarily have to read this
[34:06] entirety but I just feel like we need
[34:08] to. And in the 26th verse speaking of
[34:12] Mary and in the sixth month, the angel
[34:15] Gabriel, now remember, brother Bram said
[34:17] Gabriel announces the first coming and
[34:20] Gabriel announces the second. Amen. Do
[34:24] we know where we're at? We he has done
[34:27] announced it.
[34:29] Amen. And so here we are at fulfilling
[34:32] of prophecy and and seeing the
[34:36] scriptures being fulfilled.
[34:38] But in the sixth month, the angel
[34:40] Gabriel was sent from God, a messenger
[34:42] from God, unto the city of Galilee named
[34:45] Nazareth, to a virgin espouseed to a man
[34:48] whose name was Joseph of the house of
[34:50] David. And the virgin's name was Mary.
[34:53] And the angel came in unto her. It's
[34:55] interesting the wording here. The angel
[34:58] came in unto her and said, "Hail." Now,
[35:00] I I look at the angel, but who's who's
[35:03] the who's the word coming through that
[35:06] angel? The Holy Ghost. So the angel came
[35:08] in unto her and said, "Hail, thou art
[35:12] highly
[35:13] favored. The Lord is with thee." Now
[35:17] that's the Lord speaking to Mary. The
[35:20] Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
[35:23] among women. And when she saw him, she
[35:26] was troubled at this, saying, "You would
[35:29] be
[35:29] too." And cast in her mind what manner
[35:32] of salutation this should be.
[35:36] And the angel said unto her, "Fear not."
[35:40] I always love that.
[35:42] "Fear not, Mary." Brother Bram said,
[35:44] when there's when he says, "Fear not,
[35:46] there's going to be there's going to be
[35:48] an engagement at hand. There's going to
[35:50] be trouble,
[35:53] trials." But he said, "Fear not, Mary,
[35:56] for thou hast found favor with God."
[35:59] Other words, don't fear what you're
[36:00] thinking.
[36:02] and behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
[36:05] womb, and bring forth a son, and shall
[36:09] call his name Jesus. Now, Brother Bram
[36:12] said, every we believe something's
[36:14] happened in our day, and this has a dual
[36:18] revelation. For we know what the promise
[36:20] is in this day. There is a bride
[36:22] conceiving in her womb, her spiritual
[36:24] womb. This is a physical womb. There is
[36:27] a spiritual womb. Amen. For thou hast
[36:30] found favor with God. And behold, thou
[36:32] shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring
[36:34] forth a son, and shall call his name
[36:37] Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be
[36:40] called the son of the highest. And the
[36:43] Lord God shall give unto him the throne
[36:45] of his father David. And he shall reign
[36:48] over the house of Jacob forever, and of
[36:51] his kingdom there shall be no end. And
[36:54] then said Mary unto the angel, "How
[36:58] shall this be?" And and that was a that
[37:01] was not arguing with the angel. She just
[37:04] said a legitimate question. "How shall
[37:06] this be, seeing I know not a man?" And
[37:09] the angel answered and said unto her,
[37:10] "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
[37:14] and the power of the highest shall
[37:17] overshadow thee. Therefore also that
[37:20] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[37:22] shall be called the son of God not the
[37:25] son of Joseph shall be called the son of
[37:28] God and that's what he was
[37:31] who is this new birth in you
[37:35] and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she she
[37:39] hath conceived a son in her old age and
[37:44] this isn't this other words he's con
[37:46] he's consoling her This this is
[37:49] happening. Amen. What I've told you.
[37:52] Now, here she is conceiving a son, a
[37:54] miracle in her old age. And this is the
[37:57] sixth month with her who was called
[37:59] barren. For with God nothing shall be
[38:03] impossible. I want that really to sink
[38:06] deep. For with God, with the
[38:10] word nothing shall be impossible.
[38:14] And Mary said, "Behold," I just love
[38:17] this. Now look at her
[38:20] response. Mary said, "Behold, the
[38:23] handmade of the Lord, be it unto me
[38:26] according to thy word." And the angel
[38:30] departed from her. You may be seated.
[38:33] Turn with me to
[38:36] Hebrews the 11th
[38:40] chapter. I'll make this as short as I
[38:42] can this evening.
[38:46] I had a real, you know, after a few
[38:49] months of meditating on things and and
[38:51] having that quickened, you have a lot of
[38:53] notes and so how to bring them forth. It
[38:55] took a while today how to just lay this
[38:57] out and I pray that God will let it be a
[38:59] blessing to you. Amen. Because I believe
[39:02] God's given it. Amen.
[39:05] Amen. 11th chapter and the fifth and
[39:08] sixth verse. By faith Enoch was
[39:10] translated that he should not see death
[39:12] and was not found because God had
[39:14] translated him. For before his
[39:17] translation, this is the point I want to
[39:19] drive here. Before his translation, he
[39:21] had this testimony that he pleased God.
[39:24] Now the sixth verse, but without
[39:27] faith, it is impossible to please God.
[39:32] And I want that to go home tonight. For
[39:34] without faith, God has one provided way
[39:37] for anything. Yeah. And only one
[39:40] provided way. And to please him, you
[39:43] cannot please him without faith. Faith
[39:47] where? Now we'll come to that where
[39:49] faith anchors. Amen. So you can't please
[39:52] God. God has only one way provided to
[39:55] please him.
[39:56] That's by faith. So without faith it is
[40:01] possible to please him. For he that
[40:03] cometh to God must believe that he is,
[40:05] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[40:08] diligently seek him. Amen. Brother
[40:12] Brandham mentions in a me in a in a in a
[40:15] uh reading here and I failed to pick it
[40:18] up where it was, but I just want to read
[40:21] this. Now, she had to believe. Speaking
[40:23] of Mary, she had to believe. Now, I'll
[40:26] just back off here a minute. Just let me
[40:28] just finish what else here is in my
[40:31] heart. So he has one way to please him.
[40:34] And so my way or God's way, my self-will
[40:37] will or God's word. So I just want to
[40:40] drop that in. It's either my way, your
[40:43] way or God's way. Myself or yourself,
[40:47] will or God's word. And this is just
[40:51] what I'm going to be covering here. I'm
[40:54] not asking you to do anything. God's
[40:57] saying, "I'm I'm not asking you to do
[41:00] anything." God's not God's not asking us
[41:03] to do anything. Just stop and think
[41:05] about this. But to believe his word.
[41:10] Amen. God's asking us one thing. God is
[41:14] asking us to believe his word.
[41:17] We think we have something to do in
[41:18] this. We never had a thing to do in it.
[41:21] Right? God says one thing I'm asking you
[41:25] to do
[41:27] and you and you and I cannot even do
[41:29] that in ourselves unless it's appointed
[41:31] to us by God. But that is to believe his
[41:34] word.
[41:36] Okay? Now she had to believe something
[41:39] that had never happened. But look at her
[41:41] little childish
[41:43] heart. I just love this. I'm going to
[41:46] think her to be a just a young woman and
[41:49] about 18 20 years old. She never taken
[41:52] the second she never taken the second
[41:55] thought. She just simply accepted what
[41:58] God said. This is how it'll
[42:00] be. Amen. And she accepted it. Now
[42:05] that's simple. But that's the simplicity
[42:08] that a human cannot bow and come down
[42:10] to. It takes God for you tonight to do
[42:12] that. Amen.
[42:15] So God had in her the ability to receive
[42:18] his word.
[42:21] Amen. That's what was that the seed of
[42:24] God.
[42:26] She never taken the second thought. Now
[42:29] that that was a little different than
[42:32] what John's dad, the
[42:35] priest did. He took the second thought.
[42:39] Well, my wife's old. How can she do
[42:41] this? And he had all kinds of of of
[42:44] examples in the Bible, Hannah and Sarah
[42:46] and and many of
[42:48] them. So, but but he was rebuked for it.
[42:53] But here here is Mary. She didn't take
[42:57] the second thought. As soon as she seen
[42:59] and knowed that was the angel of the
[43:00] Lord that knowed these things and told
[43:03] her exactly according to the scripture
[43:06] and she had been thinking on meditating
[43:09] on that
[43:12] scripture. And so she knew I was the
[43:14] Lord because she he knew her name and
[43:17] knew what she had been meditating on.
[43:20] She was thinking of that scripture in
[43:23] Isaiah 7. I'll give you a sign. A virgin
[43:27] shall conceive and bear a son. All
[43:30] right, a super sign. And she'd been
[43:32] thinking on that and thinking on Isaiah
[43:34] 9:6, unto us a child is born. A son is
[43:38] given. She had been thinking on
[43:41] that and told her her name. She knowed
[43:45] that messenger come from God. And the
[43:48] scripture that she had been thinking on
[43:50] was confirmed right there to her.
[43:54] Mary, the Holy Ghost will come upon you
[43:57] and the and the Almighty shall
[43:59] overshadow thee. She asked how thin this
[44:01] be. That's how it'll be. She didn't ask.
[44:04] I don't explain that to me. How's that
[44:06] going to
[44:06] work? No, she said she said it. The Holy
[44:11] Ghost will overshadow you. The holy
[44:12] thing shall be born will not be of man,
[44:14] but he'll be called the son of God. She
[44:17] threw her little hands up and tears
[44:18] running out of those beautiful eyes
[44:20] said, "Behold the hands made of the
[44:22] Lord. Be it unto me according to thy
[44:25] word. My title tonight is at thy
[44:31] word. At thy word. Be it unto me
[44:33] according to thy
[44:38] word. You say that's pretty simple,
[44:41] brother David, but that is profound.
[44:43] Yes.
[44:45] That is deeper than what you and I can
[44:48] think it to be.
[44:51] Amen. We cannot in our humanness become
[44:53] simple enough to realize God's
[44:56] simplicity.
[44:58] We can't humanly think that simple.
[45:03] Amen. So it goes beyond the human
[45:05] ability. The simplicity of God goes
[45:07] beyond the human ability. But look at
[45:09] what he
[45:11] said. She said, "Behold, the hands made
[45:14] of the Lord. Be it unto me according to
[45:16] thy word."
[45:19] Now, that's the only way that there is
[45:23] to please
[45:25] God. Take his word. Don't trust your
[45:31] knowledge. You'll reason. How can it be?
[45:34] It cannot be done. When you reason, then
[45:36] you lose the victory. We must cast down
[45:39] reasonings and believe that God what God
[45:41] has said to be the truth.
[45:46] Amen.
[45:47] Amen. Mary never talked back to the
[45:50] angel.
[45:53] Boy, I like that. We shouldn't talk back
[45:56] to it either. When we have his word and
[45:58] we have the perfect interpretation of
[46:00] his word, there's no reason to talk
[46:02] back. Just simply say, "So be it unto me
[46:05] according to thy word." At thy word,
[46:08] Lord.
[46:10] At thy word, Lord. Amen.
[46:14] Amen. You don't need to add to it. You
[46:17] don't need to take from it. It's at thy
[46:19] word, Lord. Whatever he said to do,
[46:21] whatever he's asked to do, whatever he
[46:23] But it's always at thy word.
[46:30] When you reason, he said, you'll lose
[46:33] victory. Never talked back the angel.
[46:35] She never discussed it in any way any
[46:38] further. But she she never argued. She
[46:42] never questioned it anymore. His word
[46:45] was enough for
[46:47] her. Now, brother, sister, what's enough
[46:50] for
[46:53] us? What is enough for us? Let's go to
[46:56] Hebrews
[47:00] 10 and verse five.
[47:03] Wherefore, when he cometh into the
[47:05] world, he saith, "Sacrifice and offering
[47:09] thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou
[47:13] prepared
[47:14] me." Amen. I want you to go to Ephesians
[47:18] chapter
[47:23] 5. I'm just going to have to take this
[47:25] in a in a very just hitting high spots.
[47:28] There's so much to this that you could
[47:31] cover.
[47:33] Ephesians chapter
[47:36] 5 verse
[47:37] 23 starting with verse 23.
[47:50] For the husband is the head of the
[47:53] wife, even as Christ is the head of the
[47:57] church, and he is the savior of the
[48:04] body that he might that he is savior of
[48:07] the body. Husbands, love your wives.
[48:09] Excuse me, I missed one. Therefore, the
[48:11] church is subject unto Christ. So let
[48:14] the wives be unto their own husbands in
[48:17] everything.
[48:19] Now, we know and I'm just we know that
[48:22] Paul what he's speaking of here, he's
[48:25] he's he's bringing he's bringing the
[48:28] natural union, but what he's talking
[48:31] about here is this great mystery, but I
[48:35] speak concerning Christ in the church.
[48:37] He's typing it with the husband and
[48:39] wife. He's bringing it. He's showing
[48:42] that through this husband. Who's the
[48:47] husband of the
[48:49] bride? Husband, love your wives. Now,
[48:52] they're not saying this doesn't apply to
[48:54] us because our marriage should reflect
[48:57] this union between Christ and his
[49:03] bride. Husbands, love your wives even as
[49:06] Christ also loved the church. And what
[49:10] did he do? He gave himself for it
[49:14] that he might sanctify. That's wash.
[49:19] Clean. Sanctify. And cleanse it with the
[49:24] washing of the water by the word. Yeah.
[49:30] Okay. That he might present it to
[49:33] himself. I want you to notice this. The
[49:36] presenting of it to himself. That he
[49:38] might present it to himself. a glorious
[49:43] church, not having spot or wrinkle or
[49:46] any such thing, but that it should be
[49:48] holy and without
[49:51] blemish. So ought men to love their
[49:54] wives as their own
[49:56] bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth
[49:59] himself. So if Christ loves his bride,
[50:01] who's he loving? Himself. Himself. All
[50:05] right. Amen.
[50:08] For no man ever yet hated his own
[50:11] flesh. So who's the church? His own
[50:15] flesh. But nourisheth and cherisheth it,
[50:18] even as the Lord, the
[50:21] church. For we are members of his
[50:24] body, of his
[50:26] flesh, and of his
[50:30] bones. We are members of who?
[50:34] His body.
[50:37] of his flesh and of his bones. For this
[50:40] cause shall a man leave father and
[50:42] mother and shall be joined unto his
[50:45] wife. And they too shall be one
[50:48] flesh. Amen. Not two flesh.
[50:53] One. One
[50:57] flesh. This is a great mystery. Now,
[51:00] brother Paul's coming down and saying,
[51:02] "What I've said this for, I'm bringing
[51:05] I'm bringing this to the to what I'm
[51:07] meaning here. This is a great mystery,
[51:09] but I speak concerning Christ and the
[51:13] church."
[51:15] Nevertheless, let every one of you in
[51:17] particular so love his wife even as
[51:21] himself, and the wife see that she
[51:25] reverence her
[51:27] husband. Amen. I want to read out the
[51:30] church age book here, page 189. If
[51:33] you're if you want to write it down in
[51:36] the the new church age,
[51:38] the the brown leather or the brown or
[51:42] the red
[51:43] book reading where he said, "Pick up
[51:45] your pen and write." Now, this was not
[51:47] William Brham's writing. This was God
[51:49] writing.
[51:51] This is God speaking.
[51:58] In the last
[51:59] days, the true bride, Christ's seed,
[52:04] will come to the
[52:09] headstone and she will be a super she'll
[52:12] be the super church, a super
[52:16] race as she nears him. What's what's
[52:20] nears him? Maturity.
[52:22] Yeah.
[52:24] All right. It's growing somewhere. The
[52:27] seed's
[52:29] growing because she's got to come to
[52:31] that
[52:33] position. What is it?
[52:36] Headstone. What's the headstone? The
[52:38] full stature.
[52:40] All
[52:42] right. But God had to make a way for
[52:44] that to happen, didn't
[52:47] he? Amen. That's why we have the message
[52:49] of the hour. That's why we have the
[52:52] opening of the full revelation of the
[52:54] word. Amen. All right. Now, or the full
[52:58] revelation of Jesus
[53:01] Christ. The bride will be so much like
[53:04] him that they will even be in his image.
[53:08] This is in order to be united with him.
[53:10] They will be one.
[53:16] So if he's the
[53:18] word, she's the word.
[53:22] Amen.
[53:23] If he's the seed, Christ's seed, the
[53:26] bride is Christ's
[53:30] seed. Brother Bram just said in these
[53:32] last days, the true bride church,
[53:34] Christ's
[53:37] seed, they will be one. They will be the
[53:40] very manifestation. I want want you to
[53:42] miss this. They will be the very
[53:45] manifestation of the word of of the
[53:47] living
[53:49] God. Amen.
[53:52] Now, denominations of course will never
[53:55] produce this because it's the wrong seed
[53:57] because the seed brings forth of its
[54:01] kind. Now, I'm just going to go on do
[54:04] down here and just bypass a little bit
[54:07] here.
[54:09] We know that Adam was given a a bride,
[54:12] but she fell because she hybridized. She
[54:15] caused him to
[54:16] die. The second son was given a wife,
[54:19] but before he could marry her, she fell.
[54:22] But watch this. Paragraph 64, he said,
[54:26] "From a little group of the true seed,"
[54:28] here again, "A little group of the true
[54:33] seed of the word, the true seed of the
[54:35] word, God will present Christ with a
[54:38] beloved
[54:41] bride." So here we see from a little
[54:44] group of the true seed of the word, both
[54:47] those fell. But now, now what is he
[54:50] speaking? He's speaking in our day. He's
[54:53] speaking in our
[54:56] time from a little group of the true
[54:58] seed of the word. God will present
[55:00] Christ with a beloved bride. Will he or
[55:04] won't he? He said he will.
[55:07] All right. She is a with a beloved
[55:10] bride. She is a
[55:12] virgin of his word. Right?
[55:20] Because a virgin because she knows no
[55:22] man-made creeds or dogmas by and through
[55:25] the members of the bride will be
[55:28] fulfilled by and through the members of
[55:31] his bride will be fulfilled. All that
[55:34] was promised of God
[55:38] to be made manifest in the virgin.
[55:44] Now, she's the
[55:45] virgin. We're looking
[55:48] here in this
[55:51] day. Now, watch. He reverts back now to
[55:55] Mary. The word of
[55:59] promise. The word of promise came to the
[56:02] Virgin
[56:05] Mary. But that word of promise was
[56:09] he. Mhm. I want to make note of that.
[56:14] That word of promise was he himself
[56:19] to be made manifest. Hold that tight now
[56:24] because we're coming right back to what
[56:26] we just read here about this
[56:28] day. But here it is with Mary. He had
[56:32] but was he himself to be made manifest?
[56:35] God was made
[56:39] manifest. He himself acted at that time.
[56:44] He
[56:45] himself acted at that
[56:48] time and fulfilled his own word of
[56:52] promise, his own word of
[56:55] promise in the
[56:58] virgin. Now watch the word of promise.
[57:02] That was he.
[57:04] So, we're talking about a word of
[57:05] promise at the first coming. That was he
[57:11] all right? That was he
[57:16] himself to be made
[57:20] manifest. God was manifest. He himself
[57:23] acted at that time to fulfill his own
[57:26] word of
[57:29] promise in the virgin.
[57:32] It was an angel that brought her the
[57:34] message, but the angel's message was the
[57:37] word of
[57:39] God. And he refers to Isaiah 9:6. Unto
[57:43] us a child is given. Unto us child
[57:46] born. That was the word of God. He
[57:50] fulfilled. He fulfilled at that time all
[57:53] that was written of him.
[57:56] Now he watch that word of promise is he
[58:00] himself fulfilled at that time all that
[58:04] was
[58:06] written of him. Now watch because why
[58:11] was it fulfilled what was written of
[58:13] him? Why? It couldn't have been
[58:16] fulfilled unless this happened. Yeah.
[58:19] Why did it? Because she accepted his
[58:21] word to her. Now there's the secret.
[58:25] Yes, there's the secret
[58:28] of taking the secret is that taking God
[58:31] at his word.
[58:35] She believed it. Amen. The word of
[58:38] promise was fulfilled in her because she
[58:40] believed it and he acted himself. He was
[58:43] to manifest himself. He took the word
[58:45] that he promised, his own promise, acted
[58:48] under that word. He
[58:50] acted, gave it to her, showed her, and
[58:53] she believed it.
[59:02] Now watch. From a little group, I'm
[59:04] coming back to the this is the second
[59:07] coming. From a little group of the true
[59:10] seed of the word, God will present
[59:12] Christ with a
[59:15] beloved with a beloved bride.
[59:19] Amen. So where's that promise? That's
[59:22] the word of promise. Amen. Amen. If he
[59:26] acted the first time, he's acting again
[59:29] here. Yeah.
[59:32] All right. The members of the virgin
[59:34] bride will love him and they will have
[59:36] his potentials for he is their head and
[59:39] all power belongs to him. They are
[59:42] subject to him as the members of our
[59:44] bodies are subject to our heads.
[59:48] in the
[59:49] message. Seed is now with a shock. 65.
[59:53] Now it's seed
[59:57] time. What was the word of promise? It
[59:59] was him. What was he? The
[1:00:02] seed. It had to anchor into a
[1:00:06] virgin. Amen. It had to come to a
[1:00:09] virgin. That word of promise was he
[1:00:12] himself acting himself acted out himself
[1:00:16] bringing the promise to pass
[1:00:19] in the
[1:00:20] virgin. But there's another virgin
[1:00:24] here. Amen. Remember I just read here
[1:00:27] that this this little
[1:00:30] bride Oh, it's right
[1:00:32] here. Well, yeah, she's a
[1:00:35] virgin. Amen. All right. Now, it's seed
[1:00:40] time. Other words, it's Christ's
[1:00:44] time or bride time. He's trying to get
[1:00:48] us to see what it is. He said it's seed
[1:00:50] time, but this is the bride coming,
[1:00:53] right? This is bride time.
[1:00:58] Amen. Amen. It's seed
[1:01:04] time. Christ's seed, right? He promised
[1:01:08] it would would bring Christ would bring
[1:01:11] that bride give Christ a bride. The
[1:01:15] shucks are dead. He said it's bride
[1:01:18] time himself.
[1:01:20] Watch seed time himself manifested. It's
[1:01:24] himself manifest. It's bride age.
[1:01:26] Brother Bram said in the place bride
[1:01:29] time. She's to come on the scene. It's
[1:01:31] the promise. Do you realize this day
[1:01:34] this scripture fulfilled? He said
[1:01:36] there's to come on the scene in this
[1:01:38] hour the word of promise again and it
[1:01:41] would be a bride to the promised son. It
[1:01:44] would be a royal seed of the royal son
[1:01:47] and she's to come on the scene in this
[1:01:49] last
[1:01:50] day. So we're seeing the fulfillment of
[1:01:52] scripture in this last day. It's not
[1:01:55] another. It's him.
[1:01:59] In bride time in bride form. All right.
[1:02:02] The shucks are
[1:02:04] dead. See? No. What is she? She is him.
[1:02:08] She's the seed. She's royal seed. She is
[1:02:10] him. Okay. The shucks are dead. What's
[1:02:13] he mean when the shucks are dead? The
[1:02:16] life's come out of it.
[1:02:19] Okay. So, something's come out of that
[1:02:22] shuck. Just like he came out of Mary.
[1:02:27] Amen. Okay. So, the shucks are dead. The
[1:02:31] shucks are dried up. The virgin, it's
[1:02:33] the virgin word
[1:02:35] time. Not touch. It's a virgin. Remember
[1:02:39] a virgin word time. If you put it in the
[1:02:42] hands of a denomination, it won't be
[1:02:44] virgin. It'll be manhandled time you get
[1:02:45] to it. But God's church is not touched
[1:02:48] by denomination. Hallelujah. It's a
[1:02:52] virgin word of God. Was he a virgin-born
[1:02:56] word of God? Yeah. He acted himself. He
[1:03:00] acted, if we go back to it, as we said,
[1:03:02] he acted out it himself.
[1:03:06] So where are we going to stand? Where
[1:03:08] what are we going to receive? We're
[1:03:10] going to receive our day and our hour
[1:03:12] and our time and what's happening as
[1:03:15] time. Amen. What's taking place in this
[1:03:19] time? It's seed time again. She's a
[1:03:21] virgin-born word. She's a virginborn
[1:03:25] word of God made manifest.
[1:03:30] Jesus Christ. He's pointing to what she
[1:03:34] is.
[1:03:38] It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:03:40] today, and forever. Hallelujah. How
[1:03:42] wonderful. I love it. I believe it. I
[1:03:45] know it's the truth. It'll not be
[1:03:47] touched. There's no manhandling in the
[1:03:49] virgin
[1:03:51] birth of the bride.
[1:03:57] Amen.
[1:03:59] I I feel like going back and reading
[1:04:02] that again in that in that pick up your
[1:04:05] pen, but I think you can go back and
[1:04:07] read that. All right. Now, I want to go
[1:04:10] over here to ver Ephesians chapter
[1:04:21] 1. Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 22 and
[1:04:25] 23.
[1:04:31] and hath put all things under his feet.
[1:04:34] That's his body.
[1:04:36] And gave him to be the head over all
[1:04:39] things to the
[1:04:41] church, which is his body.
[1:04:46] Amen. So, who is who is Eve? His body.
[1:04:51] A body hast thou prepared me? What's he
[1:04:54] prepared for him today? He said he
[1:04:56] prepared Christ himself. He prepared for
[1:04:59] himself a bride. That's right.
[1:05:03] So, it's his action.
[1:05:05] It's his doing.
[1:05:07] It's his promise.
[1:05:13] Amen. We're in We're in We're in the
[1:05:15] second fold of his
[1:05:18] three-fold manifestation of the seventh
[1:05:20] seal. We're in that second fold. What's
[1:05:23] the third fold? his third coming.
[1:05:27] Are you with me? Because the he he has
[1:05:30] to climax our meeting in the air. He
[1:05:32] didn't he's not coming that way
[1:05:35] here. This time he comes in bride
[1:05:38] form. But the third coming is when he
[1:05:40] steps out to rule in a millennium.
[1:05:43] Brother Ram said, "We now see Eden is
[1:05:46] prepared for us." Amen. What are we
[1:05:49] looking for? The catching away, the
[1:05:50] meeting in the air. Amen. It's the same
[1:05:53] person here, but not in that form.
[1:05:55] Right. He's here in bride form. That's
[1:05:58] right. Amen. That's right. Now, that's
[1:06:01] just that's just hitting the surface of
[1:06:04] it. We can spend we can spend another
[1:06:07] hour or better, two hours or three hours
[1:06:09] just on that one topic right there. And
[1:06:11] I have many times, but that's what it
[1:06:14] is. All right.
[1:06:16] Now, but watch what he's saying. which
[1:06:19] is his body. This church put all things
[1:06:21] under his feet. Gave him to be the head
[1:06:23] over all things to the church, which is
[1:06:25] his body, the fullness. Watch this. This
[1:06:28] just leaped at me about three weeks ago.
[1:06:31] He said, he said, which is his body, the
[1:06:34] fullness of him.
[1:06:36] What is the fullness of him? The full
[1:06:38] revelation of him. Revelation 10:7, the
[1:06:42] mystery.
[1:06:45] Amen. the fullness of him.
[1:06:49] So who's this church? Who's this bride?
[1:06:51] The fullness of him. The fullness of
[1:06:53] what? The full revelation of Jesus
[1:06:56] Christ. He's not complete without you.
[1:07:00] Adam was not complete without without
[1:07:04] Mrs. Adam.
[1:07:09] Amen.
[1:07:10] He said, "It's it's not good that, you
[1:07:12] know, I I won't I won't go into all that
[1:07:14] because it's just takes too much. I'm
[1:07:16] wanting to hold steady at this. At thy
[1:07:18] word, which is his body, the fullness of
[1:07:21] him that fillth all in all."
[1:07:28] All
[1:07:30] right. He's un the fullness of him is
[1:07:32] the unveiling of himself in bride form,
[1:07:35] his second advent. John 15, chapter
[1:07:45] 15 and verse 5. I am the vine,
[1:07:51] ye are the
[1:07:54] branches. He that abideth in me. Amen.
[1:07:58] Amen.
[1:08:01] Amen. That's not in and out. That's
[1:08:04] abiding. living. He that abideth in me,
[1:08:08] and who is he? The word. And I the word
[1:08:11] in him, the same bringeth forth much
[1:08:14] fruit. For without me, you can do
[1:08:19] nothing.
[1:08:21] So without the word, you can do nothing.
[1:08:27] Amen. You're helpless. You can do
[1:08:29] nothing without the word. How do you
[1:08:31] expect the word to work through you
[1:08:32] unless you believe it? Unless you accept
[1:08:35] it, unless you say at thy word and don't
[1:08:38] add what you think to it, just simply at
[1:08:41] his word. Take him at his word and go on
[1:08:44] rejoicing. Amen.
[1:08:47] Because he's given you his word. Yeah.
[1:08:54] I'm not He's He said, I'm See, I'm here
[1:08:57] again. I'm not asking you to do anything
[1:08:58] but believe my word. Take me at my word.
[1:09:01] This is the secret. Take me at my word.
[1:09:04] For you can do nothing without
[1:09:06] me. But with me in you, I in you and you
[1:09:11] in me will bear much fruit. What will
[1:09:13] the fruit be? The fruit will be the word
[1:09:16] for the season,
[1:09:18] for the hour. All right. Now he
[1:09:23] says, so this bride is a virgin born
[1:09:26] word of God made manifest. The re
[1:09:28] brother Brandham said the revelation of
[1:09:30] Jesus Christ not for his day but for
[1:09:32] this day is growing in a bride. Yeah.
[1:09:37] And it's in the formation of his bride.
[1:09:39] Where's what is it? It's in the
[1:09:40] formation of his
[1:09:42] bride and is growing in the bride to the
[1:09:45] full stature of Christ in bride form.
[1:09:49] So what are we beholding
[1:09:52] here? What are we what are we seeing?
[1:09:54] It's astounding when you think of it.
[1:09:58] We're seeing the manifestation of his
[1:10:00] word promise of the mystery of his
[1:10:03] coming.
[1:10:04] It's how he comes that's the mystery.
[1:10:07] Yeah. That's right. Amen. Amen. That's
[1:10:09] exactly the mystery.
[1:10:12] But God by his grace opens that secret
[1:10:14] to his bride. Because only by the
[1:10:16] birthing of the word in you can you see
[1:10:18] that mystery because you can't call him
[1:10:21] Lord, right?
[1:10:23] Call him husband. Call him word lord
[1:10:26] without that holy ghost in you
[1:10:30] to reveal it.
[1:10:34] It takes the birth of the word. All
[1:10:36] right. Said what is the word bride? This
[1:10:40] is I'm quoting from brother Brandham.
[1:10:41] What is the word bride? It's the
[1:10:45] manifestation the promised word
[1:10:48] manifested. It's the manifestation for
[1:10:51] of this
[1:10:53] hour. It's the manifestation of this
[1:10:56] hour displaying to the world the
[1:10:59] attributes of God. It's displaying. What
[1:11:03] is the word bride? The the manifestation
[1:11:06] of this hour. That's promised word
[1:11:10] manifested.
[1:11:12] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:11:14] of God in the formation of the bride
[1:11:16] that's to be expressed in this
[1:11:21] hour that we are now
[1:11:24] living didn't so he's he's making it
[1:11:26] very clear this is what it is today
[1:11:29] therefore we must be that word bride
[1:11:32] living by the word amen amens
[1:11:42] I which we we read that already in verse
[1:11:45] 27.
[1:11:46] Notice Ephesians 1:4. In verse 27, he
[1:11:50] brought her to
[1:11:51] himself. Washed her. Brought her to
[1:11:54] himself. I've got a little rebound here.
[1:11:57] Brother Ivan, if you could cut that
[1:11:58] back. I'm I'm talking that keeps ringing
[1:12:01] in me in my
[1:12:03] ears. All right.
[1:12:07] um in
[1:12:11] Ephesians
[1:12:16] 5 verse 27. Let me read it again. That
[1:12:19] he might present it to himself a
[1:12:22] glorious
[1:12:24] church, not having spot or wrinkle or
[1:12:26] any such thing, but that it should be
[1:12:28] holy and without blemish.
[1:12:32] Now what did Ephesians 1:4 ch we were
[1:12:34] chosen in him that we should be holy and
[1:12:37] without blame before him in love. He has
[1:12:39] made accepted us accepted in the
[1:12:42] beloved. He hath made us. It's his
[1:12:45] action. It's his doing. He acted at that
[1:12:49] time. He's acted at this time.
[1:12:53] Amen. Amen. All right. 1 Corinthians
[1:12:58] 12. 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[1:13:02] And verse 27 says, "Now you are the body
[1:13:05] of
[1:13:06] Christ and members in particular.
[1:13:11] You vary. You're different, but you're
[1:13:13] members
[1:13:15] in your position, your place. Whether
[1:13:18] you're whether you're you're a toenail
[1:13:21] or a cell or whatever you
[1:13:24] are, it's his.
[1:13:27] It's Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. For
[1:13:31] you're members of his body. Verse 12.
[1:13:33] For the body, for as the body is one and
[1:13:36] hath many members. Notice the body is
[1:13:39] not twain. The body is one. That's
[1:13:41] right. And hath many members. And all
[1:13:44] the members of that body of that one
[1:13:47] body being many are one body. So also is
[1:13:53] Christ. So what is Christ? That body.
[1:13:56] Amen.
[1:13:58] that Christ is that body. They're no
[1:14:00] longer twain. He's one with that body.
[1:14:03] He is that body.
[1:14:06] And every member is a part of him and
[1:14:08] one with him. Amen. He is whether we be
[1:14:12] Jews or Gentiles, whether be bond or
[1:14:14] free, and have all been made to drink
[1:14:16] into that one spirit. For the body is
[1:14:19] not one member but many. You are the
[1:14:23] body. Hallelujah.
[1:14:26] Hallelujah. So
[1:14:28] therefore, we have no
[1:14:31] right. Let me just take this. We have no
[1:14:34] right to take his body and connect it to
[1:14:37] another vine. Right?
[1:14:42] We have no right to take his body. Where
[1:14:46] is he? Who is he? It's the word. His
[1:14:48] body is the word. It's himself. And we
[1:14:51] have no right to take his body and
[1:14:53] connect it to another vine.
[1:14:56] That's what Eve did. And she hybridized
[1:15:00] and caused him to die. Her husband. Is
[1:15:03] that right? Yes.
[1:15:08] She committed adultery.
[1:15:12] Her name was changed to Eve, which is
[1:15:14] the mother of all living. Adam was not
[1:15:16] the father of all living.
[1:15:20] Amen. That's right. See, that's it. So,
[1:15:23] so you can't, you're not, you have no
[1:15:25] right. She had no right to take her
[1:15:28] body. His body. It was his body. It
[1:15:30] wasn't her body. It was his body. Bone
[1:15:32] of his bone, flesh of his flesh. Adam
[1:15:35] said, "She's woman. I'll call her woman.
[1:15:38] She came out of me."
[1:15:41] Amen. It's himself.
[1:15:44] She had his
[1:15:46] spirit. God formed her in another form,
[1:15:48] but not another dirt. It was his dirt.
[1:15:51] Amen. his dust, his body
[1:15:55] formed in another form, but not another
[1:15:57] spirit. Was Adam's spirit. That's right.
[1:16:00] Amen. So is the bride today. Yeah. All
[1:16:05] right. Now, 1 Corinthians 6:13, let's
[1:16:08] dwell on this a minute about having no
[1:16:10] right. We just see right there where we
[1:16:13] are his branches. So we as his branch
[1:16:17] have no right to connect it to another
[1:16:19] vine.
[1:16:22] Okay. So, 1 Corinthians
[1:16:30] 6 and let's start here with verse
[1:16:34] 13. Meats for the belly and belly for
[1:16:41] meats. But God shall destroy both it and
[1:16:44] them. Now the body is not for
[1:16:46] fornication.
[1:16:51] Let me just back up here. I got to make
[1:16:53] this point. 11th verse. Now you know
[1:16:57] thieves, covetous, drunkards, revelers,
[1:16:59] extortioners, inherent see nor
[1:17:02] idolattors, idol adulterers, nor
[1:17:04] infinite, nor abusers of themselves of
[1:17:06] mankind. And such were some of you.
[1:17:10] I want to make this point. But you are
[1:17:11] washed.
[1:17:13] Yeah. So how are we washed?
[1:17:17] By the word. Amen. The bloody word, his
[1:17:20] own blood washed us. Amen. Cleaned us,
[1:17:24] cleansed us, separated
[1:17:27] us, washed us. So we are no longer
[1:17:30] adulterers. That old first husband died.
[1:17:34] Amen.
[1:17:35] Amen. All right.
[1:17:38] So he comes down here, meats for the
[1:17:41] belly, belly for meat, but God shall
[1:17:43] destroy both it and them. Now the body
[1:17:45] is not for fornication.
[1:17:48] Are you hearing that? But for the Lord
[1:17:51] and the Lord for the body. That's right.
[1:17:53] Okay. He's the
[1:17:55] word and the Lord for the body. The body
[1:17:59] is for the Lord, not fornication, but
[1:18:01] for the Lord and the Lord for the body.
[1:18:03] And God hath both raised up the Lord and
[1:18:06] will raise us up and will also raise up
[1:18:10] us by his own power. So because I live,
[1:18:13] you live
[1:18:14] also. All right. Know you not that your
[1:18:18] bodies are the members of
[1:18:23] Christ? Then shall I take the members of
[1:18:27] Christ and connect them to another vine?
[1:18:32] Shall I take the members of Christ and
[1:18:34] make them members of a harlot?
[1:18:37] God
[1:18:38] forbid. What? Know ye not that he which
[1:18:41] is joined to a harlot is one body? For
[1:18:45] two saith, he shall be one flesh. But he
[1:18:47] that is joined unto the Lord is one
[1:18:50] spirit.
[1:18:53] Amen.
[1:18:55] Amen. Flee fornication. Every sin that
[1:18:59] man doeth is without the body, but he
[1:19:01] that committh fornication sinnth against
[1:19:04] his own body. Then what
[1:19:06] is see what is what is the bride's own
[1:19:10] body? Amen. It's him.
[1:19:14] What? Know you not that your body is?
[1:19:17] Here it is. Know you not that your body
[1:19:19] is the temple or the dwelling place or
[1:19:24] God's place of worship
[1:19:26] of the Holy Ghost which is in you and
[1:19:30] you are you and which you have of God
[1:19:33] and you're not your own.
[1:19:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:40] For you are bought with a price.
[1:19:43] Therefore, glorify God in your body and
[1:19:46] in your spirit, which are God's.
[1:19:52] Amen. Your body, your spirit is his.
[1:19:56] It's his property. He owns you. That's
[1:19:59] right. Now, watch what the prophet
[1:20:03] said. Let me just back up here a minute.
[1:20:05] We are we are to be we are we are to be
[1:20:09] faithful to one man one vine we are to
[1:20:13] be connected to we are faithful to one
[1:20:16] man one vine one person we are to be
[1:20:21] connected to how do I prove my love to
[1:20:25] him you love him how do you prove your
[1:20:29] love to him by believing what he saidmen
[1:20:35] thy word, Lord, by believing what he
[1:20:39] said. James and James, if you want to
[1:20:42] turn over there real quick. But first,
[1:20:45] before we do that, let me just read this
[1:20:50] found in the third seal. Christ wants
[1:20:54] his wife pure with the word. In Psalm
[1:20:58] 119:140, he said, "The word is very
[1:21:00] pure."
[1:21:03] Amen. The word is very pure. You cannot
[1:21:07] mix the word with anything. It won't
[1:21:11] mix. You can't mix it with your
[1:21:13] reasoning. You can't mix it with your
[1:21:15] own ideas, your feelings. It won't mix.
[1:21:20] Amen. It stands alone. It's the
[1:21:23] absolute.
[1:21:24] Okay. Now he
[1:21:28] said the way his wife Christ wants his
[1:21:32] wife pure with the word the way she must
[1:21:34] be because nothing not one jot or one
[1:21:38] tit or anything will pass from that law
[1:21:41] from that book till it's all fulfilled.
[1:21:44] Jesus said both heavens and earth will
[1:21:46] pass away but my word shall never pass
[1:21:49] away.
[1:21:51] Don't put any private interpretation to
[1:21:53] it.
[1:21:56] Amen.
[1:21:58] You notice Mary
[1:21:59] didn't and neither will the
[1:22:03] bride. Amen. Yeah, we make mistakes. We
[1:22:06] do. But God is keeps moving her on up.
[1:22:09] He's not going to miss his promise. He
[1:22:12] will have a bride that will take him at
[1:22:14] his word.
[1:22:16] Thank you, Lord. Amen. He's going to
[1:22:18] take She's going to take him at his
[1:22:20] word. Amen. I'm not talking about
[1:22:23] perfecting of the flesh. I'm talking
[1:22:25] about the maturity of the person. Amen.
[1:22:29] Amen. All
[1:22:35] right. Jesus said, "Both heavens and
[1:22:37] earth will pass away, but my word shall
[1:22:39] never pass." Don't put any private
[1:22:41] interpretation to it. He wants the pure,
[1:22:43] unadulterated, not even a
[1:22:46] flirt. Boy, the devil's good at that.
[1:22:49] Yeah, he'll move you somehow to get you
[1:22:51] to flirt contrary to the word.
[1:22:55] He'll bring it any way he can. You have
[1:22:57] one thing to
[1:23:00] do. Take God at his word.
[1:23:04] Amen. Don't I don't care anything that's
[1:23:07] contrary to that word. Leave it alone.
[1:23:10] It's your
[1:23:13] enemy. I would not want He wants a pure,
[1:23:16] unadulterated, not even a flirt. I
[1:23:18] wouldn't want my wife flirting with some
[1:23:20] other
[1:23:21] man, other
[1:23:24] vine. And when you go to listening to
[1:23:27] any kind of reasons beyond that word,
[1:23:32] you're listening. You're flirting with
[1:23:36] Satan. Amen. Don't it make you feel
[1:23:40] religious? God wants you to stay
[1:23:43] unadulterated. Stay right there with
[1:23:45] that word. Stay right with it. All
[1:23:49] right. Galatians
[1:23:52] 2:20 says
[1:23:54] this, "I am crucified with Christ.
[1:23:58] Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but
[1:24:01] Christ liveth in
[1:24:03] me. And the life which I now live in the
[1:24:07] flesh, I live by the
[1:24:10] faith of the Son of God, who loved me
[1:24:13] and gave himself for me." Philippians
[1:24:17] 1:20. I'm just reading these real quick
[1:24:19] here. I don't know. I don't have too
[1:24:21] much more time. Philippians 1:20 says,
[1:24:24] "According to my earnest expectation and
[1:24:27] my hope that in nothing I shall be
[1:24:30] ashamed, but that with all boldness, as
[1:24:33] always, so now also Christ shall be
[1:24:36] magnified in my body." Whose body? What
[1:24:40] is your
[1:24:41] body? His.
[1:24:45] whether it be by life or by death. For
[1:24:48] to me to live is
[1:24:52] Christ and to die is
[1:24:56] gain.
[1:24:58] Amen. She the coming back to the bride,
[1:25:02] I mean the Mary and also I say to the
[1:25:04] bride, she didn't question. She didn't
[1:25:07] reason. She just took God at his word
[1:25:10] and went along rejoicing. Don't
[1:25:13] question. If God said so, that settles
[1:25:16] it.
[1:25:18] That's all. That's that settles it. If
[1:25:21] God said so, that makes it right. Now,
[1:25:23] he's the final voice. Other words, the
[1:25:25] absolute, the amen, the ultimate. He's
[1:25:28] the final voice on all authority. He has
[1:25:32] all authority of everything. God has the
[1:25:35] supreme authority.
[1:25:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:41] But faith takes its eternal resting
[1:25:44] place upon the word of the Lord. Where
[1:25:47] does faith rest? Faith takes its resting
[1:25:49] place on the word of the Lord
[1:25:53] upon God's word which is the
[1:25:56] Bible. When a for faith now watch for
[1:26:00] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:26:02] for, the evidence of things not seen.
[1:26:05] So faith takes its resting place on the
[1:26:08] word. That faith is the substance. And
[1:26:11] when real faith When real faith takes a
[1:26:14] hold in the heart, it's not
[1:26:20] intellectual. When real faith takes a
[1:26:22] hold in the heart, it's not
[1:26:24] intellectual.
[1:26:27] It's not reason no more. It's real
[1:26:31] substance.
[1:26:33] It's the spirit of God witnessing
[1:26:35] through you. See, it's something you
[1:26:38] know. It's not something you hope. It's
[1:26:40] not something you imagine. It's what you
[1:26:42] know. It's a revelation.
[1:26:46] It's the spirit of God witnessing
[1:26:48] through you. God's word is true. It's
[1:26:52] the spirit of God witnessing through
[1:26:53] you. When real faith takes a hold in
[1:26:56] your heart, it's the spirit of God
[1:26:58] witnessing through you. It's not an
[1:27:01] intellectual. It's not reasoning, not
[1:27:03] figuring out anything. It's substance
[1:27:06] becomes real. You know it. It's the
[1:27:07] evidence of what he promised is yours.
[1:27:11] You'll go right on thanking him. It
[1:27:12] doesn't matter how long what it is, how
[1:27:15] many ifs and ants and and whatever may
[1:27:19] come up and how many disagree. You
[1:27:21] already have it.
[1:27:23] All right. So, that's all there is to
[1:27:26] it. That's God's
[1:27:29] word.
[1:27:31] Now, he said, "Witnessing through you,
[1:27:35] God's word is true. I'll I stay right
[1:27:37] with it. Yes, sir. And that brings the
[1:27:42] results. Faith finds the word. It's
[1:27:44] sanctuary of
[1:27:46] rest. That's right. Faith finds the
[1:27:49] word. I don't
[1:27:51] care. Look at the promise. Look at what
[1:27:54] God said. You'll say,
[1:27:57] "Amen." Faith will say,
[1:27:59] "Amen." It won't add. He said it moves
[1:28:02] right up to the top of that eternal
[1:28:04] rock. Christ Jesus the word lays down
[1:28:07] there and rests. Let the winds howl. Let
[1:28:09] the storm shake. She is safe ever more.
[1:28:12] She rests right there on that word.
[1:28:15] That's where faith, genuine Christian
[1:28:18] faith rests. You begin to believe God's
[1:28:20] word like that and you're going to be un
[1:28:22] misunderstood.
[1:28:25] You're going to be called all kinds of
[1:28:26] names
[1:28:28] because you're basing your faith on
[1:28:30] something you don't know how to explain.
[1:28:34] You're basing and I'm God said so and
[1:28:36] that settles it. You can't
[1:28:38] scientifically prove it. There's nothing
[1:28:40] you can feel about it. There's nothing.
[1:28:42] It's God said so. At your word, Lord, at
[1:28:46] your word.
[1:28:50] This is what God's expecting. This is
[1:28:53] what God will have. This is what God is
[1:28:56] looking for. the part of him to take him
[1:28:59] at his word.
[1:29:02] Completely submit yourself to the word.
[1:29:09] All right. Goes on to
[1:29:11] say, "That's where faith, genuine
[1:29:14] Christian faith rests is in the word.
[1:29:18] For it knows God
[1:29:20] will prove himself superior over every
[1:29:23] one of his enemies. No matter how bad it
[1:29:25] looks, how many enemies have come in,
[1:29:28] how look like you're defeated, faith
[1:29:30] still knows. There you are. Faith still
[1:29:32] knows. And you shall know the truth.
[1:29:36] Know
[1:29:37] it. And the truth will make you free.
[1:29:40] You shall know the truth.
[1:29:43] Isn't it nice? Feel how wonderful it is
[1:29:46] to know the truth. To have that revealed
[1:29:49] to you. It's just it's just not setting
[1:29:52] their letter. It's open to you. It's
[1:29:54] revealed to you. It's
[1:29:57] amen. No matter how bad it looks, see,
[1:30:00] faith still knows. Faith is already in
[1:30:03] looking out.
[1:30:06] Faith knows. Faith is already in looking
[1:30:08] out.
[1:30:12] Saying it's done. Saying it's done.
[1:30:15] Well, I don't see it done. How do you
[1:30:17] know it's done? I don't feel it. I don't
[1:30:19] I don't see it. I'm not focused on the
[1:30:22] things temporal, but on the
[1:30:26] eternal.
[1:30:28] See, that's faith. That's where faith
[1:30:30] takes its resting place. For it knows
[1:30:32] that God will never, never let the enemy
[1:30:34] ride over the top of him. He never has.
[1:30:38] Faith knows that. Faith is the substance
[1:30:41] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[1:30:43] things not seen. You can't reason. I
[1:30:46] can't prove how it'll be done. I don't
[1:30:48] know how it's going to be
[1:30:51] done. God said to Abraham, "Your wife
[1:30:53] Sarah shall have a
[1:30:55] son. I don't know how it's going to be
[1:30:57] done."
[1:30:59] You said it would be done. Take your son
[1:31:02] up there and kill it. I don't know why
[1:31:04] I've got to do that. God said to
[1:31:10] how many is willing to take him at his
[1:31:15] word you always and I'm just including
[1:31:18] every one of us we're human we're always
[1:31:20] wanting to put our reasoning into it
[1:31:22] that's Satan's doing he never said to do
[1:31:25] that he said take me at my word at my
[1:31:28] word. Look at Peter said you. Why Lord?
[1:31:32] He said cast your net for the drought.
[1:31:36] Why Lord? We fished all night. I'm a
[1:31:38] fisherman. I know there's no fish there.
[1:31:41] But but but
[1:31:44] he come to himself finally at thy word.
[1:31:48] I'll let down the net. And when he took
[1:31:50] him at his word, what happened? The word
[1:31:52] was manifested.
[1:31:54] Amen.
[1:31:56] How? What's going to happen when the
[1:31:57] word bride takes God in his
[1:32:00] word? You'll see Christ made manifest
[1:32:06] just as he said he would in this hour
[1:32:09] just as he promised he
[1:32:11] would. Amen.
[1:32:13] All
[1:32:15] right. Faith knows that faith is the
[1:32:18] substance. I don't know how it's going
[1:32:20] to be. I don't know it, but I believe
[1:32:21] it. I know it's so because God said so.
[1:32:25] That's
[1:32:29] settled. Matthew 26. I'm not too far
[1:32:33] from being finished here now. Matthew
[1:32:38] 26. We said at the beginning, it's
[1:32:40] either my will or his
[1:32:42] will. He's given us his will. His will
[1:32:45] is his word.
[1:32:51] We'll take verse 39. He went to the
[1:32:53] garden of
[1:33:00] Gethsemane. He took with him
[1:33:04] three
[1:33:09] witnesses. So the 39th verse, and he
[1:33:13] went a little further and fell on his
[1:33:14] face and prayed. Now he had a desire,
[1:33:17] brother, sister.
[1:33:19] He knew what he was
[1:33:20] facing. He had a desire. He did not want
[1:33:23] to leave his brethren. He had a desire
[1:33:25] to be with his brethren.
[1:33:29] And really the garden of Gethsemane is
[1:33:31] where victory was won. Right there.
[1:33:35] Where were you then?
[1:33:38] That's it. That's it.
[1:33:41] You won the victory right there in him.
[1:33:43] He got the victory for you. He had
[1:33:45] victory over his own desire. Yes. Amen.
[1:33:48] Oh God.
[1:33:52] And he went a little further and fell on
[1:33:54] his face and prayed, saying, "Oh my
[1:33:56] father, if it be possible, let this cup
[1:33:58] pass from
[1:34:00] me. Nevertheless, not as I
[1:34:03] will.
[1:34:06] Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou
[1:34:12] wilt." Then verse 43.
[1:34:17] Verse 42, excuse me. He went again the
[1:34:21] second time and prayed. Said, "Oh
[1:34:22] father, my father, if this cup may not
[1:34:26] pass away from me except I drink it, thy
[1:34:29] will be done."
[1:34:32] And he prayed the third time, saying the
[1:34:34] same
[1:34:37] words. in the
[1:34:39] garden. Would Jesus do what he wanted to
[1:34:42] do? His
[1:34:46] desire to stay with his brethren or what
[1:34:49] God wanted him to
[1:34:51] do. Now, you're faced with that every
[1:34:54] single day. We are faced with the same
[1:34:58] thing. We have an enemy and the
[1:35:01] battleground. You are the battleground
[1:35:03] right here.
[1:35:05] There's where the battle's fought.
[1:35:07] There's where the battles won or lost at
[1:35:11] that moment. I don't mean lost
[1:35:14] eternally. Amen. But what did Jesus say
[1:35:17] to
[1:35:18] do? He said to them all, "If any man
[1:35:21] will come after me, let him deny
[1:35:26] himself and take up his
[1:35:29] cross once a
[1:35:32] year. Daily.
[1:35:36] daily.
[1:35:40] We're fighting a battle and that battle
[1:35:42] is self.
[1:35:44] That battle is your own reasoning, your
[1:35:46] own feelings.
[1:35:48] You have a great enemy.
[1:35:50] I know who my enemy is. And it's not you
[1:35:54] all. It's not somebody else. It's not a
[1:35:56] denomination out here. It's this old man
[1:35:58] called David.
[1:36:00] That's my enemy. But what are we going
[1:36:03] to do with that enemy? Deny it. What are
[1:36:06] you going to do when you deny it? Take
[1:36:07] God at his word.
[1:36:12] All right. In the garden, his desire was
[1:36:15] to stay with his brethren. But he said,
[1:36:17] "Nevertheless, not my will." He
[1:36:19] surrendered to the will of his father
[1:36:21] and got victory over his
[1:36:24] desire. Then let him deny himself. If
[1:36:27] you want to come after me, follow me.
[1:36:29] Let him deny himself. Take up his cross
[1:36:31] daily and follow me. Not my will but
[1:36:36] thine. What is his will? His word. Then
[1:36:39] Lord at thy word.
[1:36:43] We're facing that every day. And it's
[1:36:44] getting the battle is getting hotter and
[1:36:46] heavier. Why? Because we're gaining more
[1:36:48] victory.
[1:36:50] Is that right? We're gaining We're
[1:36:52] coming to victory. Yeah. Total victory.
[1:36:54] Complete victory. A body change.
[1:36:58] Amen. And God won't take him until that
[1:37:01] bride will be a total committed
[1:37:04] bride surrendered to him. Amen. That's
[1:37:08] what he's looking for. All right. Now,
[1:37:11] God's looking Now, this I'm just coming
[1:37:14] right down here. God is looking for the
[1:37:16] other part of himself. That's his bride.
[1:37:19] God is looking for the other part of
[1:37:21] himself. His bride, his body, himself in
[1:37:25] another form. He's looking for that
[1:37:27] other part of himself to believe his
[1:37:30] word. If you want to know what God is
[1:37:32] looking for and expecting is for you to
[1:37:35] believe his word.
[1:37:39] Lay down
[1:37:41] yourself as he laid down himself for his
[1:37:44] wife and gave himself for it. And the
[1:37:46] wife, what'd she do? She submitted
[1:37:49] herself to the
[1:37:51] word. He submitted himself and gave
[1:37:54] himself up. Not for his desire. He laid
[1:37:57] down his own selfish desire, gave honor
[1:37:59] to the wife as a weaker vessel.
[1:38:02] Amen. He said, "My grace is sufficient
[1:38:05] for
[1:38:06] thee. For my strength is made perfect in
[1:38:11] weakness." Amen. All
[1:38:15] right. Amen. So he says here, God is
[1:38:20] looking for that part himself to believe
[1:38:21] his word. Will I will I have a bride
[1:38:25] that will surrender herself to me
[1:38:28] completely? God asking that question.
[1:38:30] Will I have a bride that will surrender
[1:38:33] herself to me
[1:38:36] completely? The answer is yes. And I'll
[1:38:40] come to that in just a moment as I close
[1:38:41] here.
[1:38:43] He is
[1:38:49] come in the form of his bride. Now, now
[1:38:53] watch. He said, "And he has no hands but
[1:38:57] ours, no eyes but ours, no ears but
[1:39:00] ours, no tongue but ours. So let let him
[1:39:04] have
[1:39:07] everything. Let's let him have
[1:39:09] everything." Amen. The secret of this is
[1:39:11] submitting yourself with godly love into
[1:39:14] the hands of a loving father andor
[1:39:17] husband and letting him take you over.
[1:39:21] That's
[1:39:23] all. Watch what is said here. Letting
[1:39:27] him take you over. That's all.
[1:39:31] See, I don't have to do anything else.
[1:39:32] No. Let him take you over. Amen. Submit
[1:39:37] yourself. Where can you look for any
[1:39:40] deliverance? God has only one provided
[1:39:44] way. Amen. It's not your It's not your
[1:39:48] good works. You can't do enough good
[1:39:50] works. It's for you to take God at his
[1:39:53] word. Surrendering yourself to the
[1:39:58] word. Will she or will I give myself to
[1:40:02] him in total
[1:40:04] surrender? What's it all coming down to?
[1:40:07] That's what it's all coming down to is
[1:40:09] this him having total headship and
[1:40:12] preeminence of me and you.
[1:40:16] It's what it's all coming down to
[1:40:19] is him having total preeminence over me
[1:40:23] and
[1:40:25] you. Oh, we want to get in the way and
[1:40:27] we find ourselves that's happening every
[1:40:29] day. But God, keep taking us through
[1:40:31] your filter. Keep bringing us through
[1:40:34] trials and tests. We're learning the
[1:40:36] character. He learned obedience by the
[1:40:39] things he had to suffer. Obedient to
[1:40:41] what? The
[1:40:44] word. How are we going to come any other
[1:40:46] way? Amen. So, let's let's from right
[1:40:51] here tonight fully, completely say,
[1:40:53] "Lord, I give over to you." We've said
[1:40:55] it. We've said it over and over again.
[1:40:57] Amen.
[1:40:59] Amen.
[1:41:01] Let it come to it. I had it place. Yeah.
[1:41:05] Where I am totally Lord. These are your
[1:41:08] hands. These are your eyes, your ears,
[1:41:10] your face, your mouth, your spirit.
[1:41:15] Everything at your word, Lord. At your
[1:41:18] word. You do what you want to do.
[1:41:21] Whether I understand what you're doing
[1:41:22] or not. I don't have to know whether I
[1:41:24] understand. I'm going to follow you.
[1:41:26] You're leading me and I'm submitting
[1:41:28] myself to you. You do the leading. I'll
[1:41:31] just follow. Amen.
[1:41:34] How's he leading us? By the
[1:41:43] word. Will I find faith? He said in Luke
[1:41:45] 18:8, "Will I find faith when I
[1:41:50] come?" The
[1:41:52] church in Christ's mystery God revealed.
[1:41:55] The church is the blood of
[1:41:57] Christ. What is that blood of Christ?
[1:42:00] Perfect blood, royal blood.
[1:42:04] Is that right? The church is the blood
[1:42:07] of Christ by the spirit because the life
[1:42:10] is in the blood. The baptism of the Holy
[1:42:13] Ghost by that spirit that baptizes us
[1:42:16] into his body that recognizes only his
[1:42:19] body. What's his
[1:42:21] body? It's a
[1:42:23] revelation. She knows
[1:42:25] it. It's a revelation. She knows it.
[1:42:30] Eve So did Eve know it. But she fell.
[1:42:34] But this one, now I'm telling you, will
[1:42:36] I find
[1:42:38] faith? Will I have a bride surrender to
[1:42:40] me completely? Watch your
[1:42:47] answer. This one, the bride, the bride
[1:42:50] knows it and won't
[1:42:52] fall. She's ordained. Hallelujah.
[1:42:56] Brother Bam said she is ordained not to
[1:43:00] fall. She won't fail. She is
[1:43:04] predestinated to it. So
[1:43:09] Lord, take me through your
[1:43:12] word. Take me through your
[1:43:15] filter. Take out everything that's
[1:43:17] unlike
[1:43:19] you. I want to come to that complete
[1:43:23] dependency. I don't care how unusual. I
[1:43:26] don't care how radical it is. care how
[1:43:29] un unreasonable it looks. When I know
[1:43:33] that he's my head and I've given it to
[1:43:35] him, what difference does it make? He's
[1:43:38] leading me. He has
[1:43:45] preeminence. Now watch this. Faith that
[1:43:48] we are living by is not a faith but a
[1:43:53] perfect faith. And so a perfect faith
[1:43:58] built up in here in the soul. Watch a
[1:44:00] perfect God with a perfect heart keep a
[1:44:04] perfect
[1:44:06] promise by his perfect word which is
[1:44:10] sharper than a two-edged sword and a
[1:44:12] discerner of the thoughts of the
[1:44:15] heart.
[1:44:16] What? We're coming now to the
[1:44:19] perfection. That perfection is maturity.
[1:44:21] We're coming now to perfection because
[1:44:25] the people has got to come to this in
[1:44:28] order for the
[1:44:30] rapture. It means a lot of shaving down
[1:44:34] for
[1:44:35] me. It means a lot for
[1:44:38] you. But together we'll make it by the
[1:44:42] grace of
[1:44:43] God.
[1:44:45] Amen. There you go.
[1:44:49] Let's take God at his word.
[1:44:55] Yeah, you're in a battle. I'm in a
[1:44:57] battle. But the battle is the
[1:45:01] Lord's. Let's give it to him. Let's deny
[1:45:04] yourself. Give him preeminence. Give him
[1:45:09] place. Giving him his rightful
[1:45:12] place over his body.
[1:45:16] Yes, he has a bride that is taking him
[1:45:21] at his word. I believe that with all my
[1:45:23] heart. And she's coming further and
[1:45:26] further, very close to maturity
[1:45:29] now. So be it unto me according to thy
[1:45:37] word. Are you one of them?
[1:45:42] Amen. Amen.
[1:45:46] Amen. Let's bow our
[1:45:51] heads. Heavenly
[1:45:54] Father, thou know us this little
[1:45:57] message, Lord.
[1:46:00] And maybe I didn't do just exactly
[1:46:03] justice to it, but Lord, I believe it. I
[1:46:07] just expect you to take what
[1:46:10] was in your heart have given through me
[1:46:14] that hath thy
[1:46:18] word. So be it unto me according to thy
[1:46:25] word for me to live as
[1:46:29] Christ. That's my heart's desire. That's
[1:46:32] my ambition. I'm not stopping. I don't
[1:46:35] want to stop. I don't want to get slow.
[1:46:37] I don't want to come to a standstill.
[1:46:40] Lord, let me complete and fulfill
[1:46:42] everything that you purposed for me to
[1:46:47] do. Your word is my
[1:46:49] absolute. Your
[1:46:52] word is my
[1:46:56] amen. Forgive me and forgive us for
[1:46:59] we've for where we've reasoned
[1:47:03] compromised with the word.
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:08] Lord, let us realize your word is
[1:47:12] pure. Help us,
[1:47:15] Lord. At thy word, Lord. At thy
[1:47:20] word, what you've whatever you have
[1:47:23] called me to do, what you want me to
[1:47:25] feed on, where you want me to go, at thy
[1:47:28] word you said you'd lead me. He that is
[1:47:30] faithful is he that called you, who also
[1:47:32] will do it.
[1:47:34] And he that began a good work in you
[1:47:37] will have finished it. Then Lord at thy
[1:47:41] [Music]
[1:47:42] word. Oh father let it go deep in the
[1:47:45] heart of the people. I commit this to
[1:47:49] you in the name of the Lord Jesus for
[1:47:52] your glory.
[1:47:57] Amen.
[1:47:59] Amen. Let's sing that song again. And
[1:48:02] I'm one of the
[1:48:03] few. Are you one of the
[1:48:07] few? There's just a few that are going
[1:48:10] to take God at his word. All the word.
[1:48:13] Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:48:15] by every word that proceedth out of the
[1:48:18] mouth of
[1:48:19] God. Oh, I'm one of the
[1:48:23] few. One of the few. And by faith in
[1:48:28] God's word, I can claim
[1:48:32] it. Though the way may seem long, all
[1:48:36] the opposition strong for the bride,
[1:48:40] there's a way
[1:48:44] provided. If I plan to go through, just
[1:48:48] to hope will not do, I must be firmly
[1:48:56] decided to follow the Lord by obeying
[1:49:02] his word and believe that I'm one of the
[1:49:08] few. You know what, brother, sister?
[1:49:11] We've got to be firmly decided. Are you
[1:49:14] firmly decided to go all the way? Are we
[1:49:17] firmly decided to run the race
[1:49:21] the way he said to run it at thy word,
[1:49:23] Lord? Are we determined
[1:49:26] to not quit?
[1:49:28] No matter where the pressure, how much
[1:49:30] pressure there is. We're not going to
[1:49:32] quit. We're going all the way in. Amen.
[1:49:36] How are we going to do
[1:49:37] that? By faith in his word.
[1:49:40] I am one of the few. One of the few. And
[1:49:47] by faith in God's word, I can claim
[1:49:51] it. Though the way may seem long, though
[1:49:56] the opposition strong, for the bride,
[1:50:00] there's a way.
[1:50:03] provided if I plan to go through just to
[1:50:09] hope will not do I must be firmly
[1:50:16] decided to follow the Lord by obeying
[1:50:22] his word and believe I am one of the
[1:50:28] few. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:32] Amen. Let's keep
[1:50:35] pressing. Press the battle. How? The
[1:50:38] word's given us the victory. So why not
[1:50:41] press
[1:50:42] it? Press on, right? Press on. Walk with
[1:50:47] God. Amen. You know the Bible said, "If
[1:50:50] I if we live in the spirit, we'll not
[1:50:52] fulfill the lust of the flesh. But if we
[1:50:56] live in the spirit, let us also
[1:50:58] walk in the spirit." Paul said in the
[1:51:02] 25th verse, "If we live in the spirit,
[1:51:04] let us also be in action with the word.
[1:51:07] Take God at his word. Stand on it. Go to
[1:51:11] acting by what you believe. You'll get
[1:51:15] what you believe." Isn't that wonderful?
[1:51:18] You'll get what you believe. That's
[1:51:20] right.
[1:51:21] If you want to believe your senses,
[1:51:23] you'll get them. You'll get the what
[1:51:25] your senses
[1:51:26] believe. Hello. But if you believe the
[1:51:29] word, you're going to get what the word
[1:51:33] says. Amen. Amen. I want to sing one
[1:51:37] more song. The move is on. Do you
[1:51:39] believe the move is on today for the
[1:51:41] bride? Brother Brandham said, "It's thus
[1:51:43] sayeth the Lord. The move is on." He
[1:51:45] said, "So, let's move up. We're not
[1:51:48] going to settle down." I mean, Brother
[1:51:50] Jason preached a message. I didn't I
[1:51:53] haven't heard it yet. I wasn't there
[1:51:55] because Diane was taken to the hospital.
[1:51:57] an emergency and she's fine. God healed
[1:52:00] her. That's right. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:52:04] That's exactly what he did. They
[1:52:06] couldn't find a thing wrong with her.
[1:52:09] And it just God just took care of it.
[1:52:12] Yeah. Amen. And we just we just realized
[1:52:15] kind of what it was. They didn't say
[1:52:16] what it was, but realized it probably a
[1:52:19] rib out of place and and extreme pain.
[1:52:22] So, we just called on Satan to leave the
[1:52:24] rib. And he did. left that joint right
[1:52:28] there. Amen. God's
[1:52:31] good. Amen. But he said the move is on.
[1:52:34] So let's move onward. Walk with God. And
[1:52:37] move while we're moving, what did what
[1:52:39] did Enoch do? He stepped a little
[1:52:41] higher. Was a little higher. How'd he do
[1:52:44] that? He walked with God. He walked with
[1:52:46] the word. The move is Oh, wait. The move
[1:52:51] is on, my Lord. The move is on.
[1:52:56] The move is on, my lord, the move is
[1:53:01] on. Oh, I can hear the rustle in the
[1:53:06] mberry trees. And I know, I know, I know
[1:53:11] the move is on. And do you know
[1:53:14] that? Move on,
[1:53:17] brother. Move on,
[1:53:20] sister. This is the moving day. This is
[1:53:25] the bride day. Sea time. Move a little
[1:53:29] closer where the streams are
[1:53:32] flowing. Move on, brother. Move
[1:53:37] on. The move is on. My Lord, the move is
[1:53:43] on. Move is on, my lord. The move is on.
[1:53:50] Well, I can hear the rustle in the
[1:53:54] mberry trees and I know I know I know
[1:53:59] the move is on. Do you believe that? Do
[1:54:02] you believe that tonight? Do you know?
[1:54:05] Do you know? Do you know the move is
[1:54:09] on? Let's move up
[1:54:12] then. Let's not stand still. You can't
[1:54:14] be still. You're either moving forward
[1:54:17] or you're going back. That's right.
[1:54:19] Amen.
[1:54:20] Amen. The only thing you stand still for
[1:54:23] is take God at his word and then be
[1:54:25] still. Amen. But when you do that,
[1:54:27] you're moving.
[1:54:29] Amen. Amen. God bless
[1:54:32] you. Let's
[1:54:34] expect Let's not Let's not live for God
[1:54:36] on a Wednesday, Sundays,
[1:54:38] okay? Let's live for God every day.
[1:54:41] Let's take his word every day.
[1:54:45] Amen. And let him prepare. Let's let's
[1:54:48] get in the spirit on the Lord's day. Oh,
[1:54:50] by the
[1:54:51] way, man's day is passed. That's right.
[1:54:56] Brother Brandham said, "Lennial age was
[1:54:58] man's day." Amen. But we're not We have
[1:55:01] come out of Leodysia. The bride's come
[1:55:04] out. We're not in man's day. We're in
[1:55:07] the day of the
[1:55:09] Lord. This is the Lord's day. John was
[1:55:12] in the spirit on the Lord's day.
[1:55:16] Amen. Amen. Amen. So, let's go higher.
[1:55:21] Let's continue to walk with God. God
[1:55:22] bless you. You can be dismissed.
