we call me your friend lord not only that it took us the next step call this your bride lord what an honor lord we just this morning lay ourselves at your feet lord though we want to just soak in the blessings that you have for us father lord the word that you have for us father lord this morning there are different ones here with needs in their heart each one has come with something father god and i just pray as we're speaking to you lord that hand may be raised father you would just come and just meet each and every one lord in a special way lord maybe a special way that they would understand father lord god you know each and every one of us you know each and every one of our heart and brother david dean heart gave me a note i said we pray for uh wayne and margie montana dean hart as their visit listening on online but sister margie has a co-worker who has cancer in her lungs and they're just asking that we would just remember them in prayer father this individual this co-worker lord there's nothing too small nothing too great father that you cannot do and lord may this just be an opportunity father that you would be glorified lord may this be an opportunity that something would be said that a little life would be changed lord no matter which direction whatever your promises for this individual father god lord in all things may you be glorified may you be honored lord jesus we come against this devil of cancer saying you have no right in this individual lord we just ask that you come now and just fill her full of yourself lord god lord may your healing attributes come and touch your we ask lord we pray this morning for the word brother paul would come and speak to us lord no we prayed in the back study father i just pray lord that you would just anoint him father may the words that come out lord be your words be your thoughts lord that you would speak directly to our hearts lord father and we pray for brother alex once again as he'd be interpreting father give him the right words lord those that would be speaking in a different la listening in a different language would just hear directly from the throne of grace lord we give you honor we give you glory commit ourselves to you in your name we pray name our lord jesus christ amen amen you may have your seeds [Music] hallelujah praise the lord has it been good to you amen amen came across this little song we haven't sung in a what little while number 1266 how beautiful heaven must be amen as we get ready to turn the service over to our pastor we of a place that's called heaven [Music] it's made for the pure and [Music] [Applause] [Music] he has given [Music] [Music] forever [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] how beautiful heaven [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] loves me of the happy and free [Music] heaven must be [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] must be hallelujah you know the prophet of god talks about a foretaste and when we look at this life that we live in many of you if you were asked to think of something beautiful a place you would have somewhere that your mind might go to an early morning mist in the grand canyon or into the sawtooths or wherever it might be there'll be something special to you that you say most beautiful place i've ever been and the prophet of god said that at its best is only a foretaste oh how beautiful beautiful amen let's just continue to remember brother bob and sister joanne i i feel bad i keep saying i'm going to go see them and then just pray for me i keep having these reoccurring i don't know what you would say kind of head cold or something of that nature you know i just don't want to go uh you know share that with them i don't mind sharing it with you i i don't want to so just keep lifting them up in prayer and i think we forgot to share this this morning or it wasn't uh notified brother chris and sister kristen have just slipped away uh to to relax just a little bit for one night they had accommodations i think uh up in the mountains somewhere and so just remember them we want the lord just to heal sister kristen's foot quickly amen i can't hardly imagine uh well i can't imagine i've done that before similar so it you know any of you that's ever hurt your foot or whatever you just everything you do it's just a hindrance to you so let's lift them up amen and uh you know i i i was just thinking this morning uh how happy i am you know i look downstairs and and uh the lord just putting all these things together brothers are working hard and and you know we have water fountain downstairs now we have bathrooms downstairs and and i was joking with the brothers pretty soon on the counter down there we're gonna have one of sister sarah's apple pies and um you know it's just going to be lovely to you know be able to use that and the brothers are working uh come down in the evening and you see uh brother ivan brother vasily uh different brothers brother adam yesterday brother adam was our taskmaster and uh if he was to walk through the downstairs there's a tremendous amount of work accomplished yesterday and i say god bless you to the brothers and their efforts yesterday and some of the sisters have said what can we do right after we have finished making messes sisters we will give you your opportunity to make it all look nice and tidy and so we thank the lord for that and just remember brother sergey somewhere between here in texas probably very close to texas uh just um praying that the lord allows him to be home spend this holiday season with his family brother manasseh god bless you home for the holidays amen and uh does my heart good to see you let's not forget on january the 2nd communion at 5 pm and brother prashant and sister concho will be coming up uh for this holiday season and uh very happy because um you know saints i i don't know about you but i haven't let go of them yet amen we still claim them as ours as a part of this assembly amen so you know um i know brother croissant's heart and i i won't go ahead and speak those things out but i know their heart longs to be here with you and uh so let's just keep them in prayer uh in a constant measure give thanks to the lord once again uh many many needs across the united states and we're seeing god answer those prayers one after another amen and uh you know to just see one one example my brothers and sisters is uh uh if i understand what i've heard you know brother ron uh peterson just had a minor blockage but yet he had this tremendous chest pain and um he went and they have been able you know they dealt with that long before it would be as we would consider a critical thing and so isn't that beautiful the lord sometimes gives us all a shake if you remember it was like he's in cardiac arrest and and uh you know you're just like oh my oh my oh my and you pray with a fervency and then you know that wasn't necessarily as it were accurate but the fervency part on our part was good was it not amen sometimes the lord just knows that maybe somebody misunderstands the terms but yet look at our own reaction do we just slough it off and say oh i hope he lives through it no the body of believers coming together in unity binds its faith together with a fervency with an urgency and then moves forward on that believing amen not any of this stuff when you hear a minister say comments like aren't we lucky to be christians no luck involves saints no luck involved god said i chose you in fact i chose you so long ago you can't even comprehend it and then i chose you so long ago that i built a whole plan of redemption around redeeming you wow you see do you get this saints god didn't have a plan of redemption and then choose the people god chose the people and then built the plan of redemption to bring those people in oh thank you lord hallelujah you know let me liken this this morning sometimes um you know we've done it around our house a time or two so i don't mean it you know ill or but isn't interesting you go to the store and um you're in target or you're in hobby lobby or you're whatever and they have all these things on sale and you buy that looking for the person someday you'll give it to i see some guilty looks but you see christ gave the gift specifically isn't that beautiful stirs my heart amen oh praise the lord now i'm not telling you don't buy gifts and give them in a general sense um well i'll just not the brothers are reminding me um this next wednesday uh will be canceled because we are going to tear apart more things which includes the whole sound system here at the church okay okay okay well it does actually say you know they can talk to me i just don't listen very well december 29th okay we want to warn you well in advance this next wednesday there's church amen the 29th where we won't have service on that wednesday because we're we need to disassemble some stuff and then give brother isaac and and brother alex those that do the sound stuff and brother ivan also time to put this back together correctly without some hurried deal and that's sometimes been what our problem has been is we have we have replaced and put parts in and done this and that and we always have to have it ready for something the next day or two so we just give the brothers some time and so let's stand and go into the word today amen and uh you know it's just a beautiful i pray today saints and pray with me that i'll be able to share this in how it spoke to me and not to say that how it spoke to me is the only way it can be spoken but it came with inspiration it came with anointing it came with something that touched my heart and and you know when that when that anointing or that presence is there sister jerry was playing some music of a sister from australia and uh you know as the sister is singing there on that uh cd you know i i'm just setting i don't know sister jerry noticed i actually hoped she didn't in one sense but just driving down the road my heart so melted i was just crying what sin what's sick are you talking about it's so far down in the sea of god's forgetfulness amen that he won't even bring it up oh thank you thank you thank you i want to speak to you this morning on being edified by the word amen let's turn in our bibles to ii corinthians the 10th chapter we'll read the first eight verses and just lay out a little a little uh uh thought as the lord laid on my heart and i have to tell you saints that um i had to try really hard to not just branch off into 42 different topics because that's what this this thought this word here when you start digging into it you'll find that it is connected so completely and as a brother once said he said this word is connected so completely complete enough to cover the whole earth in the blood of jesus christ that's how complete the word is and i say thank you lord because you see we tend to get kind of narrow in our thinking the message come to a prophet that god brought out of the united states of america and we tend to have certain advantages because it was preached in english and it's right here and it's readily available and we kind of then tend to look now don't misunderstand me no one but we tend to look okay we got to help those in africa we got to help them in asia we've got to help them in south america we've got to help them but but we forget that the same holy ghost that spoke to the prophet here in america is speaking all over this earth an anointed word has been given to the whole earth amen so you will find if we could ever tap into this and i wouldn't bother to try but you will find saints that as the word is being preached you will be able to connect and know that a brother here a brother here ministry amen and saints listening to the word of god and reading their bible all over the earth it's the same holy ghost amen the same god that was here yesterday is going to speak to you today and he will walk with you and speak to you tomorrow amen what do we have to worry about what do we have to worry about hallelujah now remember the prophet see this is some of the struggles i'll just get this over with real quick and then maybe i can focus the prophet of god speaking and he's making this that god did not come because he had to he came because he promised now why would he make a promise to a people that he didn't plan on redeeming amen so remember you're sitting here this morning to hear words of promise [Music] come on so don't stay here and say well i hope brother paul has something good this morning sat here this morning and say god promised to be here and speak to me and i i'm going to stand and you know as it were the prophet of god speaks some pretty strong words saying you know look god would not be god if he does not honor his own word and then we have no obligation to serve him but he keeps his word oh hallelujah ii corinthians now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am based among you but being absent embold toward you but i beseech you so this is two urgent pleas that's what beseeching is it's an urgent plea two in a row but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are we here amen paul wasn't saying the weapons of my warfare the word our used in this context is plural and conclusive for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now look my brother said oh yep stay on track paul do he look on things after the outward appearance if any man trusts to himself that he is christ let him of himself think this again that as he is christ even so are we christ for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction i should not be ashamed heavenly father we ask the lord for you leadership father you know our hearts cry to you today and father we just ask you to come and speak to your people may we walk from this building today lord but not from your presence able to say in our hearts and with our lips it was good to be in the house of god father for every need lord that was not shared the unspoken father just asked you to move lord i ask you to move right down into the very depths lord for husbands and wives and for children and for those father of our family and those that are not our family but are close lord just ask you to touch hearts move forward father for your word has promised and it is coming to pass we thank you for the opportunity to serve you and lord as we read in the scripture lord may we serve you with joy and with thanksgiving lord may the fruit of our lips be praised unto you father not complaints lord not beseeching you father for what we see is wrong but lord beseeching you for what we know is right and we give praise to you today and ask for your guidance in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may be seated saints you know as we look at this this word beseech kind of touches me in such a sense i've had a few occasions in my life and i have shared them from this pulpit but it's interesting saints how certain things will happen in your life that cause you unconsciously to cry out it's not a thought like i should cry out to the lord right now but it is something that happens of such a nature that you cry out from the depths and you know many years ago my older brother and i in a pickup on icy roads i've shared the story with you the pickup literally runs off the edge of pretty close about as close as you can get to being a cliff and um you know stops at the pickup the lord does with a rock a rock that falls into the ravine or canyon whatever you want to call it after the pickup is pulled back up and you know saints this is uh you might say a landmark moment in my life because i can look back and uh we live in a world that cursing is seemingly on the tip of humanity's tongue but in a moment like that who you are what you are what is deep inside of you comes out and you find yourself beseeching crying out urgently lord help us and you know i would pray that we could make that something that was more of a first nature than a second nature to us that our reaction of life day to day would be to cry out to the lord you say well brother paul you mean when we have troubles no i mean when you're just living when you are just walking through life day to day lord help us to learn to cry out to you so as i enter into my thought i pray ask for your prayers now paul is there beseeching them in meekness and the gentleness of christ and you know it's very interesting because brother branham shows us now how the contrasting nature that people were looking and brother brown talks about the kind o priest now they're comparing jesus christ as he is there in their midst and they're comparing his life to the kind old priest and you honestly can't blame the people for looking at the kind of priest and feeling more kindred spirit to him than they did to jesus christ because he is there plattered a rope and is whipping them in the temple and their kind old priest was the one whose brother brown says paid their doctor bill help them pay the rent all these kind of things but my brother and sister there is a certain nature that is not as it were totally revealed to the world now if you understand what i'm saying there's a nature of jesus christ that this world out here will never recognize because those that have entered in in the spirit come into that atmosphere and i don't believe there should not be one in this church today that would say that they do not know the meekness and gentleness of christ amen because he's actually even in this world that we live in all the difficulties and struggles he comes with a tender hand in the midnight hour during the day whatever the circumstances are alive and he actually treats us you will not see the spirit of christ abusing his bride nor will you see the spirit of christ which is supposed to be on the ministry abusing the bride if they say they have the nature of god so it's there that we understand that the meekness and gentlemen of christ is not necessarily according as we see it in the flesh in the flesh we say well everyone ought to just love everyone and we're going to overlook each other's faults my brother and sister it's good to overlook each other's faults as we joke the other day about giving a pass but my brother and sister the word also talks about going to a brother to restore them and so we see that we don't want to get confused in these things right because the lord will correct us and we ought to say thank you lord thank you lord for correction amen so it's there that we see what is happening now through the word and uh you know it it is moving us it's uh coming and and paul says you know uh i i i want to come to you in the pride right or correct or proper fashion paul didn't come and debase himself my brother and sister just simply to debase himself when he said i come humbly or i come lowly before you what he was talking was he's not going to come as it was as a charging bull into the midst and bowl everybody but as he also spoke he said i am all things and to all people so that means we see that paul come and where he might correct one in such a fashion he would come over as it were and give compassion to another and we'd say but they have the same issue but do you realize none of us have exactly the same issue because one has this complex and one has that complex and one has there's all these mitigating factors and christ comes and you will see it in the preaching of the word sometimes the holy spirit comes down almost as a demanding task master and speaks to spirit and says depart i cast you out and in others you'll find the prophet of god imploring the holy spirit to come and move amen you see because of the nature of the individual god knew just exactly how to come in there and we'll see that you know we look back and why they were there in those days and they traveled in sailing ships and they walked a lot and you know had a donkey and a cart and all these things my brother and sister but as we look at verse two you'll see as he beseeches them again that uh i i want to come i want to come with a correct conscience i'm just going to preach this to you i'm going to come with a correct uh conscience uh to to approach you and to discern your need and to be able to present jesus christ to you with confidence but i'm not going to come in and be bold where i should be humble and be humble where i should be bold and my brother and sister that takes the leadership of the holy ghost amen that takes something within the man to be able to be moved or as it were controlled by the spirit of god to give compassion where compassion was necessary and to come with force where force is necessary and so paul is coming and speaking to them in this fashion and and you know he said uh i'm going to come and i'm going to come and be bold against some oh look how this works my brother and sister everybody wants everybody i'm telling you we're coming to a day the scripture says that those things done in secret will be made open amen there's coming a day that sin will not be able to sit in the church but the holy ghost will come and we'll heat it up so hot it will either be refined or cast out oh my brother and sister now don't misunderstand this the prophet of god said those two spirits would be in the church to the very end so my brother and sister just because a body is sitting on a pew doesn't mean that they are a bride member and it does not mean they have been cast out or you know you understand what i'm saying it is there you don't discern that the two are there until the harvest that's right but look at this now he says i think to be bold against some sound sounds very very selective does it not but look what follows that which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh now saints i'm not asking this for an acknowledgement to me or the ministry here but has the word ever come and cut you to the quick yes amen wouldn't have been nice if the lord would have just sent you an email and made a suggestion but that's not how it works right but you see by your acknowledgement and i just for example by your acknowledgement you see it's there that something has come and moved upon you but look even in paul's day there were those people in the middle that said oh he preached on this he meant that at me he's picking on me he's got a grudge against me and paul's dealing with this which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh now i want you to hold that thought because it will tie together as we move further down my brother and sister i would trust as we come here today that we would all come knowing who we are sinners safe by grace amen by the grace of almighty god are we able to respond to the word did you know it takes a measure of grace to repent from unbelief that is the grace of god that would anoint us to be able to look at the air in our own life and say i am wrong and repent because he we live in a day where the scripture says that the people would become hardened they would become hardened in their own hearts and so as we see the apostle paul is looking at and there were people in that day that that really actually thought that paul was just dealing in the flesh and and you know trying to discount the moving of the holy spirit they they were not moved they they did not recognize the presence of god and the purpose of the moving of the holy spirit now we go back in the old testament my brother and sister and you do not see the holy ghost as it were words uh spread out through the old testament as we do in the new testament but it's the same god same spirit amen just because the vocabulary of that original covenant was not the same as the covenant to us so it's not expressed in that same fashion because the covenant was of you'll see this now the covenant was of the flesh to israel and it is of the spirit to us so israel's always looked in the flesh as it were to prophets and looking for a messiah and do and now here in our generation the prophet of god says now god is moving no longer in the flesh oh i hope you can dig deep on this because this is a problem when we started dealing in the flesh that's where spirits of idolatry creep in because we're looking at the flesh well people while they did this for the prophets and they did that for the prophets and and it was accounted to them well my brother and sister are those that were good to brother branham god's going to give them a reward but you see god said i'm moving you into the spirit so if you're going to raise up something to worship raise up the spirit of god amen raise up the holy ghost and say thank you lord for saving my soul and bless those lord that have labored for us in our midst and you know see that same spirit of trying to discount the moving of the holy spirit has been around since the very beginning and so you look at that nothing's ever changed you see what happens saints now look if i have to preach on something today that might just touch your life just take these original scriptures that we're not here to walk according to the flesh a pastor is highly overrated and highly underrated depends on which side you're looking at but that spirit to turn everything carnal is still here amen amen you know we had a lovely moving of the holy spirit here in the church here a few services ago well it's been in many services but one that struck me in particular you know saints it you can be here and you can recognize the moving of the holy spirit and satan will come in and throw out one little thing to draw your attention away we're sitting right here god's present in our midst yes can we say amen we've been having good services brother chris brother david you know we've been having good services saints and satan's still there throwing the pebbles trying to distract and disturb and to bring up you know i can say this in in a bit of humor years ago my lovely wife looked me in the face and says you know paul i'm going to serve god no matter what you do it cut me very deep in my heart but it was the truth my brother and sister at this stage of my life i went to church i i worked for a ranch and and they wanted me i had to work i had to take care of cattle every other weekend and and sometimes i found excuse not to go at all during a month or whatever and my wife loaded up our our children and drug them off to church faithfully mothers now my heart is with you when circumstances are such but mothers if you find yourself struggling to go to church on wednesday or sunday because you've got so many kids the solution is not to stay home the solution is to pray that god gives you strength that you'll teach those children that going to church is priority nowhere will you find that streaming is our priority the word says take them to church and attend it ourself remember what brother brown says don't you deliver your children to sunday school you take them see the answer is prayer brothers now i understand circumstances nobody misunderstood me i understand circumstances but brothers i've been there before where you work 80 or 90 hours a week and you say i'm too tired to go to church but you get down and pray and say lord i need to be in the house of god i need it myself personally lord i need this as a minister it's easy to say i'm too tired i'll get someone else god lays something on your heart don't don't succumb to that i'm too tired thing get down and pray lord you promised you poured strength into david amen i'm going to claim that same promise lord and pour strength into me and get up and go do it and you will go to church and you'll say well i stayed up too late but my brother and sister under the anointing of your prayer that god heard right you are crying out you're drawing night unto god and crying out to him and he said i heard your heart and i answered your prayer that's taken loosely from the book of psalms and it is there what is it my brother and sister you ask for strength he'll give you strength but you never exercise that and you'll never experience it and people say i'm just simply can't do that that's because you never exercised it hallelujah amen you see so it's there spirits trying to turn everything carnal and he said in the third verse he says oh we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh you see my brother and sister i'm going to preach loosely because you're message believers we are here today with message believers amen now my brother and sister you look at that and you see how that it is that the prophet of god said this bride of this day she would come to a place that she would be able to discern the spirits think about this people concerned it's going to be so close to deceive the very elect there's a gray zone for you to be deceived what did i forget if it were amen possible but you see satan comes and he he has white it out and so it's all oh we could be no saints we can stand here this morning in complete confidence i cannot be deceived amen and we got a lot more to worry about if you don't have confidence in that word than you do about that possibility of the if right amen because if you are not sealed until the day of your redemption we have an option here today to get sealed that's the issue my brother and sister not the power of satan satan's power has been bound by the word i preached this to you before i'll remind you again that when god gave permission to satan and opened the hedge of job and said you can do whatever you want to him but you can't take his life you realize saints god put a hedge around the devil he opened the heads to job but he put a hedge around the devil and put a limitation of what satan could do to joke i'll tell you what we might suffer illness we might suffer poverty and be cold as that song says i never promised that you wouldn't be oh how do those words go yes yeah i never promised that that wouldn't be but he did promise that satan can't take your life your life is sealed in christ until the day of your redemption oh hallelujah you see satan he like you to believe that there's possibilities but my brother and sister it's the devil's interpretation of the if amen but we're here to declare all things are possible in christ jesus and he said i have sealed you till the day of your redemption oh hallelujah you see so true believer this is what's coming down in our day my brother and sister now that doesn't mean that we haven't befriended someone and they turn out not to really be like as it were a true friend there's certain things that god just binds us from like i just ask you why would the prophet of god in some of these people that he rubs soldiers with why would the prophet of god you might say be and these are the words of the unbeliever oblivious well i'm sure glad my brother and sister that we are oblivious to some things now i'll give you an example i'm getting off my this is this branch number one here but my brother and sister remember when the prophet of god goes to mr walker and he's there and this one man here true man of god but this other man had children with another woman and he was he was now imagine now you walked around your whole life and that was you realize how weary you would become that everyone you looked at you just know everything about them you see god knew he had to spare his prophet so there's certain things and people don't comprehend this but you just think about that if every bit of unbelief and every sin that would so easily be said people had been revealed to the prophet he would have moved to the wilderness and would have become a hermit because he would have been overwhelmed so god veiled some of that and people say well why didn't he know this and why didn't he know that because god chose to veil it wasn't had nothing to do with william branham it was god failing at saints and there's parts of this message that are you might say being opened up nuggets that are being dug up and people say well where i've had this happen personally people are like where did brother branham say that i can't find that well imagine my brother and sister if the prophet of god in 33 years of ministry had tried to preach this whole bible okay saints we'll meet back here in 30 minutes for our fourth service of the day and then he is a man with a burnt out see god gave us a shovel spiritual shovel called revelation and we can dig the nuggets right out of this because do you know if you study the message and i don't want to sound like presumptuous here but if you study the message and you pray that there are certain signs that have been laid out that says you know kind of like the old timers maps you know go up to such and such correct trail and if the water falls at 10 am look across the point of the rock and below that and a hundred yards to the west well if you just blundered up the trail you'll never find it but if you followed it well how are we going to find it you're going to dig in the word for it no your pastor or some evangelist is not going to come and hand you a map you're going to dig for it and when you have dug for it you will find it hallelujah okay i'll get back on track that was the other branch of the service amen so a true believer is able to separate the spirits now you see my brother and sister if we are going to preach from the flesh then what we will do is closely analyze your lives we will watch you and we will see every little thing that you do wrong and what we'll do also is we will develop a network of spies come on i've been in churches that did that and then because we have the information that you were out at the blah blah with so and so we can preach about that that's in the flesh but you know that kind of preaching never changed a single individual see we have to recognize the difference between condemnation and conviction and condemnation can actually be cranked down so tight that people will conform to it i don't want you to ever ever owe saints i pray i never preach that way but don't allow condemnation to dictate your spiritual walk amen it needs to be the holy ghost moving on you amen so you see you can look in the church and see a trend and then you can preach about it and then it comes out in such a way reminds me of a time many years ago a minister actually preaching at his own son get this preaching at his own son over the pulpit about going on vacation and getting out there on the beach and taking your shirt off and wearing these shorts and walking up and down the beach and you say well i'm on vacation no you're a son of god 24 hours a day seven days a week and a whole family quit the church because the pastor was preaching them and the pastor was i was talking to my own son come on comes real when it comes right from the horse's mouth amen but you see somebody thought he was preaching in the flesh and he was preaching at them hello that's called a guilty conscience amen there's nothing beyond a guilty conscience before the preacher's done you have already analyzed his reasoning his purpose his motive and that was at me if you see the red dot on your forehead it might be to you but you see how satan works he break up a whole family break them out of church peel them right out of church and then the pastor says no i was preaching to my own boy and i preached the same sermon to him last night and i thought he ought to hear it again today so you see if you ever feel like your preacher is preaching about you hey moment honesty do you ever feel like brother paul's preaching about you i was hoping nobody would raise their hand let's clarify that let's narrow this focus down do you ever feel like the holy ghost is talking to you amen i sure hope you don't think paul is preaching to you or we're back to verse one or 2 amen but you see we need to recognize this fact my brother and sister that it is there and we'll have a little clarity as we come down into this you see my brother and sister if we ever come to the place now i say this once again if we ever come to the place my brother and sister that we are out of the word and we are into the carnal and we remain there now there are certain times that there are certain things that are carnal right there's these people now that believe everything that brother branham said as thus saith the lord but you can comb through the message and see brother branham talking about brothers stopping on the highway getting out and throwing was it rocks or snowballs at each other amen and throwing rocks at each other okay where's the spiritual significance do we condone now that we all have to get in the car and get out here on the countryside stop a car get out and throw rocks at each other no bro the prophet of god was just sharing himself as a man and that he loved these brothers and this was their humorous as it were see somebody might not see that's humorous but this was their humorous way of dealing with each other i'm right you're wrong you know come on the prophet of god didn't condemn him for that you won't find on tape where he said you brothers have an evil spirit you threw rocks at each other see there's some of these things that are just he's sharing a little bit of life but let me tell you i think sometimes they're a little deeper than we do think because i felt like throwing rocks at you before oh did i say that you understand saints we have frustrations we have this flesh that we have to deal with but it should never become a warfare of flesh and blood so we look at this and recognize that while we walk in the flesh we're not going to war after the flesh because all that does is separate amen amen so you know it's there that he's preaching about me but the weapons of our warfare are not carnal and i say to dave saints if you fight a carnal battle as a christian you will find yourself a loser every single time amen we were not called to walk in the flesh but called to walk in the spirit amen and not just a spirit but the holy spirit because many people walk with spirits amen but it doesn't mean it's a correct spirit so look at this now but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds but see when you see the word being preached and you say this is from the lord it changes the way you accept it amen people are saying well we'll only listen to tapes and i say we should be or reading or however it's best for you it's the pure word that's the only way i can get the pure word you know what they've done they just rip the page out because that was not what the prophet of god said it's not what our bible says but you see then we start to look at it as though everyone is suspect and if you think i hope this doesn't offend anybody but if you think that just listening to tapes is a solution then why do we now have a burgeoning growth of people listening to the tapes of different ideologies about the tapes when will they recognize it's not a flesh and blood you listen to tapes brother i have nothing to do with you you go to a church that has a real life preacher i have nothing to do with you when will they recognize it's neither of those things but it's a spirit that has come to conquer and divide and conquer amen so when they start to recognize that spirit they can discern that and my the tape will speak to you or a preacher will speak to you amen so what is a stronghold for the pulling down not the building up let me throw a stronghold in this right here saints i hope it never takes root in this church but a stronghold will be when we only fellowship with these everyone else ex we fellowship here starting to build a stronghold i've looked at churches that had strong clicks in them and when trouble come it turned from click to fracture and from fracture to golf extreme division when men will look you in the face and say we have nothing to do with them let's jump on the other side of that equation they our bride redeemed before the foundation of the world and you're now with your mouth in the flesh saying i want nothing to do with them what position does it put it amen what we should be doing is saying lord sorry brother trevor this man just makes me so mad lord i pray i heard the prophet say that it's iron upon iron the rock oh i need you brother but the spirit comes and says well in a nice message polite way i'll just wait until they got their back turned and i'm out the door that way i don't have to shake their hand and i don't have to say god bless you you don't think this is real it's really real it's really really really real amen you see we walk in this flesh but we're not going to war after it because we've got the holy ghost we've had a nature change we've got a different spirit this prophet of god just reading early this morning amen he's talking about a new creation in christ jesus and that's branch number two and we won't get off on that one though we walk in the flesh we don't war after the flesh for our weapon saints are not carnal but mighty through god for the pulling down of strongholds and so it's the word then amen look it's not the preacher it's not this man not that man that is determined what the stronghold is in your life do you realize that strongholds can be created by you [Music] well you know i have a little complex and i don't feel comfortable around people you're building a stronghold and you say well i've always been a quiet person you're fortifying your stronghold and god's here to tear it down amen god's here to knock down everything well the prophet of god talking about you know the the ducks and whatever and the fence and the water rose up and then all the lines disappeared and the ducks fellowship together god bless you ducks amen now see when we receive the word as from the lord we accept the word then as it's preached it's a completely different spirit or approach that comes upon it and when we receive it we can put it to work you see everything that you have oh i won't even name any brothers names or anything but a brother one time asked me some advice and i told him that this is how i would do it now what i didn't tell them is i've done it over and over and over again and i had to learn from scratch and i messed up a lot of things before i got this right and so i said this the way i'd do it and they obviously thought i had an opinion which was true it was my opinion but it was a proven one and then i see the brother again and asked him how it went and he said well i had to go back to the store and buy more stuff because i messed it up and i said oh how'd you mess it up and he said oh i said let me tell you how you messed up this is not to be big headed my brother and sister but this is just how it works there are some things god don't want you to experience god don't want you to have to be trashed and ground to dust till you can say well the lord raised me up from dust you put yourself there because you didn't listen to the word in the beginning the word would allowed you to have skirted completely around that issue if you had just listened to the word and so what god's wanting us to do is to come and receive the word and when you receive it you can put it to work in your life and now as i said a stronghold is a fortified place and it can be of our own making and what happens is you say why are you tying this together well it actually comes right down here and ties right in here in verse five we can create our own stronghold now we look at this in verse five is casting down imagination and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ i've heard brothers preach it and they preached it correctly and they were talking about the lust of the flesh and pride of life and lust after money and all of these kind of things but my brother and sister what if i think you don't like me i now have an imagination that i decide that the people of grace tabernacle don't like me and my imagination starts to build and fortify that i'm not gonna fellowship i'm not going to interact i'm not going to say god bless you i'm just going to become the the almost invisible individual in the church because my mind says no one cares for me no one prays for me no one wants to fellowship with me and brick by brick fought by fought they are fortifying you know many years ago sorry to bring this analogy this way but many years ago you know sometimes you think you've just went crazy they still laugh they still remind me of this but when evening my fellowship was still on maryland in the in the old church i was preaching there and god knew what the need was and brought it out through oh absolutely the silliness of preaching and i'm making a point and i'm sitting there thinking why am i making this point i don't even know why i'm making this point but i said oh it's like this saints you have a church fellowship and here's a sister already has a complex and she come into the church fellowship just a little late because well she just didn't want to deal with everything so she just timed herself to come in just at the right time and you know it's there that it's and she has fluffy green salad she actually makes a good fluffy green salad but when the sister is taking care of those things in the kitchen she gives her fluffy green salad to those and those sisters look around and they say my where are we going to put this oh here's a spot and when the fellowship is over the sister goes to get her dish and the other fluffy green salad has been scraped clean and she finds her dish up here not even touched she said i knew it i knew it nobody in this church loves me nobody cares about me saints i'm not talking about paul i'm talking about the holy ghost speaking to hearts and a sister oh if you could just see this i'm boasting on jesus christ i had stopped i'm down the aisle i have stopped and i'm telling this and a sister right here to my right starts weeping oh my goodness i've offended someone i walk out of church that sister and another sister there and the sister starts crying she tells me paul that was my green salad and i got a bitterness to this sister because they ate her salad sounds humorous doesn't it unless you're the one with the complex and satan has come to church and it started to work on you and the sister that was there that was at the deal remembers this my brother and sister that when it's all over this sister solid had never been touched and she's moved by it and all three of these sisters meet me out in the parking lot behind the church and are weeping because they saw what satan had done started a root of bitterness here started the spirit of like oh this sister's just a cry baby the whole time we're viewing it in the flesh and satan's over there going it's working it's working it's working you know it's pretty funny you go down years later have somebody walk by you at church god bless you brother paul i sure love them fluffy green salads and you're like you know what thank you lord you know what it means i mean somebody remembered amen something struck a chord with someone saints that's what the preaching of the gospel is supposed to do to us it's not about you're going to hell if you don't line up because we as complex humans in fact you can look it up i remember the sermon i looked through so many of them last night today my brother and sister finishing up this thought the prophet of god is even praying i might even have my sermon here how do i know lord forgive us for our humanness yes yes hallelujah any of you ever made a fluffy green salad actually they're inedible they're pure fluff no nutritional value but some of you like them anyway what does it do we start to build walls then we justify our wall and we justify the time and the circumstance the god's here to break them walls down god's here to break every stronghold we have in our life saint i don't care what started the building of a stronghold in your life i have no friends no one loves me whatever the circumstance it doesn't matter the word has declared that we are mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds and it's time for us as a body of believers to say lord this little complex i've had this little thing i don't even remember where it started but lord i want it broke down i want it out of my life hallelujah because sometimes we oh we can look at this my brother and sister and say well was casting down imaginations well i tell you what it's just as detrimental to you if your imagination is over people don't love you don't want to fellowship what don't want to be a part of you is if your imagination is over you dream about winning the lottery all the time and don't have a prayer life other than lord let me win the lottery so i can destroy my life like i did the rest of them come on saints vain imaginations it doesn't matter the content amen when you are wasting the thoughts that should be committed to serving god worshiping god thinking on the word you waste them on things of negative or things you think are positive oh let me tell you if i ever won a lottery i already have a list of what i'll do with the money imagine you'll know it's from the lord when that winning lottery ticket goes out of the sky and lands at your feet and scribbled across the top i'm a winner otherwise as believers you got money to waste on that kind of garbage you better throw it in the offering plate let it go to the far off lands for this gospel or look around in the assembly and use it to help lift up a life of another one you see that's the devil's imagination that he's got and people throw their money out like nothing i pray christians are real christians aren't doing that i pray that's my heart's desire i pray amen now look at this oh this is the part now we're at the meat of the service and time's up oh my how does this happen say having verse sex and having in readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now you cannot come into the state of the correct spirit of revenge until you're obedient to the word of god now imagine we're kind of joking in the back room hallelujah i get this morning to have revenge praise the lord this morning i can come and have revenge boy if you said that out of context people would be all nervous looking at you like what has happened to our pastor he's up there slobbering and yelling about taking revenge that's right when i have come into obedience i can then come back my brother and sister and wreak judgment on the spirit of disobedience and do you know what that does to the devil when he has pulled your string or push your button day after day year after year and one day you stand up and say lord i'm going to be obedient to your word and you commit to that and you walk into that and the devil pushes the button and you electrocute him when you bind him up tie him up with a word and throw him back where he came from it's like that's what you get devil that's what you get for putting a spirit of disobedience on me for year after year and days of my life binding me in the spirit where i could not worship god i could not take the promise of god and let it fully be applied to my life because here was a big glaring ugly face of disobedience but now i get by the word now you see my brother and sister this comes down the prophet of god shows us clearly we don't have power i have no power to bind the devil you have no power to bind the devil but you've got authority to lose the power to bind the devil now come on i hope this don't cause any of you to cringe or get upset with me because it's not in the flesh maybe i shouldn't have said that because it sounds like i'm defending myself the reason you're not seeing these things loosed in your life it's because the spirit of disobedience is still present it's time for you to bind the spirit of disobedience by stepping in oh you can say i bind you spirit of disobedience i bind you spirit of disobedience i bind you satan but you see if disobedience is still our life satan just goes but when you step into obedience you step into that position god says look at that my sons and daughters what am i smelling oh yes they're praying they're worshiping they're following my word and all of a sudden authority is calm the power is loosed and you are binding and you are wreaking vengeance on disobedience when that spirit of disobedience would rise up you can stand there and say satan that's your lie the same one you told the eve in the beginning it was a lie then it's a lie now and i won't accept it i don't need any more your knowledge devil i've got the word i've got revelation i don't need your knowledge i've been asking the lord because you see but i want you to catch this before we move on i have more here but i just feel led to move on having a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled in other words you can't simply go on being disobedient and expect god to honor that come on saints i love you i love you in fact paul he touched this so well just i'm so amazed how how the word of god sometimes just comes in such a way in verse eight let's jump to verse eight brother mason well look back at seven it's good do you look on things after the outward appearance i've got a haircut i'm wearing my best to church my best is not my favorite my favorite looks like wranglers and a shirt just saying look on the outward appearance the scripture says inside the ravening wolves seeking to devour oh but they're not preachers paul oh yeah everyone's a minister everyone's got a message to share are we all right and man trust to himself see you've got to catch these key words saints you can't just go outside over this if any man trusts to himself that he is christ somebody all but curse you to your face and tell you i have the holy ghost come on they're trusting to themselves they're the one declared it but christ in them is not manifesting that that is the truth now are those blunt well we got to come to the day sooner or later saints that we are courageous enough to stand up and say that spirit is wrong we love the people prophet of god over and over again deals with this it's not about the people it's not flesh and blood saints but those spirits they will anoint anyone who will open the door for them and we've got such a culture around the message that we're afraid to do this because they're just another message person of another opinion well i would hope our opinion would match this opinion because if our opinion don't match this opinion we've got a false opinion amen wait this is not opinion this is fact amen for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord has given us for edification now edification is to build to establish enlightened inform education moral or intellectual or religious so you see my brother and sister when the apostle paul is talking to them and says the lord hath given us for education and not for your destruction i've got a simple solution to this if you think the preacher is here to destroy you you probably ought to go to a different church because that man without your confidence in him will never do you one single bit of good in fact did you know by research oh dare i say this word in church psychology they've studied the behavior of people and people will attend you'll understand now how mega churches have come about people will attend a church because they like the pastor even after seasons of attendance have no clue what he is talking about that's how strong the cult of personality can be and the guy who shared that was a pastor of a mega church i don't know if he was hoping to stir people a little bit i'm not sure what it was about really but i was shared this little blip and they said is this not interesting and uh it is my brother and sister okay moment of truth is everyone ready for the moment of truth do we know what we're talking about young and old here kids come on do we know what they're talking about you see if we come to the place that we just attend church because that's what our family does and we don't know what's being talked about you might even in a small church like this be caught up in some kind of cult of personality or cult of something you see paul is declaring i boast somewhat more of our authority now this authority my brother and sister was given to paul personally he could stand there knowing this authority of the word in revelation of the word was given to him personally right he didn't read it in a book he didn't get some online course or seminar this was something god gave him but i want you to see because you catch the spirit of paul you have to know the spirit of paul to understand the words of paul and so as he is there i boast somewhat more of our authority it's not paul's authority it's the authority of the word and so it's christ in you the hope of glory right you understand that it's there that paul is speaking now of authority and he is there declaring i've been given i can boast of this authority because it is a powerful authority it it unleashes and it binds and it revelates and it does everything that's necessary for sons and daughters of god and it's there and we have it hallelujah which lord has given us to build us up the lord has given it to us to fulfill to educate we get an idea that brother branham was against education in the spiritual realm you're wrong because you realize my brother and sister even in the realm of revelation the word god chooses to lay the word out first are you with me he lays the word out first and then he comes and makes it real so someone's got to come with authority and lay the word out amen so here we see it it's being laid out and he has no but the apostle paul you just read it in all of his writings you know every bit of his writings you see this authority just oozes out of his preaching his teaching is it's just got authority he doesn't come and say i think or it could be or might be unless you disagree with me or unless the church founders fathers don't like it no sir somewhat more of our authority which the lord has given us for ed a vacation now what is edification i already read it to you to build to establish to inform enlighten educate isn't that what the preaching of the word covers every bitter that's right here before us you see saints we don't want to be an ignorant church had a friend went on to be a nurse they were always joking about some of the students in the class kind of interesting you know and that the way things work you see judge me don't judge me as the whole rally cry of the world don't judge me but they said you know there was this one young lady in their classes and when the instructor the start of the the preliminary stuff that was all book stuff everyone passed it they're on to the next stage the start of the next stage that instructor is like okay so what is this about your desire to be a nurse and he wanted each student to voice what their their desire you hear very eloquent stuff i mean people they don't know this can happen so this is what they start saying well i i just you know my mother was very sick when i was young and she finally found the right doctor and uh he did these other things totally different to these other doctors and and now my mother is healthy again and it sparked something inside of me i want to be a nurse and i want to help people they get to this one young lady says and what what reason do you want to be a nurse oh i don't know it pays good and i mean like all you got to do is like put a needle in people and shove some stuff in there and they're going to feel better and uh he was like um i think you should go right now and talk to the school counselor and maybe you want to become like an accountant why paul if he could stand here this morning i say with all my heart would tell you i would lay down my life for you amen this bride of christ is so beautiful to me so important to me i care so much and it isn't about the individual as it were but it is that this is what i was called to do now if there's one called to preach the gospel of saints there's got to be one called to living [Music] i don't think we have any lack of preaching i don't think we have any lack of desire to see this bride of christ built up and people say well brother paul you don't really preach on those deep things no saints i'm sorry i'm just pretty pretty shallow you know i mean i'm a farmer i've spent my whole life farming soil but we only farm it like this deep the roots have to do the going down here the farmer can't make the roots go down there but i can prepare the soil so the roots have every uh option or availability to start growing and keep right on growing and go deeper and draw more nutrients and more nutrients did you follow me saints amen you see it's coming a time that we're no longer a message babysitter as it were we are message sons and daughters i'm preaching to myself here don't think i'm speaking out to you amen i'm preaching to myself it's now time because this lamb's wife [Music] she got encouraged just you mean i can that little thing brother paul that's been bothering me for years you mean i can tear that down and take vengeance on the devil for afflicting that on me it's what the word says okay now you've got to take it home i know saints we're closing right after two more quotes and three more scriptures brother adam and i just had this conversation he's like don't say that brother paul james how many of you would enjoy the preacher coming out grabbing your hide and say you know at the break at work the other day that exaggeration that's the same as a lie you'd say how do you know i got an informer in your office you'd feel betrayed you wouldn't feel encouraged but how about that your life is private enough and the preacher don't know enough about you that the holy spirit comes down starts dealing with you and your spirit goes oh my oh my oh my now i have a choice to make oh i hope you understand me that something rises up in you it seems almost like it's of the flesh and you realize i can take revenge on the devil by repenting of this and getting it right and i get to go out and trash the devil well not the way you're thinking but how you'll trash him is every day just keep walking in the word and that's a body blow to the devil every day you're walking in the word and the devil's out there gets up in the morning and goes oh my goodness he's going to do it again he's going to live today and if he does make a mistake because the prophet to the age said you will make a mistake and i can just see it now he's going to repent oh my oh i put so much time in him don't you understand how much time i invested in deceiving you oh hallelujah i think i got my point across edification saints oh my jesus christ the word edifies up builds us up establishes up and then and only then can we edify christ to the world amen i've got so many things here that go across my mind my brother and sister satan eden amen the thing of it is today we don't try to establish the word of god in the people's hearts we're trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart we are commanded to establish the word of god paul said i didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your faith might rest upon the knowledge of man but i come to you in power hallelujah i want to see power manifested things i want to step into the position that when i wait you know i might be a poor example some of you say well he's a pastor he ought to be in that position how about you mothers you got a little one and she's sick or he's sick or something's happened and you are there going oh my 911. well if it's necessary you do it but what about the power of prayer that comes to you and says lord this is your child you gave me the child i gave the child back to you now lord it's up to you what you do with this child we've heard too many stories my brother and sister of prayer being answered right on the spot that's called a miracle but i come to you in power and manifestations of the holy ghost can i insert this don't always look for a physical realm to the answering of prayer well i prayed god gave me a raise at work i prayed and this and i prayed in that how often do we pray as the prophet taught us lord i need revelation lord i need revelation saints if you're not praying that way i beg you i implore you i beseech you start praying that way because these things have a better job a better house a better car you know blah blah that's all well and good amen that's right in the word that's god's promise to you but my brother and sister all of that is going to go away what we need is revelation amen and when revelation comes we will have the authority of the word that unlocks the power of the word that casts out demons and lifts up men and women sons and daughters of god hallelujah paul says i didn't come with enticing words those are the ones that just make you feel so good you know where we believe the message come on saints you say brother paul you're hammering on these things it seems like you have for a long time the reason is because i keep rubbing shoulders and interacting have conversations people that believe just acknowledging brother branham was a prophet is going to get him to heaven if that's the case the devil's there amen that's not going to do it saints amen hallelujah let's unwind 38 years i know it's happened before i've met girls that said yes to this but 38 years ago i met this really cute girl well actually i met her more i remember more like 42 years ago knocked it stupid hey hey notice me don't laugh brothers and i've heard brothers tell me i just walked up to my wife at some special meetings in ohio and looked her in the face and said you're going to marry me and that's when i finally said maybe we should apply luck once in a while usually don't go well does it but i tell you what there's a perfect tried and true brothers this is a romance class you start saving a seat for them you open the door for them when you notice they didn't reject you you might go ahead and move to bringing them a flower and if they still don't say no bring them to what do you do brothers come on young men well maybe even some of you married people that are struggling with this stuff sister jerry's going to say you're just preaching you liar what we got to do though see this part i know it's true you've got to work your way into their heart not surface otherwise when the hair starts falling out and the body gains a few pounds we'll start losing the appeal so you've got to get down in the heart and when you get down in the heart and you get a hoax of the heart they'll follow you around the world they'll sleep in bed bug infested beds they'll be eaten by fleas they will be hot they will be cold they will be whatever oh i hope you understand whatever i need her to be my seamstress my cook my laundry but without the heart that's it it only goes for a season and then it starts to become weary and it starts to struggle and it starts to become resentful oh jerry and i work on this all the time we have our own little thing i shouldn't even reveal this secret we have our own little thing we'll be sitting there and i don't know what event will take place and i'd say my think what it'd be like if you only loved me and her reply is i wouldn't be here if i didn't love you now you think i'm telling a cute little story about marriage my brother and sister some of us have done things that if the lord wasn't in the heart realm we would be out in the cold we would be lost but you see as hard as it is for us to comprehend we have the heart of jesus christ and he has our heart yes isn't this beautiful oh we're trying still my brothers and sisters like we're a bunch of jews under the old commandments trying to fulfill the law so god will be happy why don't we work on a heart to heart why don't we work on i'm going to serve him because i love him now i tell you what i met some girls that were so story-eyed when they first got married old stinky socks under clothes and they're just like oh isn't this so beautiful but after about kid number well anyway summit was half one two three four i wish some of you sisters would just open up and tell me you get up in the morning do laundry and you're just in there going i'm doing his smelly clothes i love to do this any takers no sir what is it it's now down in the heart realm i do this for my husband and i do it for my children because i love them look at this now man mustn't establish establish themselves we find it let god do something for a person send him out and you'll find every man trying to impersonate it but you see what they can't do is they can't have real love and i'm not talking about feeling i'm talking about love for the word a love for christ himself they can impersonate this for a season but they can't keep on doing the laundry are you with me i used a silly way to come about this but they can't keep doing the laundry because they don't love him they're trying to establish themselves every man i did this me i mine my denomination me this establishing themself what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of god oh my brother and sister look beyond all of this we might say i was here and i preached and i saw this happen i have seen devils cast out i have seen people healed i have seen hearts discern i've seen all this my brother and sister but i never did a drop of it that's right i was there when it happened by the power of god establish oh look at this i hope this speaks to your heart like i did mine studying establish the word of god come on saints we get the word anchored we get the word anchored in our teenagers well we don't have to worry about them running off out here in the world amen we don't have to worry about them fleeing from church if we can get the word of god established in them but if we just have a program we go to church we go to church that's all you'll have take out the unbelief and establish the kingdom of god in a man's heart and the kingdom of god cannot be established in man's heart unless god made that man thus he cannot be established and remember the deceitful part what man think it's right see there's a way that seemeth right until man every intellectual being seems right well hallelujah hallelujah we got time for another quote don't we amen now this my brother and sister 1956 god hath provided weight is a prayer this is part of a prayer amen yes i cherry picked it those that don't like cherry picking i never saw my brother and sister this is something that come to me the other day people i've had it throwed right in my face you're a cherry picker well i couldn't take the whole tree home so i picked the cherries come to your word lord you promised that you would bless your word wherever it was spoken amen and you said it would not return to your void but would accomplish that which it was purposeful and father thou who sent the word now may the holy spirit take the word now and go right straight into the hearts of the people and establish amen the preaching of the word building up an unmovable faith the preaching of the word stirring the hearts of the bride of this last day that regardless of what satan can bluff they're going to stand there and say you know what i don't know exactly how it happened wait maybe it happened from endless hours of reading my bible and praying and endless hours of sitting in church and hearing the ministry preach the word of god for the hour to me but i know this that here in my time of trouble in this labor to see an age as the darkness is settling in i have an unmovable faith and i can't tell you the exact day it showed up i can't give credit to any man on earth but it was the word it was a word preached to me unadulterated and god come with his word and now my faith is unshakable it's unmovable and i know that this promise of the word was for me and it will do all that it was said to do because god is not obligated in the sense we think obligation but god said i will be there or two or three or gathered well he's on front row he's on second row well unfortunately there's no one on the third row he's on the fourth he's on the fifth on the sixth on the seventh come on saints god honors his word amen hallelujah see i sent the word now may the holy spirit take the word now go straight into the hearts of the people and establish an unmovable faith lord that'll heal the sick and be afflicted save the lost given experience now let me explain to you the vials let's go into the thunders and we got a 12 year old over here 13 14 15 year old over here well they got the word preached to them what about experience they heard the word that conditions the soil but we've got to water that seed amen experience through those that are without it hide us now in behind christ lord and let us all of our speaking and preaching and testifying whatever may take place may it all be through christ for we ask it in his name you see saints we've got to come to a place that we actually don't just allow god sister amy if you'd come saints we're going to come in place we don't just allow god to move in our life we got to come to a place that we are out there saying lord wash me lord cleanse me lord fill me lord walk with me lord i need knowledge lord i need experience i need a cleansing you see my brother and sister it's not just enough to say well i believe i believe but god's looking for someone that will come and act upon that word in psalms 69 [Music] it's almost david says but as for me my prayer is unto thee oh lord in an acceptable time do you know we can be out of time sometimes saying an acceptable time of god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters let not the water flood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me hear me o lord for thy loving kindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of that tender mercies and hide not thy face from that servant for i am in trouble hear me speedily draw nigh into my soul and redeem it and deliver me because of my enemies [Music] the word says [Music] it's in the book of james the fourth draw an chapter to god and he will draw night to you [Music] you know what it takes to draw an eye to him saints it takes an open heart takes a clear conscience it takes a desire can i say that again it takes a desire to be in the presence of god not just an appearance going back in the scriptures don't look on the outward man [Music] i just want to encourage you this morning you might say brother paul's going to sound like you're going to make an altar call well i don't really do altar calls but i'm going to tell you you do whatever you want to do but i tell you saints it's time for some of us no let me be fair it's time for all of us to draw nine closer to the lord it's time that some of us need to just come and say well you know i've been to an altar in years i want to ask you why well the prophet of god said the altar is in your heart but the prophet god also made altar calls i think it's time for some of us to actually break through our old crusty self and stand up and say you know what i i need to drawn closer to the lord i need to draw nigh to the lord now how am i going to do that we've got so dry brother abraham says like he's off an old counter how high [Music] why because satan knows if he can keep you from being built up he's got nothing to worry about what are we constructing saints a good life here [Music] just read this morning where the prophet of god said all these blessings we have on this earth someday soon we'll be gone he didn't make that to make us get all nervous he just trying to get us to focus why because just like the apostle paul he looked at you and said man i have great authority of the purpose that i have for being here and that is to shake a bride get her attention that she would draw close draw really close i just ask you saints maybe you want to bow your heads whatever you want to do i just ask him tell you employ you beseech you whatever word you want to use [Music] if you feel in your heart maybe just lift a hand say lord i just [Music] i want to drive draw closer lord to you than than i was yesterday the day before even this morning lord lord i say it and sincerely lord not just to satisfy the preacher not just under some anointing of the moment but deep in my heart lord i just want to be closer to you look at the signs look at the times [Music] lord i don't know if anyone would feel to stand up and just maybe make an outward sign step to the front and say i just want the world to know i want a closer walk with you lord but i tell you lord wherever they might be i ask you this morning just to touch the hearts of your children for stir it father that it would be such that it wouldn't be just an actual outward motion that would go away a passing emotion but lord let it be the cry of the heart lord that we want to be closer to you lord we're drawing nigh to you lord now we're reaching out and we're crying out lord jesus come down and lord move in our midst as individuals lord as families as a a church a group of believers together lord that we would just collectively just reach out to you this morning and ask you come move in our midst come speak to our hearts lord father sometimes we get so caught up in the world we can't hardly find a time to fellowship around the things of god because we're so busy talking of the things of the world god forgive us let our thoughts let our prayers let our voice be upon you lord and i call out myself lord i happen to be standing right here in front of the saints lord i just lift my hand and i say lord i'm not satisfied with where i was yesterday i'm not satisfied lord where i was at last year father and i'm not satisfied to start a year coming with some kind of resolution but lord even before the new year would come father i'm asking you come down in our midst come down in my heart come down in my soul come down in my life in my household and move me father lord the word has declared that it would come as a thief in the night oh lord give us ears to hear and eyes to see oh lord let us not i just thinking of something that was preached years ago lord a distracted generation and if it was relevant lord when that was preached it is more relevant today and i would ask you father just to stir the hearts through the hearts of your children father lord let us not be asleep at the watch let us not be complacent at the wheel but father let something start burning in our hearts may the fathers of this assembly be the priests of their home leading their wives and their children in true anointed worship father not to become lazy just believing that if god sent a prophet and we believe that it will be sufficient but the word says there's a life there's a life lord i want that life now father those that man their heart lord they raise their heart to you those are standing those lifting their hands whatever it might be father it's not for me to dictate but lord may they just take a holds of this and these things that we spoke this morning lord to remember even to their own self father that this is not a carnal warfare this is a spiritual warfare help us lord to be more spiritual father just reading and hearing the prophets say oh i feel religious right now people would misunderstand lord but may they experience that same presence that he experienced and may their heart lord rejoice in you today father i have one last request [Music] oh lord this might seem direct to the assembly the lord i'm asking you to come and root out every sin that is in this congregation lord not to shame the individual but to deliver them into the liberty in christ jesus i ask you through the preaching of the word lord in the anointing of your holy spirit lord including lord not excluding us lord not excluding myself but lord ask you deliver us father from these fortresses of our own stronghold break the nature break the spirit let us be surrendered to you that is my heart's cry today oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah there's a fountain open in the house of david saint you you don't have to you don't have to come to an altar you don't have to do but the fountain's open and i just ask you as your friend as your brother i hope i made the case to you you can see it clearly today we're here to build you up not tear you down we're not trying to bring a spirit of destruction upon you but a building oh hallelujah a raising up a fortifying in the word amen not a fortifying in our own thoughts our own actions but the fortifying of the word oh hallelujah there's a
