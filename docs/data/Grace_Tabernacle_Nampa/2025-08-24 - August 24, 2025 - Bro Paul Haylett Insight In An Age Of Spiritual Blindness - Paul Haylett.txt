Let's not live for self any longer. Let's dedicate and give our lives to Christ. He's everything we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't leave here without him. His grace is sufficient. Let's bow our heads. Our heavenly father, our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. We are very thankful that we can bring these requests before you this morning because we know there's a fountain open. We know redemption. You've given redemption. You paid the price, Lord, for us. We've come here not to leave the same as we came in. Lord, we're determined to leave closer to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We're calling on you for revelation, Father, because Lord, we know we're saved by the revealing of the word in our hearts. And Father, we're expecting you to speak. We're expecting you to take the instrumentality of man and speak your mind this morning to predestinated hearts that are able to receive and hear the word. Now, Father, these requests have been made. You know, every one of them. Lord, many traveling, many outworking, &gt;&gt; many sick, not feeling well. Those online, Lord, we bring every one of them before you. They've been mentioned now in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; May every one of them be met. &gt;&gt; We expect that Lord because we ask in faith believing first of all that you hear us and that we know because you hear us we have our request now. Heavenly Father Lord may every one of these be met. Every unspoken request be ministered now. Lord, we give you praise because we know that if we ask anything in your name, you will do it. We expect it. We know we'll receive the answer. In the name of Jesus Christ, we do pray and ask these things. And say as we clear this prayer, Lord, we say amen because we know it's so. &gt;&gt; Amen, Jesus. Amen. Thank you, brother David. Um, you may have your seats. I have an announcement to make and as we do, we'll ask our sister Jerry to come. She's got a special for us this morning. Amen. Um, so, uh, just wanted to let everyone know we, um, Brother Barry Coffee is, uh, and through Vision Books is they're trying to print, I think, 40 20,000 or 40,000, I can't remember the number, one of those two. Uh, church age books for the believers there in Colombia and Mexico. And, um, so they've been trying to raise the funds to be able to do that. our church has given uh $5,000 towards that. So, uh just to be a part of that so that um those believers there can receive that. Amen. So, I just want to share that with everyone. Praise the Lord for the ability to do that. Amen. [Music] I stand accused. There's a list a mile long of all my sins, of everything that I've done wrong. And I'm so ashamed. There's nowhere left for me to hide. This is the day I must answer for my life. My fate is in the judge's hands. But then he turns to me and says, "I know you. I love you. I gave my life to save you. Love paid the price for mercy. My verdict, not guilty. How can it be? I can't begin to comprehend what kind of grace would take the place of all my sin. I stand in awe now that I have been set free. And my tears roll up as I look at that cross. cuz it should have been me. My fate was in the nail scarred hands. He stretched them out for me and said, "I know you. I love you. I gave my life to save you. Love pay the price for mercy. My verdict, not guilty. I'm falling on my knees to thank you with everything I am. I praise you. So grateful for the words I heard you say. I know you. I love you. I gave my life to save you. Love paid the price for mercy. My verdict. Not guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty. [Music] Amen. Praise God. Not guilty. Amen. When I see that blood, I'll pass over you. Not guilty. Praise God. Sister Melody got a song for us as well. Amen. [Music] You may wonder why I sing his praise every chance that I get. You may wonder why I raise my hands or why I shout amen. You may wonder why tears fill my eyes when I hear the old rugged cross. You may wonder why I live for him, why I serve him at any cost. [Music] But if you knew what my life was like before Jesus came and made things right and saved me from the mess that I was in. And if you only knew where I would be, had it not been for Calvary, then my friend, you would understand. Looking back on how far I've come and how much he has blessed. All the joys that he has given me. Despite my sinful past. No greater friend have I ever known than this one who walks by my side. And oh what a difference since he came into my life. And if you knew what my life was like before Jesus came and made things right and saved me from the mess that I was in. And if you only knew where I would be, had it not been for Calvary, then my friend, you would understand. And if you only knew where I would be, had it not been for Calvary, then my friend, you would understand. [Music] [Music] this little chorus. We all know the song. Just want to sing the chorus though. Um, through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Through it all, through it all. I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. [Music] Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Amen. Are you depending on him this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So we ask our brother Paul to come this morning as that song um Lord I lift your name on my heart. [Music] Lord my heart can grow so far away and cold. And yet for me your love is still the same. Long Lord I bend my knee in awe and fear of thee. My head bowed down in reverence to your name. Lord, I lift your name. Your holy name. Jehovah God. Elohim, [Music] you're the great I am the risen lamb, my comfort and king. Lord, my heart's desire is to be filled with the spirit fire. My purpose is to worship you alone. Open up my soul to worship and adore. Hallelujah. Be a fragrance offered to your throne. Lord, I lift your name. Your holy name. [Music] Jehovah God. Elhim, [Music] you're the great I am. The risen lamb, my comfort [Music] and king. Sing it to him this morning. Hallelujah. Lord, I lift your name. your holy [Music] name. Jehovah God. Elohim. You're the great I am the reason lamb. my comforter and king. [Music] Amen. Let's just sing it one more time prayerfully. Hallelujah. Lord, I lift your name. Your holy [Music] name. Jehovah God. Elohim. [Music] You're the great I am. [Music] The risen lamb. My comforter [Music] and king. Lord, I lift your name. Your holy [Music] name. Jehovah God. Elohim. You're the great I am the reason lamb. [Music] My comforter [Music] and king. [Music] You're the great I am [Music] a risen lamb, my comfort [Music] and my king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just take this moment. Just lift our hands. Just pour your heart out to the Lord. Just give praise to him. He's so wonderful when we stop and we think of all the things he has done for us. Amen. That he has led us and he has guided us. He said, "I'll be with you even in you." And we testify today that he is. Oh Lord, we thank you for your grace, your mercy today. Lord, I thank you for what you're doing in the lives of your sons and daughters. Lord, Father, you're calling a people home. Your people, a people who were once not a people, but now are your people. Father, we just thank you, Lord Jesus, for what you are doing. I ask you, Lord, bless your people today. Bless the saints, Father. Lord, move beyond this man and speak to the hearts of each and everyone for the needs of their individual life. Lord Jesus, that we might be able to lift our eyes and give praise to the King of Kings, Lord of Lords. We thank you, Lord Jesus. How we thank you today. Hallelujah. Is it good to be in the house of the Lord today? Amen. Hallelujah. just have a couple things here just real quick to to go over uh just to share with you. Uh amen. Uh Sunday school will start on uh the 7th of September, a little later than normal, and I apologize for that. Uh we will only have two classes this year. Uh and remember parents uh you'll need to have your children here by 9:45 and so that they can participate. And um we have uh want to lift up a young man who contacted me a couple days ago was unfortunately unable to be here today. Uh, brother Emanuel uh is here going to um the university to Boisee State uh from Ghana and uh he just desires to uh fellowship here with us. So please remember brother Emanuel in prayer. The Lord just make a way has a few challenges as in transportation uh lives very close to the the university there. So I believe the Lord will have a solution. Amen. to to help our brother Emanuel get here to the services. And I always I I just never like putting it this way. I I've always through the years been a little embarrassed myself, but um anyway, uh I just want to greet our sister Sarah, sister Anna, and brother, I'm sorry I don't know your name, so I'm just going to have to identify you as her husband. And I've always been embarrassed about that through the years. It's like to be identified as someone, you know, sister Jerry's husband. But God bless you. So good to see you guys. And and uh good to um see brother Manasse, Sister Katie here this morning. And uh it seems like we have a guest or two here. And each one of you saints, it's just good to see you. Amen. And uh so as we we look forward to what the Lord's doing in our lives, um I think there'll be several of us that will be gone this next Sunday. Uh um it would be uh our niece uh Beth, Sister Beth, is graduating from RN school. I say medical, but I don't want you to think she's a doctor. She's just an RN. Just u nothing, you know. No. quite an accomplishment. Amen. In the day that we live in just she's pressed through. There's times that she said this is too much and she just kept pressing and pressing and uh this this next weekend she graduates and uh so we'll be down in Salt Lake City. Um and uh uh there at her graduation. She's such a wonderful girl. We love her very much. So this next Sunday, Brother David Deanhart will be ministering and uh just be praying for that. Amen. I want to speak to you this morning. Thank you musicians. What a wonderful song service. Amen. Just touch my heart. I thank the Lord for that. And um so as we look at this today, I want to speak to you on uh insight in an age of spiritual blindness. Now, it might sound judgmental for me to say it's an age of spiritual blindness, but that's what the scripture says. It would come to a time that people would be spiritually minded uh and uh not have the power thereof. So, they have this thought of of we we have understanding, we have the word, we have all of these things, but yet not really understanding what what God is saying. Because you say, "Brother Paul, are you being judgmental?" No, I'm being realistic because if you understand something, you do it. If you really believe something, you do it. And so, we're living in a day that people say they believe the word of God. Don't want to change a single word, but do. And I know that's very stark, very direct, but that's the day the word said would come to pass, and it has. Amen. So insight is also another word for insight would be understanding. So God has granted to you understanding in an age of spiritual blindness. And I think that we should be able to lift our hands and give praise to God that he has given us understanding of his word. He's speaking to us. Amen. Brother Brandham told us he says of things to pray for in your life. &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation. Amen. And so without revelation, uh, we we can just read it and read it, read it, not understand it. And if you don't understand it, you won't apply it to your life. Amen. Oh, I'm just terrible with names. I I spot your brother hiding back there. God bless. It's not. Oh, he sure looks like him. Okay. I had to put my foot in my mouth anyway. So, well, God bless you. Glad to have each and every one of you here today. Let's turn in our Bibles to 1 Corinthians 2. Amen. Verses 1-16. Quite lengthy. We'll read a portion of it and allow you to be seated. Um, you know, sometimes these things linger in your thinking for quite a while. And and uh part of that is that you don't quite know how to put it all together. But the Lord didn't ask us to figure out how to make it come to pass. He just asked us to believe it. And when we believe it, he brings it to pass. So we thank the Lord for that. Amen. 1 Corinthians 2 chapter. And I, brethren, when I come to you, come not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. How be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world, nor the princes of this world that come to not, but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory. Heavenly Father, we just ask you to open the word today. Speak to the hearts of your children. Lord, we're here to stir up pure minds in remembrance, Father, of what you have already expressed to us, already granted to us. Lord, let the word come to us. Let it be living, Father. Let it be lifechanging. Let it be empowering, Father, that we can continue to press forward to the mark of the high calling, Lord. That by revelation, we can see the goal before us and finish this race. Ask you to bless each one today in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. which none of the princes of this world knew. For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. Now, are you looking forward to that time of to see this manifested, to see the the rolling out of the things that we don't even comprehend how great it is, what God is giving to us, what he's pouring into us. We do not fathom that. and and in our human element we say I I have seen times I've been experienced times of incredible blessing the presence of God and yet there's so much more that we do not even comprehend and so as we look at that we realize that uh it is not something that man can express because man expresses it in the level that man understands and so we'll see that as it is that eye hasn't seen ear heard neither entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us. Now, let's just separate this. As I spoke to you this last week, we got to separate. The Apostle Paul was talking here is a a position of the carnal man and here is a position of the spiritual man. And to fully understand the word of God, what's revealed in this hour, this day that we're living in. People say, "Well, you know, Brother Brandham, most of these things and and take that into context. Most of these things brother Brandham preached had already been preached, but my brother and sister, it has to be placed in the right order, in the right context, in the right importance." And so, it's there that God has come to us and he's not coming with a whole new gospel. My brother and sister, there's been many great men through the years preach many of these great doctrines, but God says we need to set it all in its correct order. And so, it's there that the Holy Spirit is coming in the day that we are living. Amen. This last day. And everything being set in order brings it to the place that one key unlocks a door. And to get to the next door, you must get through the first door. Amen. So the first things must be unlocked to us and then we can move on. And and if we don't have the right order, Amen. You cannot get through the doors if you don't have the right order of the keys to get through the door. So you can stand there and fumble around and you can try and you can go through the great key chain, you might say, trying to find a way to unlock the door. But when we get in the right order of the word, we will find that one revelation, one uh uh expression of the word unlocks a door for us. And then the Lord might allow us to go for a season. But you'll find that when we are in prayer and entered into the word, you come to that next door. The key is there. You don't have to fight. You don't have to fumble. Amen. But you have to take the right process. Amen. And so you have to follow through the word through the ages and you come down to this day and God says in this end time I'm going to set it all in order. I'm going to set it correctly that sons and daughters of God will come in this time and they will not be coming up to the age, the time, the expression or revelation of a rapture still fumbling around trying to figure out what did God mean? What did God put down in his word? What is there? Now, that's not to talk about, my brother and sister, you and I having an answer to everything. Amen. God answers those things in the season that God wants to answer it. And we would look and think, "Hey, I'm mature." But now, I hope you don't mind if I kind of push on you a little bit today. Have you ever noticed that we get to a spot we feel like we are very spiritually mature and then a little something happens in our life? And I'm just going to use a silly example. Maybe we just have a little bit of a temper tantrum. We get upset over something that was seemingly nothing. And it reminds us that without him, without the word being expressed to us, Amen. Our maturity is connected to the opening of the word. Amen. We cannot say we are spiritually mature and not understand the word of God. So it's not about coming in a human deal and saying, "Well, I I think because this is an elder brother, he must have greater revelation." My brother and sister, age and revelation have nothing to do with each other. Age and maturity have nothing to do with each other. So there's some very mature young people. They're very stalwart, patient, loving the Lord, open in the word that that are in age, you can look at them and say they haven't lived enough of life to really have an understanding. But if God gave them the understanding, then they have revelation. They have understanding. Amen. So we look at this that God hath revealed unto us by his spirit for the spirit searchth all things yay the deep things of God. So it's there that you can have a 12year-old with the revelation that a 50year-old has not found yet because they are in the word and the word is in them. Amen. But we often times uh we say we're not but as respector of persons we would look and say this brother is an elder and we base that on the simple fact they've been following the message for 40 years. &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister that 11th hour worker got paid just the same. And we would look at that and say but they weren't in the message long enough to have the maturity. God didn't care. &gt;&gt; God didn't care. He says, "I'm going to call these right here at the end, and they are going to come to maturity so much faster. It almost should make some of us embarrassed. &gt;&gt; We've been following all these years." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An 11th hour convert, &gt;&gt; has the same revelation we do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us not to get heady, high-minded to think we just have more because we've been around longer. &gt;&gt; What we have is what Christ has poured into us. &gt;&gt; And I say thank you, Lord. I don't want to embarrass my niece, but I tell you, we've seen God do some incredible things in her life in the last little bit as she shared a song today. Sorry, Mel. Have to just share this. Amen. But you see, my brother and sister, we get this idea. It's going to take years to bring a person to this place. I tell you what it takes. It takes a move of the Holy Spirit in a life. And when he pours in, my brother and sister, everything else must leave. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when it leaves, Amen. then you see a vessel committed to Christ. You see a vessel that's that's got the word of God flowing through them, filling them up. And this is what God wants. So, we should never get to the place that we think because we can date the date. Oh, we've been here 40 years. I think I was 9 years old when my parents come in the message. So, I could sit here today and say that I've been over 50 years, but how many of those 50 did I really have fully committed to Christ? &gt;&gt; That's what matters. &gt;&gt; We're not here to have some kind of seniority. &gt;&gt; We're here to get full of the spirit, to stop and say, "Lord, regardless of how long, bring me to the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the Spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now, we have received not the spirit of the world. Somebody ought to say amen to that. We're sitting here this morning not having received the spirit of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're new creatures in Christ Jesus. You truly are a different person than that person out on the street out there. And it's time for us to come, Amen. I had kind of a subtitle uh today that I I didn't put up there, but it's time for us to receive our portion. Amen. To come to a revelation to understand I'm not just like the man out there. I was called of God. I've been vindicated or confirmed of God. He's speaking to me. He's showing me. He's talking. He's walking with me. Amen. And all I can say is I am where God has brought me to. &gt;&gt; That's what I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did I put myself there? We can't. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet of God, very clearly. No other ministry, I hope you don't mind me kind of going off into this, but I believe it kind of makes a point. Show me another ministry in the world today that you can find that stood in front of thousands and confessed their faults. &gt;&gt; And those faults that he confessed in public have now come back to be the criticisms that they are using against his ministry. Why didn't the rest have courage enough to stand up and share the issues of their own life? &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, you see, God wasn't afraid. It wasn't about William Brandham. &gt;&gt; It was about the word that he brought to us. And God said, "I don't care. I'll show you Elijah the prophet. I'll show you his flaws." He's up there saying, "Lord, why did you dry the brook up? I'm going to die here." And God has to come and convince him, "It's time for you to get up and start walking and follow the cloud." &gt;&gt; Amen. Time for you to get up and start moving. Amen. And God had to dry the brook up and cause the raven to go away to get him out of his comfort zone. How many of you have a comfort zone today? Amen. How many of us are just comfortable to say God is real? Amen. God Yeah. God's a healer. God's a provider, but we won't get out of our comfort zone to actually prove that God is a healer. He is a provider. He is a savior. And he's got a spirit he wants to pour into you and I. Amen. We pull back. Oh, God sent a prophet. That's your comfort zone, my brother and sister. That prophet come and said, "I came to introduce you to Jesus Christ. Let the introduction take place." &gt;&gt; Amen. Put on your royal garment and get up and go and let the introduction take place. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother and sister, it's time for us to receive our full portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just a portion of the portion, &gt;&gt; but the full portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we look at this, we've not received the spirit of the world, &gt;&gt; but the spirit of the world would sure like to claim you. &gt;&gt; The spirit of this world right here, whether it's music, clothes, &gt;&gt; and the one we hardly ever want to address, attitude. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Atmosphere. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We have a chalkboard in our garage and it's written on it to never let our confession be negative. And there's times I have to stick my head out the back door and look at that chalkboard and remind myself, man, why do I have a negative spirit? It's because I'm dwelling in a negative atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's true. You don't want to have a negative spirit, dwell in another atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You want to have a positive uh uh approach. Amen. Don't just tell you, "Oh, mind over matter. I'll be okay." Get in a different atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And when we get in a different atmosphere, God comes down, starts to move because he promised he would fulfill his word in you. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you a question this morning. Do any of you have a testimony that God is fulfilling his word in you? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not sitting here and saying, "Oh, well, he's going to do it for someone. He did it for them. He did it for them." We need to be able to sit here this morning and say, "God has fulfilled his word in my life." &gt;&gt; Amen. I am here as the fulfillment of a message to the end time church, the bride of Jesus Christ. I'm not just sitting here saying, "I go to church. I believe." Let your belief be manifested. Let it become an evidence that you actually do believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Reminds me of a story, a fishing boat out in the uh Arctic Ocean and the ship is sinking and the man is looking at this life raft and uh he says, "Uh, I that that thing's so flimsy. These waves are big. That's so flimsy. I I don't trust the lifeboat. I don't trust this life raft. He stayed on the ship. The ship sunk. He dies. The seven men in the lifeboat live. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, sometimes to live, you've got to step off of the things you've been trusting and step into the realm of the things that have been promised for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, look, my brother and sister, it takes an act of faith to be a real Christian. &gt;&gt; You have to be able to step out. You have to be able to trust God. And you've got to prove you trust God because anything less than a full commitment is not a commitment at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me move on. 1 Corinthians the 3rd chapter verse 18- 23. Now we oftent times I I hope you don't mind if I just speak straight forward this morning. We often times get really concerned. People are like, "Well, I'm so concerned that I, you know, I got to guard myself so I'm not deceived in this day, this age, when there's all the wolves and there's all the the deceivers in the land and I'm going to guard myself that so that I am not deceived." Let me tell you, if it's not the Holy Ghost in you, you will be deceived. &gt;&gt; You yourself are not smart enough. You yourself cannot comprehend enough. You yourself cannot discern well enough. And that's why we don't trust ourself. We trust the moving of the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit is there. It promised in the word to lead us and guide us. So there we are. What are we doing? We're not following a man. We're following the leadership of the Holy Spirit. And if you say, "But I haven't experienced the leadership of the Holy Spirit." Then I encourage you not to leave today till you find some leadership from the Holy Spirit. Because just to walk in this life saying I believe my brother and sister, you know that's called a chino. Amen. Now that comes from the original deal when the Republican party in the United States here got to fussing with each other and some said, "Well, they're not really they're really not Republicans." And somebody come up with a deal that they're rhinos, which is a Republican in name only. &gt;&gt; And it struck me one day. I thought, "Isn't that the truth?" Amen. There's a lot of chinos on the earth today. They're Christians in name only. I am not criticizing them. I just don't want to be one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be a real Christian. And you know what? I'm not strong enough to be a real Christian. I do not have the discernment and and uh the anointing and all of this to be a real Christian. Is that shocking to you? Amen. So here I am today, a man preaching to you that does not have the ability to be a real Christian, but the Christ in me, amen, has empowered me where I can stand on the word. And it's the word that carries me through. I never caught myself. I never redeemed myself. I never discerned for myself. I never anointed myself. Every bit of that that's happened in my life was Christ in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as Christ is working with us, don't be afraid. Make sure that you're in Christ and you can't be deceived. Amen. You get in Christ, he'll lead you and guide you. But we're afraid of this. And we're afraid of wolves and sheep's clothing. Let me tell you, a real sheep, a real lamb of God can smell a wolf a mile away. Amen. Because that wolf will have a certain odor and it smells like sulfur from the pits of hell. And a real lamb of God can tell that. &gt;&gt; You say, "But I've never experienced that." Well, either you're naive. Pardon me for being blunt. You're either naive or God's been leading you and you never got close enough. So maybe we ought to lift a hand and say, "Thank you, Lord, that I never had to be deceived. I never come to that place cuz you've been leading me. You've been guiding me. You've been taking me, amen, through the path of my life that kept me away from the sulfur pit. K me kept me away from the wolf hiding in the bush. It kept me away from all of these things. But my brother and sister, God sometimes allows you to be tested. You don't really know the value of what's real until you've had the counterfeit. &gt;&gt; I'll just share a little brief story with you. One time I was doing construction work in Mountain Home out at the air base. And uh I had went I was going up there to be up there for several days and I'd went to the bank and went in there and and uh got a personal check and got a few hundred dollars in cash and and so then u we're up there working on the air base and of course you can't hang out on the air base. So every evening we go back into town we would eat and go back to our hotel and we ate in a little restaurant there and I went to pay my bill and I put a $50 bill on the counter and the young lady that was there had that marker. That's when they first came out. And she swipes that marker across that $50 bill, looks up at me, and says, "Sir, do you have another one?" And I said, "Yes." And I said, "Why?" And she says, "This one's counterfeit." You know, and I thought, "I'm going to prison. I'm doing all this explaining. I I got this from the bank. I mean, I can prove that I wrote a check and the bank gave me this money." And pull out another one. Same. Pull out another one. same. There was five of them. And I was like, "Oh man, I've been ripped off. How do I go back to the bank and prove that this actually came from the bank?" But you see, you know, God's got a solution for everything. The young lady looked at me and said, "Well, the other part, you know, the start of the advent of a tying a tavern or whatever to a restaurant, and you can go to this side or you can go to that side." And and uh she said, "I've got an answer for that." And she took that and went over into the other side, you know, through the door that went over in the other side and she exchanged it in their till. So she just gave them the counterfeit, brought me back real money. I wanted to hug her cuz it's like, you've solved my problem. She said, "Let them, the drunks, worry about it." Now, my brother and sister, God is going to take what is evil and make it good for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's things in life that you would say, "Oh, that could have destroyed my life." But if you have the opportunity one day to look, you'll find that God took those things that were evil and made them good for you. Amen. Leading you and guiding you into all truth. And this is what this message is meant for. Amen. To lead us. Amen. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, he that taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. Therefore, let no man glory in men. Boy, this should be a wakeup call for us. Don't Don't glory in no man. Amen. For all things are yours. Can you guys repeat that? Say that with me. For all things are yours. &gt;&gt; This is the word of God telling you that all things are yours. God's provided this for you. He's made a way before you to bring you everything that you need. Amen. Whether Paul or Apollos or Cphus or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all are yours and ye are Christ and Christ is God's. Now, I'm going to go into a little thought here, and I don't want anybody misunderstand because I know that we have quite a few people taking higher education, and I don't want you to to misunderstand what I'm saying. But my brother and sister, as we'll go in our thought a little further today, you'll see how God looks at education, how he looks at knowledge in the sense. Now, that is not to come and say that you going to school, you're doing something wrong. Because what the word is talking about is when people believe they can have an experience with God through knowledge. &gt;&gt; So when they feel like that they can study enough to understand God. I want to know have any of you ever come close enough to understanding God? The only thing I know about God is what he revealed to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I could never sit down and figure out uh what God is, how God thinks, what God wants unless I had his word. and his word was open to me. So when he opens his word to us, my brother and sister, it's not our knowledge, it's his knowledge in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 1:22, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools. So we're not here today to to express how smart we are in the scripture in in uh all of the message or anything like that. What we're setting here is acknowledging that what we do know, what we do understand is God's revelation to us. He He has given us a portion. Now, if the word of God says that God has never lost a one, then you can rest here today on the very fact that you don't have to have an answer for everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; God will give you the answers that you need. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be the overcomer in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need to figure out all of these other things. While they're trying to split the neutrons and protons and whatever else, they cannot make a blade of grass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you look at this, God's going to give you everything you need to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if there's something you don't understand, don't get all bent out of shape over this and say, "Until I can't move forward till I have an answer for this." Just say, "Lord, when you want me to have an answer for that, just give it to me. I'll be here waiting, Lord. I'll be here believing, Lord. I'll be confessing, Lord. I don't have an answer, my brother and sister." But brother Isaac and I was just visiting in the back room for a minute. My brother and sister, I couldn't even repeat the conversation. It was a little complex for my simple mind. But my brother and sister, we're coming into a day as science comes. Now, the prophet of God said there'll be a day that science proves the word of God. &gt;&gt; And we are living in that day. They're coming talking about splitting protons and this that and the other and how all of these things and I should ask brother Isaac to come up and repeat some of those things, my brother and sister, because while I heard it, I my brain didn't quite comprehend all of it. But you see, they're figuring out what neutrons and protons and all these things will do and how they behave and how this is. My brother and sister, one of the examples Brother Isaac gave me is we could stand here today and we could stand over here and put a little target on the wall and we could take a rock and we could throw it and hit that target every single time or hit within a variation of that. But when you get into the matter of the universe and all of these things, they're a little more random, but there is nothing random with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As you walk through this life, as you live this life, as you are going down life's journey, what is an answer? Maybe you think it's the same question and you say, "God answered their question. Why hasn't he answered mine?" Because God has sent it out to answer your question in a different time, a different place, in a different fashion to bring not a different result, but a result that's fitted to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've said this before. How many of you would like to be brother Paul? Boy, there's some weird expressions out there. They range everything from astonished to disgusted. But I'm telling you, you don't want to be me. But I don't want to offend you. I don't want to be you. &gt;&gt; I want to be who God called me to be because I've got my niche in the gospel to fulfill. You've got your niche in the gospel to fulfill. I don't want to be you cuz I might think that you've got an easier life than I do. But if I stepped into your shoes, I might be shocked. &gt;&gt; I might be shocked to find out the battle that you face and the things you have overcome. And then I might be over there wishing I was back in my own shoes. &gt;&gt; Because God has equipped you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Believe with me this morning. God has equipped you to overcome everything that comes your direction. Don't say, "I've got this insurmountable battle." Whether it's in our flesh that needs healing and whether we need a deliverance for something, God has made you more than able. He said, "You're more than a conqueror." And he said, "I made you to overcome that challenge." And we need to just stand and say, "Lord, I'm here. I'm reporting to my post of duty." Amen. I'm standing here today. I'm not ashamed of the gospel. I'm not ashamed of what I believe. And I have a living proof that God is walking with me. I have a living proof. Oh, can I venture here? I hope this isn't offensive. People are like, "Well, I I just got sent a deal, you know, and somebody's like, "Well, there's no vindication for his ministry." Well, my brother and sister, I can't find any vindication for their ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So why am I going to believe what they say negative when there's not one single vindication for their ministry? But I'll tell you what I do have. I have vindication in my own life that God is leading me and guiding me. That he's a healer, that he's a savior, that he's a deliverer, that he is faithful. I have vindication of what God is doing in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't need to look to someone else and say, "I've got to have this. I've got to have it. They've got to prove this to me. I tell you, if you've got a real experience with God, God has proven to you that he hears your prayers, that he heard your cry, that he's here for you, and he's here to deliver you. That's the vindication we need to look for. &gt;&gt; And besides that, I don't believe their words that there's no vindication. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It wasn't proven enough to satisfy their unbelieving soul. &gt;&gt; That's right. only nothing will ever satisfy their unbelieving soul. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; My hopefully I'm not speaking too blunt because you see professing themselves to be wise they become fools. So let me put it this way. It is impossible. Now remember I'm not against education. If so I would be opposing my own granddaughter signed up for college. I would be I'm sorry for calling people out. I'd be opposed to Sister Alice. I'd be opposed to Sister Jennifer. I would be opposed to many of you. Right? I sat here today and I would be a hypocrite to say I'm opposed to you, &gt;&gt; but I believe the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you're living the word, you are the word. &gt;&gt; You can't say I'm with the word, but I'm opposed to it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. So people say, "Well, Brother Brown was against education." No, he wasn't. &gt;&gt; He was against the negative influence that thinking you could educate yourself into the answer. &gt;&gt; It takes faith, my brother and sister, to activate the word of God, not education. &gt;&gt; That's right. I remember one time, if you don't mind me putting it this way on the internet, a man's like, "Well, we can't really truly understand these scriptures until we can find even the oldest form of the Aramaic. We won't be able to understand this." Well, he don't even have his hands on something. He says he needs to believe. I'll tell you, my brother and sister, I have my hands on something that I need to have to believe. And it's there that do I understand? Oh. Oh. You know, when they translated this Bible to English, they turned some of those words. Well, I'm not looking about what words they turned, my brother and sister. I'm looking to the promise that God said, "I will lead you. I will guide you. I will speak to your heart. I will write my word on the fleshly tables of your heart. I don't need some intellectual to tell me whether it's quite right or quite wrong. I've got a God that's here to tell me what is the truth. I've got a God that says, "Well, don't worry about that. I'm writing it on your heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, people are counting on education here. Again, I just feel the need to confirm to you. I'm not opposed to education. I wasn't very good at it. You know, I mean, have to admit that. &gt;&gt; I have a teacher. I do business with him. He was my teacher in the seventh grade. He's got quite a vivid memory. Can tell you all about the attributes of all these students. And he told me, he says, 'You know, Paul, when you were in my classes, I had him in several different studies. He said, you know, it got down to the end of the year, almost like the daisy. Do I pass him or do I not? Do I pass him or do I not? But he said, "I knew while you wasn't a good student, you actually knew." &gt;&gt; Can you relate to that? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; If you're a real believer, quote me a quote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're a real Christian, quote me some scripture. &gt;&gt; Preferably two or three chapters to prove that you really can. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we got stopped at the border coming out of Canada into United States once and the man was like, "Oh, so you were up there at that there that church?" "Yeah, how was the meetings?" "Oh, it was good." "Okay, what's your favorite scripture? Quote it to me." I'm looking at him like, "What's this got to do with crossing the border into the United States?" But see, he was trying to make a point. &gt;&gt; And finally, I got tired of it and I said, "Maybe we need to talk to your supervisor. You can go. But you see my brother and sister, this man's idea that if I could quote enough scripture, I was a real Christian. &gt;&gt; What I want to do is live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I might not be so good at quoting it, but I want to be able to be really good at living it. &gt;&gt; And if Christ said, "I'll be with you, even in you," then we can live it. We don't have to sit back and say, "I'm trying. I'm trying." We will. Amen. So, it's impossible to educate ourselves into a relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's that simple. &gt;&gt; All kinds of study won't replace something inside of you &gt;&gt; that yearns to be in his presence. &gt;&gt; It won't replace a desire in you to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because I can assure you, the encyclopedia is not taking the rapture. &gt;&gt; No. Matthew 11:25. At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes." My And we also see that Luke shares the same account. Amen. And puts that out there because as it is, you're saying, "Brother Paul, this is nothing new. I don't have a job to tell you something new." Look, as a minister of this gospel, I don't have a job that has a job description. give them something new. I do have a description that says, "Stir up their pure minds in remembrance." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You guys heard that scripture before, right? &gt;&gt; That's all my job is is stir up your pure minds. I thought about bringing a boat paddle maybe like as a decoration for the church. just kind of lean it up against the pulpit here. And when other people are looking like, I've heard this before. I could just grab a hold of that and come out here. Cuz that's all it is, my brother and sister. If it's not personal relationship and personal revelation to you, there's no amount of preaching will ever make it real to you. &gt;&gt; It's got to be God in you making it real to you. Amen. And it kind of even goes beyond that. If I can jump ahead of myself just a little bit, my brother and sister, if you are here saying, I I I've studied that. I know every quote the preacher knows. My brother and sister, then you need to step forward and claim what is rightfully yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can describe this. &gt;&gt; I got a phone call the other day, Mr. Hale, was you on this certain airplane flight? Yes, we were. And you were sitting in seat and named the seat. And I said, "Yes, we were. You left an article behind." Got my wallet, got my eyelasses. H what would I have left behind? I'm racking my brain. Oh, well, my wife has earbuds. Um, but she's got her phone because I've called her a dozen times. You'll hear her complain about that. But anyway, um, I call her all the time. She's got her phone. I know that. She's got her purse. I I was like, "Ma'am, I don't have a clue what I would have left behind." I said, "Can you give me a hint?" She's like, "No, nope. You have to clearly identify what it is you left behind." I talked to Jerry, we come a conclusion. It's somebody else that left something else behind, not us. Now, you say, "Where are you going, brother Paul?" I'm telling you, my brother and sister, the devil's going to come and tell you, you've missed it. You've left something behind. But I'm telling you, if you are in the word of God and the word is in you, there's nothing for you to leave behind because a real believer is going to take a hold of the word and say, "That's my promise. That's my word. That's my life. That's my healing. That's my provision. That's my salvation. I'm not leaving anything behind. There's not one thing that I'm going to step beyond and say that doesn't apply to me. Every bit of this revealed word of the hour applies to me and I'm claiming it. There might be others that have left something else behind, but as a real believer, I'm not going to leave one word of God behind. I'm going to believe every word of it. I'm going to say amen to it. Whether it pinches me, I'm going to say amen to it. Whether I understand it, I'm going to say amen to it. If it's the word, I'm going to say amen to it. Now my brother and sister, there'll be those that are there in that day that say, "Didn't we do many mighty works in your name?" But they missed it. They left something behind that they didn't take a hold of. Something behind that they didn't allow to be fulfilled in their life. They said, "That's not necessary. I don't need this." My brother and sister, it's become a little catch thing around the house there. You know, when God was talking with Moses, they're out there and the on the mount and the burning bush and God said, "Uh, take your shoes off, Moses." What if Moses would have turned around and said, "Well, Lord, it's more our custom. I'll take my hat off." Would it yield the same result? No. God said, "Take your shoes off." And when the word of God today tells us to do something, don't offer a substitute. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "I don't want to take that, but I will take this." &gt;&gt; Come on. He didn't say if he wanted our hat off, he would have said, "Take your hat off." But he said, "Take your shoes off. Take your shoes off." &gt;&gt; He said, "If you consecrate your life and give it fully to him and put it under the blood, Satan can't get to you. So let's don't offer I belong to this church. I belong to this. I've been a Christian for 50 years. My brother and sister, get under the blood. If he says getting under the blood is the answer to us, apply the token to your life. Don't say I've got an alternative to it. Our family's already always been in this church 100red years in this church. I've shared it in the church here. I'll share it again. I was come across this deal where a church was celebrating the 75th anniversary. Turns out the lady was 90 90 some years old. They were celebrating that she hadn't missed a service 75 years. That's pretty admirable. Okay, let's see a show of hands of anybody who's even in the running for that. But that's not your salvation. Perfect attendance in church is not your salvation. &gt;&gt; We can't rest on that. Oh, St. Peter, look at my award. I never missed a church service in 75 years. He's not caring about your church attendance. Even though the word says that you should be faithful, amen, to come to the house of God, you should be part of that. It's not an attendance reward. What did you get when you was in the house of God? Amen. What did God say to you from his word? Amen. Did we catch the promise? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hopefully this doesn't pinch anybody. You know, there was a time in the seasons, actually when I was reading about this, this was in Australia. There's all these men in Australia and uh hardly any women. And so, it become a great business venture for mail orderer brides. Now, how many of you sisters would want to go marry some guy, travel across the ocean for a few months to marry some guy you've never seen before? [Laughter] You gave your self away, Sister Jennifer. But you see what they had trust in. They said, "I want a husband. They need a wife. I'm going to trust that there's something good about this individual. And if not, I've got a problem. And this little story that they base this on talked about a young woman who traveled to Australia. And she gets there and it turns out the man that had she responded to abused everything around him, horses, cattle, whatever it was, he was an abuser. And so it looks like she's in a paradox. But she says, "You know what? I already made a promise to this guy. She had been raised a very faithful young lady in church. I made a promise to this guy already. It's like a vow. And people are telling her, "We'll defend you. Do not marry him. Do not go home with him. We'll defend you. He can't force you." And she just felt this overwhelming urge that I already made a vow. So, one of the first things, talk about standing your ground to the devil. One of the first things she did is right there in public, she looks him in the face and says, "Sir," and he's like, "What? You ever lay a hand on me in anything but tenderness?" This is a humble wife. Hope you're with me. Different idea what humble is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This a humble wife. You ever lay a hand on me except in tenderness, I'll kill you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sisters, were you here? Are you listening? I don't know how that would go over here. She said, "I just want you and I to start off in the right positions in our relationship. I'll be your wife. I'll bear your children. I'll clean your clothes. I'll clean your house. I'll take care of everything for you. but you must give me something in return. And as time went on, people are like, well, we're expecting something bad to go happen. But you see, what it was is she spoke the right words that he had covered up his inadequacy with anger and frustration. He covered up his inadequacy with all of the bluster. And when she spoke to him, was the man afraid of her killing him? I doubt it. But when she said, "You must give me something back in exchange." Think about our Lord Jesus Christ. He's given us life. He's given us everything. He's healed our bodies. Anyone been healed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's healed our bodies. He's given peace to our minds. He's done all of this here and all he is asking give me something back in exchange. And this is a revelation. You say, "But but but you know that's yeah, that's the gospel." No, my brothers and sisters, a lot of people claim the name of Christ that don't give back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They've never dug in deep enough to know what worship is. They think that singing a song and lifting a hand in church is worship. They think that reading their Bible is the answer. My brother and sister, God wants you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he wants all of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he wants you for whatever purpose he has called you to. &gt;&gt; We don't get to define the purpose. Amen. Now, think about that little lady going there. She says, "I'll cook. I'll be your wife." That means intimacy. and I'll cook for you. I'll clean your clothes. I'll do all of this thing. I'll have I'll bear a family for you. But you got to give me something in return. And the Lord Jesus Christ has given you and I eternal life. And he's just asking us in the kindest, sweetest way. Just give me something back in return. Does he want your money? &gt;&gt; No, my brother and sister. Just like the old joke of the guy showing up at the gate with St. Peter with a bag full of gold. And St. Peter says, "Why you got pavement with you?" That's what God thinks of our money. That's what he thinks of our wealth, our accomplishment, our fine clothes. He thinks about everything we done. He doesn't care about that. He said, "I want you." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want is you. That's what the whole plan is is about you. Amen. And so, we're getting insight. The word of the hour, let me get back on track. The word of the hour is to give you and I insight into what this world, this time, this age is all about. It's not about just going to church. My brother and sister, now I just read a story the other day, just horrendous story. Won't even recount it to you of a man who was influential in his church, very known through the community and turned out to be, well, this will give it away. Turned out to be a mass murderer. &gt;&gt; Going to church won't change you. Your position won't change you. What you have won't change you, but Christ will change you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what he's looking for. But we're living in a day of spiritual blindness. Amen. We could start off today. If you don't mind, we could start off with um our attendance record today. Who would join in with me? But I'll break it next Sunday, so it won't do me any good. But you see, my brothers and sister, that's not what God's looking for. God's looking for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram says here in the sermon, why it is so uh why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian life? Amen. Now, he he's making a point here. And this bird was made. No other bird could stand up there. The eagle's eye is the sharpest eye of any bird. Why? He can outdo the hawk in any way. Because the hawk has a sharp eye, but just for a certain distance. But the eagle is more powerful because he goes higher than the hawk. He goes up to where the hawk would die if he tried to come to him. His body is not made like that. Oh, how I could stop right here by the help of God and show you how some people try to climb to places where others stand. You just wasn't made that way. You just can't stand it. And these eagles would go up. Now he's shifting a gear here. Could King Hezekiah ever climb to where Elijah was? So, here's a king. Now, let's go on. Bump forward. Amen. Though he was the greatest man in the kingdom, the king. But when he turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly, God spoke to Isaiah to go to him. Isaiah could climb where Hezekiah could not. You see, God could have just come to Hezekiah and said, "Okay." But God always works through a channel. Go through your Bible. God always works through a channel. God doesn't change his mind. He's not subject to the whim of the day that we live in the 21st century. He's not subject to that. He mapped this all out before the foundation of the world. Amen. Uh so uh Hezekiah uh could speak a word here on earth as a hawk and everything bowed at his feet. Isaiah couldn't do that, but Isaiah could climb into a place where Hezekiah couldn't climb. All these things are for purposes. So God's ego eagle Ezekiel climbed up into a place where he could see some 15 18 yeah 2,500 years ahead seeing things. &gt;&gt; And if you could go high enough above the earth, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; How many of you experienced that? &gt;&gt; Looked out of the window of an airliner &gt;&gt; and it's black over here &gt;&gt; and the sun is rising &gt;&gt; over here. Amen. Pretty common if you cross enough date lines. &gt;&gt; Amen. You get to watch the sun rising while it's completely black &gt;&gt; out the other side of the airplane. &gt;&gt; Dark on one side, light on the other. So, you see the world over if you get high enough and your eyes could focus to that. So, Ezekiel climbed up so high that he saw our day. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; what? Go back and read Ezekiel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you'll find that he was looking out and describing exactly what's happening in our day. It's right there in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's eagle. And he told us what would take place in this day. Now, I want to ask you something. The church seems to be out of cater somewhere. Now, we've got at least a good hour here. I didn't hear anybody say amen. We've got at least a good hour here. So, let's just sit down and take our helmets off and listen for just a few minutes. Now, notice if God intended his church to be run upon intellectuals, then it doesn't take the Holy Spirit to do anything in the church, right? So, this isn't I studied the message and I I see that it's right. It lines up with the word of God. Don't let your intellectuals run how you see the word, what you believe, and how your life is guided. It takes something more than that. Amen. So, it's there. It could be run upon intellectuals and it doesn't take the Holy Spirit to do anything in the church. We do not need the Holy Spirit if the church is to be run upon intellectuals. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just catch this. You know this, but I'm just stirring up pure minds and remembrance. What is the world come today? There's many denominations. I won't even name names because that wouldn't be fair. But if you do not hold the equivalent of a master's, you will not even be considered to pastor their larger churches. &gt;&gt; I already read you the scripture that says he hides it in the eyes of the wise and prudent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And reveals it to babes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But look how man's got involved and he's turned this around. Now, brother and sister, I'll put it this way. There are some people opposed to the preachers, this spitting, slobber, and mistake making, mispronouncing preachers. But what I want to know is what did God think? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God said, I love this. We want a perfect preacher to pe speak to imperfect people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So maybe if you want to have a perfect preacher, maybe you need to become perfect people first and then you could find the perfect preacher. But I like how it was said, if you think it's perfect, it won't be when you get there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz God said, I've already tooken account &gt;&gt; your imperfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You do not have to be perfect. Now, this might baffle some of you. I don't mean to offend no one, &gt;&gt; but you don't have to listen very long. And here, brother Brandham, I was listening to him the other day, corrected himself three times in a row, &gt;&gt; is that a perfect person? No, sir. It was a perfect God using a person. &gt;&gt; The same way that God, a perfect God will use you and I today. Because if we have to get perfect before he'll use us, my brother and sister, then do we need to be saved? Do we need to have the word washing us all the time? No. This is the plan of God. This is how God is working. He takes the imperfect people and his word and his anointing changes them and brings them to the place that God says they're perfect. And if you want to apply that, you could take that to see that Enoch, we have an idea when we talk about perfection, that Enoch was just this perfect guy that pleased God. And it was. He was a guy that pleased God. Amen. His life pleased God. But if you think that Enoch was the absolute epitome of perfection, my brother and sister, you've missed it. Enoch was a guy that was completely sold out to God. Gave his life to God, trusted God, confessed everything of the word, did his best to live it, and repented when he made a mistake and God says, "You're perfect in my eyes. I'm taking you home." Now, to clarify that, if Enoch had been the perfect guy, wouldn't God be obligated to make you the perfect guy? &gt;&gt; Certainly. Or is Enoch another social class up from you? &gt;&gt; The same word that says there's no respector of persons would then be respecting persons. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I don't mean that to be offensive. What I'm trying to tell you, if I could put it in words, is that God has the ability to take you and I and make us perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to be perfect in oursel. It's God in us. Christ in you, the hope of glory. It's going to be God that makes this. And when you're looking for a perfect bride, you need to look for God first. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when you find God, you will find perfection. &gt;&gt; You look at mankind, you will not find perfection. But God says, "I know how to make you perfect. I'll be with you, even in you." Amen. And you can't have Christ inside of you without the word changing you. Amen. Without being changed into this perfection that the word is talking about. This is what God wants us to do. &gt;&gt; Trust him. &gt;&gt; Believe him. &gt;&gt; And then act upon what he shows us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church seems out of cater. We got the hour. Let's see. If God intended his church to be run upon intellectuals, then it doesn't take the Holy Spirit to do anything in the church. We do not need the Holy Spirit. If the church is to be run upon intellectuals, I like this as this quote goes on. Amen. then we should find the smartest man. Um anyway, God bless you all. I'm I'm leaving because um I do not qualify as a bump on the smartest man. Okay. Do I finish the sermon? Do I leave? I don't really claim it as my identity, but I'll tell you, I've proven it enough times to believe it. I'm dumb as a rock, but rocks got their place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mountains are not made out of sand. &gt;&gt; They're made out of rocks. Amen. So, you look at this, my brother and sister. Every one of us has a purpose for our place in the economy of God. Amen. So, find the smartest man we could find to be our pastor and the biggest buildings that we could build and more members we get into our church and root out the illiterate. another excuse for me to call goodbye and bring in the intellectual. Better the church would be if that is the program. If that's the program, the smarter the preacher, the smarter the congregation, the more intellectual they are, the better the church will be. But I can't find one place in all the holy scripture where God's church is to be run upon the wisdom of men. And as long as we try to run it upon the intellectual of man, we're absolutely fighting the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's move on here. God's church is to be run by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Can we get an amen out of this? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's to be run by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Then if we have the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is going to run the church, then it doesn't take too much intellectual. It doesn't take education. It takes the Holy Spirit. That's God's program. Now, we know that we don't have to find the smartest people in the city to make our church better. We don't have to find the best dressed people in the city to make our church better. We don't need the biggest crowds in the city to make our church better. We need the guidance of the Holy Spirit to make our church better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We would look down upon so many of those in those age of the apostles. We would look down upon it because the scripture shows us that they were poor and uneducated. They were illiterate, but they were people that were seeking the leadership of the Holy Spirit. They wanted God to speak to them. They didn't need a highly polished man. They wanted God to speak. And sometimes, I know it's hard for people to believe, but sometimes God chooses to use that spitting and sputtering and whatever man to do that to be able to bring the word of God because it's not the man anyhow. It's the Holy Ghost in the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the Holy Ghost in you that's going to bring you to a rapture. It's the Holy Ghost in you that's going to bring you as a church of the Almighty into a victorious march into glory. It'll never be the church you attended. It'll never be whoever taught you. It'll never be how far you went in school. Although I believe that's beneficial in the day that we live in. Amen. It requires more and more understanding of the things to make a good living. But that school won't put you in a rapture. In fact, the universities are proven to actually be evil. They're wicked. There's all kinds of all kinds of nonsense there. So, those of you going to school, I'll just take two seconds and share my philosophy. &gt;&gt; Go to school, get that education, but before you go, seek ye first the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to go out there. You're admitting the devil's going to whip you when you go to college. &gt;&gt; No, that's not what that's not what the word says. The word says if you're under the blood, he can't even get to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who wants to be under the blood? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the real goal is. Is just to be under the blood. Amen. We don't have to worry about what Satan's got. He can roar, but my brother and sister, he's a toothless lion. &gt;&gt; Amen. And isn't it amazing when we use that as a reference? Lion and lion. Yeah. And he's a toothless liar. Amen. because his lies, there's nothing to them if you're under the blood. &gt;&gt; Now look, I need to I need to quit. I needed to have quit a long time ago. Why didn't somebody yell time? Brother Ivan's too nice. He wouldn't have drugged you out. I already preached that page. Do you? Let's go on. Ephesians 3:9-11. You can just grab that real quick and read that as homework for yourself. Let's go down here into the revelation of Jesus Christ and then then we'll close. Now, we've been talking about the offices and manifestations of one true God and beholding his glory in the scriptural study, but he is not to be known intellectually. That's right. &gt;&gt; He is known spiritually. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; By spiritual revelation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The same one who is known as Jesus after the flesh went back to the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he promised he would come again and dwell amongst his people by the spirit. &gt;&gt; And on the day of Pentecost, that pillar of fire came down and separated itself in tongues of fire upon each one of them. Now, do we believe this word? &gt;&gt; We believe this scripture. &gt;&gt; That means that equally to you and I that tongues of fire, the Holy Ghost has fallen. Amen. It's not just in a class called the preachers. It's not in a class over here. It's not in a class there. But the prophet of God is declaring that that pillar of fire come down is the Holy Ghost and has fallen on you and I. I'm here today. I might not be near as spiritual. I'm not as spiritual as you probably think I am. Amen. I'm a guy. I made it. I realized on the way to church it's like, "Oh, I've got grease and dirt under my fingernails. That isn't very appealing. I did my best to clean them out, but it's still there." That's me. That's Paul. I understand dirt. Some of you are really smart. I say that kindly. I say that in a positive way. But when it comes to salvation, your intelligence won't save you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I can't use my lack of intelligence as an excuse. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You have equal opportunity. I have equal opportunity because that pillar of fire has come down upon God's people. I I'm not worthy, Lord. Do you realize what you're saying? You're telling God, "You made a mistake, Lord." &gt;&gt; Does God make mistakes? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's Let's have a little rubber meet the road today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Get that out of your vocabulary. I'm not worthy. I I just should have prayed about this. I should have done this, but I'm not worthy. If God said you're worthy, you're worthy. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he wants to come down and pour himself into you, who are you to stand here and say, "Don't do it, Lord. I'm not worthy." He said, "I'm going to let my fire come down upon you and fill your soul and cleanse you." And we're over here saying, "Don't do it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. It's time for us to claim our portion." &gt;&gt; God said, "I want to bless you. I want to give you the Holy Ghost. I want to pour myself into you." We need to stand up and say, "Lord, there's some things in this life I don't understand, but I receive it in the name of Jesus Christ. You want to pour your Holy Spirit into me. Lord, I gladly receive it." Because once the Holy Ghost is in me, it will make me worthy. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, my brother and sister. We got it backwards. We want to be perfect thinking then God will come. God says, "I want a vessel that will let me make them perfect." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Excuse me for getting excited today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Same one is known as Jesus after the flesh went back to the pillar of fire. He promised he'd come again and dwelt among his people by the spirit. And on the day of Pentecost, that pillar of fire come down, separated itself in tongues of fire upon each one of them. That what was God doing? He was separating himself into the church, giving all those men and women a part &gt;&gt; of himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Imagine &gt;&gt; this might almost sound like Santa Claus, &gt;&gt; but imagine here we are in church today. &gt;&gt; The God you can't see, but you feel the God that you know by the word. He promised, "I'll be there two or three in my name." &gt;&gt; And God's come down and he's saying, "Here, take a little of me. &gt;&gt; Take a little of me. Take a little of me. Take a little of me. Take a If you knew what I did yesterday. I do. &gt;&gt; Lord, if you I know. &gt;&gt; Take a little of me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But Lord, just take me. &gt;&gt; Just receive me. &gt;&gt; Don't give me your excuse. Don't fabricate a reason why not. Just simply say, "Lord, if you're giving yourself to me, I receive you." &gt;&gt; But I tell you what it is. When the word comes, the minute that God starts to move handing out, &gt;&gt; I lied. I was jealous. I had a temper tantrum. I did this. I did that. I remember that piece of bubble gum I stole in the first grade. No, no. Let me tell you saints in closing. If God offers himself to you, just say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I receive. &gt;&gt; I'm going to accept what you've offered." &gt;&gt; In my mind, my consciousness, my spirit, I might think, "Lord, I am not worthy." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But our Lord knows. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our Lord knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm going to offer myself to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Could we just stand? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe just lift the hand to the Lord and say, "Lord, I receive." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We look at this. &gt;&gt; He's giving himself to us. May God just touch our hearts today. Amen. That we could stand in the word and say, "Lord, you've come. &gt;&gt; You've opened your word. You've poured your spirit out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, I'm here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We could go into these things and saints, we can acknowledge this. I made mistakes yesterday. &gt;&gt; I made mistakes even maybe this morning, sir. &gt;&gt; But God's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saying, I want to give myself to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. &gt;&gt; Would you receive me? &gt;&gt; Would you take me in as a friend? Would you invite me into your life, into your house, into everything about you? &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; cause you to offer an excuse why not. &gt;&gt; That's right. and just say, "Lord, come." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Fill me, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to receive you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's grace, saints. &gt;&gt; It's God's grace. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; If he chose you on merit, I don't mean to break any atmosphere, but if he chose you on merit today, not one of you would have made the cut. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Just stop and think about it. Not one of us here, not one of us would make the cut if it was on our merit. Amen. &gt;&gt; But unmarited favor, God's grace, he says, &gt;&gt; I'm going to pour myself into you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A people who were not a people but are now my people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad you belong to Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Ivan 188, please. Amen. Just let the Lord speak to your heart. Let him guide your footsteps. Oh, come Holy Spirit. I need thee. Come, sweet spirit, I pray. Come in thy strength and thy power, my Lord. Oh, come in thine own gentle way. Oh, come Holy Spirit. I need thee truly today, Lord. I need thee. Come, sweet spirit, I pray. [Music] Come in thy strength and thy power, oh Lord. Oh, come in thine own gentle way. 893. Brother Ivan, I want to just feel like the Lord's moving on me. I want to give clarity when I was saying about brother Brandham correcting himself. My brother and sister, God sent a prophet and brought a perfect word to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't say the man himself's got to be perfect. If you can't look and see that there were things that he come back and corrected, then you're ignoring it. But I want you to understand, it was a perfect word of God that came from the throne of God for you and I. because nothing less than that would be sufficient to redeem us. &gt;&gt; And the prophet stood there and says, "Hear I am God's voice." That's right. &gt;&gt; To you. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was it? The word coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unadulterated to the hearts and lives of sons and daughters of God. It would take a perfect word to redeem a perfect bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that word has come and this perfect bride is now in manifestation in the day that we live in. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother and sister, God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; We don't need to define what perfection is. We need to let God define what perfection is. Cuz you could look at your own life and say, "Oh, I've got so much. There's so many things in my life I need to do." And God will be looking down at you in faith and saying, "You're perfect. Let me drive that home. Who would be brave enough right now to lift their hand and say, "I'm perfect." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We should be lifting a hand. We have the word of the hour. We are perfect in God's eyes. Amen. The blood's still washing. The blood's still perfecting. Yes. But we are perfect in God's eyes. Amen. He doesn't look down and say, "Well, look at that rotten bunch of no good people. I guess I'll just have to keep beating on them until they get in line. No, he looks down and says, "This is my bride." &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, I'll just bring more clarity to you. I'm not the least bit ashamed to say, "I'll be happy one day." As the church ages, shows us very clearly in the scripture that each age, each messenger age will stand with the messenger of their age. And they will be identified with that messenger. And I'll tell you right now, I'm not the least bit ashamed to stand with the messenger of my day. I'm not the least bit ashamed to stand and say thank you Lord that you sent this man. Amen. You used this man. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to undermine that. But I want to tell you some of us needed someone. I'll just give this to you. When I was living in that limbo land, married, three children, struggling to serve God, and I would hear Brother Brandham say certain things. Let me just stir up your memory on that one. Phone rings, gets up, walks out the door. As he steps out the door, tell him I'm not here. Some people would say, "Boy, that's that's just that's just terrible." I'll tell you, for this boy at that stage of my life, I realized if God's prophet could be caught in that kind of a circumstance, there's hope for me. &gt;&gt; There's hope for me. Oh my. And it stirred in my heart to realize what I was trying to be and what God was allowing and molding me to be. I had the wrong perspective. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was that an error? No, it's perfect. You say, "But brother Paul, what?" No. Maybe it was just for me. Maybe your life never reflected that. Maybe your life never needed that circumstance, but I needed that in that day. And God allowed that to come and speak to my heart and say, "You know what, Paul? You're saying you'll fully serve God when you can reach this milestone. How about you just serve God regardless of what milestone you're at and I'll take care of the rest. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And then God leads his dear children along. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, Father, see that you are drawing a line in the sand. I want to be standing on your side. Oh, holding your hand. So let your kingom come. Let it be me. This is my voice. This is my plea. I see that you are standing. I lie in the sand. Want to be standing on your side. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hold in your hand. So let your kingom come. Let your word be me. This is my prayer. This is my plea. [Music] Let the worippers arise. Let the sons and the daughters sing. [Music] I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to my king. Father, I hear it growing louder. The song of your redeemed as the saints of every nation are awakening to sing. From our hearts there comes an anthem. Oh, hear the heavens ring. This is our song unto our king. Let the worippers arise. Let the sons and the daughters receive. I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to the king. Amen. Let the worippers arise. Let the sons and the daughters sing. I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to the king. Amen. Hallelujah. you surrendering your all this morning. Amen. As he was closing out there, I just couldn't help that song, uh, I want that kind of blessing. You want that this morning? You want that for your life? Are you committed to him? You trusting in him? Lord, &gt;&gt; he will bring it to pass. That what the word says. Amen. Amen. You believe that? When Jacob met the Lord upon that lonely night and wrestled there alone until the morning light, he won a princely title to gert him for the ride. I want that kind of blessing. I want I want that kind of blessing. King that saves and keeps and satisfies my soul. I want I want that full salvation till billows of heaven or me ro. When Israel at last came into Canaan's land, the Lord his riches gave so full on every hand. They drove their foes before them and dwelt a happy bank. I want that kind of blessing. I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and satisfies my soul. I want I want at full salvation till billows of heaven or me roll. This is the day of grace. The comforter is here. We are a chosen race. Our God is drawing near. He's waiting to be gracious of prayer of faith to hear. And then he'll send the blessing. Won't I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and satisfies the soul. I want I want that full salvation till billows of heaven or me roll. I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and satisfies my soul. I want I want that full salvation till billows of heaven or me roll. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. I'd like to just sing as we are dismissed today. Um, God be with you till we meet again. Amen. Let me start with a chorus. Yeah. Till we meet. Till we meet. Till we meet at Jesus feet. Till we meet. [Music] Till we meet. God be with you till we meet again. [Music] God be with you till we meet again. [Music] By his counsel's guide hold you with his sheep securely fold you. God be with you till we meet again. Till we meet. Till we meet. Do we meet at Jesus feet? Do we meet? Till we meet. God be with you till we meet again. Turn around, shake each other's hands. Just sing the chorus one more time. Amen. Till we me. Till we meet. Till we meet at Jesus feet to me. To me. You're dismissed. God bless you. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] feel around. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] See? [Music]
