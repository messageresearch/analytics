faing all things are possible ho be one more time [Music] oh all be all things are possible only feeling oh ho be all [Applause] heing all things are possible only be amen how many believe praise the Lord you know that's not enough you know that right cuz Lord Jesus says even the demons believe and tremble so the difference is we have to believe but we have to take it as our own and put it to work because we can confess even the Bible says if we if we confess with our lips that Jesus is Christ the Lord but we not only have to confess it we have to believe it and we have to put it in our [Music] heart and then he going to bring fruit remember the parable of the Lord Jesus when this men went and start sowing seeds and fell in different grounds different soils some of them were Believers some of them were not Believers but some of them were True Believers that's a good soil cuz you take the promises of God and make make them your own Lord I believe you know I always I always I always say that sometimes we sing songs but but we sing them just because we like the melody or the Rhythm but we don't put our ear and our heart into the words that's right so we have to be conscious what are we saying what are we singing you know and the secular music uh we were talking to my wife this uh yesterday and the secular music is being a mess that's right and we remember I mean we I'm a Mexican as you notice already and and I remember back in in in the years the the countrymen used to bring serenades to the ladies but those songs were like poems to them I'm assuming back in the year here it was the same way but now the the the the the the letters the the words and the songs are garbage but you know what the saddest thing is that garbage came into the churches that's why we have to Be watchful that's right what are we listening that's right amen what kind of food we eat that's right yes sir anyway that was not my thought this morning you may be seated for a few minutes please um I believe you know the drill I I I I tell my family say if I'm going to work you're going to have to work too so uh they prepare a song for us this morning and uh I'm always happy to be here um and and a pleasure to be here even though I feel my my blood Rises and but you know what uh when you know that you're doing a work for God is it's worth the pressure it's worth the the nerves that come and but uh we just want to be a blessing for you this morning and I I would like you to uh enjoy the song [Music] [Music] while the world looks about me it's a strugle alone they say I have nothing but they are sorrow in my heart I'm rejoicing how I wish they to sing thank you Lord for your blessings oh me there's a roof up above me of a good place to sleep there's food on my table and shoes on my feet you gave me your love Lord and a five family thank you Lord for your blessings so me oh I though I not wealthy and this clo they're not new I don't have much money but Lord I have you and that's

invitation and and thank you all for coming because that tells me that you're you didn't come to see the the preacher you came to see what God has for you this morning amen amen there is nothing good that I can offer but God is amen good right no matter where we are in the mountains or in The Valleys that's right is there for us amen amen if if you please go with me to the to the Book of Exodus 24 248 let's start with verse six it reads like this and Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins and half of the blood and sprinkler on the Altar and he took the book of the Covenant and read in the audience of the people and they said all that the Lord had said will we do and be obedient and Moses took the blood and sprinkled sprinkled it on the people and said behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord had made with you concerning all these words amen let us pray Heavenly Father we all can do Lord is to read the Bible read the words that has been written there father we thank you for that opportunity and we ask you this morning that you can come and speak to us in a manner that we can understand father what you have we commit myself and these people into your hands Lord father we thank you for the opportunity and I ask you to help me to set aside myself so you can come and speak freely Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen you may be seated re uh receive greetings from brothers and sisters and tric series um I've been as most of you know that we we had a an experience with our oldest son about having leukemia when he was a baby and since then we've been uh we've been blessed that God heal him we we all know that God uh was merciful with us and with him and and and I went and did did a little bit of uh I wouldn't call it research because a research I think is more deep but I I I just search a little bit about the blood and and uh reading the Bible if you go with me and and ver uh chapter 29 of Exodus as well um is is the blood is is so amazing and how the blood works it is I mean the science can Define it they can they can have a glimpse of the the the how the body works and that's what they sometimes they they do good things they they know what to treat but sometimes they just say I'm sorry I don't know and that tells me that the only one who can cure is God because he is the one who design amen that's right I don't know if I told you this before here but I always bring this down to uh we all know cars so there was a young man driving a car and all of a sudden the car broke and he was in the the highway and then the hood was up and she was scratching his head looking at him and try try and didn't start and then all of a sudden another car pulled in and and and an old man with with the suit came down and say what's what happened kid he said I I don't know this car doesn't want to run I say can I take a look on it and he said well I don't know how much mechanic you are cuz you're in ass suit and oh let's let us let me try then the old man went and moved move some wires and and he said okay give it a try the guy started and the car runs and he was very thankful and say Lord what's uh sir what's your name thank you very much he said I'm Henry Ford so who designed the car I mean it's it's the same way God works that's right in some that he designed so let's let's read verse 21 there and thou shalt take of the blood of that is upon the Altar and of the anointing oil and is sprinkled it up upon apron upon Aaron and upon his garments and upon his sons and upon the garments of his sons with him and he shall be hollowed and his garments and his sons and his son Sons garments with him with him you know Moses is talking about Covenant and he is sprinkling the blood and and if we go back to Genesis we we know that when Adam and Eve seen what had to happen blood had to be shed to cover amen their sins amen that's right so God from the beginning he was sending a message to the Future Generations about [Music] blood so a covenant is a binding obligation yes it is in the in the word in the English word a covenant comes from a Latin word is is called convenient which means come together or come to an agreement but in the scriptures is the ultimate expression of committed love that's right and trust and it was usually made to to Define to confirm to establish or make by in a relationship amen that had beginning the making of some time a covenant is abiding unbreakable obligation between two parties based on unconditional love seal by Blood and secret oath yes that creates relationship in which each party is bound by a specific undertakings of each other's behalf amen the parties of the Covenant Place them under the penalty of divine retribution should they later attempt to avoid those undertakings it is a relationship that can only be broken by death that's right amen so that that's how serious God was when he made this Covenant yeah he didn't plan on Breaking the Covenant with Humanity when he he when he made a a pledge or or a promise or or or a a covenant he didn't do it thinking that maybe down the road he's going to break it and and start another cant with someone else no that's right the reason we got separated from God is because we broke that's right the humanity broke the Covenant that's right but God was still there that's right I mean Adam and Eve got separated from the fellowship amen with God because of the sin but God never pull him away amen God went down and looked for them that's right that's what he went and says Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's right and and I know many times and many preachers have heard have said this but God knew where Adam was right now the question remains where are we that's right that's it that's right because God is still wants to keep that Covenant with you yes sir yes sir and the only way to do it is through the blood of Jesus Christ that's right you know I hope you had breakfast this morning I know we don't have service this afternoon so I might I'm just kidding but he says in the human body there are many different kinds of tissues we Define them as muscle nerve fat gland bone and all these tissues are connected and they have one thing in common yes sir they are fixed cells microscopically small and having a specific and limitation function unlike those fixed cells the blood is a fluid and mobile that is it is not limited to one part of the body that's right so it doesn't matter if you if you your head you're going to bleed right you cut your toe you're going to bleed that's right so see see the importance of the blood I mean you have fingers in this hand but you don't have in your back amen but you have blood here and you have blood here that's right you have blood here so that's to me like I say I when they say your son has leukemia is is cancer in in the blood in other words the blood is contaminated and this this was very interesting to me because that explains the importance in the blood and human body because the blood of Jesus was the only one who was able to clean amen you know remember John says Behold the Lamb of God that's right who take it away the sin of the world right yes it didn't cover it right it took it away the blood is the fluid and mobile it says that runs free to move through the entire body and Supply and to fix the cells with nourishment and carry off the waste products it says an average 20 I'm sorry it's a process which we all call metabolism in the normal human body there are about five quarts of this fluid and this blood pumped by the heart circulates throughout the system about every 23 seconds so that every cell in the body is constantly Supply and cleanse and at the same time it is constant communication with every other cell in the body this blood is the most mysterious of the of all tissues being composed of scores of elements and compounds and strange chemicals bodies which whose fun function is not yet fully understood but which all of which have to do with the mystery of life that's it for the life is in the blood that's righten once the blood fails to reach the cells and members of the body they probably die and no man ever dies until his blood cease to circulate this life is in the blood and book of Acts 17:26 says and he has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the Earth and has determined their pre-appointment times and the boundaries of their dwellings yeah so by one blood that's it and brother Bram says that oh this brother got God beat me here we got the quote it says notice then that the blood came down and it was Christ Jesus amen and God himself coming out of the spirit went into Christ Jesus that's right and the bible say that God was in Christ reconciling the world to make to make a k Kinsman is that right God himself Jehovah lived in Christ and was made a Kinsman to us because he was born in human flesh like we are is that right the blood cells were developed by God and the flesh cells the flesh cells were developed in the womb of Mary that brought forth the child and God came down and lived in human flesh and he was tempted in every manner just like we are so if you think you're going through a rough time right right you're not the only one yeah CU he set example for us that's right and he and he did it for love that's right amen he did it because he saw you and this dying age amen that you were going to be in struggling that's why he did it the blood cells he he brought forth the child and God came down and lived in human flesh and was tempted in every manner just like we are do you believe that now when he did that he freely gave his blood he didn't have to do it he made it that he made that sacrifice he could have went right up into Glory he could have been transfigured like he was in the mountain Transfiguration went unto heaven and never died for us but to be willing to die for us he gave freely his blood at Calvary amen you Lord is that right and he picked out he was a man of sorrow it was he he he didn't choose the easy route because of the love yeah that he had for you and me amen because the moment that he Ste into into this realm he knew what what was coming to him amen he he he chose his disciples knowing what was going to happen knowing who was going to betray him but he still chose chose Judas but you know what every single brother BR says that every son or daughter of God has to go to a test yeah because God wants us to put in in in a position where we where we are useful tools in his hands amen because God can use a baby what can a baby do you have to take care of him well but God you know many times and it's a sad a sad thing to say but many times I heard Christian say oh I'm a I'm in the process every time you uh try to correct them oh it's because I'm in a process yeah but this process is being stock there I mean it's there's there's no progress in the process that's right so a process is a progress too amen and many times we we we just get that covered and say oh I'm in a process I'm a I'm a human being and uh I made mistakes yes but you don't get to make the same mistakes over and over and over if you want to grow in Christ I know we're going to make mistakes I I make mistakes daily but I try not to let me ask you this you make the same mistake with your wife what's going to happen you're in trouble or vice versa it's the same thing with God God give him the the children of Israel and remember the scripture says the people said to Moses every that you say that is you read in the we're going to obey right they say we're going to obey right but it's easy to say and it's uh harder to do amen but for that reason we have to lean more to God because we cannot overcome this world without Christ amen he said he he he said that he overcame the world so we must this not a maybe we must overcome as well because the blood of Jesus Christ come and cleans and takes away the desire it cleans you brother Brandon says that the the the the people they got so used to bring goats and and and Cs and and and and turtle dos that they took that promised light so light that they oh I messed up yeah but next year I'll bring a father cough or a father lamb to impress the priest but guess what some of this those priests were crooked that's right so that's why you don't trust man you trust God right he's the one who gave his life for youen I I mean if I tell you how many times I've been let down by man ministers but you know what I learned you don't fall in love with the man that's right amen that's it amen you fall in love with the spirit that is in the man because if that spirit is from God he's not going to let you down that's right you know for for many people Moses let down many people yes sir oh you promis this and this and this and this it wasn't up to Moses No Moses was doing his part but you know what we we we as human beings we want everything so easy talking to brother Paul this morning there there's people that they they just like to hand the hand out and you have money for me how many people are out there because we want an easy life that's it but life is not easy no and if you became Christians to have an easy life sorry to be a bear of bad news it's no easy life being a Christian no it is as Paul that's right right well you can ask brother Paul too but Paul John Peter Luke right it's it's not an easy job it's it's it's a hard journey amen amen we have to understand that God called us to work that's right he didn't call us to a picnic oh that's right we we have to understand that part because we cannot be a light Christian it's okay to try to be on a lightweight but when it comes to fullness of God and gospel and and the spirit we we have to get as much as we can and the only way to get that is to be connected Amen to the source not what the source is Christ himself he he he promised I'm not I'm not going to leave you alone even though you think you're alone even though you feel alone that's it we're not alone that's right but even even in those darkest moments in your life when you think you're struggling alone that's when the enemy tries to talk to you see what you've been doing all these years 20 years 30 years five years I don't know waste of time you should have been having fun oh I had that those conversations I don't know if I'm the only one but I I had those talks in my ear but you know what when I when I when I look back and I look this the kind of life that people in my generation live without God and then I see myself I say thank you Lord for this opportunity because even though I'm not the Christian that I would like to be but I'm not the worst Christian either we're we're in a process right what they say work work in progress that's right is is interesting how how for everything the blood means a lot even in the animal kingdom when when when the Lambs have babies the Sheep many of them are vulnerable and many of the moms die that's right and many of the babies die too so they they ended up having orphans babies with no mothers and mothers without babies so the shepherd tries to bring the orphan to one of the the moms and she reject she doesn't want him so the only way that the shepherd makes this mother to like the other the baby he has to be vigilant and when he Sayes the baby dies he cuts his throat and the blood goes into the back of the orphan so when the mother smells the blood of the her son that's what she says welcome hallelujah what does it tell you amen if we don't have the blood of Christ amen applied to us amen we rejected that's righten brother BR says that that when God sees down he ises the blood of Christ that's why we to have mercy amen even though we're a mess we messed up here we messed up there God sees the blood up the lamb amen amen hallelujah and his enemy is so busy trying to let us know how mess we are don't you think I know right amen but he's always trying to bring you down amen and and if we allow him to take control of us that's it we're lost that's it but we have to remember that that that that we're not holy because of our of our own merits or works that's right we Are Holy because the holies of holy came down that's it that's what brother says the mountain wasn't holy it was the Holy in the mountain it's the same way today we are not holy is the holy in US amen amen amen remember Paul writing letters to the Saints the Corinthians the Galatians he was calling them saints right yes because God was manifested through them amen amen that's that's the importance of the blood or the power of the blood amen I mean even in in if if the blood has a lot of importance on this Animal Kingdom how much more the blood of Jesus Christ in the humanity amen amen we you have to understand that that when when God sent his son he did it because he didn't want to lose Fellowship he knew that the fellowship was cut at the beginning and in in the Garden of Eden but he knew that that wasn't the end of it and we heard many times brother Brown says God wanted to display all his attributes that's right he had to be a way how God was going to manifest his attributes to begin with in order to be a god it has to be someone to adore him to pray praise him to be a Healer someone had to be sick right to be a savior how can he save a saved person that's what Jesus said the heal don't need doctors that's right if you have G help why you go to visit a doctor we last week or we went to a doctor dentist and and the nurse says are you happy to be here and Joe says yeah and she says nah nobody happy to see us and that's true that's the last place you want to go in Hebrews 913 it says for if the blood of bulls and goats and these ashes of Aer sprinkle in the unclean sanctifies for the purifying of of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offer himself without spot to God cleanse your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God I don't know about you but I can see myself there yes sir the blood is to come un clean me that's what I was saying earlier we have to know what kind of words we're saying what kind of songs we sing because the songs are messages yes sir and those words can become reality in your life there's a song says oh yes oh yes I'm a son of the king how many times we sing that song and we walk out of the church defeated amen did didn't wasn't you saying that you're a son of a king that's right right we we have to make conscience amen because we can become a comfortable Christian yeah and when and when the boat cheeks a little bit we don't like it right so God told Moses what to do Moses did it Moses did his part but the people not all of them did their part and I I always think and I would like to ask Moses how do you handle it two million people back then they didn't have WhatsApp so he had to yell God says this and when he finished his statement I can imagine Moses going to his stand and sit down try to recover his throat and then Jo Joshua Moses Moses sister so and so he she wants to talk to you brother so and so wants to talk to you and there's Moses coming up and say yes how can I help you well what we going to eat tomorrow there's no water didn't I just say what God told me what to do and I just delivered the message yes yeah Hallelujah I think that's what the saying came don't shoot the messenger Moses was only the messenger and the people coming back to him you know years ago I I never been a pastor but I and I don't want to but I've been close to good friends that are pastors and and one time there was this couple like pretty much every week was brother I have this and this problem if it wasn't him was was her the wife of the husband and the brother gave him the advice oh okay brother thank you the following week the same thing sister you did what I told you oh um no but brother is there another if the problem persist the the advice is the same until you do do some changes in your life that's what I was saying you cannot be a baby all years that's right you you born a baby then you you become a toddler am I right and then a kid and then a a young I mean you know the in a Christian Life is the same way that's what that's why Paul was saying you cannot live out out of milk only that's right yeah you have to give in meat that's right how many like meat here amen I was telling brother Paul that is his fault that I like steaks now I say I was I was fine CH with carneada you know the skinny and then I hang out with some white guys and they taught me how to eat and I just can't get rid of it now it's contagious but it says the whole Plan of Redemption rest upon the power of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ yes sir the blood is the only tissue that is unlimited and it moves within the body almost all the tissues are fixed such as muscle bone nerve Etc the blood alone is the only liquid tissue that can reach every single cell in the body and therefore all the members with the head and individual member as well now the blood has the blood has red cells that travels through the lungs come in contact with oxygen in the air we breathe and unite Loosely within the form o oxy globin you know what I'm trying to say in that form they treat it to all cells and they discharge the little cargo to the cell thus providing with the vital oxygen for combust combustion and Heat last time I was here there was a sister was a doctor is she here today okay well she can correct me later but then the blood picks up the waste products of the tissue the carbon Dio dioxide and the waste of the tissue metabolism that we may call the cell garbage but but there are also white cells those are standing army when an infection occurs anywhere in the body see see see the this is the interesting part I was saying you cut your head all this army goes to that wound you cut your toe all the Army Goes Down to the wound see the interesting of the blood it's it's is amazing how God designs the body to to cure himself yes sir oh but the the science is more intelligent than God you have to avoid this avoid that and do this and do this yeah right so this is the our standing army when an infection occurs anywhere in the body and the body is attacked you know when the enemy comes to attack you what is that's what I'm saying when God sees down what is he seeing is the blood amen isn't that amazing what what you have to do to have that such protection nothing what the teeth on the cross had to do this is marvelous yes remember me yes yeah he didn't have to do any anything else I mean he was hang hanging on the cross he didn't have time to go to water baptism yeah he didn't have time to go and return all that that he stole from people or whatever he did I don't know what he did what was his reward eternal life what was the reward of Moses eternal life amen see the burden of Moses had to Bear yeah right yeah and he this other guy here isn't not it strange how God works it is kind of unfair isn't it you you see that with a human eyes and say God you're you're not playing Fair here it's not up to you and me that's right that's right it's not how good you are amen amen it says the wise Hells are little soldiers that fight the germs and millions of these soldiers are killed and are Gather in one place where they form what is commonly known as pus when the dead in a form of pus has been spelled the blood and the other white cells come in and clean up the bottle F that's right and build a new tissue until all is healed amen hallelujah I mean I I I believe me I read this many many times and every time I go through it amazes me amen because I'm not I'm not I'm I'm not only talking about the the human flesh the the the capabilities of the human flesh can do in your body imagine the blood of Jesus Christ how much can do that's why this teeth from the cross had to do anything I mean your blood works in your body but the blood of Jesus Christ Works in everybody that's right I mean if you can retain all what I'm saying today because I'm probably not either but just take that part with you amen that's right don't let go the significance of the blood of Jesus Christ in your life that's amen that's right Hallelujah the same way the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ does for each and every believer in time of trouble that's right Revelations 12 says verse 10 then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ have come for the accuser of a brother who accused them before our God day and night has been cast down see that's what I was saying the enemy is always worried about not let you forget how bad guy you are how bad lady you are we know that born in sin shaping iniquity do you do you think Satan I'm going to forget that no every time I look in the mirror you know but God's grace he doesn't see me the way I see myself that's right he is a complete amen work amen right that's what God sees you that's how how he see you amen sometimes Satan comes and points out our sins and failures and make us see our shortcomings the sins of Flesh we been there's no doubt to make us doubt of our Salvation how can I overcome this this infection I see no good in myself and I have no confidence in myself that's it in my flesh that's right amen but I look to Calvary that's right I pled the blood that was shed for me and that light breaks through all depends on his blood amen amen so that blood fight it sends the Army and those white cells in the blood of Christ which puts the enemy to flight i i i acknowledge my sin I do not deny it then I claim the promise amen we we we we have to recognize we we're that's exactly right I messed upop Lord you know that was do you know that that was the difference between David and Saul yes when the prophet came to Saul and says you messed up what was his reaction look for excuses that's right oh we're so good for that you must stop here yes yes but but I did it because of this and that no right your pride arrogant that's it that's what it is but when the the prophet came to David he broke that's it that's right he torn his garments and he cried to the Lord that's right that's what I always tell my wife when we got into some kind of situation is say it's it's okay to cry but we don't cry to the circumstance right what good does it that that doesn't change the circumstance remains but would you cry to God Amen that's it that's a big difference that's right that's right what what what what what uh what happened to Hezekiah was Isaiah came says get your house in order you're going to die he was a prophet God spoke to him go tell him he did his job in he was leaving and then God say wait go give him another message wait what what what did you say Lord see the strange ways God works so that's why you you when you you when you're encountering a a bad situation in life don't think that that situation is going to be there forever right that's right cuz you're not going to be there forever either that's right Hallelujah so we have to learn how to trust in God Amen exactly so he came back and say he said uh what do you want me to tell him he said I saw his cry I saw how he humbled himself before me doesn't the Bible says that God exalt the ones who humble themselves yes sir amen and what happened to the pride ones amen how many Pride people are out there right you know sometimes sometimes we act prideful yeah and it's part of the human being but there is a a right way and a wrong way you know when I see my my son here playing I feel Pride because he's he's he's doing it for God he's not doing it for me I know I can play like him and I'm not going to be able to play cuz I'm getting older enough older and we get busier and busier in some other things you know what I don't know if I told you this before but I I went for four months I went to guitar class in Mexico and I wanted to be a guitar player or not for the world but to play in church but everywhere I go all the churches that I've been in nobody ask for a musician because that seity is already filled that's it and you know sometimes you you you put in your head some things that for God doesn't make any sense that's right and the things that God puts in your head and your heart doesn't make sense to you either that's right but that's why we have to come to an agreement with God that's right what do you want me to do Lord amen I was telling the brothers in in in Tri Cities the the other day that I'm happy to be just a spare tire so if there is a need of a song leader I can just jump in even though I don't sing but I I can do the job I know there's people can do better job but I'm not afraid of it if there is someone that needs to clean the church amen I'm ready that's right but I never thought I was going to be in front of people like you that speaking that's right and to me that's probably for you doesn't mean a lot but to me it's mon it means more than the world to me amen and I was also telling that I was so blessed when I found got in touch with brother Dave and found a little group that we're in I I feel like if I ever grow in the ministry that's what I feel like I've been more useful in God's work with a little group that's right it doesn't it doesn't matter the quantities I believe brother Bron says that the devil counts that's right and God Waits that's right so the enemy wants to see crowds of people why do you think that the the denominations are full of people cuz they choose want to hear something some entertainment they don't want to hear an adulterated word of God you say something to them they just walk out of here but as long as we speak the word of God that's it I'm not responsible that's right my responsibility being here is not to offend you in a personal way but if it comes from the Lord if you're offended I'm sorry that's right amen 1 John 1:9 says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness as essential the then is the blood in our bodies so essential is the the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ to the body of Christ too this fluid that can reach every single member of that body no matter how far those members way may be they might be removed from one another just as the blood supplies the food elements for nourishment in life and then carries the carries carries off the waste products and poisons due to cell metabolism to so to the blood of Lord Jesus Christ is there to every believer the only source of Life the only support and sustance of life but also the one who keeps us clean Revelation 7:14 so he said to me these are those these are the ones who come out out of the Great Tribulation and wash the robs and made them white in the blood of the Lamb yes thank blood is a constantly circulating fluid providing the body with nutrition oxygen and waste removal blood is mostly liquid with numerous cells and proteins suspended making the blood thicker than pure water water the average person has about 5 lit of blood more than a gallon a liquid called plasma makes up about half of the content of blood plasma contains proteins that help blood to clot transport substance through the blood and perform other functions blood plasma also contains glucose and other dissolvent nutrients about half of the blood volume is composed of blood cells red blood cells which carry oxygen to the tissues white blood cells which fight infections platelets smaller cells that help blood to clo blood is a conduct through the blood vessels arteries and veins blood prevent from clothing and blood vessels by their smoothness in the Finly turned balance of clothing factors how amazing all the job for the blood in your body to keep you clean if you get hurt just fight the infection there amazing God Amen you know the other thing I I I came to me is that when Joseph was in the jail he was there for no reason and he was there probably thinking what I've done wrong I've been trying to fulfill what my father taught me about God I rejected this crazy woman and I'm here for no reason and we again we come back to a process in order to Joseph to be a useful tool in the hands of God right he had to go through that amen amen because remember he was called by God but remember he was still was a human being I'm sure he had regrets against his brothers sure I'm pretty sure he was very mad about that woman so we have to work with ourselves so God send these two guys to prison the botler and the Baker and uh and again these guy these two guys had a reason why to be there not Joseph what did the thth on the cross say to the other thth we deserve to be here but this man he had done nothing right to be in this place there is Joseph between these two guys we know we all know the story says they had dreams both of them had dreams and this is the interesting part here the butler was the cup better for the king and the other one was the baker when Jesus and the Last Supper what did he say he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples and then he took the cup and he said drink amen this is my blood this is the Covenant amen that's it so the butler came to Joseph and says I have this dream and I have tree Vines and D you know the story and they say well that that means in 3 days you're going to be out of here and you're going to you're going to take back your job and the other guy wasn't he he here here's the attitude the C better was with the expecting what Joseph has to say about it about the dream and the baker guy was bitter yeah what what can you do I mean you're a cellmate like me and even the when Joseph say don't the dreams come from God and the the answer come from God too but he didn't care about what Joseph said but when he heard that he gave good news to the other guy here he comes oh what you have for me see the attitude you have to come the right attitude towards God the same way the teeth on on the other side of Jesus if he had the same attitude I don't know I don't know why Jesus will say the same thing you're going to be you both going to be with me but the attitude that's it that's right and so how many times we come to God in an arrogant way that's right Lord you didn't say that you was going to do this and if I was doing this so brightful and arrogant well unfortunately there were not good news for this other guy but this is the this is the the thing that I marel of what happened to the Bab guy he got hang and the birds ate his flesh so bring it back to the last supper with Jesus Jesus tore apart the bread which means this flesh we need to sacrifice this flesh we had to make a suffer to be able to receive the wine the holy spirit amen that's what that's what the uh Apostle Paul says that carinal Minds cannot understand spiritual things I think I had the scripture somewhere but we we we is I'm closing we have to understand that this flesh has nothing to do with the kingdom of God that's right that's right cuz this is goes It goes where he came from but what is inside of you right amen the spirit amen that's right now there's some things in life that you you and I cannot understand not not comprehend talking about the spiritual things but the good thing go that God got didn't call us to understand every single one of them do you think Moses understood what the serpent means right when he said TSS your stuff in the ground I I I don't think Moses say what what what the serpent is going to do this it's tons of snakes in in the desert no but he didn't he went and did it anyways the outcome of that action it wasn't up to Moses right you obey and leave it up to God that's right do what God told you what to do amen that's right and let God take care of the rest that's right amen and I I always like to bring this as a as an example if you have a a a legal problem you cannot go to the judge face to face right away there is a process and and you need to hire an attorney and they take all the time whatever they need to do but you leave your case in the hands of that attorney and then you just amen stay back amen why because if you go and try to help the attorney y say you know what you're not letting me do my job either you do it or I do it how many times we do the same thing with God that's right we bring with the problem bring the problem to God and say Lord I have this problem this situation and I'm living in and we don't let it go that's it if you brought it to God let it go that's right right because the way God is going to handle is going to be a better way than we can handle that's right am I don't know what what time I start but I'm going to I'm going to stop here I always have a the satisfaction that when I come here I live blessed so I I learned that every time when um someone asked me to come and speak I understood that it's God who is doing leading that person to do that amen am and at the beginning and I I used to refuse it but I I got to the point where it says lord it's got to be you so I have I have to that's right to do my part so you can do yours amen and I always grateful to brother Paul and grateful to you that have the patience with me and and and confidence we always want to do better for God and it doesn't matter where we are we we have to be uh focused that we are here just passing through right we are [Music] pilgrims on this Earth and as long as we have that mind set in that Kingdom that Jesus went and prepared for us everything that happens here we can care less I I watch a video over in Canada the the the the police cars are painted with the rainbow colors and then a guy is stops right next to them and say are you guys cops or only identify as cops you know how how bad the system is so don't expect to get better that's what I'm trying to say with this don't get comfy and I and I tell my kids and say I I'm 47 and some of you are older than me and I say there will be things that is going to happen that we like people like my age might not be able to see him but we have kids so we have to we have to make sure we give him the best of the best is thisen but they need to fall in love with God that's right with this God Amen they they don't need to fall in love with a religion that's right you raise kids under a religion Spirit they're going to bring for religious that's that's right that's right or they quit I had enough my parents telling me this is wrong this is wrong this is wrong that's it there's a brother says that we train our dogs and we let their kids free Go free and then at night we tie down our do and we hand the keys to the car to our kids to run wild it's it's not right this this world is not my home can we sing that is that okay if I ask Johnny to
