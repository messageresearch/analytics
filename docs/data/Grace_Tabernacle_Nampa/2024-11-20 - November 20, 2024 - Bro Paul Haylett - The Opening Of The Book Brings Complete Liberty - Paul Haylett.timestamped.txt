[30:11] tonight the name of Jesus
[30:14] Christ
[30:16] amen well I know I'll probably got a few
[30:19] things um to do but we'll just start
[30:22] right over here on the
[30:25] left sorry to do it that way Sister
[30:28] Sarah I bring to you so many
[30:33] greetings uh it is just phenomenal I
[30:37] didn't know that we had such famous
[30:40] people in the church but uh and then
[30:44] having said that so that I don't have to
[30:46] repeat it repeat it I I come along to
[30:48] brother Sergey sister ulia H and the and
[30:52] the kids that there is just people that
[30:54] I don't even remember names saying oh we
[30:57] had such a wonderful time and I'm
[30:59] thinking okay I'll bring greetings but I
[31:02] don't even know who you are so that
[31:04] makes it difficult but anyway that part
[31:07] just lovely and greetings uh from the
[31:11] churches uh in Saskatoon in Edmonton to
[31:14] the assembly here I think I'll probably
[31:16] need to repeat that on Sunday to to get
[31:19] that but uh the Lord just give us such a
[31:22] blessed and wonderful time uh we got to
[31:26] see I want take the time tonight to
[31:29] explain all of that but we got to see
[31:32] such incredible I would say Supernatural
[31:35] things happen you know when you don't
[31:37] really know what to preach on you don't
[31:39] know what to speak on and Lord lays
[31:41] something on your heart and you find out
[31:44] that it is just the perfect thing for
[31:46] the moment and and I I just say you know
[31:50] I I don't want to overemphasize that but
[31:52] when you're sitting there literally a
[31:54] couple hours before service and you
[31:56] don't know what to preach on and then
[31:59] the Lord comes on the scene lays
[32:00] something on your heart and then it
[32:02] turns out to be just very relevant to
[32:05] the body so that's wonderful and to you
[32:09] young ladies there was a host of young
[32:13] people that were like do you think they
[32:16] will remember
[32:17] us and I don't remember their names so
[32:21] we won't know whether you remember them
[32:23] or not but many many greetings from many
[32:26] young ladies uh in Edmonton and so I
[32:31] just uh say God bless you I want to
[32:33] speak tonight Lord help us to be very
[32:36] prompt thank you for the beautiful music
[32:39] and uh I want to speak to you on the
[32:40] opening of the book brings complete
[32:43] Liberty and uh as we'll look at this
[32:45] nothing new my brother and sister I'm
[32:47] finding that in the preaching of the
[32:49] word it's just uh very hard to dress up
[32:52] some new Fantastic Revelation it is here
[32:56] that we are hearing the word of again
[32:58] and again and God is reinforcing to you
[33:01] and I that um uh we are a part of the
[33:05] body of Christ and he has been with us
[33:08] and will be with us to the end and uh
[33:11] everything that we need he's already
[33:13] provided and we look at this turn to
[33:15] Isaiah 6 61 I mean 61
[33:22] 1-3 and
[33:25] um in that we'll just look real quick at
[33:27] these three
[33:28] verses now when you think
[33:31] about uh a prophet of God and speaking
[33:34] the word of God you know sometimes
[33:37] they'll speak in in a a figurative sense
[33:41] as they are God speaking and that's
[33:43] awesome and there'll be times that they
[33:46] will speak as the prophet but there's
[33:49] times that then that they put themselves
[33:51] into the equation that they are just a
[33:55] part of the plan that God is giving or
[33:58] living out and here in Isaiah he says
[34:01] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[34:04] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[34:06] preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has
[34:09] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[34:12] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[34:15] opening of the prison to them that are
[34:18] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[34:21] the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our
[34:24] God to comfort all that mourn to appoint
[34:28] unto them that mourn in Zion to give
[34:31] unto them Beauty for Ashes oil of joy
[34:35] for mourning the Garment of Praise for
[34:38] this Spirit of heaviness that they might
[34:40] be called Trees of Righteousness the
[34:43] planting of the Lord that he might be
[34:46] glorified Lord we just bless your word
[34:49] this evening your name amen you may be
[34:52] seated as we look at this I I think we
[34:54] should just Place ourselves right here
[34:57] in in these verses my brother and sister
[35:00] that God has come and given to you and I
[35:03] uh in this acceptable year of the Lord
[35:06] he's come to comfort us he's come to uh
[35:10] help us and and to bind up our
[35:13] brokenhearted spirits but I really
[35:15] wanted to focus this evening on those
[35:17] words to Proclaim Liberty to the
[35:20] captives and as we look in the day that
[35:23] we are living my brother and sister it
[35:25] it is uh in many ways very similar to
[35:29] the time down through the ages of of
[35:31] what has happened we see that how that
[35:34] God has come the people cry for
[35:36] deliverance and God comes on the scene
[35:38] and brings Deliverance now the prophet
[35:41] of God said that you'll look down
[35:43] through time and see that every Church
[35:45] age you'll see that every anointing of
[35:48] those times would come to a place that
[35:50] God would then allow them to actually
[35:53] turn more to a denominational Spirit but
[35:56] we also see where the prophet of God
[35:58] said that in the day that we're living
[36:00] this anointed word now this word my
[36:02] brother and sister the critic is going
[36:04] to look at it as though it was brother
[36:06] bram's word but you see they don't
[36:09] understand how God they don't understand
[36:11] God and they don't understand how God
[36:13] works so this word that come down into
[36:15] this day and the prophet of God says
[36:18] that this word will not denominate amen
[36:21] so he's not talking about a message to
[36:23] an age but he's talking now about a
[36:26] message to a bride amen can you imagine
[36:28] we look at the whole Spirit of
[36:30] denomination they serve without real
[36:33] understanding there's not Revelation
[36:35] there and in a way not a real desire to
[36:37] find it now imagine a marriage such that
[36:41] a wife gets up every day and Cooks
[36:43] breakfast and because why do you do that
[36:46] because I have
[36:48] to pretty soon I hope that went over
[36:53] flat really flat
[36:58] we're talking not about you okay but you
[37:01] see what it is to see how people serve
[37:04] God if they looked at that in the
[37:06] natural life face to face they would not
[37:09] like the action reaction and atmosphere
[37:12] that that would bring and yet the
[37:14] denominational spirit is basically one I
[37:17] serve God because I have to and there
[37:20] we'll see how that God moving down
[37:22] Through the Ages has declared this will
[37:24] never become a denomination and it's
[37:27] there that we're starting I believe that
[37:29] we are starting to see the real fruit of
[37:31] that because the spirit of denomination
[37:34] wants to move in is a constant pressure
[37:37] that is trying to come in and cause you
[37:40] and I to come to a place that that we by
[37:43] by a mechanical reaction serve God but
[37:46] yet to see the real word coming to the
[37:50] real believer brings about a a desire
[37:54] that we no matter what as it is uh uh no
[37:57] matter what unfolds around us we have
[38:00] this desire inside to please God it's
[38:03] not about I feel obligated but it's this
[38:06] heart's desire of who we are now I'm
[38:09] going to make a little jump in statement
[38:11] here so please follow me I'm going you
[38:14] to understand the seventh seal is our
[38:17] Liberty it is not a Doctrine amen it is
[38:22] if it was a Doctrine we would be going
[38:24] towards
[38:26] denominationalism but the the seventh
[38:28] seal is our Liberty amen it would be the
[38:32] same as saying tonight Jesus Christ is
[38:36] our Liberty amen the opening of the
[38:38] seals was a revelation of Jesus Christ
[38:41] to you and I so many people look at it
[38:44] as though it's simply a Doctrine my
[38:46] brother and sister it is not it is
[38:49] Christ himself coming to you and I and
[38:53] he as we look at this as Isaiah was
[38:56] speaking we can claim this scripture now
[38:59] for our day to Proclaim Liberty to the
[39:01] captives and we certainly if there ever
[39:04] was a world live in a captive world we
[39:06] live in a world where people are caught
[39:08] up by all kinds of isms and sisms and
[39:11] and identity crisis we see it really
[39:14] coming out radically in the identity
[39:16] realm that that people just struggling
[39:19] and you know a child will struggle if
[39:22] the parent struggles and so when we see
[39:25] a world now in a giant IDE identity
[39:27] crisis it's actually because the parent
[39:31] had an identity crisis and you say but
[39:33] how did that uh person get an identity
[39:36] crisis because their parent had an
[39:38] identity crisis and by the grace of God
[39:41] we as Sons and Daughters of God are not
[39:44] immune from from struggles and strife
[39:48] and not immune from our children uh
[39:50] coming up uh into the age that they're
[39:53] kind of starting to recognize or see
[39:56] their identity amen and of what they
[39:58] want to be I had a lot of fun with the
[40:01] young ladies in Edmonton uh well
[40:04] actually even in sasun but the young
[40:06] ladies in Edmonton were were just this
[40:08] very open group of young girls and and
[40:11] you know I I had a lot of fun what do
[40:13] you want to be when you grow up I don't
[40:15] know I'll wait till I grow up and then
[40:16] I'll tell you and you know things like
[40:19] that and you're like yeah no that's a
[40:21] good reasonable answer amen why should
[40:24] we five six years before we have to come
[40:26] to adulthood could uh you know try to
[40:28] figure out everything talk to another
[40:30] young lady I've known what I want to do
[40:32] since I was 10 years old and you know so
[40:35] it's such a variety that is there I'd
[40:38] have to vote with the one when I grow up
[40:39] I might have figured it out but anyway
[40:42] you look at this and and see what is
[40:44] happening in our day this whole identity
[40:47] of of people and places and you know
[40:50] Edmonton looks just like
[40:54] NAA you go to town everything's the same
[40:57] Saskatoon looks just like Edmonton just
[40:59] like NAA just like Phoenix just like
[41:02] wherever because there's one Spirit my
[41:05] brother and sister on the Earth today uh
[41:08] uh well there there's more than one
[41:10] Spirit two spirits in the church right
[41:12] but just one Spirit on the negative and
[41:14] one Spirit on the positive and so you
[41:16] can go to the far reaches I've been to
[41:19] the Far Far depth of Patagonia uh
[41:22] Argentina you're out in the literal me
[41:25] middle of nowhere and you you see
[41:27] exactly the same clothes the same music
[41:30] everything happening one Spirit now look
[41:33] at this what God is doing he's coming
[41:35] along in this day and while uh Satan is
[41:40] uh taking a people he's got people that
[41:43] he's anointing and they're declaring
[41:46] their Liberty uh these people are are
[41:48] saying you know what I'm so glad I I'm
[41:52] uh uh free I heard a conversation uh
[41:56] this this last week
[41:58] we're out amongst the public and this
[42:01] this woman says oh you know I'm so glad
[42:06] to be free from those holier than thou
[42:12] people looking for
[42:15] freedom but look at us my brother and
[42:17] sister in the counterbalance of this I'm
[42:20] so free from the spirit of leoa and I
[42:24] say thank you Lord every side is
[42:27] searching for freedom and without the
[42:29] anointing of the Holy Ghost my brother
[42:32] and sister we would probably be trying
[42:34] to find Freedom from the holier than
[42:36] thou amen well actually we want to be
[42:38] free from them anyhow but their view of
[42:42] freedom from the holier than thou is
[42:44] freedom from anyone that would even talk
[42:46] in public about Jesus Christ that's the
[42:49] freedom from the holier than thou that
[42:51] they are looking at and in John
[42:54] 836 the scripture says if the son
[42:57] therefore shall make you free ye shall
[43:00] be free indeed and we're looking at a
[43:02] world my brother and sister through
[43:04] entirely different lens than than the
[43:07] world here is uh because they're looking
[43:10] now uh uh uh going to church and these
[43:13] kind of things is no longer a freedom to
[43:16] mankind they actually view it as a
[43:18] bondage they're actually viewing the
[43:20] very presence or conversation of Jesus
[43:23] Christ as a bondage while the real
[43:26] believer a Christi Christian uh looks at
[43:28] this and says you know what I'm so
[43:30] thankful God has set me free that I can
[43:33] serve him amen and uh we'll just I want
[43:36] to move along quickly this evening not
[43:38] to keep everyone uh James 1:25 said but
[43:42] who so lookth into the perfect law of
[43:45] Liberty so if you're willing to look
[43:48] into the perfect law of Liberty and
[43:51] continueth therein in other words don't
[43:53] just look at it and pass on uh but
[43:56] continueth therein he being not a
[43:58] forgetful hear but a doer of the work
[44:01] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[44:04] and I say today that word is true we are
[44:07] blessed in our deed today God's got his
[44:10] hand of Mercy uh uh Upon Our Lives
[44:13] everything that we do amen so as you
[44:16] look here you want to look at Satan's
[44:19] work from the beginning for just a few
[44:21] minutes now from the very start Satan
[44:25] has uh decided he made his his stand to
[44:29] separate the people from the word at all
[44:31] cost he doesn't care what it is and and
[44:35] if just a very simple thing you can just
[44:37] look everything that there is every way
[44:41] possible Satan has anointed it to keep
[44:44] the people from the word of God because
[44:47] Satan himself actually has the
[44:49] revelation of Liberty in Jesus Christ
[44:51] and he wants to keep the world from that
[44:54] because he is not going to promote
[44:56] something that is is not his plan now we
[45:00] know that he is just a copycat
[45:02] everything there is out here when the
[45:04] world says that we have joy he's only
[45:07] trying to mimic the joy that God has
[45:09] given to Sons and Daughters of God uh
[45:11] when we are happy amen we have this
[45:15] brother Dwayne Fair uh took us to A A A
[45:20] Restaurant hotel that's on on the river
[45:23] there in town uh and it was a place that
[45:26] brother brother brandham actually
[45:28] preaches about and brother brandham says
[45:30] now uh you know they he said we met
[45:34] these girls on the street and uh they
[45:37] said something the order I was going to
[45:38] look the quote up kind of forgot but
[45:40] they're like Whoopi This Is The
[45:43] Life and uh in that tape you know that
[45:46] brother Brown saying see this is where
[45:48] they're caught because they think that's
[45:51] the life now these girls were
[45:55] drunk and very scantily
[45:58] dressed and saying this is the life my
[46:01] brother and sister but Sons and
[46:03] Daughters of God by the word when we are
[46:05] covered by the word clothed in the word
[46:08] we can kick our heels together and say
[46:10] this is the life aren't you glad tonight
[46:13] amen Satan promoting his plan but his
[46:16] plan was not for you amen God gave you a
[46:19] plan and that plan is what is holding
[46:21] you today and so Satan trying to
[46:24] separate at all cost every way possible
[46:27] now look at the world we live in today
[46:29] everything that you look out here in
[46:31] entertainment every this is this is
[46:34] Canada uh you know every Cafe every
[46:38] restaurant every whatever we sat down in
[46:41] had hockey on a screen playing now
[46:44] that's their sport they love it amen I
[46:47] told the brothers over and over again
[46:48] they're like what do you think brother
[46:49] Paul and I told them I said it looks
[46:51] like a fight has just broken out uh
[46:54] because that's that's the way it is you
[46:55] know and uh you look at that but you see
[46:59] there's billions poured into the
[47:00] entertainment all that entertainment is
[47:03] is to satisfy a soul that's
[47:05] empty amen I'm not speaking against
[47:07] Sports if people like sports a little
[47:09] bit that's fine but in the overall
[47:11] picture they're just trying to satisfy
[47:14] the emptiness in humanity and so it's
[47:17] there as they pour billions into this
[47:19] thing everything from stuff that we
[47:21] actually could enjoy to things that are
[47:24] so terrible that we would not even want
[47:27] to be Associated Satan pours billions
[47:29] into that and all it is is the
[47:31] distraction to fill the cup of people to
[47:35] keep them from seeing Christ that's all
[47:38] it is every one of these World
[47:41] distractions is just to keep people from
[47:43] having time and trying to satisfy they
[47:47] literally would rather be naked drunk
[47:50] walking down the street saying yippe
[47:52] this is the life than to stop amen but
[47:55] still you run into to some as we're on
[47:58] this trip uh we are there and uh we were
[48:02] sitting in a cafe and literally the
[48:05] waitress is like oh go ahead and pray
[48:07] I'll join in with you and uh kind you
[48:10] know a little different approach most
[48:12] people just act like it don't exist but
[48:14] this little lady she says nope I'm going
[48:16] to be right here and I'm going to be
[48:18] praying with you and so you see as the
[48:21] prophet of God said they actually have a
[48:22] hunger but they don't know how to
[48:24] satisfy it and uh we said here tonight
[48:27] and there shouldn't be one of us here
[48:29] tonight even in our Li limited group
[48:31] here that spiritually is hungry and
[48:34] would say I don't know how to satisfy it
[48:37] we have been given the open book we know
[48:40] how to satisfy that hunger and uh so
[48:44] Satan imagine this Satan's such a
[48:47] gracious
[48:50] guy he's trying to do you a
[48:54] favor and free you from the bondage of
[48:58] serving
[49:00] God let me help you get away from
[49:05] this see he must cringe at the words the
[49:08] Apostle Paul said I Paul a prisoner of
[49:12] Jesus Christ he's out here trying to
[49:15] help people not end up in the same
[49:17] position that Paul was in he doesn't
[49:19] want them to be a prisoner because
[49:21] that's just not right I was Shar shared
[49:26] with me a a a uh video uh uh of somebody
[49:30] had filmed and and was sharing it on the
[49:33] internet H and I had no idea that you
[49:36] people were such naughty people I had no
[49:39] idea that you had such devious uh ways
[49:43] about you I had no idea that you needed
[49:47] to be governed by some kind of body to
[49:50] control
[49:51] you but yet that what they would promote
[49:54] directly talking of the message
[49:57] that you're all in bondage and you all
[50:00] need delivered and there needs to be an
[50:02] oversight to make sure that you can
[50:05] completely escape from
[50:07] this well I tell you I I didn't know
[50:11] what to say after I saw that I thought I
[50:14] had no idea that I was such a
[50:18] position but I tell you after pondering
[50:21] it for a little bit the last few days
[50:23] I've decided being a prisoner of Jesus
[50:26] Christ
[50:27] is much preferable than being a prisoner
[50:32] of
[50:33] Satan it it is just such a marked
[50:36] difference you can with eyes that are
[50:38] open right thank God we can see amen
[50:41] every prisoner to Satan pays a heavy
[50:46] toll now you'd say but but the word says
[50:49] yes the word says we have to die but my
[50:52] brother and sister we're going to die
[50:53] somewhere I'd rather die sooner than
[50:56] later
[50:57] amen some men's sins go before them and
[51:00] some follow I would rather my sins if
[51:03] there be stuff in my life that that is
[51:05] not dealt with correctly or a point
[51:08] there I'd rather the Lord bring that up
[51:09] to me
[51:11] tonight amen than be in the judgment and
[51:14] find out that I was a prisoner to the
[51:16] wrong one so you look how this is what
[51:19] the word is today my brother and sister
[51:22] this is influenced a little bit by this
[51:24] video I will admit because of a
[51:26] perception that the world's trying to to
[51:29] share or promote now look at this I I
[51:32] look at this and and what is Liberty we
[51:35] have to stop and identify what Liberty
[51:37] is to each one of us if Liberty is to do
[51:40] anything we want to do then if we want
[51:43] to do something that is outside the W
[51:46] word we need to stop and figure out
[51:49] where is the
[51:51] disconnect cuz even Satan knows the word
[51:54] he he even experienced the word in fact
[51:57] uh the prophet says he knows it better
[51:58] than you do he knows you better than you
[52:01] know you but what is that my brother and
[52:04] sister that we would find in the world
[52:06] today that you're such an oddity that
[52:09] you should be over overpowered by the
[52:11] spirit of leod deia but yet God is
[52:15] taking you completely a different
[52:18] direction what is that we are not
[52:21] literal prisoners we don't have
[52:23] handcuffs on we don't ride a bus to and
[52:25] from our prison
[52:27] but my brother and sister to truly catch
[52:29] the revelation of what the Apostle Paul
[52:32] was saying when he was saying I Paul a
[52:35] prisoner of Jesus Christ Lord help us
[52:38] catch that Revelation amen not not my
[52:41] brother and sister to try and go back in
[52:43] history and delve in that because the
[52:45] very spirit that anointed Apostle Paul
[52:47] to say that in that day that same spirit
[52:49] is here today and it's impressing you
[52:52] might say or or it's around us leading
[52:55] us to be able to come one day and be
[52:57] able to say that whatever name you put
[52:59] I'm glad I can just repeat it I Paul a
[53:02] prisoner of Jesus Christ not ashamed to
[53:05] be a prisoner now my brother and sister
[53:07] one thing I garnished out of this little
[53:09] video is um while they have focused upon
[53:12] the message they focused on the people
[53:14] of the message uh what they won't do is
[53:17] go focus on all the rest of the
[53:20] denominations because you see if they
[53:22] think they've dug up something against
[53:24] the message wow when they start digging
[53:27] in the spirit of leoda in the
[53:29] denominational Spirit but they're not
[53:31] going to go there because there is
[53:33] nothing to be gained because Satan has
[53:36] already LED them into what they believe
[53:39] is their Redemption now one thing that
[53:42] brother uh
[53:46] uh as we were looking in things talking
[53:49] about things brother Eugene one thing
[53:50] that he he laid out and I I I'll
[53:53] probably plagiarize him a little bit
[53:55] without going back and in into his own
[53:57] sermons but brother Eugene was pressing
[54:00] on this point and that point was it's
[54:04] only through the male or husband is
[54:08] their
[54:10] Redemption very very plain simple
[54:14] thought and you go through the Bible
[54:17] everything comes back to the
[54:20] man for
[54:22] Redemption now if the man himself will
[54:25] not pursue Redemption and he withholds
[54:27] the Redemption from his wife from his
[54:31] children brother Eugene has a unique way
[54:34] of speaking caught me so off guard I had
[54:36] to stop and shake my head a little bit
[54:39] he said Paul a man who won't bring
[54:42] Redemption to his family is
[54:47] evil I thought wow that's pretty strong
[54:50] words because you see under the headship
[54:54] of Jesus Christ that is that man's Duty
[54:58] now I want to ask you have we been
[55:00] brought as as the church that makes us
[55:03] female amen have we been brought
[55:05] Redemption amen God's grace and God's
[55:08] mercy in this generation the Lord come
[55:11] down and brought the word of redemption
[55:13] to us and made it relevant to our day
[55:15] relevant to our lives that we can stop
[55:18] today and truly say uh uh you know your
[55:21] name in there I am a prisoner to Christ
[55:24] because he has purchased my Redemption
[55:27] and I stand here today under that
[55:29] Redemption knowing his blood will cover
[55:32] me and in that how beautiful that is and
[55:36] uh so Satan wants you free from the
[55:39] bondage of serving God and if you stop
[55:42] and look at that in simple terms uh of
[55:44] our life every day everything that would
[55:47] pull us away from the
[55:50] word away from the word is Satan plain
[55:55] and simple if we just look at it not
[55:56] like oh this is a good movie this is
[55:58] good music this is good this these
[56:00] clothes are a little on the edge but no
[56:02] if you just stop and say you know what
[56:04] what's trying to pull me away today is
[56:07] Satan however he's masqueraded himself
[56:11] however he's presented himself to cut it
[56:14] right down to the simplest it's Satan
[56:17] yes because you see now I'm not picking
[56:20] on any sisters forgive me I'm I'm not
[56:22] preaching any clothesline but my brother
[56:24] and sister when you see a sister
[56:28] converted I met a few that have been
[56:30] serving the lord for very long at all
[56:33] and of course Pastor to pastor we get to
[56:36] kind of discuss a few things in the
[56:39] perspective of it and brother Eugene
[56:42] made a comment about a certain sister
[56:43] hasn't been saved all that long and he
[56:46] says you know not once have I had to
[56:48] preach how you should dress to this
[56:51] sister she gave her heart to the Lord
[56:54] she'd come into the assembly into the
[56:55] body of Believers and God did a real
[56:58] work in her life and she
[57:01] changed you see that's what God's doing
[57:03] he's clothing us amen he's not
[57:06] unclothing us I'm thinking of the word
[57:08] now bear with me he's he's the word has
[57:12] come to clothe us not unclo us and so we
[57:16] see how God working in this whole plan
[57:18] so it's the opening of the book my
[57:21] brother and sister that believe brings
[57:23] complete Liberty we don't even have
[57:25] freedom to really worship God until we
[57:28] can see what the book has for us and so
[57:31] it's there if uh uh uh Ephesians 3:1 if
[57:35] you want to look at uh that about uh the
[57:37] Apostle Paul being a prisoner now the
[57:40] Lord has provided
[57:42] remedy isn't this amazing even before we
[57:47] had cause or need of a remedy it was
[57:50] provided for us God's laid that remedy
[57:54] out before us and he says you know know
[57:56] what by my
[57:58] blood by my blood I will pay every debt
[58:03] that you
[58:04] have now if you thought about it in the
[58:07] natural and somebody says you know what
[58:09] I'm actually going to let you keep on
[58:11] being a debor until you catch the
[58:13] revelation of who you are in the natural
[58:17] you imagine that people would be
[58:19] just it's not my money but when we come
[58:23] to this place that we recognize who we
[58:25] are in Jesus Christ Christ and he pays
[58:27] every debt now I don't mean to to step
[58:30] down on anybody cuz I I would be right
[58:33] there with
[58:34] you but we are still collecting
[58:38] debts or creating let me say create not
[58:41] collect we're still creating debt in
[58:45] other words if I could say it really
[58:46] blunt the blood of Jesus Christ had to
[58:49] cover me
[58:50] today not back when I was some rank
[58:53] unbeliever this that and the other but
[58:55] he's covering me today everything that I
[58:57] have in the prophet of God you backslide
[58:59] daily so the blood of Jesus Christ is
[59:02] still right here the book is open and
[59:05] he's still purchasing our Liberty
[59:07] tonight amen I love that it's not a
[59:10] condemnation thing it's not something to
[59:13] frown about because this is the love of
[59:15] Christ to you and I that he loves us so
[59:18] much he continues to pay the debt and
[59:20] brings us right into full Redemption him
[59:23] being the male and the church being the
[59:26] female and he keeps coming and bringing
[59:29] Redemption just as we should in our own
[59:32] families and in the church itself we
[59:35] should be bringing Redemption amen when
[59:38] we see a church that stops bringing
[59:40] Redemption and brings law you're seeing
[59:43] a church that's out of balance with the
[59:45] word of God now look at this there's not
[59:49] a on size fits all in our spiritual life
[59:53] is there
[59:58] wouldn't that be nice if there
[1:00:01] was this one size fits all but I'm sorry
[1:00:06] some people are just
[1:00:08] strange they have whole different
[1:00:11] thing it's not just simple it's
[1:00:16] complex did you know that you can
[1:00:19] actually Trace complexes for Generations
[1:00:26] we get saved we think that's the end of
[1:00:28] the complex my brother and sister being
[1:00:30] saved is not the end of the complex it's
[1:00:32] when we are willing to die to our own
[1:00:38] self and only then now look this is kind
[1:00:41] of straightforward stuff when the
[1:00:44] complex when you submit that complex and
[1:00:48] it dies my brother and sisters Satan
[1:00:50] will offer you day after day week after
[1:00:53] week month and year uh uh opport to
[1:00:56] resurrect that
[1:00:58] complex but God wants you and I to go
[1:01:01] back in the book and he says you know
[1:01:03] what eat the book yes eat the book The
[1:01:08] Deliverance my brother and sister is in
[1:01:10] Eating the open book it's not in a a
[1:01:14] psychological type thing it's not in a I
[1:01:16] can power my way through this it's not
[1:01:19] it's my Daddy's fault or my mama's fault
[1:01:21] or it's my wife's fault or my husband's
[1:01:24] fault or people go crazy and and say
[1:01:26] it's their children's fault my brother
[1:01:28] and sister the fault is not eating the
[1:01:30] book and once the book was opened the
[1:01:33] remedy is personal inside of the book
[1:01:37] for you and I I don't have to go and say
[1:01:39] what's the average reaction of a message
[1:01:41] believer I can go in and dig into the
[1:01:44] word for myself and God Deliver us to be
[1:01:47] able to take the word for our everyday
[1:01:50] life now we're human so we have a lot of
[1:01:52] similarities and that's exactly where it
[1:01:55] ends
[1:02:00] see when the prophet takes us through
[1:02:02] the horse
[1:02:03] riders many people took that and said oh
[1:02:07] so this is from age to age oh we're
[1:02:11] seeing what happened there this is from
[1:02:13] age to age but do you realize the
[1:02:15] prophet of God was also revealing all of
[1:02:18] the spirits associated with those horse
[1:02:22] riders and coming down to the place see
[1:02:25] that's why it was so important that God
[1:02:27] corrected brother brandham when when he
[1:02:30] had his idea of what the horse riders
[1:02:32] were the Holy Spirit comes in corrects
[1:02:35] that because you see you need to
[1:02:37] recognize the devil that's trying to
[1:02:39] keep you out of the book you got to know
[1:02:42] what the devil is that's trying to close
[1:02:45] the book on you you see we don't have to
[1:02:48] have the book taken away from us my
[1:02:50] brother and sister but if the book is
[1:02:52] now closed we will not get the remedy
[1:02:54] that God has for us so the open book
[1:02:58] brings a complete Liberty amen but here
[1:03:01] look at this when you expose the move
[1:03:04] behind it it really helps us to
[1:03:08] understand what is the move behind
[1:03:10] it and I'm going to preach it very
[1:03:13] simplistic
[1:03:15] tonight it's just breaking of
[1:03:19] Fellowship it don't matter if we're
[1:03:21] talking in the spiritual realm or we're
[1:03:22] talking relationships in marriage
[1:03:25] relationships with children even
[1:03:27] relationship with us amongst our
[1:03:31] brothers and sisters Satan's all about
[1:03:34] breaking
[1:03:35] fellowship and so anytime now how do I
[1:03:39] say this I well just say it Paul anytime
[1:03:43] we create an atmosphere say in the
[1:03:46] church that breaks
[1:03:48] Fellowship that didn't come from
[1:03:51] God you can't even you can't even can I
[1:03:53] just be blunt you can't even and say
[1:03:56] well we're the more spiritual of the
[1:03:57] church and we don't want to be around
[1:03:59] the unbelief my brother and sister with
[1:04:01] that atmosphere that's not Christ amen
[1:04:05] that's Satan cuz he's trying to break
[1:04:08] fellowship and so you know when you
[1:04:11] Define fellowship you know the prophet
[1:04:13] of God said you know two guys one ship
[1:04:16] uh it doesn't matter if the guy's in the
[1:04:18] front or the back or the left or the
[1:04:21] right if he's in that ship God's got you
[1:04:24] in the same boat with them for a
[1:04:27] purpose in other words sometimes you
[1:04:29] know the young mothers as scripture says
[1:04:31] need to be schooled by the older sisters
[1:04:35] to school the younger
[1:04:38] sisters how often do old sisters and
[1:04:41] young sisters hang out together just in
[1:04:43] a natural sense right it's not a natural
[1:04:47] relationship in an overall sense young
[1:04:50] sisters with children well they kind of
[1:04:53] H hang out with young sisters with
[1:04:55] children
[1:04:56] vice versa but you look what God's doing
[1:04:59] he's trying to build a complete
[1:05:02] body in this
[1:05:05] church not a fragmented body but a
[1:05:09] complete body now you and I where we
[1:05:13] come into this equation besides being
[1:05:15] submitted to the word we have to
[1:05:17] willingly be partakers of creating a
[1:05:21] complete
[1:05:22] body and if we're not willing to be a
[1:05:25] part of complete body well as God would
[1:05:28] be if you won't do it God will bring
[1:05:30] someone in and put them into that
[1:05:31] position but you see when we talk about
[1:05:33] a complete body it's not just natural
[1:05:36] but we're looking at spiritual we need
[1:05:39] every single individual to be in their
[1:05:42] correct place now I don't know about you
[1:05:45] and I'm not speaking down to to anyone
[1:05:47] or any circumstance please misunder
[1:05:49] don't misunderstand me but you know
[1:05:52] lately I've been feeling like there's
[1:05:53] just a little something missing and
[1:05:55] maybe maybe it's
[1:05:57] me y'all don't have to shake your head
[1:05:59] you don't have to agree or nothing I'm
[1:06:00] just going to voice my thoughts
[1:06:02] something
[1:06:04] missing but did you know it could be
[1:06:06] just as simple as we're not willing to
[1:06:10] become one with each
[1:06:11] other we're not willing to come and bear
[1:06:15] one another's
[1:06:17] burden in other words they made the
[1:06:20] decision let them pay the
[1:06:22] price that's not the gospel
[1:06:27] what is the message my brother and
[1:06:30] sister what is the message is it just
[1:06:33] our family are for no more what what is
[1:06:36] the message is it all just a list of
[1:06:38] doctrines is it all that we dress right
[1:06:40] talk right look right what is the
[1:06:46] message we need to put Christ back in
[1:06:48] the messag and I'm not talking the
[1:06:51] doctrine side of it my brother and
[1:06:52] sister we need to put Christ back in it
[1:06:54] you'll know them by their love you'll
[1:06:57] know them by certain characteristics and
[1:07:00] and
[1:07:01] Satan is here to try to break that
[1:07:05] fellowship at all costs we don't have to
[1:07:07] have wrong Doctrine right we we don't
[1:07:09] have to go off into some Fringe Movement
[1:07:12] we don't have to do this but if Satan
[1:07:14] can rob the unity out of the body take
[1:07:17] the love out of the body of Christ we
[1:07:20] won't care about what happens to
[1:07:23] others I had a situation I won't go too
[1:07:26] deep
[1:07:28] in but a brother thanked me for what we
[1:07:30] had preached and one evening there in
[1:07:34] Canada and he says I didn't even see it
[1:07:38] but that's what I was
[1:07:40] becoming I was worried about my family
[1:07:43] and no one
[1:07:46] else and God dealt with him and that's a
[1:07:49] little bit why I chose to preach along
[1:07:50] these lines tonight is we've got to go
[1:07:53] beyond that what if Christ only came for
[1:07:55] those he wanted to care
[1:07:58] for and that list didn't include
[1:08:03] us and we lived right we believed the
[1:08:06] word we did everything but we weren't on
[1:08:09] the list you'd say well of course that's
[1:08:12] just that's not predestination or that's
[1:08:13] this and no brother I hope you catch
[1:08:16] what I'm saying maybe a poor analogy but
[1:08:18] you see we're the bride of Christ we are
[1:08:22] Christ's love expressed on the Earth
[1:08:25] Earth
[1:08:28] today so either we've missed
[1:08:30] it or Satan's been doing a really good
[1:08:33] job and it's time the Lord's now pushing
[1:08:36] back and saying I'm not going to let
[1:08:38] that be the
[1:08:42] culture you see those horse riders when
[1:08:45] the prophet laid that out as much he was
[1:08:47] exposing the
[1:08:50] movement behind the horse riders what
[1:08:53] they
[1:08:54] represented and yet those spirits still
[1:08:56] operate amen but the Lord's still
[1:08:59] exposing the spirits so by God's grace
[1:09:03] amen we can still moving
[1:09:06] now the holy spirit's still stirring
[1:09:09] people is he not
[1:09:12] amen if we let
[1:09:15] him if we let him he still does the work
[1:09:20] now here again finishing my little bit
[1:09:22] pointed statement forgive me if we feel
[1:09:24] service has been a little dry or there's
[1:09:26] been a little something we got to
[1:09:28] realize it's not what's wrong with what
[1:09:30] God's doing it's what we're not letting
[1:09:32] him
[1:09:36] do and as we look at that now I I just
[1:09:40] can't help but relate this to you in a
[1:09:43] service there was particular man come to
[1:09:46] the Altar and we spent time with him
[1:09:49] there praying and stuff and later the
[1:09:51] pastor says um that really was a move of
[1:09:57] God because otherwise because of who
[1:09:59] that man is you could not have pried him
[1:10:01] out of his Pew you could not have forced
[1:10:04] him to walk to the front and you could
[1:10:06] not have made him sit there in the altar
[1:10:10] cry out to
[1:10:11] God but how many times has God come and
[1:10:15] we just didn't feel
[1:10:19] like I just don't feel like
[1:10:22] responding I don't feel like walking up
[1:10:25] front to an altar I don't feel like
[1:10:27] praying through we don't feel my brother
[1:10:30] and sister I'm just pondering I wonder
[1:10:33] how many times we actually miss the
[1:10:36] moving of the holy spirit in our
[1:10:38] midst and then what scares me is how
[1:10:41] much influence did my attitude have on
[1:10:45] that Lord help us we got to come to the
[1:10:49] place we care so much about everyone in
[1:10:51] this church there's no family no
[1:10:53] individual of a higher value that we
[1:10:56] could come and when we see a family in
[1:10:59] distress we should become in distress
[1:11:01] when we see a family that's struggling
[1:11:03] through issues with children or Finance
[1:11:05] or whatever amen maybe you don't have
[1:11:07] the money to contribute to a better
[1:11:09] solution for them that way but you got
[1:11:11] prayers and they cost us nothing but our
[1:11:13] own
[1:11:14] will and when we will will ourself into
[1:11:18] their need then we help change the
[1:11:21] situation not exciting tonight is it
[1:11:25] but sometimes when the wheelbarrow gets
[1:11:26] full you have to take it
[1:11:28] somewhere
[1:11:30] amen I say God's still stirring his
[1:11:33] people amen and we see it it sometimes
[1:11:37] it's in very simple ways that God is
[1:11:40] stirring people well our our young
[1:11:43] people wow our young people are so
[1:11:47] rebellious you could at least
[1:11:52] smile I hope this doesn't hurt anybody's
[1:11:54] feelings but our young people are so
[1:11:56] rebellious around here but if we look in
[1:11:58] God's mirror we realize they're only
[1:12:02] reflecting
[1:12:06] us and we want to blame them I've just
[1:12:08] been blaming you brother
[1:12:11] Titus sister via so
[1:12:15] rebellious and then as parents we look
[1:12:18] in the mirror and all we see is a
[1:12:21] self-righteous
[1:12:23] picture but when God slides his
[1:12:27] word children are rebellious because
[1:12:30] that's the atmosphere they live
[1:12:33] in but we're not
[1:12:37] rebellious maybe I should leave that for
[1:12:39] another
[1:12:40] service but you see my brother and
[1:12:43] sister this is how close our action and
[1:12:46] reaction is and when the open word comes
[1:12:51] we need to be able to be open enough to
[1:12:53] receive the open Word word now I would
[1:12:56] say this figuratively uh how many of us
[1:12:59] would want to be completely free amen we
[1:13:01] want to have absolute complete Liberty
[1:13:04] in Jesus Christ then we have to set the
[1:13:07] stage to receive absolute complete
[1:13:11] Liberty or we can take it a bit here and
[1:13:14] a bit there and hope that it all comes
[1:13:19] together maybe tonight I'm just
[1:13:21] preaching what's been rattling around in
[1:13:23] my head I don't know
[1:13:26] but you see Satan would desire to
[1:13:27] replace a real experience with a
[1:13:30] religious
[1:13:32] experience amen and I'll tell you today
[1:13:34] when the book is open and God is working
[1:13:36] he replaces religious experiences with
[1:13:39] real experience amen exact opposites
[1:13:42] between the two now brother Bram says in
[1:13:45] the identified Christ of all ages but
[1:13:48] when you find Christian people where the
[1:13:50] holy spirit is no matter what nation or
[1:13:54] how far in the jungle or whatever it is
[1:13:57] they do the same thing you do when you
[1:14:00] receive the Holy Ghost they do the same
[1:14:03] thing they have the same Liberty they do
[1:14:06] they believe the same way and act the
[1:14:09] same way that any Christian does when he
[1:14:11] receives Christ and so I bring this
[1:14:14] quote to you in this context and I hope
[1:14:16] youall forgive me I'm I'm not trying to
[1:14:17] lean on you or maybe I'm leaning on
[1:14:21] myself but we'll visit somewhere and say
[1:14:24] my that church has such Liberty and it's
[1:14:27] just so open and
[1:14:28] loving why don't we ask
[1:14:31] ourselves what's missing from
[1:14:34] us not looking to see what they've got
[1:14:37] but look for what's missing for us
[1:14:40] because I'll tell you boy I hope this
[1:14:42] don't go back to
[1:14:45] Canadians we preached in some very
[1:14:48] wonderfully open Services where I just
[1:14:51] preach with such
[1:14:52] Liberty and they have kid problems and
[1:14:55] financial problems and they have all
[1:14:57] kinds of problems but what they're
[1:14:59] Desiring is a
[1:15:02] solution they're actually looking for
[1:15:05] God's
[1:15:06] personalized uh uh solution now I guess
[1:15:10] that's just the words that stuck in my
[1:15:12] brain to their life they're actively
[1:15:15] pursuing God's will in their
[1:15:18] life and they have Liberty now if we're
[1:15:21] not careful we get looking at our
[1:15:24] problems I know you guys don't have
[1:15:25] problems but other other people do but
[1:15:28] we get to looking at our problems and
[1:15:30] our problem consume
[1:15:33] us and it's really bad when our problem
[1:15:37] fringes into someone else's life and the
[1:15:41] easiest solution is to blame them I know
[1:15:43] you've never done
[1:15:45] that I remember years
[1:15:48] ago preaching a place down south and
[1:15:50] just mentioning some things like that of
[1:15:53] who has decided that somebody else's
[1:15:55] family is the
[1:15:57] fault and you know it's actually funny I
[1:16:01] say it as funny cuz I was remember well
[1:16:03] I'm standing you know down about like
[1:16:05] this and uh I'm looking down the church
[1:16:08] and sister over on this side and a
[1:16:10] sister over on this side and they just
[1:16:12] both turn and look at each
[1:16:15] other and I it's like I think we've
[1:16:18] identified the
[1:16:20] spirit but you know the beauty of it the
[1:16:23] Holy Spirit come in that that service
[1:16:26] and when that service was over as one
[1:16:29] sister walked out and went across the
[1:16:30] parking lot to her car the other sister
[1:16:33] pursued
[1:16:34] her and repented in the parking lot and
[1:16:38] before that was over they're out there
[1:16:39] holding on to each other just crying and
[1:16:43] wondering how it was that they allowed
[1:16:45] that
[1:16:46] Spirit but you see it's when the book is
[1:16:49] open we're able to start letting these
[1:16:52] things go and God starts to bring us
[1:16:54] into the correct position as long as we
[1:16:56] will not allow the open book to change
[1:16:59] our life we have these stries but when
[1:17:02] we come to a place we actually care
[1:17:04] enough about the brother or sister
[1:17:08] no when we actually come to the place we
[1:17:10] care enough about the
[1:17:12] word then we start to move forward and
[1:17:15] these things start to Fall Away we we
[1:17:18] sing the song These Chains are Gone amen
[1:17:22] well my brother and sister we want the
[1:17:24] chains gone
[1:17:25] let's let the open book bring complete
[1:17:28] Liberty to us and truly then our chains
[1:17:32] will be gone hallelujah amen I've got so
[1:17:36] much more here I think it's a preacher
[1:17:38] plague amen I just barely scratch the
[1:17:41] surface but I must have too
[1:17:44] much Amen in these last days God
[1:17:47] replaced a religious experience with a
[1:17:50] real experience can we say Amen to that
[1:17:53] amen not what felt right
[1:17:56] but literally coming to the place we
[1:17:57] recognize Christ in
[1:17:59] us see we can't say that we have a
[1:18:02] Christlike spirit and it's bitter right
[1:18:06] Bitter Water good water same well nope
[1:18:09] don't happen we've got to come to the
[1:18:11] place we recognize but the half I wanted
[1:18:14] didn't get to
[1:18:16] sorry comes down to this simple thought
[1:18:20] when we recognize not talk about sister
[1:18:24] V if you would come uh not talk about
[1:18:28] but truly
[1:18:30] recognize Christ in
[1:18:32] you it will change every single one of
[1:18:36] us we will no longer look at life the
[1:18:39] same when we truly honestly recognize
[1:18:43] Christ in you the hope of glory that's
[1:18:47] what the book
[1:18:48] says and the book is Christ Our Lord
[1:18:51] Jesus is sitting here tonight saying I
[1:18:53] want you just to take my
[1:18:56] spirit and that doesn't mean you always
[1:18:58] have to pamper
[1:19:00] someone but that
[1:19:03] spirit will change our life and I want
[1:19:08] for Grace Tabernacle for my own life my
[1:19:11] own marriage my own children my own
[1:19:14] grandchildren I want complete
[1:19:18] Liberty to be able to reach out as it
