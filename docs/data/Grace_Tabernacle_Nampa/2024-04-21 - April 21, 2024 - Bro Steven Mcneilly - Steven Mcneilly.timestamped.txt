[35:18] people um for about i' say a couple
[35:23] weeks ago you know is really when God
[35:26] really dealt with with me because I had
[35:29] so many times even after receiving the
[35:32] Holy Spirit I had still just fought this
[35:34] battle and the devil just kept dragging
[35:37] me down with it
[35:39] and I would stand on faith and I would
[35:42] say NOP I'm not going to do this anymore
[35:45] I believe and I would truly thought I
[35:47] had faith and then I would fall again
[35:50] and it happened multiple times and I
[35:54] began to feel hopeless like I would
[35:57] never be be able to stop and I would I
[35:59] would go to a camp and I'd catch on fire
[36:01] for God and I'd be like wow this changes
[36:04] everything and then nothing changed and
[36:06] then I
[36:07] would I would sorry um I would just go
[36:11] to a service and the preacher would be
[36:14] talking about my exact scenario and I'm
[36:15] like wow that's amazing and still
[36:18] nothing would change and it was a
[36:20] problem for me and I didn't know how to
[36:22] stop it until finally one day I really I
[36:26] truly discovered
[36:28] the problem of it because I was I was in
[36:33] a very little place and I don't know why
[36:36] but I just by myself I just said loud I
[36:38] was like I'm afraid I don't I don't know
[36:41] I'm afraid and then I just said fear not
[36:44] for I'll be with you even in you till
[36:46] the end of the world and then I realized
[36:49] that was the problem it was the fear
[36:52] fear is
[36:53] just unbelief packaged in a different
[36:56] form
[36:59] that's it took that realization for me
[37:01] because I was always afraid of falling
[37:04] back into my sin because I
[37:08] would I thought I believed but then I'd
[37:10] fall and the devil would say oh look at
[37:12] this time you thought you believed then
[37:13] you thought you believe then how do you
[37:15] know you're not believing now and so
[37:19] finally I was really struggling and I
[37:21] was
[37:22] just had a long talk with the Lord I was
[37:25] driving home from school was like 30
[37:26] minutes so I had a while to talk talk
[37:27] with him and I just said I don't care
[37:31] how many times I thought I believed in
[37:32] the past and fell I don't care how many
[37:35] times I tried and failed I have faith
[37:37] and I believe nothing can change that
[37:40] and I just had to stand firm on that I
[37:43] had to recognize that it was just this
[37:46] fear that God was or sorry that the
[37:48] devil was just holding down on me it's
[37:50] his the same tactic that he always used
[37:53] before when I was younger I struggled
[37:55] with us for a long time and before the
[37:57] fear was oh I can't tell anyone because
[37:59] everyone's going to hate me and that was
[38:02] the fear then and then the fear was the
[38:04] fear of falling back into it always the
[38:06] fear of pulling it back in
[38:09] and really once I could recognize that
[38:11] it was just that fear that the devil was
[38:14] holding me under I was able to give it
[38:17] to God because he has not given us a
[38:20] spirit of fear he has given us the
[38:23] spirit of
[38:25] righteousness and there in that chapter
[38:28] in I believe it's Ezekiel where it says
[38:30] I will remove from you Your Heart of
[38:32] Stone and give you a heart of Flesh
[38:33] later on in that chapter it goes on to
[38:35] say and you will remember the acts that
[38:37] you did that were evil and you will
[38:38] loathe yourselves for it that was me I
[38:41] hated myself and I
[38:43] was I like brother Steven was preaching
[38:46] to the people yesterday he was talking
[38:49] about
[38:50] how there will be times where you don't
[38:52] even feel like you're a Christian you
[38:54] don't you have just the devil really
[38:57] holds you down and that's what he was
[38:59] doing to me and once I was able to give
[39:02] that fear up and and just stand in faith
[39:06] I
[39:08] was The Temptations didn't stop but the
[39:11] weakness was gone so the devil was still
[39:14] trying but I could tell he lost
[39:17] immediately and it's just that fear that
[39:21] if just have to defeat it because that
[39:24] is I think the biggest tactic of the
[39:26] enemy
[39:28] almost it is just unbelief this same
[39:31] tactics he's always used just trying to
[39:34] change it
[39:35] but I don't know I think that's
[39:39] [Applause]
[39:45] all amen when we
[39:47] can grasp the word he's already told us
[39:52] who we are he's told us where we're
[39:55] going he's told us that
[39:59] whatever we go through he's going to
[40:00] take care of us amen once we can believe
[40:04] that we're Unstoppable amen amen

[50:19] blessing for you this
[50:21] morning brother Ron sends his greetings
[50:24] to the Saints here that Grace
[50:30] Tabernacle praise the Lord
[50:33] Deuteronomy chapter 8 we'll read verses
[50:35] 1
[50:37] through6 and it says all the
[50:39] Commandments which I command thee this
[50:41] day shall ye observe and do that ye may
[50:46] live and multiply and go in and possess
[50:49] the land which the Lord swear onto your
[50:53] fathers and thou shalt remember all the
[50:55] way which the Lord Lord thy God LED thee
[50:58] these 40 years in the wilderness notice
[51:01] why he led them in the wilderness to
[51:04] Humble thee and to prove thee and to
[51:08] know what was in thine heart whether
[51:10] thou wouldest keep his Commandments or
[51:14] no understand that God knows exactly
[51:17] what's in your heart but sometimes he
[51:20] needs to take us through a Wilderness
[51:23] for us to recognize what is in our
[51:25] hearts cuz God already
[51:29] knows and he humbled thee and suffered
[51:32] thee to hunger and fed thee with Mana
[51:35] which thou knewest not neither did thy
[51:37] fathers know that he might make thee
[51:40] know that man does not live by bread
[51:43] only but by every word that proceedeth
[51:47] out of the mouth of the Lord doth Man
[51:49] live and the congregation said amen amen
[51:52] thy reignment waxed not old upon thee
[51:56] neither did thy foot swell these 40
[51:59] years and our older sister said
[52:03] amen Thou shalt also consider in thine
[52:06] heart that as a man chasteneth his son
[52:10] so the Lord thy God chastens thee
[52:13] therefore Thou shalt keep the
[52:14] Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk
[52:17] in his ways and to fear Him amen let's
[52:22] pray together Heavenly Father Lord my
[52:25] desire this morning is that your word
[52:28] would have an effect in our lives father
[52:31] that when we leave this place that we
[52:34] would have a closer walk with you and I
[52:37] believe that that is the desire of every
[52:40] Minister Lord and father I ask a
[52:43] blessing upon this service a special
[52:46] blessing upon your children this people
[52:49] at Grace Tabernacle the visitors from
[52:52] different places Lord I ask that you
[52:54] would bless them uh uh bountifully in
[52:58] their lives father God not necessarily
[53:01] with natural things but with spiritual
[53:04] blessings Lord because that's the
[53:07] blessings that'll Hold Us father we love
[53:09] you we commit this service into your
[53:11] hands for thy Kingdom's glory in the
[53:14] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[53:17] you may take your seats this
[53:23] morning I would like to title my sermon
[53:26] this
[53:27] morning desert
[53:30] places deserts are a very dry hot
[53:37] Dusty uncomfortable places to live in
[53:40] and we would say that deserts are
[53:43] designed only for reptiles and snakes to
[53:46] live and to survive in and it's a place
[53:49] where the cactus is the tallest tree in
[53:53] town and I live in Arizona
[53:58] it's a wonderful place to live but the
[54:01] climate there is very dry it's it's very
[54:04] dusty it's it's a it's a hard place to
[54:07] live in it's a hard place to survive in
[54:10] but yet I I believe as we look at this
[54:13] natural type of a desert and of the
[54:16] things that live therein that we can
[54:17] also apply it to our spiritual lives and
[54:20] we can see that as we go through these
[54:23] types and shadows and these examples in
[54:26] this sermon this morning we can see that
[54:28] God actually uses desert places in our
[54:32] lives it is actually a good place to be
[54:35] in it's actually a good place to live in
[54:39] though it's
[54:40] uncomfortable though it's dusty though
[54:43] it can be a very lonely place to be in
[54:46] yet God uses desert places in our lives
[54:51] in the sermon planting the vine and
[54:53] where to plant it in 1959
[54:56] brother brandham says thus it is with
[54:58] the church today that when the church
[55:01] gets away from the Fountain of Life so
[55:04] what happens when the church gets away
[55:06] from the Fountain of Life he says it
[55:09] gets away from the joys of
[55:12] Salvation did we did we have the quotes
[55:15] there or no were we able to get them up
[55:17] there yeah let's follow along with me if
[55:20] you would poor favor first
[55:24] quote that's okay I don't think you have
[55:27] it on there no that's not my
[55:30] sermon let's see what Brother Paul's
[55:32] been preaching
[55:34] here let me get some
[55:37] [Laughter]
[55:40] inspiration brother brandham says when
[55:42] it gets away from the joys of Salvation
[55:45] when it gets away from the Lord God then
[55:48] that person becomes a sticker always
[55:52] finding fault
[55:54] sticking now I know you live in not a
[55:57] very dry climate here and and there's a
[56:00] lot of rain and there's a lot of this
[56:01] and and perhaps there's nobody in Idaho
[56:04] that have gotten dry and are
[56:07] stickers there's no one in this church
[56:09] but I'll just preach it
[56:11] anyways because I'm from Arizona a lot
[56:14] of times when we get away from the
[56:16] Fountain of Life when we get away from
[56:18] the from the rivers of Life the first
[56:20] thing we lose is the joy of our
[56:24] Salvation David one time said he said
[56:26] Lord restore unto me not my salvation
[56:31] but the joy of my salvation so it's very
[56:34] easy for us now as Believers both young
[56:38] and old and middle-aged for us to lose
[56:41] the the very Joy of our salvation and to
[56:44] become a
[56:46] sticker that's right and we're just
[56:48] sticking and we're always finding fault
[56:52] nothing is good enough within the church
[56:55] the song leader didn't sing you happy
[56:57] the preacher didn't preach you happy the
[57:00] uh the the church was too hot this and
[57:03] that and on and on and on and on and
[57:06] sticking we're always sticking we're
[57:09] always finding
[57:11] faults have any of you ever got to that
[57:14] place in your life yes I have why what
[57:18] was the cause of it because I got away
[57:20] from the Fountain of
[57:23] Life and so when you find somebody
[57:26] that's that's that's sticky you know
[57:29] it's hard to give a cactus a
[57:31] hug have you ever tried to do it I
[57:33] wouldn't recommend it but what happens
[57:36] is you try to give a CA God bless you
[57:40] ah oh did you hear about this did you
[57:43] hear about this in the church that
[57:45] person said this did you see what that
[57:47] sister was
[57:49] wearing oh my
[57:51] goodness did you
[57:53] see did you see that brother
[57:56] my what are they doing finding
[57:59] fault they're sticking they're prickly
[58:03] they're not soft their Spirit isn't soft
[58:06] but their spirit is hard and they're
[58:09] like a c walking Cactus and everywhere
[58:12] they go They're sticking everybody that
[58:13] they come in contact
[58:16] with and the person that is walking
[58:19] around like a walking Cactus think
[58:22] everybody else is the Fault right
[58:26] well this person didn't shake my hand
[58:29] and this person over here and why does
[58:31] nobody want to talk to me and why and
[58:33] why and why well because you're a
[58:36] walking Cactus and you've gotten away
[58:39] from the Fountain of Life saints of God
[58:43] if you find yourself in a spot where
[58:46] you're always finding fault and you're
[58:48] all dried and and shriveled up and
[58:51] you're acting like a walking Cactus you
[58:53] need a trip back to Calvary you need a
[58:57] trip back to the Fountain of Life and
[58:59] say Lord give me this drink I need to
[59:03] drink from thy Fountain this morning
[59:06] because I'm sick and tired of finding
[59:08] fault in everybody
[59:11] else we've all been there and chances
[59:15] are we're all going to be there again
[59:18] right so it's up to us as Believers to
[59:22] keep our spirit
[59:24] soft how did Brother brand tell us to
[59:26] keep our spirit and nature
[59:28] soft through
[59:31] prayer Lord I'm up this morning I'm
[59:35] praying onto thee because I don't want
[59:37] to be a sticker I don't want to be
[59:40] finding fault I don't want to be the
[59:43] glass is half empty kind of a guy but I
[59:46] want to see the good in life I want to
[59:49] be uh the glasses half full kind of a
[59:52] person because it's all depends on how
[59:54] you look at the situation
[59:57] ation we have a choice and I know this
[1:00:00] is very simple but it's right down to
[1:00:03] where we live it'll help you in your
[1:00:05] Christian walk it'll help the young
[1:00:07] people with your relationship with your
[1:00:10] parents and it'll help the parents with
[1:00:12] your relationship with our
[1:00:16] kids because guess what I'm a father of
[1:00:19] five that's why I can give Chris a hard
[1:00:21] time because I know five hey it's it's
[1:00:23] completion man it's good that's a good
[1:00:26] place to
[1:00:27] stop sex is too much okay it takes a
[1:00:31] special person and 100 acres of land to
[1:00:35] have six kids it's just a fact not a
[1:00:39] little backyard in Phoenix
[1:00:42] Arizona sometimes life can be so
[1:00:45] encumbering and we get so stressed out
[1:00:49] and we have the pressure of having to
[1:00:52] provide and we have the pressure of
[1:00:53] taking care of our our our family and
[1:00:56] our children and we have the pressure of
[1:00:58] church we have the pressure of work and
[1:01:00] so much of the time we get so
[1:01:02] pressurized that that we do we let off
[1:01:04] the pressure right A lot of times for a
[1:01:07] man we let it off on our children we
[1:01:10] become sticky to our children we let off
[1:01:13] the pressure and we explode what did
[1:01:16] Brother brandham say to do he said
[1:01:18] you've got to let off the
[1:01:20] pressure but when we let off the
[1:01:22] pressure valve he doesn't want us doing
[1:01:25] it in worldly things it doesn't mean
[1:01:28] that we have to go and and and and go
[1:01:31] and play golf every night or or go
[1:01:33] hunting every weekend or because that's
[1:01:35] my release valve that's what I like to
[1:01:37] do no the best place to release the
[1:01:39] pressure in your life is in church he
[1:01:43] say I'm going to come to church I'm
[1:01:45] going to forget about life for a minute
[1:01:47] I'm going to forget about work I'm going
[1:01:49] to forget about my circumstances and I'm
[1:01:51] going to let off the pressure and I'm
[1:01:53] going to praise the Lord I'm going to
[1:01:56] raise my hands I'm going to say Thank
[1:01:58] You Lord I'm going to say Amen to the
[1:02:00] word and I'm going to Worship the Lord
[1:02:02] my God for two hours on Sunday releasing
[1:02:06] the pressures of life that are
[1:02:08] surrounding
[1:02:09] me cuz if you don't release it here in
[1:02:13] the Right Places You'll release it in
[1:02:16] the wrong places which will not bring
[1:02:18] forth the right kind of fruit in our
[1:02:19] lives it'll not bring forth the right
[1:02:21] kind of fruit in our family's lives or
[1:02:23] in our children's lives right what a
[1:02:28] responsibility that we have to keep our
[1:02:32] spirit
[1:02:33] sensitized in the presence of the
[1:02:36] Lord too much of the time we put God in
[1:02:40] a little
[1:02:41] box you know what the boxes are called
[1:02:45] Wednesday and
[1:02:48] Sunday oh God I pray that you'll move in
[1:02:52] the service on Wednesday night I pray
[1:02:55] you'll set them minister to the side and
[1:02:57] we'll have such an awesome time and
[1:02:59] Sunday morning oh my that's when
[1:03:01] everybody shows up and the congregation
[1:03:03] is
[1:03:04] full maybe your congregation's full on a
[1:03:07] Wednesday night ours isn't but Sunday is
[1:03:10] when everybody comes oh God oh God move
[1:03:14] amongst move into the sight speak to our
[1:03:16] hearts let the presence of God fall in
[1:03:19] our
[1:03:20] midst what about
[1:03:22] Thursday and what about Friday and what
[1:03:25] about about Saturday what about Monday
[1:03:27] and Tuesday what about driving in your
[1:03:29] car what about when you're at home
[1:03:32] listening to a to a song do you think
[1:03:34] God can move on your heart do you think
[1:03:36] God can move in your heart when you're
[1:03:37] driving to school when you're taking the
[1:03:39] kids somewhere when sure he can but too
[1:03:42] much of the time we put God in this
[1:03:44] little Wednesday and Sunday box that
[1:03:46] that's the only time that God can move
[1:03:48] in our lives some of the greatest
[1:03:51] personal times that I've had with God is
[1:03:53] when I'm driving my truck
[1:03:56] amen cuz I'm just
[1:03:58] relaxed I don't notice nothing my wife
[1:04:01] on the other hand she notices oh look
[1:04:04] there's a person on the freeway three
[1:04:06] cars up and they go to the the same
[1:04:08] school as our kids I'm like how do you
[1:04:10] know this she look there's brother and
[1:04:12] sister so and so she's just so alert
[1:04:14] well I'm just yeah praise the Lord I
[1:04:17] don't know how I got home but I got home
[1:04:21] I sure had a nice time with the Lord in
[1:04:23] the car this morning so we need to like
[1:04:25] break out of this mentality that uh God
[1:04:29] can only move when we congregate
[1:04:31] together as a church body but God can
[1:04:34] move in your heart when you're at work
[1:04:36] God can move in your heart when you're
[1:04:38] out fishing God can move in your heart
[1:04:40] when you're doing the dishes if you will
[1:04:43] just sensitize yourself and let him
[1:04:46] speak amen praise the Lord I think
[1:04:50] that's real good because it keeps us in
[1:04:53] anticipation every day of the week for
[1:04:56] God to speak to our
[1:04:59] hearts like the brother said I'll take
[1:05:02] away your Stony heart and I'll give you
[1:05:05] a heart of
[1:05:06] Flesh if our hearts are
[1:05:09] Stony and our hearts are hard and our
[1:05:13] spirit is hard and we're not sensitized
[1:05:16] to God when he speaks we miss
[1:05:19] it you know that you can miss the voice
[1:05:22] of God when he speaks to you
[1:05:26] because he's a
[1:05:28] gentleman he's like a
[1:05:31] dove he's soft he's
[1:05:34] tender he doesn't shout like
[1:05:39] this but he's soft and he's
[1:05:43] gentle and he
[1:05:44] waits and he
[1:05:47] speaks but if we're not sensitized in
[1:05:49] our
[1:05:51] hearts if our spirit is not right we
[1:05:55] miss miss the voice of God when he's
[1:05:57] talking to us we miss the flashing red
[1:06:00] miss the BL stop don't go there don't
[1:06:03] let your thoughts go there they're going
[1:06:05] in the wrong direction we miss it
[1:06:07] completely because we are in the flesh I
[1:06:11] want to tell you something you are not a
[1:06:13] flesh person on a spiritual journey but
[1:06:16] you are a spiritual being on a journey
[1:06:19] through this flesh
[1:06:21] man so don't yield yourself to your
[1:06:24] flesh and to your imaginations and to
[1:06:26] your own thoughts yield yourself to the
[1:06:29] spiritual God to the spirit that dwells
[1:06:33] within
[1:06:34] you when he speaks you will hear yes and
[1:06:38] when I hear I will
[1:06:40] answer and I'll say yes Lord here I am
[1:06:44] Amen brother brandham says they're
[1:06:47] always finding fault sticking cus and
[1:06:50] put it into a land for a few Generations
[1:06:52] where there's plenty of water and that
[1:06:54] sticker will unfold and
[1:06:56] it so how do we bear fruit in our lives
[1:07:02] it's the atmosphere in which it's
[1:07:04] planted in take the same plant the same
[1:07:07] seed the same Cactus take it from
[1:07:10] Arizona and plant it here in Idaho in a
[1:07:13] few Generations because the atmosphere
[1:07:15] is different what will happen to it it
[1:07:18] will soften it up and it'll begin to
[1:07:20] bear fruit it's all about atmospheres
[1:07:25] which which is a completely different
[1:07:26] sermon on its own but you are a creator
[1:07:29] of the atmosphere in your life and the
[1:07:32] atmosphere that you create in your life
[1:07:34] will either breed fruit of the Holy
[1:07:36] Spirit or it'll be a
[1:07:39] sticker let me just leave the atmospher
[1:07:41] is right here what kind of atmosphere
[1:07:44] are you creating in your life because
[1:07:47] the atmosphere that you create in this
[1:07:50] Earth is going to be the atmosphere
[1:07:52] that's created in the earth of your home
[1:07:54] and in the Earth Earth of the people
[1:07:56] that are planted round about
[1:07:59] you you want to change people around you
[1:08:02] start by changing
[1:08:04] yourself start by changing your own
[1:08:08] atmosphere people like to say well
[1:08:10] brother brandom you know what he did he
[1:08:13] put on the apron and he started doing
[1:08:15] dishes it changed the atmosphere all the
[1:08:18] sisters hollered amen cuz they need as
[1:08:22] much help as they
[1:08:24] can but not not only did he put on the
[1:08:27] apron and start doing
[1:08:29] dishes put his hand on her and he starts
[1:08:32] talking to her oh mey there was this
[1:08:35] dress that I saw and it would look so
[1:08:37] cute on you cute is the word of the
[1:08:40] banquet this weekend in case some of you

[1:08:51] look so cute oh bill you know we can't
[1:08:53] afford that what's he doing doing all
[1:08:56] the time he's talking to her he has his
[1:08:57] hand on her he's praying for her Lord
[1:09:00] change the situation calm her
[1:09:03] spirit sensitizer she's been at home all

[1:09:09] clean and people coming to the house and
[1:09:11] people wanting to see Bill and here she
[1:09:13] was she was always a a a what would you
[1:09:16] say a wall or a protection between the
[1:09:18] public and brother brandom and so she
[1:09:21] had to deal with all these people she
[1:09:22] had to deal with her children she had to
[1:09:24] deal with people Luna takes coming to
[1:09:26] the house and wanting prayed for and
[1:09:27] here she was she was at her Wit's End
[1:09:30] and brother Brandon realized he needs to
[1:09:31] change the atmosphere in the house and
[1:09:33] so when he began to talk nice to her
[1:09:36] when he began to give her words of
[1:09:39] endearment Hallelujah you know when we
[1:09:42] begin to speak to our wives with words
[1:09:44] of
[1:09:46] endearment it changes
[1:09:49] things it changes
[1:09:53] atmospheres when was the last time you
[1:09:55] told your wife she was
[1:09:57] pretty
[1:09:59] amen words of
[1:10:01] endearment I learned this I learned that
[1:10:04] from ashlin's dad when we were just
[1:10:06] dating she'd he'd tell the boys you make
[1:10:09] sure and you tell you're your mom and
[1:10:12] the girls that they look pretty
[1:10:14] today he saw the in the effect that it
[1:10:17] has in their
[1:10:19] lives because so much of the time we're
[1:10:22] so caught up with hello magazines and
[1:10:25] and this magazine and this one over here
[1:10:27] and all the pretty girls of the earth
[1:10:30] that have absolutely no character behind
[1:10:33] them just selling their body for money
[1:10:35] and their
[1:10:37] looks that ain't pretty that's false
[1:10:41] that's fake it's
[1:10:44] lies take a picture of them when they
[1:10:46] wake up in the morning and see how
[1:10:48] pretty they
[1:10:50] look but words of
[1:10:53] endearment can change marriage amen I
[1:10:57] hope some of you are
[1:10:59] listening cuz I'm touched in my heart
[1:11:02] and I know when God touches me in my
[1:11:04] heart like this that it's for somebody
[1:11:07] yes amen don't wait for her to ask do I
[1:11:10] look pretty but tell her before she
[1:11:15] asks and then she'll probably ask you
[1:11:17] anyways because she wants to hear it
[1:11:21] twice Hallelujah
[1:11:25] says don't talk to me about that stuff
[1:11:27] it has no fruits you take that same
[1:11:29] plant and plant it in the right kind of
[1:11:31] atmosphere it brings forth fruit he says
[1:11:33] what's the matter with the church today
[1:11:36] it's been set into a denomination that
[1:11:38] has put denominational Creeds and bound
[1:11:40] it no joy just a Sprinkle now and then
[1:11:43] of a little Revival to hold it what it
[1:11:45] needs to be is to come out from among
[1:11:47] scoffers and unbelievers and be planted
[1:11:50] by the rivers of
[1:11:52] water that's what we need in our Liv
[1:11:55] lives we need to come out of the
[1:11:57] unbelief that has us bound once in a
[1:11:59] while and come in and plant ourselves by
[1:12:02] the rivers of life which is Jesus Christ
[1:12:06] it's an everflowinglife
[1:12:25] Christ and him alone will die in our
[1:12:29] sins it doesn't matter how much good
[1:12:31] we've done in our lives it doesn't
[1:12:34] matter how much tithing we've paid or
[1:12:36] how much we've come to church unless
[1:12:38] we've been born again by the spirit of
[1:12:41] God it will amount to nothing I say
[1:12:45] father give us all that true New Birth
[1:12:48] experience that we've passed from Death
[1:12:51] onto life
[1:12:53] Hallelujah cuz that is what holds
[1:12:58] us many times in our lives as Christians
[1:13:01] we're going to come across periods
[1:13:03] within our lives that we're in a desert
[1:13:10] place no one's exempt from it and if
[1:13:13] you've just been in the joy of the Lord
[1:13:15] and on cloud nine since that day that
[1:13:18] you surrendered your life to him and
[1:13:20] you've never been in a desert experience
[1:13:22] or a desert place in your life just get
[1:13:26] ready cuz it's coming if it hasn't come
[1:13:30] yet it's on its way so be prepared for
[1:13:35] it it'll be times where it seems like
[1:13:38] it's impossible to take your Bible and
[1:13:42] spend time and to read it there will be
[1:13:45] times where it feels like it's
[1:13:46] impossible to pray the anointing is
[1:13:49] completely dry the skies are like brass
[1:13:53] you can't pray through through you can't
[1:13:56] feel no inspiration you don't feel the
[1:13:58] presence of God around you and it seems
[1:14:01] like it's just a dry lonely
[1:14:04] uncomfortable hot climate in the
[1:14:07] atmosphere that surrounds your
[1:14:09] life all of us who have been there we're
[1:14:13] going to be there again
[1:14:15] right but I want you to know and
[1:14:19] and that it's a good place to be
[1:14:22] in I want you to know that God uses
[1:14:26] those times in our lives for his glory
[1:14:30] amen that it's not because you're a rank
[1:14:32] Sinner and God doesn't love you but he's
[1:14:36] taken you apart to a desert Wilderness
[1:14:40] place because he has a purpose behind
[1:14:43] it
[1:14:45] Hallelujah desert places are extremely
[1:14:48] lonely places to be
[1:14:51] in and we've all been there it doesn't
[1:14:54] matter matter whether you go to a small
[1:14:57] church or a big church there' be times
[1:15:01] you can go to a big church with all
[1:15:02] these people and all the youth and all
[1:15:05] these people around us but yet still
[1:15:08] feel lonely
[1:15:10] right that's right alone in a big
[1:15:13] group by
[1:15:15] yourself and nobody
[1:15:17] knows because you still got a big smile
[1:15:19] on your
[1:15:21] face because you're hiding up what's
[1:15:24] really going on on inside of our
[1:15:27] hearts you know as Believers we have
[1:15:32] this thought process me me
[1:15:36] mentality
[1:15:38] that if if you share what's really going
[1:15:41] on in your life that that people a lot
[1:15:44] of times will think well you're just a
[1:15:46] weak Christian and you just got to have
[1:15:48] faith just have faith what's wrong with
[1:15:52] you all you got to do is just have faith
[1:15:55] I think that's
[1:15:56] nonsense I think we've we've put Faith
[1:15:59] to a place where if you have faith that
[1:16:03] you'll have no issues in your life but
[1:16:06] if you have faith you'll have more
[1:16:08] issues in your life because God is
[1:16:11] wanting to show to Satan and to the
[1:16:13] world around us the faith that you have
[1:16:15] in your life and so we have this
[1:16:18] mentality built up like oh yeah that
[1:16:20] person's struggling we have a bunch of
[1:16:22] job's comforters in the message we have
[1:16:25] job's comforters within our own
[1:16:28] families well this is happening in their
[1:16:30] life because their secret sin are
[1:16:33] because of this and they haven't been
[1:16:35] doing their due diligence nonsense don't
[1:16:38] listen to that kind of Tommy rot have
[1:16:40] God send you what was his name the one
[1:16:42] that came around and he was a real good
[1:16:44] guy huh elu what was it it was God God
[1:16:50] send us someone like elu around in our
[1:16:53] life that won't be a comforter in point
[1:16:55] the finger cuz he's an absolute
[1:16:58] sticker amen but that he'll Comfort us
[1:17:00] in a way number one if we're in sin
[1:17:03] he'll tell us the truth out of love but
[1:17:05] number two they'll give us an
[1:17:07] opportunity and a way out of that sin
[1:17:10] not just to point the finger but to
[1:17:12] provide a way
[1:17:14] out
[1:17:16] hallelujah amen amen there's many things
[1:17:20] that we go through in Life Unexpected
[1:17:22] accidents to yourself or to a family
[1:17:25] member Financial issues you lose your
[1:17:29] job put you into a desert place somebody
[1:17:31] gets sick in the family you have a car
[1:17:33] wreck whatever it might be the list can
[1:17:35] go on and on you fill in the blank yes
[1:17:39] you fill in the blank of what has
[1:17:40] happened in your life you fill in the
[1:17:42] blank of what could
[1:17:44] happen there's many things that can take
[1:17:47] us all as Believers into desert
[1:17:52] places but we realize that God has a
[1:17:54] purpose for these things Exodus 3 1-5
[1:17:59] and it says now Moses kept the flock of
[1:18:03] Jethro's father-in-law the priest of
[1:18:06] Midian and he laid the he led the flock
[1:18:09] to the backside of the desert and came
[1:18:12] to the Mountain of God even to Horeb I
[1:18:16] want to ask what was it that led Moses
[1:18:19] to lead his sheep to the backside of the
[1:18:21] desert because there was an appointed
[1:18:23] time in the backside of the this desert
[1:18:25] that was going to
[1:18:26] happen he said and and the angel of the
[1:18:29] Lord appeared onto him in a flame of
[1:18:31] fire out of the midst of a bush and he
[1:18:34] looked and behold the bush burned with
[1:18:36] fire and the Bush was not consumed and
[1:18:38] Moses said I will now turn aside and see
[1:18:41] this great sight why the bush is not
[1:18:45] burned can you imagine taking the Sheep
[1:18:48] out into the country out into a
[1:18:50] Wilderness place and all of a sudden
[1:18:52] there's a there's a fire that's not
[1:18:53] being consumed
[1:18:55] what did it do it caught the attention
[1:18:58] of Moses because God had to get Moses by
[1:19:02] himself in order to grasp his attention
[1:19:06] because he had an appointed time with
[1:19:08] Moses because he had a purpose and a
[1:19:10] plan for Moses to go into
[1:19:12] Egypt amen why did he get them all by
[1:19:16] himself because there was no other
[1:19:18] voices there was no other distractions
[1:19:21] there was nothing that would hinder the
[1:19:23] voice of God in his life life out in the
[1:19:25] wilderness out there am so God had to
[1:19:28] lead him out there why because he wanted
[1:19:30] to grab his
[1:19:34] attention and when the Lord saw that he
[1:19:37] turned aside to see God called onto him
[1:19:41] out of the midst of the Bush and said
[1:19:42] Moses Moses and he said here am I and he
[1:19:46] said draw not nigh hither put off thy
[1:19:49] shoes from off thy feet for the place
[1:19:52] whereon thou standest is ho Holy Ground
[1:19:56] what was God doing God was was drawing
[1:19:59] him out of a a comfort zone and he was
[1:20:02] bringing him into a Wilderness place
[1:20:05] because he wanted to grab his attention
[1:20:08] by this Supernatural Bush that was not
[1:20:10] being consumed by this fire it was a
[1:20:14] supernatural fire in the bush was not
[1:20:16] being consumed the supernal is designed
[1:20:20] to catch our
[1:20:22] attention first two p of brother bram's
[1:20:25] Ministry what did it do it caught the
[1:20:28] attention of the
[1:20:30] people first pull he would take them by
[1:20:33] the hand and his hand would begin to
[1:20:35] bump what was it dealing with it was
[1:20:38] dealing with the Flesh and he would say
[1:20:40] oh my uh uh such and such is wrong with
[1:20:44] you and he would pray for them and if
[1:20:45] the little bumps or the vibrations went
[1:20:47] away he would say you're healed in the
[1:20:49] name of Jesus Christ because it was a
[1:20:51] sign that God was given to this prophet
[1:20:55] and what was this sign for it was to
[1:20:57] catch the attention of the people the
[1:21:00] second pull the the the Discerning of
[1:21:03] the hearts and so forth he would say oh
[1:21:05] I see somebody way in the back there
[1:21:07] your name is such and such and you're
[1:21:08] from such and such a place and and and
[1:21:11] what was it doing it was the people were
[1:21:13] wowed by it wow what was God doing he
[1:21:17] was moving from the flesh man into the
[1:21:20] spiritual
[1:21:22] realm God
[1:21:26] condescending not just dealing with our
[1:21:28] flesh but now with our spiritual
[1:21:31] man until finally it would get to a
[1:21:33] place the third pool what was it the
[1:21:35] revealing of the word doesn't deal with
[1:21:38] the flesh the intellects of man nor the
[1:21:41] spirit of man but the soul of man where
[1:21:44] the seat of God
[1:21:47] lays Thy word oh God have I hid in my
[1:21:51] heart that I learn not to sin against
[1:21:53] you so God is the god of our flesh our
[1:21:56] spirit and of our soul the first two
[1:22:00] were designed to catch the attention of
[1:22:03] the people but the last one it wasn't
[1:22:06] for all of the peoples but it was for a
[1:22:10] particular people a royal priesthood a
[1:22:14] people who were predestined who were
[1:22:16] elected to catch the word of God in this
[1:22:18] hour the first two pools hey it's all to
[1:22:21] do with the
[1:22:22] flesh all to do with the flesh and
[1:22:24] whenever the whenever the flesh didn't
[1:22:27] feel the emotion anymore guess what
[1:22:29] those people were no longer
[1:22:31] held whenever he stopped telling the
[1:22:33] people what was upon their hearts guess
[1:22:35] what they said ah brother brenham's all
[1:22:37] washed up his gift isn't working anymore
[1:22:41] uh and whenever he stopped doing it as
[1:22:43] much guess what people begin to walk
[1:22:44] away why because they were being healed
[1:22:47] by uh emotions and and and and and by
[1:22:50] the the spirit of conscience and memory
[1:22:53] and so forth like that he he said if I
[1:22:55] tell one person their name and where
[1:22:57] their address and where they live they
[1:22:58] think I'm a God the next person that
[1:23:00] comes through if I don't tell them they
[1:23:02] think I'm a devil he couldn't win but it
[1:23:05] was to catch the attention because
[1:23:07] within that group with within that that
[1:23:11] that that net of fish that was being
[1:23:13] cast every service guess what there was
[1:23:15] a rainbow trout within
[1:23:18] that that was had a destiny with God to
[1:23:23] hear the revealed word of the hour that
[1:23:25] it might change their lives and that
[1:23:27] someday it might change their body for a
[1:23:29] Rapture first and second pull Believers
[1:23:32] guess what I doubt they'll make the
[1:23:35] Rapture that's why is that because
[1:23:38] there's no Holy Spirit that's revealing
[1:23:40] the word to
[1:23:41] them it's the Holy Spirit who's the
[1:23:45] Divine interpreter of the word that's
[1:23:48] why a person filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:51] can listen to the same service and catch
[1:23:53] the inspiration ation they can catch the
[1:23:56] anointing and say wow even though it was
[1:23:59] spoke by the prophet and there will be
[1:24:01] others that'll hear the exact same
[1:24:02] service and say I didn't catch anything
[1:24:05] what is it that makes a difference it's
[1:24:07] the Holy Spirit who will bring things to
[1:24:10] our remembrance who will Who will show
[1:24:13] us things to come and who is the only
[1:24:16] Divine interpreter of the word sir Amen
[1:24:21] Let me throw you a
[1:24:23] curveball the prophet of God was not the
[1:24:25] Divine interpreter of the
[1:24:28] word otherwise everybody would catch it
[1:24:31] that listens to the sermons that's right
[1:24:33] but though he preaches it there's still
[1:24:36] a supernatural element direct quote a
[1:24:40] supernatural element that remains where
[1:24:43] the Holy Spirit reveals it to the
[1:24:45] believer so if there's one thing that we
[1:24:48] need to be praying for is the holy
[1:24:49] spirit not just one baptism but many
[1:24:52] outpourings and not just one Revelation
[1:24:55] but God keep revealing to me keep
[1:24:58] unfolding to me
[1:25:00] Lord for one
[1:25:02] purpose not that I can be a stuffed
[1:25:05] shirt right right not that I can tell
[1:25:08] somebody when they're wrong right but
[1:25:10] that I know how to live a life that is
[1:25:13] pleasing to him yes
[1:25:17] am amen seven seal brother bradam he
[1:25:22] says don't try to put your own
[1:25:23] interpretation to these
[1:25:26] things don't do it why because there's
[1:25:29] carnal impersonations that'll
[1:25:31] arise men's intellect and Creeds and
[1:25:33] dogas will be added to it he said just
[1:25:36] go and live a Christian
[1:25:39] Life ah brother Stephen that's way too
[1:25:42] simple that's why I love it because I'm
[1:25:44] not an intellectual person just talk to
[1:25:46] me for 20 minutes and you'll understand
[1:25:49] but I'm glad that it does that I don't
[1:25:51] have to rely on my own intellects of my
[1:25:54] mind but I rely upon the holy spirit of
[1:25:58] God to bring the Revelation to my life
[1:26:02] and you also amen amen Moses was raised
[1:26:08] in the house of pharaoh he looked like
[1:26:09] an Egyptian he talked like an
[1:26:12] Egyptian and he was taught as the
[1:26:15] Egyptian children were taught but at an
[1:26:17] appointed time he realized that's not
[1:26:19] who he really was and and I believe that
[1:26:22] most of us in here are belie belies and
[1:26:24] we've had a a true experience with God
[1:26:27] but you know what there come a time in
[1:26:29] brother bram's own life that he realized
[1:26:33] he wasn't the son of of uh what's his
[1:26:37] dad's name Charles and Ella brandom but
[1:26:41] he was the son of the
[1:26:43] King when he was when he saw himself as
[1:26:47] a as a as a brandom as a son of Charles
[1:26:49] brandom guess what he tried to do he
[1:26:51] tried to smoke a cigarette right right
[1:26:54] he tried to drink a drink of whiskey I
[1:26:56] ain't no don't you call me
[1:26:59] oh that's that's that's Bill he's a
[1:27:01] his dad called him that here he
[1:27:04] was the oldest of all the brothers I
[1:27:06] ain't no he give me that drink
[1:27:09] watch me and that voice spoke to
[1:27:13] him he run away crying like what like a
[1:27:16] little
[1:27:18] but he was a brandom and he tried
[1:27:21] to do the things that brandom's done he
[1:27:23] one day he he he took a beaten from
[1:27:25] these boys and what did he go to he went
[1:27:26] and got his
[1:27:30] gun I'll put enough bullets in here I'll
[1:27:32] kill all these guys which one of you
[1:27:34] want to die first huh remember he says
[1:27:38] and they were all screaming he cocked
[1:27:40] that thing back
[1:27:42] click click click why was he doing that
[1:27:46] because he was a brandom but he came up
[1:27:49] to a point in his life where he realized
[1:27:51] that's not who I am and when he realized
[1:27:55] who he really was guess what when
[1:27:57] remember that lady said you little kinky
[1:27:59] headed whatever and she was calling his
[1:28:02] mom bad names he goes I knew something
[1:28:05] happened in my life because because I
[1:28:08] prayed and I had a love for that woman
[1:28:10] if that would have been a couple of
[1:28:12] weeks before he says I never thought a a
[1:28:14] man that would hit a woman isn't man
[1:28:16] enough to hit a man he goes but I would
[1:28:19] have hit her that
[1:28:21] day but now he realized I'm not the son
[1:28:25] of Charles brandom though that's my name
[1:28:28] that I have here on Earth I'm a son of
[1:28:30] the king I've been given a new name I've
[1:28:33] been given a new heart I've been given a
[1:28:35] new nature therefore I'm going to bring
[1:28:37] forth of the fruit of my heavenly
[1:28:40] father and that's the place that all of
[1:28:43] us come
[1:28:45] to as Believers in Christ and you don't
[1:28:49] realize it until somebody steps in your
[1:28:52] toes right
[1:28:54] amen Abraham Abraham stay thy
[1:28:59] hand for now I know that you love
[1:29:02] me I thought God knows all things God
[1:29:05] knew exactly what was in Abraham's heart
[1:29:08] he knew exactly how much he loved him
[1:29:10] but Abraham might not have known to the
[1:29:12] extent that he loved
[1:29:14] god wow I can't believe I was about to
[1:29:18] do that Sarah's going to kill me when
[1:29:21] she finds out
[1:29:27] my
[1:29:28] mother-in-law last two years ago uh she
[1:29:31] got covid and she was going through
[1:29:33] menopause and stuff and she just had a a
[1:29:36] very very hard time and to say that she
[1:29:39] was losing her mind is an understatement
[1:29:42] she wasn't sleeping at night and and
[1:29:44] she's already kind of a nervous person
[1:29:47] and you get a nervous person that's not
[1:29:48] sleeping and they don't know what's
[1:29:50] wrong with them and they're always
[1:29:51] crying and they're they're suffering
[1:29:52] within themselves a uh she was she was
[1:29:55] absolutely losing her mind and so she
[1:29:57] would call this person and call that
[1:29:59] person she would call me and you know
[1:30:01] she was uh if I would say this
[1:30:04] respectfully she was trying to find that
[1:30:07] one sentence that would deliver her you
[1:30:10] see what I'm saying somebody give me an
[1:30:11] anointed word that'll deliver me from
[1:30:13] this from this atmosphere that I'm in
[1:30:15] right now and one night you and it was
[1:30:17] just hard on the family and I remember
[1:30:20] talking to my brother and sister-in-laws
[1:30:21] and my wife and stuff and we're like you
[1:30:23] know what
[1:30:24] we might just have to get used to this
[1:30:28] that she might never get
[1:30:30] better she might always be in this state
[1:30:32] of mind I I I don't know but we need to
[1:30:34] have Grace for
[1:30:36] her and so anyways one night she called
[1:30:39] me and she's crying and stuff of course
[1:30:42] and and uh and I'm not much of a crier
[1:30:45] um I only cry really when I when I
[1:30:48] Minister and God touches my heart it's
[1:30:49] like the only time it's strange and so
[1:30:54] she uh she called me she's crying I'm
[1:30:56] like okay you'll be all right Mom and
[1:30:59] you know I'm trying to console her and
[1:31:01] stuff and she's like Stephen I don't
[1:31:04] know why I'm going through this but all
[1:31:07] I know is I love the Lord
[1:31:09] Jesus I said do you realize what you
[1:31:12] just said right now that's you're here
[1:31:15] in the darkest deepest trial of your
[1:31:18] life that you've ever been through
[1:31:20] you're losing your mind you've
[1:31:22] contemplated committing suicide and all
[1:31:24] these dark thoughts in your mind but yet
[1:31:26] you've come to a place that you have
[1:31:29] said I love the Lord Jesus I don't care
[1:31:31] what happens if I ever get healed or
[1:31:33] whatever and now when you see my
[1:31:35] mother-in-law she's taking care of our
[1:31:37] five kids this weekend if that tells you
[1:31:39] anything of how she is
[1:31:41] mentally God supernaturally touched her
[1:31:44] in her mind and her body and in her life
[1:31:47] she was in a desert place but she had to
[1:31:50] get to a place where where she realized
[1:31:54] that she loved God and sometimes God
[1:31:57] will take us to the depths of
[1:32:00] Despair right in order for us to
[1:32:04] realize wow I do love him amen praise
[1:32:08] the
[1:32:10] Lord praise the
[1:32:12] Lord so we see at age 40 Moses fled uh
[1:32:18] Egypt after slaying a man in the
[1:32:19] wilderness he fled to a desert place and
[1:32:22] there God got a hold of Moses
[1:32:24] by the way of a burning bush and brother
[1:32:26] Bram said that it took 40 years in the
[1:32:28] backside of the desert to unlearn Moses
[1:32:31] of the 40 years that he had learned
[1:32:33] while in Egypt in the sermon Faith
[1:32:36] 1957 brother brandham said how that
[1:32:39] Moses after having 40 Years of religious
[1:32:42] training by his mother how having 40
[1:32:46] Years of military might in his hands of
[1:32:48] how to whip a nation how to conquer and
[1:32:50] it taken God 40 years to take it out of
[1:32:53] him but once out there in the wilderness
[1:32:56] alone one day he came face to face with
[1:32:59] God right now when he was at the youth
[1:33:02] banquet not when he was at the at the
[1:33:04] church service not when he was around
[1:33:06] all of the Believers but when God got
[1:33:09] him in the wilderness
[1:33:12] alone then God began to speak to
[1:33:19] Moses Moses slayed an Egyptian living
[1:33:22] off his mother's revelation our
[1:33:24] understanding that God was going to use
[1:33:26] him to deliver the children of Israel
[1:33:29] and it made nothing but a stink in the
[1:33:33] sand his mother had raised him in the
[1:33:35] house of pharaoh you're going to be the
[1:33:37] deliverer they're going to listen to you
[1:33:39] you're God's anointed you're you're
[1:33:41] you're going to stand and you're going
[1:33:42] to deliver you're going to be the
[1:33:43] deliverer that the people of Israel have
[1:33:45] been looking for from
[1:33:47] Egypt but yet when he tried to do it by
[1:33:49] his mother's Revelation and he took it
[1:33:51] into his own hands and he slave an
[1:33:54] Egyptian what happened the people said
[1:33:56] to him huh you want to tell us what to
[1:33:57] do what about that Egyptian that you
[1:33:59] killed over there the other day they
[1:34:01] turned against him it did nothing but
[1:34:05] make us stink in the sand of a dead
[1:34:08] Egyptian understand with us we can't
[1:34:10] live off of pastor's revelation we can't
[1:34:13] live off of Mom and Dad's Revelation but
[1:34:16] we have to have our own Revelation in
[1:34:19] order to fight this good fight of Faith
[1:34:22] just like David of old when David of old
[1:34:25] he said I'll I'll kill that who is this
[1:34:27] this uncircumcised Philistine how dare
[1:34:30] he come and and defy the armies of
[1:34:32] Israel he's got a big mouth and I'm
[1:34:34] going to shut it Saul says oh this young
[1:34:37] boy he's got some he's got some Zeal
[1:34:40] let's bring him in here here I'm going
[1:34:42] to give you all my ecclesiastical
[1:34:45] training gives him his shield his armor
[1:34:48] his helmet his spear it didn't fit
[1:34:52] him here was David I think we have in
[1:34:55] our mind of David as a a little a little
[1:34:58] tiny boy and stuff and and all that but
[1:35:00] I I personally think David was a warrior
[1:35:03] you know you ever see these uh you see
[1:35:06] these guys that work out and they're big
[1:35:07] and they're buff and they can't really
[1:35:09] move much you know that's kind of how
[1:35:11] Goliath was well I see David not being a
[1:35:14] scrawny kid I see him like like an Idaho
[1:35:17] farmer out here like Gideon I kind of
[1:35:19] see him like Gideon a little bit back
[1:35:20] there big old forearms and you know no
[1:35:23] fat not much fat on him and a good good
[1:35:26] pair of hands and stuff and yeah this
[1:35:27] guy's going to take care of business he
[1:35:29] might not look big and stuff like
[1:35:31] Goliath but he's
[1:35:34] wiy that's how I see him take it or
[1:35:36] leave it it's up to
[1:35:38] you but here he was and he said this
[1:35:41] this this this shield and and all these
[1:35:44] things I haven't proved these things I
[1:35:46] don't know these things this is not my
[1:35:49] Revelation this is Saul's Revelation he
[1:35:51] has proved these things there's one
[1:35:53] thing that I have that I know that works
[1:35:56] and that's this little slingshot and I
[1:35:59] know that if I get a couple of smooth
[1:36:01] stones from the brook
[1:36:02] there a few stones that have been
[1:36:05] through of a few rainy
[1:36:08] days you know a stone that's smooth in
[1:36:10] the brook it's been there for a
[1:36:13] while it's seen a lot of weather it's
[1:36:16] seen a lot of fish pass by it's seen a
[1:36:18] lot of weeds pass by but it's been
[1:36:20] molded by the weather till it's smooth
[1:36:24] right a revelation that
[1:36:27] stands F AI t h j s u s here David picks
[1:36:32] up these Stones he didn't need five
[1:36:34] stones but for God just to prove that it
[1:36:36] takes Faith to beat a Goliath he picks
[1:36:38] up
[1:36:39] five you don't need to have all of the
[1:36:42] understanding of this scripture you just
[1:36:45] need to have a little Revelation here
[1:36:46] and there you don't need to be able to
[1:36:48] to to uh uh explain it to everybody
[1:36:54] take what you have and use
[1:36:57] it the faith that he had in what he had
[1:37:00] proved before with the lion and the bear
[1:37:03] killed Goliath a lot of times in our
[1:37:05] lives God will use a lion and a bear
[1:37:07] experience because he knows that we have
[1:37:09] a Goliath that's laying ahead of us
[1:37:11] that's
[1:37:14] it so notice where he was he was in the
[1:37:17] backside of the desert what was Moses's
[1:37:20] purpose for being there it was for him
[1:37:23] to to meet God face to
[1:37:25] face and it was because of his previous
[1:37:28] choices of slaying an Egyptian that took
[1:37:31] him to that
[1:37:33] place some of you give yourselves such a
[1:37:36] hard time on past choices and past
[1:37:41] decisions but let me say this if you
[1:37:43] believe that the footsteps of the
[1:37:44] righteous are ordered of the Lord and
[1:37:47] that God is with us and that he has
[1:37:49] paved a way for us and we're walking in
[1:37:51] his perfect will your bad choice are the
[1:37:54] choices that led you to this spot in
[1:37:56] your life whether you think it was good
[1:37:59] or it was bad it was all orchestrated of
[1:38:02] God that's the truth so give yourself a
[1:38:05] break gentlemen give yourself a break
[1:38:09] Brothers those choices that you think
[1:38:11] were poor sure they might have been poor
[1:38:14] but God is using them for his Kingdom's
[1:38:16] glory to make you walk in his perfect
[1:38:18] will that's what he did to
[1:38:21] Moses so God called him and uh he took
[1:38:26] him to the he took him to the Mount of
[1:38:28] horb one time which is called siai and
[1:38:31] at that place God gave Moses the Ten
[1:38:33] Commandments what was it it was in a
[1:38:35] desert Place why did he lead him to a
[1:38:38] desert place to begin with because he
[1:38:41] wanted to meet with Moses face to face
[1:38:44] why did he take him to a desert place in
[1:38:46] Mount Si because he wanted to reveal his
[1:38:49] word to
[1:38:51] Moses it has two parts to it now put
[1:38:53] yourself there don't just think of the
[1:38:56] story let's be spiritual because
[1:38:58] everything that we preach all comes back
[1:39:00] to you and I as Believers every example
[1:39:04] that we give we should be able to bring
[1:39:06] it back to us as Believers because if we
[1:39:09] can't apply the word to our lives it's
[1:39:11] no good for
[1:39:15] us so it was God to reveal himself and
[1:39:19] also for God to reveal his word onto him
[1:39:23] Paul was on the road down to Damascus
[1:39:25] one time excuse
[1:39:29] me Paul was on the road down to Damascus
[1:39:32] one time to persecute the Church of the
[1:39:35] Living God when a light appeared from
[1:39:38] the heavens and the light spoke to him
[1:39:40] and it said Saul Saul why are you
[1:39:43] persecuting me why are you doing this to
[1:39:45] me and brother brandham said that Paul
[1:39:47] had enough uh teaching and learning he
[1:39:50] was he was a Jew that he would never
[1:39:52] have called that light Lord unless he
[1:39:55] knew that it was God
[1:39:58] Elohim and so he said Lord Who Art Thou
[1:40:03] after all his training with celeia after
[1:40:05] all his his his
[1:40:07] ecclesiastical uh learning and whatever
[1:40:10] it might have been he said Lord I don't
[1:40:13] know you who are you you know you can go
[1:40:17] to a message church and you can learn
[1:40:19] the the precepts and the dogmas and you
[1:40:21] can learn the the doct and all those
[1:40:24] different things and still not know him
[1:40:27] I want to know him and in the power of
[1:40:30] his
[1:40:33] resurrection and he told him exactly who
[1:40:35] he was he said I am
[1:40:40] Jesus The Great I Am what was he showing
[1:40:44] him that Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[1:40:47] Jesus of the New Testament right
[1:40:50] Hallelujah the God above us was the god
[1:40:54] with us and now he's that same God that
[1:40:57] same Pillar of Fire that same holy ghost
[1:41:00] that same being that lives within
[1:41:04] us
[1:41:06] my how mind-blowing is
[1:41:10] that huh you know why you can't accept
[1:41:13] that because you look at your flesh too
[1:41:16] much of the time right look at the
[1:41:19] desire of your heart
[1:41:21] right you know the Apostle Paul one time
[1:41:24] he said he said uh when I try to do good
[1:41:26] evil is with me and those things that I
[1:41:29] want to do I can't do them and the
[1:41:30] things that I don't want to do those are
[1:41:32] the things that I do the Apostle Paul
[1:41:35] First Church age messenger had the same
[1:41:37] issues that we have in our life but he
[1:41:40] said he said my grace Lord told him my
[1:41:43] grace is sufficient for you and I want
[1:41:47] to say this morning that God's grace is
[1:41:50] sufficient for you because he that began
[1:41:53] the work is able to finish the work so
[1:41:57] don't lay down when you get knocked down
[1:41:59] get back up again why because God's
[1:42:02] grace is
[1:42:04] sufficient don't look at your carnal man
[1:42:07] but look at the desire that's coming
[1:42:10] from the heart if you have any kind of
[1:42:13] desire to serve God if you have any kind
[1:42:16] of desire to pray and read your Bible
[1:42:18] it's because God has placed it within
[1:42:20] our
[1:42:21] hearts amen oh the love of
[1:42:28] God hallelujah that light blinded
[1:42:32] Paul took him off his high horse didn't
[1:42:35] it God blinded Paul in the natural so
[1:42:39] that he could open his eyes in the
[1:42:41] spiritual I pray that the Lord does that
[1:42:43] to each and every one of us father blind
[1:42:46] our eyes to materialistic things to
[1:42:48] bigger houses bigger cars better things
[1:42:50] more money all the different things that
[1:42:53] that makes the world go round that makes
[1:42:55] it easier to live I don't care about
[1:42:57] living easy In the Flesh I just want to
[1:42:59] live for
[1:43:00] him I have a desire to live for him
[1:43:05] these things are they're slowly fading
[1:43:07] away from my life yeah amen and I hope
[1:43:10] they are from yours
[1:43:15] too because what happens to much we get
[1:43:17] caught up in chasing the Mighty
[1:43:21] Dollar we get too too caught up and
[1:43:24] chasing the nice nicer things trying to
[1:43:27] keep up with the
[1:43:30] Joneses who cares I hope there's no
[1:43:33] Joneses here who cares about the Joneses
[1:43:37] and what color they painted their curbs
[1:43:39] at the front of their house let them do
[1:43:40] it man live for God who cares if someone
[1:43:45] in the church got a nicer vehicle than
[1:43:46] you and you feel you have to keep up
[1:43:48] with them who cares your vehicle gets
[1:43:50] you from A to B back to a again it's
[1:43:53] does a good job keep
[1:43:55] it amen
[1:43:58] okay sorry brother
[1:44:02] Paul maybe that's the pastor that should
[1:44:04] preach that stuff I feel at home so you
[1:44:07] know I I just kind of preach like how I
[1:44:09] preach at home so yeah further Paul can
[1:44:12] speak to me in the back I saw a big
[1:44:14] stick back
[1:44:22] there Galatians 1:1 15-17 but when it
[1:44:25] pleased God who separated me from my
[1:44:26] mother's womb and called me by his grace
[1:44:29] to reveal his son in me that I might
[1:44:31] preach among the Heathen immediately I
[1:44:34] conferred not with flesh and blood
[1:44:36] neither went I up to Jerusalem to them
[1:44:37] which were Apostles before me but I went
[1:44:39] into Arabia and turned again onto
[1:44:42] Damascus what did Paul do Paul went to a
[1:44:45] desert place he didn't go asking
[1:44:47] everybody else's opinion but he got by
[1:44:49] himself he spent time with God and into
[1:44:53] a desert place and when he went there
[1:44:55] and when he went back to to meet with
[1:44:57] the Believers guess what he was saying
[1:44:59] the same thing that they were saying why
[1:45:02] because it's the same Pillar of Fire the
[1:45:04] same Holy Ghost God that was given the
[1:45:07] Revelation to the apostles as to the
[1:45:09] Apostle pet
[1:45:11] Paul if we get the same Holy Spirit
[1:45:15] we'll say the same
[1:45:17] thing we get the same Holy Spirit we'll
[1:45:20] think the same way we'll dress the same
[1:45:22] way our lives will be very similar why
[1:45:25] because he is God and he changes
[1:45:28] not Christ is the mystery of God
[1:45:30] revealed Paul went down then till he got
[1:45:33] all of his ecclesiastical stuff cut off
[1:45:35] of him down at the backside of the
[1:45:37] desert for three and a half years down
[1:45:40] there in Arabia until he learned the
[1:45:41] word and the word became
[1:45:43] he and he became a
[1:45:47] prisoner here was Paul putting people in
[1:45:50] prison but now Paul himself became a
[1:45:54] prisoner Here We Come Back In Chains of
[1:45:57] love all my Seminary experience is gone
[1:46:01] I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen
[1:46:03] Filman my brother I'm a prisoner of
[1:46:05] Jesus Christ I only can speak and say
[1:46:08] what he tells me to speak I say God help
[1:46:13] us to keep our mouths shut when it
[1:46:15] should be shut and to say something when
[1:46:17] it needs to be
[1:46:18] said amen so what was God doing to Paul
[1:46:22] in the desert desert of Arabia he was
[1:46:24] revealing himself to him through the
[1:46:26] scriptures that Jesus was the
[1:46:28] Messiah later on Paul was in another
[1:46:31] desert place in his life he was shut up
[1:46:34] in a jail in a dungeon everybody thought
[1:46:37] he was all washed up everybody had
[1:46:39] forsaken him he said Demus has forsaken
[1:46:41] me for this for this evil world and here
[1:46:44] he is writing and brother brandham types
[1:46:47] this stage of Paul's life to his own
[1:46:50] Ministry he says everybody has forsaken
[1:46:53] me even Deus sharan huh here he was all
[1:46:57] by himself in a desert place but when
[1:47:00] Paul was in a dungeon guess what
[1:47:02] happened he wrote most of the New
[1:47:04] Testament books right so what was God
[1:47:07] doing to Paul first of all in Arabia he
[1:47:10] was revealing himself to him that Jesus
[1:47:13] was the Messiah but here he was in a
[1:47:15] dark cold dungeon all by himself in a
[1:47:19] desert place what was God doing he was
[1:47:22] revealed feeling the word that the word
[1:47:25] might be given to the
[1:47:27] people are we starting to see that God
[1:47:31] does things in desert
[1:47:34] places let's give one more
[1:47:38] example in our day we see that brother
[1:47:40] brandham himself ever since he was a
[1:47:42] little boy he he was never really
[1:47:45] satisfied with the country that he had
[1:47:47] lived in that he was living in and he
[1:47:49] longed somehow he always wanted to go
[1:47:52] west
[1:47:53] and you know we all believe that
[1:47:54] everybody should move to Arizona sure
[1:47:58] it's yeah brother Bram said that Phoenix
[1:48:01] is the closest thing to Heaven direct
[1:48:05] quote maybe in the 60s
[1:48:07] huh not no
[1:48:14] more he always wanted to go west ever
[1:48:17] since he was a little boy even when that
[1:48:19] astronomer that one time told him he
[1:48:21] said that he would never be success
[1:48:22] uccessful in the East but he would have
[1:48:25] to move west and you all know the layout
[1:48:28] of the Tabernacle that whenever the high
[1:48:31] priest would would enter the Tabernacle
[1:48:34] that he would enter from the East
[1:48:36] heading towards the West into the
[1:48:38] Tabernacle to perform his duties then he
[1:48:41] would leave heading to the east again so
[1:48:45] he would come from the East the high
[1:48:46] priest he would go in towards the West
[1:48:49] he would perform his duties he would
[1:48:51] turn back out again and he would go
[1:48:53] towards the east one more
[1:48:56] time the seven seal brother brandom said
[1:49:00] because before we even went into it and
[1:49:04] I left to go west the Lord showed me a
[1:49:06] vision one day about 10:00 one morning
[1:49:09] and I come and explained it here that I
[1:49:11] had seen it didn't know what it was it
[1:49:13] was a constellation of seven angels we
[1:49:17] we we remember that you'll get it on the
[1:49:20] tape called what time is it sir well now
[1:49:22] now that is exactly what you're seeing
[1:49:24] now the seven angels I was in the west
[1:49:28] you remember the little bitty Messengers
[1:49:30] they went East the second messengers the
[1:49:33] dove little little bit larger bird they
[1:49:36] went East and I looked they was with me
[1:49:38] all the time that was that first and
[1:49:41] second pool now the third came from the
[1:49:45] West sweeping forward with great
[1:49:47] terrific speed and they picked me up
[1:49:51] that was that was coming back East with
[1:49:54] the mystery of the Seven Seals so notice
[1:49:57] what God was doing in the Old Testament
[1:49:59] with the high priest to Israel he was
[1:50:02] doing the exact same thing with the if
[1:50:05] you want to call it the high priest of
[1:50:07] the church Age The Prophet messenger
[1:50:10] brother brandham he was bringing him
[1:50:12] from the East taking him towards the
[1:50:15] West raising him up in this
[1:50:17] constellation of angels to do what to
[1:50:21] reveal the word
[1:50:24] but he didn't leave him in the west he
[1:50:26] brought him back East one more
[1:50:29] time where did he lead him to a desert
[1:50:35] place all
[1:50:37] alone no one would have fellowship with
[1:50:41] him he only preached a couple of times
[1:50:43] in a few years in Tucson and Phoenix
[1:50:46] people had closed the doors what was God
[1:50:48] doing getting brother brandham
[1:50:51] alone in a A wilderness place a desert
[1:50:55] place for a purpose that he might reveal
[1:50:58] his word to his servant
[1:51:04] prophet he says now the third picked me
[1:51:06] up just like it said in junior Jackson's
[1:51:08] dream that the Lord let me interpret him
[1:51:11] for there on the inside of that pyramid
[1:51:14] there was white stone that wasn't
[1:51:16] written on that's the reason I had to go
[1:51:19] west to connect with these angels
[1:51:21] message to come back here to reveal it
[1:51:24] to the church remember I said the next
[1:51:27] things that happen will be here at the
[1:51:29] church that's just
[1:51:32] exactly what is this what is this Cloud
[1:51:36] all
[1:51:37] about what was the purpose of this cloud
[1:51:41] is it is it just a picture that we hang
[1:51:44] upon our walls that we know nothing
[1:51:47] about but what was the reason for it
[1:51:50] what was this Cloud brother Brenham said
[1:51:52] there it is he said I was looking at it
[1:51:56] and and and I was looking at it in Life
[1:51:58] magazine and and and the Science
[1:52:00] magazine and stuff and and the angel
[1:52:02] someone they talked to him and said turn
[1:52:05] it to the
[1:52:07] right and he said oh I wasn't sure if I
[1:52:10] heard it right but but I obeyed The
[1:52:12] Voice anyways he said and I took it and
[1:52:14] I turned it to the right and there it
[1:52:17] was he says Hoffman's head of Christ he
[1:52:20] says there it is you can see his eyes
[1:52:22] you can see his his beard and you can
[1:52:23] see the the the the the white wig of his
[1:52:27] hair showing that he is supreme
[1:52:32] authority that he is supreme authority
[1:52:34] of Heaven he is supreme authority of
[1:52:37] Earth you see brother brandham was
[1:52:39] looking at it through the eyes of man he
[1:52:42] was looking at it through the anointing
[1:52:44] of man but when he was told to turn it
[1:52:47] to the right and he obeyed The Voice he
[1:52:49] was no longer looking at his bible
[1:52:51] through the Through The Eyes of Clarence
[1:52:54] Lin he was no longer looking at his
[1:52:56] bible Through The Eyes of hislop's 2
[1:52:59] Babylons and all these different man
[1:53:00] that he had read before but now he was
[1:53:03] looking at it with prophetic Insight he
[1:53:06] was looking at it through the very Mind
[1:53:09] Of God because that's what this cloud is
[1:53:12] all about it was all about God sharing
[1:53:15] his mind the Mysteries that have been
[1:53:17] hidden since the foundations of the
[1:53:19] world with his servant
[1:53:22] amen it's more than a
[1:53:25] picture it's more than a
[1:53:27] story it's a supernatural
[1:53:30] event that God was fulfilling scripture
[1:53:34] that God was bringing things to pass
[1:53:36] that God was finishing up with the
[1:53:39] Gentile
[1:53:43] dispensation
[1:53:45] finishing his work is almost
[1:53:48] completed time is almost
[1:53:51] over the seals have been revealed the
[1:53:54] mind of God has been made known to the
[1:53:56] people to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:53:58] where are we
[1:54:00] at brother brandom said if I could get
[1:54:02] her to sit stand still long enough in
[1:54:04] the presence of the son I'll dress her
[1:54:07] in the word what are we doing right now
[1:54:10] we're standing
[1:54:12] still we're waiting God hasn't lost no
[1:54:16] power we're not depending upon emotions
[1:54:19] and all these different things no we're
[1:54:21] waiting we're standing still we're
[1:54:23] saying Lord here I am in your presence
[1:54:26] dress me with this un uh this word that
[1:54:29] has been unveiled right before
[1:54:33] us I want to ask you a question brother
[1:54:36] Paul says that you guys answer questions
[1:54:39] back when will the work to the Gentiles
[1:54:41] be
[1:54:43] completed somebody tell
[1:54:47] me rapture
[1:54:52] the
[1:54:53] Rapture people like to say well yeah
[1:54:57] time time will be no more when these
[1:55:00] things are
[1:55:02] revealed but brother brandham said that
[1:55:04] he's still on the throne intercessing
[1:55:06] that's in the seals
[1:55:08] right what is he waiting for he's
[1:55:11] waiting for that last one to come into
[1:55:12] the body and take their position in
[1:55:14] Christ then he leaves the seat of
[1:55:18] mediating for the people then he comes
[1:55:21] for his bride and when the Rapture takes
[1:55:24] place there's no more representation of
[1:55:26] blood here upon the Earth the days of
[1:55:29] the Gentiles are
[1:55:31] completed there will be no one else
[1:55:33] saved in the Gentile dispensation when
[1:55:36] that time happens so is it all over now
[1:55:39] are we in the Millennium no there's
[1:55:42] still time there's still Grace and I
[1:55:45] hope that there is because I got little
[1:55:46] kids that need to come into that grace
[1:55:49] of God Amen
[1:55:52] the work was he said it is
[1:55:57] finished the work of redemption but it
[1:55:59] is completed for the Gentile
[1:56:02] dispensation at the going away of the
[1:56:05] the Bride of Jesus
[1:56:07] Christ then he turns to the
[1:56:09] Jews you see him already turning to the
[1:56:12] Jews you see the red haers and all these
[1:56:15] different things and Israel's in war and
[1:56:17] and everything like that and uh you know
[1:56:19] what what's kind of funny and I'll just
[1:56:21] share this with you
[1:56:22] um uh people see that more of a sign of
[1:56:25] the end time Believers a sign of the end
[1:56:28] time than Malachi 4 sometimes hey man
[1:56:31] we've received our last sign turned his
[1:56:34] back to the audience I I give you your
[1:56:37] last sign just as MDC had his back
[1:56:41] turned to the tent and he revealed the
[1:56:43] secrets that was in Sarah's heart
[1:56:45] brother brandom done the exact same
[1:56:47] thing what was he showing as it was in
[1:56:49] the days of lot so shall it be he said I
[1:56:52] give you your last sign we have received
[1:56:55] our last sign no matter what goes on in
[1:56:57] the world so we should turn to the
[1:56:59] message of the hour which is Christ
[1:57:02] instead of turning to CNN instead of
[1:57:04] turning to Fox
[1:57:07] News amen
[1:57:11] okay
[1:57:13] uh anointed ones at the end time 1965
[1:57:17] notice the very day when this messenger
[1:57:19] not when he starts on but when he begins
[1:57:22] to declare his message see the first
[1:57:25] pull healing second pull prophesying
[1:57:27] third pull opening of the word the
[1:57:28] Mysteries revealed no more there is no
[1:57:31] more higher order to reveal the word
[1:57:33] than prophets but the only way the
[1:57:35] prophet can be Vindicated is by the word
[1:57:38] and remember the third pool was the
[1:57:40] opening of them seals to reveal the
[1:57:43] hidden truth that's been sealed in the
[1:57:46] word do you see
[1:57:48] it so what was God doing to brother
[1:57:50] brandham he was getting him apart in a
[1:57:53] desert place in Arizona just like he did
[1:57:55] with Moses and just like he did with
[1:57:57] Paul and he was giving him the
[1:57:59] revelation of the word for this day in
[1:58:02] which we are now living
[1:58:07] in and that's what God has to do to us
[1:58:09] sometimes God has to get us to a a
[1:58:12] desert
[1:58:13] Place feels like we're all
[1:58:16] alone it's
[1:58:18] dusty it's dirty
[1:58:23] we got no friends around
[1:58:24] us you don't get invited to things that
[1:58:28] other people get invited to in the
[1:58:30] church and you just feel all by
[1:58:32] yourself but I want you to remember this
[1:58:36] that God uses desert places in our lives
[1:58:39] just like he did with the Apostle Paul
[1:58:41] just like he did with Moses just like he
[1:58:44] did with brother brandom he's going to
[1:58:46] do it to you and
[1:58:50] I Wilderness experience es desert
[1:58:53] experiences are not always a sign that
[1:58:55] God is rebuking you but rather it is a
[1:58:58] time of molding and shaping of your
[1:59:01] character when God had delivered Israel
[1:59:03] through the Red Sea he led them three
[1:59:06] days into the Wilderness to test their
[1:59:10] Faith remember what God remember what
[1:59:12] happened to Jesus whenever uh whenever
[1:59:16] the the spirit like a Dove came down
[1:59:18] upon him where did it lead him to
[1:59:22] desert Place led him into the Wilderness
[1:59:25] why so that his faith might be Tried by
[1:59:28] Satan the trying of your faith bringeth
[1:59:31] forth pure
[1:59:34] gold bringeth forth character which is
[1:59:37] the only thing that we're going to have
[1:59:39] with us on the other
[1:59:41] side I like that especially those of us
[1:59:45] who don't like how you look and and all
[1:59:46] that stuff you know right now and
[1:59:48] everything hey when we get over there
[1:59:50] you'll be perfect amen yeah you'll look
[1:59:54] like a 20 20year old you in shape how
[1:59:57] nice will that be I'm 36 I don't think
[2:00:00] I'm past that yet am I maybe I can get
[2:00:02] back
[2:00:03] there we'll
[2:00:06] see let's see here okay I'll try to
[2:00:10] hurry up Mo uh Exodus 15: 22-2 so Moses
[2:00:15] brought Israel from the Red Sea and they
[2:00:17] went out into the Wilderness of sh and
[2:00:18] they went three days in the wilderness
[2:00:20] and found no water and when they came to
[2:00:22] Mara they could not drink of the Waters
[2:00:24] of Mara for they were bitter therefore
[2:00:26] the name of it was called Mara what was
[2:00:28] happening they had bitterness in their
[2:00:30] hearts they got sticky because they were
[2:00:32] being led into a Wilderness experience
[2:00:34] when God leads you to the Wilderness
[2:00:36] don't get bitter get happy because God
[2:00:40] is doing something in your life the
[2:00:42] people murmured against Moses saying
[2:00:44] what shall we drink and he cried onto
[2:00:46] the Lord and showed him a a tree which
[2:00:48] when he had cast into the waters the
[2:00:50] waters were made sweet there he made for
[2:00:52] them a statue and an ordinance that
[2:00:54] there he proved them what was he proven
[2:00:58] to them he was proven to them that he
[2:01:00] was their
[2:01:01] provider that he was with them but it
[2:01:04] took something Supernatural for them to
[2:01:06] realize that God was with them
[2:01:09] understand the supernatural it just
[2:01:11] catches our attention but the Bible says
[2:01:13] blessed is he who has not seen yet
[2:01:20] believes Hallelujah
[2:01:23] let me skip some stuff
[2:01:25] here Jesus himself when he was baptized
[2:01:28] he entered into the Wilderness for 40
[2:01:30] days Luke 9: 11 and 12 and the people
[2:01:33] when they knew it followed him and he
[2:01:35] received them and spake unto them of the
[2:01:37] kingdom of God and he healed them that
[2:01:39] had need of healing and when the day
[2:01:41] began to wear away then came the TW and
[2:01:44] said unto him send the multitude away
[2:01:46] that they may go into the towns and
[2:01:47] Country roundabout and lodge and get
[2:01:49] vict VI victuals for we are here in a
[2:01:54] desert place where was Jesus leading the
[2:01:57] people that they may receive their
[2:01:59] healings and deliverances in a desert
[2:02:02] Place Mark 6:
[2:02:04] 34-36 and Jesus when he came out saw
[2:02:06] much people and was moved with
[2:02:07] compassion toward them because they were
[2:02:10] as sheep not having a shepherd and he
[2:02:12] began to teach them many things and when
[2:02:14] the day was now far spent his disciples
[2:02:16] came on to him and said this is a desert
[2:02:19] place and now the time is far pasted
[2:02:22] where was he Leading the People to
[2:02:24] desert places am places of
[2:02:28] uncomfortableness places of wilderness
[2:02:31] places that it would seem where our
[2:02:32] needs are not be met being met but
[2:02:35] that's where God leads his
[2:02:38] people Jesus himself took his disciples
[2:02:41] into a desert place to teach them the
[2:02:44] things of God you see God uses desert
[2:02:48] places in our lives
[2:02:52] let's read our opening scripture
[2:02:55] Deuteronomy 8:
[2:02:59] 2-6 and follow along with
[2:03:03] me and it says and thou shalt verse two
[2:03:06] says and thou shalt remember all the way
[2:03:09] which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40
[2:03:11] years in the
[2:03:13] wilderness now he's going to share with
[2:03:16] us why they were LED Into the
[2:03:19] Wilderness and I want you to put your
[2:03:22] name there within that scripture within
[2:03:25] that that example don't just leave it as
[2:03:27] a story but apply it to yourself that's
[2:03:31] when the minister says when you see
[2:03:33] yourself in the book this is what we're
[2:03:36] talking
[2:03:38] abouten when you see you put you in the
[2:03:41] behold I send you Elijah that's me
[2:03:44] behold I send Stephen so now we're going
[2:03:46] to look through this and we're going to
[2:03:48] see why God sends us as Believers to
[2:03:51] desert places
[2:03:54] he says uh uh the 40 years in the
[2:03:56] wilderness to Humble thee and to prove
[2:04:00] thee to know what was in thine heart
[2:04:03] whether thou wouldest keepest keep his
[2:04:06] Commandments or no so why is he leading
[2:04:10] Us in verse two it's to Humble us it's
[2:04:13] to prove
[2:04:15] us and my interpretation of that is for
[2:04:18] us to see what's in our hearts right of
[2:04:22] how much we really love God because he
[2:04:24] already knows what's in our hearts amen
[2:04:27] verse
[2:04:28] three and he humbled thee and he
[2:04:32] suffered thee with Mana which thou
[2:04:34] knewest not neither did thy fathers know
[2:04:37] that he might make thee to know that man
[2:04:39] does not live by bread only but by every
[2:04:42] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[2:04:44] the Lord doth Man live what's he doing
[2:04:48] with us in verse four in verse three
[2:04:51] he's saying that man May learn to live
[2:04:54] by not bread alone but by every word
[2:04:59] that
[2:05:00] proceeds out of the mouth of God every
[2:05:03] word that's written within this
[2:05:05] scripture I'm going to take you to a
[2:05:07] desert place that you might have faith
[2:05:09] in my written word to know not to live
[2:05:13] by bread alone but to have your faith in
[2:05:16] my promised
[2:05:20] word verse four thy reignment wax not
[2:05:24] old upon thee neither did thy foot swell
[2:05:27] these 40 years what was he wanting us to
[2:05:30] know here that God provides all of our
[2:05:35] needs it's in real desert experiences
[2:05:39] that we realize that God is our only
[2:05:42] provider
[2:05:44] yes verse 5 Thou shalt also consider in
[2:05:47] thine heart that as a man chastens his
[2:05:49] son so the Lord thy God chastens
[2:05:52] the why does he bring us to desert
[2:05:54] places to chasen us to correct us to get
[2:05:59] us alone like a good father does he
[2:06:02] never embarrasses or spanks his kids in
[2:06:04] front of anybody else but he takes him
[2:06:07] into a room separate and he treats him
[2:06:10] with respect and corrects out of love
[2:06:14] that's what God does with us as
[2:06:16] Believers takes us aside into a desert
[2:06:19] place and he gives us a good old
[2:06:22] weapon you know what chances are we
[2:06:25] never got a spanking we never
[2:06:27] deserved
[2:06:29] yeah one way or another we deserved it
[2:06:33] whether it was heavy-handed or
[2:06:35] not hey yeah I did wrong and I deserve
[2:06:39] it father forgive
[2:06:41] me what does it bring in our lives it
[2:06:44] brings
[2:06:46] peace you know as a father what I've
[2:06:49] noticed with my with my children
[2:06:51] especially my
[2:06:52] boys you know
[2:06:54] boys particularly they respond to to
[2:06:58] being
[2:06:59] chastised and it brings a peace in their
[2:07:01] heart and a love for Dad and a respect
[2:07:05] that kids who don't get chastened or
[2:07:08] spanked however you want to say it they
[2:07:10] don't have that same love and respect
[2:07:11] for their kids my father-in-law I
[2:07:15] whenever they have our kids I give them
[2:07:17] full Authority hey Whip them if you feel
[2:07:22] they need it you give it to them and
[2:07:24] that makes him so
[2:07:26] happy I ain't I ain't one of these dads
[2:07:29] and my wife isn't one of these moms that
[2:07:31] hey don't you dare touch my that's my
[2:07:33] kid Papa that's my kid Mama nope they're
[2:07:37] out of line in your house your rules you
[2:07:40] deal with it as you should you know my
[2:07:43] boys have such a love for their
[2:07:45] papa they listen they respect him they
[2:07:49] can't wait to run and give him a hug
[2:07:51] while why because love is
[2:07:55] corrective it's almost a
[2:07:58] paradox but God does that with us when
[2:08:02] do we feel the love of God most in our
[2:08:04] hearts is when he corrects us and we're
[2:08:09] sorry and we repent and we say father I
[2:08:13] am so sorry I'm a silly person I've made
[2:08:18] this mistake I did this I did that I
[2:08:20] said that I didn't mean to Lord please
[2:08:22] forgive me when does it come after the
[2:08:27] correction it yields that Peaceable love
[2:08:29] and spirit within our lives we say wow
[2:08:33] thank you
[2:08:34] Lord verse
[2:08:37] six therefore Thou shalt keep the
[2:08:40] Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk
[2:08:41] in his ways and to fear Him what is it
[2:08:45] what what is this Wilderness experience
[2:08:47] doing is teaching us to walk in his ways
[2:08:50] and to fear Him as the musicians come
[2:08:52] this morning we'll bring this to a
[2:08:56] close Moses David Paul brother brandom
[2:09:00] and even the Lord Jesus himself they all
[2:09:02] spent time in a desert place before God
[2:09:06] could use them for something greater in
[2:09:09] their
[2:09:10] lives and it's no different with you and
[2:09:13] I God ain't is going to give you some
[2:09:17] big position or something like this or
[2:09:19] whatever it may be that a lot of people
[2:09:21] are chasing after until first that
[2:09:23] person has been
[2:09:25] proven until that person has met God and
[2:09:29] face to face in a Wilderness
[2:09:32] experience God ain't going to just go
[2:09:36] ahead and start playing there brother
[2:09:38] whatever whatever song you want uh God
[2:09:41] just doesn't let us get away with
[2:09:45] anything he doesn't just leave us out
[2:09:47] here to live whatever kind of life we
[2:09:49] want
[2:09:51] but he leads us to places of sometimes
[2:09:54] Darkness places of desert
[2:09:58] dry Dusty
[2:10:01] hard sometimes it seems like unlivable
[2:10:05] circumstances and he gets us all by
[2:10:07] ourselves and all
[2:10:09] alone and a lot of times we think in our
[2:10:12] lives well it's
[2:10:14] because God doesn't love
[2:10:17] me and I'm here and I'm struggling and
[2:10:20] this and that and
[2:10:22] we have a big old pity party for
[2:10:26] ourselves but really it's the love of
[2:10:30] God that's leading us to those places in
[2:10:33] our
[2:10:34] Lives why is he doing it just like he
[2:10:37] did with Moses just like he did with
[2:10:40] Paul just like he did with brother
[2:10:42] brandham and just like he did with
[2:10:44] Jesus so that he could meet him face to
[2:10:47] face and so that he could reveal his
[2:10:50] word onto them and God does the exact
[2:10:53] same thing with you and
[2:10:56] I he has such a desire to reveal his
[2:11:00] word to you in a personal way he has
[2:11:03] such a desire to make himself known to
[2:11:05] you in a such a uh I would say a
[2:11:09] romantic way
[2:11:10] almost that he gets you by yourself away
[2:11:14] from the crowds of people away from
[2:11:17] family away from loved ones away from
[2:11:20] church people sometimes even though
[2:11:22] you're in church he gets you a little
[2:11:25] separated why because his love for you
[2:11:28] is so great and he has such a passion
[2:11:32] that he wants to have a an intimate
[2:11:34] relationship with you he knows that he
[2:11:36] can't do it with other voices in the
[2:11:39] way so he pulls us back he gets us alone
[2:11:44] through circumstances of
[2:11:46] life and he says here I am here's my
[2:11:50] love
[2:11:52] here's my
[2:11:53] word I'm going to reveal myself to you
[2:11:57] now you're in a place where you're not
[2:11:58] distracted by the world you're all by
[2:12:01] yourself it's just where I want
[2:12:04] you perhaps many of you here this
[2:12:08] morning you've been there and you've
[2:12:11] done
[2:12:12] that but you didn't exactly know why God
[2:12:15] was doing it now you
[2:12:18] know perhaps some of you are in this
[2:12:20] very place right now in your
[2:12:23] lives a desert place you fill in the
[2:12:28] blank I want you to know that God has a
[2:12:31] purpose for this desert
[2:12:33] place it is not a time for you to give
[2:12:36] in it is not a time for you to walk out
[2:12:40] it is not a time for you to quit it's
[2:12:43] not a time for you to lay down and stay
[2:12:45] down no it is a time for you to seek God
[2:12:49] it is a time for you to be intimate with
[2:12:52] God to reach out and say father here I
[2:12:54] am all by myself I'm no one else's but
[2:12:58] yours now speak to my heart and use me
[2:13:02] as you
[2:13:04] would let's all Stand
[2:13:09] Together praise the
[2:13:12] Lord I trust
[2:13:15] that uh the next time you're in a
[2:13:19] situation that you you look at the
[2:13:21] bigger
[2:13:23] picture winners never quit and quitters
[2:13:26] never
[2:13:29] win just because you're in a Wilderness
[2:13:32] experience let me let me say this

[2:21:54] to share this little something from my
[2:21:55] own past if you don't mind for a moment
[2:21:58] you know when I was a backslid young man
[2:22:01] I don't know why exactly I drifted to
[2:22:03] the South but uh lived in Arizona for a
[2:22:06] while roamed to and fro amen kind of
[2:22:09] like the homeless people I understand
[2:22:11] them because I slept in my pickup I
[2:22:13] slept on porches couches wherever I
[2:22:16] could find a place but this is a part
[2:22:18] brother Steven that struck me I have
[2:22:21] witnessed in the desert of
[2:22:25] Arizona the Desert Bloom and if you've
[2:22:28] never witnessed the desert blooming you
[2:22:31] will be amazed when you see it with your
[2:22:34] own eyes you can drive up towards Black
[2:22:37] Canyon heading on up 17 towards
[2:22:40] Flagstaff and to see the mountains
[2:22:42] covered with the most beautiful flowers
