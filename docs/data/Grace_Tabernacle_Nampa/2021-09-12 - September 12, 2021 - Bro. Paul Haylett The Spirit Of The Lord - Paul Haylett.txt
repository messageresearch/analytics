friend friend's father passed away and they're trying to get his dog that are being blocked in every path just one ask for prayer for them as they find the dog and they would know that it was jesus who brought him back and so we just want to pray for this need isaac has asked that we remember rachel in prayer she had a biopsy on her lymph nodes and are they've been bothering her after she had cancer treatment she finds out the results tomorrow desires prayers for a good report amen brother trevor's asset remember sister it's a car right yeah she was supposed to have surgery to remove a tumor from her pancreas so we just want to remember her in prayer for the chris if you come and just remember these needs you know we've been continually remember grandma jerry sean sister concha i

little holiday and be with uh emmy's parents if you just remember us as we'll be traveling on the roads or we'll just keep us safe man it's good to be back with y'all thanks for your prayers we had a wonderful time last weekend and god really moved and just kept hearing testimonies of what god did when we were there so we're just so thankful let's bow our heads heavenly father jesus you know the needs we have this morning lord among us and those that are written down lord jesus and father we know that you answer prayer every single time or sometimes we have a misunderstanding of how you'll answer that prayer but you never fail to answer prayer lord i pray you would just lord come down on these requests lord you know them father you know the very heart of the of the matter lord jesus i pray you'd go to each one more those that need healing touch them father lord may you just um come down on their needs or jesus we asked for the service this morning that you'd speak to our hearts lord and you'd move the speaker aside father we're looking forward to hearing from you lord jesus and by the way thank you for bringing back our brother sergey lord safely and sister thomas as well lord so glad to have them back in our med store i think for the facilities out on the road lord may keep him safe protect him father and we also pray for brother prashant sister conscious lord and we

once again pray you blessed the tithes and the offerings this morning may all be done for the glory of god we ask these things in your name the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated as we get ready to turn this earth to our pasture let's sing that little song number three 64. undefiled [Music] real pure lives it's a world of compromise [Music] [Music] no matter what [Applause] [Music] and when we walk down the street [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] it [Music] hallelujah good to be here today amen i i'm amazed at just how precise sometimes the lord works brother jason and i didn't even have any conversation concerning the service today uh but that song right there i think would be the perfect one uh to uh to go with our thought today amen so i don't embarrass nobody but um you know it's interesting in our minds we often think of ourselves as still being young right we look back when we say and i just want to say to our sister to betha we knew her as a child and we weren't much more than a child and uh the years passed so quickly and we think of ourselves as young until we look around and we have grandchildren and gray hair and uh so god bless you to bethenny and your friend i believe it's david yes we welcome you today and pray the lord will just bless you and your time here with us i just want to take a moment just to share a little something with you uh certainly we never share these things as a boast of what any of us have ever done right because if there's any good thing in us it's jesus christ amen we've we can never stand on our own merits and say i've done this i've done that but i just wanted to share with you for the first time and forgive me if my memory is not quite correct there'd be here those here that probably could help correct that but i think it's been something in the region of 12 years since they have had a major get-together of the brethren and families in the ukraine for special meetings and so this time right now it's off eight o'clock at night i think um so they're that much ahead of us um would be the closing uh of the ending of these meetings that they have had brother barry and brother uh brother barry coffey and brother burly williams that went over there and ministered and brother barry has had you know many friendships through the years uh over there and and influence and uh my you know it's always in times like this you forget but uh different different places um that they used to have special meetings there and you know of course the change of countries and boundaries and political things change all of that and so they've now had these meetings uh i think oh it was alusco they used to have meetings ever every year very large meetings and and different places like that and then because of the rise of uh communism and their control over these countries things change and so this year they've had um had these special meetings there and uh sister yulia's family has a great burden her brother pavel which is very dear to us we i think can uniformly say that we love brother pavel went and has worked as an interpreter there and uh we have worked with sister yuli's dad i always call him brother sergey senior to separate them in my mind i don't know if there's a senior to the senior or not but anyway that's how i separate brother sergey our brother sergey and his father-in-law so brother sergey senior uh had approached us and we have worked with him and i i just want to uh uh just let you know that uh you have sent somewhere in the region of 50 plus people to that camp those who had no financial ability to go and you think oh my brother paul that must be but you see there's a difference in the culture for around 45 to 55 dollars they could catch the train they could have a bed to sleep in and meals to eat and attend the service and if you can you know change a family change a young person's life for 55 dollars that is such a small investment and uh so i just felt instead of keeping it you know something behind the scenes there is um in the workings of the church i'll say there's many things that you have done that you probably will never know you did uh but that's just in the behind the scenes of the working of the church but i just thought it might be a nice blessing for you to know that you have sent parents and teenagers and whatnot to this meetings for such in my mind an economical value for them to be able to get on a train and whatever town they are brother sergey shared with me that many of these financially would never be able to do that even though some of them expressed to him our teenagers need it really stirred my heart you know when you think okay here's a family that they know their children need it they know that they need it and it seemingly is beyond their grasp but you see god does not put anything out there in the heart of his believers but what he provides a way to satisfy that right a deep calling to the deep and so i just want to say thank you it is your contributions it is your support of this church that makes that possible and i just pray as we stand before the lord one day because the scripture says that we will that when we receive our crown of reward that may god be gracious to us and let us wrap our arms around uh someone that you had an impact in their life someone you may never meet will more than likely in fact 99 point and let's run the nines as far as you can run them we'll never meet them on this earth but you will have had an eternal impact on their lives by something and i say this as simple as a few dollars so god bless you and thank you for your faithful support here church because without that faithful support one we wouldn't have a building we wouldn't have nothing it takes people that's why and i'm going to throw this on the tail and that's why i don't like people to say this is brother paul's church because if brother paul was standing here this morning looking at an empty building one there would be no building and there would be no need to call it grace tabernacle because it would just be one person but you as body of faithful god-loving faithful faith-filled people make this what it is today so amen let's just stand as we go to the word today amen i just felt led to share that you know and and i guess i'll throw this out make this a missionary report uh you uh have a continued support of the saints and here again it's not a large number but you have a continued support of the believers in venezuela that are without food without medicine without that and that work is is uh supported through believers international brother george and he has connections there and a continual steady you don't want to draw the attention of of anyone so things are just done on a very low key process and uh in that though imagine that you would break down in tears because you've seen the first tube of toothpaste that you have seen for a year see it's not always just about the gospel right these are believers these are christians and they are dire believers imagine saints now i'm not going to play on your sympathy but imagine that our lives would change so radical and it's possible it will that we would entertain eating from a garbage can and we have it within our ability to help in a token amount support these people people who are living virtually on the street because the gangs and different things have taken over their whole neighborhoods and specifically told you're not welcome in this neighborhood any longer when it was their neighborhood it's their home and now they're homeless and now they're fleeing they walk hundreds of kilometers through the forest to get to the borders of colombia and these neighboring countries only to be told go back and so now they live in the forest sounds fun if you're 12. so just keep them in prayer and i just want you to once again that in a small fashion we are continuing to support those believers also so amen well let's turn our bibles today i just want you to know that i feel very happy in my heart this morning amen brother david i would just share with you first john the fourth chapter verses one through six brother david i will share with you i changed the title of this sermon about ten times this morning alone as i'm studying something just go this direction and it seemed like i'm back this direction and back to this direction and then i think this will make you all happy except for we'll see how long i actually take but i just then chopped everything in half and i probably still have too much amen first john the fourth chapter first verse amen beloved believe not every spirit see this is what christians are being commanded now to do believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god so we have a sure word of prophecy as the scripture says that has opened to us we are not sitting here now in ignorance to know what we should try the spirits with because it has been placed back to us over and over again the word take it back to the word test it with the word and some people say you know brother paul i've had this spoke to me but paul you just say that so much it's become redundant well let me just tell you i will be redundant till the coming of the lord amen because i want you just i i won't do this i didn't include the quote but the prophet of god saying that here we are speaking of ministers what we are going to do is we are going to share the truth of the gospel to the coming of the lord because we love the people enough not just a meal ticket not just an office to be fulfilled but you love the people enough to tell them the truth and so it's there in that knowing that the people will then come into the presence of god these are not exact words but then people will come into the presence of god rejoicing because they would be found as the apostle paul said walking in the truth i tell you what sometimes i think we ought to just stop and lift our hands and say thank you lord that we can walk in the truth we that we don't have to be beaten into the truth condemned into the truth we can just simply by revelation be found walking in the truth because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god now my brother and sister this could be something that people would make an argument and i i i'm i need to just read the scripture and i'll preach to you amen confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world ye are of god little children and over have overcome them because greater is he that is in you can someone say amen today greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and we'll we'll speak on that in a minute they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god and he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of air amen heavenly father we just ask for your hand of mercy lord open the words that we would be anointed to speak today father let there be your words not our words and lord for every need father lord just those in our midst today and those that are not we just ask you father come and touch each heart and the heart's desire lord that you would just come and heal us lord strengthen us give us a courage bold to stand in the world that we live in today we ask this in the precious name of jesus christ and the congregation said amen you may be seated saints amen now i want to just go back into this for just a moment and just to touch on this because it's not really my subject it is you might say the prelude to to our thought today so as we'll look at this my brother and sister we see that as we look at this it says um year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and i just feel led to jump a little ways ahead in my my sermon here and i want you to if just if you can follow me focus here please amen something uh that we kind of touched on just a little bit here and there touched on a wednesday night a little bit now the word magnify amen i love that old song let magnify the lord in me amen you know that's what we're looking to do my brother and sister not just to be christians in name only but we want to actually be the living walking talking magnification of jesus christ in the day that we live in now as it says here the word greater we come down here into the definition of magnify to make something greater so greater is he that is in you what is that jesus christ magnified in you not just a verbal thing but christ himself magnified in us is what makes us greater than the spirits of this world makes us greater than any circumstance that surrounds us now we can have a form of godliness and if we deny the power of god to change us my brother and sister we are allowing ourselves to be pickpocketed amen because the word has been given to us and if we let the devil just come and snatch that away from us you you just uh look don't do that i'll tell you as we have traveled over the world and been in these countries and in one particular time you know we were down in uh san bernardino which is a suburb of santiago and it's what you would call the bad side of town and uh we're walking along and and the the stores all had uh like like used to be downtown caldwell and whatever and all the entries to the stores were in an angle you know in their glass with the doors and i'm walking along and i noticed this same guy is just constantly about six steps behind me and uh it kind of dawned on me you know it's like hey this guy is up to no good because we stop he stops we start he starts and finally i just had enough of it you know i had a brother tell me later he says you're lucky he didn't stab your hide but you know i finally just stopped and turned around to him and told him you get out of here before you get hurt i obviously understood english but you look at that my brother and sister now what it is is this is just i say this because this is a way that the devil works he will follow you for years until he can steal your joy he will follow you for years till he can steal your testimony amen he can steal as it were revelation where we not revelation is us really seeing who we are right because the word doesn't change but what is the changing is the enlightenment as it were of christ in you and when we see who we are the devil's going to be quick and we'll have a little quote here in a bit to touch on this the devil will be quick to come in there and try and cut that off because he ever sees you take the final step he knows he's lost you aren't you glad today that we have been by god's grace taken the final step into the revelation of who we are in jesus christ amen a seventh seal my brother and sister is not a language it is a life-changing event to you and i it is not a something to check off in the bible but it is christ coming down in the fullness of revelation to realize that we are oh i had a terrible day yesterday well my brother and sister you're still redeemed good day bad day sunny day rainy day that has nothing to do with the price and the decision that god made to save you hallelujah and we live in such a world where the devil comes and we just feel so bummed because nothing is right we're chomping corn and my brother back to pit tractor into a big concrete block and caved in a rim and the first reports my brother and sister they come back to me sadly enough is people that work for me and they come back with this report it ruined the rim and it ruined the tire and i in my mind i'm sitting there thinking okay those tires are are 32 3 400 a piece and the rim is just as expensive and i felt myself kind of deflating just and god spoke to me and says is this who you are a rim and a tire no i'm much greater than a remnant attire i'm a son of god hallelujah so then finally we look at it and and uh the tire wasn't ruined it just had big scuff marks on the side of it and the rim well i give you know we're born with gifts and my brother definitely he could cut your car in half put it back together and it'd still drive and work just fine anyway beat that whole thing together and in the end of the day it cost us almost nothing to fix it but you see the devil come with his bucket of cold water and i just use that example saints just as it's kind of a sorry out there example but you see we can let these little things in our life put such a damper on our life when we are much greater than all of this because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so everything of this world amen christ in you magnified now i want to ask you this morning is he magnified hallelujah he is so real he's so alive he's so powerful and he's so loving and kind he is magnified to his people hallelujah amen now as we look at this i just want you as we move real quickly here he said you've overcome them because magnified i'm not trying to change the scripture i want you to catch this because magnified is he that is in you amen so we're not looking now we see the prophecy of our day uh says that uh i'm paraphrasing this but it says a prophecy our day that they'll walk around groping in darkness amen not of sound mind not of direction not firm in their beliefs then these all come out of the word and definitions but kind of put together in that fashion now look what's happening in the world we live in right now my brother and sister we see a government of what we always thought was the greatest nation on earth and we see a government now groping in darkness and i i'm going to sound counterintuitive to kind of how my political feelings are but actually i'm starting to come to feel sorry for them and you know why because prophecy said they would be groping in darkness so here are these men who are making and i will go this far making complete fools of themselves but prophecy has to be fulfilled there's no way to get around this the word of god will come to pass now what did the word say about you now if we're looking out here seeing that out there what's happening and saying and we can declare from a hook that must come to pass now when the word is speaking of you must it now not come to pass i'm telling you my brother and sister that the word is coming to pass and christ is being magnified and it says those who would say he come in the flesh and we can argue this point but remember the prophet said that the scripture has two full meanings and so we see that jesus christ come in the flesh and people around the whole world recognize that yes jesus christ come in the flesh but what about him in the flesh today what about him in the 21st century in a world of gross darkness come is he in the flesh or not the scripture says if you can't recognize him in the flesh then there's something wrong because god has a revelation and that revelation has been laid out now so clearly marked for us that god said i need a habitation i need a temple not made with hands oh that was jesus christ well jesus christ is as it were not on the earth today but you are and he is in you and he said i'll be with you even in you amen do you believe that i believe he's with me i believe he's with me saints but i'm going to take that to the next step as the word has taken the next step and declare he's in me hallelujah and it does not matter what the world thinks about it what theology and the message thinks about it this is the word of god hallelujah he's in me hallelujah and so i'm not anointed by the spirit of the antichrist to sit here and deny he's in me well that's just what the scripture said i'm going to defend the scripture if the scripture can't defend itself as it were what good am i going to do trying to defend it and i'll say the same thing about the message if the message as it were will not defend itself then what good would it do for me to spend hours days weeks years defending the message well praise the lord amen god didn't call you to defend it he called you to live it so let's quit all of our little fussing about who's right and who's wrong i just read a quote this morning brother brown said everyone paraphrased here again everyone who is trying to achieve the same goal that i have i will call brother amen that's hard i did a little repenting this morning saints because there's times that i've been real quick just to say well they're off in this thing and they're off on that thing we'll just close that door and close this door and if you're not careful pretty soon you find yourself in a room all alone you see sometimes we just have to let god be god and let him take control hallelujah amen now look as we we're looking here i want to go into acts 19. i need to put a little note on the pulpit paul keep moving keep moving and god brought special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought into the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them now my brother and sister you will see that it's not a very far step from here until idolatry that's right not a very far step right you see these were given of god anointed by the spirit and brother branham even talks about this in the message how that oral roberts used to say okay now reach out and touch your radio or touch your television and brother brown talked about that point of contact you can find it under those words point of contact and sometimes we as humans god designed us he's the one who brought us back he knows that we need something to connect to and so it's there as it was with these believers that when these uh handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from the body of paul the believers were not moving into idolatry worshiping objects but they were there as a point of contact recognizing this is a holy man this is a man of god and he cared enough someone cared enough for me to bring a token as it were to stir my heart and you see the prophet also explains it that it's not someone else's faith it's not someone else's doing it's your faith so it's a little catalyst right we've been preaching on the key a little catalyst or a little key to unlock their faith and it was there that says diseases departed from and evil spirits went out of them amen that's no small thing saints that's no small thing then certain of the vagabond jews exorcist now right exorcist go look it up they were the ones that went around uh casting out or attempting to cast out evil spirits now my brother and sister obviously they're not always 100 successful obviously it's there there's a certain element of influence but these people existed people paid them them money they uh you know i made a living had a position in the community did it line up with the word not really come on oh no you'll find the pattern in the word but what they were doing didn't line up with the word see there's where we have to be really careful that we're not following a pattern of the word the gospel my brother and sister of jesus christ is the word with power and authority so we can just preach and preach and preach we can preach john 3 16 until we're just blue in the face and fall over and nobody will give their heart to the lord nobody will change right but when you have the power of god john 3 16 comes and strikes somebody's heart and says i could be saved my life could be changed i could be in love with jesus christ and then there's something happens amen so you look at this a certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we adjure you or that word in its deeper meaning means beg you see that's how far you can take the word a juror down it can be a command a request and ultimately at the end of its definition it can be a begging remember we preached on begging the other day to approach god as beggars no my brother and sister we don't come and like oh lord lord i'm just no good i'm no good you need to do something for me come and say lord according to the word i am giving you my heart and soul and i have repented and i'm asking you to wash my life and change me oh that don't sound humble enough my brother and sister the power of god will make you bold not bold in an arrogant fashion but bold to reach out and claim a promise does that make sense because it's not talking about a boldness as a individual or their personality it's a boldness to say i want to i want that i want that lord and i'm willing i'm willing lord to submit myself to yield myself to approach you father because i'm claiming that there were seven sons of one siva the jew and chief of the priest which did so and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but who are you now i want to ask you the same question the spirits today know jesus they know the apostle paul yes sir who are you amen are we approaching god correctly amen because if we are approaching him incorrectly those spirits right there and the man whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded you know my brother and sister i hope i hope you follow me this morning you see their reputation as exorcists as people of authority is forever shattered forever shattered and all we can say is thank you lord right we don't want the fake we want the real amen hallelujah you see now oh i hope you can catch this as it was a side thought you see what's happened my brother and sister that in the united states i use this country as an example in the united states we used to everything you bought was made in the united states right hardly anything come from anywhere else now the natural and the spiritual type so what did we do we started wanting something that cost us less we don't want to pay the price so we started going and it started and it moved from one country to another country another country and now believe it or not even china is too expensive for some of these countries and so now they're going into the countries that have no exposure when was the last time you heard about a sweat camp in malaysia or indonesia you see and that's the world and what it is type it back to the spiritual no one wants to pay the price for the life of christ so what do we do we go and we start settling for cheaper less less less less less less until it comes down to our name is on a book and we feel comfortable we're willing to trade the effort of writing our name in a membership book believing that that is sufficient price for eternal life so we see this spirit looks at these people and he's telling them quite boldly to their face i know jesus and i know paul but i don't have a clue who you are and because i don't have a clue who you are i know that you are not in a position of authority because i satan know everyone who has a position of authority did you know amen we can preach about this we get excited about this the lord knows my name he knows mine do you know the devil knows every son or daughter of god he's looking he's searching the earth and everyone that shows any sign of a desire to serve god he can recognize them and when he sees them growing spiritually he starts to then put that and watch them and start to categorize them and when he sees that they have tapped into the power and the authority of almighty god it is there that we recognize when he starts to be concerned he starts to note that your voice come on help me preach this morning your voice according to the word of god has authority in heaven amen you have been given authority to lose that's not a beggar you've been given authority to bind that's not coming from a beggar that's coming from someone who's been granted the ability to step into a position and claim those promises of god those things that are not as though they are if you have something today lacking in your life don't sit back as a beggar before you leave this building today and it's not about the building but just the timing don't leave the building today but what you have bowed your heart and your head to the lord and say lord let me put these things that are keeping me from acting on the word let me put them behind me forever hallelujah because it's not there that we should let the devil control the tempo of our life control the blessings upon our lives asking the devil permission no sir my brother and sister sons and daughters of god don't ask permission of the devil amen in fact we're called to tell the devil where he's going and what it's about hallelujah and so they ran out of the house wounded naked now look what happened see this is god's work you say oh man that's just terrible and we're certainly not glorying in that but i want you to know this was known to all jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell upon them all they suddenly realized this whole thing about spirits is not a game this man come out now we're going to make some assumptions if you'll forgive me not one man with a spirit on him was not a great big huge bodybuilder lift hundreds of pounds guy he was just a man but the spirit of the devil satan strong enough to anoint him to rip up seven men and then we'd like to just live a half-hearted kinda have whatever kind of do whatever and praise the lord i i i love the lord and i believe the message and no i'm sorry to tell you that devil don't care what you think you believe right he wants to know and if he looks and says i don't think no i don't know you i don't know you i tell you what what we want to do is have the devil tremble when we get out of bed in the morning amen and so there was a fear fell upon all the dwelling in ephesus in the name of the lord jesus was magnified people recognize this was a catalyst that god used for people to recognize that these ministers of the gospel that they had saw these things that they might have a thought oh that's a cult that is there that is this that is this then they started to see there's something here there's something happening that man had an evil spirit was delivered from him that young woman evil spirit delivered from here but over here we have the imposters and the spirits are saying i'm not afraid of you i'm not afraid of you i'll show you who's in authority amen and many that believe came and i like this right here because we especially americans we have a real problem confessing our faults oh wait maybe it's the same i don't know i don't want to be too too blunt on anyone but i have been to europe i've been to africa been to south america i've been to australia and we're all the same we have a hard time confessing our faults we have a hard time laying the rubber on the road you know the one i like i know probably most of you have done this so forgive me and i'm with you if sister carrie if if i've ever done anything to offend you that's right with their deeds i lied to them i lied to you i did this i'm sorry we've we've why because the power of the holy spirit didn't just hit the surface it went deep into the heart and something said lord i just gotta come clean this is my brother and sister a real true confession lord forgive me of everything and so there many of them which use curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it 50 000 pieces of silver sometimes serving god does cost you besides your life financially imagine you've got all your book of potions all your book of sayings all your book of ritual and you believed enough to throw it in a pile and burn it amen that's a real conversion amen well unless they were foolish enough by motion to go and turn around bottom all again and then they should just be punished by the cost but look what's happening so mightily grew the word of god amen and prevailed amen i'll tell you what i don't serve a god that has to retreat you never receive god sound or retreat my brother and sister hallelujah now look i want to just hurry up we want to look at the apostle paul for just a second and we see that he come through the correct line right he comes with the correct lineage and he had been trained to the highest degree he even declares and says you know that of those that would be there i i would be uh of the first i would be of the greatest because of where i come from my family and my teachings and my position now imagine what the religious world felt like when they saw paul get converted now i'm going to speak in blunt terms so i hope our guests don't mind too much but my brother and sister when paul got converted the religious world did not just sit back and go don't worry about it they were shook to their very core how could a cult get paul well they called jesus beelzebub and they branded the whole thing as heresy amen that's the the very definition or the very foundation of a cult and so they're they're freaking out about how that that uh the apostle paul as we know him but uh you see him now he slipped off the edge and he just kept going they i no doubt it doesn't really record it in scripture but no doubt many come to him and said paul come back paul come don't get away from them come back here everything will be fine we'll smooth it all over in the church and in the community and we'll tell them it was undercover operation and you just just come back paul and paul was there my brother and sister and god knew the influence of men and he knew the influence of education so paul is now sent to the back side of the desert oh i'll tell you what we hardly get out in the sagebrush and we're like oh lord what's happening to me lord what's going on everything's fell apart i lost my pinch and i lost this i lost that god sent him all the way to the backside of the desert amen he didn't want a partial rejuvenation as it were of paul he wanted a complete transformation amen that's what god's wanting to do in your life and my life he wants us to have a complete transformation not just a religious spirit not just a religious covering but a complete translate uh trans uh formation amen so you know it's like wow paul's now off to the back side of the desert you know and we think well how how can this be but you see god knows where to find his own he knew what he had called uh paul for and so we'll see when god goes to find his own he'll find him from the highest realms of education down to the back alleys of the district and i'm telling you what i don't know if some of you have but i have in life for foolish reasons uh traveled through the alleys of the district in the alleys of the district were pretty scary and you go in there in the flesh and you would look around you i i feel that just drive this home i want our young people not to just go okay okay brother paul's gonna preach a long time again today let me tell you there's many a young person right now that there is a girl or a boy of equal age on the streets in santiago chile selling their body the song that jay sang morals what's going my brother and sister one step at a time they didn't walk out of daddy's door almost door and just walk out and stand on the street corner there was something took him there step after step after step after step amen hear me the preacher needs to be able to preach something that's real for you because he has done it for me and i can tell you with all honesty and truth he is a healer he's a deliverer he gives revelation because by his mercy i have received all of these things not a second-hand religion of this said this said the prophet of god said the prophet of god said we quote those things my brother and sister but it needs to be real down in the heart of a son or daughter of god that when you lay your hand on a child a brother or a sister you're not quoting something or thinking of something out there you are thinking of something that happened to you something that is alive and the problem we have is way too much second-hand message amen way too much second-hand message and not enough personal message oh and we've all been guilty of it and we may be guilty of it again but i say lord help us help us lord hallelujah because you see when these men went out and started to speak these things and make these claims this was not whole follow me this was not the message paul was preaching paul did not say go out and cast out spirits in my name and the prophet of god did not say that either he pointed us clearly clearly back to the altar clearly back to the throne of almighty god it's there in the word and in the word alone there's where we find eternal life hallelujah not second hand no sir hallelujah you see my brother and sister there was such a power that happened there such an authority that happened it shook the city it shook ephesus ephesus amen it shook them because a fear fell over them they didn't say oh well we'll just write a little thing and blog and the gossip column here about something happened on the other side of town no sir a fear went through they said you realize that we witness paul who we thought was maybe a leader of a cult we witness paul speak to those spirits and they leave and we saw these guys over here and we saw these spirits tear them up now i don't want to make emphasis of this my brother and sister but if you walk in in your nice flowing gowns hallelujah just so some of you'll know my wife has graduated me in my clothing from goodwill and deseret industries to costco so we're moving up in the world but when the preacher walks out five thousand dollar suits rolexes aren't even good enough it's a what is it right brighton or something brighting or something is that the new end thing rolex's i mean you just go pawn shop and buy rolex they walked into that house a man possessed of a spirit in their great flowing gowns and they walked in there and said we i cheer you speaking of the god that paul preaches we don't know him we've never experienced the power and demonstration of it but we're gonna addre an evil spirit in other words a spirit right from the throne of the devil in this gospel that paul preaches come on saints don't fall for it don't fall for that spirit don't be looking back the holy ghost is here he said i'll be with you even in you we need to be able to stand here and say praise the lord i've got an experience i've got a testimony amen i maybe not have lived too much of life and went too many places and saw too many scary things but god still moved in my life and i know he is real and when the devil comes amen we don't want to be saying now now in the name of in the name of in the name of in the name of the devil leave me alone that song says in some midnight hour if you should find you were in a prison in your mind tell it to go away concerning the gospel that paul preaches no sir no sir you stand there in that experience i may not have every duck lined up in my life you guys have any ducks i've got rows and rows of ducks and i leave i think they're lined up and i come home and they're not i i don't understand what's happening and i try to line them all back up again and i go out and i live life and i yell at somebody i know none of you ever do that but you also don't deal with a whole herd of truck drivers either and you come home oh you know this embarrassing can i just be open honest with you you know how embarrassing it is to yell at somebody and you can't get five steps away from their truck and something comes down on you and you turn around you go back up forgive me god knows how to keep us humble but he's not worried about so much keeping you humble he's worried about keeping you lined up with the word and when you're lined up with the word you will be humble because you can't be in the word and have an arrogant spirit the word humbles every one of us every single day so the more of jesus we have the humbler we get amen amen where was i my you see this fear of fear fell upon them and the outcome of this is not that nothing happens the outcome is in that jesus christ was magnified amen you see the attention was greater upon those that actually didn't believe but it turned the eyes of certain people back to the truth amen and the fear of god moved in their midst and they said god is real god is real oh i was talking i was talking to you about flowing gowns imagine what it's like you go in there and you've got all these flowing gowns on and you walk in there and you adjure in the name of this gospel that paul is preaching and these same guys come fleeing out the door and i don't want to make too much emphasis on it but they're now tore up they're bloody they're bruised and they're naked none of their robes none of their presentation none of their whatever did them one bit of good amen hallelujah hallelujah look we believe in coming to church wearing our finest but our finest isn't going to save us that's right yeah so as we look at this we recognize that these men recognize the power of god and so they decided we want to use this now i don't think my brother and sister because they refused jesus right jesus said now if you have believed moses the words that moses spoke you would believe the words that i spoke because moses was speaking of me and so when you look at this in this context you'll recognize now that these men saw the power of god and they wanted to use that but they weren't going to give the glory to god i read a quote today you can look it up you can find it brother branham says now if you're not going to use your life for the gospel today don't even come through this prayer line that's pretty strong words why because he's encouraging the people don't come here for your carnal benefit come here to be changed that you can magnify jesus christ so they wanted to use it but they had no revelation so in reality my brother and sister they're just simply imposters going around speaking the name of jesus christ but it is not even with the intent to bring glory or magnify the lord jesus christ amen so god and paul i've got to hurry along here i don't know how time just escapes like this saints god in paul was magnifying the name of jesus christ to the people you will not find anywhere in the scripture it sounds boastful right people are like well look where paul we don't like this paul i paul an apostle of jesus christ no his life backed it up now i met some people that just told me over and over and over again every time i run into them i'm an apostle i'm an apostle you should let me have authority over you i'm an apostle i'm an apostle sorry i don't see any apostle attributes well every tree brings forth his own fruit you know the same kind and you know if it abandons an apostle he don't have to tell you he's an apostle his life will tell you he's an apostle amen you see so paul was magnifying jesus christ to the people and he did that by preaching of the gospel in power and authority and you know we are called today to magnify the name of jesus christ to the people this is not something of a day gone by this is a day that you and i my brother and sister can live a life that is so on fire for god and such a life that the world would say you know what i don't agree with these uh and i'm not boasting myself but i hear this from people all the time uh you know i got all these farmer friends oh preacher paul preacher paul they called me out right to my face oh preacher paul what'd you preach last week and i said i preached on you you ought to see their eyes what do you mean preached on me i said i preached on the unbeliever well i'm not a believer i know god's real so is the devil you know i've got them toughened up they used to be like oh don't talk to me like that now they're like okay why because it's the truth amen but they know i love them and i'll do anything for them yeah just carnal men out here live out here south of town carnal men they know i love them they know i'll do it for them but they know that won't do any good to push paul around because i ain't moving and even if paul wanted to move i couldn't because you see this anchor called christ amen said i'm not going to let you be blown in every direction i'm not going to let you fall for this doctrine and get tossed over here and the wind blows back this way and then the wind blows back this way no sorry i'm anchored amen angry i'm glad i am because you see i quit being a pastor and i quit about everything about at least i don't know 10 000 times in the last few years but i'm still here why because when the wind blows and get blowed away amen all i can say is thank you lord i don't want to sound i don't want to sound boastful i just wanna i'm just telling you i know it's real i know it's real all i gotta do is just believe it confess it and hold on amen so you see we we're not projecting what we think right that's why it's church i'm very careful when i speak to you of things i think that i always say this is paul's opinion you can toss it out if you want because i don't want to present my opinion as gospel to you amen what we want to do project christ amen now look many of you would say you know what brother paul all these things is happening i'm just not equipped i'm not equipped you know to to deal with these spirits i'm not equipped to deal with all of this stuff i i that that's not who i am i'm just a little old lamb i'm just a little believer i've i've only been in the message for just a little bit to i've only served god for just a little bit i'm not i'm no that's that's job of the preachers that's a job to the elders that's a okay well we're going to just go into the bible and we're going to look at this little guy his name was shamgar amen and shamgar you know year after year shamgar was there at the harvest now you know i don't know if you guys can relate to that you've had a garden you can there's just something about being a farmer that when you go out there and and you know the amber waves of grain as it is look really good in a silage pit amen my whole goal is to to chop them up and put it in the pit and it goes across the scale and the man writes me a oh should i talk this way sounds carnal he writes me a big fat check when it's all over the corn's beautiful oh this sounds so carnal but so is that check but it goes much deeper than that there's something in me that just in the springtime look and you see those little plants coming popping up out of the ground and you can see row after row after row you see even though i joke about the carnal side and the check looks good i have this revival every spring time and a reminder as i sit there every seed amen every seed will bring forth of its own kind and i have this revival every year in the springtime and i have a revival for that same every fall when i walk out there here is the seed this is what i put in the ground and this is what it's produced a bountiful harvest and i look at that in the spiritual realm thank you lord i'm not dead cold and wet laying in the dirt somewhere and i'm alive in jesus christ and i get to magnify christ by reproducing christ in the flesh and that's my whole heart my whole desire and i pray and i preach it to you because i want you to grasp that and say you know what i am of his seed he's the one has planted me he's the one who watered me and he's the one as it were will harvest me amen i'm not some wayward seed i'm not a stray i'm not something that was just randomly tossed out but i am intentional in jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah you look at this my brother and sister oh and here's shamgar no doubt i'm sorry i went off on that tangent but here's shamgar at the heart that's going out and and he's looking at the harvest in his heart's like this would be the year this would be the years he looked now brother brown talks about this you can go read it he talks about there's his wife and rags and his little girl little boys they're hungry and they're saying oh daddy is this the year is this the time daddy and the harvest is great the granaries are now full can i put it this way revival has come to the church who's the church is it this building no it is you and i revival has come to the church and we are full of joy and then you hear gem guard be like oh my goodness them rotten no good philistines have come back again but how many times have we set in the house of god set in our car set in our living room set somewhere in the trees or whatever and the spirit of god move upon us and you find yourself weeping and you find yourself saying oh lord oh lord thank you you're so good to me but somewhere in the background now you don't have to lift no hands but i tell you saints i believe most if not every one of us has had the devil show up and steal our joy we've had the devil show up and steal our victory and we sit back and said what can i do what can i do what could i do i'm just a believer i'm i'm not worthy i'm full of mistakes i'm full of mistakes i why would god come on the scene for me now because yesterday i just did this and this why would god answer my prayer i can't even live right jamgar after his little girl and his wife they're ragged clothes and they're hungry and here come the philistines again and you can see old sham garth oh no not again not again it's coming back again now look what brother branham says in the message what is that in the hand this is preached in 1955 saints and i'll tell you for me i could only speak for me it was like it was preached this morning amen this is not something preached way way back off in the deal and then it's all historical this is alive to me this morning just like my bible is alive to me this morning it's not a history we're looking back oh this happened you know this happened brother branham prayed for a possum i can't even pray for a headache don't give up don't give up amen stand on the word don't give up amen faith is growing faith is growing can i say it again faith is growing amen faith is becoming more real today than it was yesterday it is not about some great event where we'll step out and in the name of jesus christ this it will be you speaking victory after victory after victory in your own life amen it will not be about some great public display the prophet of god said the word will no longer be a great public display because the word has now moved down into the bride and it is the bride who is speaking the word and she is speaking the word maybe to those around her because we need friends and brothers and sisters but oftentimes it's just the word being spoke from you to you amen amen or from me to me or i die or however the right words would be you know shamgar looked around he just didn't know what to do he looked around he said i couldn't fight i'm not a fighter and i ain't got time to go out and learn how to duel and take all these exercises and things i haven't got time to run back and start reading the message and reading my bible like i should have for years oh wait that's not in there maybe it is it was right there between the line but he happens to look at the word oh come on forgive me but i'm i'm sorry i just got to preach this inspiration happened to look and set in the corner was that old bible with some dust on it oh let me get back to this center no locks go you know an ox code is it's a big old stick with a brass end on it to knock the punch the cattle through the gate with for one thing and then knocked the dirt off the plow and they was plowing with it and all ox code laying there that was the only thing that he could put in his hand doesn't seem like much does it some days it doesn't seem like much because we've read it for years without inspiration that's it we've read it for years that's right that's a ritual amen and it was just sitting there in the corner lord help me lord help us but you know what i don't say he got angered but his righteous indignation got up and he said yes sir brother i will tell you he what's in your hand what's in your hand and i want to ask you today what's in your hand amen nothing but an ox code and he said i'm not a fighter i can't do this anybody said that when was the last time you said that well praise the lord for me it was about 6 am i got up my eyes were so blurred up this morning i sat there and i looked at the ipad and i tried to read my bible and all this stuff and i was like lord i can't do this i'm so tired my bones hurt lord forgive me lord but i'm so tired i don't know brother david would have probably been up at 6 a.m i could have called him brother chris probably would have been up 6 a.m could have called him and the lord says well what do you got in your hand he did well i've got a message in my hand i've got something on my heart amen hallelujah so you look at this now he said oh i'm not a fighter i haven't got any training but he hadn't time to do any training the only thing he needed was the spirit of god on him [Music] come on i'm talking to believers i'm talking to christians but let's not let this world and cares of this world get us to a place we're questioning what can i do amen get the spirit of the lord amen get the spirit of the lord on you this morning saints i'll just bear my heart to you this morning i'm sitting there and the lord spoke to me i was reading lord spoke to me i'm sending their tears just dripping off my face i'm like lord this is the truth we can stand look saints i'll put it to you this way you know i like to just be open i can come but 17 18 years of preaching hundreds and hundreds uh in the thousands of sermons i can come and preach you a sermon i can come and i can put scriptures together i can put quotes together i can do all of this and i can get up here and i can preach you a sermon but i don't want to preach you a sermon i want to preach christ and him crucify to you i want to preach the truth do you want to preach life to you yes will it be in the form of a sermon yes it will be in the form of a sermon but it can either be full of the spirit of god or it can be empty and just be words what we need is the spirit of god on amen what did he do he jumped out that window with the spirit of god on him he took that ox goat and killed 600 philistines amen that sounds pretty bloody doesn't it but i'll tell you what i'd like to do to the devil hallelujah he'd be drawn and quartered he'd know that he's defeated before we ever get to the day of judgment you see but we can't do that just by saying oh devil get out of my life leave my family alone look don't know he's got to know who you are in other words let me put it this way to you as we'll get ready to close the devil has to see you as an adversary if you have a treaty with the devil you are not his adversary oh you say brother paul what's a treaty well that's where i was when my kids were little and the god in my life as my wife used to say your girlfriend was a dirt bike because my wife preached to me when i was in the house oh she never said word huh i really love to ride my dirt bike because you see saints i had signed a treaty with the devil and i said if you leave me alone i'll leave you alone but one day the holy ghost come and i had the treaty laying on the shelf right there and that silly treaty caught fire and burnt up had no more treaty with the devil and from then on i looked at the devil and i said you know what you know there's a lot of things in my life i blame you for but in reality it was my own fault because i was the one who signed the treaty no one made me sign the treaty with the devil so here satan declaration of war amen and i picked up my bible and the lord took me to a scripture and said i would vanquish amen my enemy amen and he would become dust amen under my feet amen amen hallelujah how do i do that how do you do that with the spirit of god on you that's the only way you're ever going to do it is with the spirit of god on you hallelujah amen now look you know me i kind of baited you there i said we're almost done we're almost done with that quote god has to judge the world by something and if he judges it by the church which one of it is he going to judge by why there's no such a thing as could be judged and there's only one thing that's left his word it's eternal it can't be added to or taken away and i've anchored my soul there with the simplicity of laying my hands upon my sacrifice does it get any simpler than that laying our hands upon the sacrifice amen confessing that i'm no good at all there's nothing in me o lord god send that messiah upon me and change my being to what i was and make me in your own fashion the way you'd have me be no matter how much you could burn a body how much you could destroy a person how much you can talk against them or whatever he says someday he'll raise us up again and there is a kingdom that we receive that cannot be moved oh my hallelujah amen and remember of all this glorious thing that we're now enjoying sitting in heavenly places is just a prelude hallelujah it's a prelude to what is coming that's just the introductory of the symphony that's coming now my brother and sister i can only speak for my own experience and i don't mean to focus it on me but i have been there i have witnessed it and this man right here you know him all too well this man right here has nothing special about him but when we get in the right place in the spirit of god is upon us and we are standing to bring glory and magnify jesus christ we can lay hands and they'll recover we can lay hands and broken bones are healed cross eyes or changes spirits are cast out and we didn't do this to boast we do this to give glory to god hallelujah i have seen it in africa i've seen it seen a little girl oh hallelujah i've told you about her before a devil on her so much that she's scar her own flesh and these things and to see her i just watched and listened to her singing the other night and there she is a happy married young woman singing praises to the lord oh the devil thought he had her already he'd already put his brand on her forearm but god come and says sorry devil you rustler you you cannot come and take what is mine hallelujah what is that because we made a decision to get on the spirit of god upon us to get in the spirit of the lord not to just be carnal go to church kind of christian but to be sincere and on fire hallelujah excuse me for getting excited oh hallelujah talk about this shouting and praising and glorifying magnifying the lamb one day when the angels stand around the earth the curvature of the earth with bowed heads and hear that little blood wash group oh hallelujah you know who she is don't you you've met her you've looked in the mirror oh hallelujah hear that little blood wash group sing them redemptive songs of the blood of jesus christ oh god i want to be joined with them i lift my hands here today and say lord lord i want to be joined with them i want to be there that day on the curvature of the earth hallelujah singing those songs oh hallelujah let me take my place with her now let me take my assurance jesus is mine amen i'll take him and his word amen yes hallelujah sister emmy will you come look saints i don't care what the devil has spoke to you and whatever problems are going on in your life whatever troubles been in the past and whatever you're facing right now just stop call on the lord call on the lord take the word that maybe not has had value to us like it should take the word get it in your hand get it in your hand amen you go out and you'll slay every philistine in your life hallelujah you know we have no history historical way to know what kind of a man that chamgar was physically but let me just be presumptuous [Music] i don't think he was a great big strong man don't think he was a man that could rely on anything of himself physically [Music] and i've actually seen ox goats down in chile they still run aucks and up and down the roads huh you're driving along 100 kilometers an hour and wonder what all the tail lights are and there's somebody inside the highway hurting his ox along his cart i've seen a real live ox code as it would be from chile i don't want to reason this i just want to make the point the finest of the finest of the philistine army which would be very comparable to the finest of satan's army and a little ready guy with an ox code that you can bust over the back of that pew if you strike it wrong [Music] step out there and look at them six foot four little reminder i think maybe the lord let me see this gentleman the other day just as a reminder these things make it real to me run into a gentleman the other day while i don't literally run into wow wow wow [Music] it's the kind of guys you want for a friend [Music] i'm going to attack him with an ox go armor no armor saints i'm not attacking that guy with an ox code unless the spirit of the lord's on me that you realize as much as god anointed shamgar to jump out that window now saints i want you to understand how god works in our lives mom dad it isn't always like i i'm gonna i'm gonna do this for the lord today no sometimes it's i'm doing this for my wife for my children i'm doing this for my husband my children are we're see we're we're thinking in a different

cleansing but it's a continual cleansing in his presence burning out every little smudge right the scripture says that we would not even want a smudge on the hem of our garment i stand today i lift my hands and say lord lord just clean me from head to toe clean me father that i not even have a smudge lord not one thing that would be presentable to the world in in defense of satan in defense of his program defense of his his spirit but we would be just completely completely completely surrendered to the holy spirit oh hallelujah hallelujah now i want you to think on this it'll be something i i'll i'll preach i think i kind of forgot uh to put this note but yet it was in my paper notes the prophet of god preached he preached on the power of the devil it seems like a strange thing right

a nutshell well i would put it in this fashion right here die today die today in jesus christ that there's no death that the devil can bring that can hurt you touch you influence you be my prayer i'd say this day lord help us lord to die help us lord to die to ourself to our flesh to our reasoning to our thinking to the devil's whispers of what you have been imagine the whispers of what has been

of the family of god you don't think the devil ever whispered in their ear [Music] but they knew that they knew that they knew the prophet of god goes right on very next service and preaches on the power of god [Music] it shows us there's no greater power on the face of this this power is immeasurable unlimited and that's good power of the devil we recognize it power of god we recognize it the very next sermon he preaches the power of decision and you know one of the most powerful decisions you'll ever make [Music] is the decision to leave the past and press to the mark of the high calling and when we make that decision and it's been stamped as irrevocable it's a life-changing decision [Music] well that's wonderful i did that a lot of years ago brother paul been a christian for a long time no actually you have to get up every day and make that decision all over again amen but i made it irrevocable no get up in the morning lord i'm going to serve you today lord i'm going to be found
