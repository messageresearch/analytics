this day is to go forward amen not to stop not turn around not wait for something else he says that the word has already been revealed and we need to move forward in the word amen in that beautiful hallelujah just love that thinking about that amen hallelujah well i just want to speak to you once again on the preparations of the inner man amen we know that the outer man will conform to what the inner man believes right the scripture says from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks amen the word also tells us that we speak and our flesh obeys amen so our flesh actually is in a very unique position because it is subject to the moving of the spirit and the scripture tells us that the tongue amen is hard to tame and part of that taming my brother and sister isn't vile words it's negative words we have to tame this tongue from our negative speech amen hallelujah well i'd just like to speak to you tonight on complete surrender complete trust amen you see to come to the place that you can have complete trust i'm talking about complete trust not just trust complete trust you have to have a complete surrender because if there's one bit of doubt one bit of fear and we're talking about a a mustard seed a grain of a mustard seed kind of faith now my brother and sister let's let's we'll this sunday we'll go into some some comparisons but if it takes a mustard seed grain of faith to deliver you and i through the word then how little bit of fear it must be that hinders that it's not a whole boatload of fear it only takes a little fear and we're not talking about fear such as we're standing in the jungle and there's a giant lion i'm not even dealing with that kind of fear even though it is relevant i'm talking about that deep underlying question mark that satan would try to put into your life that you would come to a place that you would say well is this right or not you know that's what happens every time you get around a negative spirit it leaves behind its own seeds and they try and sprout hallelujah we need a little spiritual roundup amen hallelujah let's stand and let's read out of luke the fifth chapter verses one through six uh i just prayed tonight that you would just be encouraged a little bit as i was reading my bible uh actually oh i don't know i i have my notes was in my phone but it's been quite a few days uh in the past maybe a week or more that i come across this scripture and uh it struck me so much and i thought lord i just i want to just share this i want it to be an encouragement uh that we could just come to a place that we could latch on to this amen so let's just look at this luke 5 and 1 and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of genocide and saw two ships standing on the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets and he entered into one of the ships which was simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drought now my brother and sister that's not just a couple fish for the market amen hallelujah now i think all of us would just settle for just a little blessing from god but do you realize he gave to us every redemptive blessing in this book amen do we realize my brother and sister that's a drought that's not just a little portion that god might bless me here and might bless me there and it might be months or weeks or even days before he blesses me again but that's drawing up such a blessing of almighty god that would sustain you and i through every challenge that we face people say well i've got friends that come to this where they said well i've just served and i thought the lord was coming and i thought this was happening and i thought this and i'm just i'm just weary and i'm tired and they quit but god has given us the blessing of substance to keep us every day not just not just you know we look and somebody mentioned the other day well well you know it's been all these years since a prophet left the scene my brother and sister the prophet is not our calendar this is our calendar amen god won't be one moment too early he won't be one moment too late he's an on-time god amen so you know i understand where people are coming from and so don't think that i'm speaking critically of them but brother branham is not our calendar amen hallelujah where was i when he left speaking he said unto simon launch out to the deep and let down your nets for a drought and simon answered answering said unto him master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing i think there's quite a bit more in those few words right there saints i think somehow for time it got abbreviated we have toiled all night and have taken nothing oh this is the part that made my heart just cry out nevertheless in spite of every excuse everything nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net and when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break heavenly father we just ask you this evening come and speak to us lord father we just feel so inadequate to express the things lord our heart the joy that has been placed there and lord we thank you and so inadequate to say thank you lord but in the best of our ability we say thank you lord for your word come and speak to us tonight i pray for every need father those out on the road lord just be with them lead them guide them father strengthen each one i pray in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated amazing even though i've read this scripture many times this week it's just never fails to stir me saints just to realize that god knowing our human nature so much better than we even know ourselves and that he could come and according to his desire according to his will do the work in our life a life-changing work amen now as we'll look at this we'll see that the people pressed upon him and we'll touch upon this in a few quotes here in just a few minutes that the people pressed upon him my brother's sister that was no casual time in fact the prophet of god says he would have liked to have been in that service amen no casual time as a people pressing why not to just look at him not just to hear the words of his speech but to hear the scripture says the word of god there was a hunger and a thirst in them to hear the word of god and isn't this beautiful because they were hearing the word from the word himself amen and so not a half-hearted approach to coming but a full desire so much so that our lord jesus needs a little space you know we all need a little space and so there he is is he sees the ships and in another place in my studies you know brother branham says that he believed that jesus knew that it was simon he knew who was there he knew whose ship it was and of course we see him call out his name and so you see the fishermen are gone out of the ships and and they've had a night of soaking their nets not catching anything but you see that they're not slothful men and so actually in the cause if you look at this of washing the nets it is not just simply because they're washing them in the very same water that uh they were fishing in so you say well what would washing it do but actually for a fisherman the cause of washing the nets is to remove all of the debris any moss any sticks or anything like that and as they do that they are going through their nets making sure there is no tears they're making sure there is nothing that will fail them at another time afraid deal we've had this a privilege in south america to uh you know being a nation as they are uh with a very close connection to the ocean we've had the privilege of watching watching uh uh many a man going through his nets and working together to spread them out and uh you know patching them up sewing them back together and so you look at this while they were uh totally uh um we use that term in natural life skunk they had no fish to show for it they were still diligent and knew that someday or some time that they would be a need for their nets to be in perfect condition and jesus he gets into the ship and and it was simon ship and he asked him hey look would you just put me out there just a little bit now there are several references where brother branham talks about simon and them looking and saying oh oh there's that healer there's that one they're talking about let's listen to what he's got to say and so we realized that even for simon peter and and the others there was a more of a connection than you might look at on the surface you see they themselves had a hunger they themselves had a thirst for something they needed a touch from the master amen and so he he sets down in the ship and he teaches the people out of the ship and you talk about uh you know how we get so habitual about the way traditional about the way church must be but what if jesus come and said you know what i want you to go over here on the shores and i'm going to set in a boat and you're going to sit on the seashore and we're going to have church would that be too unusual for us i i would pray that it wouldn't be that our traditions and ideas of church and worship wouldn't hold us amen but he sat down and he taught the people amen once again i just have to say this kind of taking from what the prophet of god said that would have been one service that would have been awesome to have been in amen and so when he was done speaking when he was left speaking he says unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draw now as we were singing this song here i had to open my notes and and type in the word royal amen because it was there as part of the lyrics of the chorus of the song but he simon answered and said unto him yeah good man good minister good friend good neighbor he was actually from an anointing speaking something maybe much deeper than he even realized it might have has been a sign of his respect for him but little did he know that truly he was speaking to the royal master amen amen the word master in a condensed definition is one of authority or dominance and he says unto him master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing colon space of time i wonder have you ever caught yourself stepping into the excuse mode here's simon oh i believe this was an anointing of god he's fixing to tell him all the reasons why not and something catches him and he then has to stop and there's the pause as you might say from from the punctuation i want to emphasize that he starts to go into the reason why god cannot answer this prayer why this cannot happen why this must not take place he started to step into that mode just like you and i but he caught himself and i pray god catch us lord anoint us to catch ourselves to not step into the mode of the reason why not but to step up and as he was speaking there i believe something caught a holst of him because this word had to come to pass amen something caught him and and he's there nevertheless look at that saints he he's got the rebuttal of what this is and then he stops and says but nevertheless at thy word not what this man thinks or that man thinks or what my little hummingbird fish finder says all of that went away that didn't matter i believe if we'd had modern technology we could have put a boat in the water with a fish finder and we could have drove back and forth there and said simon you're right there's no fish here now if we'd have that technology or they'd have that technology they said look jesus they won't do any good it will do no good to drop our nets in this water because we have just proven but you see that's what he was saying we fished all night we've already went over these waters we've been back and forth we've prayed for this and we prayed for that and we asked for this and we claimed that but nothing happened so it must not be going to happen oh but nevertheless lord you ask us amen you ask us to have faith lord give us nevertheless what my emotion says nevertheless what the neighbor says or the man down the road says or someone halfway across the country says i don't care what they got to say what did god say about it amen and when god says go forward with courage go forward with courage if you don't feel courage stop and say lord let me be just like simon nevertheless lord i'll go forward with courage amen hallelujah i got excited saints when this struck my heart amen i was like yes lord how many times has paul went into the excuse mode lord i can't i can't lord i'm not called to this i'm not capable of this oh lord what about this why not someone else had a brother one time that's been back a few years but he he come through here if i spoke his name you'd all say oh we love him so we'll leave him out conversation and he asked me a question he says brother paul why don't you have more confidence well brother let me start he goes that isn't what i ask you i didn't ask you for your excuses i ask you why you don't and to me the excuse of why i didn't and why i didn't were so directly connected i felt like i had to give the excuse to show the reason why not are you with me amen come on saints i think we all can say amen to this our position and our excuse are so intertwined that we believe somehow they must go together and then the brother said brother paul he said i'm not saying this to lift me up but it's just something that's part of he goes brother paul he said i've listened to your preaching why would you doubt it well let me give you no you see how it comes i'm using this i'm throwing myself under the bus tonight because we have become so intertwined with our reasons when god didn't ask for our reasons he asked us to trust and obey oh my i love this nevertheless i got these reasons but that must have been a good anointing nevertheless thy word now if you were a pessimist you would say well what he just did is he just passed whether this works or not back to jesus did you catch that and some of you thought that's bad but did you know it's actually good because when we stand here and we would say well i i'm a christian i have to do this and then when you fail satan comes right in and says see you're not really a christian or else that wouldn't have failed but you see my brother and sister what god's teaching us is that his word cannot fail his word will not fail and as long as we are trying to catch the fish god wants us to just say nevertheless satan nevertheless satan now i'm going to cast my net into the well of god's word and whatever the lord wants me to catch whatever revelation whatever thoughts whatever anointing that god wants me to have when i draw my neck forward it will have exactly in my neck what god wants it to be amen so you don't have to now come see this is why predestination is much deeper topic than we ever give it credit for because we don't have to make this happen we have to trust the one who already made it happen and when we can surrender to him completely and just say lord i'm done i can't do this no longer but i am going to surrender i'm not surrendering to laodicea see a lot of difference in our surrendering we surrender to laodicea we'll end up looking like laodicea living like louisiana and be judged by laodicea but when we come to the place that we say lord i surrender to you your will be done lord and then you come and faith and trust start to rise up and we get up in the morning and say you know what lord the wheels might fall off the wagon but it won't matter lord you ordained this day and i'm walking in you hallelujah oh because my brother and sister the word of god shows us quite clearly we cannot walk in the flesh and be in the spirit at the same time we're going to make a decision or who we're listening to hallelujah now look i love this in this uh several quotes here tonight and i better rev it up and go because uh i keep shrinking the plate just like i told brother alex i keep springing the plate but the poor paper i gave to him for the service tonight was clear full amen the patriarch abraham and when god now he's talking about abraham but look where he's i'm i'm cherry-picking this you know i had somebody criticize me well you just go and pull a quote out somewhere well my brother and sister if we go on all night all week all whatever i'll read the whole sermon to you to let the one point that i'm trying to make hallelujah we're not here trying to cherry-pick something i hope you know my heart we're not cherry-picking we're not trying to say well the only quote in the whole sermon that says what i want is this one so we'll no it's just we don't really have enough time amen tie all this together lord when god who when god expects who to do a special thing hallelujah lord sign me up special mission behind enemy lines which means right in my community writing my job right whatever right because we're in satan's eden that means you're working behind enemy lines hallelujah he demands a complete separation from why doesn't this say sin come on saints that's right you know me we're not here to make an excuse for our mistakes but do you realize that god through the blood will overlook your mistakes when you repent of them but if you can't get over doubt there's nothing he can do for you he demands a complete separation from any doubt you've got to come to full obedience to obey what he says god kind of ask you pretty please right would you please no the prophet of god said he demands it a demand is very strong it has force and many cases consequence behind it you can't do it no other way and now he always sets an example and that was his example of a complete separation from all of his family talking about abraham now all his kindreds and so forth to walk a life separated to god amen so would god ask any more or less you see if god didn't ask us to walk alive separated to him he'd have to go back and apologize to abraham amen because he asked more of abraham than he asked of us so that means we get a pass doesn't work that way see so we got to have this separated life but look at this my brother and sister it's coming now here when god expects you to do a special thing now look this is just paul's opinion i want to just lay it out that way so nobody goes scrambling looking through the message trying to figure out where i got this idea it just popped in my head but i was called to do a very special thing it started out with a simple request i want you to walk through laodicea amen and i want you to go stomp on every spirit and i want you to just be so perfect that nobody can ever find fall with you no he asked us to walk through laodicea and he said i'll be with you i will lead you and i will guide you you know sometimes the guide doesn't always walk right with you sometimes the guides up on top of the peak or pinnacle saying you're on the right trail keep coming like he's on the other end of the valley of the shadow and you're on this end and he just keep coming you're on the right path lead you guide you said i would never forsake you that would be like the guide happened in colorado quite a few years ago where the man i think the customers were just too much for him and he abandoned him in the woods didn't do his guide service any good his license away he was done as a guy but basically he started talking you know told them what kind of people they were and they said well you know what uh you should have took a different route so god's not going to take us out in the wilderness and abandon said i'll lead you i'll guide you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you wow this is some kind of guide i'll even you guys ever see brother donnie's wolf and sheep deal yeah you know he's talking about how that the wolf in sheep's clothing brother donny you know he's he's almost almost actor quality on some of this i won't do it justice but he's talking about how they're there and the old wolf he gets a hold of that thing he drags it in there and he's like i don't do it justice but the wolf and the sheep's clothing that's not our lord jesus right his spirit is you know what i'm gonna come i'm gonna do a little unzipping i'm gonna do a little unzipping on you but what it is is because i'm climbing inside of you it's no wolf coming into sheep's clothing it's god himself as the prophet of god said god himself in you hallelujah i'm just if i if you don't mind tonight he just comes and he just kind of unzips that right there and says you know what young person you may be just a little girl a little boy but i want to be inside of you i want to just unzip that in the right time in the right season you just open up your heart and your soul to me and i'll just step right inside of you and i'll zip that up so tight but i'm going to seal that zipper nothing else can get in there i've got that spot hallelujah amen you see how beautiful it is my brother and sister and that god is going to come and use you and i for a special thing going on in that special thing walk through laodicea we're going to walk right through laodicea i don't need to go through every little detail even though they're rumbling through my mind my brother and sister one of those special things he called you to is not necessarily just the struggle against the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and all of this garbage here he's called us to a rapture all of this is just what we have to face as he's called us and put us in a rapture and then we look at the book of revelation it so clearly shows that he has called you you're the people of the book amen you're those of the book amen and he's called you to that position and all of this is just the fluff and the struggle that goes with it but the real calling is when you look and you see your name in the book and you can say praise the lord before there was a world he called me and put me here oh i'll tell you what that's where you never get weary in the journey i'm talking about never fall down never give up it's because there's a revelation that's been placed down in your soul that i am in that book amen in fact the lamb's book is a book about me hallelujah some people think that's kind of conceited but my brother and sister it's the truth this is the revelation of jesus christ amen the seventh seal was a revelation of the plan of redemption and so god said what i'm gonna do it's not gonna be for everyone not everybody can understand this not everybody can see this they can read the words they can hear the word but they won't spark to life because this is the revelation i'm giving to you so that you will know in the darkest of times in the valley of the shadow that you are a son or daughter of god and that holds you up and you have strength and you say well thank the lord thank the lord i i just know it is and what do you do you press forward hallelujah no going back no laying down on the job amen my hired man today it was kind of funny we're working on a piece of equipment i'm trying to hold this piece in place and there was a deal on the work on a step bench outside that we had next to this chopper and i'm trying to hold this in place and i'm trying to reach this deal and i'm stretching as far as i can i can't reach it and so the hired man he comes up he goes hey paul he said you remind me of my grandson and i said really and he goes yeah he said i was just at my daughter's house this weekend and she said whatever his little nickname was go take out the trash and the little boy laid down on the floor he said he said i said i saw this he said mama said you take the trash and the little boy laid down on the floor and said mama i can't reach it come on saints the promise of god is not out there the promise of god is where right here amen don't be laying down i can't reach it i can't reach it amen i will be with you even in you hallelujah amen i laughed till i cried hallelujah i thought man that boy is smart i never thought of that when i was a kid of course if i laid down on the floor when i was a kid my dad would have come right up there with a leather belt and just help me reach it amen now in the sermon at thy word now my brother and sister i thought this is so interesting that we find this connection right here uh brother brown's preaching on this topic but just the title at thy word amen but it's always a happy delight to be among god's children and i say amen to that and i believe that right in this city and right in this audience tonight there's god's elected children are sitting here and i have the privilege of being with them you know that makes me feel awfully good to know that i've just sat with sons and daughters of god i say amen to that and now to the text for just a few moments i won't keep you just a little bit the scripture reading is about jesus they said they pressed upon him to hear the word of god my that shows they was hungry doesn't it you can't interest people for food until they get hungry but when they get hungry then they can really talk about food hallelujah and that's the way it is if they don't if you're not interested in god you can't talk god to people but whenever they get to hungering and thirsting after righteousness god said they shall be filled now my brother and sister do you realize the word shall there removes all negative connotation there is no room for potential failure but first there has to be a hunger and thirst you have to really want it now saints i put myself on the pew right now so no one will think i'm being harsh but as a minister you can often see the hunger level of those you are speaking to it is though there is a neon sign this might scare some of you i hope you don't i keep coming to church please keep coming to church but i'm telling you the truth there's a sign sometimes i believe honestly if god wanted it done we could just speak what you were thinking about we could speak of your situation it's that real let our hunger sign come on let our hunger sign be the only thing the preacher can ever discern we have the ability saints i'm not speaking down here not speaking negative we have the ability to just stop and say lord i lay aside every issue of today amen i'm coming to church because i'm hungry and i want to be fit to get all emotional about it oh you know i really didn't get nothing out of church because before church i was praying lord you know give me something in church today and i i didn't get i didn't get excited so i just i just sat through church because this must not be my service tonight put all that aside put all that aside stop at the door back there and say lord please erase erase this broken thing erase this erase that erase this erase that from my thinking lord because i'm coming here we've all done that get invited to someone's house come to our house at seven you're used to eating at five you ate five cheese sticks four of them nice tasty cookie things that are in the package and a few other things and then you go and you sit down a sister nadia's table and you pick at the food you know what you told sister nadia with a neon sign i'm just talking natural right there you see my excuse was is if they hadn't invited us so late i would have been hungry when i got there as my sister in christ sister nadia i love you why just a few days ago i was telling her that i was going to buy her a stepladder so she could climb into a pickup you know you got to love your friends when they will put up with you you just have to you just have to but you see erase that it was sister jerry's table no but look saints see what what do you tell somebody what do you tell a sister when they've invited you and they've cooked the meal and they put hours into this and they've made the dessert and just pick at it a little bit what do we tell god when we come to the house of god but when they get hungry they can really talk about the word that's the way it is if they don't if you're not interested in god you can't talk god to the to people but whenever they get to hungering and thirsting after righteousness god said they shall be filled but first there has to be a hunger and thirst you have to really want it uh pardon me my gaff on on i'm trying to break that habit of of picking on people close to me amen but you got to love how the lord sets this stage right now i i didn't realize i wrote this in my notes right here i don't have the quote or whatever but brother brown says that he's sure that jesus knew what men or them men were there hungry people called out people they don't even know they're called out in that congregation they're pressing they're pressing they're pressing they're pressing because they want to hear the word now the prophet of god i don't remember i'm just a little brain dead right at the moment forgive me but you know my brother and sister i think it's right here in one of these quotes but the prophet of god is talking about they didn't come to see him they didn't even come to hear his theology yeah well you know what hungry people called out people i don't think it's too strange the fact that god comes to those who are hungry and thirsty amen i think it's just a simple simple uh understanding of of how god's word is uh this soul cry of these greeks the greeks seek wisdom and jews seek signs and paul said we preach christ crucified and the greeks has always wanted wisdom but these greeks come up and perhaps were proselytes the jewish religion came up to jerusalem to worship at the pentecostal feast and then while they were up there they had heard of the great fame of this one jesus of nazareth his fame had scattered everywhere many disbelieved him thousands disbelieved him i want you to think about this we live in a day that almost every single day some form of news comes about someone you're acquainted with has walked away and people say well i i i got to listening to my cousin and my cousin said and then i got discouraged so i just quit and then i went down this is a true story saints i'm not making this up and then i went down you know and and got my hair cut and permed and got my nails done because it doesn't matter anymore okay no problem i won't even make light of that they're being honest they're being honest there's something incredible about honesty many disbelieved him thousands disbelieved him and we knew some of them but thousands believed him and it was mostly among the common people who heard him and believed him those who were of the other type they did not have him because they were satisfied with their religion now i'm telling you if you are hungry and you sit down at a table i'll tell you and i'm not trying to throw any by the bus but i'm just going to speak straight these are the inspirations that come my wife the other night she made spaghetti and i come in kind of late really late and she said well here i still have supper for you she goes um there's a few regular noodles left and there's zucchini noodles which do you want of course i said zucchini noodles because i love zucchini in your car but you see she was just trying to feed me what was best for me and so when i sit down at the table i look and there's a little dab of real noodles and a lot of zucchini noodles and i was hungry and i ate it so fast i didn't realize there was a difference between the noodles and the zucchini if i had not been hungry it might have been a different story look we've had it right here in this church where people want to complain sundays you preach too long we want every service to be 45 minutes we've heard enough word just remind us i had quote after quote but i didn't want to be negative and i'm not being negative now but saints i'm telling you i'm a big eater i'm a big eater hallelujah i used to be naturally a big eater but i'm a big eater you preached me for 45 minutes it better be in a zip file that keeps opening up long after i've went home i'm not interested in just some little thing some little blip or some little whatever i'm sorry saints it's too close to the end of the race to settle for just a little nibble amen hallelujah i remember one time i just have to tell you the story we were eating at some folks home house and there they were a little more well off than they were by about five thousand times more but anyway uh we're there and and they're gonna serve us you know they said oh we're gonna have some steak and we're gonna have some things and a little shrimp and i'm like this is good so they come out and served like one shrimp on every one of our plates and then my steak i thought this has got to be just a scrap that they trimmed off of this thing where's the real steak coming but it wasn't and then we had salad which i thought was in reverse because you always feed salad to your guests so they won't eat as much as everything else and a little dinky salad and then they had some cheesecake and i looked at that and i went and it was gone now i'm not saying that brother wasn't a man but that wasn't a man's meal a real man eats a real amount of food hallelujah we don't look at it the beauty of it is nice sister jerry won't even remember this occasion but later she said that was such beautiful food i wanted to take a picture but it might offend them so i didn't well i wish you would have so i could have held it up and said see this was called a meal and saints getting up and reading a quote and telling you all gonna make a rapture singing a few songs and leaving is not a meal it's not a meal mature christians have moved from the milk to the meat and not where the little dish is it said where the carcass and i'm sorry to tell you it was one whole carcass for me you claim whatever you need for you right it's right there in your grass you can train a little trimming or you can go for a carcass i want a carcass hallelujah amen but thousands believed him and it was mostly among common people blah blah blah let me catch where i'm at amen they did not have much time for him because they were satisfied with their religion and they had now i want to make emphasis this because coming on this sunday we're going to dive into something uh that's going to be a kind of direct and and whatnot and have the religion tied right in the middle of it that father's been taught certain things and there and they had their traditions handed down now look saints i wanna i might not make it through tonight that's fine if you find yourself moving into a tradition in grace tabernacle shake yourself shake yourself we're not here for whatever reason god chosen and sometimes it's just beyond my comprehension i'm a pastor of a church but you see this man right here is not here to impose tradition we must do this this is the only way we do it what we need to everyone be lifting our hearts our spirit will be crying out holy spirit lead us lord lead us i want you to lead me and guide me to all truth lord don't no church don't let no ideology don't let nothing hinder me because my brother and sister tradition is taking a foothold in our belief amen you can't be led oh yes i'm kind of putting a couple quotes together but i believe they have a continuity you can't be led of the spirit and be bound to tradition it's an impossibility won't happen will not happen amen their traditions handed down something new no matter how phenomenal it was well he tried to tell him it was in scriptures that he was to come oh well well they if he was to be the person the priest would know something about it therefore they wasn't interested see that's what's happening in the world my brother and sister amen i had someone here recently asked me why we needed to take everything back to the word flabbergasts you you don't even know how to answer a question like that statement question however it is don't even know how to answer that when the prophet go home tonight if you have time tomorrow whatever type it into go online if you don't have the the program in your own computer go online and write to voice of god use theirs type in there about how many times brother brown says take it back to the bible take it back to the word the words are absolute the bibles are absolute look how many times he says that and then someone who's a believer of the message comes and says why do we need to take it back to the word brother branham's vindicated it ain't got nothing to do with brother branham i need to be eating the word amen so when i take it back to the word saints i go back to the word hope you can see the symbolic side of this when i go back to the word i come back to the word if i'm looking to prove something i've got the wrong spirit the wrong attitude but if i go back to the word and i start reading the word let's just read the word on baptism oh i start reading the word oh okay okay okay oh let's talk about what it is there was a there was a certain ministry went some time back started kind of preaching for a while until it got they kind of got squished on it but they were preaching that we were once angels well i went back to my bible and i just simply couldn't find where i was once an angel that's why we go back to our bible it ain't got nothing to do with whether brethren being a prophet or not this is me reading the word feeding on the word and then the word comes and everything i need at the moment is in that word and then it comes and strengthens me amen hallelujah go ahead eat the pedal off the bicycle if you need to amen hallelujah hopefully i'm not being too pushy tonight are we okay saints amen i just think there comes a time we have to just kind of be a little direct about some of these things because if we don't well after a while we don't stand for something we'll fall for anything and everything amen but these greeks when they heard faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of god they come seeking jesus and i believe has been the heart's cry of every man and every woman who's ever heard anything about jesus christ has had that same thing sir we would see jesus they didn't want to learn his theology amen think about it saints a lot of theology preached we're not here for theology i'm here for a life-changing event i'm here for the power of the word to come into my life to come into your life to shed everything that could possibly hinder us amen oh i tell you what nobody likes the sound of a weed eater in church but we need that we need these things cut away we need it pruned we need to cut back amen sir we'd see jesus they didn't want to learn his theology they didn't care nothing about his teachings they didn't care about whether he what kind of clothes he wore they were only interested in one thing that they wanted to see jesus that's the main thing and that's the cry of today see lest we would interpret what brother branham's saying there incorrectly he's encouraging you not to worry about theology he's encouraging you not to look at teaching think about this why would he do that because he's already made the promise to lead you and guide you into all truth amen so i don't know if we'll get to it or not but a few quotes about when you're walking in the things of the lord you don't know no danger you don't know no fear amen god's already made the promise to you to lead you to guide you amen that's why we don't walk as timid christians amen hallelujah so in the message faith and it's actually retitled kind of african trip report brother brown talks about that trip a lot in the in the sermon this is a word i will leave with you look at those fishermen we're back to our original topic just a moment look at them toiled all night through the lake they were fishermen they knowed the change of the moon they know the time of the waters they had seemed seined all night commercial fishermen and taken nothing what a discouraging time gone out and washing their nets sitting down on the bank let's drama just a minute i love this see this is my justification for laying on the floor let's drama just a minute look coming under i see a young man in his thirties coming walking down the bank i'm i imagine he looked a lot older because he said his ministry was so strenuous on him come walking down the bank two or three men walking with him and i can look away back up on the hill along there at the fishermen scenes along that they say there is that prophet of galilee let's go down and see what he will say they gathered up to the bank and i look lay setting on a log up there and there's simon and them washing their nets discouraged they pressed upon him to hear the word of god and he said can i use your moment just your boat just a moment he jumped got in the boat and they pushed out a little bit then after he got through speaking he said come here simon you all look at these words saints come here simon and you all god never borrows nothing from you unless he pays you for it think about it if god asks something of you let's not get carnal run off with this but if god asks something of you he has something he's going to give to you god never never never leave you lacking for the presence from the presence of the holy ghost in your life never leave you lacking unless you think not going to bars and singing karaoke is a loss if you think dancing is a loss then you're going to think god took something from you but once delivered from that my brother and sister once delivered to that a true holy ghost deliverance you will look at that and thank god that it's left never consider it as loss amen i love this this strikes my heart right here god will never take anything never borrow any nothing from you unless he pays you for is that right he said come here now thrust out in the deep and let down to take the whole drought of fish simon said now lord we've seen through these waters all night we haven't taken a fish we caught nothing we know we know we're fishermen we know this sea we were raised here see here is why i made the statements i did earlier about how you come to a point and you speak up negative this is why i can't this is why i can't find joy in my life this is why i can't find deliverance this is why i can't do this that's why i can't step out in faith this is what because i was raised in a family that had no faith it's a reason i can have faith i was raised in a family it was this way that's why i got a temper that's why i got a buzz saw i'm irish and my daddy and my grandpa and my great grandpa and it just goes right on back we're all just like this okay nevertheless we're fishermen we know this sea we're raised here our fathers was raised here as we take we've taken nothing from it there's just no fish in that water oh my but nevertheless that thy word i will let down the net there you are and when he let the net down it finally fell down begin to pull and tug when he pulled the fish as you begin to feel them flopping look at these few lines some of you always cheat i just know you do you've outread me it's all right i i hope no one ever takes that serious i'm just where'd they come from how did they get there if there was no fish in the water taking god at his word will bring fish in the water i believe that saints i tell you i could just tonight just bore you to details of things in our life that have looked like they was no way it could change and god come on the scene amen and i'm i'm talking in some carnal things you know business type things and i'm also talking in the natural in healing and it just seems impossible and god comes on the scene amen and tell me you just take god at his word he'll bring the fish i want to ask you tonight what's your fish what is your fish i'm not even going to pretend that i would even look deep enough to know what your fish is but if you need a fish tonight amen you take god at his word he'll put that fish in your neck hallelujah amen now i hope you guys don't mind this is not a quote by brother branham some people get all shook up had a message believer tell me that these people that are quoting spurgeon and tozer and whatnot are backslid so if you all feel that way then i'll stand right here and tell you backslid but i believe what this guy wrote and he wrote this a long long long long time ago happy is a man who possesses a bible happier still is he who reads it happiest of all is he who reads it and obeys it yeah i think that was worthy of quoting amen hallelujah my oh my well do we stop or do we go sister emmy will you come just one quote but there's a lot of narrative goes with this one quote oh well we only live once but there is something about it when you really you are really determined god is revealing himself you're determined to see christ there is no danger before you you don't even pay any attention the doctor says you're going to die you don't even notice it when you are pressing you know there is something there something down in your heart burning faith in this god blank spot on the tape three months this talking about queen of the south she's coming she's got a goal she's going to find something there's something in her heart i like how brother branham brings this something down in her heart burning faith in this god three months to travel over sahara desert not in an air-conditioned cadillac no no she took three months across the sahara desert maybe traveling by night reading the scrolls near oasis in daytime until she arrived now no wonder jesus said she'll stand on the last days and condemn this generation for some of them won't walk across the street wow i mean the word of god says that she'll raise up in that day and judge that's not even a message thing saints that's a bible thing talking to a guy the other day said oh i really love these god things and then contradicted god in this thing and i thought no you can't have a god thing you were lucky enough to find this and that and buy it cheap and you say that's a god thing and then you turn around the word of god and throw it in the ditch no you can't have both you can't have both saints oh no wonder jesus said she'll stand the last days and condemn this generation and a greater than solomon is here the holy spirit himself see no wonder she'll rise in the last days and condemn the generation now watch she finally arrived she didn't come like many people some people come to a strange meeting she come and took her camels and went out in the courtyard and put up her tents she's going to stay there until she was convinced hallelujah didn't get up run away at the first words that shook her up the first thing she didn't like she stayed there until she was convinced another place in the message brother brown said she was going to stay there until she was convinced either it was right or it was wrong hallelujah you know you can't fault anybody for saying i just can't see this right you fold them don't judge them that they can't see it because you should stop pray for them that's right the prophet of god said you should pray for them amen have empathy or sympathy for them pray for them but you ought to be thanking god that your eyes see and your ears here amen because my brother and sister a complete total surrender will bring a complete total trust in our life if you're doubting you're questioning you're you're shook up you're nervous please stop what are you feeding on is it feeding your fears well praise the lord i
