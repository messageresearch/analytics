TRANSCRIPT
========================================
experts that may be used in any other book of literature father but what we're believing tonight is that you will come and inhabit these words father with your thought but and and minister to us and and you can take one thing that's said here and minister to every person in this congregation because you have a supernatural word and you are a supernatural God and we commit ourselves into your hands right now in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you and be seated it seems like a like maybe a strange scripture to to take as a text but uh we have a method to our Madness so to speak uh brother Branham when he preached invisible union he took this as as his text and he said he said now he says he says most people when they look at this scripture they think it's a scripture about marriage and divorce right but he said it's not right he said this is a prophecy of the church in the end time and so and so I chose this scripture because well I mean as a as a minister you always want to use your opening scripture you want this to best reflect the thought that you want to bring you know you want to people because some people drift into their own thoughts and even and even while a minister is speaking you're thinking about something that was just said and then you missed the other thing yeah you know and and and yet we can always go back to this open in scripture and if we catch the thought if we catch the idea of what's being ministered then this scripture will Minister volumes to us and so this this scripture is is very special because brother because uh Paul is is drawing a a comparison between law and Grace okay because he's saying that the law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth now I want you to to notice and this is a very very very important point in this scripture the law doesn't die you died because there was a man that you were bound to that's right that you were married to that the law caused you to be in bondage okay see the law was good because the law although there's ordinances that we could we could look at and we could say you know don't eat an eagle you know I mean things like that we can understand ordinances but really the law was given because because uh Israel wanted something that they could do to match God's thought and so when they turned down a speaking a direct speaking of God at the mountain he said okay we don't want to hear they said we don't want to hear you speak because if we hear you speak listen this is I think this is an important thing that they said if we hear you speak we're going to die but see that's the whole object you know they would have died but they say we don't we don't want that so do you just you just tell us what we need to do and then we'll keep so God gave them a written form of his will and they couldn't keep it right so they became bound to that written form of God's of of God's own mind see but Paul is telling you here that God had something else in mind that he had a he had something that he wanted to give them and we're going to and we're going to get into it here in a minute into the book of Hebrews he had something he wanted to give them he wanted to give them a position back before sin happened because because the law is what caused or the the sin is what caused there to be a law the the sin is what caused there to be a form of God's interaction with people that would make us say okay all you have to do God is tell us what we need to do and we'll do it and yet we couldn't do it because we weren't in that original ought to be conditioned right so so then even the law that was a foreshadowing of the coming of Christ it could not do anything to the heart and so the foreshadowing the law coming and the sacrifices that run the law foreshadowed that something was going to happen now we understand this is very basic but Paul is fixing to tell you something here that is that is profound because he says so in verse 3 so then if while her husband live if she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress okay so so let's what I want to do tonight because we're going to see it in the book of Hebrews here in a minute I want you to see that I I I can only say what I see right I can only tell you what I see I can't I can't say I can't I was telling brother Paul the other day I said I can't say I'm right and somebody else is wrong or somebody else is right or you know all I can do is say what I see and so I've I'm I'm viewing something because of the message that has come in this hour I'm viewing something that happened at Calvary that God confirmed in this hour under this message and that's that there are two realms there's a realm of time that we were trapped under and then there's an eternal Realm okay and and you know eternity in I think in in our human view of things which we're trying to move away from that human view but in our human view of things well eternity was back here and was interrupted by the fall and then at some point it's going to pick back up and start being eternity but eternity is going on right it's going on eternity is is going on right now in fact you studied the word eternity means now that's right it doesn't mean yesterday it doesn't mean tomorrow it means right now and that God himself is standing outside here's time here's the beginning of time here's the end of time and God's standing out here he's standing outside of that and so Paul is telling you right here he said as long as you're married to your first husband which is this Human Condition right you can't be married to an eternal condition right and so what happens when we're born again that's that's the absolute life of the creator that's born in US and we the prophet said we go from being time beings to Eternal beings so how should how should that affect us what kind of effect should that have on us if we step into this eternal perspective it should make us completely different people it should make us completely different we look at things different we see things with the eyes of God Amen amen okay so we're going we're in a study at home we're in a study at home and and have been for several several months on the book of Hebrews okay because I love the book of Hebrews and and and and you know the book of Hebrews is a is a special book because it's like the prophet said about the book of Ephesians or he said the book of Ephesians is not an Evangelical book all right this is for believers that's right this is something that you that you you dive into this book because you you are already have taken on a perspective of something you know you've already been changed he's not dealing with them like he did with the Romans and the Corinthians he's dealing with a people that are here and he needs to take them on to maturity well he's doing the same thing in the book of Hebrews and it's really interesting because the word Hebrew all right Abraham was first called to Hebrew in Genesis 15 I believe or 14 14 or 15. it was right before he met Melchizedek all right it was after Genesis 13 where God had taken I'm getting a mom except but it doesn't matter you got you could God had taken Abraham up on the mountain after he had separated from lot he took him up on the mountain he said now look north south east west look at every direction It All Belongs to You okay so then in the next chapter lot gets gets kidnapped right and then it declares that that Abraham is it says Abraham the Hebrew okay because something had happened to Abraham when he was caught up on that mountain all right now listen God is dealing with the father of our faith all right because we are Abraham's Royal Sea so he is so he did something to Abraham and Abraham in the in the strength of what God had done taking him up on the mountain he looked everywhere and he saw a lot and he said well God said everything I see is mine so he knew lot belonged to him and so it was in the strength of that Revelation that lot that Abraham took a bunch of farmers and went out and defeated these Kings and took lot and brought lot back but he's called a Hebrew and he's not called to Hebrew I don't care what theologians say I don't care what anybody says because I got a bell see I got a bell and when I read something and somebody says oh this is why Abraham was called a Hebrew that didn't strike the Bell so I looked up the word Hebrew and the word Hebrew means one who was crossed over okay and so Abraham was called a Hebrew because he had come out of Babylon and had crossed over the river into the Promised Land and so when when God is dealing with Paul about this book of Hebrews we can say that Paul is dealing with the Jews and he is that's one perspective but this book of Hebrews is written to a group of people who have crossed over and so you're able to understand you're able now Paul said I'm able to take you someplace because you already have this experience and I'm going to the prophet said I'm now I'm going to separate law From Grace because that's what he said the book of Hebrews was separating law From Grace so so let's let's just take let's just say that I'm right and the perspective is law represents time a Time perspective but Grace represents an eternal perspective okay because you know and maybe people are free to believe I just say what I see the difference between grace and mercy is Grace total unmerited favor right we get that Adam had Grace in the garden right because God had created him he said you're my son you know don't eat of that tree and we'll walk together and you'll live forever Adam did not earn that that was perfect total unmerited favor yet when time came now Adam needed Mercy and so when the prophet says for us that whenever the lamb takes the book Mercy is over oh no God we don't want Mercy to be over the reason that that is such a wonderful thing for the bride is that it means that time is over for the bride because she has stepped into her condition as if sin never happened right right and so and so that's what we're looking at in the book of Hebrews and let's go let's just turn over there and we'll read a few scriptures and there's no way that we can obviously cover but if I can give you like a little outline of the first several chapters and we can we can dig into this a little bit and show you that Paul is giving us a perspective this may be different than the way we think okay because I have I have human thoughts up here I have ways it's it's like a it's like I explained it this way all right the other day I said and I'll use Brother David again I say the word cat all right everybody in here has a perspective of what cat means right but me and David already have this deal because I'm not thinking of a Siamese cat or a tabby cat or a white cat or a black cat I'm thinking of a Caterpillar tractor yeah and so in order for you to understand what I'm saying you have to have my thought [Music] s but until you have my thought you're going to interpret what I'm saying by your own perspective by your own experience and so what happens when we're born again is that God gives us his Spirit actually his spirit is born in us from a from a gene of God that was there before the foundation of the world and so what is happening now you're you have the thoughts of God you have the mind of and that's what that's what II Peter that's what Peter is telling us that we're that we're partakers of the divine nature right and this and this life is born in us and it grows into US it grows in us and as we and it's not it's not Stan price putting on patience it's it's me recognizing that my life is Christ's life and I have the patience of Christ whether I see it in the mirror or not but I have a revelation to who I am and I'm going to declare what the word says and so watch this perspective because this is you know I've been preaching out of the book of Hebrews for years and of course we've read it but you know I just felt led this year every it seemed like every New Year's meeting we have a like a lot of churches we'll have a little watch Night Service and and I chose it I said this is going to be the theme for this year the theme for our church this year is perfection amen now Perfection is not moral perfection or Perfection is completion maturity and so and so we chose Perfection and it seemed like that I started getting into the book of Hebrews in a in a verse by verse way in my own personal study and it just bled over and now we've been in the book of Hebrews for months but but I want you to see some let's just read the first three verses here in the book of Hebrews the first chapter of God who at Sunbury times and in diverse manner spake in time pass unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us and it says by here but it's in Sun that's right he has spoken to us in Sun that's right okay now I want you to think because we're gonna we're gonna kind of Jump Ahead a little bit but if we're in Christ we're part of this speaking too we're part of the speaking too so so now because Paul is not talking to new Believers you can't talk about this to to somebody on the street but we're people that have we claim the seals are open we claim to be eating this book of Eternal Redemption and it should be doing something in us that changes the way we look at things so now Paul is now we're we're able to go back to this with a a better perspective and start digging into it and finding out what God wants to say to us so he said he hath in these last days spoken unto us and Son whom he at the pointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and and back to our original scripture that we read Because if we are if if our old man has died and we are married to Christ and we are going to bring forth fruit right and so that's what Paul is to me it's it's tying it together it ties it together with with John the 15th chapter where he says I am the vine you are the branches you bear the fruit and in this bearing of the fruit that's how my father is glorified you want to glorify God you want to magnify God it's not praise God praise God it's bearing his fruits that's how you magnify God and so he says who being the brightness of his glory and express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sin he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high now if you dig into this if you and we're going to look at one scripture just of just to kind of illustrate it but if you dig into this Paul is going to begin to show he's going to talk to you about Christ but he's not necessarily I'm not saying that he doesn't deal with it but he's not necessarily talking to you about the Christ that was crucified because in Romans the seventh chapter he says this the Christ you're married to the Christ that rose from the dead okay so what so what happened here's here's here's my synopsis God in the beginning he makes a creation now why did he make a creation because he was so full of love that he wanted to express himself to a creation right and so what does he do he makes it he makes a universe he makes a planet Isaiah says that that this world was created to be inhabited all right so it didn't just put a planet out there and said what am I going to do with that this whole thing was about man yes the whole thing was about man so God made the mountains he made the he made the planes he made botany life he made he made animals and then he put man on here he put man on the earth and it wasn't just man but it was he stood back and here's the whole thing here's the whole here's his whole creation right there and he stands back and he said this is very good because this fulfills my heart's desire because I want to fellowship and I want to serve God is the servant I want to serve and take care of this loving creation so he would come down and we'll deal with it maybe tomorrow with Melchizedek and theophany and all but he would come down Genesis 3 verse 8 says they heard the voice of God walking in the garden so it's theophany theophany would come down Adam was created in the form of theophany and that theophany was put into a human flesh but God would fellowship with that theophany that was the thing it wasn't the humanity because the prophet said that when Adam sinned he broke fellowship with God and we'll deal with this more tomorrow Lord willing but he broke fellowship with God but he continued to talk with Adam he continued he'd talk with Cain yeah right and so Fellowship is something more than just talking There's an actual blending and so when Adam sinned he fell from that place so now what happened this beautiful plan of God and it was all God's purpose okay I'm not saying it was an accident but this beautiful plan of God that God said this is very good sin dropped over it and now it became about Redemption the whole the whole plan it went from this place of fellowship with the focus of of of this plan of God in time being about how do we get back to this place how do we get back to this original place and so Christ came Christ came God he said I can't let somebody else pay the price because no every person is trapped under this realm of sin there's nobody worthy to do it so I must form myself into a human condition in order to come down and pay the price and so that's what he did he paid the price of redemption and he bowed his head we were preaching the other day at brother riches he bowed his head and said it is finished it's done it's complete yeah yeah so what else do we need to have done because we have even in the message with the opening of the seals and God confirming that this is what happened a restoration back to an original condition and yet we're oh man if I could only get a new body if I could only and I'm going to tell you that that new body has no qualities that make you anything it's not going to make you a better person all it is is a robe that you wear and so we're looking for a new body as if that's the savior and it's not because I'll tell you what watch this and we'll talk maybe deal with it more but Melchizedek who was logos theophany right but he had a human body right because God couldn't deal with Abraham in theophany he had to have a human condition to interact with Abraham because Abraham although he was Abraham he still didn't have access to his theophany because he wasn't born again so God had to put on a flesh to walk with Abraham and to talk with Abraham and to confirm the promises with Abraham and so what he did the prophet's the only one that says he says he picked up elements blue honor said step into that Michael step into that you know and and God stepped into a human body amen all right think about this where'd that body come from came from the earth right those were cursed elements God inhabited a body of cursed elements and brought forth his word amen so when we use our human condition as an excuse waiting for something new to come then we're breaking the word of God because even in who was this Melchizedek brother Branham said this body comes subject to the word yeah right so it's the word of God and so the problem the problem I see sometimes and I've been through it brother I've been through it myself sister I I mean I because you can ask my wife for years man I can't wait to get out of here yeah like I'm like I'm you know a woman you know that needs to be rescued right and we can have that perspective but what God has done in this hour is he confirmed his word that we are the ones that are bringing forth the word that's right he has empowered his bride to bring forth the word amen so so watch watch what he says and we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna because I'm gonna summarize this I don't want to get out of time but we're going to we're going to summarize this and we're going to go back and look at a scripture because he said here let me see if I can pick up because he deals with he deals with several scriptures here and what and what I did in the study if you'll take these Paul didn't have a new testament and he's dealing with Jews that know the Old Testament so he's going back and he's comparing okay these angels He said this Christ that came was not an angel this Christ that now we're fixing to tell you more about that but this Christ is not dealing with the Christ for Redemption he's dealing with the resurrected Christ every scripture that Paul references here goes back to the Victorious Messiah right not the not the Messiah for sacrifice but the Messiah that rose from the dead now watch this okay we see but under the sun he saith thy Throne of God verse 8 but under the sun he saith thy Throne o God is forever and ever accept her righteousness is a deceptor of thy kingdom thouest love righteousness and hated iniquity and so forth let's go back to Psalms 45 because that's where that comes from and let's read the context because this is just one example but if you'll if you'll go to every one of those scriptures you're going to find a similar thing so Psalms 45 and the first and the first I think six verses here seven verses watch the context of the scripture that Paul used to illustrate the Messiah that he's trying to introduce to these Jews not the Messiah that came as the sacrifice necessarily but as the Messiah who rose from the dead having fulfilled the sacrificial need so Paul is telling us something here because we're going from a position of law into an eternal position all right watch this all right my heart verse 1 for Psalms 44 my heart is indicting a good matter I speak of the things which I have made touching the king my tongue is a pen of a ready writer and I love that because David is saying or whoever it is that wrote this Psalm I don't think this was Osama David but he's but he's saying it may have been but he's saying I'm ready to speak I'm ready to I'm ready to speak because my heart is so excited about what I'm seeing here he said thou oh God Thou Art fairer than the children of men Grace is poured unto thy lips therefore God excuse me hath blessed the forever gerd thy sword upon thy that's not the Messiah dying on the cross that's the one who rose from the dead you see uh you know Jesus and and I hope you understand hi because it's no disrespect to the Cross because but the prophet said we look through the cross okay it's it's it's I lost my thought if you ever do that brother Paul yes yes amen it's it's not look if if we step into Redemption okay here's what it is all right Jesus Jesus died for our sins no question did Jesus have to rise from the dead to forgive our sins the answer is no because it was finished right there when Jesus bowed his head it was finished it was done everything that needed to be done to restore us back to an original condition was accomplished when he bowed his head when he died when he gave up the ghost it was done the sacrifice was made but why did he raise from the dead because he wanted to prove that his death had accomplished exactly what he said it would do and so when he rose from the dead he was the mighty conqueror he had conquered already he had conquered death and in his resurrection he gird the sword and now he has prepared for the restoration of all things amen so watch this so he said gerd thy sword upon thy Almighty o most Mighty with thy glory and thy majesty and in the Majesty I'd prosperously because of Truth and meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach the Terrible Things thine ears are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies this is this is the accomplices what was accomplished at the cross he is dealing in in what Paul is telling you in the book of Hebrews is we're not dealing with the Jesus perspective of redemption we're dealing with law versus eternity if we're going to live look the prophet said it this way if we're gonna I was in I was in a church and my daughter lives in my youngest daughter lives in Canada and I was sitting in a church and brother Steve prasan he's preaching on perfection and he's and he's talking about some of the things we're talking about here maybe not but he's he's dealing with perfection he's dealing with the word being full maturity you know the word Perfection meaning maturity and he's showing going through the scripture and then he begins reading some quotes and he was reading quotes about uh you know if the prophet and how we're how our sins are forgiven Hallelujah everybody's praising God and he even says and look this is what happened he said when the when the when the person that needed the offering would bring the offering the priest wouldn't even look at the person he's looking at the offering see you know oh Hallelujah brother Steve this is the greatest thing that's ever happened our sins are forgiven and then he begins reading quotes from invisible Union where it says it's as though we never did it and everybody's sitting there like and he says well I can tell I need to preach this and again because we're not getting something happened amen something happened where we go from a Time perspective of our sins are forgiven to an eternal perspective of living the life of Christ and I never did it so how was how is God going to speak the word through a bride because she must come to a place where her life never did it yeah right but as long as we're standing over here we have a perspective that well my sins are forgiven and brother Branham gives a good illustration an invisible Union it's one of my favorite quotes out of there he's talking about he said a woman has certain virtues that she must protect all right we're mostly adults we know what he's talking about she has to protect these virtues but if she were to make a mistake she can be forgiven but she can't be justified in this life that's what he says endless life so she could be forgiven if she's going to stand right here but she's forgiven because there is a testimony against her she did it and there's a forgiveness for her but the only place where she can enter into a condition where it never happened is over here that's it people in this hour is a perspective that it never happened and I can't help I was talking with brother Paul today that this even the thought of this has become a scarecrow in the message because you have people that are taking the quotes of the prophet and they're using that as an excuse for their continued sin that's right and Paul says should we sin that Grace May abound he says God forbid this is not about that but it's about recognizing that I have a life that the word says that I have and that's the life I'm going to live by and I don't care what the mirror says I don't care how many mistakes I made but I know as far as I know my heart my heart is this word this is my source this is where it came from John 14 it says it said Jesus says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you the word comfortless is orphans I will not leave you orphans I'm going to show you where you came from and and when you know where you came from you know where you're going you see that's what God has done and so he says here he says here verse 6 thy Throne oh God is forever and ever the scepter of thy kingdom is the right scepter thou lovest righteousness and hate us and wickedness therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with oil gladness above thy fellows and so this is the scripture but the context of it was the mighty conqueror yes it's the resurrected Christ and so that's what Paul is giving us a picture of in the book of Hebrews the difference between a law perspective that the law was sent to us so that we can be good people and the perspective here that we have the Resurrection Life of Christ and so we should be changed by this amen and then in this and then in the second chapter we're running out of time but in the second chapter then Paul let's go back to Hebrews now let's just read a scripture or two here all right because this is this is beautiful I mean Paul is because the the objective in in the book of Hebrews to me is right in the middle I remember my wife and I know there was a brother John Kaufman that preached at our church and he said you look at the you look at the Old Testament and he said you'll see scriptures that lead up to a they lead up to a crescendo and that's the important thing and then it leads to knock down on the other side the the crescendo of the book of Hebrews has let us go on to perfection but you have to understand what Paul is the foundation that Paul is laying coming up to that Perfection to know what Paul is talking about because as long as we're in our human thinking we're not going to understand we're not going to get the benefit of what let's go on to Perfection means or even the availability of the Perfection unless we understand what he's saying here so in the second chapter Paul is very careful and you can take the time to look at it but let's just read let's just read verse well let's let's start it at verse 7 because Paul is dealing with man and the promise that man was given that he would be have dominion over everything but watch this he says and now mate is him talking about man he's quoting the scripture Thou made us him a little lower than the Angels thou Crown as him with glory and honor and and to set him over the works of thy hands he's talking this is a direct scripture out of the Old Testament and talking about the promise of man thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for him that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put in subject put under him but watch this but now we don't see all things put under him that's but we see Jesus because Jesus was the Fulfillment of that and the ones that her part of him watch he says but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons bringing many sons into the same condition that was produced in his resurrection not our goal is not to walk the shores of Galilee like Jesus our goal is the Resurrection Life that he expressed amen amen amen and so he says in bringing many sons in the glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all of One we're all the same it is it sometimes it breaks my heart I was at a Minister's meeting and a brother stood up and and I and I and I don't you know I'm just again I'm saying what I see but her brother stood up ministers and he says our goal is Adam well I'm sorry my goal is not Adam I didn't come from Adam I came from God right I am part of the logos word that made to Creation I'm not part of the creation I am part of the one who made the creation and so you go back to you go back and and it's interesting because the prophet in Christ the mystery God revealed 34 times he said we're going back to Eden so the question for the bride is what part of the Eden relationship are you because that's that's where we'll get into it tomorrow the Melchizedek thought who is this Melchizedek because you can't have I wish I could just go but what we're not we're gonna we're gonna hold it back we're gonna we're gonna hold it back but in the in the garden well I know the serpent was there let's forget about that okay for a minute here's God here's Adam all right the question is is who are you what what part of this relationship are you because you know our goal is New Jerusalem so we're all the way over here New Jerusalem and now we see a city and we see Kings of the Earth that's it and the kings of the Earth come and bring their Glory to the city and Adam would bring his glory to God in the garden so Adam's race is outside the city the bride is not Adam's race so think if we if we had a real revelation of our source think what that would do to us a real genuine revelation of who we are what it would do to us because Revelations 5 would say I am a king and a priest and I'm not a king and a priest when brother Paul preached on Sunday and then the next day I go out and say oh no what am I going to do I don't even know what to do I have the money the Son of God you're not even you don't have a revelation you're just amending something that was said in the word but you don't have a real revelation you're just you're just saying okay the seals are open but they're not open to you right you may have doctrines you may have thoughts of horse riders you may have you may have everything completely perfectly right in your Doctrine and Paul says you can have all knowledge and if you don't have the person of Christ that's it it doesn't it doesn't matter and so what Paul is doing in this second chapter he's he's identifying this he's identifying this Resurrection Life and now he's tying us right into that amen and so whatever he is you are and you look at these scriptures in the Old Testament especially you know where it's dealing with Messiah it's dealing with God and how he dealt with and you think oh that's God that's God way out here but you're the habitation of God and so you did those things you were there amen the prophet said you know he asked job were you where were you when the sons of God shouted the Morning Star Shadow for joy and the prophet said I was there I was there I'm part of that not pre-existence of sold but pre-existence of life right we're part of him and you know what you know what you know what Brother David I'll use this example and I know you don't even know me that well but I know you love me because I love you Dave David you and I grew up in different backgrounds I don't even know your background right I grew up in Florida but I have a memory I I like to use this one I don't know why this one just but I was like three or four years old and I'm in Wappinger Falls New York anybody ever been there and we lived in a trailer park my dad was going to IBM School and and and I was remember I remember there was a big giant field of grass behind our you know and and they had just mowed it and I can remember running out there you know it's smelling that grass and every time just about every time I smoke cut grass I think of that memory well now I can say Brother David I'm telling you this memory and then you'll say well that's that's pretty cool because I have a similar memory to that you know I mean I had something that happened when but that's your memory see you don't really have my memory you're just using your memory to try to identify with me but what would happen if I gave you my spirit then you would have my memory and God has what what kind of limit can spirit of God in us because he experienced he he formed himself into word and he's forming himself into word again in this hour amen amen amen so so let's let's move on just just give me give me give me another hour okay not but but let's let's get over to let's get over to chapter four now watch this progression now because he's he's he's identified that we are dealing with the resurrected Life of Christ amen okay that is a life that is not has nothing to do with sin that is the life that was revealed by the removal of sin that's right and so now he's going to get into something very interesting which is almost I can't even hardly preach a message without talking about the rest of God because because God's rest we have this view okay God created everything and we'll go back to our illustration here he created everything and he looked at all of this and he said this is very good and then we have the image that he sat down oh that's really nice said I'm going to rest up because I'm really tired I made the whole universe it's 93 billion light years across I'm a little wore out but that wasn't God's rest because God's rest was when he stepped into this creation and he walked without him and so when Paul says in verse 1 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest that's it okay this this word rest taking it back to the Old Testament it's not Sabbath Sabbath okay we think rest Sabbath rest Sabbath but this word rest and if you follow that word through the through the Old Testament even the scripture brother Branham uses for the rest that was distributed on the day of Pentecost where it says with stammering lips in another tongue will I speak to the people and this is the rest that word is not Sabbath that word is not now look at the word that's what the prophet said in future homes sometimes you have to follow these words the Sabbath means to cease from works the Sabbath means God would sit down but God's rest is the word Manuka is actually you know in this in in Psalms 22 where it said he leave me beside the Still Waters the word still there is the same word as rest okay and so rest is actually that Psalms 23 I think it is Psalms 23 and verse 2 describes what that rest is because it's actually the word means that the shepherd has taken the flock to a place where they can feed and be satisfied that's the rest so the rest for God is the satisfaction of his own stepping into creation and taking care of his own creation and so Paul is telling you because he started in the in the first chapter laying the foundation of this and and and tying our life in with the life of the resurrected Christ now he's saying don't fail to enter into God's rest okay because God's rest listen God's rest look let's put it this way all creation is groaning and travailing waiting for God's rest they're waiting for a manifestation of sons because you are the outlet of God you are the branches of the tree of life if if anybody comes oh wow if anybody comes to God they're going to come to you and you're going to bear fruit for them amen not for yourself for them but you know the good thing the wonderful thing is we get to eat at first because the life flows through us and it's wonderful Fellowship that we have with the with the Life of Christ but it's living for others your life is for others that's what we'll get into tomorrow in this priesthood so Paul is telling you let us therefore fear lest the promise being left us if any of of of any of us being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it so whatever you do look I and we preached on it somewhere I remember I think it was it at brother David's on on Sunday morning but my favorite scripture in the entire Bible is first Timothy 1 and verse 5. and it says the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart okay the end of all the teaching the end of all the exposure of the word of God to us should produce the Life of Christ amen and if it doesn't I don't care how about your doctrines because it's the Life of Christ and now that in the book of Hebrews is becoming the focus whatever God's desire is that is reflected in you because you have the spirit of God and if God's desire is to fellowship with his creation then guess what you're not about condemning people you're about offering them fruit s and you and you don't have no choice of what they do with it you know I've been in I've been a lot of apple orchards and things and those trees are like here take the fruit here I got some low hanging stuff that's pretty good you know and it and and maybe you take that apple or maybe you don't take that apple and that's what people do but we're so results driven oh well God didn't amuse me because nobody took my apples today it don't matter it doesn't matter all your responsibility is to Bear the fruit and God will take care of the results he wants to do and so this whole thing and we'll and we'll just close with this statement and we'll pick it up tomorrow morning but this whole thing is a foundation the whole rest the whole Resurrection Life of Christ Paul's Association of us with that Resurrection life because we came from that we're a part of that and then he talks about God's rest which is a beautiful subject and would take hours to go through it ourself and then he comes therefore leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ let's go on to Perfection and you know what I got I got a quote here that we'll read Because listen to what brother Branham says I think if this is the one yeah he says he said now watch what he says this is from Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 part one he says he says we have now you the Branham Tabernacle oh I know does anybody ever tape any quotes in their Bibles I mean I got them all over my Bible you know I mean but he says now you're at the Branham Tabernacle oh I know we have healings that's wonderful we have visions that's fine you have spiritual dreams sometimes they're not spiritual dreams and sometimes you we try to help the poor and we do what we can oh that's all right but that's not what we're talking about now he said we're entering into another phase we're entering into another phase leaving the doctrine oh yes we got Doctrine under Christ we believe he was the son of God virgin born we believe that with all these things that's just wonderful but leaving let's go on to Perfection oh my I wish I had the voice of an archangel to bring this to a place where you could see it now he says leaving all the doctrine of Christ all the theolog the theologians all the theology that we know listen to this all about the deity of Christ how he was God made flesh all these other things we're leaving that amen okay because we're coming to a different perspective we're not now for a new believer for people out on the street we preach the cross we have to preach the cross but we're dealing with the people that are eating the book let's take a different perspective let's look at something different let's let this let's not okay I'm redeemed hallelujah what does that mean it means that you have been put put back on an original condition before sin ever happened and although we still make mistakes and I'm not saying any but our Revelation says that is not me we have a different perspective and that's what that's what let me finish reading this let's see Paul goes on he said he said Paul goes on to explain it all just in a few minutes let's read it just a little bit we have laying again the foundation repentance from dead works now we believe that Faith toward God we believe that doctrine of baptism now we just must be baptized we believe that and if laying on our hands we believe in in laying on hands don't we all that sure the Resurrection The Dead all that but he said we're leaving that now it was necessary if you give me a minute I'm going to share that analogy I use with the with the because in in First Corinthians 13 it says it says when that which is perfect just comes that which is in part is done away and I had a and I had a man that I know he's not a message believer but I believe in him he's got an election all right we have amazing Fellowship you know and I've told him about the prophet and he's not really interested in embracing that but we still have Fellowship and What attracted me to this man he sent he sent an email to the church and he says I want to preach the gospel in places where it's never been how many people sitting here have that because you the places where it's never been you may not want to go but this man did and so what attracted me to him and and he began calling me and we would have prayer together so he sends me a text one day a couple of months ago and he says from the stand he says I'm reading here in First Corinthians 13. and it says were there prophecies they shall fail whether there's knowledge it shall vanish away and he says brother he says I study all the time he said what why am I studying if it's all going to vanish away and it said his name's Ricky and I don't hold that against him but when I said brother Ricky it's just like it's like this I said let's say let's say that you're that you want to build this church okay and you and and you you buy this piece of property and you get a set of plans on it and the plan is say Grace Church on there so you know okay this is going to be a church this is cool this is where we're gonna you know and we all helped design the church and everything it's going to be just right so we're going to put the walls up we're going to pour the floor first to put the plumbing in you know and all the stuff and then you I was in construction you know I was involved in all that stuff you put the walls up and then you you put the roof on and then you dry it in and you put the finishes on the inside and everything and then you and then you move in and now it's the are we are we like tonight are we saying those are nice looking walls man that floor look it's man it's a solid good floor no we're using the building for its purpose and so the purpose has come into focus and while the parts are still there it's the purpose is important so when that which is in part when that which is the purpose has come the parts are not done away because you can't do away with them we can't we even even as Eternal beings we had to come through these things that Paul is saying that we had to leave but where our focus is now changing from a perspective of time and the need for Redemption to a place where I am already I'm already redeemed and the lamb has taken the book and and and and grab the book and we say praise God the Lamb's taking the book and for Thou Art Worthy to take the book and loose the seals the rough for thou was slain before the foundation of the world and Hast redeemed us Hast already redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred people nation in tongue and Hast past tense made us unto our God Kings and Priests so that's the kind of people we should be do you love him amen let's bow our hearts our heavenly father oh God thank you so much for your word thank you for there's a reality God that is striking your bride and it's not about oh I got this figured out I got that figured out but it's it's really you get to a place where I don't have nothing figured out it's just him it's just a Life of Christ and now I am freed John 1 12 says that to them gave he power to be the sons of God and you have you have you have accomplished that at the cross and you have confirmed it here at the end time because there is a bride that's assembled and are now reflecting you and you have taken possession of your body and and and the fruit is beginning to show and we thank you with all our heart bless this wonderful group of Believers that would come out take their time to come out and listen to this guy from Florida father have been bring us back in the morning under an expectation Lord that you'll meet with us we love you and we thank you for all these things in Jesus

quote the prophet speaking on quickening Power and I tell you I think quickening power come through our building tonight amen God just speaking the word to us and making it so real to our hearts to just realize my brother and sister we're not I hope I can make it we're not I want to make it Lord if this or that but we have already made it in Jesus Christ amen that he's already made the way and when he said it is finished my brother and sister he wasn't looking at this in a I think but he made a definitive statement it is finished and if we can stand here knowing as Sons and Daughters of God that our names are written in the palms of his hands then who was he speaking to amen he wasn't talking in the abstract he was talking in the very word manifested amen I've had such lovely fellowship with our our brother Stan and we were talking today a little bit about manifested my brother and sister I love how brother Stan spoke these words to me he said the problem is is the things that have malfunctioned or or you know went wrong people then look at that and they're afraid to step into it because it becomes the Scarecrow and the devil uses the Scarecrow to keep you and I from stepping into the very finished work of God Amen I say Lord I want to move beyond that I want to say yes to your word amen and I want to just before we give brother Alex uh just a little bit here amen let's
