[35:59] that but that was good you ever have
[36:02] that happen amen where where you just
[36:04] know it was literally not you listening

[36:11] our lord Jesus standing right there
[36:13] saying hey I I've got a little something
[36:15] special for you today I got something I

[37:35] thank you
[37:36] Lord I would like today to turn in the
[37:39] Book of
[37:40] Judges we're going to speak on the title
[37:43] or thought of the manifestation of
[37:45] hidden power and uh there's several
[37:48] places that brother brandham uses this
[37:51] phrase uh and um we just want to come
[37:56] and draw from several several thoughts
[37:59] that we studied today you know how you
[38:01] get started down a vain certain
[38:03] direction you go in and you kind of
[38:05] start searching that out I I don't think
[38:07] it would edify today if I read every
[38:09] quote that brought me to this place
[38:12] today amen but it all ties together and
[38:15] it ties together beautifully amen you
[38:18] know as Carpenters I've I've helped
[38:20] build you know I don't want to
[38:22] exaggerate so we'll just put it I've
[38:23] helped build hundreds of homes and in
[38:26] all my years from my youth
[38:28] and in the best of our work there comes
[38:30] a
[38:31] time that you have to shave a little
[38:35] here and it's you know you don't want
[38:38] the homeowner to see you out there with
[38:39] a sledgehammer straightening up the
[38:41] walls of their house but sometimes in
[38:43] the human element we find ourselves in a
[38:47] position where we just have to
[38:52] be straightened up by the
[38:55] word amen nothing to be be ashamed of
[38:59] the best of our work is still short but
[39:03] God comes and says I'm going to
[39:04] straighten this out for you I'm going to
[39:06] put it all in order and you know I just
[39:07] been studying some thoughts and started
[39:09] off on all this thing and you might call
[39:11] it a tangent but it was there you know
[39:13] it led me from one spot to another spot
[39:16] to another spot to another spot and
[39:18] there's a few of those spots you know I
[39:20] believe in being transparent there's no
[39:22] use acting like the ministry as some
[39:23] Flawless people that never have problems
[39:26] and always always get it right and I
[39:29] have to admit in the last couple weeks
[39:30] the Lord just kind of said um
[39:35] Paul that little
[39:37] something is not quite right that's
[39:40] right and you have to stop and you have
[39:43] to repent amen you have to say forgive
[39:45] me Lord that's right we never want to be
[39:48] lifted up to the point that we think
[39:50] that it's just preaching that's right we
[39:53] never want to be lifted up to the point
[39:55] we just think oh it's scripture I've
[39:58] heard it before but we want to stay at
[40:00] the point this is my God can we say my
[40:05] God Amen is talking to
[40:08] me amen and if he was here today talking
[40:12] to us we would not turn our ear away but
[40:18] we would say Lord thank you for speaking
[40:21] yes sir amen how many believe that God's
[40:23] speaking to you amen that's the word
[40:25] that's the life judges 16: 19-
[40:30] 22 amen
[40:32] now I encourage you to go back if you
[40:35] haven't read this for a while just let
[40:37] these little details speak to you uh
[40:40] certainly here it is that we know now I
[40:42] want to put a a a preface to this if we
[40:46] Judge Samson too hard then we'll have to
[40:50] take him out of the book of
[40:54] Hebrews we see a lot of mist takes we
[40:57] see a lot of stuff that we'd say how did
[41:00] God let that
[41:03] happen but in God's eyes he so chose to
[41:06] bring him back up in The Heroes of Faith
[41:09] and place him right there in the book of
[41:13] Hebrews and I say that not justifying
[41:16] Samson but I say that to you today to
[41:20] Remember When God chose you that's right
[41:23] he chose you with all of your Earthly
[41:27] flaws
[41:29] included oh thank you Lord amen I've got
[41:33] some Earthly flaws amen and God knew I
[41:36] would have these flaws knew you would
[41:38] have these flaws but he also knew that
[41:40] his word would set you right back where
[41:43] you
[41:44] belong amen he's not going to say
[41:46] they're flawed let them go they're
[41:47] flawed they're flawed they're flawed in
[41:50] fact you look through the scripture
[41:51] you'll find more men that God used that
[41:56] had flaws then you will find that we're
[41:59] perfect amen thank you Lord for choosing
[42:04] us amen so here we are into the story of
[42:10] Delilah and Samson and she made him
[42:13] sleep upon her knees and she called for
[42:17] a man and she caused him to shave off
[42:20] the Seven Locks of his head and she
[42:23] began to afflict him and his strength
[42:25] went from him and she said the
[42:28] Philistines be upon thee Samson and he
[42:31] awoke out of his sleep and said I will
[42:34] go out as at other times before and
[42:39] shake
[42:40] myself and he whis not that the Lord had
[42:43] departed from him now I want to insert
[42:46] this let's be careful that we don't put
[42:49] our place ourselves in a place where
[42:52] God's departed from us yeah see this is
[42:56] a man that's in
[42:57] the book of Hebrews that's right but God
[43:01] departed from
[43:05] him and shake myself and he wish not
[43:08] that the Lord had departed from him but
[43:09] the Philistines took him and put out his
[43:11] eyes and brought him down to Gaza and
[43:14] bound him with feathers of brass and he
[43:17] did grind in the prison house and verse
[43:20] 22 my brother and sister it's such an
[43:24] incredibly powerful scripture sir
[43:27] because you'll see on one sense it's
[43:29] almost out of time if we're looking at
[43:32] this whole Arrangement but God wanted
[43:35] the point to be made how be it the hair
[43:38] of his head began to grow again after he
[43:41] was
[43:42] shaven and now we can say well that's
[43:45] just natural but I need you to catch the
[43:47] spiritual vein today that when we make
[43:50] mistakes and we are repentant of that as
[43:54] it were our hair begins to grow amen
[43:58] hallelujah thank you Lord for your word
[43:59] guide us today father let the word just
[44:01] bring joy in our heart Bring correction
[44:04] let it raise Faith father whatever we
[44:06] find necessary today Lord I believe it's
[44:09] here in your word we ask for your
[44:11] blessings in the name of Jesus Christ
[44:13] amen you may be
[44:19] seated in
[44:21] that we look at what we might consider
[44:24] to be a natural
[44:28] reaction but my brother and sister this
[44:31] verse 22 goes far beyond natural it goes
[44:34] back that the very moment that he failed
[44:38] the very moment that we would say I
[44:40] don't have faith enough I the very
[44:42] moment we would look in the mirror and
[44:44] say I am not an overcomer the very
[44:46] moment we would doubt who we are in
[44:48] Jesus Christ and God would come and
[44:50] speak to us through his word amen the
[44:53] Holy Spirit come down and start to nudge
[44:55] us and the hair of your faith amen might
[44:58] sound like an awkward statement but the
[45:00] hair of your faith starts to recharge
[45:03] again and the reason I can say that and
[45:05] I know that and I will say that just
[45:07] very factual and drive that home is
[45:10] you're here this morning
[45:12] amen cuz if it wasn't a Rejuvenation it
[45:16] wasn't a restoration my brother and
[45:18] sister if it wasn't the word coming back
[45:20] we would have fallen and failed many
[45:23] many years ago and never would we be
[45:26] found again
[45:27] but you see even in the very moment of
[45:29] our shortcomings of life amen faith is
[45:32] already Rising back up again we're
[45:34] already being reminded of the word we're
[45:37] already being reminded by the Holy
[45:39] Spirit of hey look this never was about
[45:42] you it's about me and when we come to
[45:46] that place to recognize that God is in
[45:49] us and that we cannot falter or fade
[45:53] away my brother and sister because God
[45:55] has never failed God has never faltered
[45:58] and he will never leave us nor forsake
[46:01] us where regardless of our circumstance
[46:03] you say but I've had the hardest Trials
[46:06] of my life it doesn't matter what the
[46:08] trial is in fact sometimes the ease of
[46:11] living is more dangerous than the hard
[46:13] trials that we
[46:15] Face amen now we look at this and I just
[46:18] want to just kind of dive into this
[46:21] please uh hold on very close cuz I'll
[46:23] admit I kind of jump around here and
[46:25] there and and you look at this but I
[46:28] want you to remember here starting with
[46:30] this scripture at verse 19 she made him
[46:33] sleep upon her knees amen and it was
[46:36] there my brother and sister in that time
[46:38] if if Samson had been awake and he had
[46:42] saw the
[46:43] razor he would have pushed back it would
[46:46] have been that he still would have
[46:48] strength to resist everything but in his
[46:51] sleep in his Slumber he never saw the
[46:54] razor that was coming to take away his
[46:57] locks of hair and it's this age that
[46:59] we're living in the age of leoda that
[47:02] Satan wants to lull us to sleep and we
[47:05] say but well you know we're laboring
[47:07] we're struggling we're doing this my
[47:09] brother and sister now pardon me to put
[47:11] it this way but we have a first world
[47:15] problem even in our financial problems
[47:18] we're better off than the rest of the
[47:20] world even in our struggles we're in a
[47:22] better position than the rest of the
[47:24] world and I say every developed Nation
[47:27] as a great need to stand up and hear the
[47:30] word preached with strength and
[47:31] authority and the anointing of the Holy
[47:34] Ghost because we are being wooed to
[47:36] sleep Satan has come you know the more
[47:40] you have the more you have to devote to
[47:42] take care of that's right but in the
[47:45] very Spirit of laoda the more we have we
[47:48] want more that's it we desire more we
[47:51] long for more we labor for more and then
[47:54] in that we buy increment
[47:56] increment
[47:58] increment are drawn into the care of
[48:01] life and so it's pulling us pulling us
[48:04] constantly pulling us now my brother and
[48:07] sister the age of sleep and Slumber we
[48:10] look at this you know drawing this out
[48:12] of several different thoughts I like I
[48:14] said I'm kind of going to have some big
[48:16] steps here but we look at the Spirit of
[48:19] Jezebel my brother and sister if Ahab
[48:21] had ever just went down and just married
[48:24] him a good consecrated girl oh the
[48:26] direction of Israel would have changed
[48:29] but he went out and he found that pretty
[48:31] little girl all dled up what we see it
[48:34] was all the covering of an evil heart
[48:38] and this is the world we live in in our
[48:40] big churches and our Beauty and our fine
[48:42] clothes is that we're looking at the
[48:44] outside my brother and sister and never
[48:46] realize that the very nature of it is an
[48:48] evil heart that is causing to draw
[48:51] people
[48:52] away you see as it is I I just want to
[48:55] go back and touch on that
[48:57] see she made him sleep upon her knees
[48:59] and she called for a man called for
[49:02] someone to come be a representation of
[49:04] the authority of the day be a
[49:06] representation of the word for the hour
[49:09] call a man to come and be able to say we
[49:12] can justify our behaviors and our things
[49:14] and what we believe and what we speak
[49:16] and preach and do all of this by our
[49:19] position not God's position that man
[49:22] came maybe he was a simple Barber but he
[49:25] was anointed by a spirit Spirit to come
[49:28] and destroy the vow that he had Samson
[49:32] had in his life that man with a razor
[49:35] was a vow
[49:38] Destroyer he didn't have to be a great
[49:40] man he didn't have to be a knowledgeable
[49:42] man but he had the knowledge of the
[49:46] razor and he cut off Samson's locks and
[49:50] Samson never even knew it
[49:55] right now it's going to start a sound a
[49:57] little direct and I'm sorry if it does
[49:59] sound judgmental but let's just quit
[50:01] dodging around the facts my brother and
[50:04] sister a son or daughter of God would
[50:06] starve to death in a church out here
[50:09] that's they would starve to death and
[50:11] they would then be weak and they would
[50:13] start to Slumber and sleep and their
[50:15] locks their spiritual locks would be cut
[50:17] off and they'll find themselves saying
[50:20] you know what I don't see any difference
[50:22] between this and this I don't see any
[50:24] difference of their interpretation of
[50:27] the Bible and what the Bible itself
[50:29] actually says now it's there in that
[50:32] world my brother and sister that we will
[50:34] find that Satan working in such a
[50:37] subtile fashion recently dealing with a
[50:41] man wanted to get married and it was a
[50:44] difficult it was a difficult but not
[50:46] difficult decision for me to make and
[50:49] you know he I asked him I says well so
[50:52] why is there not a minister in your
[50:54] church that will marry you and and he
[50:56] made a statement that I thought was
[50:58] profound we don't like the
[51:02] preacher and then after he explained
[51:04] himself I kind of understood almost
[51:06] become sympathetic and I said well what
[51:08] is the reason you don't like your
[51:10] preacher and he said well they ordained
[51:13] him and his wife to be the
[51:18] pastors and we don't agree with
[51:20] that now here again please forgive me I
[51:24] just want to make this point they don't
[51:26] agree with a man and a wife being the
[51:30] pastor but there's not anything else
[51:33] they preach that they disagree
[51:36] with they found one thing that they
[51:38] could latch on to and say we don't like
[51:41] this but I know the church I've been to
[51:43] to different activities at that and I
[51:45] know many people that go to this church
[51:48] and my brother and sister this is a part
[51:49] I don't want to sound judgmental but I
[51:51] am going to make this point they're off
[51:53] the word in so many places having a
[51:56] Woman as a co-pastor would almost be the
[51:59] least of their issue that's
[52:04] right but it strikes a
[52:08] cord so there's always going to be a man
[52:12] that'll be out there Desiring to shave
[52:14] off your locks to shave off your faith
[52:18] to do away amen so as we look at this
[52:22] this
[52:23] Jezebel and Delia spirit are exactly the
[52:27] same
[52:28] spirit amen Ahab raised up in a
[52:32] wishy-washy household but still if he
[52:35] had been connected married to a Godly
[52:39] little girl he would have went a
[52:40] different path but he was there and the
[52:42] point that as a man he didn't have any
[52:45] real conviction deep enough conviction
[52:47] and so he marries this little girl uh
[52:50] Jezebel and she now becomes the greater
[52:53] voice greater than
[52:55] God greater than the priests or the high
[52:58] priests or any of these men greater than
[53:00] that this voice did and that voice was
[53:03] wooing
[53:04] Ahab as it were to sleep on his knee on
[53:08] her knee it's
[53:11] okay it's
[53:14] okay God understands we can worship any
[53:17] way we
[53:18] please we can worship in the Groves and
[53:22] we can worship in the incense and we can
[53:24] worship in all of these things and wor
[53:26] that way it's going to be okay cuz God's
[53:30] still
[53:32] God
[53:36] familiar now we
[53:38] see Israel at that time was under
[53:41] Philistine
[53:43] Rule and we'll look at the church in
[53:46] Israel at that time under this
[53:48] Philistine uh rulership that the church
[53:51] had become very loose in their service
[53:53] to God now you had real Believers I hope
[53:56] this doesn't skin anybody but if it
[53:57] starts to skin you just let it skin you
[54:00] amen you come to a place that we get so
[54:03] loose in our worship that you know we're
[54:06] just like hey God understands and and
[54:10] just like the world the the message
[54:12] needs to understand people's needs well
[54:15] I'll tell you we have one need and
[54:17] that's called we need Jesus Christ every
[54:20] other need that we have we can inflate
[54:22] that and raise that up and make it an
[54:24] important point in our life well I need
[54:27] they don't understand me no don't tell
[54:29] me that you're going to use that line
[54:31] that the preacher don't understand you
[54:33] you're not talking to the preacher
[54:35] you're talking to God and if you think
[54:37] God don't understand you then I well I
[54:40] don't even know what to say about that
[54:42] amen God knows your heart amen he knows
[54:45] every thought every need that you have
[54:48] don't talk about the preacher talk to
[54:50] God about it let the preacher speak to
[54:54] you but let it be God's words that are
[54:56] being spoken not a man
[55:04] amen they become very loose in their
[55:06] service to God and you realize when that
[55:09] happens Saints if Grace Tabernacle gets
[55:12] loose in their service to God it's not
[55:14] going to affect just the weak ones in
[55:16] the church it will affect every one of
[55:20] us from young to
[55:24] old it will leave a mark on each one of
[55:27] us and this is what happened in Israel
[55:30] amen so they started to live they
[55:34] started to live at a level of the
[55:41] expectation I want to ask you this
[55:43] morning what's your level of expectation
[55:44] for yourself right you see I can't set
[55:48] that level for you you have to set that
[55:51] level yourself amen this is why the
[55:54] prophet of God continually talked about
[55:57] his own life as he needed to be more
[56:01] sincere man I tell you what you put my
[56:03] level of sincerity next to his level of
[56:05] sincerity and he says he needed to be
[56:07] more oh it's just cuz he's a prophet no
[56:10] he was a Son of God Amen so we can't
[56:14] come back and say well our level is just
[56:16] fine we need to raise the bar but you
[56:19] see what happens if I the pastor raise
[56:21] the bar and you have trouble in your
[56:24] life then you blame the pastor so I'm
[56:26] going to ask you this morning will you
[56:28] in your heart this morning or if you
[56:30] want to lift a hand say Lord I want to
[56:33] raise the bar I want you to raise the
[56:35] bar I want to live at the raised bar I
[56:38] don't want to settle for a mediocre
[56:40] Christian life I don't want to settle as
[56:43] a borderline believer I want to rise up
[56:47] amen the song says there's a New
[56:48] Testament Church rising up Saints don't
[56:51] go looking down the street don't go
[56:53] looking on the internet you are the New
[56:55] Testament Church that God planted here
[56:58] in this Valley amen we don't need to
[57:00] look for someone else and say oh it's
[57:03] them it's
[57:04] you it's you that he's asking raise the
[57:08] bar
[57:13] amen I've heard too many times and I I
[57:16] don't want this to sound I don't know
[57:17] why I keep going back judgmental but I
[57:20] don't mean it in fact my heart is
[57:22] flooded with Grace this morning because
[57:24] I need it amen amen
[57:27] it's not all about just oh you guys you
[57:29] guys no my brother and sister there's
[57:31] things in my life I'm just like Lord
[57:33] help me raise the bar higher this bar is
[57:37] not high enough Lord I know it's not
[57:40] high
[57:45] enough Samson started consorting with
[57:50] Delilah I hope you don't mind me being a
[57:52] little straightforward I can see Samson
[57:54] you know brother Brown said he was n
[57:56] some great great big huge muscular guy
[57:59] but I think he was probably you know
[58:01] there was something about
[58:03] him he sees
[58:07] Delilah
[58:09] my look at that
[58:14] girl said turning his head he turned it
[58:16] the other
[58:18] way pretty soon who is that girl oh
[58:21] that's
[58:24] Delilah hey hey
[58:27] you he started consorting he started
[58:31] being in arrangement of two
[58:39] together you think Samson if he' to
[58:41] realized that Delilah's whole goal was
[58:44] to collect the bounty on Samson's
[58:48] head in the modern day we you know oh oh
[58:51] they married for
[58:53] money I don't know that there's anybody
[58:56] in this church would be able to stop and
[58:57] say yep I'm married for money CU we
[58:59] ain't got enough money around here to
[59:00] really count but I tell you it's a
[59:04] nature it's a spirit that people
[59:06] constantly they want something better
[59:08] but what the prophet of God said you
[59:10] find someone with the Holy Ghost and
[59:13] character and you've got it right there
[59:15] amen I kind of simplified that but you
[59:17] see my brother and sister that Delilah
[59:19] knew what the Philistines wanted to do
[59:22] to Samson but they couldn't seem to do
[59:24] it
[59:26] they approach him with an army he
[59:28] defeats them with a
[59:31] Jawbone they lock him in the city he
[59:34] carries the gates
[59:36] away everything that happened and Samson
[59:39] didn't sound like too nice of a guy in a
[59:41] sense because you know when they behave
[59:43] like they did he just went out here and
[59:46] caught a whole bunch of foxes and tied
[59:48] their tails together and burnt all their
[59:50] wheat and they said we're going to get
[59:51] him for that was just an excuse for him
[59:55] you might have something in your life
[59:57] that you know shouldn't be there and
[59:59] youd say well the devil's the devil got
[1:00:01] me because of this no he didn't he just
[1:00:03] wants
[1:00:04] you he finds any excuse he just wants
[1:00:07] you that's right yeah we'll touch on
[1:00:10] that just a little bit more here so as
[1:00:13] it is he starts hanging out with Delilah
[1:00:15] and my brother and sister if he had
[1:00:17] never laid his head in her
[1:00:20] lap come on never laid his head in her
[1:00:24] lamp h a never never had that issue but
[1:00:28] the prophet of God defines this he says
[1:00:30] right there see she he started laying
[1:00:33] his head in a worldly lap that's right
[1:00:36] he started to come my brother and sister
[1:00:38] and brother brandom also in these words
[1:00:40] lays it out very beautifully uh and that
[1:00:43] if we had not come into that never laid
[1:00:46] our head in the lamp amen we would not
[1:00:48] end up in a compromised position that's
[1:00:52] right you see there's many there's many
[1:00:56] you know brothers sisters in the body of
[1:00:59] Christ and you could say well you know
[1:01:01] sister so and so she's just a really
[1:01:04] nice sister just really really like her
[1:01:06] got a great personality she's such a
[1:01:08] helper all of this the prophet of God
[1:01:10] says you know a sister should never even
[1:01:12] wink or do anything that would draw that
[1:01:15] man's attention that's right see and so
[1:01:18] I I put that in there for us to realize
[1:01:20] the devil will use anything he can use
[1:01:23] now I'm not saying we shouldn't be
[1:01:25] brothers and sisters be friends Etc but
[1:01:28] we need to keep that level of decorum
[1:01:30] correctly because if Samson would have
[1:01:32] stood there that day when he first saw
[1:01:34] Delilah and said I Samson am a Son of
[1:01:37] God and that is not a daughter of God so
[1:01:40] therefore the only Fellowship I'll have
[1:01:42] with her is to tell her there is a word
[1:01:44] of Saving Grace a Christ that will come
[1:01:48] and redeem her and then go away from
[1:01:50] that but my brother and sister even that
[1:01:52] becomes a sketchy thing because Satan
[1:01:54] will anoint that
[1:01:56] just like some folks I know amen got
[1:01:58] caught up in a deal she had a
[1:02:01] dream that she was married to the wrong
[1:02:04] man at the same time devil working in
[1:02:07] tandem gives a dream to a
[1:02:10] man you're married to the wrong woman
[1:02:12] this is your wife that's your husband
[1:02:15] they divorc their spouses caused Great
[1:02:17] havoc in their families they didn't even
[1:02:20] make a year in their own marriage and
[1:02:23] both knew it was a mistake but it was
[1:02:26] revocable see how the devil Sly old
[1:02:30] Fox amen we probably ought to teach the
[1:02:34] congregation that song kids song We
[1:02:36] ought to maybe be singing that here Sly
[1:02:38] old Fox amen I don't really know the
[1:02:41] words from that I've heard the kids sing
[1:02:43] it shout it jump up and down stomp their
[1:02:45] feet but it it's a very adequate song
[1:02:47] He's A sly old Fox amen so he laid his
[1:02:52] head in the lap ended up with this
[1:02:53] compromised result and he got wooed woed
[1:02:56] like a moth to the
[1:02:58] flame we won't go into the sort of
[1:03:01] details but he got woed like a moth to
[1:03:03] the flame she was so
[1:03:05] beautiful and he was so consumed with
[1:03:09] lust yeah now lust isn't always just a
[1:03:12] fleshly thing my brother and sister
[1:03:15] people can lust in the spirit right they
[1:03:18] can lust and get caught up in things
[1:03:21] starting to create their own doctrines
[1:03:22] their own ideas their own things and and
[1:03:25] they do that and you'll see how that
[1:03:26] spirit is accepted now there's people
[1:03:29] that say well you know William brandham
[1:03:31] put himself in that position over there
[1:03:34] and and he was no way he was called of
[1:03:36] God he made mistakes he did all of this
[1:03:38] and he did all of that and they are
[1:03:40] judging that my brother and sister do
[1:03:42] they have
[1:03:43] facts I'll tell you what you'll find
[1:03:45] this an interesting thing probably
[1:03:46] already know
[1:03:48] it the critics that are writing books
[1:03:53] against what you
[1:03:54] believe all
[1:03:56] cite the same flawed
[1:04:00] references do they come up with
[1:04:02] something new no sir they they cite this
[1:04:06] it's their reference because so and so
[1:04:07] wrote this and therefore it has to be
[1:04:09] true there's only one writing that is
[1:04:11] true on this Earth and that's the word
[1:04:12] of God Amen if we're going to cite
[1:04:15] something as a reference cite it out of
[1:04:17] the scripture and if you can't cite it
[1:04:19] out of the scripture don't bother to
[1:04:20] cite it that's right amen so we see how
[1:04:24] it was like I said she was was in it for
[1:04:26] the money right because soon as they
[1:04:28] have shaved his head they showed up with
[1:04:31] the reward for her she had no love for
[1:04:34] him and I'll tell you right now I I I
[1:04:36] just maybe I'm speaking a little too
[1:04:38] boldly this morning but if you think
[1:04:39] this world loves
[1:04:42] you if you think there's one thing in
[1:04:46] this world that loves you you're grossly
[1:04:49] mistaken amen this world will sell you
[1:04:53] as though you were litter on the side of
[1:04:55] the road
[1:04:56] to be
[1:04:59] recycled you'll see it over and over
[1:05:02] again oh the devil blesses his
[1:05:05] own you better believe the devil blesses
[1:05:08] his
[1:05:09] own but if you think that you're going
[1:05:11] to join the ranks of his Elite by
[1:05:14] selling out to him you'll find yourself
[1:05:17] in the world of hurt while his
[1:05:19] influencers isn't it interesting Saints
[1:05:22] how we come down to a time and age that
[1:05:26] growing up I never heard the word
[1:05:28] influencer now I must admit I've been
[1:05:30] hiding under a rock out in the
[1:05:31] countryside somewhere for a lot of years
[1:05:34] decades but you know what does it
[1:05:36] suddenly come you've got people they're
[1:05:39] Tick Tock
[1:05:41] influencers they're YouTube
[1:05:44] influencers they're I can't remember all
[1:05:46] the rest of those other whatevers cuz I
[1:05:48] could care less about
[1:05:50] them
[1:05:53] influences do you
[1:05:56] go do a search you will you find an
[1:05:59] influencer that is saying get back to
[1:06:01] the
[1:06:02] word go to the word go to the word no
[1:06:07] instead you find influencers that want
[1:06:09] to influence you like they've been
[1:06:13] influenced that's the only thing they
[1:06:15] know and the devil's saying I'll send
[1:06:17] you a check to influence some more
[1:06:20] that's right H
[1:06:23] strange okay now it's time to raise our
[1:06:25] hands how many of you look at Tik
[1:06:27] Tok what's the other ones I can't even
[1:06:29] remember what they're
[1:06:31] called
[1:06:33] anyway no my brother and sister this is
[1:06:37] the world we're living
[1:06:39] in so she wanted his secret she's
[1:06:43] willing to do anything she's anointed to
[1:06:45] do anything to get his
[1:06:48] secret now I want to draw you off on a
[1:06:50] little uh Rabbit Trail here for just a
[1:06:52] moment and the prophet of God shares
[1:06:55] that is seen the tent Vision a and he's
[1:06:58] starting to describe and and share this
[1:07:02] this Vision that he had now I've always
[1:07:04] found it remarkable but become more real
[1:07:07] to me in these later years here you see
[1:07:09] the prophet of God is talking about that
[1:07:12] little tent and that little room in that
[1:07:15] tent and the people are going in they go
[1:07:17] in sick they come out healed they go in
[1:07:20] deformed or disfigured they come out
[1:07:22] perfectly whole they come go in there
[1:07:24] with spiritual disease they come out
[1:07:27] amen and so it's there that I can see it
[1:07:30] now in the in the age of the CNN and Etc
[1:07:33] somebody's going to be like what
[1:07:35] happened in there I want to know what
[1:07:36] happened in there so we can make a story
[1:07:39] about this amen put it on Tik Tok but
[1:07:42] you see what happened my brother and
[1:07:43] sister when that person I would say
[1:07:46] believer goes into that little room and
[1:07:49] something happens to them in that room
[1:07:52] have you been there yes sir amen we
[1:07:54] should all be to lift a hand and say I
[1:07:56] have been there amen explain it to
[1:08:00] me explain it come on we need to publish
[1:08:04] a book on how to go into the presence of
[1:08:07] God and come out and we're going to put
[1:08:09] it up it's got to be Sensational well it
[1:08:12] is Sensational but it's a secret and
[1:08:15] it's a secret between you and God it's
[1:08:18] not between you the pastor in God it's
[1:08:21] between you and God and I say as a
[1:08:24] pastor I care about your experience but
[1:08:27] I can't give it to you I can't make it
[1:08:30] happen it has to be real to you and you
[1:08:33] have to be on fire when you come out of
[1:08:35] that little room I don't think my
[1:08:37] brother and sister you're going to have
[1:08:39] seen people coming out of that little
[1:08:45] room what happened in
[1:08:47] there I can't explain
[1:08:51] it
[1:08:54] huh come on on if we haven't been in the
[1:08:57] room or we haven't been let me rephrase
[1:08:59] that if we haven't been in the room
[1:09:01] recently oh this wasn't a one-time
[1:09:04] experience when God called you he called
[1:09:07] you again and again and again and said
[1:09:10] Come On Come Back To The Well of Grace
[1:09:13] come back to my word come back to the
[1:09:16] life what happened in there God touched
[1:09:19] me I can't explain it but one thing I
[1:09:22] know he touched me yeah wasn't the
[1:09:26] preacher it was Christ himself
[1:09:30] am
[1:09:32] amen so look at this
[1:09:34] pattern this another thought that I have
[1:09:38] in my phone maybe to preach on some more
[1:09:39] but you look at the pattern when the
[1:09:45] church now let's not talk about the
[1:09:47] church in general the real church when
[1:09:50] the real Church finds herself acting
[1:09:53] like the world Now set on your hands I
[1:09:56] don't need a a show of hands cuz I know
[1:09:58] it's every one of you how's that for us
[1:10:02] amen that we get a little something we
[1:10:04] start to act like the
[1:10:06] world Amen Christian
[1:10:10] music might be one of
[1:10:12] those cuz it's just easy it's Lively you
[1:10:15] need cheer it
[1:10:17] up you think that word being sang by
[1:10:22] someone who doesn't really even believe
[1:10:25] believe in the Holy Ghost that's true is
[1:10:28] going to cheer you
[1:10:31] up no
[1:10:32] sorry I'll shock
[1:10:34] y'all if you're listening to gospel
[1:10:37] music of somebody who's not got a clean
[1:10:39] Holy Ghost filled life you might as well
[1:10:40] be listening to Elvis sing Amazing Grace
[1:10:43] because there is no difference and you
[1:10:45] guys would be like Oh Brother Paul is
[1:10:48] listening to Elvis sing Amazing Grace
[1:10:50] what's wrong with him well I'm sorry
[1:10:54] Elvis and Hillsong
[1:10:56] are
[1:10:58] related I just kill that cuz Hill song
[1:11:00] sings a couple songs I like the lyrics
[1:11:02] too you don't know how hard that was for
[1:11:04] me to say that now you look at that my
[1:11:07] brother and sister if it's not filled
[1:11:08] with the Holy Ghost what's it filled
[1:11:10] with that's it amen if it's not inspired
[1:11:13] by the Holy Ghost what's it inspired by
[1:11:16] I don't want to sound critical but I'm
[1:11:17] telling you we have to understand the
[1:11:20] age that we're living in Delilah wants
[1:11:23] your head in her lap
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:31] amen and you know what it is the real
[1:11:33] Church finds herself acting like the
[1:11:35] world and the leodan church wants the
[1:11:37] secret of the hidden power without
[1:11:40] making any sacrifice that's right
[1:11:43] somebody had sent me a little deal it
[1:11:44] might have been sister Jerry I don't
[1:11:46] know but I'm cleaning up my phone I
[1:11:47] cancelled it the other day or deleted it
[1:11:50] but it it was a little deal talking
[1:11:52] about when the
[1:11:55] uh uh modern day
[1:11:57] Christian wants to have Christ but not
[1:12:02] give up the
[1:12:05] world hopefully that's not
[1:12:08] us if it is just lift our hands right
[1:12:10] now and repent if that's us that we want
[1:12:14] these things without any sacrifice then
[1:12:17] I say Lord forgive me Lord help me amen
[1:12:20] we can't be the world and have Christ we
[1:12:22] got to choose my brother and sister
[1:12:26] amen No sacrifice no gain amen you see
[1:12:31] there's really no
[1:12:32] manifestation real Godly manifestation
[1:12:36] without God's
[1:12:38] blessing no matter how anointed the
[1:12:41] preacher is or
[1:12:43] preachers no matter what kind of program
[1:12:46] we have in
[1:12:47] church God's only going to truly bless
[1:12:51] now let's this gets far off there and I
[1:12:53] I don't want to go there but you see
[1:12:54] people can have what you might call
[1:12:56] marginal faith and God will still heal
[1:12:58] them he actually requires more out of
[1:13:01] you than he does out of some of these
[1:13:02] people in the world CU you know better
[1:13:06] you know the truth you know the life you
[1:13:09] know the way that God has for you but
[1:13:12] because it requires more sacrifice for
[1:13:15] us sometimes we'll look out here in the
[1:13:17] world and say I had a friend years ago
[1:13:20] did construction work with him he could
[1:13:23] turn the air and inside a new house that
[1:13:26] we'd be working on
[1:13:27] Blue if you understand my my
[1:13:31] lingo and yet he come to work one day
[1:13:37] strange how this all opened one day he
[1:13:39] goes you know I I I heard you humming
[1:13:41] That Tune are you a
[1:13:43] Christian shows you the mental state
[1:13:46] spiritual State I was in I said well I'm
[1:13:47] trying to be oh he went into a tantrum
[1:13:51] you either are or you aren't don't try
[1:13:53] you either do it or you don't do
[1:13:56] it and then he went outside after that
[1:13:58] tiate and smoked a
[1:14:00] cigarette but you see I got to be good
[1:14:02] friends with
[1:14:03] Larry one day he comes tears in his eyes
[1:14:06] and he says Paul they've just diagnosed
[1:14:09] my wife with
[1:14:12] cancer they give her less than six
[1:14:15] months he was
[1:14:19] broken I liked Larry enough there was
[1:14:21] just something crazy about his
[1:14:22] personality that attracted me
[1:14:26] and we would have been I believe up by
[1:14:29] the post office there that we brought
[1:14:32] prayer requests for Larry's
[1:14:35] wife about four and a half months later
[1:14:38] I'd always ask Larry when I see her hey
[1:14:40] or say to him Larry we're praying for
[1:14:42] you and your wife oh thank you Paul even
[1:14:45] got to where he started calling me
[1:14:50] brother 4 and a half months later he
[1:14:53] comes flying into a house he wasn't
[1:14:55] actually working on that house he was a
[1:14:57] finished
[1:14:58] Carpenter he comes flying in that house
[1:15:01] jumping up and down finally got
[1:15:04] the god healed my
[1:15:07] wife complete they run several tests
[1:15:10] over and over and over again over this
[1:15:12] span of a few days because they were
[1:15:14] sure it had to be wrong she's
[1:15:16] dying now she's perfectly healthy prise
[1:15:20] the Lord now at that stage of my life
[1:15:23] Saints I was like just second I know
[1:15:27] Believers Godly
[1:15:31] lives I don't understand
[1:15:33] Lord God honored their
[1:15:38] faith but Larry cursed like a sailor
[1:15:42] smoked and drank danced
[1:15:45] partied you talk about one confused
[1:15:48] boy like how can this be Lord and
[1:15:52] brother so and so in Tennessee passes
[1:15:54] away from
[1:15:56] answer and we've got Larry's
[1:15:58] wife healed perfectly
[1:16:01] whole I don't
[1:16:04] understand but you see God allowed that
[1:16:07] to come to a place that they are there
[1:16:11] and saying God's with us God's blessing
[1:16:14] us now I want to know I want you to
[1:16:16] answer this to yourself to yourself
[1:16:19] would you rather have truth and die of
[1:16:21] cancer or be healed of cancer and stand
[1:16:24] in the Judgment judged by the word of
[1:16:27] God hard decisions my brother and sister
[1:16:31] don't don't befuddle yourself trying to
[1:16:33] find answers to this God's given you
[1:16:35] truth and truth is greater than natural
[1:16:38] healing amen salvation is more important
[1:16:42] than how many people we can take
[1:16:44] pictures and write a paragraph and yet I
[1:16:46] stand before you believing the word is
[1:16:49] true and that we are healed in the name
[1:16:51] of Jesus
[1:16:53] Christ but it's the truth it's the word
[1:16:56] that matters you see my brother and
[1:16:58] sister impersonation will only take the
[1:17:00] church so far amen amen the word will
[1:17:03] take us all the way the word will take
[1:17:05] us right into his presence amen
[1:17:07] hopefully I'm not sounding too strident
[1:17:09] this morning I just had this bottled up
[1:17:11] and I I thank God I can unbottle it and
[1:17:13] you guys are patient to listen to me now
[1:17:16] where was thy strength uh or where has
[1:17:19] thy strength gone Samson now but the
[1:17:21] church began to try to pattern after the
[1:17:24] world and the devil might have thought
[1:17:26] that they'd had the church bound when it
[1:17:28] organized the Catholic church but when
[1:17:31] the challenge come the Philistines is
[1:17:33] upon these Samson There Rose up a Martin
[1:17:36] Luther that broke every cord and come
[1:17:38] forth preaching justification look how
[1:17:41] the prophet ties this together what it
[1:17:43] is that binds us my brother and sister
[1:17:45] I'm not afraid I I don't like the
[1:17:47] thought of it but I'm Not Afraid as it
[1:17:49] were in a natural side but to be bound
[1:17:53] spiritual that's right
[1:17:55] there's where the Trouble
[1:17:57] Comes amen so you see the devil
[1:18:02] thought that when that happened that he
[1:18:04] had bound the
[1:18:07] church now deah Delilah's motive was to
[1:18:10] find his power and there's where she
[1:18:13] could wreck him after she found his
[1:18:14] power and that's what the devil is
[1:18:16] trying to do with the church is to find
[1:18:19] that secret of power but the Catholic
[1:18:21] cords was broken when God raised up
[1:18:23] Martin Luther
[1:18:25] ain't that incredible amen look how the
[1:18:28] prophet's tying this you know what he's
[1:18:30] saying same spirit amen exactly same
[1:18:33] Spirit we look like they're not even
[1:18:36] related here it's too far in time too
[1:18:38] far in circumstance too far the prophets
[1:18:41] tying these together and saying that's
[1:18:42] exactly the same spirit that come right
[1:18:45] down here same exact devil and I'll tell
[1:18:49] you what that Devil's roaming the land
[1:18:51] amen hallelujah let's go on here amen
[1:18:55] then she bound him again the word bound
[1:18:58] him in the Lutheran church but when the
[1:19:00] scream come the Philistines is upon thee
[1:19:03] they raised up a John Wesley that
[1:19:05] sanctification the second work of Grace
[1:19:07] and it broke the cord and then they
[1:19:09] bound it again and then there come
[1:19:11] another message the philistin is upon uh
[1:19:14] me upon thee and then raised up the
[1:19:17] Pentecostal group that broke the threads
[1:19:20] of The Binding of the barriers of
[1:19:21] denomination and so forth and now we
[1:19:24] find them just about bound
[1:19:26] up
[1:19:29] 1959 that's too bad but it's the truth
[1:19:32] and now we find in the Pentecostal
[1:19:33] Church the very thing that the world
[1:19:35] used to bind the others is binding the
[1:19:38] Pentecostal church just exactly well
[1:19:41] praise God we're in the message we're
[1:19:43] not in Pentecostal churches we're in the
[1:19:47] message come on are you with
[1:19:50] me we're A step above them every one of
[1:19:53] those was A step above the one amen
[1:19:56] everyone amen
[1:19:58] amen hallelujah and the first thing you
[1:20:01] did is try to do is to try to make big
[1:20:05] shows like the other people does try to
[1:20:08] take our preachers our pastors our
[1:20:10] Shepherds and make doctors of divinity
[1:20:12] out of them now I want to tell you we
[1:20:14] don't have any
[1:20:16] Seminary that we send our preachers
[1:20:22] to except for the Seminary of peer
[1:20:25] pressure
[1:20:27] yeah and it's such an interesting online
[1:20:30] course that it can happen
[1:20:35] anywhere anytime come on y'all just
[1:20:39] smile at me please let me see your
[1:20:41] pearly whites cuz none of you ever been
[1:20:44] influenced by peer
[1:20:46] pressure we're all free of that we
[1:20:48] believe the
[1:20:50] message h
[1:20:55] we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[1:20:58] don't need these things in our midst but
[1:21:00] that's where it tries to bind the church
[1:21:02] and then the next thing they tried to do
[1:21:04] is get away from the humility of the
[1:21:09] church I I'll just you know sometimes
[1:21:11] you guys probably think life is just
[1:21:13] gravy on this side of the
[1:21:16] fence but wait till you have somebody
[1:21:18] you had respect for look you in the face
[1:21:20] and say so what is it you guys are
[1:21:22] trying to do with your Family Camp and
[1:21:25] your youth
[1:21:27] Banquets what are you trying to
[1:21:32] do well after I picked myself up off the
[1:21:35] floor it was good I went from that
[1:21:39] little deal and I sat down why are we
[1:21:41] doing
[1:21:44] this
[1:21:46] H young people will you lift your hands
[1:21:49] lift your hand up come on let the world
[1:21:52] see you come on hi hire Titus be an
[1:21:56] example be a leader Titus there you go
[1:21:58] Titus is showing you how to do
[1:22:00] this why is there a youth
[1:22:04] banquet right
[1:22:09] there sister Carrie what would be your
[1:22:12] theme song from the youth
[1:22:15] banquet what would it be worked my
[1:22:17] fingers to the Bone and what do you get
[1:22:21] bony fingers
[1:22:26] but yet that Spirit comes
[1:22:28] in what is it you're trying to
[1:22:32] do well what we're trying to do is get
[1:22:35] all your 14y Olds to move from your
[1:22:37] church to
[1:22:39] ours come on silliness but Spirits are
[1:22:43] there that's right why I can stand
[1:22:47] before you and stand before the Lord
[1:22:48] today to tell you my heart is pure if it
[1:22:52] wasn't for brothers and sisters in this
[1:22:53] church and labors you know how much I
[1:22:55] gave into the youth banquet sounds like
[1:22:58] a good idea sounds like a good idea
[1:23:01] sounds like a good idea sounds like a
[1:23:03] good
[1:23:04] idea and others
[1:23:06] labored and the outside world says
[1:23:10] why why don't you just let your young
[1:23:14] people go over here to the
[1:23:19] Philistines I tell you what we'll do
[1:23:21] we'll pull a sword and we'll fight to
[1:23:22] the bloody death my brother and sister
[1:23:24] for for our young people we are not here
[1:23:26] to give them to the Philistines we're
[1:23:29] not here to say I'm going to let my
[1:23:31] children go and God's in control and
[1:23:33] whatever God wants to happen will happen
[1:23:35] I'll tell you God's in control and he
[1:23:37] gave you a backbone and he gave you a
[1:23:39] heart and a love for not only your
[1:23:41] children but for every child amen and
[1:23:44] that's where we stand today but see how
[1:23:46] those Spirits are they're always
[1:23:49] undermining
[1:23:51] undermining
[1:23:53] yeah but I tell you how it works the
[1:23:55] devil's that way reminds me of a cartoon
[1:23:58] can I share a cartoon with you amen it
[1:24:00] shows two prisons in the desert and it
[1:24:02] shows this really industrious guy he's
[1:24:04] got an overlarge spoon from the kitchen
[1:24:07] and he breaks up the floor in his cell
[1:24:09] and he digs down and he starts
[1:24:11] digging and he's like I've lost track of
[1:24:14] time I've lost track of purpose I'm and
[1:24:16] he's digging and digging finally pops
[1:24:19] up and he's made the whole few hundred
[1:24:22] yards and he's right in the middle of
[1:24:24] the other
[1:24:27] prison that's what the devil's trying to
[1:24:29] do when he
[1:24:30] undermines just go
[1:24:32] ahead come on brother Trevor let's go
[1:24:34] dig a S
[1:24:35] Tunnel but if we're not careful we just
[1:24:38] find ourselves prisoners in another
[1:24:41] place we're not here to have our
[1:24:43] children just prisoners in another place
[1:24:45] we're here to see them set free by the
[1:24:47] holy spirit amen and so it's there that
[1:24:51] we don't want to come amen and and and
[1:24:53] make our children that have to conform
[1:24:56] what we want them to do is receive the
[1:24:57] Holy Ghost to meet Jesus Christ face to
[1:25:00] face and so that's where it tries to
[1:25:02] bind the church next thing they try to
[1:25:04] do is get away from the humility of the
[1:25:06] church we're better than another church
[1:25:08] oh we're more important we have youth
[1:25:10] banquet and a Family Camp well why don't
[1:25:14] we add a camping trip on top of that and
[1:25:16] then why don't we have a couple's
[1:25:17] banquet wait we can't afford it no why
[1:25:22] are we doing it God's the provider amen
[1:25:25] not UPS we're trying to lift the body of
[1:25:28] Believers up not tear them down amen
[1:25:31] amen get better dress group or better
[1:25:33] better educated into the church trying
[1:25:35] to make our take our ministers and send
[1:25:38] them off to some Seminary to learn a lot
[1:25:40] of Education pretty obviously this one
[1:25:42] hasn't attended when you do that you
[1:25:44] just Rob the church and bind it of the
[1:25:46] power of the Holy Ghost that's exactly
[1:25:48] the truth we're here to be free my
[1:25:51] brother and sister not bind ourselves I
[1:25:53] want I I you don't have to lift your
[1:25:54] hands but I just want you to think about
[1:25:56] this how many here today could say I
[1:25:58] have bound myself yeah not even the
[1:26:02] devil not that people over there not
[1:26:04] here I bound myself now that is not the
[1:26:08] spirit of the Holy Spirit that's right
[1:26:10] amen we find Liberty in Jesus Christ we
[1:26:13] don't just dig a tunnel from one prison
[1:26:15] to another hallelujah
[1:26:22] amen I'm going to hurry
[1:26:25] you notice I didn't say I was going to
[1:26:32] quit you know what the S Satan's sitting
[1:26:35] over here on the picket fence on the
[1:26:38] rail and he studied us and he's found
[1:26:40] how to bind us that's
[1:26:44] right can I be blunt this morning what
[1:26:47] will bind brother Trevor or sister
[1:26:49] Carrie might not bind brother Ivan
[1:26:52] sister Nadia
[1:26:54] and what would bind you might not bind
[1:26:57] them amen so this Devil he's got all
[1:27:00] kinds of programs he doesn't just come
[1:27:02] with one little program you're in a cult
[1:27:06] sister Jerry and I was discussing that
[1:27:08] we we had a quite lengthy discussion on
[1:27:10] that you know I'm I bring it once again
[1:27:12] I know I've wore this statement out and
[1:27:14] I'll just continue to wear it out if
[1:27:16] we're a cult we're the worst run cult on
[1:27:18] the face of the Earth cuz the only one
[1:27:21] that's coming to your house telling you
[1:27:22] how to live is the Holy Ghost amen sir
[1:27:25] would you get critical about that you'll
[1:27:27] find that even Jesus Christ would qualif
[1:27:30] qualify as a leader of a
[1:27:33] cult oh
[1:27:36] devil
[1:27:38] scarecrow stay away stay away stay away
[1:27:41] you might get delivered you might get
[1:27:43] saved you might get the Holy Ghost stay
[1:27:45] away as though the Holy Ghost was
[1:27:49] poison but you see that's where Delilah
[1:27:53] was yeah I'm going to keep coaxing you
[1:27:56] right into my lap I wrap my loving arms
[1:28:00] around
[1:28:01] you no one loves you like I do I'm sorry
[1:28:05] that line only works for our Lord Jesus
[1:28:07] Christ right it don't work for anything
[1:28:12] else oh another definition of
[1:28:15] cult they try to separate
[1:28:19] you from those things around you
[1:28:24] remind me young people of where our
[1:28:28] young adults class
[1:28:30] was being unequally yed imagine the Holy
[1:28:34] Ghost is so bad that it wants to
[1:28:37] separate you from
[1:28:40] sin I mean that's unfair you should be
[1:28:44] able to have free access to sin but what
[1:28:47] the devil don't get they don't get so
[1:28:49] there's no desire there to be that
[1:28:52] person we don't need to build a
[1:28:55] we could all walk out of here today and
[1:28:57] go hog wild crazy my brother and sister
[1:28:59] except for you can't because the Holy
[1:29:02] Ghost is in you not the preacher
[1:29:05] nobody's going to follow you around
[1:29:07] right amen now let's look at this here I
[1:29:09] need to move on Amen so Satan he's found
[1:29:13] his way to bind us you know what some of
[1:29:15] this is so subtle hope you don't mind I
[1:29:18] don't see anybody Fanning themselves
[1:29:20] this morning looks like I'm the only one
[1:29:21] maybe that's hot ah he's found his way
[1:29:24] to bind us it's too hot in church
[1:29:27] today someone sitting on the other side
[1:29:29] says it was too
[1:29:31] cold
[1:29:35] separation brother Paul was too
[1:29:39] loud too quiet in
[1:29:41] here they had the Holy Ghost they'd make
[1:29:43] more
[1:29:45] noise the others on the other side of
[1:29:47] the aisle are like really you think
[1:29:48] noise is a
[1:29:50] sign
[1:29:51] H use too many quotes
[1:29:55] I just want to hear from the
[1:29:58] Bible not enough
[1:30:01] quotes I'm kind of thinking that that
[1:30:03] was just Brother Paul's
[1:30:08] opinion
[1:30:10] huh got no emotion in our church
[1:30:13] everybody's
[1:30:16] there you know you got a problem in
[1:30:18] church when they have two or
[1:30:19] three what do they call them defib or
[1:30:22] whatever things in the back
[1:30:25] church is dismissed the deacons are
[1:30:27] there
[1:30:32] sorry come
[1:30:35] on there's too much emotion in our
[1:30:42] church
[1:30:45] oh well where's that perfect fine
[1:30:48] line if the church was just like me
[1:30:55] okay the church was just like
[1:30:57] you well we won't go there that that
[1:31:00] that' be just a little bit
[1:31:03] cutting now John
[1:31:05] 16:13 said how be it when he the spirit
[1:31:08] of Truth is come he will guide you into
[1:31:11] all truth who believes this amen for he
[1:31:15] shall not speak of himself but
[1:31:17] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:31:19] speak and he will show you things to
[1:31:22] come now I want you to take that script
[1:31:23] scripture and make it a personable uh
[1:31:26] personal applicable thing in your life
[1:31:29] amen hallelujah it won't speak of
[1:31:34] himself now don't get judgmental on
[1:31:36] somebody that says and
[1:31:38] I cuz that's who God was dealing with CU
[1:31:42] you can't go around saying and the Lord
[1:31:46] showed
[1:31:48] you unless you know the Lord showed
[1:31:51] them h
[1:31:55] won't speak of himself but what he hears
[1:31:58] is what he's going to speak that's right
[1:32:00] I want to know is did that work for you
[1:32:02] amen did that work for you God spoke to
[1:32:03] you and said you're a daughter of God
[1:32:05] you're a Son of God you are the word
[1:32:08] made manifest in flesh walking on the
[1:32:11] face of the Earth today amen come on
[1:32:13] some of us need to embrace that that we
[1:32:16] are the word in flesh I don't care how
[1:32:19] you feel let me go back here I don't
[1:32:21] really care if it's too hot or too cold
[1:32:25] too loud too quiet too many quotes not
[1:32:28] enough quotes there's no emotion there's
[1:32:31] too much emotion it's not any one of
[1:32:34] those it's the word down inside of you
[1:32:38] that speaks to you and says I know that
[1:32:41] I know that I'm a Son of God a daughter
[1:32:44] of
[1:32:45] God hallelujah he speaking to
[1:32:49] you and he shall glorify me for he shall
[1:32:52] receive of my mine and shall show it
[1:32:55] unto you all things that the father hath
[1:32:58] are mine amen therefore said I that he
[1:33:02] shall uh take of mine and shall show it
[1:33:04] unto you a little while and you shall uh
[1:33:07] you shall not see me and again a little
[1:33:10] while and you shall see me because I go
[1:33:13] to the father boy that just okay I'm not
[1:33:15] going to see him but I'm going to see
[1:33:19] him Hallelujah Saints you realize what
[1:33:22] the word is just clared I don't need to
[1:33:25] see Jesus in the flesh amen because I
[1:33:28] see him in you and I see him in me and
[1:33:32] so while I didn't see him here I see him
[1:33:35] now amen while he's walking right here
[1:33:38] in our midst and the word is coming
[1:33:40] forth I don't need a tangible physical
[1:33:44] body other than where he chose to live
[1:33:46] amen amen glad to meet you Jesus Christ
[1:33:50] amen amen amen hallelujah
[1:33:54] that ought to be our position amen that
[1:33:56] ought to be amen so he went to the
[1:33:59] father come back and he's living in you
[1:34:01] amen and the devil would like to say
[1:34:04] well you guys follow a
[1:34:05] man I
[1:34:07] do praise God I follow a man the man
[1:34:11] Christ
[1:34:12] Jesus Hallelujah that's who I
[1:34:15] follow amen the man Christ Jesus right
[1:34:21] amenallah
[1:34:24] so too hot too cold what do we do amen
[1:34:29] now in the uncertain sound brother Bram
[1:34:31] says here are we all right I know it's
[1:34:33] getting a little warm in here and the
[1:34:34] clock is just wasting away but in the
[1:34:37] uncertain sound brother Brown says any
[1:34:39] manner woman that's born of the spirit
[1:34:41] of God knows where they
[1:34:44] stand can we say Amen to that
[1:34:48] amen can I throw a curveball at
[1:34:51] you if you're not totally lying up in
[1:34:54] the word you know
[1:34:57] it you
[1:34:59] know this would be
[1:35:01] awkward but I can tell you the last time
[1:35:04] I was at your house and spied on
[1:35:07] you and I got my little
[1:35:10] notebook hey I even got a coffee cup at
[1:35:12] home that says something about be
[1:35:13] careful what you say you might end up in
[1:35:15] a
[1:35:16] sermon that's
[1:35:20] right do I need to go spy on your
[1:35:27] house no because he's there that's
[1:35:30] that's right exactly he's
[1:35:33] there he is going to let you know amen
[1:35:37] where you stand amen don't even have to
[1:35:40] tell the preacher that's right amen all
[1:35:43] the preacher does is just preach that's
[1:35:46] it and you're there gleaning it out of
[1:35:48] the word saying that is a problem in my
[1:35:52] life I should do this and I shouldn't do
[1:35:55] that M but you know the devil s Fox can
[1:35:58] we sing that together sir amen he's a
[1:36:02] Sly old
[1:36:04] Fox the preacher was pointing at
[1:36:11] me oh here just a second let's get this
[1:36:14] so it's no repercussion for me it's all
[1:36:17] pointed at you the preacher was
[1:36:20] preaching at me was he really
[1:36:25] seriously I say this a little bit joking
[1:36:28] but
[1:36:29] truthful if you saw what was going
[1:36:32] through the preacher's mind you'd say
[1:36:33] that looks more like
[1:36:38] static preacher was preaching at me I'm
[1:36:41] sorry it was Jesus Christ preaching at
[1:36:44] you because you see you're my friends
[1:36:46] and I love every one of you love your
[1:36:49] families and I I just you know there's
[1:36:52] hardly a day I get in the car leave from
[1:36:54] church but when I'm like oh my what did
[1:36:57] I do what did I
[1:37:01] say and somebody send you a
[1:37:04] text this is what I was going through I
[1:37:07] needed to hear that that's
[1:37:10] right oh you mean you have foolishness
[1:37:15] of preaching that's right not the word
[1:37:18] that's
[1:37:19] foolish but God's delivery sometimes a
[1:37:23] appears foolish you know why I like to
[1:37:27] analyze
[1:37:32] everything because the foolishness of
[1:37:34] preaching allows those who don't want to
[1:37:37] receive it to find their reason to not
[1:37:42] receive it
[1:37:45] amen there's the foolish
[1:37:47] part not the man that brought it not the
[1:37:51] motive behind it not the word he spoke
[1:37:55] but the foolish compartment gives every
[1:37:57] individual their excuse that's it that
[1:38:02] they can take it and set it
[1:38:05] aside I'm not being too mean today am
[1:38:09] I amen regardless of what takes place or
[1:38:12] how many says yes or no they know where
[1:38:14] they stand there's no uncertain sound
[1:38:17] hallelujah oh by the man who possesses
[1:38:19] it the woman who possesses it and I want
[1:38:21] to just add right in here my brother and
[1:38:23] sister we're not here pointing some
[1:38:24] figure of who does and who doesn't you
[1:38:26] just press to the mark of the high
[1:38:28] calling and you'll be one of those that
[1:38:30] has it amen don't stop for anything
[1:38:35] amen the man who possesses it the woman
[1:38:38] who possesses it oh what a blessed
[1:38:40] person they are no wonder David said
[1:38:42] they were blessed the blessed person lay
[1:38:44] him up in the operating table and take
[1:38:46] and try and cut the blessing out of him
[1:38:50] come on Saints amen you can't cut the
[1:38:52] blessing out of a son or daughter of God
[1:38:54] filled with the Holy Ghost amen it's the
[1:38:57] very fiber of their being it's who they
[1:38:59] are it's their heart it's there every
[1:39:02] part of them amen is blessed you'll
[1:39:05] never find it it's a hidden power it's a
[1:39:08] hidden something but it's there and
[1:39:10] every man that ever had it knew they got
[1:39:13] it every man and woman that ever had it
[1:39:15] knew they got it let's come to the place
[1:39:18] my brother and sister on the worst day
[1:39:20] of your life that you could lift Your
[1:39:22] Hands to Heaven and say I know by the
[1:39:25] grace of God I am a blessed person I
[1:39:28] know that he's poured his favor out on
[1:39:31] me it's a devil that's telling you
[1:39:33] you're not God corrects by the word he
[1:39:36] doesn't correct by Superstition or
[1:39:38] tradition or opinion or emotion he

[1:39:49] it knew they got it no uncertainty every
[1:39:51] man that's born of the spirit of God
[1:39:53] knows when he passed from death into
[1:39:55] life Hallelujah now the prophet's not
[1:39:57] saying that you knew on such and such
[1:40:00] date in 1988 at this
[1:40:03] time I can't really tell you my brother
[1:40:05] and sister exactly where it was now my
[1:40:07] testimony is not one to boast about but
[1:40:10] I tell you what I ran away I ran far I
[1:40:13] ran fast amen but what I didn't realize
[1:40:16] is just like the dog in the yard I had a
[1:40:19] chain on me and I got to the end of that
[1:40:22] chain and I remember the moment I got to
[1:40:24] the end of the chain I got to that place
[1:40:27] I remember that more
[1:40:30] so than the day that I actually
[1:40:34] remember oh I Had My Moments Church in
[1:40:37] Star Idaho brother Harold
[1:40:41] hilderbrandt preaching away inspired
[1:40:44] preaching and he's talking about how
[1:40:46] they would be someone that would come to
[1:40:49] a stage of their life and they would
[1:40:51] recognize they can't live without Christ
[1:40:55] and he's pointing his hand out there and
[1:40:57] I promise you there was a sight on the
[1:40:59] end of that and it was pointed right at
[1:41:02] me and I was there going that's the
[1:41:04] truth amen that's the
[1:41:07] truth why can't live without him amen
[1:41:10] sister Jerry knows those days she went
[1:41:12] to church just as often in them days
[1:41:14] without a husband as she did with a
[1:41:17] husband he had to work
[1:41:19] Sundays he actually was like I have to
[1:41:22] work this Sunday
[1:41:25] but God was doing something amen greater
[1:41:29] amen that's right well he certainly got
[1:41:32] a sense of humor because I'm here
[1:41:33] preaching to you
[1:41:36] amen every man knows he's pass from
[1:41:39] death into life knows the place the hour
[1:41:41] of the minute brother brandham knocks on
[1:41:42] the pulpit six times and when death
[1:41:44] changed to life when unbelief of the
[1:41:47] Bible changed to believe every word of
[1:41:49] it when hotty and high-m minded things
[1:41:51] passed to Humble Christian and they know
[1:41:54] when death passed to life amen I say
[1:41:57] Amen to that we know I know when death
[1:42:00] passed to life I don't need to be able
[1:42:02] to say it happened in this exact second
[1:42:04] right here but I know that I made that
[1:42:07] trip from Death right into life amen
[1:42:10] amen
[1:42:11] hallelujah now look I got to close this
[1:42:13] up Samson at the grinding wheel not one
[1:42:17] drop of natural
[1:42:20] sight not one thing nobody said hey look
[1:42:22] at the track I found
[1:42:23] the
[1:42:24] park nothing he's at the grinding wheel
[1:42:28] going around and around and around and
[1:42:32] around just like we were
[1:42:36] amen but see something was happening
[1:42:39] down inside that come on Saints don't be
[1:42:43] ashamed if you're going around and
[1:42:44] around amen just start asking God to
[1:42:47] give you a sight that's far beyond
[1:42:49] natural amen let him speak to your heart
[1:42:52] amen but you see there was a vow taking
[1:42:56] place whether Samson had sight or not
[1:42:58] there was a vow that Nazarite vow that
[1:43:02] he had with God he broke the vow but God
[1:43:05] never broke it God never said you broke
[1:43:08] the vow I'm breaking you God said no I'm
[1:43:12] going to let you go Samson and one day
[1:43:14] the very vow that I made to you will
[1:43:17] come to pass and that's what made him a
[1:43:20] judge in Israel amen it wasn't about his
[1:43:24] Stellar life cuz there was nothing
[1:43:26] Stellar about life but it was a fact
[1:43:28] that God chose him to be a judge and I
[1:43:31] want to tell you today God chose you you
[1:43:34] might not feel like it you might not
[1:43:35] think you look like it you might not at
[1:43:37] the very moment be acting like it but
[1:43:40] neither did Samson but God said I've
[1:43:42] chose you to judge Le oia I chose you to
[1:43:46] be the final voice to the final age I
[1:43:50] chose you you didn't choose you I chose
[1:43:53] you and then he's there and I tell you I
[1:43:58] have to just share this with a little
[1:43:59] humor cuz that's the way it struck me

[1:46:29] the moment of pushing the grinding wheel
[1:46:32] was there blind without Revelation but
[1:46:35] something was happening on the inside
[1:46:37] Can someone say thank you Lord for
[1:46:39] something on the inside amen and the
[1:46:43] prophet says that one little hair
[1:46:44] started to grow that's right and then
[1:46:46] they call him to make him sport
[1:46:49] y see God's always on time yes sir God
[1:46:53] is always on time they called him to be
[1:46:57] sport God didn't give him I don't know

[1:47:02] building
[1:47:04] whatever

[1:47:40] stairs amen I decided Lord don't ever

[1:47:44] blind I don't think I could survive
[1:47:47] being
[1:47:47] blind here Samson In the Flesh stumbling
[1:47:52] along
[1:47:53] but something's happening that's it
[1:47:55] God's in control that's it they lead him
[1:47:58] close to the pillars and Samson by
[1:48:01] Revelation not by Vengeance or
[1:48:04] Revenge but by anointing amen of the
[1:48:07] heart amen they lead him over there to
[1:48:10] the pillars and he asks that young
[1:48:13] man can you can you help me find the
[1:48:18] pillars and he judged the Philistines
[1:48:21] harder it's the end of what looked like
[1:48:24] a tragic life than he did in all of his
[1:48:27] previous
[1:48:29] life come on Saints don't let the devil

[1:48:54] Le to see a world that cares nothing
[1:48:56] about God Amen called you for that amen
[1:49:00] hallelujah amen amen and as verse 22

[1:49:31] tag in a very special
[1:49:34] unit and I only shot a mediocre Antelope
[1:49:38] but I had my opportunity to shoot a
[1:49:40] monster and I blew it and when this
[1:49:43] Antelope was
[1:49:45] there I was so desperate to kill an
[1:49:48] antelope do you Hunters know what that
[1:49:50] feels like
[1:49:53] I crawled through desert cactus till my
[1:49:56] arms were clear full of
[1:49:59] quills and I shot 500 yards smidge over
[1:50:03] 500
[1:50:05] yards I hit four feet below and four
[1:50:08] feet in front of this Antelope and I
[1:50:10] laid there on the ground and literally
[1:50:12] had a tear popping my eyes like I've
[1:50:14] done all this for
[1:50:16] nothing and I said

[1:50:38] tell you how gracious the Lord is I I
[1:50:40] don't own that good of a rifle that good
[1:50:41] a scope I thought man that looked like
[1:50:44] it was four feet in front of him and
[1:50:45] that looked like that was four feet
[1:50:46] below him so I just raised the
[1:50:48] crosshairs up and I thought okay from
[1:50:50] his shoulder four feets right here and
[1:50:52] and 4T low I don't know what 4 feet is
[1:50:55] but he's
[1:50:56] probably
[1:50:59] boom I got me an envelope you know how
[1:51:02] much impact that had on my
[1:51:04] life I lost the unction before I even
[1:51:08] got home

[1:51:40] hope I got no hope I failed so many
[1:51:42] times I'm telling you Samson failed so
[1:51:45] many times my brother and sister and God
[1:51:48] still brought him right back and placed
[1:51:50] him in Hebrews 11 to give you an example
[1:51:53] of what it is to see the power of God
[1:51:56] not how strong you are but the power of
[1:51:59] God that's what we need to pursue is the
[1:52:01] power of God not power and strength in
[1:52:04] this body but yet God anointed him to
[1:52:07] have strength in the Physical Realm amen
[1:52:10] and push those pillars over and killed
[1:52:13] more in that moment than he did in all

[1:52:33] the
[1:52:34] world how many times we've tried to
[1:52:38] explain the message so they could just
[1:52:39] see
[1:52:40] it unless they're ordained to they won't
[1:52:43] see it you don't owe an explanation to
[1:52:46] them you do owe to live the life in
[1:52:49] front of them that backs up your
[1:52:51] testimony amen amen we don't need to

[1:55:26] for the Life of Christ to be manifested

[1:55:30] in Christ but let that life be
[1:55:32] manifested in me amen and the Holy Ghost
[1:55:35] is the hidden power the devil can't find
[1:55:39] he will never find that hidden power
[1:55:42] that holds you and keeps you and sends
[1:55:44] you to your Eternal destination amen he
[1:55:47] can't find it the devil will never have
[1:55:50] it he wants
[1:55:54] but well praise the Lord one last
[1:55:56] thought musicians if you please
[1:56:04] come we take the parable out of
[1:56:06] scripture the story out of
[1:56:08] scripture we
[1:56:10] recognize there was a near
[1:56:13] Kinsman that's it that's right our
[1:56:17] nature placed us as the near Kinsman
[1:56:23] you'll never see the devil on the
[1:56:26] cross and if you want to put the devil
[1:56:28] right back in his place when he talks
[1:56:30] about how he has Revelation and he has
[1:56:32] knowledge and he has these things just
[1:56:34] ask the devil if he's willing to die for
[1:56:39] you come on devil you want me to go out
[1:56:42] here and do whatever and act like
[1:56:43] whatever and and
[1:56:45] whatnot die for me if I'm that valuable
[1:56:49] die for
[1:56:50] me but you see the near Kinsman say I
[1:56:53] can't do that cuz it might
[1:56:55] Mar my
[1:56:58] testimony imagine how the Earth would
[1:57:00] Rejoice if the devil said I can do
[1:57:02] anything Jesus Christ did he knows he
[1:57:04] can't that's
[1:57:06] it I'm going to go climb on that
[1:57:09] cross I'm going to put in the cave I'm
[1:57:12] going to do it for
[1:57:16] you he
[1:57:19] can't but we don't need to crucify Jesus
[1:57:22] Christ Christ again and again he died
[1:57:24] once for us that is sufficient
[1:57:27] Hallelujah love the Lord today hopefully
[1:57:30] your pot roast isn't pot smoked
[1:57:34] now Hallelujah we'll skip over these
[1:57:37] things right
