[51:08] 17 and after six verse one after six
[51:11] days Jesus taketh Peter James and John

[51:16] his elect he took those that he was he
[51:19] chose
[51:20] out amen I don't want to get caught up
[51:24] too much on these things I just I want
[51:26] to get through this if the Lord he'll
[51:28] help me Peter James and John his brother
[51:30] and bringeth them up into a high
[51:32] mountain
[51:33] apart and was transfigured before them
[51:36] and his face did shine as the
[51:38] sun and his reignment as white as the
[51:41] light and behold there appeared unto him
[51:44] unto them Moses and Elias talking with
[51:47] him then answered Peter and said unto
[51:49] Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here
[51:51] if thou Wilt let us make three
[51:53] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[51:56] and one for Elias now this is what I
[51:58] want to get to verse 5 and while he yet
[52:00] spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed
[52:03] them and a voice out of the cloud which
[52:07] said this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[52:12] well
[52:13] pleased hear ye him
[52:17] amen then I'd like to go to John
[52:24] 13
[52:26] read this every time we have communion
[52:28] foot
[52:36] washing but verse three well I'll just
[52:39] read some far from one now before the
[52:42] Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew
[52:45] that his hour has was
[52:52] come I want to just stop there a minute
[52:54] and go back to chapter 12 and just read
[52:57] something I didn't intend to do this but
[52:58] the Lord laid it my heart
[53:02] here verse
[53:06] 27 let's start with verse 26 If any man
[53:09] serve me let him follow me and where I
[53:12] am there also shall my servant be where
[53:15] I am you'll be if any man serve me let
[53:19] he serve me him will my father honor now
[53:22] my now is my soul troubled and what
[53:25] shall I say father this want to get to
[53:27] Father save me from this hour but for
[53:30] this
[53:31] cause came I unto this
[53:34] hour father glorify thy name then there
[53:38] came a voice from Heaven saying I have
[53:40] both glorified it and will glorify it
[53:45] again all
[53:47] right then I want to go over here to to
[53:50] back to our verse again and supper being
[53:54] ended
[53:56] excuse me I'll back up here Jesus knew
[53:58] that the hour was come that he should
[54:00] depart out of this world into the father
[54:02] having loved his own which were in the
[54:05] world he loved them unto the end and
[54:07] supper being ended the devil now put
[54:09] into heart of judas's scariot Simon's
[54:12] son to betray him Jesus knowing here's
[54:15] what I want to emphasize Jesus
[54:18] knowing that the father had given all
[54:22] things into his hands and that he was
[54:26] come from God and went to
[54:31] God Amen Isaiah
[54:35] 531 very familiar scriptures I believe I
[54:39] believe the word ought to become
[54:40] familiar very familiar to us
[54:44] amen verse one who hath believed our
[54:53] report how Brother David sounds like
[54:55] you're putting yourself back in St John
[54:57] 13:3 I
[54:59] am the bride is
[55:05] there the bride is
[55:07] there let's read that and Jesus knowing
[55:10] that the father had given all things
[55:12] into his hands where were you at this
[55:18] time where were you see and knowing that
[55:20] the father had given all things if I
[55:22] give if he was given all things into his
[55:24] hands what about his
[55:27] bride all right and that he was come
[55:30] from God what about you if he came from
[55:33] God where were you you had to come from
[55:35] God if he came from God you came from
[55:41] God you can't separate that bride from
[55:45] him she is his attribute she is the
[55:49] thinking of himself and that thought of
[55:52] himself was
[55:53] substance amen
[55:56] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[55:59] all things into his hands and that he
[56:00] was come from God and he went to God all
[56:05] right you have no fear
[56:08] bride who hath believed our
[56:11] report our report yes amen and to whom
[56:16] is the arm of the Lord
[56:20] revealed well he that hath an ear let
[56:24] him hear what the spirit
[56:28] saith that's
[56:31] who hears the
[56:33] report all right Revelation
[56:36] 22:17 the spirit and the bride say
[56:42] come the word
[56:45] bride brother brandham said there's
[56:47] another people in the land and he called
[56:50] this people the word bride who under

[57:10] his where is he in
[57:13] her all

[1:00:18] song that my that Tim Tim and I Father
[1:00:23] Dad brother Bob wrote and in that song
[1:00:28] he said that perfect one is not the me

[1:00:39] the real
[1:00:42] me I just want you to chew on
[1:00:47] that that's right I want you to chew on
[1:00:50] this this is
[1:00:52] Victory the perfect one is not the the
[1:00:54] me you see the me you see is David has
[1:00:57] mistakes he's UPS he's fails he does
[1:01:00] this he does that God is not looking at
[1:01:03] any of
[1:01:05] that he's looking through the blood
[1:01:07] which has been has identified you which
[1:01:10] is an effect which is in you living
[1:01:13] right he can't he can't look at through
[1:01:16] the blood and see you imperfect when he
[1:01:19] looks through the blood he sees you
[1:01:21] perfect than you
[1:01:23] Lord

[1:01:51] birth amen it's a spoken word birth
[1:01:55] all right we'll come into that a little
[1:01:57] more as we go along
[1:01:58] here but just keep that in mind but that
[1:02:02] perfect one Within Me is the real me
[1:02:06] it's not the me you see but it's the
[1:02:08] real me that perfect one there's only
[1:02:10] one perfect one that's Jesus Christ but
[1:02:13] he said be ye therefore perfect as your
[1:02:16] father which is in heaven is perfect now
[1:02:18] how you going to be perfect without the
[1:02:20] shedding of his life which you are was
[1:02:23] poured out through through the blood at
[1:02:29] Calvary
[1:02:32] hallelujah amen you don't you don't have
[1:02:35] to well I won't go this I'll just keep
[1:02:37] moving on this
[1:02:39] direction so St John 4 let's read verse
[1:02:43] 5 they are of the world therefore who's
[1:02:47] of the world
[1:02:49] them you have overcome them they are of
[1:02:52] the world therefore speak they of the
[1:02:55] world see they have a voice they have a
[1:02:57] they have a tongue but we speak another
[1:03:03] tongue and the only ones going to hear
[1:03:05] this tongue is those elected of God to
[1:03:08] hear that tongue that were a part of God
[1:03:10] will hear the voice of God for they have
[1:03:12] that ear to
[1:03:14] hear and that faith that they live by
[1:03:16] and who they are comes through the
[1:03:20] word amen by hearing the word all right
[1:03:23] so they are of the world therefore speak
[1:03:26] they of the
[1:03:27] world if you see a person coming around
[1:03:30] here I'm a messy believer praise God I I
[1:03:32] believe God sent a prophet I believe
[1:03:33] this message and still speaking of the
[1:03:36] world and they're not only their word
[1:03:38] speaking they life speaking speaking of
[1:03:41] the world you know they're not of God
[1:03:43] they haven't been born
[1:03:47] again
[1:03:49] Hallelujah they so they are of the world
[1:03:51] therefore speak they of the world and
[1:03:53] the world heareth
[1:03:57] them all right see that's their
[1:04:01] nature all right but you're not that
[1:04:04] nature you are of God verse six you are
[1:04:07] of God he he that knoweth and if you're
[1:04:10] of God who are you right you must be
[1:04:14] himself in measure in this hour
[1:04:17] predestinated this hour to take the
[1:04:19] position in this hour for the word of
[1:04:21] the hour to manifest that word of this
[1:04:23] day of this hour
[1:04:24] what a position what a
[1:04:27] revelation what an unveiling you see
[1:04:30] he's taking the seal off your heart and
[1:04:32] he's unveiled himself in you you
[1:04:35] absolutely are perfect in Christ amen
[1:04:39] you can't be otherwise you're going to
[1:04:41] be there you're going to you're going to
[1:04:43] come to that maturity you're going to
[1:04:44] come to that stature which is Christ
[1:04:47] your stature is Christ amen the what you
[1:04:51] grow up into the statue you grow up into
[1:04:53] is is
[1:04:55] Christ The Headstone it's
[1:04:59] Christ amen and who is that Christ it's
[1:05:03] charity which never fails
[1:05:09] right Lord willing will he time I'm
[1:05:11] going to preach on two kinds of love now
[1:05:13] brother Chris stay away from it I can't
[1:05:16] tell the pastor to because he has a
[1:05:17] right to do
[1:05:22] that but how close are
[1:05:25] they they would deceive the very elect
[1:05:27] if
[1:05:29] possible I'm not saying God's a deceiver
[1:05:32] I'm just saying they're so
[1:05:36] close those two Spirits are so close one
[1:05:39] is human
[1:05:40] love and the other is God
[1:05:44] himself but human Love Never Fails I
[1:05:48] mean human love will fail excuse me
[1:05:51] human love fails because it's not it's
[1:05:54] let's see I'm getting sidetracked here
[1:05:56] but anyway and then I'm not because I'm
[1:05:58] talking about something here that I want
[1:06:00] to come
[1:06:02] to Agape Love Is God himself yes and you
[1:06:06] have to be of God you have to be a part
[1:06:08] of God to have be God
[1:06:10] himself to be that
[1:06:13] love without the new birth you won't you
[1:06:15] don't have that love you can love God
[1:06:18] with an ailio human
[1:06:22] love you bet you
[1:06:25] can amen but unless that word's down in
[1:06:28] there to be quickened in your soul which
[1:06:31] is the true baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:33] you can be anointed and love God from
[1:06:36] your
[1:06:38] spirit that a spirit can be anointed and
[1:06:42] do signs Miracles and wonders cast out
[1:06:45] devils and Only God Can cast out a
[1:06:48] devil you can speak in tongues and have
[1:06:50] the gifts of the Spirit according to 1
[1:06:52] Corinthians 12 but it's not the sign
[1:06:54] that you are the have the indwelling of
[1:06:56] the word in you it is the sign that the
[1:06:59] Holy Ghost is doing those
[1:07:01] things but it's not the sign of the
[1:07:03] individual having that's right the
[1:07:06] person himself in
[1:07:09] them
[1:07:11] amen see how close these anointed ones
[1:07:14] can
[1:07:15] be to the real anointed
[1:07:18] word but they can't stay with the word
[1:07:20] they can't hear and receive the word for
[1:07:22] the hour
[1:07:25] because it's revealed to them that have
[1:07:27] an ear to hear and that's the
[1:07:29] sovereignty of God to reveal to whom he
[1:07:33] will amen you can't figure it out I
[1:07:36] cannot explain to you how that I am in
[1:07:42] Christ so but Christ in
[1:07:46] you he that is in you he that is in you
[1:07:49] is overcome the world he that is in you
[1:07:51] is greater than the world he that is in
[1:07:53] you
[1:07:54] and if he's in you then it's not anymore
[1:07:57] you living it's him living in
[1:08:00] you then you'll speak the words he
[1:08:02] speaks you do the things he
[1:08:05] does and if it even starts to get off
[1:08:08] the track he'll correct
[1:08:11] it amen and you will receive the
[1:08:14] correction of the
[1:08:16] word because that which is in you that c
[1:08:20] Gene that germ of God cannot disbelieve
[1:08:23] the word
[1:08:25] amen they cannot reject the
[1:08:29] word no more than God could reject his
[1:08:32] word because it's God in you made living
[1:08:36] alive in you all
[1:08:38] right so we grow up into him we grow up
[1:08:43] into
[1:08:44] him okay I didn't finish verse six we
[1:08:47] are of God he that knoweth God
[1:08:52] heareth him

[1:09:31] Christ when you're born again it's
[1:09:33] Christ birthed in you and he grows up
[1:09:36] into his
[1:09:37] stature
[1:09:40] amen and The Headstone The Headstone
[1:09:43] message the Capstone message is our
[1:09:45] message it's the opening of those Seven
[1:09:47] Seals
[1:09:49] right which unless they open you
[1:09:51] couldn't have matured right
[1:09:56] into
[1:09:57] him now when you mature into him and
[1:10:00] grow up into him you're you're getting
[1:10:02] ready for the capturing away and the
[1:10:04] meeting in the
[1:10:06] air I wonder what I wonder what Rebecca
[1:10:09] was doing on that Camel that she
[1:10:11] watered on that road to meet her
[1:10:15] bridegroom in the meeting place in the
[1:10:21] air Amen in that divided
[1:10:24] place what was she
[1:10:27] doing she was laying in the presence of
[1:10:31] the
[1:10:32] son she was receiving the message of
[1:10:35] himself her
[1:10:38] bridegroom amen and she got to that
[1:10:41] place where the meeting had to take
[1:10:43] place and she had matured so so he
[1:10:45] brother Brown said he's waiting on his
[1:10:47] bride and maturity so he can come and
[1:10:50] take her and this is an individual
[1:10:53] affair this that we believe is not a
[1:10:55] group Affair it is an individual
[1:10:59] Affair the saving of Israel is a
[1:11:01] national Affair but to us it's
[1:11:03] individual he takes the people out of
[1:11:06] the Gentiles individuals out of the
[1:11:09] Gentiles for his
[1:11:13] bride amen so it's not a church Affair I
[1:11:16] believe in going to church don't get me
[1:11:17] wrong when I say that but it's not a
[1:11:19] group Church Affair it is
[1:11:22] individuals amen they're in the group
[1:11:25] they're part of the group we believe
[1:11:27] that we break bread together because
[1:11:29] we're born again we're breaking bread
[1:11:30] together at this communion table amen
[1:11:33] testifying that we are in communion with
[1:11:36] him and we are one with each other being
[1:11:38] a part of his body being his
[1:11:42] body amen all right

[1:11:55] up because we are
[1:11:57] him all right now we could go to well
[1:12:00] let's go over there Ephesians a
[1:12:02] minute Ephesians
[1:12:15] 4 for the this is what the ministry is
[1:12:18] for verse 12 five-fold Ministry for the
[1:12:20] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:12:23] the the
[1:12:24] ministry for the edifying that tell me
[1:12:27] don't believe in fivefold Ministry they
[1:12:28] might as well just shut their pages of
[1:12:30] their books of the message and go home
[1:12:34] right because we have a Ministry which
[1:12:37] was the word for the season it was in
[1:12:39] the scriptures but it was
[1:12:42] hid it was sealed up our message is the
[1:12:45] opening of those Seven
[1:12:47] Seals amen the prophet of Revelations 10
[1:12:52] and Malachi 4 does two
[1:12:55] things amen he takes those those those
[1:12:58] things that have been lost Through the
[1:13:00] Ages and brings them to Restoration such
[1:13:02] as serpent seed baptism godhead Etc is
[1:13:05] that right then he turns around and then
[1:13:08] he opens up the Mysteries contained in
[1:13:10] those
[1:13:12] seals amen which the seven Thunders
[1:13:14] uttered which is the Revelation
[1:13:16] contained in the
[1:13:17] seals which will literally these things
[1:13:20] will literally turn the hearts of the
[1:13:21] children to the faith of the
[1:13:24] fathers is that right original Faith
[1:13:26] which was what God's Own
[1:13:30] Faith oh man that's right now so he said
[1:13:34] now the work of the ministry till we all
[1:13:36] come in the unity of the
[1:13:40] Faith Unity of the
[1:13:43] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:13:46] God unto a perfect
[1:13:49] man that is not human stature right that
[1:13:53] is
[1:13:59] Christ and the believer the believer is
[1:14:02] the faith of God that moves in you so
[1:14:05] we've come into Unity of the faith of
[1:14:07] the knowledge of the son of Unto unto a
[1:14:10] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:14:11] stature of the the measure of the
[1:14:14] stature of the
[1:14:16] fullness of
[1:14:19] Christ that we henceforth be no more
[1:14:22] here we are
[1:14:25] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:14:28] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:14:31] Slate of men and cunning craftiness
[1:14:34] whereby they lie in weight to deceive
[1:14:37] now we could take some scriptures on
[1:14:39] what Paul said about that couldn't we we
[1:14:40] know that after my departing so Grievous
[1:14:42] wolves come in see all
[1:14:45] right so we expect it it's here it's
[1:14:48] there but that's why we have the message
[1:14:52] through god-given
[1:14:53] gift of God in the ministry to preach it
[1:14:56] to the bride so that those te- cells
[1:14:59] aren't stopped from flowing through the
[1:15:03] body what are they
[1:15:05] for
[1:15:07] cleansing because if they aren't in
[1:15:09] effect if those T cells are in effect
[1:15:12] those B cells which are the which are
[1:15:14] the uh the antibodies will never go into
[1:15:18] effect without the ministering of the
[1:15:21] word as God said it would be
[1:15:25] preached they will this message will
[1:15:27] never be effective to those
[1:15:31] people boy oh boy oh boy sir amen that's
[1:15:35] the truth all right you may not like the
[1:15:38] way I preach it you may not like the way

[1:24:53] and I've just read that great is the
[1:24:55] mystery of godliness for God was
[1:24:56] manifest In the Flesh so we'll buy that
[1:24:58] by test a minute we you and me are the
[1:25:02] word the bride is the word because he
[1:25:05] was the
[1:25:06] word because he is the word he was the
[1:25:09] word First St John 1:1 in the beginning
[1:25:12] was the word the word was with God and
[1:25:13] the Word was God notice he was the word
[1:25:17] that's
[1:25:18] why we are the
[1:25:20] Worden all right
[1:25:23] John 113 said well let's just I'll just
[1:25:26] turn over there I know 114 let me just
[1:25:28] get that John
[1:25:31] 1
[1:25:33] 13 we excuse
[1:25:37] me verse 12 but as many as received him
[1:25:41] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:25:43] of God even to them that believe on his
[1:25:46] name which were
[1:25:49] born not of blood nor of of the will of
[1:25:52] the flesh nor of the will of man but by
[1:25:56] the word
[1:25:57] yes they were born of the word but of
[1:26:00] God Amen and the and is conjunction ties
[1:26:04] with that and great is the mystery of
[1:26:07] godliness for God was manifest In the
[1:26:09] Flesh all right and the Word was made
[1:26:12] flesh and dwelt Among
[1:26:14] Us among
[1:26:16] us
[1:26:20] us us
[1:26:22] the and the and would dwelt among us and
[1:26:25] we behold or beheld his
[1:26:28] glory we beheld they beheld his glory
[1:26:31] now we are beholding his glory and I'm
[1:26:33] not here by chance I'm here because I
[1:26:36] was meant to be here Jesus said I didn't
[1:26:38] come here by chance I've come here
[1:26:40] because I was I was to be
[1:26:42] here at this day you were to be here at
[1:26:45] this
[1:26:46] day I'm going back to St John 12 you can
[1:26:49] read
[1:26:50] it all right I just read it amen now so
[1:26:55] 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:26:57] among us we beheld his glory the glory
[1:26:59] as of the only begotten of the father
[1:27:01] full of grace and truth he will not
[1:27:03] share his glory with another but you and
[1:27:08] I are not another we are him right yes
[1:27:13] amen and the Bible says his glory would
[1:27:16] be on us and would be seen in US amen
[1:27:20] Isaiah 60 verse1
[1:27:23] all right
[1:27:25] now we are who we who excuse me who are
[1:27:29] we we are the spoken word birthed we are
[1:27:33] the spoken word
[1:27:35] birthed bearing his
[1:27:38] name we are not here brother sister to
[1:27:41] Bear our own name you and I are here to
[1:27:45] bear his
[1:27:47] name and this we will do absolutely and
[1:27:51] this is being being
[1:27:53] done but it's so simple people are
[1:27:57] missing his
[1:28:00] presence exactly what it is that's an
[1:28:04] unrecognized presence of God but he's
[1:28:07] here and all Hells against this
[1:28:09] Revelation to you as an
[1:28:12] individual that's
[1:28:14] right he's he's against he's against the
[1:28:17] word he's against you because you're the
[1:28:21] word
[1:28:23] the battle isn't between Satan and the
[1:28:25] flesh the battle is between Satan and
[1:28:27] who you are the battle is between Satan
[1:28:30] and the word of
[1:28:32] God it happens to be in the Warfare on a
[1:28:36] property called the
[1:28:39] Battleground and you have that
[1:28:43] Battleground so be careful what you hear
[1:28:45] and what you're listening to because
[1:28:48] when you conceive in your mind your mind
[1:28:50] either lets in or lets out when you
[1:28:52] conceive it in your mind it'll
[1:28:57] manifest don't let it conceive in
[1:29:00] the in the bedding ground of your
[1:29:04] mind in the womb of your
[1:29:09] mind but thank God for the power of the
[1:29:11] Holy Ghost In You Amen to protect that
[1:29:14] mind and awaken you when the enemy comes
[1:29:17] around remember what brother Bram said I
[1:29:18] was just quoting at brother tonight
[1:29:21] brother Bram said can I
[1:29:23] overcome he said it's to know the devil
[1:29:26] he said is to know the devil in every
[1:29:28] one of his tricks right now how when we
[1:29:32] grow up we should be knowing the devil
[1:29:34] in his tricks is that right then to know
[1:29:37] the devil and every one of his tricks
[1:29:39] and he said that he that is in you has
[1:29:42] already overcome
[1:29:46] him now so where is the word of God nigh
[1:29:49] thee it's even in thy mouth what is that
[1:29:52] word it's the word of
[1:29:55] faith you say confess but if you don't
[1:29:57] believe what you're confessing it's not
[1:29:59] to do you no good right you've got to
[1:30:02] believe from your heart what you're
[1:30:07] saying
[1:30:10] amen that's true confession because he
[1:30:14] is the high priest of your
[1:30:17] confession Jesus could do nothing until
[1:30:19] it was revealed to him amen and the
[1:30:22] Revelation is
[1:30:26] Faith so we have so the Bible says hold
[1:30:29] fast the
[1:30:31] confession of our your faith and it's
[1:30:35] your faith our faith that the world is
[1:30:38] overcome
[1:30:40] by what is it that overcometh the world
[1:30:43] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:30:45] world even our
[1:30:47] Revelation
[1:30:50] faith
[1:30:52] amen amen amen all right
[1:30:56] now
[1:30:58] so you are bearing his son it's a
[1:31:02] spiritual
[1:31:04] seed the promised seed
[1:31:08] son the bride is in an a spiritual union
[1:31:11] with her
[1:31:14] husband brother branam said bearing an
[1:31:17] eternal
[1:31:18] son did you know he said that go back to
[1:31:22] the mystery of God revealed this is not
[1:31:24] the Eternal
[1:31:26] son but that word in me that's going to
[1:31:29] that has a body waiting
[1:31:32] is that body waiting is an eternal
[1:31:39] son that's right and what makes me a son
[1:31:42] here is because the indwelling of his
[1:31:44] holy spirit in me this is the mask that
[1:31:47] masked him yes and when we talk about
[1:31:50] hear ye him he's not talking about hear
[1:31:53] ye
[1:31:54] David he's just the mask he amorph is in
[1:31:57] The Mask it's hear ye him speaking
[1:31:59] through that
[1:32:02] mask and today he is mask in the bride
[1:32:09] form
[1:32:11] amen what is this bride form what is he
[1:32:13] doing it's his coming in the bride
[1:32:18] form amen the bride coming of Christ
[1:32:23] Christ coming out of dark
[1:32:25] denominationalism what a resurrection
[1:32:27] this is you're not going to turn back to
[1:32:30] those begal elements you're not turning
[1:32:32] back to that you're going forward in
[1:32:35] step with the word marching out of here
[1:32:38] you are on your way out
[1:32:44] Hallelujah all
[1:32:50] right so you're in a spiritual union
[1:32:54] with your husband and you're no longer
[1:32:56] Twain but
[1:32:59] one that's a direct Prophet statement
[1:33:02] more than one time he said you're no
[1:33:04] more Twain you are
[1:33:07] one because this Union this marriage is
[1:33:12] come
[1:33:16] amen all right and it's the revealing of
[1:33:19] himself in you the son of man revealing
[1:33:22] himself that unite the two
[1:33:26] together amen we're going to a wedding
[1:33:30] supper we have to have that wedding that
[1:33:33] marriage that Union spiritually
[1:33:35] first before we can come together in
[1:33:38] Union physically
[1:33:40] next I'm not talking about don't get in
[1:33:43] your mind what I'm saying wrong I'm
[1:33:46] talking about meeting your loved one
[1:33:48] meeting meeting your bride meeting his
[1:33:50] body meeting the head
[1:33:54] physically and be United because what
[1:33:57] you had in this reality of Revelation
[1:34:00] has to fully come to
[1:34:03] manifestation is that right but to you
[1:34:06] it's just as real as I am standing here

[1:43:46] himself opening himself coming to
[1:43:49] himself
[1:43:51] you are
[1:43:52] himself you are the very interpretation
[1:43:55] of the word you are written
[1:44:00] Epistles read of all men
[1:44:03] yes but by one Spirit through baptism of
[1:44:06] the Holy Ghost by one Spirit we're all
[1:44:08] baptized into one

[1:45:22] bread there's no denominational mixture
[1:45:26] in it
[1:45:31] anywhere my house my children born of my
[1:45:35] genes there you are amen glory to God my
[1:45:39] jeans are in
[1:45:42] them how much more perfect can you have
[1:45:47] it you say Brother David do you believe
[1:45:49] that more than I believe I'm standing
[1:45:52] here I believe that with all my heart
[1:45:55] you are the Gen you are his
[1:45:58] genes he's standing right here behind
[1:46:01] skin he's right here tonight he's in our
[1:46:04] midst
[1:46:05] amen amen amen it isn't just it's it's
[1:46:10] not a a
[1:46:11] mental if it is that's fine but I'm
[1:46:14] saying Let It Drop into the
[1:46:16] heart it's a
[1:46:18] revelation to her it's a
[1:46:22] Revelation my all right now said my
[1:46:27] children my house my children born of my
[1:46:29] genes my genes are in them I put my word
[1:46:32] in them I'll write
[1:46:37] them see when God has given you the new
[1:46:40] the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then
[1:46:42] the life of Jesus Christ is within you
[1:46:45] it's the new birth you're sealed into
[1:46:47] the kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit
[1:46:50] and there can't be a true bapt you know
[1:46:52] brother Brown made that differentiation
[1:46:53] between true baptism and baptism the
[1:46:56] true is that it fell upon the word the
[1:46:59] water of the word fell upon the word and
[1:47:03] quickened that word to life that's why
[1:47:05] right now our headship is a
[1:47:08] kingdom and the kingdom of God is within
[1:47:11] you and it orders you and it directs you
[1:47:14] and and if you'll let it it'll lead you
[1:47:16] and guide you contrary to your thinking
[1:47:18] your carnal thinking it'll drive you
[1:47:20] contrary to your mental feelings and
[1:47:22] your sensible feelings and senses and
[1:47:25] reasoning it'll guide you but it'll
[1:47:27] guide you
[1:47:29] perfectly and he's always on time yes
[1:47:33] and he's never
[1:47:34] late he's always right and your way is
[1:47:37] made perfect because you're in the
[1:47:39] perfect one that is a perfect in all he
[1:47:42] does
[1:47:47] hallelujah all
[1:47:49] right
[1:47:54] it quickens that seed and when that seed
[1:47:57] is quickened it's a new creation it's
[1:47:59] meeting God face to face if you want to
[1:48:03] see that go to 2 Corinthians 3:18 and go
[1:48:07] to 2 Corinthians 46 not yeah
[1:48:11] six and write the next verse said we
[1:48:13] have this treasure in Earth and vessels
[1:48:15] yes because when Christ God opens up and
[1:48:19] lights that within your heart you're
[1:48:20] meeting Christ Jesus himself face to
[1:48:23] face and that new birth is that
[1:48:24] revelation of
[1:48:26] himself amen amen amen my my my we use
[1:48:31] great plainness of speech brother Paul
[1:48:34] we just use great plainness of
[1:48:37] speech people don't like it so plain but
[1:48:39] we use great plainness all right
[1:48:49] now
[1:48:51] can I just take about just a few more
[1:48:53] minutes I I didn't hear an amen so I'll
[1:48:57] take it
[1:48:58] anyway
[1:49:01] okay upon I'll write it upon the tables
[1:49:04] of their heart that's my
[1:49:06] family the family of the body of Jesus
[1:49:09] Christ is the family and I'll write this
[1:49:12] upon the tables of their heart your
[1:49:14] written Epistles
[1:49:18] okay the thoughts of the Christian today
[1:49:21] are his thoughts before the foundation
[1:49:24] of the world he thought of
[1:49:27] you amen his thoughts is the Christian
[1:49:31] of
[1:49:32] today now watch I'm coming up to
[1:49:35] something and I don't want to leave this
[1:49:38] watch his sinless nature expressed God's
[1:49:42] word make no mistake his sinless nature
[1:49:46] expressed God's word oh but Brother
[1:49:49] David I don't have a sin sin this nature
[1:49:50] I
[1:49:51] do
[1:49:53] am I also have a carnal
[1:49:56] nature dwelling in this body but I don't
[1:50:00] pay attention to the carnal nature
[1:50:02] though it wants to pay attention and
[1:50:03] wants to speak to me and every time I do
[1:50:05] good it's against me and that old carnal
[1:50:08] man is enity that carnal thinking is
[1:50:11] enity and it's an enemy to me and it's
[1:50:13] wicked it'll say all kinds of things
[1:50:15] it'll look very reasonable and Satan
[1:50:17] loves to use that to get you off thead
[1:50:20] revelation of who you
[1:50:21] are and get you to pay attention to
[1:50:23] something you're
[1:50:26] not well God's going to judge you by
[1:50:28] this and that no he won't because he's
[1:50:30] already judged me he's already found me
[1:50:32] me perfect he's already cases dismissed
[1:50:34] he's already opened the book and I'm
[1:50:36] judged perfect in Christ now I'm coming
[1:50:38] to that I'm going to bypass some things
[1:50:40] here but I want to make some points
[1:50:42] right here now
[1:50:45] watch the only way that you'll ever be
[1:50:48] able to express God's word that you
[1:50:50] believe it and watch it act behind you
[1:50:52] you will have to have that sinless
[1:50:56] nature that come from that come from God
[1:50:59] before the foundation of the world you
[1:51:01] was recognized with him before the world
[1:51:04] before the before the word can ever
[1:51:07] express you were recognized with him
[1:51:09] before the foundation world before the
[1:51:11] word can ever express itself through you
[1:51:13] it takes a sinless nature to do
[1:51:18] that amen so you see if it was God's
[1:51:22] thoughts so see if he was if he was in
[1:51:26] God's thoughts when he come to the world
[1:51:28] he come in God's thoughts at the
[1:51:30] beginning to display his attribute do
[1:51:32] you follow me amen then Jesus came to
[1:51:35] break the clouds back so the attributes
[1:51:38] you and I could display itself amen
[1:51:41] that's it he is God's expressed word now
[1:51:44] nothing else could be manifest
[1:51:48] manifesting
[1:51:50] pretty straight all right so you have to
[1:51:53] be born
[1:51:55] again Christ has to be in you living all
[1:51:59] right now now watch this and I'm going
[1:52:01] to go from here and I got to bypass a
[1:52:03] lot of things but I'm just if you are a
[1:52:06] son of God and I'm a Son of God or a
[1:52:08] daughter of God we were in God at the
[1:52:11] beginning and when Jesus came became the
[1:52:14] fullness of the word then we were in him
[1:52:19] him
[1:52:21] germ
[1:52:25] form that says a multitude of
[1:52:28] things that settles you right there in
[1:52:31] your
[1:52:32] position in germ form you were in him in
[1:52:35] germ form the germ is in the
[1:52:39] male that germ is in the
[1:52:42] blood there you
[1:52:48] were all all right when he was crucified
[1:52:52] we was crucified in his body when he
[1:52:54] rose from the dead we rose with
[1:52:57] him
[1:53:04] am and now since we have recognized it
[1:53:07] been
[1:53:09] awakened now since we have recognized it
[1:53:12] now we set together with him in Heavenly
[1:53:14] places in Christ Jesus in Heavenly
[1:53:17] places in Christ Jesus Satan can can not
[1:53:20] get you out of
[1:53:24] there you're sealed in
[1:53:27] him and he's already defeated Christ
[1:53:30] already conquered him therefore you are
[1:53:34] more than a
[1:53:36] conqueror all
[1:53:40] right all right now if we are Sons and
[1:53:43] Daughters of God we are God's children
[1:53:45] then we are attributes of God God
[1:53:48] eternal life and God is the only eternal
[1:53:50] life there is and we were ending from
[1:53:52] the beginning and when Jesus became all
[1:53:53] that word then we were a part of him
[1:53:56] then there you are then you've already
[1:53:59] been received you've already been
[1:54:00] accepted in
[1:54:02] him now who's going to take you out of
[1:54:05] him there isn't enough mistakes there
[1:54:07] isn't enough failures there isn't enough
[1:54:09] of anything that could remove me or take
[1:54:11] me from
[1:54:12] him but do I want to do that
[1:54:16] no if you have the desire in you to do
[1:54:19] that where's
[1:54:21] Christ
[1:54:23] see all
[1:54:25] right I'm talking about the desire of
[1:54:28] the Soul not the desire of this outside
[1:54:30] man he has all kinds of
[1:54:32] desires but I'm talking about the desire
[1:54:35] of this C Gene this germ that was in him
[1:54:37] when he died you were in him then and
[1:54:40] you've come to life because the water of
[1:54:41] the Holy Spirit has has injected that
[1:54:44] into pre-prepared ground and you're
[1:54:48] birthed
[1:54:51] and what are you birthed you're the word
[1:54:53] birth you're that life and because that
[1:54:56] life's in you makes you a
[1:55:01] son amen makes Jesus the man the son
[1:55:06] makes David the son makes you the son
[1:55:09] but it's not without his life in you
[1:55:11] it's just not saying I am it's revealed
[1:55:13] that you
[1:55:15] are this new birth is not I hope I'm
[1:55:18] born again this new birth is not an
[1:55:20] emotion this new birth is a genuine
[1:55:22] direct revelation of Jesus Christ in
[1:55:29] you it's the word opened in
[1:55:34] you amen all right now I'm going to
[1:55:37] bypass some things
[1:55:42] [Music]
[1:55:47] now the leoan church naked blind
[1:55:50] miserable don't even know it it's that
[1:55:53] anointed it's that anointed what's
[1:55:56] anointed that church age that blind
[1:55:58] naked they're anointed Anointed with the
[1:55:59] real spirit that Holy Spirit can fall
[1:56:02] upon a man in his Spirit but his soul is
[1:56:06] his
[1:56:09] germ what's the real gift I preach that
[1:56:12] when you all were
[1:56:14] Camp okay when the rest of you were Camp
[1:56:18] I had seven people here
[1:56:20] we had seven excuse me I didn't we he he
[1:56:22] did but the real gift is your soul down
[1:56:26] in
[1:56:28] there there you are that was born of God
[1:56:31] that controls the whole thing to the
[1:56:33] word of God and the will of God and
[1:56:35] there you grow up you're a son and
[1:56:38] daughter of God you're a child of God
[1:56:41] all
[1:56:42] right Christ has got a perfect
[1:56:45] body all
[1:56:48] right
[1:56:51] I was identified with him so now watch
[1:56:54] his his your soul is his germ The Germ
[1:56:57] is the word and I don't care how much
[1:56:59] you preach how well you do this and how
[1:57:01] well you love that's one of the inlets
[1:57:03] to the spirit little s you can't love
[1:57:05] you can't love with your body you love
[1:57:07] with your spirit that's one of the
[1:57:09] inlets that's not Holy Spirit that's
[1:57:11] little Spirit that's one of the inlets
[1:57:14] to the spirit you you can't love excuse
[1:57:18] me I'm sorry that's one of the lets and
[1:57:20] you can't you can love and even love God
[1:57:22] and still not be right you can cast out
[1:57:25] devils and preach and do the things
[1:57:27] these things still not be right and we
[1:57:29] believe in casting out Devils we believe
[1:57:31] in shouting I'm not against those things
[1:57:36] right you ought to see me when I get
[1:57:38] pretty
[1:57:40] excited I believe in say I believe in
[1:57:43] that I believe that I have nothing about
[1:57:45] that but that's the evidence I got the
[1:57:47] Holy
[1:57:48] Ghost it's the Holy Ghost responding I
[1:57:51] believe that but it sure isn't my
[1:57:54] evidence my evidence is this
[1:57:56] germ that's become alive in
[1:57:59] me and is continuing to become alive the
[1:58:02] word coming on word coming on word
[1:58:05] coming on word growing what's growing
[1:58:09] he's growing what's growing the birth
[1:58:11] word is growing am and it's taking over
[1:58:15] this body of clay it's taking over the
[1:58:17] ground you know that as a farmer you
[1:58:20] watch you plant that seed and see if
[1:58:22] that seed don't take over the
[1:58:24] ground that ground will crack open and
[1:58:26] open up and that thing will press this
[1:58:28] way right out amen is that right Little
[1:58:30] Lily from the bottom of the pond takes
[1:58:34] possession you can't keep that I don't
[1:58:36] care if you put it under a slab of
[1:58:37] cement where's the most grass out here
[1:58:39] on the end you're not going to cover it
[1:58:43] over it'll take possession of the cement
[1:58:46] the cement didn't conquer
[1:58:48] it
[1:58:50] right amen see it's going to rise anyway
[1:58:55] maybe it caused a deformity there but as
[1:58:58] soon as it gets to set in the sun it'll
[1:58:59] go right
[1:59:01] up that right sure all right now I've
[1:59:05] got a quit really I
[1:59:06] do I was identified with him all that he
[1:59:09] was all that I am he
[1:59:12] was being dead in him we are identified
[1:59:14] with him and what he is I
[1:59:17] am all that he was I am and all that all
[1:59:20] that he was I am and all that I am he
[1:59:22] was yes that's pretty
[1:59:25] clear all right that little germ see you
[1:59:28] don't want to look at the natural you
[1:59:30] want to break into the spirit see where
[1:59:31] you're at see that little
[1:59:36] germ your soul is a germ The Germ is the
[1:59:39] word amen all right
[1:59:41] now and so and the perfect word and
[1:59:45] perfect word is the church will be swed
[1:59:48] and believed in the perfect word and the
[1:59:50] perfect word and perfect the perfect
[1:59:52] word and the perfect word he's the word
[1:59:55] and you're the word will unite together
[1:59:57] in one flesh and one body as a husband
[2:00:00] and
[2:00:03] wife and the prophet said I've that's
[2:00:05] already that word's gone out to do that
[2:00:07] so they are no longer Twain They Are
[2:00:10] One my that well lovely see all right
[2:00:14] now okay now one couple more things and
[2:00:18] I'm done really I
[2:00:20] am that soul is the gene that come from
[2:00:23] God all
[2:00:28] right I just want to get to
[2:00:35] okay oh just a moment here okay I just
[2:00:38] bypassed
[2:00:47] it okay
[2:00:55] he said in invisible Union you never did
[2:00:58] it never sinned in the first place he
[2:01:00] said you never did it because that
[2:01:02] little germ that was in you was to be
[2:01:07] you before the foundation of the world
[2:01:09] God put your name in the Lamb's Book of
[2:01:12] Life do you see how it can be a book
[2:01:14] within a book same book but a book
[2:01:17] within the book a record within the
[2:01:18] record
[2:01:20] the bride
[2:01:21] record you wonder what the Seven Seals
[2:01:24] sealed it sealed the whole book but what
[2:01:26] was it sealing the bride
[2:01:29] record all right now
[2:01:32] now we and in his mind as I preached
[2:01:35] last night you are a germ of the gene of
[2:01:39] God and that real Gene that real germ a
[2:01:42] soul of God was in God before the
[2:01:44] foundation of the world because you
[2:01:46] that's really got the spirit in you
[2:01:48] tonight you were were in here in Christ
[2:01:50] be because he was the fullness of the
[2:01:52] word he was the fullness of the godhead
[2:01:54] bodily then if you were a gene God a
[2:01:57] gene a word an attribute from the
[2:01:59] beginning then you walked with him here
[2:02:01] on Earth you talked with him on Earth
[2:02:02] you suffered with him on Earth you died
[2:02:04] with him at Calvary you Rose again you
[2:02:06] Rose again brother B said already
[2:02:09] risen you're not say I hope I make it he
[2:02:12] said you've already made
[2:02:14] it I wonder if we can swallow that this
[2:02:16] tonight we've already made it
[2:02:21] all
[2:02:22] right you died with him at Calvary you
[2:02:24] Rose with him and now sitting in
[2:02:25] Heavenly
[2:02:27] places with him the word as it feeds
[2:02:30] into your
[2:02:32] soul and that germ that was in you at
[2:02:34] the beginning that germ that was in you
[2:02:36] at the beginning found
[2:02:42] you amen amen amen has it found you
[2:02:47] that's it now I'm
[2:02:54] closing if the seed be planted the water
[2:02:57] will raise it up
[2:02:58] again here's the secret of this the word
[2:03:01] is in the bride as it was in
[2:03:05] Mary Mary's the shock so is
[2:03:11] this amen that word that's in me is no
[2:03:16] part of
[2:03:17] this amen am men but he will raise this
[2:03:20] up because he's laid claim on it by the
[2:03:23] blood are you with
[2:03:25] me okay now the harmony of the father
[2:03:30] and the son was Jesus never never did
[2:03:32] anything until was first showed him by
[2:03:34] the
[2:03:35] father that will be the harmony between
[2:03:38] God and his
[2:03:40] bride and he says the harmony is now to
[2:03:43] exist between the groom and bride he
[2:03:45] shows her his Word of Life she receives
[2:03:47] it she never doubts it there therefore
[2:03:49] nothing can harmmer not even death for
[2:03:51] if the seed be planted the water will
[2:03:53] raise it up again here's the
[2:03:56] secret unveiled

[2:04:30] nature of God he planted there so you
[2:04:33] can go back and pick that
[2:04:37] up see I was born again that little life
[2:04:41] was laying there the life of water was
