Ephesians 5 verse 22. reads as this wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh there this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the husband see that excuse me and the wife see that she reverence her husband children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth and your fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated tonight so Ephesians parallels Joshua how many of you know that okay so if Joshua what was what was the Book of Joshua the Book of Joshua was putting Israel in their position okay and we we talked about last time for those of you who wrote here last Wednesday um we spoke the balanced home part one and because we kind of tried to talk about the man's position but unfortunately it's um kind of bled into other areas and I decided if you've noticed that I'm not going with subtitles I'm going to go with just the title because that gives me room to allow the Holy Spirit to speak because I try too hard to confine things into boxes so Joshua parallels Ephesians so Joshua was all about putting Israel in their position now there's one thing about your position when you hold your position you find strength in that position okay because God has a position for all of us to be in did you know the world has a position they want you to be in today and this is just very uh prevalent for me today because today at work we had what we have once a quarter called illuminate and it's just uh like a they got a bunch of speakers who talk and because the company I work for because their motto is inclusivity and a brighter future for all that's our motto inclusion privilege race all that is very Forefront and and I haven't I don't have an answer but God began to deal with my heart what is our answer to the topic of inclusion because when you hear them preach their gospel because it's their gospel when you hear them preach it it's pretty convincing it sounds good right be nice be kind be good to others but there's an underlying current that indicates now it's obvious for me as a minister but my thought process was on the younger generation or those doesn't have to be younger generation those who are oblivious who because when you when you when you have a social media feed or any other source to the outs to the world and you read that stuff every day whether it be a magazine subscription whatever it would be when you read that stuff you are reading the message of the world so if you're not it so the Baseline that's out there that Baseline is being fed to us and I have witnessed in message culture a deterioration of the Baseline Christ has set for us and we have adopted the Baseline of the world just get on Facebook during election and you will see what I'm talking about and that's just politics I'm not talking about modesty and everything else so we want to be in our position when it comes to to the word of God and that's hard to do sometimes because everything else is fighting against that so we have to be careful because we need the spirit of Christ the Holy Spirit through his word to show us the error by showing us the truth does that make sense so Joshua put the Israel in their position in that book the same thing happens it happens in Ephesians Paul the first church is Messenger now as the first churches messenger he has to set everything in order we have no Baseline until Paul begins to speak God used him he was the messenger in whatever A.D he was a messenger we have no problem reading about his words in the Bible but God bought another messenger at the end of the team time to do the same thing Paul did to bring back what Paul brought and to close it up because through history we forgot all about it okay so Paul his job was to set in order what was to come because nobody knew because look at what when it was left in their hands look what they were doing all you Gentiles you need to be circumcised Paul had to come and speak to her and say hey that's not what the angel of the Lord told me right so Paul had said this notice so what Paul does in Ephesians chapter 5 right here now I believe in exposing spirits through the love and the compassion of Christ and when I read verse 22 most places I can feel the static electricity increase in the building listen all I did was read you a scripture from the Bible oh we love Psalms 23 but don't touch Ephesians 5. when did we decide to split the Bible up when did we decide to say this is good and this is bad and it's because in mets's culture people went too far but that's people are you following a man I'm not I'm not if a man tells me something contrary to the Bible I don't receive it okay so Paul he lays out it's okay it's it's Wednesday night you all can go home and sleep this one off Paul lays out from top to bottom the structure of the family okay right here this is it you you ever wonder what's a family supposed to be like go back to Ephesians 5 22. I know we read it last time but I'm reading it again wives submit tears husbands reverence them respect them husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church why did christ love the church why did the Christ redeem the church that he might present it to himself so you got your eye you got your thoughts on what you want a wife to be and you marry her and then you have a few kids and you have a few years passed present to yourself the wife you want in the wife you have Christ redeemed you do you know do you know why your old man has to die your flesh has to die because that's your first husband and scripturally Christ can never accept you until their first husband passes away because that's scripture so Christ is not an idolater or an adulterer so he's not going to receive you that means one little ounce in your flesh one little thing that's an idea you have that's not according to the word of God I'm not talking about mistakes or or doubts or things you don't have figured out yet I'm talking about that talking a willing a willingness of disobedience Okay so you want to be in your position you can't get into your position until you're married to Christ and you cannot marry Christ you cannot marry Christ until your first husband is dead which is your flesh that's why you have to die to yourself every day of your life and there is an initial an initial crucifixion of the flesh when you get the new birth because you're born again now you're freshly unmarried and your husband has died okay so now you can marry Christ so Christ redeemed him redeemed redeemed us has brought and brought you back to himself because he knew exactly what he wanted so you husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church to present your bride to yourself how you want her and that means total surrender Christ okay children obey your parents fathers don't provoke your children many times incorrection we cross the line and we provoke rebellious behavior in our children because we aren't conducting ourselves properly we're not to control our children you control your child when they're 18 they're gone and that's personal experience I know I'm young baby face take right that was my nickname in Journeyman School okay but I saw it because I grew up with those kids who were controlled reading their Bible was a chore they had to complete in the morning and check off the list guess what as soon as it was up to them to come to church they were gone now the same thing in in in in in Behavior with your children if you force your children now I'm not talking about discipline and correction is not control it's kind of manipulation if you think about it but so is preaching yeah yeah it's a little bit of manipulation lost some of you there quick where's the pastor Okay so well you know what let's just move on if there was a thought hanging there I apologize but I'm gonna move on Titus Chapter 2 Verse 1. turn with me please now we read verse one already touch on it again now you have to remember when Paul when he writes to Titus and he writes to Timothy he's instructing these young men whatever the young man I don't know if Titus was young he's instructing them in the way of the Gospel so these books are a little bit different looking than say Ephesians or Corinthians where he's speaking to a church so he's telling Timothy he's giving Timothy Specific Instructions he's giving Titus Specific Instructions based on the word on how he they should speak so you want to know you want some fundamental principles to conduct your family with right here but speak thou the things which become sound Doctrine that the Aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity and patience in other words teach this to your church Titus teach this to your church to the people you speak to teach this teach the men to be sober the age meant to be sober grave temperate sound and faith in charity in patience the number one thing lacking in men is patience and we snap and as soon as you snap you're not disciplining and correcting in love anymore you're controlling and you're dominating your family and you're going to drive the split of rebellion into the heart of your children which is as the sin of Witchcraft okay so you say oh you know people kids grow up and and they grow up with a message and they do all this crazy stuff and then parents say yeah well I don't know what happened well it was your fault you drove them to that behavior I don't want to do that to my kids and sometimes I do but I'm quick to say a little hug pull in close I'm sorry I shouldn't have spoke to you that way the fundamentals I was addressing still have to be addressed but I did it wrong okay the aged women likewise that they'd be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not given too much wine teachers of good things most of this is pretty self-explanatory I would hope that they may teach the young women to be sober now now now this is aged women now it doesn't say you know there's nothing wrong with making this your verse it's not a bad thing if you're an aged woman sister but this is your calling because because as as as as Elders we're going to use the word elders elders in the gospel as men and women we have a calling to Mentor the young ones coming up so what what do you want what do you want to be your mentorship what do you want it to be I believe we would all say according to the word of God but here's the problem because the voice of the world on these topics is so strong we miss the mark sometimes because we just assume that's how it is does that does that kind of make sense we've been hearing this message of of child raising and and families we've been hearing it more from the world than we have from the church and 80 of the families that I come into contact with do not have a structure that lines up with the scriptures you say but they got Revelations and they go to church that's fine that's good and God will lead them to the truth but we're never going to get out of here until we get the balanced home because the balanced home is us in our positions okay so what are you gonna do what are you going to teach is it mentories if you're a mentor no mentors mentors mentories for your mentoring mentors okay to Mentor the young women the sisters who are mentors to the young women this is what you want to teach them to be sober that doesn't mean not drunk okay we need to be way past that okay one second here I have sober right here okay never mind I don't have sober right there okay so to be sober in other words grave reverent that kind of thing not sad no not sad grave doesn't mean no man man we're sad grave is to be reverent it's the to you know you don't want to be gaudy there's no one could do do we still know what that word means got here we've forgotten in culture today okay flamboyant you don't want to be flamboyant you're not a laughs you're not a streetwalker do you know you can have the spirit of the street of a streetwalker and be dressed modestly your dress your clothes don't say nothing about you but you can wear modest clothes anyways so don't be flirt in other words so be sober to to love their husbands or their husbands to be so so to love their husbands those that sentence there wow is that a big responsibility to teach the young women to love their husbands that is a very big responsibility because guess what news flash love doesn't just happen Love Takes work because to truly love you have to give up a part of yourself so we would teach them to love their husbands to love their children that that natural desire in a girl to mother should be nurtured you know so that's why the favorite job of a teenage girl is to babysit that's perfect nurture that don't start mowing lawns nurture your siblings don't start going and looking for a job when you're a teenager young ladies your your focus your calling in life is to prepare yourself for marriage because let me tell you this the world you see this is what's happened years have gone by and now it's so so normal in the world for girls to have a career it's so so normal right Mom working in the home worth three generations in there's no scripture that says definitive definitively like it does about modesty that a woman shouldn't have a career now we preach to the whole okay but each one has their each there's details that God works out but your focus I'm talking about in high school your focus remember I'm I'm I'm young but my dad talked all the time about when he was young you know it's what Dad's doing when I was a kid right um they used to have home home economics or whatever they call it in school homec right and way back way back when when before my dad was even in school they the the girls that was their class what sewing look when you get married if you don't know how to sew cook clean you have failed because that is your calling it shouldn't be like well you know I'm just not a cooking type I'm sorry are you a man can be chefs huh that's fine right but a woman is a caretaker of whom that is her calling and when you find that calling you find that position you find a balanced home and God loves a balance God loves a balance so you might hit 25 young ladies you might hit 25 be single still then hey maybe you want to look for a job now that's a detail and a Nuance you got to work out with God but your focus as you grow up should be all of those things to prepare yourself because we have no problem talking to young men about you know and especially especially sisters a mad boy better have a job and you're not learning to sow praise God I mean it's not my words it's a scriptures it's a scriptures and the man wants to marry a girl that will cherish him and take care of his home okay I heard uh Eagle Christian churches hiring a new Pat a new minister so if this is my last one to be discreet just keepers at home right that's what we're mentoring them that's what that's what you're growing up and that's your focus that's what your focus should be and as as fathers Lord help us to not get caught in the world's definition of a young woman I'm going to by God's grace if the Lord should tarry my desire let me put this way my desire is that my daughters would grow up having everything taken care of now they they I want them to play their part in the home and do all the things they will do but they if they need a car or they need different things I'm not gonna make them go get a job to pay for it that's what my young men will do my sons you get a job and pay for your car I mean maybe maybe that'll pay half or match or whatever it would be but when at the altar I wanted to be one a transition I want her to transition from taking care of my home and following me to taking care of his home and following him I want the transition to be so smooth all that changes is she's now in a relationship with the man she's married and she's in a different home but I want her to do the same things now he'll have a little bit of flair you know he might like burnt toast right okay so she but she she understands we wouldn't have half the problems we have if we had balanced homes we got distracted we got caught up in in in in in in in Malachi four five and six it was all about brother Branham and all about that and then we forgot about raising our kids nothing against anybody but there is a generational Gap and now we're reaping that problems today with divorce in the message you know what brother Branham said that was now he was talking to Pentecostals and he was talking to the world but it's the same thing that is this the principle is still true today parent delinquents now we talked about last time how how the best example for a bride for a wife the best example is the Lamb's wife so in case you weren't familiar with the scripture and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife in other words she was of a she was of a position where God was ready to show her off now first Timothy 5 14 I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children brother Branham constantly in this in the message he talks about how women have decided kids aren't for them and so they get they get pets you have to understand as a as a minister I have to be so careful that I keep my opinions out okay so I'm leaning into Gods the whole way through this series I need I need him because if I don't come across in love true love which True Love sometimes is corrective if I don't allow God to just use my body use my mouth to speak to you I'm just gonna do the same thing you would do to your children if you're controlling to them I'm going to read rebellion in your hearts so brother man says over and over again in the message you know women should should have children this is a scripture from the Bible now if for some reason you can't have children then this is a promise to you this is a promise if you're you're looking you know young ladies growing up or whoever position you might be in life and you desire a spouse a mate a husband this is a promise if we're not careful we look at this scriptures like this a little bit too on the negative side then this is this is the very heart of God this is the very deepest spot of him because look what he did so he could have a bride look what he did he died he suffered and and men brothers and sisters when you don't hold your position in the home you know what you're doing to the crucifixion of Christ you are spitting on it we have no problems with accepting the seals are opened and we'll go home and yell at our wives don't let that doctrine of the scriptures anything I like I said I use the seals because that's like the Pinnacle right whatever it's it is because that's Christ revealed to us and then we can get married to God Christ and then we're getting out of here at some point we'll get excited about about about preaching against against sin and we'll get excited about altar calls let me get it from the altar let me go home and what are we doing bear children guide the house guide the house and then this is cinches it right here give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully do you know why the Bible says abstain from the very appearance of evil it's so you give no one room to point fingers and say I thought you were a Christian because they will do it and then what is your answer going to be or the Devil comes in and he and he he gets in as you're trying to pray and he begins to bring these things up as you're trying to pray then you have no freedom in prayer I know of an individual who for years has denied scripture in the Bible and you see that individual struggle with patience aggression because there's something eating at them on the inside I myself walk through that for space of time that thing you knew you know you have to make it right but you don't do it and it eats you up inside you're aggressive you're rude those aren't fruits of the spirit but as soon as you walk according to the scripture you find all of these things fall in line into your home you find peace in your house you never knew existed suddenly the the chill you know children will act up when there's unrest say man goodness why is that why are they such a bad attitude because they're nervous because you're always upset or you're too rough or or there's tension in the home that'll make your kids throw rocks through windows and do things you're just like what were you thinking well it's your fault today to be able to actually have one of the talks actually enjoy it and then glean good things from it and it was by who I've mentioned over the public before Jocko willing uh seven uh Seven Seals a Navy SEAL um and I forgot what I was going to say oh his Fame really started when he wrote the book extreme ownership and it's all for leaders and that is that you are the ultimate responsible one for everything that happens in your home okay in this quote here from the serpent seed it won't and a woman is just a part of a man a byproduct a woman was not in the original creation God had done quit creating for years and years and years until he made the woman out of a rib out of his side the reason the reason in culture today women fight so hard to compete with men is because in doing so they're directly denying scripture you wanna know what the devil's up to look at the opposite of scripture read a scripture what's the opposite of that the devil's gonna be right in there listen there was no woman without man boy that statement right there would get me fired tomorrow but that's the truth and that doesn't that that's not to say well anyways Adam had done named all creation everything else but he wasn't nothing for himself now see so he made him a help mate took a rib from his side closed up the gash and made a help mate to him and man in his Spirit was both man and woman now you can go read this directly in the scriptures in Genesis it says that God had Adam name the animals Adam named the animals and it says Adam was still alone so then God caused a degree date great sleep to come upon him and then he performed this surgery so this isn't uh brother branham's words this is straight from the scripture so you don't have woman without man you can't now the thing is though Adam was all alone Adam couldn't be his best without the woman you see see how this works if you take things like this you say Well Woman you mean nothing without me right I mean you see young guys take this this this ideology and you're like bro you're gonna be 35 before you ever find a wife because they think they're God's gift to mankind now I want to look at something here because the thing about it is is what I what I love to do what any one of us should love to do is go right back to the word right back to the word like I said there's ideas there's voices in the world today there's voices there's message culture there's voices in message culture there's preachers who preach Who Don't Preach it right who you know there's those of us who just live whatever we want and go to church and we're just message culture but the word of God never fails and if if it's truly the word of God the devil will never challenge it directly he's too scared to because if he does challenge the word of God directly he will expose himself and the worst thing that the devil wants is to expose himself he wants people to think they're they're good with God without knowing they're following the devil so um in the godhead we have this uh controversial uh subject the trinity father son Holy Spirit and which one to take a minute to look at this because if you take the scriptures and and you can take anything in the scriptures and you can use it and God can show you through it how to find your balance in the home because it's God's word so how does God take care of his family perfect example of how to take care of yours right because we want to model Our Lives after Christ so why the Trinity why did that Doctrine come up because with the doctrine of the Trinity you're remove Christ as your headship that's why it started way back in the first stage you remove Christ as your headship brother Branham is not my headship Christ is my headship for the BAM disagrees with the word I disagree with brother Brown and any errors that he made in this in the message that were disagreeable with the word for example that love is the type of the Holy Spirit God allowed him to correct him but look at how controversial the ministry of Jesus was to the Pharisees and the Sadducees the Pharisees and the Sadducees were the message of the first stage or whatever not the first stage before first stage the message the the the the the Christian world the message excuse me Christian world is the Pharisees in the statutes you see it's so easy for us to read in the Bible and accept it because it's the Bible but the Bible prophesies and speaks of things outside of its book but never contradicts with this book so and I also haven't found anything that gives me the freedom and the Liberty in my life so the Trinity what that was free I don't know where that came from so the trinity if you if you follow this you deny Christ at your headship I mean who are you supposed to follow the father or the son or is it the Holy Spirit you know I worked a job one time with my I worked we're building an addition on my on my dad's house I was like 1450 and I had my my grandpa Papa Tom and I had my dad and they were both in charge and I will go on an errand for him her papa and Dad would say what are you doing go over there and do this I'm like well just go there so I go to that and then he my grandpa's downstairs like what are you doing I told you to do this who do you want me to leave who do you want me to follow who's in charge okay okay here's uh you work with Papa I'll work with this guy over here right I needed one head if you follow the Trinity you got three guess what you can pick and choose how are you feeling today are you feeling Holy Spirit are you feeling father are you feeling the Sun what are you what are you feeling today right as soon as one offends you you jump to the other one there's no there's no headship there is though because if you're not under the headship of Christ you're in the headship of the devil plain and simple okay so that's why I brought in the Trinity and why it's so important why why it's such a a big deal because if you're if you follow after the Trinity if you follow after father's Unholy spirit I mean this is Elementary folks okay but you fall after that you're gonna miss in a mile high because you don't have Christ as your headship book he says now I am not trying to build a Doctrine Upon A Dream nor am I trying to vindicate any adoption I stand for by a dream Oneness of the godhead is all the way from Genesis 1 verse 1 to Revelations 22 verse 21. I love that quote right there just okay but the people have been blinded by an unscriptual dogma of a trinity and that Dogma is so universally accepted that they tried to see a one God person is all but impossible if people can't see the truth of the godhead but fight it they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the Revelation is Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the midst of the church for The Seven Ages did you get that now I am sure you understand in other words it's a big deal and you the the the the the the the the Direction I want to take with that is that if you don't have one headship you're going to be all confused the devil loves to knock headship because as soon as he knocks scriptural headshot he's in control now we're going to read a story about a man who got out of headship but I wanted to I wanted to to point this out tonight humility unlocks true submission obedience surrender meekness go get your thesaurus when you get home yes sir whatever submission is interchangeable with obedience surrender meekness oh we all want to be meek but don't tell me what to do it's not me it's the word of God so take it up with Christ sorry first Samuel 15 verse 17 to 26. in Samuel segment that was little in thine own sight Samuel's speaking to Saul okay Saul went to fight the amalekites and didn't do what God told him to do obedience now okay he didn't obey God God said go kill the amalekites every single one don't leave one don't even leave a little baby don't even leave an old mother no thing no nobody left Left Alive and kill all the livestock now total surrender you could take that total surrender doing exactly what God wants you to do no matter what Lord help us when that was little and thine own size in other words Saul when you were humble whilst thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord Anointed The King over Israel so God gave this position because you had humility and now you're in that position and you're just doing whatever you want you were humble you were Meek you were sweet to your husband and he married you that's why people like to get married in the world because marriage naturally brings a progression of husbands the boss even in the world I when I was going to journeyman Carpenters school there was a girl there that went with us and um she she was uh she had this boyfriend because it's like it's like a three-year school you go like six weeks every year so we you know be about a week about a year to eight months to a year in between we see see each other and she has his boyfriend for a long quite a few years and she gets married and she's so excited she's writing her last name literally on all of her books and everything and I thought it was hilarious because that's not the kind of girl you thought she would be and um and then the next session rolls around and she's she starts complaining to me and the guys at lunch one day and she's like yeah he wants me to do the laundry and like take care of the cook and everything and I have to understand she was working full-time he was working full-time she's construction I mean she's she's her she's one of those right you know that Galick got her flexing her muscles that was her right and now they're now Christians to the least bit and as soon as they get married that desire for that position just naturally comes out in him and her but she's like I got work and I got all these things to do and and you know we gotta pay our bills and she looks at me because this is the funny thing even though I was baby take and I was one of the youngest guys in class they knew I had I had a reputation to be to be a Christian and then God just does that that's not me that God just does that and so she looks at me for five she says what should I do and I had a brilliant moment I said get a smaller house foreign but that's now that's this the world that's just what happens but you see here's the funny thing here's a funny thing about this this whole Dynamics is as soon as uh worldly couple so people like you but worldly whatever couples maybe not you but people like you um as soon as she gets the job all of the excuses for not keeping up on the house tours are valid but hey man how come you haven't mowed the lawn yet it switches all that is is evidence that as a man working a full-time job you gotta have a help mate there's so much to do I had a long weekend you know I worked every day in my long weekend taking care of things at the house and different things anyway I'm gonna leave that there so Samuel's talking to Saul and the Lord sent me on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore wherefore then did is thou not obey the voice of the Lord but let us fly upon the spoil and that is evil in the sight of the Lord sometimes God calls us to do things and we think man say for example give money away or give give a gift think man I could really use this for myself so you give a but God's telling you to do it anytime God leads you to do something do it as fast as possible so Saul's looking at all this spoil thinking man what could we do with this I bet you anything if Saul would have well Samuel tells him Saul if you would have listened God would have sealed Your Kingdom right then and there in other words the tithes and the offerings would have been flowing in after this battle but Saul took matters into his own hands you want your sisters you want your home balanced you want your husband to be a certain way don't take matters into your own hands kill the amalekites and leave nothing breathing in other words destroy the sin destroy the enemy in your life and begin to exuberant exuberantly follow God and you will see the effect it has to have an effect it has to it's scriptural on your family and Saul said to unto Samuel yah I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought a gag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites you see Saul reasoned in his head that agag was different than the amalekites we've reasoned away in message culture we've reasoned away dispositions because here's a problem when the message culture first started to come around look men were like you get in subjection now woman so we course correct it and we went way over there so now you see Holmes and she's in she's the boss they go to church they believe the same thing you do maybe it's even you and we've gone so far the other way she's the boss you'll never have peace in your home you might have you might appease her but you won't have peace in the home sometimes peace in the home comes through great trial because as soon as you decide like I said last week I hope you've started to implement as soon as you decide to change things in your home you have to need to be changed guess what all hell is going to break loose it's easy to give in to the adversary but easy has a cost I've obeyed Laura Samuel I just kept the king but the people the people look it says this is even in the secular world this right here is the first indication of weak leadership when a leader on your team begins to say well hey my team you're in charge you're the boss the people took up the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in gilgal if this excuse won't work for Saul it won't work for you husband if you let your wife rule the house now there's a proper way to restore positions in the home there's a proper way to do it with love and prayer and holding the Bible between you if you're going to have a a moment of intense Fellowship each of you grab a hold of the Bible for hands if this wouldn't work for Saul it won't work for you you get to the white Throne judgment okay forget the white throwing judgment you face God in prayer and something comes after you say well look that's not my fault my kids are misbehaving it didn't work for Saul don't shoot the TV with the shotgun please that's control and we thought that was funny right I say we I was I was like five years old when this stuff was coming out in the message maybe even not even born yet oh yeah you know like what what good did that do anybody we took the TV out and we shot it with the shotgun so you took your you know I I I grew up with kids and and and I and I I wish I would have handled myself differently but there's two different occasions where I found enemy Contraband and my friends cars or bedrooms and like an idiot show their parents should let's let them deal with that and the response both parents responded the same way and neither of their children serve God their response was what is this trash throw it out the window crush it up in Anger what is that is that what God did when you had sin he grabbed you said what's your problem and crushed you no he he went out and died for you he went out and died for you and then he wooed you while you're sinning doing all the things denying him he went out he died for you he said this is the way to get them and then he wooed you come on come here he wooed you know he if you heard I got you your Pepsi here got you little flowers he ruled you little things here and there to indicate God was here or in it wow that just made me feel good and then as you go you find out it's connected to him he didn't take your rocking your own music and break it in your face he led you until you were so convicted in your heart you burned it or threw it away or you took those magazines or you took those websites off your thing your phone or whatever it is and Samuel said hath the Lord has great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams obedience we just had that slide up there we just had that slide up there that showed obedience is the same as submission humility but Saul lost his humility and he lost his position that that Navy SEAL I was mentioning earlier he said the Navy has spent billions of dollars to try to figure out how to to determine somebody's gonna make a good seal and they just they hardly ever get it right people go to that to the boot camp and they fail thousands of them fail to make it through and then they get some out the other side who are worthless he said but so they don't have programs but then the individuals like himself who was a trainer uh trainer for a while whatever coach we're gonna call it he says I can spot a man that's going to be a good seal and is the number one characteristics they all share he said is humility and I thought my goodness what a lesson that could be for us in the house of God when we hold positions maybe it's song leader maybe it's a musician maybe it's in the sound booth if you don't hold humility you create awkward situations when someone has to come and ask you to do something a little bit different the same thing in the home without humility brother your wife comes and tells you in and now she's in her position she's in love you have to receive that I've had to I've had to sit there and go pray and pray and pray and pray and pray because I know she's right but I'm too upset and I have to pray and pray and then before sometimes I'm not done being mad and I say you're right I'm sorry and then I'm not mad anymore sometimes you have to take that step humility that's what God wants you know I can point to you the same thing so be a good soldier a good assistant in the house of God whether whatever position that might be is when someone is has humility and I can come to them and I can talk to them and I can ask them and I have to be humble in my position too so that I can be get feedback or I can be told you should probably do this a little bit differently you should think about doing it this way here is what it says in the message here's what it says in the word if I'm humble then I find growth in the word of God as soon as you lose your humility you Flatline as a Christian and you will you might gain knowledge of this of the message you might gave knowledge of the Bible but you'll go Flatline all it can be years and your Flatline oh you might you might be in the message for 40 years and you might have your children all raised up but you back here when you were 25 you flatlined because you lost your humility because you thought you had arrived and now God hadn't been able to do nothing with you guess what you're going to have to be stripped all the way back to this point wouldn't you rather correct it as soon as possible I would by God's grace behold to obey that's why a revelation of Grace is so important because it keeps you humble to hearken than the fat of ram so obedience for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry so when you control your children there's no balance in the home first of all y'all want okay this is a this is indicated of a raised hand if you don't raise your hand I'm going to assume you disagree with me do you want peace in your home oh come on we're gonna have a hand raising exercise next time I can preach the word to you but you have to confess the word in your life you can't say it now in front of the church go home and say in front of the mirror God I want peace in my home though I was I've been really thinking about this concept that the word is here but guess what it does no good unless it's spoken it's creative power comes from it's being spoken that's why God how to create us that's what God had to speak God couldn't just write the Bible and set it there on his coffee table he had to speak let there be light oh he had the thoughts he had the thought of you he had all of that word in within him but he had to speak it to put it into action just start walking around your house let's say for example that that there's there's a contention in your home and you just you know maybe you need to wait when nobody's there because look be wise as serpents and homelessness doves if your husband's not in his position don't go walking by him reading husbands love your wives you might be reading the Bible but you're just causing contention husband's the same thing don't be whipping out Ephesians five you're just taking the word of God and I'm sorry you're disrespecting it when no one's home okay walk through the house and just read you know whatever it is looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us right I mean I don't know whatever the scripture is you need to apply to your home the word the reason it's a it has its effective because you read it now when you read it it's being spoken right whether it's okay you're consuming it you're hearing it okay is speaking the word of God puts it into action so because thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King now once you're sealed and you're got the Holy Ghost got the new birth you're a son of God you can't nothing can change that but if you want to be king of your home you have to accept the word of God and until you start to accept and apply that word to your home I'm sorry you're not the king of the home Brothers you want that position in your home you want to be the king start applying the word to your life and to your home devotions lovingly talking to your wife about things you want to be king of your home don't do it solved it Follow The Obedience to the word of God be in submission which goes directly back to the scripture where it says the man submits to Christ right Ephesians 5. okay so Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the command of the Lord oh I'm sorry but it was too late don't let it be too late like I said you sealed the Holy Ghost maybe but you don't want to you don't want it to be too late for your family until they're all broken apart and you're sorry I know Brothers good men good men in well-aged humble servants of God who didn't keep the balance in their home and yeah they're serving God yes they've repented but they've left in their wake of family who is messed up I don't want that to be the testimony of the Saints of Grace Tabernacle let's apply the word in our lives let's apply this to our homes let's get balanced home so that when people come we have we have or we have the right representation of God of Christ in our church and in our families because smart people don't just look at how you are in church smart people watch you at home and they say oh he won't you don't want them to you don't want reproach brought upon you want them to say wow that's a family that serves God and thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice the Bible never says the people didn't speak to Saul so we can just ex we just say well we'll just we always say well people should have shouldn't have you know made that excuse but have we stopped to realize that maybe the people were complaining sometimes your family complains sometimes your wife complains but you have to stay in love and compassion honey we are applying the word to our home in love and compassion don't throw the high heels out the front door in love and compassion I'm controlling Don't force them to do anything in love and compassion lead them to truth by following it yourself okay now therefore I pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord Samuel said unto Saul I will not return with thee for thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord hath rejected thee from being King over Israel Saul had a choice we all have a choice a couple of things first God doesn't want robots second God's going to tell you you had a choice you had a choice how did how do you serve God you want God to how ever this applies to everybody this is tonight how do you want God to treat you well that's how you should treat others Sunday school the Golden Rule but then we got out of the Sunday school and we got hip and we got a job and we got cool we got good at volleyball good Spike to go to the camp show up to the girls flirt what's the point if you're if the word's not going to be applied in your life what's the point we want God's word applied in our lives and that means facing our Humanity and looking in the mirror can I tell you something can I be very vulnerable and transparent with you since I started to study this over a week ago we have had some turmoil because God wants me to live it so when I say all this I speak I speak from experience knowing it's hard you know the culture today and you read it and you might disagree with it but you still internalize it and it's a message you hear over and over and over and over and over and over and over again mama just needs more coffee right if you're worldly they say wine okay you all have seen it because I know y'all are online you've seen it mama just needs another cup of coffee it's been a hard day you know adulting is hard okay when was it not right when was it not when I'm tired and I'm worn out and it my family's saying hey are we gonna do devotions now what do I say oh no no I suck it up excuse me that was a bad word to use I pull myself up on my bootstraps and I deal with it I'm not perfect there are some days where I don't I put myself by bootstraps I you have to deal with it life is strenuous the culture if you want to know the opposite if you want to know what God wants do the opposite of mainstream whenever I see stuff go mainstream that seems good at first and when it gets popular I get concerned because I'm thinking what am I missing here because it doesn't get popular it doesn't get popular unless the devil's in favor of it it'll never your video I'm sorry your video of you playing you know burn burn Holy Spirit on the fiddle and never gonna go viral do you see we we had the privilege privilege I don't know if privilege is the right word but we had the privilege of of being introduced not physically but introduced to this influencer who was a young Christian Mom married to her husband and her testimony at the beginning of this was good and she had good advice on how to take care of your home and and how to be you know minimalize all of the junk and different things and so Christian was following her daughter of course it changed our household it was amazing but we had the privilege of privilege is not the right word it's because it's sad of sitting in the seat and watching her progress as she started to get more and more popular and more influenced she started to drift from those values it was a lot more about you know what she started to do go off on weekends by herself because she needed a break so you know what if you're not careful you followed her at the beginning as a woman you get to you say yeah hubby I need to bring why do you need a break from your husband now I understand and once in a while you know the guys got to go hang out with Banya or whatever sisters got to go have their fellowship and whatever they do or whatever okay yeah moments where that's fine it's refreshing right because you just well I'm not going to go into that because I don't know how to get out of it so but you're talking about I needed a weekend away from the fact sister your job is to take care of your kids in your household yeah be just dumping it on your husband if you have to dump the household on your husband consistently there's something wrong you're doing something wrong so anyways we got to watch and now she's left her husband oh we're still okay it's this new topic I wish my wife was here because I can't remember the word I think it's called unmarried they don't say divorced anymore they're unmarried uncoupling people don't get divorced they uncouple foreign s were we were you know we were we we sat in bed together watched a movie and ate popcorn we were sad we were uncoupling and you laugh and you shake your head but young girls in the message are reading that stuff we already did the social media thing I'm not gonna do it tonight but you're you're feeding on that stuff and to you if you haven't been one if you haven't been I'll use her an example because it's also the same I I think I made it nobody it's also the same progression but if you just read that stuff now slowly the devil begins to turn you until you're walking through life as a woman saying I need a break take the kids now there's balance in everything but when it's habitual something's wrong what why because you read it on social media now you may not agree with that but you're feeding on that so you have to feed on the word of God to bring you back into balance okay let's let's move on so there's a Brothers good advice read the song with Solomon just get over yourself and read that book so Jesus what he knocks on our door right he knocks on your heart hey let me in he finds you he knocks on your door but you have to open it now in the Song of Solomon or song of songs that some places call it chapter five says I sleep but my heart waketh this is the voice of the Bride it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh beloved saying open to me my sister my love my Dove my undefiled for my head is filled with Dew and my locks with the drops of the night I have put off my coat how should I put okay so she gets she gets all ready for bed she gets in bed she's already washed brushed her teeth taking care of everything she's laying down she's all cozied in her covers and now he comes knocking and she says well I put off my coat how shall I put it on and I I've already washed my feet and if I get out of bed I have to wash them again and I have to do all this stuff it's too much work so she puts it off and she pushes pushes it off and then she gets up and she runs to the door to open it and she and she's dripping with myrrh and all these things so she's ready to welcome him and and she opens the door open to my beloved but my beloved head withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spake I sought him but I could not find him I called him but he gave no answer he didn't come when he called for her so he moved on now she goes and she searches and she gets in trouble for being whatever down the work down the line and she finds him again but he knocked now here's I I just pray that God would just tie this beautifully together because it's it's very difficult to make the transition of Your Leader as a man your wife is a follower and when you're in your position she's in her position but she has a part to play that connection there is something that I want to to nail down and then we'll close and that's true Christ can knock but you are the only one that can open the door you can say come in Christ I welcome you still he can't get in until you unlock the door then you you can come in so Christ comes to the door and he knocks but you have to get up and let him in you get to say come in Christ I welcome you no you have to go and open the door he's talking about that painting where there's no handle on the outside you have to go open the door you want balancing your home sisters your husband begins to knock you have to give him his head when you said I do at the altar you laid no we don't do the veil on the shoulder anymore but symbolically you gave in to his headship what's the devil going to do with the rest of your life fight that so you have to constantly give your head give him your will give him your desires give him your heart yes he has to be a leader and he be in his position but you we have a part to play Christ is always in his position we're the ones who sometimes get out of that correct so sometimes things happen in life and we move he's so the man has the whole disposition but you have to give him that gift of headship now in closing here now to all that's let's get away from this interbreeding let's get back to the real original Fruit let's go back to the place where God made us as Sons and Daughters of God to depend on what God Said and don't take the woman's word of hybriding see how the natural and the spiritual is typed you see my vision wrote out here of what it was how the woman would be given a right to vote what has ruined this nation now listen not you Christian women women is the backbone of Any Nation now watch this you break motherhood you broke the nation to begin with you deny motherhood as your calling you're breaking the backbone of your home it has through the history what is American women used to be we went over to Paris to get Fashions now Paris comes over here to get fashion for their vulgar dirty way of living come to us to get fashioned what's happened the devil has stripped our women they take their clothes off each year they're taking a little more off now you won't do this you won't do this but you'll deny the position God has for you in the word and you take bits of your word clothing and you throw it to the side I say well I don't wear bikinis but you won't be in your position you're doing the same thing you're doing the same thing they cut off their hair which God says it's wrong where these little old clothes that the Bible said is an Abomination for God for a man to put on the Garment that protect a woman to put undergarment that pertains to a man and now you can't tell whether they're men this was 1960. now you can't tell whether men are women that's even worse today even worse today especially in the virtual world I'm actually thankful for people who use pronouns on their profiles because I can't tell and I have to message them and address them and I can't tell what they are so I have to say their name instead of Sir or ma'am because I can't tell it's an Abomination for God for a woman to put on okay smoking cigarettes hybrid is Right hybrid they don't even know whether they're man or woman that's right you can hardly tell what sex they belong to by looking at them and listening to them that's true friend now that's the extreme case and you say oh well I don't do that but as soon as you start to operate in the role of your husband or husband you start to operate in the role of your wife you're hybriding you're out of your position and by the position you hold are you the man or the woman now if we shipped away everything I just had a you know black outline a stick figure and the actions I want you to do this I want you to look internally into your family and ask you if you stripped every individual down to just just to draw a stick figure no indications of gender and you mapped out their positions what their roles are day to day who would you say was the man and who would you say was the woman you see we get all self-righteous and we say oh we don't do that bless God but at home we're not in our positions you know this is so so important and the biggest keys to that the biggest keys to restoring this balance in your home Saints it's forgiveness and humility this is our calling and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people she be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues that same Spirit now this is Babylon and the harlots and the mother of the harlots right that's denominations and all of that but this same calling applies to message and people in message culture because God's going to pull a bride from the church why do you think we have message believers who are following Brother random as he's gone and they might as well be cults why do we have that because the message culture the message this what we've what we have created it to being that's not God that's the church the bride comes from the church so guess what you start to apply these principles in the description about a family even in message culture you'll start to be a bit of an odd duck God begins to deal with your heart young man young woman you go out to camps or you go other places to be with youth guess what there's some activities you're going to have to begin to not partake in because God has called you to a higher standard modesty is more than a dress all scripture is given by inspiration of God now this is just in closing this is just a scripture to remind us what all this is about all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in rights instruction did anybody shout tonight is anybody ready to run to the altar tonight it was instruction it was biblical instruction and that is exactly what Paul is telling Timothy here sometimes correction reproof and instruction in righteousness musician's gonna come tonight anything that is God's word is righteousness that the man of God which applies to you sisters as well that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works there's nothing left out when you say all good works and the only all who is good but God right how that how that scripture goes [Music] Sparrow heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus forgive me for keeping everyone a little bit long tonight Lord just felt that that attention was still there Lord I thank you for that Lord Jesus I know these things aren't easy to hear

anointed as directed by your spirit we answer to you God each one of us has to answer to you and we don't say that to put fear but May there just be a love and a desire and a Hearts to realize if we are an error we say oh god I didn't even know it forgive me show me because we love you Lord we love you we want to honor you even even if it means getting up and and making breakfast or even if it

given me a front row seat in the career that you've blessed me with to see that darkness and some days it's crippling more to see just how far Humanity has fallen but God there's a there's a butt
