we want that Veil that that mist to move aside that we could see you greater than we did moments before days before may you do so tonight we ask we love you Lord Jesus we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise the Lord thank you musicians brother Tim amen if you have your Bibles tonight turn with me to Acts chapter one um my apologies to you and the sound guys I didn't know the computer was fixed so I didn't send my quotes till like 10 minutes ago when Gideon texted me so I should have asked because I there's a lot of quotes I would love for you to read along with but I can always post them for you later Acts chapter 1 verse 10 so Jesus has has completed his ministry in this dispensation of him in flesh and now he's transitioning and at the same time his disciples are transitioning verse 9 we'll start there and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by him in white apparel which also said you men of Galilee why stand you gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called olet which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey so I'm guessing that's about a week and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where Abode both Peter and James and John and Andrew Philip Thomas Bartholomew Matthew James the son of alfus Simon Zealot and Judas the brother of James these all continued with one Accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his Brethren chapter 2 verse one and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they're all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noise abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans let's skip down to verse 12 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what mean it this others mocking said these men are full of new wine not completely wrong but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy may the Lord bless your reading of his word you can be seated tonight amen so I'd like to take tonight uh the title emotions position emotions position and I want I just trusting in the Lord to speak to our hearts tonight and you know we can be we can be given a sword and we might get lucky and and make a strike but we fight better when we know how to use a sword so we can't just take the word and say we got the word we got the word we got the word we have to learn how to use the word and God gives us revelation God gives us faith and upon that he builds up the statue of a perfect man and through that we find victory in our lives we overcome we overcome doubts we overcome you know we can't liit o limit overcoming to just sins although CU sin is actually unbelief overcoming is is having is having victory over doubt having overcoming is is is seeing is understanding more of God having more Revelation to live a life that is higher overcoming raises the standard in your life but you can't do so while you're running around like a child we can't take the scripture where it says childlike faith and think we can stay children we have to grow in maturity Amen to become sons of God we are pursuing Perfection look at theour Journey Abraham had to take to get to the place where he could receive the promised son you can't we can't just just take it and run with it we got to know what God's talking about we have to have we have to lay in the word we have to say God teach me brother B says the ministry of an evangelist brings the sinner to Christ and teaching positionally places the church right we are given a five-fold Ministry amen depending on who you talk to depending on who you Fellowship some emphasize one of those fivefold but God given has given all five to bring the church into balance that's right if we just all ran around and it was it was we just had evangelism and evangelism and evangelis evangelism we would never be positionally placed that's right right that is that's a a a thing we need at times in our life we need it when we get saved we need it at different points in our life where sometimes we just need the word to come and and in in that underneath that anointing but it's all all the spirit of God Amen when you preach the word it's all the spirit of God so tonight my desire is is to to to lay out for you if I could and you know had all these this this big tray here like a Sherie board and I could lay out the quotes and the scriptures and the position and allow you to take that home meditate on it pray on it and say this is and you see it not me stand here and tell you I'm I'm really praying the Lord keeps that from from me telling you what to believe that's right but to present to you what the word says which is really our mission statement that's as ministers I really I really like my this is all my this is now my opinion but to present to you what the word says when I when a statement is made that the word would be there to back that up amen Mark chapter 16 so our title tonight is emotions position Mark 16 verse 14- 20 and a afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and abided them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and then they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following did God did Jesus when he ascended into the heaven did he abandon the disciples to their own mental faculties he gave them the word he preached them for however was his ministry about three and a half years he preached to them they didn't understand what they had they didn't know what they had and the angel comes to them and says go t in the room go or go back to Jerusalem and T there and the the same thing that took Jesus up is going to come down into you the spirit of Christ is going to come and then give you utterance give you unction give you leadership so when we say when we say now you know what praise the Lord I'm just going to preach when we say we the the book of Acts written again in our day that is the disciples taking what they learned from God through Revelation and bringing it forth amen Acts 2:38 be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ directly contradicts Matthew baptize them in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost but it was the manifestation of Revelation in their lives from the word so some could have said well you you got to say what Jesus says and they would have gone off but they were saying that's what Jesus said you see where the devil slips in and so we have to we have to be careful we have to we have to be studious we have to we have to commit to prayer what we need God to show us we have to say God your word open your word to me and and that's not enough we then have to open our hearts to God we have to surrender ourselves to God and you know the more I know the excuse me the more I know the more I learn about God the more I greater Revelation I the more overwhelmed I am by how much he is amen there is so much to God because he is eternal and we will never figure it all out in 1963 a paradox so let's step into this thought here tonight emotions position says you thinking you have you thinking you have and having it is two different things that's right you might be able to try to say you have you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is Vindicated what you're professing to have you still haven't got it amen the proper definition of go of you being born again is you bearing the fruits of Christ amen now that's that's overcoming your flesh desires that's that's overcoming your laziness that's overcoming your anger that's overcoming life people say there's something different about you when you are not inspired you are overcoming that is the evidence receiving the word see I just I said as I said a few sentences and I got some puzzled looks I just said with different words but it means the same thing the evidence of the holy spirit is you saying Amen to the word of God for your day and acting upon it that's right you see sometimes we get caught up I don't know why I feel to go this way but I'm just going to step off this way real quick and ride the wave like brother Ron said we I I witnessed an I witnessed something that was quite uh to me was profound and that was that there was there was a certain church and I want to be careful on the details here that received their Pastor to minister to them for several years while some in the congregation said he stopped preaching the word he never verbally and outright denied the message but he stopped preaching the word so some of those men as you should rose up went to him he said well no that's not the way I see it and they departed 5 to 7 years later then the pastor gets up and says I don't accept William brandham I don't accept the message now the people who stayed says okay you can't be the pastor the problem is it was because what it was it was hinging on the fact that this he he is not preaching the word but he didn't say I don't accept the message so their basis their their their walk with this whole thing is is is a is is more of a of a well well he said it this is the line he says it so because he said it because brother brandom said it in the quote I believe it right yeah but that's not why we believe it right we don't believe it because there's a quote for it right we believe it because it's the word amen that's right so if you just take a quote and you go with that you can go anywhere in the world you want with that that's right if you take us just a scripture you can go anywhere in the world you want with that you can have several scriptures several quotes but it was the word so as soon as the man came out and said well I don't accept brother bham and he said those words now they say well we can't receive you and in ministering in ministering you pick that up when you would say something differently now you're still saying the word you're still preaching the word but you word it differently right they would lock up but as soon as you worded it as a message cliche they received it you understand the the the the danger in that where just you're just taking it word by word but you're not taking the life you're not taking you're not taking on Christ amen that is the that's when you have a kid a child you're raising and they obey because you told them to that's fine when they're really small but as they grow up it is your obligation to teach them the moral reason why that's right now as young adults as youth you behave you listen to the law you listen to your parents you do what's right not because someone's waiting there to cast judgment upon you not because the cops are there ready to arrest you but because it's the morally sound thing to do because God Said So Right ex so we had a season where we were children we didn't know what we had I'm talking broad terms because some of these I wasn't even alive yet but there's a part in your journey where that's fine and that's okay but then you have to grow into your position the the Israelites came out of Egypt you're talking about a miraculous move but then it was time to come into their position am that's where many of them failed that's where Judas failed when it was time for him to step into his position he could not receive it because to step into your position is to surrender everything that you have that is yours yeah you can be I and I know I said this already but it helps make the point you can be boyfriend girlfriend relationship with Jesus and that's fun but there's no commitment that's right so you see you see somebody they might be at that point in their journey and they're going they're going to act and they're going to express themselves in a certain way and and sometimes we don't always understand understand what's going on but it's there's comes a season where now it's time to make a commitment that's being born again you make that commitment now it's not that you said okay I make a commitment no go you have the faith God's and God answers that faith in your heart okay we we went off on that now let's come back I don't know what that was there but so he says but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it no matter matter how many emotions how much you jump run Sensations speaking in tongues or shouting or whatever you might lay it upon which is all right I believe in all that too but unless your life copes with your testimony that's right so your life has to match your testimony then you haven't got it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is Jesus said by the fruits you shall know them amen now what we could we could we could take a whole another sermon on what fruits are because if if you're not careful then you start to interpret now I want you to to I want you to understand I'm simply bringing this out and I'm I'm going to sound maybe at some point I'll sound like I'm contradicting myself but I want you to just take it out this is not this is just what the word says just is just it laid out there for you to for you to take home and and and and chew on it and study it out if you're not careful we say the fruits are the emotional expression talking about emotions because emotion has a position in our Christian walk I have quotes right here well I'll get to the some of these quotes but I have but okay there's quotes says if your if your religion doesn't have an emotion you need to bury it so emotion so I this this all came about because I was seeing all these different things and and everything going on and you know what I I know you know you I don't really care about all these other churches and what they want to do this is this is where I live and this is where I go to church and this is where God has called me to minister at yes so this is where I care about so sometimes you can think well why is is a preacher preaching something you know well God knows what we need okay so we cannot throw emotions out the window no so I I saw I saw the overuse of emotions and I saw the underuse of emotion and then I saw in the word where it says this and it says this and God spoke to my heart and said emotion has a position absolutely I didn't know that position God lay that on my heart to minister this tonight if you're not careful then you look at the fruits and you say you say an emotional a positive emotional response to the preacher is the fruits of the Holy Spirit but that is not fruits that's right that is a manifestation because and um man I got ahead of myself that's okay I'm going to catch up with my with these quotes here and in faith 1958 he says now usually experience a company's faith and and that's the reason that usually it takes a person that's acquainted with Christ as the Forgiveness of their sins to know that he has forgiven you you have an experience when you are born again that Christ forgave you and you know it therefore with that experience it's easy then for you to believe God for anything that he promised an experience is is is an event an experience there's no specific way an experience has to happen an experience is you meet God how that transcends into your flesh is based on your personality or lack thereof voice of God in the last days 1963 now I had the privilege of leading 10,000 muhammadans to Christ one time at Durban South Africa it produces nothing but psychology and psychology ready for this hold on to your seats and psychology is all right as long as psychology don't deny the word that's right psychology is is is the way your brain works God created psychology when he created your brain it takes an uncertain sound excuse me but when psychology denies the word then psychology is wrong it gives an uncertain sound there's everything else will pass but God's word Jesus said so heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away so you see we must stay with the word he didn't say stay with the word get rid of psychology he said stay with the word amen it fascinates me to no end how we as as as human beings consume information and make assumptions based on our own experiences that's right I've heard it said money is the root of all evil that's not what the Bible says Bible says the love of money but if you hear if you hear that if you if you have a certain viewpoint on life you have a certain personality that that tends negative you can jump right on that wow money is the root of all evil you see how it happens nobody ever told that person no one ever said money is the root of all evil they said the love of money is the root of all evil but you heard it through your experiences and you said well money is the road of all evil you see what happens no wonder we need God that's we're just a mess on our own that's right see so you must stay with the word Dr Moses 1955 how much psychology that doesn't mean anything I don't say it doesn't mean anything pardon me it helps psychology but it doesn't take the place of reality that's right psychology is something you're thinking of or mentally worked up to so that is a definition of psychology he used psychology on them that is a definition of psychology further defining definition of psychology is the study of your mind and how you think and your social act interactions I I have there's a scripture in the Bible that says God have not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind brother V says in multiple places you can't put all the quotes in there's not enough room in one sermon but B says in multiple places you know as a ministers we cover the high points you go home and consume it deeper he says multiple places that it starts in your mind amen and then goes down to your soul Revelation brings it from here to here that's right so you have to have it in your mind first that's right can't bypass it just don't let it stick there so God works through psychology when he comes and he speaks to you and he speaks a word to you and it comes into your mind that is he is using psychology when the Holy Spirit was anointing the prophet and he spoke he says oh yes I see you have this and this and this and issue there's nothing wrong with you but somebody said something to you and you started believing something in your head so then this is what's manifesting on your flesh every one of those interactions was could be interpreted as a moment in the psychiatrist's office the devil can't create that's right he can only pervert so the psychology of the world has perverted the Clear Vision of the mind that God has in his word amen that's it because where is the greatest battle ever fought in your mind so should you have a weak mind no and if you have a weak mind it's your own fault but we get carried away because by around preaches against psychology there's 43 mentions of the word psychology in the message as far as the table is concerned on the search 403 times most of those are him preaching against psychology because he's dealing directly with the thought that well all of these signs and these wonders and and and the speaking and Discerning is it's just psychology in other words it's just you hypnotizing or just you reading their minds so psychology holds some truth in the confines of the word I'm preparing you because I'm about to read you some scientific things okay so I'm preparing you he says that's right psychology is but okay psychology is something that you're think of thinking of or mentally worked up to but the reality is God placing back in confirmation of your psychology faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen It's actually an Evidence something positive when it's confirmed to you so it's the confirmation of your the reality of God is placing back in confirmation of your psychology Christ is identified in the same in all generations if you don't understand exactly where we are right now just hold on we'll we'll get there now we find in here some think he was a philosopher he was a philosopher there's no doubt about that but he was more than a philosopher talking about Jesus so now a few scientific and psychologist based things on emotions emotions in in our bodies and our thoughts and our mind and everything belief belief regulates emotion so the word of God now that that's from a unbeliever the word of God regulates your emotions what you believe how you identify uh he goes He further he further goes on to say functional identity regulates your emotion so who you identify as what you identify with where where you where you where you you know if you have a if you have the proper balance of of a of of a family that regulates your emotion children who are real small and their parents divorce it wounds them emotionally and so you're like we always say you're a product of your environment now God comes and he helps you overcome that okay he brings that into position in in Forbes they say this talking about emotions says first every feeling begins with an external stimulus whether it's what someone said or a physical event that stimulate stimulus generates an unfelt emotion in the brain so an outside external stimulus somebody says something or there's a physical event the then there's a stimulus that generates an unfelt emotion in the brain which causes the body to produce responsive hormon hormones these hormones enter the bloodstream and create feelings sometimes negative and sometimes positive so emotion is the last thing to come what we call emotion it's the last thing to come there is a outside stimulus an external stimulus from something so to review it's stimuli then emotions then hormones and finally feelings in other words your emotions impact this is what I'm getting down to your emot emotions impact your decisionmaking process by creating certain feelings you cannot make a decision outside of emotions as a human being that's the simplest way to put it according to another expert in the field American Portuguese neuroscientist Dr Antonio deasio the brain constantly needs to update its information on the body's state in order to regulate the many processes that keep it alive and it needs to translate those emotions into actionable feelings in an everchanging environment this is the only way an organism can survive you need your emotions to survive when brother mam said if your religion has no emotion then it's dead I wonder if he knew exactly what he was saying for an organism to survive it must adapt to an everchanging environment through emotion when you get afraid and you run your emotion just saved your life people who don't have a disconnect in their emotions jump off Bridges do crazy things we call them Psychopaths right there's a disconnect in their brain so in order for you you as because you have to remember natural always types the spiritual in order for you to survive as a spirit man as a Son of God you need emotions so what happens now in the flesh when somebody's emotions are uncontrolled we can call them bipolar we can call them psychopath different different manifestations of this but what it is it's an it's an uncontrolled there's there's something wrong with the way their brain has been wired they they are insane okay that's the the the down low harsh term of it because insane means your brain basically your brain isn't functioning properly now there's things to help with that okay if we adapt if we apply that to the flesh when emotions someone's emotions someone's as they would say psyche but that's just your spirit your your your who you are as a person I know you guys are like where is this guy going just hold on a second if you take that and we apply it to the and when someone's walking down the street talking to themsel there's something wrong with them they are not functioning like a normal human being that's on the the the the natural now let's step into the spiritual if your emotion is not in position to the word of God your out of position that's right so does that mean we we we just clamp down on all emotion no absolutely not it means we put emotion in its place that's right as a son and daughter of God you have absolute control because you have the word that's right now if you try to if you try to control your yourself or you or you tried to work something up I wish there was a better word somebody got a Theus if you try to to manufacture think about someone who who fakes a smile it's all over them you can tell they're Faking It how do you know that because you're a human being and you have emotions too and you connect and you see that so when you're Faking It spiritually your emotions out of position I lost my train of thought maybe the Lord wanted Miss to turn a different Corner if you if you get out of the simplest way to put it is if you get out of your positions you try to you try to fake that's what I was talking about faking a smile faking an emotion someone someone who's acting acting an emotion out an actor whatever they're doing when they're acting all that is emotion right they have to they have to learn to manipulate their emotions to match what they're acting for the common for most of us we're convinced for the most part but if if spiritually you you you put so they're putting the emotion first they're not actually feeling what they're acting they're not actually that's not who they are they have they have they have projected something that they are not they put the emotion they put the the God gave us responses in our fa and muscles in our faces and and how we we respond and how we to be genuine but when we project you know what we're doing we're putting emotions before we're putting emotion before the actual experience naturally speaking so when you fake try to fake it you're reaching for the emotion without ever knowing the experience right exactly you're you're you're you're trying to be excited about something you're not actually excited about right so you flip the way you were designed to function that's in the natural now in the spiritual if you reach for the emotion you reach for the response before you get the message that's right you're emotionally unstable yeah that's right so if you reach out and you say I I H I want to act like this you're putting the cart before the horse right but you see where where where the Trap is is emotion is important that's it so we can't get rid of it we can't clamp down on it if if we see our lives and we we're dry we don't reach for emotion we reach for the word amen if if if our church and you look and you say for example I'm not saying this is the truth for example you look around at your church and you say wow it's dry do you reach for better music do you reach for an external stimuli to prop your emotion up to where it should be right or do you reach for the word of God that's it do you reach for the thing you know if I gave you a million bucks you'd be way more excited than if I asked you to fake I gave you a million bucks yeah right but we we want we want that I think you understand what I'm saying we want that emotional expression because because we see in the word David danced the the clothing fire tongues of fire came down they spoke in tongues there was a manifestation many by the way it says many spoke with tongu not all of them doesn't say they all did it says many but if we reach for that that's why Paul said that's why Paul said There came I I'm terrible at reiterating this part that Paul talks about but basically you're reaching for the and you're reaching for these manifestations without the thing that produces them right that's the problem the emotion is not the problem the problem is you reach for that without what actually brings it so your emotion isn't in its position it's out here and it's pulling you along okay but we're human beings an external stimuli external stimuli right produces that that's why right what you listen listen to matters that's right that's why what you feed on matters have you ever watched a movie without any music I'm not going to get on music I'm just saying have you ever watch the movie no because why it brings the emotion of what's Happening that's right if if if if somebody's you know sneaking through the woods hiding from the whatever you know maybe it's a documentary or something I don't know this is always a sketchy place to venture when you're preaching but some something's happening that's that's SC that's scary dangerous they don't play you know oh to Joy they play something to match the experience so that is why music has a place in our worship we have to have it David played the har and what happened an insane Man became sane who didn't even have the spirit of God so there's power in that so emotion has its position in an everchanging environment this is the only way an organism can survive that's right that's Dr deasio and be not AF afraid he says you know there's something about when you go to tell about the goodness of God you get all excited you know emotional someone says I don't believe in emotional religion well you better bury what you've got then that's right so if your religion hasn't got a little emotion in it you better bury the thing that's right and they must the The Old Ship must have been rocking around pretty good when they all got to testifying talking about John begins to testify in the boat while they're going across the sea before the storm and it must have been Andrew then just couldn't hold it any longer said Brethren just a minute we all remember down at saciar that day how he sent us into the city to buy some food and wanted to be left alone over in that country okay sometimes I have extra parts of the quote but I just wanted to get to the point where he says I uh you get all excited you you know emotional someone says I don't believe in emotional Rel religion well you better bury what you've got now he he he's saying your religion should produce that not not you not you going and producing it because it has a position in The Sixth Seal he says Christ stands ready with outstretched arm to receive you in one hour from now that Mercy might not be extended to you you might turn it away for the last time it'll never touch your heart again he's it's down towards the end of the service and the spirit of the Lord is moving he says while you can why don't you do it I know the regular customary way is bring people up to the altar we do that and that's perfectly all right at this time we're such crowded in here right around the altar till I couldn't do that but I'd like to say this in the apostolic day they say as many as believe were baptized see just if you can really down in your heart here is all it is here is all it is it is an emotion though emotion accompanies it you know symbols accompany an orchestra piece that's right but if we just had the symbols nobody would listen right right that's right there is no Beauty in just symbols clinging coincidentally 1 Corinthians 13 says I am but a clinging symbol without Divine love that's right some words you get the cart before the horse you get the emotion before Christ right that's right though emotion accompanies it just like what I said smoking and drinking isn't sin it's the attribute of sin it shows you don't believe see but when you truly believe in your heart you know that on the basis of where you're sitting there you accept it with all your heart something is going to happen right there it's going to happen then you can stand as a witness to it that something happened then you can stand as a witness to it exct sometimes that's jumping up and shouting that's right because something pushed out some you were genuinely excited about something but it it came the stimuli came from the new one all these are drunk on new wine well that's why I said they're kind of right the word of God the new wine second-handed robe Heavenly Father whatever this woman is in need of if Satan has bound her we through the name of Jesus Christ take the initiative and ask for him to leave this woman and be cast out in the name of Jesus Christ amen now go rejoicing being happy lady all right lady now that ought to settle it that ought to settle it that you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ if the bble said you say oh she's emotionally probably if you was healed of the same thing you'd be a little emotional too you see but you can't say you can't what we do is we'll look at that as human as as humans because we're emotional creatures and we say we we we emphasis on the emotion because that's what we see y that's right that's what we see that's it you know somebody you that's why that's why in ads right they play on your emotions that's right if we if that didn't matter to us they wouldn't do that but if they want to sell you a a drug they show the old guy you know it's might be black and white and he's wishes he could play with his grandkid and then and then he takes a drug and he's running with his grandkid why there's a lot of emotions in that one minute ad and we say that we our brains we can't help it our brain say that drug will make me happy like that guy so when we see the healing you see we get the heart before the horse sometimes we think oh we have to act like that that's that's exactly that we want that so we but if we're not careful we go and we get something and we don't act like that then we think we missed it that's right right right you see what I'm saying if you if you play the commercial and you play the and you if you if you play the word as a commercial then now everyone has to act like this cuz they got this and you get this and you don't act like this you go back thinking you didn't get it that makes sense that's right I actually believe because natural always have to spiritual there's a big movement as as kind of interesting situation but that they think hey stop putting perfect people to model clothing you know you're leaving people out you're not being inclusive of different body types okay you understand I don't need to go into details so now you have different body types we would say they just need less calories but they say they're different body types that's right so there's a little bit of Truth there because it's reality so you see that you say oh if I am like that it's going to fit me like that maybe I don't want that right because it's real so if you always promote this this this this manifestation of the emotion if you always promote this you put put emotions out of the position now I already said it I'm not going to repeat myself I'm not going to waste your time so you understand what what I'm saying so he says you'd be a little emotional too if you got healed but you know what sometimes look God completely healed me of all these allergies that I had I never ran I didn't run I didn't run the aisles I was really really happy though really really thankful though so does that mean I missed my healing you see that sometimes when people share testimonies they want you to react the way they did that's it you see we're trying to we're trying to we're trying to get somewhere with something but we're we're getting somewhere with the wrong thing that's right I hope that made sense emotion follows the manifestation of the word these signs shall follow them that believe now when we talk about the signs and we talking speaking in tongues that's a little bit different than the actual emotions but it's a kind of lumped together sometimes but it it it I brought that scripture it in in Mark be in Mark 16 says go into all the world preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe so guess what they're here right in our church and sometimes we miss them God didn't say you will see everyone right he just said they'll be there and you start that's why testimony is so important brother BR says make sure you actually have a testimony so but testimony is very important to testify what God's doing in your life because then you are telling me telling the rest of the brothers and sisters what God did for you we're seeing God In Action that's right you see so it's really important it's really important I I'm reading a book about about about uh just it's called the insanity of God and it's just this guy who's denominational creature uh creature preacher but he's been went all over the world to these places that are are just under uh intense uh religious persecution and he noticed the difference between the church in America and the church for example where I'm at right now in the book in China he said what would people tell if I could stop somebody on the street because they were still underneath you know communist Rule and stuff and persecuted which I think they still are and I could ask them and I could tell Point At You guys and say who are those people what would their response be and the Chinese Believers were instant they said they would say those are the people who raised the dead so God uses that God uses these signs God uses these miracles to testify of his presence that's right to testify of his Blessing but those come so those happen let's say for example those happen and those attract you then you receive the word and you say wow this is that word this is truth because nobody else has this going on so now you take the word now you grow now as you grow up in up unto adoption now you begin to manifest those things but if you jump right off the ship right there and try to go manifest in those things you won't that's right you'll have to fake it you have to grow it it it's something that follows your growth right kind of like you know Jackson and Abe right they want to be big and strong they can't be yet they physically can't be they have to grow their body has to grow so they become teenagers and adults and then now they can begin to Fashion the muscles that we would say is strong so you can't when you're 5 years old spiritually speaking you can't lift 450 lbs spiritually speaking you have to journey to that position you have to Journey there Israel couldn't just walk out of Egypt straight into the promised land they had a journey to make to get there but we want instant we look around we say wow where's all all the Miracles and what do we start to preach we start to preach Miracles that's not what brings the Miracles what brings the Miracles is the word preaching the word because what increases your faith somebody say it hearing amen not hearing about careful we don't want to get off balance Hebrews chapter 6 now don't think wrong that I do not believe in these emotions certainly but what we're on now trying to drill to this people of this day is not emotions so they have their position but they're not the point the devil has has took those things and went wild with the people letting them base their Eternal destination upon an emotion shouting speaking with tongue going to church every Sunday acting like a Christian that won't have one bearing at that day except a man is born again and your life reflects what you are on the inside see not not your emotions so emotions accompany it but you can't use it as the verifier that's right Gideon well he has his license Titus do you have your license you're old enough okay Gideon might be able to drive really really well I don't know drives a dirt bike okay let's say he does he get in my car he could take out down the road just perfectly change lanes put the blinker on everything but he's not verified to drive he needs the proof that's right and that's all that will stand in court that's all that will stand against the Judgment so when the word if you if you're driving around without your license you're manifest manifesting the position of a driver right but when when when when the word when the when the judge when the when when the the law of the of the city which is the the absolute in that thing uh calls to question your position you have no proof that's right the devil calls you to your calls your position to question every day of your life that's right and if you don't have the proof he's got you you can drive like the best driver there is you could even get in a semi shift it drive it everything you want complicated I mean I don't know how many gears they can get up to but I've heard it's a lot you can pull you know Triple Three FedEx right you see those going down the freeway you could be the best of that but if you don't have a CDL if you don't have proof of your position if you're not verified and they call to question you have nothing that's right if you if you express as if you express Express a being a Christian and you don't have the token that's it that's right and the devil calls you to question that's right he's got you dead to rights he says shouting speaking with tongue going to church every Sunday acting like a Christian that won't have one bearing at that day that's right except the man is born again and your life reflects what you are on the inside see not your emotion you could have blood in your hands you could speak with tongues you could heal the sick you could move mountains with your faith you are nothing yet 1 Corinthians 13 see it's got to be something happened by a birth which comes from God and God brings the new birth into you and gives you a part of himself then those things are then those things are that's right you are a new creation I give unto them Eternal we went through the word Eternal for forever is a space of time let me make sure I need to read the rest of this eternity is forever forever and forever but there's only one eternity and we find out that you receive eternal life the word in the Greek is Zoey which means God's life and you re receive part of God's life which makes you a spiritual Son of God you're just as Everlasting as God is Everlasting you have no end no place to stop because you had no place to begin anything has a beginning has an end and that without a beginning has no end so if you're concerned with your emotional position go to the word that's right go back to the word the when you come to church it is not our job it is not our job I have to be careful I'm not going to say it never mind I'm not going to say it there's the reason something this is blind B that's the reason something was fixing to happen that's the reason those things was on his mind that's why you're here tonight your emotions has been stirred you're Bible readers you believe in these things that's what's brought you here tonight that's what makes the people stand outside of the windows looking in that's what makes the people stand in the aisle ways emotions something has third you see it was a response to something stirring that's right so you can't stop right there and say see it's emotion no something stirred your emotions something came inside this external stimuli cave and produced something inside of you that compelled you to go and you say well I just I just felt to go that's why we always say that we can't we we're human beings we're finite right is that the right word night we we we we something compels so we we Des describe it as our feelings but it was something inside of us that pushed us that that that that stirred our emotions we responded to that something has stirred there has to be something to create that emotion just the same as it was then the captain of the host of the Lord just was just inside the wall having dinner with the man we were speaking of this morning zakus after a while he says well I'm not doing very good here so I guess I'll just get up and all at once he hears a noise okay something happening a great racket usually there is a little noise around where Jesus is why because Jesus is there and he's producing the noise you don't bring the noise and then expect Jesus to come Jesus says never mind you understand always bringing it back to the balance emotion doesn't change you those are my words hear his voice 1958 how many of you love him with all your heart all your heart now in these little places here like this I'm I'm just late but the Bible said that we sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Christ Jesus the Holy Spirit comes gets into the word moves down through the audience and you can just watch it when it sweeps over them changing them as I have said I believe in emotions sure see emotion doesn't change you emotions has got to go plum in until it touches the morals of your being that's what changes you what is a sinner an unbeliever there's many a person today with a bachelor of art degree with a doctor's degree with a PhD and lld on their name and still Sinners knows the Bible from Genesis Revelations preaches in the pulpit and still disbelievers marriage of the Lamb people we've got to stand that we must do it it's just got to be done so it's not emotion emotion goes with it of course that's right but the thing of it is is a consecrated heart just take the word of God and say God I did wrong I'm sorry I did that see I told you it was going to sound like I was contradicting you just talked about how you know emotions you got to have emotions and emotions are important now brother saying look it's not emotions cuz emotions had their position can't throw the baby out with bath water so throw get the baby out of the water throw the bath water out so but the thing of it is is a consecrated heart just take the word of God say God I did wrong I'm sorry I did that you know my heart I did wrong right here upon this ground I confess my wrong and from this night hence forth I am engaged to you I'm part of the Bride I'll never do it again he says then you're I'll take you right now at your word then you're getting somewhere amen praise the Lord I believe that we have said what we should say tonight so I'm going to go back go jump to my closing in Proverbs 20 verse 20 25:20 the Bible says as he that taketh away a garment in cold water weather and as vinegar upon nitray or baking soda so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart you're the atmosphere around you affects your emotions yeah that's right our our our own Pastor has made given given me this bit of wisdom that is so true you can be in your study and you've created this atmosphere in your study but that night might not be the atmosphere that the congregation is set into so you come out with that and now it's different so you come and and you you listen you you feel the atmosphere of the congregation and you step into that atmosphere why because it affects your emotion see how God uses everything that he's created us to be in our for our good amen so you so if if you're sad you know it's it's best reflected in children because they're just they just they have no guile they just act and and they're sad and you put on a sad song oh they will go to tears so you're struggling and you're having a hard time so you know you hope it rains you put a slow song on you draw the shades down what are you doing you're creating an atmosphere to make you more sad play a heavy song sing sing a songs to a heavy heart what he's saying look go lift them up yeah right the only point I'm making is that the atmosphere really affects your emotions and your emotions affect your decision making right amen that is why it's so important you are careful where you are that's right so if we create an atmosphere founded on the word of God in our lives in our homes in our families we're going to position our emotions in the word that's right some people have favorite preachers because they have a way to to to people let me put this way people prefer things that affect their emotions in a positive way right but I'm not we're not here to affect our emotions in a positive way yeah that's it we're here for our emotions to come into subjection to the word so we cannot judge like some of you are are yawning and getting a little little tired you can't judge this service you say you're just defending yourself no no I'm not I'm just trying to make a point you can't judge this service by your emotions right now go home and chew on this go home and chew on the word and Fe chew the cut and go in the word and God will do something in your life you see praise the Lord the atmosphere that's why atmosphere is so important as a believer you know it's like you're with your buddies and uh there's an atmosphere of of uh hey you know we're all tough and it but you're going to be more likely to do something really really stupid yeah than when you're on your own this goes back to the whole tribe mentality why do we do what we do sometimes in church because we're all doing it right the atmosphere but if we create the atmosphere now look there's similarities because the devil cannot create he only can pervert so if we create an atmosphere based on the word of God everything comes into order that's right if we atmosphere based on the word of God in our homes in our lives everything comes to order that's why it's important what you watch you ever watch something that was good that was just so gripping for me it takes me a few hours to to realize I'm not that person that just died on the side of the mountain cuz it grips you emotionally but you can't serve God that way you you can't you can't you can't read the Bible and and and say I have to have this emotion this certain emotion because you will be ruled by that that's right amen because it's out of its position okay in the Supernatural 1956 in closing resist you want to come go over and say we're going to a dance one man standing up saying well now he do know about whether he wants to dance or not and this girl over over and she's this that and the music's playing near my God to thee huh what atmosphere for a dance he says well that's not any different than what a lot of atmospheres you go into church for a service of God just that contrary I think he's referring to the story where he stops the dance they're about to go into a dance and he and he I think that's what it is but you go back and check it just that contrary right the only thing to bring the right atmosphere then for the dance is to put on their old music that makes dance and everybody get thinking about thinking what a good time they're going to have dancing and so forth and they'll be having a big hoop up in time put the right kind of music on the piano the organ and everybody in the atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there going to meet everything they have need of something will go to taking place atmosphere but that's the hardest thing there is there is to do and that is to get people in that atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing that's right so I hope you have you can see by this point why the atmosphere is so important because you as a human being have emotions right and the atmosphere affects because by definition from science it's an external stimuli something someone says or an event so the right atmosphere positionally places your emotions on the word of God and if your emotions are St stabilized by The Rock which is the revelation of Jesus Christ you're going to make good decisions you're going to make good decisions in your life you're going to make good decisions at home that's why it's super important if if you're having altercation with your children you get worked up take a break because your emotions are out of position that's right so we're in the house of God when we come let's come and create such an atmosphere that everything is grounded upon the word of God we come with our lives we come pray up you can be you can be struggling you can be having a hard time but you're in the right atmosphere there's times where emotionally I'm really struggling but I'm in the right atmosphere that's right and through that God brings Clarity that's right and God is not the author of confusion oh that's right let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus pray that thank you for your word tonight Lord Jesus kind kind of hit here here and there and maybe a little bit disc confabulated at some points but I just pray it all have been done to your glory for your honor not my opinions I'm not trying to to to LIF to prop my opinion up I don't want to do that I want your word to come and just speak to our hearts Lord speak to my heart give me greater Clarity Lord help us father to be to be the author of our atmospheres to take it more seriously that that father we could be positioned emot put our emotions in their proper position so we can have Clarity in Our Lives Lord Jesus it's not psychology we can't even do that without your leading We cannot put ourselves in the at right atmosphere without your leading because the devil hates Your Atmosphere so the flesh is going to pull the wrong direction but God it's your Holy Spirit in us that says no I won't accept that we bring ourselves in the right atmosphere God we bring things into that order that atmosphere in our church it's scriptural Lord that we'll see the healings and we'll see the expressions of of Deliverance in people's life why because the atmosphere of God has the power to move mountains because you are present and you are that God you are the I am so Lord may you just help us Lord to to remember every day every day of our lives every every moment we have to to to to make sure we are positioning ourselves in the right atmosphere we are positioning ourselves on your word we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen praise the Lord can we sing that song I am thine oh Lord I in oh I have heard thy voice and it's hold thy love to me but I long to uh G Gideon that's the right song
