heart he knows your heart he sees your hand amen heavenly father lord jesus we say it every time but we mean it all from our hearts we're so thankful to know you lord in this tumultuous age that we live in father i don't know how people survive lord father if they do they're barely getting by father but lord we as the children of god have a place here lord jesus even lord we know this is just a building but father it is your plan your program father that's why we're here lord because this is how you move this is how you work lord to come to church to hear this preaching of the word father and on top of that lord we have the privilege to bring to you our needs lord we bring them to you tonight father what are an honor it is lord jesus to know that you always keep your word there's certain people we all know them certain people you ask them to do something or you tell them or they say they'll do something and you there's always something in the back of your head whether or not they'll follow through just because that's human nature but when it comes to you father we can ask lord and we know without a shadow of a doubt lord that you will do something father help us to accept your will lord jesus even when it's contrary to our own lord father because we know that ultimately lord you have the plan figured out you have our destination figured out and lord of phil just trusts you it'll all work out in the end take these requests tonight this man with covet that's bothering it's bothering his heart lord give him strength heal his body lord your will be done father whatever other needs were mentioned tonight whatever the needs are in your body father i pray you touch there lord touch the heart of the people tonight as our pastor would bring forth the word lord may our ears be attentive father may we push aside the tiredness of the body and lord be ready to hear from you we thank you lord we love you and commit these things into your hands in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] amen amen as we get ready to receive our pastor let's sing that song number 374 no ye not no you're not you are a temple [Music] you are a temple [Music] [Music] yes i know yes i

praise full of power full of glory i'm full of praise for a power full of glory i'm full of praise full of glory am a temple of the holy full of praise i'm full of praise full of glory i am a temple amen hallelujah aren't you glad we are the temple of the holy ghost how beautiful that is amen you know i just can't sometimes saints you know i just can't get over you know certain things the prophet says we see in the scripture and i i just lingers with me day after day just constantly a reminder the prophet of god talking about when we see who we are amen and you know it's been a topic that's been being preached on and brought up and and um you know when we talk a little bit with uh brothers and friends from other parts of the country um i i think it's wonderful because i can assure you there's no little network on we're going to preach on this or we're going to be that but you'll find this very thought or topic of recognizing who we are is being preached around the world amen it's the season amen it's just like it's a season that we see what what the the will or desire of uh the people of our nation is and you see nothing to be scared of amen i i didn't include it tonight i'm gonna try and be timely but you know the prophet of god laid these things right out of this is what you're going to see the scripture says as it was in the days of sodom well saints i probably i don't know brother chris it's probably eight or ten years ago i was like we're at sodom hallelujah well i had no idea what sodom really was amen and so the thing is is we don't need to worry about what sodom is the word said you get ready amen when you see these signs you see him in the heavens you see him in the earth this is the time for you to look up and rejoice amen hallelujah i say thank you lord because i tell you i had a conversation with a a older man today as a friend of mine he actually stopped by and saw me there pulled in he's like paul have you recovered from the covet yet and i'm like yeah and uh he he is not a religious man at all he's very much a skeptic and we we were visiting there and he starts talking about the politics of it and saints i have to tell you i just was like yeah i don't care about that well what about i don't care about that no this doesn't matter that's unimportant thinks like what's wrong with you well you see i've got a heavenly home there's no trumps there there's no bidens there there's no pelosi there amen there's no banker there amen it's just a glorious place amen and that's what we're looking at and just to kind of you know as we spoke the other day you see i i just desire that god would allow us to not be out there as it were looking to calvary but to realize that we're at calvary looking back at what god asked us to do we already have a position we already have a calling and we already have a final result amen so this world is not our home can we say amen if it was my home i would be very much concerned as i built me a fortress on a mountain somewhere but it's not my home saints i would like you before we go into the word i'd like us as a group of believers just to stand are it's come to my attention that brother joe riley is in very dire health slipping away very quickly and it's time as believers that we don't build fences it's time for us to tear the fences down we might not agree on certain things but we need to have that tender heart that soft heart that we look and say lord this is a brother let god brother george smith i had a good conversation he brings greetings to you i bring greetings for him to you um brother george has a saying he says let's run a race we'll meet at the finish line we're not here to criticize how someone else runs their race we're here to get to the finish line our own self so let's just stop let's lift our hearts tonight lift our brother joe in prayer also our sister mimi just ask the lord to come on the scene we want god's perfect will amen heavenly father lord jesus we just come before you this evening lord we're human and sometimes we have our differences and our feelings get hurt and circumstances are what they are but lord we just come before you tonight and ask you lord father we petition you that thy perfect will be done in all things but lord the word clearly shows that you are life and lord we're lifting our brother joe up tonight father just come in the scene father come in the room lord may your presence be known and stir his heart father just pull him real close to you close to your bosom father life is so precious and father we fight so hard for life so we just lift our brother up lord that thy perfect will be done lord we claim healing for him it's never too late lord while there is breath there is hope there's life there is hope father even as we see with lazarus when breath was gone there was still hope lord we would just ask you to come and touch our sister mimi lord that you would just give strength to her father that your peace your presence would surround her lord just guide her day by day give comfort to her lord these are the things of life the natural life we're not bound father here for as your word says if we had hope in this life only we would be men most miserable but father we have a hope beyond this natural life oh father we thank you for that that comfort that peace that comes with knowing that we are in you and your very life flows through us every fiber of our being father sold out to you help us lord help us we pray we ask now on behalf lord of our brother joe sister mimi for your tender hand of mercy and your precious name we pray amen hallelujah good to be a christian i tell you what it's so wonderful wonderful let's turn in our bibles this evening to first corinthians the 13th chapter i want to preach to you tonight preparations of the inner man we want to talk on the subject of a reflection of the perfect one and uh you know just uh kind of uh in studying scripture there's many others but i felt led to come here out of corinthians we'll look at this my brother and sister the scripture clear full of it maybe we'll carry on in future services but in the scripture talking about an image amen and so there will be images that are there and uh boy you think about that uh those images and how it is uh we want to come down and recognize that all that we are amen is because of our lord jesus christ amen we would be uh just like the world amen we would be reflected of the spirits of the age but christ is here amen amen amen and you know my brother and sister i want to just put it this way it's another thought for another time but you see how blessed we are is he spoke and we heard you think about that he spoke and we heard but now i'd like to turn that around we spoke and he heard that that's called fellowship hallelujah not a one-sided conversation you know sometimes you know you get a topic you get something on your mind and you're driving in the car with your wife and you're just talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and when the time is over you say oh honey it was so wonderful to be communing or fellowshipping with you it's kind of like really you see it has to be a two-way conversation hallelujah thank you lord though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity and become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy my brother and sister that's pretty incredible when you think about that and understand all mysteries there's these lines right here you could just preach for months and all knowledge and then it now gets really deep and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil us not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeleth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail where there be tongues they shall cease where there be knowledge it shall vanish away my brother and sister i want to interject in this i've hit recently very much on the topic of an intellectual revelation of the message you see where there be knowledge it shall vanish away there comes something if an intellectual revelation is what we have of this word of this day something will come and replace that oh my lord give us revelation of your word let the spirit man be able to reach out and take a hold of that and let us you know these are words we get excited over but i want you to understand the depth of what it really means when the prophet of god says you know or expounds upon ye are bone of his bone amen you are flesh of his flesh this means that you can no more depart from christ then he himself could divide himself for we no impart we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child understood as a child and i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then amen and another time another season moving into it right but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known now my brother and sister we could look at this in a carnal realm and say oh how is it that we are known well i don't care who you are you will find someone who does not like you and you'll have someone who lifts you up much higher than they should but to be known here in the scripture is tying us back to the original seed the very image of who we are in jesus christ is the revelation that will be made known hallelujah and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity heavenly father we ask you lord to guide us tonight let us speak let it be only according to thy word lord for the edification of the body of christ lord to give praise glory and honor to you we ask this father in your precious name amen you may be seated as i come across the words that inspired me to pursue this thought i realized my brother and sister that there is something in our life that each one of us is drawn to there is something that we come and let's look for just a moment in the natural there are those that might love the big city uh there are those that would be just as at home maybe on a mountaintop somewhere uh maybe they don't like the city at all vice versa and you look at this that we're drawn in a natural element now whatever we put before us my brother and sister is an influence uh in our life amen and so you know as we look at this as brother branham preaches a message influence uh we'll recognize that these things are all pushing on us and and you know in that uh sometimes you'll have something that you didn't realize was an influence to you but it is present and it's having an effect and so we'll look and see how that while we are desiring to uh uh fulfill every drop of the word of god right for the bride of jesus christ amen that's our desire we're not here just to have a religious experience but we are desiring to come into the very one amen the scripture says that we were made in his image amen and so we will be manifest and you know that's a very interesting thought deviate for just a moment we were made in his image and when god chose to come down into our presence amen what did he do he then came in the very image he made you and i in and that's the image he chose to present himself to us because he wanted us to be able to relate to him he did not want to come as a high priest it would settle on the pinnacle of the of the uh temple you know and and cause the people to bow down but he commonly walked with us and it was in him that all the deity of of god all of that uh mystery of the the body of christ was in him and it walked right amongst the world and they could not see him but by revelation those that were called saw him and so we see that that was the very type that god laid all through the ages is that god in flesh would be walking right here in laodicea and only a small portion of the world would even recognize that god was in flesh in fact it's a little scary my brother and sister that there are people around the message even this struggle with the idea of god being in them amen but if you ever catch a revelation of how this relationship really works you'll recognize that the very fiber of your being is god amen it is not you know as brother brown says it's not of charles and ella branham amen because that would be a sinful nature but we have a higher calling a higher revelation of who we really are amen and so as we'll look and i i just want to expedite this tonight i'm speaking to believers amen but when that which is perfect is come and you know there's many many places and we maybe lord willing touch on it in the future but brother branham talks about that when the perfect is come that was our lord jesus christ but it's not that we look back to calvary or look back to a.d 33 looking back in that my brother and sister and when that perfect brother branham says that the word of god the presence of god the holy spirit come in every age to manifest the word for that age amen but we're looking now at the culmination of the ages and everything that was on display in that first church age second third fourth fifth sixth is now brought together amen and it's on display now now you wonder just who you are well i'll tell you what you are god called you to be able to live every word amen that has come forth amen not just a portion not to just say well we have a singular portion here of our day but god has called you to be able to live every word abel but he's also placed the desire there that you want to live every word amen otherwise you could say well it's available but i don't feel like doing it no god's put inside of you the desire to live it oh how so the perfect one has come see so those things that are in part shall be done away now let's not confuse this that we believe we have every drop of the fullness of christ of the mystery of christ right here right now that we could describe these things you see we'll if life went on a million years we will never fully see who our lord jesus is amen we'll never fully have a revelation of who god is because he's so much greater than the capacity that we as humans are but we will live all he called us to live we will understand all he has called us to understand we will not be shorted on one measure not one bit of our stature amen so don't go running around trying to compare yourself or compare our church or what is happening here with someone else you seek what god has for you amen make your calling an election sure amen now we care about one another we do don't we i hope we can say amen but you see my brother and sister you can no more put me in the rapture than i can put you in the rapture but we as a body of believers can encourage one another and strengthen one another to stand on the word and the word will put us in a rapture amen so now see we we see through a glass darkly in other words it's there that there's an image we see these things it's not completely clear to us but the day is coming see then face to face what we know in part now we shall know even as i am known so we see how the revelation of god is opening to you and i and there will be a point in time i don't know when this is i i'm kind of a little bit loath to to uh try and drive home something amen my brother and sister if we you know what happened if we knew the date when the lord was coming most of us would just kind of live these laxatical lives and then the night before he's going to come we'd have a revival but that's not what god wants you imagine if i knew that the lord was coming on whatever date 2021 maybe i won't get there that might get personal i tell you the nature of many would be they wouldn't read their bible they wouldn't pray they wouldn't study the word they might not go lie cheat steal drink dance all that things they just get lazy because we know it's on this date we got to get ready that's why he said i'm going to come as a thief in the night so what you need to do if you're worried about the thief in the night you just need to make sure you're ready so when i come it won't matter no morning noon or night you'll just be ready i'll tell you there's something liberated my brother and sister liberating about living on fire for god not not just existing not just uh trudging along but living a liberated life amen you know it's there that he called us he said you know what i'm just gonna paraphrase the scripture i don't want you going back to your old bondage i want you to live in the liberty by which i have already set you free amen that's where he wants us to be living in that liberty hallelujah so now as we'll move forward i want to just do this as we're speaking or coming into these thoughts i've really pruned this down tonight realize uh god's got mercy and a lot of this is will expand you might say or is fresh to you in proverbs 27 19 as we'll look at reflections my brother and sister as in water face enters to face so the heart of man to man now we'll look at this i want you to think about this in a natural but move over into the spiritual okay but you look at this there has to be a surface of some nature by which can reflect back you can go and if the wind is blowing or there's moss and leaves upon the water you will find no reflection but you know we have seen the pictures taken by professional or those that are good photographers we've seen the picture that is is of the lake with the mountains and how that it is reflected so perfectly upon the water uh sometime back here i saw a picture uh the the back story of this photographer is they set there for days and days and days and took hundreds of pictures until the one turned out perfect and it was a waterfalls coming off of the edge of a mountain into the edge of this lake and the picture becoming so perfect the water like glass the pitcher it looks like the waterfall comes in but if you turn the pitcher over and this is where they get you which side was the original it was such a perfect reflection you could take the photo turn it over and it was hard to decide which one was the original or the background because it was such a perfect reflection and so you know as it is as in water faith answers face my brother and sister if we're looking into the perfect water tonight it is so glassy we look down if i lean over that water amen brother trevor's face is not going to appear you see what it reflects back is what is there the reflection or the water does not determine what is seen but the image that is there are you with me it has to be an image there and whatever that image is is all that can be reflected back so we cannot come and put a faith as it were and look into the water and be corruptible and get an image back of the incorruptible you say wait now brother paul no no my brother and sister i'm on the right track don't misunderstand me you say but brother paul we're not perfect no my word my bible says i'm perfect so as a believer i can look into the water and in this flesh i am corruptable but as i look into that what is reflected back as a believer in the word of god is not corruptable it is incorruptible that is reflected back to me and so as we look at this following here in the natural amen for there to be an image reflected back there has to be an image original image that is there to be reflected because it will be my brother and sister the reflector can only reflect back the mirror image as it is that the lake can only reflect the image before her so it is to man we can only reflect the image before us now my brother and sister we look at this sometimes and and you know the the word of god opens up so many avenues that that sometimes you say which which one of these which avenue should i take well sometimes there is no wrong avenue you just have to ask god for leadership on what direction to go amen so as we'll look at the image that has been placed before us this is why sometimes my brother and sister i may sound redundant and i know you don't like me using that word it's very redundant but it's there my brother and sister we have to be reminded that we are not to look in the flesh to try to find what it is god wants us to be but we have to look to one that is perfect amen we have to look to the perfect one because if we look to that image of the corruptable all we will see is the corruptable amen so we as sons and daughters of god must look to a higher image a greater image amen to really see who we are in other words you're gonna have to look at something that's beyond this tangible world we live in if you're ever going to see the perfect hallelujah because if we look at this tangible level right here or this earthly level all we will see is the corruptable we can preach about well we are perfect we're righteous we're holy uh we are washed by the water of the word and then we just start looking at one another judging one another following one another around seeing what each other's faults and failures are our weaknesses are and we will never be able to fully grasp what it is to be perfect but when we raise our image oh hallelujah if i could just lay this out for you that photographer that took that picture of that perfect reflection of those mountains my brother and sister it wasn't about the water oh do you recognize it if they had tilted the camera down a little farther they might have saw leaf and twigs and rocks and and all kinds of things but you see when it's looking in the right way it is about the water you might see the shoreline you might see all the imperfections but what catches you is the fact that here is something so majestic here is something so incredible and everything being perfect it is reflected back to you so much that you can look at the water and you can see the trees you can look at the water and you can see the rocks you can look at the water and you can see the sky you see my brother and sister we raise our eyes a little further and we don't have to look at the reflection we can look at the original amen so it all depends on what position you choose to look and you'll find the christian that walks with his head down always laboring always struggling always criticizing himself always judging himself harshly all he sees is the rocks and the roots and the insects and the whatever it is and he lifts his eyes a little higher and he sees a reflection of something so majestic but he still doesn't have the real thing that's why religion my brother and sister just that religion we're going to move beyond religion because the original is right there before our eyes if we will lift our eyes up to look amen hallelujah amen we can only reflect the image before us now look when god was speaking to moses in the ten commandments in exodus 20 we'll see that he says thou shalt have no other gods before me now when we read that we say okay that's the ten commandments that's good no other gods god's a jealous god but i want you to look at that scripture in light of reflection my brother and sister you see as we have jehovah the lord god almighty elohim before us that is what we look to that is what we long for that's what we're focused on what will we do we will start i'm talking about in the broad spectrum of who we are flesh man spiritual man when we look to that reflection as it were of the perfect one we start to reflect that i watched the metamorphosis of a man i knew years ago he went to work in a certain place there was a man there that was good family man i guess the man had just a lovely family but he dressed like a biker he owned a harley but it was one of those slicker kind of harleys not hardcore and this man i knew goes to work in that business and ends up working right on the same spot in a shop with that man the next thing you know he had square toed boots pretty soon he had a wallet with a chain on it then he had a belt with metal studs and then i didn't see him for a long time and one day i run into him and he's wearing this leather wristband with all these spikes on it i couldn't help myself but i asked him did you steal that from your dog but you see my brother and sister there was something about that man that he had maybe wanted to be in his life i hope you're with me and that image was before him and over time he started to change into that image it's a beautiful story because you see he was such a good worker and had such skill he was a welder and had such skills that he was working on a big commercial job in boise and some other company caught his attention they said who did these welds and they said it was sam and that company went right to sam and said i don't care what they pay you we'll pay you more come work for us and sam leaves that job it's a good opportunity and he goes to work for another company but in that company everybody was high tight and white and did you know over time oh can anybody tell me what happened to sam sam turn high white and tight because that was the image before him now you say that's so silly a man be that moldable you are you are and if the image before us is the image of the corruptable we will end up being in the image of the corruptable but when that image is in the image of the incorruptable you will find that any man or woman that will elevate god in their life and look to him in him alone you will see your life change oh lord change me change me lord hallelujah amen hallelujah see you can only reflect the image that's before you now as god speaking to moses as i said thou shalt have no other gods before me my brother and sister don't misunderstand me i'm not trying to turn the ten commandments but i want you to just catch this little revelation god knew that whatever image was in front of the people would be what they would start to reflect and we see moses is on the mountain and a spirit is in the camp and they take all their jewelry and rings and necklaces and all this and they melt it down and they mold a golden calf and when moses comes down from the mountain these people no longer have the image of god before them they've got the image of an idol of a calf as though there was ever a calf that provided was ever a healer ever a deliverer ever any no no calf ever did that they uh because oh so hallowed i just can't get it out amen because they never never my brother and sister anchored on jehovah as the only image they were there then moldable they were there influenceable to another image and what that image was they started to become are you with me i'm sorry tonight i was stuttering around here because my mind's already left me it's like maybe meridian headed to mountain home i don't know but look at this my brother and sister now shall have no other gods before me no other image for you to be influenced by and i want to say tonight if you and i would put every other image of this world out of our mind and raise christ up before us you say brother paul i'm struggling to live i'm struggling to be excited about serving god there might be another image in your way and if you deal with that image get it pushed out put it where it belongs and the only image you see is jesus christ you will find it's easy to follow that image i'll move on from that thought i believe you catch where i'm at now i don't mean to sound intellectual here i love to read i read a variety of things you might want to go look this up if if you're not familiar with it but when you look at the principle of probable outcome now it's more of a modern thinking but my brother and sister in the principle of probable outcome which is pretty self-explanatory right don't get too serious on it right probable outcome that's where you can sit back and say this is this and this and it will probably do this this and this and this will be it'll probably be like this the man spends all of his money every paycheck probable outcome he will be poor are you with me so i'm not trying to sound sophisticated it's just the term that goes with it now you look at this i'm being redundant here forgive me but whatever it is before you is what you're going to reflect now can i go to kind of a humorous side of this when i was a young man my family come to the message we're farmers that's the life i knew that was the world we lived in we start to get immersed you might say into the message i say this in humor nothing against my father my mother but the very first time my parents went to listen to a tape here we are these wild indian long-haired kids and i remember my dad lined us all up before we went to another another people's house and he put his hand in our face and he said if you kids act up tonight when we get home i will beat you what an introduction i set like a church mouse i remember the first time still registered my mind i heard the voice good evening friends now my brother and sister if what is set before us the probable outcome that is what we're going to reflect i do not say this to be negative but just to make a point it wasn't long as the church started to grow the guys who didn't know which end of the horse to throw the saddle on or put the bridle on were wearing cowboy boots an eagle belt buckle they had a cowboy hat and they had a cb in their vehicle you know it is kind of humorous when you look at a station wagon with two rabbit ears on it just doesn't fit the image i'm sorry everyone they scoured every gun shop in this country to find their version of blondie i hope you catch my point was it the revealed word that was drawing them no there was another image and they were conforming or being drawn into that image my brother and sister it wasn't brother branham's fault it was nothing to do with the message this was the image that people thought the message was and so they were drawn to that but when the day come that they come as it were to the skirmish line to the battle line to the battlefront let's call it that that they had no other foundation than we have conformed to what they thought the message was and when they come to the battlefront and the blood started to flow and there was casualties they said this isn't what i signed up for you see the wrong image had been left before them that they thought they were believers of the message because they had lined up to a certain image but my brother and sister i was talking with the brother george today i was going to say a brother but you're smart enough figure it out if i was talking i was talking to brother george today brother george made a comment he goes well brother paul press the battle have a wonderful service tonight and remember we got to point people to jesus christ amen we don't want to point them to ourselves we don't want to point them to our church we don't want to point them to some kind of movement we want to point them to jesus christ and my brother and sister it won't happen here because i believe god's been gracious to you you have that revelation but there's many a group in the message tonight that the image before them is a pastor the image before them is their church and its reputation around the world and that is what is before them but my brother and sister if we point to christ and that's the only image that's left before us when you get to the battle line and the blood starts to flow and their enemy is pressing to the mark you are not going to say well wait this isn't what i signed up for you're going to stand there and say you know what greater is he is in me than is in this world i can do all things through christ jesus hallelujah it won't be wait wait i need to call my pastor well i'll make a call all right lord come on the scene amen and when you speak he hears hallelujah and the reason you can have that kind of confidence is because when he spoke you heard hallelujah that's what makes a difference right there amen hallelujah see if there's other gods before us saints i'm going to just drive this home tonight i love you and i'm not preaching hard on you at all but i just feel led of the lord to lay this out we will be whatever image is before us you know something's very common in our semi-religious world we live in i've heard it around the message i've had people in other countries say brother paul i'd like to talk to you and then when they lay their problem out and you you get very direct with them they say don't judge me you don't know the circumstance you don't know my life it's a very common thing in this semi-religious world we live in you can't hardly witness to somebody and say something that might go against their grain don't judge me but you see the problem my brother and sister is it's not us it's judging it's the word you see what they've forgotten what they think people are judging them what they have forgotten is that they are projecting an image of something let's forget about denomination my brother and sister ride in the realms of the message people projecting images what is it that's what they're holding in front of them that's what stood up as a priority in front of them they can't help themselves but reflect that image well i hope i haven't stomped on too many toes tonight praise the lord now remember when somebody shut your fingers in the door stomps on your toes you say ouch amen you see what's happened saints we are either projecting the risen or the fallen there's no other choice people say well you know this is what we are this we're doing no there's only two spirits in the framework of the church we're projecting the risen or we're projecting the fallen see that risen nature is christ the fallen nature is antichrist you see so christ you might say involved in both sides of this but one they're pushing against it brother branham speaks about this several different places i kind of stepped around this because it draws off in another angle but brother branham says now everything that the sadducees the pharisees every they had studied in the word clearly showed them what they should be looking for but another image had been raised up in front of them of what it would be they knew they had the word they told them what to look for now tell me my brother and sister if that ain't the same spirit in the world we live in today we have the word that tells us what to look for but if another image gets raised up in front of that then we will move off to the right or to the left because we've been taught this image is the image you should look at and my brother and sister god wants us to go back to the word amen raise that up as the image not our interpretation of the word now i'm going to just speak a little bold this might be direct if somebody's listening on the internet and this offends you i'm sorry but it's true but many years ago when the eagle computing remember that when eagle computing not the table but when eagle computing come out the very first deal i i forget what it was it ran on dos i think it was and and i was proficient at dos at one time i know you guys won't believe that but i used to be proficient on a computer about 40 years ago but we were coming out of those we were associated with there was things we couldn't deal with and for years saints like i said i don't say this critically i'm making a point for years we had been told brother branham said i want you to see this brother branham said this this this what did it do those words raised an image up before us okay brother brahm said that we believe he's a prophet our life started to conform to those words right we're being drawn in those words because we want to be right but then god started pushing us out there were little things that happened and i won't go into that but little things started moving us and and unfortunately i will say this kind of indictment on paul god led my wife first she started saying paul this ain't right or behavior and i was like oh it's all right it's all right and she was like i'm not going to be involved with that any longer we called it fellowship friday night movies and the quality of the movies just slowly declined and she said i ain't doing it no more and i was like oh honey just yawn and go to the bathroom or something when nope ain't doing it then god convicted me because they mocked my wife not because my heart smit me but when they mocked my wife i said enough of that we started looking in the eagle computing brother branham said it we change the words every way you can change it we never even to this day have found what they said brother branham said but look at the image that was raised up to us it caused us as a group of young married couples to feel okay to behave a certain way it caused us to have a certain perspective of the message of the hour and my brother and sister i would declare to you it never existed in the words that they used that's right but the image that was raised affected a whole group of people the mere words i'm not too too direct am i tonight you see you're going to push back against this and say no way brother paul but i want you to just give me the liberty to look at this in a natural sense do you realize saints when it's crafted and molded and presented in the right way every one of you can be drawn into that the only that you're not is because the holy ghost is in you the only reason as humans in the flesh you can be molded and drawn into this because of the image that is put in front of you oh we ought to thank the lord tonight for the holy ghost amen we won't be deceived saints amen it said if it were possible but the holy ghost has sealed you to the day of your redemption so if you are sealed there is nothing can get in there to take away or draw it out we'll go to a scripture in a minute quote in a minute to draw it out or to add something into it you see if it's drawn out it can still be pure but it's depleted right that's why it's not just one filling of the holy ghost and go on the rest of your life you need many refillings because satan will draw that out of you life will draw that out of you and you will have the truth and you will want to serve god and wake up one day so weary in your well doing depleted you won't have the strength to go on but you might hold in your hand the pure word of god the other side is if you're not sealed until the day of your redemption somebody will come along this is a true story actually comes out of world war ii where they wanted to kill a man but they could never get close to him and everything was done so this man figured out if he could ever get something that the man they wanted to kill drank a lot of wine and they said if we could ever ever ever get something and they found a needle so small that they actually pushed it through the cork and injected the poison and pulled it out and the natural resonance of the court expanded back so that it was sealed and the wine never lost its i don't what did you call that it's it's a savor it's it's a flavor it's whatever and the man drank it and died you see my brother and sister satan would come and what he tries to do to you and i in our natural life and even in the church is just inject one little bit of poison he don't have to rip the cork out and pour some out and pour something back in he just injects just a little bit then what happens dead is dead incapacitated is incapacitated neither of those can claim to be alive deuteronomy 4 9 only take heed to myself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest thy they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sons what is telling us take heed to thyself i don't care how much you hear the preacher and how revelated he is how much he is on the word of god my brother and sister you have to take heed to that because these are the things that you have to hold you have to look at that you have to know where you stand i don't care how revelated your pastor is i don't care how much that you respect that that is all good but you have to take heed you have to look at it yourself examine yourself take the word hold it up as a mirror lord how do i how do i fit in your word i don't want the word to be an image that i created amen i hope you catch the depth of that keep thy soul diligently you realize my brother and sister that right there is work in laodicea not his work you won't go a day you let it slip a day my brother and sister and the devil will be in there trying to wipe out your hard drive and inject something else on there to occupy your thoughts and everything amen so you look at that see he's still telling you right here lest thou forget the things not which we're told you catch that line not the things you were told not somebody else's experience but you can see these very things for yourself and we have made the statement i have made the statement once your eyes see you can never go back my brother and sister the word of god shows us you could see it and it could still just slowly fade away what happens life depleting not your revelation there's a man i won't go into enough detail for you to catch it but there's a man that i know made a wreck out of his family made a wreck out of his life made a wreck out of other people's lives and many years later he passed away and many years later a man that knew him as he had went back from the message preaching the message went back to being a drunk and going to the bars and the dance halls and whatever else and this man looked me in the face one day and says i never met a man who had a revelation of this message like him i remember the time i scoffed that there ain't no way what he did he had a revelation but you know the reality of it is he understood this message the nuance of it the in the out he could explain it probably as well as any man on the face of the earth but he forgot the things that his eyes had seen he had seen the moving of god he'd seen healing he'd seen delivered he saw all of that but he forgot it and the image that started to rise in front of him hallelujah i'm probably right at that age that's why sister jerry keeps a short lease on me i'm right at the age the other day i told her i said honey can i buy a dirt bike you know the reason i want a dirt bike because in the far recesses of my mind is the days when paul was 20 or 30 feet above the ground looking down this is so cool my adrenaline just and now it really hop a foot off the ground and but the image are you with me science i hope you just don't get caught up in that little story the image that's in my mind is of paul the 23 year old that just twisted the throttle wide open and just went solution to everything when in doubt gasset i can see paul now going out there pillow pillow pillow pillow pillow pillow [Music] wobble wobble woo but you see our mind will take us back into something and this man he started looking back and he started forgetting the things of god in another image of his youth when he was strong this is a man that in his older age looked at another young man that i know and told him you don't do it i tell you i'll whip you and that young man could pick up about 250 300 pounds knew how to box new karate or one of those things like that and this old man with a pot belly you don't do it i want to whip you what was it he had another image before him he had an image when he was a scrapper when he was a fighter and he told those stories so long he went back to those and it became so real to him saints i'm not condemning this man i want to paint a clear picture to you it became so real to him he started forgetting the things that he knew that god delivered him from the bottle god delivered him from a dance hall god delivered him from all these afflictions but that went away and another image rose up and he followed that image oh hallelujah are you with me amen oh it behooves us to look at ourselves oh i want to be out by now let's hurry from that old confusion oh i'm going to be you're scared what's the matter you'd be frying your meat of a morning for breakfast and the first thing you know i want to talk about atmosphere here for a minute first thing you know you're filled with holy spirit now i'm going to shock you a little bit you don't mind do you all right for instance the meats are frying and all at once the grease pops out on your hand now if you'll just shake it off and go on frying meat it wouldn't bother you now i know you didn't get that just right didn't catch that revelation look the first thing oh where's the how do you say that word angentine something you see you grabbed your hand see it scares you to death that's what does it it's fear peter walking on the water he was walking all right till he seen the waves contrary and he got scared jesus said why'd you fear that's what's the matter the holy ghost people today they got a lot of afraid amen the devil's just trying to scare you out of something i want to read that again real loud to you the devil's just trying to scare you out of something he's trying to put off some where else and say well some of these days you'll be this get that did you get it some of these days you'll be this now brother trevor i'm just speaking to you as a brother but let's not get into the place that we're looking one of these days one of these days one of these days it's now my brother and sister we are now the sons and daughters of god not looking to another time another season another life we are now hallelujah right oh how the prophet of god says sorry i got ahead of myself amen no i will no we're seated together in heavenly places now we'll have all the powers in heaven's earth see now we have it not in the millennium we won't need it then we got it now right now we are sons of god it does not appear what we shall be but we know we'll be like him what you are here is a reflection of what you are somewhere else those he called he justifies i want to read that again what you are here is a reflection of what you are somewhere else now that's a two-edged sword think about it two-edged sword but i'll tell you as uh sons and daughters of god that love the word of god amen we're not at a bunko party tonight we're out of the chili feed tonight we're in the house of god tonight what we are tonight as sons and daughters of god feeding on the word is what we are somewhere else oh hallelujah those he called he justifies is that right knows he justified his glorified already in the presence of the father we have a glorified body now there'll be people around that will say oh you're getting way off to the side perugia this that and the other i'm sorry my brother and sister i hope you bear with me tonight i'm not out there looking towards the cross i've already realized who i am in jesus christ and i'm looking back at this life saying lord i am going to fulfill your word do you understand what i'm saying does that sound pretty wacky to you i'll tell you what it'll take it'll take more than this flesh looking that's right to see who you are yes sir way more than this flesh looking to see who you are already in the presence of father we have a glorified body whoo even the prophet thought that was deep wasn't that deep all right we'll find out whether it's right or not if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we'll have one already waiting is that right amen now look what he says here a little bit direct that's right so right now what we are there is a reflection here what we are here is a reflection of what we are somewhere else so if your deeds are evil you know where it comes from you know where your other body is waiting did you catch what the prophet of god said if your works are evil you know where your other body is now you go study this gyrus and divine healing read up from it read down from it amen you'll find that the prophet god is talking as sons and daughters of god we got a theophanic body amen it's waiting for us we know who we are we know what god's prepared for us and we're desiring and longing to receive that hallelujah oh my oh my i'll tell you what when i read that i was like wow that would offend a lot of people especially the ones that do brother deals it would offend him you're judging me brother paul no i'm sorry you judged yourself now in the sermon the harvest time brother branham uses reflection a bunch there but i knew that i kind of long-winded so i kind of pruned it down okay amen hmm it's all right brothers don't worry about it something's missing i'll just start with what i got on my screen and in that due date luke 17 20 i believe it is jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not men the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people see the word itself made flesh in you there's people who don't believe that that's right oh i'm not talking about presbyterians or lutherans the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour amen look what the prophet saying i hope you catch the depth of it we're not a reflection of pentecost we're not a reflection of the dark ages all of those attributes and all of those spirits of those ages we deal with them and we're going to overcome that but you see we're reflecting this out amen hallelujah we're not talking about an hour where the bride just decides well okay burn me at the stake i'll give my life nope my brother and sister this is the hour that life can be easy it can be cozy a good job a good house good family nice cars vacations and all of that stuff and you're still called to give your life but it's a different fashion now it's a battle against the comfort the feeling of the flesh intellectualism you are a reflection of this hour the message reflection of it see you live again live the life that was in jesus christ you're in the presence of the sun then to the what happened to it what happens to that church finally listen that shock pulls away from that wheat and when it begins to be manifested what happened the life that was in the shock went on out in the wheat the life won't change the carriers change they denominate see the blades the tassel the shock but the wheat can't change it's got to be a ministry just exactly on the word like he was on the word like the first church was on the word spirit filled word fed not denominational fed word fed i say amen to that hallelujah amen what is this because there is an image my brother and sister i hope this is not too simplistic but there is an image that we will follow and if we get caught up into the image we'll believe that because we go to a message church and so and so is our pastor and we have a friend here and we know this and we know that and we've been in the message for a certain amount of time that image raises up and we say we're message believers but the real message my brother and sister is jesus christ in you hallelujah now i want to put this right out to you as we're closing amen brother branham preaching seed is not air with the shot beautiful sermon amen but i want you to catch this now the shock has no reflection to the original seed that's right catch this the seed goes in the ground it sprouts it comes forth it's rising up and somebody look out in the field brother branham goes over and over again and seed is not here with the shock it goes up and it looks like there's wheat there but you go over there there's nothing there my brother and sister and people say well we have wheat we have we but you come and that shock is no reflection of that original seed that went in the ground the only reflection of the original seed is when that shock which is there as the carrier comes to maturity and it is for your day for your age you catch what the prophet saying we're not looking back to another day it has now come into maturity and the shark is there and it is not a reflection of the original seed it's only the carrier amen but when that comes to maturity and you shell that out you can go back and if you had as it were in the natural one of those seeds of wheat or corn whichever one you want to do because this scripture interprets it that way you can take that and what we have now is a perfect match to what went into the ground the original and that is what this message is doing not an image of the wheat as it is but the image of the seed amen that seed will be the perfect reflection of the original seed that went in the ground oh hallelujah i don't care if you have a thousand acres of wheat oh you have a thousand acres of wheat but there is nothing in that chuck you have nothing but did you know if you have one grain and you put it in the right soil this is why the old testament value of planting a church or coming into a community billy graham oral roberts all of them said we go in there we have all these converts we come back in a few months or a year and there's nothing there what did they do i know this sounds a little weird but just bear with me for the thought they planted a lot of shack seed the spirit of denomination but you take just one grain we've seen this the testimony villarreal paraguay brother had a comfy job kind of associated to his pastor his brother was a pastor their father had been a pastor until he passed away and he says you know i feel led to break away from this church and go down here to villarreal you know what lives in villarreal a bunch of poverty-stricken river rat labor people sister jerry's been in the sisters homes they're embarrassed they've got nothing nothing saints it should actually i i say this i'd be guilty as all of you so don't think i'm throwing stones at you it make us feel guilty you walk in there you feel guilty we have so much we have pictures on the wall we have food here we have this we have dishes and we have furniture and we have and you go in there they sit down to a table on five gallon plastic buckets and apologize as that sister did to sister jerry i'm so sorry have nothing to offer you river rats laborers on the ships that ply the river but the word went to villarreal amen i wish i had the pictures they have a beautiful church now hundreds of believers because they didn't plant a shock they planted a seed oh saints god help us amen that we would be like the first church on the word spirit filled word fed not denominational fed word-fed hallelujah amen oh hallelujah my one more quote thank you god over us god with us somebody tell me what the next words say this message my brother and sister in the revelation associated did not stop when the prophet was called from the scene that seed was planted oh hallelujah i hope you're with me that seed was planted and that seed is going to bring forth a hundred fold it's not gonna bring 10 20 30 40. it's going to bring forth a hundred fold because it was the original seed now if any of you have ever read and it's just very public happened a few years ago they found some wheat seed in one of the pyramid and they gave that to some you know plant scientist guy and he created the perfect atmosphere for it and planted that seed and my brother and sister they don't even have a clue how old that seed is it popped to life and it grew and when it come to maturity without them doing one thing to it it put on this great big old head and the scientists like i wish we had wheat like this now why we'll just take it in this context original seed it's going to bring forth a hundredfold hallelujah not some watered-down religion not some concept of a myth of the message the original word amen god over us god with us now god in us all that god was this is the real part that just gets me bummed out i just almost cry when i think about this it's just so horrible all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into you and i oh we hear the words and we just like yeah yeah yeah we're living underneath our privilege yeah yeah yeah catch a revelation of it all the christ was he bound spirits he set people free he brought life to the dead and he poured that into you and i but we're content i hope this don't offend you tonight but we're content to go home and say we're message believers and this is a different time i'm content to believe that's me at that day you'll know that i am in the father the father in me and i in you and this is the part that just really thrills me because it'd be like okay i got to see gene of god in me but what thrills me is i'm in him [Applause] not going to be in somebody god's got a bride right revelation 19 6 7 8 9 god's got a bride is lamb's wife amen she's going to be ready it's not just somebody we're in him saints oh hallelujah so it's been god all along you see my from the moment i was born a little factual thought might be tmi forgive me my mama's for years i mean way way way before i ever ever started a minister my mom at one time just opened up and told me she says well son we determined we're going to have four children now you sisters that have struggled with these things i think you'll understand my mama said you know what your daddy and i made a decision we're gonna have four children obviously time previous to me my mom was carrying a baby girl and it dies heartbroken she thought oh two boys two girls this will be lovely that little girl dies my mama looked me in the face when i was actually pretty young not even serving the lord and she said when you were born i named you paul daniel and i told people my son will be a preacher my brother and sister i just hope those words are just family things right i don't make a big deal out of that but you see god as a program amen why my mom had that revelation i don't know how when where or why it come to her if she was grasping at straws or it was something that struck her in the soul but she went from grieving over that and she had a little baby boy i think my sister susan never forgave me she was looking forward to having a baby sister hallelujah and when i was a little kid she tried to dress me up in tutus and everything else but praise the lord you see it's been god all along you see the church is ordained it's not by chance saints sister emmy would you come the church is not by chance to carry on this work the church is ordained that's you and i you're ordained you are ordained of almighty god to carry on his work with the same spirit come on not a denominational spirit not a haughty spirit not a whatever spirit not a depressed spirit the same spirit you could carry on the same work without the same spirit now i'm gonna i'm gonna drop my little nuclear device there's way too many people packing this message around and i don't say this judgmental it's the word of god i'll stand on it till the sun comes up or goes down it's too many people carrying the word of god and they have the wrong spirit they're building kingdoms on earth everything or i i'm speaking hard my brother and sister i know that but i just want you to reflect on this the very things the prophet of god said was not to be big churches fancy churches wealth of the all of these things and it's popping up in our midst but you see we can't carry on the same work without the same spirit that's right the same spirit carries on the word oh god we'll stop right there amen i say tonight my heart's cry saints tonight lord let my spirit reflect your spirit amen can you from your heart acknowledge that and say lord that's where i'm at lord i want my spirit to reflect your spirit i don't want to reflect laodicea i don't want to reflect the spirit of denomination i don't want to reflect somebody who thinks he's better than anyone else i want to be humbled by the word of god just as our lord jesus was when he submitted himself lord thy will be done oh my brother and sister you know as well as i do how hard it is to humble ourselves that way let's just stand and worship the lord for just a moment or two here before we go hallelujah i'm sorry i meant to be finished already please forgive me my brother and sister this word is going to deliver you and i from this world hallelujah i will praise him i will praise him praise the lamb for sinner slain [Music] just worship him tonight saints hallelujah [Music] we'll praise him we'll pray the lamb for sinners [Music] oh give him glory [Music] for his blood has washed away each day and when i saw the cleansing fountain for all my [Music] oh when he said without [Music] praise him will praise him [Music] praise [Music] for his washed away each day and though my way [Music] was swept away [Music] wishes [Music] oh i will praise him yes i will praise [Music]

for sinners o give him glory all ye people for his blood has washed away each day hallelujah can we just bless the name of the lord tonight lord we thank you father your grace and your mercy to us father lord you've brought our eyes not to the image of this world father we see in your word lord how it was they tried to raise up the very image of a prophet and get the people to worship that image but oh god you're faithful and true lord and father we thank you for the word of the prophet lord we thank you for the life that you've given us but lord we have been taught by the original word that the only image we hold before us is the image of our lord jesus christ oh lord let that always be the image lord that we look to let that be the life-giving source for us father we ask that your holy spirit would move down in the midst of this church father and those that would be associated and on the periphery of this church lord let it not be that we would ever boast of ourselves but lord let us boast of you o boast of the glory and the grace and the mercy of our god oh father as we lift father lord keep our hearts soft keep us tender let our light shine father lord let the image of the light of this gospel shine brightly in the age we were called to oh hallelujah lord i thank you for your word oh lord we come short we ask you father forgive us lord when we come short but lord i say let that be the only image that we would hold before us in this day lord not of a great man not of a priest but of the high priest christ jesus oh how we love you how we love you lord jesus hallelujah as we'd be dismissed here let's just sing this little course consider yourself dismissed thank you lord i think it does us good saints whether you're sitting most you don't have an opportunity to sit in a tractor it's a wonderful place to praise the lord nobody can hear what key you're in hallelujah you just get to enter into a realm all by yourself and no distractions be able
