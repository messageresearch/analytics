to be here this evening we uh it's glad to see all your smiling faces brother Paul make sure thank him for us being here tonight we're we seem to be traveling a lot even when we're at home we uh and then between some of the things my wife's been quite sick quite ill looks like here we were are with the electronics again here's my electronics expert back there and is that okay is that better better worse okay how's that so but she's been really sick do remember her she was pretty much over something and then they didn't quite get all the infection gone so she was wanting to be here tonight but not sure she was just up for sitting I think she slept the whole afternoon so praise the Lord she's getting better and for me now if I stop and look at you funny it's uh since I saw you last we uh had new lenses put in these here eyeballs and it's kind of like wow look at all the colors and wow it's bright in here I almost need my son glasses and uh so and but we're happy the because the the the other physician man that we go to for the eyes when he tested us he asked us to uh you know read the they put the chart thing up there and they got you in that machine and they tell you you know read the furthest line down and well I started picking letters out of the bottom line and he said you missed one out of whatever it was eight or 10 and he said do you know he kept saying using the word amazing and I said why do you keep saying that he said well because usually it takes about six weeks before people can see the top line so the Lord has done a very nice work and it's wow it's nice to see you I thought I thought the world would everything had turned brown and yellow and it really hasn't so not to keep you standing I I had uh Isa said you can bring it up on the word let's turn uh to Second Timothy the 3r chapter and we'll start about the 16th verse and then we'll get you seated here been studying a lot of things at with the little group there in Tri Cities and they would send their greetings to you tonight and uh say a healthy God bless you and I know Jose would like to get back over this way sometime not too distant future so uh 2 Timothy 3 and verse 16 uh all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable for Doctrine uh for Doctrine for reproof for correction or instruction in righteousness that the man of God might be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works and then let's turn to Psalms 51 very familiar scripture we have the song that we sing out of these verses and it reads uh we'll start with verse uh n is what I have written here uh hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation uphold me with thy free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee and I'm going to read one more hopefully we'll get this far and it's from job and again it's a familiar scripture I'm sure to most of us uh and it's where job has been going through the trials and the struggles and all the things that job went through and uh wow when anytime I think I'm having trouble and struggles go back and read the book of job because it's uh kind of a tough spot there in life for him except for I didn't even somehow I'm missing it here what did I do with it oh there we go okay got stuck behind Nehemiah there I know it's right ahead of Psalms okay okay and this was again a for familiar verse it's in chapter 19 praise the Lord and this is where job after he's been going through all these struggles and he turns to his friends and uh starting there in verse uh 22 he says why do you persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pen and led in the rock forever for I know that my redeemer liveth and he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though the after the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I shall see God and we could keep going it's so beautiful gracious Heavenly Father we've read a great portion of your scripture this evening and what I'm asking father is that you would bring something that would draw these people closer to you that would refill their lives with a desire with a hope with a cause with a with a Faith Lord the faith of Jesus Christ for thou art the word Lord and faith comes by hearing the word so let the Word of Life Jesus Christ come forth the evening and fill the hearts of your people we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen please be seated as we looked at these things and been looking at them for a while uh different things there in Timothy we'll start back where we started there in Timothy because it gives us a real insight to the scripture gives us something that we can understand I know brother brandham I was looking it up today and uh uh he said that uh oh back in 1957 there was a message that he was preaching where he said that every prophecy he used the word prophecy there instead of scripture but he said every prophecy has compound meaning we know that every scripture is essentially a prophecy or a a coming forth an inspiration from the Lord and it has compound meaning and then again in 1965 he said said that history always repeats itself yeah and he said that every scripture or or in scripture has compound meaning and this time he adds another word compound meaning and compound Revelation so as we begin to look at scripture we think of it and and one of the words there if we were to look at the definition when it uses uh inspiration I believe it is it's that word that it's uh the well let me I better go back I want to get this right because it what it said it calls it that it's uh I'm not going to get the word right yet here are we lord Jesus if you want to go a different way take me now okay but it's what it actually is it means that when it comes forth it has stacked meanings it's like it's as in there's a floor underneath this carpet well the carpet superimposition there it is it's superimposed and okay so on top of the floor is this carpet and it has a time and a place where it's being used and on top of the carpet we have what we call a Pulpit so it's superimposed upon the carpet which is superimposed upon the floor then we have on top of that we have tonight we have a Bible That's superimposed closed up on top of the pulpit that's on top of the carpet that's on top of the you understand but then there's something even beyond that because part of this superimposition is tonight there is a breath of life that is bringing a life that's superimposed in this word to you and the scripture is in the same form it's has superimpositions of things that can be be and it says time and space when you look up that word and so it's you know there's a time and a space that the carpet wasn't there but now it's there and now it's being used and there's a time and a place when the pulpits used but there's times when it's not used and there's times when we should be in this a lot where it's being used but the real thing behind it is the life or the Breath of God which is part of that where it says all scripture is by inspiration that word let's look at it because the word scripture there actually means to write or to grave or engrave to describe and inscribe or to document something so in other words there's something you know there's something happening tonight going on here and that we have all these superimpositions going on and yet behind that there's somebody back there probably got a recorder going that's documenting this service and even beyond that there is a God in heaven that's documenting every thought everything that's in our hearts everything that's in our mind he knows it all and it's all being documented in a word somewhere because he said he documents these things by his word but there's a couple things that aren't being documented or written tonight and that's your sin the Lord if it's conf if it's been confessed he said blessed is the man to whom God imputes not iniquity or or sin because it's also been documented that he said once it's confessed he drops it into the sea of God's forgetfulness and it's no longer remembered it's as though it never happened the example of course I think we might have said this before but brother brand said you take the uh the the eye dropper and you put all your sin in there and boy it looks terrible and he said there's a big tub of bleach and when you drop that sin into that bleach he said that bleach is so powerful that it breaks down the elements of that ink he said use ink and if if it breaks he said it breaks down the elements to to it's as though it never existed that's the blood of Jesus Christ it makes it so your sin my sin our iniquities never existed and even God can't see something that never existed compound meaning compound Revelation and so there in the well we better get into this says all scripture and and that's what it means and it's also uses the word holy RIT it can be written it can be Graven we realize that we read there from job and it said oh that my words were Graven with an iron pen hopefully Lord will bring us back to that but also in the Old Testament I think believe it's Levi Leviticus 7 when it talks about the high priest and the at the ending of the sacrifice and he's G he's changed His Garment he's gone out he's dumped the ashes he goes back into the sanctuary and as he leaves the sanctuary the Bible said that the skin from the sacrifice that the high priest made that be becomes his the rest of the sacrifice belong to the people because it's separated it's cut and it's all done with all those things and it's and it's cooked and it's all dispersed among the people but the last thing when he leaves the sanctuary he picks up the skin it belongs to him I think it's I believe Leviticus 7 around verse 8 somewhere in there it said the skin belongs to the high priest and so we we look at that and it's kind of like the carpet that was it's there I can kind of all these things with that carpet but that's just the beginning of what's actually there because we realize that Jesus Christ is the high priest of our confession and it's the high priest that makes the sacrifice and it was called there in that same passage there in Leviticus 7 It's the Most Holy sacrifice who's the most holy Jesus Christ he's the most holy he's the sacrifice itself the lamb he's not just that but he's also the the dividing of the portion he's also the skin in which the high priest takes was when Christ had gone through this sacrifice so he's the high priest he's the lamb he's the dividing of the portion he said this is my body it's broken for you here eat so he's the broken portion of the body and he's also the high priest that goes out Beyond The Sanctuary he's also what's left of the sacrifice in those ashes that's why job went to the ash Heap it was all he had to show Satan took everything he had took his family took his ox and took his sheep took everything everything everything and so when and then smote his body and the only only thing he had left was where did he go he went to the ash Heap because that's the only thing he had that he could sit there and say I know I did what God commanded me to do and so he sat on the ash Heap because that was all he had left of his sacrifice and so when the high priest they go and they get when they pick up that skin what did they use the skin for do you ever think about it in the Old Testament before they had books like we have in these days and printed with lead they had little tools and the priests would take and they would have their portions of the words and they would literally chisel the word of God into those skins and then roll them into Scrolls so it was the the word of God inside the scroll written by the high priest do you understand amen it's Jesus Christ written inside the scroll rolled out before us and so so every scripture man I only got to the first word is spoken by inspiration I still I can read the little words pretty good but with the different light I'm still learning how to use these lenses okay so in Timothy there better put that in line where it says that every scripture is written by inspiration whoops I had the wrong time okay please forgive me tonight I'm a little slow I guess all scripture is given by inspiration of God in that word inspiration it means to be divinely breathed upon or to to divinely breathe it's just to take a breath to let air come out from in this case it's God it's uh it's by the inspiration of God and remember also that you know not so much in the Greek because I think it reads the same direction as English but as we get into some of these other scriptures we're talking about remember that the Hebrew read from right to left and it'll become important you'll see it a few minutes Lord willing and so it said by inspiration and other words it was divinely breathed from God it was set forth and it also means to blow on something it also means to just a breeze or a wind and it also means if you look at it there's a scripture that means to breathe hard or to forcefully breathe but it also when you think about it and how this relates to other scriptures when it says his fan is in his hand so we begin to see that this Breath of God has an expression because what's behind the breath what does the breath represent to us amen thank you for everybody who said that because you take the life out of the body it's dead so what he's telling us that every script scripture has the life or the inspiration or the Breath of God behind it it has the power to breathe life when somebody dies what's the you know on the ambulance shows up or whoever's on there I saw a picture here A guy got electrocuted and it showed the picture of his buddy there you know giving him CPR right there while he's still hanging from the power line because he had to get breath into him the guy lived the breath of God is in these scriptures every scripture has the Breath of God behind it and it's superimposed it has compound meaning has compound revelation we you know back to to Leviticus 7 he's in every piece of that and the life of God is in every piece of that whole section of scripture it's all Jesus Christ and I was there's a place I uh I want to say it's in this day this scripture for fulfilled but I might have wrote that down wrong but it's uh brother ROM said people aren't getting through to Christ he said because if they were getting through to Christ they wouldn't be doing the things they're doing well but we have carpet in our house we have furniture on the carpet we can sit on the furniture with the life is supposed to be in you the person that's sitting on the furniture not even so much this as the life or the soul scripture calls it the nature of God should be living out of this book into what we call the Bride of Jesus Christ it's superimposed within us is the life of Christ through the air we breathe through the air he breathed into us by way of the scripture and he so it it continues there and it says the first thing it mentions is Doctrine and I thought this was really interesting because when I look this up it means to learn to teach but what it actually brings into it is the next word that it used in the definition is the instructor so it's not just when we think of Doctrine it's not just like a story or uh uh of something that we believe well women shouldn't wear pants that's just we call it Rema or written word there should be a life behind the woman that doesn't choose to do that that chooses to wear the dress and it's not just your life who's the instructor well when you go to the instructor what do we find there's a whole list of verses there Matthew 311 Luke 7 3:17 Matthew and so on where there's all these scriptures that Jesus said I'll send you an instructor it's called the Holy Ghost so it's the personality or the soul which is the nature brother brandom called the soul the nature it's the nature behind the god that's superimposed through through this book that should be coming across this Pulpit that should be living in our lives that should be expressing Jesus Christ because it's been super imposed within us by the Breath of God by the Breath of God from out of the ELO we sang Elohim out of that self-existent one he poured his breath into Isaiah we turned our backs on him we we he was be he was beaten he was uh you know all the things that he poured his breath into Ezekiel he poured his breath into Abraham so much that Abraham's life life you know Abraham through the scripture he didn't really say a whole lot when you compare him to the other prophets there's not a whole lot that it says that Abraham said but his life was the testimony of the Breath of God the soul of God so much so that God said we are Abraham's seed the seed of Abra raam's life and if you go to Romans 4:17 I believe it is it said he called those things which are not as though they are that's the soul that's the heart that's the lifebeat the Breath of God being expressed through that man superimposed and put into a document we call the Bible but there's a life and a SW in nature that lives through that so it's not just doctrines that we believe well we believe in water baptism what we believe in oh you got to have this you got to we don't believe the Trinity we all those things those are those are just outside the doctrine the foundation or the life behind it is why you get baptized or re-baptized or whatever it is it's the Breath of God speaking from his breath giving us CPR as it were because we are Bible says we're dead in Christ you are dead but our life is hid with Christ in God we are supposed to be dead not physically as we think of it because in Romans it says that you are a Living Sacrifice yeah a dead person a dead sacrifices are dead things but this dead thing is alive you are the dead thing that's alive isn't I what a paradox I love it because we're dead and our life is hid with Christ in God and it continues uh it says you know okay he it's the instructor himself a doctor a master a teacher and it's also then the What comes forth from the teacher Dr master and the next word it used there is is reproof which means it gives proof how many times do we hear in the prophet's message where he would talk about you know that and he would go into the vision and he would tell the person whatever their problem was whatever the need was and he would say that's the proof that Jesus Christ is here that's proof that he's the same yesterday today and forever and he said it's also the the conviction or the evidence it's evidence when we think about evidence well I don't know if we any of the Perry Mason fans when you were younger or older how whatever you know they always had to have even in the courts today they're supposed to have evidence that can either condone or you know or can get the person out or get the person in so it's a a sign a reproof when it talks about that's an Evidence so much so that you know that faith is the substance of things hoped for but faith is the evidence of what we can't see it's the evidence and I think you know we I was talking with a uh brother there brother in Ireland and and we were just kind of going through some things and how that I hope there's enough evidence in my life that if I was accused of being a Christian I could be convicted and not thrown out and how that we become the evidence by the life that's been breathed into US yes by the scripture and it goes on it means to confute in other words when somebody comes at you or whatever you can refute or confute say no that's not and when even when the enemy the devil whatever what you want to call you know because it can come through people it can come through Satan himself attacking the mind you have the power through this life through the scriptures to fight the devil to fight or refute whatever he's trying to lie to you out it's part of this that's part of reproof a convinc convict or convince rebuke rep reprove so forth the next word he used there was correction I loved this because it takes us into a really nice deep spot in this superimposition cuz correction in itself is a compound word says it's a compound and it means to rectify or make things right or to straighten up I don't know if I brought it with me tonight I usually I did this was a a a photograph and I I know we've done this before and it appeared in Life Magazine like this and to rectify what this photo was it takes a prophet's the it took the word of a prophet to rectify it or to turn it straight up and when we turn it straight up we know what it is it's the Supreme judge it's Jesus with the the beard he said see the beard see the eyes I know it's small for you but I know yall have seen that before but it was correction he corrected the position by telling you turn it to the right how you know or turn it he said this way on the tape but to do it you have to turn it to the right and this is where it really comes in with the word superimposition of time place order distribution means to straighten up to lift up to set up or to make straight wow all of a sudden this word correction takes on a whole new superimposition because to make straight when John the Baptist was on the scene what was he doing it said to make your ways straight what was he doing he was rectifying because it also means and because it said it's a compound word there it also means to straighten up lift up set up I said that okay the reputation or repetition that's in it intensity is in it or reversal what's he talking about reversal well if we're going a certain way there's a I love it there's a song they sing in Madagascar when my daughter was with me there and they talk about going down the Garden Path and everybody's going this way and the whole church gets up and they're kind of singing and dancing this way and then they said and then God cames and we reverse well my daughter of course she doesn't understand malagasy so she's still going this way and everybody's going the other way and they spin her around but it's a reversal from what happened in the Garden of Eden that's correction God is correcting Us by repetition as we begin to put this together he's correcting by repetition because Isaiah we're seeking that rest of God yes I want to go in I'm I'm part of that perfect rest and how do we get there Isaiah said it's it's line upon line line upon line it's precept upon precept and precept upon precept here a little there a little it's a repetition of breathing that keeps you alive amen the Breath of God doesn't just come once and it's over friends it's in every day every hour every moment experience that we have with Jesus Christ it's also as a mountain lifted up above the Plains and the mountains shall be brought down and the plains shall be brought up and so it's speaking also written in that one word is the ministries of Elijah the five ministries of Elijah in one word what a God what a what a amazing the inspiration of God could breathe these things into these Scriptures it also means to tutor train discipline to be the child of a king how do we get there by repetition and by intensity wow and the next word it used there was righteousness I believe is that how it said there uh 16 for correction for instruction in righteousness instruction in in righteousness and when it gets to that word it comes from the word equal or to make equal and again all of a sudden we find this compound meaning this superimposition of line upon line line upon line and so forth because to be equal it means Equity of character equal character Equity of character Justified innocent holy just judgment to show Justice or even punishment it's all in that word he has given us that we can be to have the same character as Jesus Christ equal character because the same holy ghost that raised up or brought Jesus Christ on the scene the birth of Jesus was on this wise and the Holy Ghost had overshadowed Mary when she said how can this happen I've never known a man he said the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and you'll bring forth a son that Holy Ghost that brought forth that son the male portion of God is now his his seed the seed of Jesus Christ is now being poured out through his word through his breath through his soul through his life that he can produce other Sons and Daughters of God as it's written he's the firstborn among many Brethren it's the Holy Ghost he's producing that in you in a way of righteousness and it also means upright and hurry right back to this photo again turn the P the picture upright who's in there wow and there's people that yeah I better not go that route thank you sister for in going beyond the camp 1964 he said that he kind of gave four stages uh he said God revealed who he was he revealed by the seals how he redeemed the Earth he Redeemed by the name of Jesus Christ and the last thing he mentioned was to take the fear away from people that's how how he brings Redemption he tells us who he is reveals what his Plan of Redemption was through the seals of the church it's all by the name of Jesus Christ which the name and the word you've heard that before I'm sure on tape are the same thing so he does it by his word to take the fear out of us so we can step into the position that he has created us or is creating us to become praise the lord well we read also from so let's just take a look at maybe Psalms 51 again and see how this works with everyday scriptures that we read we sing we think about I think about all the time maybe I don't know I speak for myself I guess I I'd like to believe that other people do this where he says create you he says blot out all mine iniquities well we could go instantly then to acts 3:19 where it says until the days are refreshing and your sins be blotted out but we'll skip over that because it's a whole another Direction but in verse 11 he says cast me not away from thy presence take uh or I'm sorry verse 10 create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me now remember this is in Hebrew and this is written by the I believe the king of Israel they say this was the psalm that came to David after he' made the mistake with ba Sheba he says create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me but if we're going to read this backwards the way the Hebrew writes it within me renew a right Spirit oh God or we could say oh God within me renew a right spirit is that yeah within me a right Spirit oh God or with the little you know the dots there oh God within me renew our right Spirit where does this come from it's not just floating around out in the universe he says within me within us is the power for God to renew a spirit right yes amen and then again oh God a clean heart create in me or in me create create a clean heart oh God created in me again in me create he's asking for the creative power of God that's within him to renew his spirit because his Spirit got kind of wacky he shouldn't have took her as far as the law was concerned and he surely shouldn't have killed her husband really Let's Get Serious no Thou shalt not kill you know the laws and things brother brandham said that when the the prophet came to him and and gave him the story of the sheep why did he give him the story of the sheep because David knew sheep he'd been a Shepherd boy and he knew how important that one sheep was because he fought a lion to go get one sheep took the Sheep I think it's out of his mouth that's a pretty important sheep fought a bear he did these things and so the prophet came to him because he knew that you know God knew that David knew sheep and he knew the value of one sheep you think you don't have value tonight the Lord if he did if David did that for one sheep and now he's saying where did it come from within me it's within me amen within me God make my spirit right again oh God create thou power of creation thou creator of heavens and earth will you not in me create a clean heart oh my do you see the implications but there's even more because we we understand this was David he got himself in trouble and all that but it's also something else if you go back to 1 Samuel believe it's 16th chapter do you love him is this I'm just kind of grabbing it not that's not the right way to say it I'm just wanting to share some things with you that the Lord Lord has just been quickening to me that means so much to me at the very start when it talks about well if we could you could even go back to I believe it's Leviticus 17 something when it God tells them when you go into the land you're going to want a king but he said it'll be the king of my choosing where did they goof up well they chose their own King in Saul oh man look at him he looks pretty neat man he's bigger than everybody and no but God had told them in the law in Leviticus it'll be my choosing so God wants to choose a king here and in 16 verse1 the Lord said unto Samuel how long will you mourn after Saul seeing I have rejected him I have rejected him from reigning over Israel fill thine horn with oil and go and I will send thee to Jesse the bethleem might for I have provided me a king among his sons so who's the king who is the king that's going to live in David so then we go back to Psalms 51 and what do we see well oh it's so full of types and shadows here I mean you go drop back up and it says Purge me with hup do you know what hup is you all been to Israel hup is a it's a common weed you can find it pretty much anywhere but they were told to strike the post of the door with it did you know that it's a natural antiseptic one of the strongest uh antiseptics that you can find so when he says Purge me with hisp well and then you have Jesus Christ I mean see all all these superimpositions in the scripture he's saying Purge me with it's talking about Christ because Christ is the king that's reigning in David and so here he says created me a clean heart re you know renew it right Spirit the one that's within me bring it out now by the power of creation and all of these things are are coming down and cast me not away from thy presence take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me and so on it's all pointing us to Jesus Christ it's all pointing us to Jesus Christ and how that he is the one that gives us the right Spirit he the God within us brother Ram said in one place pray to the god that's within you we're not to try to call him down from heaven or bring him up from the grave it says in another Psalm Because He Lives within you and so we look at that and there's another place where it talks about David and maybe we covered this before in in chapter 21 of 1 Samuel remember it's God living in David that brings that and yet we look at David and we think wow now wait a minute this is their next king and he's hiding in the back of a cave from the whole Army of Israel and afraid to go out of the cave at first what is it it's a type and a shadow of Christ hiding in the grave from Israel hiding from Israel until they're time comes hiding in the Tomb God hiding in the Tomb from the armies of Israel oh my what's going on over there right now I just my warped sense of humor I just wondering when the Arabs are going to shoot a rocket and knock down that Mosque of Omar by mistake that's just my idea you know you can delete that from your but the prophet did say he thought Israel would rebuild their Temple and that thing's still in the way Israel won't knock it down but if they did hey it's out of the way now just a thought maybe it's a wish I don't [Laughter] know but so in so in 1st Samuel 21 we're familiar with this David go goes to the high priest for food who's the high priest we know it's Jesus Christ and so he goes to the high priest and the high priest says you know hey he's kind of worried at this point how come you're alone and it looks like David lies because said the king's business required haste and he well he's not talking about Saul or Saul's business the king's business required haste and so he and you know how he asked for food and they said the only food I have is that of the shoe bread and he gives it to David and that's in verse six and then when he comes down David in verse eight asks the himc that's the high priest is there not a here under thine hand a sword or a spear for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the B he repeats it here the king's business required haste so here he is asking the high priest do you have a spear do you have a sword is there anything here that you have and the priest says the sword of Goliath the philistine whom you slew in the valley of elaw behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod that's 1st Samuel 21:9 if you want to put it up for the folks there in the valley of elaw behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod now as we think about this and I think we might have touched on this once before again we have a superimposition because they would hang the ephod on the Altar and and behind the ephod was the Altar and but he says he he makes the statement here uh you'll find it in a cloth behind the ephod which is on the altar or and it's actually it's inside the alter he said and and it's wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod so in behind that ephod inside of that altar you have this uh sword as it were and it's it's wrapped and I'm thinking you know it was pretty sharp it was goliaths Who David took which that's another whole message going that way about Goliath and why the sword he had the sword but so he takes this sword and he has to unwrap it and we we don't know how wrapped it was but it was wrapped and when he takes that wrapped sword I'll put it back sorry it said that it's behind the epod if you will take it take it take that one there's not another one that's the only one that's here and there's none like it it and David says give it to me who's living in David God said I'll become a king you know it says in the Book of Romans the seed of David were brought forth after the seed Christ was brought forth after the seed of David so David's life is a seed of God becoming King and we find it wrapped in a swaddling cloth behind the altar we know that David was from Bethlehem and we go to Luke the 2 chapter and watch the heart because the sword is also represents the heart it was in it was behind what the ephod what did the ephod represent it was the Judgment seat because when a prophet he came forth on that ephod were those stones the uran Thum were there and when they would speak their prophecy if the lights didn't line up they killed that guy and behind that judgment seat was a sword and that sword was wrapped and in Luke the 2 chapter we find a wrapped sword again For unto you is born this day well I'll I better jump up one be and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord if you go back to two and verse 4 it tells us that that uh city of David is Bethlehem so we find in he said and this shall be a sign under you you shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths lying in a Manger where is it found it's found in the house of God's bread God's in the house of God's bread you're going to find a sign of a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and the word of God is called the the sword the word of God Hebrews 4 I think it's 12 if I remember right for the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword and it cuts from the the marrow from the joints first level not just natural Doctrine but it goes then it goes into the realm of the spirit and then it goes into the realm of the S of the Soul and behind the soil is a life that's manifested by the Breath of God because every scripture is given to us under inspiration of God and you shall find and what David got and David says give it to me it's God in David showing himself how he gets to be the king he comes wrapped in a cloth the word has been bound in a cloth and now it's released and there's your sign Shepherds I hope you understand Jesus Christ is in every scripture somehow some way and brother brand said after the seals of you don't see it go back and read it I liked what brother Stan said it's like the old Indian you know Indian walk them once look them nine times well that's how it is with God so we understand that it it's a prophecy of God be taking his position as the word of God but in the beginning was the word word was with God I know you're familiar with that and the word became flesh the life behind the sword the word was made flesh and found wrapped in a swaddling cloth let's close Job chapter 19 this thrilled my soul when I saw this I praise the Lord because I've read this probably a few hund maybe a hundred times maybe more probably more over all the years Job chapter 19 and we know that job automatically is becomes a type in a shadow of Christ because of the things he went through and such and uh how that at some point there he comes down to verse 22 and he's asking his friends why do you persecute me as God are you not satisfied with my flesh can you imagine Jesus hanging on Calvary and here they are continuing to persecute him they're smiting that rock that Moses smote with their spear with their and so on and so he said you know aren't you satisfied with what I look like because they couldn't even remember the guys when the when his friends first came they couldn't even recognize him and they stood a far off and they're going man is that job I I I can't even imagine what the guy must have looked like so he starts that then he but then he says oh that my words were were written oh that they were printed in a book well we know that when you believe a prophet you get a prophet's reward and we've talked I know we talked about this once before tonight you are the recipients of a prophet's reward because job is saying I want my words written I want them printed in a book they didn't use books back then they used them they used the Scrolls and stuff and so tonight we are the recipients we are receiving the reward of the words of a prophet yeah I heard one and I'm not worried if you don't say amen I I was telling brother Paul know maybe it was brother J.R we were talking and he said brother Sergeant told me a long time ago don't worry brother if they don't say Amen cuz he raised sheep when he was a kid sheep Never Bleed when they're feeding so don't worry about it brother so it's okay he said oh that they were printed a book but now and we've covered that before but then he with this one that they were Graven with an iron pan and lead in the rock forever remember we started back there with what was the where it talked about under inspiration and Doctrine and and how that it was an engraving an engraving and he's saying that my words were Graven with an iron pen Lord Jesus help me now well we understand what the word what iron represents because if you've ever heard uh you know Daniel 70 weeks and how that the you know there was the Beast and there was the head of gold Babylon and then there was Assyria and Egypt and going down and the legs were iron and it represented you know I think it's pag Pagan in Papa Rome so it had two manifestations and it goes down into the feet this is this part's already fulfilled I saw the pictures when I was a little kid we had one of those little little tiny televisions when a Cru jef which means uh clay beat his feet on the or his shoe on the desk at the United Nations s and Eisenhower means iron and he said we'll bury you and that was those two feet iron or the toes in such the iron and Clay it's already been fulfilled people and it's after that that the stone he without hands comes on the scene and smashes the whole thing what do you think is happening right now every word that you reive tonight do you know is destroying the rest of this world because you're Sons and Daughters of God and we have received the stone not made with hands but made by the Breath of God oh that they were Graven with an iron pen well we know Graven and what it means and it means you know like to to Chisel out it can also mean to be printed there there's different kind of things that went with it but when it comes to this word iron we know it represents Rome and we know that it was Rome that put the uh the spikes in the hands of Jesus and the feet of Jesus we know it was Rome who stuck the spear in his side and where it says iron pen the word I'll go to pen first then we'll come back it's a it's a an iron stylus with a diamond tip to write on Stone or metal to write on Stone who were they sticking those iron pegs into the Rock of Ages friends they were riding on the stone but there's another superimposition that's hidden in here do you love him tonight I I love him I just I get amazed actually yeah amazed and so it's an iron stylus with a diamond tip and we've heard brother banam talk about the diamond that's on the record player and how the diamond is such a perfect uh thing to resonate the sound or the little grooves that are on that record so that's with an iron pen which is it's a writing instrument and it also said it's a read pen that's they Ed to write on Scrolls and when they came to Jesus and ask him about John the Baptist he goes what you what' you guys go out to see a reed shaken in the wind yeah that's more we won't go there but you understand and so with an iron pen and then another it's in Hebrew as I understand it every letter has a meaning I know that every letter has a number because their alphabet is their is the same as their numeric system and we understand that because we've been told 50 represents Jubilee 13 represents the US 13th chapter Revelation so forth five represents Grace Three represents Perfection all those things will for them when you read the word there's more there's that's why so many are in compound and it comes here there's another meaning part of that word that means to scream or to sh shriek to cry out what's the last thing that our Rock Christ Jesus did before he died because he was being Graven with an iron pen but there's yet one more little thing in that word iron the actual definition is or the way I believe the way they say it is Barelle and it actually means like the house of iron and so and it also comes down and it It's Made It iron it comes from Iron Ore they made furniture with it we still make furniture they made insulant they made utensils tools of iron but also the life behind the iron is harshness strength and oppression H and that comes from another word called beer I'm probably saying this wrong they'd laugh at me beerav and it means means the leanness of the choice Olive what's the leanness mean with the olive plant it's the first fruit because it hasn't had time to get fat and the iron is an instrument that's used to pierce holes to strike the Olive and knock the seed out one word iron means it's a tool to strike the lean Olive and knock the seed out why is that important Jesus said My Flesh profits nothing and except I Lay My Life down you could not have the seed of the word in the form of the Holy Ghost because the next thing they do with that Olive is they squeeze out the oil superimposed from the iron he said I Lay My Life down so that we can have life so that the seed can be planted and bring forth again you love him I love him every word compound meaning compound Revelation Doctrine reproof correction instruction in righteousness let's stand praise the lord lord Jesus I do indeed thank you tonight I thank you because no one knows what the next breath will be the world is working hard towards blowing itself to bits the LGB whatever people are working hard to find to see this nation burned because the seventh Vision was and is coming to pass as it was in the days of Sodom which was burned we understand these things I I to a certain amount I understand them I don't understand why people would want to do that because you were so gracious to give me the seed of the word of God and tonight I believe you've given that seed to these that are gathered before us and perhaps many online I I don't I don't know but you know so we come before you tonight and and Lord anything that might have set a skew or out of out of the way I know if you can create a bleach so powerful that it the things of sin or the mistakes we make are not even never existed anything Lord tonight that's not of you that never existed then just blot it out of their minds father blot it out of this message in such a way that it's just forgotten but those things that are right of righteousness and Truth inscribe it into their softened hearts Lord their hearts are soft tonight Lord I I can feel it from here Jesus and by your power of creation manifest as the whole creation Waits and groans for the manifestations to wit of the sons and the daughters of God we come in Jesus Christ's name amen beautiful brother

from your presence where does the refreshing I believe it's acts 3:19 says that comes from the presence of the Lord the restoration again it talks about and how that here he is prophesying of his own life but it's the life of God speaking out through David unto a people that can say don't please don't take me out of your presence because I need that refreshing I need that Breath of Life and cast

evening thank you brother Paul for the invite thanks you son for the leading to the songs and we uh probably won't see you for a little while we keep trying to get to see the other the southern half of our family uh and do keep us in prayer I will be going to New Finland in uh the 1st of November I believe it is for some meetings there and as soon as I get back I promised a little lady that she's from Guana north of South America there originally but they lived in Panama when I met him and now she's getting married in Honduras and I'll give you just a quick story because we we going to do her wedding she's in her 20s I suppose and she and her dad you know she's still at home and so there's some conflict and so there was you know I didn't know what was going on exactly because it's half in Spanish and her dad just turned her name is anelsa he goes anelsa you're so stubborn and she kind of walked up when before we left she pulled me aside and she said Brother David do you think I'm stubborn I looked at her and I said no sister I don't think it's stubborn I said I think it's tenacious she goes tenacious she looked at me and I said like Hannah in the temple she wasn't being stubborn to the high priest she was being tenacious because she had a desire she wanted met the prophet is she had a desire that she wanted met and so I just you know the next time I saw her I said oh it's sister tenacious and uh she likes it because she always sends me a little smiley face every time and so out of the blue here I hadn't heard from her for a while she said will you come to Honduras for my wedding I couldn't turn her down she's tenacious so God bless you and thank you bless amen love the presence of the Lord hallelujah song just came to me was uh let your word be [Music] born was
