[31:59] for the majesty and power of this
[32:06] kingdoms King has gone
[32:10] and this kingdoms reign and his kingdom
[32:15] through and this kingdoms power and
[32:20] authority Jesus God's righteousness

[32:55] Wow

[33:49] through and this kingdom power and
[33:54] authority Jesus God's righteousness
[34:06] [Music]
[34:11] well god bless you Saints we're
[34:15] certainly living in different times
[34:18] sometimes we just have to stop and
[34:21] almost pinch ourselves to realize this
[34:23] is the reality of the day that we're
[34:27] living in and the things that are
[34:30] happening around us but you know the
[34:32] beauty of it is that we are seeing the
[34:35] Word of God fulfilled right before our
[34:38] eyes and that is a wonderful thing
[34:41] because as the scripture declares that
[34:43] when Satan comes in like a flood that
[34:46] the Lord would raise up a standard and
[34:49] we're not looking for something to stop
[34:51] what is happening in this present world
[34:54] but the standard is being raised in the
[34:56] bride of Jesus Christ that she can stand
[34:59] upon the word and withstand it and as we
[35:02] look this evening into our thought I
[35:06] believe you'll enjoy the very closing
[35:09] quote that we will share tonight let's
[35:13] just stand to our feet if we would and
[35:15] turn to matthew the twenty-fourth
[35:17] chapter we're looking at a time here
[35:20] you'll just have to be patient with us
[35:22] as brother Jason has said the state has
[35:25] declared that they want all facilities
[35:29] closed down meetings to to not exist but
[35:35] we are just here believing this is what
[35:38] the Lord has called us to do to be able
[35:41] to encourage you while we can't gather
[35:43] together we can come together by this
[35:47] use of technology and so as we turn to
[35:50] Matthew 24 starting with the 21st verse
[35:53] we'll just go down to the twenty eighth
[35:56] verse
[35:57] were then shall be Great Tribulation
[36:00] such as was not since the beginning of
[36:03] the world to this time no nor ever shall
[36:06] be and except those days should be
[36:09] shortened there should be no flesh be
[36:11] saved but for the elects sake those days
[36:14] shall be shortened
[36:16] so God being mindful of us amen - to
[36:19] shorten the days then if any man shall
[36:22] say unto you lo here is Christ or there
[36:24] believe it not for there shall arise
[36:27] false Christ's and false prophets shall
[36:30] show great signs and wonders in so much
[36:33] that if it were possible and we have to
[36:35] always remember that portion of that
[36:38] verse if it were possible they shall
[36:41] deceive the very elect behold I have
[36:44] told you before wherefore if they shall
[36:47] say unto you behold he is in the desert
[36:49] go not forth behold he is in the secret
[36:52] chambers believe it not for his
[36:55] lightning cometh out of the east and
[36:57] Shina 'the even into the west so shall
[36:59] also the coming of the Son of man be for
[37:02] wheresoever the carcass is there will
[37:06] the eagle's be gathered together
[37:08] Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord
[37:10] for the opportunity to come and father
[37:13] while it might be by the use of
[37:14] technology father we can join together
[37:17] as saints of like precious faith and
[37:19] father the doors being opened Lord we
[37:22] just stand before you tonight just to
[37:24] speak your word we ask you Father to
[37:27] come and just give us unconfirmed the
[37:38] many needs that we have in the body have
[37:41] not gone away Lord since we are not
[37:42] together but father you are mindful of
[37:45] the needs of your children and we ask
[37:48] you to come tonight speak to our hearts
[37:50] may healing virtue flow Lord as we step
[37:53] forward father knowing that faith cometh
[37:55] by hearing a hearing of the word of God
[37:58] so were father we're looking tonight for
[38:00] a great increase in our economy father
[38:04] knowing that you are in our midst we
[38:06] thank you now in the name of Jesus
[38:08] Christ amen
[38:09] you may be seated
[38:11] you know it's very interesting as we
[38:14] would look at this to realize how the
[38:16] scripture has such an impact to some it
[38:20] is viewed as something judgemental many
[38:23] people say well you know don't don't
[38:26] judge me you know because the scripture
[38:28] says that you shouldn't judge but the
[38:30] scripture also shows us that we have to
[38:33] judge and so it's very interesting how
[38:35] the scripture can bring peace to one and
[38:38] fear to another now my brother and
[38:41] sister I believe it's just a lovely term
[38:44] that I have recently read and that says
[38:47] that purpose brings preparation so if we
[38:51] have a purpose we would then be prepared
[38:53] to fulfill or live out that purpose and
[38:57] I believe one of the first things as
[38:59] sons and daughters of God that we
[39:01] recognized and know what God has done as
[39:03] the prophet of God tells us that when we
[39:06] recognize who we are then is the time
[39:09] that we can become that invincible army
[39:12] so when we recognize who we are will
[39:14] recognize our purpose and to be able to
[39:17] live out the word in such a dark time in
[39:20] such a age of chaos a time that people
[39:23] are once again becoming afraid of the
[39:25] atomic reaction the atomic bomb and
[39:29] we're looking at the what they call
[39:31] superpowers and the friction that is
[39:33] there but my brother and sister we as
[39:36] sons and daughters of God recognize our
[39:38] purpose is to live the word for our day
[39:41] and so therefore we will be prepared to
[39:45] live that word we will not be sitting
[39:47] here just hoping for tomorrow but we can
[39:51] live with a certainty
[39:52] amen as we would look at verse 28 for
[39:56] just a moment I just want to bring this
[39:58] and how the beauty of this is in the
[40:01] scripture in verse 28 as we are looking
[40:04] it says for wheresoever the carcase is
[40:07] there will the eagle's be gathered
[40:10] together and I believe that's just a
[40:12] beautiful scripture because what it's
[40:15] speaking is to you and I my brother and
[40:17] sister that the the carcass is present
[40:20] the word has told us that that that will
[40:23] be present and
[40:25] so where the carcass is that's where you
[40:27] look to find the Eagles you don't go out
[40:30] here into the muck and the mire and the
[40:33] highway byway as it were in the filth of
[40:35] humanity and look for the eagle you look
[40:38] for the carcass you look for the bloody
[40:40] lamb the Word of God that was opened in
[40:43] our day and there's where you'll find
[40:45] Eagles you're not gonna find an eagle in
[40:47] the pub you're not gonna find them
[40:49] wandering the highways and byways as a
[40:51] bum but you're gonna find it that God
[40:53] calling out of those places brings
[40:55] together around the carcass of the
[40:57] bloody word the bloody lamb the Word of
[41:00] God and so there is something about that
[41:03] carcass that holds a supernatural
[41:06] attraction for a son or daughter of God
[41:09] now my brother and sister it's not just
[41:11] that we had no other Church or no other
[41:13] place to go but there is an attraction
[41:16] that God has placed in you just as it
[41:19] would be and that that metal would be
[41:22] attracted to a magnet we'll see how that
[41:25] the word for our hour is attracting of
[41:28] people now that word is not for everyone
[41:30] it as some people would be as a magnet
[41:33] upon aluminium or something of that
[41:35] nature
[41:36] there's simply no attraction but the
[41:39] bride of Jesus Christ has a supernatural
[41:42] attraction not just a man attraction not
[41:45] just a carnal attraction but a
[41:47] supernatural attraction and I want you
[41:50] to think of it my brother and sister
[41:52] there's something irresistible about the
[41:55] word to the bride of Jesus Christ she is
[41:59] not just hey I'm a Christian I go to
[42:01] church but there's something that's
[42:03] irresistible something compelling
[42:06] drawing her pulling her into the
[42:08] presence of God now it doesn't matter my
[42:11] brother and sister many people are
[42:13] concerned they'll say well this is just
[42:15] the start of our government controlling
[42:17] us and look how easy that is for them to
[42:21] shut everything down my brother and
[42:23] sister what it should be
[42:25] is us looking out there and saying this
[42:27] is something that should cause us to
[42:30] focus more intently on the things of God
[42:34] not something to to wring our hands
[42:37] and to be nervous and lose our sleep if
[42:40] we lose our sleep then let us lose it to
[42:43] prayer not to worry on cares of this
[42:46] life and but there's something about the
[42:48] word that is so irresistible my brother
[42:51] and sister now you see it is around this
[42:55] word of God that is attracting the
[42:57] Eagles it is not a social structure now
[43:00] my brother and sister they have phrased
[43:02] this thing's social distancing and
[43:04] whatnot you know how people just
[43:06] shouldn't get too close to others well
[43:09] my brother and sister the word says that
[43:11] we shouldn't be respecter of persons so
[43:13] take that in the natural we shouldn't
[43:15] become so close to someone that we fail
[43:18] to see it's Christ that we're following
[43:20] Amen due to distance ourselves from this
[43:24] world and to be drawn in the presence of
[43:26] God is what the world what the Word of
[43:29] God what what this gospel is all about
[43:31] so we don't have church because it gives
[43:34] us a social structure it does not we do
[43:38] not come to the house of God and put our
[43:41] time in reading our Bible and praying so
[43:43] that we can have a religious structure
[43:46] you see the pure Word of God is what
[43:49] attracts us amen and as we would look at
[43:53] our thought tonight the preparations of
[43:55] the inner man you see my brother and
[43:57] sister we can have all of the toilet
[43:59] paper we can have all of the water we
[44:01] can have all of the snack ramen all of
[44:03] the Campbell's soup we can have extra
[44:06] this and extra that but my brother and
[44:08] sister that's not what it's about on
[44:10] what we are here for is to come in the
[44:13] presence of the pure Word of God and to
[44:17] come into that and be fortified in the
[44:20] inner man because if we gain this whole
[44:22] world and lose our soul what have we
[44:25] gained nothing now my brother and sister
[44:29] I know sometimes when we talk this way
[44:30] that people got maybe get a little
[44:33] nervous but I want to just make this
[44:34] statement to you tonight you see there
[44:37] are voices in the land that are saying
[44:40] certain things and people are believing
[44:42] and going and thinking that way but I
[44:45] want to say this tonight that the quotes
[44:47] bring clarity to us and we need
[44:51] clarity but let's not mistake quotes
[44:55] which can be placed and ordered and
[44:58] structured in certain ways to say
[45:01] certain things let's not say that the
[45:04] quote by itself is the pure word the
[45:07] prophet of God or two hundred or so
[45:10] times tells us about going back to the
[45:13] word he speaks he sings in such a
[45:15] clarity and some today would say well
[45:18] you know focus on look to you know keep
[45:22] your eyes on on the message my brother
[45:24] and sister that's good
[45:25] but the message was pointing us to Jesus
[45:28] Christ and so let's just follow all that
[45:31] the prophet of God said and he said that
[45:33] this message was a representation of the
[45:37] Word of God for our hour and that this
[45:39] message my brother and sister the pure
[45:41] Word of God is God's message to this day
[45:45] now in the sermon the seal of the
[45:48] Antichrist brother Branham says here we
[45:51] need the old-fashioned gospel back in
[45:54] the church amen we don't need some new
[45:57] version we don't need a new modified
[45:59] version for Laodicea the end of the age
[46:02] kind of interpretation we just need the
[46:06] old fashioned gospel now the prophet of
[46:09] God tells us that the gospel is the life
[46:11] behind the word so we need to have some
[46:15] life back into the church he says now we
[46:18] need the old fashioned gospel back in
[46:20] the church Mac to the Word of God and a
[46:24] lot of this nonsense and foolishness cut
[46:26] off amen oh my around over the country
[46:29] the things that's done all my brother
[46:32] and sister I don't even want to get
[46:33] started on that things that's done here
[46:36] in our country something come in here
[46:38] not long ago and you can't even mention
[46:40] Pentecost around our country anymore on
[46:43] account of it you look at this and the
[46:45] prophet of God is talking about the
[46:48] nature or the behavior of the people
[46:51] that are claiming to be Christians now
[46:54] my brother and sister will touch on that
[46:55] in just a minute but you see we want to
[46:57] look at this that my focus are bringing
[47:00] this quote not to twist anything not to
[47:02] do it but the prophet of God saying we
[47:05] nina old fashioned gospel back in the
[47:07] church i say amen to that we need to go
[47:10] back to the word and a lot of nonsense
[47:13] and foolishness needs to be cut off amen
[47:16] this is how we prepare the inner man we
[47:18] cannot say hear and say well you know i
[47:20] just am a believer and so therefore I
[47:23] have no problems God will take care of
[47:26] everything my brother and sister
[47:27] remember for every action there is a
[47:30] reaction and so when the word of God is
[47:33] preached there must be a reaction
[47:35] amongst the people now the reaction may
[47:39] be that it will push some away but it
[47:42] will draw others closer I say Lord draw
[47:45] me close amen so as we look at this I
[47:48] want to just drop right down now into
[47:50] the message the seal of Christ you see
[47:54] that previous quote was out of the seal
[47:56] of the Antichrist so brother branham
[47:59] focusing back-to-back services he's
[48:01] focusing one on the seal of the
[48:04] Antichrist what was going to take place
[48:06] what the behavior the situation would be
[48:09] what it would produce but now the next
[48:12] evening he preaches on the seal of the
[48:17] Christ amen and so I say that's very
[48:20] relevant to you and I we're not going to
[48:22] be sealed we're not of the Antichrist we
[48:25] are of Christ amen I believe that every
[48:28] religion Amen or am i yet
[48:42] is there a little bit more of this
[48:43] brother I believe that ever religion
[48:50] every true religion is founded on this
[48:52] and if this if the religion doesn't
[48:55] speak of this then it's not right up
[48:58] here is God's only foundation the only
[49:00] truth that we can if anything is
[49:02] contrary to this word it's not the truth
[49:06] so you look at that and realize now when
[49:08] brother Branham was talking about
[49:10] contrary to the word it's not the truth
[49:12] he wasn't I can assure you holding one
[49:14] of his message books he was not speaking
[49:17] of himself he was speaking of this Bible
[49:20] my brother and sister and in this you
[49:22] look and realize if it's contrary to
[49:25] this word Amen it's not the truth you
[49:28] see so there is a preparation for the
[49:31] inner man that he will come to a time in
[49:34] a place that the pure Word of God now we
[49:36] we will take the pure Word of God as I
[49:39] said my brother and sister the quotes
[49:41] bring clarity that's what brother
[49:43] branham's ministry was for to bring a
[49:45] clarity of things that had been muddied
[49:47] and confused through the ages but he did
[49:49] not come to displace or replace the
[49:52] Bible he come to solidify the Bible as
[49:56] our anchor that we could come to that
[49:59] place that when we need help in the time
[50:03] of trouble and that we know exactly
[50:06] where to go you know questions do we go
[50:08] here under this ministry do we go here
[50:10] under this ministry we go back to the
[50:14] Word of God amen he said take everything
[50:16] back to the word now I know sometimes
[50:19] people think but brother Paul this is a
[50:21] redundant topic but my brother and
[50:23] sister when you look around and see how
[50:25] that people are leaning upon a certain
[50:28] ministry here they're leaning on a
[50:30] certain ministry here when the prophet
[50:32] of God showed us that these ministries
[50:34] true God called ministries will point to
[50:38] people back to Jesus Christ amen that is
[50:41] what it is amen now if a dreamer told
[50:44] the dream and it didn't flash on that
[50:45] Yoram Thummim it was wrong and now the
[50:48] devil taken a pattern of that and made
[50:51] one of those crystal balls but God still
[50:53] got his urine thumb
[50:55] and this is it I believe brother branham
[50:57] was holding up his Bible amen this is it
[51:00] that's right if any preacher preaches or
[51:02] any prophet prophecies or any dreamer
[51:05] dreams a dream that's contrary to this
[51:07] then it's wrong that's right it must
[51:10] come from the word I'm a great believer
[51:13] in the word can we say amen to that
[51:16] hallelujah that's what keeps us
[51:18] straightened out come back to the Word
[51:20] of God now you say brother Paul what's
[51:22] this why are you taking this my brother
[51:25] and sister but you must remember that as
[51:28] we are coming down to the end of time
[51:31] that Satan as we've read the scripture
[51:33] could come so close it would deceive the
[51:36] very elect then we realize that the only
[51:39] way that we will be able to discern or
[51:41] to separate that will take it back to a
[51:44] word by word position in this scripture
[51:48] and then when we compare that my brother
[51:50] and sister we're not talking about maybe
[51:52] the difference of a verbage you know
[51:54] somebody expressing it but to come down
[51:57] to the fundamentals must line up word by
[51:59] word and so what this is is not simply a
[52:02] church being prepper prepared to to look
[52:07] for the deceiver to look for the one who
[52:10] is bringing this in but there's actually
[52:12] a greater purpose we are not going to
[52:14] spend all of our time trying to figure
[52:17] out who's wrong but the Word of God is
[52:19] bringing us now brother Chris referenced
[52:22] here in one of his last services as he
[52:25] shared with us my brother and sister how
[52:28] that we're coming into a time we're
[52:30] coming into a place that the word is our
[52:33] absolute and I love that God's Word is
[52:37] our absolute amen so it comes back to
[52:41] the Word of God now we can pull pages
[52:43] back like this but there's only one who
[52:46] can open the book now you know you take
[52:48] that and many times you read that and
[52:50] and realize that when you see something
[52:53] in the Word of God when you see
[52:56] something in the Bible and in the
[52:58] message you must recognize that came
[53:01] from God that wasn't an intellectual
[53:04] understanding because if it's an
[53:06] intellectual understanding it will
[53:08] an intellectual result and her
[53:13] intellectual result will not get us in a
[53:15] rapture amen now we pull back the pages
[53:20] like this and there's only one who can
[53:21] open the book and that's he that come
[53:23] and took it out of the right hand of him
[53:25] that set upon the throne a lamb that had
[53:28] been slain from the foundation of the
[53:29] world
[53:30] none other but our Lord Jesus Christ the
[53:32] author of the word shall we bow our
[53:34] heads just a moment now to speak to him
[53:37] Amen that was in the seal of Christ now
[53:40] we understand very simple verbage here
[53:42] that the word is Christ and Christ is
[53:45] the word Amen John 1 settles this whole
[53:48] thing now my brother and sister you say
[53:50] brother Paul where is this preparation
[53:53] of the inner man coming my brother and
[53:55] sister it's by line upon line word upon
[53:57] word precept upon precept now the
[54:00] prophet of God says that we have either
[54:02] a practical out working where we allow
[54:05] that to to be built upon in our life or
[54:08] we are looking at that just as something
[54:11] to debate and analyze now my brother and
[54:13] sister if a man would tell you that this
[54:16] is not talking about God building up a
[54:18] spiritual house in you and I then that
[54:21] man views that simply as something to
[54:23] analyze and agree or disagree not
[54:26] looking for the actual change that the
[54:30] whirlings we're looking for the change
[54:33] not looking to debate it not looking to
[54:36] argue over these certain points but to
[54:39] realize that the practical these are
[54:41] brother branham's words the practical
[54:43] outworking of the word in our life my
[54:46] brother and sister is going to bring a
[54:47] change in our life you want to look that
[54:50] up you can Amen outworking amen
[54:53] so you look at that will see my brother
[54:56] and sister that this word what is doing
[54:58] is sealing us in or sealing us out that
[55:02] is what's happening in the day that
[55:03] we're living in and you know you have to
[55:06] look very closely and and I'm trying to
[55:08] keep from jumping ahead of myself
[55:09] because there are several thoughts that
[55:12] we have attached to this now it says my
[55:14] brother and sister in verse 24 for there
[55:17] shall arise false Christ's and false
[55:20] prophets
[55:21] and shall sew great signs and wonders in
[55:23] so much that if were possible they shall
[55:25] deceive the very elect you see we have a
[55:28] lot of people around the message right
[55:29] Satan wants to infect us with the virus
[55:33] of fear and when he can infect us with
[55:36] the virus of fear then we will become
[55:39] afraid of everything around us actually
[55:42] Satan even desires to impact us to the
[55:45] place that will actually be afraid to
[55:48] enter into the holiest of Holies afraid
[55:51] to step beyond the veil into the
[55:54] presence of God study that the prophet
[55:56] of God speaks on it my brother in spirit
[55:59] that is what fear will do it will
[56:01] paralyze us and under that paralyzing
[56:04] effect of the virus of fear we as sons
[56:07] and daughters of God will be afraid to
[56:09] trust God and take him at his word so
[56:13] it's not just about what will attack or
[56:16] affect the human body or the outward man
[56:18] but Satan's desiring to bring that same
[56:21] effect upon the soul now my brother and
[56:23] sisters so many are afraid that someone
[56:26] will come and somehow they will be
[56:29] victimized now certainly there is in the
[56:31] world of Christendom many people been
[56:33] victimized by many things but remember
[56:36] if we will take it back to the word and
[56:40] judge every ministry and every situation
[56:43] by the word then we don't have to worry
[56:46] about being led off into the jungles and
[56:48] poisoned hallelujah come on so you look
[56:53] at that don't be afraid that you're
[56:55] going to be victimized my brother and
[56:57] sister when someone comes and presents
[56:59] you something you take it back to the
[57:02] Word of God and when you take it back to
[57:04] the word it either passes the Urim
[57:07] Thummim or it doesn't and if it doesn't
[57:10] have courage to stand up and say this
[57:13] doesn't pass a word test don't be meek
[57:18] don't be a sheep in that sense and just
[57:21] sit there and say well maybe I don't get
[57:23] it it lines up with the word if it
[57:25] doesn't it's not right amen so we can
[57:30] spend a lot of time brother Chris kind
[57:32] of touched on this to a degree we can
[57:34] spend a lot of
[57:35] time nervously guarding ourselves we can
[57:38] be spending a lot of time looking around
[57:41] afraid of what might be said or what
[57:44] might be done and as we do that we can
[57:47] then spend a lot of time preaching about
[57:49] what's wrong here and what's wrong here
[57:51] but my brother and sister forget that
[57:53] nonsense let's dig into the Word of God
[57:56] spend our time in the word until it
[57:59] becomes our very life amen when it
[58:02] becomes our very breath when it becomes
[58:04] our very thoughts of the day when it
[58:06] becomes our actions amen
[58:10] when it becomes our reaction to our
[58:13] situation my brother and sister when we
[58:15] have become it it will have become us
[58:18] amen and so then we don't have to look
[58:21] out here and say what is this this is
[58:23] conspiracy to take over overthrow my
[58:27] brother and sister there's been a
[58:28] conspiracy since Satan was throat
[58:31] Lucifer was thrown out of heaven Amen
[58:33] there's been a conspiracy the whole time
[58:35] we're not worried about it my brother
[58:37] and sister God already said Satan you're
[58:40] defeated our job is to believe the word
[58:43] and stand on it and when we prepare
[58:46] ourselves to simply say there's no other
[58:49] option but standing on the Word of God
[58:52] then a lot of these things that we
[58:54] struggle with will just go right on bias
[58:56] people say well don't you notice that oh
[58:58] yes I noticed they're now trying to
[59:00] replace the dollar with something
[59:02] electronic I know that they've got this
[59:04] and I know that they've got that but
[59:06] what is that got to do with me hey man
[59:09] if I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and
[59:11] I'm ready to go in a rapture what has
[59:13] that got to do with me the prophet of
[59:16] God speaking in the church age book in
[59:17] the dark ages how that they come to that
[59:20] time in the place that the church
[59:22] thrived under persecution it was at that
[59:25] time that they relied and called upon
[59:28] God and sought his face and the church
[59:31] flourished even though the numbers
[59:33] brother Branham says the numbers of the
[59:35] martyrs was rising the numbers that gave
[59:37] their life for Christ was rising the
[59:40] church grew stronger because there was
[59:43] pressure upon him and if it takes
[59:45] pressure my brother and sister to get
[59:47] you and I ready for a rapture
[59:48] then let's stop and say Lord what will
[59:51] it take for me to have preparation for
[59:54] my inner man to be ready for that day
[59:56] for that time for my calling amen
[1:00:00] you see when it becomes our very action
[1:00:02] in reaction my brother and sister will
[1:00:05] no longer be us but it will be the mind
[1:00:06] of Christ in us that gives us direction
[1:00:10] and moves us forward hallelujah
[1:00:13] you know we speak of this of being you
[1:00:16] know deceived if it were possible my
[1:00:19] brother and sister making light or I'm
[1:00:21] not putting that down it is of a great
[1:00:23] concern because even in the realms of
[1:00:25] the message there are men who would say
[1:00:28] well the Prophet said this but it's not
[1:00:30] what the Prophet said there would be
[1:00:32] those that would try to take away what
[1:00:34] the Prophet said because it conflicts
[1:00:36] with their position my brother and
[1:00:38] sister the scripture says that if they
[1:00:40] add to or they take away my brother and
[1:00:42] sister that they would be taken from the
[1:00:46] book their name be taken from the book
[1:00:47] of life so we're not looking for men who
[1:00:50] by a clever craftiness have preached a
[1:00:54] message to try to draw people but my
[1:00:56] brother and sister let them and I say
[1:00:59] this to myself also let them prove it by
[1:01:03] the gospel let them prove it by the Word
[1:01:07] of God and if it's there we will stand
[1:01:10] upon it amen so you know what my brother
[1:01:13] and sister I believe there's another
[1:01:15] side to deception which this is my basis
[1:01:18] of my real fought tonight and James 1:17
[1:01:21] 2:27 and starting with verse 17 every
[1:01:25] good gift and every perfect gift is from
[1:01:27] above and we can say amen to that and
[1:01:30] cometh down from the Father of lights
[1:01:32] with whom is no variableness neither
[1:01:35] shadow neither shadow of turning
[1:01:37] of his own will begat he asked with the
[1:01:40] word of truth imagined begat this to be
[1:01:45] fathered he fathered us before the
[1:01:47] foundation of the world with the word of
[1:01:51] truth now just as sure is in this modern
[1:01:53] day make him take a DNA sample and they
[1:01:57] can identify people who you are related
[1:02:00] to I know of a brother
[1:02:02] that was given up for adoption when he
[1:02:04] was quite and through all the years and
[1:02:07] and another brother in the church and
[1:02:09] encouraged him and the two of them went
[1:02:11] together and did one of those DNA things
[1:02:13] and both of them had have been adopted
[1:02:15] and the brother was shocked to find that
[1:02:19] he had a lot of relatives in a city not
[1:02:22] far from them and so it was there that
[1:02:25] he he realized now how it all tied
[1:02:30] together parts of the pieces of the
[1:02:32] puzzle that he never dreamed he has a
[1:02:35] grandmother still living he has aunts
[1:02:38] and uncles he has all kinds of relatives
[1:02:40] still living and by God's grace they
[1:02:43] have been very open and receptive you
[1:02:46] know and when his grandmother met him
[1:02:48] for the first time she said a statement
[1:02:51] on the order of something about this
[1:02:54] party is for my grandson I never knew I
[1:02:56] had
[1:02:56] and so you recognized that my brother's
[1:02:59] sister so if God begat us with a word of
[1:03:03] truth then what is our DNA truth our DNA
[1:03:10] cannot be false it cannot be a deception
[1:03:13] it can't be a lie if we were begat with
[1:03:17] truth hallelujah thank you Lord I love
[1:03:21] that because what we are my brother and
[1:03:23] sister is then the very truth which is
[1:03:26] God passed down in the DNA or bloodline
[1:03:29] and therefore every seed must bring
[1:03:32] forth of its own kind and if the seed
[1:03:34] that begat you and I was truth and that
[1:03:36] means we will bring forth truth Oh
[1:03:38] hallelujah I love that it's a lovely
[1:03:41] thing you realize that it's not here
[1:03:44] whether we're worried about Satan going
[1:03:46] to deceive us or some man come into our
[1:03:49] midst into the church that would come
[1:03:51] and deceive us my brother and sister the
[1:03:54] very DNA that is in us is the DNA of
[1:03:59] truth so what will come forth of us now
[1:04:03] we'll touch on this in just a minute but
[1:04:06] it was well look I'll get ahead of
[1:04:07] myself I can't help it here
[1:04:08] remember what brother Branham talked
[1:04:10] about that citrus and neighbors there
[1:04:12] with that brother and he grafted in all
[1:04:14] these different kinds of
[1:04:15] citrus and brother branham ask you he
[1:04:17] says now when that comes forth it will
[1:04:19] bring forth but I believe it was a lemon
[1:04:24] tree all this and brother Brown says now
[1:04:27] okay when when this comes and brings a
[1:04:30] new crop it'll be what that was he said
[1:04:31] no everything that was in grafted in oh
[1:04:34] I hope you get this everything that was
[1:04:37] in grafted in will bring forth of the
[1:04:40] fruit of what it was now when you look
[1:04:43] at that you realize that you have a
[1:04:45] lemon tree and you graft a grapefruit
[1:04:48] into it some kind of citrus into it and
[1:04:51] it's going to bring forth of its kind my
[1:04:55] brother and sister that part that was
[1:04:57] grafted in cannot bring forth anything
[1:05:00] else but what its DNA is are you with me
[1:05:04] amen so look at this of his own will
[1:05:09] begat he with us word of truth that we
[1:05:12] should be a kind of firstfruits of his
[1:05:15] creatures Oh to be a first fruit you've
[1:05:19] got to be of the original amen so it's
[1:05:22] there he says wherefore my beloved
[1:05:24] brethren let every man be swift to hear
[1:05:26] slow to speak slow to wrath for the
[1:05:28] wrath of man worketh not the
[1:05:30] righteousness of God wherefore lay apart
[1:05:33] all filthiness and superfluity of
[1:05:36] naughtiness and receive with meekness in
[1:05:39] other words don't be haughty about what
[1:05:42] God has done for you receive with
[1:05:44] meekness the engrafted word which is
[1:05:49] able to save your souls so what was in
[1:05:51] grafted into you and I my brother and
[1:05:54] sister what was placed I mean into you
[1:05:56] begat into you and I let me get my
[1:05:58] thoughts straight as we are grafted in
[1:06:01] if Christ is truth and were grafted into
[1:06:06] him what will we bring forth truth we
[1:06:12] cannot bring forth the Carnales of
[1:06:14] Laodicea we can't bring any
[1:06:17] deceivableness or superfluity my
[1:06:20] brother's sister we have to bring forth
[1:06:22] truth this is what sets the difference
[1:06:24] of the bride from being a Christian in
[1:06:28] name only as it
[1:06:30] to being the real Christian is because
[1:06:32] she was begat in truth and she's grafted
[1:06:36] into truth and the only thing she can
[1:06:38] bring forth then will be truth amen
[1:06:42] that's why she will not put up with a
[1:06:44] hybrid religion she will not be put up
[1:06:47] with the Word of God being twisted and
[1:06:50] turned because she knows the very very
[1:06:53] very SAP as it were typing it back to
[1:06:56] the tree that flows through the original
[1:06:59] is now flowing through them because the
[1:07:02] DNA of truth is in the original and the
[1:07:05] DNA of truth is in them that they will
[1:07:08] bring forth as it says here in the
[1:07:10] scripture the firstfruits in other words
[1:07:13] it won't be my brother and sister some
[1:07:15] haughty high-minded I'll just bite those
[1:07:22] words off amen you see I want to focus
[1:07:28] for a second right in the last portion
[1:07:30] of that it says will receive that means
[1:07:34] something's coming to us with meekness
[1:07:38] the engrafted word oh my brother and
[1:07:43] sister you look at that it's just so
[1:07:45] beautiful he says here in verse 22 but
[1:07:48] be doers of the word not hearers only I
[1:07:51] believe right here in this scripture
[1:07:54] verse 22 is the greatest deception my
[1:07:57] brother and sister that is facing many
[1:07:59] people will look out here and you know
[1:08:01] what I have justify my studies and and
[1:08:04] looking my brother and sister the people
[1:08:07] that want to buy these these guys jet
[1:08:10] airplanes so they can fly around on a 40
[1:08:12] million dollar plane these people that
[1:08:14] want to build the Taj Mahal of a church
[1:08:16] and they give all their money to do that
[1:08:18] they're really not looking for the
[1:08:21] engrafted word they're looking for
[1:08:24] someone they can identify with and so it
[1:08:27] is back to the carnal side looking to
[1:08:29] man living under that you know to have
[1:08:32] the sticker on your car
[1:08:34] I support such and such ministries or I
[1:08:37] associate they're telling the world this
[1:08:40] is my identity
[1:08:41] that's why mother's sister
[1:08:43] put this out his opinion if you don't
[1:08:45] agree with me please listen off fuss
[1:08:47] about it but that's why I'm not real big
[1:08:49] my brother and sister I don't need to
[1:08:52] have a tie tack or collar tack I don't
[1:08:54] need a bumper sticker what I need is an
[1:08:56] identity in Jesus Christ and my life is
[1:09:00] the evidence of my identity it's not
[1:09:04] what's stuck on my car or on the front
[1:09:06] window of my house or or whatever else
[1:09:08] it is the identity of the life amen so
[1:09:13] now you look at this my brother and
[1:09:15] sister it says right here Oh hallelujah
[1:09:18] but be doers of the word so it's giving
[1:09:23] us a commandment that there's an action
[1:09:26] that we must take and if we are a doer
[1:09:30] of the word amen well hallelujah
[1:09:35] not just to here gonna be a lot of
[1:09:38] here's my brother and sister there are a
[1:09:40] lot of years there's a lot of people who
[1:09:42] will tell you I've listened to every
[1:09:44] sermon brother Branham preached X amount
[1:09:46] of times that's good but what my
[1:09:49] question for you will be what are you
[1:09:52] doing with it
[1:09:53] amen we can hear it and hear it and hear
[1:09:56] it you know I always thought this was
[1:09:58] funny you go to a doctor and he tells
[1:10:00] you you know what your cholesterol is
[1:10:02] too high you're a little bit overweight
[1:10:03] what you need to do is go on a diet and
[1:10:07] change this and change that and for your
[1:10:10] health and then the doctor grunts and
[1:10:12] groans as he heaves his overweight body
[1:10:14] out of the chair that he was sitting in
[1:10:16] while he talks to you my brother and
[1:10:19] sister let's not just be hearers of the
[1:10:22] word but let us be doers hallelujah I
[1:10:28] always found it humorous in many years
[1:10:30] ago I visited a doctor and he walked
[1:10:33] into the room and started his little you
[1:10:37] know interview of me about my health
[1:10:40] issue and he smelled like cigarettes and
[1:10:43] finally he gets to this spot and he says
[1:10:45] do you smoke and I said no sir never
[1:10:48] have never will and he says well he said
[1:10:51] let me tell you and he lowered his voice
[1:10:53] as though there was somebody listening
[1:10:54] it's a filthy habit
[1:10:57] and I thought wow here you are telling
[1:11:00] me that this is a filthy habit but it's
[1:11:03] obviously a habit you have listen to
[1:11:05] yourself Oh Lord
[1:11:08] you know sometimes Saints we actually
[1:11:09] preach the best sermons we'll ever hear
[1:11:11] we preach to ourselves amen
[1:11:14] sometimes when we say you know I
[1:11:16] shouldn't be doing this we ought to stop
[1:11:18] and say Amen yeah God will deal with us
[1:11:22] so we're not going to just be hearers
[1:11:27] we're going to be doers
[1:11:28] because you see verse 22 says that when
[1:11:32] we are be doers of the word and not
[1:11:35] hearers only deceiving your own selves
[1:11:37] to only hear the word my brother and
[1:11:40] sister we can be so concerned about
[1:11:42] who's going to come in and preach a
[1:11:45] version of the message to us that we're
[1:11:49] is we're just guns I to hear it but yet
[1:11:52] my brother's sister the word clearly
[1:11:54] shows us that if we hear the word and we
[1:11:56] don't do it we are not getting deceived
[1:11:59] by this man or this man we are deceiving
[1:12:03] ourselves now as a believer my brother
[1:12:06] and sister the prophet of God taught us
[1:12:08] that we should take everything back to
[1:12:11] the Word of God to check it against the
[1:12:14] word so someone come and preaches
[1:12:16] something maybe you haven't heard it
[1:12:18] that way or they have a claim of a great
[1:12:20] revelation and the Prophet showed us you
[1:12:23] take it back to the word you check it
[1:12:25] against the word and if it doesn't pass
[1:12:27] a word test and then you don't receive
[1:12:30] it you don't act upon that my brother
[1:12:32] and sister but what I would propose to
[1:12:34] each and every one of you it is not just
[1:12:36] us taking what someone else says or does
[1:12:39] back to the word to be able to judge
[1:12:41] them but are we willing tonight to take
[1:12:44] ourself back to the word and judge our
[1:12:48] life because if we are willing to change
[1:12:50] ourself back to the word and say Lord
[1:12:53] how does my life stand up against the
[1:12:56] Word of God and if we are here and a
[1:12:59] doer we will see in the word where we
[1:13:02] stand and then that will bring us as the
[1:13:04] prophet of God said we're backslide many
[1:13:06] times a day that's good but are we
[1:13:08] repenting many times a day
[1:13:10] there's the key we need to repent many
[1:13:14] times a day not just acknowledge what I
[1:13:16] did wasn't right
[1:13:17] anyone can say yep I shouldn't have
[1:13:20] yelled I shouldn't have caused confusion
[1:13:22] in the church
[1:13:23] I shouldn't have troubled the waters I
[1:13:25] shouldn't have done all this stuff but
[1:13:27] are they willing to repent from that
[1:13:29] there is the action to hearing amen but
[1:13:34] you see if we're not willing to take
[1:13:35] ourself back to the word to judge
[1:13:37] ourselves then we don't have to worry
[1:13:39] about brother so-and-so from India we
[1:13:41] don't have to worry about this person
[1:13:43] over here we don't have to worry about
[1:13:44] this person across the country there
[1:13:46] because we're deceiving ourself whoa
[1:13:50] talk about something that would be
[1:13:52] troubling imagine you get there on that
[1:13:54] day and it looks kind of troubling for
[1:13:57] you and you're thinking well it was this
[1:13:59] preacher it was that preacher it was my
[1:14:00] pastor
[1:14:01] wouldn't it be shocking to find out that
[1:14:03] the very deception that would keep you
[1:14:05] out of the rapture would have been
[1:14:07] yourself oh my my oh my for if any be a
[1:14:14] hearer of the word and not a doer he is
[1:14:16] like unto a man beholding his natural
[1:14:17] face in a glass for he beholdeth himself
[1:14:21] in other words he has an image to uphold
[1:14:23] - or look - and goeth his way and
[1:14:25] straightway forgetteth what manner of
[1:14:28] man he was
[1:14:29] you know you can type verse 24 or at
[1:14:32] least this is a way I understand it
[1:14:34] Lord correct me if I'm wrong but my
[1:14:36] brother and sister we can sit right here
[1:14:38] in church and we can say this is who I
[1:14:41] am this is an identity that I recognize
[1:14:44] or hold to but if we go out and we are
[1:14:48] out here in the world and we can't
[1:14:52] remember who we were in the mirror of
[1:14:54] God's Word we're deceiving ourselves
[1:14:57] we're in trouble
[1:14:59] hallelujah amen so but whoso looketh see
[1:15:05] this is something I just love here whoso
[1:15:08] looketh into the perfect law of Liberty
[1:15:10] and continueth therein oh my just
[1:15:13] staying under that perfect law of
[1:15:15] Liberty he bring he being not a
[1:15:18] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[1:15:20] this man shall be blessed in his deed oh
[1:15:23] thing
[1:15:24] about what God's doing how we see that
[1:15:27] there are families there are men women
[1:15:29] brothers sisters we see them being
[1:15:31] blessed in their work and what they're
[1:15:33] doing in their life and people say well
[1:15:35] they're really forcing us but you look
[1:15:37] my brother and sister and they are not
[1:15:39] just hearing but they are doing the Word
[1:15:41] of God and God says right here in verse
[1:15:43] 25 he'll bless them oh my I want to be
[1:15:46] that man amen now this verse 26 I find
[1:15:49] it interesting when you have people that
[1:15:51] are argumented and you have people that
[1:15:53] want to fight with you over what the
[1:15:55] message would mean it says right here if
[1:15:57] any man among you seemed to be religious
[1:15:59] and Bridal if not his tongue but
[1:16:02] deceiveth his own heart this man's
[1:16:04] religion is vain pure religion and
[1:16:07] undefiled before God and the father is
[1:16:09] this to visit the fatherless and widows
[1:16:10] in their affliction and to keep himself
[1:16:12] unspotted from the world
[1:16:14] oh my brother and sister we can stand on
[1:16:16] the corners that was the that was the
[1:16:18] realm that was the Avenue that was the
[1:16:20] the anointing that the Sadducees and
[1:16:22] Pharisees and the Herodians and all of
[1:16:24] them had was to sit around and argue
[1:16:26] what what the what the scriptures of
[1:16:29] their day you know as they was looking
[1:16:30] to argue what it meant and the
[1:16:32] importance of it but we're not to do
[1:16:34] that were to let the life of Christ be
[1:16:36] manifested out of our own life amen now
[1:16:40] I'd like to go into the message the
[1:16:43] thirst some of these quotes are tad bit
[1:16:45] longer so bear with me he says now you
[1:16:48] cannot pull sin through the pages of
[1:16:51] this Bible Wow so you know if we
[1:16:57] actually put this first reminds me years
[1:17:01] ago I was sharing some things with a
[1:17:04] brother and I'd said brother you know it
[1:17:07] was really sad I was here at this home
[1:17:09] and and this is this and this and this
[1:17:11] is what I saw and he said oh brother
[1:17:14] Paul I'm not trying to one-up you but he
[1:17:16] said let me share something I
[1:17:18] encountered something I experienced and
[1:17:21] and this brothers quite well known
[1:17:24] around the message he said I I was there
[1:17:27] and this this man and this brother
[1:17:29] invited him to his house and and he went
[1:17:32] and when he walked in the house he was
[1:17:35] kind of amazed here was like the biggest
[1:17:37] flat-screen or whatever
[1:17:38] TV that you could get at the time and he
[1:17:41] said what would you think would be right
[1:17:42] on top of that television I was like
[1:17:47] well I don't know he said there was the
[1:17:51] biggest picture of brother Branham
[1:17:53] sitting on top of that television and he
[1:17:56] said it really bothered me he says
[1:17:58] because here the prophet of God blasted
[1:18:00] the television and the man has brother
[1:18:03] roms pitcher on top of the television
[1:18:06] now he said that wasn't the whole thing
[1:18:09] the man wanted to talk a little business
[1:18:11] with him and he says brother he said
[1:18:14] when brother Branham comes back he said
[1:18:17] I have a bank account of money that I
[1:18:22] want to give to the Prophet to help him
[1:18:25] with his ministry when he comes back and
[1:18:27] the man shared what the total was and
[1:18:29] the total was very outstanding it was
[1:18:31] quite an astounding amount of money that
[1:18:34] the man had been saving the man had had
[1:18:36] a good business and made a good living
[1:18:38] through the years and he'd put all of
[1:18:40] this into this investment account and it
[1:18:43] was a staggering sum of money and the
[1:18:46] man wanted this brother to help him
[1:18:47] coordinate funneling this money to
[1:18:51] brother Branham when he came back and
[1:18:53] this brothers quite outspoken and he
[1:18:55] told him he said I can't help you and he
[1:18:57] said well you don't believe you could
[1:18:58] make the connections the brother looked
[1:19:00] at him said I don't plan on being here
[1:19:02] now my brother and sister you say well
[1:19:04] that's kind of rude that's kind of rough
[1:19:06] but you see it's what preparation is
[1:19:08] being made some are being prepared to
[1:19:11] come to a time to do certain things but
[1:19:15] the message of the hour I believe it
[1:19:18] undiluted
[1:19:20] undefiled unleavened is producing a
[1:19:25] people that are not looking for
[1:19:27] something as it were to come back but
[1:19:30] they're looking for a calling away
[1:19:31] they're looking to to leave this earth
[1:19:34] not deal with the circumstances of the
[1:19:37] future in other words we don't need to
[1:19:39] build a bomb shelter my brother and
[1:19:41] sister because the prophet of God said
[1:19:43] he saw America a great smoldering ruins
[1:19:46] and you know we're not looking to build
[1:19:48] a bomb shelter we're looking to be out
[1:19:51] of here
[1:19:52] when judgment strikes this earth hey men
[1:19:54] so you cannot pull sin through the pages
[1:19:57] of the Bible so in other words my
[1:20:00] brother and sister I'm just going to
[1:20:01] speak real direct to us tonight in other
[1:20:04] words when we see sin in the church
[1:20:08] unhindered somebody is not filtering
[1:20:16] amen
[1:20:17] they're not filtering because you see
[1:20:20] you can't pull sin through the pages of
[1:20:23] this Bible no it stops it it filters it
[1:20:25] out now you can go to church and just
[1:20:28] take anything but you can't come through
[1:20:31] this Bible and have sin I think that's
[1:20:35] pretty straight is it not amen it will
[1:20:38] not do it it filters out all sin it
[1:20:41] gives a holy man's taste because if the
[1:20:45] man is thinking that he wants to be holy
[1:20:48] hmm look at the position here because if
[1:20:52] the man is thinking that he wants to be
[1:20:54] holy and be like God and be a son or a
[1:20:57] daughter of God then he wants the right
[1:21:01] kind of filter he stops all sin on this
[1:21:06] side of the Bible and he can only bring
[1:21:09] the Holy Spirit through the Bible that
[1:21:11] wrote in the Bible it's a holy man's
[1:21:14] taste to have this thinking man's filter
[1:21:17] now we find how deceiving it is today
[1:21:22] Matthew 24:24 Jesus said in the last
[1:21:24] days that the two spirits would be so
[1:21:26] close alike that until it would deceive
[1:21:29] the very elect
[1:21:30] if it was possible how close how what a
[1:21:34] deception of right and wrong we have
[1:21:36] today even in in our government our
[1:21:40] politics we haven't even got a man that
[1:21:44] could put up as a politician that will
[1:21:46] absolutely stand up for what he thinks
[1:21:48] is right
[1:21:48] now look at what we got for politicians
[1:21:50] here my goodness brother and sister we
[1:21:53] have seen the greatest debacle in the
[1:21:56] last decade of politicians in our nation
[1:21:59] they can't even stand up for anything
[1:22:02] that's right they are worried about
[1:22:04] being read
[1:22:06] elected they're worried about their
[1:22:07] retirement they're worried about
[1:22:08] everything but this nation now when you
[1:22:12] look at that as a prophet of God is
[1:22:14] speaking this my brother and sister when
[1:22:16] you think about the fact he's speaking
[1:22:18] this in 1965 he is describing perfectly
[1:22:22] the politician of our day amen
[1:22:26] say one thing do what's convenient amen
[1:22:29] where is our Patrick Henry's and George
[1:22:32] Washington's and Abraham Lincoln's of
[1:22:34] today just as our president said they're
[1:22:37] the way if they want communism they can
[1:22:39] have it whatever the people wants if
[1:22:42] that ain't a man that won't speak his
[1:22:44] conviction I believe it was Lyndon
[1:22:47] Johnson that was a president at this
[1:22:48] time if Eddie just a man that won't
[1:22:51] speak his conviction a man will stand on
[1:22:54] principle that will stand on what's
[1:22:57] what's what a principle just want to go
[1:23:00] the way of least resistance and that's
[1:23:03] the way what the people's has got in the
[1:23:05] church mine is Grace a church of least
[1:23:09] resistance Saints where we rally
[1:23:13] together and push for what is right or
[1:23:16] what is the least resistant I say God
[1:23:21] give us courage for what is right amen
[1:23:24] and that's the way that the people has
[1:23:28] got in the church they want to come join
[1:23:30] church and say oh well that that's it
[1:23:32] I've joined Church now you're trying to
[1:23:35] satisfy that great holy thirst that God
[1:23:38] put in you that control tower trying to
[1:23:42] turn you to the right thing and you're
[1:23:44] trying to satisfy with joining a church
[1:23:47] quoting a Creed or something like that
[1:23:49] now look as we was talking earlier my
[1:23:52] brother and sister about the carcass you
[1:23:54] see this word this carcass is so
[1:23:57] beautiful so delicious as you would say
[1:24:00] that to the bride of Jesus Christ to the
[1:24:03] eagle that she is so attracted to this
[1:24:07] carcass that met nothing's going to stop
[1:24:10] her and it's not about the church it's
[1:24:13] not about the group it's not about the
[1:24:15] religious or social structure it's about
[1:24:18] the war
[1:24:19] it's about that carcass is what is
[1:24:21] attracting her am i happy to go to
[1:24:23] church with you yes I'm happy to go to
[1:24:25] church with the saints of grace but my
[1:24:27] brother and sister it's the word that
[1:24:29] brings us together not personalities not
[1:24:32] convenience but the word amen you try to
[1:24:36] satisfy that great holy thirst that God
[1:24:39] put in you that control tower trying to
[1:24:42] turn you to the right thing oh my and
[1:24:45] you try to satisfy it with joining a
[1:24:47] church quoting a Creed or something like
[1:24:50] that why it's nothing but the very
[1:24:53] presence and the filling of God Himself
[1:24:55] in your life that will satisfy it
[1:24:56] there's the beauty of this carcass is
[1:24:59] God's laid it in front of us and here it
[1:25:01] is we have access to it but it isn't
[1:25:04] even us because it's him drawing us it's
[1:25:08] the carcass drawing you and I because
[1:25:11] the carcass and the carcass alone will
[1:25:13] satisfy no amount we have a wonderful
[1:25:16] musicians we have a wonderful song
[1:25:18] leader we have these things but we can't
[1:25:20] come here and just sing song after song
[1:25:22] after song and go home and say we're
[1:25:24] satisfied we've got to have some word to
[1:25:27] feed on we've got to have something that
[1:25:29] will come and satisfy that holy thirst
[1:25:32] that is in us amen and this is what
[1:25:34] God's doing because in the preparation
[1:25:37] of you and I the preparation of this
[1:25:39] inner man were coming to the place where
[1:25:41] once discharged as a function as an
[1:25:43] activity as a group was enough but now
[1:25:46] we've been drawn into a deeper
[1:25:48] relationship that we must have something
[1:25:51] solid to feed upon and I say thank you
[1:25:54] for that Lord hallelujah now it's
[1:25:57] nothing but the very presence and
[1:25:59] filling of God himself in your life that
[1:26:01] will satisfy that he won't be satisfied
[1:26:03] with a Creed my eye sometimes you know
[1:26:07] they talk about social experiments my
[1:26:10] brothers sisters sometimes I thought
[1:26:12] before I'd list like - I just like to do
[1:26:15] a social experiment in church and and
[1:26:17] just you know take the preaching for
[1:26:19] maybe a month or something and preach
[1:26:21] fundamentally truth but just kind of
[1:26:23] water it down hey we're all going to
[1:26:25] heaven we're all gonna do it God loves
[1:26:28] us and just see what the church what
[1:26:30] would the church's reaction would
[1:26:31] somebody be saying what's going on
[1:26:32] brother
[1:26:33] Paul you've kind of watered this message
[1:26:35] down made it like everybody's going to
[1:26:36] make a rapture what's going on people
[1:26:38] just sit back and say yep yep yep yep
[1:26:40] yep well I'm not brave enough to take a
[1:26:43] social experiment like that
[1:26:45] I took one a few years ago when I
[1:26:47] preached about how I was quitting the
[1:26:49] message and you know and a few started
[1:26:51] looks in the church and then I just
[1:26:53] remember brother Bob he looked up from
[1:26:55] about the third or fourth row in the old
[1:26:57] church he looked up at me nodded his
[1:26:59] head and just grinned III didn't fool
[1:27:02] him for a moment but my point was when I
[1:27:05] preached that sermon about while I left
[1:27:07] the message my brother and sister I was
[1:27:09] driving home the point of what we
[1:27:11] believe is this Bible we don't have to
[1:27:13] identify it I believe a message I
[1:27:15] believe a message this is what we
[1:27:17] believe this is our foundation this is
[1:27:19] our fundamental and this is adequate to
[1:27:22] prepare the inner man for a rapture you
[1:27:25] know prepare the inner man to live in
[1:27:28] the presence of Almighty God for
[1:27:30] eternity it is sufficient hallelujah God
[1:27:34] sent a prophet he come and he brought
[1:27:36] clarity to the Word of God and it's
[1:27:39] there that we find the life without the
[1:27:41] confusion without all the
[1:27:42] misunderstandings and it's there and
[1:27:44] everything we need has been given to us
[1:27:47] hallelujah hallelujah he says you know
[1:27:51] you'll never pull a Creed through
[1:27:55] through that Bible no there's not even
[1:27:57] the Apostles Creed so-called will never
[1:27:59] come through there show me in the Bible
[1:28:01] where the pro so Creed says I believe in
[1:28:03] the Holy Roman Catholic Church I believe
[1:28:06] in the communion of saints when the
[1:28:07] Bible said there's only one mediator
[1:28:09] between God and man and that's the man
[1:28:11] Christ Jesus you'll never pull that
[1:28:13] through the Bible speaking of the
[1:28:15] Apostles Creed and stuff you'll never
[1:28:17] pull all these dances and shorts and
[1:28:19] things people are doing today
[1:28:21] twists and wah to cease and all these
[1:28:23] things through God's Word you'll never
[1:28:25] pull this modern trend of civilization
[1:28:28] through that Bible it's against it see
[1:28:31] and you try to satisfy that thirst but
[1:28:33] you see you know the Bible will only
[1:28:35] satisfy a righteous man or woman's taste
[1:28:41] so while the Bible is the largest
[1:28:44] greatest read book on
[1:28:46] it will only satisfy a righteous man or
[1:28:51] woman's taste this holy spirit that they
[1:28:54] would laugh at and said you've gone out
[1:28:55] of your mind
[1:28:56] but that satisfies that longing that's
[1:28:58] something that the world knows nothing
[1:29:00] about and I can say amen to that I've
[1:29:02] been down that road I've been in that
[1:29:04] position where you look and you look and
[1:29:06] you look for something to satisfy I
[1:29:08] thought as a young man that by doing
[1:29:10] risky things you know and and just
[1:29:13] living as a adrenaline junkie that that
[1:29:16] somehow would satisfy but it didn't
[1:29:18] because the very next time you had to go
[1:29:20] out and try to find something that
[1:29:22] exceeded the last experience but when we
[1:29:25] have a true experience in Jesus Christ
[1:29:27] the inner man becoming satisfied not not
[1:29:30] to become lackadaisical or lazy but just
[1:29:33] satisfy brings a peace and it brings a
[1:29:35] in our life where we can sit down and
[1:29:38] say though all hail assail me I shall
[1:29:40] not be moved
[1:29:41] hallelujah thank you lord amen
[1:29:45] but that satisfies that longing that's
[1:29:48] something that the world knows nothing
[1:29:49] about they have perverted themselves
[1:29:51] from to baptism of the Holy Spirit in
[1:29:54] the word of God unto what unto the
[1:29:56] cesspool success pools of the Church of
[1:29:58] dogma Creed denominational differences
[1:30:00] and so forth
[1:30:01] oh my prophet doesn't mince any words
[1:30:04] does he boy I tell you what now I want
[1:30:07] to just close this out here tonight as I
[1:30:10] said earlier many people would use the
[1:30:14] term I grew up with LDS or Mormon
[1:30:18] influence in our families some Catholic
[1:30:21] influence in our families and you know
[1:30:24] I've been around a lot of different
[1:30:25] religions but those two both I just
[1:30:28] would bring a clarity both of those
[1:30:31] religions you will hear people say well
[1:30:34] I'm a Catholic
[1:30:35] I'm just not practicing now when you
[1:30:39] think about that my brother and sister
[1:30:41] they're giving our identity to something
[1:30:43] but they're saying I don't believe it
[1:30:45] enough to do it not practicing in the
[1:30:52] Mormon background very much the same I
[1:30:55] remember growing up families kids I went
[1:30:58] to school with with friends
[1:31:00] with families that I know and they would
[1:31:03] tell you
[1:31:03] we're Mormon but but we're not
[1:31:08] practicing we're Jack Mormons well you
[1:31:11] know what brother and sister you are
[1:31:13] what you identify with and you know I'm
[1:31:17] this is gonna be a little harsh and
[1:31:18] probably I shouldn't say it but I feel -
[1:31:21] I'm rather and sister around the message
[1:31:23] you don't see people saying you know I'm
[1:31:26] I believe the message but I'm not
[1:31:30] practicing it what you see is people
[1:31:35] that say I believe the message and they
[1:31:37] live any way they please
[1:31:40] see there's not even an identity that I
[1:31:43] know this is truth so you see when the
[1:31:44] Catholic says I'm a Catholic but I'm not
[1:31:46] practicing it they're acknowledging they
[1:31:48] believe the Catholic Church correct when
[1:31:51] you have a Mormon who says I'm Mormon
[1:31:53] but I'm a Jack Mormon I'm just not doing
[1:31:55] it but they're acknowledging there's a
[1:31:57] connection but I find this common trend
[1:32:00] you don't find people in the message
[1:32:02] saying I'm a jack message or I'm a
[1:32:04] non-practicing message believer my
[1:32:07] brother and sister what we have is one
[1:32:09] of the greatest fundamental deficiencies
[1:32:12] that is coming upon the earth today in
[1:32:15] the realm of the message and people say
[1:32:17] I believe the message and they live any
[1:32:19] way they please but yet they will
[1:32:22] project that they are a believer because
[1:32:25] they are hearing the word or have heard
[1:32:27] the word but they are not acting on it
[1:32:31] this scripture clearly says they're
[1:32:33] deceiving themselves
[1:32:35] this sounds judgmental but my brother's
[1:32:37] sister I'm not judging them I'm just
[1:32:39] bringing you the word that unction
[1:32:41] should come upon us that when we hear
[1:32:43] the word hey look I give you this route
[1:32:46] you hear the word don't take my word for
[1:32:48] it
[1:32:49] take it back to your Bible take it back
[1:32:52] as a cross-section of reference in the
[1:32:54] message because the prophet of God
[1:32:55] talked about the sights on the gun
[1:32:57] barrel take it back line it all up and
[1:32:59] if it is the truth well if it's not the
[1:33:03] truth you need to get rid of me but if
[1:33:06] it's the truth don't just hear it act on
[1:33:09] it do something with it
[1:33:13] it change your life even if it is just
[1:33:16] one little thing that it changes let it
[1:33:20] change it all my practicing the
[1:33:26] definition in short the abbreviated is
[1:33:28] an actual application as opposed to
[1:33:32] theory let's not let the message be
[1:33:36] theory to us let's be practicing
[1:33:39] believers amen
[1:33:42] Oh hallelujah we're either a Christian
[1:33:46] or were not amen we're either a believer
[1:33:49] or we're not oh my I got it one another
[1:33:54] just slightly longer quote here but
[1:33:56] we'll we'll go ahead and go into it real
[1:33:58] quick in faith in action what good does
[1:34:03] it do to paint fire to a freezing man
[1:34:06] show him a picture of a nice big warm
[1:34:09] fire and man's are freezing that's
[1:34:12] something that was that's what people
[1:34:14] are trying to keep you alive by today no
[1:34:18] wonder we got failure in America of
[1:34:20] religion no wonder the magazine says the
[1:34:23] spiritual Longo is a burst is because
[1:34:25] they failed to represent the right thing
[1:34:27] to them they're trying to teach them of
[1:34:30] a historical God now my brother and
[1:34:34] sister if we're not careful will preach
[1:34:36] or teach to our church a historical
[1:34:39] message we got a message that's living
[1:34:43] today Jesus Christ alive today there is
[1:34:46] people who can receive and will receive
[1:34:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:34:50] today there's people that will be healed
[1:34:52] today there will be people that will be
[1:34:54] delivered today we don't have to look in
[1:34:56] the past we don't have to go back and
[1:34:58] find a reference point in years or
[1:35:00] whatever gone by but we can find that
[1:35:02] right today what we need today is a God
[1:35:05] resurrected from the dead and on right
[1:35:07] hand now to do whatever he promised he
[1:35:10] would do to confirm his word and we need
[1:35:13] this I love this portion right here and
[1:35:15] we need delegates out there in the
[1:35:18] audience who's willing to rest their
[1:35:20] soul on any word that God said and put
[1:35:24] it to action amen
[1:35:26] oh can we say amen to that tonight we
[1:35:29] need delegates who would be a delegate
[1:35:31] tonight maybe you could lift your hand
[1:35:32] let the Lord know Lord I'd be a delegate
[1:35:35] Amen that would be willing to rest my
[1:35:37] soul on any word Lord that you said and
[1:35:41] to put it to action amen
[1:35:44] going back a little reference to what we
[1:35:46] preached in Phoenix my brother and
[1:35:47] sister if there is an action there has
[1:35:50] to be a reaction and the prophet of God
[1:35:53] talking there as they held a prayer line
[1:35:55] early on and people stepped out to
[1:35:58] receive their healing the prophet of God
[1:36:00] says because you took that action there
[1:36:02] will be a reaction to your action oh my
[1:36:06] brother and sister you don't have to be
[1:36:08] a great man you don't have to do that
[1:36:09] all you've got to do is step out and
[1:36:11] receive what God's got for you and there
[1:36:14] will be an action in reaction amen
[1:36:17] Oh hallelujah that's what we need today
[1:36:20] sister Emmy would you come that's what
[1:36:22] we need today that's what we need is men
[1:36:24] and women who stand up to the forefront
[1:36:26] there and call the devil a liar I like
[1:36:30] this quote amen
[1:36:32] that's what we need is men and women who
[1:36:35] stand up to the forefront there and call
[1:36:37] the devil a liar and say Jesus Christ
[1:36:40] stripped you and robbed you of every
[1:36:42] right you had and I'm in Christ Jesus
[1:36:45] and the world belongs to me
[1:36:47] amen right hallelujah oh that's a
[1:36:51] position my brother and sister let's
[1:36:53] take this Word of God is giving
[1:36:56] preparation to the inner man we can

[1:37:02] battle and come out victorious because
[1:37:04] we can take these words right here and
[1:37:07] call the devil a liar hallelujah Satan
[1:37:11] you're simply a liar you've already been
[1:37:14] stripped and you've been robbed of every
[1:37:16] right you have you have nothing over on
[1:37:19] us because the word has prepared us to

[1:37:55] it to action and watch as you put an
[1:37:57] action forward to come closer to the
[1:38:00] Lord just the promise of the word says
[1:38:03] that God will bring that reaction which
[1:38:05] will change your life
[1:38:06] and we want to as a church be changed we
[1:38:10] don't want to just go day by day just
[1:38:12] doing the same thing over and over again
