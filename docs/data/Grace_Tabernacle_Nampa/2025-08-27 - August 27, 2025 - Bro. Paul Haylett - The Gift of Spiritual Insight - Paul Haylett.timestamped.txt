[8:30] Um, why don't we go to number 645?
[8:34] We'll stay in the same key.
[8:38] I thirsted in a barren land of sin and
[8:43] shame and nothing satisfying there I
[8:48] found.
[8:51] But to the blessed cross of Christ, one
[8:54] day I came, where springs of living
[8:58] water did abound.
[9:02] Now I'm drinking at the springs of
[9:05] living water.
[9:09] Oh, happy now am I. My soul they satisfy
[9:15] drinking at the springs of living water.
[9:21] Oh wonderful and bountiful supply.
[9:27] How sweet the living water from the
[9:30] hills of God. It makes me glad and happy
[9:35] all the way.
[9:39] Now glory, grace, and blessing mark the
[9:42] path I've taught. I'm shouting
[9:46] hallelujah every day.
[9:51] Drinking at the springs of living water.
[9:57] Oh, happy now am I. My soul they
[10:01] satisfy.
[10:03] Drinking at the springs of living water.
[10:09] Oh wonderful and bountiful supply.
[10:15] Oh sinner, won't you come today to
[10:18] Calary,
[10:21] a fountain there is hoing deep and wide.
[10:27] The Savior now invites you to the water
[10:31] free where thirsting spirits can be
[10:35] satisfied.
[10:39] Drinking at the springs of living water.
[10:45] Oh, happy now am I. My soul they
[10:49] satisfy.
[10:51] Drinking at the springs of living water.
[10:57] Oh, wonderful and bountiful supply. One
[11:01] more time. Oh, I'm drinking at the
[11:04] springs of living water.
[11:09] Happy now am I. My soul they satisfy.
[11:15] Drinking at the springs of living water.
[11:21] Oh, wonderful and bountiful supply.
[11:28] Amen.
[11:32] Let's go to number 816. We'll stay in
[11:34] the same key if we can.
[11:38] Start with the chorus.
[11:42] The more that I surrender,
[11:48] the lighter
[11:51] my Lord.
[11:55] The more that I release my care, the
[12:01] more you take control.
[12:07] The more that I can humble myself,
[12:14] the more you lift me up.
[12:19] Every day I live.
[12:23] Oh Lord, I love you more.
[12:32] And it gets easier
[12:35] to
[12:37] understand
[12:39] this road I'm traveling down.
[12:44] No more wavering
[12:48] or wondering.
[12:51] I'm standing on solid ground.
[12:57] And I know I'm headed to my future home.
[13:03] And the voice I hear is yours alone.
[13:10] Every day I live,
[13:14] Lord, I love you more.
[13:22] The more that I surrender,
[13:29] the lighter
[13:32] my Lord.
[13:35] The more that I
[13:38] release my cares, the more you take
[13:44] control.
[13:48] The more that I
[13:51] can humble myself,
[13:54] the more you lift me up.
[14:00] Every day I live,
[14:04] Lord, I love you more.
[14:13] The problems
[14:16] had yesterday
[14:18] are now stepping stones to a higher
[14:23] place.
[14:25] The trials that seemed so awesome to me
[14:31] are now my bers of victory.
[14:37] And I know I'm headed to my future hope.
[14:43] And the voice I hear is yours alone.
[14:50] Every day I live,
[14:54] Lord, I love you more.
[15:02] The more that I surrender,
[15:09] the lighter
[15:12] my Lord.
[15:15] The more that I release my cares, the
[15:22] more you take control.
[15:28] The more that I can humble myself,
[15:34] the more you lift me up.
[15:40] Every day I live,
[15:44] Lord, I love you more. Let's sing that
[15:49] one more time.
[15:52] Oh, the more that I surrender,
[16:00] the lighter
[16:02] my Lord.
[16:06] The more that I
[16:09] release my cares, the more you take
[16:15] control.
[16:19] The more that I can humble myself,
[16:25] the more you lift me up.
[16:31] Every day I live.
[16:35] Lord, I love you more.

[25:53] [Music]
[25:57] Have your way.
[26:04] Holy
[26:06] Spirit,
[26:08] fill our hearts
[26:11] and have your way. As we wait,
[26:18] oh, as we wait, we wait on you. And as
[26:27] we pray, we pray to you.
[26:33] Speak your word
[26:37] into our hearts and have your way.
[26:46] Oh, have your way.
[26:50] [Music]
[26:54] Have your way.
[27:01] Holy
[27:03] Spirit,
[27:05] fill our hearts and have your way
[27:12] as we wait.
[27:14] Oh, as we wait, we wait.
[27:20] [Music]
[27:21] And as we pray, we pray to you.
[27:28] Speak your word
[27:32] into our hearts and have your way. Let's
[27:38] sing verse one again.
[27:41] Oh, have your way.
[27:49] have your way.
[27:55] Holy Spirit,
[27:58] fill our hearts and have your way. One
[28:05] more time.
[28:08] Lord, have your way.
[28:15] Have your way.
[28:18] [Music]
[28:22] Holy
[28:23] Spirit,
[28:25] fill our hearts
[28:31] away.
[28:35] Amen.
[28:37] To be our prayer today,
[28:41] simply Lord have your way in us. Amen.
[28:45] There's so much influence in the world
[28:47] today. Everybody's got an opinion.
[28:50] Everybody's got a thought. There's so
[28:52] many anointings, you know, just uh
[28:55] studying and you know, we just see this,
[29:00] you know, where the spirits never die.
[29:02] And Satan, he takes his man, but the
[29:05] spirit's still here. God takes his man,
[29:09] but the spirit's still here. So, we know
[29:12] according to the word that every
[29:14] attribute that God poured out in this
[29:17] last day, every bit of truth, every bit
[29:20] of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is
[29:22] right here available to us. And I say,
[29:25] "Thank you, Lord." And certainly Satan,
[29:28] he's out here. He has a a voice. He's
[29:30] loud. He's persistent. He's bold. He's
[29:34] even vulgar as it is in his approach.
[29:37] But he's still Satan. And it doesn't
[29:40] matter that he's got a voice. He's got
[29:42] men that will yield themselves to him.
[29:44] It doesn't matter. It's just Satan and
[29:48] we're not interested. Amen. Thank you.
[29:50] Amen. God bless you. Enjoy the song
[29:52] service. Appreciate our musicians, each
[29:54] and every one. Let's just stand as we go
[29:57] into the word this evening. I want to
[29:59] once again just kind of carry a little
[30:01] bit on from uh Sunday uh to uh title
[30:06] this tonight the gift of spiritual
[30:08] insight. Amen. And this uh insight is
[30:12] just uh another word. I don't know if
[30:15] you'd say it's more sophisticated or
[30:17] more aligned, but it is the gift of
[30:19] spiritual understanding. And uh so as
[30:23] we'll look at this,
[30:25] we just have to really stop and realize
[30:29] just how blessed we are in this day that
[30:32] that God has dealt with our hearts and
[30:35] we we read the word and we read it as a
[30:38] new book. Amen. Not as an old book, not
[30:40] as a historical book, but a new book.
[30:44] and it speaks to our hearts and and it's
[30:46] in that realm right there that um we're
[30:49] not looking for a group revelation.
[30:52] Amen. God deals with us as individuals.
[30:54] And as he deals with us individuals, and
[30:56] we'll get into this a little further,
[30:59] we'll realize that while we're all here,
[31:01] we're believers, uh we're Christians,
[31:05] but we all are at different stages in
[31:07] our life. Amen. And um you know, we
[31:10] realize there's a time of the of the
[31:13] youth and then a teenager and young
[31:15] adults and young families. And as it
[31:19] goes on, I don't know, the blink of an
[31:21] eye, one day you wake up and well,
[31:23] you're older. I'll put it that way. And
[31:26] um seems like it just comes in the
[31:29] blink. And uh so in every one of those
[31:32] stages, God has a fresh word for us.
[31:35] Amen. It's not that we're living on an
[31:37] experience uh looking back many many
[31:41] years. You know, the Lord touched me
[31:42] once 25 years ago, but we stand here
[31:46] today and God is still answering
[31:48] prayers. He's still uh bringing fresh
[31:51] mana if we'd use that term to us each
[31:54] day. It's still speaking to our hearts.
[31:56] We open up our Bibles. We read our
[31:58] devotion and there's something stirring.
[32:01] And I just say thank you Lord because
[32:03] this is just a gift that has come direct
[32:06] from the throne of God to you and I. And
[32:09] what we get out of that is actually what
[32:11] we choose to get out of it. Uh we come
[32:13] and and uh if we come with a negative or
[32:17] doubts or fears or anxieties which is
[32:20] what Satan wants. He wants to plant that
[32:22] seed that causes you to question. And
[32:25] when you start to question, you start to
[32:27] pull back. And if he can cause you to
[32:29] question long enough, you'll find
[32:31] yourself totally backed out of your
[32:33] experience. And that's what Satan
[32:35] desires to do. If you wonder, Amen. Just
[32:38] look back as as Israel come through the
[32:41] wilderness of sin and we see how Dayan
[32:43] and Kora, how they must have sit around
[32:46] their campfire many, many nights and
[32:49] said, "You know what? Moses. Moses did
[32:52] this and Moses did that and Moses should
[32:55] have done this and Moses said God spoke
[32:59] to him. But I doubt it because if he
[33:01] had, he would have done this. And they
[33:05] convinced themselves that they were just
[33:08] as spiritual as Moses was. But yet when
[33:11] it come down to it, God said, "Moses is
[33:14] the man I spoke to." That's right.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Whatever voice spoke to Dayan and
[33:19] Corinth of Berum, my brother and sister,
[33:22] I have no doubt they had a voice that
[33:24] spoke to them. But God, come and prove
[33:26] it. And when God spoke to Moses, this
[33:28] wasn't Moses saying, "Everyone stand
[33:31] back. The earth is fixing to swallow
[33:33] them up." That was God told Moses, "Tell
[33:36] them." And I believe in that moment, I
[33:39] don't know, it might have been too late
[33:41] for them or it might have been a little
[33:43] window. They could have repented, but it
[33:46] didn't matter. God vindicated. Moses was
[33:49] his voice.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; And it didn't matter how many things
[33:53] they figured out around their campfire,
[33:55] in their tent. God said, "Moses is my
[33:58] man." And so, we have the same spirit
[34:01] has repeated itself in this day. There's
[34:04] many who claim they speak that God spoke
[34:07] to me and this is wrong and this is this
[34:09] and and it's all about this man has a
[34:12] flaw. this man has a failure. Well, may
[34:15] the man who is perfect, never
[34:17] contradicted himself, never missed or
[34:20] messed up the story, step forward,
[34:22] please.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; It just doesn't happen. But we're here
[34:27] today
[34:28] and the very fact that God says, "I
[34:30] chose to give the gift to you."
[34:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be on our merit. It's
[34:35] not going to be our ability, but God
[34:37] says, "I give the gift to you." Let's
[34:40] turn in first Corinthians and uh so just
[34:44] uh speaking once again on the gift of
[34:46] spiritual insight 1 Corinthians 38-23
[34:52] and uh very uh very interesting you know
[34:56] some people we we have met people
[34:58] through the years that are just uh
[35:01] terrified of being deceived
[35:03] uh and uh yet the word of God says that
[35:06] it would deceive the very elect if it
[35:08] were possible posible, but God's already
[35:11] set the boundaries and said it's not
[35:13] possible. So, if you read that incorrect
[35:16] or you read it with a lack of
[35:18] understanding, it leaves this idea that
[35:20] you're going to be deceived. And um my
[35:24] brother and sister, when God places his
[35:26] word in the life of his sons and
[35:28] daughters into their soul, into heart,
[35:31] Amen. God doesn't go along and say,
[35:33] "Man, I missed the target." You know,
[35:35] all the old stuff of Cupid. I always
[35:37] loved those cartoons years ago as a kid.
[35:40] I thought they were so funny. You know,
[35:42] there's three people in the park bench
[35:44] and Cupid's aiming there and his arrow
[35:46] goes wobble wobble and hits a different
[35:48] person. And you know, it's like as
[35:50] though God said, "I want you." And I
[35:53] didn't mean you. I meant you. No, God
[35:57] doesn't work that way. God's word is
[35:59] perfect. And it comes right down and
[36:01] hits the target. Let man Let no man
[36:05] deceive himself. Uhoh,
[36:08] we're worried about everybody else
[36:09] deceiving us.
[36:11] But the word says here as he's speaking
[36:14] to the Corinthians, "Let no man deceive
[36:16] himself. If any man among you seemth to
[36:19] be wise in this world, let him become a
[36:22] fool that he may be wise." Now, isn't it
[36:25] really hard? I I think all of us will
[36:28] have a moment, you know, the aha moment
[36:30] that you're right. You know, you're
[36:32] right. There's no way I'm wrong. I've
[36:33] got the Oh.
[36:36] I'm wrong.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; How can I be wrong? I can't be I'm
[36:41] wrong.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, we've
[36:46] got to come to the place that if we
[36:47] think we're wise, we must become the
[36:51] fool to be wise.
[36:53] For the wisdom of this world is
[36:55] foolishness with God. For it is written,
[36:57] he that taketh the wise in their own uh
[37:00] he taketh the wise in their own
[37:02] craftiness. And again, the Lord knoweth
[37:04] the thoughts of the wise, that they are
[37:07] vain. And yet, look at this. Man has
[37:09] striven since since man started to
[37:12] populate the earth. He's striven for uh
[37:15] wisdom. He's striven for knowledge. He's
[37:17] striven for the very thing that the word
[37:19] says, this will be the undoing of you.
[37:22] He taketh the wise in their craftiness.
[37:25] And again, the Lord knoweth the thoughts
[37:26] of the wise, that they are vain.
[37:28] Therefore, let no man glory in men, for
[37:31] all things are yours, whether Paul or
[37:34] Apollos or Cphus or the world or life or
[37:37] death or things present or things to
[37:39] come. All are yours and ye are Christ
[37:43] and Christ is God's.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we ask you to bless the
[37:48] service tonight. Lead us, Lord. Open
[37:50] your word to us. We pray in the name of
[37:52] Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated.
[37:56] Uh so as we look at this my brother and
[37:58] sister I I just think it's just such
[37:59] incredible scripture when you look at
[38:02] this for one verse 21 is is uh uh just
[38:06] reminds me I know of situations where
[38:09] people through the years you know they
[38:11] thought that their pastor was the only
[38:13] pastor on the face of the earth that was
[38:15] the greatest thing. Amen. And yet when
[38:18] that uh pastor failed they themselves
[38:22] become very very disheartened. They
[38:25] become very cynical, very costic,
[38:27] judgmental and in that because they had
[38:30] placed their trust uh they had placed
[38:33] their glory in a man. They had thought
[38:36] that this man was the ultimate and uh
[38:38] they failed to look far enough and look
[38:41] that if that man was a a man full of uh
[38:44] the word, full of life, full of glory,
[38:47] that it was God in that man. And they
[38:49] become very very upset when they see
[38:52] that the idol. You might say, I maybe
[38:54] I'll just go ahead and put it very
[38:56] bluntly. Uh many of those people that
[38:58] are in that situation are just simply
[39:01] idolattors and they just find something
[39:03] else. In most cases without deliverance
[39:06] from the Holy Spirit, they find
[39:07] something else to make their their idol.
[39:09] And many times uh knowledge becomes
[39:12] their idol. They will look, they will
[39:14] search, they are bound and determined to
[39:16] prove themselves right and everyone else
[39:18] wrong. But you know, the word says here,
[39:21] uh, these things are all yours. You
[39:23] don't need to glory in men. We've got
[39:25] the word of God. Christ is ours. He's
[39:28] here. The word is here tonight, and it's
[39:31] ours. We don't have to say, "Look, I
[39:33] I've got to go back somewhere to find
[39:36] someone to do this." And I love how
[39:38] Brother Brandham brings this out, and
[39:40] I'll just paraphrase it if you don't
[39:42] mind. Everything you need to make the
[39:44] rapture is already in you. If we'll take
[39:48] that for its face value, we don't need
[39:50] to go find the special man somewhere. We
[39:54] just need to get into the word because
[39:56] the word has already been released to us
[40:00] and it's ours to take possession of.
[40:02] Amen. As we use that example about being
[40:05] a gift. Amen. You can leave that gift as
[40:08] it were under the tree. You don't have
[40:11] to accept it. You don't have to take it.
[40:13] Whether it be your birthday and it's
[40:15] right there and all your friends and
[40:16] family give you, you can walk away from
[40:19] that gift. It's not wise. It's not
[40:21] prudent, but you can do that. And God
[40:24] has opened his word in this hour. And we
[40:27] are sitting here with this great gift uh
[40:30] of the Holy Spirit, a great gift of
[40:32] revelation given to us and it is ours to
[40:35] take. Now I would say my brother and
[40:39] sister that while we would look around
[40:41] the world today and we would see that um
[40:44] uh Christians are afflicted with every
[40:48] sickness and situation that is in the
[40:51] world today. In the book of
[40:52] Ecclesiastes, it says it happens to the
[40:54] rich and the poor, the wives and the
[40:56] unwise. So we don't see that as an
[40:59] exemption or get out of jail card. But
[41:02] my brother and sister, as we look around
[41:04] the world today, we can see this whole
[41:06] picture with great clarity. We get to
[41:10] see what is happening is not by
[41:12] accident. There's people consumed uh
[41:16] with with uh you know what's going to
[41:18] happen next. And we realize that that
[41:21] all of these things that are happening
[41:23] have been ordained of God. They're all
[41:26] in line with God's word. And so, you
[41:29] know, we would want to, you know, in
[41:31] human nature, we would want to change
[41:33] what is happening for a better world.
[41:36] But I tell you, my brother and sister,
[41:37] our better world is coming. When this
[41:39] one here is finished. Amen. When this is
[41:42] burnt over, the bride of Christ walks
[41:45] out on the ashes. Amen. When the earth
[41:47] has been purified. Now, let's not get
[41:49] the wrong idea of when we walk out on
[41:51] the ashes. You know, usually we would
[41:53] think of something as the ashes. it
[41:55] being a a filthy you know just uh
[41:59] everything turns black kind of world but
[42:01] actually the scripture is talking about
[42:04] purification. Amen. So when the earth
[42:07] has been purified back to its original
[42:10] condition before sin come in it. The
[42:12] bride of Christ walks out in that
[42:14] condition. Amen. And gets to enjoy the
[42:17] beauty as it would be Eden once again.
[42:20] Amen. Eden without contamination. And so
[42:24] as we get to see this world with
[42:25] clarity, now when I say we see the world
[42:28] with clarity, I'm not saying that we
[42:30] have an answer or insight to everything.
[42:34] Amen. It's uh in a world that we are
[42:37] living in, God says, I don't need you to
[42:40] understand the politics. Uh you know,
[42:42] brother Brandham shows us clear picture
[42:45] of politics. They're just dirty. They're
[42:47] filthy. It's inhabited with demons and
[42:50] liars and cheats and thieves and and uh
[42:53] many a good man went uh just talking of
[42:55] our nation went to Washington DC and in
[42:58] a few short years has been corrupted by
[43:00] the atmosphere that is there. So we
[43:03] don't understand all of those things.
[43:05] But what we do understand is God has
[43:07] prepared a way for his bride to live in
[43:11] this hour. Amen. Don't look back. We're
[43:14] not we don't need to go back and and try
[43:16] and find the revival of days gone by. We
[43:19] don't need to go back and try and get
[43:21] back into this position or that
[43:23] position, you know, but we can stand and
[43:25] with clarity know that what is happening
[43:28] God has already put in place and it's
[43:31] actually for our good. My it never feels
[43:34] good. I remember I always find a little
[43:37] humor in this if you don't mind. Amen.
[43:39] And I just remember, you know, and when
[43:41] my parents said, you know, uh, you don't
[43:44] understand, you know, I'm going to spank
[43:46] you and this hurts me, then it's going
[43:48] to hurt you. And I used to, as a kid
[43:50] think, yeah, right. And then I found
[43:53] myself as a parent speaking that to my
[43:55] children because I started to understand
[43:58] that really what we want to do is just
[44:01] love our children into correction. And
[44:04] then we find ourselves in a spiritual
[44:06] realm wanting God to just love us into
[44:09] correction. But it doesn't work that
[44:11] way. Amen. Sometimes, you know, as the
[44:14] scripture says, spoil the rod. I mean,
[44:16] spare the rod, spoil the child. And and
[44:18] in that realm, we'll see. Now, this is
[44:20] not talking about beating, but it's
[44:22] proper godly correction. And we'll see
[44:25] how that God I think every one of us
[44:27] here today would be able to say we have
[44:30] experienced correction. And in the end
[44:32] we can say thank you Lord for this
[44:35] correction. Amen. Now if you look at
[44:37] this we see a religious world today that
[44:41] very unabashedly unashamedly declares
[44:44] their wisdom. Amen. That the world is
[44:47] just full of people that are saying I
[44:49] was talking with the Lord or the Lord
[44:52] showed me or the Lord opened the word to
[44:55] me. And yet the thing that is so
[44:57] striking they're it's they're often
[45:00] times associating it with their ability
[45:03] that they are a special person and that
[45:05] that they've got this and and they do
[45:08] this that they have a greater
[45:10] understanding of God. But what it is my
[45:13] brother and sister, we've been taught,
[45:14] Amen. It's been put before us that all
[45:17] you need to do is just do a simple uh uh
[45:21] test. Amen. What is the fruit?
[45:24] And you'll find that in the world we
[45:26] live in today, most of the fruit doesn't
[45:28] pass the test. So what we're seeing is
[45:32] what they believe is spiritual insight
[45:35] is actually religious spirits. And
[45:38] brother Brandham said that a religious
[45:39] spirit is one of the worst spirits that
[45:41] there is. Amen. Because they believe
[45:43] that they're right. They'll testify that
[45:45] they're right. They're forceful about
[45:47] the fact that they're right, but they
[45:49] actually have no understanding of God.
[45:52] So their understanding of God is not
[45:55] producing the fruit of the word. And yet
[45:58] they are very bold to say we are right
[46:01] and you are wrong. They're very bold to
[46:03] say we can prove this. You know I'm
[46:06] telling you my brother and sister that
[46:08] you know I I was uh googling uh you know
[46:12] some different things and and uh you
[46:14] know I googled Jericho and the only
[46:17] thing AI can produce about Jericho is it
[46:20] might have happened. Yeah.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, I'm going to base my
[46:24] experience upon a 21st century approach
[46:28] to God, which AI or Google should be
[46:32] able to give me something. And if it
[46:33] doesn't produce it for me, then it must
[46:36] not exist. But my brother and sister, I
[46:38] want you to give me an AI version of
[46:41] what is faith. It will give you some
[46:43] words, but that will not help you in the
[46:46] time of uh the the gravest trials of
[46:49] your life. that will not AI is not going
[46:52] to give you something to hold on to.
[46:54] It's not going to heal you. It's not
[46:56] going to deliver you. It's not going to
[46:57] give you a sound mind or give you peace.
[47:00] And this is the world we live in where
[47:02] they need that kind of evidence. And I
[47:04] just want you to prove to me tonight
[47:06] with some empirical evidence that God
[47:09] has ever spoken to you, that God has
[47:11] ever deal dealt with you. I need you to
[47:14] produce something tangible I can lay
[47:16] right here.
[47:20] Is that what the word says God does?
[47:23] &gt;&gt; No. God comes along and says those
[47:26] things that are not
[47:29] are.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; And where does he put that?
[47:34] He doesn't put it out here to be brought
[47:36] up by AI. He doesn't put it out here to
[47:38] put it out in a world to say, you know,
[47:41] I need some faith. Let me Google it.
[47:44] But God's laying that word down in the
[47:47] hearts of sons and daughters of God. And
[47:49] your experience about how that you come
[47:52] to that will be different than mine
[47:54] because there's no way our lives are
[47:56] ever an exact duplicate. But I tell you,
[47:58] I've shared it with the church, an aha
[48:00] moment in my teenage years when I was
[48:03] really, really drifting away from the
[48:04] Lord. Amen. That a man ran out in the
[48:07] road on icy roads. ran out in the road
[48:10] in front of us and we looped around and
[48:12] around and around and there was a big
[48:14] ravine with no guard rail and the pickup
[48:17] goes over the edge and I just remember
[48:19] the only response that came out of my
[48:22] mouth was Lord help me
[48:24] &gt;&gt; and I've shared this to the church a
[48:26] rock
[48:27] &gt;&gt; this big is what stopped a pickup from
[48:30] plunging into a I don't know uh a few
[48:33] hundred foot deep gully and my brother
[48:36] and sister you Can't Google that.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; You're not going to find that as
[48:41] evidence, but it's something that's
[48:43] registered deep down in my heart that I
[48:45] do believe in that very moment the Lord
[48:48] heard my cry.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I had an older brother that
[48:53] was there and I don't fault him, but uh
[48:55] he he he had totally different response.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; The words out of his mouth were an
[49:00] entirely different vocabulary. It it's
[49:03] good deal that his vocabulary didn't
[49:06] hinder my vocabulary. Amen. But you see
[49:09] my brother and sister, that's something
[49:11] I've carried now since I was 17 years
[49:14] old that God hears my cry. Amen. And I
[49:18] believe each and every one of you would
[49:19] have something in your own life where
[49:21] you would be able to look back and you'd
[49:23] be able to say, you know what, this is
[49:25] something that God has showed me. And
[49:27] sometimes we'll look at it and say, you
[49:29] know, I'm not sure exactly why it
[49:31] happened, why it happened. But when God
[49:33] works in our life, he puts these little
[49:36] things. Now, remember when Israel was
[49:38] going across the wilderness, we won't
[49:40] get into specifics. Brother David Nash
[49:42] once preached a lovely service about
[49:45] carrying the rocks out of the river and
[49:47] building a memorial there. Each rock had
[49:49] its place. Do you remember that, Brother
[49:51] David? Amen. And I still remember that
[49:53] sermon. Maybe not exact detail, but in
[49:56] concept. And you see what God has done
[49:58] is he's brought us to a place that we've
[50:01] picked up things and we've created a
[50:03] memorial that means something to our
[50:06] life. It's not a memorial that will
[50:08] boast to the whole world. We're not
[50:10] going to publish it on I what is that
[50:12] CBN or whatever that uh is uh Yeah, I
[50:15] think that's correct. And and we're not
[50:17] going to publish that. We're not going
[50:18] to go but it means something to you and
[50:20] I. And God's bringing us into this place
[50:23] where these things aren't to the world
[50:26] to see. Therefore, you and I in our time
[50:28] of need, our time of refreshing to be
[50:31] able to look back and say, "You know
[50:32] what? In this time, Amen. here's a stone
[50:35] that I have as a memorial in my life.
[50:38] And I have set it down that God answered
[50:41] a prayer." When I was crying and said,
[50:43] "I am in need, Lord. I'm in desperate
[50:45] need." And he come on the scene. And God
[50:48] has now given you a stone that's
[50:50] anchored in the word of God that you can
[50:52] look back and say, "In my time of need,
[50:54] he heard my cry." Amen. And this is what
[50:57] God is doing. It's not, as brother
[50:59] Brandham put it, people misinterpret
[51:01] some of this. Brother Brandham said in
[51:03] this last days here, it's not going to
[51:06] be a public display, but the world loves
[51:09] public displays. They want to have
[51:11] something where, you know, the cameras
[51:13] are set up just right and it just
[51:16] catches it all and we can publish this
[51:18] out to the world, this great thing that
[51:20] is happening. But what really interests
[51:23] me is God moving behind the scene. God
[51:26] moving when no one's looking. God moving
[51:28] when it's just you and him. And that
[51:31] he's coming down placing a memorial
[51:33] stone in our lives that we can remember.
[51:36] Amen. And you say, "Well, I remember I
[51:38] got the Holy Ghost on this day, at this
[51:40] time, this hour. I stand here today. I
[51:43] can't name you the day, the time, the
[51:45] hour." Because it was such a gradual
[51:48] progression of God coming to me and
[51:50] proving and then Satan trying to push me
[51:52] back and God coming and proving and
[51:54] Satan trying to push me back until one
[51:57] day you might say, "We're over the
[51:59] hump." And we'll look at that and we can
[52:00] look back and say, "Now I know God was
[52:03] there all the time." And it's not like
[52:06] it was one moment and it's just been
[52:08] victory ever since. There was bloody
[52:10] battles. There was fierce battles. There
[52:13] were battles that we carry scars and
[52:15] we'll carry scars to the redemption of
[52:18] this body. But we'll come one day and
[52:20] every one of those will be able to say
[52:22] thank you Lord because this became a
[52:25] memorial and this became a memorial and
[52:28] this became a memorial. And I know my
[52:31] God hears my prayer. I know he hears my
[52:33] cry. Amen. But we don't have to stand up
[52:37] and declare to the world our wisdom.
[52:40] That we have more revelation than anyone
[52:43] else. It doesn't matter, my brother and
[52:45] sister, how much revelation you have. It
[52:47] doesn't matter how much revelation they
[52:49] have. Our revelation just needs to match
[52:52] God's word. There's where the real
[52:54] measure is at. You can have all kinds of
[52:57] revelations, but if it doesn't match the
[53:00] word for the hour, Amen. and the season.
[53:03] And we know what the prophet meant by
[53:05] that. We can go back and say, "Let's
[53:07] build an ark and we'll hide in the ark."
[53:09] Well, that's not the revelation for the
[53:11] hour. Amen. God wants to pour his spirit
[53:13] out in this hour and prove to you that
[53:16] he's here
[53:18] &gt;&gt; and he has.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you know, I remember as a kid
[53:23] it was such a cliche. We're going to
[53:24] give them a word test. Well, I'll tell
[53:27] you, I find it as I look back maybe
[53:29] tainted by my own memory, but uh you
[53:32] know, a lot of the times the things that
[53:34] people use for a word test, they
[53:35] themselves couldn't pass.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; So, it's not a matter of what I can give
[53:40] as a test to you, but it's a matter of
[53:44] does do we pass this test?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; That that's what matters. It's not
[53:49] holding everyone in the church to to
[53:51] meet a criteria that you've got to fit
[53:54] this, you've got to this, you got to
[53:56] that, but it's whether we please God or
[53:58] not is the real test of the day that we
[54:01] live in. And so I I maybe sound like I'm
[54:05] taking a big step here, but for the sake
[54:07] of time now, saints, you will find that
[54:10] the flocks appetite
[54:13] will determine what they're fed.
[54:18] I just watched a deal the other day. I
[54:20] thought it was quite entertaining
[54:22] actually. A church went to all the
[54:24] effort to build a zipline. Big building.
[54:27] Big big building. They built a zipline
[54:30] inside their church so that the pastor
[54:33] dressed up in his costume could out of
[54:37] some mechanical balcony in the deal come
[54:41] ziplining down through the church
[54:44] and land down on the platform
[54:47] to make a point.
[54:50] I if id went to church there I would
[54:52] have said I'm next.
[54:54] I'm going to try that. That looks fun.
[54:58] But you see, is that the gospel? No, my
[55:01] brother and sister, it's actually more a
[55:03] form of an entertainment. And and you
[55:06] know, it's like all good preachers need
[55:09] to be a good comedian before they're a
[55:10] good preacher so that they can wow the
[55:13] people. And uh already, you know, once
[55:16] you get started in, you need to already
[55:17] be planning your church expansion.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; That's the approach that they're taking.
[55:24] But
[55:26] the appetite of the flock is what will
[55:29] determine what they're fed.
[55:32] And so I want you to to follow this
[55:36] because we're not we're not looking at
[55:39] this as really concerning the preacher.
[55:42] Okay? It's not about look at this to the
[55:44] preacher. But um if if you would care to
[55:48] if you want to just go uh uh 1960 uh
[55:52] July the 22nd watchman what of the night
[55:55] very very very good service. Amen.
[55:58] Paragraph 40. God said in the Bible take
[56:01] heed to the flock which the Holy Spirit
[56:03] has made you a watchman
[56:07] made you a watchman over. Be sure
[56:09] they're fed with the right food making
[56:12] ready for the coming of the Lord.
[56:15] Now, I just pulled that out because it
[56:17] fit what I wanted it to fit. How's that?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; But see, it really comes down to the
[56:24] preacher, the ministry. Those men of God
[56:28] need to take heed of this flock that God
[56:32] has put them in charge of. Not to feed
[56:35] them a comedian act, not to feed them an
[56:37] aerial show, not to feed them some kind
[56:40] of, you know, bingo night. That's not
[56:42] going to get them ready for the coming
[56:44] of the Lord. But brother Brandham's
[56:46] saying, "Hey, what you need to do is uh
[56:49] you've been made a watchman over that."
[56:52] Now, a watchman doesn't mean that he
[56:54] owns them.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; People are like, "We got the best pastor
[57:02] ever." What you need to be saying is how
[57:05] good a watchman.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; We've got a really good watchman that
[57:08] God has given us. He cares about our
[57:10] souls enough to preach the word to us.
[57:14] Whether we're always comfortable with
[57:16] that word or not, whether that puts us
[57:18] in a position that we have to change or
[57:21] sometimes, you know, we get
[57:22] uncomfortable, be sure that they're fed
[57:25] with the right food, making ready for
[57:28] the coming of the Lord. So, it's not
[57:30] just all about pizza party and sloppy
[57:32] joe's and fellowships in the basement,
[57:35] although we should have a little more of
[57:37] that, I do believe. But my brother and
[57:39] sister, it's not about that side of it.
[57:41] It's about spiritual food in due season.
[57:45] Now, due season is not to talk about us
[57:48] building an ark. It's not to talk about
[57:51] us, you know, having a rock in the
[57:53] desert. Literal. Uh it's not talking
[57:56] about us having a brazen serpent.
[57:58] Literal. We're not going back into those
[58:00] seasons. They were for their time. But
[58:03] we're here today given the word. And the
[58:06] word rightly divided will feed the bride
[58:09] of Christ. Amen. There's so many people.
[58:12] Well, how many denominations are there?
[58:14] There's so many churches, thousands of
[58:16] churches here in the United States. And
[58:19] everyone's got a little idea that it's
[58:21] their own idea and this is the way it
[58:24] is. But I say tonight, Grace Tabernacle,
[58:27] we want the word unadulterated and pure.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not looking for a man's idea
[58:34] or man's interpretation because we'll
[58:37] see how men change. There'll be men that
[58:39] will come and be delivered out of a
[58:41] trinitarian spirit and they'll come, but
[58:44] they don't really catch it correctly and
[58:46] so they want to come and they worship
[58:48] like a oneness and then overall they
[58:51] come to see maybe an air of the oneness
[58:53] and they don't have revelation. So they
[58:55] just go back and become a trinitarian
[58:57] again and just justify where they're at.
[58:59] My brother and sister, I'm sorry. I want
[59:01] the word of God. Amen. The Lord,
[59:06] my God, is how I'm going to say it
[59:07] tonight. It's not three gods.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; But look at the world. They chop it up.
[59:15] And even their theologians say, "Well,
[59:17] we really can't explain it because it is
[59:19] God." Well, good. If you can't explain
[59:22] it, then why don't you just realize that
[59:24] John 1 says that God was the word. Amen.
[59:27] and the word come and was made flesh in
[59:30] our midst.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want something a little more
[59:33] simplistic than trying to rightly divide
[59:35] the office, just go back to the
[59:37] simplicity of the world, the word, I
[59:39] mean. And so you look at this and then
[59:41] people, they put a lot of effort to
[59:44] convince you you're wrong. But the word,
[59:49] I think I can say this with confidence,
[59:51] has already convinced you you're right.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a man. The word.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a theologian.
[1:00:02] The word. Not a historian. The word.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what is it? It's the right
[1:00:09] food. Amen. We're back in a day that the
[1:00:12] right food. And I tell you, I want the
[1:00:14] right food. That's my prayer today.
[1:00:16] Lord, I before I walk out that door,
[1:00:18] every time I preach in this church,
[1:00:19] actually, every time I preach anywhere,
[1:00:22] I stop before I walk out and I say,
[1:00:24] "Lord, let me only speak the truth." Now
[1:00:26] my brother and sister, this might seem a
[1:00:28] paradox and hold on so you don't
[1:00:30] misunderstand me. But when I say that,
[1:00:32] I'm not saying the right word because
[1:00:35] I'm a message believer. I hope you I
[1:00:37] hope you can follow where I'm coming
[1:00:39] from. I'm putting this in a context as
[1:00:42] so broad in a sense of Lord, I want to
[1:00:46] say the right words. If I have any
[1:00:51] understanding
[1:00:52] and it's not right, change it. That's
[1:00:55] right.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz I want to only speak truth.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:01] Amen.
[1:01:03] You know, going back into history, just
[1:01:05] give you an idea. Amen. World War II,
[1:01:09] one of the greatest deceptions the
[1:01:10] United States or the Allies had over
[1:01:13] over um Germany is that they took a dead
[1:01:17] man,
[1:01:19] clothed him up as though he was a
[1:01:20] military man and put false information
[1:01:23] on him and dumped him in the ocean off
[1:01:25] the shores of of North Africa. And when
[1:01:28] they found him, they believed they had
[1:01:30] found a a man who had been in an
[1:01:33] airplane that must have been shot down
[1:01:35] carrying these precious secrets. And
[1:01:38] they believed what they did. So, amen.
[1:01:40] You can have a dead man testify a lie to
[1:01:44] you.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; I hope you follow me. Amen. It's not
[1:01:47] somebody you'd say, "I really trust this
[1:01:49] guy." No, he's a dead man. Amen. And
[1:01:52] there's many a person today that is
[1:01:54] spiritually dead that is testifying and
[1:01:58] people believe that. But we are here
[1:02:00] today with a living word. We're here
[1:02:03] today with a living Christ in our midst.
[1:02:05] Amen. Now, Matthew 24:44-
[1:02:09] 47. Therefore, be also ready. For in
[1:02:13] such an hour as you think not, the Son
[1:02:15] of Man cometh, who then is a faithful
[1:02:17] and wise servant, whom his lord hath
[1:02:20] made ruler over his household to give
[1:02:23] them meat in due season. Blessed is thy
[1:02:27] servant, whom his lord, when he cometh,
[1:02:29] shall find uh so doing. Verily, I say
[1:02:32] unto you, he that shall make him ruler
[1:02:34] over all his goods. So it this is right
[1:02:38] here in scripture, Matthew laying this
[1:02:40] out that it is there that it is not how
[1:02:44] flashy or finely dressed or how
[1:02:46] articulate or vocabulary wise or even
[1:02:50] how intelligent.
[1:02:53] A good servant's one who's simply giving
[1:02:55] the people meat in due season. And
[1:03:00] you'll find that in the day that we live
[1:03:02] in as many denominations, I did a little
[1:03:05] research on that, many denominations uh
[1:03:08] will not allow a man to be ordained in
[1:03:11] their denomination now unless he has a
[1:03:13] college degree. And so I can see that um
[1:03:16] you know where we're headed that um I
[1:03:20] shouldn't be your pastor
[1:03:22] cuz until you can make it out of high
[1:03:24] school with that piece of paper, you
[1:03:26] definitely not going to make it to a
[1:03:28] college degree. And if I had a co
[1:03:31] college degree tonight, would that make
[1:03:33] me sound better?
[1:03:35] Make me look better,
[1:03:39] cause me to speak truth better?
[1:03:42] No. See how man has went off in their
[1:03:45] own idea of what it takes?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; To present God to the people.
[1:03:51] Now, lest it would sound like the
[1:03:53] denomination or the preachers are messed
[1:03:55] up, remember it's the flock's appetite
[1:04:00] that controls what they receive.
[1:04:04] So, we see what the world is today. It
[1:04:06] wants more education. It wants more
[1:04:09] refined. It wants more finesse. It wants
[1:04:11] the gospel to sound better. I've shared
[1:04:14] with you and pardon me for deviating for
[1:04:16] this. I shared with you many years ago
[1:04:18] how it was that that man managed a
[1:04:21] funeral home, a well-known funeral home
[1:04:23] here. Uh I did a sister's funeral and
[1:04:26] and uh by God's grace, I could speak
[1:04:29] such wonderful things about the sister
[1:04:31] because God had did great things in her
[1:04:33] life. And you know, the the funeral home
[1:04:35] guy says, "Hey, look, our resident
[1:04:38] minister is going to retire and we'd
[1:04:40] like to offer you the job." And I look
[1:04:42] back on it. It actually would have been
[1:04:43] quite a lucrative job when you really
[1:04:46] think about that. Sorry to sound so
[1:04:47] carnal, but you know, uh, to get paid,
[1:04:50] you know, hundreds of dollars to just
[1:04:52] speak for one hour and do that, but, you
[1:04:55] know, I'm as good a a job as that
[1:04:59] sounded like so easy. Could make way
[1:05:02] more money than I was earning at that
[1:05:04] time, you know, just to work a few hours
[1:05:06] a week. But the problem was somewhere
[1:05:08] along the line, they want you to send
[1:05:10] them to heaven.
[1:05:13] when they're getting on the other bus.
[1:05:17] And so, you see what it would be? You'd
[1:05:20] have to become a liar to earn the easy
[1:05:22] money. And so, that's the world we live
[1:05:25] in today. I knew the minister. My family
[1:05:29] knew the minister that had been there.
[1:05:31] And he told me, "Paul, you really should
[1:05:33] take the job because it it is just kind
[1:05:36] of a no-brainer and you're not in
[1:05:38] control of their destination anyhow.
[1:05:42] But I'm in control of my destination
[1:05:45] and you're in control of your
[1:05:47] destination. Amen. It's how we respond
[1:05:50] to the word. What our appetite is is
[1:05:54] what we will be fed. Amen. And if you
[1:05:58] don't have truth, then what will your
[1:06:00] appetite be? Amen. You look at that. God
[1:06:03] is good. So I just want to be a a good
[1:06:06] ruler over the household of the Lord and
[1:06:10] be able to bring meat in due season.
[1:06:13] Amen. Now, so being very direct here,
[1:06:17] not to be judgmental, but it's direct. A
[1:06:19] denominational diet is for
[1:06:21] denominational appetite. Amen. A word
[1:06:25] diet is for a word appetite. And so
[1:06:29] whichever position we're in, that is
[1:06:31] what we will go feed on. So what we're
[1:06:33] looking at in this time that God has
[1:06:35] given us a gift of spiritual insight,
[1:06:38] we're able to sift through all of the
[1:06:41] aspects of religion to realize that some
[1:06:44] religion is good. It's a covering,
[1:06:45] right? We are covered by the word of
[1:06:47] God. So saying we've got religion. In
[1:06:50] fact, you'll hear sometimes brother
[1:06:51] Brown said, "I feel religious right
[1:06:53] now." Amen. He's feeling the moving of
[1:06:55] the Holy Spirit. He's feeling the
[1:06:57] presence of God. And he says, "I feel
[1:06:59] religious right now." But my brother and
[1:07:01] sister, it's quite a difference to feel
[1:07:03] religious and be religious. Amen. To
[1:07:07] just be there that as long as I'm under
[1:07:10] the cloak of this, then we're we're
[1:07:12] good. Everything's fine. But God gives
[1:07:14] us spiritual insight. Now, I'm going to
[1:07:16] just ask you kind of a blanket comment.
[1:07:19] Have we felt the moving of the Holy
[1:07:20] Spirit?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've seen God move in our church.
[1:07:25] We've seen God answer prayer in this
[1:07:26] church. We've seen God heal people in
[1:07:28] this church. We've seen God deliver
[1:07:31] people in this church, my brother and
[1:07:33] sister. And when you feel God moving,
[1:07:36] Amen. that is a presence that we as
[1:07:39] humans would say, I feel it was very
[1:07:41] religious. It was very an atmosphere. It
[1:07:45] was good. But you see, when the prophet
[1:07:47] of God said that you can be anointed of
[1:07:50] the Holy Ghost on your flesh is what it
[1:07:52] comes down to, all the days of your life
[1:07:54] and still go to hell. So you can sit in
[1:07:56] a service and the presence of God moves
[1:07:59] in that service and we can walk out and
[1:08:01] say God was here tonight. But I want to
[1:08:03] know was he in our tabernacle?
[1:08:06] Amen. Did we let him in the door of our
[1:08:08] tabernacle? Was it was he resident in
[1:08:10] our tabernacle? Amen. So it's obvious
[1:08:13] God will feed his people for the season
[1:08:16] that they're living in. I think we can
[1:08:17] testify of that that we each one have
[1:08:19] come to times in our life whether we've
[1:08:22] been anxiety, depression, uh you know
[1:08:24] questions that we have need deliverances
[1:08:27] and the Lord comes and he ministers to
[1:08:30] us in that season and it's there that
[1:08:32] we'll come and we start to by the
[1:08:34] preaching of the word start to
[1:08:37] understand that God is walking with us.
[1:08:39] He says I'll be with you even in you and
[1:08:42] we start to realize this is taking
[1:08:44] place. I I'm fulfilling this scripture.
[1:08:47] It's not some ambiguous thing out here
[1:08:49] that he just said it, but literally God
[1:08:52] is walking with us and he's right here
[1:08:54] and he's in us and his spirit is
[1:08:56] speaking to us. And we look at that and
[1:08:58] God's laying us spiritual insight into
[1:09:00] us, building us up that he really truly
[1:09:04] is here.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; He really truly is in us. He's really
[1:09:08] truly guiding us.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. This doesn't sound super
[1:09:12] spiritual. This is not real deep, but
[1:09:14] it's just a good reminder. I believe it
[1:09:16] is a good reminder that God's word comes
[1:09:19] down in the simplicity of our daytoday
[1:09:22] walk, our daytoday life that God says,
[1:09:24] "I'm going to come. I'll be with you.
[1:09:27] Just trust me. If you'll just come right
[1:09:28] here, right now, and just trust me, and
[1:09:31] take the next step, I'm with you." And
[1:09:34] in fact, when Satan, when all hail would
[1:09:37] assail you, uh God says, "Don't worry.
[1:09:39] I'm in you
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; and I'll never forsake you. So all we
[1:09:43] got to do is hold on for another minute.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hold on for another minute. Amen.
[1:09:50] And so we're living in this time, living
[1:09:51] in this age, and God promised fresh
[1:09:55] mana. Every age had the word for its
[1:09:58] day. Are we any different? No, sir.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; And in fact, I come across a quote. We
[1:10:04] won't quote it. I think it was good. I
[1:10:06] don't want to get sidetracked, but my
[1:10:08] brother and sister, the word that was
[1:10:10] preached for this day is more real right
[1:10:14] now than it was the day it was preached.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; More effective, more alive right now
[1:10:23] than when it was preached.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Now, the naysayers are wanting something
[1:10:28] fresh for the age,
[1:10:33] but not in the sense that God's dealing.
[1:10:35] They want something to fit culture.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; I talked to a man one day and he told me
[1:10:42] he was really excited how the church was
[1:10:44] going to start doing dances and start
[1:10:46] doing these things for young people
[1:10:49] because they want to connect with them.
[1:10:51] The culture has changed and we need to
[1:10:53] connect with these young people. Well,
[1:10:56] time went on and I seen the man again
[1:10:58] and I was like, "Hey, how's that working
[1:11:00] out?" And he said, "We quit that." And I
[1:11:04] said,"Wh?"
[1:11:05] And he said, 'Because the young people
[1:11:07] were coming to these things and well,
[1:11:10] pardon me for saying this online or even
[1:11:12] out loud, but we found them in the back
[1:11:14] rooms kissing and hugging and doing
[1:11:16] things that they shouldn't do. And and
[1:11:18] the atmosphere of it was and and people
[1:11:21] that didn't even know that was going on
[1:11:23] started coming into the church and
[1:11:25] saying, "The atmosphere of the church
[1:11:27] has changed. What's happening?" Well,
[1:11:30] what's happening is they embraced the
[1:11:31] culture which is a spirit of this day
[1:11:34] and the Holy Spirit and the spirit of
[1:11:36] this day don't dwell in the same place.
[1:11:39] And he says, so the pastor one day after
[1:11:42] a short while said, we've made a
[1:11:44] mistake. And you have to applaud the man
[1:11:46] would would admit that he'd made a
[1:11:48] mistake and the damage
[1:11:51] was done.
[1:11:57] And he said, "Our church has had the
[1:11:58] greatest falling away of our young
[1:12:00] people that it's ever experienced."
[1:12:04] What it was? They started out to help
[1:12:06] them.
[1:12:09] And Satan fooled them and they damaged
[1:12:13] them.
[1:12:15] My brother and sisters, see how slippery
[1:12:17] Satan is? But I tell you, you got a son
[1:12:19] or daughter of God. Amen. Satan might
[1:12:22] try to do some damage, but the Holy
[1:12:24] Spirit will come and he'll set
[1:12:26] everything back in order. So, the fresh
[1:12:29] mana of our day for this day, uh, is the
[1:12:33] word speaking to you.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Now, I I hope you don't mind me putting
[1:12:37] it this way. People talk about fresh
[1:12:40] mana, but my brother and sister, just
[1:12:42] because the preacher is preaching
[1:12:43] something out of the Bible or the
[1:12:45] message that you've never heard before,
[1:12:47] and you'd say that's fresh mana, unless
[1:12:49] it's feeding you, it's not really fresh
[1:12:52] mana.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; It's got to be something you can eat
[1:12:56] that gives you strength to stand up and
[1:12:59] do the right thing. Amen. To live what
[1:13:01] you're called to live. So, we live in
[1:13:04] different seasons of our life. And I I I
[1:13:07] already kind of mentioned that, but just
[1:13:08] real quickly, uh uh every one of us, we
[1:13:11] could just go down this side, that side,
[1:13:14] and realize that every one of us is in a
[1:13:16] different season, a different time of
[1:13:18] our life. And this, I'm going to be just
[1:13:20] very bold. This is what makes it very
[1:13:22] hard for a a minister, a pastor, because
[1:13:25] you're trying to relate from, I don't
[1:13:27] know, 12 years old to to um 60 or
[1:13:31] roughly 60 on this side. uh in in that
[1:13:34] realm, you know, whatever age she is.
[1:13:37] And um
[1:13:41] and we go through this and and you got
[1:13:44] to preach a gospel and you're like,
[1:13:45] "Now, I've got to it's got to be
[1:13:47] relevant." Now, imagine a man in his
[1:13:49] mind. It's got to be relevant for you.
[1:13:53] You you you you'll go crazy.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; You go crazy trying to make it relevant
[1:14:00] for every individual. But if you just
[1:14:03] preach the word and they are sons and
[1:14:06] daughters of God, which I believe
[1:14:07] everyone here tonight is. Amen. When the
[1:14:10] word comes out, it comes in such a
[1:14:13] fashion that it becomes relevant to each
[1:14:16] individual for their position, their
[1:14:18] stage of life, their condition
[1:14:20] spiritually. It becomes relevant to
[1:14:22] them. and someone sitting on the other
[1:14:24] side of the church would come to an
[1:14:26] entirely different conclusion over the
[1:14:28] very same things preached because it now
[1:14:31] the Holy Spirit made it relevant for
[1:14:33] their life. Amen. This is the grace of
[1:14:36] God and the hour we live in. This is how
[1:14:38] God comes and preaches to a body of
[1:14:41] believers without the preacher trying to
[1:14:43] say now I I need to be able to make it
[1:14:45] good for you and I' I've got to make it
[1:14:46] good for them and I I've got to make it
[1:14:48] good for the young people so that it's
[1:14:50] relevant to them. But if the Holy Ghost
[1:14:52] is coming touching the lives of those
[1:14:54] young people, whatever is preached will
[1:14:57] be relevant to their life. And God knows
[1:14:59] how to do that. Because on the day of
[1:15:01] Pentecost, my brother and sister, very
[1:15:03] simple. I just love this. It spoke to me
[1:15:06] as I was listening to the prophet the
[1:15:07] other day in the upper room. Amen. As
[1:15:10] that Holy Spirit come down, it separated
[1:15:13] itself in cloven tongues of fire. Amen.
[1:15:16] And it didn't go over there and say,
[1:15:18] "Well, let's see. Now I got to figure
[1:15:19] out how to be relevant to Sister Vika. I
[1:15:22] need to be relevant to Sister Jerry. I
[1:15:24] need to be relevant to to, you know, uh,
[1:15:27] Sister Vanessa and and to you also. It's
[1:15:31] got to be relevant to you. And how am I
[1:15:33] going to do this? No. The Holy Ghost
[1:15:36] separated itself, come down in a cloven
[1:15:39] tongue of fire and touched everyone.
[1:15:41] Same fire. Amen. same Holy Ghost come
[1:15:45] down and didn't say, "I'll be this to
[1:15:47] this person and that to that person."
[1:15:49] But when it come down and touched it, it
[1:15:52] was the word. It was God himself. And it
[1:15:55] was relevant to the life of that
[1:15:57] individual. And they walked away and
[1:15:59] said, "You know what? God heard my cry.
[1:16:01] God knew my heart. God knew my
[1:16:04] situation." Amen. And our situations
[1:16:06] might be as diverse as there is
[1:16:08] humanity. And yet the word comes and
[1:16:11] it's the answer for every situation.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; We don't have to try and preach a
[1:16:17] culture.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; We need to preach the word and the word
[1:16:21] is sufficient for this culture. Amen. So
[1:16:25] you look at this the seasons of our life
[1:16:28] of the different needs. Now some live
[1:16:30] for today.
[1:16:33] Now there is a relevance to living for
[1:16:36] today.
[1:16:38] Amen.
[1:16:39] I had landlords
[1:16:42] quite successful from their hard work
[1:16:44] through the years and
[1:16:47] they had started out to say, "You know
[1:16:48] what? When we retire, we want you to
[1:16:50] farm our ground."
[1:16:53] And then they proceeded to farm seven
[1:16:55] more years
[1:16:57] because they were afraid like $10
[1:16:59] million wasn't enough to retire on. And
[1:17:02] they just kept working. They called up
[1:17:04] one day and said, "Um, we can't do this
[1:17:07] anymore."
[1:17:08] uh you know take care of the farm
[1:17:11] but you see every dream that they had in
[1:17:13] life talking in a natural sense sister
[1:17:16] Jerry knows these folks we've sat in
[1:17:18] their house many times
[1:17:21] the river cruise in Europe
[1:17:24] all these different things that they
[1:17:26] wanted to do
[1:17:29] they put it so far out in the future
[1:17:32] that by the time that they finally
[1:17:34] stopped you might say to enjoy life.
[1:17:38] All they did is drive by our house on
[1:17:40] the way to the doctor.
[1:17:43] Their retirement, their old age was
[1:17:45] nothing but doctor visits. No river crew
[1:17:47] cruise in Europe. No visiting all these
[1:17:50] different places. You see, my brother
[1:17:53] and sister, this is a two-way street.
[1:17:56] But we can't live today saying, you know
[1:17:58] what, God's going to move in my life
[1:18:01] down here.
[1:18:03] you know, we're going to just keep doing
[1:18:05] what we're doing and God will move. God
[1:18:07] will take care of this down here. I did
[1:18:09] that as a teenager. I I've shared it
[1:18:11] with you. I thought when I get when I
[1:18:14] get married, you know, praise God, I'm
[1:18:15] going to be real serious about serving
[1:18:16] God. I got married. I when I have
[1:18:18] children, I want to raise them right.
[1:18:20] I'll get serious about serving God when
[1:18:22] I have ch when this happens. I'll get
[1:18:23] serious about serving God. When this
[1:18:25] happens, I'll get serious about serving
[1:18:27] God. And I'll tell you, there's always
[1:18:28] an excuse of why we can't do what we
[1:18:31] plan to do. Amen. And so it's there,
[1:18:34] we'll see the flip side of it that
[1:18:36] people are like, you know, I'm going to
[1:18:38] just do this and I'm going to do this
[1:18:39] while I'm young and I I'm not going to
[1:18:41] care about nothing and I'm going to do
[1:18:42] this. My brother and sister, God's got a
[1:18:44] balance in our lives. That's why he
[1:18:46] said, "Seek you first." Amen. First
[1:18:48] might be six years old. First might be
[1:18:51] 10 years old. It might be 12, 15, uh,
[1:18:54] some cases might be 20. Amen. We got a
[1:18:57] lady that's been visiting us. Had a
[1:19:00] lovely conversation this last Sunday
[1:19:01] with her. It might be 60
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; but seek you first
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; and God comes and says, "You know what?
[1:19:10] I've got something for this season of
[1:19:12] your life." Amen. Some just look for
[1:19:16] today. And some look for eternity. I
[1:19:20] actually had a little different title I
[1:19:22] was going to put to this, my brother and
[1:19:23] sister, but uh I'll save that for uh
[1:19:26] maybe another day. But you see, if we're
[1:19:29] living for just the day and we don't
[1:19:32] look beyond that right there, then when
[1:19:35] we take our last breath, this is what
[1:19:37] we've got. So, I hope it's good.
[1:19:40] I hope it's good. I hope you've reached
[1:19:42] all the notoriety, all the fame, all the
[1:19:44] uh wealth, all the whatever you want cuz
[1:19:46] that's just it's going to end right
[1:19:48] there. But when you look for eternity,
[1:19:51] you actually get to enjoy this life
[1:19:54] because you get sealed against the
[1:19:57] spirits of this age. You're no longer
[1:20:00] tossed around. Amen. Isn't it funny how
[1:20:04] out on the Sea of Galilee, Jesus is
[1:20:06] sleeping in the boat. And this is a type
[1:20:10] that we don't want to overspiritualize
[1:20:11] because we'll think that we could have
[1:20:13] been the substitute for Jesus. But what
[1:20:16] he was showing them when he woke up and
[1:20:19] they're in mortal fear, their boat is
[1:20:21] swamping and they are in mortal fear
[1:20:23] that they're going to die. And uh when
[1:20:25] Jesus looks out and says, "Peace, be
[1:20:27] still."
[1:20:30] You see, they had already been given
[1:20:31] enough word that they could have taken
[1:20:34] that position.
[1:20:36] Let me put it this way. I'm talking to
[1:20:38] Paul tonight.
[1:20:40] When it gets all stormy and your anxiety
[1:20:43] rises, it's time for us to rise up and
[1:20:45] say, "Our Lord Jesus already declared
[1:20:47] it."
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Be still.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Time for us to take a hold and
[1:20:54] possess what God has already given to
[1:20:57] us. He already broke the ground. We
[1:21:00] don't need to break it. We need to just
[1:21:02] say, "Hey, you know what? I'm in Christ.
[1:21:04] Christ is in me. He's the word and I am
[1:21:08] in him. So I am the word. Peace be
[1:21:12] still.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Satan, I bind you in the name of Jesus
[1:21:18] Christ. Not in the name of our church.
[1:21:20] Not in the name of brother Brandham. Not
[1:21:22] in the name of this. We're Christians.
[1:21:24] That means we're followers of Christ.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people take it way too far to
[1:21:29] the right or left, whatever you want to
[1:21:30] call it. And my brother and sister, God
[1:21:32] wants you and I to have a balance. Amen.
[1:21:35] And that's part of having spiritual
[1:21:37] insight to realize that we're just as
[1:21:40] spiritual as anyone else with balance.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be radicalized.
[1:21:46] That's
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to be liberal.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did do you understand what I'm
[1:21:52] saying?
[1:21:55] So in watchmen what of the night
[1:22:00] uh brother Brandham says here you know
[1:22:02] it's never popular to tell the truth
[1:22:04] amongst people who want to live for this
[1:22:07] present day. They don't want to believe
[1:22:10] the truth but the Bible said ye you
[1:22:13] shall know the truth. Amen. Who can say
[1:22:16] amen to that?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not speaking some random
[1:22:20] thing out there. The scripture is
[1:22:22] telling us you're going to know the
[1:22:24] truth.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; And I believe the word. Amen. So I
[1:22:28] believe that there's something that God
[1:22:30] has already allotted to you and I the
[1:22:33] ability to believe the word and live
[1:22:36] that word to be a participant of that
[1:22:38] word. You shall know the truth. Oh, I'm
[1:22:41] so glad of that. You shall know the
[1:22:44] truth and the truth shall make you free.
[1:22:47] So now I'm going to say something that
[1:22:49] might come back to haunt me. Forgive me
[1:22:51] for saying this, but if we really have
[1:22:54] truth,
[1:22:56] we should not be bound.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; But nope. Nope. Don't negate it. Don't
[1:23:07] do away with it. The truth shall set you
[1:23:11] free.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not looking for another
[1:23:14] hundred years and then the truth's going
[1:23:16] to be free.
[1:23:18] No, we're looking at the truth right
[1:23:20] now. And the word says shall set us
[1:23:23] free.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think it's time for us to
[1:23:26] possess the position that God has given
[1:23:28] us and just rebuke those binding spirits
[1:23:31] that want to torment us at night,
[1:23:33] torment us in the daytime, want to
[1:23:36] hinder our con. You know, this is one of
[1:23:38] the things about condemnation. Amen.
[1:23:41] Condemnation never stopped anyone from
[1:23:44] ever serving God, believe it or not. But
[1:23:46] what it did is it hindered you from
[1:23:48] applying the word. So then you don't
[1:23:51] have liberty or confidence in the word.
[1:23:53] So if you don't have liberty or
[1:23:55] confidence in the word, you're more than
[1:23:57] likely not going to apply it.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; And if you don't apply it, you don't get
[1:24:06] any result.
[1:24:10] Now you can be a prisoner or you can be
[1:24:12] a truth rejecting prisoner or you can
[1:24:15] know the truth and be free.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we know the truth?
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; I believe with all my heart we know the
[1:24:22] truth. Amen. There's a lot of voices out
[1:24:24] there want to say it's all false my
[1:24:26] brother and sister but they don't have
[1:24:27] such a stellar track record their own
[1:24:29] self. So what have they got? What reason
[1:24:32] have they got to cause us to want to
[1:24:34] follow their example? This is the thing
[1:24:36] I I think so interesting is they're very
[1:24:39] vocal to tell you this is wrong, this is
[1:24:41] wrong, this is wrong. And they
[1:24:43] themselves don't have any more stellar
[1:24:44] track record.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; H reminds me of Dayan and Kora.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Moses, you're wrong. We're just as
[1:24:55] spiritual as you are.
[1:24:58] But God didn't think so.
[1:25:00] Amen. They thought so. They had a whole
[1:25:02] group of people that thought so, but God
[1:25:05] didn't think so. Now, John 16:12 and 13
[1:25:08] says, "I have yet many things to say
[1:25:10] unto you, but you cannot bear them now.
[1:25:13] How be it, when he, the Spirit of truth,
[1:25:16] is come, he will guide you into Oh, let
[1:25:20] me stop first.
[1:25:22] Do we believe this scripture?"
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; How be it then, he, the Spirit of truth,
[1:25:29] is come. He will guide you into all
[1:25:31] truth. For he shall not speak of
[1:25:34] himself, but whatsoever he shall hear,
[1:25:36] that shall he speak. And he will show,
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; you, me,
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; You know the sheep, you the you,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; the sheep,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; will show you things to come. Talk about
[1:25:56] an insight. You get the Holy Ghost, God
[1:26:00] starts to bring peace and joy and all of
[1:26:02] these things into your life. And you
[1:26:04] come in there and we realize it's not my
[1:26:07] brother and sister, whoever preached it.
[1:26:09] It's not William Brandham, Brother
[1:26:11] Brandham. It's not there. It's the God
[1:26:14] himself has come down and what he's
[1:26:17] doing is pouring himself into you. And
[1:26:20] when he speaks, he's going to show you
[1:26:22] things to come. In other words, through
[1:26:25] the word, he's going to show you the
[1:26:27] manifestation of the rapture. And people
[1:26:30] say, "Oh, oh, we going to see the
[1:26:31] catching away." No, my brother and
[1:26:33] sister, the rapture is actually a body
[1:26:35] change and it's taking place right now.
[1:26:40] That's not something that's going to
[1:26:41] happen some cloudless morning on a day
[1:26:43] that we don't know when because this
[1:26:45] body's got to be changed from this uh
[1:26:48] body of flesh, this body of mortality.
[1:26:51] It's got to be changed to immortality.
[1:26:54] That's what's taking place right now.
[1:26:56] The word changing us to bring us to a
[1:26:59] place that the rapture can actually take
[1:27:02] place.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz the body is going to be changed by
[1:27:06] this word.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:10] Of course, some people don't even
[1:27:11] believe in a rapture anymore.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Nope. It should already come. If Brother
[1:27:16] Brandon was correct, he said the rapture
[1:27:18] is just right here. It's just it's got
[1:27:20] to take place just a few more days.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Just right here.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? I'm sorry. This
[1:27:29] simple boy just isn't so bright as the
[1:27:32] rest of these guys.
[1:27:35] Because if I live out all my days,
[1:27:37] whatever they are allotted, and I'm
[1:27:40] taking my last breath,
[1:27:43] I know that when I have taken that last
[1:27:45] breath,
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; I've got a body change.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to happen like the
[1:27:51] theologian said. Doesn't have to happen
[1:27:54] like Mr. PhD of religion said. It
[1:27:57] doesn't have to happen like anyone else
[1:27:59] said. Let it happen like God said.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there'll be many Hey, I mean
[1:28:06] there's things that are happening in the
[1:28:08] world today we don't understand. A
[1:28:10] brother back east, some kind of home
[1:28:11] invasion, brother gets shot, dies. Now
[1:28:15] my brother and sister, you say, "What?
[1:28:16] How can this happen? Oh, let me remind
[1:28:19] you. Just here recently back east, a
[1:28:22] brother driving down the road gets in an
[1:28:24] automobile accident and dies. A young
[1:28:27] man with a family. How does this happen?
[1:28:31] Because God wrote the story, not you and
[1:28:34] I.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. What we have is to be ready.
[1:28:40] There's the key for us. Be ready. Amen.
[1:28:44] There is the insight. God has given it
[1:28:47] doesn't matter about tomorrow because we
[1:28:51] know who holds tomorrow.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So truth knows no age boundary.
[1:28:58] Amen. We'll look at this and um
[1:29:03] children, we've seen it. I won't express
[1:29:06] to here tonight, but we've seen young
[1:29:09] people and even parents thought they're
[1:29:12] too young to be baptized. That child
[1:29:14] wants to be baptized. Parents are even
[1:29:16] like we're not sure they understand. But
[1:29:18] the child understood because you see
[1:29:20] truth knows no age boundary. Amen. You
[1:29:23] can be very young and know truth. Amen.
[1:29:26] And you can be very old and know truth.
[1:29:28] Amen. Remember beyond the curtain of
[1:29:30] time there. You know what was it? 90 90
[1:29:33] something years old. Amen. Come to the
[1:29:36] Lord. Amen. You know, you'd think when
[1:29:38] somebody gets that old that that it's
[1:29:41] they've missed it. But you see, God
[1:29:43] knows.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What is revelation?
[1:29:50] You know, we got all kinds of ideas,
[1:29:52] people. I've heard it preached so many
[1:29:53] different ways, and I wouldn't say any
[1:29:55] one of them is wrong. Let me just add
[1:29:57] another subnote. Revelation is Christ
[1:30:00] expressing his love to you.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; In other words, when he starts to bear
[1:30:05] his secrets to you,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; that's right. He's showing you I love
[1:30:10] you
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; and I want you to see me for who I am.
[1:30:15] Not a not a God that's in the vapor,
[1:30:18] but I want you to see me for who I am.
[1:30:22] Amen.
[1:30:24] You know the word
[1:30:27] the word produces an experience that
[1:30:29] matches the word.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; That's what I was talking about earlier.
[1:30:34] I just brought this down to this point,
[1:30:36] my brother and sister. When people say,
[1:30:38] "We have truth. I'm right. You're
[1:30:40] wrong." But what they produce
[1:30:44] doesn't match the word, I don't care how
[1:30:47] much they say your faults.
[1:30:52] Their life testifies louder than their
[1:30:55] own words. And so they fit well when
[1:31:00] they're in that group that's anointed
[1:31:03] just like them.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:09] I remember years ago.
[1:31:13] I don't couldn't tell you how many
[1:31:15] years,
[1:31:16] but Oakland, the Oakland Raiders
[1:31:21] had just the Super Bowl had been in
[1:31:23] Oakland and the Raiders lost.
[1:31:27] And literally when I got off the freeway
[1:31:29] in the semi to deliver a load of roofing
[1:31:31] into this company, I literally drove
[1:31:34] down the street that borders their
[1:31:36] stadium. I pulled in there, went into
[1:31:40] the shipping department. The guys said,
[1:31:42] "Well, we take our lunch at a different
[1:31:43] time here, so the guys are doing a
[1:31:45] lunch. Go out. They're nice bunch of
[1:31:47] guys. They look rough, but they're nice
[1:31:50] bunch of guys. Just don't talk about
[1:31:54] football.
[1:31:57] And I got to looking around as I'm
[1:31:59] waiting to get unloaded and I see burnt
[1:32:01] up cars in the parking lot across the
[1:32:03] street and I'm like, I understand what
[1:32:06] he's talking about.
[1:32:09] But I went out to their, you know, I
[1:32:12] don't know, fast food truck that was
[1:32:15] there and what are they talking about?
[1:32:18] Football.
[1:32:21] only they're talking about everything
[1:32:24] that the referee and everything else did
[1:32:27] wrong that we should have won. We were
[1:32:29] right. We were right. We were right.
[1:32:32] They were wrong. We're the winners.
[1:32:34] They're that. Now, you say, "What? What
[1:32:36] are you getting at, brother Paul?" When
[1:32:38] spirits anoint people,
[1:32:41] the facts don't matter.
[1:32:45] They're right. The scripture says,
[1:32:48] "Every man is right in his own eyes."
[1:32:52] Let's be right in his eyes.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not judge it by what we
[1:32:57] felt, thought emotionally, etc. Let's
[1:33:01] judge it by the word, what he said was
[1:33:04] right. Amen. One last little, if you
[1:33:07] don't mind, I'm I'm took a little longer
[1:33:09] than I thought I would here.
[1:33:12] um in the service, what shall I do with
[1:33:15] this Jesus called Christ? Now, if you
[1:33:18] was to go look this up, you'll see that
[1:33:20] just before that, Brother Brown's
[1:33:22] talking about a pilot checking out an
[1:33:24] airplane to make sure everything is
[1:33:26] right. Uh because you don't want it to
[1:33:28] be shuttering and whatever, and lose
[1:33:30] power, cough, and crash. So, keep that
[1:33:33] in mind. But look how he brings that
[1:33:35] analogy of a plane and a pilot checking
[1:33:38] the plane out. Now, look what he says
[1:33:39] here. how the church ought to be
[1:33:42] checking it again and again and again.
[1:33:45] And I don't think I'd be overemphasizing
[1:33:47] to just keep right on saying and again
[1:33:50] and again and again and again. We're
[1:33:54] waiting for his coming. We're waking.
[1:33:56] We're waiting for the takeoff. We better
[1:33:59] check it with the word, not what
[1:34:01] somebody said.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Check it with the word, not what
[1:34:06] somebody said. Be sure you know. Now
[1:34:09] look how this is. You know, sometimes we
[1:34:11] just almost act like we have a
[1:34:13] collective revelation, but my brother
[1:34:14] and sister, this needs to be your
[1:34:16] revelation. Amen. You need be sure you
[1:34:19] know yourself. See, it's spaced in there
[1:34:22] with those two commas, which is a period
[1:34:24] of time, which is a pause that brings
[1:34:27] you there. Check it yourself.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. as a personal experience
[1:34:34] with Christ. Check it again and again
[1:34:39] and again. See, this is the real key, my
[1:34:42] brother and sister, for us to have
[1:34:44] spiritual insight is when we're back in
[1:34:46] the word again.
[1:34:49] Not, hey, I heard a tape last month. I
[1:34:53] read my Bible, but get back again. Cuz
[1:34:57] the last thing we want to do is get off
[1:35:00] the ground and sputter
[1:35:04] and crash.
[1:35:06] My Lord help us. Sister Vika, I think
[1:35:10] you need to help me stop.
[1:35:12] Amen.
[1:35:15] See, the gift of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:35:17] relationship between you and Jesus
[1:35:18] Christ.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh true revelation is a gift
[1:35:24] from God.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why the prophet
[1:35:27] of God said, "Pray for revelation."
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Pray for revelation. Man can't give it
[1:35:32] to you and man can't take it away.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that beautiful?
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to go ahead and read
[1:35:38] it, but uh second Peter uh 18-12 if you
[1:35:43] want to just take that. It is very
[1:35:45] familiar scripture. Uh for if these
[1:35:48] things be in you and abound, they make
[1:35:50] you that she'll neither be barren nor
[1:35:51] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:35:54] Jesus Christ. And that's what we want to
[1:35:56] be. We want to bear fruit. And it won't
[1:35:59] be the fruit that we say we're going to
[1:36:01] bear. It's going to be the fruit that
[1:36:03] the word produces. Amen. Let's just
[1:36:06] stand, sing a couple songs here. Amen.
[1:36:12] Hallelujah.
[1:36:17] 893, brother.
[1:36:23] Amen. Brother Alex, why don't you just
[1:36:26] come and lead us in a song or two? This
[1:36:28] just really struck me. Uh we're seeing
[1:36:33] that this day that we're living in right
[1:36:34] now, the line has been drawn.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a matter if it's going to
[1:36:40] be drawn someday. The line is already
[1:36:43] drawn and we either stand with the word.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Or we're against the word. There's no we
[1:36:50] agree mostly or partially as it would
[1:36:54] be, but we either stand for the word
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; or we're opposed to the word. Amen.
[1:37:04] Father, I see that you are drawing
[1:37:10] a line in the sand. And I want to be
[1:37:15] standing on your side,
[1:37:20] holding
[1:37:22] your hand. So let your kingom
[1:37:27] come.
[1:37:29] Let it live in me. This is my prayer.
[1:37:38] This is my plea.
[1:37:42] Oh, Father, I see that you're drawing
[1:37:49] a line in the sand. And I want to be
[1:37:54] standing on your side.
[1:37:58] holding
[1:38:00] your hand. So let your kingom
[1:38:05] come.
[1:38:07] Let it live in me. This is my prayer.
[1:38:16] This is my plea.
[1:38:21] Let the worshippers
[1:38:24] arise.
[1:38:30] Let the sons and the daughters see.
[1:38:40] I'm surrendering
[1:38:42] my all.
[1:38:49] I surrender to the king.
[1:38:59] Oh father, I hear it growing louder.
[1:39:05] The song of your redee
[1:39:09] as the saints of every nation
[1:39:14] are awakening
[1:39:16] to sing. From our hearts there comes an
[1:39:22] anthem.
[1:39:23] Oh, hear the heavens ring. This is our
[1:39:28] song,
[1:39:31] a song to our king.
[1:39:37] Let the worshippers
[1:39:39] arise
[1:39:46] and let the sons and the daughters see.
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:55] I'm surrendering
[1:39:57] my own.
[1:40:04] I surrender to
[1:40:07] the king.
[1:40:12] Amen.
[1:40:15] Let's go to the key of D in number 1039.
[1:40:20] I think we know the song.
[1:40:24] Oh, you shall love the Lord with all
[1:40:29] your heart.
[1:40:35] You shall love the Lord with all your
[1:40:40] soul.
[1:40:45] You shall love the Lord with all your
[1:40:50] mind,

[1:41:03] Oh Lord, I love
[1:41:07] you.

[1:41:14] all my soul, with all my mind.
[1:41:22] Oh, I shall love the Lord with all my
[1:41:27] heart.

[1:41:42] I shall love the Lord with all my mind,
[1:41:49] with all my heart, with all my soul,
[1:41:54] with all my mind.
[1:41:59] Oh Lord, I love
[1:42:03] you
[1:42:05] for all the things you are. Lord, I love
[1:42:13] you
[1:42:15] for all the things you do.
[1:42:19] Lord, I love
[1:42:23] you.
[1:42:25] Help me love you more with all my heart,
[1:42:31] with all my soul, with all my mind.
[1:42:39] Amen.
