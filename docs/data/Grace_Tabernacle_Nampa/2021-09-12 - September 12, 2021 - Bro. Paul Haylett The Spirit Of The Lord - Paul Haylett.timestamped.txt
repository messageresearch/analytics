[31:17] as we get ready to turn this earth to
[31:18] our pasture let's sing that little song
[31:20] number three
[31:21] 64.
[31:24] undefiled
[31:25] [Music]
[31:26] real pure lives
[31:29] it's a
[31:31] world of compromise
[31:34] [Music]
[31:46] [Music]
[31:55] no matter what
[32:03] [Applause]
[32:14] [Music]
[32:26] and when we walk down the street
[32:32] [Music]
[32:43] [Music]
[33:02] [Music]
[33:11] [Music]
[33:17] oh
[33:21] [Music]
[33:32] it
[33:34] [Music]
[33:47] hallelujah good to be here today
[33:50] amen i i'm amazed at just how
[33:54] precise sometimes the lord works brother
[33:57] jason and i
[33:58] didn't even have any conversation
[34:00] concerning the service today
[34:02] uh but that song right there i think
[34:04] would be the perfect one
[34:06] uh to uh
[34:08] to go with our thought today
[34:11] amen
[34:12] so i don't embarrass nobody but um
[34:16] you know it's interesting in our minds
[34:18] we often think of ourselves as still
[34:20] being young right we look back when we
[34:22] say
[34:24] and
[34:25] i just want to say to our sister to
[34:27] betha
[34:30] we knew her as a child and we weren't
[34:33] much more than a child
[34:35] and uh the years passed so quickly and
[34:38] we think of ourselves as young until we
[34:40] look around and we have grandchildren
[34:42] and gray hair
[34:44] and uh so
[34:46] god bless you to bethenny and your
[34:48] friend i believe it's david yes we
[34:51] welcome you today and pray the lord will
[34:53] just bless you and your time here with
[34:55] us
[34:56] i just want to take a moment just to
[34:58] share a little something with you uh
[35:01] certainly we never share these things as
[35:03] a boast of what any of us have ever done
[35:06] right because if there's any good thing
[35:08] in us it's jesus christ
[35:11] amen we've we can never stand on our own
[35:14] merits and say i've done this i've done
[35:16] that but i just wanted to share with you
[35:19] for the first time
[35:21] and forgive me if my memory is not quite
[35:23] correct there'd be here those here that
[35:25] probably could help correct that but i
[35:27] think it's been something in the region
[35:28] of 12 years
[35:30] since they have had a major get-together
[35:33] of
[35:34] the brethren and families in the ukraine
[35:37] for special meetings
[35:39] and
[35:40] so
[35:41] this time right now it's off
[35:45] eight o'clock at night
[35:47] i think um
[35:49] so they're that much ahead of us
[35:51] um would be the closing uh of the
[35:54] ending
[35:55] of these meetings that they have had
[35:58] brother barry and brother
[36:00] uh brother barry coffey and brother
[36:01] burly williams that went over there and
[36:03] ministered and brother barry has
[36:05] had you know many friendships through
[36:07] the years uh over there and and
[36:09] influence and uh
[36:13] my you know it's always in times like
[36:15] this you forget but uh
[36:17] different different places um that they
[36:19] used to have special meetings there and
[36:21] you know of course the change of
[36:23] countries and boundaries and political
[36:26] things change all of that and
[36:28] so they've now had these meetings uh
[36:31] i think oh it was alusco they used to
[36:33] have meetings ever every year very large
[36:36] meetings and and different places like
[36:39] that and then because of the rise
[36:42] of uh
[36:44] communism and their control over these
[36:46] countries things change
[36:48] and so this year they've had um had
[36:50] these special meetings there and uh
[36:54] sister yulia's family
[36:56] has a great burden her
[36:58] brother pavel
[37:00] which is very dear to us we i think can
[37:03] uniformly say that we love brother pavel
[37:06] went and has worked as an interpreter
[37:08] there
[37:09] and uh we have worked with sister yuli's
[37:12] dad i always call him brother sergey
[37:14] senior to separate them in my mind i
[37:16] don't know if there's a senior to the
[37:18] senior or not but
[37:20] anyway that's how i separate brother
[37:21] sergey our brother sergey and
[37:24] his father-in-law so brother sergey
[37:26] senior uh had approached us and we have
[37:29] worked with him
[37:30] and i i just want to uh uh just let you
[37:34] know
[37:35] that uh you have sent
[37:38] somewhere in the region of 50 plus
[37:40] people to that camp
[37:43] those who had
[37:45] no financial ability
[37:47] to go
[37:49] and you think oh my brother paul that
[37:51] must be but you see there's a difference
[37:52] in the culture for around 45 to 55
[37:56] dollars they could catch the train
[37:59] they could have a bed to sleep in and
[38:01] meals to eat and attend the service and
[38:04] if you can you know change a family
[38:06] change a young person's life for 55
[38:09] dollars
[38:10] that is such a small investment
[38:13] and uh so i just felt instead of keeping
[38:16] it you know something behind the scenes
[38:18] there is um in the workings of the
[38:21] church i'll say there's many things that
[38:22] you have done that you probably will
[38:24] never know you did
[38:26] uh but that's just in the
[38:28] behind the scenes of the working of the
[38:30] church but i just thought it might be a
[38:31] nice blessing for you to know
[38:34] that you have sent parents and teenagers
[38:37] and whatnot to this meetings
[38:40] for such in my mind an economical value
[38:43] for them to be able to get on a train
[38:46] and whatever town they are brother
[38:47] sergey shared with me that many of these
[38:50] financially would never be able to do
[38:52] that
[38:53] even though some of them expressed to
[38:55] him our teenagers need it
[38:59] really stirred my heart you know when
[39:00] you think okay
[39:02] here's a family that they know their
[39:04] children need it they know that they
[39:06] need it
[39:07] and it seemingly is beyond their grasp
[39:11] but you see god does not put anything
[39:15] out there in the heart of his believers
[39:17] but what he provides a way to satisfy
[39:20] that right a deep calling to the deep
[39:22] and so i just want to say thank you it
[39:25] is your contributions it is your support
[39:27] of this church that makes that possible
[39:30] and i just pray
[39:31] as we stand before the lord one day
[39:33] because the scripture says that we will
[39:36] that
[39:37] when we receive our crown of reward
[39:40] that may god be gracious to us and let
[39:43] us wrap our arms around
[39:45] uh someone that you had an impact in
[39:48] their life someone you may never meet
[39:50] will more than likely in fact 99 point
[39:53] and let's run the nines as far as you
[39:55] can run them
[39:56] we'll never meet them on this earth
[39:59] but you will have had
[40:01] an eternal impact on their lives
[40:05] by something and i say this
[40:08] as simple
[40:09] as a few dollars
[40:11] so
[40:12] god bless you and thank you for your
[40:14] faithful support here church
[40:16] because without that faithful support
[40:18] one we wouldn't have a building we
[40:20] wouldn't have nothing
[40:22] it takes people that's why and i'm going
[40:24] to throw this on the tail and that's why
[40:26] i don't like people to say this is
[40:27] brother paul's church
[40:29] because if brother paul was standing
[40:30] here this morning looking at an empty
[40:33] building one there would be no building
[40:36] and there would be no need to call it
[40:38] grace tabernacle because it would just
[40:40] be
[40:41] one person
[40:43] but you as body of faithful
[40:46] god-loving
[40:47] faithful
[40:49] faith-filled
[40:50] people
[40:52] make this what it is today
[40:54] so
[40:55] amen let's just stand as we go to the
[40:57] word today
[41:01] amen i just felt led to share that
[41:05] you know and and i guess i'll throw this
[41:07] out make this a missionary report
[41:09] uh
[41:10] you
[41:11] uh have a continued support
[41:14] of the saints and here again it's not a
[41:17] large number but you have a continued
[41:19] support of the believers in venezuela
[41:22] that are without food without medicine
[41:25] without that
[41:27] and
[41:28] that work is is uh supported through
[41:31] believers international brother george
[41:34] and he has connections there and a
[41:36] continual steady you don't want to draw
[41:38] the attention of of anyone so things are
[41:41] just done on a very low key
[41:45] process
[41:46] and uh in that though
[41:49] imagine
[41:50] that you
[41:52] would break down in tears
[41:54] because you've seen the first tube of
[41:56] toothpaste
[41:58] that you have seen for a year
[42:02] see it's not always just about the
[42:03] gospel
[42:04] right these are believers these are
[42:06] christians
[42:08] and they are dire
[42:10] believers imagine saints now i'm not
[42:12] going to play on your sympathy but
[42:13] imagine
[42:14] that our lives would change so radical
[42:16] and it's possible it will
[42:18] that we would entertain eating from a
[42:20] garbage can
[42:23] and we have it within our ability to
[42:26] help in a token amount support these
[42:29] people
[42:30] people who are living virtually on the
[42:34] street because the gangs and different
[42:37] things have taken over their whole
[42:39] neighborhoods and specifically told
[42:41] you're not welcome in this neighborhood
[42:43] any longer when it was their
[42:45] neighborhood it's their home
[42:47] and now they're homeless
[42:48] and now they're fleeing they walk
[42:50] hundreds of kilometers through the
[42:53] forest
[42:54] to get to the borders of colombia and
[42:57] these neighboring countries only to be
[42:58] told go back
[43:01] and so now they live in the forest
[43:04] sounds fun if you're 12.
[43:08] so just keep them in prayer
[43:10] and
[43:11] i just want you to once again that in a
[43:14] small fashion
[43:15] we are continuing to support those
[43:17] believers also
[43:19] so
[43:20] amen well let's turn our bibles today i
[43:23] just want you to know that i feel very
[43:25] happy in my heart this morning
[43:28] amen brother david i would just share
[43:30] with you first john the fourth chapter
[43:32] verses one through six brother david i
[43:35] will share with you i changed the title
[43:37] of this sermon about ten times this
[43:39] morning alone
[43:42] as i'm studying something just go this
[43:44] direction and it seemed like i'm back
[43:46] this direction and back to this
[43:48] direction
[43:50] and then i think this will make you all
[43:52] happy except for we'll see how long i
[43:54] actually take but i just then chopped
[43:57] everything in half
[43:58] and i probably still have too much
[44:01] amen
[44:04] first john the fourth chapter first
[44:05] verse amen beloved believe not every
[44:08] spirit
[44:10] see this is what christians are being
[44:11] commanded now to do
[44:13] believe not every spirit but try the
[44:16] spirits
[44:17] whether they are of god so we have a
[44:20] sure word of prophecy as the scripture
[44:22] says that has opened to us we are not
[44:25] sitting here now in ignorance to know
[44:28] what we should try the spirits with
[44:32] because it has been placed back to us
[44:35] over and over again
[44:37] the word
[44:38] take it back to the word
[44:41] test it with the word
[44:43] and some people say you know brother
[44:45] paul i've had this spoke to me but paul
[44:48] you just say that so much it's become
[44:49] redundant well let me just tell you i
[44:52] will be redundant till the coming of the
[44:54] lord
[44:55] amen because i want you just i i won't
[44:58] do this i didn't include the quote but
[45:00] the prophet of god saying that here we
[45:02] are speaking of ministers
[45:05] what we are going to do is we are going
[45:08] to share the truth of the gospel
[45:11] to the coming of the lord because we
[45:14] love the people enough
[45:18] not just a meal ticket not just an
[45:21] office to be fulfilled but you love the
[45:23] people enough
[45:25] to tell them the truth
[45:27] and so it's there in that knowing that
[45:29] the people will then come into the
[45:32] presence of god these are not exact
[45:33] words but then people will come into the
[45:36] presence of god
[45:38] rejoicing
[45:40] because they would be found as the
[45:43] apostle paul said
[45:44] walking in the truth
[45:48] i tell you what
[45:49] sometimes i think we ought to just stop
[45:51] and lift our hands and say thank you
[45:53] lord
[45:54] that we can walk in the truth we that we
[45:57] don't have to be beaten into the truth
[45:59] condemned into the truth
[46:02] we can just simply by revelation be
[46:04] found walking in the truth
[46:08] because many false prophets are gone out
[46:10] into the world
[46:12] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[46:15] spirit that confesses that jesus christ
[46:18] is come in the flesh is of god
[46:20] now my brother and sister this could be
[46:23] something that people would make an
[46:24] argument and i i i'm i need to just read
[46:26] the scripture and i'll preach to you
[46:28] amen confesses that jesus christ has
[46:31] come in the flesh is of god and every
[46:33] spirit that confesses not that jesus
[46:35] christ has come in the flesh is not of
[46:37] god and this is that spirit of
[46:39] antichrist whereof ye have heard that it
[46:42] should come and even now already is in
[46:45] the world ye are of god little children
[46:49] and over have overcome them because
[46:52] greater is he that is in you can someone
[46:56] say amen today greater is he that is in
[47:00] you
[47:01] than he that is in the world and we'll
[47:03] we'll speak on that in a minute they are
[47:05] of the world therefore speak they of the
[47:07] world
[47:09] and the world heareth them
[47:11] we are of god
[47:13] and he that knoweth god heareth us
[47:15] he that is not of god heareth not us
[47:18] hereby we know the spirit of truth and
[47:21] the spirit of air amen heavenly father
[47:25] we just ask for your hand of mercy lord
[47:28] open the words that we would be anointed
[47:30] to speak today father let there be your
[47:32] words not our words and lord for every
[47:35] need father
[47:37] lord just those in our midst today and
[47:39] those that are not we just ask you
[47:42] father come and touch each heart and the
[47:44] heart's desire
[47:45] lord that you would just come and heal
[47:48] us lord
[47:49] strengthen us give us a courage bold to
[47:52] stand in the world that we live in today
[47:55] we ask this in the precious name of
[47:57] jesus christ and the congregation said
[48:00] amen
[48:01] you may be seated saints amen
[48:04] now
[48:08] i want to
[48:09] just go back into this for just a moment
[48:13] and just to touch on this because it's
[48:15] not really my subject it is you might
[48:18] say the prelude to to our thought today
[48:22] so as we'll look at this my brother and
[48:24] sister we see
[48:27] that as we look at this
[48:29] it says um
[48:32] year of god little children and have
[48:34] overcome them because greater is he that
[48:37] is in you than he that is in the world
[48:40] and i just feel led to jump a little
[48:42] ways ahead in my my
[48:44] sermon here and i want you to if just if
[48:47] you can follow me focus here please
[48:50] amen
[48:51] something uh that we kind of touched on
[48:54] just a little bit here and there touched
[48:56] on a wednesday night a little bit now
[48:58] the word magnify amen i love that old
[49:01] song let magnify the lord in me amen you
[49:05] know that's what we're looking to do my
[49:06] brother and sister not just to be
[49:08] christians in name only but we want to
[49:11] actually be the living walking talking
[49:13] magnification of jesus christ in the day
[49:16] that we live in now as it says here the
[49:19] word greater we come down here into the
[49:21] definition of magnify to make something
[49:25] greater
[49:27] so greater is he that is in you what is
[49:31] that jesus christ magnified
[49:34] in you not just a verbal thing but
[49:38] christ himself magnified in us is what
[49:41] makes us greater than the spirits of
[49:43] this world makes us greater than any
[49:45] circumstance that surrounds us now we
[49:47] can have a form of godliness and if we
[49:49] deny the power of god to change us my
[49:52] brother and sister we are allowing
[49:53] ourselves to be pickpocketed amen
[49:56] because the word has been given to us
[49:57] and if we let the devil just come and
[49:59] snatch that away from us you you just uh
[50:02] look don't do that i'll tell you as we
[50:05] have traveled over the world and been in
[50:07] these countries and in one particular
[50:09] time
[50:10] you know we were down in uh san
[50:12] bernardino which is a suburb of santiago
[50:14] and it's what you would call the bad
[50:16] side of town and uh we're walking along
[50:18] and and the the stores all had uh like
[50:21] like used to be downtown caldwell and
[50:24] whatever and all the entries to the
[50:26] stores were in an angle you know in
[50:27] their glass with the doors and i'm
[50:29] walking along and i noticed this same
[50:31] guy is just constantly about six steps
[50:34] behind me and uh it kind of dawned on me
[50:37] you know it's like hey this guy is up to
[50:39] no good because we stop he stops we
[50:41] start he starts and finally i just had
[50:44] enough of it you know i had a brother
[50:45] tell me later he says you're lucky he
[50:47] didn't stab your hide but you know i
[50:49] finally just stopped and turned around
[50:50] to him and told him you get out of here
[50:52] before you get hurt i obviously
[50:54] understood english but you look at that
[50:56] my brother and sister now what it is is
[50:58] this is just i say this because this is
[51:00] a way that the devil works he will
[51:02] follow you for years until he can steal
[51:05] your joy
[51:06] he will follow you for years till he can
[51:09] steal your testimony amen he can steal
[51:12] as it were revelation where we not
[51:14] revelation is us really seeing who we
[51:17] are right because the word doesn't
[51:18] change but what is the changing is the
[51:21] enlightenment as it were of christ in
[51:23] you and when we see who we are the
[51:26] devil's going to be quick and we'll have
[51:27] a little quote here in a bit to touch on
[51:29] this the devil will be quick to come in
[51:31] there and try and cut that off because
[51:33] he ever sees you take the final step he
[51:37] knows he's lost you
[51:40] aren't you glad today that we have been
[51:42] by god's grace taken the final step into
[51:45] the revelation of who we are in jesus
[51:47] christ amen a seventh seal my brother
[51:50] and sister is not a language it is a
[51:53] life-changing event to you and i it is
[51:56] not a something to check off in the
[51:58] bible but it is christ coming down in
[52:01] the fullness of revelation to realize
[52:04] that we are oh i had a terrible day
[52:07] yesterday well my brother and sister
[52:09] you're still redeemed
[52:10] good day bad day
[52:13] sunny day rainy day that has nothing to
[52:16] do with the price and the decision that
[52:18] god made to save you
[52:20] hallelujah and we live in such a world
[52:22] where the devil comes and we just feel
[52:24] so bummed because nothing is right
[52:28] we're chomping corn and my brother back
[52:30] to pit tractor into a big concrete block
[52:33] and
[52:34] caved in a rim and
[52:35] the first reports my brother and sister
[52:37] they come back to me
[52:39] sadly enough is people that work for me
[52:42] and they come back with this report
[52:44] it ruined the rim and it ruined the tire
[52:46] and i in my mind i'm sitting there
[52:48] thinking okay those tires are are 32 3
[52:51] 400 a piece and the rim is just as
[52:54] expensive and i felt myself kind of
[52:56] deflating just
[53:00] and god spoke to me and says
[53:02] is this who you are a rim and a tire
[53:07] no i'm much greater than a remnant
[53:09] attire
[53:10] i'm a son of god
[53:12] hallelujah so then finally we look at it
[53:15] and and uh the tire wasn't ruined it
[53:17] just had big scuff marks on the side of
[53:20] it and the rim well i give you know
[53:23] we're born with gifts and my brother
[53:25] definitely he could cut your car in half
[53:26] put it back together and it'd still
[53:28] drive and work just fine
[53:29] anyway beat that whole thing together
[53:31] and in the end of the day it cost us
[53:34] almost nothing to fix it
[53:36] but you see the devil come
[53:38] with his bucket of cold water
[53:40] and i just use that example saints just
[53:42] as it's kind of a sorry out there
[53:44] example but you see we can let these
[53:47] little things in our life put such a
[53:49] damper on our life when we are much
[53:52] greater
[53:54] than all of this because greater is he
[53:56] that is in you than he that is in the
[53:58] world so everything of this world amen
[54:02] christ in you magnified now i want to
[54:04] ask you this morning is he magnified
[54:06] hallelujah he is so real he's so alive
[54:09] he's so powerful and he's so loving and
[54:11] kind he is magnified to his people
[54:15] hallelujah
[54:16] amen now as we look at this i just want
[54:18] you as we move real quickly here he said
[54:21] you've overcome them because magnified
[54:24] i'm not trying to change the scripture i
[54:26] want you to catch this because magnified
[54:29] is he that is in you
[54:31] amen so we're not looking now we see the
[54:33] prophecy of our day uh says that uh i'm
[54:37] paraphrasing this but it says a prophecy
[54:40] our day that they'll walk around groping
[54:42] in darkness
[54:43] amen not of sound mind not of direction
[54:46] not firm in their beliefs then these all
[54:49] come out of the word and definitions but
[54:52] kind of put together in that fashion now
[54:54] look what's happening in the world we
[54:56] live in right now my brother and sister
[54:58] we see a government of what we always
[55:00] thought was the greatest nation on earth
[55:02] and we see a government now groping in
[55:04] darkness and i i'm going to sound
[55:06] counterintuitive to kind of how my
[55:09] political feelings are
[55:12] but actually i'm starting to come to
[55:14] feel sorry for them
[55:17] and you know why
[55:19] because prophecy said
[55:21] they would be groping in darkness
[55:24] so here are these men
[55:27] who are making and i will go this far
[55:29] making complete fools of themselves
[55:34] but prophecy has to be fulfilled
[55:38] there's no way to get around this the
[55:42] word of god will come to pass
[55:45] now what did the word say about you
[55:49] now if we're looking out here seeing
[55:51] that out there what's happening and
[55:52] saying and we can declare from a hook
[55:54] that must come to pass now when the word
[55:57] is speaking of you must it now not come
[56:00] to pass i'm telling you my brother and
[56:03] sister that the word is coming to pass
[56:05] and christ is being magnified and it
[56:08] says those who would say he come in the
[56:10] flesh and we can argue this point but
[56:13] remember the prophet said that the
[56:14] scripture has two full meanings and so
[56:16] we see that jesus christ come in the
[56:18] flesh
[56:19] and people around the whole world
[56:21] recognize that yes jesus christ come in
[56:24] the flesh but what about him in the
[56:26] flesh today
[56:28] what about him in the 21st century in a
[56:32] world of gross darkness come is he in
[56:35] the flesh or not the scripture says if
[56:37] you can't recognize him in the flesh
[56:40] then there's something wrong because god
[56:42] has a revelation and that revelation has
[56:45] been laid out now so clearly marked for
[56:47] us that god said i need a habitation i
[56:50] need a temple not made with hands oh
[56:52] that was jesus christ well jesus christ
[56:55] is as it were not on the earth today but
[56:57] you are and he is in you and he said
[57:00] i'll be with you even in you amen do you
[57:04] believe that i believe he's with me
[57:06] i believe he's with me saints but i'm
[57:08] going to take that to the next step as
[57:10] the word has taken the next step and
[57:12] declare he's in me
[57:16] hallelujah and it does not matter what
[57:17] the world thinks about it what theology
[57:20] and the message thinks about it this is
[57:22] the word of god
[57:25] hallelujah
[57:26] he's in me
[57:28] hallelujah
[57:30] and so
[57:32] i'm not anointed
[57:34] by the spirit of the antichrist to sit
[57:36] here and deny
[57:38] he's in me
[57:41] well that's just what the scripture said
[57:44] i'm going to defend the scripture
[57:47] if the scripture can't defend itself as
[57:49] it were
[57:50] what good am i going to do trying to
[57:52] defend it and i'll say the same thing
[57:54] about the message
[57:58] if the message as it were will not
[58:00] defend itself
[58:02] then what good would it do for me to
[58:04] spend hours days weeks years
[58:06] defending the message
[58:13] well
[58:15] praise the lord amen
[58:18] god didn't call you to defend it he
[58:20] called you to live it
[58:23] so let's quit all of our little fussing
[58:25] about who's right and who's wrong
[58:28] i just read a quote this morning brother
[58:29] brown said everyone paraphrased here
[58:31] again
[58:32] everyone who is trying to achieve the
[58:34] same goal that i have
[58:37] i will call brother
[58:40] amen that's hard
[58:42] i did a little repenting this morning
[58:44] saints because there's times that i've
[58:46] been real quick
[58:47] just to say well they're off in this
[58:49] thing and they're off on that thing
[58:51] we'll just close that door and close
[58:53] this door and
[58:54] if you're not careful pretty soon you
[58:55] find yourself in a room all alone
[59:04] you see sometimes we just have to
[59:06] let god be god
[59:09] and let him take control
[59:11] hallelujah
[59:13] amen now look
[59:15] as we we're looking here i want to go
[59:17] into acts 19.
[59:20] i need to put a little note on the
[59:21] pulpit paul keep moving keep moving
[59:27] and god brought special miracles by the
[59:29] hands of paul so that from his body were
[59:31] brought into the sick handkerchiefs or
[59:33] aprons and the diseases departed from
[59:36] them and the evil spirits went out of
[59:38] them now my brother and sister you will
[59:40] see that it's not a very far step from
[59:43] here until
[59:44] idolatry that's right not a very far
[59:47] step right
[59:49] you see these were given of god anointed
[59:52] by the spirit and brother branham even
[59:54] talks about this in the message how that
[59:57] oral roberts used to say okay now reach
[59:59] out and touch your radio or touch your
[1:00:01] television and brother brown talked
[1:00:03] about that point of contact you can find
[1:00:05] it under those words point of contact
[1:00:07] and sometimes we as humans god designed
[1:00:09] us he's the one who brought us back he
[1:00:11] knows that we need something to connect
[1:00:13] to and so it's there as it was with
[1:00:16] these believers that when these uh
[1:00:19] handkerchiefs or aprons were brought
[1:00:22] from the body of paul the believers were
[1:00:24] not moving into idolatry worshiping
[1:00:27] objects but they were there as a point
[1:00:30] of contact recognizing this is a holy
[1:00:33] man this is a man of god and he cared
[1:00:37] enough someone cared enough for me to
[1:00:39] bring a token as it were to stir my
[1:00:43] heart and you see the prophet also
[1:00:45] explains it that it's not someone else's
[1:00:47] faith it's not someone else's doing it's
[1:00:49] your faith so it's a little catalyst
[1:00:51] right we've been preaching on the key a
[1:00:53] little catalyst or a little key to
[1:00:55] unlock their faith and it was there that
[1:00:57] says diseases departed from and evil
[1:01:00] spirits went out of them amen that's no
[1:01:02] small thing saints
[1:01:04] that's no small thing then certain of
[1:01:06] the vagabond jews exorcist now right
[1:01:09] exorcist go look it up they were the
[1:01:11] ones that went around uh casting out or
[1:01:14] attempting to cast out evil spirits
[1:01:18] now my brother and sister obviously
[1:01:20] they're not always 100 successful
[1:01:22] obviously it's there there's a certain
[1:01:24] element of influence but these people
[1:01:26] existed people paid them them money they
[1:01:29] uh you know i made a living had a
[1:01:30] position in the community did it line up
[1:01:33] with the word not really
[1:01:38] come on
[1:01:39] oh no you'll find the pattern in the
[1:01:40] word but what they were doing didn't
[1:01:42] line up with the word
[1:01:44] see there's where we have to be really
[1:01:46] careful that we're not following a
[1:01:47] pattern of the word the gospel my
[1:01:50] brother and sister of jesus christ
[1:01:52] is the word
[1:01:54] with power
[1:01:58] and authority
[1:02:00] so we can just preach and preach and
[1:02:02] preach we can preach john 3 16 until
[1:02:04] we're just blue in the face and fall
[1:02:05] over
[1:02:06] and nobody will give their heart to the
[1:02:08] lord nobody will change right
[1:02:10] but when you have the power of god john
[1:02:12] 3 16 comes and strikes somebody's heart
[1:02:14] and says i could be saved
[1:02:16] my life could be changed i could be in
[1:02:18] love with jesus christ and then there's
[1:02:20] something happens amen
[1:02:22] so you look at this a certain of the
[1:02:24] vagabond jews exorcists took upon them
[1:02:26] to call over them which had evil spirits
[1:02:29] the name of the lord jesus saying we
[1:02:31] adjure you or
[1:02:33] that word in its deeper meaning means
[1:02:36] beg you
[1:02:38] see that's how far you can take the word
[1:02:39] a juror down
[1:02:41] it can be a command a request and
[1:02:44] ultimately at the end of its definition
[1:02:47] it can be a begging
[1:02:50] remember we preached on begging the
[1:02:52] other day
[1:02:53] to approach god as beggars
[1:02:57] no my brother and sister we don't come
[1:02:59] and like oh lord lord i'm just no good
[1:03:01] i'm no good you need to do something for
[1:03:02] me come and say lord according to the
[1:03:05] word i am giving you my heart and soul
[1:03:07] and i have repented and i'm asking you
[1:03:10] to wash my life and change me
[1:03:13] oh that don't sound humble enough my
[1:03:15] brother and sister the power of god will
[1:03:17] make you bold
[1:03:19] not bold in an arrogant fashion but bold
[1:03:21] to reach out and claim a promise
[1:03:26] does that make sense because it's not
[1:03:27] talking about a boldness as a individual
[1:03:30] or their personality it's a boldness to
[1:03:32] say i want to i want that i want that
[1:03:35] lord and i'm willing i'm willing lord to
[1:03:37] submit myself to yield myself to
[1:03:39] approach you father because i'm claiming
[1:03:42] that
[1:03:56] there were seven sons of one siva the
[1:03:59] jew and chief of the priest which did so
[1:04:02] and the evil spirit answered and said
[1:04:05] jesus i know
[1:04:10] and paul i know
[1:04:15] but who are you
[1:04:19] now i want to ask you the same question
[1:04:21] the spirits today know jesus
[1:04:24] they know the apostle paul yes sir who
[1:04:27] are you
[1:04:29] amen are we approaching god correctly
[1:04:32] amen because if we are approaching him
[1:04:34] incorrectly
[1:04:36] those spirits right there
[1:04:38] and the man whom the evil spirit was
[1:04:40] leaped on them
[1:04:42] and overcame them and prevailed against
[1:04:44] them
[1:04:45] so that they fled out of that house
[1:04:47] naked and wounded
[1:04:50] you know my brother and sister i hope i
[1:04:51] hope you follow me this morning
[1:04:53] you see their reputation
[1:04:56] as exorcists
[1:04:58] as
[1:05:00] people of authority is forever shattered
[1:05:04] forever shattered
[1:05:07] and all we can say is thank you lord
[1:05:09] right we don't want the fake we want the
[1:05:11] real
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:13] hallelujah
[1:05:14] you see now oh i hope you can catch this
[1:05:17] as it was a side thought you see what's
[1:05:19] happened my brother and sister that in
[1:05:21] the united states i use this country as
[1:05:22] an example in the united states we used
[1:05:25] to everything you bought was made in the
[1:05:26] united states right hardly anything come
[1:05:28] from anywhere else now the natural and
[1:05:30] the spiritual type so what did we do we
[1:05:32] started wanting something that cost us
[1:05:34] less we don't want to pay the price so
[1:05:37] we started going and it started and it
[1:05:39] moved from one country to another
[1:05:41] country another country and now believe
[1:05:43] it or not even china is too expensive
[1:05:46] for some of these countries and so now
[1:05:48] they're going into the countries that
[1:05:50] have no exposure when was the last time
[1:05:52] you heard about a sweat camp in malaysia
[1:05:55] or indonesia you see and that's the
[1:05:57] world and what it is type it back to the
[1:05:59] spiritual no one wants to pay the price
[1:06:01] for the life of christ
[1:06:04] so what do we do we go and we start
[1:06:06] settling for cheaper less less less less
[1:06:10] less less
[1:06:12] until it comes down to our name is on a
[1:06:13] book
[1:06:14] and we feel
[1:06:16] comfortable we're willing to trade the
[1:06:19] effort of writing our name in a
[1:06:21] membership book believing that that is
[1:06:23] sufficient price for eternal life
[1:06:27] so we see this spirit looks at these
[1:06:28] people and he's telling them quite
[1:06:30] boldly to their face i know jesus and i
[1:06:33] know paul but i don't have a clue who
[1:06:35] you are and because i don't have a clue
[1:06:37] who you are i know that you are not in a
[1:06:40] position of authority because i satan
[1:06:43] know everyone who has a position of
[1:06:45] authority
[1:06:47] did you know amen we can preach about
[1:06:48] this we get excited about this the lord
[1:06:51] knows my name he knows mine
[1:06:54] do you know the devil knows every son or
[1:06:56] daughter of god he's looking he's
[1:06:58] searching the earth and everyone that
[1:07:00] shows any sign of a desire to serve god
[1:07:03] he can recognize them and when he sees
[1:07:05] them growing spiritually he starts to
[1:07:08] then put that and watch them and start
[1:07:10] to categorize them and when he sees that
[1:07:13] they have tapped into the power and the
[1:07:15] authority of almighty god it is there
[1:07:18] that we recognize when he starts to be
[1:07:20] concerned he starts to note that your
[1:07:23] voice
[1:07:25] come on help me preach this morning
[1:07:27] your voice according to the word of god
[1:07:30] has authority in heaven
[1:07:33] amen you have been given authority to
[1:07:36] lose
[1:07:38] that's not a beggar
[1:07:40] you've been given authority to bind
[1:07:43] that's not coming from a beggar that's
[1:07:45] coming from someone who's been granted
[1:07:48] the ability to step into a position and
[1:07:51] claim those promises of god those things
[1:07:54] that are not as though they are if you
[1:07:56] have something today lacking in your
[1:07:57] life
[1:07:58] don't sit back as a beggar before you
[1:08:01] leave this building today and it's not
[1:08:02] about the building but just the timing
[1:08:04] don't leave the building today but what
[1:08:06] you have bowed your heart and your head
[1:08:08] to the lord and say lord let me put
[1:08:10] these things that are keeping me from
[1:08:12] acting on the word let me put them
[1:08:15] behind me forever
[1:08:17] hallelujah because it's not there that
[1:08:19] we should let the devil control the
[1:08:21] tempo of our life
[1:08:23] control the blessings upon our lives
[1:08:26] asking the devil permission
[1:08:28] no sir my brother and sister sons and
[1:08:30] daughters of god don't ask permission of
[1:08:31] the devil
[1:08:32] amen in fact we're called to tell the
[1:08:34] devil where he's going and what it's
[1:08:36] about hallelujah
[1:08:39] and so they ran out of the house
[1:08:42] wounded naked
[1:08:43] now look what happened see this is god's
[1:08:45] work you say oh man that's just terrible
[1:08:48] and we're certainly not glorying in that
[1:08:49] but i want you to know this was known to
[1:08:51] all jews and greeks also dwelling at
[1:08:53] ephesus and fear fell upon them all
[1:08:56] they suddenly realized this whole thing
[1:08:58] about spirits
[1:09:00] is not a game
[1:09:04] this man come out now we're going to
[1:09:06] make some assumptions if you'll forgive
[1:09:08] me
[1:09:10] not one man with a spirit on him was not
[1:09:13] a great big huge
[1:09:16] bodybuilder lift hundreds of pounds guy
[1:09:20] he was just a man
[1:09:23] but the spirit
[1:09:25] of the devil
[1:09:27] satan strong enough to anoint him
[1:09:30] to rip up seven men
[1:09:34] and then we'd like to just live a
[1:09:36] half-hearted kinda have whatever kind of
[1:09:39] do whatever and praise the lord i i i
[1:09:42] love the lord and i believe the message
[1:09:44] and no i'm sorry to tell you
[1:09:47] that devil don't care what you think you
[1:09:49] believe right
[1:09:51] he wants to know
[1:09:53] and if he looks and says i don't think
[1:09:56] no i don't know you
[1:09:58] i don't know you
[1:10:00] i tell you what what we want to do is
[1:10:02] have the devil tremble when we get out
[1:10:04] of bed in the morning
[1:10:05] amen
[1:10:07] and so there was a fear fell upon all
[1:10:08] the dwelling in ephesus
[1:10:10] in the name of the lord jesus
[1:10:13] was magnified
[1:10:15] people recognize this was a catalyst
[1:10:17] that god used for people to recognize
[1:10:20] that these ministers of the gospel that
[1:10:22] they had saw these things that they
[1:10:24] might have a thought oh that's a cult
[1:10:26] that is there that is this that is this
[1:10:28] then they started to see there's
[1:10:29] something here there's something
[1:10:31] happening that man had an evil spirit
[1:10:32] was delivered from him that young woman
[1:10:34] evil spirit delivered from here but over
[1:10:36] here we have the imposters
[1:10:39] and the spirits are saying i'm not
[1:10:40] afraid of you
[1:10:42] i'm not afraid of you i'll show you
[1:10:43] who's in authority
[1:10:45] amen
[1:10:46] and many that believe came and i like
[1:10:48] this right here because we especially
[1:10:50] americans we have a real problem
[1:10:53] confessing our faults
[1:10:56] oh wait maybe it's the same i don't know
[1:10:58] i don't want to be too
[1:10:59] too blunt on anyone but
[1:11:02] i have been to europe
[1:11:04] i've been to africa been to south
[1:11:06] america i've been to australia
[1:11:09] and we're all the same
[1:11:13] we have a hard time confessing our
[1:11:15] faults
[1:11:16] we have a hard time laying the rubber on
[1:11:19] the road
[1:11:20] you know the one i like
[1:11:22] i know probably most of you have done
[1:11:23] this so forgive me and i'm with you
[1:11:27] if sister carrie if
[1:11:31] if
[1:11:32] i've ever done anything to offend you
[1:11:35] that's right
[1:11:38] with their deeds
[1:11:41] i lied to them i lied to you i did this
[1:11:44] i'm sorry we've we've
[1:11:47] why because the power of the holy spirit
[1:11:50] didn't just hit the surface
[1:11:52] it went deep into the heart and
[1:11:54] something said lord i just gotta come
[1:11:56] clean
[1:11:57] this is my brother and sister a real
[1:12:00] true confession
[1:12:03] lord
[1:12:04] forgive me of everything
[1:12:08] and so there many of them which use
[1:12:10] curious arts brought their books
[1:12:12] together and burned them before all men
[1:12:14] and they counted the price of them and
[1:12:16] found it 50 000 pieces of silver
[1:12:23] sometimes serving god does cost you
[1:12:27] besides your life
[1:12:29] financially
[1:12:31] imagine you've got all your book of
[1:12:33] potions
[1:12:35] all your book of sayings
[1:12:37] all your book of ritual
[1:12:41] and you believed enough
[1:12:43] to throw it in a pile
[1:12:48] and burn it amen
[1:12:50] that's a real conversion amen
[1:12:55] well unless they were foolish enough by
[1:12:57] motion to go and turn around bottom all
[1:12:59] again and then they should just be
[1:13:00] punished by the cost
[1:13:05] but look what's happening
[1:13:08] so mightily grew the word of god amen
[1:13:11] and prevailed amen
[1:13:14] i'll tell you what i don't serve a god
[1:13:16] that has to retreat you never receive
[1:13:18] god sound or retreat my brother and
[1:13:20] sister
[1:13:21] hallelujah now look i want to just hurry
[1:13:23] up we want to look at the apostle paul
[1:13:25] for just a second and we see that he
[1:13:27] come through the correct line right he
[1:13:29] comes with the correct lineage and he
[1:13:31] had been trained to the highest degree
[1:13:33] he even declares and says you know that
[1:13:35] of those that would be there i i would
[1:13:37] be uh of the first i would be of the
[1:13:39] greatest because of where i come from my
[1:13:42] family and my teachings and my position
[1:13:45] now imagine what the religious world
[1:13:47] felt like when they saw paul
[1:13:50] get converted
[1:13:52] now i'm going to speak in blunt terms so
[1:13:54] i hope our guests don't mind too much
[1:13:55] but my brother and sister when paul got
[1:13:58] converted the religious world did not
[1:14:00] just sit back and go
[1:14:02] don't worry about it they were shook to
[1:14:04] their very core how could a cult
[1:14:07] get paul
[1:14:09] well they called jesus beelzebub and
[1:14:12] they branded the whole thing as heresy
[1:14:15] amen that's the the very definition or
[1:14:17] the very foundation of a cult and so
[1:14:19] they're they're freaking out about how
[1:14:22] that that uh the apostle paul as we know
[1:14:25] him but uh you see him now he slipped
[1:14:28] off the edge and he just kept going they
[1:14:30] i no doubt it doesn't really record it
[1:14:32] in scripture but no doubt many come to
[1:14:34] him and said paul come back paul come
[1:14:37] don't get away from them come back here
[1:14:39] everything will be fine we'll smooth it
[1:14:40] all over in the church and in the
[1:14:42] community and we'll tell them it was
[1:14:43] undercover operation and you just just
[1:14:46] come back paul and paul was there my
[1:14:48] brother and sister and god knew the
[1:14:50] influence of men and he knew the
[1:14:52] influence of education so paul is now
[1:14:55] sent to the back side of the desert oh
[1:14:57] i'll tell you what we hardly get out in
[1:14:59] the sagebrush and we're like oh lord
[1:15:00] what's happening to me
[1:15:03] lord what's going on
[1:15:05] everything's fell apart i lost my pinch
[1:15:07] and i lost this i lost that god sent him
[1:15:09] all the way to the backside of the
[1:15:10] desert
[1:15:11] amen he didn't want a partial
[1:15:13] rejuvenation as it were of paul he
[1:15:16] wanted a complete transformation amen
[1:15:19] that's what god's wanting to do in your
[1:15:21] life and my life he wants us to have a
[1:15:22] complete transformation not just a
[1:15:25] religious spirit not just a religious
[1:15:27] covering but a complete translate uh
[1:15:30] trans uh formation amen so you know it's
[1:15:33] like wow paul's now off to the back side
[1:15:35] of the desert you know and we think well
[1:15:37] how how can this be but you see god
[1:15:39] knows where to find his own
[1:15:41] he knew what he had called uh paul for
[1:15:44] and so we'll see when god goes to find
[1:15:46] his own he'll find him from the highest
[1:15:48] realms of education down to the back
[1:15:51] alleys of the district
[1:15:53] and i'm telling you what i don't know if
[1:15:55] some of you have but i have in life for
[1:15:57] foolish reasons uh
[1:16:01] traveled through the
[1:16:02] alleys of the district
[1:16:05] in the alleys of the district were
[1:16:06] pretty scary
[1:16:08] and you go in there
[1:16:10] in the flesh
[1:16:12] and you would look around you
[1:16:16] i i feel that just drive this home i
[1:16:18] want our young people not to just go
[1:16:20] okay okay brother paul's gonna preach a
[1:16:22] long time again today let me tell you
[1:16:24] there's many a young person right now
[1:16:27] that there is a girl or a boy of equal
[1:16:30] age on the streets in santiago chile
[1:16:32] selling their body the song that jay
[1:16:35] sang
[1:16:37] morals
[1:16:39] what's going my brother and sister one
[1:16:41] step at a time
[1:16:42] they didn't walk out of daddy's door
[1:16:44] almost door and just walk out and stand
[1:16:46] on the street corner there was something
[1:16:47] took him there step after step after
[1:16:49] step after step
[1:16:51] amen hear me
[1:16:53] the preacher needs to be able to preach
[1:16:55] something that's real for you because he
[1:16:58] has done it for me and i can tell you
[1:17:00] with all honesty and truth he is a
[1:17:03] healer he's a deliverer he gives
[1:17:05] revelation because by his mercy i have
[1:17:08] received all of these things not a
[1:17:11] second-hand religion of this said this
[1:17:14] said the prophet of god said the prophet
[1:17:16] of god said we quote those things my
[1:17:18] brother and sister but it needs to be
[1:17:20] real down in the heart of a son or
[1:17:22] daughter of god that when you lay your
[1:17:24] hand on a child a brother or a sister
[1:17:27] you're not quoting something or thinking
[1:17:29] of something out there you are thinking
[1:17:32] of something that happened to you
[1:17:34] something that is alive and the problem
[1:17:37] we have is way too much second-hand
[1:17:39] message
[1:17:41] amen way too much second-hand message
[1:17:44] and not enough personal message
[1:17:47] oh and we've all been guilty of it and
[1:17:48] we may be guilty of it again but i say
[1:17:51] lord help us
[1:17:52] help us lord
[1:17:54] hallelujah because you see when these
[1:17:56] men went out and started to speak these
[1:17:58] things and make these claims this was
[1:18:00] not whole follow me this was not the
[1:18:03] message paul was preaching
[1:18:06] paul did not say
[1:18:08] go out
[1:18:09] and cast out spirits in my name
[1:18:15] and the prophet of god did not say that
[1:18:17] either
[1:18:19] he pointed us clearly
[1:18:21] clearly back to the altar clearly back
[1:18:24] to the throne of almighty god it's there
[1:18:27] in the word and in the word alone
[1:18:29] there's where we find eternal life
[1:18:31] hallelujah
[1:18:33] not second hand
[1:18:35] no sir
[1:18:36] hallelujah
[1:18:38] you see my brother and sister there was
[1:18:40] such a power that happened there such an
[1:18:42] authority that happened it shook the
[1:18:44] city it shook ephesus ephesus amen it
[1:18:47] shook them because a fear fell over them
[1:18:49] they didn't say oh well we'll just write
[1:18:51] a little thing and blog and the gossip
[1:18:52] column here about something happened on
[1:18:54] the other side of town
[1:18:56] no sir a fear went through they said you
[1:18:58] realize that we witness paul who we
[1:19:00] thought was maybe a leader of a cult we
[1:19:02] witness paul speak to those spirits and
[1:19:05] they leave and we saw these guys over
[1:19:06] here and we saw these spirits tear them
[1:19:08] up
[1:19:09] now i don't want to make emphasis of
[1:19:10] this my brother and sister but if you
[1:19:12] walk in in your nice flowing gowns
[1:19:17] hallelujah just so some of you'll know
[1:19:20] my wife has graduated me in my clothing
[1:19:23] from goodwill and deseret industries
[1:19:26] to costco
[1:19:28] so we're moving up in the world
[1:19:35] but when the preacher walks out
[1:19:37] five thousand dollar suits
[1:19:40] rolexes aren't even good enough it's a
[1:19:42] what is it right
[1:19:44] brighton or something brighting or
[1:19:46] something is that the new end thing
[1:19:48] rolex's
[1:19:50] i mean you just go pawn shop and buy
[1:19:52] rolex
[1:19:57] they walked into that house
[1:20:00] a man possessed of a spirit
[1:20:03] in their great flowing gowns
[1:20:05] and they walked in there
[1:20:08] and said we
[1:20:09] i cheer you
[1:20:18] speaking of the god that paul preaches
[1:20:21] we don't know him
[1:20:24] we've never experienced the power and
[1:20:26] demonstration of it but we're gonna
[1:20:28] addre an evil spirit in other words a
[1:20:31] spirit right from the throne of the
[1:20:34] devil
[1:20:38] in this gospel
[1:20:39] that paul preaches
[1:20:43] come on saints
[1:20:45] don't fall for it
[1:20:46] don't fall for that spirit don't be
[1:20:48] looking back the holy ghost is here he
[1:20:49] said i'll be with you even in you we
[1:20:52] need to be able to stand here and say
[1:20:53] praise the lord i've got an experience
[1:20:55] i've got a testimony amen i maybe not
[1:20:58] have lived too much of life and went too
[1:20:59] many places and saw too many scary
[1:21:01] things but god still moved in my life
[1:21:03] and i know he is real and when the devil
[1:21:06] comes amen we don't want to be saying
[1:21:08] now now in the name of in the name of in
[1:21:10] the name of in the name of
[1:21:12] the devil leave me alone
[1:21:15] that song says in some midnight hour
[1:21:18] if you should find
[1:21:20] you were in a prison
[1:21:22] in your mind
[1:21:24] tell it to go away
[1:21:25] concerning the gospel that paul preaches
[1:21:30] no sir
[1:21:31] no sir
[1:21:32] you stand there in that experience i may
[1:21:35] not have every duck lined up in my life
[1:21:38] you guys have any ducks
[1:21:40] i've got rows and rows of ducks
[1:21:42] and i leave i think they're lined up and
[1:21:44] i come home and they're not
[1:21:46] i i don't understand what's happening
[1:21:49] and i try to line them all back up again
[1:21:51] and i go out and i live life
[1:21:54] and i yell at somebody
[1:21:57] i know none of you ever do that
[1:21:59] but you also don't deal with a whole
[1:22:01] herd of truck drivers either
[1:22:05] and you come home
[1:22:07] oh you know this embarrassing can i just
[1:22:09] be open honest with you you know how
[1:22:10] embarrassing it is to yell at somebody
[1:22:12] and you can't get five steps away from
[1:22:14] their truck and something comes down on
[1:22:17] you and you turn around you go back up
[1:22:18] forgive me
[1:22:23] god knows how to keep us humble
[1:22:25] but he's not worried about so much
[1:22:27] keeping you humble he's worried about
[1:22:28] keeping you lined up with the word and
[1:22:30] when you're lined up with the word you
[1:22:31] will be humble
[1:22:33] because you can't be in the word and
[1:22:35] have an arrogant spirit
[1:22:37] the word humbles every one of us
[1:22:39] every single day so the more of jesus we
[1:22:41] have the humbler we get
[1:22:43] amen amen where was i
[1:22:46] my
[1:22:48] you see this fear of fear fell upon them
[1:22:51] and
[1:22:52] the outcome of this is not
[1:22:55] that
[1:22:56] nothing happens
[1:22:59] the outcome is
[1:23:00] in that jesus christ was magnified amen
[1:23:06] you see
[1:23:07] the attention
[1:23:09] was greater upon those
[1:23:13] that actually didn't believe
[1:23:16] but it turned the eyes of certain people
[1:23:19] back to the truth amen
[1:23:22] and the fear of god moved in their midst
[1:23:24] and they said god is real
[1:23:26] god is real oh i was talking i was
[1:23:27] talking to you about flowing gowns
[1:23:30] imagine what it's like you go in there
[1:23:32] and you've got all these flowing gowns
[1:23:33] on and you walk in there and you adjure
[1:23:36] in the name of this gospel that paul is
[1:23:38] preaching
[1:23:39] and these same guys come fleeing out the
[1:23:41] door and i don't want to make too much
[1:23:42] emphasis on it but they're now tore up
[1:23:45] they're bloody they're bruised and
[1:23:46] they're naked
[1:23:49] none of their robes none of their
[1:23:51] presentation none of their whatever did
[1:23:54] them one bit of good amen
[1:23:56] hallelujah
[1:23:58] hallelujah look we believe in coming to
[1:24:00] church wearing our finest but our finest
[1:24:02] isn't going to save us that's right
[1:24:04] yeah
[1:24:07] so
[1:24:10] as we look at this we recognize
[1:24:12] that these men recognize the power of
[1:24:14] god
[1:24:15] and so they decided we want to use this
[1:24:18] now i don't think my brother and sister
[1:24:19] because they refused jesus right jesus
[1:24:21] said now if you have believed moses
[1:24:25] the words that moses spoke you would
[1:24:27] believe the words that i spoke because
[1:24:29] moses was speaking of me
[1:24:31] and so when you look at this in this
[1:24:33] context you'll recognize now that these
[1:24:36] men saw the power of god and they wanted
[1:24:38] to use that but they weren't going to
[1:24:40] give the glory to god
[1:24:44] i read a quote today you can look it up
[1:24:45] you can find it brother branham says now
[1:24:48] if you're not going to use your life for
[1:24:49] the gospel today don't even come through
[1:24:51] this prayer line
[1:24:54] that's pretty strong words
[1:24:56] why because he's encouraging the people
[1:24:58] don't come here for your carnal benefit
[1:25:00] come here to be changed that you can
[1:25:03] magnify jesus christ
[1:25:06] so they wanted to use it but they had no
[1:25:07] revelation so in reality my brother and
[1:25:10] sister they're just simply imposters
[1:25:12] going around speaking the name of jesus
[1:25:14] christ but it is not even with the
[1:25:17] intent to bring glory or magnify the
[1:25:19] lord jesus christ amen
[1:25:21] so
[1:25:22] god and paul i've got to hurry along
[1:25:24] here i don't know how time just escapes
[1:25:26] like this saints
[1:25:29] god in paul
[1:25:30] was magnifying the name of jesus christ
[1:25:32] to the people
[1:25:33] you will not find anywhere in the
[1:25:35] scripture it sounds boastful right
[1:25:36] people are like well look where paul we
[1:25:38] don't like this paul i paul an apostle
[1:25:41] of jesus christ no his life backed it up
[1:25:44] now i met some people that just told me
[1:25:46] over and over and over again every time
[1:25:48] i run into them i'm an apostle i'm an
[1:25:50] apostle you should let me have authority
[1:25:52] over you i'm an apostle i'm an apostle
[1:25:53] sorry i don't see any apostle attributes
[1:25:58] well every
[1:25:59] tree brings forth his own fruit you know
[1:26:02] the same kind and you know if it
[1:26:04] abandons an apostle he don't have to
[1:26:05] tell you he's an apostle his life will
[1:26:07] tell you he's an apostle
[1:26:09] amen
[1:26:12] you see so paul was magnifying jesus
[1:26:15] christ to the people and he did that by
[1:26:17] preaching of the gospel in power and
[1:26:19] authority and you know we are called
[1:26:21] today to magnify the name of jesus
[1:26:23] christ to the people this is not
[1:26:25] something of a day gone by this is a day
[1:26:28] that you and i my brother and sister can
[1:26:30] live a life that is so on fire for god
[1:26:33] and such a life that the world would say
[1:26:36] you know what i don't agree with these
[1:26:38] uh and i'm not boasting myself but i
[1:26:39] hear this from people all the time uh
[1:26:41] you know i got all these farmer friends
[1:26:43] oh preacher paul preacher paul they
[1:26:45] called me out right to my face oh
[1:26:46] preacher paul what'd you preach last
[1:26:48] week
[1:26:49] and i said i preached on you
[1:26:52] you ought to see their eyes
[1:26:54] what do you mean preached on me i said i
[1:26:55] preached on the unbeliever
[1:26:58] well i'm not a believer i know god's
[1:27:00] real
[1:27:01] so is the
[1:27:02] devil you know i've got them toughened
[1:27:05] up
[1:27:06] they used to be like
[1:27:08] oh don't talk to me like that
[1:27:10] now they're like
[1:27:12] okay
[1:27:16] why because it's the truth amen but they
[1:27:18] know i love them and i'll do anything
[1:27:20] for them
[1:27:21] yeah just carnal men out here live out
[1:27:23] here south of town carnal men they know
[1:27:25] i love them
[1:27:26] they know i'll do it for them
[1:27:28] but they know
[1:27:29] that won't do any good
[1:27:31] to push paul around
[1:27:32] because i ain't moving
[1:27:34] and even if paul wanted to move i
[1:27:36] couldn't because you see this anchor
[1:27:38] called christ
[1:27:40] amen said i'm not going to let you be
[1:27:42] blown
[1:27:43] in every direction i'm not going to let
[1:27:45] you fall for this doctrine and get
[1:27:47] tossed over here and the wind blows back
[1:27:50] this way and then the wind blows back
[1:27:51] this way no sorry i'm anchored amen
[1:27:54] angry i'm glad i am because you see i
[1:27:56] quit being a pastor and i quit about
[1:27:58] everything about at least i don't know
[1:28:00] 10 000 times in the last few years
[1:28:02] but i'm still here
[1:28:04] why
[1:28:05] because when the wind blows and get
[1:28:07] blowed away
[1:28:08] amen
[1:28:10] all i can say is thank you lord i don't
[1:28:11] want to sound i don't want to sound
[1:28:12] boastful i just wanna i'm just telling
[1:28:14] you i know it's real i know it's real
[1:28:16] all i gotta do is just believe it
[1:28:17] confess it and hold on
[1:28:19] amen so you see
[1:28:21] we we're not projecting what we think
[1:28:24] right that's why it's church i'm very
[1:28:26] careful when i speak to you of things i
[1:28:27] think that i always say this is paul's
[1:28:30] opinion you can toss it out if you want
[1:28:32] because i don't want to present my
[1:28:34] opinion as gospel to you
[1:28:37] amen what we want to do project christ
[1:28:39] amen now look many of you would say you
[1:28:42] know what brother paul all these things
[1:28:43] is happening
[1:28:44] i'm just not equipped
[1:28:46] i'm not equipped
[1:28:48] you know to to deal with these spirits
[1:28:49] i'm not equipped to deal with all of
[1:28:51] this stuff i i that that's not who i am
[1:28:54] i'm just a little old lamb i'm just a
[1:28:56] little believer i've i've only been in
[1:28:58] the message for just a little bit to
[1:29:00] i've only served god for just a little
[1:29:02] bit i'm not i'm no that's that's job of
[1:29:04] the preachers that's a job to the elders
[1:29:06] that's a
[1:29:07] okay well we're going to just go into
[1:29:10] the bible and we're going to look at
[1:29:11] this little guy his name was shamgar
[1:29:14] amen and shamgar you know year after
[1:29:16] year shamgar was there at the harvest
[1:29:18] now you know i don't know if you guys
[1:29:20] can relate to that you've had a garden
[1:29:22] you can there's just something about
[1:29:24] being a farmer that when you go out
[1:29:26] there and and you know the amber waves
[1:29:28] of grain as it is look really good in a
[1:29:30] silage pit
[1:29:32] amen my whole goal is to to chop them up
[1:29:35] and put it in the pit and it goes across
[1:29:37] the scale and the man writes me a oh
[1:29:39] should i talk this way sounds carnal
[1:29:41] he writes me a big fat check when it's
[1:29:43] all over
[1:29:47] the corn's beautiful
[1:29:49] oh this sounds so carnal
[1:29:51] but so is that check
[1:29:55] but it goes much deeper than that
[1:29:59] there's something in me that just
[1:30:02] in the springtime
[1:30:04] look and you see those little plants
[1:30:06] coming
[1:30:08] popping up out of the ground and you can
[1:30:10] see row
[1:30:11] after row after row
[1:30:14] you see even though i joke about the
[1:30:16] carnal side and the check looks good
[1:30:21] i have this revival every spring time
[1:30:25] and a reminder as i sit there
[1:30:28] every seed amen every seed
[1:30:31] will bring forth of its own kind and i
[1:30:34] have this revival every year in the
[1:30:37] springtime
[1:30:40] and i have a revival for that same every
[1:30:43] fall
[1:30:44] when i walk out there
[1:30:46] here is the seed this is what i put in
[1:30:48] the ground
[1:30:49] and this is what it's produced a
[1:30:51] bountiful harvest
[1:30:55] and i look at that in the spiritual
[1:30:56] realm
[1:30:59] thank you lord i'm not dead cold and wet
[1:31:02] laying in the dirt somewhere
[1:31:05] and i'm alive in jesus christ
[1:31:08] and i get to magnify christ
[1:31:11] by reproducing christ
[1:31:13] in the flesh
[1:31:16] and that's my whole heart my whole
[1:31:18] desire and i pray and i preach it to you
[1:31:20] because i want you to grasp that and say
[1:31:23] you know what i am of his seed he's the
[1:31:25] one has planted me he's the one who
[1:31:27] watered me and he's the one as it were
[1:31:29] will harvest me amen i'm not some
[1:31:32] wayward seed i'm not a stray i'm not
[1:31:34] something that was just randomly tossed
[1:31:36] out but i am intentional in jesus christ
[1:31:40] hallelujah
[1:31:41] hallelujah you look at this my brother
[1:31:44] and sister
[1:31:45] oh
[1:31:46] and here's shamgar
[1:31:48] no doubt i'm sorry i went off on that
[1:31:50] tangent but here's shamgar at the heart
[1:31:52] that's going out
[1:31:54] and and he's looking at the harvest in
[1:31:56] his heart's like this would be the year
[1:31:58] this would be the years he looked now
[1:31:59] brother brown talks about this you can
[1:32:01] go read it he talks about there's his
[1:32:02] wife and rags and his little girl little
[1:32:04] boys they're hungry and they're saying
[1:32:06] oh daddy is this the year is this the
[1:32:08] time daddy and
[1:32:10] the harvest is great
[1:32:12] the granaries are now full
[1:32:16] can i put it this way
[1:32:18] revival has come to the church
[1:32:20] who's the church
[1:32:23] is it this building
[1:32:24] no it is you and i
[1:32:26] revival has come to the church
[1:32:29] and we are full of joy
[1:32:32] and then you hear
[1:32:38] gem guard be like oh my goodness
[1:32:43] them rotten no good philistines have
[1:32:45] come back again
[1:32:49] but how many times have we set in the
[1:32:51] house of god
[1:32:52] set in our car set in our living room
[1:32:55] set somewhere in the trees or whatever
[1:32:57] and the spirit of god move upon us
[1:33:00] and you find yourself weeping and you
[1:33:02] find yourself saying oh lord
[1:33:04] oh lord thank you you're so good to me
[1:33:06] but somewhere in the background
[1:33:15] now you don't have to lift no hands but
[1:33:17] i tell you saints
[1:33:18] i believe most if not every one of us
[1:33:21] has had the devil show up and steal our
[1:33:23] joy
[1:33:24] we've had the devil show up and steal
[1:33:26] our victory
[1:33:28] and we sit back and said what can i do
[1:33:30] what can i do what could i do i'm just a
[1:33:33] believer i'm i'm not worthy i'm full of
[1:33:36] mistakes
[1:33:37] i'm full of mistakes i why would god
[1:33:39] come on the scene for me now because
[1:33:40] yesterday i just did this and this
[1:33:44] why would god answer my prayer i can't
[1:33:46] even live right
[1:33:49] jamgar
[1:33:51] after his little girl and his wife
[1:33:54] they're ragged clothes and they're
[1:33:56] hungry

[1:34:00] and you can see old sham garth oh no not
[1:34:03] again

[1:34:09] now look what brother branham says
[1:34:11] in the message what is that in the hand
[1:34:14] this is preached in 1955 saints and i'll
[1:34:16] tell you for me i could only speak for
[1:34:18] me it was like it was preached this
[1:34:19] morning
[1:34:21] amen this is not something preached way
[1:34:23] way back off in the deal and then it's
[1:34:24] all historical this is alive to me this
[1:34:27] morning just like my bible is alive to
[1:34:30] me this morning it's not a history we're
[1:34:32] looking back oh this happened you know
[1:34:34] this happened brother branham prayed for
[1:34:36] a possum i can't even pray for a
[1:34:38] headache
[1:34:40] don't give up
[1:34:42] don't give up
[1:34:44] amen stand on the word don't give up
[1:34:47] amen faith is growing faith is growing
[1:34:50] can i say it again faith is growing
[1:34:53] amen faith is becoming more real today
[1:34:56] than it was yesterday it is not about
[1:34:59] some great event where we'll step out
[1:35:01] and in the name of jesus christ this it
[1:35:03] will be you speaking victory after
[1:35:06] victory after victory in your own life
[1:35:09] amen it will not be about some great
[1:35:12] public display the prophet of god said
[1:35:14] the word will no longer be a great
[1:35:16] public display because the word has now
[1:35:19] moved down into the bride and it is the
[1:35:22] bride who is speaking the word and she
[1:35:24] is speaking the word maybe to those
[1:35:26] around her because we need friends and
[1:35:28] brothers and sisters but oftentimes it's
[1:35:31] just the word being spoke from you to
[1:35:34] you amen
[1:35:35] amen or from me to me or i die or
[1:35:37] however the right words would be
[1:35:40] you know shamgar looked around he just
[1:35:43] didn't know what to do
[1:35:44] he looked around he said i couldn't
[1:35:46] fight
[1:35:47] i'm not a fighter
[1:35:49] and i ain't got time to go out and learn
[1:35:51] how to duel and take all these exercises
[1:35:53] and things i haven't got time to run
[1:35:56] back and start reading the message and
[1:35:57] reading my bible like i should have for
[1:35:59] years
[1:36:02] oh wait that's not in there
[1:36:05] maybe it is
[1:36:07] it was right there between the line
[1:36:11] but he happens to look at the word
[1:36:15] oh come on forgive me but i'm i'm sorry
[1:36:16] i just got to preach this inspiration
[1:36:18] happened to look and set in the corner
[1:36:20] was that old bible with some dust on it
[1:36:24] oh let me get back to this
[1:36:28] center no locks go you know an ox code
[1:36:30] is it's a big old stick with a brass end
[1:36:33] on it to knock the punch the cattle
[1:36:35] through the gate with for one thing and
[1:36:37] then knocked the dirt off the plow and
[1:36:39] they was plowing with it and all ox code
[1:36:41] laying there that was the only thing
[1:36:43] that he could put in his hand
[1:36:48] doesn't seem like much does it
[1:36:54] some days it doesn't seem like much
[1:36:59] because we've read it for years without
[1:37:01] inspiration that's it
[1:37:03] we've read it for
[1:37:04] years that's right that's a ritual
[1:37:08] amen
[1:37:09] and it was just sitting there
[1:37:11] in the corner
[1:37:15] lord help me
[1:37:17] lord help us
[1:37:20] but you know what
[1:37:21] i don't say he got angered but his
[1:37:24] righteous indignation got up and he said
[1:37:25] yes sir brother i will tell you he
[1:37:28] what's in your hand
[1:37:29] what's in your hand and i want to ask
[1:37:31] you today what's in your hand
[1:37:33] amen
[1:37:34] nothing but an ox code and he said i'm
[1:37:36] not a fighter i can't do this
[1:37:39] anybody said that
[1:37:41] when was the last time you said that
[1:37:43] well praise the lord for me it was about
[1:37:45] 6 am
[1:37:48] i got up
[1:37:50] my eyes were so blurred up this morning
[1:37:53] i sat there and i looked at the ipad and
[1:37:55] i tried to read my
[1:37:57] bible and all this stuff and i was like
[1:37:59] lord i can't do this
[1:38:01] i'm so tired my bones hurt lord forgive
[1:38:05] me lord but i'm so tired
[1:38:07] i don't know brother david would have
[1:38:08] probably been up at 6 a.m i could have
[1:38:10] called him brother chris probably would
[1:38:11] have been up 6 a.m could have called him
[1:38:14] and the lord says well what do you got
[1:38:16] in your hand he did
[1:38:18] well i've got a message in my hand i've
[1:38:20] got something on my heart amen
[1:38:22] hallelujah
[1:38:23] so you look at this now
[1:38:25] he said oh i'm not a fighter
[1:38:28] i haven't got any training
[1:38:31] but he hadn't time to do any training
[1:38:33] the only thing he needed
[1:38:35] was the spirit
[1:38:37] of god
[1:38:39] on him
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:42] come on i'm talking to believers i'm
[1:38:43] talking to christians
[1:38:45] but let's not let this world and cares
[1:38:48] of this world get us to a place we're
[1:38:50] questioning what can i do

[1:38:56] lord amen get the spirit of the lord on

[1:39:10] sending their tears just dripping off my
[1:39:11] face

[1:39:17] this way you know i like to just be open
[1:39:19] i can come
[1:39:21] but
[1:39:22] 17 18 years of preaching hundreds and
[1:39:24] hundreds uh in the thousands of sermons
[1:39:28] i can come and preach you a sermon
[1:39:30] i can come and i can put scriptures
[1:39:32] together i can put quotes together
[1:39:34] i can do all of this and i can get up
[1:39:36] here and i can preach you a sermon
[1:39:39] but i don't want to preach you a sermon
[1:39:41] i want to preach christ and him crucify
[1:39:43] to you i want to preach the truth do you
[1:39:45] want to preach life to you yes will it
[1:39:48] be in the form of a sermon yes it will
[1:39:50] be in the form of a sermon but it can
[1:39:52] either be full of the spirit of god or
[1:39:54] it can be empty and just be words
[1:39:58] what we need is the spirit of god on
[1:40:01] amen what did he do he jumped out that
[1:40:02] window with the spirit of god on him he
[1:40:04] took that ox goat and killed 600
[1:40:06] philistines amen that sounds pretty
[1:40:08] bloody doesn't it but i'll tell you what
[1:40:09] i'd like to do to the devil
[1:40:12] hallelujah he'd be drawn and quartered
[1:40:15] he'd know that he's defeated before we
[1:40:18] ever get to the day of judgment
[1:40:20] you see but we can't do that just by
[1:40:21] saying oh devil get out of my life
[1:40:24] leave my family alone
[1:40:25] look don't know
[1:40:28] he's got to know who you are
[1:40:30] in other words let me put it this way to
[1:40:32] you as we'll get ready to close
[1:40:34] the devil has to see you as an adversary
[1:40:39] if you have
[1:40:41] a treaty
[1:40:44] with the devil
[1:40:46] you are not his adversary
[1:40:51] oh you say brother paul what's a treaty
[1:40:53] well
[1:40:55] that's where i was
[1:40:57] when my kids were little
[1:41:01] and the god in my life as my wife used
[1:41:03] to say your girlfriend
[1:41:07] was a dirt bike
[1:41:11] because my wife preached to me when i
[1:41:12] was in the house oh she never said word
[1:41:17] huh
[1:41:19] i really love to ride my dirt bike
[1:41:21] because you see saints i had signed a
[1:41:23] treaty with the devil
[1:41:26] and i said if you leave me alone
[1:41:29] i'll leave
[1:41:30] you alone
[1:41:32] but one day the holy ghost come and i
[1:41:34] had the treaty laying on the shelf right
[1:41:35] there and that
[1:41:36] silly treaty caught fire and burnt up
[1:41:40] had no more treaty with the devil and
[1:41:42] from then on i looked at the devil and i
[1:41:44] said you know what you know there's a
[1:41:45] lot of things in my life
[1:41:47] i blame you for
[1:41:50] but in reality
[1:41:52] it was my own fault
[1:41:54] because i was the one who signed the
[1:41:55] treaty
[1:41:57] no one made me sign the treaty with the
[1:41:59] devil so here satan
[1:42:03] declaration
[1:42:06] of
[1:42:07] war
[1:42:08] amen
[1:42:11] and i picked up my bible and the lord
[1:42:13] took me to a scripture and said i would
[1:42:15] vanquish
[1:42:16] amen my enemy amen
[1:42:19] and he would become dust amen under my
[1:42:22] feet amen amen
[1:42:26] hallelujah
[1:42:27] how do i do that how do you do that
[1:42:30] with the spirit of god on you
[1:42:32] that's the only way you're ever going to
[1:42:34] do it is with the spirit of god on you
[1:42:37] hallelujah
[1:42:39] amen
[1:42:40] now look you know me i kind of baited
[1:42:43] you there i said we're almost done
[1:42:45] we're almost done with that quote
[1:42:49] god has to judge the world by something
[1:42:50] and if he judges it by the church which
[1:42:52] one of it is he going to judge by why
[1:42:54] there's no such a thing as could be
[1:42:56] judged and there's only one thing that's
[1:42:58] left his word it's eternal it can't be
[1:43:00] added to or taken away and i've anchored
[1:43:03] my soul there
[1:43:05] with the simplicity of laying my hands
[1:43:08] upon my sacrifice
[1:43:11] does it get any simpler than that
[1:43:14] laying our hands upon the sacrifice amen
[1:43:19] confessing that i'm no good at all
[1:43:22] there's nothing in me o lord god send
[1:43:24] that messiah upon me and change my being
[1:43:26] to what i was and make me in your own
[1:43:28] fashion the way you'd have me be
[1:43:30] no matter how much you could burn a body
[1:43:33] how much you could destroy a person how
[1:43:35] much you can talk against them or
[1:43:37] whatever he says someday he'll raise us
[1:43:40] up again and there is a kingdom that we
[1:43:43] receive that cannot be moved oh my
[1:43:47] hallelujah amen and remember of all this
[1:43:51] glorious thing that we're now enjoying
[1:43:53] sitting in heavenly places is just a
[1:43:56] prelude hallelujah it's a prelude to
[1:43:59] what is coming that's just the
[1:44:01] introductory of the symphony that's
[1:44:03] coming now my brother and sister i can
[1:44:06] only speak for my own experience and i
[1:44:07] don't mean to focus it on me but i have
[1:44:10] been there i have witnessed it and this
[1:44:12] man right here you know him all too well
[1:44:14] this man right here has nothing special
[1:44:16] about him but when we get in the right
[1:44:19] place in the spirit of god is upon us
[1:44:22] and we are standing to bring glory and
[1:44:24] magnify jesus christ we can lay hands
[1:44:27] and they'll recover we can lay hands and
[1:44:29] broken bones are healed cross eyes or
[1:44:32] changes spirits are cast out and we
[1:44:34] didn't do this to boast we do this to
[1:44:36] give glory to god
[1:44:38] hallelujah i have seen it in africa i've
[1:44:41] seen it seen a little girl oh hallelujah
[1:44:44] i've told you about her before a devil
[1:44:46] on her so much that she's scar her own
[1:44:49] flesh and these things and to see her i
[1:44:51] just watched and listened to her singing
[1:44:53] the other night and there she is a happy
[1:44:55] married young woman singing praises to
[1:44:58] the lord oh the devil thought he had her
[1:45:01] already he'd already put his brand on
[1:45:03] her forearm but god come and says sorry
[1:45:06] devil you rustler you you cannot come
[1:45:09] and take what is mine
[1:45:11] hallelujah what is that because we made
[1:45:14] a decision to get on the spirit of god
[1:45:17] upon us to get in the spirit of the lord
[1:45:20] not to just be carnal go to church kind
[1:45:22] of christian but to be sincere and on

[1:47:04] i don't think he was a great big strong
[1:47:05] man

[1:47:47] i just want to make the point
[1:47:51] the finest
[1:47:53] of the finest of the philistine army
[1:47:57] which would be very comparable to the
[1:47:59] finest
[1:48:00] of satan's army
[1:48:05] and a little ready guy with an ox code
[1:48:08] that you can bust over the back of that

[1:54:36] a home
[1:54:38] for
[1:54:39] the presence
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:59] that i might be
[1:55:02] what i was
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:10] you know sometimes we
[1:55:12] preach things in such a way it's like oh
[1:55:15] we're preaching something baby
[1:55:18] to someone that's struggling
[1:55:22] but i can tell you saints the lord is
[1:55:23] running us through the refiners fire
[1:55:25] again and again
[1:55:27] amen it wasn't just a one-time cleansing
[1:55:30] but it's a continual cleansing in his
[1:55:32] presence
[1:55:34] burning out every little smudge right
[1:55:36] the scripture says that we would not
[1:55:38] even want a smudge on the hem
[1:55:42] of our garment
[1:55:43] i stand today i lift my hands and say
[1:55:45] lord
[1:55:46] lord just clean me from head to toe
[1:55:49] clean me father that i not even have a
[1:55:51] smudge lord not one thing
[1:55:54] that would be presentable to the world
[1:55:56] in in defense of satan in defense of his
[1:56:00] program defense of his his spirit but we
[1:56:03] would be just completely completely
[1:56:05] completely surrendered to the holy
[1:56:08] spirit
[1:56:09] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:56:12] now i want you to think on this it'll be
[1:56:13] something i i'll i'll preach i think i
[1:56:16] kind of forgot
[1:56:17] uh to put this note but yet it was in my
[1:56:21] paper notes
[1:56:22] the prophet of god preached
[1:56:30] he preached on
[1:56:33] the power of the devil
[1:56:35] it seems like a strange thing right
[1:56:38] till you look real careful what he
[1:56:40] preached and he says the only power
[1:56:42] satan has is death
[1:56:45] and when death comes satan's power is
[1:56:47] finished it's over
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:56:51] brother paul how would you put the
[1:56:52] gospel in a nutshell
[1:56:57] well i would put it in this fashion
[1:56:59] right here
[1:57:02] die today
[1:57:05] die today
[1:57:07] in jesus christ
[1:57:10] that there's no death that the devil can
[1:57:13] bring that can hurt you
[1:57:15] touch you influence you
[1:57:19] be my prayer i'd say this day lord
[1:57:23] help us lord to die
[1:57:28] help us lord to die
[1:57:31] to ourself to our flesh
[1:57:33] to our reasoning to our thinking
[1:57:36] to the devil's whispers of
[1:57:38] what you have been
[1:57:40] imagine the whispers of what has been
[1:57:43] you're the woman at the well
[1:57:45] think the devil ever whispered anything
[1:57:46] in your ear afterwards
[1:57:48] amen you go right on down through the
[1:57:50] bible every one of those sweet ladies
[1:57:53] that god brought out made a part of the
[1:57:54] family of god you don't think the devil
[1:57:56] ever whispered in their ear
[1:57:58] [Music]
[1:58:00] but they knew
[1:58:01] that they knew that they knew
[1:58:04] the prophet of god goes right on
[1:58:06] very next service
[1:58:08] and preaches on the power of god
[1:58:12] [Music]

[1:58:17] the face of this
[1:58:20] this power is immeasurable
[1:58:22] unlimited
[1:58:26] and that's good
[1:58:27] power of the devil we recognize it power
[1:58:29] of god we recognize it the very next
[1:58:31] sermon he preaches
[1:58:33] the power of decision
[1:58:36] and you know one of the most powerful
[1:58:38] decisions you'll ever make
[1:58:39] [Music]
[1:58:41] is the decision to leave the past
[1:58:44] and press to the mark of the high
[1:58:46] calling
[1:58:48] and when we make that decision and it's
[1:58:50] been stamped as irrevocable
[1:58:52] it's a life-changing decision
