Amen. Who's going to be there? [music] I &gt;&gt; don't see too many hands. &gt;&gt; Who's going to be there? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I hope I am, Brother David." You don't need to hope anymore. You can know. [music] &gt;&gt; You can know. There's a divine evidence that you can be given that you know you're going to be there. Amen. Well, anyway, it's glad to Are you glad to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. I was glad David said when [music] they said unto me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Of course, we know the real house of the Lord. And here, this this building becomes the house of the Lord when the house of the Lord comes in it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because we know where there was only one place of worship and that's in the house of the Lord &gt;&gt; and that's where he put his name in his house. So, I believe there's a measure of the house. There's a portion of the house here in this day in our day that's called his body. Amen. So, we're thankful to be a part of that to know that we are. And so, we're happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning. I was Thank you for praying for us on the trip. We had a good trip. We were up in Washington and Oregon and and had good fellowship with the people and brother John and they sent their greetings to you and and uh we just had a wonderful time. The meetings were went very well and had some good visit with friends we haven't seen for many many years and and so everything went fine. We appreciate it. Good to be here with you and back and uh and let's just have a word of prayer while we're standing. Our precious Lord, we give to you this service had given it into your hands. Lord, we haven't come to frolic. We haven't come to to see necessarily what each other. We've come here to see you and to receive from you and to know that we are ordained and led to be here where we are. And Lord, I know that out among me and right here is predestinated seed. And Lord, may you open their hearts and give them such a rest and peace to know where they're standing because as your prophet said, it's so good to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ. So Lord, open your word. We're expecting you to we're expecting you to speak and I'm expecting you to reveal your word to us and this morning that we may leave here raised to a higher plane in Christ. Closer drawn to you for that's our desire Lord is more of you. And Lord we know that we just sang that song when the role is called up on yonder. There will be a role called and Lord we we know and we we are placing our faith in that that we are there and will be there because it was ordained by you before the world began. And you can't miss your purpose. Your purpose will be done. And we're thankful that we can be assembled once again. These doors are open. This church doors are open, Lord. That we are able to come in here still have the freedom to speak. And Lord, we just thank you for this. And Lord, I don't know who's listening online, but Lord, may you bless those that are hearing. And may they really hear and may all hear it this morning beyond our ability to outwardly hear. But Lord, let it what we hear be from our heart. &gt;&gt; Because there's where we hear, Lord, truly, we ask these things now in thy name, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. I'd like you to turn with me in your Bibles to Psalm 57. I may sound a little horsearo. I'm I'm feeling fine. I just kind of got over a little bit of a a cold and and but by the grace of God, we're able to take this service this morning and and I'm not passing anything to anybody. So, don't worry about that. And may you just lose thinking or thought of that. Amen. Amen. We're here by the name in the name of the Lord Jesus. I want to title this sermon as I'll read the scripture here. My heart is fixed. And my subtitle and if I should just give it a subject here. I'm kind of taking a part two way back. I preached in July of Christ for me to live is Christ. And I'm taking that back up again. But my title is my heart is fixed. And when I say my heart, I hope yours is too. I trust it is my heart is fixed and I'm learning to lean for me to live is Christ. So Psalm 57:7, my heart is fixed, oh God, my heart is fixed. I will sing and give praise. Psalm 112 verse 7. Seven is the number seven again. He will not be afraid. Speaking of us individually, and I trust that you'll take this individually, he shall not be afraid of evil tidings. His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. Amen. I'd like you to turn with me while you're standing, if you will, to Philippians chapter 1 and we'll read verse 20. Let's just take verse 19 with it. Paul's speaking, for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed that with all boldness as always. So now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death. for me to live. I want to say that again. For me, I hope we're looking at the individual member here today. He's speaking to you. I pray that you can put your yourself in that. For me, and I say for me, for me, and for you to live is Christ. To live, notice, to live is Christ. And to die is gain. You may be seated. I want you to turn for a little lengthy reading with me to Ephesians. And there's something I'd like to have you in Ephesians embrace chapter 1 starting with verse three. Very familiar scriptures but powerful words. And I pray that we will remember my subject here is for me to live as Christ. And when I say that it's learning to lean on what? Christ is my life. I trust that Christ is your life. That he's the absolute of your life. That nothing else matters but Christ. Amen. We must come to that place and have that position. It's not just a hope. So, it's not an emotion. But Christ is a person &gt;&gt; and it's the person of the word opened in you. It's not another person. It's Christ. It's the anointed word in you living. And that is the believers. And I'm just going to jump ahead a little bit here and make this statement. That is the believers. And we'll find out who the believer is, but that is the believer's absolute. The believer's absolute is not what he feels. The believer's absolute is not his senses. The believer's absolute is the shepherd which is in you leading you. The Bible said Psalm 23:1, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want." Other words, without want meaning I'll have no lack. No lack. For Christ is in me. That is my shepherd leading and said for me to live for me to live I want to emphasize that word live. I want to emphasize Christ and the word live because what we're talking about here for me to live is not live natural but to live spiritually which is eternal life. For me to live whether when I live in this body my my focus and my absolute is in Christ in me. &gt;&gt; The Bible said the mystery of God revealed would be Christ in you. &gt;&gt; And that is where you stand. That's the bride's stand in this hour we're talking about this morning the bride's stand where she is where she's identified and that's in Christ in Ephesians 1 chapter verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath that's a word past tense here who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ now that's not something that will be we're talking about something that is now that we that the believer the true believer and we'll we'll come to that in a moment what the believer is. We mentioned it many times but you may have forgotten and the Lord wants to remind you who the believer is and what he is but here we are that he hath blessed us. Is there anyone here? He's speaking to someone this morning. He's speaking, I pray, to more than one. He's speaking to me this morning. He has blessed me. &gt;&gt; Us meaning us, meaning the body of Christ. Because this this uh letter here is is addressed to the saints. Amen. It's not only to the saints of Ephesus alone, but to the saints today. He's addressing this. He's addressing this to his body that he hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Christ in heavenly places in Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the believer's position in Christ. According as he hath here again, past tense chosen us. So according as he hath chosen us in him. The Bible said you didn't choose him. He chose us. And he chose us. The Bible says here before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; So before you had any consciousness of it, before you even knew it, God chose you in himself before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That should settle a lot of matters right now. Because if he hath chosen you, he's not left you. He chose you and he hasn't got a different thought concerning you. He's not got a different mind concerning you. The Bible speaks to someone. This Bible speaks to you and I. this Bible, we find ourselves written here in the word. The bride because she's in Christ and Christ in her, chosen in him. Then we find that he's the word. And if he's the word, you're the word. &gt;&gt; Because he chose you in the word. &gt;&gt; So we know that in the beginning was the word and that's where you are, right? That's who in the beginning there where you are because the word was a thought and that thought had to be expressed. But he chose you in himself before he even expressed it. He had chose you in himself before the foundation of the world. And then express what he chose. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so and so here we say here we see that we should that he chose us before the foundation of the world in him. I want you to notice we were chosen in him that we should be holy. That we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Oh, you say, "Well, brother David, I can't believe I've been chosen." I want you to embrace these scriptures. I'm speaking to the bride this morning. I believe I'm speaking to predestinated seed. I want you to embrace what we're reading here from verse 3 to verse 12. I want you to embrace it. I want you to take it and take it as your own. &gt;&gt; Other words, I'm as we read here, we'll begin to realize I want you to embrace who you are. &gt;&gt; And I want you to embrace your predestination and that he chose you. Y &gt;&gt; and I believe there's a bride that can take that and embrace that. &gt;&gt; That's that's this word right here that we're reading ought to be absolute to someone here this morning. It's absolute to me. I pray that it's absolute to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he said verse five, having so he predestinated that we should be holy. And if he said we should be holy, we're going to be holy. I don't know what you have to go through in learning to be holy, but you're going to be holy because you're going to come to realization of your position and that's in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it it should that which should take all the struggle away, all the strife away. And these scriptures ought to be your final word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so so here having verse five, having predestinated now that big word and then and it doesn't have to be complicated. It means he forneew you before the foundation of the world. He knew all things. He knew you. He knew what you would do. He and he chose you according to what he knew. &gt;&gt; And so he knew you. You you didn't have knowing of him because you didn't know you were in your father before you were born. And now realize that you had to be in your father. And and to be a part of your father, you had to be in your father to begin with. And to have eternal life and to be a son of God, you had to be in God, which is eternal to begin with. There's no other way. If you are a son of God, you know you're a son of God, then you had to be in God. You had to be in eternal life and had to be his thought of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, having predestinated us, predestined. &gt;&gt; Amen. Something he could do before the world began. We realize that that the Bible said Jacob he didn't see it's not the person that come predestinated aresh from God. It's not the person it's the seed &gt;&gt; that he planted there because God expressed what he thought in word and that word became that seed. And so every seed shall produce of its own kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're a seed of God, there's only one thing you can do. And whatever God t has to take to get you there, you're going to recognize your position and realize that you're his kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can't produce anything but his kind. And he'll do it through a many membered body and members in particular, but they're all they're all part of one headstone, headship. And see, the message in this day has taken us from a birth. It's it's taking us to maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adoption. Adoption is coming to maturity of who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. In our position. And so having predestinated us unto the adoption of children. Adoption there is placing of children. Maturity of children. Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of your will. No, you didn't have your will in it. It was according to the good pleasure of his will. I want you to embrace this. Amen. We're here to embrace it this morning. &gt;&gt; Come out of here raised to a higher plane. Forgetting your fretfulness, forgetting your fear about mistakes and failures to recognize you were chosen in him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't be anything else. &gt;&gt; You can't be anything else. You're You can't be someone else in your soul than him. God predestinated play predestinated or he placed his seedword in you &gt;&gt; because he chose you. All right. Then to the verse six to the praise of the glory of his grace. &gt;&gt; What powerful words. It's not your doing. It's his grace. Wherein he hath made us accepted. He made us. He made us accepted in the beloved in Jesus Christ who is a perfect one. He made you accept it in him. He lived the life that that Christ demanded and and required. And when he lived it, you were there living it in him. &gt;&gt; So you're already accepted in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's where our typost is &gt;&gt; is in Jesus Christ. All right. So So to to the praise and glory of his grace where whereby we've been made, we hath he hath made. He already made us. He already made us accepted in Christ in the beloved. In whom we have redemption through his blood, [snorts] the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. Seal it. &gt;&gt; Seal it in your hearts. Embrace that. &gt;&gt; You have redemption through his blood. It's not through your works. You can't do enough works to to supply or to or to satisfy him. It's by his grace you're saved through his faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He put the faith in you to believe what you what you're hearing. You He put the faith in you to believe this word and the scriptures written of you. He put that there. You didn't put it there. You can't explain it. You can't give it to somebody else. But God put it there. &gt;&gt; He's redeemed you by his blood. He was perfect blood that redeemed you. He's loosed you by perfect blood. And therefore, the loosing is is complete and perfect. concerning you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's already perfect and complete. Therefore, there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. He chose you in him. Therefore, there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. You say, "Well, brother David, what must I do?" Believe what you're hearing. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, it shows that God's living in you. It's not something you manufactured. It's not something you had to lift up and try to believe. It's in you. I say, "I believe that. I believe it because in me is that is that ability to receive it and hear it. &gt;&gt; It's speaking to me. It's speaking to someone. These words aren't just words in the air. These words are eternal words. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're speaking to someone this morning. They're speaking to someone on the on the on the internet this morning. They're speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "My sheep hear my voice." &gt;&gt; Amen. My sheep hear my voice. &gt;&gt; Who's his sheep? Those that he chosen himself before the world began. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. My sheep hear my voice. And a stranger they're not going to follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? Because now you've come face to face with your absolute something. In order for you to live this life, you can't live it without having an absolute. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So the absolute is either going to be your own self or it's going to be his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God is teaching us to let go of self. We don't want to lift up self. We will not have anything to do with this idol of self. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to lift up myself above the word. &gt;&gt; Who brought you into this life? Who gave you life? Who gave you breath? &gt;&gt; You didn't have any choice coming into it. You don't have any choice whether you're sitting here this morning. God brought you here to hear this word. Now, it depends what you want to do with it. It can either be accepted or it can be denied. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'll tell you what, if you're a seed of God, I don't care what you do, you cannot deny what these scriptures are saying. &gt;&gt; It's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "You did not choose me." Verse chapter 15. I chose you &gt;&gt; and ordained you that you should bring forth fruit and the fruit would be my life manifested in its season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. [snorts] Where did I leave off here? Verse seven. Oh, verse eight. Wherein wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence. He's abounded toward us, having made known unto us the mystery of his will. See, that's what he's opening to us here this morning. The mystery of godliness, which is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; It's not Christ in a future, Christ in the in the past. &gt;&gt; We're speaking of a Christ that was, which is, and shall come. &gt;&gt; And we're speaking of a believer in Christ, which is, which was, and shall come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, it's having made known unto us the mystery. It's an unveiled mystery. When he called to your heart, when he brought the message in this day to your heart, the veil dropped away and a mystery that was hidden all along. It's now open to you. You didn't realize that you were in him before the foundation of the world. You didn't realize you were chosen. God's revealing the mystery of himself because he placed himself, positioned himself in you for this day and for the water of his own word by the spirit to fall on you and water that seed and bring that seed what was in it to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I said in the beginning was the word. I say there you were and the word was with God. There you were. And the word was God. There you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; That's right. All right. So, verse 10, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times. How many believe we're in the dis that dispensation? &gt;&gt; We've come to that position. We've come to the fullness of times. We've come to that because the opening of the seal denoted we've arrived at the end. Time is fading out. Time is blending with eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're at the end. We've arrived. &gt;&gt; We know it. We see the signs everywhere pointing. We are at the end. Judgment is beginning to take a hold everywhere. Amen. The the the council of churches is forming that council, that confederation, a mark to the of image to the beast. We see it. We see it everywhere. We see that that that that confederation becoming political strong, taking control of every nation right now, right before us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're seeing God's word being fulfilled. And God will absolutely fulfill every word. That should be our absolute. And the one that wrote the word, the one the word speaks of is in us. For me to live is Christ. &gt;&gt; And to die is gain. Listen, when you're in Christ, Christ identified and revealed in you. It's a win-win situation for for me to live as Christ and to die is gain &gt;&gt; for my living here. Let me magnify him. Let me magnify him. Whether it be by life or death, I will magnify him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That should be our That should be our focus. That should be where we focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. That should be our focus. God has delivered you from the effects and the struggles of this flesh. He's already set you free. If you'll just embrace what he's saying to you here, that it's Christ you're free. He who the Son hath made free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; Not a problem of, well, I might slip back. No, you're not going to slip anywhere. If he chose you in himself, there's only one way you're going to go. He'll bring you to himself. No matter what it takes, he'll bring you to that recognition of what you are in your position &gt;&gt; because he maturing a bride. What for? The rapture, the body change. He's maturing us. He's bringing us right up. That's why the message was sent was for the going home of this little bride. The going home. What are we speaking of here? Who is this predestinated? It's his elect. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He chose them. He elected them. It wasn't say, "Well, God just said by a whim, I'll take this and that one." No, it was what he knew. It was faith in him. He knew you. He absolutely knew you. You were existing in him before the world began. And and in order to keep you and hold you, he gave you a shot of predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. A vac a vaccination. You want to know about a real vaccination? &gt;&gt; When he chose you and himself, he predestinated you to adoption. &gt;&gt; And that's an immunity from anything else that could keep you out of that placing. Nothing could keep you out of that placing. For me to live is Christ. I'm talking about the birth word in you. I'm talking about Jesus Christ, the new birth revealed in you. It's in you. &gt;&gt; Your leadership is in you. &gt;&gt; It's not off somewhere. If I could just grab it out here. No, it's in you. He wants you to trust him. That's what we're talking about. The bottom line here is that we are being tested and tried. We are being taught and learned how to obey, how to lean on and depend on him alone. &gt;&gt; Because we're t he's talking, bringing you to your position, bringing you to who you are, showing you this is where you stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; All right. My All right. So, in the dispensation of the fullness of times, you remember in St. John, remember over there in St. John 14 20 at that day Jesus said at that day you'll know that I'm in the father me I in you and you in me at that day the revelation would come that I'm in you and you are in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that this is that not our day? &gt;&gt; We had a prophet say this this is our day. Listen, when I say a prophet said, I'm talking about a perfect interpretation of the word that God said he would through every age bring through a prophet for the hour and the day. He had to bring the perfect interpretation of the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; And we and we know we have that perfect interpretation by God divinely vindicated it to be his own word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're not taking somebody else's idea, somebody else's thought. Because the Jesus, the Lord has said himself said, "I will do nothing unless I first reveal what I'm to do by my my secrets of the what I'm doing to a prophet." That's what he said. Amos 3:7, I will do nothing, but I reveal my secrets first to my prophets. &gt;&gt; That's right. And we're not looking at just a whim of a man that just happened to step by here and and and proclaimed himself that. know God stood behind him and vindicated that this was the hour that we have an opened word. The the seal that hid the mystery of that book which you are and I am has been unveiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. The mystery of God would be revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John saw it open, but he only saw a symbol. But it couldn't be revealed until the message of the seventh angel. Revelations 10. All right, let's get back here. So, in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together. I'm bringing that to you because he said in this day, brother Brandham said, "This day is that day that Jesus spoke of in St. John 14:20. In that day, you'll know." It's not something you'll imagine. It's something you'll know. Faith is not an imagination. Faith is not something I hope I get. Faith is what's been promised to you and then revealed to you. It becomes an actual substance. It's what you know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the scripture said here, you're going to know. Jesus said you'll know in that day that it's I and you and you and me. &gt;&gt; Or you could say it's I and him and him and me. Either one. It's unveiled to you. &gt;&gt; The veil's been taken away. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your heart's been turned. You see that word birthed inside of you. And God told us how it would be birthed. He told us how to be birthed. When you hear the word and realize what Jesus Christ did for you, he said, "Then repent. Turn around. You see that you're an heir. Turn around. The blood was shed for you. You realize it. He paid the penalty on Calvary for all your sin and you repent of it. Then you're baptized in water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for your remission of sins, for the past sins to be remitted. If you'll receive that the way the prophet said it, and you repent thoroughly knowing and testifying before the people that you believe what Jesus Christ did for you was for you, he paid the penalty. He sent his blood. He paid and washed you freely. And you've accepted that. And you you're willing to testify, I when he died, I died with him. when he rose, I rose with him. That's what baptism and water says. You're not saved by baptis. You're not saved by water. You're saved by faith in that blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That did that. You're only showing outwardly what you believe. And if you'll do that, the Bible said, he said, "I shall give you shall receive the gift of eternal life." You receive the gift of God, &gt;&gt; which is eternal life. Amen. Amen. That is what constitutes the new birth. Water, blood, spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so you know how you're going to be. That's what Peter said, Dr. Peter on the day of Pentecost when they said, "What must we do?" He said, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; And without the Holy Ghost, you'll never understand what God had for you. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; So, the first step you need to take is not try to figure things out. Just get him in you. Let him come in. You realize the first step you need to take &gt;&gt; and take it. &gt;&gt; And if you believe it, you'll take it. &gt;&gt; It won't be because I like someone or I want to pretend like I'm a believer. I want to I want to be like because I'm attracted to somebody. No, you do it because in your heart you know what he did for you and you're willing to to publicly display that &gt;&gt; by taking his name in baptism &gt;&gt; that I am a believer &gt;&gt; and I recognize my sins were were covered were were emitted by the omitted by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you shall receive the gift of himself to come and live in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he will lead you into all truth. He will open the word to you and lead you &gt;&gt; and guide you. When he, the spirit of truth, has come, he will lead you into all truth. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no reason to just be a put on and well and be pretend to be. No. No. We're not here to pretend nothing. &gt;&gt; We're here to either be real or forget about it. &gt;&gt; No reason to try to pretend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not make believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Either you're a real believer and have met the person of Christ himself or you haven't. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I was raised in the message." That won't save you. I come to church. That won't save you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to meet the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. The new birth is nothing else but Jesus Christ himself unveiled in you. Why? Because his seed was in your soul. &gt;&gt; A lot of people can have a mental conception. They can say, "I believe God. I believe God." "Well, how do you know?" Because he said, "Well, how do you know?" &gt;&gt; Well, my mom said, "So, how do you know?" &gt;&gt; You don't know. You're taking somebody else's word for it. You're taking You can even take the scriptures. But until you know him who wrote these scriptures, you'll never know what's hid behind these scriptures. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because this is the love letter sent to his people, his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. I thought I'd just drop that in. Okay. Now, so we find that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, or other words, in this day, &gt;&gt; that he might gather together in one all things in Christ. Where is he gathering them? &gt;&gt; In Christ. &gt;&gt; He would have to be a message then to be sent to us to gather us and positionally place us in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then both which are in both the he both which are in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. that we should be that we should be to the praise of the glory of praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ. Amen. Embrace it. Take a hold of it. Don't run from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is speaking to your heart this morning, saints. Embrace what I've said. Don't run from it. Quit your running and turn around and start running where you ought to be running for the goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your feelings. Quit looking at your mistakes and realize that I've chosen you in myself. I've called you. I positioned you. I've revealed myself in you. Now go forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go forward. There's only one salvation that's in Christ. There's only one deliverance that's in him. Amen. Nothing else. No. You don't have your your your your hope set on some preacher, some church. Nonsense. Let go of it. You've got to meet Christ. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "For me to live is Christ and die is gain." And Christ was Paul's absolute. I'm talking about now if it was Paul's absolute and Paul's my brother, it's my absolute. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about Paul was my brother in Christ. Paul had the same life I live. Paul, we were bloodrelated. I say not blood natural, blood spiritual. We were bloodrelated. Royal blood. And he said, "Christ is my life." I say, "Christ is my life." How many will agree with me? Christ is my life. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about not me, you too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so he said that he said because of this, he said he was bold. That bold he was fearless. He was confidence. He was plain. He was open. He was frank. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; With all boldness. I'm not ashamed to say that Christ is my life. I'm not ashamed to declare that my position, my hold in this hour, contrary to human intelligence, contrary to the intelligence of the world, Christ is my life. There's my absolute. That's my living. That's where I live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, I'm here. And the purpose of that, he said, I'm here to magnify Christ. It's what he said. He said to magnify him with all boldness as always. So now Christ shall be magnified in my body. Other words, Christ is going to be enlarged. He's going to make himself great. He's going to be declared great in my body. Is that your focus? &gt;&gt; That should be that's my focus every day. Lord, let me be that witness. Let me be the witness. Let me be the very life of Christ manifested in flesh. For I believe that's what I am. I believe every member of the body is what they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God manifested through clay today. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; It's a place where you're tied to something. Amen. We're we're passing through the deepest water it's been in the last 2,000 years. A very treacherous time. More mental problems now, but brother Brown was here. It was more physical. Now it's mental. Everywhere you turn, it's a mental problem. Something mental going on. You know why? Because Satan is more deceptive than have ever been. He can work with feelings. He can work with those emotions and make you think you've got it. But unless Christ himself is revealed in you, you've met him face to face. You don't have it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. I'm going to be very frank with you. You say, "How can you say that?" Because I know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's others that know it. &gt;&gt; And he's calling on you. someone here. Amen. And we're all learning to lean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're all learning to come to a place of dependency where we will not lift. I don't want to lift up. I don't want to make myself an idol. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's nothing to do with David. Nothing to do with you. It's all him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he chose. He said, "I'll come and live in you and I'll be your shepherd." You don't have to question where the shepherd's leading. He just said, "Follow me. Deny yourself daily. Take up your cross and follow me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Deny yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't lift up yourself more. Deny your own thinking. Deny your own understanding. Let go of your understanding. Don't lead to your understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in all thy ways acknowledge him. Him where? Him and you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Deny. Don't deny him. Take it. Embrace him. He's perfect in all of his ways. He can't be anything else but perfect. His leadership is perfect. You don't have to question his leadership. When you know him, let go and let him then lead you. Let him guide you. Let him lead you contrary to your human thinking. Let him lead you contrary to what you understand humanly. &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; But when you know him, that's the case. That's what we're talking about this morning is know him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must know him. It's not to know about him. It's not theology. It's not an intellectual conception about him. To know him is life. Not to know about him. To know him is life. &gt;&gt; That's right. To know him. It becomes a Christ centered life. Then your life is Christ centered. Everything rotates around him. Not everything not everything rotating around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not his word rotating on what you think. It's what you putting your con your confidence in him in you &gt;&gt; because as I said the to be fixed to have my heart fixed it means my heart is confident steadfast my heart is established it's settled it's at rest it's firm &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; so my heart my heart is fixed my heart is firm I'm at peace I've entered into rest I've ceased David has ceased from his own labors How many can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; You're ceased. You're ceased. &gt;&gt; Feed on the word. How do you grow? How do you grow more deeper into fellowship with God? Feed upon his word. &gt;&gt; Ask him to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, how does faith come? Faith. Without faith, it's impossible to please him. And how's the believer walking? By his faith. It's not our faith. It's his faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul, he said, had to meet Jesus one day on the road to Damascus. He said, "For me to live as Christ, Christ was Paul's absolute." It was his typost. It was his. It was the end of all arguments. It was Christ was his typost. &gt;&gt; Where's your tiepost this morning? &gt;&gt; Where are you tied to? &gt;&gt; Are you tied to your intellectual education, your understanding, or where are you tied? Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you tied to what feels best or reasoning? No. We're looking beyond that. &gt;&gt; We're looking at what he said. Amen. Amen. And what he said is what he meant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Except you become as a little child, you be converted. That's to be birthed. That's to be changed. Except you be converted, then become. &gt;&gt; Then you grow up, become something. You become dependent upon him as a little child would be. It's not you the big one. It's not you the great one. There's no big ones. There's no There's no great ones. There's no little ones. There's no big ones in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't care if position is a housewife position. Your positions given to you by God is just as great as an apostle, a prophet or a preacher. Any preachers don't mean anything. Don't you get yourself fixiated on a preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're people. A lot of preachers could preach like a house of fire and preach well very anointed and then slide back and leave the Lord. &gt;&gt; We've known it. &gt;&gt; But see, they didn't know him. That's the thing. They didn't know him. They were gifted. But a gift is given to you without repentance. A gift is what you're born with. &gt;&gt; You can't depend on a gift. &gt;&gt; You depend on the person. It must be the word himself in you. &gt;&gt; It's got to be living. It's got to come off of the page of just a rema. It's got to be the thought that God thought in this word revealed to you by one person that's himself. &gt;&gt; Your typost is not your feelings. Your typost is not what others say about you. Your typost is not in a church. And brother, sister, what's happening today? The ministry, what's happening? We're are we are we and I say we not only preachers, I'm talking about every individual in the body of Christ. You have a ministry. What are you doing with it? Are you feeding it? Are you are you relying upon God to take you out there and be a lifegiving source to someone else? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's only one way the life of God can come through and that's through his body. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why our last commission was go into the world and preach the gospel. The housewife preaches it. Not only the the the the teenage preaches it, you've met him. What are you doing with this? Are we getting the people to Christ? Are you getting them to a church, a sensation, an emotion? What are we getting the people to? &gt;&gt; Are we bringing them to the word or what are we bringing them to? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are we leading them to? &gt;&gt; What are what is our witness of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I say, let him be magnified in me, Lord. magnify yourself in me. &gt;&gt; Let my life testify. &gt;&gt; And it's not something you have to work up and make up. You have to figure out. Just get in love with him. Get a love relationship with him. He'll take care of the rest of it. You'll just deliver yourself into his hands as a loving as a loving husband, a loving father, and then he'll take care of the rest of it. He'll lead you and he'll guide you according to his understanding, &gt;&gt; according to his faith, according to his word. &gt;&gt; He's not going to lead you contrary to the word. The Holy Ghost can't come in you and then take you away from his word. &gt;&gt; His word is the believer's absolute and that word becomes alive in you. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just being having an anointing on on your spirit. It's the anointing on the word. It has to anoint the word. And you're going to recognize, you're going to hear, you're going to receive the word of promise for this season. You're going to see it. It's impossible for you not to. &gt;&gt; And if you don't see him working in your life and and and leading you and guiding you into truth, unveiling himself into you, I would say, Lord, fill me. &gt;&gt; Fill me with yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's one thing I'm here for, and that's to magnify you. I'm here to to display your love. I'm here to project your love &gt;&gt; to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not an ailial love, not a human love, but a godly love that'll receive and and accept and live the word for the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It goes beyond agape love is is is himself. It goes beyond a friendship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And nothing wrong with a brotherly kind. We'd have to have that. I'm not speaking against that. But we've got to go to a higher love yet. &gt;&gt; We've got to go to the person Christ living in you &gt;&gt; that will acknowledge the truth, willing to correct, willing to love, willing to show life. And you can't, as I said, you can't make that up. You can't manufacture that. It's going to be lived automatically through you. &gt;&gt; Just know him. &gt;&gt; This is not a church affair. This this is not this message is not it's a it's a relationship. It's a oneness. It's a marriage. &gt;&gt; It's a union with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not what I know. It's not how I've been raised. &gt;&gt; You're going to end up in the deep end one of these days. You've got to have a new birth. &gt;&gt; I don't hear many preachers tell about that anymore. Well, you're hearing it now. &gt;&gt; You must be born again. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother, sister, if I was a young lady and a young man, I wouldn't receive nobody but what is born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They must be born again. And it's got to be displayed through their life without them working it up. &gt;&gt; How many say amen to that? &gt;&gt; All right. You better believe it. Don't you accept nothing else until that life is manifested in you &gt;&gt; and you see that life living. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's got to be a union of fellowship here. If there isn't, either you don't have it, they don't have it. Neither one of you may have the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost in you will be a discerner. The Holy Ghost in you won't be tied up with something that's contrary to the will of God and the word of God. Amen. How can two walk together lest it be agreed? And Bible said, how how can there how can you come? How's that say that? I'm off my line just a moment. But how don't be unequally yolked &gt;&gt; with unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That still stands today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That still stands. You're going to have problems. You're really going to have problems if you try to yoke yourself up with an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a problem. The best thing to do is just follow the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, there's got to be a final typos. There has to be an ultimate. An ultimate is the last word. There's got to be something in your life that is the last word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Got to be. [snorts] &gt;&gt; All right. So we got to realize this is Christ living in you. [snorts] Yeah. He had to meet Jesus face to face. Paul did. And he cut loose from his Phariseeic typos and retied himself again to Jesus who he knew who he knowed was crucified, died, and rose again. How did Paul know he rose again? He knew it because he met the person. So how could he meet the person if he wasn't risen? Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see what? See what's been said here. Paul knew it because he met the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Met him right on the road to Damascus. &gt;&gt; Said, "Who are you, Lord?" He knew that pillar of fire was the Lord. He knew the Lord was leading in that pillar of fire. He knew that was the Lord. And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" He said, the Lord said to him, "You're persecuting me, &gt;&gt; Paul. You're persecuting me because I'm in flesh in believers. You're persecuting me. &gt;&gt; Then who am I that's who who is it that's being persecuted? Who are you, Lord? You just said, "I'm persecuting you." Who Who are you, Lord? &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you, his answer wasn't the second person in the Godhead either. It was the person himself. He said, "I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest." &gt;&gt; The Lord said, "I'm Jesus who died for you." The Lord said, "I'm Jesus who redeemed you through my blood." The Lord said, &gt;&gt; "Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is I and I live in these people, &gt;&gt; and I'm being witness to you, these people, and you're coming against me." My That shake me up. It shook Paul up because then he turned right around and sent a little minister, prophet down there and said, "You'll meet a man called Saul and you're to baptize him." He's repented and re baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ. And when that took place, Paul was on fire. He received the gift of the Holy Ghost. It settled right in him. That which was predestinated see become alive. &gt;&gt; You couldn't shut up Paul if he tried. In fact, he said, "I know I'm going to Jerusalem to be persecuted and and and there's chains and and prison awaiting me, but I could care less about that. I'm here to fulfill my calling. I'm here to do what the Lord said do. And none of those things mean anything to me. I don't even count my life, my own life. I don't even count it. I count it as stubble. I count it as nothing to fulfill my portion that God gave me in himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Amen. So Paul was converted. Praise the Lord. He came face to face. If you want to find that, let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 4. I'm going to rush through this now real quick. Philippian I mean 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and we'll find what this birth is if you want to know. Amen. Verse 6 of chapter 4. 2 Corinthians 4:6. This is what he meant. For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness. Was not that his spoken word let there be light. Is that right? Then what's Paul speaking of? The God who spoke the word. The original seed who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts. Has it shined in your heart? &gt;&gt; And if it shone in your heart, it's for one purpose of showing it. It was to give you the light of the knowledge of the glory of God. So now you are his glory because he shined and they gave knowledge of what's been a hidden as a mystery there. It's to give the glory of God in the face of someone, in the presence of someone. And that presence and in that face was Jesus Christ. That's why Paul in 2 Corinthians chapter 3:18 said, "Now we all with open face, &gt;&gt; beholding as a glass, we behold who we are. We're beholding our position. We're beholding the glory of God." Amen. Because that face has been opened. Whose face? His face. And I've come face to face. And when when he opened his face, I realized that was me, &gt;&gt; mama. That's me. &gt;&gt; I'm seeing this in the mirror. This is me. My face has been opened. Paul met him face to face. He didn't meet a He didn't meet a a a feeling. He met a person. &gt;&gt; And I wonder how many here have met the person. &gt;&gt; I'm not judging you. I'm just speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've met it, so be it. You yourself know that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you've got to meet the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to meet this one who spoke the word. That spoken word was original seed. You've got to meet him. &gt;&gt; You've got to meet him face to face. He's got to come in you. And you hear your face. His face is open to you and you realize that's my face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For Christ who is our life shall appear. &gt;&gt; Then we shall appear with him in glory. That's just exactly what that scripture said. The glory of God is revealed to you. And when you looked in the mirror, 2 Corinthians 3:18, with that open face, you looked in the mirror, you saw the glory of God. Brother Brandham said this. He said when he looked in the mirror, he said, he said that mirror reflects his Jesus Christ. And the glory, he said, you receive you re you you see the glory of God, which is Jesus Christ. And and the bride and brother Bram said the bride is the glory is the glory of him. &gt;&gt; And the glory of Jesus Christ is his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you're seeing yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've come to yourself. You're [snorts] being changed now into the same image from revelation from glory to glory. That's what it's all about. All right. on a message this well I don't Yeah and why people are so tossed about Paul said to me to live is Christ and die is gain not me that liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in me life is gone it's Christ living in you amen that old man anymore that old man that was your husband is dead eternally separated from him. He's died. And don't try to don't try to to dig him up and become alive here again. Just leave him dead. &gt;&gt; He's dead. He's separated. You become alive in Christ. You were always were his. &gt;&gt; Amen. Always. Let's embrace that this morning. You're not not me that liveth anymore, but Christ that liveth in me. Christ living in the individual. So surrendered when Christ speaks through their lips. I'm talking about the individual. Christ speaks through the lips. He thinks because he's in you. He speaks. He He thinks through the mind. Sees through the eye. Now watch. He acts through your temperament. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't like my temperament. But if you're born child of God, then just quit making excuses of what you don't like and how he made you and accept the fact and give yourself to God and let him live through your temperament. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let him work through your temperament. Amen. He's going to work through your temperament. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people don't like my temperament. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if you don't like it, but he made me thus. A lot of people didn't like John the Baptist's temperament. They didn't like Jesus when he braided whips and went in there and the Bible and the prophet said and he looked and the Bible said he looked on him with anger. &gt;&gt; They didn't like his temperament. Oh, that's not love. That was love. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it was love. When he went around 2,000 people and went to a man that was crippled for many, many years and left all the lame, the halt, the blind, the the poor children, everything else laying there. They didn't think that was love. &gt;&gt; But God obeyed what Jesus obeyed what the father sent him to do. That's love. &gt;&gt; Amen. It isn't it isn't I believe in in human uh sympathy, but here we saw the sympathy of God when he obeyed what God said do. And when he shows you what to do, you're not answering to your church. You're not answering to a pastor. You're answering to God. You do what he shows you to do and reveals it. And if it's a true revelation and you act upon that, that thought that's revealed to you and put it in a word, then the word of God has never failed in the mouth of true believers. And it's becoming stronger and more mighty and more unveiled as we go along here &gt;&gt; that it's happening just exactly all right. &gt;&gt; So he works through your temperament. &gt;&gt; The things of the world's passed away. How can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time? He's not talking about sweet and pleasant out here. It may not be sweet and pleasant. Your feelings may not be sweet and pleasant. forget those things and realize what's in your soul is sweet and pleasant. &gt;&gt; The just shall live by his faith. So what is the believer? What is the believer today? What is this believer? The believer is the faith of God that moves in you. &gt;&gt; What is the believer? The believer is the faith of God. God's own faith. Substance faith. revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That moves in you. &gt;&gt; That's the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a makebeliever. It's a genuine believer. &gt;&gt; The faith of God. First John 5:4 said, "We overcome the world." And what is the victory that overcometh the world? Even our faith. &gt;&gt; That's the believer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Our faith, our revelation of God. Psalm 62:6 said, "God is my rock. I shall not be moved." I'm Yeah. I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; When God is your revelation, how can it be moved? &gt;&gt; When God is in you, Satan can't come and get it out of you. &gt;&gt; God's unveiled himself in you. You're sealed to the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; Embrace it, people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you know that, and I've just read the scriptures, he he chose you in him. Is that real to you? Is that a revelation to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Where were you before that? You had to be in eternity to be a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; And there's only one form of eternal life, and that's God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Right. So, this is our victory. The spirit of God, the real you is the spirit of God in you. That's the real you. I'm not talking about who you aren't. This is what Satan wants to point you to. But the real you is in that third realm, that third circle inside of that heart. That's the real you. &gt;&gt; You remember, brother Brandham, he's he made mention how that how that science had found out there's a little room in the compartment of the heart, human heart, that doesn't even have a cell. And they said it was the place of the soul. &gt;&gt; And so the prophet comes along and he begins to build on that. Why would he build on something like that? Because it was truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. He he he said he said when God made man, he made him thus. For he made this little certain compartment in the man for his own throne, the control tower. God wants to lead man, but man wants to lead himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what's always getting in the way. &gt;&gt; There's a battle all the time because your carnal self wants to lead you. And you weren't given that to be led by. You are given faith to be led by faith in what? Faith takes its resting place in the word of God. It will be unmovable out of that word. Genuine faith. God's faith will not be moved out of the word. &gt;&gt; It won't leave the word. &gt;&gt; All right. See, so God wants to lead man. So he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart. Yes. &gt;&gt; Man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes. That's where he's deceived. That's where Satan deceived Eve by what she could see. Amen. All right. But sons and daughters are led by the spirit of God. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, so that is called that is called a little inside of the inside. Medical science found little compartment in the heart of a human being. See, and what are we concerned? What are we dealing with here? A little room. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A little compartment. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we find out that God's tented somewhere today. He's tented in his in his body. He's tented in you. He's bedded. He bedded himself inside of you so that he could come and live inside of you. &gt;&gt; Where did he bed that? Where did he plant that seed? In your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it took the water of life for the season to speak. You were called by spoken word. You're birthed by spoken word. It had to quicken. That water came when you come in contact with this message which you're coming in contact today. I'm preaching to you this message. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you come in contact with that, there's got to be something in your heart that says it can say amen. And you recognize it waters that and it brings forth what? It can't bring forth another. It's got to bring forth himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That seed can't be if it's a if it's a word seed, it's got to produce the word. If it's God's seed, it has to produce him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. [snorts] So, we realize then we're the inside of the inside is what we're speaking of. The outer man is flesh. The inner man is spirit. We're a spirit being. If you take the spirit out of me, you could you could be you could even be sitting here without your spirit. You you I could kick you. I could move you. I could slap you. and everything else you'd never move. &gt;&gt; You're dead. &gt;&gt; That spirit person that you are is left. But inside that spirit, God planted something. And either you have that typost, that word, or you don't have the word. It's either faith or doubt that guides you. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the soul. That's that third realm. The realm of the soul. that compartment that we're speaking of, that little room that you go through the blood, by the blood, go into and you meet him. You've got to meet him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say, "Well, I I just I just I'll just work it up. I'll work it up. I'll pump it up." No, you won't pump up nothing. You can't pump up nothing by God. He either chose you or he didn't. &gt;&gt; And you know that because there's something in your heart that you can't explain, but you know it's the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I say pursue it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let go of it. Let go of that self that's standing in your way because Satan won't point you to that. He won't point you to that word. No, he'll point you away from that. [snorts] Okay, this is what he said here. Let me get here just something now. So that little second realm there, that's mind. That's a mind realm. That's a mind. That's where the battle's fought. &gt;&gt; It's called spirit. So if I could ever get, he said, "Now the mind reasons and your mind reasons all the time. It's reasoning." &gt;&gt; All right? Your mind reasons, but the heart doesn't reason. All right. Just it just believes it. If I could ever get drive that home to one of my audience, I'd have a real healing service. If I could ever get my audience to see that it's not what your heart think. Excuse me. It's not what your head thinks at all. &gt;&gt; There's where the devil abides, but he reasons it out. I'm sick. You reason. You He reasons it. You reason it with him. I'm sick. I can't get well. I got this. I can't be saved. I'm this. I'm that. I'm something else. I'm down. I'm this. &gt;&gt; I say, what are we saying? &gt;&gt; Are we confessing what the word says about you, or are we confessing what our feeling says? What's the word say about you? He said you're perfect. You're complete in him. &gt;&gt; The word says you're complete in him. &gt;&gt; Now, watch what? Watch this. You were all pre-planned by God. Nothing happens by chance &gt;&gt; with God. He knows all about it. It's all pre-planned. Planned for many generations back so you could be here this morning. &gt;&gt; Also, he said on a message called letting off the pressure. That's what God's trying to get you to do today. You're going to be under pressure, but you have a pressure place of pressure release that you can commit these things to God. Let go of it and let him take care of it. He's got a plan and a purpose. He would see everything that happens. Now, let me read this first and I'm trying to I'm trying to close. I haven't even have to touch my sermon here. He said there's there's where the devil he said, now let me get back over here. He said this in learn lifting letting off the pressure. He said nothing happens by chance. Everything is ordained by God. No matter what happens. &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking to? Who's going to believe that? &gt;&gt; When your whole being says it's contrary to it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Nothing happens by chance. Everything is ordained by God. No matter what happens, all things are going to work together for good &gt;&gt; to them that love God, to them that are called. Now, that's a specific that's a focused call. &gt;&gt; What he said this morning, he's calling his elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there is a general call that goes all over the world. Many are called But few are chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're one of the chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say you are because the word says you are. And if you can accept it, you are. &gt;&gt; If you can believe it, you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you really believe it, it'll work. &gt;&gt; It'll move. It's moving in you. &gt;&gt; It's working in you. &gt;&gt; It's operating in you. &gt;&gt; You're the word for the day living. You're the promise of the day manifested. So he said all things work together for good. So there's nothing out of cater. Nothing happens by chance. Everything is ordained by God. No matter what it is. &gt;&gt; It has to go over God's desk. It has to be okayed for you. &gt;&gt; You're his child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're under his command. You're under his control. Then that ought to be enough right there to let off the pressure. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the pressure come? Because you're trying to reason things out. The pressure is no pressure in saying, "Lord, this is your word." &gt;&gt; Go back to the word. I take the word as a little child. I don't have to. That's my daddy. He said so. I'm not trying to work it out. I have no premonitions of how it ought to be. I just accept it. &gt;&gt; Daddy said so. That settles it. &gt;&gt; Well, how do you know daddy said so? Now you're expressed. Now you're expressed in this hour after the word has come in you. What are you expressed for? To light up this age. You are expressing God's life in you. Because you are a son and daughter of God. Therefore, you get what I mean. See, you are now made. You're sitting in this church this morning because your duty is to express God to this nation, this people, and the neighborhood where you associate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the focus. &gt;&gt; Do we hear the sheep bleeding? Bleeding. Do you hear the lambs bleeding? Who's going to answer them? &gt;&gt; Who's going to hear their call? Amen. &gt;&gt; The elect of God have the answer to their blading. &gt;&gt; Little ones, old ones. The sheep are calling. &gt;&gt; Who's going to answer them? It'll be the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, lay down your figure. I've got some things I want to share and then I'm closed. I haven't just I'm just trying to hit just exactly wherever you are. God knew you would be here right where you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's ordered it. He's planned it. There's only one thing to do. Let go and let him lead you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? Just let go and let him lead you. &gt;&gt; St. John 1 John 4:4 said, "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is in you? This is a question to you this morning. What is in you that's greater? &gt;&gt; It's Christ, &gt;&gt; the anointed one. &gt;&gt; God that was in Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; All God was, he poured into Christ. All Christ was, he poured into the church. Is that right? All God was, he poured into Christ. All Christ was. Then all what was all Christ? God. God had bodily was in one man. Is that right? God paid for your sin. God shed his blood for you. God did. &gt;&gt; Who's taken the book in this hour? God did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He stepped forth. What? God did. A lion took your place. Yes. &gt;&gt; Was become manifest as a lamb. Took your place today. Took the book, opened the seals and unveiled who you are &gt;&gt; and your position and set you in order for a body change. &gt;&gt; Nothing could do it unless that book was open because that book contained the mystery of who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. All right. So then God was in Christ as in you. Greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Now watch this. Then if he's in you, &gt;&gt; same today. Then if he's in you, &gt;&gt; this ought to just rejoice you. Then it's not you anymore living. &gt;&gt; It's him living in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a consolation. &gt;&gt; My heart is fixed. My heart is fixed. It's him living in you. Not him living anymore. Not me. Excuse me. Not you living anymore. It's him living in you. [snorts] So, church of the living God, get to your feet. Believe him with all that's in you. Hold to that little wheel in the middle of the wheel. Let it stabilize every move, every motion that you make, every thought that you have. May it be controlled by this tower. The name of the Lord is a mighty tower. The righteous run into it and are safe. Where's the name of the Lord then? in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the tower is on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Because God is is sitting right in his word in this hour. God is sitting where? He's sitting right in his word. &gt;&gt; Christ's in you. &gt;&gt; The word living. Christ is right here in his word in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are his word living. &gt;&gt; And not only living, it's living and operative. It's in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] See, because God is sitting right in his word in this hour in the evening light showing forth the light. Then I say, we'll walk in the light. Right. &gt;&gt; So I say to the bride as he said and he said this morning arise shine &gt;&gt; thy light is come. &gt;&gt; Thy light not your neighbors yours individual. We're not talking about groups here this morning. We are talking God is speaking to individuals. I don't care what your age is. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've been wondering. You've been questioning. He's given you the answers. Quit worrying about how he made you. Worried about trying to copy, compare yourself with others. Quit doing that. &gt;&gt; He made you the way he made you. His life is revealed in you. Give yourself up to him. Let him use you through the temperament and the way he makes you. &gt;&gt; And say, "God, forgive me for finding fault with the way you made me." &gt;&gt; Just be who you are. And if something's off the word, then he's the discerner. He'll show you. And if you're a real believer, you'll answer that call and change. &gt;&gt; You'll make correction. I say, "Thank you, Lord, for correcting me every day." Correcting me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd say, "Thank you, Lord, because I know you love me." And his love is corrective. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I spoke this morning. He said on Sunday on the wheel, in the middle of the wheel, he said, "Hold to that little motion, that little wheel." Amen. Inside the heart, that little room, my heart is fixed. Amen. I won't go over that now. Let me just come back to this and I'm I'm going to share something and we're done. All right. I'm thankful I started a little early. Thank you, brother Alex, for doing that because I know that that made a difference. All right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; We realize then with him and us that all that you and all that I am is in him. All that you are Lord and all that I am is in him. What is it? Words. What am I in him? Words. It's the word. He said, "We're witnesses of the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. We're witnesses of the word. Now, Matthew 24:35 said, and I'm going to back this up in the heavens and heavens and earth shall pass away, &gt;&gt; but my words, what are we in him? Words, &gt;&gt; but my words shall not pass away. The prophet said, "If you be that word written in that scripture, you cannot pass away either." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So in so heaven and earth will pass away, but my words, he living in his words today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's living and operating in his word. &gt;&gt; Are you one of them? &gt;&gt; For me to live is Christ. &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say your heart's fixed?" because it's revealed to me &gt;&gt; and I am not responsible anything else but to preach to you what's inspired and revealed. &gt;&gt; What you do with it's up to you. I'm not responsible for that. I'm not responsible for you getting it. I'm only responsible for bringing it. &gt;&gt; But it's the truth. They're words and we are witnesses of that word. Amen. If we go over here and I'll go over here real quick to first John 15 or five, excuse me, [snorts] and verse 10 or verse verse yeah 10. For he that believeth on the son of God hath the witness in himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of his son. And if he gave a certain record to his son, he's given it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is the record he that this is the record that God hath given to us is eternal life. And this life is in his son. and he that hath the son. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you what Paul said about that in Galatians. You don't have to turn, but Galatians 1:16. I've read it many times here, and we'll see what he said. Paul said this, "When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace." Amen. He was called. He was specifically called. &gt;&gt; He responded to that call, didn't he? He said, "What for?" When he called me by his grace to reveal &gt;&gt; his son in me that I might preach him among the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood. So what was it? The the son was revealed in Paul. As I said, he met him face to face. The son became alive in him. And he that hath the son hath life. Amen. So here again, for me to live is Christ. That's your focus, bride. &gt;&gt; That's your focus. Amen. You [snorts] are his witness then. And all he is and all he was, I am. And all that I am, he was. That's not a cliche. That's in a message called unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "All that he was and all that he is, I am &gt;&gt; being born of him. All that record living in me, unveiled in me, and all that I am, he was." &gt;&gt; My, what a place to stand. As I said, you're standing. You [snorts] and God become one. He is in you. You're in him. Amen. And now you see it. You've got a typost. You've got an absolute. And your absolute is unlimited in its power. Your absolute is perfect in itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's our typos. For me to live is my absolute. for me to live is Christ unlimited in his power. &gt;&gt; An absolute the final word, the amen. What [snorts] a beautiful thing it is to lay your life in his hands and say, "Here am I, Lord. Just use me now. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Lead me, guide me, and direct me in what? In the way that would be pleasing unto thee. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And then don't murmur. No matter what the path is, &gt;&gt; stay with it anyhow, &gt;&gt; and God will work it. All right. The footsteps of a good man or of the righteous is ordered by the Lord. &gt;&gt; Galatians 2:20 said, "I'm crucified with Christ." How may say, "Amen." That's the truth. I'm crucified with Christ. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. [snorts] And the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God. who loved me and gave himself. Can you catch the photo here? The picture. He gave himself for you. His seed, his predestinated, his choice, his elect. He gave himself for you. How many? I pray you'll receive it. Amen. All right. We don't have to worry, hurry. We don't have to hurry and scuffle and act like the rest of the world. Quieten down. What's the matter with the Christian? The spirit of the world today is neurotic. But that's not the spirit of Christ. Did you ever see him get excited about something? Now, we're talking about him in you. But what are we to do? Bringing every thought captive to that Christ in you. There's where the battle lays. Amen. That's the battle. It's fighting you every day because you have a part of yourself that's the word and the other part is carnal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they're constantly at a warfare. But who's going to win? &gt;&gt; Which one chief feeds the most? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So it's Christ is your absolute. Christ is your portion. Christ is the measure. &gt;&gt; Bringing every thought under obedience to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not under obedience to your feelings, obedience to Christ. If you let go and let the word guide you, he'll show you just what to do. He's the healer. He's the deliverer. He's the savior. &gt;&gt; He's the provider. &gt;&gt; Then let him do it. Quit putting yourself in the way, putting yourself in the picture. Let's just put yourself out of the picture. &gt;&gt; And for me to live is Christ. He is the picture. Therefore, you are the picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. because that's you. All right? Now, when I say that you, I'm not talking about this man out here that you see dying. I'm talking about Christ. For for me to live, for me, me to live is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've entered in. Why do some of these troubles No, I'm sorry. Let me finish this. Oh, what a blessed assurance. just like a baby to lay your trust upon him and let him take all your cares for he cares for you. Don't try to do anything about it. He will do it already. He promised he would do it. It's his business. As long as you're fooling with it, well then he can't have it. But when you turn it loose and let him have it, he will take care of you. &gt;&gt; He will take care of it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just like a child. Child just lets go of it. asks father. Father gives it to him. Said, "I've got it. I've got it." &gt;&gt; Is that right? I've got it. &gt;&gt; He'll take care of it. Yes, sir. Oh, I like that. What a perfect calmness the Christian ought to have. &gt;&gt; Why do we come to these troubles? [snorts] What makes these things come? Let me just let me just look and read a scripture here first before I go any further. You know, we're talking about this this morning. We're talking about this. The mind of Christ ought to be operating among us. The mind of Christ should be operating among us. How many believe it is? &gt;&gt; See, it ought to be. Brother Bram said those words. I'm just quoting what he said. The mind of Christ ought to be operating among us. Amen. That's Christ in you. And you're predestinated as he was makes the word flesh in you as it was in him. Predestinated as he was makes the word flesh in you as it was in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why should a Christian ever be perplexed? Why do we come to these troubles? Let me read one scripture. Hebrews 5:8. I want you to see and then I'll read one more quote and just a couple thing. Can you bear it out? Five minutes with me and that'll be it. Hebrews 5'8. He was a son. How many know he was a birth son of God? Just like you are birth son of God. Amen. You have a spoken word birth spiritually, not physically. He was born physically virgin born. We are born spiritually virgin born. All right. Verse five or chapter 5 verse 8. Though he were a son, &gt;&gt; yet learned he obedience. I'm talking about learning to lean. Yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. In plain language, I just read to you the scripture here. And he being made perfect. Perfect through what? That that learning to lean, learning through uh suffering, he would made perfect and he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. In plain language, the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. Then how can you expect your character to be perfected any other way? We've been speaking about your character. That's Christ in you. That's your character. &gt;&gt; He left a church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of maturity, perfection. Amen. the very the very plain language. He was he was perfected through suffering. Amen. Now, why do we come to these troubles? What makes these things come? Why should a Christian ever be perplexed? Why would not everything just run perfect for a Christian? But it doesn't, and we know it. And sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were sinners. He said, "And sometimes, of course, it's written, many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God deliverth him out of them all." God promised many afflictions, strange feelings, strange things that would be beyond our understanding. But it's always done for our good. See, it's always done for our good. &gt;&gt; You just can't understand it because if we did, then it would not be faith to us. We would go on with an understanding. But we do it, we have it, and we believe by faith in his word that it's going to work some good thing for us. If we could grasp that today on this morning, if we could grasp that all of our troubles and there's none of us immune from them, and if we could realize that those things are for our good. It is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible, trials are brought upon us are more precious than gold itself. For it's given, God's giving us these trials and we become his when we become his property, our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him. Then every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, then it doesn't become a sad thing. It becomes a thing to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just contrary to what you thought. Amen. Because God's working out a plan. you. He He has a plan, a perfect plan for you in him, in his body. It's to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial come. I want to join join this morning with Job in saying, "I've lived long enough to know that's the truth." I raise my hand. I've seen it in my own life, and every time a great situation arises that I can't get around it or under it or over it, God makes a way and comes out glorious. I just wonder how his grace ever does it, but he does it. And remember in all these things, Satan tries to make us nervous and upset to get us to think, "Oh, why did this happen? Why couldn't I have been like this?" He said, "Let go of that and just give it over back to God." &gt;&gt; He allowed it. He purposed it. And he's taken it through you through you through it for an eternal purpose that he's ordained you for. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Then can't you see where we're standing? Life is in the grain again. Life is in the grain. What grain? The original seed that went in the ground. The same Jesus is here in the bride form. Same power, same church, same thing. It's the same word. The same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head. And all that life that come through there picked up his people. Now it's forming up into a head in bride form for the rapture. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many love him? &gt;&gt; You've got to go through these things, brother, sister. But remember, it's Christ in you. For me to live as Christ. Let's stand together. [clears throat] The very character of Christ was perfected by suffering. And we have a measure. If you want to read that, you can got a Brown church age book and start at one page 126 and go and read about the other things he said. God's making himself known to us personally. This is a personalizing of himself. Amen. How wants to say, "Lord, [music] give me more of you. Let me have more of you, Lord." Amen. Let me just have more of you. On the inside of that flesh man is a [music] man called spirit. He has five senses and those things are consciousness, thought, imagination, reasoning, memory, affections. You can't think with your body. You think with your mind. And there's where many Christians only stop. And they can just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field, they can be anointed with the same Holy Spirit that the real believer is anointed with in their spirit. But down on the inside of that next realm of that spirit is the soul. And that's predestinated by God. There is where the real germ lays is in there. And so the real gift is your soul down in there. That's the gift of eternal life. That's what God sees you as. That's what God knows you as. He can't look at that and look through. When he sees you, he has to look through the blood. And he can't see anything but you perfect. Do you believe that this morning? [music] Amen. You say, "But I'm not perfect." Which side are you looking at? [music] Look at what he said. No, David isn't perfect. But this word, my life, who I am on the inside is perfect. It can't be anything else but perfect. You say, "I don't believe that." Watch this. Every born again believer, true believer is perfectly, absolutely sinless before God. That's what [music] he said. We had a prophet say that he's not trusting in his works, but in the blood of Jesus that his confession is dropped into [music] the Bible says. So, see, he that's born of God does not commit sin. How can you take a birth word of God, how can you take the birth of God in your soul and commit sin? That seed cannot sin. God ever opened your heart to realize that's you. You've conquered every devil, every power. Why? Because the name of the Lord, our control, [music] our tower is in us. Our shepherd is in us. His word is in us that we [music] rely upon. You know, man was made to rely completely upon God. You know why he did? Because he knew where he came from. And when you know where you've come from, then you know who you are. [music] And when you know who you are, you know where you're going. &gt;&gt; And that's what's happening to the bride today. The secret is being revealed. He's here among us taking us out of this place secretly. It's a secret coming. Amen. And why will And if that's so secret, what will the rapture be? You could walk out of here and be gone and nobody would hardly know it. They'd say, "Well, we're thought we're looking for a rapture. It's already happening. One day this rapture will go, &gt;&gt; not come, go." Amen. How can you make a man a sinner when the bleached blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God? That would scatter sin till there be nothing left of it? How can that pure blood of Christ ever let sin pass? And when you're in Christ, you are what he is, perfection. So let the trials be. Don't find fault with them. Give them to God. Say, "Lord, you allowed this for a purpose, and I'm giving you glory in it, giving thanks in all things, for this is the will of God concerning you." Do you get that scripture? Do you understand what that just said? Give thanks in all things, for this is at the moment happening. This is the will of God concerning you. He's got such a control over you [music] that can't be anything but God under control. Nothing happens by chance. you are a believer, then rest in [music] him. Christ is my life. My heart is fixed. I'm learning to let [music] go entirely. Amen. Let him let him control. Let him teach you. Jesus himself [music] had to learn obedience. Had to learn to depend on God. Had to learn to obey. And if he had to learn, we do. It's the same spirit working in us. Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Lord Jesus, this seemed like a very cutup message, especially to me because there was so much to say, [music] but I felt compelled to say what I've said, Lord. And it's in your hands. [music] It's put in your hands. Many things I'll probably go back and realize, well, I missed that. I missed that. But Lord, you said it. You spoke it. It shall not return to you void. It went out to predestinated seed this morning. May they put their arms around that predestination. Say, Lord, here am I. Here my Lord. Lead me, guide me, direct me in what pleases you. [music] For my life is your life. For my faith is your faith and it's moving [music] in me. And that's my anchor. That's my absolute. It's Christ in me. My [music] heart is fixed. Bless thy word, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'd like to sing [music] a couple little song. First, I'd like to sing Learning to Lean. I'm learning to lean. Amen. I'm learning to lean. [singing] Learning to lean. [singing] I'm learning [music] to lean [singing] on G. That person Christ in you gaining [singing] more power than I'm ever [singing] seen. I'm learning to lean on Jesus. [singing] I don't think I know the verses. Do you know the verses? You don't know them either. Okay, let's just sing the chorus once again, [music] I guess. Well, it's a Well, it's the same. It's a verse. It's not a chorus. Let's go back to that again. Sad, bro. [singing] [music] At an altar, I knelt. I found [music] peace. I don't think that's right. secure. [singing and music] Have you found that peace and all [singing] that he asks me? A life, trust, and a heart [music] that is learning [singing] to lead. Well, [singing and music] I'm learning to lean. That's right. Learning. Let your [music] heart be fixed this morning. It's Christ that's your focus. Follow him. Let him lead you. Deny yourself daily and let him guide you. Oh, I'm gaining [singing] more power than I've [singing] ever seen. I'm learning [singing] to lean on Jesus. Now, [music] not my the favorite song, but one of my favorites. Isn't that funny? I just took a blank on what it was. Well, of course, the original life. That's Christ in you. For me to live is to live an [music] original life. Amen. God's attributes were [singing] manifested with bride in this last age. We have caught the revel. That's it. The last prophet's message and we somebody's going to get the revelation. Might as well be you. Praise the Lord for the original life. The original life. The original seed, the original word is what I believe. [music] The son of man is revealed. Seventh seal is unveiled. Original life, the original seed. [singing and music] We are the word made flesh today. This is what the Do you believe that? And our names are seen within redeemed, perfect without sin. Yes, we are anointed and [music] inspired by our God whose original life, [singing] the original life, the original seed, the original word is what I believe. [singing] The son of man is revealed. Seventh seal is [singing] unveiled. Yes sir. [music] Our eyes of understanding he has opened up at last [music] and sweet vic is victory yours who were [singing] chained down in [music] the path. Oh, true jubilee has sounded and I have responded to our God whose original life, [singing and music] the original lie, the spoken word. Amen. The original word is what I believe. The son of man revealed in me. revealed in me the original life, the original seed. We are called a maturity full authority and power. [music] Sleeping saints will wake and join us for translation [singing] in this hour. Gentile days will soon be over. Glory hallelujah to our God. Who's my original [music] life, my original life, my original seed, my original word [music] is what I believe. The son of man is unveiled. Sven seal is unveiled. original [music] life, my original seed. You say, "Brother David, how can you say it's yours? It was mine to begin with." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was in me to begin with. I'm seated in it now. You say, "You make that sound awful real." It is real. You say, "That's awful, complicated." No, it's simple. It just needs to be revealed. [music] That's all. How you going to get it revealed? By feeding, by leaning, by listening, faith cometh [music] how? By hearing the word. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Till we meet again. God be with you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] [music]
