[36:17] today as i pray you enjoy your time here
[36:21] amen let's not forget the needs of the
[36:23] saints in the ukraine
[36:25] just such an ongoing
[36:28] very quickly changing
[36:30] uh
[36:31] situation
[36:33] we're seeing
[36:35] we're seeing god do the miraculous and
[36:37] yet it you know doesn't strike the world
[36:40] that way but we're seeing areas little
[36:42] pockets where uh the russians have
[36:45] complete control and yet the believers
[36:47] are able uh to pass through
[36:50] uh to safety and and in some cases not
[36:53] even meeting in an area that's
[36:55] considered occupied not even meeting um
[36:58] you know a russian patrol or or being
[37:01] stopped and uh then the situation you
[37:03] know changes in such a fashion
[37:06] now look how god works every time he's
[37:08] promised that he would deliver his
[37:10] saints through the ages he delivered
[37:12] shadrach meshach and abednego out of the
[37:14] fire can you scientifically explain that
[37:19] know what it is it's god fulfilling his
[37:22] word and we're seeing in this
[37:24] last hour he promised that he would
[37:26] protect his saints that
[37:28] nothing would come against them now that
[37:30] doesn't mean my brother and sister that
[37:32] somewhere a son or daughter of god might
[37:34] not suffer in the flesh but the thing is
[37:37] is we are looking at the promise of god
[37:39] that he has given to us and we're
[37:41] holding to that promise we're not just
[37:43] taking it lightly but we're we're taking
[37:45] that in faith amen as brother chris just
[37:48] sang the song it's it's our faith that's
[37:51] going to hold us and not our mental
[37:53] abilities or our knowledge and so let's
[37:56] just remember those saints there so many
[37:58] things to share
[38:00] that it would be a distraction of time
[38:03] but god is working god is moving on
[38:06] their behalf and um
[38:09] just once again as as a note just so
[38:11] you'll know
[38:13] that the church we have been giving to
[38:15] that and we are planning in the next few
[38:17] days to give again
[38:19] and um
[38:20] so just be uh aware you know your
[38:24] prayers are more important than your
[38:25] money
[38:27] so we can put such a great emphasis on
[38:29] money but your prayers are are much much
[38:33] more important than money and so let's
[38:36] just continue to lift the saints there
[38:38] up in prayer
[38:39] and you know i just want to put as a
[38:42] side note
[38:44] every one of us is currently in our own
[38:47] exodus
[38:50] so
[38:50] we look at you know those believers
[38:52] fleeing from the war zones
[38:55] and we see that exodus and how strenuous
[38:58] it is but we need to remember every one
[39:00] of us is in our own exodus and every one
[39:03] of us and i just i don't know why i feel
[39:06] led to say this but just as on my heart
[39:09] what we need
[39:10] is food and water in our exodus
[39:15] and without spiritual food and without
[39:17] the holy ghost
[39:18] we'll never finish this exodus but with
[39:21] the spirit of the lord upon us and the
[39:23] word of god before us we can finish
[39:26] every battle every journey be victorious
[39:30] in all things so let's just remember as
[39:33] a side note as i spoke to the other day
[39:35] we don't have to worry about the nations
[39:38] we've got to worry about as revelations
[39:40] 3 shows us he says i would that you
[39:42] would be hot or cold
[39:44] and so let's be hot amen let's be on
[39:47] fire for the things of god trusting the
[39:49] lord amen remember your prayer changes
[39:52] things
[39:53] so today we're just really happy to have
[39:55] my dear friends

[42:44] the bride is rising up
[42:47] she's getting ready
[42:49] this is the most exciting time to live
[42:52] because this is the time where the word
[42:54] is make it becoming flesh
[42:56] this is the time where all we have heard
[42:59] is coming to materializations
[43:02] so we thank god for opening our eyes the
[43:04] eyes of our understanding in this hour
[43:07] so because now we have heard but now we
[43:11] are seeing
[43:12] so we thanking god for his grace and
[43:14] mercy and for
[43:16] uh every single thing he's doing in our
[43:18] lives
[43:19] uh it's uh it's amazing what god is
[43:22] doing like the brother was saying from
[43:23] the people from ukraine
[43:25] so you realize that god is always has
[43:29] been always with you
[43:31] regardless of the conditions regardless
[43:34] of the time he always there until when
[43:38] you start realizing when you are at the
[43:41] wet hand or you have a very difficult
[43:44] situations when you call upon his name
[43:47] is the present help in time of need
[43:49] that is the god you are serving this
[43:51] morning
[43:52] and then we are glad to be called his
[43:54] children
[43:55] thank you brother paul and the family
[43:56] for the invitations and uh we thank you
[43:59] very much it has been very good to be
[44:01] here

[44:04] god bless you
[44:06] and uh it's good
[44:08] to see each and every one of you here
[44:10] brother dean hart and every single one
[44:12] brother jason god bless you
[44:15] then my friend there is coming taller
[44:17] and taller
[44:20] god bless you all amen so that is maybe
[44:23] all that i can say now shall we stand
[44:26] god the word of god
[44:28] amen if you have your bible at the
[44:31] beginning was the word and the word was
[44:33] with god
[44:34] and the word was god
[44:36] amen that's why we are here let us open
[44:39] our bibles in uh genesis chapter 5
[44:43] verse 21.
[44:48] uh and the bible uh if you have it
[44:51] oh praise the lord it's already up there
[44:55] okay genesis 5 21
[44:58] the bible says
[45:00] and enoch
[45:02] leave
[45:04] six
[45:05] sixty and five years
[45:09] and we got methuselah
[45:11] and enoch walked with god
[45:14] now
[45:16] uh
[45:17] the word he walked with god
[45:21] uh after we got methuselah
[45:24] 300 years and begot sons and daughters
[45:27] so we understand by that that enoch was
[45:30] like one of us enoch was having a family
[45:34] enoch was saving a house because he have
[45:37] sons and daughters
[45:39] he has to put them in a house enoch was
[45:42] going to work or he know was maybe a
[45:44] farmer
[45:45] enoch was doing all these things
[45:48] but also he walked
[45:51] with god
[45:53] amen
[45:54] and then he says and all the days of
[45:57] enoch with 365
[46:00] years
[46:01] and enoch walked with god
[46:04] and he was not
[46:06] for god
[46:08] for god
[46:10] took him
[46:11] amen
[46:13] it's very good to read the word of god
[46:15] yeah because for god is the one who
[46:18] doing these things
[46:19] and god took enoch he was a man walking
[46:23] he was a man doing all the things that
[46:26] men do but by the same time he was
[46:30] working with god let us pray
[46:33] heavenly father we thank you this
[46:35] morning
[46:36] began this as a great privilege to be in
[46:38] your presence
[46:39] we thank you father for this time for
[46:42] this assembly and for the pastor and for
[46:44] every single one of us
[46:46] we just commit the remaining of this
[46:47] service in your hand
[46:49] we thank you and bless your holy name in
[46:51] the name of our lord jesus christ we
[46:52] pray
[46:53] amen amen god bless you as you may have
[46:55] your seat
[46:58] so we see that uh the bible says enoch
[47:00] walked with god
[47:02] and then god took him
[47:05] so enoch is a type of believers because
[47:09] you see god want us
[47:11] to
[47:13] come up to the higher place
[47:16] god want doesn't want us to remain where
[47:19] we are
[47:20] god wants us to go higher and higher you
[47:24] see he said the natural is the type of
[47:26] the spiritual so it's in the natural man
[47:29] always advanced
[47:31] men always want to move forward
[47:34] actually you want you you the car you
[47:36] have right now it's not the car of 1965
[47:40] because now you have all the technology
[47:42] inside the car you have the sensors you
[47:45] have the chips you have all these things
[47:47] they make it to run better than it was
[47:50] in 1965 for example because man is
[47:54] always trying to better themselves they
[47:57] want to move forward because actually
[48:01] the natural is the type of the
[48:02] spirituals because god wants us to come
[48:06] up higher he wants us to come where he
[48:09] is because the way i am i want you also
[48:11] to come
[48:12] amen so we see that god
[48:15] is willing and wanting us to come as
[48:19] much closer to him as we are and then
[48:23] because enoch is the type of believers
[48:26] and that word work in the bible uh it's
[48:29] a reference of
[48:32] an expression that means fellowship and
[48:34] obedience
[48:37] so work mean fellowship and obedience
[48:41] that produce results
[48:43] so when you are fellowshipping with god
[48:46] and your obedience to god is referred
[48:49] the manner
[48:50] it's referred basically to a manner of a
[48:52] life or a living that is near to god
[48:58] so it's basically you you how you are
[49:01] closer to god
[49:04] the manner of your life the manner of
[49:07] your living
[49:08] is as closer to god as possible that
[49:12] means walk with god
[49:14] amen so that's why enoch worked with god
[49:18] basically that means enoch was living a
[49:22] life so close to god
[49:25] every single thing he was doing was so
[49:27] close he was conscious of what god says
[49:30] he was aware of what god required
[49:34] and then he was walking very close to
[49:36] god and then because when you walk close
[49:39] to god
[49:40] every single thing becomes possible
[49:44] because god is your friend every single
[49:47] thing become possible because with god
[49:49] nothing shall be impossible
[49:51] in god's vocabulary there's not
[49:53] impossibilities
[49:55] if god every single thing is possible
[49:58] god wants us to come to his kingdom his
[50:01] kingdom where is ruling
[50:03] because a kingdom basically you have a
[50:05] ruler and you have subjects
[50:07] and then god is the ruler and we are a
[50:10] subject so he wants us to be ruled by
[50:13] him he want us to be ruled by the holy
[50:15] ghost
[50:16] he wants us to be ruled by the power of
[50:19] the holy ghost
[50:20] amen
[50:22] amen so and then the bible says in
[50:25] hebrew chapter 11 verse 5
[50:28] hebrew 11 verse 5 the bible says
[50:31] it says here it says
[50:33] by faith
[50:36] enoch was
[50:38] translated that he should not see death
[50:43] end was not found
[50:46] because god
[50:49] has translated him
[50:53] amen so enoch was translated that she
[50:56] should not see death
[50:58] because god is the one who translated
[51:02] him
[51:03] he was just working with god and god is
[51:07] the one who's doing the work inside
[51:09] it's not you doing the work
[51:11] and your your only job is to obey god
[51:15] your only job is to trust god and your
[51:18] only job is to stay behind the word of
[51:20] god and when you do so now god
[51:23] is the one as enoch was working with god
[51:27] and god was making the transformation
[51:30] every single time you come to listen to
[51:32] the word there's something that is
[51:34] happening is that what the bible said
[51:37] don't forsake the assembling of
[51:39] yourselves
[51:40] because that's where things happened
[51:42] because when you come to church that way
[51:44] miracles happen
[51:46] it's where god is dealing with us the
[51:49] inside man is getting fed by the word of
[51:52] god and when the inside man is fed by
[51:54] the word of god the transformation is
[51:57] happening and you don't even know how
[52:00] it's happening but it's happening
[52:02] because god cannot lie
[52:05] amen
[52:06] praise the i feel good amen
[52:09] praise the lord and then he said enoch
[52:11] was translated that he should not see
[52:14] death and it was not found because god
[52:18] translated him
[52:19] for before his translation
[52:23] now listen to this he said before his
[52:26] translation he has his testimonies
[52:31] that he please god
[52:34] see the bible so precise
[52:37] he said he has his testimony that he
[52:40] pleases god
[52:42] amen and that word pleasing god
[52:46] basically means
[52:48] an essential aspect of life of believer
[52:51] basically
[52:53] uh
[52:55] the total commitment to god
[52:59] amen that is pleasing god
[53:01] when you commit yourself completely to
[53:04] god
[53:06] when you give yourself completely to god
[53:10] now that is pleasing god
[53:13] so that is please that's why the prophet
[53:15] of god says a a complete surrender to
[53:19] the all word of god and title you to the
[53:23] token
[53:24] when you completely surrender to god
[53:27] when you completely give yourself to god
[53:31] when you completely obey the word of god
[53:34] now you have access to the token and the
[53:38] token is the holy ghost and the holy
[53:41] ghost gives you power to do things that
[53:43] you cannot do
[53:44] the holy ghost gives you power to do
[53:47] things that yourself you cannot do
[53:51] prophet says that the holy ghost gives
[53:53] you three powers
[53:55] so it gives you the power of prayer
[53:58] it gives you the power of speech
[54:00] and it gives you the power of your holy
[54:02] life
[54:03] so because you cannot do these things by
[54:06] yourself
[54:07] you cannot manufacture the christian
[54:09] life you cannot manufacture how to live
[54:12] as a christian
[54:13] but you need god to come on the sins god
[54:16] they got inside working on the outside
[54:20] the one is inside of you is greater than
[54:23] the one who is in the world because he's
[54:26] the one who's doing the work he's the
[54:28] one who's performing all these things
[54:30] he's the one who's making the
[54:31] translations because enoch worked with
[54:34] god and god was pleased with finals and
[54:37] god translated enough and enoch was not
[54:41] because enoch was a brother like you and
[54:43] me enoch was weak and the prophet enoch
[54:45] is the type of the believers
[54:49] praise the lord
[54:50] it's a pleasing god
[54:53] is a total commitment to god's word
[54:57] so when you fully surrender all to god
[55:02] when we fully surrender all to god
[55:04] sometimes that
[55:06] we have it difficult sometimes because
[55:08] we are not completely surrendering to
[55:11] god
[55:12] so when you fully surrender to god
[55:15] and god is pleased
[55:17] with enoch in romans 12 verse 1
[55:20] the bible says
[55:23] i beseech you therefore brethren
[55:26] by the mercies of god that you present
[55:28] your bodies
[55:31] as a living sacrifice
[55:34] holy acceptable unto god
[55:38] which is your reasonable service
[55:44] total commitment to
[55:46] god when you totally committed to god
[55:51] that is your reasonable service to god
[55:54] and now when you commit it to god and
[55:57] god will take control
[56:00] and god you see uh
[56:02] we talked about the young rich ruler
[56:05] he was not
[56:06] able to commit all to god
[56:11] he was he was reluctant he didn't want
[56:13] to commit all things to god in order for
[56:16] god to take control
[56:18] when you committed you see the the young
[56:21] boy who was having his lunch box
[56:24] with a for lunch going to school and
[56:27] then he heard that jesus was preaching
[56:29] he missed school that day
[56:31] and then he went to see jesus and then
[56:34] he he committed his lunch
[56:37] to jesus christ
[56:39] and when jesus speaks it lunch up and
[56:42] then he looked towards loaves of bread
[56:44] and fish and then when jesus blessed it
[56:47] and then he started multiplying and then
[56:49] he gave it to the disciples and then
[56:52] when they went start giving to people
[56:54] and they just cut one bread
[56:58] and the bread just become big again
[57:01] they did the bible they didn't go back
[57:03] to jesus again say uh my bread is
[57:06] finished give me another one i need to
[57:08] go to serve
[57:09] they never went back to jesus read it
[57:11] they said jesus bless the bread and give
[57:15] it to them
[57:16] and then they went in the midst of five
[57:18] thousand people the bible says
[57:22] the bible say five thousand men
[57:25] probably five thousand women
[57:27] and then maybe five thousand kids
[57:30] maybe it was fifteen thousand people
[57:32] because the bible says it fed five
[57:34] thousand men
[57:37] but
[57:38] the disciple never go back to the end of
[57:41] jesus again
[57:42] because this boy committed every single
[57:46] things to god
[57:47] when you commit every single things to
[57:49] god god does have a power of
[57:51] multiplications
[57:53] does the god does have a power of
[57:55] transformation
[57:57] god can change things can god can create
[58:00] where there's no creation
[58:02] amen
[58:04] praise the lord
[58:06] amen see the young rich ruler didn't
[58:10] catch that revelation
[58:12] he didn't know who he was talking to
[58:14] he didn't know in which presence he was
[58:16] in
[58:17] he was in the presence of the creator of
[58:19] heaven and earth the men who created the
[58:22] moon the man who created the sun the man
[58:24] who created every single thing because
[58:26] the bible says all things were met by
[58:28] him and for him and for his own glory
[58:32] praise the lord
[58:34] amen
[58:35] hey
[58:37] your reasonable service
[58:39] in the book of psalms chapter 103 the
[58:41] bible says
[58:43] he says
[58:45] bless the lord o my soul
[58:49] and all that is within me bless his holy
[58:52] name
[58:53] bless the lord on my soul and forget not
[58:57] all his benefits
[58:59] my subject is the benefit of working
[59:02] with god that's my subject this morning
[59:05] the benefit of working with god now the
[59:09] bible says here bless this bless the
[59:12] lord all my soul
[59:16] within your soul the inside man
[59:20] the inside man that where god wants you
[59:23] to focus on you can focus on the outside
[59:26] man you can put on your suit you can put
[59:29] on your shirt but if you're inside man
[59:32] there's no room for god every single
[59:35] thing is nothing
[59:36] amen now what david says
[59:39] bless the lord on my soul and forget not
[59:43] all this
[59:44] benefit now listen verse or three all
[59:48] three said chapter three verse three
[59:50] says
[59:51] who forgive
[59:53] all thy iniquities
[59:56] that is the one of the benefit that when
[59:58] working with god
[1:00:00] who forget all the iniquities
[1:00:03] and then he says who in all thy diseases
[1:00:08] it doesn't matter what disease it is
[1:00:11] it doesn't matter what the name of the
[1:00:13] disease either they can name it cancer
[1:00:16] they can emit high blood pressure they
[1:00:18] can name it asthma or whatever more but
[1:00:21] our god
[1:00:22] is our god is healing us from all
[1:00:25] diseases
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:29] it is
[1:00:30] specialized
[1:00:32] in things that are impossible
[1:00:34] amen he said who redeemed thy life from
[1:00:38] destructions
[1:00:43] who is delivering that from the stress
[1:00:45] so can we imagine if you didn't have
[1:00:47] christ where will you be

[1:01:04] who has plagued us from the hand of
[1:01:06] distractions who crown and deal with
[1:01:09] loving kindness
[1:01:12] and tend to mercies
[1:01:14] who satisfy thy mouth with good thing
[1:01:18] so that the youth is renewed like an ego
[1:01:23] amen
[1:01:24] this is not the assembly of old people
[1:01:27] this is not only a summary of young
[1:01:29] people this is the assembly where god is
[1:01:31] renewing our strength day to day
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:36] praise the lord he's the one who's doing
[1:01:39] that he's the one who's making the
[1:01:41] translations
[1:01:43] amen
[1:01:45] enoch worked with god
[1:01:48] and it was not because
[1:01:51] god
[1:01:52] took him
[1:01:54] he took him bring him up to the higher
[1:01:56] ground
[1:01:57] say come up higher john
[1:02:00] that way revelation is
[1:02:02] that's why you can see me
[1:02:04] amen
[1:02:07] when we speak about benefits
[1:02:09] benefited mean
[1:02:12] that there is an advantage
[1:02:15] that come out of something
[1:02:17] that that is
[1:02:18] benefit there's an advantage come out
[1:02:21] from something you see when you go look
[1:02:23] for a job
[1:02:24] they say our job we have certain benefit
[1:02:27] that will give you
[1:02:29] we give you x amount of vacation time
[1:02:32] we'll give you a retirement account
[1:02:35] we'll do this
[1:02:38] maybe you have a three year three month
[1:02:40] of vacation i don't know if that exists

[1:02:52] benefit and this benefit and this
[1:02:54] benefit
[1:02:55] but the only thing we need to realize is
[1:02:57] that all those benefits are limited
[1:03:03] all those benefits are limited
[1:03:06] only god's benefits are unlimited
[1:03:12] so you can have all this benefit but
[1:03:14] they are limited
[1:03:16] but only god only got benefits
[1:03:21] look the love of god
[1:03:23] the love of god is unlimited benefit
[1:03:26] because the bible david once says where
[1:03:29] shall i go
[1:03:30] from thy spirits
[1:03:34] where shall i go from that spirit he
[1:03:36] said if i stand up in heaven that was
[1:03:39] there if if i go i make my bed down into
[1:03:44] hell you are there
[1:03:47] that is a benefit that is unlimited
[1:03:50] it doesn't matter what you have been
[1:03:52] where you have been what you have done
[1:03:54] where you have been but god's mercy
[1:03:57] endure forever
[1:04:00] he always looking for us

[1:04:27] we we don't know he was was he filled
[1:04:28] with the holy ghost we don't know
[1:04:30] but he was a teeth that he was his
[1:04:32] identity
[1:04:34] but in the presence of the sun
[1:04:36] in the presence of the transformation
[1:04:38] power in the presence of god god is the
[1:04:42] one who can change every single things
[1:04:44] god is the one who can change the course
[1:04:46] of your life god is the one who can

[1:04:57] single thing because he's the one is the
[1:05:00] same yesterday today and forever is
[1:05:03] loving kindness
[1:05:05] never ended
[1:05:06] that is our god
[1:05:08] praise the lord
[1:05:10] prophet of god saying the message
[1:05:12] greater than solomon is here
[1:05:14] 1963.
[1:05:16] he says
[1:05:19] here it says look at the church so the
[1:05:22] church
[1:05:24] is always
[1:05:27] looking back
[1:05:30] the church is always looking back
[1:05:34] say let's look up
[1:05:37] let's look up
[1:05:39] amen he says the church is always
[1:05:41] looking back
[1:05:43] say let's look up
[1:05:45] for the power are limited
[1:05:48] so their power are limited
[1:05:51] the power of the churches
[1:05:53] the power of people are limited now you
[1:05:56] want to understand and we have
[1:05:58] unlimited power
[1:06:01] for all things are possible to them that
[1:06:04] believe in god
[1:06:07] because when all things are possible
[1:06:09] that is unlimited
[1:06:12] that is unlimited so when you're working
[1:06:15] with god you have unlimited power
[1:06:18] every single thing is possible
[1:06:20] you you don't don't don't think that
[1:06:23] this will happen you the only thing you
[1:06:25] need to do is to trust and obey god
[1:06:29] is to trust and obey god the rest of the
[1:06:31] thing god will take care of that we
[1:06:33] don't know how he'll do it but he'll do
[1:06:35] it anyhow he said moses i want you to go
[1:06:38] with the children of israel
[1:06:40] and you'll cross this red sea
[1:06:43] looks like an impossible task
[1:06:45] but god knows what he's doing
[1:06:48] god is in control
[1:06:50] of every single thing
[1:06:52] praise the lord
[1:06:53] and then he says and a quickening part
[1:06:55] in the in the rising side in the rising
[1:06:57] of the sun he says
[1:06:59] the quickening power
[1:07:01] let us see is coming
[1:07:04] the quickening power
[1:07:07] stretches from death to life
[1:07:11] we were once dead
[1:07:13] by the quickening power of god
[1:07:15] he said the quickening power give us
[1:07:17] discernment
[1:07:21] that the only thing can give us
[1:07:22] discernment to know exactly to know what
[1:07:25] is wrong with
[1:07:26] you what to do
[1:07:30] what you have done
[1:07:32] and what you have not to have done and
[1:07:34] what should i have done and what will be
[1:07:37] the quickening power all these things is
[1:07:40] doing
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:43] it gives you discernment
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:46] so now when you're working with god you
[1:07:48] you have discernment
[1:07:50] because you have the holy ghost
[1:07:52] you have
[1:07:53] the holy ghost is very important oh yes
[1:07:56] because we felt we fought we fought the
[1:07:59] holy ghost impossible to be a christian
[1:08:01] to work a christian life
[1:08:04] because it's god himself who will do the
[1:08:07] work
[1:08:08] it's god himself will be leading you
[1:08:11] it's god himself who is in command he's
[1:08:13] the one who's in charge and that he will
[1:08:16] guide you in the right path and then
[1:08:18] he's the one who will give you
[1:08:20] discernment we'll let you know you have
[1:08:22] to do this you don't have to do this
[1:08:25] only the quickening power can do that
[1:08:28] amen
[1:08:30] praise the lord
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:33] so our work with god come with many
[1:08:35] benefits
[1:08:37] in this life and life to come
[1:08:40] see uh peter once
[1:08:43] he went he says lord
[1:08:46] as a businessman
[1:08:49] we have forsaken every single thing what
[1:08:52] can i gain
[1:08:55] that is peter talking to the lord
[1:08:57] himself
[1:08:58] so what can i gain
[1:09:00] i we have forsaken every single thing to
[1:09:02] follow you
[1:09:03] but as far as i can see you don't have a
[1:09:06] house
[1:09:08] you don't have a house you don't have a
[1:09:09] boat the other day you borrow my boat
[1:09:12] you don't have a boat you don't have a
[1:09:14] house
[1:09:15] so
[1:09:16] what are my gaining
[1:09:19] when i'm following you
[1:09:22] that that
[1:09:23] spirit you read that in the book of luke
[1:09:25] on the book of mark
[1:09:26] he said what can i gain what happened
[1:09:29] jesus says peter no man
[1:09:32] no man has followed me
[1:09:35] he said he will get in this world i'll
[1:09:38] give him houses
[1:09:40] i'll give him lands
[1:09:42] that jesus himself saying
[1:09:44] i give him not one house he said houses
[1:09:47] i give him lands i give him brothers and
[1:09:50] sisters and in the life to come eternal
[1:09:53] life
[1:09:54] that is a benefit that is unlimited that
[1:09:57] the only god who can do that because all
[1:10:00] these benefits are limited but god one
[1:10:03] is unlimited
[1:10:04] praise the lord
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:09] he not live a life that demonstrate the
[1:10:11] faith
[1:10:13] that was in his heart
[1:10:16] his life
[1:10:17] of faith was consistent
[1:10:21] constant
[1:10:22] and complete work with god
[1:10:26] that was enoch life it was consistent
[1:10:30] and complete work with god
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:34] and then we see that
[1:10:36] when
[1:10:38] you're walking with god
[1:10:40] god
[1:10:42] introduce you to the supernatural that's
[1:10:45] right amen that's right
[1:10:47] exactly because it's natural for god to
[1:10:49] be supernatural amen
[1:10:53] that's exactly right it's natural for
[1:10:55] god to be supernatural
[1:10:57] so when we're working with him he
[1:10:59] introduces you to the supernatural
[1:11:02] amen because the supernatural means
[1:11:05] beyond and above the naturals
[1:11:08] it's something that is beyond and it's
[1:11:10] behind and above the natural
[1:11:13] you cannot explain it and then this is
[1:11:16] where god operates this is where in the
[1:11:19] realm where men and god are meeting
[1:11:21] together
[1:11:22] this is in the wrong way where the
[1:11:24] unbeliever cannot understand this is
[1:11:26] where man and god are meeting together
[1:11:29] that is in the supernatural that way
[1:11:31] you're reaching god that's where you
[1:11:33] come to god in prayer that where you
[1:11:35] have faith in the word of god and then
[1:11:37] the supernatural in following you
[1:11:40] because that way god wants to do
[1:11:42] amen
[1:11:44] praise the lord
[1:11:46] in the book of acts chapter 13 verse 22
[1:11:49] the bible says
[1:11:51] and when
[1:11:53] he has to remove him
[1:11:55] he raise up david unto them david
[1:11:58] to be their king
[1:12:00] to whom also he give
[1:12:03] testimony
[1:12:05] and say i have found david
[1:12:08] the son of jesse
[1:12:10] a man
[1:12:12] after my own heart
[1:12:15] which shall fulfill all my will
[1:12:20] so david was a man according to god's
[1:12:23] heart
[1:12:25] he was like
[1:12:27] like us yes sir that's right but he was
[1:12:30] a man according to god's own heart you
[1:12:32] see now see that part of david's call
[1:12:36] why call men according to one's heart
[1:12:38] because he has absolute faith in god
[1:12:43] it doesn't matter the opinion of father
[1:12:45] said goliath is big and you cannot reach
[1:12:47] him this is an impossible task to do but
[1:12:50] he was trusting in god completely
[1:12:53] and god was coming on
[1:12:54] on the scene you see elias was in
[1:12:58] contact with god was working with god
[1:13:01] was
[1:13:01] doing was in in relationship with god
[1:13:05] the bible says in book of james said
[1:13:07] elijah was a man of subject-like passion
[1:13:10] as we are
[1:13:12] but he pray earnestly that
[1:13:15] it might not rain and then it did not
[1:13:17] rain
[1:13:19] not only for one day
[1:13:21] but for three and a half years
[1:13:24] because now when you are walking with
[1:13:27] god
[1:13:28] god introduces you
[1:13:30] to the supernatural
[1:13:33] where things start happening
[1:13:35] when you start
[1:13:37] waiting upon the lord
[1:13:39] so those who are waiting upon the lord
[1:13:42] shall renew their strength
[1:13:44] so you just look to god say god this is
[1:13:46] difficult for me
[1:13:48] but it's not difficult for you
[1:13:50] i just commit my life to you i just
[1:13:52] commit this situation to you this is
[1:13:55] what i have this is what problem i have
[1:13:58] this god i want you to come on the scene
[1:14:00] and then you just wait
[1:14:02] and god take they take over
[1:14:04] and then he says that he was a man of
[1:14:07] like passion as we are you see now in
[1:14:10] hebrew chapter 11 verse 1 he said now
[1:14:13] faith is a substance
[1:14:15] now faith is a substance or things up
[1:14:18] for the evidence of things not see
[1:14:21] for by hit the elders obtain a good
[1:14:24] report
[1:14:27] now because
[1:14:28] it is you don't see it but you believe
[1:14:31] it
[1:14:32] you don't know how it will happen but
[1:14:34] you believe god will make it happen
[1:14:36] you don't know what will happen what
[1:14:39] what the end result will come but god
[1:14:42] who is rich and mercy is in control
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:47] praise the lord
[1:14:49] amen
[1:14:50] say verily verily i said to you that
[1:14:53] except a man is born again
[1:14:56] cannot see the kingdom of god
[1:14:59] the prophet come say seeing
[1:15:02] means
[1:15:03] understanding amen
[1:15:06] amen
[1:15:07] seeing men understanding the kingdom of
[1:15:09] god
[1:15:10] because you he says he says you can you
[1:15:13] can see
[1:15:15] but you cannot understand
[1:15:17] like the pharisees
[1:15:19] they were there but they could not
[1:15:21] understand
[1:15:23] he says seeing means understanding but
[1:15:25] the holy ghost will make you understand
[1:15:28] what god is doing
[1:15:30] because god himself will be believing
[1:15:31] his own word because it's god inside of
[1:15:34] you will be believing his own word he'll
[1:15:37] be saying amen to his own words because
[1:15:40] all it's about god
[1:15:42] amen
[1:15:44] praise the lord
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:48] praise the lord
[1:15:50] he says uh
[1:15:52] the book of luke chapter 22 24
[1:15:56] he said that this the disciples or the
[1:16:00] two that were going to the road to a
[1:16:02] mouse
[1:16:04] the way
[1:16:06] talking
[1:16:08] among themselves
[1:16:11] they could not understand what was going
[1:16:13] on
[1:16:15] and then the way
[1:16:17] torn up
[1:16:18] so we don't understand
[1:16:21] they were walking
[1:16:23] and then they were talking
[1:16:25] so we don't understand what's going on
[1:16:28] how jesus
[1:16:30] the king of kings
[1:16:32] could die
[1:16:35] i i don't understand
[1:16:38] see when you talk about him he comes yes
[1:16:42] and it was in the midst of them
[1:16:44] and the bible says
[1:16:46] he start talking to them
[1:16:48] it's not addressing their doubt
[1:16:52] started stressing their doubt it's that
[1:16:54] question did you you you didn't read
[1:16:58] what the prophet says yeah
[1:17:00] he didn't come say uh yeah i am yeah no
[1:17:02] no no no it's not it start by
[1:17:05] dealing with their doubt you didn't read
[1:17:07] what the prophet said
[1:17:09] and they keep walking
[1:17:11] and then invite they invite jesus for a
[1:17:14] dinner
[1:17:15] their house
[1:17:17] and then
[1:17:19] he allow now their eyes to open
[1:17:22] and they could see him now
[1:17:24] oh it's you
[1:17:27] and they appear
[1:17:28] to them
[1:17:30] and then they give them directions
[1:17:34] give them direction go there in
[1:17:36] jerusalem
[1:17:38] until we enjoy power
[1:17:40] and then he blessed them
[1:17:43] because they were working with them we
[1:17:44] with him
[1:17:46] because the bible says
[1:17:48] i will not leave you comfortless
[1:17:50] i'll come to you
[1:17:53] the world will not see me
[1:17:55] but you
[1:17:57] you will see me
[1:17:58] in another way
[1:17:59] you will start understanding what is my
[1:18:02] plan for this time
[1:18:04] what is my plan what am i doing
[1:18:06] with the modern event made clear by
[1:18:08] prophecies
[1:18:10] now we can understand their future home
[1:18:13] our our future home will be our life is
[1:18:16] not limited here our life is not like
[1:18:18] just hearing uh going to where coming
[1:18:20] going no allah we have a better purpose
[1:18:23] than that we have been called for a
[1:18:25] higher purpose we have been called to go
[1:18:27] up higher in the kingdom of god and then
[1:18:30] here with a stranger and
[1:18:32] going on going through this world but we
[1:18:35] have another kingdom that is waiting for
[1:18:38] us another land that is a beulah land
[1:18:40] that's a beautiful land in this one and
[1:18:43] jesus give us instructions about our
[1:18:46] future home
[1:18:47] about the event that's coming out about
[1:18:50] all these things and then we know who we
[1:18:53] are in the word of god we know our
[1:18:55] position in the word of god we're just
[1:18:57] not people like any other people but we
[1:19:00] know exactly why we are here because the
[1:19:02] prophet said this building was built for
[1:19:04] a purpose
[1:19:06] this building was here for a purpose uh
[1:19:09] likewise you are also here for for a
[1:19:11] purpose
[1:19:12] so we are does not hear absolutely
[1:19:15] and then it says here in the easter seal
[1:19:18] the tourists in 1965 in 19621
[1:19:21] he says here he says
[1:19:23] i don't know if i did write that down
[1:19:25] okay
[1:19:26] say
[1:19:28] i will read this uh i didn't give that
[1:19:31] to the brothers but he said because they
[1:19:33] are chosen
[1:19:35] the neuropath
[1:19:37] the harder way
[1:19:41] that as work
[1:19:43] that you have worked
[1:19:46] of your own choosing
[1:19:50] you have choose
[1:19:52] the harder way
[1:19:54] because every single thing is a choice
[1:19:59] the way of life is a choice
[1:20:02] coming to church is a choice
[1:20:06] going prophet said even going to hell
[1:20:08] you can choose to
[1:20:10] but god doesn't want that
[1:20:12] every single thing is a choice
[1:20:14] but it says because they have chosen the
[1:20:17] narrow way
[1:20:20] the harder way
[1:20:23] does speak the correct and the precise
[1:20:27] decision
[1:20:28] and it is my way
[1:20:32] now the way of god are not easy ways
[1:20:36] the word of god is
[1:20:38] we are we we are like in the army we are
[1:20:40] being trained we are rugged people we
[1:20:43] are here to trust completely in god we
[1:20:47] don't rely on our might we don't rely on
[1:20:49] who what we have we rely completely on
[1:20:52] god
[1:20:54] amen he said because i chosen this
[1:20:56] narrow way it is my way
[1:21:01] he said and because
[1:21:03] of this momentous decision
[1:21:06] a huge another benefit coming a huge
[1:21:10] portion at heaven
[1:21:16] see working with god comes with benefits
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:22] because they're choosing this a huge
[1:21:25] portion of heaven is waiting for thee
[1:21:29] what a glorious decision
[1:21:32] amen which is a hard decision
[1:21:37] you can be shy i know many brothers and
[1:21:40] sister who has been shined by their
[1:21:42] family to believe the word of god
[1:21:45] many of them i know
[1:21:47] you'll be mocked
[1:21:51] you
[1:21:52] you'll be called all kind of names
[1:21:55] it's a harder way
[1:21:57] but it's a
[1:21:59] precise
[1:22:00] and good decision
[1:22:02] and it's god's way
[1:22:04] that i want god's way to be my way
[1:22:07] i don't want my way i want god's way
[1:22:10] because if it's god's way it's god's
[1:22:12] leading if it's god leading i know
[1:22:14] exactly where i'm going i know my
[1:22:16] finality is secure i know where i'm
[1:22:19] going because god is the one who's
[1:22:21] leading me
[1:22:22] amen
[1:22:25] say what a glorious decision that's made
[1:22:28] he says
[1:22:30] this in itself
[1:22:33] which will give and make come to pass
[1:22:36] the tremendous victory
[1:22:39] in
[1:22:40] the law of divine
[1:22:42] that way the victory lies
[1:22:45] when
[1:22:46] we completely surrender to god
[1:22:50] when we completely surrender to god
[1:22:52] when you completely give it to god
[1:22:55] all your problems all your need all
[1:22:59] every single thing just give it to god
[1:23:02] don't keep that lord by yourself you're
[1:23:05] going with this lord every single time
[1:23:07] oh your mind your the battle of the man
[1:23:10] all your things of the past all these
[1:23:12] things just take that lord give that to
[1:23:14] the feet of jesus christ
[1:23:17] you see jesus was invited one time
[1:23:20] to the simon the pharisee
[1:23:24] he invited him the prophet said he
[1:23:26] invited jesus to mock him
[1:23:30] but when he arrived
[1:23:34] there
[1:23:35] this woman
[1:23:36] this prostitute
[1:23:38] say this is my opportunity
[1:23:41] i'll go
[1:23:43] i am choosing this i'll be choosing this
[1:23:46] hardaway
[1:23:48] everybody will be mocking me here
[1:23:50] this is my only time
[1:23:52] this is my own opportunity
[1:23:54] i don't know when i will see jesus again
[1:23:58] so i will do every single thing i can
[1:24:01] if they mock me that will be all right
[1:24:04] but at least i want to be at the feet of
[1:24:06] jesus
[1:24:08] if he
[1:24:09] checks me out that will be all right but
[1:24:12] i'll take my chance
[1:24:16] but look at the difference with the
[1:24:17] flankie or the men who bring the
[1:24:19] invitation uh from simon the pharisee
[1:24:23] he didn't take his chance
[1:24:25] he just arrived before the master
[1:24:28] before the lord of lords
[1:24:30] before the great i am the lord of the
[1:24:33] universe you're right he said jesus my
[1:24:36] master simon this the pharisee invited
[1:24:40] you
[1:24:41] and then he turned back the prophet said
[1:24:44] wow
[1:24:45] look at this man
[1:24:47] he didn't take a chance
[1:24:49] but this woman
[1:24:50] he was shining all town
[1:24:54] every single one knows him knew him
[1:24:57] he could not even go to the well in the
[1:24:59] morning he was going at 11.
[1:25:02] because every single one would laugh at
[1:25:04] him if he got seven because this is a
[1:25:06] prostitute look at this prostitute look
[1:25:07] at this process now he was going
[1:25:10] at 11. but look at god's mercy our god's
[1:25:14] grace is unlimited
[1:25:16] he just went by that time that she was
[1:25:18] there he meet with jesus at 11. he says
[1:25:22] oh give me water give me water
[1:25:25] say it's not customary for us to give
[1:25:28] you water and say no if you knew who you
[1:25:31] were talking to you will ask me whatever
[1:25:34] ever you see god is looking for when you
[1:25:36] have the seed of god in you it doesn't
[1:25:38] matter
[1:25:40] god who's reaching mercy
[1:25:42] it gives you an opportunity
[1:25:44] every single time is an opportunity that
[1:25:47] depends on our choices
[1:25:49] and this woman comes
[1:25:51] to simon's house
[1:25:53] and then he arrived
[1:25:55] he took his chances
[1:25:57] and then they didn't minister to jesus
[1:25:59] or anything
[1:26:00] and then she comes
[1:26:02] she got she bought she bought the
[1:26:03] perfume
[1:26:04] and she come
[1:26:06] and then she run
[1:26:09] he said master do you know what kind of
[1:26:11] woman this is
[1:26:14] jesus i didn't say anything
[1:26:16] she was ministering
[1:26:18] she was crying
[1:26:19] she wiped his
[1:26:21] feet it's a woman
[1:26:23] your many sins
[1:26:25] are
[1:26:26] second hallelujah god who's richard
[1:26:29] mercy
[1:26:30] should he take a chance
[1:26:33] to go and meet the master
[1:26:35] amen
[1:26:36] because every single thing is a choice
[1:26:42] you have to choose
[1:26:44] if you don't choose
[1:26:46] god is a gentleman
[1:26:48] he give us choices
[1:26:50] see one time brother billy paul
[1:26:53] says this testimony says
[1:26:55] when he was like a teenager or something
[1:26:57] you want to run away from the house
[1:27:00] or you want to go deep with grandma
[1:27:02] because you want to go here and there
[1:27:04] the prophet says i say
[1:27:06] i extend my hand like this
[1:27:10] say okay now which way do you want to
[1:27:12] choose
[1:27:15] everything is a choice
[1:27:17] which way you want to choose
[1:27:19] hallelujah you need to choose
[1:27:21] right you see
[1:27:23] emma's three three the bible say can two
[1:27:24] work together except they agree
[1:27:28] you cannot walk together if you're not
[1:27:30] agreeing now when you're working with
[1:27:32] jesus christ
[1:27:34] you'll be agreeing
[1:27:35] because we'll be ministering to you
[1:27:37] be speaking to you it should be an
[1:27:39] agreement it should be a contract
[1:27:41] because record when you are signing a
[1:27:43] contract both of you agree contract is
[1:27:45] not a dictatorship
[1:27:49] you see the
[1:27:51] centurion romans come to jesus say
[1:27:53] master
[1:27:55] my servant is sick
[1:27:57] did i say okay you want me to go to your
[1:27:59] house say no i don't
[1:28:02] i am a master
[1:28:03] i have people under me if i said to this
[1:28:06] guy he goes if i said to that one goes
[1:28:08] he goes i know also if you speak the
[1:28:11] word
[1:28:12] if you speak the word i know that my
[1:28:14] servant will be healed you see now the
[1:28:17] centurions was having much more
[1:28:19] revelations because he knew that jesus
[1:28:22] was having power over sickness power
[1:28:24] over he or over every single demons he
[1:28:27] was the master of the wind he know every
[1:28:30] single condition he can do anything he
[1:28:33] is god it's unlimited god he can do
[1:28:37] anything
[1:28:39] so this this
[1:28:40] centurions were standing there
[1:28:43] say master
[1:28:45] i i don't it was it was entering a
[1:28:48] contract with god
[1:28:50] a divine contract with god
[1:28:53] so you just said something
[1:28:55] he didn't believe
[1:28:58] in replacement
[1:29:00] because he could replace
[1:29:02] this servant
[1:29:04] he was not his brother
[1:29:06] he was not his son or daughter
[1:29:09] was she was a servant
[1:29:11] he could say do you have do you have a
[1:29:13] cousin who can take your place
[1:29:15] or do you have your nephew can take your
[1:29:17] place
[1:29:18] i have my business need to be running
[1:29:20] here
[1:29:21] no
[1:29:22] he didn't believe in replacement
[1:29:24] but to believe in restoration
[1:29:26] because god is always restoring
[1:29:29] god is always restoring
[1:29:32] he said i shall restore all the years
[1:29:35] all the years
[1:29:36] god will restore if your memory is fed
[1:29:39] in god will restore your memory if your
[1:29:41] your
[1:29:42] your health is fading god will restore
[1:29:45] your health if anything is failing god
[1:29:48] will restore your head look at job job
[1:29:51] was a man working with god he was
[1:29:54] working with god he was obedience to god
[1:29:57] he was surrendering every single thing
[1:29:59] to god he was giving gifts he was he he
[1:30:03] was a perfect man he was a believer
[1:30:08] amen
[1:30:09] and the devil was not happy with that
[1:30:14] say look at job
[1:30:16] look at him
[1:30:18] because you bless him you do all these
[1:30:20] things
[1:30:21] god say no
[1:30:23] i know what is inside of job
[1:30:26] i know what's going on with him
[1:30:28] now
[1:30:30] god
[1:30:31] restore
[1:30:32] every single things to job
[1:30:35] because our god
[1:30:37] is a god of restoration
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:42] our god is a god
[1:30:44] of restorations
[1:30:46] praise the lord in the message there's
[1:30:49] only one way provided by god
[1:30:51] for anything
[1:30:53] i even like the taro
[1:30:56] there is only one way
[1:30:59] provided by god for anything
[1:31:03] prophet says
[1:31:05] enoch needed a ladder one day
[1:31:08] he had walked 500 years with god
[1:31:12] and pleased him
[1:31:14] he needed a ladder god provided him
[1:31:18] a highway
[1:31:22] walk right up home
[1:31:25] elijah needed a rope
[1:31:28] one time
[1:31:29] and god gave him a chariot with horses
[1:31:32] to it
[1:31:34] amen oh my god
[1:31:36] praise the lord
[1:31:38] samson needed a spear
[1:31:40] and god gave him a jawbone of world mule
[1:31:45] now
[1:31:46] if samsung will have said
[1:31:49] lord
[1:31:51] joe born
[1:31:54] i need a spear
[1:31:57] because the element of the finish time i
[1:31:59] think
[1:32:00] i need the spirit to go straight to them
[1:32:03] that is men reasoning
[1:32:05] your ways are not god's ways
[1:32:08] god said my ways are above your ways
[1:32:13] samsung was thinking spears better but
[1:32:16] for god's jawbone was the better and
[1:32:18] then he said i'll give you a job on and
[1:32:20] then with that job on it destroy one
[1:32:23] thousand more whatever more philistines
[1:32:26] because when god lily's match when god
[1:32:29] is in it he can
[1:32:31] god is the one who orchestrated all
[1:32:33] these things he said you see samsons
[1:32:37] beat down
[1:32:38] a thousand philistines
[1:32:40] with it
[1:32:42] god provided
[1:32:44] god provides your needs
[1:32:47] god has a way
[1:32:50] amen
[1:32:51] god has a way
[1:32:56] for our needs
[1:32:59] god has a way
[1:33:01] it doesn't matter how long that takes
[1:33:04] it doesn't matter the conditions
[1:33:07] it doesn't matter say i have pray i pray
[1:33:10] i pray i don't know lord i don't know
[1:33:12] how to pray no more i pray i pray no god
[1:33:16] does have
[1:33:17] a way
[1:33:21] the ways of god
[1:33:23] when you fully surrender to god
[1:33:27] when you fully give it all
[1:33:30] when you're fully committed to god
[1:33:33] god will take over amen
[1:33:36] god will take over
[1:33:38] it doesn't matter how long that takes
[1:33:40] that's right
[1:33:41] you're trusting god
[1:33:43] because god is working on both hands
[1:33:46] god is working on both hands
[1:33:48] you see the prodigal son
[1:33:51] he went away
[1:33:52] but when he went away
[1:33:54] god was already working inside of him
[1:33:58] maybe he's my son i don't understand oh
[1:34:01] lord i've prayed for a long time
[1:34:05] i pray lord i pray god say
[1:34:07] be still
[1:34:09] and know that i am god
[1:34:11] i have my ways
[1:34:13] i have my ways
[1:34:15] i'll bring that son back to you that's
[1:34:17] right i bring that child back to you
[1:34:19] i'll do the miracles i am god i am a god
[1:34:23] of paradox i work miracles i am a
[1:34:27] paradoxical god i will do things that
[1:34:29] above your mind above even your thinking
[1:34:32] i am god you need to trust in me you
[1:34:35] need to obey my way you need to fully
[1:34:37] surrender to me
[1:34:39] and then when this prodigal son went and
[1:34:42] then when he arrived there and then one
[1:34:44] day he stood up and said oh my father's
[1:34:46] house is better than here
[1:34:48] it's god was dealing with him even when
[1:34:51] he was there
[1:34:54] god was dealing with him in whatever he
[1:34:56] was doing he was doing maybe do this
[1:35:00] i don't think this is right but yeah
[1:35:02] because we have so many people i will
[1:35:04] just do it but i don't think this is
[1:35:05] right
[1:35:07] god was dealing with him amen
[1:35:10] his father was praying
[1:35:12] lord my son
[1:35:13] one day
[1:35:15] my child
[1:35:16] lord i just trust i don't know how that
[1:35:18] will happen
[1:35:19] praise the lord it's already done
[1:35:22] prayers changes things
[1:35:25] prayer changes even the mind of god
[1:35:28] and then one day
[1:35:30] that boy comes back say master
[1:35:32] i'm just going back to my father
[1:35:34] i think at my father's house this better
[1:35:37] thing than here
[1:35:40] god who's working in both hands
[1:35:43] amen
[1:35:45] praise the lord
[1:35:46] he says
[1:35:47] from i thought not your thoughts neither
[1:35:50] your ways my ways
[1:35:51] said the lord
[1:35:53] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:35:56] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:35:59] ways and i thought my thoughts then your
[1:36:03] thoughts
[1:36:04] amen
[1:36:05] we see that
[1:36:07] when we walk with god when we walk with
[1:36:10] god
[1:36:12] our god
[1:36:13] is
[1:36:15] taking the preeminence
[1:36:17] on us
[1:36:20] it's taking the prayer in us
[1:36:22] so when you take the premise
[1:36:25] you're becoming our guide
[1:36:28] through the holy ghost
[1:36:30] it's guiding you
[1:36:31] now the holy ghost is witnessing to you
[1:36:34] amen you see sometimes you may even
[1:36:36] drive in the road and then you feel i'm
[1:36:38] not going this way
[1:36:39] i'm going this way
[1:36:41] the holy ghost is working and then he
[1:36:43] says oh there were a bad accident right
[1:36:45] there
[1:36:46] god
[1:36:47] the holy ghost is so real
[1:36:50] as the time goes on it's so real the
[1:36:53] presence of god is so real and then you
[1:36:56] just feel the power of god inside of you
[1:36:58] that quickening power the power of most
[1:37:01] must most god inside of you and then
[1:37:04] it's guiding you okay so the bible says
[1:37:06] here he said therefore leaving the
[1:37:08] principle of the doctrine of of christ
[1:37:11] let us go unto perfection
[1:37:14] not laying again the foundation of
[1:37:16] repentance
[1:37:17] from dead works and fifth of god of
[1:37:20] doctrine of baptism and of laying off
[1:37:23] hand and of resurrection of the dead and
[1:37:26] eternal judgment and this will do if the
[1:37:28] lord permits
[1:37:30] because we need to come up higher
[1:37:35] god
[1:37:36] is requiring perfection
[1:37:41] by his word
[1:37:42] only by the word of god
[1:37:45] amen
[1:37:47] god
[1:37:48] is making us access
[1:37:51] the world
[1:37:53] of the supernatural
[1:37:56] then he says
[1:37:57] revelation 19 verse 9
[1:38:00] and he said unto me right
[1:38:03] bless
[1:38:04] are they which are called at the
[1:38:06] marriage supper of the lamb
[1:38:08] and he say unto them
[1:38:10] these
[1:38:12] are the true saying
[1:38:14] of god amen
[1:38:16] we are blessed when god calls us
[1:38:20] it's a true saying of god
[1:38:22] you are blessed when god calls you
[1:38:24] when you come
[1:38:26] you're already blessed
[1:38:28] because when you god calls you
[1:38:30] it comes with a package of benefit
[1:38:34] and that package covers every single
[1:38:36] benefit
[1:38:38] every single need is in that package
[1:38:41] because god has already done it
[1:38:43] amen
[1:38:45] amen
[1:38:47] praise the lord
[1:38:49] say
[1:38:51] i
[1:38:53] am
[1:38:54] not worthy to come to your house that
[1:38:56] the
[1:38:57] central roman are saying
[1:39:00] i am not worthy
[1:39:02] but only god is worthy
[1:39:04] revelation chapter 5. let us read that
[1:39:08] amen
[1:39:11] revelation chapter 5 verse 1 the bible
[1:39:13] says
[1:39:15] it says
[1:39:16] and i saw
[1:39:18] in the right hand of him
[1:39:21] that set on the throne a book written
[1:39:25] within and on the backside seal with the
[1:39:27] seventh seal
[1:39:29] and i saw a strong angel proclaim with
[1:39:31] loud voice
[1:39:33] who is ready to open the book
[1:39:37] who is west open the book and to lose
[1:39:39] the seal thereof now remember the roman
[1:39:42] centurion said to the lord
[1:39:44] i am not worthy
[1:39:48] i am not worthy but jesus here says
[1:39:51] who is worthy to open the book
[1:39:55] and they say and no man in heaven no man
[1:39:58] in earth under the earth was able to
[1:40:00] open the book neither to
[1:40:02] look thereon
[1:40:04] or a book you cannot even look at it he
[1:40:07] said i went much because no man
[1:40:10] was found worthy to open
[1:40:13] and read the book neither to look
[1:40:15] thereon and one of the elders said unto
[1:40:17] me whip not
[1:40:20] be they lie on the tribe of judah the
[1:40:23] rule of david has prevailed to open the
[1:40:27] book and to lose the seal thereof
[1:40:32] and then on verse 8 it says and when he
[1:40:34] has taken the book
[1:40:36] the phobias and the four and twenty
[1:40:38] elders fell down before him the lamb
[1:40:41] having everyone there abs
[1:40:45] and golden
[1:40:47] veils
[1:40:48] full of others yes
[1:40:52] which are
[1:40:54] the prayers of the saints
[1:40:59] prayers changes things
[1:41:02] every prayer that you have been prayed
[1:41:05] says it was full
[1:41:07] of
[1:41:08] others which are the prayers
[1:41:12] of the saints
[1:41:14] so all the prayer of the saints were
[1:41:16] there and when this opens
[1:41:20] it was the time
[1:41:22] that all prayers
[1:41:24] when you pray to god
[1:41:26] just believe
[1:41:28] only believe
[1:41:30] all things are possible
[1:41:32] to them that believe
[1:41:34] you are already committed to god
[1:41:36] and god
[1:41:38] is faithful
[1:41:39] our god is faithful
[1:41:41] to make it happen
[1:41:43] amen
[1:41:45] praise the lord
[1:41:47] we praise the lord
[1:41:49] i'll read one more things here
[1:41:51] it says here he said they say come in
[1:41:54] just love here to teach the word
[1:41:57] and the pharisees and so forth but there
[1:41:59] was something about your teaching that
[1:42:01] was different
[1:42:03] talking about jesus christ
[1:42:05] he says
[1:42:06] and once inside the door
[1:42:09] maybe a humble heart no matter how
[1:42:12] humble it was but never to humble to for
[1:42:15] him to come in
[1:42:18] when you invite god
[1:42:20] it doesn't matter
[1:42:22] amen doesn't matter look abraham
[1:42:26] the bible says abraham hear many
[1:42:28] talk to god many times
[1:42:31] hear god voices many times
[1:42:34] but in revelation chapter 8
[1:42:36] genesis chapter 18
[1:42:38] now god
[1:42:39] was going to abraham amen
[1:42:42] now this time was god
[1:42:45] coming to abraham
[1:42:47] and abraham was to minister to god
[1:42:50] because in
[1:42:51] genesis 18 that was abraham standing up
[1:42:54] lord you need to rest i need to go
[1:42:57] bring this i need to come with this
[1:42:59] sarah can you bring this and then and
[1:43:02] then all these times
[1:43:04] god
[1:43:05] abram was telling sarah
[1:43:07] i have heard the voice of god
[1:43:09] god has spoken to me today
[1:43:11] god has by this time
[1:43:13] god come and sarah can hear god himself
[1:43:16] speaking
[1:43:20] amen because now sarah must also have
[1:43:22] the same rapturing faith like abraham
[1:43:25] you must have the something like enoch
[1:43:27] you must be also receiving the same word
[1:43:31] the same rapturing faith that abraham
[1:43:34] was having
[1:43:36] because god is taking care of each and
[1:43:39] every one of us
[1:43:41] all our prayers
[1:43:43] every single thing we hear
[1:43:46] when we totally surrender and committed
[1:43:48] to god
[1:43:49] god will take care of it
[1:43:51] just depend on our choices
[1:43:54] what are we choosing
[1:43:56] what are we choosing
[1:43:58] amen
[1:43:59] as i'm finishing here reading book of
[1:44:02] luke chapter 22 verse 18 the bible says
[1:44:06] for i say unto you
[1:44:08] are not drink of the fruit of the vine
[1:44:11] until the kingdom of god shall come
[1:44:15] john 6 44 says jesus therefore answer
[1:44:17] and say unto them not among yourself
[1:44:21] no man can come to me
[1:44:24] except
[1:44:26] the fathers
[1:44:27] which ascend me
[1:44:30] draw him first
[1:44:35] so only the father can draw you first
[1:44:39] he's the one who can call you first like
[1:44:42] enoch worked with god he pleased god and
[1:44:45] god took him
[1:44:48] because no man can come to god
[1:44:50] except god draw him first so if you are
[1:44:54] here this morning god has drawn you
[1:44:56] first if you believe god god is the one
[1:44:58] who has drawn you first if you trust in
[1:45:00] god is god doing these things because no
[1:45:03] man can come to me except my father draw
[1:45:07] him first hallelujah is that why enoch
[1:45:10] worked with god
[1:45:12] and then he was not
[1:45:14] because god took him
[1:45:19] in another way god draw him up higher
[1:45:22] said john come up higher no man can come
[1:45:25] to me
[1:45:26] except my father
[1:45:28] draw him first
[1:45:30] oh what almighty god we serve
[1:45:32] because he's the one who's doing all
[1:45:34] these things
[1:45:35] he's the one who draw you
[1:45:37] say draw me near to you lord i want to
[1:45:39] be much more closer to you
[1:45:41] than i have been before
[1:45:43] that is our god
[1:45:45] that is the god who we are serving
[1:45:48] the lord of the bible
[1:45:50] the same yesterday today and forever it
[1:45:52] never changes it's still the same god
[1:45:55] if you ever need if you have a situation
[1:45:58] if you have a load
[1:46:00] give it to the hand of christ
[1:46:02] give it to the feet of the cross
[1:46:04] it's here
[1:46:06] it can meet on it it can meet our
[1:46:07] problem it is god it's more taking care
[1:46:11] of us than we think he is keeping us
[1:46:13] more than we can even imagined
[1:46:15] like he is he's he is like the brothers
[1:46:18] in ukraine that's the brother you see
[1:46:20] god is taking care of his children
[1:46:24] he's taking care of his children
[1:46:26] no man
[1:46:28] can come to him
[1:46:29] except him throw him first
[1:46:31] that's why we are here that's why you
[1:46:33] have that longing
[1:46:35] of listening to the word of god
[1:46:37] longing to come to church
[1:46:39] longing to fellowship
[1:46:41] longing to praise god
[1:46:43] you
[1:46:44] that is god doing that is god
[1:46:48] calling you god attracting you attention
[1:46:52] god is the one who's doing all these
[1:46:53] things
[1:46:55] benefit of working with god
[1:46:57] there's so many benefit for working with
[1:46:59] god
[1:47:00] god will give you a clear vision
[1:47:02] god will show you what to do
[1:47:04] when you are confused
[1:47:06] my people shall never be in confusion no
[1:47:08] more
[1:47:09] god will straighten everything out
[1:47:11] god will make a thing right
[1:47:14] because he is god
[1:47:16] because he's taking care of us
[1:47:19] benefit of working with god
[1:47:21] introduce us
[1:47:23] in the world of possibilities
[1:47:25] in the world of sunnah supernatural
[1:47:28] because that is the way god is
[1:47:31] is so natural for him to be supernatural
[1:47:34] it's so natural for him to be
[1:47:36] that god who's provided all this benefit
[1:47:40] because that's exactly what you want to
[1:47:41] do
[1:47:43] shall we stand this morning
[1:47:46] praise the lord
[1:47:50] see
[1:47:52] when you get in this contract divine
[1:47:54] contract with god
[1:47:57] god will keep his part of the contract
[1:48:00] see the prophet speaking about the
[1:48:02] chinese laundry man
[1:48:04] see they'll cut this piece of paper in
[1:48:06] two
[1:48:07] they give you one you go with one
[1:48:10] every single one is keep is
[1:48:12] and god is always keeping his part
[1:48:15] very faithfully
[1:48:17] why
[1:48:18] whenever you left him you'll find him
[1:48:22] whenever you left god
[1:48:24] you'll go back and you'll find him look
[1:48:26] at the ten lepers
[1:48:28] they come
[1:48:30] they ask god can you kill us
[1:48:32] and then god healed all of them and then
[1:48:34] they went
[1:48:36] only one or two come back
[1:48:39] and then when they come back
[1:48:42] they found jesus
[1:48:44] where they left
[1:48:45] that's what the bible says
[1:48:47] they found jesus where they left
[1:48:51] you say
[1:48:52] where are the nine where are the rest
[1:48:55] you see
[1:48:57] where you left god you'll find
[1:48:58] him because he's keeping his part of the
[1:49:01] contract
[1:49:02] like this chinese laundry man
[1:49:04] so you bring yours
[1:49:06] then you bring ease
[1:49:08] okay perfect
[1:49:10] that's what god is doing
[1:49:12] our god is working mightily inside of
[1:49:14] the believers
[1:49:15] it's working inside of us
[1:49:17] it's it's dealing with us
[1:49:19] it's giving us solution to our needs of
[1:49:22] our problems our situations
[1:49:25] is still the same
[1:49:26] still acting
[1:49:28] the only thing you want
[1:49:30] a full surrender
[1:49:31] a full commitment
[1:49:34] a full commitment to god the prophet
[1:49:36] said enoch
[1:49:38] you know walk with god means enoch obey
[1:49:42] every word of god yes that's why the
[1:49:44] prophet said enoch obey
[1:49:46] every single word of god he says enoch
[1:49:50] walk with god
[1:49:52] whatever god says
[1:49:54] enoch never missed one word
[1:49:59] he walked with god
[1:50:02] what was he he was a son of god
[1:50:05] he was an ego
[1:50:07] that has been called
[1:50:09] to that day
[1:50:11] when you fully surrender to god
[1:50:14] when you fully give yourself to god
[1:50:17] because only god
[1:50:20] is able to do anything
[1:50:22] it can change these situations he can
[1:50:24] it's the master of the wind
[1:50:26] he can check the circumstances in our
[1:50:28] lives
[1:50:29] because that's what he want to do
[1:50:32] prophet says the blessings of god are
[1:50:33] here
[1:50:35] we just need to lift our hair
[1:50:38] and grab all those blessings
[1:50:40] because that's what god wants us to do
[1:50:43] because we have the benefit
[1:50:45] of walking with god like in the natural
[1:50:49] if you find a work they give you a
[1:50:51] benefit package but this package is
[1:50:54] limited but god package is unlimited
[1:50:58] because faith is unlimited is giving you
[1:51:03] many things it's it
[1:51:05] there's no impossibility with god the
[1:51:07] impossibility doesn't exist with god
[1:51:10] every single thing is possible to them
[1:51:12] that believe and then if you believe you
[1:51:15] can see the glory of god
[1:51:17] and that by faith many
[1:51:19] have a good report we talk about enough
[1:51:22] we talk about all this warrior in the
[1:51:24] book of
[1:51:25] hebrews 11 by faith by keeping their
[1:51:29] part of the contract by trusting
[1:51:31] completely in god don't be dismayed
[1:51:33] don't be dismayed don't be discouraged
[1:51:36] but stand on the promises of god when
[1:51:39] you stand on the promises of god god is
[1:51:41] able god is faithful god will keep it
[1:51:45] part of the contract because he's
[1:51:47] faithful
[1:51:48] that is our god that is who he is he's
[1:51:51] still the same he's still acting in 2022
[1:51:55] because
[1:51:57] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:52:00] forever
[1:52:03] praise the name of the lord
[1:52:05] that is our god
[1:52:07] that is our message because this message
[1:52:11] the finality of it
[1:52:13] it's god dwelling in the believers it's
[1:52:16] not only
[1:52:17] on the book on the tape on the prophet
[1:52:20] that's good that i am in but god won't
[1:52:25] come and dwell inside of us now we may
[1:52:28] do the same thing again because the
[1:52:30] bible says what was in god he put in
[1:52:33] christ and what was in christ he put it
[1:52:35] in the believers now the believers
[1:52:38] become the representation of god now
[1:52:40] when they see you they see mrs jesus
[1:52:42] christ you have the same word you have
[1:52:45] the same power you have the same benefit
[1:52:47] now you can talk like god you can speak
[1:52:50] like god you can believe like god you
[1:52:52] can sing like god because oh it's god
[1:52:56] doing the benefit of working with god
[1:52:59] because enoch worked with god and he was
[1:53:02] so pleasing to god and god draw him
[1:53:05] higher
[1:53:06] amen
[1:53:07] oh it's good to be in church brothers
[1:53:10] because that's when god is speaking
[1:53:12] that when god is dealing with heart that
[1:53:14] when god is spilling to your inside man
[1:53:17] that man that is feeding on the word
[1:53:19] because the holy ghost when he comes he
[1:53:21] gives you the power to believe his word
[1:53:24] that's what our god is doing
[1:53:26] amen
[1:53:28] praise be the name of our lord
[1:53:30] shall we bow our head as we go the lord
[1:53:32] in prayer
[1:53:34] amen
[1:53:36] thank you lord
[1:53:40] father we thank you this morning
[1:53:43] no man has come to you
[1:53:46] except you draw him first
[1:53:48] and we are here because you have called
[1:53:50] us father
[1:53:51] we believe your word
[1:53:54] enoch walk with you
[1:53:57] and we are walking with you tonight
[1:53:59] today
[1:54:00] because you are our god once again
[1:54:03] we thank you for your grace
[1:54:05] if there's any need
[1:54:07] there's any situation
[1:54:09] if there's anything further
[1:54:12] we believe your world
[1:54:14] we are more than
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:19] able to receive every single thing we
[1:54:21] ask in jesus name
[1:54:23] just commit the remaining of this day
[1:54:26] and this word
[1:54:27] for your own glory
[1:54:29] jesus christ we pray
[1:54:31] amen
[1:54:33] amen god bless you benefit of working
[1:54:37] with god hallelujah introduce us
[1:54:40] to the supernatural
[1:54:42] amen when we walk with god amen
[1:54:45] introduce the supernatural
[1:54:47] it's real friend yes it is it's real
[1:54:50] you just need to obey god
[1:54:52] don't be wary not wary
[1:54:55] faith
[1:54:56] where is the enemy of faith
[1:54:58] when you pray committed to god
[1:55:01] doesn't matter how long that will take
[1:55:04] god is working
[1:55:06] on both hands
