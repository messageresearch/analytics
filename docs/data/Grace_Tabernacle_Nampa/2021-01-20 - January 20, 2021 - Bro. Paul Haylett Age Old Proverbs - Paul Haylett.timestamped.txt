[30:44] god in the valley still god in the

[30:51] [Music]
[30:55] life is easy
[30:59] when you're up on the mountain
[31:10] [Music]
[31:14] but then things pay when you're down in
[31:19] the valley
[31:22] oh don't lose faith
[31:26] cause you're never alone
[31:30] for the god on the mountain
[31:35] is the god in the valley
[31:39] when things go wrong
[31:44] he'll make the pride
[31:48] and the god of the good times
[31:52] is still god in the bad times
[31:57] god of the day
[32:01] is the god in the night
[32:05] we talk of faith when
[32:10] we're upon the mountain
[32:13] [Music]
[32:20] [Music]
[32:23] but it's down in the valley
[32:26] [Music]
[32:29] temptations
[32:32] that's when faith
[32:39] [Music]
[32:41] of the is
[32:44] is the god in the valley
[32:48] when things go wrong
[32:53] he'll make them run
[32:57] and the god of the good time
[33:01] is the god in the bad times
[33:06] the god of the day
[33:13] [Music]
[33:18] is still gone in the valley
[33:23] when things go wrong
[33:27] oh he'll make them right
[33:31] and the god of the good kind
[33:35] is still gone in the bad times
[33:50] hallelujah amen aren't you just happy we
[33:53] serve a god like that
[33:56] you know when brother branham preached
[33:58] god's chosen place of worship
[34:02] you know i i just was
[34:05] reading in that sermon just a few days
[34:07] ago and
[34:09] you know you think about it
[34:12] some have mecca
[34:15] somehow here they're yawn they must go
[34:18] there
[34:18] to worship all we got to do
[34:22] is just go into the presence of god in
[34:24] his word
[34:25] amen we don't need another place to
[34:27] worship just in his word
[34:29] amen and and it just stirs my heart
[34:32] makes me happy
[34:34] you know although you know it might not
[34:37] be bad to have an excuse to travel
[34:38] halfway around the world
[34:40] or something you know to to do that but
[34:43] we realize it's
[34:45] not that spot many many people just
[34:48] reading a little deal
[34:50] in the past years how many people go
[34:53] to israel and they go to golgotha hill
[34:56] they go to these different sites
[34:59] and it's very profound because there is
[35:01] a great multitude that says
[35:03] it was a life-changing event to me and
[35:06] others
[35:07] simply refer to it as a nice visit
[35:11] to historical places and i'm glad our
[35:15] god is not historical
[35:17] i'm glad that we don't have to go look
[35:19] in a tomb we don't have to go to
[35:21] golgotha hill we don't have to
[35:23] walk those streets to have that
[35:25] experience happy to have my
[35:27] father-in-law brother kevin with us
[35:29] this evening god bless you and each and
[35:31] every one of you
[35:32] amen sister sophie sister grace i i
[35:36] intended to um
[35:39] send brother manasseh a text today and
[35:42] then
[35:43] the wheels fell off the wagon and i got
[35:46] preoccupied with other things and i i
[35:48] didn't but
[35:49] i'll do my best to do that tomorrow i
[35:52] want to speak to you tonight
[35:54] on age old proverbs
[35:57] and maybe a little different kind of
[35:59] service tonight
[36:01] if you don't mind just to
[36:04] go back i've been reading in the book of
[36:06] proverbs and uh
[36:08] reading all over the book of proverbs i
[36:10] i kind of tend to have a shotgun effect
[36:13] i guess and
[36:14] you know it's just my there's just so
[36:18] much wisdom amen i look at that and i
[36:21] think
[36:22] hey maybe go to the top of the page and
[36:24] we can scratch out when they thought it
[36:26] was preached and we can put
[36:29] 21st century amen put it right down to
[36:32] 2021 because it's just
[36:35] such a a beautiful portion of scripture
[36:39] and um so if we'll just stand we will
[36:43] go to the third chapter starting with
[36:46] the first verse
[36:47] and uh we'll just go down through these
[36:50] and then i'll take just a few minutes
[36:52] kind of to
[36:54] visit i guess the thoughts that come to
[36:56] me when i
[36:57] was reading this and then felt inspired
[37:00] to
[37:01] to speak on it proverbs
[37:04] the third chapter starting with the
[37:05] first verse my son
[37:09] forget not my law
[37:13] now i want to just put this in a context
[37:16] we live under the dispensation of grace
[37:21] we're not picking on the denominational
[37:23] world right
[37:24] phrase right now is we're no longer
[37:26] under the law we're under grace
[37:29] forgetting that jesus said i didn't come
[37:32] to do away with the law
[37:34] i come to fulfill it amen
[37:37] so we know that there is a place for us
[37:41] to hold to the law and right here
[37:44] in proverbs 1 my son
[37:47] forget not my law but let thine
[37:51] heart keep my commandments that's the
[37:53] only place we're going to keep it
[37:55] amen the flesh cannot keep it
[37:59] for length of days and long life and
[38:01] peace
[38:02] shall they add to thee let not mercy and
[38:05] truth forsake thee
[38:07] bind them about thy neck and write them
[38:10] upon
[38:10] the table of thine heart so shalt thou
[38:14] find favor and good understanding in the
[38:16] sight of god
[38:17] and man trust in the lord with all thy
[38:21] heart
[38:22] and lean not unto thy own understanding
[38:26] in all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[38:29] shall
[38:30] direct thy past be not wise
[38:33] in thine own eyes and you know saints uh
[38:36] you know i like to be transparent
[38:39] sometimes we just have a certain thing
[38:42] a certain idea certain whatever and we
[38:45] feel like we do that so well we
[38:47] articulate it so well
[38:49] we feel like we have a better grasp than
[38:51] anyone
[38:52] around us until we don't
[38:59] is it amazing how god has a way of
[39:01] saying oh
[39:02] wait i got a son over here i need to
[39:05] humble him just a little bit amen
[39:10] you know and i'm going to put this
[39:11] figuratively right that root
[39:14] that you've been anointed and been led
[39:16] to and
[39:17] and been preached to and and drawn to
[39:20] sawing that thing
[39:21] out but it's always maybe tomorrow or
[39:24] next week or next month or next year or
[39:26] i'll just learn to step over
[39:28] that weakness god says i think it's
[39:32] about time he hooks his toe on that
[39:35] hmm i know one thing all mature
[39:38] christians say amen to that
[39:40] you know it simply is there god knows
[39:43] how to keep us
[39:44] humble amen be not wise in thine
[39:48] own eyes fear the lord and depart from
[39:51] evil
[39:52] it shall be health to thy navel and
[39:54] morrow to thy bones
[39:56] honor the lord with thy substance and
[39:59] with the firstfruits of
[40:01] all thine increase so shall thy
[40:04] barns be filled with plenty and thy
[40:06] presses shall burst
[40:08] out with new wine my son despise not the
[40:12] chastening
[40:13] of the lord neither be weary
[40:16] of his correction heavenly father we
[40:19] just ask you to come tonight
[40:21] and lord just ask you as we would look
[40:23] through this
[40:24] let it be an encouragement to us a
[40:26] reminder of the wisdom father that you
[40:28] have given
[40:29] to your children in this day father
[40:32] bless the word the reading of the word
[40:34] the presence of your saints father in
[40:36] our worship in the name of jesus
[40:38] christ amen you may be seated
[40:43] now as we would look at this saints i
[40:45] would like to just kind of go back
[40:47] through
[40:47] so if brother alex would take us back to
[40:50] uh verse
[40:51] 1 i want to just go back through and
[40:54] just kind of
[40:54] preach our way through this and then i
[40:56] have a couple other little things i want
[40:58] to add on the end of it
[40:59] but he says forget not mine law we kind
[41:01] of touch that
[41:02] but let thy and hearts keep my
[41:04] commandments and my brother and sister
[41:06] just as i've been preaching to you these
[41:08] last couple sundays
[41:09] we realize as it is the issue that
[41:12] balaam had
[41:13] was the fact that while he said one
[41:16] thing
[41:16] to the lord and kind of spoke out and
[41:19] let it be known around him what his
[41:20] motive was
[41:22] god knew the desire of balaam's heart
[41:25] and so all the rest of the fluff you
[41:27] might say all the rest of the
[41:30] story as it were was really irrelevant
[41:33] because the one factor that god judged
[41:35] it by
[41:36] was balaam's heart and i say that god
[41:39] knows you and i and i pray tonight that
[41:42] every one of us is our heart
[41:43] is focused more on god's will than our
[41:46] own amen
[41:47] because when we get focused on our own
[41:49] will my brother and sister we start to
[41:50] be
[41:51] lifted up as it would be in verse seven
[41:53] we find ourselves you know thinking that
[41:55] we've got an answer
[41:57] uh to something you know many years ago
[41:59] i realized it was the chastening of the
[42:01] lord it was god
[42:03] you know bringing me to a place that i
[42:05] would have to trust him
[42:06] uh many years ago we have been going
[42:09] along very successfully on the farm
[42:11] earning a good money and i i remember
[42:15] this is the problem saints is i know the
[42:18] time the place the circumstance
[42:20] by which i stepped you might say out of
[42:24] god being in control
[42:25] and i i declared i thought i was in
[42:28] control and
[42:29] i remember making a statement to a
[42:31] gentleman how
[42:32] you know i think we finally figured this
[42:34] farming thing out and
[42:36] uh been making good money the very next
[42:39] year we lost over a hundred thousand
[42:42] dollars just vaporized out of our life
[42:44] we had crops it froze in the early days
[42:47] of september
[42:48] uh totally killed crops and it turned
[42:51] into a
[42:52] seven eight year uh disaster of us
[42:55] constantly just trying to paddle fast
[42:57] enough
[42:58] to stay in front of the bill collectors
[43:00] and and the bank and etc
[43:02] and you know saints i share that don't
[43:04] worry about the money that's all behind
[43:06] us don't worry about the thing
[43:07] i i share that because i want you to see
[43:10] that even
[43:11] god will let us as sons and daughters of
[43:13] god
[43:14] we'll step out of bounds instead of
[43:16] letting us
[43:17] go see i hope you don't mind me putting
[43:20] it this way
[43:21] he let balaam go he let balaam go on to
[43:25] his own hearts desire
[43:27] but we are the bride of christ can we
[43:29] say amen he
[43:30] will not let us go so we can expect
[43:34] a corrective action to come into our
[43:38] life because he's going to put us back
[43:40] where we belong and so i just share that
[43:43] because i
[43:44] experience that and no it doesn't do any
[43:46] good to
[43:47] not speak the words if you think it in
[43:49] your mind or your heart right
[43:51] so i then have figured out that i am not
[43:55] much of a farmer without god's blessings
[43:57] upon my crops
[43:59] amen and when god blesses me he blesses
[44:01] me very well
[44:02] amen and i'm thankful for that then i
[44:05] realized that just one stroke of an
[44:07] event
[44:08] the earliest freeze in 30 years
[44:15] think that all them other farmers got
[44:17] hurt so god could teach me a lesson
[44:21] i say that kind of laughingly but i say
[44:24] it sincerely
[44:26] god wanted to teach paul a lesson
[44:29] so we see my brother and sister if we're
[44:31] looking i i always sorry my mind goes in
[44:34] the avenue that it goes in
[44:36] i'm not apologizing for that it's just
[44:38] sometimes hard to follow
[44:40] but you see i i see all through the
[44:42] scripture
[44:43] a whole business plan do you know if
[44:45] you're a young man and you want to start
[44:46] a business
[44:47] just start right here in this great
[44:48] business plan right here
[44:50] amen now if you think i'm a little
[44:52] carnal i can take you to the prophet
[44:54] where he says words like
[44:56] you know i pray god just blesses your
[44:57] business and blesses your commerce and
[45:00] these kind of things so my brother and
[45:02] sister let's not get hyper spiritual
[45:04] and trying to stay so humble because
[45:08] i say this my dad for years said now
[45:10] paul when people say they're humble
[45:11] they're not so let's just be honest
[45:15] humble right just not view ourselves any
[45:18] higher than we would
[45:19] but look at this plan now my brother and
[45:21] sister that we're starting to look at
[45:22] here
[45:23] we forget not god's laws in other words
[45:25] we put god
[45:26] first right seek ye first the kingdom of
[45:28] god all the rest of this will be added
[45:31] unto you so this plan if you just uh
[45:34] humor me for a moment this business plan
[45:36] is not forget the things of god not
[45:38] forget god's plan not forget god's way
[45:41] but let thine heart keep the
[45:43] commandments get up every day thank god
[45:45] for everything you got
[45:46] amen you know i i just saints uh it
[45:49] might seem silly to some people
[45:51] but i was doing a little bit of work and
[45:53] i was kind of struggling to
[45:54] to get something to work right and then
[45:58] all of a sudden boom it just works right
[46:00] and you know
[46:01] something struck me in the heart and i'm
[46:03] not boasting i just want to share from
[46:05] my heart if that's all right
[46:07] and something just spoke to my heart and
[46:09] i stopped right there and said thank you
[46:11] lord
[46:12] amen it wasn't a matter of i finally got
[46:15] it together
[46:16] to make it work i thank you lord
[46:19] i can struggle i can struggle i can
[46:21] struggle and when the lord comes and
[46:23] moves
[46:24] it works perfectly and so it's there my
[46:27] brother and sister
[46:28] for length of days and long life and
[46:30] peace
[46:31] shall they add to thee
[46:35] that don't sound like an adversary does
[46:37] it
[46:38] that doesn't sound like something put
[46:40] there to keep you knocked into line
[46:43] that sounds like something that god says
[46:45] you honor what i've put in place
[46:47] and i'm going to bless you amen with
[46:50] length of days long life and peace
[46:52] this is what my brother and sister what
[46:54] a remarkable difference
[46:56] in the world today when a great bulk of
[46:59] christianity
[47:00] views the law as behind them they're not
[47:02] subject to it any longer
[47:04] it's behind them but it was there just
[47:06] to bind us and we're so happy we're
[47:08] under grace
[47:08] but yet they realized while they
[47:10] couldn't fulfill the law
[47:12] even under grace they're not covered
[47:17] i don't say that judgmental right but
[47:20] you see
[47:20] grace is not for disgrace grace
[47:24] is for the redeeming factor of sons and
[47:27] daughters of god
[47:28] needing the encouragement needing the
[47:31] help
[47:32] needing that that uh filling up and
[47:34] leadership
[47:35] and god says i come right down i'll walk
[47:37] with you even when you're walking
[47:39] through the mud i'll walk with you
[47:40] you might have got out of my perfect
[47:42] will but you can walk in my permissive
[47:44] will
[47:44] and i will bring you back to the perfect
[47:46] will of god
[47:48] amen so we look at the blessings that
[47:50] coming
[47:51] he said let not mercy and truth forsake
[47:54] thee
[47:54] i tell you saints i sometimes i i feel
[47:57] bad i don't know how you feel about it
[47:58] maybe i shouldn't ask you how you feel
[48:00] about it
[48:00] but you know what i just can't
[48:02] constantly and i'm not going to use
[48:04] derogatory words but i'm telling you i
[48:06] just constantly
[48:07] feel like i'm just pounding on you take
[48:09] it back to the bible take it back to the
[48:11] bible take it back to the bible take it
[48:12] back to the bible
[48:13] amen does that get old
[48:17] amen you see my brother and sister
[48:19] because
[48:20] we're here to not let mercy and truth be
[48:23] forsaken
[48:24] amen that is the very pillar or platform
[48:28] of what the prophet's message was it
[48:30] wasn't my brother or sister so much to
[48:32] come
[48:33] and say now this is the mystery of this
[48:35] and this is that
[48:36] but if we never get back to the bible
[48:39] truth we never get down to the
[48:41] foundation of the bible amen all of the
[48:44] great mysteries revealed
[48:45] will just go over our head amen we're
[48:48] going to have that relationship with
[48:49] christ
[48:50] first amen to have any kind of
[48:53] relationship to build on
[48:55] so when we do that you know it's like
[48:57] the superficial marriage
[48:59] now my brother and sister they took this
[49:00] all the way to the supreme court many
[49:02] years ago
[49:03] a man and a woman getting married but
[49:04] have no relationship
[49:06] amen after a period of time in this
[49:09] particular case the man
[49:11] says um we're not married we don't have
[49:13] a relationship
[49:14] it went all the way up through the
[49:15] courts became a big deal my brother and
[49:17] sister unless a relationship
[49:20] is consummated
[49:23] come on unless that relationship becomes
[49:26] personal it's not a relationship
[49:30] amen that's why it's very important for
[49:32] us to to
[49:33] bind this about our neck
[49:37] amen i'm telling you now i've never been
[49:39] much our sisters
[49:40] some of you wear necklaces and whatnot
[49:42] uh you know when i was in high
[49:44] school uh we won't go back into that too
[49:47] far but
[49:48] you know it was a cool thing for all the
[49:49] guys wearing necklace so i
[49:51] i got me a little necklace and i tried
[49:54] wearing it and
[49:55] well anyway i know some of you are just
[49:57] cringing at that visual image
[50:00] but look i so wanted to be cool
[50:03] that i looked like a fool
[50:07] and i'm sorry this is just personal
[50:10] don't worry about it you want to wear a
[50:11] necklace brother
[50:13] but i i just have a struggle when i see
[50:16] a brother with a necklace i just
[50:20] i just feel like walking up and saying
[50:24] that's so pretty
[50:27] but i don't but you see we find
[50:31] ourselves in positions sometimes but
[50:34] god wants us to bind this around our
[50:36] neck my brother and sister why it means
[50:37] it goes everywhere we go
[50:39] it's there as a constant reminder now if
[50:41] i could just envision
[50:42] this uh much like a a a a tie
[50:47] it's there it's there and it reminds you
[50:50] it's there
[50:51] you bend over it's there you stand up
[50:54] it's there
[50:54] i see sisters often times you know just
[50:58] the normal things of life your sisters
[51:00] know what i'm talking about you'll go to
[51:02] move your hair
[51:03] and you have to put a finger in that
[51:05] necklace and get it separated out of
[51:07] your hair before you can pull your hair
[51:08] out
[51:09] so it is very much intertwined into your
[51:12] daily life
[51:13] now am i getting the point to you amen
[51:16] so here it is see you put this around
[51:18] your neck
[51:19] it becomes such an integrated daily part
[51:23] of your
[51:24] life now you can go back in history and
[51:26] find there's certain other historical
[51:28] things that are connected to that
[51:29] i want to just put it into that simple
[51:31] spiritual place
[51:33] god wanted it to be so close to you you
[51:35] never forgot
[51:36] it amen it wasn't like maybe our bible
[51:39] we laid it down
[51:40] you know whatever reminds me of brother
[51:44] he's a deacon in a church he told me one
[51:45] time he says you know you just have to
[51:47] wonder sometimes the way people will
[51:48] come
[51:49] and uh had this individual come to him
[51:51] and say you know
[51:53] brother i misplaced my bible
[51:57] the other day would is it here at the
[51:59] church would you know
[52:00] and he said yeah brother it's here at
[52:01] the church he said brother he said that
[52:04] bible been in the deacon's office
[52:06] for about seven or eight months but he
[52:09] had just
[52:10] misplaced it the other day you know
[52:13] the phraseology god doesn't want us to
[52:15] misplace this word right
[52:17] so much so bind it around thy neck and
[52:19] write them upon the table of the heart
[52:21] now i'm going to use brother trevor uh
[52:24] for for an example
[52:25] now as it is my brother and sister
[52:27] brother paul can't come here
[52:29] and decide to write upon the table of
[52:31] brother trevor's heart
[52:32] amen i i don't have that privilege even
[52:35] if i wanted to assert myself
[52:37] i don't have that privilege to tell him
[52:40] what to bind
[52:41] or write upon the table of his heart so
[52:43] we find that that is a very once again
[52:46] very personal experience that we take
[52:50] and hold these certain truths and those
[52:53] truths will
[52:54] lead us all i believe into the rapture
[52:56] but certain things would be different
[52:58] for you
[52:59] than they are for me amen maybe my
[53:01] childhood my upbringing
[53:03] would have certain events take place and
[53:05] when god would come and move in a
[53:07] certain way
[53:07] that is anchored deep within my heart it
[53:10] is carved right to the very core
[53:12] and for you it might be a little
[53:14] something different but what it is
[53:16] is we're coming to the place that we
[53:18] ourselves
[53:19] are submitting to the word and do not
[53:22] want to be set free from it
[53:24] there's the key we don't want to be set
[53:27] free from
[53:28] it we want to be indelibly marked by the
[53:31] holy ghost
[53:32] that it would never no matter we just
[53:34] sang the song tonight i really
[53:36] appreciated god's leadership there
[53:38] it don't matter if we're on the mountain
[53:40] or we're in the valley
[53:42] we will ultimately realize we've been
[53:45] indelibly marked by the word of god
[53:47] and no matter how we would view ourself
[53:50] and how
[53:50] weak we think we have become the day
[53:53] will come that that
[53:54] marking or that engraving upon the heart
[53:56] will once again
[53:57] be revealed and when that is revealed we
[54:00] rise right up out of the ashes as it
[54:03] were
[54:03] and we stand up and lift our hands and
[54:05] the devil will be saying you're a
[54:06] hypocrite
[54:07] and we'll be saying no i'm forgiven amen
[54:10] i'm not a hypocrite god knows
[54:12] my heart amen see it all comes back to
[54:16] that god knows my heart
[54:17] not what you remember i shared with you
[54:20] saints that just a little inspiration
[54:21] came that day
[54:22] satan's got the xerox copy of your sin
[54:26] but he don't have your sin so he can
[54:29] come along and say you did this you did
[54:31] this you did this you did this you did
[54:33] this
[54:34] but you can come back to him and say
[54:36] that is nothing but a
[54:37] copy my sin is under the blood of jesus
[54:40] christ
[54:41] amen and so therefore satan has nothing
[54:44] he can't bring
[54:45] an indictment to you on something that's
[54:47] merely
[54:50] hearsay
[54:53] so we find favor and good understanding
[54:56] in the sight of god and man see
[54:58] what what's working here my brother and
[54:59] sister you will find that a son or
[55:01] daughter of god
[55:02] fully serving god will find favor
[55:05] wherever they go
[55:06] in life i know that is a personal
[55:10] experience you will find favor i didn't
[55:13] say it was easy
[55:15] i didn't say it makes it a cakewalk but
[55:17] i'm telling you you can
[55:18] find favor in the eyes of man out here
[55:23] by first finding favor in the eyes of
[55:26] god
[55:28] once again if i can take you back to my
[55:30] experience of life
[55:32] there was a time in my life i thought if
[55:34] we farmed enough ground and made enough
[55:36] money i could have employees and i would
[55:38] be free to serve god
[55:39] and i jumped right into that trap and we
[55:42] were farming a lot of ground and we were
[55:44] doing things
[55:45] and i'll tell you what happened saints i
[55:47] would come from church
[55:49] on sunday afternoons and hardly eat
[55:51] lunch change my clothes and go to work
[55:53] to fix the problems
[55:55] you see but the day come oh hallelujah
[55:58] can i just kind of
[55:59] thank the lord here i hope you don't
[56:01] mind the day come
[56:03] when this disaster struck our farm and
[56:05] the people we worked with said you know
[56:07] we really want somebody else to do that
[56:08] work and i was like what they betrayed
[56:11] me
[56:11] but little did i know it was the hand of
[56:13] god coming down
[56:15] and took all of that away from me
[56:18] and uh i don't know how to put it sounds
[56:20] carnal forgive me
[56:22] our income didn't really change
[56:28] why i finally put a priority
[56:32] and god granted favor because
[56:35] i said no i'm putting god first
[56:39] i'm going to church on sunday i'm not
[56:41] letting this control my life i'm going
[56:42] to church on wednesday nights it's not
[56:45] controlling my life
[56:48] and god said i'll find favor now i'm not
[56:51] peddling the idea that
[56:52] my money is the whole sum total of
[56:56] finding favor with god
[56:59] but god knew what my situation was see
[57:02] so you can find
[57:03] favor and good understanding in the
[57:04] sight of god men trust in the lord with
[57:06] all that heart and lean not to that
[57:08] understanding i don't even need to
[57:09] preach that one do you
[57:10] do i you know here again every time we
[57:13] think we've got an answer for something
[57:15] god comes along and says sorry i've
[57:17] already covered that
[57:19] i've got chapter and verse amen if
[57:21] you'll just search for it you'll find it
[57:24] amen in thy in all thy ways
[57:27] acknowledge him now my brother and
[57:29] sister take that back to what i was just
[57:31] sharing
[57:31] with you sometimes it's just trying to
[57:33] put a bolt
[57:35] through something in an awkward position
[57:37] and you can't accomplish it
[57:39] and your frustration level rises i know
[57:41] most of you probably don't have that
[57:43] problem
[57:44] amen but you know you can lay on your
[57:46] back and poke your arm up through a hole
[57:48] and try and do something and you can't
[57:50] do it you can't do it you can't do it
[57:52] and then you stop and say lord you know
[57:54] i can't do this i need you to help me
[57:55] and you reach up there and put the bolt
[57:57] in
[57:57] now my brother and sister we can go on
[57:59] and say my
[58:00] that was lucky i'm glad that happened
[58:02] that worked out fine that swell
[58:05] or we can actually come in the petition
[58:08] and say lord
[58:09] thank you thank you for what you have
[58:12] done
[58:13] thank you that car decided not to pull
[58:15] out thank you lord that my child
[58:17] who is running to the street stopped on
[58:20] the sidewalk
[58:21] thank you lord for this and thank you
[58:23] lord for that it will be
[58:24] only regulated by our desire to give
[58:28] praise to god
[58:29] amen because if we truly want to live
[58:31] and
[58:32] live it up to lift it up to him and give
[58:36] praise to him my brother and sister
[58:38] you will find your days will be filled
[58:40] with tons and tons that's not a very
[58:42] good phrase
[58:43] many many many things to give him praise
[58:46] for
[58:47] hallelujah i mean when you start to
[58:49] focus on i want to give you praise lord
[58:52] for blessing my life
[58:53] you will find the opportunities just
[58:56] come flowing
[58:57] in now let's make sure we take advantage
[59:00] of those
[59:02] not just simply putting a blanket out
[59:04] here and say well praise the lord god's
[59:05] good
[59:08] lift our voice say thank you lord
[59:20] i love and i don't think i have time
[59:22] enough tonight to go in this but i love
[59:24] how
[59:25] through the book of proverbs many of
[59:27] these things are
[59:28] connected together in ways that we don't
[59:32] necessarily even
[59:34] directly see the connection in all thy
[59:37] ways
[59:38] acknowledge him
[59:41] by that acknowledgement he'll direct
[59:44] your path
[59:48] thank you lord praise god for what he's
[59:51] doing
[59:52] good times bad times mountain valley
[59:54] wherever it might be
[59:55] amen and he's going to come and direct
[59:58] our path
[59:59] we feel directionless maybe we're not
[1:00:03] praising him enough
[1:00:04] maybe we're not giving him the adoration
[1:00:07] the praise that he deserves now saints
[1:00:10] i'm not here to rah-rah you you do what
[1:00:12] you want with
[1:00:12] it i'm just here to preach to you what's
[1:00:14] on my heart
[1:00:15] to know that these proverbs are just as
[1:00:18] effective today
[1:00:20] as they was when they were written down
[1:00:23] all those years ago
[1:00:24] in fact i'm going to be a venturist here
[1:00:28] i'm going to venture right out on the
[1:00:29] edge of the ice and tell you i think
[1:00:31] they're more effective today
[1:00:33] than they was when they were written
[1:00:35] down because we are living in the
[1:00:37] culmination of the ages
[1:00:39] culmination of the power of god the
[1:00:41] revelation of jesus christ right
[1:00:44] a son of man revealing the son of man
[1:00:47] is not my brother and sister it is
[1:00:50] foundational
[1:00:50] but it is also the pinnacle of it
[1:00:53] because we're coming to that
[1:00:55] finishing time the grand finale of that
[1:00:58] to recognize that the word being opened
[1:01:00] in this day
[1:01:02] which we have so taken advantage of and
[1:01:05] used and it's been such a blessing to
[1:01:07] our life can we say amen
[1:01:09] is they just transformed and changed our
[1:01:11] lives but my brother and sister
[1:01:13] it is also the absolute spotlight of
[1:01:17] what god
[1:01:18] is wanting us to see in this hour amen
[1:01:21] we don't need to go back into repentance
[1:01:26] we don't need now we need repentance
[1:01:27] preached pardon me young people you know
[1:01:30] i love you i'm not trying to embarrass
[1:01:31] you
[1:01:31] but until every one of these young
[1:01:33] people is
[1:01:35] baptized filled with the holy ghost
[1:01:37] serving god
[1:01:38] we're not going to give up preaching on
[1:01:41] those things
[1:01:49] but that's not the foundation of what we
[1:01:50] believe it's not just repentance
[1:01:54] we're looking for the filling of baptism
[1:01:57] of the holy ghost
[1:01:58] which means the opening of god's word to
[1:02:01] you and i god in his word
[1:02:03] in us now opening revealing the very
[1:02:06] nature of god
[1:02:07] in us the very mind of god in us amen
[1:02:10] all of those attributes now being
[1:02:13] released
[1:02:14] into a bride that should get us more
[1:02:17] excited than it usually does that should
[1:02:20] get us to the
[1:02:21] to the place that we realize that god
[1:02:23] thinks so
[1:02:24] highly of you and i he deposited himself
[1:02:27] in you
[1:02:29] hallelujah i remember reading a deal
[1:02:31] here a while back this man
[1:02:33] he one day he checked his bank account
[1:02:36] online
[1:02:37] and it said something on the order of
[1:02:38] 2.8 million dollars in his bank account
[1:02:41] and he was just like wow that's
[1:02:45] incredible and so he goes to the bank
[1:02:48] and he just kind of slightly
[1:02:50] says something to the teller about uh
[1:02:52] would you please check my
[1:02:54] balance and the teller she just takes
[1:02:56] one of them little slips and she just
[1:02:58] writes that number on it and pushes it
[1:03:00] out to him no response
[1:03:01] he's like wow this might be my money and
[1:03:04] the next morning gets up checks his bank
[1:03:06] account again and it's
[1:03:07] thirty four dollars
[1:03:11] just the difference between a zero and a
[1:03:14] one
[1:03:17] life is that fleeting
[1:03:20] but i tell you what i've got a king
[1:03:23] for a father for a husband however you
[1:03:26] want to
[1:03:26] what wording you want to do he said i've
[1:03:29] got a cattle on a thousand hills
[1:03:31] i've got all of these things for you
[1:03:33] i've got these blessings
[1:03:34] he says you know i would turn over
[1:03:36] heaven and earth
[1:03:38] before i would break my promise to you i
[1:03:41] can count on that
[1:03:42] i get up every morning of every day of
[1:03:45] the rest of my life
[1:03:46] and check the account and that promise
[1:03:49] is right there
[1:03:50] and the result of it's right there i
[1:03:52] don't have to worry about it getting
[1:03:54] spent down i don't have to worry about
[1:03:55] having a check that won't cover
[1:03:58] amen but you know it all starts
[1:04:01] that we make sure we acknowledge him if
[1:04:04] we don't acknowledge him saints
[1:04:05] come on you know what it does it causes
[1:04:09] us to start to become callous
[1:04:12] we have saints i don't know all your
[1:04:15] individual testimonies right i mean to a
[1:04:17] very intimate degree but we around the
[1:04:20] message have seen
[1:04:21] so much of the supernatural
[1:04:24] that it's become commonplace we have
[1:04:27] seen
[1:04:28] the impossible take place
[1:04:31] and we talk about it as though it was
[1:04:33] just some common thing
[1:04:35] in the evening news
[1:04:38] you know why
[1:04:41] we've become callous
[1:04:44] we're no longer moved we need something
[1:04:46] greater
[1:04:48] we need something more
[1:04:53] there was a time when we saw our
[1:04:55] children start and praise god and
[1:04:57] praying and we we just was just overcome
[1:05:00] with emotion
[1:05:04] and now we just like well i hope my kid
[1:05:07] gets saved
[1:05:08] doesn't go the world
[1:05:11] why we're becoming
[1:05:14] callous there was a time we stayed up
[1:05:18] into the wee
[1:05:18] hours praying for one another over
[1:05:21] sickness and situation
[1:05:23] now we throw out a quick prayer
[1:05:27] and say that should cover it why
[1:05:32] we've become callous i know this isn't
[1:05:36] making us too excited tonight
[1:05:38] amen there is plenty of band-aids
[1:05:41] somewhere
[1:05:45] you see saints when we dig into these
[1:05:49] proverbs
[1:05:51] we're not just reading words of old
[1:05:54] we're reading a living word
[1:05:57] for our day a word that if we will apply
[1:06:00] it
[1:06:01] with the same that it was spoken if we
[1:06:04] let me rephrase that
[1:06:05] if we will receive it and speak it with
[1:06:07] the same anointing
[1:06:09] that was on it when it was spoken and
[1:06:11] written we will see results like we
[1:06:14] never ever thought would take place
[1:06:20] which brings us the place that sometimes
[1:06:22] we just feel like well we're message
[1:06:24] believers
[1:06:25] you know i worked in the
[1:06:30] construction field for many years and
[1:06:32] fortunately
[1:06:34] was able to cross over union lines and
[1:06:36] things like that they didn't
[1:06:38] enforce it too much but i tell you my
[1:06:41] brother and sister they never let you
[1:06:43] forget who had seniority
[1:06:46] never never never let you forget you
[1:06:49] were a young guy on a job
[1:06:51] and you were there and you were doing
[1:06:53] work and they would always do their best
[1:06:55] you find yourself running a nail gun one
[1:06:57] day and packing lumber the next
[1:07:00] because the guy that was packing lumber
[1:07:02] yesterday figured out he'd worked there
[1:07:04] longer than you
[1:07:06] so there was seniority and we start to
[1:07:09] get wise in our own eyes even around the
[1:07:11] message this might be a little rough
[1:07:13] saints i'm not trying to hurt anybody's
[1:07:14] feelings
[1:07:16] but we get a little wise around the
[1:07:18] message we start figuring out our family
[1:07:20] i've i've been in the message
[1:07:22] longer than you well i'm sorry let's go
[1:07:25] back and read the parable of the 11th
[1:07:27] hour
[1:07:28] together god has no
[1:07:31] seniority and god is no respecter of
[1:07:34] person and so when we look at this
[1:07:37] it's whether our relationship is on fire
[1:07:39] or not
[1:07:40] not how long you've been around and so
[1:07:43] and we look at that now i i don't mean
[1:07:46] disrespect anyone that's been around the
[1:07:48] message a long time
[1:07:49] but my brother and sister somebody
[1:07:51] that's just uh
[1:07:52] pardon me this sounds a little rough and
[1:07:53] i should probably shouldn't use the
[1:07:55] phrase but somebody who's old and cold
[1:07:58] doesn't have a priority
[1:08:01] that's kind of rough way to put it isn't
[1:08:03] it
[1:08:05] we don't want to become old and cold my
[1:08:06] brother and sister we want to be on fire
[1:08:08] for god amen so we want to not be wise
[1:08:11] in our own eyes
[1:08:12] we want to keep a constant fear of the
[1:08:14] lord and we want to just simply depart
[1:08:16] from evil
[1:08:17] amen don't reason the evil don't talk
[1:08:20] about dealing with it later
[1:08:21] depart from it amen
[1:08:24] and then what does he come back and he
[1:08:26] he comes right back and he puts it in
[1:08:28] this context
[1:08:29] and it shall be health to that navel and
[1:08:32] morrow to their bones
[1:08:33] you talk about he's telling us right
[1:08:34] here you'll just follow this i'm going
[1:08:36] to bless you
[1:08:38] it doesn't get any simpler than that
[1:08:40] does it amen
[1:08:42] that's just like the text i got the
[1:08:44] other day if i would
[1:08:45] say several hail marys and pass this on
[1:08:47] to 25 people
[1:08:49] i would receive a blessing in the next
[1:08:51] 24 hours
[1:08:54] so you know i i don't think this is in
[1:08:56] the same category as that
[1:08:58] honor the lord with thy substance you
[1:09:01] know i i was just
[1:09:03] i'll keep this person anonymous but i
[1:09:05] was just visiting with a brother today
[1:09:07] and we were we were talking along this
[1:09:10] line right here
[1:09:11] and uh you know honor the lord with thy
[1:09:13] substance
[1:09:14] remember the rich ruler rich young ruler
[1:09:18] comes bouncing up to jesus now this
[1:09:21] brother put it in a way that i'd never
[1:09:23] really thought about it before and i
[1:09:24] had to chuckle but he said you know he
[1:09:26] said this is just always the way i see
[1:09:28] it
[1:09:28] here come this young man full of
[1:09:30] enthusiasm he has followed every rule
[1:09:32] there is in the church and he comes a
[1:09:34] bee bopping right
[1:09:35] up to jesus and he's like hey you know
[1:09:38] what else
[1:09:38] is there for me to do have you got
[1:09:40] another checklist that i can yep done it
[1:09:42] done it done it done it done it but
[1:09:45] jesus discerned
[1:09:46] the one thing that he held in
[1:09:49] too high of favor and he said sell all
[1:09:53] thou
[1:09:53] house hit him right
[1:09:57] on the deal you know what i say lord hit
[1:10:00] me right in the hit me right in the face
[1:10:02] hit me right lord where i need to be hit
[1:10:04] if there's something there
[1:10:06] that's hindering me then lord hit that
[1:10:09] amen that's why i believe in a five-fold
[1:10:11] ministry in fact i don't have it here i
[1:10:13] don't want to make a point of it but my
[1:10:14] brother and sister i just read
[1:10:16] today where brother branham says the
[1:10:17] five-fold ministry is god's gift to you
[1:10:21] and so when he starts throwing that out
[1:10:23] we're telling god that gift wasn't good
[1:10:25] enough
[1:10:26] that's scary my i don't want to be the
[1:10:29] guy that takes god's gifts and decide
[1:10:31] whether they're good enough for me or
[1:10:33] not
[1:10:34] i want to just say lord if you send it i
[1:10:35] want to receive it
[1:10:37] amen honor the lord with thy substance
[1:10:40] see if
[1:10:40] that young man if he had just said okay
[1:10:42] lord whatever you said
[1:10:44] my look at the life he lived
[1:10:47] with the first fruits of all thine
[1:10:49] increase so shall thy barns
[1:10:51] be filled with plenty
[1:10:56] and thy presses shall burst out with new
[1:10:58] wine
[1:11:02] sounds like an awesome deal sign right
[1:11:05] up for that one
[1:11:07] but look how by the leaders
[1:11:11] of what we would say is the leadership
[1:11:12] of the holy spirit
[1:11:14] the very next verse comes and puts all
[1:11:18] of that right back in balance
[1:11:21] so we're like well praise the lord i'll
[1:11:22] just do what god said to do i'll follow
[1:11:24] these things and
[1:11:25] and my barns are going to be full my
[1:11:27] presses are going to burst
[1:11:28] and he says my son despise not the
[1:11:31] chastening of the lord
[1:11:32] neither be weary of his correction
[1:11:36] oh my brother and sister just as i
[1:11:39] brought that out
[1:11:40] earlier god's got a way of bringing this
[1:11:41] bride and lining her right back we get
[1:11:44] to drifting a little bit
[1:11:46] that's why i have confidence we don't
[1:11:47] need to browbeat a church we don't need
[1:11:49] to hammer down on you get to the altar
[1:11:51] get to the altar get to the altar
[1:11:52] my brother and sister god's got his way
[1:11:54] and his time
[1:11:55] to cause those things to happen and when
[1:11:58] he starts to move on the heart of a
[1:12:00] young man or a young woman a son or
[1:12:02] daughter of god
[1:12:03] you know god is going to take that and
[1:12:06] finish that work because he promised it
[1:12:08] so we don't have to sit here and fret
[1:12:10] and fuss and fume and
[1:12:12] all these things we just preach the
[1:12:13] gospel we live the gospel
[1:12:15] amen and we get to watch these things
[1:12:17] come to pass
[1:12:18] because i'm telling you right now saints
[1:12:20] i believe this so much that i will say
[1:12:22] this in public
[1:12:23] i believe if the prophet of god stood
[1:12:25] right here tonight he would tell you
[1:12:27] you do whatever it takes have a
[1:12:29] successful life to have a good career
[1:12:31] do whatever it is just put first
[1:12:35] he wouldn't he wouldn't talk about you
[1:12:36] know you just remain ignorant
[1:12:39] you know i'll just go out here and
[1:12:40] shovel dirt so that you don't have to go
[1:12:42] no my brother and sister
[1:12:44] our children not not be afraid to go to
[1:12:45] the university because the devil's going
[1:12:47] to deceive them
[1:12:48] our children ought to go in the
[1:12:49] university saying satan get out of my
[1:12:51] way
[1:12:52] amen that's the kind of embracing the
[1:12:55] kind of environment
[1:12:56] that we should present to our church to
[1:12:59] our children
[1:13:00] that they can stand on this because
[1:13:02] these proverbs my brother and sister
[1:13:03] have power
[1:13:05] this word of god is not there just to
[1:13:07] fill up the pages of a bible
[1:13:09] these are powerful antidotal if that
[1:13:12] would be the right word
[1:13:13] you can take this what i mean by
[1:13:15] anecdotal let me back up i don't know if
[1:13:17] i use that
[1:13:18] right but you can take that and just
[1:13:19] pull that right out and apply it to me
[1:13:22] i don't have to go and say now now can
[1:13:25] this
[1:13:25] apply to me no it's god's word i'm a son
[1:13:29] of god
[1:13:29] your sons and daughters of god it
[1:13:31] applies to me
[1:13:33] amen now the only part of the bible that
[1:13:34] don't apply to you saints is the one
[1:13:36] that sends people to hell
[1:13:39] amen that don't apply to us hallelujah i
[1:13:42] thought i'd get an amen of that
[1:13:46] now look at this let me just go on here
[1:13:48] now
[1:13:50] one of my favorite scriptures
[1:13:53] revelations 19 6 7 8.
[1:13:57] i actually sorry about that brother alex
[1:13:59] i i guess i only wrote six down
[1:14:03] as i heard as it were the voice of a
[1:14:04] great multitude of voice of many waters
[1:14:07] the voice of mighty thundering saying
[1:14:08] hallelujah
[1:14:09] for the lord god omnipotent reigneth
[1:14:13] amen now i want to make an emphasis here
[1:14:16] so just let me go ahead and pull this
[1:14:17] up on my own deal so i'm not um
[1:14:21] i already got busted my brother jason
[1:14:24] tonight
[1:14:25] i asked him about a song and he's like
[1:14:27] paul that's two songs you've put
[1:14:29] together
[1:14:32] so um i just thought maybe i should
[1:14:35] probably read this for
[1:14:36] what it is as i heard as it were the
[1:14:39] voice of great multitude in the voice of
[1:14:41] many waters
[1:14:42] as a voice of mighty thundering saying
[1:14:44] hallelujah
[1:14:45] for the lord god omnipotent reigneth
[1:14:49] let us be glad
[1:14:54] and rejoice and give honor
[1:14:58] now saints am i just out here on my own
[1:15:01] or does this not parallel perfectly
[1:15:04] proverbs 3 that we were just in right
[1:15:06] there
[1:15:08] see it comes and it ties it together so
[1:15:10] this bride of this day
[1:15:12] is coming into a position she is
[1:15:15] fulfilling the words of the prophets of
[1:15:17] old the words of wisdom of old and is
[1:15:21] coming now and it's been made real to
[1:15:23] her
[1:15:24] and she's able then to realize the power
[1:15:26] contained
[1:15:27] in the word i'm telling you my brother
[1:15:30] and sister
[1:15:31] it's a it's a it's a powerful thing when
[1:15:34] you recognize
[1:15:35] not when somebody else does when not
[1:15:37] when a prophet says that
[1:15:38] the power that's in the word the
[1:15:40] preacher says but when you recognize the
[1:15:42] power that's in the word
[1:15:44] it's a life-changing event amen because
[1:15:47] the devil can't shake you there because
[1:15:49] then you can
[1:15:50] truly reach out and say it is written
[1:15:53] because you've experienced that
[1:15:55] it's not just words on a page amen i can
[1:15:57] tell you right now
[1:15:58] just reciting words from a page of your
[1:16:01] bible to the devil
[1:16:03] will not hinder the devil at all when it
[1:16:06] is a personal experience that the words
[1:16:10] of that page
[1:16:11] have come to life to you then the devil
[1:16:14] starts getting concerned
[1:16:16] because he knows something's been
[1:16:18] released and the power of that word has
[1:16:20] now been dispersed in you
[1:16:22] amen and so he then says wait this
[1:16:24] person knows this
[1:16:26] as reality not as writing
[1:16:29] but as reality
[1:16:36] i'll keep that thought to myself amen
[1:16:40] now look at this let us be glad and
[1:16:42] rejoice give honor to him
[1:16:43] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[1:16:48] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:16:52] now look at this event that is taking
[1:16:54] place my brother and sister
[1:16:56] now i want to tie if i could this
[1:16:57] evening real quick i want to tie that
[1:16:59] back to the story of the
[1:17:02] the armor uh meet and the young lady
[1:17:05] and the promise to come back for her now
[1:17:07] my brother and sister
[1:17:08] she endured a lot
[1:17:12] of harassment she
[1:17:15] actually lived in a hostile
[1:17:18] environment
[1:17:22] you know hostility does
[1:17:26] any of you worked in a hostile
[1:17:28] environment
[1:17:30] i've worked in a hostile environment in
[1:17:32] the construction trades
[1:17:34] where every day somebody mocks something
[1:17:36] about you
[1:17:37] watch out guys he's fixing to pray for
[1:17:40] his food
[1:17:42] that's right and i'll pray for you too
[1:17:44] bud
[1:17:45] after a while they shut up they didn't
[1:17:47] like having their name called out that
[1:17:49] they were going to be prayed for it it
[1:17:50] somehow embarrassed them
[1:17:53] but i'll tell you what happens if you're
[1:17:55] not careful a hostile environment
[1:17:58] causes you to be callous
[1:18:01] what is this environment out here it's
[1:18:04] not friendly
[1:18:05] it's not friendly it's hostile and what
[1:18:08] satan wants to do is get you and i
[1:18:10] to the place that we are callous to the
[1:18:13] moving of the spirit of god
[1:18:15] now when that tender breeze blowing
[1:18:18] through the mulberry bush
[1:18:20] we just ignored it has been blocked out
[1:18:22] because we've been
[1:18:23] so callous to the days that we live in
[1:18:25] the age that we live in
[1:18:27] and so satan so subtly has come and in
[1:18:30] his
[1:18:30] own way has caused us as christians
[1:18:34] to become a little bit thick-skinned
[1:18:42] really brother paul
[1:18:48] can i tell you what i'm thinking
[1:18:56] you know why i believe this saints
[1:19:02] i want you to stop and think when the
[1:19:05] last time
[1:19:07] was that you wept before the lord right
[1:19:14] i don't say this judgmentally i say this
[1:19:16] because i love you
[1:19:18] i'm concerned for you and i'm concerned
[1:19:20] for me
[1:19:23] satan causing us that not even in our
[1:19:26] prayer time
[1:19:28] or finding ourselves weeping and crying
[1:19:32] to the lord less and less
[1:19:36] and less
[1:19:40] am i right or wrong
[1:19:45] that's why i wanted to bring this to you
[1:19:47] you've got to come saints to the place
[1:19:49] we're aware
[1:19:51] that satan brother branham you can look
[1:19:52] it up brother brown talks about how the
[1:19:54] men
[1:19:54] so strong fists that were so strong
[1:19:57] they'd busted two before with their fist
[1:19:59] they would soak their hands in vinegar
[1:20:02] he said and would do these things
[1:20:04] to callous their fists
[1:20:07] now look what satan is trying to do he's
[1:20:09] trying to work in our midst of little
[1:20:11] disappointments and little things like
[1:20:13] that
[1:20:14] and instead of taking them and weeping
[1:20:16] before the lord and finding releaseness
[1:20:18] our hearts are slowly becoming calloused
[1:20:24] that we no longer i'm not preaching that
[1:20:27] we ought to run to the altar and all
[1:20:28] start just sobbing
[1:20:30] but i want you to be aware we're slowly
[1:20:33] but surely being callous to the place
[1:20:37] that when we enter into prayer we we
[1:20:39] don't even break through
[1:20:42] we're just praying
[1:20:47] i hope i haven't left you a sore spot
[1:20:50] but i want to leave a reality
[1:20:53] that if we're not careful we'll become
[1:20:56] so calloused as message believers
[1:20:59] we'll hear of a need and we'll just like
[1:21:01] oh lord bless them
[1:21:03] that's all we'll give into it you know
[1:21:06] sometimes the prophet of god
[1:21:09] would have needs and he would travail
[1:21:12] over those needs so strongly
[1:21:15] that god opened a channel that he could
[1:21:18] see
[1:21:18] every i want you to want you to follow
[1:21:20] this he could see everything associated
[1:21:23] with that need
[1:21:24] and that's how the prophet of god broke
[1:21:26] through
[1:21:27] into these situations where people had
[1:21:29] sin in their life and had circumstances
[1:21:32] and god wanted them delivered more right
[1:21:35] and doesn't what the prophet of god
[1:21:36] taught us he wants to heal us more
[1:21:38] than we want to be healed amen i believe
[1:21:41] we can apply that
[1:21:42] principle right across the board he
[1:21:43] wants to deliver them or deliver
[1:21:45] us more than we want to be delivered and
[1:21:48] the prophet of god would be in such
[1:21:50] travail for these people
[1:21:52] that god would let him get beyond the
[1:21:54] veil and see what was holding back their
[1:21:56] healing or their deliverance
[1:22:01] god help us god help me i'm preaching to
[1:22:04] myself tonight saints
[1:22:12] see his wife has made herself ready that
[1:22:15] young woman she was there
[1:22:17] they harassed her they heckled her
[1:22:21] but you know what didn't happen to her
[1:22:24] she didn't become callous because
[1:22:28] in becoming callous she would have
[1:22:30] determined it probably doesn't matter
[1:22:32] or not whether she has that wedding
[1:22:34] dress ready
[1:22:35] it doesn't matter or not that her
[1:22:38] attitude is good just as long as she
[1:22:39] gets out of here
[1:22:42] well my brother and sister the rapture
[1:22:44] is not
[1:22:46] an escape
[1:22:49] i want to drive that home to you the
[1:22:50] rapture is not
[1:22:52] an escape we are not here
[1:22:55] waiting for the rapture so we can just
[1:22:57] get out of this miserable mess
[1:23:00] we are here looking to the rapture
[1:23:02] because it is the culmination
[1:23:05] of a love affair culmination of a
[1:23:09] relationship
[1:23:10] and we are here saying lord i want to
[1:23:12] culminate this relationship
[1:23:14] i want to see the finale of this i don't
[1:23:18] i can't wait any longer to be in your
[1:23:20] presence
[1:23:23] because you see if we start to look at
[1:23:24] the rapture as an escape my brother and
[1:23:26] sister
[1:23:27] you will become possessed with the
[1:23:30] escape
[1:23:32] mentality
[1:23:35] you'll want to escape from your personal
[1:23:37] problems and
[1:23:38] the church problems and the family
[1:23:41] problems and the
[1:23:42] children problems we're not called to
[1:23:45] escape from it we're called to overcome
[1:23:47] it
[1:23:48] amen now god gives deliverance my
[1:23:50] brother and sister but don't
[1:23:52] mistake that deliverance as somebody
[1:23:53] coming in and solving it for you
[1:23:56] that deliverance is god's promise that
[1:23:58] you can take his word
[1:24:00] and conquer whatever situation that is
[1:24:04] hallelujah by the holy ghost oh my let
[1:24:07] me hurry along here
[1:24:09] oh my
[1:24:12] now i want to tell you right off the bat
[1:24:16] here there's two different
[1:24:17] influences here preached just a little
[1:24:19] ways apart
[1:24:20] so sign oh the sign of his coming is at
[1:24:24] hand and we know there is not a thing on
[1:24:26] earth science tells us it's three
[1:24:27] minutes till midnight
[1:24:29] told us that several years ago then we
[1:24:31] must be just about maybe a moment from
[1:24:34] midnight
[1:24:35] we don't know what time the the powder
[1:24:38] is going to lighten the keg
[1:24:40] look at this election coming up here
[1:24:42] tomorrow
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:46] that's all it would take this light one
[1:24:52] my brother and sister we're seeing
[1:24:54] unprecedented times
[1:24:57] we're seeing the ones on the left doing
[1:25:00] things
[1:25:00] and the ones on the right doing things
[1:25:03] and the other saying you're evil we're
[1:25:05] good
[1:25:06] when the truth of it is it's all evil
[1:25:10] when the truth of it is there is
[1:25:12] corruption
[1:25:14] rooted to the very bottom all the way
[1:25:16] through it
[1:25:18] amen now i'm not going to
[1:25:22] make something out of this unless god
[1:25:24] would reveal it
[1:25:25] but a brother did send out a picture
[1:25:28] showing
[1:25:28] kamala harris at her inauguration today
[1:25:32] and
[1:25:32] she's dressed in purple
[1:25:36] you can go right in the message and see
[1:25:39] the prophet of god says
[1:25:41] now we're not making her that but i'm
[1:25:43] telling you there's all kinds of signs
[1:25:45] to get our attention
[1:25:47] we're not going to just grab that and go
[1:25:48] running off through the woods screaming
[1:25:50] but i'm telling you we're seeing signs
[1:25:53] like never
[1:25:54] before amen we're seeing signs saints
[1:25:58] now i i don't fault anyone who got some
[1:26:00] kind of stimulus type thing
[1:26:02] you know what i mean don't don't
[1:26:03] misunderstand me but
[1:26:05] we're living in a day i was going to
[1:26:07] bring you quotes tonight and i thought
[1:26:08] my i'm going to be too long anyway
[1:26:10] we're living in a day my brother and
[1:26:11] sister the united states just doubled
[1:26:14] its national debt
[1:26:15] in four years it's in the trillions upon
[1:26:17] trillions
[1:26:18] and they want to do bailouts right now
[1:26:21] that are in the trillions
[1:26:24] and the profit of god says wait they're
[1:26:25] already bankrupt
[1:26:27] living on taxes that won't be collected
[1:26:30] for 40
[1:26:31] years
[1:26:35] that means they just barely paid those
[1:26:39] you see what's happening just another
[1:26:41] sign of the time
[1:26:43] now if you've got a stimulus check your
[1:26:44] account amen
[1:26:46] pray over the thing just in case they
[1:26:48] sent a spirit with it
[1:26:50] and go on because prophecy says it's
[1:26:53] bankrupt already so
[1:26:55] you taking your stimulus check is not
[1:26:57] contributing to something that's already
[1:26:59] done
[1:27:00] amen in fact i heard a brother say oh
[1:27:02] don't worry about that that's just
[1:27:04] taking money from the devil but
[1:27:08] we just don't he meant that positive
[1:27:13] look at the election coming up here
[1:27:15] tomorrow that's all it would take just
[1:27:17] light one when that radar screen picks
[1:27:19] up that atomic bomb every one of them is
[1:27:20] going to turn loose
[1:27:22] but the church
[1:27:27] will be gone before that time
[1:27:32] so if that could happen any minute and
[1:27:34] the church has to go before that happen
[1:27:37] how far off
[1:27:42] a twist of those words how far is it off
[1:27:46] amen so think about that my brother and
[1:27:48] sister
[1:27:50] and the very things that he said would
[1:27:52] happen
[1:27:54] and his ministry would take place in the
[1:27:56] last days we watch it
[1:27:58] night after night day after day saying
[1:28:00] the time is at hand
[1:28:01] oh we ought to humble ourselves and get
[1:28:04] in
[1:28:05] humility and get into action
[1:28:08] that's right word fulfilled
[1:28:11] should put us all in action
[1:28:19] we believe the third pool come pass i
[1:28:21] mean it's
[1:28:22] it's right in the word the prophet of
[1:28:23] god he speaks of this
[1:28:25] amen the third poll is the
[1:28:29] opening of the word
[1:28:32] the word is open hallelujah furthermore
[1:28:35] the prophet of god
[1:28:36] ties it right back and says when that
[1:28:38] third poll comes to pass that the
[1:28:39] seventh seal is open
[1:28:41] amen so we either have a closed book
[1:28:44] or we have an open book and i'll tell
[1:28:47] you i'm not going to sit here and say oh
[1:28:49] the book must be closed i'm here
[1:28:51] believing
[1:28:52] i've saw the supernatural we have saw
[1:28:55] oh my i won't even go into that tonight
[1:28:57] uh my brother and sister we just got to
[1:28:59] see the supernatural
[1:29:01] amen we've got to see the word the word
[1:29:04] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:29:06] the heart
[1:29:07] we saw that saints i have i'm not saying
[1:29:09] this boastfully
[1:29:10] but i have saw the absolute
[1:29:14] discerning of the thoughts and intents
[1:29:17] of the heart
[1:29:19] in regular church services
[1:29:25] see how god would come and cause a man
[1:29:27] to walk down an aisle
[1:29:30] and stop right by
[1:29:33] a pew of people you don't even know and
[1:29:38] speak the very words
[1:29:40] that has bound that man's soul
[1:29:43] and see him jump to his feet and scream
[1:29:46] and claim his victory amen
[1:29:49] my brother and sister you know the man
[1:29:52] that was preaching
[1:29:54] there ain't nothing special about him
[1:29:56] he's not super spiritual he's not super
[1:29:58] whatever
[1:29:59] it's god who's mindful of his people
[1:30:02] amen and we've saw god come and discern
[1:30:05] the very thoughts and the intents
[1:30:06] where a man would stand up and scream
[1:30:08] that's nothing but the truth god help me
[1:30:13] and god deliver him of that spirit
[1:30:16] hallelujah
[1:30:17] nobody's going to tell me there's
[1:30:19] something missing
[1:30:22] oh what a cursed thing that would be
[1:30:24] when a man tries to point out to a
[1:30:26] fellow that you're in the wrong
[1:30:28] and prove it to him by the word of god
[1:30:30] you're in the wrong
[1:30:32] now remember the prophet of god is not
[1:30:33] talking about opinion here
[1:30:36] and then the man because that he feels
[1:30:38] in himself he'll do what he wants to
[1:30:40] won't submit to the word and then see
[1:30:44] what happens
[1:30:46] prophet of god put it right down here in
[1:30:48] the right order
[1:30:49] when that happens then they get angry
[1:30:52] amen
[1:30:54] you notice what happened to the king
[1:30:56] leprosy broke out in his face while he
[1:30:58] was still
[1:30:59] in his anger leprosy struck uzziah in
[1:31:01] the face
[1:31:02] and the priests and those recognized and
[1:31:04] threw him out of the temple
[1:31:05] and he died a leper that great life that
[1:31:08] started out so well
[1:31:10] ended up to be a leper and cast out and
[1:31:12] had to live in a separate house out to
[1:31:14] himself
[1:31:15] all the days of his life the man that
[1:31:18] the life
[1:31:18] that god once influenced amen
[1:31:22] sister emmy would you come i say this
[1:31:24] respects
[1:31:26] we got men today on the field young men
[1:31:28] middle aged men and old men who started
[1:31:30] out on good run
[1:31:32] and tried and made good showing to god
[1:31:34] but we find them today out yonder
[1:31:36] alcoholics and broke up out there in the
[1:31:38] other away from
[1:31:39] us some of them backslid all together
[1:31:42] some of them have
[1:31:43] went money crazy some have went women
[1:31:45] crazy and married other women that
[1:31:47] wasn't their wives
[1:31:48] and all the things and disgrace that's
[1:31:50] been
[1:31:51] brought on every denomination we one
[1:31:54] can't call the other bad
[1:31:56] because we're all guilty the whole or
[1:31:58] even the denomination
[1:31:59] we found men like that that's once been
[1:32:01] influenced by god
[1:32:03] and had great influence on the to the
[1:32:05] people
[1:32:06] and yet when they felt
[1:32:10] self-sufficient
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:15] when we suddenly thought i want to tie
[1:32:18] this right back to you in my thoughts so
[1:32:20] you'll understand why i use the analogy
[1:32:22] when we suddenly thought we knew how to
[1:32:25] farm
[1:32:28] when we suddenly fought we knew how to
[1:32:31] govern
[1:32:32] the house of god
[1:32:36] we no longer needed to pray through
[1:32:38] concerning that leadership
[1:32:40] we just knew we become self-sufficient
[1:32:45] when a man gets a place where he can
[1:32:48] influence for god
[1:32:50] he ought to humble himself all the time
[1:32:55] constantly let that be our prayer saints
[1:33:00] humble ourself before the lord to be
[1:33:03] able to just lift our hearts and
[1:33:05] i want to drive this point home to you
[1:33:07] tonight
[1:33:09] if you have come to the place where you
[1:33:12] no longer weep
[1:33:13] before the lord
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:16] i just ask you stop and just ask the
[1:33:20] lord to soften your heart
[1:33:22] tenderize us once again bring us let the
[1:33:26] word
[1:33:26] come and wash over us again and again
[1:33:29] and again lord until we're soft again
[1:33:31] there's nothing to be ashamed of we
[1:33:33] don't need oh i i'm a veteran in the
[1:33:35] message
[1:33:36] i don't need to cry we're not talking
[1:33:37] about church and playing church
[1:33:39] we're not talking about what the people
[1:33:41] on that pew think of the people on that
[1:33:42] view
[1:33:43] we're thinking my brother and sister
[1:33:45] about god
[1:33:47] we're thinking about giving praise and
[1:33:49] glory and worship to our god
[1:33:51] and i say lord let our hearts be
[1:33:53] tenderized
[1:33:55] let us be so soft my brother and sister
[1:33:57] i'm not talking the human emotion i'm
[1:33:59] talking about when the spirit of god
[1:34:01] moves
[1:34:02] that we just so submit and yield into
[1:34:05] that
[1:34:05] that you just release yourself and say
[1:34:07] oh lord
[1:34:08] i love you so much your grace and your
[1:34:10] mercy lord is so sufficient because
[1:34:12] without it
[1:34:14] i would be nothing i would be lost
[1:34:18] just keep ourselves humble all the time
[1:34:22] to be able just to give
[1:34:26] all that we can give to the lord
[1:34:29] and i say this saints in a in a
[1:34:31] different way but so that you would
[1:34:32] understand
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:36] the song says the more that i surrender
[1:34:38] myself
[1:34:40] the more he takes control
[1:34:44] let's just surrender ourselves let's get
[1:34:47] over the callous nature of laodicea
[1:34:50] and get back to what it was when we
[1:34:52] first come to the lord when
[1:34:54] when our hearts were so tender that just
[1:34:56] the moving just the sweeping of the holy
[1:34:58] spirit through the church
[1:35:00] would put tears in our eyes and i don't
[1:35:02] say that from the emotional side i'm
[1:35:04] talking about
[1:35:04] from the stirring in the heart and the
[1:35:06] soul it would just bring us to that
[1:35:09] condition
[1:35:12] i just felt led tonight to
