many years ago i've had a lot of heartache had a lot of grief and woe and when i would stumble then i would humble down and there would say i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now well i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now gotta make it to heaven somehow oh the devil tapped me and he tries to turn me around [Music] he's offered everything that's got a name all the wealth i want worldly fame if i could still i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now there's nothing in the world that will ever take the place of god's love silver and gold couldn't buy his love from above but when my soul is healing and i begin to feeling his powers i can say thank you lord i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now well i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now gotta make it to heaven somehow oh

not my journey now gotta make it to heaven somehow pull the devil tammy and he tries to turn me around he's offered everything that's got a name all the wealth i want and worldly [Music] can we say amen to that amen hallelujah hallelujah well there's certain things that you can do two or four friends that you couldn't do for someone else and so brother pavel god bless you my friend and your lovely new bride if you just stand i want to make sure everybody in our large congregation knows who you are amen look at this saints brother pavel our sister joy amen hallelujah [Applause] my you can be seated i you know brother pavel i let you off easy i actually was thinking about inviting you up and having you just share a word of what it was like amen life-changing experience amen you know the prophet of god laid it out very clearly that if god could have given us anything better amen salvation and a godly mate amen two of the three greatest things that god would give to us and so we're happy to have you with us and passing through and amen praise the lord amen you know saints just thinking about this i know um hopefully i'm not speaking out of turn i think brother sergey they're going to go on a little trip to be with some family uh and we want to pray for them on their little travels whatever days that comes and our brother pavel sister joy are going to be traveling up to washington and so we just want to just remember traveling mercies i think the sister sarah and her husband our brother adam sister sarah and the family are going to be traveling to arizona in a few days and we just want the lord traveling mercies with them and anyone else who might be out so let's just go right into the word tonight have quite a bit on my mind and i just want to move right along i want to just speak to you on once again on we are witnesses and um in this in the title of uh what are what my house what our house would say about me or what my house would say about me and we just want to carry that thought a little bit further to realize my brother and sister as um god is so gracious right he puts the mirror of the word in front of us aren't you glad god's got such a beautiful mirror he puts the mirror of the word in front of us that we as sons and daughters of god will not accidentally i want you to think about this the devil would like us to overlook those things in our life he'd like us to kind of justify certain things but god puts a mirror of the word and he causes us to look into that mirror and we see some people say well it's our deficiencies you have no deficiency if you are in jesus christ you have no deficiency unrecognized potentials absolutely but no deficiency amen what my house says about me let's stand and go into the word this evening uh first corinthians the third chapter kind of lengthy here saints in a portion of these scriptures really don't apply to my thought but they're so good i just couldn't pass them over have you ever come to that portion you know did let me just share this did you know that research shows that the first three bites of anything will be the greatest sensory effect upon you everything else that you eat is in the impulse of those sensory moment are you with me that pie that cake that chocolate it's just the first bit that you're trying to meet again but your body will never actually have the same sensory reaction but that is the human element in the spiritual element every time we go into the word it is a greater experience to us than it was before nothing is a past memory nothing is oh i remember when the holy spirit moved me but that moment that the spirit is moving in our midst even tonight is a greater experience than you have ever experienced in your life hallelujah isn't that wonderful aren't you glad we don't live in the flesh amen otherwise we would be as the prophet of god said always looking back always looking back remember the meetings remember the time remember the but god has moved upon us that this moment is our moment to experience the greatest experience in jesus christ that we've ever had amen hallelujah hallelujah first corinthians the third chapter starting the first verse and i brethren oh this is pretty rough scripture okay i hope everybody you're standing up but get your seatbelts on i'd love i'm looking forward the day we meet the apostle paul hallelujah no holds barred tough as nails walk away knowing he loved you to the max and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as into babes in christ i fed you with milk can you agree with me this is pretty rough i fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it and neither yet now are you able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men for one for while one saith i am of paul and another i'm of apollos are you not carnal who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom he believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted apollos watered but god. gave the increase i love that saints right there so then neither is he that planteth anything old preachers hear this so then neither is he that planteth anything and neither is he that watereth but god that giveth the increase let us always give the glory to where it belongs amen now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together see that's a very key word right there together with god right we just been bound by the word of god directly with god come on you're bound directly this is not little me down here oh woe is me i'm not worthy i'm this i'm that no you are bound directly by the scripture by the apostle paul bound directly to god as a fellow laborer amen hallelujah hallelujah and ye are god's husbandry and this is really the start of my keith for the thought tonight ye are god's building amen according to the grace of god which is given unto me we don't have a laodicean revelation which is jesus christ there's our foundation now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones would haze stubble see how this is declining every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is lord we ask for your blessings upon this evening upon your word in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated saints now as i said paul speak speaks pretty straight to the church and as he's there he's telling him i couldn't even speak to you i couldn't even come to you in a spiritual element i had to come to you and bring this down at the base level and so it's there as he is speaking he's speaking now my brother and sister let's not be ashamed uh the worst thing we can do as christians as as even as new uh christians babes in christ is to try to impersonate a mature christian it is it is nothing to be ashamed of if there's things of the scripture and the struggles of life that we simply recognize i'm not coming to a maturity and instead of acting like we're great and spiritual my brother and sister we should just simply say you know what uh god's still working on me but i'm telling you he's not done with me yet he hasn't left me behind and i love that how the prophet of god you know that man come and said i did this and i did that and then i went back out in sin and i don't even know brother branham what to do and and there's another example of a young woman i don't even know and brother branham tells them very simple he said if there's a yearning in your heart if there's a desire in your heart then god's not finished with you amen i love that simple thing because i don't know about you there was times in my life when i thought you know i know i didn't i i know i didn't blaspheme but surely you know after you crash the car so to speak enough times they're not going to let you drive any longer but you know the lord comes back and there's something a song service tonight touched my heart thinking you know what there it is i i have stumbled i have fallen i have you know struggled but there's something inside that's always stirring always moving nudging us forward you know as it would be the voice get up get up if you read about those that experience the baton death march in the philippines and there's many of these stories i remember reading a very moving story this man says the only reason i'm alive today is there was a fellow another soldier that was a friend of mine and when i collapsed on the road and they were coming and they would ban at them and he said this man was there and he would tell them i am your friend and in the name of friendship stand up how about we be that to one another as brothers and sisters in christ we we want to just come on get back up you stumbled but get back up and keep walking because there's something that god has for us to do now he says here i fed you some milk and i fed you uh you know not really with meat but you know here here's because th this thing that is you know the gospel as it would be you can't handle it do you really understand the depth of that indictment if i preach the message of the hour to you straight you can't handle it that's pretty rough aren't you glad tonight we're not boastful we're just declaring what the word said but aren't you glad tonight that you can hear the word preach it don't need to be watered down it don't need to be buttered up you can hear it preach direct it can come down as it were even pierce you to the very depths of your soul and you would say oh lord forgive me that is something in my life and what do you do you come back for more you don't become offended you don't say well i've i've eaten i'll come back when i'm i'm you know need to feed again no there's something in you that you come back and my brother and sister i want to take from the word tonight and emphasize to you that's nothing less than the holy ghost in you because otherwise we in the human element would say this is just too rough this is too abrasive i want more milk well i mean you can do a lot of things with milk amen you can butter up are you with me and then you can make ice cream out of it to soothe our spirit you can make some of those sweet cream pies but does it bring maturity there's no maturity no matter how sweet we butter this up it brings no maturity and paul just threw it right in their face said you know and you're not even ready for it now so what this is saints i want you to move over tonight i was afraid brother trevor he was just stomping all over things i got nervous brother jay stumped all over things i was getting nervous but you look at this my brother and sister now look at what happens is what paul's really saying to them is you lack maturity this is not some special revelation my brother and sister we can recognize a lot of things in the word of god and not live to that standard it takes maturity and we say oh lord why can't i do this it takes maturity amen you know people think we're going to get to heaven as it were this is kind of the metaphorical thought that people have and everybody's going to be just down but i'm telling you you get to heaven and you're going to meet veterans you're going to meet battle scarred sons and daughters of god who have fought satan on every front can i say that and drive it home to you if there's something in your life that you're struggling with they have fought satan on every front and they won hallelujah that's the kind of people we're going to meet when we get there and but here's the thing that's so beautiful when they see you as it were metaphorically walking into heaven they're not going to see a bunch of lily white oh praise the lord they're going to see battle scarred veterans their own self oh praise the lord thank you lord unless of course you don't want to pray for patience maybe you won't have that scar on you no i'm here to tell you you'll have that scar whether you wanted it or not amen anybody praying lately for patience hallelujah i have to admit i have been and i i sometimes i get up in the morning and i say lord what was i thinking but i tell you what it's working amen so look at this now he's telling them you got to you're lacking maturity and look how he quantifies this now the word quantify i use that quite a bit my brother and sister but you see what he's doing is he's taking measure of their position and and showing them where you are now my brother and sister if you're standing at a scale for height or a scale for weight or you've got a measuring cup in your hand you can't take a measuring cup and and uh and and fill it full and say i have one cup and i'm going to claim this as a whole gallon it don't work it is what it is right so you take measure and you see this and and he says you know the reason i know you're lacking maturity and i want you to think about this saints the reason i know that you're lacking maturity that you're still carnal is because i can look around and see envy and strife and divisions isn't this interesting he didn't come on bear with me he didn't come and put a measurement on all the sisters skirts you know and the knee and hair and this and that and he didn't look in that my brother and sister he he didn't have to go that deep he saw envying strife and division and it says look you guys are immature have you ever noticed that when we get right get anointed of the holy ghost all the other little peripheral things just fall right in place i remember time talking to a brother and he was talking about he said and brother brown talks about this only he was dealing with the denominational spirit which we shouldn't have to but you know a brother was telling me goes oh just i'm preaching about clothes in our church all the time and it just seems like it gets worse and we were just visiting i'm good enough friends with this brother and i just said you know brother um maybe you know country folk you know i'm talking about maybe you're barking the wrong tree if we get the holy ghost in all the rest is take care of itself don't do this don't do that don't do this don't do that you should this you should skip the holy ghost in and when the holy ghost gets in there's only so much room in this vessel when the holy ghost comes in it just starts pushing everything else out and you see we can turn into a message of do's and don'ts and still have the don'ts he says you know you got these envy strife division he says are you not carnaling you're walking as men now look at this getting to the point here i got nervous look what the stature of the perfect man is my brother and sister it is not the stature of a perfect man is not a checklist for you and i to just simply say oh here we are i'm so nice to everybody i can check this off what the stature of the perfect man is is the act absolute diagram of the maturity of the bride of christ the more mature she becomes the higher she rises and i like preaching it this way as you look at that pyramid of the statue of the perfect man it is actually showing you the diagram of yourself are you with me the closer you get to perfection the less of you there is it just simply comes down less of me less of me less of me less of me less of me and the less there is of you and i the more of god is on the scene hallelujah and so there the maturity comes not because we can say our church just loves everybody i remember one time visiting a church and you know a brother had told me he says oh our church is just one of the most loving churches well what i didn't realize what he was trying to tell me is every grandmother in that church was planning on hugging me before i got out the back door of the church and so you know it was just like one of the most huggy churches i had ever been to in my life amen sister jerry you know they asked her to stand on one side by the back door and i was on the other side i'm greeting the brothers and every grandmother in that church decided that that young man as they termed me needed a hug from them and you know you talk about awkward saints because as time went on and the church is emptying out the older sisters got younger and younger and it got to the point it was just plain embarrassing that's not the kind of love that we're looking at we are looking at the kind of love that binds us my brother and sister to the word because you know if you love the word you will love your brother and sister around you you can't help it amen oh i'm so in love with the lord and i don't like you no it don't work that way the closer we get to christ the more we will love one another but propriety should ring right we should never cross the lines talking about oh it's because of love amen but he's showing this now how this is coming in the statue of person perfect man expressing maturity in the bride of christ so what happens as the apostle paul is preaching to them there has to be a reconciliation or a way to fix the corinthians problem or laodicean problem and it is there as we start to come into maturity now my brother and sister we come in maturity because we get older no no sir i've seen some really immature 60 year old two or three month people anyway we won't go into any details maturity is because you experience fiery trials when god starts to mold the faith in you starts to mold a character in you and the scripture tells us that we ought to rejoice because of those trials no amen how many of you was rejoicing today oh none of you had trials today oh my this is supernatural not a single trial in the church today well look let me stand up here for you hallelujah look but what's god doing he's bringing us to maturity i'm telling you my brother and sister i'm kind of a little light-hearted i hope you don't mind tonight but i'm telling you what happens is it's the first time you ever pray for yourself for someone near you or just someone you don't even know and you see god answer that prayer there's something that energizes you and you say i know for a fact my god is a prayer answering god this is not as it were a theory in the word this is a reality that i know and somebody comes along oh that's that's gone no i'm telling you it's present right now whether you believe it or not i know it is a fact what is that doing it starts to bring a maturity into us and the next time we face a challenge we're not so hesitant and when god comes on the scene we're not so hesitant until it becomes the very forefront of our daily life is our first thought is go to the lord our first thought is to go in prayer our first thought is to go before the throne and there's a maturity that's coming my brother and sister now i hope i'm making sense tonight hallelujah i patched together a lot of thoughts and it wasn't because i didn't have thoughts it's because i had too many amen now look at this i want you to just grasp this in verse 5 he says who then is paul paul speaking about himself who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom you believe now look i want to lay this out to you my brother and sister there's nothing wrong with having ministers that are prominent in your life i say lift a hand tonight and thank god for the ministers that moved you along in this in the word of god and helped you in times of need and trouble and praise god but look at this paul is telling us the apostle paul uh who is paul who is apollos but ministers whom he believed even as the lord gave to every man see not an exclusive right of one manner or one or two i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything or he that watereth but god that giveth the increase and i want you to take this increase my brother and sister and i want you to apply it mentally if you would tonight in your thoughts of of increase of the building we're talking about building a house so as god is moving and he puts a seed of faith in you anyone got a seed of faith tonight amen and so it is there by the preaching of the word that that seed of faith is watered and it starts to bring an increase and this increase isn't bushels that we put in a greenery but this increase is the faith that god has given to us because without that faith you can't even believe the word you can't even apply the word to your life without that so god is bringing this and so we want to see no matter how small it is my brother and sister now i could just go kind of weird on you on some of these things maybe i just will for just a second if you don't mind amen when you're raising a wheat crop it is now july the wheat almost looks completely yellow but if you cut the stem open at the first or second node and if the pith is still soft that means it can take moisture to the head you can say i'm not going to waste the water and you don't irrigate it and you might have 55 pound wheat but if you take the effort to irrigate that as long as there's still life in this stock and you'll grow 60 plus pound wheat which as a farmer equates to money and some say i hope you're following me some say you know as a christian i'm just struggling all the time are you watering are you too lazy you want water what god has given you are you watering it let me tie it back to you in this sense the prophet of god showed us very clearly he says you will get out of church what you expect if you expect to go home blessed you're going to pour something out but if you expect it just be another night you'll hold back save it for when apollos is preaching come on i got brother pavel here is my ally two paul's together here we can't pick on paul amen now look at this he he tells him you know look you're gonna receive your own award according to your own labor see and i hear this all the time i'm not defending the preacher i'm not defending myself but you know i i'm just don't have a spiritual life because of the pastor come on the word says you're going to get rewarded for your labors amen you outwork the pastor you might get rewarded more than the pastor wow that's a novel idea isn't it but we have a quote where the prophet of god said you won't go no higher than your pastor good if i stall out on the ladder i expect you well i don't know if i should encourage you to poke me with a sharp stick but if i stall out on the ladder i want you to keep pushing me come on saints be with me amen don't just say well our pastor seems to be going through a hard time and we're just all no start pushing him come on pastor what's the problem we're going to pray for you in fact we're going to lay hands on you right now whether you like it or not because we want more we have greater expectation amen so now look at this the apostle paul is telling him you know it's according to the grace of god which was given unto me my he's such a bold speaker as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and now i've turned it over for someone else to build on it do you know we can take and i would take me all night to tie all these loose ends for you we can take this and apply this directly because the prophet of god says you know what i preached what paul preached did he not he laid that as a foundational stone i preached what paul preached and now paul preached that i have laid the foundation and i've now left it for others to build upon oh come on think about it saints key ingredients we've got something to build upon you know this might sound kind of bad but if the lord rung you up tomorrow and said i give you the option to determine whether brother branham come back or not what would you take be pretty cool though hang out with the prophet hopefully you got call waiting because there's going to be 3 million phone calls in front of you can i tell you from my heart and i don't mean this as fleeting or if god said paul d you want the prophet to come back i would say no you know why the foundation's been laid we don't need to change anything i'm going to make a rapture you're going to make a rapture my brother and sister because the foundation has been laid and you have been anointed to build on that foundation not sit and wait for someone to come do it for you but to take the word of the hour and say you know what this goes here and this goes here and this piece fits in here and i need a window here and it's time church for us to turn a corner and we are anointed by the word of god to build the house now lest anybody especially our sister joy who doesn't have a clue what kind of crazy people she's visiting unless anyone misunderstand me my brother and sister i still in my heart would look to the day when we get to hug the neck shake the hand of our precious prophet but you see he gave me all the material god gave me all the material used a prophet to lay it out for me i've got the blueprint i've got the direction to build the house amen i'm not going to end up with it we're with an upside down and backwards house because i've been given a chance now look my brother and sister he says but let every man take heed how he buildeth there upon right we don't want to build a haphazard amen for noah for other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is jesus christ do you see what the apostle paul just did he switched from i've been anointed of god to lay this foundation from you for you and then he just totally cut himself out of the picture and said the foundation here now is christ so it's here it's time for you it's been provided he was preaching that same word that took him out of the scene and then put the whole focus on jesus christ aren't you glad today that we can take this what we believe right back into the word and realize why god did what he did in the time that he did it because i'm telling you and let me just i'll move on from this thought it's really my thought tonight but can you imagine if the prophet of god was still here for one it'd be very old but that's irrelevant to god did you realize in the day of cell phones and drones and this and that he'd be mowing his yard and turn around and his yard would be clear full of people and these are these are things these are the truth saints i've talked to brothers that were there and you know what some of them's questions would be not deep things of the mysteries of god some of them would be as simple as brother brown would it be wrong if i bought a red car you have your chance face to face with the prophet and somebody's told you it's evil if you drive a red car do you know if you drive a red car do anybody in the church drive a red car my husband yeah lord this husband thou hast given me you say brother paul you're joking but see i want you to catch the fallacy of this kind of idea it's not all about deep spiritual things people are caught up you know what should i do should i buy a house well i wouldn't buy a house and i wouldn't save any money and i wouldn't have any 401k i would put it in the offering plate an envelope that said for the pastor but what did the prophet of god say somebody tell me keep planting your potatoes that means every one of you ought to have a 401k or whatever it would suit your matter don't ask me i'm broke but you know so the prophet of god is laying this out see we can't cross the foundation the apostle paul laid which is jesus christ no matter what is spoken in our day we can't cross that foundation and you can declare i i don't encourage you to say it to their face or whatever but when you see people behaving otherwise you can look at them really and say you know what no it's not a problem brother sister you're just immature in the flesh you know how that would go over now look at this every man's work verse 13 shall be made manifest so we know the day is coming right for the day shall declare because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is so there is there is the the ultimate test of this house that we are building is whether it will stand the fire my brother and sister and i want to just take this i'm not saying there's a direct correlation but i want to just take this over and the scripture talks about fiery trials and people are then saying well this fire that's going to test our work is is judgment time it's in the future no it isn't my brother and sister it's right here fiery trials it's right here the little things whether it's in our health or finances family relationships or whatever it might be not things that need to be done or reconciled or whatever it might be and it's there the fiery trials take place right here and you're seeing people singed people's relationship with the lord burning up because of something that's taking place right now now brother branham says right here in the seven church ages i've jumped quite a bit so i hope you don't mind because i just realized earlier i had way too much stuff now then here we're coming to a conclusion just ignore that one as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun now i want you to dwell on this really i want you to focus please can i can you really really focus on this because this is deep amen as was manifested in the sun and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily we can say amen right and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son see that still baffles people even around the message when it comes to the godhead they still because of past teachings want to separate the son out from the father but look how brother branham so clearly puts this manifest in the flesh thereby gain the title of son oh can you grasp this those of you that read ahead amen even so we so what did he do the prophet of god says now look what i'm doing is i quit looking back in history right now and i'm going to put this right now so that you will realize i'm talking to you about that right now this is the time for you to focus on this not looking back here but right here right now amen so there he gained the title eternal so even so we eternal in his thoughts thank you lord whoa thank you lord eternal in his thoughts hallelujah in our turn became the many membered let me stop here i want to bring clarity in our turn now that word can be defined in several different avenues but it can also mean in our time right we can't go back and say you know what i really want to be a believer in the philadelphian age i'd like to go back to ephesus no you're here this is your turn this is your time hallelujah amen eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh oh now look at this i i need you to quit reading stop reading i want you to look at this now my brother and sister what is he saying he's telling us eternal in his thoughts in our season have become the many members spoken words if i could dance i would dance right now hallelujah because look at this my brother and sister what god has given to us and people say well we're waiting for that final mystery of jesus christ to be revealed it is revealed amen christ in you the hope of glory the word has been revealed it's time for us to mature in the sun not set and wait for something to happen not waiting for an event clicking the days off a calendar of when will this be this is the season amen this is the day because you see we have become the many members spoken word seed this seed get it seed seed manifest in flesh hallelujah god didn't leave it on the page god didn't leave it in the heavens he manifested it in flesh can someone say thank you lord and those i love this quote i just got so excited those eternal thoughts now manifest in the flesh you realize the way this is worded i believe the prophet's words are intentional those thoughts now manifest in flesh that puts it past tense saints that's right now not future now those eternal thoughts now manifest in the flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called that's who i am hallelujah that's who i am tonight amen that's what the word said i am and that's what the holy spirit moving right in our midst tonight is telling you and i what we are what are we we are the manifested sons of god we are the word coming out in flesh and it's not just a semblance my brother and sister it is the same word it is the same life it is not just some definitive uh example of the logos but it is the very life of jesus christ come right down from eternity now those of you that just can't help your self for reading ahead sometimes i like to just put blinders up here we did not become seed by the rebirth oh hallelujah it wasn't when i said lord forgive me of my sin and i repented and i went and got covered by the blood of jesus christ and it wasn't when i got baptized and it wasn't when i finally found a voice to raise in church to be able to praise my god my brother and sister it was not becoming seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for whole hallelujah only the elect can be reborn look what god has given us a very clean sign a very uh a clear vision excuse me i'm getting excited tonight i'm sorry hallelujah this if there's any argument of whether you became or always was there's the answer right there because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened you don't have revelation of the word my brother and sister because you got baptized you don't have revelation of the word because you receive the holy ghost see i hear it preach that way sometimes we receive the revelation of the word because we were always in the word we have always been the word and will always be the word and you say oh brother paul i i had uh i i had a quote not cut it out talking about stumbling it was you know that stone the chief corner and the unbeliever stumbled over it not once not twice they stumbled over it until they never went down that path ever again amen but do you realize oh i'm getting so far off track do you realize that didn't mean they quit going to church it don't mean they quit reading their bible it doesn't mean they quit praying they quit approaching the throne amen and the prophet of god shows us so clearly how they now set up their own throne speaking of the beast what brother brown call it a form of denominational worship oh saints hold on to this liberty that christ has given you for you to be able to go down to your knees and go to the throne and say lord give me revelation of your word i want to see you you're my bridegroom you're my husband you're the one i love not a building not a name here not paul not apollos but christ oh hallelujah i want to just do you mind if i just read this all straight through i have kind of slaughtered it with my starts and stops now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we oh hallelujah eternal in his thoughts in our turn our season became the many members spoken word seed manifest in flesh god didn't leave us in spirit form manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in the flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there's nothing to quicken i tell you what if god's just stirring your heart the least bit you just hold on amen you just claim it hallelujah did you love that i'm telling you that's just some beautiful scriptures amen manifested out through the message right there amen oh my i'm so tired i could sit down in this chair right here and go to sleep right now and i'm so excited i think i could run laps around this sanctuary for the next 30 or 40 minutes hallelujah there's just something in my soul amen that just has me so excited to see the word open up to us and it's telling you oh if i could put it this way go jolly go amen you can make the goal keep going johnny hallelujah hallelujah now hebrews 3 1 wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling did we not just read some of this calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus who is faithful to him that appointed him right so what is this here go back to what the prophet said he got to take the position of son by stepping into the flesh amen can i ask you a question tonight you promise to answer would you rather see jesus christ tonight has god stepped into his flesh or would you rather see jesus christ tonight stepped into your flesh many people saw him in the flesh of jesus christ and it did not one thing for them but i can assure you tonight's saints when we see christ stepped into this flesh we will never ever ever be the same we can't see and experience that and walk away from that people say i followed the message for 30 years and realized i'd been deceived no you didn't follow the message for 30 years because if you ever step into that position of seeing jesus christ stepped into or god let me put it not you into your flesh there is absolutely no way you can turn around and say i was deceived i'm walking away from this my brother and sister it's one thing to see an event take place it's another to be a part of what is taking place oh hallelujah he was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses and so much as he hath builded the house has more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man that he that built all things is god hallelujah look at this my brother and sister you say i thank the lord i study i study my bible i pray and and revelations coming yes sir what did the prophet say don't say i have the holy ghost come on i'm going to turn the words here i can't defend them but i hope you understand the spirit prophet of god said don't say i have the holy ghost say the holy ghost has me now i want to throw this at you okay and if i if i am uh wrong feel free to correct me i believe tonight we could make this statement i do not have revelation revelation has me hallelujah what could i ever ever in this mind hallelujah you know i want to encourage you guys i always speak down on myself going through some old stuff and found a a school i don't know what they call it now but you know test they they tested me yes sir i want you to know i am 51 proficient in english hallelujah thank you lord amen i was not a complete failure i was 51 percent proficient but i tell you god will lead you by your own skills and i maxed it out on mechanical ability praise the lord so if you need me to build a new pulpit call me you need me to articulate anything in english and and put the proper grammar um i don't know call one of these other sisters or but you see i'm so thankful tonight i don't have revelation god said that's my seed he's identified in my thoughts he's identified in eternity and i promise i would never leave him nor forsake him i promised i would lead him oh hallelujah i would lead him into all truth and so it don't matter what my english proficiency is the revelation has come down and taken the halts of you and taken the holds of me that we can walk through this life and the world says but the greek says i don't care what the greek says i want what the spirit said hallelujah how do we know that that greek wasn't just another intellectual man that god was hiding it from hallelujah look at this now as the man who builded the house hath more honor than the house you know we as humans need a little pride right we often just eliminate pride out of our vocabulary because it's like well you know we're christians we don't have any pride you realize if you didn't have some pride i'd be looking at people tonight in church and filthy clothes with food on your face come on kind of a rude way to put it isn't it now i'll leave that one alone but you see that same kind of pride in the right context is what causes you to recognize i want to be all the word said yes sir are you with me no no don't take okay i might have missed the actual intellectual point of that but don't don't take that wrong we don't believe because we're proud but because revelation has us there's something in us that says you know what children before you go to the table wash your hands wash your face leave your muddy boots at the door our house is not a pig pen what is that that's the same from the carnal and to the spiritual that causes you to come to the house of god and say lord i'm hungry tonight i've washed myself i've presented myself now lord i'm here to feed on the word i'm here to take this word and fill my plate amen and i'm going to eat it and then what happens amen you know i was going through my phone erasing a lot of pictures you know i don't know if you ever do that you you take a picture of something and the first one don't seem good you take another one and next thing you know it was on something like burst and you have 23 pictures of the same thing and i was just cleaning up some stuff out of my phone and my sister sharon i come across the picture when you were baptized little girl it's not real big now but little girl i'll come across all these pictures of different kids i have a had a i have a picture in my phone of the graham family titus was how big sister sarah just a little guy what are we doing church we're coming to maturity the rapture will come when we are ready to take the rapture let's not go build another house you know i mentioned in service the other day about these people are like oh you know the millennium's over and now we can just do whatever we want wrong house come on they took the foundation that paul laid and they started building this way in that way and they said you know what i don't have enough tuba force to build this room so i'm just gonna build the rafters four feet apart and i'm gonna put the studs four feet apart and i'm just gonna nail it it'll be all right it doesn't stand the test of time saints we have a firm foundation and the master builder is worth all that we can give him he is our all he is worthy of this honor of this glory amen that we can stand upon this now let me just move along right here real quick amen it's pretty cool my brother and sister in this context of the scripture to be identified as the one that built the house right as much as he had builded the house has more honor than the house but we have as it is you and i control how this house is built isn't that right you say well paul i don't know yeah the prophet of god said the holy spirit goes where he's invited you want to build a strong house keep an invitation out amen keep an invitation out you want to build a strong house every house is builded by some man so we get to be identified as one building the house and that is as it is our testimony our life my brother and sister but i tell you what it's one thing to be identified as the one building the house it's another to be identified by the one who built the house hallelujah it's one thing to say i'm a christian i've been serving the lord this is good how about when god testifies through you when god testifies this is my house might be a teenage girl it's my house might be an old man my house might be whatever my house god identifying himself as i read it i don't want to go back and and go back to it but it's there as it's manifested in this turn oh hallelujah can we give just a little praise to the lord because he chose to manifest himself in us hallelujah god's decision god's decision not our decision amen hallelujah i want to move real quick here first peter 2 5 love this scripture ye also has dead wet cold stones no sir amen lively songs is our lively stone in the house tonight amen we're looking uh there's been a request to find a lively stone hallelujah amen have you ever been like at a concert or some event you know and something's happened and somebody called and they've got you know like an usher or something and they're walking down the aisles ah we're looking for bob jones you know there's a play or something going on we're looking for bob jones and bob jones a phone in the foyer bob jones is that how god works no sir he come down that midnight hour and he whispered your name and he said hey i need to talk to you need to talk to you i i'm placing a call and he said well i need you to do see oh pardon me i'm tying like three sermons together forgive me saint you know how i am come on let's let's take ye out okay it's not erasing very good okay you just read it for yourself he also paul also as a lively stone are built up do you realize this is a present tense statement you could say it's a past tense also but you can in my very much mangled english defend all the things you know you guys know and adjectives and prepositions and you know that kind of stuff he also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices accepted to god acceptable to god by jesus christ what did he do he stepped down in that form as we just read to accept our praise as an element as the scriptures see that you shell out five hundred thousand dollars to have a house bill and you go there and it's not your house i wanted a window here brother brian talks about this and the message things i want this like this now i decided it's better if it's this way saints i'll just close sister ruth this is god's house let's build it the way god wants it built let's build it under the moving of the holy spirit you know i i'll just be honest with you i don't know any of you suffer from this but some of us think we can fix things some of us think you know there's an issue i can fix this i'm pretty good with that it's probably not a good trait for a pastor because sometimes i just like look i remember now i've got to pray about that i can't can't go over there do this this and this it'll all work out no we've got to let god move [Music] i want this house i want my house i want your house to be the house that god built i want it to be the house that the lord looks down and says that's my child and i pour my revelation into them i pour my spirit into them hallelujah i could preach those other three or four pages from memory but we'll just stop hallelujah also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god no word saints i'm going to take you back to our quotes earlier no word declaring that i called you i anointed you i manifested you and then i will look you in the face and depart from me no way you can put those together you are either in him or you never was that simple when the devil starts chattering at you just remind him i'm either in him or i never was but this heart is crying out saying lord i love you lord i want to serve you lord lead me guide me lord i need you hallelujah let the devil get down where the rubber meets the road hallelujah hallelujah and saints let's have grace on one another if you hear the pastor you hear some of the ministry ever say i don't throw us out with the bathwater we don't mean ourself that's a nicolaitan domineering controlling spirit that wants you to look to them and not the holy ghost so let's not become hypercritical if somebody says i prayed for them and god healed them i prayed for them cast that spirit off them you can [Music] you can tell can't you do we have discernment come on [Music] and i won't i won't get upset either if i hear you say i but let's give god and let's build him a beautiful house amen hallelujah you know i can let junk away and you're like somebody's going to make something out of that they hauled the last junk last trailer loaded junk away from that and when they re-appeared that day they had a trailer loaded junk they drove it right to the back corner of the property and threw their junk off and they never stopped until they've got it filled right back to the road again my brother and sister whether it's your junk or somebody else's we weren't called to be a junkyard we were called to be sons and daughters of god washed by the water of the word not the junk of this idea not the junk of this opinion and not the junk of this but to be washed by the water of the word and cleaned that we might be able to stand and receive the word of god freely oh hallelujah i've stopped i've stopped hey brother jason will you help me i want to sing the song this is your house amen saints i hope tonight made sense hallelujah let's just stand and sing i know we can always breathe a little better amen hallelujah [Music] let your glory fill this sanctuary be enthroned in the praises of your people lord we agree in unity this is your heart [Music] and tonight this is your house it's a holy house of prayer where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their cares this is your house this is your house come and dwell holy spirit overflow this place oh let it be this house decorate our walls with grace and mercy let healing and redemption find searching souls lord have your way we humbly pray this is your heart now claim it father come and dwell this is your house it's a holy house of prayer where the lost and the lonely

by myself i counted a blessing to get to spend a lot of time by myself [Music] this is your house speaking of us father come and dwell this is your house a holy house of prayer when i feel now we don't go by feeling saints but every one of us has feelings when i feel lost and i feel lonely i get to bring my burdens and my cares because this is your house this is where i get to call the presence of god right now and there as he deals with us comforts us strengthens us preaches to us hallelujah well i just want to change this you know sometimes i i don't know sometimes i miss it i'm sorry saints i maybe jump over something but you know as i'm studying when songs speak to my heart i usually jot them down and i'm telling you i just power in the blood because i'm telling you what no matter what you need there is power in this but hallelujah oh we love you tonight god bless you amen let's just support one another in prayer hallelujah [Music] would you be free from the burden of
