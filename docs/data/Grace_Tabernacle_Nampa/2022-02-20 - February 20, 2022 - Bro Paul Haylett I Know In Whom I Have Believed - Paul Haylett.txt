place [Music] of we say amen to that this morning amen how beautiful that is amen you know i always am amazed how the lord can just give guidance and you know it's a decision saints that we have this morning to make we can either choose to set our wings to the winds of faith or as we have seen so clearly in the world today we can give in to the atmosphere of fear and we can give in to this atmosphere of doubt and those you know seem to be as it were the very obvious factors that there is in the world today we we either find ourselves in that realm of faith or in that realm of fear and uh you know that satan doesn't have to get you to believe the word if you believe the fears of the world around you because the fears of the world around you will so limit the word in your life you'll never have overcoming power and so it's there that we have to shed the atmosphere of the world we live in now i just want to bring before i go into the service i want you to just think about this now i know it's went on for ages and ages but we're living in this day you know we just passed from the fear of covet right they're dropping restrictions all all over the world brothers have made me to know for sure that they've dropped the restrictions in australia you might say the hint as it were you could come back and the the limitations in chile are falling you can come back so kovad's now behind us but world war iii is now in front of us so we have moved from one fear to another well praise the lord this world is not my home i'm just passing through hallelujah i don't have to worry about what's happening i don't become concerned with that yes the prophet of god says that he come to redeem those who sigh and cry for the abominations in the city so we can't just totally just you know block it all out but we have to remember that satan that great distracter is trying to distract us once again you don't have just a couple things i don't know is sister miriam them okay we haven't seen them for a little bit have they been sick or okay okay so just missing them sister sophie i'm sorry i'm i've been gonna text brother manasseh the last few days and i just keep forgetting it was on my mind this morning i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it and then i'm sitting out here and it's like i forgot but let's just remember those in the body okay the grams are uh in arizona with family and and just uh if we miss anybody this morning forgive us but just remember the body brother bob sister joanne and just each part of the body is important to us amen let's just stand as we go into the word today i want to uh if you want to start by turning in your bibles to ephesians the second chapter i thank amen we certainly never want to lift up the man we'll talk on that a bit but once again the lord's laid upon brother jason's heart certain songs we have no collaboration we have nothing of that nature but yet i'm i'm just like oh that little chorus that little verse this little thing it just all just you know strikes our heart and we're thankful for that and you know i want to uh you know just uh speak for just one second you know i'm still using the main title of the two sides of obedience because you see saints uh this doubt uh fear and faith you see you will be obedient to whichever spirit you give into so we're still in that thought of the two sides of obedience because if we walk in fear we are subject to the dictate of fear and we will become obedient to that we walk in faith then faith will tell you don't do that do this faith will tell you don't doubt believe and we then react and obey that spirit all through the bible amen just to sidetrack for just one moment go back to the story of saul jonathan and david and you see that whole story and how how it is that you see the influences that were there you see we have to follow prophecy we have to see the word of god fulfilled right it cannot fail but yet you see the foundation is laid and even saul himself had decisions to make and this is a very interesting topic you know uh saul had declared uh no one should eat any honey you know you don't eat anything i'm i want you to do and jonathan himself now i'm just giving you a paraphrase of it jonathan himself now comes and admits that i i've been eating the honey it was just a little bit but i ate some honey as it were from the rock and saul says you've went against my words you got to die but it was the people themselves that rose up and said will not touch a hair of his head and they rescued jonathan and you see how that that spirit just continued to anoint and saul's position before god and before man continued to deteriorate was it the fulfilling of word yes god's word will be fulfilled but it also shows you the character or the reaction of an anointed spirit you see prophecy was there but just so you'll think about it what if saul had just stopped one day and bowed his face to the earth and said lord i'm wrong help me lord i'm wrong but he was anointed with a spirit that i will do this no matter what and it brought about the obedience to that spirit amen so i want to speak to you this morning just a little title that come i have to admit i've been struggling to title things because i this hope know that erase it 10 times this this this but it just struck me and this one stayed with me the thought i know in whom i have believed and i think we can each one take that in our heart we're not here this morning wavering amen but we know in whom we have believed let's turn in our bibles ephesians the second chapter verses 1 through 10 this morning just to lay a ground work and you hath he quickened amen who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world now while this was written many years ago my brother and sister it's applicable today the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even even when we were dead in sins which is to say unlovable hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus then in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god you know my brother and sister this gift we would put in this context the greatest christmas gift you could ever receive the greatest birthday gift you could ever receive the greatest start of the summer end of the summer winter spring uh morning noon night this is absolutely the greatest gift that could ever be given to mankind hallelujah thank you lord not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them heavenly father we just ask for your blessings this morning lord father just ask you to come down you know my heart's prayer father that you just bless each and every one father lord let each one just say this is the word of god and i receive it this morning and father we could walk out blessed today father for every uh prayer request for every need for everyone unable to come lord for the situations of life father we ask your perfect will be done and may your mercy flow out amongst your people father to bring about the word of god in their lives and father we thank you for that and give praise glory and honor to you today in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated once again good to have sister sue who's becoming a world-class commuter amen but it's good to see her in the house of god today amen now i just want to start in here not to go line by line today but just to kind of take this as an overview focus on on a few things the first three verses that we read here uh are uh in a sense show kind of a bleak picture of the unconverted humanity right uh well it shows that how that we uh being lost uh consumed in the lust of the flesh and the power of the spirit of the age that we live in and how it comes upon us and what our conversations were i was just a few days ago i just had a little interaction with some people and it's so interesting my brother and sister and i don't want to focus on this but just to make this it's so interesting how in the age that we live in that a normal conversation can deviate so quickly to something perverted they take a word they take a little something and it's just we used to call them a zinger and they just zing it's just out there all of a sudden so you see that the power of conversation to see how it is in the day that we're living in uh you look at this and realize that this spirit that is here is now brought forth uh in conversation and we know the word of god says it's from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so we see hearts that have become completely uh corrupted as it were been marked black but you know what we'll look at this now there are those my brother and sister in our midst today and i say thank you lord and for our young people i pray that you grow up amen please hear me i pray that you grow up and never have to say i was out here and did this this and this i never have to bear the memory of certain languages and certain behaviors that is the ultimate testimony we have beautiful testimonies in our midst of sinners uh you know in the darkest sense saved by grace but i pray god amen the word promises that to us will rise up a generation unmarked by satan amen and so we just believe for that amen but these first three verses show this picture of uncom converted humanity and um you know their language their thoughts their deeds everything that is there and and uh you know we look at that and think oh my because we we can see just how low that humanity can seek or or sink i mean and you look at this but verse 4 i really wanted to focus you know how many times i've preached here in the church about the word but amen it negates those things in front of it and so while we look at this bleak picture of humanity of which we this morning i believe can say thank you lord we've been delivered right so you know he he actually opens it on a positive note then gives the definitive description of what it is you were quick and from amen oh thank you lord amen we never want to forget that we were sinners saved by grace but that's not our focus and i know there's been times that i have kind of you might say ranted on this and i'll just throw a quick note we're not here to glorify the hole that god drug us out of amen we're here to glorify god so you know to talk about what a great drunk i was and this that and the other i think that's utter nonsense opinion okay is it all right to interject i i don't believe that's anything to be glorified this was my mud hole this was my alley this no it wasn't satan temporarily derailed you and put you in there and god said that's not who you are and that's not where you belong so to you is quicken and we see the symptoms of the spirit and we're going to talk because we're in laodicea the symptoms of laodicea are now given out and laid out very clearly for us amen we can fill in the blanks but god amen oh he negated my brother and sister everything that was previous no longer exists it's done it's wiped away and you know the devil he kept a lot of shorthand notes but they're not applicable or cannot be given to the court because they're ruled inadmissible because the only evidence that matters is the evidence that god has himself and he said i washed you whiter than snow and i look in the book and i see nothing held to your account hallelujah even though the devil will say but but but but i i would nope nope nope sorry satan it don't matter what you said amen because we have a greater witness but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us now that's so beautiful my brother and sister we can go into predestination we can go into all of the factors that weigh in on humanity and our relationship but the very fact that god loved us that ought to be something that would just hold us every day of our life that we could stop and say no matter what i'm going through god loves me the wheels can fall off the wagon the banker can call you and say you're overdrafted whatever it might come in your life a doctor might say this or that but to stop and say god loves me not a superficial love but a very deep enduring love in fact it endures so long it's called eternity hallelujah amen when we were dead in sins it quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved now as we look at this my brother and sister in verse six this is really the real crux and i kind of took all the you know the newness out of this by mentioning the last few services i've preached but i'm telling you it actually has made me excited something stirring in my heart to realize just how the plan of god it's one thing for god to say i chose you before the foundation of the world but another thing for us to watch it being manifested and coming to pass in me in you there's a beauty to get excited about otherwise we could just all be yeah i'm i'm saved i've been saved a long time there was no earth back when i got saved but we get to see the manifestation we get to see it coming to pass we get to see this whole plan of god where he said you know what i could come once again and i could anoint you know as it were and come down once again as jesus christ in the flesh but you know what i'm going to do as i have put in my word and declared this many membered body that's what i'm going to do i'm not going to prove that i could live sinless i'm going to prove that in the darkest of ages my offspring my dna the life manifested in this right here oh but nobody lives sinless yeah they do actually hallelujah you see the problem is is we're looking through man's eyes and we're trying to determine who we are or who you are through man's eyes but we have to look through the filter of the blood and god laid that out before there ever was a world he said i'm going to filter everything through my precious blood and what can go through that filter my brother and sister i tell you absolutely nothing can go through that filter when it comes to the blood of jesus christ when it is presented and the sacrifice as it is figuratively and literal in the day is laid upon the altar nothing goes beyond that so god said i'm going to come down with a mini-member body and i'm going to have a sinless bride of christ on the earth today and it's there now you say well brother paul's sinless i struggle with that anybody say they can struggle with that i've struggled with it for years my brother and sister how that me you know could be and then one day i realized yep there it is the gift the gift has been given and i'm here to say today that my god is not an indian giver he doesn't give the gift and take it back oh you're naughty today i'm taking my gift away no sir in fact when we fail the gift is then magnified instead of diminished in our failure as it were of the flesh god magnifies it and said here's your refuge oh my son or my daughter or my child here's your refuge oh hallelujah yes sir see you look at this and just realize how beautiful this is now in verse 6 he said hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus now feel free to speak out but what do you notice right off the bat that i would say is not peculiar but peculiar about that verse past tense and plural i have no exclusive right you have no exclusive right and please understand me in this right context the prophet had no exclusive right so people that say that the message certain factions are or pieces of the message certain things were to the prophet alone no no if they say it's to him alone they do not understand the principle of first fruits because the first fruits was an offering for the harvest of the whole field not not not not those that were taken from the field aren't you glad amen i may never in this life have a vision i may never in this life dream as it were a deep spiritual dream i may in this life never discern i do believe by god's grace that we have been a part of seeing spirits cast out i will reach out and take a hold of that i've seen that come to pass but there are certain things that i will probably no doubt never see in my life but did you know saints now i hope you catch this i claim that i have discerned spirits i have cast out demons i have all these things why because i am a part of the harvest of the first fruit amen and so when that was done that wasn't just exclusive for that take it right back to the scripture we'll find that amen otherwise you'd go out and and look look at this now just you know this is what farmers do they look over the corn field they find the best part of the corn field and they figure out what an acre is out in the best part of the corn field and they combine that then they go down to the coffee shop brother trevor and tell everybody we had some 400 bushel corn it was only about the size of the parking lot of our church but we had 400 bushel corn so god didn't go out my brother and sister i hope you follow me he didn't go out and choose just the best amongst us and say these are these promises are for you remember a brother saying you know he said i'd rather die than sing a special and then i i think maybe it's the holy spirit come on him and he says forgive me lord i really didn't mean that you see some are gifted with music praise the lord i'm glad brother jason's sister emmy around to tell me that i'm singing an f because in my whole life f was bad but i'm telling you you know i don't know what f is i can't identify f i'm glad i can just sing i have a quote for that amen if you need that i could supply that to you prophet of god says you should just be happy and give praise to the lord that you can just sing let your praise come to the lord he said you might not be uh oh what is that salami me fossalami look that up you'll find it under that he said you might not be able to sing that but if you've got a voice you can praise god hallelujah thank you lord amen so it's there look at this now i just want to to take just the first part of verse six and we will break this down and he hath raised us up together one past tense his sister dying brought out but it's plural my brother and sister whole church included everyone who wants to be a part of the house can be part of the us today amen he hath raised us up together so it's not just a real spiritual man here real spiritual sister over here but this is a body of believers that the word is coming forth is blessing each and every one of us now i want to take this back to nature my brother and sister you'll find in a wheat field just as you see right here some not so good i shouldn't say good not so uh big and beautiful not so tall not as big a head but still wheat and it still brought forth seed amen and it still can be planted and will reproduce amen do we realize how important that is well i've just said on a pew my whole life never had a position just reproduce just reproduce the life of christ don't try to worry about if your name's going to show up on the headline on on youtube or on the video or or whatever it might be don't worry about that just grow and reproduce jesus christ amen and some grow taller and some will be there and you say oh if i could have been taller well maybe that wind storm right after the rain would have knocked you flat if you were too tall so thank the lord but some of this might have been in the worst soil on the farm wait might have been in the worst nation or the worst city under the worst this or the worst that oh i was raised up in a message church and it was a mouse and and oh oh oh but you are here and you're producing seed and god's not going to say well because you didn't you know we take it back to scripture you know some produce 50 and 78 whatever 100 and people get all caught up in that but my brother and sister the important thing is that you produce when the seed is come a barren hall bringeth no profit empty just husk the prophet of god says i actually have nothing against denomination sometimes we get around the message that went denomination prophet of god said no nothing wrong with denomination that's just a matter of putting things in a certain order but it's a spirit just like he talked about rock and roll young people you say well okay okay isn't that a cute little song spirit behind that song and even some of this contemporary christian music we have now everybody's like oh isn't that wonderful spirit behind that now the real question you see because i i'm really been on a bent lately about not telling you what to do but please go check out that spirit shine the light very clearly on that spirit and see what that is about that spirit my brother and sister a lot of the songs that are being sung in what we call contemporary christian music today are actually empty they could be sung to the devil just as easily as they could to jesus christ in fact they are and the reason i say that is because the songs are not producing anything of a real christian nature so you look at this see we have to know who we believe in we have to have a firm foundation of where we stand because when the wind blows my brother and sister it will destroy everything that is not truly anchored amen now look at this he has to raise us up together now the word raised there's there's several different ways it applies and i have to be honest with you uh when it starts getting into all of this adjective and all these other little sub things i kind of get lost never did figure it out in the beginning still haven't figured it out but it's all right i'll still make the rapture amen but look at this now raised is elevated so he hath elevated us up together now look at this and if i can just have this liberty this morning you see we're not of this earth my brother and sister we're not of the spirit of the age i just read a little deal the other day this guy mocking the whole idea that there would be a god of this age well i'm telling you my brother and sister if that guy ever pulls his head out of the sand he's going to be shocked because if you can't look at this now this happened many years ago but sister jerry and i was traveling to chile some and we were traveling off to some remote or smaller churches and little villages and whatnot and you know in my mind in my mind i thought you know we're just like the brothers have driven us for hours and we're just out here in nowhere and uh you know it's going to be different you get out of the car and it's like it's not different we're in the middle of nowhere south america and the exact same spirits and clothing and music and attitudes is all there now if that is not my brother and sister this spirit or the holy spirit we'll put it that way the spirit of god if that's not the spirit of god then it's going to be a spirit and so if you go on the earth today and drive from town to town town to town town to town nation to nation nation and nation will you find the majority of the reflection of jesus christ where you could walk into a store and say my goodness this looks like a whole store full of believers no but you can walk in that store and you'll know what the whole store believes in because there is a god of this evil age regardless of what the critics might say men making boasts of i was in the message for 45 years and i no longer believe it my apologies because something was missing no foundation i'm sorry so something was raised here hath raised us up has elevated us up together now we have to find the right balance my brother and sister in the flesh often times when a man is raised up you'll see that whether it be in sports politics church whatever largely when we see men raised up then you will see that these men have a tendency to start looking to self they start to say well and let's just bring it home to church and sometimes now have mercy don't be quick to judge sometimes you have to discern between it's just a human nature to say i prayed for this person and god delivered them or i prayed for this person and god healed them you need to know the character of the person saying that because in some cases it's just us speaking the hand you know as it would be you know you lay hands on somebody and you saw the result and you say i prayed for them you're actually speaking fact but there's another realm over here that when man has been lifted up they start to believe they were the only conduit by which that person could receive deliverance or healing they're the only conduit which god has to bring revelation into the church and my brother and sister you'll find that when man gets raised up in that way god has a certain obligation i guess you would say to knock them off of their pedestal and times i've said this through the years and i'll just toss this in real quick but my brother and sister i've spoke this in this church many times as we have dealt with issues but you see this church will never become a nicolaitan church right the ministry dominating the people unless you allow it so if you stand up for your god-given rights as a believer of the word of god and have the courage to say that ain't so we're not knuckling under we're not becoming subservient because pastor you taught us that we were raised up together so we're not your minions we're not your servants but then obviously as the word and the prophet showed us we give honor we're honors do in fact brother branham covered it well enough if you can't respect the man in the office at least respect the office so we get a balance to this right saints so we see how it is of the age that we're living in when men start to be lifted up uh they start to look to themselves and then the second half of that they start to look out for themselves give you a quick story two different men that i know one said well we'll take all we can take meaning of the resources of the church because i have no retirement another one saying my wife and i have poured our hearts and lives out for 40 years to the body believers we have no retirement but the lord promised he would take care of us i could name names if i was so inclined right now in their church as a new pastor life has went on under a new ministry a little more dynamic younger man there's young families have kind of come in and if i ever get to the point that you all want to leave before you all leave maybe we can talk about having a successor but this brother and sister had nothing and he's no longer pastor and the church said brother and sister so and so have given this assembly in this city 40 years of their life will take care of them see the difference one was looking out for self the other one said god will take care of me so you see when we become lifted up we start to have a tendency of what is best for me it's not really god's plan is it he said he'd be our provider we're actually telling him i'm not sure your program works lord so i'm going to kind of second it here to make sure but you look at this now this tendency to look to self uh this is why saints if i can interject this i've got several interjections here this morning that's why i try to share with you when i have an opinion with i have something i can't you see i believe in preaching a defensible gospel and what i mean by defensible is if you can do it's like right here then i don't have to interpret yet there's things that we read the scripture and i think you would say amen to this that we we are have a i'm going to use the word feeling but i'm not talking about a human feeling and we're like i believe this is where the word is conveying to me you know i believe this is as a word between the lines and and i believe this is what it is and you know what i i like to identify that as opinion right because then if we differ we don't have to get a big argument split the church and start three or four and you know because we don't always see everything exactly alike but if we have true revelation there is only one revelation of jesus christ only one not two not three so now when we're raised up in christ i want to just keep moving along when we are raised up in christ the importance of the flesh is largely set aside now remember i said largely because you see we're called to be good stewards of this body of this flesh and the gifts that god has given us so you don't you don't just throw it apart and literally say well if god wants it to happen it'll happen my brother and sister you can lay in bed and never ask for prayer when the body of believers would love to pray for you and it's no sign of less faith it's actually a sign of stepping away from your own self and saying wait we're raised up together we're a body of believers now if the right hand wants to help the left hand hmm i don't want to elaborate because it takes too much time but you see the importance of the flesh is set to the side and the spirit man is then moved into the position of importance now look i'm just going to speak this as though i'm speaking just to a crowd of people i don't know but if you are more worried about your life which means house money jobs etc then of the word of god and being in the house of god to fulfill the word of god you're looking to the flesh you're looking to that flesh man and the spirit man is not ruling because the spirit man wants to be fed amen when jonathan there was hungry and i i don't know may we'll preach on this at some point but when jonathan was there and was hungry and he looked out there and he saw that honey he didn't say well i i you know he gave into something deeper and he said i need i need a bite of honey i need something and i'll tell you my brother and sister i'll put this out there like this god never called sons and daughters of god to live in this present world and spite this fight this spiritual fight hungry he wants you to be well fed because it's when you're well fed on the word of god that you have strength to fight the enemy and strength to deep dig into the word of god this should not be a starved church in this message but having said that let me reiterate it with this people say well i don't know i'm not going to go to that church any longer it doesn't feed me we feed babies adults feed themselves so if you need someone to as it were ladle out the word to you i'm sorry but as paul spoke to them says your babes you can't i had to just give you milk i couldn't give you meat see the balance in this amen was paul lifted up in his thinking no he wasn't he was actually laying the groundwork there comes a season for us as true believers to start saying there's honey i'm eating it amen now jonathan amen there's a whole story behind that he was man enough to admit i ate some honey his own dad says you got to die the people said whoa it's because of jonathan god come on the scene today there's no way we're letting a hair of his head see saul was backslidden preacher he wanted the church to do what he wanted the church to do and he wanted to dole out the word to the people according to what he thought they needed but god says you know what i'm going to do i'm going to put some honey out here and i'm going to anoint jonathan to eat that and under that anointing jonathan's be able to go forward and there's inspiration read the story jonathan had inspiration when he got that honey amen that was well we'll put it as revelation amen and so something happened to jonathan in that moment and he knew there was something special about that he knew god was present so having said what i said let me back up on myself it might seem like i'm countering this there's no reason no excuse for you to starve to death at the same token i encourage you to go to a church that wants to have a buffet for you not a starvation diet yeah well let me put it this way i hope i don't get too far down the human element for you but science has proved nutrition that if you try to starve yourself your body starts to digest itself and you know what it digests first not fat muscle so the very strength you need to live in laodicea is the first thing a spiritual starvation diet takes away from you that's why you should eat a well-rounded diet of the right proportions of the right ingredients that your body can say all is well we have heard the message shalom all is well and let me say that all is well my brother and sister sometimes you know we have children we have one that is not serving the lord and we get to the place that we have two roads that we must take and those two roads are such that we have to decide we compromise so our children will still love us and and try to you know spoon feed a little something or we come over here and say what i believe i know in whom i believe i know what i believe and while i love you and i will not cram it down your throat don't forget i know whom i believe i'm not going to waffle i'm not going to compromise i'm not going to try and sugarcoat it heard a man say once as he dropped his cupcake on the ground picked it up with dirt all over the frosting he said well i believe this mostly was made out of dirt in the beginning and almost everything is good with frosting let's just tell it like it is so the prophet encourages just tell it like it is you have a relationship with the lord you have received the holy ghost you are standing in the revelated word of the hour don't move right or left for that but don't cram it down someone's throat don't apologize for it live it amen amen so look when we largely set the the flesh or the the carnal man aside the spirit man moves into the position of importance and when spiritual things are elevated saints what happens god starts answering prayer the word of god comes alive to us and we actually find ourselves never a disagreement we're living in bliss we're all happy there's times like that there's days like that but i'll tell you i'm not putting sister jerry night under the bus because i think you guys have to identify with me but you can have all the positions of humanity in one day yeah yes sir come on saints you can argue with the wife you can be upset at the children you can be praising the lord for prayers answered you can shout hallelujah from something you never saw before in the word of god and before the day is over you can snip at the wife and then in devotions or at the dinner table find yourself with tears running down your cheek as you say lord forgive us amen you see this heavenly places my brother and sister is some not some carnal place of bliss it is a spiritual position and when we come in that spiritual position amen we start to see that you know what when i elevate the spiritual man these things of this life here tend to diminish and go away and even though the spirit of antagonism might come in we might start to say well yeah anyway satan get out of the house you know amen kind of like the cat you know don't look sister nadia but kind of like the cat [Music] not in this house now the devil my brother and sister would like to hang on the screen door and squall all the time but look when the spirit man has moved into this position amen these things change as the song says what a difference it makes when the lord has his way can someone say you know what i'm talking about amen when we put god in that position and we realize you know what the lord's in control the the atmosphere changes our motivations change and and we see our response to the even the cares of this life would you guys pray for snow or rain i need you all to pray a lot for snow or rain i was joking with i think that was brother alex yesterday i was joking i said if something don't change you're going to have a unemployed man who will just have to maybe become a full-time pastor i'll be out here sweeping the cracks in the parking lot but you see that will either dominate me or i'll look at it and say prayer changes things and lord thy will be done thy will be done you see the self-absorbed man or woman says lord my will be done but the man who's given it over to a spiritual position because he knows in whom he believes and says i can just give this over to the lord and let go of this and he'll take care of it he'll take care of it now look he raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places i tell you i want heavenly places i want that atmosphere of my life to be in heavenly places and as i have kind of spilled the beans a time or two in previous services but my brother and sister once again just to use this simple analogy when god makes us he doesn't throw us in a headlock he doesn't tie us up he doesn't put handcuffs on and drag us god does not make us in that fashion but when he makes us amen he made us to sit together once again what god's making me do he's making you do and vice versa it is not one person that he says well i'll make an example out of you my brother and sister god has a body of believers and all the way to north south east west whatever continent whatever country whatever circumstance god's in control amen and he made us now look at this word made it's very interesting now the way it was broke out in the definition i'm going to take it from bottom to top just to fit my thought it denotes a certain degree of force so if we was to apply that in just a regular definition that would be the point where you are forced to serve god forced to repent from your sins forced to read your bible and pray forced but you see that's not the god we serve is it and we can say that today because we know in whom we believe we are not just wondering is this my brother and sister i got a lot of good friends and there are different denominations different things a lot of friends that are catholic and my brother and sister you'd be shocked that they don't even understand why they just know their priest told them do this do this do this and they've never even dug deep enough to know why they do those things they don't know what it reflects in their spiritual walk but they are told you'll be a good christian if you do this and if they languish a little bit on that then it comes down to the point do it or else now my brother and sister that's force that's right right there where that's at in the context of what we're thinking of being made but god didn't do that god come along and says you know what i'm going to do i'm going to make or made you see those two words actually are tied directly together so you look at that i'm going to make a people who are such a people that when they see my word they're attracted to it there's nothing repulsive about the word to them and they're actually attracted to it and as i have shared with you the last few services there's something after they take a bite of the word that they find it irresistible and they just have to go back to the word and they go back to the word and they go back to the word and that word is enough it splits families it splits churches it splits relationships and friendships and all of these kind of things it's that powerful and people think oh they got involved with that and it made them do that no you missed it my brother and sister it's right here in the word it's not any man right we're mature enough to move beyond the man and we're moving into a position of the holy spirit moving on us which as the prophet said in godhead and you know this but the holy spirit is god himself and so it's god himself is moving us to make decisions and stand behind them that in this flesh we could never do it we would never have the courage to do it in this flesh but god moving deep down into the heart and soul there's so many quotes i could just read quote after quote after quote to you concerning these things but it's taken a holds of the man and god did not do it by force my brother and sister in fact we'll just look right here in just a second here in the cis in leadership sorry i'm just all over the board my mind just racing off like oh get out in in leadership each one of us has to make a choice you know that's the way i like it because if i'm your boss you're not going to like it and if you're my boss i'm not going to like it but that that's deep down in the soul when god says your life needs to change we don't tell them that's your opinion we're real believers and when the holy spirit through the word moves upon us and says your life needs to change we say amen it's a make-believer and the unbeliever that says well i'm going to question that in fact i'm going to go spend four years in the university and learn aramaic so i can see if you're telling me the truth well i thank the lord for that because i might not ever make it to the status of true believer if that is a qualification but i tell you what when the holy spirit comes down in the soul and says you know what that is my word and something inside of you says amen amen thank you lord thank you lord is it always easy no i'm telling you i've cried bitter tears be gone sometimes two three four weeks at a time in the semi i look back in those years and i think man why'd i waste my time doing that and a little reminder says wait that's the times god dealt with me the most i was homesick okay i'll admit it i'm spoiled rotten i like being home i like the wife taking care of me there it's out it's public but you see god knows what he's doing each one of us has to make a choice and it's confronted to us but we're all confronted with this one thing what are we going to do about eternal life see it comes down to this deal what are we going to do do i choose the god of this evil age and he's going to offer me a lot i could actually probably be rich by now yeah that's it or as it were figuratively sell all the house and follow me going back here again a little redundant in the memories but look israel they come and said wait we don't want to go across the river because this is the land of grass and we're cattle people and joshua tells them you'll either cross the river see getting the holy ghost is what seals the inheritance so as it were they would be no different than those who refused to move forward from kadesh barnea if they didn't cross the river so that is the message believer who does not press into receiving the holy ghost but knows the message intellectually he never crossed over because once you cross over god says i recognize to you guys you think god didn't know that was a land of grass you think god's like i never knew that so you guys actually want to go back across the river now and claim that as part of your inheritance and run catalan i never ever knew that that was a land of grass no sir he knew exactly where it was at and he anointed joshua to be that mean preacher look at this saints to be that mean preacher that told you if you don't get the holy ghost you can go to church and believe this message intellectually all of your life but if you don't cross over the river receive the inheritance i'll let you go back and build a nice business live in a nice house have money in a savings account take vacations enjoy these things of life but you better get across the river first because all of this won't mean nothing oh god blessed me with this mansion my multi-million dollar business he blessed me with this bless me with that without the holy ghost my brother and sister it all goes up in smoke hallelujah we're going to live here after or not i won't name the name of the religion but one of the major religions has now revised its standard of belief and they've decided that whether there's heaven or hell is too complicated so they're just going to eliminate that from their teaching praise the lord you know what they've got follow the church and you'll be okay because i'm concerned about my soul and i trust every one of you are concerned about your soul we want to raise children that believe that it's important to know where our soul is going now i want to quantify this i've got to hurry along amen we're going to live here after or not then we have to come to jesus to get that the opportunity of choosing that's one thing god gave us he don't force nothing on us nothing you see why i approach you as a church the way i do we could preach this in such a factor of you this and you this and you god of this and you god of that but you see i'll get ahead of myself a little bit by the interjection of fear over time you can cause people to do almost anything but how about i'm not touting myself but how about a pastor has so much confidence in you that i believe by the holy ghost leadership you'll make the right decision that you'll do what it takes to feed your soul and secure your position in the kingdom that you by revelation and prayer and the opening of the word would be able to say this is the right way to go the map says turn here the map says stop here and i can believe this map because it's been revealed to me you see we have to have the opportunity of choosing that's one thing god gave us he don't force nothing on us he just lets us make our own choice so you have to not be forced but just make your own choice now look some of you might be saying what but i know a quote or two or three or four or brother branham speaks a little different well let's just go back in our thought he's going to make us right we're made to sit in heavenly places let's go to the rest of the definition of made used to say that someone has the right qualities to be or to do used to say that something has the right qualities for or to do something you see how god made you into a believer not by some headwrenching arm twisting he made you he made you with such a quality that when you heard the word there was something inside of you said that's who i am and as the brother branham lays out the little story about the little eaglet that was hatched amen it just thought it was an oddball but the day it heard the voice of its mother and said that is not a chicken clutter that's something i understand and that little that little eaglet was there now the part that brother branham i think he talks about him clucking and whatnot but he doesn't really emphasize it as far as i know but i personally want to represent it to you today that when that mother eagle flew over chickens are scared of eagles yes sir i tell you what look around our house when the big old hawks move into the tree by our house and you will see the cats they'll be slinking the house is right here and they'll be slinking along that hawks up there in the tree and it's talking to them tell them you're my lunch you're my lunch i ever catch you out in the open your lunch them chickens was there they see that eagle up there that little eagle that's up there going huh what's that and mama chicken get back in the church get in the church repeat the creed get back on the church come on get in here get in here and this little guy's like i just heard someone tell me come up a little higher i just heard someone tell me put my wings out and and fly but i've never been told to fly before i've never been told i'm being told to go and hide in the chicken house because my church will save me but here's an eagle wait that's not just an eagle what am i hearing my son my son you were lost but now you're found my son come it's like i understand that amen amen i always wondered who i was i didn't fit here what is this i'm called to go up a little higher well i'm actually i'm afraid to get into heavenly places i've never been there before what's brother brown tell them that little eagle he hops up on the fence post oh my as a believer of this message if all the higher you can get is a fence post then you ought to not even try no sir it doesn't fit does it get on the fence post then there's no none of that whatever to get on your wings and you can actually start come on those of you oh i hope this doesn't hurt your feelings those of you that won't lift a hand in church need to get off the ground and at least get on a fence post and once you're on that fence post you can go ahead and stick them all wings out start waving them around you can start kind of kind of doing something hey man but most of us would be too embarrassed to you know don't worry about me church i'm just exercising because i'm on a post right now but i don't plan on staying on the post i plan on getting up into heavenly places because i know i know that voice that called me is telling me to jump off this post but right now this post is my security what'd you say i said come up a little higher i'm trying i didn't tell you to try i told you to do i didn't tell you to try and get the holy ghost i told you to receive it i told you to accept it i told you to get yourself lined up with the word i didn't say try to get lined up with the word i told you get lined up with the word and then that little eagle little leap of faith talk about little leap of faith sister jerry and i was driving on the highway across the lower dam here some time back i'm just thinking about church i'm looking straight ahead and jerry is driving i'm not supposed to admit that um jerry's like look look and i'm like what right here i don't know the length of our church right beside us almost the same elevation of course the dam's elevated up here and same elevation there's an eagle fly you talk about majestic hallelujah i come to church i had to i had to preach about that a little bit because i just looked out at something and i thought there it is not some scrawny little eagle down in the chicken yard you imagine how out of place he felt people would be talking about in the name of the father and the son the holy spirit he'd be like what are you talking about that don't even make sense i can't even understand that well it's revelation i'm gonna go pray for revelation lord give me revelation that ain't right that's the revelation hallelujah so what's happening saints has the right qualities to be or do something amen this is the process of being made well hallelujah amen now back to this quote here i got to hurry along here oh my what are we going to do about eternal life that ought to be a question that we as ministers and priests of our home actually lift up before ourselves on a regular basis never let it become old news to us of what we're going to do about our eternal salvation amen so as we look at this i i need to keep going so look we have so much information about the dark ages right it's just there's just tons and tons of information if you ever i mispronounce as often as i pronounce it correctly but if you ever decide that you can just handle it pick up the fox's book of martyrs i often say mortars and my family reminds me but pick up a fox's book of martyrs read it cover to cover you'll understand what it was the spirit of that age saint augustine of hippo or whatever his name was he had a concept it's a spirit that's on laodicean nicolaitan pastors and that is you will worship god like i tell you to not from the dictates of your heart not according to the word of god you will do it like i tell you to and when the people push back they went and had a revival and prayed with them they'd get revelation right before they chop their heads off and then what that did moved fear that's why i referenced fear earlier to the next some stood and some didn't what was clear evidence of the holy ghost in that picture right there some said i'm looking at my eternal destination and they said that's all that matters and they burnt them well we won't even go to that it's just actually pretty gruesome really pretty gruesome the prophet of god made emphasis that spirit never died so as we look at this my brother and sister we see that it was actually a uh a forced uh a worship under man's religious idea and that spirit still there the idea that it would require to people to worship like you think they should i don't want to go there but i'm telling you that's not far removed from what we believe i will say it that way that spirit is not far removed saints i'm not trying to put some kind of boogeyman out here i'm just telling you there are those that want to dictate to you what you believe that's not called revelation amen so we see it's never worked reminds me a little story you don't mind if i share it's kind of humorous i'll change his name to little johnny well johnny got in the cookie jar mother told him do not get in the cookie jerry got in the cookie jar she whips him man before you know it johnny's back in the cookie jar she whips him again and it's not very long johnny's back in the cookie jar she whips him again finally after about half a dozen times she says johnny why do you do that mom i want a cookie you didn't get it you did get it kinda got it the idea that they thought they could overrule the desire of the heart with punishment children don't listen but you see when it comes to spiritual things you will not keep a son or daughter of god from going back to the word amen you cannot you can punish them you can whip them kill them burn them at the stake do whatever you you will not keep them little johnny wanted a cookie so bad that he knew that it was worth getting whipped to get the cookie oh did i clarify that every time he went back to the cookie jar he already nabbed the cookie before his mother nabbed him now you see johnny's desire for the cookie was greater than his fear of punishment but when the fear of punishment becomes so great then people start to conform you'll find this all through history amen so look at this uh uh you see what is to force the people to serve god in a certain fashion and and i've gotten my notes here many people think that that is behind us but they're wrong you see my brother and sister if god if you serve god from fear well there's two sides of obedience there's two sides of fear you serve god from fear which is terror or phobia you're not really serving god if you serve god from fear which is reverence and respect two entirely different results one is afraid to what will happen to him if he doesn't another one sees the blessings that will be poured upon him for serving god amen so it's there that we see this my brother and sister now let me take this little concept spin it to you real fast here as i gotta hurry along fear is a false positive to a christian can you grasp that i don't want to go to hell going to serve god what's the depth of that equation it's actually your terror of going to hell it is not your fear or reverence to god you see so it's there in that position so many people they they take this position okay i go to church my family supports the church my family's all in church and and you know praise the lord i just we we just yeah we don't want to go to hell you have a false positive you have this idea that all is well your spiritual position is good and so therefore you mark that as a positive thing but my brother and sister that kind of fear won't get you into heaven so it's that fear in reverence to the word of god amen but see satan wants to make this false positive a part of your christian experience he wants you to if i don't say amen i don't understand this there's things about the message i just don't get and i don't do that well my brother and sister it's one thing to say there's parts of the message that and the scripture i i honestly i can't explain them i don't really understand that but praise god the lord has led me and when i prayed that he would guide me to truth and here i am i just believe that and say amen to it but there's another side to that where people will say oh hallelujah amen why are you saying amen brother well i don't know why i'm saying amen it's just what we do in our church because i don't want to go to hell i'm i'm not articulating this very well so help me but you see the two sides my brother sister the two signs so satan is trying to make fear part of your experience we're afraid that our children that are lost they're going to remain lost we're afraid of this over here we're afraid of that over there we're afraid of the day that we stumble and have troubles in our life that we don't have the holy ghost my we're afraid afraid afraid afraid afraid my brother and sister that will never boost you or build you up into a christian who can come boldly to the throne of god it won't do it it will always hold you back because you're afraid just like people taking communion well you know i had a rough month or two months or whatever and and i i just don't want to take communion unworthily you know they're expressing fear but the man who expresses fear in reverence says you know what the word of god says the prophet says the pastor says that i can deal with this and i can come and yes it was a rough two months seemed like the devil ran over me and drugged me and strung me on the barbed wire fence and everything else but praise god i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god and i asked the lord to forgive me and as i was speaking to him he spoke back to me and i have a right to do this one doesn't come because of what they're doing and another comes in spite of what he's doing and people would say i don't know about brother so-and-so because he sure had a rough month well hallelujah how about you come hang out at his house at midnight actually don't because you'll get shot with a shotgun in the front yard but anyway you see what's happening satan using these fears fears fears we're not worthy we're not worthy i'll tell you what my family sister sue will be able to remind you you talk about communion set in church before communion you thought you were actually at a flogging there's some of you ought not be taking communion tonight you got spirits on you the devil's been leading you i don't want to have to call out your names so you should just sit in your seat not participate wait that thing you're accusing me of is already under the blood what are you talking about but you see the fear and after you whip the puppy enough times are you with me brother one time was talking about how you should never raise your children where they fear you and his boy was kind of a little bit behind him standing about arms reach he's talking about i don't know about these people raise their kids up to be afraid he said my son and his sons like like they say sometimes actions do speak louder than words my brother and sister what is fear god to do a place in the house of god i'll tell you let that fear come from the holy spirit let that fear come god dealing with you i read the quote uh wednesday or sunday about uh uh condemning the prophet of god talking about condemning you let the holy spirit do that we don't need this pulpit to do that let the holy ghost come down stir the heart and say lord forgive me for what i thought said did acted upon here forgive me lord and then as you have judged yourself no one needs to judge you but you see i want to drive this home to you fear is a false positive amen now let's look at this uncertain sound i've got to hurry along things i was going to be done by now in the garden of eden a man was divided in two parts the devil took his head and god took his heart reminds me of a story i read once i don't know why i feel led to share this but i will reminds me of a story i read once about a very pretty girl lived in a small town two boys liked her somebody said well what are you going to do they both are just wild about you she said i i don't know what to do this one over here with his little curly hair and his blue eyes just i just love looking at him but he's got my heart apply that right here man's divided in two parts the devil caught her attention can i can i just go along that does that make sense to you yeah devil got her attention but the other one had her heart you think well it'd be obvious she's going to choose the ones got her heart no it's not that simple no a lot of girls have married a rascal yeah lots and lots of young ladies have married a rascal because he was a good-looking rascal reminds me that same story the run rascal he'd bring flowers just as many flowers to the mother as he did to the daughter because he knew as long as mother was happy the daughter was his hopes young ladies are listening no i don't know that young ladies need to listen moms are you listening yes sir the devil makes him look at things and say well it just can't happen i can reason it out and god took his heart to dwell in his heart to make him believe things that his head don't even know nothing about you see the world we're living in my brother and sister too many people are serving god in their head and they don't understand they think they have the same revelation that you have and i'm not saying that to be arrogant but i'm telling you it's a dividing line and they've got it in the head and they believe they have the same revelation you do but it isn't in their hearts so they can't take it into the heart because the heart is actually the control center god took his heart to dwell in his heart to make him believe things that his head don't even know nothing about that's right so it's in your heart you think we thought we were thinking when it comes to serving god with our brain but it's not is it yeah do it johnny do it it's going to hurt do it anyway johnny it's going to hurt come on johnny it hurt now the head is what got them to do what they knew would hurt them not the heart because the heart had expressed already this is going to hurt but they went with the head and they said i'm going to be disobedient to the word of god no matter what and the heart is saying it's going to hurt it's going to hurt you're going gonna wish you'd never done that and the head says ah that's all right nobody in that church loves me anyhow so it's in your heart you think down here that's where the real certain sound comes from is from the heart that's where god talks and here's where the devil talks from so and i'm sure brother branham's pointing right up here to the head so let's cast down what the devil said and take a certain sound and that certain sound is god talking in your heart that's truth god promises isn't that beautiful now if the preacher is trying to use fear to get you to follow the message then there'll come a time they lose the fear but when the fear comes out of the word of god into you and you say that's who i am i am a son of god i am a daughter of god i am a child of god it moved from the head and the hearts now speaking but if we listen to the head too long i've got so many examples i could give you my i don't want to do that let's just kind of hurry along here i i just want to finish up sister emmy would you call musicians um we just have to we just have to say stop because there's just so oh my brother david you know what i'm talking about brother chris you know what i'm talking about it's like opening a book i know none of you have ever done this but you sit down in your chair at nine o'clock at night with a book and you started thinking i'm just going to read a few pages see what the book's about and at 3 am you're still reading amen that's the word to the heart of sons and daughters of god so good let's take it in a childlike form where every believer no matter what church you belong to and your pastor if he's a right man he will tell you that that you can only be saved through faith and not through works through faith now you believe that he saved you now first thing that comes from the heart you believe it then you walk up see not from the mind come on saints i'm just going to drive this home i've dealt in the last while with some people that would justify their behavior with quotes [Music] justified to act like a bobcat in a trash can got quotes to back it up what's the spirit of it what's the nature of it well i tell you what they've done i i i'm plagiarizing this off of a brother he said the prophet of god said now as believers he's talking about brahms but mean believers we settle things in the backyard this brother told me he says man you ought to see the size of some of these people's backyard it goes down to walmart and kmart and it goes over to costco and it goes to that side of the valley and that side of the valley that's how big their backyard is because they'll just take their argumentative contesting critical spirit everywhere it shows you how big their backyard is now you believe that he saved you first thing that comes to heart you believe it then you walk up and confess it say i accept jesus as my personal savior now i believe i believe he saved me that's not a physical thing in the world that you could prove that you're saved come on saints i want you to think about ponder this morning can you prove to me you're saved i've told you about the lady that sister jerry went to farm business i'm like wow where do you go to church are you holiness pentecostal what are you i'm a hippie long beautiful hair dressed so modest i sure she had to bend i'm a hippie i didn't know there was a rule book for hippies to dress that way but that's the way she dressed so sisters can you prove it by your dress never cut her hair can you prove it by not cutting your hair i mean after all you could just be a hippie in disguise walk up confess it say accept jesus my personal savior i believe he saved me not a physical thing get that outside in the world that you could prove that you're saved your eyes are the same color you got the same shirt you had on go outside the old gang says ain't nothing to do with that but you believe there's something to it can we say amen to that we believe there's something to it and now what if you say well i'm going to see how it works out in other words i'm just going to test drive being a christian now if god will answer my prayer about a better house better job a vacation to the bahamas on a cruise and a new tesla then i i believe it's real come on i'm going to see how it works out it'll never work out until you keep your testimony going oh look at this saints god has given us a privilege to every single day of our life say i believe this word and i can take that step i believe what god is doing in my life i can take that step what am i doing i'm keeping my testimony going i'm not stopping and saying well i'm just waiting when god moves i'll move well god might sit there a lot longer than you can wait [Music] hallelujah look at this you got to keep your testimony going you believe you're saved oh hallelujah i like this you believe you're saved you act like you're saved you say you're saved you associate with those that are saved and it works salvation is that right and the same will take place by divine healing you believe you're healed you act like he healed you oh now this is gonna hurt you say you're healed he's the high priest of your confession to make good on anything that you confess he's done before the father there it is come on saints that's why the prophet of god used that i almost bring that quote where he says now you you talk about i i'm no good as a christian he said you're talking the devil's language because that's not a holy ghost filled man or woman child of god's testimony i am worthy because he said i'm worthy i'm healed because he said i'm healed i've got the holy ghost because he said if i would follow this formula as it were that i could receive the holy ghost and i take that and i stand on that and then it is that i left as it were the scripture out of those scriptures today saints because you see it's not by anything that we have done lest any man could boast we have no boasting rights but i tell you what we have as we move on in ephesians 2 10. amen brother mason can you just go right to the front and pop that right back up ephesians 2 10. for we are the scraps from god's eternal factory no sir we are the whole reason that this come about us and the saints of the ages we are the reason saints oh god didn't just decide when it was all done look what i've done maybe i'll save somebody he said right from the very beginning these are my people i'll create an atmosphere i'll create a world they'll live in i'll create these spirits and let them roam free to hinder them and i'll create a spirit that i place in them and that spirit will overcome every other spirit on the face of the earth that holy spirit god himself said i am the only one of might and majesty i am the only one of glory no fear you don't see god you know there's two management style saints those that are proactive and those that put out fires and usually right before lunch i do pretty good on the proactive and from about one to five i run around and put out fires i'm looking for the day i can get the two together no i don't i want to claim the morning amen but look at this we are his workmanship [Music] if we could believe that god could make a mistake if we could believe that somehow god would be just like you know go on amazon go on ebay you can buy seconds i'm going to speak rough to you rough as paul gets if you want to believe you're a second today you go right ahead but i believe i'm the first of the thoughts of almighty god i believe that i am the intent and the purpose and i'll tell you what i really feel i believe absolutely on the depths of my heart that you are god's first choice you are not a second choice you are not a second as it were with a flaw somewhere that makes you worth less but you are the very reason of being oh hallelujah where's workmanship created in christ jesus unto mediocre no my brother and sister it's a devil that's telling you you're mediocre it's the devil that's telling you you're unworthy it's the devil that's telling you you're not living up to it it's a devil that's trying to put a fear in your heart that you can't live in this generation i study these things i'm sorry taking up time but i study these things and there's a huge proportion of young people when they interview them they say there's no hope for us the world is doomed my goodness some of them even believe in 10 years it's going to burst into flames and i actually kind of agree with him but it's not going to be methane gas or global warming amen it'll be the wrath of god see how they did that according to the scripture said that they would worship the creation more than the creator and we're seeing that come to pass oh it's the environment we should all care yes we should all care every one of us should care why because we have a stewardship to stand up not because we're concerned my brother and sister about what's going to happen to this earth in fact as i've said before global warming i don't know how much two-tenths of a degree makes [Music] but the lord just says wait that was my wife's voice honey would you please go in the kitchen and turn the stove on preheat [Music] we've gained two tenths of a degree over the last 15 years the lord said earth i'm turning you i'm preheating and they're worried about all of this but let me drag you back and then i'm done no concern over their soul [Music] not one concern over their soul but they will pour billions of dollars and billions and millions of man-hours to preserve the earth and not even one moment to preserve the soul [Music] hallelujah you see we are his workmanship created in christ jesus under good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them aren't you glad that you can walk in that today amen hallelujah let's just stand and sing a couple songs here you know as i often share these are the songs that when i'm studying they just come to my mind and i i have to admit that makes me a little prejudiced to the thought of them but i believe they're pertinent i believe they fit amen i'm a new creation hallelujah that's the creation we're worried about being rejuvenated renewed amen hallelujah [Music] hallelujah he redeemed me oh can someone say amen today i've been born again to win i thank god he justified me [Music] i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man all things are passed away i've been born again more than a conqueror that's what i [Music] i'm a am creation i'm a brand new missing of course again reverse two [Music] thank god he justified [Music] and i'm a brand new man for all things are passed away i'm born again for that of conqueror that's what i am i'm a new creation i'm a brand new amen and we say thank you lord hallelujah amen [Applause] hallelujah look let me just say it this way we'll sing another song or two if you find yourself and standing in the position of who you are saying i think then i want you to stop and get it out of your mind that's where we do our thinking get it down in the heart [Music] train yourself if you have to sometimes we create habits in our language we don't think we don't hope so we don't use the word might be we are that's what the word says things and you've got to train yourself to speak god's vocabulary if you want god's results this is not the power of positive thinking this is an absolute confession from the heart of who we are don't let one doubt one fear come into your language hallelujah i've been changed i've been to the water i've been chased i've been changed and i've been reborn all my life has been re-raised oh what a difference it makes when the lord has his way oh my life praise god has been taken well i've been to the water and i've been baptized i've been washed in the blood of the land i've been changed from the creature that i once was and redeemed is now my name [Music] [Applause] all my life has been rearranged what a difference it makes when the lord has his way all my life praise god has been changed [Music] i was lost in the darkness but now i found i was blind but now i see well i've been chained yes i have [Music] what a difference it made when the lord has his way all my life praise god has been changed when at last in his presence i stand above he will wipe every tear from my eyes and i'll thank him for giving a breath like me a new home [Music] all my life has been rearranged well what any friends it makes when the lord had his way all my life praise god has been changed hallelujah amen i pray that's a testimony of every one of you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah well of my whole index of songs that i had we'll just sing one more be
