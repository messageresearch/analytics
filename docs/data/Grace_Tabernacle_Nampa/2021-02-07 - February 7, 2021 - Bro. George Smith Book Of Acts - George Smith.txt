a place a perfect rest behind the inner veil so rest little bright rest for all is well can we say amen to that this morning all is well you know i was just um kind of a little back story here brother george has already preached a whole service this morning to some saints down in mexico and uh so uh you know he is here pouring his heart out sharing the word of god with them and i was just sitting here in the seat just studying a little bit myself and i come across this quote and then brother jason's songs uh inspired me to really read this and the prophet of god says here he says the greatest thing that i find against the church tonight is fear everybody is scared to death about something oh boy doesn't that fit the day that we live in amen everybody's scared about something scared to death about something what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy carefree up here and the brother testifying back there just free there ain't nothing i like this english there ain't nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of god that's in christ god has promised amen isn't that beautiful lord i put all my fears behind me amen you hold tomorrow amen and we trust you we believe you so i just encourage you this morning whatever god has laid upon brother george's heart let's just open ourself up remember we don't have to guard ourselves the holy ghost is our filter amen we don't have to sit here and try and do it ourself we can just let god and he promised amen and the prophet of god said god would never lead you away from his word do we have the holy ghost this morning amen that means he will lead us to his word we can trust him amen brother george god bless you this morning take your liberty thank you it's good to be here how does this go down um so good morning and uh we're glad to be with you and i'm just uh trying to get some adjustments made here but um that's fine uh we're not going to use the screen we have our own stuff here today but it's good to be with saints that are of one mind one accord we did have a interesting little service last night and um we trusted that'll be all the music dismissed when i was here a long time ago it was september of 18. all this time went by and we finished chapter 15 of the book of acts so we're going to chapter 16 now so everybody get your bible ready get your pencil on paper all you kids back there want to see a smile yeah and you can draw a picture if you see something if you hear something you want to draw a picture of you can draw a picture see it later might even give you a prize but um yeah we already had church once today we had a zoo meeting with the saints in mexico and there was people hooked in from honduras and from spain and so we've had an international meeting already but now we're going to go into the english bible and uh see what god has for us for the people in this area because people you know god has people everywhere and they're all hungry for the word so let's pray heavenly father we thank you for your mercy to us we thank you lord that we can stand before the purchase of calvary we thank you lord there's a group of people that care and that got up early and came to church we pray that you bless each one may everybody be able to take something home with them and it was worth coming to church bless your people bless brother paul the family protect us and guide us lord to speak only the truth we ask in jesus name amen so excuse me the pastor has a good heating system in his house and tends to drive me out a little bit but in chapter 16 is where paul picks up timothy for a helper he was a good choice and he proved out later to be very useful in the ministry and that's why paul wrote first and second timothy letters to his helper you know his associate but in verse 4 of chapter 16 and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem now what's that talking about that's talking about a church order letter that was written back in chapter 15 verses 20 and 21 and making things you know putting things in order making it real to the new converts because um they uh they needed some understanding they needed things to to kind of accommodate you know and we have we have tape recordings today you know we can listen to it anytime day or night everything uh brother branham said is in several languages on every cell phone on the planet so there's no excuse there's no lack of word in the you know world we live in and so um uh they were just helping the new believers and they weren't just out there repeating the book of uh whatever jesus said you when you read through the book of acts and i encourage you to do so because we're not giving you every word we're not going to spoon feed you this book of acts you've got to go read it yourself and see if these things are even true we're telling you but in all of the reading of the book of acts you're not going to find anywhere where they're just out there and jesus said and jesus said and jesus said it's not there they were just living it out naturally see and so in chapter 16 verse 5 we see that the work was growing it wasn't because of paul's wisdom it wasn't because he was so smart but he was smart he'd been to school a lot of people couldn't read back then but he had been trained and if we look into uh first corinthians chapter two we see here some of his um words that he used uh first corinthians two and verse one and i brethren when i came to you you know ministering and so forth i didn't come with excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything i put it all away and only not saying i preached to you was jesus christ and him crucified that is the essence of the message of the gospel and we don't need a lot of opinions and ideas and i think and i no that just took us nowhere out into the area of speculation and people living wrong lives and all kinds of crazy stuff but we have a sure word of prophecy because the original message is very simple brother branham says over here in uh sirs we would see jesus 1963. now these greeks were not looking for a lecturer somebody put all the words in order and you know the right adjectives and no they weren't looking for a lecture in jesus christ they were looking for pulpit clowns brother brown says it's clear back in 63. because he could see his prophet and we have them i've seen them some are my friends they weren't looking for that they weren't looking for entertainers they wanted to see him the person jesus christ they longed to see him because they had heard of him so these greeks had seen a referee a reflection in in some people well that looks good let's go find the real thing they want to see jesus so chapter 16 verses 6 and 7 we have now when they had gone throughout uh phrygia and the region of galatia they were forbidden by the holy ghost to preach the word in asia wow god closed doors yeah oh yeah verse 7 after they were come to messiah they saved that means they they checked it out weighed out the circumstance so forth to go to bithynia but the spirit suffered them not god closed his doors and so they had some good ideas they had plans but god knows best we have plans we'd like to do this we'd like to do that but god shuts doors sometimes you know got to go this way and they were you know they were seeking the will of god they didn't want to make mistakes and uh the whole world needed to hear the gospel so where would it matter reach here preach over there no god has an order footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord because if we you know uh if we go out here and have a pizza tonight we might have different ideas tomorrow what we ought to do it happens we are what we eat like it or not hello and i've been stable some people they got this cute little dog now they only give him certain things people take better care of their animals than they do their kids you don't feed that dog cold french fries you know so we are what we eat and it affects our leadings and so forth you know so there's a time and a place for things to happen psalm 46 10 says be still zip it i'm god i know how i'm doing don't need your opinions so do not feel bad uh at god for permitting you to go through what looks like wasted years because we all have some wasted years we'd like to you know just forget and you know he brought you to the gospel at a certain time he does know what he's doing he knows what he's doing about those little kids he knows what he's doing about your neighbors and all this other stuff is all for your perfection so many times like today we desperately want to know the will of god in our life everybody wants to do right so they asked brother branham a question how do you feel is the best way to find the lord's will in some important matters well most of our things are important you know so here's his answer i tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of god in some important matters is prayer amen oh man we already knew that remember naaman mighty naaman arrogant naaman and the word of god says go get in the muddy water are you kidding oh we got clean water where i live no so we don't need your opinions he says prayer now here's the way i do it i take it before the lord and it's always been my strength i wait except we have prayer we got weight i wait upon the lord to see what he says and i just let myself be neutral and don't take either side now see that's very hard to do because when you want something yeah whatever it is we're not going to go down the list but you know we're humans we've got to have new something you know and it's got to be red maybe uh but you got to be neutral just lord whatever you say when you say it so if i was in your place and didn't have these visions from the lord i would just wait upon the lord and say lord you now you show me what's the decision to make and then when in the way you feel that do it then wait a little bit then wait oh what's all this weight we're important americans we got forty thousand dollar car out here and we got we you know we wanted coffee at that one place but there's 10 cars so we get upset we'll go across the street to mcdonald's you know we can't wait wait and wait a little longer see which side you lean towards and then say now father in my heart you know it does not matter but i want you i want to know what you say about it so we just patiently follow god you know things will turn out right and we learn that the hard way right brother paul yeah it's very hard sometimes so in verse 8 they're in troas it's a port city in modern turkey and in verse 9 they get the green light okay where are we at 16 and 9. in a vision uh and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of macedonia now how do you think he knew he was from macedonia you think he had a sign on his back no they dressed differently in each country just like our friends back here they dress differently than we do well obviously they didn't they weren't born here you know so they had a certain way of dressing certain hat whatever okay it's macedonia and in this vision he's saying come over to macedonia and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go to macedonia that means they found the boat that's going there you know they didn't just lord you take us well you got to do part of it yourself gathering the lord had called us to preach the gospel to them so they had the green light and it was time to move out and they sailed from troas it's verses 11 and 12 over to philippi which is a roman settlement and verse 13 says here and on the sabbath now why why is that because that's when they had church okay you go when the door is open you don't stand out here on tuesday afternoon beating on the door what's wrong with these people no you come when there's church and you notice throughout this bible they got there on time too so um where are we at first um man i got lost myself verse 13 right on sabbath went out of the city what did they do down there by the riverside where prayer would want to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted theater so they they got the news that there's a bunch of women down there praying on the sabbath see when when jesus was here and you know back in those times there was a temple in jerusalem and that's where everybody went well then the romans destroyed the temple and after that they had synagogues is there one here in town any jews live here boys the big city so there's synagogues everywhere that's at least 10 men believers can form a synagogue so these women apparently was no synagogue there and they were they were believers they were gathered down by the riverside so they go down there and these missionaries they branched out you know you got to be flexible in the work of the lord can't always have a tie on you know like last night well it doesn't matter we're gonna look nice you know so they branched out down to a group of women by the riverside on the sabbath normally a place where they would gather to work you know that's where they wash clothes and but today they're praying so god was answering their prayer bringing the good news to him first they've ever heard of all this stuff all they knew up to then was repeating what their prophet had said moses said moses said and yesterday being the sabbath in every synagogue in the world they quoted a part of their prophet's words sorry over there in verse uh in chapter 15. it tells about that but um this was a simple meeting at the riverside and it was the first step of the gospel coming westward towards america towards nampa yeah it started someplace well it started right there with those women at the riverside verse 14. a certain woman named lydia is seller of purple i see it's full of details all you got to do is get in and read it that's why we're going over because people don't read the bible seller of purple of the city of thyatira i thought they were macedonia yeah well it goes on to tell us that she was of that tyrant she worshiped god and she heard us and her heart was open and she attended to the things which were spoken of paul and when she was baptized okay so they got all the way to baptism she's baptized and her household cb thought she thought beside us saying um if you've judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us in other words she begged us to come to her house so she's the first convert in the west to accept the message of the hour and she hosted the first church in europe in her home and she lived in philippi which is modern greece but she had moved there from thyatira now she was a merchant she had a business and she sold bolts of fabric she had a cloth store you know fabric store and her specialty was cloth dyed purple very important now purple came from murics that's a shellfish found only along the north eastern coast of the mediterranean sea very specific and it was most expensive of all the dyes at the time a mark of wealth or royalty purple cloth was ranked in value with gold it was used for emperors and temples so she had a specific job so her conversion didn't change her occupation but it dramatically changed her loyalty okay she was a real christian she was in love with jesus christ it wasn't just a matter of repeating what prophet said you got to have a life okay so she begged paul to stay with a few days and um but you know there's the twin now when we think of twins i don't see any here but are there any twins back here no well twins are normally uh we're attracted to them because they look alike you know i i met some twins no i think it was in venezuela and i asked them some well we're only five you know with a joint thing you know and so we think of of uh equal twins you know like they look the same but in our case here in the scripture there's the pretty and there's the ugly they're very different but they're twins so whenever god does something the other twin shows up yeah and uh they're at every revival you can just expect it verse 16 of chapter six and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel that's a girl possessed with a spirit of divination that means she was played with cards and and uh crystal ball you know all this from the dark side um she met us and she brought her masters much gain by suits saying you know telling fortunes and such and this girl followed paul and cried every day these men are servants of the most high god which show us the way of salvation and we know people that would just love that free advertisement but that's not paul you know every day these men show us the way of salvation and it was getting on their nerves so verse 18 and this she did for many days but paul being grieved now paul was a nice guy but you wouldn't want to push him too far because he was he was short and he had hooked nose and he had a temper and he was sarcastic so it'd be nice to be his friend so when he got upset watch out paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name jesus christ to come out of her and he came out of her the same hour okay so he obeyed because guess what hebrews 13 8 was real see we use it for rubber stamp no it's got to be shown out in somebody's life whether you smile don't smile it's going about react in somebody's life today you see and so 19 they have some problems and when her masters so she was she was owned by a syndicate okay so when her master saw that the hope of their gains was gone disappeared they caught paul and silas and they brought them into the marketplace to the elders or the rulers in other words just like a um like court but not quite and um so the slave girl you know she's a fortune teller she was caught in that bondage and she you know by her powers she was earning money for these people now they caught these two troublemakers and they brought him to the magistrates saying these men being jews exceedingly trouble our city no they troubled your your bank accounts with the trouble they're not troubling the city so much you know they couldn't even lie right and they brought them to the magistrates okay 21 and they teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being romans really so when the revenue ceased you know they were mad at god's servants they took them before the authorities and just like today guess what happened the system was corrupt and so they were all friends they stripped them down they beat up god's servants they put them in jail what we got in verse 24 here and having received such a charge they thrust them into the inner chur under the inner prison and they put their feet in stocks and everybody under 50 probably doesn't know what stocks are but it's two pieces of wood with little holes you put your feet in there and you can't move because there's two boards okay so they're not going anywhere and um so now they're in jail and paul and silas are they are they trying to call mother are they trying to call jerusalem hey what should we do now no it says they were praying and singing you create your own personal atmosphere now you want to be miserable well go ahead but i don't want to talk about it i don't want to see you create your own personal atmosphere now a couple years ago when the planes were crowded they're not crowded now uh i was sitting against the window over here and two rows up and the window over there there was a you know young guy with his mother's money probably and he had the headphones on and he had the music going and it was disturbing me that far away you ever know anybody like that and they ride their cars out here the same way well in those cases what are you gonna do make a scene hey no you just block it out and you hum your own song you create your own atmosphere you know and that's what they were doing yeah try it sometime so all of a sudden while they're singing now remember this is nighttime they don't have these kind of lights it's dark and they're just singing praying lord you see our situation praise the lord we're counted worthy to suffer for your name's sake these people don't know what they're doing but it's okay all of a sudden god sends an earthquake and it wasn't just an earthquake it shook the foundations of the jail and those stocks you know come loose and their hands are free you know you know just praise the lord so it was more than an earthquake so the jailer lived right there so the jailer is woken from his sleep and he sees the prison doors open and what do you think his first thought was go catch the prisoners no uh call the national guard no no just just fall on your sword you know prisoners all gone i'm responsible i'm a total failure i'll just out of my misery well what happened to verse 28 here but paul cried with a loud voice remember it's dark it must been a little light do yourself no harm we're all right here then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas so he realized something is different about these guys and they brought them out and said sir what must i do to be saved well there's probably a little more to the story there you know but they're giving us the highlights because okay you guys are different now why didn't you run away and well we're servants of the most high oh what can i do i want to be like you guys right and so um uh whatever it is you have that's what i want so verse 31 and they said all you gotta do is believe on the lord jesus christ and you shall be saved and thy house and they spake unto him the word of the lord and all that were in his house so they're having church and it took them the same hour of the night washed their stripes you know where they've been beat and they were baptized all this is done in the middle of the night like right now not when it's convenient right now yeah very amazing and um uh baptized and when they brought them into his house he said give him some lunch you know and rejoice believing in god with all his house well it's amazing so then the sun comes up it's morning and when it was day the magistrates sent the sergeants saying okay you know kept them in jail overnight now they let them go but not so fast hello the keeper of the prison told this to paul the magistrates let you go and now you can go in peace but paul said unto them uh hello they beat us openly uncondemned being romans hello and they thought us in prison now they want us to go out privately no no no they must come here and open the gate themselves and let us out and the sergeant told the words to the magistrates and when they heard they were romans oh they got scared then you know somebody important might find about find out about this so they came down and they let them go and say you know please leave so the prisons and ruins they're enjoying fellowship with the warden's house enjoying the blessings of god but they sat in prison waiting for the officials and so they left town they went to lydia's house and they had fellowship and there's that and much more in that chapter so take your time and read it because i don't know if you remember but i did bring a level i think it's the whole building it's off [Laughter] but um there's four steps to achieve balance in your life one every day everybody has got to read one chapter out of the bible minimum number two one page out of the church age book it will not hurt you i don't care what they told you number three you listen to at least 20 minutes of god's profit now you can do that between when you get in your car and when you get to work it's real simple then you take your mind off the bad traffic and number four you pray at all times so you do those four things during your waking hours and you will achieve balance in your life and you will be blessed and the church will be blessed okay chapter 17 and i don't see any clock so praise the lord well it's right here now we'll be out before lunch don't worry so chapter 17 verse one now when they had passed through em to polis in apollonia they came to thessalonica and there was a synagogue of the jews here we go again going to church and paul as was his manner went to them three sabbaths in a week you know in a row and reasoned with them out of the scriptures now what you got to understand they did not have a new testament okay it wasn't written all they had was the we're not going to ask but there's 39 books in the old testament and 27 in the new testament making up 66. so they had their old testament which was a translation that had been done in alexandria egypt it was about 200 years old so they had something in hebrew and that's what they studied and so he goes down there and he just reasons with them what was the point this day these scriptures have been fulfilled you all didn't know about it i'm here to tell you about it see so out of the scriptures opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen from the dead and that this jesus whom i preached to you is the christ yes simple simple gospel and here again today we got a simple gospel it didn't say go figure it out on your own i said only believe it's not difficult and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas and the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few so they were important women they also believed so paul's party they move on to thessalonica the capital city of macedonia and this important city was named in honor of a woman the sister of alexander the great okay they were both children of philip ii of macedonia and there was you know the synagogue and so they they reasoned with them from the scriptures demonstrating the simplicity of the gospel showing openly we're not going to read the whole thing i'll just give you a rundown here they had um had probably six points to his message that according to the scriptures the messiah had to suffer and rise again jesus nazareth was that very messiah and the possible title of his message could have been this day these scriptures have been fulfilled so he knew what he was talking about because he'd received it by revelation see he didn't have to call back for part two no he received a revelation that's right and uh he was very well ver very well worse in the scriptures ready and willing to speak to anybody who would listen uh many believed even the well-known women god was on the scene revealing himself to people to the ministry of repeating no preaching the gospel there's a difference people we have no place in our glorious message of 1200 recordings the brother random says now get together and press play it doesn't say that amen the big thing about brother brown's message is it's exactly a pattern of paul's message because beyond the curtain of time okay so the women had long hair and all these great beautiful things he couldn't even hardly describe but the key point of that whole experience beyond the current time is that the angel said now you're going to judge what you said what about paul well he's going to be judged too well then i preached exactly what he preached so everything's okay and all of us that were there were depending on that that you preached according to paul because we're part of uh what is ephesians 1 galatians 1 8 if any any other thing comes along different what i've told you it's wrong and how many things have we seen using this same bible so it's very important that we stick with the truth so he knew what he was talking about he received a revelation and many believed and god was revealing to the people to the ministry of the preaching of the gospel but guess what the twin came along every time 17-5 but the jews which believed not okay the unbelievers they were envious upset they took certain lewd fellows that's rednecks okay these are people off the street of the base of sword there you go and gathered a company and set all the city an uproar confusion and assaulted the house of jason why because they were staying at jason's house hey get those guys out here and when they found them not they took jason yeah well you'll do and um in certain ruler certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these have turned the world upside down and they've come here also nothing but confusion amen right verse 7 and whom jason hath received so they were staying at his house and these all are doing contrary to the decrees of caesar lies saying that there's another king one jesus and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things and when they had taken security ah jason put money under the table yeah yeah he said this is pretty hot potato here i'm going to give you all 100 and let me go sure enough it's right there that didn't start here it didn't start in mexico it didn't start in africa it's clear back there give them some money everything's okay yeah amazing let them go so the same thing happened to paul and barnabas in in 13 45 jealousy anointed the unbelievers they just can't stand it when there's a blessing over there and they didn't initiate it you know and um the the unbelievers and so they gathered some street people they formed a mob causing civil disturbances that sounds like usma clear back there doing the same thing organized confusion and um so he gave him some money out they go so what they do they've moved on forget this place and they were received many believe look at verse 11 these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind yes and searched the scriptures every day they read that chapter every day like i told you search the scriptures daily see if these things were so let's see if they're telling the truth or not you know they checked it out verse 12. therefore many of them believed also of honorable women there you go again and men not a few so things were happening the troublemakers and agnostics they had free time and they followed them because in verse 13 but when the jews of thessalonica those troublemakers down there had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea they came through there also and stirred up the people brother brown says the agnostics the troublemakers they're going to get worse and worse and worse they're not going away we're not watching them we're watching god and we're here we are in the same thing and immediately the brethren went sent away paul to go uh to go as it were to the sea but silas and timothy are both there still okay so paul was taken away for his safety okay they took him to athens that's 200 miles south timothy and silas stayed in berea they were ministering but when paul reached athens he told his friends go back and you know timothy and silas and tell them to come quickly okay so verse 16 while paul waited for them in athens his spirit was stirred in him yeah when he saw the city given to idolatry and that's why i get upset when i see idolatry because i know people right now today not 10 years ago right now burning candles to the picture of god's prophet yeah there's people with candles on this picture they're nothing but catholics they're not converted they just got a new saint to put a picture to it's happening and it happens in many different ways be careful that's right so where are we at here 17. therefore he disputed now that doesn't mean he went out arguing getting in their face that means he reasoned reasonably from the scriptures you see in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout people and in the market daily with them that would listen yeah so he was just asking questions he was reasoning keeping busy while waiting for his associates now paul was very good at speaking in public he was also very flexible it wasn't always in a church setting in athens he addressed the religious jews in the synagogue and then he addressed the regular greek citizens at the uh supreme tribunal and in the marketplace where all the people were but what really had him upset was the idolatry that he saw in all these places okay something that plagued humanity since the garden of eden and it's only got worse now those are making notes first samuel chapter 15. samuel the prophet also had to do had to you know deliver bad news to king saul in verse 23 of first samuel 15. rebellion and surely you know about rebellion if you raise children you know what rebellion is rebellion is equal to the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as or equal to idolatry bad stuff now my wife who's been gone i think 15 years god rest her soul but she had a way of dealing with things her mother was you know pretty much german no fingerprints on my piano in my refrigerator well out of here and so rebecca said there's things in children that have to be beat out of them they come hardwired from the factory with certain things that have to be beat out and this is it rebellion stubbornness iniquity idolatry that's right are all the same you see because thou has rejected the word of the lord god has rejected you being king so rebellion stubbornness equal to idolatry not from god now you might think that idolatry is only amongst the heathen or amongst the catholics our prophet has the answer reaction to action 1959 our nation now this is way back what would he say today our nation is greatly covered over with idolatry we might not think uh we might we'll say here uh we might not worship wooden animals and so forth as we would like to think of idolatry but that's not all idolatry consists of we sometimes make our automobiles and our clothes oh and the things we do we put as idols anything between you and god is an idol you see sometimes we make our church an idol we should never do that god is the only one we should worship so um in another place he's in the uh he's he's in the in the pulpit you know preaching and this lady comes up in the prayer line and she's got this picture and he says i see you have one of the pictures well that's fine i just want to speak with you for a moment i suppose we're strangers so forth but our lord knows you and he knows me and let's talk about the picture for just a moment okay so he's he's going to talk about the picture now this is important he says the pillar of fire that you see there everybody sees pillar fire right now we got some friends that have said that's a reflection well they're just they're gonna hold deeper every day and if you want to waste your time and your life and your soul go talk to them i know them it's waste time the pillar of fire you see there some time ago was a miracle performed a lady put the picture in her frame she had it on the in other words on the table beside her bed at the hospital and she was looking not at me of course but at the pillar of fire and this is her testimony the doctor had given her hop to die she claimed that the pillar fire came off the picture and hung over her two years late two days later she was dismissed went home well just a lady praying you know so um brother braham says right in the middle of the road is the true sound unadulterated gospel and power of god that's why we bring this to your attention so you can have a visual not over there not over here center of the road so we must find a way to stay balanced why because extremes are dangerous i was raised in mexico i know what catholicism is candles beads all that stuff and i was in colombia i think it was maybe two years ago and in this one church they've got a little statue and they claim that the beard on jesus face it grows every year not a wooden statue well i don't know maybe it does maybe it doesn't but we're not going to worship it and instead of wax candles they've come down to a bunch of little christmas lights no money involved don't have to lighten up to make new candles just plug it in so anytime i see lights has to do with the gospel something's not right here you know so extremes are dangerous okay verse 18 of chapter 17 uh then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoics encountered him so they come up against paul and some said what will this babbler say now these people in greece they had a lot of free time you know this was the height of their civilization and what's this this guy he's talking a lot let's see what he's got to say uh he seems to be a setter forth of estranged gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection verse 19. and they took him and brought him to the arapagas saying maybe know what new doctrine whereof that you're speaking of in other words we'd like to know what you've got we like new things for thou bringeth certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean and in parentheses for all of the people in athens and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing city full of gossipers not really to learn just what's new you know bouncing off of me you know so um so he ran into these people and today we would call them scientologists and humanists okay but in 22-32 he spoke a masterpiece to refute both of their theories uh anointed of the holy ghost he spoke boldly let's look at 22 for example then paul stood in the midst of mars hill it's still there today you madame athens i perceive that all things you're way too superstitious for as i was walking around the park here passing by i saw your many devotions so they were you know worshiping these these statues and things i found this one inscription down there to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him but i know him i'm here to tell you about him you see they had all these others and they kind of knew this was for that and the other but okay to the unknown god in case we missed anything this will cover it all but guess what i know him amen i'm gonna tell you about him you know okay and um so god that made the world on all the things seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made of hands neither is worshipped with men's hands as though he needed some anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for uh to dwell on the face of the earth and determine the times therefore have determined before the point uh the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far away from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets so he knew literature and he wasn't a dummy he's quoting reports for we are also his offspring for as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think of the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone or graven image graven art a man's device and the times of this ignorance god winked up you know he let it go after before but now he commandeth all men everywhere to repent that's the message because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained wherefore whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead see this is news to them they didn't have internet they didn't have newspapers and he's out here telling this guy died and he rose again that's the fulfillment of all these scriptures you know so it's the it's it's the gospel and uh some believed some did not but see i've got this other bible so we're going to be here a while because i've got two bibles and lots of notes brother brown spoke of a man named george lomza if you ever get a chance to buy a llamas a bible it's the same gospel just with a few other little words to make it more colorful so galatians 1 uh in this bible you look at yours and i'll read it from here let's see here galatians chapter 1 and verse 6. i am surprised how soon you have turned to another gospel away from christ who has called you by his grace a gospel which does not even exist in other words it's a zero how be it there are men who have stirred you up and want to pervert the gospel of christ but though we ourselves or an angel from heaven preached any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you let him be accursed in other words he's going straight to the hot place it doesn't get much more plain or does it so brother paul was reasoning with them from the scriptures demonstrating the simplicity of the gospel showing openly from their scriptures and that according to scriptures the messiah had to suffer and rise again amen jesus of nazareth was that very messiah real simple so his possible title could have been this day this scripture has been fulfilled so anyway in your spare time read first corinthians i mean first samuel 15 and um i'll tell you all about rebellion stubbornness so forth they're not from god and so we're going to take one more chapter don't go to sleep yet children party's not over yet so in chapter 18 paul and silas his trusted associate now they're in the midst of their second missionary journey now in the three missionary journeys that paul took he did a lot of walking sometimes he's on a donkey whatever never did he have a car i might have had a horse sometimes but in in 30 years he traveled about 10 000 miles and never got you know over 500 miles from the house so the dates about 49 a.d he at this point at 18 of acts he's already written the letter to the galatians and also the letter has already been written to the 12 tribes which we call the epistle of james but in verse 1 of 18 after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth now corinth is about 20 miles west of athens it's a city well known for idolatry and very bad reputation of its citizens because on the edge of the city and here again by the grace of the lord i've been there once on the edge of the city was the great temple to the goddess diana okay complete with women priests every kind of perversion and it's one of the reasons that paul seemed kind of heavy-handed against women some completely out of their place and doing every ungodly thing what's interesting when we were there many years ago we were with a bunch of christian people not believers we just got attached to this other group and so they're taking us around so we had this guide and of course she's a guide because she knew both languages real well and so here she is an address that's not quite long enough and she's about 21 and she's telling us how that the reason that paul was so you know heavy-handed against women because you know all that's going on over there what about you honey you know so uh paul was very sure what he preached about because he had received it by revelation see now in your church age book chapter 1 paragraph 98 we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world more than your new clothes more than the car payment more any revelation we have accepted the bible we've accepted the great truths of it but it is still not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not there every church in this city is using this same bible today but as soon as they get out then they're talking about something else there's no revelation the word has not been quickened so galatians 1 8 you know paul was very sure of his revelation and uh if if an angel himself comes down and we've had it right over here salt lake great angel but now let's let's be honest people how much trust they're gonna put in an angel whose name is it just doesn't work but they think it's great okay so paul had to deal with a generation of people women out of control living out of scriptural bounds and brother branham faced the same situation right and uh it seemed like his message was focused on women but there's a quote here in a great message choosing of a bride april 65 that i'm sure that wherever you come from you never heard this quote but if she can hold herself right in other words balanced in every way modest apparel eyes on calvary what a greater reward she has than a man she's on a testing ground hey the big guys today they don't want it they don't want to we've got to be in charge but the woman has a greater reward if she can keep herself balanced so there's a continuity of the word of god and the spirit working in the seven messengers especially we can associate you know with the first messenger and the seventh messenger and um so hebrews 13 8 is still in effect today that verse is not time dated see amen for those that follow the word not following personalities or we're humans we're idolaters a lot of times you know genesis 1 says every seed after it's kind that's why you come by the lutheran church they're lutherans there's nobody's trying to get out of that church they're happy there across the streets christian church oh here's baptist church catholic they're happy there and you're happy here and even though we might bring something that oh that hurts but it's word so we line up we stay balanced okay what do we got here melchizedek great prince and king 1955. a few nights ago in a prayer meeting a man said to me the holy ghost was given only to the 12 on the day of pentecost of course that's pretty ignorant you know and i said well then what about 120 that was there at the same time they received it how about down at the house of cornelius the gentiles received it 33 years later when paul was asked he asked the baptist if they'd received the holy ghost since they believed and he laid his hands on them to receive the holy ghost setting the church in order in corinth he also set the church he also said in the church oh here we go again apostles prophets teachers evangelists gifts of healing all those marvelous gifts years and years after pentecost well then it is today to every believer go into all the world preach the gospel to those that agree with you doesn't say that every creature that's why you got to be nice to the dog and the cat every creature i didn't put it in there you know how far all the world amen how many all the people every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils and heal the sick and so forth there you are it's god's promise that he swore he would do it no matter how much no matter how much rises up to try to counterfeit or impersonate or how many things rise up to try to contradict to take it down it will go on forever so god has swore by himself he will keep it amen so when this church burns and all this everything's gone god's word will still be true and he doesn't need our opinions remember though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel let him be accursed okay verse two of where we have chapter 18 he lodged with this couple the name is aquila and priscilla and they were also jews and they worked in tent making okay they didn't have sewing machines had to stitch it so they had a trade they manufactured affordable mobile buildings for working living and traveling like travel trailers economical rvs and we'll see about these this couple a little later so in chapter 18 verse 4 paul went to church when the doors were open on their worship day of the sabbath and he spoke openly with jews and greeks and so finally his helpers arrived from up north but the opposition was great and it says in verse 5 that paul was pressed in the spirit and when a minister is pressed in the spirit something's going to give you don't stay that way it blows up sooner or later one translation says he was not free to speak because the jews opposed him and blasphemed as he testified that jesus is the christ well that would build some pressure so this right here verse 5 of 18 was a real turning point for paul okay he had worked hard he had endured opposition beatings prison and now open blasphemy so he shook the dust off his coat and he said in verse 6 where's that let's see here and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own hands i am clean from here on i'm going to the gentiles forgets you people i got a work to do you know so sometimes you just got to push delete and move on not worried about pushing play you got to push delete yeah it gets pretty serious so we would like to everyone we would like for all people you meet this week you'd like from all to enjoy the truth oh how are you baptized oh wow it says right here it's not going to happen you know we'd like them to to believe the truth and live in peace with god but some are just not cut out for it so you're wasting your time you got to just give a little bit if there's no if if they receive it well then you give them a little more but you pushing the truth isn't going to change their mind they'll just make you miserable and eventually they will blaspheme so you have to move on and you can only help those that ask for help no matter how much experience you have how much truth you know and how much bible how much message you can quote if they don't ask for help it's true so let's look at verse 7 where it says and he departed and entered into a certain man's house named justice uh one that worshiped god whose house was next to the synagogue that means live right next door had shared the same wall it's right there justice 8. and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians heard and believed and were baptized so they're having you know some results then spake the lord to paul in the night by vision quote be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in the city so that was the word of god to him for corinth now that might be word of god for somebody else but you better be careful once you start quoting because you can you can bring something out and god's saying move on but half of god said well that was to paul let's leave it alone and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them so he stays there for 18 months in corinth setting a local church in order by permission you know vision of the lord so 12-17 once again the fanatical religious jews take paul into court now it might seem like we're being kind of harsh on the jews but the fact is these were religious people they quoted their prophet precisely and this guy over here manifesting those words we can't have that we gotta stick with the quotation and the jews are to this day they're just cut out that way i love them i've got all kinds of friends over there but they'll tell you when there's two jews arguing there's at least three opinions it's just the way they are you know so they showed up took him into court this guy is persuading men to worship god contrary to the law he was only showing christ from the word okay that they said they knew but they had no revelation so the judge realized it was not a single case but a religious issue threw him out verse 14 of 18 says uh so paul was about to open his mouth for you know his his uh defense and galileo said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness oh you choose reason uh word that i should bear with you but if it's a question of words and names and your law you guys take care of it i'm no judge in such matters and he threw them out of them out of here yeah so the greek citizens they're really upset so they beat up one of the chief rulers of the synagogue and the law did nothing just look the other way same spirits we have today 21-23 um now he's on his third missionary trip strengthening the disciples bringing words of encouragement let's look at verse 24 here we're just about done and a certain jew named apollos born in alexandria uh an eloquent man yeah he could really put together and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus and this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only up to the baptism of john and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue and when a cohen priscilla heard this they took him home for lunch you know expounded to him more openly the way of the lord and when he was dispersed when he was disposed to pass on him to asia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come help them much which had believed through grace for he mightily convinced the jews that uh that publicly showing by the scriptures that jesus was the christ and that's as far as he knew he didn't know all the rest of it you know and he he knew a lot of the message but he didn't have a lot of revelation he was still with the baptism of john it was marvelous for its particular day but the light had moved on he just wasn't aware so he came from alexandria alexandria still there today he's a chief port city in egypt and that's where the more readable user-friendly greek translation was made of the old testament commonly called the septuagint and it was finished 200 years before christ and greek was the trade language commonly spoken throughout the ancient world so they had to have you know bible they could all understand and this was the bible that peter quoted from you know when he preached to jerusalem and the one that apollos and paul used and even to this day it's the bible used by the greek orthodox church now we're just giving you these details kind of put things in order the greek orthodox church is based in istanbul turkey and it's simply the eastern side of the catholic church rome is the western side you see and they were one church until they couldn't agree on doctrine and they were divided in the year 1054. and just about two years ago the two heads got together again and shook hands so that's right so the revelation of the word for the day which these people lived they were living in the glare of another day you know so all god's word is true you know all of this is true but we're not building an ark today we're looking for the exit of the laodicea you know and uh we're under the umbrella of the seventh messenger we love all the word it feeds our soul that's where you can read any part of the bible anything you go any place and read a chapter in fact you know if you if you're a minister or have some kind of calling you ought to be able to open your bible anywhere you got two pages you got four columns got all kinds of references got some good notes at the bottom you ought to be able to just open anywhere and preach for 40 minutes and if you can't go back and read it again so the message continued to be the same apollos was speaking the same thing and um the lord commenced to bless his ministry so we're going to stop here i promise to come back sometime between now and two years but i will be back even if i have to drive if they if they make this so bad that you've got to have the vaccine to get on the plane i'll drive but this guy's not taking the vaccine okay so thank you brother paul and thank you all for your undivided attention amen isn't that good you know just uh i i was just thinking about it kind of a casual walk through this scripture right just to to look at that and i've always been amazed uh you know imagine what it would have been like saints to have actually lived this out and we think oh it would been so different would have been so much but you see we're living in a modern day book of acts we are living in a time that the word is fulfilling things are happening but god has chosen in such a fashion that he doesn't just come and say oh you just fulfilled the word we just simply are living it out each day and brother george when we were talking i don't know in the last couple weeks you know he made a comment to me about that he says i think people are too worried about all of this when really what we need to do is just live out the gospel and i believe that with all my heart it struck a deep cord with me we we get so worried a doctrine is important but we get so worried about all of these things when really what we were called to do was live this gospel out let the life of jesus christ live out through you and i and in that my brother and sister we'll find by god's grace his mercy will find we are living on the cutting edge of revelation in our day i i won't go into this because i could almost preach to you here because of this thoughts that i've been studying the last few days but let me paraphrase something the prophet of god said he said something somewhere has to be prepared for this to be manifested and that's what's happening in our life the preparation is taking place in our life that we can live out the word for our day isn't that beautiful i i just uh i just it stirs my heart because you see i couldn't prepare myself you couldn't prepare yourself but the holy ghost in you is making that atmosphere for god himself is how the prophet of god said it for god himself to come down reveal himself in you isn't that beautiful not just to you but in you hallelujah thank you lord we're just a bunch of nobodies but we are been filled with somebody called the holy ghost amen and we're going to live this gospel out amen it makes me want to sing give me that old-time religion amen go back in time you know i tell you if the apostle paul saints if i could just interject this if the apostle paul was here today we'd be nervous because he wouldn't be afraid to tell you you're wrong this is what you need to do but we've sugar-coated it and we kind of all have a little bit of a political uh you know [Music] bend to us and we don't want to offend anybody we don't want to lose a friend and we don't want anybody to be offended but i tell you let's stop that mentality and just put one site before us and that being lord i want to make the rapture if i have to if i have to be corrected if i have to be whipped for the gospel whatever has to happen lord just let me be ready that's what my heart is so let's just stand and sing that little song give me that old-time religion brother jason would you come hallelujah well i just want to say thank you to brother george i enjoyed last night i will admit my disappointment last night there was a couple times i was like elaborate elaborate elaborate and brother george moved on but maybe when he comes back again in just a few months we'll be able to get him to elaborate brother george and i have a unique friendship he tells me what he thinks i tell him what we think and we both do what we want so amen well it's the old time holy spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me give me that old old-time religion give me that old-time religion gave me that old-time religion and it's good enough for me it will make you stop your life it will save you when you're dying it will start the devil flying and it's good enough for me give me that old-time religion give me that time religion gave me that whole time religion and it's good enough for me it's so good i want no other or it makes me love my brother and it bring things from undercover and it's good enough for me give me that old-time religion give me that old-time religion give me that [Applause] amen and they were prepared to perform the word of god not to just talk about it not just to sing about it but to actually make it come to pass brother jason would you come and just lead us amen maybe another song or two yeah i'd love to sing joel's army hallelujah [Music] i have a green screen all right morning stars together sons of god his praises ring arise and
