about that and then um brother Jose will be here next weekend Lord willing next weekend so looking forward to hear hear what Lord's been speaking to him on Amen amen I think that was that was that it

blessed be the Lord God Almighty who was it is to come blessed be the Lord God Almighty who lives forever more blessed be the Lord foreign [Music] can we say thank you Lord amen amen you know many are looking for him to come the prophet of God lays out the comings of our Lord Jesus amen he's come to his bride amen it's here in a courtship it's here in a fellowship it's here in a relationship and I'm so thankful that he has come today that we're not just sitting here with just a hope for something of the future but we are here today having our Lord Jesus Christ present in our lives amen amen breathe Elijah sister Rachel God bless you and welcome Amen brother Elijah I hope you live up to all the boasting they have done about you I don't know are you guys still on your honeymoon [Laughter] oh Rachel you cynical little girl you oh brother Tim God bless you your birthday as we've already announced our brother Jose Lord willing will be next Sunday I wanted him to I invited him for this Sunday here but uh just some circumstances come up and he felt the need to put that off so uh we just asked him to come this next Sunday share always enjoy brother Jose just a fresh perspective of the word amen and um we want to remember also this evening kind of sprung it on all of you but if we're not careful sometimes things just get carried out further further further so definitely was on my heart to have a bible study this evening and for those of you who like to do a little research the topic will be on forgiveness uh the covering of the blood blood of bulls and goats amen so you can look into that this was brought to me by a brother who had a question mark over this he's not from the church here and we just discussed this and it really was strong upon my heart uh for us just to dig into that amen and obviously I think everyone knows that the Fourth of July brother Trevor sister Kerry would like to host every one of you at their house amen you might coordinate to maybe bring something to help a little bit um amen I didn't know about brother Chris certainly sounds like the devil didn't want him to drive to Sandpoint but uh God is good amen and remember brother Trevor's sister Carrie this morning the devil anointed their dog to eat the whole bone and so they had to take their dog to the vet and he is a cute little guy so certainly wouldn't want something to happen there we need to pray for the believer's work situations now when I say that it's all not dire but I'll just be bold our brother vasili you know has some desires but this company is working for uh kind of a little bit Taskmaster and uh we just want God to come on the scene and anoint that our sister April while she is a very busy sister but yet her job has a very hectic schedule attached to it if you have too much work or a lack of work God's still in control amen and so we want to just lift those things back up and so we just want to do that remember we forgot our brother Alex I don't know how we did that but brother Alex um with his new job uh they asked him to go out of town to meet some new employees so they could all kind of coordinate together he'll be home this evening and it shouldn't happen too often but he he uh just felt like that you know this was something they desired in and uh it sounds like it'll be a good job for him let's turn in our Bibles uh thank you musicians Amen brother Isaac amen I want to speak to you once again on things that are to be because see the word speaks to us and says that certain things are going to happen before the coming of the Lord before a Rapture takes place and and we look at that and realize my brother and sister for all that we see in the world today all the things that are negative and we say oh my how can Humanity go there but if you'll just stop and you will look at it carefully you'll see that it's nothing more than Satan's counterbalance that he's trying to put in place to counter what God is doing with the elect lady amen so when you see as I've spoke to you before we we tend to pull back from what seems to be the world's vocabulary their their words but my brother and sister the bride is awakened and Satan come along and says I need to wakeen up my people too and so as he wakes up his people we focus if we're not careful on the woke movement but my brother and sister there's a bride that's been woke up amen she's come out of a stupor amen the scripture tells us how that they were there and even at the coming of the Lord at that time they slumbered and slept so God's got an Awakening for the bride of Christ amen and I say thank you Lord that you're waking us up amen that we will not be those that are asleep it is coming and so we look at these things and realize how blessed we are that what God is doing in our life and so I want to speak to you this morning I I wrote down so many titles that this is the one that finally floated to the surface the elect lady manifesting the bride's rehearsal and we take this thought out and it will be actually the very last thing we close this service out with but you'll see what the prophet of God is talking about there and you'll be able to look back and see where brother Paul was at let's turn in our Bibles this morning and I just want to say it is good to be in the house of God it is good to be here to look out upon your faces ones that we love and just know that when we get to the other side we're going to look over and we're going to be so filled with joy to know that these are the ones got called us to serve with called us to reinforce to cover each other's back and and I think that's wonderful amen acts the 14th chapter just uh two verses I think will help us lay the foundation of our thought today acts 14 and 27. now if you look back up in the book of Acts you'll find that uh they were in such a tizzy over the truth being preached they stoned Paul and they drag him out of the city believing he's dead and it says that the Believers amen the disciples they were there standing round about now my brother and sister God did not call them for an armed Revolt no doubt there could have overpowered those that were stoning but God didn't call that because you see there is a great host of witnesses and just as today you will can be rest assured that there are countries China being an example where the Saints are actively persecuted and thrown in jail for what they believe but yet we enjoy a liberty amen so it's not to rise up in a physical sense but it's for the word to reinforce the hearts of this body of Believers which is not just Grace Tabernacle it's a bride of Christ and every portion of the body is contributing its portion to the economy of God and so we get to enjoy some Freedom we don't know what the future holds but I Know Who Holds my future I know who holds your future amen and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how he had opened the door of Faith unto the Gentiles and there they Abode long time with the disciples Heavenly Father we ask you Lord Jesus this morning just to bless your word father just help us Lord to speak it out father in a fashion that's pleasing to you and a benefit to your people we ask father for every spoken and unspoken need father that you would just come and touch lives change lives draw us closer to you Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as we look in the thought today my brother and sister we'll see the Lord is always working behind the scenes and I asked sister Ruth for permission to bring this as an example but sister Ruth here a few days ago shared with us a lovely testimony how that for years there have been certain things that had bothered her life and how God has come now my brother and sister was not an overnight miracle as it were that took place but nonetheless the fact that Satan would want to afflict or to bind it is a miracle without a doubt amen but yet God is working behind the scenes just slowly changing our circumstance bringing about the promise of his word and it that's where it all lies my brother and sister it's not what you and I can do it's not how strong we are or what we can articulate but it's God working through us and if God works instantaneously as what we would call a miracle my brother and sister so be it we believe in miracles we desire Miracles but if God chooses to take you and I on the long path as we look at the book of Pilgrims Progress you know there was all kinds of paths that were out there and he didn't call each and every one to the same path some Take the Long Road amen and if God chooses to take you and I on the long road nonetheless it's God who takes us amen and so we appreciate God working behind the scenes many times changing our circumstances now as we sit here this morning is there needs in this body yes there are but I tell you my brother and sister sometimes we need those needs amen theirs where the molding takes place there were the character is formed it's in those needs or times of adversity that we actually become mature Christians amen if it was all just smooth imagine what we would be now you you see sometimes in the great storms that come in this last few weeks we just had some pretty good storms coming as you go through the countryside through the neighborhood you'll see trees my brother and sister that blew over and you'll realize they had no deep root they literally tear up half of the yard but all of the roots are just right there at the surface that's not the kind of Christian that will survive laodicea God wants to shake you and I and root us right down into the very Rock because it's in the rock that when this storm comes we are there and we can then determine as it is I will stand amen can we say that together I will stand amen so it's there that we make up our mind you say well if I'm the seed of God then then I will endure my brother and sister the seed has a manifestation the seed has to bring forth of its own kind so we can't just say if I'm seed if I'm seed we have to demonstrate that we are seed and when God comes and starts to move in our life the demonstration or manifestation of this starts to come to pass amen and so I want to explain the thought behind my title today as I have read to you the scripture of the elect lady how she's found standing in truth now my brother and sister this elect lady just didn't happen she didn't wake up one morning and she's just the elect lady she's just not uh brought from nothing into a complete work but this elect lady started out if I could bring it in this context she started out as a young girl she started out as an immature and as God is moving my brother and sister many people would say well uh we wonder about the message I hear this from people I wonder about the message there's this doesn't seem to be any difference between us and the rest of the world well my brother and sister if you're looking at the message as just a church that you you attend there is nothing different than the rest of the world but if you are looking at it that regardless of what is happening around us God has got a chosen people predestination being manifested coming to life and so what is that that's when the roots get below the surface amen that's when they get down and take a horse of something and some people say well you know we come out of the Methodist Church well we could go back and just be methodists it wouldn't be much different you go back and you'll find out you're going to be one of the most miserable people on Earth amen if you are the bride of Christ if you are predestinated you can't live in that environment amen so some have tried it and praise God they come back and some are still coming but we claim them in the name of Jesus Christ amen and so as this is moving forward we see that God had to do something in such a fashion that God chooses amen he's the one that chooses the way that he desires to work and so as we see this we see the Apostle Paul now recorded in the book of Acts now remember the prophet said that we would be if there was another book of Acts written in other words it's not that it's not happening I want you to catch this get the words right it's not that it's not happening if it was written on a page see people get this well no the prophet said and if there was a nut no it is happening my brother and sister it's just that God's not choosing to record it on the page because there won't be another generation or church age of Believers to need that word recorded on a page so God said what I've got is sufficient but if there was another book of Acts written we would see the same manifestation of the power of God now look at the Apostle Paul he's there he preached the word bold I'll tell you what I I just keep asking the Lord help me Lord with wisdom to be bold I don't I don't want to be the timid Christian I want to be a bold Christian but bold doesn't mean rude bold means that courage is there at the surface amen for us to stand on the word now Paul he preaches the word as God lays on his heart brings him to a place that we would In the Flesh think now my friends should be here to defend me but God chose because he was making Paul a witness amen God chose to let those Disciples of that day set back and watch Paul be stoned now my brother and sister in that day if you just read up a little of the history they didn't just throw a rock or two to make you feel bad hurt ache no they were intent on killing with those stones and it's just hard to imagine people who believe they were doing God's will could have such angst to approach it in such a fashion that if you're not in my church then we're going to Stone you but they were angry because the spirits were being disrupted amen the system oftentimes we look at that and say well this church is this and that church is this my brother and sister just recognize its Spirits it's the spirits that don't like to be disturbed amen so as it is Paul is stoned and they must have just beaten him bloody with these rocks my brother and sister and they drag him outside of the city believing they're dragging a dead body now this wasn't a body that would have even had breath in it my brother and sister they they didn't believe that he was still alive and would expire soon they thought they had killed him and yet the power of God was not finished with him and I want to tell you this morning that when the Devil comes in like a flood he cannot take your life he cannot defeat you till God is finished with you and then he might use death as a vehicle to take you into the presence of God but Satan will never come out the Victor amen so we look at this and Paul's there outside of the city now surrounded by those who are followers Believers of the gospel and God comes back the Breath of Life the very Life of Christ comes back in him and he rises up in just a matter of time he is traveling once again to preach the gospel now my brother and sister these are some of the hard afflictions that Paul refers to in his life amen you can't walk away from something like that without being scarred without being damaged in a physical element but I want you to catch this here in Acts 14. amen and when all of these things had happened they come together they got the whole church together amen that's why church is more than just someone preaching to you it's a church sharing what God is doing within our midst amen within our lives and we're seeing God as I use sister Ruth as a witness we're seeing God Work behind the scenes it's not all upfront Supernatural oh look at the bolt of lightning look at this look of that God is moving in our midst he's changing lives this morning amen and and so as we'll see this taking place the church come together and they rehearsed all that God had done with them not to them my brother and sister with them they saw God as their friend as their father as their brother as a part of the body with him it was not God made me do this but it's God anointing you and I where we say Lord can I do something for you amen can I be a part of this movement can I be a part of what you're doing in this day and so as it's there that uh what God had done with them and how he had opened the door of Faith unto the Gentiles now my brother and sister if we really just stop for a moment it's not too hard to comprehend how important that is to you and I that the door was opened to us as Gentiles so God chooses Paul's suffering Paul sacrifice complete surrender giving of himself to open a door how much more so we should be thinking about opening the door for those around us whether it's family it's friends or whatever it might be but to see Lord let me be the sacrifice let me be one Lord that might suffer that the door might be open for a brother for a sister can we say Amen to that amen and so we see now they rehearse this and the word rehearsed we won't get into all of Webster but you know there's a foundation of that to to prepare to practice or to recount something and so what they were doing was recounting to one another how that God had used the word amen that was brought by a brother brought by a man amen and it come and that was a door that was being opened to the Gentiles and I say thank you Lord because we're here today amen having walked through this door amen now we must look my brother and sister we must look at this and realize what the finished work of God is we've said this many times I believe you understand it uh correctly but my brother and sister the finished work of God is not a snapshot in time like us today this morning God's looking from the beginning to the end and he's saying hmm my plan is working perfectly everything's right on time everything's according to what I declared what I spoke actually started with a thought and when I spoke before the foundation of the world it's going according to plan now we can sit here and say you know seems like chaos is in our family chaos is in our nation chaos in the whole world my brother and sister in the plan of God it's going perfectly according to the plan amen and we ought to just stop and say Lord let me just realize that all the way back with the Apostle Paul you opened the door now you are anointing us to walk through the door a common phrase that we use as it once was death to go Beyond the Veil but now you have to go Beyond the Veil so the door of the veil of Christ amen which is the Holy Ghost has been opened to you and I that we can walk through it and freely receive of him that is not a gift as it were something in a box with wrapping paper on it but it was the very life of Jesus Christ he gave to you and I and my brother and sister the phrase we hear it a lot you know if you have one teaspoon of the ocean you have the ocean amen every element that is there and so when Christ said I am going to pour myself into you then we have every element of our Lord Jesus Christ that ought to be something to say thank you for amen so we can get caught up in the struggle of the day amen we look at this I know none of you make mistakes but it's people like you that make mistakes amen and as we look at that the devil will try to tell you that you know there's a problem here but I want you to stop and say Lord I recognize in the word the door was open to me can you say Amen to that the door's been opened to us you wouldn't be here this morning the world's too attractive the world's too beautiful the world's too easy my brother and sister you wouldn't be here today but God ordained for you to be here and something inside of you you might not be committed this morning but what you don't realize is God is pushing the seed down and watering it and it will come to pass that you wake up one day and realize I can't live without him amen but we get caught up in the struggle of the day do you ever do that get caught up in the struggle of the day all the other details all go out the window and at the end of the day you sit down at the supper table and say you know I spent all day on this thought or process or problem and I forgot to do this and I forgot to do this and I forgot to do this and the devil can even do that at the end of the day you'll realize you never even prayed or maybe you never picked up your Bible because you're so caught up you woke up in the morning I've got to go do this I've got to go do this how do I fix this problem my brother and sister the struggle of the day is real don't let anybody ever tell you just just ignore the devil and just go on my brother and sister the devil's real and sometimes he shows up as a water pump in your minivan amen sometimes he shows up as a problem you get up in the morning walk out flat tire I'm going to be late for work and then that bothers you and then the boss bothers you and then it bugs you the whole day and maybe the whole week and maybe the company's talking about laying people off and you oh will this be a factor and the devil anoints every bit of that whole chain there but my brother and sister when we get caught up in the struggle of the day the day will turn into a week and the week into a month and the month into a year and then we'll find that people will be talking about well you know a year ago I was on fire for God why aren't you saying today I'm on fire for God is because the devil has got in the struggle and the struggle has overwhelmed us and Satan keeps us from getting through the door into the presence of God because in the presence of God is deliverance from the struggle amen and so as Satan tries to anoint these things to bring it about my brother and sister I want you to realize today that this is all just a rehearsal you realize what you think is life and death here today is nothing more than a rehearsal amen this is not the final work this is not who we are if this is all we have to live for is to get up and work and and see our our children grow up amen because while they're growing up we're growing old amen and so you look at that it's like what is their excitement about that my brother and sister but I tell you if this is all there was then we don't have much to look forward to but this is nothing more than the rehearsal of what God Said glory is going to be you as an overcomer you as Victoria you with my presence filled with the Holy Ghost my very life in you and you get to live eternally like this and this is the molding of it this is the rehearsal amen and so you look at this and realize that this great finale that is coming now my brother and sister interesting how subjects come up somebody mentions to me the other day well what do you think brother Paul about a little movement here and the little thing that's happening there and some folks are believing that they need to just go and move their whole church and it struck me because I have kind of jokingly mentioned that to you before that if we're gonna escape this world and just location mattered then there was at that time unfortunately it sold it was beautiful place I mean maybe we should have jumped on it saint upper end of the Bitterroot Valley last Ranch on the end of it thousands tens of thousands of Acres we could have just built our own little world up there until we start fighting with each other our only place of Escape is Jesus Christ we can pick up and move to Montana we can pick up and go here we can go there but the devil is still there and as long as we think we can escape then we'll still take our problems with us but when we find that our only place of Escape is our Lord Jesus Christ then we can run into him whether we're in the mountain in the city in the deserts or where if it might be my brother and sister we have our place of escape and the devil would try to anoint us to go I need to go here we need to go there we need to get away from people you're still there but when we can recognize that God is taking us and molding and forming us into what he desires to be so he can pour the fullness of who he is into us now we have that in potential my brother and sister but imagine now that we as humans Brothers shared this with me many years ago I just I'm sorry it struck me at the time as so hilarious but the brother he said on a Monday morning he's going to work and the traffic is bad and he is frustrated and he's getting closer to being late for work and oh my look at these people you know it's just and he looks over in the car and there was his kid's little console thing I mean his kid was little you know probably uh Sammy or declan's age and have this little console had a steering wheel it had a horn and it had a deal and then it had a button over here um that said machine gun and he literally finds himself in traffic with this in his lap and these cars and he's like bombs boom machine guns and he was like what am I doing what am I doing because the cars were still there the people were still there and he was still there he said it did give me a moment of satisfaction but you see it's no lasting relief amen our lasting relief my brother and sisters to realize this is just the rehearsal God's going to mold you and I and bring us to this place that when we walk out of laodicea we walk out of this world well let me put it to you this way this elect lady is not going to just accidentally end up being who she is not going to be an accident that brings you and I but it's going to be a conscious decision where we stand and say the word says I believe the word I'm going to testify the word in fact I'm going to speak the word out of my own mouth I believe this Lord and I believe there's deliverance and victory in everything I need in this word so Lord I'm a Believer but if you stand there and say I don't know I hope I might I'm trying my brother and sister you don't have what it takes we'll close that out with a scripture later you don't have what it takes what we got to do is stop and say Lord I am giving myself to you and let you mold me because the elect lady it says was found walking we jump right over it sometimes oh yeah she was in truth no she was found walking she wasn't sitting she wasn't crying she wasn't turning back she was walking she kept right on walking and the ingredient that she had that allowed her to continue to walk was truth amen without that truth she would have drifted into laodicea but she had truth and truth kept her on the right track truth kept her in the center of the road amen hallelujah so this great play is playing out in God's mind and it's being played out in your life did you realize he was a character in God's play amen now the director my brother and sister will drift into a little uh explanation of this in a minute but the director the coordinator he's the one who always says stop no no um don't walk in that way Walk This Way don't stand there stand here don't do do it like this until they believe that it is all just orchestrated perfectly now we look at our Christian Life like well praise the Lord God forgave me of my sin and uh he's filled me with the Holy Ghost can we say Amen to that and it is so then no my brother and sister God ordered your footsteps God ordered you to be where you are at amen God knew the days that you would stumble and fall God knew the days that you in desperation would cry out God knew the days that you would rise up and say I will finish this race God knew every one of those and he didn't come down and take that day out of your life because he thought it was too difficult you know what we do with our children young people hear me what we do with our children is there were certain aspects of our life that we didn't like every family will be a little different I didn't like it that I had to take the trash out and mow the lawn I didn't like it that as a 10 year old girl my parents expected me to wash the dishes and clean the table I didn't like that so what we do is we shelter our children from the things we didn't like and next thing you know you've got a bunch of kids I'm not talking about the world I'm talking about Believers children that are so sheltered and so so pampered because we don't want them to have to go through what we didn't like well maybe you wouldn't be who you are except for the time you went through things you didn't like so what you ought to do is say I made it by God's grace to be a believer and to be a reasonable sound responsible adult and if that formed me into that it ought to work for my children but instead we pamper in shelter well we grow up in a church and we become a pastor and the things we didn't like we try to shelter the church like repent and be baptized well if we just believe no if you believe you will repent it's that simple and if it worked Through the Ages for the saints of God it will work today we don't need to pamper this we don't need to do this young people hear me well when your mama makes it too easy on you you will regret it if the Lord tarries when you get older amen because you'll have habits of never make your bed and never hang your clothes up never do this amen and life is a lot easier I was a bachelor once amen it's a lot easier corn flakes for breakfast corn flakes for lunch corn flakes for supper amen and when your teeth fall fall out it must be someone else's fault it couldn't be my diet it couldn't be what I am and a worldly believer my brother and sister I left believer in there because that's how the devil wants to do it all of these I don't want to be too hard on my children I don't want my children to realize that if they don't have the Holy Ghost they're not going in a Rapture that's too hard so we're gonna soften this up and make it to where if we believe God sent a prophet it'll be okay but my brother and sister there'll come a day you'll regret it they'll regret it it's time to say child you're part of this household you're part of this family you hold up your end and in the end when your children are responsible and your grandchildren are responsible and if you live that long your great-grandchildren are responsible you won't look back and say I sure wished I had pampered them babies you'll be saying I want them to be rugged I want them to be real Believers I want them to realize they got to have the Holy Ghost I want them to realize that God's plan is the perfect plan my plan is not even on the table it's God's plan and Lord give us the strength to follow your plan Hallelujah now look here in Matthew 7 7 starting asking it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened in you I think we ought to teach on these things a little bit more amen you have young people uh maybe even starting young families and and the struggles of Life start coming amen you know it is when when you graduate from high school hallelujah sister Alice you just graduated from high school she's done an awesome whole list of credits and things that she already pressed into but I want to warn you sister Alex when you graduated for high school that was just the start of life it didn't start you know 17 18 20 years ago that's just the start of life because there comes a point everybody just looks at you like how are you going to support yourself and I want this who's going to pay for it and slowly your parents sister Alice it just happens it's heartbreaking slowly your parents just pulled back and you think man my mom my dad they're abandoning me no no no no no no no when that eagle flies out of the nest we've been around we have some big old Hawks that Nest right there at the house the instincts of a hawk and an eagle I'm just going to use them as a comparison the instinct is is the the parent flies over in our case flies over and lands on the pivot that's right there in the field and then hollers at the baby that's still up there in the tree now I'm making a lot of assumption because I don't know Hawk language but you can tell by what's happening they're calling them you can fly do it and pretty soon like sister Jerry calls me up one day well there's this young Hawk on the ground do you think it's hurt was after a great big storm big limb smashed right through their nest and it's like you think it's hurt she calls me back a couple minutes later and says no the other Hawk was out there sitting on the pivot and started calling to it and it did some hopping and bouncing and suddenly it remembered these are wings and God gave them to me to fly and they started flying and they're just there now we see them soaring they no longer hang in our tree they hang out in a tree a little farther up the draw because it's more isolated and you'll look up there and they're having a jubilee every time there's one of them little thermals you'll see them all out there just up and down and up and down but you know that this stage right now if you do the research mama will haul or come and that young Hawk says I'm a hawk I fly or I want to fly I eat what I want to eat I go where I want to go and God is allowing you and eyes to dress rehearsal we're learning to fly we're learning to make those decisions on our own we're learning to step out you say well brother Paul what's so deep about that no I'm not talking about whether you drive a blue car or a red car or a white car or what brand of car I'm not talking about what kind of shoes you wear or what kind of clothes you choose I'm talking about the very Foundation of deciding I am part of the Great I Am I am the son I am the daughter I am the manifestation of almighty God those are the Deep decisions what kind of job you have what kind of career you have oh we make such a big deal out of it uh you know doctors obviously make more money than than you know Common Labor uh but they also have a lot more responsibility and some people just can't handle the responsibility and so all of these decisions that's being made but God doesn't really you realize God don't care about your career God doesn't care about your 401k God doesn't care about the quality or the value of your clothes or the location of your home God does not care one single drop about that what he wants you to do is take care of the gift that he has given you and that gift is the very Gift of Life the Holy Ghost and he's calling you to that amen so he's telling here in the words in Matthew ask and it shall be given you what are you asking for amen seek and ye shall find and it shall be oh knock and it shall be open to you for everyone that asketh receiveth that's pretty straight up words my brother and sister but if you're going to come out here and you're going to ask for a Bentley you may never get it you're going to ask for a Porsche oh can I narrow this down some of you drive some pretty fancy cars amen I might offend somebody here in the church amen hallelujah well we just happened to drive old Chevys which some of you will tell me right to my face it means that we like to work on what we drive amen but I'm telling you those Fords are just found on the side the road dead is what they always said amen and all of those things again and we can banter this all back and forth but you think God cares whether you drive a Ford or not or a Chevy or not or a Mercedes or a BMW or not God does not care one drop and just so we're clear here in the church I don't either amen so if you're blessed enough to drive a really nice car God bless you but if you were driving a cheap car I would tell you what you could do with the money you didn't waste on that car that didn't go over very well so what are we asking for for everyone that asks us to receiveth I've never seen one one that sought the holy ghost that sought the presence of God in their life with sincerity and diligence that God didn't come on the scene and answer that prayer and fill them with the Holy Ghost I've never seen one that was seeking amen now we know that we as individuals don't seek God God seeks us but there is a depth that God allows for you and I to seek amen we can have superficial or we can ask and seek to have a deeper relationship and when we start seeking a deep relationship God is right there to give us a deep relationship amen and so as we would seek these things we find amen and when we knock it shall be opened amen oh what man is there of you whom if his son asked bread will give him a stone or if you ask a fish we'll give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which in heaven give good things and ask him I'm telling you I want more of Jesus Christ I want a deeper relationship I want to have something that will stand the test of time I don't want to become Paul Halen that Pastor that used to Pastor a church in Idaho but now he's been swept away I want to be standing here might have limbs broke off I might be scarred but I want to be found planted by the rivers of Living Water I want to be found having stood the test Hallelujah what do we ask for I say the only thing that we need to pray to God for you say brother Paul the only thing yes the only thing and the reason I say that is is if you ask for Christ he will give you himself and he said to you seek me first all the rest of this will be added to you amen you don't need to pray for these things you need to pray for the Holy Ghost for the outpouring of God that you can walk through the open door into his presence and you'll find you'll have everything you need to live life everything amen I'll leave that alone amen now what are the gifts we're asking for Christ are we not amen now what is the bride clothed in Christ the word so if the bride is clothed in Christ the word when we have Christ we have the covering of the word we've all seen the artist's rendition of the Bride amen and she's clothed entirely The Veil The Dress everything is the scripture amen have you seen that so as you see that the bride clothed in the word she's got Christ now I want to put this I've never been a bride I'm sorry just I can only speak from what I see but I don't believe there's ever a bride waits for a couple hours before her wedding and says I guess I ought to try on the dress puts us to Rachel on the spot sister Rachel did you try your dress on before your wedding now I know you girl imagine I hope I don't go over the limit here but here we are it's time to go to the wedding and we're like to a bridesmaid zip up my dress I'm trying come on suck it up I am it's still um call the same sir Scott to come make adjustments right now gotta let out this seem that or even maybe almost on the worst side I don't know worse try the dress on and this don't fit me I mean it's just sleeves are all baggy and it's the waist is down here no no every girl I ever met amen when she was getting married they stood in front of a mirror and they said this has got to be perfect come on Friends girls come on you're my girlfriends tell me how do I look tell me the truth you look gorgeous no tell me the truth and this bride of laodicea my brother and sister this is why I say this is just the dress rehearsal she is oh brother Paul you say she's just trying on the word yeah no I mean literally when I say this she is trying on the word because there's times that we put the word on and we don't feel good we don't think it's us it doesn't really seem to fit us and we do but you see God is causing you and I as we try on the word we're not only do you know the word is changing you and did you know that you are changing the word see now somebody's going to go well you're changing the word yes you're changing the word from something on a written page into flesh are you with me because as long as the word stays you know you sisters is so you know you can go down there to the fabric store I've watched my wife in younger years so all these pretty little dresses for my girls and and you know you can go down there and pull a pattern out and you can say oh this is going to be so beautiful on my daughter and you take the pattern home and you open the cabinet and you slide it in there and then you can tell everybody you want you have the most beautiful pattern but you've got to change the pattern into something that changes the girl and when we are changing the word from being on the page into something living now you say brother Paul we're not doing it but we have a part it's Christ in us that's doing the work but we have a part now come on rubber meets the road are y'all okay this morning when the rubber meets the road how many times you've heard in your life something preached and your first instinct is a pushback hmm none of you wow phenomenal so I'll just stand up and be the guinea pig there was many times through the years I pushed back I push back and you know what God did he just let me by the side of the road for a while until I got hungry and thirsty then he come back and said oh here's the word and at that point in my life it's like I need that that's who I am I got to claim that you see so this is not one-sided otherwise it wouldn't be free moral agency it would be God forced so when this is happening you have this young lady she's getting married amen she's not going to wait for the morning of her wedding to try on her dress but she's going to go there and I might be wrong here but I think some of you girls when you got married probably tried that dress on in secret did a little Twirl in the room like my look how I look this is beautiful I'm Gonna Knock his socks off when he walks and I come up that aisle he's just going to be standing over there I've witnessed this at wedding Saints I've been there before and watched the groom standing up there just laughs oh my nothing to be ashamed of why because he saw her in the absolute Purity and the beauty of a bride and God's not looking for a bride that's waiting for a marriage supper to be announced to run out try the dress on can zip it up or it's like a baggy potato sack and just oh I'm gonna do this no my brother sister God said I want a bride that when they hear the carriage coming they can step out and say I've been waiting for you I've been sowing at the Midnight Hour I've been trimming and tucking and doing everything that I would be of the beauty of the word that you called me with hallelujah amen what's she doing she is preparing herself amen and the word tells us that we should judge ourselves so there she is this bride is looking at how she's clothed and she is judging herself and you'll find that if we get too critical we'll never be happy serving God and if we're to Alaska days ago we will find ourselves saying well God doesn't care about that my brother's sister what God's looking for is a bride that's confident of who she is and what she was called for of the relationship that she has and that you won't have a bride coming up the aisle to get married and voicing to the people as she goes by I don't know if I should do this or not I mean I I don't know it's just the right guy is this the wrong I don't know what do you think well I mean uh just is he is he okay is this gonna work am I really a bride no sir you want a bride a young man wants to marry a girl that says I want to be your wife I want my life to have your name stamped on it Hallelujah that's why the whole world I hope this doesn't offend anybody this nonsense I'm going to marry you but keep my name that's the scripture being fulfilled my brother and sister if they don't want his name they don't really want to be his wife they might as well just say we have signed a certificate of agreeance I agree that I will cook your breakfast two times a week I will do my laundry you do your laundry you pay the mortgage I'll pay the car payment wow a few years you violated the contract but when you have I hope you take this in the spiritual a young woman that says good times Bad Times Hard Times Hard struggles and the beauty of life I want your name I want to be identified with you I want to be known as your wife amen what is she doing when she puts on that wedding garment and she's there and she's prepared herself in her beauty and presented herself what she's doing is saying I'm willing to give my very best to you and it's that that makes life and it comes I hope you're following me in the spiritual amen you see no one wants to show up my brother and sister at their own wedding with regret you know that's what the Rapture is my brother and sister it is that time face to face as it were the presentation of the Bride who wants to be one on that day with regret who wants to be the one saying you know what it's there now you think about this as I brought out to you earlier in a wedding natural type amen you remember what it's like there's always a sister God bless them that is there to tell you no you guys need to stand right here groom has got to be here got to be there got to be there nope that angle's too sharp nope that one's too shallow you got to do it like this and then you go nope you're walking too fast you need to stop here this is where you meet the the uh bride and her dad meets right here and and he needs to come down to her he needs to come down to the dad's level the dad not come up to his level oh did you guys ever think that there was that much drama no no bring that young man down to Dad's level don't make dad go up to him I've never thought of that in my life but a sister did and it's all got to be just right and then you hear it stop stop stop stop everybody go back out piano player start in like this start it again come on I've been to weddings where the rehearsals the wedding took like 15 minutes the rehearsal took four hours but you that isn't all that bad because that 15 minutes were beautiful they weren't chaos young men you know coming up to stand on the thing and you know you find them standing on the side over here no sir you stand right where that little dotted tape is and you stand there with your hands together and you pick a spot on that wall and look at it and don't move oh no I've been around a couple weddings but if you look at the word of God it's exactly what the word's telling us I want you to walk like this I want you to dress like this I want you to talk and live and all of these things God wasn't sloppy God didn't say just kind of do it however you want and if read my Bible and pray it'll just cover everything oh my brother and sister no especially when you go back in the Old Testament God was very specific go back in the book of the Leviticus will a Bible study tonight touch on those things God was so precise exactly what this will be just like this and then we come along to the New Testament and everybody says oh that was the Old Testament under the law we don't have to do none of that anymore and Jesus said no no no I didn't come to get rid of the law I come to live the law out by writing it on the tables of your heart didn't need to write it on his own heart he was the word but he wrote it on the tables of our hearts that we could live the word okay this present rate will just go right from this into Bible study amen now we'll just bounce real quick through this second Corinthians the fifth chapter verses one through nines talking about how uh Earthly house amen that we groan Desiring to be clothed upon which the house which is from heaven and that being clothed we won't be found naked amen so this is the wedding dress now I'm going to throw this out hey man just count this as a future reference but my brother and sister what is shame you know to see or witness a wedding in a message Church of a young lady showing up with the latest of marriage dress a wedding dress fashion in other words this young lady is walking up the aisle and there was a lot of oh and I don't know if the O's where they were shocked that she would show up in her own wedding dress that way or they thought she was beautiful in that dress but I can tell you the minister that married them never raised his head once during the wedding we can't dress ourselves in the fashion and expect our wedding to be something we're proud of oh might be at the moment but when you get a little older a little more maturity you're going to look back and say did I really get married in a strapless gown in front of 500 believers something to think about because you see there's a direct correlation in that spirit of presenting ourselves to Jesus Christ and here it's telling us that we would be clothed upon so that our nakedness would not show that we would not have that amen and so it's there as we'll come and look at this we want to come always confident verse 6 knowing that whilst we're at home in this body absent from the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight so God is trying to clothe you and I with the word that we can walk in confidence before him and let our faith be expressed not Walking On The Fringe not presenting ourselves as friends because my brother and sister the prophet of God speaks very clear and we have struggled sometimes with the things that he says but I say it's the truth amen and so here we are amen three kinds of believers we don't want to believe there's three kinds of believers we don't want to preach about three kinds of believers but there is it's not simple what we ought to do is be sincere before God clothed me Lord clothe me with your word I don't want to be I don't even want to be either one of those other two Believers I want to be a real believer clothe Me Lord and you can't put on too much clothes of the word you can't be overdressed you hear words like oh she's overdressed looks like a closed horse wow you mean she's too much of a Christian she's too much of a believer she desires too much of the Holy Ghost come on my brother and sister this is a rehearsal hmm let me move on quickly you see what the rehearsal is is when all the Kinks when the rehearsal is finished is when all the Kinks are worked out anybody feel like confessing this morning what some of our kinks are yeah imagine rolling a whiteboard out here South Africa with the youth I'm speaking to them the quote where the prophet of God says overcoming the devil is when you recognize all of his tricks and everything and we had that as a lesson with the young people and at first they were very resistant you know not too much speaking out but when the gate opened I'm up here riding on a whiteboard and you know I already told them you know just because they voice it out don't mean it's their issue but I'll tell you what it was still pretty funny when some kids like lost everybody's as though no one ever had lust hmm wow that's strange you mean you actually are that low that stoop down that low no I was like that's one who's confident of where they stand and not afraid to mention it that's one of the devil's tricks what's this we had a whole board full wrote out I had young people come up to me and say thank you for doing that because you see we tend to take these things now I was raised in a message Church message parents spent my whole life in the message I couldn't possibly have a lying spirit I couldn't possibly be tempted by cigarettes or alcohol or lust of the flesh and they hide it that's right and then you'll have a young man come to you and say thank you for bringing that out when that come out I said Lord I'm claiming my Deliverance my brother and sister this Bride As She dressed herself amen it's here in the rehearsal she's dressing herself and every time she applies the word and puts another layer of the word on it's sealing her against the spirit of laodicea it's not a burden to this bride it is her armor it is her protection she's putting on the word and Satan can't get through the word and it's coming that it's not your overdress no such thing for the bride of Christ to be overdressed with the word amen the world wants you just put on just as little as you can and claim the name of Christ but God called us to the rehearsal to be brought into this place and when The Kinks are worked out we get to go into Rapture Can someone say Lord hurry up and get the Kinks out of us amen everything being said in order now Revelations 3 5. amen he did overcometh amen now we're spanning Church ages here as we jump down a little further in scripture but he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white reignment it's not just talking about some she'll have a testimony or she'll have this she'll actually be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels He bit half an ear let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches and to the angel of the Church of Philadelphia right these sayings saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy works I know thy works it don't matter what the preacher thinks what they think that church over there thinks this evangelist thinks he knows that's right he knows our struggle he knows how many times we're willing figuratively to walk up and stand in the right place he knows how many times we're willing to say Lord forgive me he knows the desire of that heart that is anguished the very moment it makes a mistake he knows this amen oh Hallelujah I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an Open Door and no man can shut it for thou Hast little strength he was talking about me here might be to the Philadelphian Church age but he's talking to me has little strength come on my brother and sister I hope this doesn't just Mar my testimony before you but I'm not some big Powerhouse of a guy that just bulldozes his way through everything that Satan throws in front of him there's times I lay awake half of the night anguished over things and circumstances and I don't seem to find an answer and it says some Midnight Hour if you would cry out and I can cry out and it still doesn't seem like there's an answer but somewhere in the night you fall asleep and wake up in the morning and there has been a peace that settled over you amen there's been something that has changed the atmosphere is different and you would get up that day and say you know what okay Lord whatever it is I can endure it I can press through it I can survive I can move on Amen see the door the open door has been set before us amen and I'm here to tell you no man can shut it amen yeah little strength but you kept my word isn't that beautiful can we do a lot of things I might not travel the world evangelize the world but we can keep the word amen we can get up in the morning and resolve from our heart Lord today I want to keep your word Lord I don't care if the world notices anyone notices I am going to keep your word Hallelujah and has not denied my name now look 3 18 I counsel thee buy of me gold tried in the fire of the thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness you're once again being clothed this dress rehearsal for the bride she's coming now some people I've heard it preached oh that's the nakedness of laodicea and how people are everywhere with no clothes on well I might fit but I'll tell you what's much worse than that is a spiritual life it's not covered with one bit or very little of the word very little of God covering their life yeah water it down oh I don't want to distract them already too late too long Hallelujah are we okay just to finish a couple more we go back to Acts 14. speaking about the doors been open to the Gentiles Saints we're sitting here with an open door this word is no longer a book wrapped up this is a book revealed amen amen This Is The Life revealed and it needs to be revealed in US amen not just to a prophet not just to a message in general but Lord let the word let that be one of the things you ask for let the word Lord be revealed in me amen amen hallelujah now I want to just go to Revelations chapter 4 part 1. I thought this is ironic very ironic almost didn't use it because I thought some of you'd be like yeah you've already ran out brother Paul hope we don't run out of time too quick here now that we can get right into this and we want to see how that flows into the human being it's a beautiful story right here if we can just get to it all right yes the rock confession what Peter was he would build his church upon Peter's confession he said some that stand here shall not taste of death till they see the Son of God coming in his kingdom now remember he spoke some that was more than one wasn't it some would say many more than one but now look all of his disciples were standing there and he was asking each one of them what do you think about this and what do you think about that and but he said there's some of you standing here some standing here will not taste of death until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom oh my I believe that today my brother and sister I believe it enough I prayed for years for my mother as she got older that God would Grant to her to be one of those that was alive and remain but yet we always want to temper everything in our life Lord thy will be done amen you know was I really looking hoping just that my mother would be alive and remain maybe really what was in the depths of my heart was crying out Lord come quickly Lord come quickly and I still pray that I still desire that Lord come quickly amen what a statement two thousand years ago that was stated well it is God's word infallible every word that he says will come to pass now if we want turnover then 17th chapter of Matthew is the next when he taken a few days that only taken Peter James and John up into the mountain apart to be witness Peter James and John and they seen the kingdom of heaven coming hmm kingdom of God come in power I jumped down the line there sorry but that distracted you be witness seen the kingdom of God come in power that's right are you with me no God allowed them to see it coming to pass everything that Jesus had spoke could be summed up in that experience on the mountain there's way more to the gospel no my brother and sister it's all encapsulating when you see the kingdom of God come everything you and I need to make the Rapture brother Brown says it's already in you and when the kingdom of God comes down and rests upon you what does it do it releases that amen what was encapsulated in you is released and when that's released you will find that as I spoke to you earlier when you receive the Holy Ghost the rest of your life will come in Balance amen we can try to put our life in Balance all we want but without the Holy Ghost it will never stay there amen that is what anchors it in the soul of man is the Holy Ghost the spirit of God Amen so they seen the kingdom of God come in power they seen the coming of the kingdom of God rehearsed it was right there playing it out now my brother and sister everything that Jesus was speaking there was not entirely for our day nor was it entirely for that day but the word overlapped and covered all the same and it was there now I convoluted that didn't I part of it applied there part of it applies here all of it applied to the kingdom of God now look at this see the rehearsing of it was the coming of the Lord not the rapture the coming of the lord The Rapture didn't take place on the mountain but it's coming did and we have a coming because the word has been opened and Christ is in his word and when it was opened it has come to us amen so we are sitting here today the Most Blessed the the oh I I'm failing for word Saints amen we have just received so much because God said I'm going to come I'm not going to make great men be this and great men be that I'm going to come to you personally and open my word to you and when he opened the word to you something energized what was already in you and you can come and stand and you look at this see now the kingdom of God rehearsed they were brought into view of watching the kingdom of God be rehearsed as it come the issuing in of the Millennium they seen the rehearsal oh brother Branham doesn't stop it that they just seen him coming amen the presence of God to the mountain brother random says they saw it all the way to the millennium all my brother and sister I'm telling you the millennium's right next door amen and the word has been opened to you and I and the Millennium is real amen a thousand years of Peace amen a thousand years that Satan is bound and we are here today in our moments oh please bear with me in our moments we are here and I have seen it and I have seen it and I've seen times that I questioned it but I have seen the devil bound my brother and sister I have seen peace go to people who are Disturbed people that are broke up and and in their minds and in their spirit and I've seen the power of God come down and deliver them don't tell me the word is not alive and well today and more than able to deliver you and I from every circumstance amen what we got to do is realize this is not the end the end is what the word declared of us we are in the rehearsal and if God requires you to walk up that aisle again and stand on that little spot again one time two times three times four times it doesn't matter because God wants your life to line up with his plan and he's willing patiently to bring you through it until we stand right where he wants us to stand oh Hallelujah let me just close with this right here amen remember when brother Branham saw the vision of the Bride for years now I'm not speaking for you I'm speaking for Paul for years that Vision was incredible wow wow look look what's so kind of brother Brown to let him see oh my brother sister do you realize that was a vision of our rehearsal that was us and you say but that was the Rapture now this could be you know a little bit of disagreement on this that was the rapture I think it was the rehearsal the reason I believe is a rehearsal is because there were those that were out of step out of time out of place everything will be perfect in the rapture we're not just beyond the clouds we're just stepping off through the cumulus and suddenly God says you're you're good go ahead and go one moment it's like whoa nope go ahead and go no sir God's going to have declared you and I well it's not this flesh it's not going to be perfect it's what God declared of you and I they're perfect they're ready to go it's there but the prophet sees us now every nation in their own language own clothes own dress you can't tell me my brother and sister some of the preaching we have here in the United States is ineffective in other places oh did you guys not know that maybe we should take you with us when we go places even within a country from church to church you have to preach different some Churches not ours but churches like ours have complexes and sometimes that complex actually comes from the pastor and it comes right down in the church and you come there and you have to preach in a certain way because if you say certain things are maybe too aggressive the people are like why because they've been beaten by a previous Pastor or Ministry and every time somebody hmm mine's made of a little kid one time the dad was talking about his kid and how he believes in discipline but you know he doesn't strike his kid and his son comes walking up about the time hey Dad and the dad turns and the kid's like and then the dad is like no honestly I don't beat my kid so you have to deal with them amen sorry for wasting your time but it was a time when God anointed open a door for me to preach in a Thunder's Church in Chile I'm there I'm shocked the brothers Still doing my wife sitting in the audience going my goodness his spirit's got on my husband I mean it's not really that weird is it for the preacher to stand on the front row and preach to you most of you would consider that normal if brother Paul stood right here and preached to you my wife is like oh my God but you know it caught their attention because that's what they were used to that kind of stuff only while I was standing on the front row it was a metal chair actually it was interesting because it was a tile floor and as I'm preaching the cherish and God did a supernatural work not Paul God did in that church they come back out of the thunder so realize you can have a life without having a doctrine that doesn't line up life my brother and sister and we can be dressed in this word without having to become weird hmm yeah or do we want to be weird we won't even go there some of this can be weird without trying amen sister Ruth why don't you just come hey man Hallelujah look they seen the coming of the kingdom of God rehearsed and they were brought into view of watching the kingdom of God be rehearsed as it come the issuing in of the Millennium they seen the rehearsal and I'm telling you God chose to profit to show us the preview the amen the rehearsal of a bride coming and what is he showing us it might only be a few but we're a body right he didn't brother Branham in that Vision doesn't say all of you just keep on going and you out of Step go over there no sir he lets him just keep right on going with the admonition get back in line get back in Step get back into your correct position amen my brother and sister sorry I've taken so long this morning this is our rehearsal remember it's the rehearsal we don't give permission to just let the flesh make mistakes but remember this is the rehearsal and when we make a mistake it is not going to change the Rapture it will be that God will send us an order he will correct us he will bring us in the right place even if he has to take us right back and we have to go through some things all over again he says don't worry about it this is just the rehearsal and keep trying keep coming keep walking amen hallelujah Hallelujah you know Sister Ruth the priest service you were I don't know the titles the reason I'm bringing this out you started playing that song Amen when brother Isaac come out I keep listening for another sound let's just stand worship the Lord's Saints amen I I hope that I made sense this morning my mind has just been tearing around all over the place so many things amen that tie together to realize God allowed me aloud you to walk be ourselves and if we make a mistake he just corrects us because he loves us because he wants to have us amen that when the wedding is being filmed all of heaven will see this when the wedding is being filmed you're not going to see a bride fumbling bumbling along she's going to be walking in the word clothed in the word and she's going to have a marriage a wedding with no regrets not going to come that day and say I wished I had but she's going to be able to say thank you Lord for the covering of your word let's go to the chorus Brothers I'm going to need help
