[39:08] matter what the circumstance is that he
[39:11] has made us we often think about just
[39:15] spiritual things but he has made us more
[39:19] than able and Conquer of all things amen
[39:22] natural and spiritual and so we're just
[39:26] so happy to have that and brother Trevor
[39:29] sister Kerry feeling better Amanda is
[39:32] talking to Sister carry on the phone
[39:35] days ago and first of the week and um
[39:38] almost sounded like maybe Lazarus voice
[39:42] a voice had been raised from the dead
[39:44] and uh just she she just sounded so so
[39:48] rough but praise God she's here today
[39:52] and uh of course we're always happy to
[39:55] see our sister April amen and uh glad
[39:58] that the schedule's coming we're praying
[40:02] that the schedule just always falls in
[40:04] her favor uh you know that's what we we
[40:07] just desire and uh you know there's just
[40:12] our brother Justin him and his family
[40:14] his siblings and his mother was here
[40:17] last Sunday and just lift them up in
[40:20] prayer that um the schedule would start
[40:23] to fall in their favor Amen in this
[40:26] world we live in how Satan has come
[40:29] we'll tie that a little bit in today's
[40:31] thought Satan has turned this into a 24
[40:34] 7 world and he didn't do that for our
[40:36] convenience he did that to draw us away
[40:39] from the things of God and he's willing
[40:42] to turn a whole economy into what they
[40:45] call thriving 24 7 but it really was
[40:48] just a ploy of Satan to keep people out
[40:51] of the house of God to keep them from
[40:54] having the time to read their Bibles and
[40:57] to sit down and and interact with their
[40:59] family devotions Etc and uh but by God's
[41:03] grace amen do you believe we have God's
[41:05] favor amen so God's favor on us will be
[41:10] greater than anything Satan can ever use
[41:13] to pull us away and I say Amen to that
[41:17] amen and we want to today I know brother
[41:21] Adam will probably frown at me but amen
[41:25] many years ago he met this beautiful
[41:28] girl
[41:29] and he just couldn't help himself and
[41:31] today we're going to be talking about
[41:32] courtship and uh you know how many years
[41:37] [Music]
[41:39] 23 years
[41:41] amen thank you Lord for 23 years
[41:49] amen one beautiful daughter and two
[41:53] handsome Sons I say it's been a blessed
[41:55] time amen and uh sister Alice I know you
[41:59] have a lot of Grace you'll also forgive
[42:02] me amen but we want to draw attention
[42:04] once again our sister Alice and I
[42:06] apologize for not being there yesterday
[42:08] but
[42:10] um graduate of high school with more
[42:13] credits than I thought imaginable why
[42:17] you hadn't time to me high school took
[42:20] every moment just to get ABC and uh
[42:23] sister Alice has got all kinds of other
[42:26] certifications and things added on it I
[42:29] want to give praise not to Sister Alice
[42:31] but to the grace of our God today that
[42:34] he give her the fortitude the desire and
[42:39] ability to accomplish so much in such a
[42:42] short time amen God bless you Sister
[42:46] Alice I love you amen hallelujah
[42:50] thank you
[42:51] and uh Memorial Day why we are not a
[42:54] church filled full of many veterans but
[42:57] Memorial Day is certainly a day that we
[43:01] look to and realize that as a nation
[43:06] much sacrifice has been given for us to
[43:09] stand here with this freedom
[43:13] but I give even more in Memorial Day
[43:16] to those Sons and Daughters of God the
[43:19] Saints of the ages gone by that gave
[43:23] their lives
[43:25] for this gospel not only in the physical
[43:28] their blood being shed but they they
[43:31] walked and become uh vagrant she might
[43:34] say of the deserts and the byways to
[43:37] share the Gospel of Jesus Christ and we
[43:40] say thank you today Lord for the natural
[43:42] Veterans of of our nation and Nations I
[43:47] should say but definitely for those Sons
[43:49] and Daughters of God who have stood and
[43:52] proven and I just give this as a little
[43:55] Accolade or brother bobman sister Joanne
[43:57] I know their heart they would love to be
[44:00] here this morning but here my brother
[44:02] and sister is a paradox of life when we
[44:05] first get saved the struggle we have to
[44:08] fully surrender and trust God and we
[44:11] live through you might say the better
[44:13] parts of our years and then when we get
[44:15] old God brings us right back that we
[44:18] have to be in a position of trust again
[44:22] amen so if we think it's going to become
[44:25] easier my brother and sister well
[44:28] fortify yourself that no matter what is
[44:30] in your future you stand that test and I
[44:34] always just think of our brother Bob
[44:35] sister Joanne so faithful so full of
[44:38] Fire and Life amen God bless them today
[44:42] communion will be this next Sunday uh 5
[44:45] PM amen
[44:47] if we turn in our Bibles I want to speak
[44:50] to you once again thank you musicians
[44:53] thank you brother Alex I want to speak
[44:56] to you once again on things that are to
[44:58] be now we look at this my brother and
[45:00] sister in such a broad topic the things
[45:03] that has been promised in the word of
[45:05] God that is coming now you know I was
[45:08] just in my studies just looking at a
[45:10] couple little things you know and it's
[45:12] amazing the Paradox of it all now we
[45:15] know that the world has told us that we
[45:17] should judge ourselves lest we should be
[45:20] judged so if we'll take the time to
[45:22] judge ourselves by the word amen then we
[45:25] can stand with confidence and boldness
[45:28] in this day but we'll look over on this
[45:31] side over here there's a side that says
[45:33] don't judge me at all and there's a side
[45:37] that comes over here and says you know
[45:39] what it don't matter how you live you're
[45:42] all going to get judged and it's all
[45:43] going to be this way and it's all going
[45:45] to be that way but I tell you my brother
[45:47] mother and sister that I like the
[45:49] balance that has been given or brought
[45:51] to us and that is that we can stand in
[45:54] the word today doing our very best
[45:58] now those of us that
[46:01] are perfect and without mistakes should
[46:04] probably go home enjoy a little nap
[46:08] because there's none
[46:13] but we have boldness
[46:16] Can someone say I have boldness
[46:19] amen because we have the word amen and
[46:23] if God is judging how brother Brandon
[46:26] put it if God is judging by the word and
[46:28] the word is in us we have no problem
[46:32] amen so what we want to do is make sure
[46:35] this is in US
[46:38] amen because if this is not in us then
[46:41] we have problems
[46:43] but we should be at a place spiritually
[46:46] mature enough to realize that we are
[46:49] walking and talking living Epistles red
[46:53] of all men and God has never get this
[46:57] now God has never written a false
[47:00] epistle himself
[47:02] man has
[47:04] Satan house but God has not Lord let me
[47:08] be a written epistle Amen Let the word
[47:11] be written on the table of my heart that
[47:13] I can just live it out not to impress
[47:16] you not to impress them but just simply
[47:20] because we love the Lord amen let's turn
[47:23] in our Bibles once again to the elect
[47:25] lady second John 1. one through eight
[47:32] and I hope you don't mind because this
[47:34] will be a thought that is so strong with
[47:36] me
[47:37] that it's like job on the ash Heap we
[47:41] might be visiting this elect lady
[47:42] talking about her visiting with her
[47:45] getting some advice from her amen
[47:49] the word says
[47:51] the spirit and the bride say come so
[47:54] this elect lady's got a voice She's Not
[47:57] Just expected to be quiet and set in the
[47:59] corner but she actually has a voice
[48:02] amen
[48:04] the Elder unto the elect lady and her
[48:07] children
[48:08] whom I love in the truth and not I only
[48:10] but also all they that have known the
[48:13] truth Can someone say amen and thank you
[48:16] Lord
[48:16] for the true sake which dwelleth in us
[48:19] and shall be with us forever Grace be
[48:23] with you mercy and peace from God the
[48:26] father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:27] the son of the father in truth and love
[48:30] I Rejoice greatly that I found of thy
[48:34] children walking in truth now some
[48:37] people would be confused and believe
[48:39] it's the natural children and we'll
[48:41] claim them also but this is spiritual
[48:44] children right amen as it is in the time
[48:47] that God never changes his word but he
[48:50] has full authority to add or continue
[48:53] the explanation of the word so he
[48:57] doesn't have to he said let there be
[48:58] light he didn't have to you know make
[49:01] sure that included photosynthesis and
[49:04] vitamin D and all these other things
[49:06] that was all just added in as part of
[49:09] this so if we're walking in light my
[49:11] brother and sister the word of God will
[49:13] be bringing life to us we don't have to
[49:16] then go down the list saying and this
[49:18] and this and this and this you know you
[49:20] say well if you have the Holy Ghost or
[49:22] if you this or if you that no my brother
[49:24] and sister to the elect lady walking in
[49:26] light includes every drop of that amen
[49:30] so we don't have to have a great
[49:32] explanation and great big books and
[49:35] indexes and references and all of this
[49:37] to do it if we identify as being the
[49:41] elect lady everything promised to her
[49:44] connected to her an addendum to her is
[49:48] yours
[49:49] amen thank you Lord
[49:53] I founded thy children walking a truth
[49:55] as we have received a commandment from
[49:57] the father and now I beseech thee lady
[49:59] not as though I wrote a new commandment
[50:02] unto thee but not which we had from the
[50:04] beginning that we love one another
[50:07] hmm
[50:09] he didn't say it was about our Doctrine
[50:10] did he
[50:14] but the elect lady will have correct
[50:16] Doctrine
[50:20] and he didn't directly say it was about
[50:21] her spirit
[50:24] but she will have the right spirit
[50:28] but we love one another and this is love
[50:31] that we walk after his Commandments this
[50:33] is the Commandment that as you have
[50:35] heard in the from the beginning
[50:38] that she should walk in it for many
[50:40] deceivers are entered into the world who
[50:42] confess not that Jesus has come in the
[50:45] flesh this is a deceiver and an
[50:47] antichrist
[50:48] look to yourselves
[50:51] now you see if we are going to take this
[50:52] as a carnal message
[50:54] many people are saying well this is only
[50:57] about the prophet it's only about these
[50:59] preachers it's only about certain places
[51:01] have you know the revealed truth my
[51:05] brother and sister here it's telling us
[51:07] to look to ourselves
[51:09] in other words examine ourselves
[51:14] if someone far away doesn't think you're
[51:17] a Christian
[51:19] are you going to stop because of their
[51:21] opinion
[51:22] no there's only one opinion that matters
[51:25] and that is our Lord Jesus Christ
[51:29] um
[51:30] look to yourselves that we lose not
[51:32] those things which we have wrought but
[51:35] not which we but that we receive a full
[51:38] reward amen heavenly father just asks
[51:41] you lord to bless this time together
[51:42] with the Saints have joined together
[51:44] today May our licks of fire father turn
[51:47] into a bonfire today may it be a wild
[51:50] fire father not an emotion not in
[51:53] physical uh outpourings father but let
[51:56] our souls just be on fire burning for
[51:58] you today may we not walk out of the
[52:01] house of God today Father with a fear
[52:03] and anxiety a question mark but may we
[52:06] stand strong on the word knowing that
[52:08] you called us to walk in truth father so
[52:11] the answer for our lives lies in the
[52:14] truth we say thank you Lord and ask for
[52:16] your blessing today in the name of Jesus
[52:19] Christ amen you may be seated now as we
[52:23] look at verse 8 real quick this is just
[52:24] a little something I want to just throw
[52:26] in as a little example no I'm not
[52:28] throwing sister Jerry under the boss
[52:30] some of you might interpret it that way
[52:32] but you know um we drove Jolene and Alia
[52:36] to the airport and somewhere along the
[52:39] line sister Jerry says I don't know
[52:41] where my purse is at and so she's like
[52:44] it could be here it could be there uh it
[52:48] could be uh you know in jolene's car
[52:50] because she had driven it
[52:52] it might be and she zeroed in and
[52:55] finally she says I'm pretty sure I left
[52:56] it in the office and so when we got home
[53:00] from Boise we just drove over there and
[53:03] sure enough it's laying there by her
[53:05] workstation in the Farm office and my
[53:08] brother and sister it is and I bring
[53:10] that as an example because if we're not
[53:13] careful there's literal things in our
[53:15] lives that we have laid to the side that
[53:17] God does not desire for us to lay to the
[53:20] sign and over time days weeks months
[53:23] years we kind of have forgot about those
[53:26] things and you know it's interesting
[53:28] maybe you might be cleaning up some
[53:30] stuff you got a revelation that you're
[53:32] not supposed to be the hoarder and
[53:34] you're cleaning up stuff and and
[53:36] suddenly you find something and you're
[53:38] like wow so that's where that that's
[53:41] where that's been and you look at the
[53:43] stuff that's around it and realize you
[53:45] have missed it but not missed it for 10
[53:47] 12 15 years now those of you have moved
[53:51] amen we all only move down the block I
[53:53] should say sister Jerry Only moves us
[53:55] down the block she won't move us any
[53:57] further amen she doesn't do pianos she
[54:00] doesn't do refrigerators but she gets
[54:02] almost everything else now if you're not
[54:04] careful you'll put something in there
[54:06] and you know that you had that I hope
[54:09] you're following me you know that you
[54:11] had that but you really cannot identify
[54:14] where you left it
[54:16] and that is exactly what the devil is
[54:18] trying to do to the bride of Christ
[54:20] today that we lay things down they were
[54:23] important to us at one time but over
[54:26] time because we don't know where we left
[54:28] it and we're not entirely sure when we
[54:30] left it then it slowly fades in value to
[54:34] us and when it gets far enough away from
[54:36] us it becomes only a vague memory
[54:39] reminds me of an individual that I was
[54:41] dealing with in another country and they
[54:46] were talking about how that they had
[54:48] slipped away from serving the lord and
[54:50] that uh they they really down in their
[54:53] heart they really wanted to serve God
[54:55] but it had been so long and I literally
[54:58] asked him I said so how when you're
[55:00] talking about it's been so long how long
[55:02] has it been since you read your Bible oh
[55:05] something of the nature of four or five
[55:07] years
[55:09] how long has it been since you prayed an
[55:12] Earnest prayer before God may be
[55:14] something on the order of five or six
[55:17] years
[55:18] and their expression was I really want
[55:21] that relationship back I really want to
[55:24] do that and to me my brother and sister
[55:27] it's often easier to say than to do but
[55:30] I just told them if you want the
[55:32] relationship back if you want what you
[55:35] had at that time in your life then go
[55:38] find it and pick it back up but in the
[55:41] case of a prayer life or reading your
[55:43] Bible you don't have to go through the
[55:45] boxes and totes of your junk you can
[55:47] just stop and throw the other junk out
[55:50] and go back to it and that's what Satan
[55:53] tries to do he tries to get so much
[55:55] stuff into our life amen I have to say
[55:58] Amen to this I'm preaching to myself you
[56:01] just get so busy you get so much in your
[56:04] life now we forget what we laid down or
[56:07] where we laid it down or when we laid it
[56:09] down but that is not what God desires
[56:12] amen and now we're looking here as we
[56:15] look at this the scripture John is
[56:17] speaking to the elect lady and so it's
[56:20] there in this love affair that John
[56:23] actually had with the bride of Christ he
[56:26] has this love affair because he knows
[56:28] what the word is he knows what the word
[56:30] produces it does not go a generation and
[56:34] die the word reproduces itself it is not
[56:39] that we have children and because
[56:41] they're born in the message that they
[56:43] automatically are saved but my brother
[56:45] and sister this word that is the promise
[56:48] for our age will reproduce itself God
[56:52] does not have grandchildren but God has
[56:55] a word that brings life to every
[56:58] generation Can someone say Amen to that
[57:01] so we don't have to worry about where
[57:03] Christianity is going we see where it's
[57:06] going in the world around us it's fading
[57:08] away but that's because there's a key
[57:11] element that is missing and that is
[57:13] truth and so wherever truth is it Sparks
[57:17] a fire that brings hearts and souls with
[57:20] a desire to serve God Amen and you know
[57:23] we look at this that God is Desiring
[57:26] here uh in this word for us to recognize
[57:30] amen that we have received from him amen
[57:34] now it was not as it is some people have
[57:37] struggles with this but it is not that
[57:39] we received it from the preacher we
[57:41] didn't receive it from the prophet it
[57:43] comes from God himself amen and I say
[57:46] thank you Lord because there's times my
[57:48] brother and sister that men will fail us
[57:51] there's times that men's words they'll
[57:53] stumble over them and there's trouble
[57:55] but this reproduction as it were now my
[57:58] brother and sister there is something so
[58:00] unique that this word of God as it is
[58:03] this elect lady there's a relationship
[58:06] that is uh taking place now I hope you
[58:09] can follow me as I make this jump it's
[58:12] going to save you all sitting here for
[58:13] another hour if I make this jump now
[58:16] some men give roses
[58:19] and some men give chocolates
[58:22] and those are beautiful things sisters
[58:24] can you say Amen
[58:27] but God has given us truth
[58:31] do you want roses do you want chocolate
[58:33] or do you want the truth
[58:35] my brother and sister you see that's
[58:37] what sets this elect lady away from all
[58:40] the rest
[58:41] that is that they have a love for the
[58:44] truth amen amen many blessings can you
[58:47] interact with me today please have many
[58:50] blessings come our way in this natural
[58:52] life we have been blessed beyond measure
[58:55] amen but I would have to say today that
[58:58] the greatest gift that has been given to
[59:00] you and I is truth amen it is the
[59:05] greatest gift we might pass from this
[59:08] life with a disease in her body uh we
[59:11] might pass from this life as her brother
[59:13] Neil with his legs gone and and parts of
[59:16] his hands fingers gone past from this
[59:19] life but my brother and sister I know
[59:21] the brother personally and when he
[59:23] passes from this life he will pass from
[59:25] this life with truth
[59:27] amen legs hands all of that will not do
[59:32] nothing beyond the Divine but the truth
[59:34] is our passage into the presence of
[59:37] almighty God I plan on standing at that
[59:40] Throne I stand on plan on being there at
[59:43] the marriage supper of the Lamb there's
[59:45] nothing on this Earth that will get me
[59:47] there or get you there but truth
[59:50] and so that's why we as elect lady are
[59:53] reclaiming that this morning as elect
[59:55] lady we should be seeking pursuing
[59:59] Longing For Crying Out Lord I need truth
[1:00:03] whatever I must go mountains and valleys
[1:00:06] and deserts and whatever fountains as it
[1:00:09] were Lord I have to have truth
[1:00:12] because my desire my brother and sister
[1:00:15] if our desire is just to go to church
[1:00:17] there's a lot finer ones in the
[1:00:18] community
[1:00:23] we don't even have a baseball team
[1:00:26] we don't even have a gymnasium
[1:00:31] but if we want to make a rapture
[1:00:33] what are we going to do
[1:00:35] find truth
[1:00:37] we are going to hunt up truth and we are
[1:00:39] going to pursue truth with everything
[1:00:42] that is within us
[1:00:44] amen and you look at this my brother and
[1:00:47] sister all these others will pass away
[1:00:49] you know it's just uh beautiful you know
[1:00:52] you can have a rose you can put it in a
[1:00:54] vase uh you can even go down to the
[1:00:57] floral shop or wherever and buy certain
[1:00:59] additives to pour in the water that
[1:01:01] extend the life of the flower But
[1:01:03] ultimately when that flower was cut off
[1:01:06] its days were numbered but my brother
[1:01:09] and sister the word of God chose you and
[1:01:11] I that when we were planted in Jesus
[1:01:13] Christ Our days were no longer numbered
[1:01:17] amen our days are eternity our days are
[1:01:21] the days of Christ amen for we were with
[1:01:24] him before there ever was a world Amen
[1:01:27] and we will be with him when this world
[1:01:29] has been burnt over and restored as a
[1:01:33] kingdom for God and so it's there that
[1:01:35] we'll look at this in this fashion and
[1:01:37] as we believe these things we do don't
[1:01:39] we amen that we'll realize all the rest
[1:01:43] of this passes away
[1:01:45] amen the scripture says Heaven and Earth
[1:01:48] will pass away but the word
[1:01:52] praise the Lord the word will not pass
[1:01:55] away let me be anchored in the word Lord
[1:01:58] let me be anchored in that life that
[1:02:00] comes out of the word you know my
[1:02:02] brother and sister if you get close
[1:02:04] enough to this bloody lamb
[1:02:07] the blood gets on you
[1:02:10] if you don't get very close to it you'll
[1:02:12] say what is the blood where is the blood
[1:02:14] where's the effect of the blood you've
[1:02:16] got to get close to the lamb that was
[1:02:19] slain for the blood to get on you
[1:02:23] we want someone to come and carry the
[1:02:26] blood to us but my brother and sister
[1:02:28] that isn't what it was when they went
[1:02:31] into the tabernacle into the temple they
[1:02:34] had to stand there as the priest took
[1:02:37] the life of the turtle dove or of the
[1:02:39] lamb and the blood had to get on them it
[1:02:42] wasn't about I made a sacrifice what was
[1:02:46] the sacrifice well I wanted to do this
[1:02:49] but I didn't that's not a sacrifice
[1:02:53] let someone else carry that let somebody
[1:02:56] else get dirty with the business of God
[1:02:59] no I say let us be willing we got a
[1:03:02] blood that washes us from all sin
[1:03:04] cleanses Us in all circumstance even to
[1:03:07] the hymn of our garment don't be afraid
[1:03:09] to get dirty in God's business don't be
[1:03:13] afraid to get the blood on you don't be
[1:03:15] afraid to get everything that God has on
[1:03:18] you amen he's the washer of the Soul
[1:03:21] he's a cleanser of the flesh he's the
[1:03:24] one that gives a sound mind
[1:03:27] amen I might have the quote here I
[1:03:30] actually right now at this moment don't
[1:03:31] remember whether I included it or not
[1:03:33] it's quite lengthy did you guys bring a
[1:03:35] lunch
[1:03:38] okay
[1:03:39] I hope you're not too hungry when you
[1:03:41] leave
[1:03:44] you see the truth will never pass away
[1:03:47] now God having made the natural and the
[1:03:49] spiritual and parallel lines
[1:03:53] biblical courtship
[1:03:56] young people please listen
[1:03:58] for just a moment
[1:04:01] biblical courtship is not a form of
[1:04:05] entertainment
[1:04:08] she's cute
[1:04:10] I'll take her for ice cream
[1:04:13] oh turns out cute and cranky are all
[1:04:16] under the Seas
[1:04:19] done with her
[1:04:21] I'm going to go over here
[1:04:23] you know what this one's sweet but sweet
[1:04:26] and sulfur are also under the S's
[1:04:29] and sometimes sweetness Burns
[1:04:32] I'll just go over here
[1:04:35] I went through all the young ladies in
[1:04:37] our church I will we'll start checking
[1:04:39] them out over here at this church and
[1:04:41] that and and I want to go to youth camp
[1:04:43] so I can expand my list of young ladies
[1:04:48] no my brother and sister that's
[1:04:49] Entertainment
[1:04:51] the parallel that God has given between
[1:04:55] biblical courtship natural and spiritual
[1:04:59] is that we should enter into it
[1:05:01] seriously with an intent to build a
[1:05:05] lifelong relationship
[1:05:08] amen
[1:05:10] natural cording is turned into a sport
[1:05:12] Even in our message churches
[1:05:16] I wish to God some people would have
[1:05:18] courage enough to say young man not
[1:05:20] again
[1:05:21] you're not adding another girl to your
[1:05:23] list of girlfriends
[1:05:27] but you realize let's go to the
[1:05:29] spiritual side here
[1:05:31] so many people
[1:05:33] have taken this
[1:05:37] as entertainment
[1:05:40] they're heady they're high-minded
[1:05:42] they're lovers of pleasure and if we get
[1:05:45] this in our mind thinking because
[1:05:47] they're lovers of pleasure they're going
[1:05:49] to be out on a Sunday morning on the on
[1:05:51] their you know quad out in the mountains
[1:05:53] they're going to be in their boat at the
[1:05:55] lake they're going to be down at the
[1:05:56] cinema no my brother and sisters some
[1:05:58] people Anointed with that Spirit come
[1:06:00] into the house of God the scripture says
[1:06:03] to have their ears tickled
[1:06:05] it's become an entertainment to them oh
[1:06:09] weren't the song So Special wasn't this
[1:06:11] so nice did you see their new dress I
[1:06:15] actually have one in the closet I'm just
[1:06:16] afraid for the husband to see it oh and
[1:06:19] look at oh my brother and sister that
[1:06:21] they're being entertained in a religious
[1:06:24] way
[1:06:25] they're being entertained and it does
[1:06:28] something for them in their soul that
[1:06:30] they feel like everything is more or
[1:06:32] less okay
[1:06:37] but you see this should be
[1:06:39] a courtship
[1:06:41] of a lifelong relationship
[1:06:44] something that would stand the test of
[1:06:46] time something that would come and build
[1:06:49] it my brother and sisters the spiritual
[1:06:51] move
[1:06:53] I want to say today Lord help me to make
[1:06:55] everything that I do not be just
[1:06:57] convenient or make me feel good but let
[1:07:00] it be a spiritual move in my life I'm
[1:07:03] not moving down the ladder I'm moving up
[1:07:05] the ladder hey man I'm not moving away
[1:07:07] from Christ I'm moving into Christ
[1:07:11] amen because without that move my
[1:07:13] brother and sister this Satan will come
[1:07:15] and he come and he infiltrates this my
[1:07:19] brother and sister you can look at this
[1:07:21] and I'm just breezing over the top of
[1:07:23] this in one sense today but you see God
[1:07:25] is uh wooing the elect lady
[1:07:28] any of you been wooed lately
[1:07:31] Hallelujah
[1:07:32] the elect lady is being wooed by the
[1:07:35] Holy Ghost
[1:07:37] she is being pulled into the presence of
[1:07:40] God he speaks to her Midnight Hour he's
[1:07:44] whispering to her heart and soul in a
[1:07:46] moment of anxiety he's there to say it's
[1:07:49] all right sweetheart calm down I've got
[1:07:53] it all in control but I don't see the
[1:07:56] answer Lord don't worry about it I
[1:07:58] promise the answer is already on the way
[1:08:02] and then this little lady can settle
[1:08:04] down and say my husband is in control
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:12] oh reminds me of a story once
[1:08:17] this man was in a parking lot of a store
[1:08:19] and he's accosting and kind of
[1:08:21] semi-assaulting people
[1:08:23] and
[1:08:28] this man yells at her
[1:08:30] run run this man is crazy run
[1:08:34] but she saw her husband coming across
[1:08:37] the parking lot and she stood her ground
[1:08:39] she even stood boldly and said no
[1:08:42] problem my husband's got the answer and
[1:08:46] he's on the way and the man was just a
[1:08:48] few steps away and this man starts
[1:08:50] towards his wife and he takes and man
[1:08:53] handles him in such a fashion that when
[1:08:55] the police come they called an ambulance
[1:08:56] also my brother and sister the ambulance
[1:09:00] we're calling is not a natural ambulance
[1:09:02] it is God having pity on the devil being
[1:09:05] you say brother Paul he's having pity on
[1:09:07] the devil yes because God already
[1:09:10] the course of what Satan has to
[1:09:13] do before he is finished you say why
[1:09:17] does God keep the devil on life support
[1:09:19] because he's got to do some things
[1:09:21] before it's all over
[1:09:24] amen Heather wise the power that God has
[1:09:27] endude in you as Sons and Daughters of
[1:09:30] God you could literally bind Satan and
[1:09:33] him not be loosed except for the word
[1:09:35] says otherwise
[1:09:37] amen oh some of us look at that and we
[1:09:40] nod our heads like what are you talking
[1:09:41] about my brother and sister it's the
[1:09:43] word of God
[1:09:44] it's a word of God Amen whatever you
[1:09:47] bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:09:49] and if we did not have a word of God
[1:09:52] that gives Satan a leeway to finish his
[1:09:55] work then the bride of Christ would bind
[1:09:58] Satan and he would no longer be
[1:10:00] effective many of you's faith is little
[1:10:02] enough that you would say I don't
[1:10:04] believe what you're saying right now
[1:10:05] well I'm telling you don't doubt me go
[1:10:08] find what the word says and when you
[1:10:10] find that the word says that you
[1:10:12] actually have the ability to bind Satan
[1:10:15] in that form then maybe you'll catch the
[1:10:17] revelation of it but you know what the
[1:10:19] problem is now forgive me I'm speaking a
[1:10:21] little strong the problem is is we don't
[1:10:23] want the church to live any higher than
[1:10:26] our own personal revelation and faith in
[1:10:28] the word oh what are you talking about
[1:10:31] you can do this what about you'll God
[1:10:33] answer this what about you spoke this oh
[1:10:36] that can't be such don't bind me with
[1:10:40] your unbelief don't bind me with your
[1:10:43] lack of faith don't remind me of the
[1:10:46] revelation of the word of God that
[1:10:48] Revelation is a true Revelation instead
[1:10:51] of sitting there on the ground wondering
[1:10:53] what's going to happen and how did that
[1:10:55] eagle get on the post why don't you see
[1:10:58] if you're an eagle maybe you heard the
[1:11:01] same voice but you don't believe it
[1:11:05] stop and say Lord help me
[1:11:08] I heard that word Lord but I I I've
[1:11:11] never been on the post in my life I've
[1:11:13] never been on top of the fence I've
[1:11:15] never gone on the peak of the barn I've
[1:11:17] never looked in the heavenlies to soar
[1:11:20] well what are you doing
[1:11:23] what are you doing you're an eagle
[1:11:27] and I'll tell you what I hope this
[1:11:28] doesn't offend anybody
[1:11:31] but so many times Eagles
[1:11:34] are walking with chickens
[1:11:36] and they see a check and stop
[1:11:38] and focus
[1:11:40] Peck at something
[1:11:44] and the Eagles walking in chicken
[1:11:46] footsteps
[1:11:48] in a chicken fashion
[1:11:52] and he stops
[1:11:55] he's looking
[1:11:59] at
[1:12:06] what did this eat
[1:12:11] what's he feeding on
[1:12:16] I mean I'm a chicken just like he is
[1:12:19] but I can't feed on what he's fine
[1:12:21] because you know while I got better
[1:12:23] eyesight and then my great great great
[1:12:27] great great great great great great
[1:12:28] great
[1:12:29] relation in creation
[1:12:32] well that's about as close as the
[1:12:33] chicken gets to an eagle it's just a
[1:12:35] relation and creation
[1:12:36] both say they were created
[1:12:40] can't feed on that
[1:12:42] amen
[1:12:43] but you ever get
[1:12:46] an eagle
[1:12:48] and he sees some meat
[1:12:50] you imagine brother Brown's story about
[1:12:52] the eagle in the chicken yard
[1:12:55] now forgive me Saints I just flew way
[1:12:57] off the rails
[1:12:59] do you ever wonder if he didn't stop and
[1:13:01] look at some of his great relations and
[1:13:04] Creations and think
[1:13:06] what does he taste like
[1:13:13] eagles eat chickens
[1:13:17] huh
[1:13:18] I mean
[1:13:20] even down in the chicken you already had
[1:13:22] trials
[1:13:23] he has struggles he's like you know what
[1:13:26] I like to do I'd like to just
[1:13:28] anyway why am I thinking in the thoughts
[1:13:32] not supposed to be thinking about
[1:13:33] sinking my claws in I mean my yeah
[1:13:36] anyway
[1:13:37] talons
[1:13:38] yeah anyway excuse me I told you I was
[1:13:40] going off the rails
[1:13:46] you see God wooing this elect lady
[1:13:50] how many times as you read your Bible
[1:13:53] it's a word speaking of our love
[1:13:57] for the word
[1:14:00] over and over and over again the word of
[1:14:02] God speaking to us of the bride's love
[1:14:05] for the word
[1:14:08] amen my brother and sister if I wanted
[1:14:10] the voice of men you know they say if
[1:14:13] you want to be go to those who are
[1:14:16] so if you want to be rich you don't go
[1:14:18] down here someone living in poverty
[1:14:21] you want to be a good father a good
[1:14:23] husband you don't go to the one who
[1:14:26] hasn't seen his children and doesn't you
[1:14:28] know hasn't uh had a wife or maybe he's
[1:14:30] only third or fourth no you go to those
[1:14:33] who have been successful those who have
[1:14:36] done what you desire to be talking
[1:14:38] carnally and so you want to get rich you
[1:14:41] go take principles from a man who worked
[1:14:44] for it not somebody who happened to buy
[1:14:46] some little whatever you guys have
[1:14:48] Bitcoin forgive me but you didn't you
[1:14:50] know don't go do the guy all he's going
[1:14:52] to be able to do is say I I just went to
[1:14:54] the buy a Bitcoin and went click
[1:14:58] that's not how you build wealth my
[1:15:00] brother and sister because the day that
[1:15:01] that all crashes you crash with it
[1:15:05] amen and being religious you don't go to
[1:15:07] church and find the man who's religious
[1:15:09] and form your life after the man who's
[1:15:12] religious because when it all crashes
[1:15:14] you'll crash with it but you find those
[1:15:17] that have been through the fiery trials
[1:15:19] they've got scars and they maybe walk
[1:15:22] with a little hobble like Jacob would
[1:15:24] have had after his experience with God
[1:15:27] and those men that they oh you'll say
[1:15:30] but brother so and so you know he never
[1:15:32] gets upset
[1:15:34] well of course he never gets upset
[1:15:36] because he's confident in his wealth and
[1:15:38] himself
[1:15:40] but the man over here the devil is there
[1:15:42] saying you know what I'm going to make
[1:15:44] him look bad I'm going to make him look
[1:15:46] bad not just the world but I'm gonna
[1:15:47] make him look bad to himself and so
[1:15:49] you'll find a real Christian sometimes
[1:15:51] as a greater struggle you say but
[1:15:54] they're not even Christians they're not
[1:15:55] even believers they said the world
[1:15:56] should be falling apart no my brother
[1:15:58] and sister the devil already owns them
[1:16:01] he doesn't need to attack what he
[1:16:04] already owns he's pursuing what he knows
[1:16:08] he doesn't have
[1:16:09] amen and this elect lady has a love of
[1:16:13] the word you see God's not entertaining
[1:16:15] you and I
[1:16:16] amen we're not here but he's wooing us
[1:16:19] to a higher calling
[1:16:21] amen I don't want to be too bold or
[1:16:23] blunt or harsh this morning but I tell
[1:16:26] you if God is not wooing you today to a
[1:16:29] higher calling you need to stop find an
[1:16:31] altar get down and say Lord what is
[1:16:34] missing what is missing our calling is
[1:16:36] not at this level right here my brother
[1:16:38] and sister we have a higher calling
[1:16:41] we've been called in the presence of
[1:16:43] almighty God we've been called to be
[1:16:45] able to live to the very level of God
[1:16:48] Amen you say oh we're just mortal Flash
[1:16:51] no I have the very Spirit the word says
[1:16:55] you have the very Life of Christ in you
[1:16:57] and he does not have one life for
[1:17:00] himself and another life for you he has
[1:17:03] one life
[1:17:05] amen and that life is eternal life amen
[1:17:09] because you can't have another life and
[1:17:11] it produce eternal life unless it is the
[1:17:14] Life of Christ
[1:17:16] amen hallelujah
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:21] now look at this
[1:17:23] in an exposition of the seven Church
[1:17:25] ages and the resume of the ages now some
[1:17:28] people just believe things are just
[1:17:29] words my brother and sister I believe
[1:17:32] things are just words but when you come
[1:17:34] to the place by God's grace you can
[1:17:37] measure the value of words
[1:17:44] measure the value
[1:17:48] flattery
[1:17:50] on the scale
[1:17:53] is as
[1:17:55] a feather
[1:18:01] but a true and honest compliment
[1:18:05] is as gold
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:12] got a truckload of feathers you still
[1:18:13] don't have much
[1:18:17] or as my friend Jake Hofer says
[1:18:22] a thousand pound dog
[1:18:25] is a big dog
[1:18:28] what do you call Big
[1:18:31] what's great in your eyes might not be
[1:18:34] much in someone else's eyes
[1:18:37] but what I want is what is great in
[1:18:40] God's eyes
[1:18:42] because if we can get what is great in
[1:18:44] God's eyes we'll find that all of these
[1:18:47] other attributes and needs that we have
[1:18:49] in our life will all fall into place now
[1:18:52] I happen to believe in the Merit of
[1:18:54] these words brother Brown says here not
[1:18:56] for one moment do I bring a message
[1:18:58] to the people that they may follow me or
[1:19:00] join my church or start some fellowship
[1:19:02] or organization I've never done that and
[1:19:06] I will not do that now I have no
[1:19:08] interest in those things but I do have
[1:19:10] an interest in the things of God and
[1:19:12] people and if I can accomplish this one
[1:19:14] thing I will be satisfied that one thing
[1:19:16] is to see established a true spiritual
[1:19:20] relationship between God and men now I'm
[1:19:23] going to be real bold this morning and I
[1:19:24] hope this doesn't offend anybody but
[1:19:26] this been on my heart for quite a while
[1:19:28] amen but you look at this my brother and
[1:19:30] sister the world we're living in today
[1:19:32] they say well it's all about binding the
[1:19:34] people to William Branham now you're
[1:19:37] going to believe them or you're going to
[1:19:38] believe his words amen I'm telling you I
[1:19:42] can stand here as a minister and declare
[1:19:44] to you what I know of myself and of my
[1:19:48] own life and I shake before God to know
[1:19:51] that I could have a negative influence
[1:19:53] on a life I don't want that
[1:19:55] responsibility but I tell you what I do
[1:19:58] love is my screensaver in my office at
[1:20:01] home keeps revolving and when I was done
[1:20:04] with my sermon this morning the last of
[1:20:06] the notes all done the screensaver is
[1:20:09] rolling through this and here's a
[1:20:11] picture of a little girl in Chile and
[1:20:14] she was there and literally had told her
[1:20:17] parents you can force me to go to this
[1:20:19] camp but when I get back from this Camp
[1:20:22] you can't stop me from running away
[1:20:27] and the parents are all desperate
[1:20:29] there's they're shook up we get to the
[1:20:31] camp one of the ministers brings the
[1:20:33] parents and they say brother Paul can
[1:20:35] you do something I said absolutely we
[1:20:38] can do something a little Ray of Hope
[1:20:40] comes am I going to go out and do some
[1:20:42] special little dance am I going to spell
[1:20:44] go do some special little encouraging
[1:20:46] word no my brother and sister they're
[1:20:48] looking in anticipation we're gonna pray
[1:20:51] a sincere prayer before God that God
[1:20:55] will touch her heart because if you as
[1:20:57] parents and the pastor of your church
[1:21:00] can't touch her heart the pastor's her
[1:21:02] grandfather
[1:21:03] if you can't touch your heart there's no
[1:21:05] way I'm touching her heart but I'll tell
[1:21:07] you my brother and sister when that
[1:21:09] little time together that Youth Camp was
[1:21:12] over that little girl standing in the
[1:21:14] front of the church tears streaming down
[1:21:17] crying out to God Amen God heard dad's
[1:21:23] prayer now God heard Mom's prayer God
[1:21:26] heard Grandpa's prayer God heard the
[1:21:29] preacher's prayer but most of all he
[1:21:31] already knew the desire of that child
[1:21:34] and deep down in that tile was something
[1:21:37] that was crying out and Satan was giving
[1:21:39] one picture wooing wooing wooing don't
[1:21:44] you want to be like the rest and be
[1:21:46] honest with you I don't want to be like
[1:21:47] the rest
[1:21:48] amen I don't want to be like to rest my
[1:21:51] brother and sister
[1:21:56] I just had a reminder the other day
[1:21:58] sounds judgmental
[1:21:59] I secretly all through high school and
[1:22:02] even just a little after that I chewed
[1:22:04] tobacco
[1:22:09] a few days ago I run into a guy that I
[1:22:11] know
[1:22:14] his front teeth top and bottom all gone
[1:22:17] still
[1:22:19] chewing tobacco
[1:22:24] he got wooed
[1:22:28] he got wooed my brother and sister
[1:22:32] you know when you come to a place that
[1:22:33] people just think you're weird anyway
[1:22:35] you know there's benefits to people
[1:22:36] thinking you're weird
[1:22:38] yeah because then you get to speak
[1:22:40] because you're not going to change their
[1:22:41] mind
[1:22:44] I'm like are you still chewing that
[1:22:46] filthy stuff what are you going to do
[1:22:47] wait till it eat your jaw off
[1:22:49] matter of fact I doctor says I have a
[1:22:52] little lesion
[1:22:54] well good I ought to go introduce you to
[1:22:56] a gentleman I know that lives in the
[1:22:58] town of Caldwell that they cut from
[1:22:59] right here in his chin all the way back
[1:23:01] here on his Jawbone and they fitted some
[1:23:03] other little thing there so his face is
[1:23:05] all together
[1:23:09] but I'm so cool
[1:23:13] benwood
[1:23:17] but you don't understand Paul you're one
[1:23:18] of those religious freaks that's right
[1:23:21] that's right I'm one of those religious
[1:23:23] freaks because when I reach this stage
[1:23:26] in my life God come wooing and he come
[1:23:28] started to speak to me and I won't go
[1:23:31] into all that you've heard it through
[1:23:32] the sermons through the year but God's
[1:23:34] speaking and I started to realize
[1:23:36] somebody's in love with me
[1:23:38] somebody's in love with me I already had
[1:23:40] a natural wife I wasn't looking for
[1:23:41] another woman but there was somebody in
[1:23:43] love with me and they started to woo me
[1:23:45] and pull me out of where I was to a
[1:23:48] higher calling he didn't say I want to
[1:23:50] take you down and kill you with cancer I
[1:23:52] want to take you over here and give you
[1:23:54] this disease I don't take you over here
[1:23:56] and cause you to lose your mind no he
[1:23:59] said I want to take you up a little
[1:24:00] higher come up higher come up higher
[1:24:05] that's what God's doing today my brother
[1:24:07] and sister God's calling higher but what
[1:24:09] we got to do is realize oh this is a
[1:24:12] little bold forgive me as I said that's
[1:24:14] been on my heart for quite a while amen
[1:24:17] the one thing we got to realize is that
[1:24:19] the desire of the word of God in this
[1:24:22] hour not man's desire God's desire is to
[1:24:26] establish a true spiritual relationship
[1:24:29] it's not an attendance roster it's not
[1:24:32] even I don't know how I feel to throw
[1:24:34] this out it's not about the money I
[1:24:36] don't even have a clue who pays tithes
[1:24:38] or offerings in this church and I will
[1:24:40] remain that way because I want to be
[1:24:42] able to preach with this kind of Liberty
[1:24:45] of not worrying about what this is and
[1:24:47] what that is and how they're going to
[1:24:49] feel about it it is here and if God
[1:24:52] doesn't want this church to exist God
[1:24:54] will shut it down if God wants it to
[1:24:56] grow it'll grow amen there's no man in
[1:25:00] control
[1:25:00] amen no man let it be the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:04] control
[1:25:05] Hallelujah to establish that
[1:25:07] relationship between God and Men amen
[1:25:10] where men become New Creation creations
[1:25:14] in Christ filled with his Spirit live
[1:25:16] according to his word
[1:25:18] always blows me away when they say well
[1:25:20] you can't be saved unless you believe
[1:25:23] branham's religion
[1:25:27] well you guys will bear with me
[1:25:31] my Bible shows who authored all of these
[1:25:34] books
[1:25:43] I'm shocked
[1:25:48] not one of them says Brandon
[1:25:53] but I can't take you in the word
[1:25:55] where it said these men of old wrote
[1:25:57] these books
[1:25:58] under the anointing
[1:26:00] of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:05] hmm
[1:26:06] wooing
[1:26:08] what are we wooed to
[1:26:10] true spiritual relationship
[1:26:13] a wooing is taking place
[1:26:16] now
[1:26:18] amen
[1:26:19] I'm just going to go on I'm going to
[1:26:20] plow forward I just pray you forgive me
[1:26:23] have Grace for Paul
[1:26:24] the impersonation of in Christianity
[1:26:27] when the Holy Spirit not the new degree
[1:26:29] not the new church not the new thought
[1:26:31] not the new emotion not the new oil not
[1:26:33] the new dance not the new lips
[1:26:36] not the new tongue
[1:26:38] you know I'm sorry but
[1:26:42] the new lips isn't Max Factor
[1:26:48] hmm
[1:26:49] it's coming in
[1:26:52] let me just tell you this sometimes you
[1:26:55] just put your own foot in your own mouth
[1:26:57] and after the fact just have to believe
[1:26:58] God's in control
[1:27:00] he's preaching in a church
[1:27:02] hitting painted fingernails
[1:27:04] I hope none of them are here today
[1:27:06] I hope you left them somewhere else
[1:27:09] like
[1:27:10] at the store
[1:27:15] and I just hammer down on that and as
[1:27:18] I'm preaching there I look up
[1:27:21] here's a sister with her head down and
[1:27:23] her hand up
[1:27:24] and she had the reddest fingernails that
[1:27:26] were about this long
[1:27:28] and I'm like
[1:27:32] Lord forgive me
[1:27:34] I spoke to the pastor I said I didn't
[1:27:36] mean to say anything that would be
[1:27:37] offensive he goes if God told you to
[1:27:40] speak it he said I have confidence that
[1:27:41] God intended for her to hear it
[1:27:44] I hope you have that kind of attitude or
[1:27:46] or do we need to soften that down
[1:27:51] I cut a couple quotes out today that
[1:27:53] would have just been real Barn burners
[1:27:56] but I didn't want the fire department
[1:27:57] down here wondering what all the smoke
[1:27:59] was
[1:28:01] but you see my brother and sister we're
[1:28:02] not looking for the new not the new
[1:28:04] tongue not the new this not the new that
[1:28:07] not not the new hat and when God places
[1:28:10] his spirit in the middle of your new
[1:28:12] spirit then you don't have to act Meek
[1:28:14] you don't have to act like a Christian
[1:28:16] it controls everything that's within you
[1:28:18] it puts you decent it makes the church
[1:28:22] act orderly amen makes the gifts work
[1:28:26] perfectly and if you have to be taken
[1:28:29] from a place where you think you should
[1:28:31] be and put down somewhere else it
[1:28:33] controls you no flopping I'll never come
[1:28:35] back again no sir that shows that the
[1:28:38] mainspring is not in there and when you
[1:28:40] blow up at every little thing that
[1:28:42] happens poisons that disposition
[1:28:47] and when the pastor happens to hit
[1:28:49] something that's in the word and you
[1:28:51] well I don't believe that look out old
[1:28:55] Calhoun see watch out the new mainstream
[1:28:58] hasn't been said in their right but it
[1:29:00] controls it makes you believe it makes
[1:29:02] you act in such a way till you become
[1:29:05] salty in the whole world thirsts to be
[1:29:08] like you that's the Holy Spirit sitting
[1:29:10] in the middle of your spirit it's a
[1:29:13] mainspring and it's when the Yoke that
[1:29:15] you're yoked with oh I just hate to go
[1:29:17] to church tonight oh I don't and that
[1:29:20] preacher if he wasn't so long-winded see
[1:29:23] I'm in the message
[1:29:25] amen I'm identified here
[1:29:28] I'd like to hear him a few minutes but
[1:29:30] I'll tell you what last time I went when
[1:29:32] I went down to the card party Susie told
[1:29:34] me no you mean to tell me that very
[1:29:37] audacity that you belittled yourself to
[1:29:40] take your hair down
[1:29:42] my brother and sister these people
[1:29:44] don't even know their Bible
[1:29:48] excuse me forgive me Lord my clumsiness
[1:29:51] they don't know their Bible
[1:29:54] they think that it's humiliating
[1:29:57] to submit to the word of God
[1:30:00] now I've said it and I'll say it again
[1:30:02] today if we're a cult we are in the most
[1:30:05] mismanaged cult on Earth because I want
[1:30:07] to know the last time brother Paul
[1:30:09] showed up at your house and told you how
[1:30:11] to live your life how to raise your
[1:30:13] children how to spend your money
[1:30:15] how to do anything can anybody lift
[1:30:17] their hand
[1:30:18] amen if we're a cult We Are The
[1:30:21] mismanaged Cult of the world but when
[1:30:24] the Holy Ghost comes down and starts to
[1:30:26] deal with people's lives and there's
[1:30:29] something inside of them wooing them
[1:30:31] change change change Can someone say I
[1:30:36] identify with that amen I want to change
[1:30:39] why it's not the preacher it's not the
[1:30:42] message it's a holy ghost that's wooing
[1:30:45] us to a higher calling to throw the
[1:30:49] trash out
[1:30:51] oh Hallelujah
[1:30:54] had somebody
[1:30:55] yeah we won't even go there praise the
[1:30:58] Lord
[1:31:01] amen
[1:31:02] it's the mainspring and then that the
[1:31:04] Yoke that you yoke with oh I just hate
[1:31:06] to go to church tonight preacher if he
[1:31:08] wasn't so long-winded I like to hear him
[1:31:10] a few minutes see there's something in
[1:31:13] there desires that
[1:31:14] but there's an influence
[1:31:17] so they're now
[1:31:19] in the midst
[1:31:21] of two decisions or one decision two
[1:31:23] thoughts
[1:31:26] I want to hear the preacher
[1:31:30] but I place Susie
[1:31:34] equal in influence
[1:31:38] to the word of God
[1:31:40] you see I didn't say to the preacher
[1:31:43] because if the preacher is a real
[1:31:45] preacher he's not preaching preacher
[1:31:47] stuff he's preaching the word of God
[1:31:50] play Susie her opinion equal with the
[1:31:54] word
[1:31:55] my goodness but Chris been preaching on
[1:31:58] a fair balance
[1:32:00] amen
[1:32:01] God fought enough of that to put it in
[1:32:03] his word
[1:32:04] let's give God a fair balance of our own
[1:32:07] lives let's not take and say well this
[1:32:10] is how I see it who cares how you see it
[1:32:13] what does the word of God say because if
[1:32:16] you don't care what the word says then
[1:32:18] why do you even bother measuring
[1:32:21] why is there even a comparison if you
[1:32:24] won't live the word
[1:32:26] hmm am I too hard this morning
[1:32:28] amen
[1:32:30] so you look at this see
[1:32:32] you know the very audacity that you
[1:32:34] belittled yourself to take down your
[1:32:36] hair you mean to tell me that you're not
[1:32:38] going to wear those shorts anymore Lydia
[1:32:40] well you see the thing of it is if you
[1:32:43] just get a new spirit it'll just kill
[1:32:45] you that's right but when you've got his
[1:32:47] spirit
[1:32:48] it makes every emotion tick just right
[1:32:50] to the word of God it'll tick right with
[1:32:51] the word and you'll say well now Susie
[1:32:54] just a moment the Bible says it's an
[1:32:55] Abomination before him to do that and
[1:32:59] the love of Christ has come into my
[1:33:00] heart and I love him too much to do that
[1:33:03] see I love him
[1:33:05] look where the wooing is at want a
[1:33:08] spirit of rebellion
[1:33:10] one saying I love God too much
[1:33:12] I love him too much to go against his
[1:33:15] word to push against it and reject that
[1:33:18] I love him too much what is it my
[1:33:20] brother and sister reminds me true story
[1:33:21] here young man that he literally already
[1:33:24] popped the question but she said you
[1:33:26] know I want to do this correctly that
[1:33:28] you need to talk to my dad first and so
[1:33:31] the young man's like okay I'll talk to
[1:33:33] your dad first in the meantime while
[1:33:35] he's waiting for opportunity to talk to
[1:33:37] Dad she goes on a date with another
[1:33:39] young man
[1:33:43] then she asked him have you talked to my
[1:33:45] daddy yet
[1:33:46] he said no I haven't
[1:33:48] and I don't plan on talking to it
[1:33:52] she's like why
[1:33:54] because obviously
[1:33:57] you liked him well enough
[1:34:02] and obviously there was something in me
[1:34:04] you didn't like well enough
[1:34:09] true story
[1:34:11] that girl breaks my heart that girl
[1:34:13] ended up being a very wild child
[1:34:16] because all I had to do is well anyway
[1:34:21] ah we won't go there
[1:34:24] Hallelujah
[1:34:26] love him too much
[1:34:28] now look my brother and sister
[1:34:30] let's do some marriage counseling this
[1:34:32] morning anybody need marriage counseling
[1:34:34] not one of you do but Paul does
[1:34:37] amen and Jerry does
[1:34:39] amen so so at least we've got enough to
[1:34:42] hold the conversation for marriage
[1:34:44] counseling
[1:34:45] my brother and sister you realize that
[1:34:48] um we should be going to the marriage
[1:34:50] counselor every single day
[1:34:53] amen
[1:34:54] but you have to understand that Satan is
[1:34:58] in the relationship business also and uh
[1:35:01] so he he works in that same realm amen
[1:35:05] and you know we can read every marriage
[1:35:08] enrichment book we want to
[1:35:11] amen you can just you can just read them
[1:35:14] and read them and read them and read
[1:35:16] them and you can take those marriage
[1:35:19] enrichment books and you can craft
[1:35:23] a near perfect marriage any of you have
[1:35:26] a near perfect marriage
[1:35:28] amen I'm going to lift my hand because
[1:35:31] even though I sometimes am not healthy
[1:35:34] the prophet of God told me I should
[1:35:36] declare I'm Healed
[1:35:39] so I have a near perfect or a perfect
[1:35:42] marriage because I believe that's what
[1:35:44] God has given me
[1:35:46] so you can take all these marriage
[1:35:48] enrichment books
[1:35:51] and you can read them
[1:35:53] and then you can sit down and draw
[1:35:55] graphs and put charts on the walls and
[1:35:57] say now you know because we are honey a
[1:36:01] modern day family we're going to divide
[1:36:05] uh the deal so uh do you want to just do
[1:36:09] all the dishes by meal uh by day of the
[1:36:13] week
[1:36:13] um do you want me to put the cups in the
[1:36:15] silverware in the dishwasher and you
[1:36:17] will put the bowls and the plates how do
[1:36:20] you want to do this okay we agree we map
[1:36:23] this all out it's at breakfast time he
[1:36:27] sets the table on Monday and she cooks
[1:36:29] the eggs on Tuesday she sets the table
[1:36:32] and he cooks the eggs and we do all this
[1:36:35] and we map it all out and we have almost
[1:36:37] a perfect marriage
[1:36:40] in fact some marriage counselors will
[1:36:42] tell you even divide your finances
[1:36:44] unscriptural
[1:36:47] but divide your finances and then agree
[1:36:50] on who pays what so that you don't ever
[1:36:52] have any arguments over money well I
[1:36:55] tell you what my marriage counseling
[1:36:57] book that I like to read says it never
[1:36:59] was my money in the beginning it
[1:37:01] belonged to God in the beginning amen
[1:37:04] and he's just made us to be the handlers
[1:37:08] of it of good stewardship
[1:37:11] so we divide all of this out and you
[1:37:13] know what we have this this couple we're
[1:37:15] talking about the alter ego of Jerry and
[1:37:17] Paul and we have a near perfect marriage
[1:37:20] and everybody's like we are so so proud
[1:37:23] of you guys how you get along so well
[1:37:25] and then one day we walk away and people
[1:37:28] say what happened
[1:37:30] well I never really loved her
[1:37:33] she never really loved me
[1:37:35] but you had such a good marriage
[1:37:38] oh we just read these books
[1:37:40] and the books told us how
[1:37:43] but you take every marriage enrichment
[1:37:46] book and seminar and reading and and
[1:37:48] podcasts and whatever else of our modern
[1:37:50] day and you listen to those things if
[1:37:53] you need to work some things out and
[1:37:55] then you put love in the middle of that
[1:37:58] relationship and now you've got
[1:38:00] something my brother and sister and
[1:38:02] people are here if you don't believe so
[1:38:04] just go on to the Christian book
[1:38:07] whatever catalog thing that comes in the
[1:38:09] mail what is that thing called
[1:38:13] Christian book club whatever it is my it
[1:38:16] comes to our house every once in a while
[1:38:18] if you bought every book in there you'd
[1:38:20] need to get a second job delivering
[1:38:21] pizzas
[1:38:23] and will it produce what it says it'll
[1:38:26] produce
[1:38:28] no we have to have love
[1:38:30] you can read this every day of your life
[1:38:32] you can pray every day of your life but
[1:38:35] if there's not love in this relationship
[1:38:38] what is wooing you
[1:38:40] what is wooing you my brother and sister
[1:38:42] you know people say well we need to have
[1:38:44] a better understanding there's there's
[1:38:46] words in the Hebrew and words in the
[1:38:47] Greek I'm telling you my brother and
[1:38:49] sister it didn't say you go to the upper
[1:38:51] room and wait there until you can
[1:38:53] understand Hebrew and you can understand
[1:38:55] Greek and you can understand aramic it
[1:38:58] said you go to an upper room and you
[1:39:00] wait on the Holy Ghost and when the Holy
[1:39:02] Ghost comes you will understand all
[1:39:05] things
[1:39:06] oh my brother and sister he didn't say
[1:39:09] Young when you get a PhD preach the
[1:39:11] gospel it's told us to go and when we're
[1:39:14] endued with power from on high amen
[1:39:17] hallelujah so you read these books it
[1:39:20] does good but it sure helps when you're
[1:39:22] in love amen now Satan's in the
[1:39:24] relationship business also Amen in fact
[1:39:27] he's a bestseller
[1:39:29] he's got so much to say about it I'm not
[1:39:32] kidding
[1:39:33] the devil's got so much to say about it
[1:39:35] he's got all kinds of influence in the
[1:39:38] realm of how men and women should
[1:39:41] interact and relate my brother and
[1:39:43] sister I'm going to step away from the
[1:39:45] family and step into the spiritual world
[1:39:47] if you take something that God designed
[1:39:50] to run so close parallel with each other
[1:39:52] and you separated just into the natural
[1:39:56] side amen and you take that what you're
[1:39:59] going to end up with is an unbalanced
[1:40:02] marriage or relationship now you take
[1:40:05] that over into the spiritual side my
[1:40:07] brother and sister and you'll end up
[1:40:09] with a dominating female Spirit you only
[1:40:11] when people say what you're picking on
[1:40:13] the sisters no that's a spirit it gets
[1:40:15] on anyone that wants to get on or can
[1:40:17] get on and so what happens is God when
[1:40:20] he built this relationship built this
[1:40:22] relationship with balance in mind amen
[1:40:24] hallelujah and you look at this see now
[1:40:27] look at this what's happening now I
[1:40:30] don't want to embarrass anybody but um
[1:40:32] uh uh sister
[1:40:35] I don't know should I throw you under
[1:40:36] the bus
[1:40:39] oh I yeah more sisters farther back
[1:40:42] sorry sister Kerry but
[1:40:45] no Sister Sister April sent something
[1:40:48] she's been reading studying
[1:40:51] and I was like she's also been reading
[1:40:53] my notes
[1:40:54] I thought they looked Disturbed on my
[1:40:56] desk
[1:40:57] of course the way I do my notes you'd
[1:40:59] have a hard time Discerning what was a
[1:41:01] note and what was scrap paper
[1:41:03] but
[1:41:04] look at this sister April I I was going
[1:41:07] to bring it out and read the quote but I
[1:41:08] didn't
[1:41:09] amen
[1:41:11] now she
[1:41:13] oh let's stop for a second I skipped
[1:41:15] over a very key ingredient
[1:41:17] did you know there's another elect lady
[1:41:22] go in your Bible
[1:41:25] it's not hard to find her
[1:41:29] she wears Scarlet
[1:41:32] she has all kinds of faithful followers
[1:41:37] and her voice is considered the voice of
[1:41:40] authority
[1:41:41] and she's got children
[1:41:45] and she's meaner than a junkyard dog
[1:41:49] and your soul is worth nothing to her
[1:41:55] but she's wooing
[1:41:59] a little bit of research will show you
[1:42:02] Born Again Baptists
[1:42:05] studying to prove Catholicism wrong
[1:42:08] and becoming staunch supporters and
[1:42:11] missionaries for the Catholic Church
[1:42:16] fundamentalists
[1:42:18] rejecting
[1:42:20] the word of God
[1:42:22] what is it is it what they read on the
[1:42:25] page
[1:42:27] no it was a spirit they were anointed by
[1:42:31] so when they get anointed by that spirit
[1:42:32] because you see as I started the service
[1:42:34] this scripture those things got to be
[1:42:36] fulfilled
[1:42:37] they've got to come to fruition
[1:42:40] and so it is now this is talking
[1:42:44] about her
[1:42:47] the other elect lady
[1:42:52] now she is making love to her daughters
[1:42:55] wooing them right back home again with
[1:42:58] no spiritual understanding stripped it's
[1:43:01] an oasis for her they say oh what a
[1:43:03] grand thing it is oh my and Pentecostal
[1:43:06] men sitting in the council at Rome and
[1:43:09] sending letters around it was the most
[1:43:12] spiritual time they had ever seen
[1:43:15] How could a born-again man cut off his
[1:43:18] secret cut off the word and they live by
[1:43:21] the Creed that's exactly what Delilah
[1:43:24] has done today cutting off the word and
[1:43:26] you live by the Creed now I believe it's
[1:43:28] a year 2000 it was shared with us we
[1:43:31] could not find the video or I would have
[1:43:33] played it for you this morning but it
[1:43:35] was some Pentecostal preachers taking a
[1:43:37] visit to the Vatican having a personal
[1:43:39] audience with the Pope and when they
[1:43:42] come out of this personal audience they
[1:43:44] kissed the ring
[1:43:49] now if you're going to kiss at Robin
[1:43:50] Hood Style
[1:43:53] where you get outside the building and
[1:43:54] say
[1:43:57] look what I've got
[1:43:59] I might forgive you
[1:44:02] but my brother and sister they kissed
[1:44:04] the ring they come out of this and
[1:44:06] reporters are saying what was your
[1:44:08] experience and one of these uh
[1:44:11] Pentecostal preachers does just a little
[1:44:14] bit of a jig and he turns around speaks
[1:44:17] to the camera we're coming back to Mama
[1:44:24] look what's happening my brother and
[1:44:26] sister the word of God will come to pass
[1:44:28] and now we're seeing and I'll just give
[1:44:31] you a hint of what's what sister April
[1:44:33] shared and what it was it's there the
[1:44:36] prophet of God talking about how that
[1:44:38] they will band together with one common
[1:44:41] cause not religious they're not coming
[1:44:43] to say we're all on the same page so
[1:44:45] we're going to throw our hat in the ring
[1:44:47] they're coming because they're going to
[1:44:49] fight communism by coming in an
[1:44:52] ecumenical council and joining together
[1:44:55] to fight communism and my brother and
[1:44:57] sister if that is not what is happening
[1:45:00] today you have got everything from the
[1:45:02] church of England and all of this other
[1:45:05] religions all supporting the war it must
[1:45:09] take place this must happen we've got to
[1:45:12] fight against this evil and they don't
[1:45:15] recognize even the very Bible they claim
[1:45:17] to believe has declared that they are
[1:45:20] not fighting against flesh and blood but
[1:45:23] they are fighting against spiritual
[1:45:25] warfare principalities and Powers my
[1:45:28] brother and sister and it all sounds
[1:45:30] good we need to do this we need to stop
[1:45:32] this uh indecent uh treatment on moral
[1:45:35] treatment ungodly treatments but they
[1:45:39] don't realize the very one that they are
[1:45:41] stepping into being wooed
[1:45:43] being rude is the one that is
[1:45:46] responsible for killing Millions Through
[1:45:49] the Ages
[1:45:51] they are giving themselves to the
[1:45:53] greatest mass murderer that's ever been
[1:45:56] on the face of the Earth believing their
[1:45:59] doing goddess service
[1:46:02] it's stunning
[1:46:04] it is the most spiritual time they had
[1:46:06] ever seen they hadn't seen much I'm
[1:46:08] telling you how could a born-again man
[1:46:10] cut off his secret cut off the word
[1:46:12] and then live by Creed but it's
[1:46:15] happening my brother and sister your
[1:46:16] computer if you want to study it is
[1:46:18] clear full of it
[1:46:19] clear full of it amen
[1:46:22] now as we look into the Ephesians
[1:46:26] we realize that one of the things that
[1:46:28] God had against the Ephesian Church ate
[1:46:30] was the fact that they had left their
[1:46:32] first love
[1:46:34] now so it's pretty strong accusation my
[1:46:36] brother and sister if we saw that in the
[1:46:38] natural we saw that you know a husband
[1:46:41] and wife married for a while one or the
[1:46:43] other of them just decide you know what
[1:46:45] I don't need you this is more attractive
[1:46:47] over here we would look and and we would
[1:46:50] just be shocked but you'll see in the
[1:46:52] spiritual realm that people come and
[1:46:55] they come to a moment that they feel
[1:46:57] like I cannot bear with this any longer
[1:46:59] I see a flaw here I see a flaw here I
[1:47:02] see a flaw there and look at this now my
[1:47:05] brother and sister I want you to find me
[1:47:07] something flawless
[1:47:12] we'll dismiss church and we'll reconvene
[1:47:14] about seven o'clock tonight and I want
[1:47:16] somebody to bring us something that's
[1:47:18] flawless
[1:47:24] the only thing we could do would be to
[1:47:27] bring the word of God
[1:47:31] There's No Object no car plane train
[1:47:34] book clothes
[1:47:37] tool
[1:47:38] flawless
[1:47:42] so we come to a place we decide you
[1:47:45] realize it's only a matter of Step or
[1:47:46] two
[1:47:50] we won't go into it much but it's in
[1:47:52] scripture Malik
[1:47:56] you tell me how
[1:47:57] started off
[1:47:59] we want to please you Lord
[1:48:01] offering sacrifices pretty soon somebody
[1:48:04] said I gotta offer a greater sacrifice
[1:48:07] what can I offer that's greater than
[1:48:09] what I have offered and they would look
[1:48:11] around and maybe one of their little
[1:48:13] children's would Scamper by and say
[1:48:15] that's the highest level
[1:48:17] of something that I love and attached to
[1:48:19] and they said I'm going to do this for
[1:48:22] Satan
[1:48:22] no sir
[1:48:25] no they said I'm doing this for God
[1:48:29] and they started to offer their children
[1:48:33] and they sacrificed their children
[1:48:35] believing they were doing God
[1:48:38] service
[1:48:40] now I want you to jump to the year 2023.
[1:48:44] and Christians
[1:48:47] still sacrificing
[1:48:50] their children
[1:48:54] huh am I speaking too straight
[1:48:58] okay
[1:48:59] How do they
[1:49:01] how do they do that
[1:49:04] how do they do that
[1:49:07] they were rude have you guys seen the
[1:49:10] news coming out of Kenya
[1:49:13] I hope you don't don't go look it up
[1:49:16] it's horrific
[1:49:19] you want to know what a cult is you go
[1:49:21] study Kenya
[1:49:23] you guys will be doing God a favor doing
[1:49:26] God a blessing doing service to God
[1:49:29] starve yourself to death starve your
[1:49:31] children first to make sure they're gone
[1:49:33] then starve yourself to death this is
[1:49:36] serving God
[1:49:37] no I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:49:39] Saints you want to do God to service a
[1:49:41] greater service live all that is within
[1:49:44] you keep this old vessel healthy and
[1:49:47] live it for Jesus Christ Proclaim his
[1:49:50] name his voice his word from the
[1:49:53] rooftops children God is real neighbor
[1:49:56] God is real amen and woo them with your
[1:50:00] life amen don't just tell him about
[1:50:03] Jesus Christ let your life woo your
[1:50:06] neighbor let your life woo your family
[1:50:09] let it woo your children
[1:50:14] oh but what's happening my brother and
[1:50:17] sister just as it was in the Ephesian
[1:50:19] age they slowly got wooed away from
[1:50:22] their first love they were on fire
[1:50:24] Saints don't get an idea they were just
[1:50:26] a bunch of hillbilliesha you know
[1:50:28] uneducated whatever these were people
[1:50:30] that were on fire for God and they
[1:50:33] slowly got rude away they slowly got
[1:50:36] caught up and you might say the cares of
[1:50:39] Life hemlines come up blouses went down
[1:50:42] things that we wouldn't do we do now all
[1:50:45] of this is a slow wooing
[1:50:48] wooing
[1:50:53] I'm just gonna let all the stops out
[1:50:55] y'all might really consider
[1:50:59] anyway
[1:51:01] man I grew up with
[1:51:03] I considered him a good friend
[1:51:09] Pastor to church there was a young lady
[1:51:11] in that church
[1:51:12] and marriage issues ultimately ended up
[1:51:14] being divorced
[1:51:17] when my friend whose name happened to be
[1:51:19] Paul also
[1:51:20] his wife passes away
[1:51:23] he renews a friendship with this young
[1:51:25] lady she's divorced
[1:51:28] now you say oh these things how can it
[1:51:31] be I'll tell you how it can be
[1:51:33] we watched a denomination that did not
[1:51:36] believe in divorced preachers
[1:51:39] change their whole religion and rules
[1:51:43] because of him being such a dynamic
[1:51:47] speaker
[1:51:48] and we don't want to lose him
[1:51:54] overnight
[1:51:57] overnight
[1:51:59] Church went from we're standing on the
[1:52:01] word
[1:52:02] two were standing on
[1:52:05] most of the word
[1:52:11] who would who
[1:52:15] one preacher said well
[1:52:17] he'll be able to relate to all of these
[1:52:20] families
[1:52:22] relate what to them
[1:52:24] I'll tell you what you relate
[1:52:27] the church will change the rules for you
[1:52:32] but I want the rules to be changed for
[1:52:34] me I want to conform to the rule as it
[1:52:36] were if you want to call them rules I
[1:52:38] don't even consider them rules
[1:52:40] amen I want to change to meet God's word
[1:52:43] I don't want the word to change to me me
[1:52:45] amen I want to be wooed to a higher
[1:52:48] calling amen now look you guys went
[1:52:51] hiking amen I know that I know that
[1:52:54] brother Alex and some of the family they
[1:52:56] went hiking and and they were just
[1:52:58] sharing our sister was sharing how that
[1:53:00] it was it was just tiring climbing up
[1:53:03] the hills and did you know
[1:53:05] that um I'd rather go uphill than down
[1:53:07] though
[1:53:11] absolutely see God even when it comes to
[1:53:14] hiking amen
[1:53:19] what is that we're talking about that
[1:53:22] over over Landing
[1:53:24] yes
[1:53:26] over Landing you know that's where you
[1:53:28] take and you you take a vehicle or
[1:53:30] whatever and you go and you find places
[1:53:31] you hike you climb you travel climb
[1:53:34] through the mud through this through
[1:53:35] that all this stuff that's great
[1:53:37] but even in all of that God put the
[1:53:39] principle and anchored it that it's
[1:53:42] easier to go uphill than downhill
[1:53:45] and if you don't think so
[1:53:47] I will climb from the bottom to the top
[1:53:51] and you get to go to the Top by vehicle
[1:53:53] and come to the bottom
[1:53:55] and then the next day or two we'll find
[1:53:58] out whose body hurts the most
[1:54:01] you're not going to believe the fact
[1:54:02] that going downhill
[1:54:04] causes greater pain in your body than
[1:54:06] going uphill
[1:54:08] you have a pain in your lungs and an
[1:54:10] ache in your muscles on the way up
[1:54:13] but you stretch and you strain am I
[1:54:15] right Sister Sarah you end up with sore
[1:54:18] toes your heels hurt your ankles feel
[1:54:20] flexed
[1:54:22] maybe I'm different
[1:54:24] sister Sarah's like he's a wimp
[1:54:34] yeah going uphill you know your heel
[1:54:37] supported in a correct shoe
[1:54:40] and everything's in its right place and
[1:54:41] you climb but
[1:54:42] you know going downhill
[1:54:45] you're just practicing to become a
[1:54:47] ballerina
[1:54:49] everything's just out of its place if
[1:54:51] you don't think so just come up here and
[1:54:53] stand with me for a little bit we'll see
[1:54:57] how long it is before you're not
[1:54:59] comfortable
[1:55:02] you see it always
[1:55:04] is the principle that we think that we
[1:55:06] take the easiest route
[1:55:08] but God literally put within us an
[1:55:11] ability to recover
[1:55:13] from the hard trials from the fiery
[1:55:16] trials anybody know what time it is
[1:55:20] oh my
[1:55:22] oh my
[1:55:24] well maybe we'll take a break and you
[1:55:26] have some coffee and donuts and then
[1:55:27] we'll come back and finish
[1:55:32] but you see Revelations 2 4 says you
[1:55:34] know nevertheless I have somewhat
[1:55:36] against thee because thou has left thy
[1:55:38] first love
[1:55:39] there was something in there that they
[1:55:41] could not stick they weren't able to
[1:55:43] abide what was it it wasn't they were
[1:55:46] necessarily rejecting the word but
[1:55:48] somebody presented them a wooing that
[1:55:51] seemed to make more sense and it was
[1:55:53] there that they were attracted to that
[1:55:55] and wouldn't it be nice Saints if we
[1:55:57] could just live any way we wanted and
[1:55:58] still say we were message believers
[1:56:03] it would until you crashed and burned
[1:56:06] you know
[1:56:08] um
[1:56:09] I'm gonna I'm gonna skip ahead here
[1:56:12] once again I want to drive home to you
[1:56:17] God has no grandchildren
[1:56:20] you either have an on fire
[1:56:23] holy ghost-filled relationship with God
[1:56:26] or you're just another human
[1:56:29] on Earth
[1:56:31] hmm
[1:56:32] that's not very polite brother Paul
[1:56:35] and no we don't pass it on with natural
[1:56:38] birth
[1:56:39] and we can't pass it on with Apostolic
[1:56:42] succession
[1:56:44] it's got to be something that's called
[1:56:46] of God gifts given of God can someone
[1:56:50] raise a hand and say thank you Lord
[1:56:52] amen it didn't come because I was born
[1:56:54] in the family and my family are
[1:56:56] Christians and no no God chose you God
[1:56:58] called you God said you're one that I
[1:57:01] have predestinated from the foundation
[1:57:03] of the world and I have poured out
[1:57:05] Heaven and Earth for you
[1:57:08] oh my that's a pretty big investment my
[1:57:10] brother and sister
[1:57:11] amen now look at this here I just want
[1:57:14] to read this short deal the fervent
[1:57:15] desire to please God the passion to know
[1:57:19] his word The Cry of reaching out in the
[1:57:21] spirit all begins to fade and instead of
[1:57:25] that church being on fire with the fire
[1:57:27] of God it's cooled off and become a bit
[1:57:30] formal that is what happened there to
[1:57:33] the Ephesians they were getting a bit
[1:57:35] formal the abandonment to God was dying
[1:57:38] out now this might seem a little strange
[1:57:40] and no I haven't leaped off any Cliffs
[1:57:42] or sniffed any glue but my brother and
[1:57:44] sister I'm telling you it's getting
[1:57:46] further and further that people would be
[1:57:48] embarrassed if we had an outbreak like
[1:57:50] that in our church
[1:57:52] be embarrassed if somebody jumped up and
[1:57:55] said thank you Lord for saving my soul
[1:57:58] if somebody got beside themselves we
[1:58:01] would be like calm down
[1:58:03] it's not the end of the world
[1:58:05] but it's close
[1:58:09] you see my brothers and sisters because
[1:58:10] it's fading
[1:58:12] it's fading
[1:58:14] but you see God comes along and you
[1:58:16] think okay if they're fading that it's
[1:58:18] over but God comes along and rekindles
[1:58:21] the flame
[1:58:23] my look how excited Israel was when they
[1:58:26] left Egypt I'm telling you I've set
[1:58:28] before I have a vivid imagination as a
[1:58:31] kid teachers used to get all over me
[1:58:32] what are you daydreaming about well you
[1:58:35] know I never explained it to them they
[1:58:36] wouldn't have understood but my brother
[1:58:38] and sister there it was that it's there
[1:58:40] and they're coming and the the
[1:58:42] Fulfillment of Prophecy and they're
[1:58:44] leaving Israel I mean Egypt and they're
[1:58:47] coming out and there was a boldness That
[1:58:49] Came Upon them there wasn't a timid
[1:58:51] people that left Egypt and it was a bold
[1:58:54] people and they went over to the
[1:58:56] neighbors give me your pots and pans and
[1:58:57] I need that bag of flour and I want this
[1:58:59] and I need that I need your cart too and
[1:59:00] I want the ox
[1:59:02] and they went out of there in history
[1:59:04] shows us they went out of there when
[1:59:05] they didn't have tambourines they went
[1:59:07] out of there with two pans together
[1:59:11] if they showed up at our church we would
[1:59:12] turn them out
[1:59:15] because they're just way too carried
[1:59:16] away
[1:59:17] don't they realize the current state of
[1:59:21] religion
[1:59:22] oh oh come on let's just be blind Paul
[1:59:24] current state of the message
[1:59:28] no I'm not advocating that we go pound
[1:59:30] on everything and jump up and down and
[1:59:32] kick every chair and Pew over my
[1:59:34] brother's sister there's balance
[1:59:36] there's balance we don't want to have
[1:59:38] the kind of religion that when the Music
[1:59:40] Stops our worship stops we want to walk
[1:59:43] out of church with what our religion is
[1:59:45] being that we love the Lord enough that
[1:59:47] we take him everywhere amen and we're
[1:59:50] willing to worship him everywhere
[1:59:52] may you look at this now what did they
[1:59:54] do they come out of there and it wasn't
[1:59:56] long
[1:59:57] that all that excitement the pots and
[2:00:00] the pans shouting and Simon it faded
[2:00:03] then God brought him to a place and
[2:00:04] restores it and they go for a season and
[2:00:06] it fades
[2:00:08] Rises up Fades Rises up Fades I'm
[2:00:11] talking about your week last week
[2:00:17] why some of you look nervous
[2:00:21] you know they've invented drones and
[2:00:23] directional mics and
[2:00:25] we need to feel the need to keep track
[2:00:27] of all of you to know your spiritual
[2:00:29] condition
[2:00:32] nonsense
[2:00:35] God knows the up and the down of our
[2:00:37] life
[2:00:38] he knows the rhythm of our life
[2:00:40] and he has Mercy on us
[2:00:44] and he never stops wooing US
[2:00:48] never never stops wooing US never comes
[2:00:54] to the place he says you've had a down
[2:00:55] once many times done with you he Woos us
[2:01:00] again and again and again we're going to
[2:01:04] call this good because I have
[2:01:06] I should have known that I just had too
[2:01:08] much information here
[2:01:10] you know
[2:01:11] Ephesians 4 1
[2:01:15] Paul speaking to the Ephesians says Ah
[2:01:17] therefore a prisoner of the Lord beseech
[2:01:19] you that you walk worthy of the vocation
[2:01:21] wherewith you're called
[2:01:23] so God wants us to do Saints he wants us
[2:01:25] to walk
[2:01:26] amen
[2:01:28] we'll just have to make another part of
[2:01:30] this because now I want to go into
[2:01:32] the voice of this relationship
[2:01:35] hmm
[2:01:38] but sister serif he'll come
[2:01:42] you see my brother and sister it has to
[2:01:44] be a voice in your relationship
[2:01:48] really
[2:01:49] yeah really
[2:01:52] if God's not talking to you
[2:01:55] if God's did you hear me
[2:01:58] if God's not talking to you
[2:02:00] something's missing
[2:02:02] in the relationship
[2:02:05] God help us
[2:02:07] God help us Lord speak to me
[2:02:09] but the scripture tells us to be still
[2:02:12] and know that I am God
[2:02:14] amen Satan has wooed us into our own
[2:02:18] version of a 20-hour a day day go go go
[2:02:24] what is he doing
[2:02:26] he doesn't need to take your Doctrine
[2:02:27] away from you doesn't got to take your
[2:02:29] Bible away from you he doesn't have to
[2:02:31] take the message away from you he
[2:02:33] doesn't have to cause you to be divorced
[2:02:35] and homeless and this and that all he's
[2:02:38] got to do is just slowly
[2:02:41] remove God
[2:02:43] from your life
[2:02:45] it's what he did in the garden
[2:02:48] Eve didn't even realize she left God
[2:02:51] behind
[2:02:53] she didn't have a clue she had left God
[2:02:57] behind
[2:03:00] and Satan did what bought her a big
[2:03:02] screen
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:05] bought her a sports car bought her a
[2:03:06] bigger house he's too busy to clean no
[2:03:09] sir he just changed the word
[2:03:11] it's changed the word and that caused a
[2:03:14] fracture in the relationship
[2:03:17] suddenly she was spiritualized
[2:03:21] and she hadn't just as much Revelation
[2:03:24] as Adam did
[2:03:27] so much Revelation in fact
[2:03:31] they quit calling on God
[2:03:35] I hope we haven't reached that place
[2:03:37] since
[2:03:38] now we've got so much Revelation we've
[2:03:41] quit calling
[2:03:43] amen let's stand just Worship the Lord a
[2:03:46] little bit
[2:03:47] amen
[2:03:48] sorry that I drug this out time got away
[2:03:50] from me I looked at it a little bit ago
[2:03:52] and it seemed like it was not even close
[2:03:56] to noon

[2:04:01] you wonder about this though things like
[2:04:03] John 10
[2:04:04] foreign
[2:04:06] you know they come and they're uptight
[2:04:09] with Jesus you know
[2:04:11] how you how long are you gonna make us
[2:04:12] doubt if you be the Christ just tell us
[2:04:14] plainly and he turns right around and he
[2:04:17] says I told you I've already told you
[2:04:21] see they're going to be looking my
[2:04:22] brother and sister they're going to say
[2:04:23] it wasn't wasn't this to happen wasn't
[2:04:26] that to happen wasn't this voice
[2:04:28] supposed to have spoken
[2:04:30] he's already come
[2:04:32] it's already happened
[2:04:34] because you see they missed it and Jesus
[2:04:36] says I already I already told you
[2:04:39] and while they never said you go through
[2:04:41] the passage of scripture they never said
[2:04:43] we don't believe you
[2:04:44] but the refusal to act upon it was their
[2:04:48] words we don't believe you
[2:04:50] and so it's there and they're they're
[2:04:53] they're going to be upset
[2:04:55] but you believe not because you're not
[2:04:57] my sheep

[2:05:23] and those sheep do not turn to the right
[2:05:26] or left he doesn't have to go buy all
[2:05:28] the fruit in the marketplace because his
[2:05:30] sheep have destroyed it because his
[2:05:32] sheep know his voice and he's in front
[2:05:36] of them continuing to tell them just
