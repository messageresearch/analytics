father i pray lord that you would take these words lord been on a page by a man lord that you would bring the inspiration of the holy spirit behind them father that lord you could touch the hearts of your people tonight we love you so much lord jesus thank you for this opportunity tonight speak to us we pray in jesus name amen praise the lord good to be in the house of god tonight as always i don't remember a chance i got here and said man i wish i hadn't come why don't we stand tonight we're going to open our bibles up john chapter 20. john chapter 20. i don't know about y'all but it's a little warm up here john chapter 20 verse 24. the bible says but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them so thomas came to church this time then came jesus the doors then then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hand and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god jesus saith unto him thomas because thou has seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed first john chapter 5 first john chapter 5 and verse 4 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word may be seated tonight so my title tonight is where's your victory can you put it up because there's that comma is important where's your victory now amen and then my subtitle is the hands of christ so i kind of wanted to take a little bit of liberty some can disagree with me if you like but it's not contrary to the word of god to uh to uh stand on thomas's side tonight so thomas is known by everyone as doubting thomas the bible doesn't label him as doubting thomas the bible just calls him thomas amen what's written of you in the word of god is the ultimate truth we don't hear about abraham's struggles or his mistakes and we read of him in hebrew as we hear of how by faith abraham stood accepting the promise of god and what's written of you and glory is by faith brother paul by faith brother didier by faith for the david for the power stood the test of time and so what is written of you in the word is what we want to stand by i heard one time said do you want to believe what god thinks about you or do you want to believe what the devil thinks about you the devil's a liar anyhow so we have thomas here and now i i mentioned this and perhaps it you know we wonder where thomas was the first time if you go back and you look and and and as we get we look at who thomas was and um what kind of believer he was up until the death of jesus christ the crucifixion of christ and his resurrection if you go in john 11 16 it says where we we we begin the story of lazarus and and this is one of um the first mentions of thomas actually partaking in um the storyline if you will and um mary or martha one of them comes to jesus and says hey my brother lazarus is dying i need you to come but as we know not god could do nothing jesus could do nothing except the father willed it and so it was not yet time for jesus to go to lazarus lazarus had to pass away you never know the will of god but the will of god is always completely and totally perfect and so he jesus says okay lazarus is sleeping and uh but we'll we're waiting to go because it is for your benefit and you know the disciples say well if he's sleeping he must be fine and jesus says no no he's dead but now we'll go and they said you can't go because they're trying to kill you in judea and in john 11 16 then said thomas which is called didimas under his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him so here we have thomas dedicated ready to give his life to stand beside the messiah he was totally convinced or so he thought he had it figured out that this was jesus if you knew thomas as one of the disciples you say this man is he's a one of the disciples he's a good man he's a strong man perhaps someone some said the same thing of judas and this is where it's important where we don't put our trust in men but we put our trust in god because by all accounts and appearances judas went out with them and preached the gospel and when jesus saw the devil fall like lightning from heaven judas was part of that revival but yet judas was destined to just to betray christ and so even even peter and his his zealousness went and betrayed uh or denied knowing jesus and so you you uh at this point in time you say thomas was a good solid believer and thomas goes with jesus and thomas witnesses the resurrection of lazarus have any of you ever seen someone come back to life some of you have i haven't well actually i'm looking at a whole church full of people that have come back to life but um in the physical it's it was a great phenomena here it is lazarus four days so his body's already started to decay and he stands up and walks out of the tomb and they have a nice supper afterwards um you know how was your day lazarus oh it's a whole lot better so this is what thomas is experiencing he's walking with jesus and he sees the miracles come to pass and and constant um reconfirming that jesus is the messiah one thing i'm going to bring out lord willing is you see thomas's desire to know that he knows the truth jesus presents something to the disciples in john chapter 14. i'm just going to flip there real quick so i have a reference for it he says let your heart not be troubled yea believe in god you believe in god believe also in me and my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know and the way you know they've never heard him talk about this till now and now he's telling them you know how to get there and they're saying so thomas instead of just and this is this is what i this is the the what we're getting at tonight thomas doesn't just sit back quietly with the rest of the disciples instead of pretending not his head like he understands those are the when you give somebody instruction they just say yeah yeah yeah yeah and nod their head and they go off and do something totally different i'd rather spend an hour and a half explaining a five-minute task to somebody and send them off knowing they're going to do it exactly how i asked them to do it because they're seeking the answers and people like that they have their whether what it is is they're they're in the game their heads in the game they want to know what's going on they they have skin in the game they want to know what's happening they want to fully understand what they're doing because they are fully partaking of it so thomas we already see his dedication let's go and and and i'll die with with our lord let's go to judea with with the lord and it will give our life with him he's dedicated he's completely sold out and so when jesus brings this doctrine they have not yet heard before he says he says um lord we know not whether thou goest how can we know the way we don't know where you're going lord so how how how are we gonna where where are we gonna get the information do you got a map i mean can you can i get an app on my phone to follow and then know where what what do i have to do to follow you in other words jesus said i'm going to go and you're coming with me and thomas says yes i want to go too thomas shouldn't just sit back and and pretend to be all spiritual and go yep amen right we know those people then they you know you you spend some time with them you fellowship with them and he said they're not understanding it and so but um so here here we have thomas and and and and so he he he seeks the truth he asks questions and he doesn't understand he seeks the truth he wants to know and so now we we we we we stand with thomas at the hill golgotha and we watched the the man that he has suffered and and and and walked long miles and spent late nights and and handed bread to thousands of people um and and seen miracles and and rode across the sea of galilee more than once and spent time and and blood and sweat and and tears into this ministry and now he's dying on the cross and thomas is full of questions he is questioning what's going on what did i what did i miss i knew this was the guy i knew this was the messiah now he's he's dying before my eyes my eyes aren't deceiving me i see him dying jesus is buried a couple days later or the next or the third day i believe it was when they get the first news thomas is there hey he's alive thomas if we read it here in the scripture he says look i watched him die but thomas you you saw all the miracles and and remember when he said this the temple being destroyed and risen again and and everything remember he said this thomas says not thomas could have said oh yeah praise the lord and buried his doubt behind a facade but thomas was what i call a real person he said i don't believe it i want to but unless i see him and put my hands in his hands i can't believe it thomas how how dare you but who was there in their midst who had the same doubt yeah who was there but they kept quiet who is here tonight sitting with doubts keeping quiet while the devil says thank you keep quiet you don't want to let them know you're not because you're not actually believer so if you if you ask that question or or you make that remark or you talk to that and you talk about they're going to know and they're going to ask you to leave or they're not going to want to be your friend or they're not going to talk you or it's going to be awkward who cares awkward is awkward it only lasts for a moment and so so so thomas is expressing his heart we are called as children of god to confide in one another say hey i need prayer we've heard it from our pastor why do we speak of our needs in the back and not request any prayer why are we seeking and why do why do we have people who who who who you talk to who have now every man is responsible for his own soul and they make their choices but why do we have people who after they leave say well i just i felt like i couldn't talk to anybody or whatever everyone has their own choices i don't want to say you need to feel like it's your fault someone left message it's not your fault they made their choice but let's not be guilty of how's that song who will be jesus to them will you be jesus will you be jesus to that strange man that walks in the back or that strange woman that walks in the back will you reach out the loving hand of christ or will you pick up a stone okay that's what i'm getting at so here we have thomas and and he expresses from his heart i i have doubts unless i see it i'm not going to believe it and um i need to go back to my spot so jesus came yes sorry i got the facts wrong jesus came and thomas wasn't there where was thomas is it funny how that one service you miss my goodness you should have been there brother it was a revival thomas was struggling he was down he saw the man he spit poured his heart and soul into die he saw what he believed in his eyes die he saw what he believed in dismantled but thomas had something in his heart something down inside him that brought him back he didn't go off said and say that's it never mind i was wrong and and go off and and do his thing no he came back to church he wasn't at church he was struggling but something in his heart said thomas you need to be there and that was the service that god had planned just for thomas because what's the first thing jesus does he appears he says thomas come here where is your victory now thomas says my victory is in the hands of jesus so now what is it it's faith see jesus says here he says he says now thomas you use believe me because you have seen but blessed are they that have not seen yet had believed but guess what now might be stretching it a little bit didymus means twain or twofold so there's a twofold meaning to this scripture you have to see jesus that's what jesus meant by believing here thomas walks up and we say oh thomas you know he needed more faith but thomas made sure he saw jesus instead of going and playing church you need to make sure you see jesus you need to make sure your victory is in the hands of christ where's your victory now because you're not going to find it now go listen to this sermon faith is our victory listen to it today my goodness it's only about an hour or so of preaching and then he has a prayer line and of course there's more preaching in there but that hour is just jam-packed with good stuff but faith is our victory so now uh you have to so thomas goes up and he he touches the hand and he makes sure of his faith so i had to find my spot again and so now thomas goes out from there nobody's going to tell him jesus didn't raise from the dead amen once you've seen christ nobody is going to tell you he didn't raise from the dead you say oh we all believe he rose from the dead yes but not everybody believes he rose from the pages of history in our day so the word is alive to you we have we have fellow believers who have not yet put their hands into the hands of jesus and they say oh you know yeah they're just nodding their head and they're agreeing and they've got some other thing they're following you know but i would rather say i need to put my hands in his palm i'd rather be real and honest and say look i gotta see jesus because guess what jesus says is blessed are those that have not seen but have believed but you can't have one without the other you have to see jesus to believe him you don't have to see him in the physical to believe him but you have to stand in front of him and reach out and touch him and then thomas jesus appeared before thomas and said thomas come see thomas still had an action to make he could have said oh this is a mirage and walked out the door we've seen people do that as hard as it is to believe but thomas took the steps forward reached out his hands and said now now i believe now thomas has a revelation which is what faith really is praise the lord he sought his answers he didn't hide his doubts and god the lord gave him that boost of faith and the lord took his doubt and replaced it with revelation revelation is faith you can't have revelation unless you have faith that what you're reading and living is the truth brother branham says in faith is our victory i'm going to be quoting from that if you'll only believe you can see the glory of god then faith overcomes death i really appreciated that song his undying love made me undying and that's faith so faith overcomes death faith is the victory over death faith is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness faith is the victory over worry faith is the victory over frustrations faith is the victory over the world we read that scripture in first john you say john when he wrote that he didn't he didn't have troubles he didn't have an iphone he didn't have the internet he did not have to deal with the folk that i deal with he did not have to go through the things that i do that's right we may not he may not had to deal with the same folk he may not had to overcome the same exact thing same thing but he never excluded them for he said this the faith is the victory that overcomes the world so whatever it is it fits that you've got it fits right there praise the lord the whole thing how is it get faith in it right above it when we have the written word of god laying before us and the holy spirit here performing and showing the resurrection of the lord jesus with the divine promises written here that whatsoever thing you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it maybe thomas was out praying maybe he was out seeking because he didn't know he didn't know jesus was going to show up they were just having supper maybe thomas was out seeking his answer get away from the crowd sometimes you have to do that so he goes on to say he says when we have okay what's everything you desire what do you have to do then have faith not just floating faith he says floating faith because prior to this he's talking about driftwood and he's like would you rather be driftwood floating down the the sea of the the stream of life or would you rather be a ship crafted by the hand of the master with a destination so he says not just floating faith not just a make-believe faith but a real faith now faith is a conqueror i really really like this here where he gets going here he says uh um it isn't it just isn't a peacemaker now he said well why did he drop that in there because sometimes faith disrupts the world amen do you think jesus made jerusalem with the jews and the romans more peaceful now he turned their world upside down and he turns you turn my world upside down amen thank you jesus that he did so he says now faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is faith what is to conquer conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prison it means that the sin once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you you've whipped it i love the kentucky english you don't whooped it and handcuffed it and you put it in prison and now the devil says oh remember that sin you put in jail well you know what it escaped and it's come back and you say no no no no my victory now is in the hands of christ that thing doesn't exist anymore i'm sorry wrong number click scam you are greater than it is oh he says i feel religious right now do you kind of feel religious right now amen praise the lord thomas found his victory in the palms of jesus and then he found his revelation of who christ was and nothing nobody could tell him jesus didn't raise from the dead amen and this kind of reminds me of another man in scripture a man named job very familiar very long book i recommend you go and you read it if you have a school he'll tell you who's talking when and take your time and break it down it's an incredible story but i'm going to paraphrase it tonight so job loses everything he owned he lost his camels his donkeys his servants one after the other he got the news this is gone this is gone this is gone no more of this and then he gets the news your children were at a party the house fell down they all died so job is in a really really bad position he's defeated sitting there and we know the story about the devil speaking to god so he says well you know we didn't touch his body so you let me go down touch his body he'll curse you to your face he says go ahead i trust my servant job now how many times do you go through things in life and you think my goodness what's going on and it ain't the devil just i mean didn't jesus just bragging on you say you go ahead devil but i know my child and he or she is going to stand the test of that of that that trial so he gets boils from head to toe he's sitting on the ash heap being rebuked by his friends his three friends uh life has bill dad and one other one and they're telling look joe you're a secret center now how would you like it and they turned their backs on him for seven days they sat there in silence with their backs to him for seven straight days now if you had everything lost from you and i came over to your house and i just yelled at you for being a secret sinner and then i sat in your living room with my back turned in my arms folded for seven days would you feel comforted you would feel even worse you would feel even worse so here he is he's he's got the lousy while he moves and he's down he's scraping his boils in the ash heap and um he he's he's um well he's down okay but and thus skipping ahead i am i might have to preach a message i preached one time about ellie who because there's a lot there but uh god sends a man by the name of ellie who a young man and so brother bottom says there he was sitting out there trying to let the people this is in god perfecting his church trying to let the people see what a condition that man was in sitting out there everything forsaken him some of his church members come down and accuse him of being a secret sinner turn their back to him for seven days what a consolation what a bunch of brethren but the man knew that he hadn't sinned so god's under obligation to visit him so he sends elihu he says wish we had time to go into elihu's name to interpret and to sh and show you it was a representation representative of christ now we're just going to read it because i could not you read it and you i couldn't i couldn't uh paraphrase it it was just it was just too good so you bear with me job chapter 32 so these three men cease to answer and if you read this chapter you get the impression that elihu is the one who wrote this chapter so he says these three men cease to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of biracial the bazi of the kindred of ram against job with his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than god so job was having a pity party also against his three friends was his wrath kindle because they had found no answer and yet had condemned job so they're sitting there condemning joe but they don't have any answer there's nothing they're just condemning job and it's not getting anywhere and job's sitting there and he's feeling bad for himself nellie who's just getting madder righteous indignation now only who had waited till job had spoken because they were elder than he when elie who saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men then his wrathless kindle and elihu the son of rachel the buzz light answered and said i am young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and thus not show you my opinion i said they should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom but there is a spirit in a man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding great men are not always wise neither do the aged understand judgment so what he's saying is just because you're there's an older person in the church doesn't mean they have a revelation it doesn't mean nothing god is not a respecter of persons he doesn't care if you've been here for 30 years do you have a revelation of who christ is and so he says therefore i said hearken to me i will show mine opinion behold i waited for your words i gave ear to your reasons while she searched out what to say so you're looking for things to say and i could tell you were out of things to say but i still waited until you finished yeah i attended unto you and behold there was none of you that convinced job or that answered his words because job would come back with conversation and ask questions well where's god why is this happening what's going on here and they just stared at him with that deer in the headlight look um praise the lord yes lest he should say we have found that wisdom god thrusteth him down not man so he says god thrusted him down amen not man now he hath not directed his words against me neither will i answer him with your speeches job didn't condem job didn't get come after me or argue with me so i'm not going to answer him in that manner and i'm not going to do it the way you guys did it so now this is ellie who's speaking to us he says they were amazed they answered no more they shut up they left off speaking when i had waited for they spake not but stood still and answered no more i said i will answer also my part i will also will show mine opinion for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me behold my belly is as a wine which hath no vent it is ready to burst like new bottles ellie who is sitting there listening to the the to the revelation of man listening to the doctrine of man but the spirit of christ is raising up within him and and he's just i want to speak i want to speak let me speak let me speak so he waits and he waits and he waits until god's ordained time amen there was something within you that was waiting to burst forth at god's ordained time amen so now excuse me i said i will answer also okay below my belly is as wine which have no vent it is ready to burst like new bottles i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips and answer let me not i pray you except any man's person neither let me give flattering titles unto man god help us not amen to to to to water anything down they meant to make someone our friend let us speak the truth and always the truth amen he says for i know not to give flattering titles in so doing my maker would soon take me away amen his maker would soon take away his his effectiveness wherefore job i pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all my words behold now i have opened my mouth my tongue has spoken in my mouth my word shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly i imagine job is starting to get stirred up you ever been down and out and then you get around a brother who's just really feeling the spirit right then there and then something within you starts up to loosen up and you start to get a little bubbly filling down inside of you amen that's contagious for a child of god make someone else just get away and they're afraid of you so the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighty hath given me life you can see job say amen amen if thou canst answer me job set thy words in order before me and stand up if you can answer me you stand up job just sits there quietly behold i am according to thy wish in god's stead amen i also informed out of the clay i am a man but i was sent here to give you a message from god [Music] um you might as well just go on a little further behold i am a court okay behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee and then god doesn't always come god doesn't come when you're down and out and slap you around he says come on son let me tell you who you really are and let me tell you who i really am and reveal myself to you it's what jesus did to thomas thomas walks up and jesus says here you go and then you probably took thomas into a a hug and say thomas you got this you got it there's something within you you got it take this now and tell the rest of the world about it amen and so here here he is with job and and and ellie who goes on to speak and and he and and we know that he's a he's a type of christ and through these anointed words christ reached out his hand to job and job reached out and put his hand and found his victory so now the devil comes around with with the doubts in his mind and and job says sorry says where's your victory now it says my victory is in the hands of jesus my victory is in the hands of christ because i have seen it and i know my redeemer liveth amen job come ellie who comes along and he speaks and then the lord backs up that backs it up and says job gird yourself and stand like a man i mean that's what it takes sometimes you want to be a man you want to be a daughter of god then start acting like one stand up and accept it the devil's trying to knock on your door amen and say look i need to give this back to you you sent it back by accident you say no no my victory is now in the hands of christ that doesn't belong to me i'm sorry the devil comes and knocking you just said no i've already found amen what i'm looking for i already found a revelation and everything you had that you're gonna give me is a lie and you can't convince me otherwise because you're not convinced you have a revelation and you know that you know that you know so with the devil's knocking on your door tonight and he's trying to tell you you ain't nothing but a loser remind him where your victory is remind him where your victory is amen and go aside and build your faith in the word of god amen praise the lord thessalonians 5 4-5 but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief you are all the children of light and children of the day you we are not of the night nor of darkness amen you were at one time you tried this church and that church you tried that drug in this drink you tried that girl and this boy you tried all these things trying to find victory you're in church you're trying to find victory at that message church you're trying to find victory uh with the tapes and you're trying only you're trying to find a victory in the returning of the uh brother branham you're trying to find victory in all these different things you're trying to find victory by going to this man's church you're trying to find victory by going over here and and on going nowhere and then it's sitting home amen and you can't overcome by that type of life you can't overcome but then you cross paths with the truth then you jesus came in your room he stepped the doors were shut oh my goodness praise god you shut him out and he came in anyways you said i don't need this no more i'm done i can't do it and god said sorry i'm still here amen they're gonna try to chase it away they're gonna try to convince you otherwise they've shut the door but jesus is still here tonight and then he's still in the midst of your trial you're standing there like thomas with questions and you've shut the door to you're you're just gonna keep it in you're gonna shut the door and stand there with your questions and your doubts and jesus said i'm sorry you're my seed i'm coming in anyways hallelujah thank you jesus i'm so glad he did that for me tonight i'm so glad he stepped past my closed door and said i'm sorry son you belong to me you can shut me out all you want but i'm coming and i'm coming fast amen and now i'm a prisoner to jesus christ amen life without parole amen brother bennett says and faith is our victory and faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil faith is the victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your creed not faith in some man but faith in jesus christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it is the victory say my arm is still crippered crippled but faith is the victory i still feel sick but faith is the victory you say oh i'm lying no you're not brother baby said speak that perfect body into existence and step into it amen you think we're gonna just uh where do you think the rapture is coming from it's coming from within you and one of these days you're just going to finally say i see it and you're going to be out of here amen you have praise the lord as long as you amen praise the lord man don't faith is the victory thank you lord jesus you still feel sick you still have doubts never mind go to church anyway thomas went never mind don't forsake the fellowship of the brethren thomas went anyways amen and god came and answered his questions praise the lord thomas didn't tell jesus he needed to put his fingers into his hands and the disciples didn't have a chance to talk to jesus before jesus talked to thomas jesus already knew thomas so in other words lord already knows your question that's right but is there some step you need to take is he standing there he's he is standing there with his arms out saying just walk up and put your hands right there that's it amen but you have to take that step of faith amen reach out in your doubt anyways that's that's what god help us it takes revelation that's right but the devil's not going to stop telling you you don't have it that's right amen that's right so let me ask you a question is the devil a liar if you didn't have it do you think he would feel the need to remind you of that if you weren't delivered do you think he would have the need to remind you of that no but see he comes around and he says no you're you don't have it that right there if you can find nothing else to base your faith on base your faith on the fact that he's telling you you don't have it because that probably means you got it amen he's going to come along and try to convince you otherwise but you just you say okay so so my social security is expiring my forgiveness of my sin is expiring why don't you talk to my husband amen don't even listen don't even give him a chance don't give him an ear just say well here talk to my talk to my husband amen god will replace that doubt in your life with revelation and then nothing can turn you aside musicians want to come tonight praise the lord amen it's your faith faith is our victory where do we get faith in the word of god more you read it even if you don't understand it you read it and god is going to give you revelation don't sit and hide in your doubt don't sit with your doubt hiding behind a facade i don't like fake people i understand that when you meet them i have a heart i want them to find jesus and find a way to to because many people build up barriers in their life because they've had issues they've been hurt or all this but with god with christ you have to bear everything you've got to take your bucket your suitcase of garbage and just dump it out and not be ashamed because god is looking down with eyes of grace god ha god is the lord jesus is your friend he's ready he says he says i've been standing here waiting for you to hand me that suitcase i'm strong enough you're not strong enough to carry it but i am let me have it put that put that burden it doesn't have to be a sin that you need to live or not just be a burden a burden for a loved one or a burden for your family or a burden of and that's that you just need to let go of you put in the hands of jesus who better to to take it and deal with it for you because let me ask you this have you solved it yet no you can't put it in the hands of the devil he'll just put it back in yours but you put it in the hands of jesus and he'll take it away from you and then you'll be out living life like thomas was fishing with peter on the lake [Music] excuse me and um he calls from shore have you got anything oh we haven't we've been fishing all night we haven't caught anything thomas was there you go back read the scripture only a few disciples went but thomas is one of them there just cast your net to the other side gasternet john says peter it's jesus they go running the shores fast as they can and their jesus breaks bread with them you say well what if god what if i voice my doubts and you know and you're scared to do it thomas did then jesus broke bread with him amen jesus fed him why what's going to happen when you lay that down to christ he's going to come in with a feast and he's going to give your body strength because your strength is waning your your weakened in body and spiritually and you need god to just come along and maybe and just come along and say you know what here like like elijah in the in the wilderness brought him the food fed him and he went on that for 40 days that's the desire of christ and that's the desire of me [Music] we're all here we've all been there we've all had struggles if you need to talk to a physical person there's brothers and sisters here that love you it doesn't matter it doesn't matter i was in that position as a young man afraid to go to my parents because what would they think but it wasn't until god forced the issue on me i have nothing i could do i was handcuffed [Music] and all they had for me was grace and forgiveness that's all it takes amen that's all it takes and god is the same way you need to go to him just go to him and he'll say you know what you can't surprise god i'm sorry you cannot surprise him amen praise the lord and what are you playing sisters about it's already done [Music] even in your even in your own victories state you already have the victory the devil doesn't want you to believe that though you see what i'm trying you see we see what we're saying tonight doesn't matter what you feel or what you see you have the victory already that's what i feel in my heart tonight that that that's the message that we're trying to get i'm not trying to say you're you're you're i think you're there with already the victory and the devil's just trying to convince you otherwise amen praise the lord oh
