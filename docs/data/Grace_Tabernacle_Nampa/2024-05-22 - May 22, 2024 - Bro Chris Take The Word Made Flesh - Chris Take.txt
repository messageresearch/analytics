Lord amen thank you thank you Pastor we can have our Bibles out tonight we'll turn to John chapter 15 John chapter 15 verse 26 but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and you shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning I think it's Joel he says I knew you before you ever were conceived and this here testifies of that now John 1 verse 1-4 so we just read of the Holy Spirit to come who is the comforter and we read that we would bear witness or we would look like Christ because we have been with him from the beginning now in John 1 verse1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was God who who who was the word with God the same was in the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not the word comprehended means lay hold of yes dark Darkness can't hold light no it's impossible because darkness is the absence of light so there is no ability in darkness to see the light that's right there is no ability thank you Lord for the light in our lives there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe no noce we we it the script he talks about the light lower case L but then he says he identifies the light Capital K's L being Christ that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light to Bear witness that's right you also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world so therefore there's a false light light there's a True Light cuz he didn't doesn't just say light it's the True Light it's the True Light the devil can't create so he just perverts that's right right the The Great Train Robbery brother Bram talks about that light it was the false light stopped the train he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name so you come into contact with the word and you have to receive the word you come into contact with then are you called sons of God which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man say Mom and Dad decided to have me no that was God but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen one last scripture before your before we pray this evening Matthew 24:35 Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away Heavenly Father Lord we just pray you'd come tonight Lord and you would you would harness the man father and the flesh would be completely put aside and sacrificed on the altar tonight and that your word would take full control Lord and speak that you would speak to our hearts Lord Jesus father we we love you we love your word we love everything about you serving you you being here in this building Lord to to step aside father and worship you and and and hear you hear about you Lord hear you more than just words on the lips but revelation of you Lord may you open yourself to us tonight may we may our eyes see more of you Lord may we go a step further into you Lord and realize who you are to see that reflection of Christ in our own lives we pray we love you Lord and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen you may have your seats this evening so I want to speak tonight uh my title is the word made flesh and I want to I want to so I want to open with this quote here and I was reading this last night and I just I had to tell my wife you know brother talks about how he was out there and he was sitting under that tree and I haven't read the story in so long I don't remember exactly what happened but something in the word quickened to him and he ran around that tree when when you read the word of God and something quickens to you maybe something you've heard something you know but it just you see it again in a new light more of himself poured out to you and you read something you you you you read it before you understand it but it just hits you because of of where your thoughts are where your life is where you're reading in the scriptures and and uh you know we think we just get up and we open our Bible and we decide to read the scripture we think we think that but actually the Lord leads us right to where we need to read and we read and and it matches with the sermon we just listened to and everything just goes until the point where you feel like you can hardly contain yourself and and that's that's where emotion just just comes right in line with the word of God in this quote in the comforter he says then what is the word of God what is our comfort today now he's not reading it calmly like I am he is excited when he raises you can go back and listen to it but he says what is our comfort today it's when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of the Living God living in us so God living in us that's our comforter that's why he had to come and die on the cross so that he could come back and pour himself into us right he had to have that access point point right he had to he had to knock that wall down he had to bridge that Gap so he could live in us because it has to be God living in us we have to be to that place so he says with the word of the Living God we stand so the word in us that word is made flesh and dwelt Among Us now the same word that was made flesh and dwelt dwelt Among Us has become our flesh amen so the word made flesh is our title tonight so hopefully you don't leave that title back there for Jesus on the shores of Galilee but you realize that you are the word made flesh and so he says he says the word okay that made flesh and dwelt Among Us has become our flesh you see because how has it become our flesh because as soon as you came into existence your God's word was now walking in flesh amen because because you shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning he he says look the Holy Ghost is coming coming back even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall tell be testify of me and then he says and you shall bear witness why because Christ Living in you and you were with him from the beginning so when when you came and you were born which was not of the will of man nor of the will of Flesh you know even people say you know we we we have there's many sons of God in the world today who came by premarital sex but it wasn't it wasn't that wasn't a desire of the flesh even though you could say it it was right but it was God's hand I I'm not here to explain why but that's what happens it's God's hand so you became flesh now what happens was was when you were born and you came out out and you were there and maybe you grew up in the world that you were you were sinful you were you were acting the flesh because you didn't know who you were as soon as you realized who you were now the word begins to act through your flesh because your flesh becomes subject to the word of God so you so God says looks out he says there's my My Flesh again so he is with you now but he shall be in you now that same word that the prophet spoke that same word that was made flesh that same word that dwells in the church so the word is dwelling in the church dwelling in the bride of Christ you see the bride is the word made flesh amen not every body is is there yet we preach to the group God deals with the individual that's right so we have to let the Lord guide you because we look at ourselves in the mirror and we say well that ain't that ain't right it's God like leading you God guiding you God opening the the desires of of your of his word in your life but we preached to the group and God deals with the individual I think well that's something else so we'll get back to the quote here he says now the the same word that the prophet spoke that same word that was made flesh that same word dwells in the church therefore if we don't compromise that word we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when it was made flesh because your flesh holds it so you want to you want to read about what you're going to do you can read the gospels that's right but and God you say well brother I know people who go to church who don't act like that see God bring God's bringing them along because you look at them and then you look at yourself in the mirror right I mean we all have our we all have the our shortcomings where we need to grow further in Christ because the word how do you how do we say this the word will bring forth the word that's right so the word in you you you you see why you see why you need the word because you you are the word okay so word feeds word did you know that a lamb can only marry a lamb that's right the two shall become one why is it why is it that he says okay let's finish because there's this great spot in this quote that's the reason Vision the the same quote can break through the sound barrier that's the reason a vision can break through time barriers and say thus say the Lord it shall be so and so and that's the way it is what is it it's the word coming forth from a spirit amen next quote he says you do not see me you see my body you don't see me I don't see you because I only see your body this is my hand but who is me that owns the hand this is my body but who is me it's a spirit and if I'm born again if you are born again it's God's holy spirit God's word living in us see this is kind of part two from last Wednesday you see you're not looking at this isn't me the real me is inside it's Jesus Christ the word of God so when I look at you I'm seeing the flesh I I can't see who you I can't really see you because the word is living in you but then you will do something you'll act something and we'll say wow he looks just like his dad if you are born again it's God's holy spirit God's word living in us and if we compromise upon this word and say that we have the spirit of God how can we claim to have God's spirit when God's spirit testifies of his own word right so he'll never move an inch from it no matter what denomination says how is he going to move from it when it's his own word yes so how are you go back don't jump ahead yet how are you going to move from the word when you are the word that's that's why it's it's Revelation Faith cometh by hearing the word of God well you just listen to a sermon and suddenly you have faith no it's revelation of the word of God he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit of God is saying to the churches so we have the word of God we have the spirit of God speaking to us today and it's testifying of the word that is within us and when we see that's what Revelation is is when you you Revelation is when you see the word in you right you say well no brother Chris no I I I understood it yeah you understood it because you saw you in the word of God you read it and something inside of you said I accept that why did you accept it because it was his own word amen you read the word of God what that's brother says the Deep calleth to to the deep and there's the Deep to respond what is it the word calling to the word and there's a word to respond so Revelation that is why when you have a revelation of the word of God it's not intellectual it's down deep inside of you because why now it's like a book right it's the seals within you being opened that's what it is that's right and and some some of it's still sealed up for us but as we progress God's word is open before us and we can unlock those things those hidden mysteries in our own lives and we can see God's word because once you see the book open in your life you can't unsee it that's right because it's you amen it's who you are Alex cannot stop being Alex that's right take that either way you want love you no you can't stop being that's why you see you just you can't you read the Bible and I already said it you cannot see it okay and that's why it's so important because that's what anchors you amen it's Anchored In what the hidden Mana why why is it Brother David said on Sunday why is it anchored behind the veil because that's the hidden Mana that's the place nobody can go to nobody can go to this place only you can that's right and only you can go to that place in you you can't go to that place in your pastor you can't go to that place in your brother or your sister you or your parents you have to go to that place in you because only you you the word of Christ inside of you is the only word you can catch a revelation of you see if if if God knows you and you know God the devil knows who you are so therefore what power does that give you you say oh my goodness now the devil knows who I am I have a Target on my back no no no don't look at it like that look at it is as you are the sons of God around the throne there's you there and you here so how can you do anything besides what the word is doing in your life he say well I have lots of mistakes have you corrected them yes there you have it flesh subjected to the word of God Amen there's a season there's a time we go and we do it and we say oh my goodness Lord forgive me then you move on you know you move on because the word the word moves on the word moves forward so you say well well God turned a corner oh my goodness God turned a corner I got to make sure I catch the corner no just make sure you have the word that's right make sure you have access to the word that's inside of you make sure that the the word because you see God said in Matthew excuse me in John he said you've been with me from the beginning so while we were yet sinners Christ died for us why why would he do that why would he die for you while you were still a sinner while you were no different than the man who beat him and spit in his face you were no different than that man why would he die for you while you were yet a sinner because you're the word amen amen so when he died he died for the word that was with him in the beginning that's why so that now you have access to that part of you that was always there brother the B says I rose with Christ he pretty much goes through the entire Bible I mean you talking about this part I wanted to read the whole quote but that that just not you go home and listen to it but he says he says I was with Joshua when he stood there looking at the walls of Jericho he says I had to be there because I'm the word amen I was there when when we were there when Enoch stepped from this world to the next because we're the word me and you were there when when when Christ spoke to the Pharisees and said how can a house divided against itself stand we say well there's opposition I'm being persecuted you were already there you've already done it that's right you've already stood against the persecution you were with Paul and and Peter and them when they had to hide and sneak over the wall you were there why because you were the word and Paul's the word you see the word testifying of the the word amen that's right there's nothing you can do it's your lineage amen it's who you are sorry before you before you ever had a choice God chose you you didn't choose God why is that true because in the beginning you were with God Amen logos that's it says the logos went out from God right it went out from God and the world was created and there was there was Spirit man why did why would there Spirit man because God's a spirit so there had to be a spirit man and then he made man in the of the dust made he made man in the image of himself which was Spirit man then he this is right in the message you can go read it then he made him the man of the dust that's right so therefore who's the real man the man of the dust or the man of The Spirit Well which one's in the image of God the man of the spirit that's right that's why we don't look for God in flesh you say the word made flesh you just contradicted yourself no no no no no this isn't this isn't it the word here the this vessel is carrying around the word of God so when we speak how do we speak Mountain worlds into existence how do we speak to mountains and make them move if we're just flesh man born in sin Shi and iniquity come into the world speaking lies because we're not we're the word we are the word today oh where's God we need a Revival we need a Revival denominations and everything and even some message you know we need a mass Revival or whatever I didn't mean that in a derogatory way in m survival no that's not what it is we just we we need the word of God because well I lost my train of thought so maybe the Lord has a different direction so the word of God made flesh in you and me am That's Where It's At that's right that's that's right where you know you just hear Brother brandom Minister and you know I'm in 65 right now you can you can hear he just he wants them to get it so bad am he wants them to get it so bad and it just wasn't them it was for us it was for us but the word had to come through the prophet that's right exactly right you see God's not limited by time he recorded the prophet's voice amen see you can't you know God is is perfect always perfect so he says he says and how is he going to move from it when it's his own word right amen so in in this this next quote it's actually in the comforter as well he says he's talking about coming into contact with the word now something just it's just you know this will just get you all fired up you read this they saw him stop the woman of n come down there when the funeral procession and her only son a corpse embalmed going to the grave but that corpse came in contact with the word though a corpse yet did he live though he were dead yet shall he live a corpse came to life because it come in contact with the word oh what will it do when it when it when in contact with that word that's a comfort that's it so praise God we were a corpse we came in contact with the word but the thing of it is is that you have to remember people say well I came in contact with the word and nothing H nothing changed me the contact with the word has to be received he says he says you shall wait nope we're in John this is where it is he came unto his own and his own received him not every Man was created by God Amen so you say his own well I thought we were his own no he's referring to Creation they couldn't receive him they couldn't receive him why couldn't they receive him they came into contact with him I mean the Pharisees you know the man brother uses this example all the time the man that smacked him in the face never felt no virtue he was in contact with the word he was in contact with the word the Pharisees were in Fellowship if you could say this well Fellowship you have to be in agreement but they were in conversation with the word he says oh if I could you say oh if I could just get to the word if I could just be in the word if I could just hear the word of God and you do and why don't you get Victory because you don't receive it you say oh that's that preacher's idea that's his opinion that's I I think that's the greatest fallacy we have as human beings is when God anoints a man to minister and and and the word come forth and we hear it and it's something we need and it's something that touches us but we aren't ready to receive it we say it's his words but it's not that's why you make sure the men that are behind the pulpit in your church are called anointed of God that's the point so then if they are and if if you're going to say that when we preach you into into heaven then you have to receive it when you preach your flesh into hell not in a angry way or damning way but I I deal with that I hear the word I say well that's just his idea then the Lord checks me he says well is either it's me or or it's not me and if it's not me why are you sitting here and that's the biggest thing saying to God we hear the word and we don't receive it why because we're not ready to receive it but it's not just con the point I'm making is it not just contact with the word she had Faith that's she had the faith Revelation she knew she she she's there mourning all of sudden she looks up and she says that's the word amen and that's why he lived this corpse who's not a corpse anymore he's alive breathing because he received the word was received so the Pharisees and the Sadducees they conversed with the word but they didn't receive the word they the light was there but they couldn't receive it because they were Darkness Darkness can't lay a hold of the light Darkness can't comprehend it that that's why you you you can't that's why you cannot explain the word of God because if you could explain the word of God then Darkness could hold on to light but Darkness can't hold on to light you turn off the lights here right now and you know it's going to be dark well sort of dark but somewhat darker and then you you try to hand Darkness the light Darkness disappears that's why the Devil comes to you just hand him the word that's right don't hand him your own you know don't hand him your thing your stuff you say well I'm going to put my foot on the enemy's neck do you know how you put your foot on the en on the enemy's neck you speak the word it's not that you physically put your foot on his neck no you speak the word that's right so the word says when the Devil Comes resist him and he will flee it's word resisting the darkness it's light turning on that's what it is the darkness comes to tempt you turn the light on brother man preached a simple sermon yet so profound there's a man he that can turn on the light that's right says oh little girl says I'm scared I'm scared it's super Darkness don't worry there's someone who can turn the light on ask and you shall receive the Bible says so when light turns on there's no more Darkness there's no more fear that's right but you have to have the Revelation to turn on the switch you know if I turn the switch line into my house nothing happens I'm going to the control board say look what's wrong there's a fuse you know fuse there's a breaker blown I need to fix this and if that doesn't go then I I go hunting down and I say okay Idaho Power why don't I have power as though there's an outage in your area and we're we're working on it we're fixing it what is seek and ye shall find the answer that's right something's not working a promise to of God is not coming to pass in your life don't just give up that's right go figure out why the light won't turn on and many times it comes back around and it's a god saying look I need you to be more perseverant he gives you the faith and he tests your faith so the light won't come on I know people and I and I and I sat there and I had a conversation with them and they told me I tried it and it didn't work and I I I I was there and In the Flesh I I was said you know what I can see why you say that you did try but you stopped short because the the word of God says give me everything everything I want everything why because the flesh has to die we had to die we we if we're going to be the word of God we were if we were going to be with God when he died on the cross we had to die too our flesh had to die amen it had to be buried to raise again what not this flesh but now raise again in Christ what happens our flesh is in control that's right of the word of God within us so he says oh it didn't work that's because you didn't give it enough time you didn't give it enough Faith because when people say it doesn't work and they walk away what they're saying is that I don't want to I don't want to so now you're not you're here you're serving God you got the Holy Ghost but there's something in your life that you need from God this is something you really need don't stop he told the woman this saraph phenician woman he ignored her he ignored her she turned the light switch and nothing happened so she went to the breakers she says she continued to say Lord please and at the breaker box there was no power he turned around and says look I'm not going to give to you was the children's bread be given to the dogs so she called the power company she says but Lord I can eat the crumbs off the table God says your daughter's healed why he was testing her faith he knew who she was he knew her faith but he tested it why because he's God cuz he's God and if he tests your faith guess what you're that much stronger why are you that much stronger because you have that much more revelation of the word that's within you yes sir you see there's nothing lacking the the the power of Christ is within us what lack is our faith to use that power and I think sometimes the reason we lack the faith is because we don't understand what God's trying to say and we're trying to physically put our foot on the neck of the enemy you stand you stomp the floor and you say well I putting you under my feet that doesn't do anything the word of God puts the devil down am that's why the that's why the atmosphere changes when you put on a sermon it's the word of God being spoken that's why your atmosphere changes when you read your Bible right or put on a song what is it it's the word that's why it's important what music you listen to because it's got to be the word if it's not the word then it's not going to do anything for you but the word because you're the word because you you look at the word you say how can they eat all that junk food and still survive they're not the word you're the word so you can't go out there you can't eat that stuff and survive you know your life will just be in shambles you look at your neighbor and says man he he done and he you know he uses the lord's name in vain and everything else and look at him he's thriving got his business and all that kind of stuff and making the money and living the life and he's got the boat and and everything he he could imagine and and he lives his entire life that way smokes like a chimney and dies at 95 but what what that doesn't matter that doesn't matter who wants who wants to live like that anyways but you see but the it's because you can't do that because you're the word amen so as soon as you this is where it just frustrates me frustrates me I get righteous righteous indignation when I see people and I say I know you're a child of God and that's why your life's terrible in the world and you just want to say why don't you just come to church you you everything you want you can't get because God won't let you because you're the word that's you say while I was get sinners Christ died for you so you were the word that's that's why you couldn't make it it just oh my goodness you just it wouldn't work you tried to leave church you tried to give up on church and it just wouldn't work God made your life miserable why because you're the word the word needs word in the beginning was the word the word is with God and the Word was God the word needs the word in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says that's in Christ the word word he was the word he is the word and the church becomes the word by him making her a part of him that's the word again amen it's the word again and again Loos you know we we the word the English this is going to sound the the word in English for word is overused because it's part of our language logos though for us we're not Greek right so we hear the word logos for me it resonates deeper because the meaning is deeper the logos you go in the in the Bible and you look up what that is and where that goes through in the scriptures it's more than just a word spoken by a man that's right it is the deity of Jesus Christ in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with God and the logos was God so now that means logos has logos to impart because the Lo ghost was with God that's right so God has more God in the beginning all of us were with God we were there with God because it just says right here the word was with God are you the word were you with God John said the word is with God so you were there with God that's why you're going back to where you came from that's right why did you have to come down here because you need character to handle the word the word God has given you you need the character to handle it oh God Jesus can't we just call fire down upon them what if they had all the word in Perfection they would have called fire down upon them no character that's right but you're going to be a ruler you're going to rule so you need character to handle the word of God you have all of the power but God keeps you from accessing all the power because of your faith and your faith is perfected in what your suffering amen your character guess what this is going to be this is going to blow your mind Jesus wasn't ready for the Cru CR fiction at age 30 y because you were in him y he needed Perfection you say well he was perfect he had to walk that road that's right he had to come through that Ministry to get to that position because he had to know what it feels like to be you that's right why so his word could change you he needed to know he needed to be your kinsman redeemer he needed to have access he needed to walk in flesh and show you you can be all God and all man that's right you can be all Brother David but all Christ that's right you can be all Aaliyah but all Christ EXA right each one of you y so when you're lacking it's not that you don't have the word you're lacking access to the word you have y so you say God give me more faith give me more Revelation Lord show me more about yourself what does that do why is that so important he says oh it's just it's just something I Now understand about the Bible no it's something you know have a revelation of you and when you have a revelation when you have a revelation of you guess what victory you're going to have that's why we need it it's not about knowledge and be able to explain it that comes with it because you're going to talk about it you're going to Fellowship about it but what it does is it gives it victory in your life amen it says why do I need to know why this seals are open because it's Revelation for greater Victory amen because your Revelation he overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony your testifying of Christ and if you need all Christ to overcome all of the enemy then you need to understand and have a revelation of all of Christ to be able to testify see testimony we're not talking about just what oh the other day I was driving and then I stopped and there was a car that read that's not what that's talking about that's talking about testimony what it's the word in you speaking out saying look this is what the SC I was reading the scripture the day and it said this and it mean this to me what is it it's it's Revelation and when that revelation of the word that's within you it grows then she will be an invincible Army so you need to know you need to listen to the tapes 47- 65 read the Bible you need that you need God to give you revelation of it don't read it like a newspaper don't read it like a newspaper brother says youve got to know your ABCs before you can know algebra in other words you have to know God keeps his word Before He'll reveal to you more of who you are more of who you are because he's showing himself to you and you are recognizing your position in Christ he was the word he is the word and the church becomes a word by him making her a part of him and that's the word again right see word begot word personally identified by him his property alone amen property of property of Jesus Christ I am a prisoner to Christ that's right that's what Paul was talking about prisoner a prisoner can only do what the warden says he can do that's right and he can only go as far as the warden says he can that's right and he can go outside when the warden says he can he says oh my goodness that sounds like prison right but you see it's the best place you could ever be amen C Paul was making a point and it's not it's not the it's you're harnessed you're harnessed by Christ that's right because you're harnessed because you can't move an inch from the word if you're the word you see I think we've complicated it too much and I mean at least I know I did we're going out and we're we're trying to get you know someone told me one time well how do you get Faith and I well Faith kind of gets you actually that's right see we're trying to get Faith and you know it's almost like forgive me for this example but it's almost like you know you're you're trying to to be be a a a Jedi master and focus and move something across the room or whatever like think that's in Star Wars right Focus your energy on something and move it that's not how it is it's not magic no it's not magic it's you it's the word within you pushing out that's right and so if you want the word to push out your cup overfloweth you want your cup to overflow you want the iniquity to go out fill up the cup fill it up feed the word that's within you because the word within you has to be fed otherwise the flesh starts to take control that's right so he says word again personally identified by him his property alone she is Redeemed by him through him for him and for him alone amen that's right then what the devil is howling about that's I'll rephrase it for for him because this is what he that's why the devil's howling right because it's being revealed to you that's why the devil is howling that's why the world is trying so hard to distract you that's right because you're he's it's being revealed to you amen it's being revealed amen it's being revealed I am Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever I am that I am always present always present right look at the natural people you know natural we just want to be present you know in in companies and everything we present in the moment live in the moment be present right I just want to be you know a CEO I want to be present that's the natural type in the spiritual amen present God not the god of the past not even the god of the future right now because if you get the god present guess what you'll get the god of the future and you'll get the god of the past that's right because you have God Amen God is outside of time that's right so we don't have to go back to get God and we don't have to wait to get God he's always because he's not part of time therefore how in the world can eternity dwell within you a finite body the Paradox of a son of God you see why the world looks on it says you have lost your mind yes I have and I taken on the mind of Christ you can't even think like a human anymore you got to think like Christ amen Christ is outside of time so therefore you have to think beyond the limitations of time and realize it doesn't matter time does not matter you say brother Chris really amen here in a few hours I'm going to have to go to bed because time says so but that's not the real you that's it that's the person you have to put up with till you can be the real you in flesh so you can be the real you when your theophany comes and you meet face to face guess what that's your transition across time poof now you're no longer part of time you see you contain the potential to be Eternal that's right you have the potential to be everything word is and your access to that is revelation amen is hearing the word of God Slow Down slow down you don't need to read five chapters a day if you don't get five chapters a day slow down some people do sometimes I I say down and I read several chapters and I'm it's all just flowing together and it's amazing sometimes just one because it's access to God it's not a checkbox stop serving God like it's a check box look the Bible says when the house of when the doors of the house of God are open be there right but don't treat it like a checkbox that's right you didn't you're not here because you're you're supposed to that's right you're here because this is what the this is the reality we're we we have church service twice a week Sunday morning Wednesday night sometimes we have Sunday evening or whatever tce twice a week and that's the real part that isn't real that is simply an ends to a me means to an end end emphasis on end thank you Lord that's right and the reason that God has to the reason that God has to make things uncomfortable because he wants to you to remember you don't belong here that's right so you can you'll have success I believe that but it'll never be what just what you want it'll never be that perfectness until you get in Christ and then you realize wow so you get off you get off this way a little bit God's going to poke you so you go back this way to him and really what that is is that's the word inside of you saying man I'm starving because the word needs the word it's the word again amen amen him him by him making her a part of him that's the word again amen again exactly again again I Die daily Amen in other words I go back to the Cross every day because I was in him when he died on the cross that's right and I was him in him when he rose again so I go back to the Cross what is the cross it's not what the world has painted it to be it is you and him that's it bearing the iniquities of your flesh and burying them that's right bearing the iniquities of your flesh and burying them why because the word the word shoved that old man down into the grave and when he rose again that old man was subject because Jesus was in one place then he wasn't he was in a glor body he rose up to heaven how come he didn't do that before cuz it wasn't glorified body so you want to rise up into heaven come into more contact with the word of God so he says identified by him that okay that's what the devil is howling about now in the identified Masterpiece of God he says I am identified with him and his death see I referenced this earlier I just took a a piece of it I died with him when he died at Calvary and I rose again on Easter morning with him and in the power with him in the power of his resurrection so you already have the potential to raise again I'm talking when you die here when you actually die here your body dies you have the you you have the power within you to resurrect that's how you're going to resurrect praise God because the word can't stay in the ground I'm a witness of it tonight I died with him at Calvary raised with him on Hallelujah to be part of him I have to be identified with him Amen to be a part of him you have to be identified with him you don't have a choice you have to be identified with him but if you think about it the Paradox of that statement is that you don't have a choice right God chose you you didn't choose him that's why that works because you're the word you didn't have a choice if you're going to be Christ you're got to always be Christ amen if you're going to be a part of God you have to always be a part of God because the script says right here in John 15 you have been with me from the beginning that's right those who are going to get catch the comforter those are that are going to receive the comforter had to already be with him from the beginning amen had to be because if you're going to be the word in flesh you have to always be the word you have to always because the word is what Eternal that's why that that's why predestination works because you always were a part of God he saw the decisions you would make he saw how you would live out your life right and he said those are the fruits of my word amen that's why it comes back to this thing over and over and over again the statue of a perfect man that's right so you have things in your life that are not subjected to the word of God you're not there yet so how do you get there self-help books meditation anger management classes no no you feed on the word of God that's right you know as a preacher I say those words and the flesh part of me says that's too simple but that's really all this is about that's right when you're here tonight you're hearing me preach I believe God's speaking through me it's the word you're hearing the word I think we would treat Church a lot different if we really understood that amen we really understood that we're here the word is is is you know look with me for a second the word is is out here and it it's bouncing off the walls it's circulating and what is it man no it's logos amen he says I am the word so when we speak the word right here right now standing here on this piece of carpet the word of God Christ himself is present because low cost am because it's the word so what do you have need of what do you have need of you want God put to to to to to test in your life ask what you want sister Nadia ask what you want the word of God has to come back full it cannot return void am the check can't be voided God has a promise sorry say not God has a promise for you I don't know what's going on here but this is God God has a promise for you sister amen and he will bring it to pass in your life that is thus sayith the Lord that's right amen God's word always comes to pass it cannot return void if God speaks it it has to happen and if you speak it as the word of God it has to happen amen but God won't let you speak it outside of his will because you are his word you won't move an inch from it that's right Saints if we really knew well we will really know praise God I am the identified Masterpiece of God that's right to be a part of him I have to be identified with him I was identified with him when the denominations turned him down I was identified with him when they ran him out of the temple that's right when they tried to get rid of him I was with him there that's it I was with him in his death raised with him in the resurrection amen that's absolutely and I was with the 120 when they climbed to The Upper Room yes sir I witnessed that Mighty rushing wind coming from Heaven amen I spoke in tongues with the anointed on the day of Pentecost why because you're the word amen you did too you spoke you were there he says well I've never spoken in Tong s yes you have you were there say well I've never raised the dead yes you have you were there amen says well I I I I've never you know I've never stood against opposition and and overcome it I've always cowered away no you haven't you were always there that's why Jesus said don't worry about it I'll put the words in your mouth why because you are the word amen so what do we need to tap into when we're fa with something what do we need to tap into the word amen not the universe the word word that's it and when the word washes over you that seed you know we just had some rain do you ever have y'all ever noticed how green it is after it rains yes sir it's a same grass that was there yesterday and it's not it's not wet the the rain has dried but it's green amen what is it it's the rain amen it is God in nature testifying of your life because he brought the washing of the word upon you and you saw colors you never seen before amen what because we're talking about colors no you saw something you saw something in the word of God you never saw before look everybody has this Bible but not everybody has the logos that's right exactly right this Bible is printed and taken all over the world world but it only affects logos that's right it only affects the word of God I was there because I'm identified with him that's right I preached with Peter in Acts 2 why I preached with him there that's why we can baptize in no other way but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because we're the word and we were there amen that's why when you heard serpent CED for the first time you said man that makes so much sense why because you thought different no no no because you're the word and when the word comes to the word the word recognizes it amen when the word comes to the word so when the word comes to you the word inside of you you didn't even know what's there recognizes the word that's right and then your life testifies of it that's why I don't have to worry about it when somebody's coming to the Lord and they look like a mess don't worry that's right the word will change that's right the word will change why because they realize this isn't who I am you know it's like somebody who who's growing up and they they growing up in a city but in their heart they they love nature and they love being in the outdoors and they love the the countryside as soon as you put them in the right environment they dress different they act different they have different activities why because it's who they really are that's right so as soon as you put you in in a different environment who you really are comes to life that's right that's why it's so important the atmosphere you dwell in that's right amen you're going to go to a bar and testify to somebody you just put yourself in the wrong environment amen that's an extreme example so every day you live your life your home your cubicle at work your desk your tractor your toolbag your truck has to be the environment of Christ you watch your life change you watch your life change and then when you play something when you do something in there not sinful but not the word the atmosphere shifts that's right for example let's say you have a tape playing the atmosphere is there you pause the tape your kid send you a video of cats you watch the kitty cats guess what atmosphere shifts it's not bad but it's not Christ atmosphere shifts so you're thinking I don't feel God I don't even feel like going to church change your atmosphere that's it amen you're sitting at home and say I don't even want to go to church tonight put on a tape put on put on anointed music of the Holy Ghost guess what you go to church I mean you will anyways but the desire will come why because the word says wow I need more of this and I'm going to go get it at church brother bam talks about the that that disc disc whatever it was they had that played the music and he said I just play that all the time when I'm feeling down I turn that on you see what it what why is it is it just because it's music knows cuz it's word music it's a music of of Christ and I'm only saying that because you have the power to create the atmosphere and and and the point that the holy spirit is trying to make tonight is that many times we try to just change the atmosphere instead of doing that excuse me we try to just change our atmosphere no don't approach it like that go to the thing you need to change the atmosphere you brother bam had the atmosphere in him when he went into the kitchen he was already there she wasn't so he was the Catalyst for the atmosphere changed the atmosphere shift he was a catalyst but if it's your whole family is a mess the day is not going good it's Monday on a Thursday don't try to just say okay guys let's just stop having a bad attitude that's not going to work put on a tape read the Bible pray what are you're doing you're saying God changed my atmosphere you're saying you're bringing word into the present that's right and that is what shifts is you need healing in your life bring word to the present don't think about how God might heal you someday bring word to the present I like that bring word to your present whatever your present is bring the word here amen that's right praise the Lord I preached with Paul on Marsh Hill before the critics yes sir I had to be I was with John on the aisle of patas patmas see I've never boiled in oil yes you have I saw the vision of his coming I saw Luther yes sir I was with him when in the Reformation I was with Wesley so the word always the word amen okay I'm closing here soon next quote identified Masterpiece of God he says come back and let the master we're going to close with this come back and let the master pick up the bow so he's he's talking about it's the same Sermon Just further down and he talks about how he was with God and Christ and he was there with Paul and he was there with Wesley and all these things and and he he immediately he get he says you remember the story about the violin does that feel like a dramatic shift in thought process if you don't slow down you think it you think it is he oh he just turned a corner no he's expounding he's expounding on the idea that we are him we were with him amen okay so the flesh is always there with you it's a paradox right it's always there so now here's here is the recipe for Success he says let the master pick up the bow that's it he says oh I'm the word I was always the word I was with God yes but let the master pick up the bat that's right you tried to play the violin who'll give me $1 he'll give me three and then the man came forward and picked up the bow what Christ the man Jesus Christ the son of man came and picked up the bow and began to play a song on your life that's it and that's when the word resonated forth and says I was with Paul on Marsh Hill the word came forth and say I was with Wesley what is why the sound I keep listening for a different sound why your life now makes a different sound you sing to a new tune because the master picked up the bow stop trying to make the word come to flesh let the master pick up the bow amen he says let the master pick you up in his hands strike the word that's it amen strike the word you try to strike the word in your flesh who give me$ one who give me three but you let the master strike the word in your life 1,000 2,000 5,000 more what made the difference it was the touch of the Master's Hand say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to today and forever you see what I said last Wednesday you always will come back to that scripture say Amen Lord Make Me mold me make me Lord what I should be the clay can't make the pot the master makes the clay the pot amen the master makes the flesh the Manifest the word amen the word is there the word is in you but you will fail every time because you need the touch of the Master's Hand he said then there'll be a then there will be a different thing how 1 2 3 four five what is that five words one two three four five six words six words that is your entire life right there then there'll be a different thing what the word of Christ the word speaking through you then if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto me yes sir he's cutting you out now remember this is the identified Masterpiece of God so he's talking about the the the the the man who built the Statue he shuck the the knee and when he did that he made a masterpiece why because nobody could mimic that strike it pleased the father to strike him it pleased the Lord to strike you why because he's cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only so you have the flesh and you have the word But as time progresses there'll be less flesh more word amen until you see this is why the Rapture I said I was closing this is why the Rapture faith is in you already because your body will get to a place where there's so much word amen and so little flesh it has to Rapture because all word can't all word in a body can't stay here that's what Enoch did his body became all word amen so that's the goal all word cutting you down musicians will come tonight cutting you down to his word only cutting all the Creeds and dogmas and everything away from you in other words the lies the devil told you dogmas that's false Doctrine that's right the devil can't speak truth the lies the devil has told you he's cutting those away you see but I I I I I I sinned yeah because you didn't know you you believe the devil's lie you you took the bottle because you believe the devil's lie you believe that's who you were but then when you saw who you really were then you changed brother bud when did you stop smoking just now what happened word met word right amen everything away from you trying to get back to a bride for the son another masterpiece part of the word amen you see Saints it's not of our own abilities no that's why his strength is perfected in our weakness right because if we weren't weak why would the master need to pick up the bow if we weren't sick why would the Healer we wouldn't need a Healer right the only way for the word to come through in your life is for the master to pick up the bow The Man Standing on the platform had to hand the master the violin and the boat he had to give him over the
