wrestling match with the Enemy this evening I uh went to head out the door and my computer wouldn't give my iPad and my sermon so I printed it and I printed a doesn't have no ink so I put it on my phone so I brought my phone my iPad and my computer tonight just in case but soon as we got here it uh it worked so we praise God for that amen Matthew Chapter 2 verse1 let's pray first Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we have one desire tonight Lord and that is to hear from you Lord we could come up here and speak as a man and it might sound good to the ears and tickle the feelings Lord but father it would do nothing for the heart and the soul and Lord that's what we need is a changing of our hearts for Lord when the Seas get high and the wind blows hard Lord that is what holds Lord is at anchor father so Lord tonight I pray you'd speak to the Heart Lord Jesus take these words the simple thought that you have given Lord in your Simplicity in your revealed word father that you would touch us speak to us tonight we thank you Lord for these things in Jesus name we pray amen Matthew chap 2 verse 1 but now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him it in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor and that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also and when he had when when they had heard the king they departed and low the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy when they were coming into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and wor woried him when they had opened their treasur Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh and being warned of God and a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way amen Matthew chapter 6:33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you may the Lord add a blessing the reading of his word you may be seated tonight all right see this works really good awesome so my title tonight is unashamed possessors of Truth and my subtitle is tenacious Seekers so as I was uh going through some the message and searching some different things and reading some quotes um SE seeking out what the Lord wanted me to speak tonight um I Came Upon it was quick I I thought of the word Seekers and um from there we have what we're going to minister on tonight I had no intentions of preaching anything about uh Christmas as it were but the wise men came to mind when I thought of The Seekers and um so the unashamed unashamed possessors of Truth so praise the lord we have the wise men and they were Seekers of Truth the sign in the star that um the the sign of the star in the heavens made them Seekers they were wise men but once they began to be drawn to the sign the star they became Seekers of truth because they wanted to know what it was the star was pointing them to and the definition of that or not the definition but the Fulfillment of that was truth and um praise the Lord so they read the sign they believed the message the sign had gave them you forgive me I'm a bit nervous just trying to relax still praise the Lord but God is faithful so they followed the star to find the king and they went to Herod and they said where is the king of the Jew so they knew by reading the sign of the star that there was going to be born a king and they praise the Lord so a a reference was made to the star but the E inas excuse me emphasis was on the reason for the star brother Bram says in uh God revealing himself to his people he always sends signs don't you believe it this will be a sign unto you you will find the child wrapped in swaddling cloth is that right the Wise Men followed a star that brought them always God gives signs and wonders and I think it's a sign to let us know that we are in the last day even the unbeliever is without excuse now he says in at Thy word 1951 now he will before certain people sometimes just before masses and multitudes but you remember the wise men what did they see when they followed to Jesus nobody else saw it it passed right over the observatory every planetarium is that right and every city had a planetarium they kept timeing by the stars is that right and isn't it strange that them wise men went right through city after city city after City following a star that even the stargazers and the men in the planetarium in telling the time and things never saw nothing of it they were looking for it that's where it's at you get what you expect so the wise men were looking for the star when they discovered it something about they we don't know how they came to that position but they were looking for the star and they knew that something was fixing to happen and they became obsessed with this star these three wise men I don't know if they if they were together when they discovered it or if because of their Obsession they were drawn together after it amen but it was all that they thought about it was all that they talked about um there was nothing else that they were concerned with there main focus their main discussions was all about this star now we know the star was a sign and so they discussed the sign they talked about the sign they fellowshipped around about the sign and um wise men of this wise men like this stargazers whatever they were they they had many many colleagues they were respected right because they are considered smart amen human beings have a way of laboring someone as smart so therefore they know everything that they're talking about and they lift them up it's just the way of human nature so here you have these respected men but they begin to obsess over this star and they begin to because brother Bram says in that quote all these people reading time for the Stars yet only those Three Wise Men followed him so there was something that they were all missing they could see it but they could they weren't catching the revelation of it it was not exciting anything down within them and we know that as Believers there's a deep call to the Deep there's something to respond and so as it were this was their Destiny so no doubt everybody thought they were completely crazy right amen aren't you glad the world thinks you're crazy tonight the Lord so they talked about this star and then they found it they have the sign amen they found the star they had the sign now what to do what to do now we have the star we see the star we've discovered this star now what are we going to do about it maybe a new doctrine yeah yeah right now everybody says oh these PE these guys have been talking about this star for so long and it's going to come together because you know beforehand right I don't know how many of you saw on the 21st Jupiter and Saturn is pretty cool we we knew it was going to happen so the wise men knew these planets were going to come together to make this star and that's all they talked about no one else cared about it but them and then now it happened now there's proof that these guys weren't completely crazy and so now everybody's talking about this star this star wow look at this star but there was nothing compelling them I'm taking some freelance here there's nothing compelling them to follow after it so what what to do now with the star a new religion maybe not a new doctrine maybe a new religion First Church of the star Maybe Star only yeah amen it's a slide reference praise the Lord but what to do now what to do about this star about this sign well it was time for action and the Sons and Daughters of God are always on the Move that's right there's always in in action yes those if if everyone who they who the wise men Left Behind when they set out on this journey knew of the star and knew of its existence nothing compelled them into action because there was not a convincing there was not a revelation that this star held anything but a significance in the sky and yet these were learned men these were people who understood the stars and understood astrology ology and knew that you know there's a sign there's something going to happen on Earth but yet nothing compelled them to take action upon this sign except for the three wise men there was something in their heart that said we need to go find what this is all about and so they followed the star they followed the sign their focus their Obsession are you catching where I'm what I'm I are you catching what I'm throwing right they were they were after the sign that's all they thought and that's all they talked about but there was something driving them to find the reason behind the sign and there were critics there are always critics there alwayss amen if you want to get rid of critics you're going to have to wait till the Millennium if you bow to every critic there'll be a Critic for the critic and there's nowhere you can go with that there is always critics and Teddy Roosevelt had gave a speech called The Man in the arena and so felt it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of Deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valant who HS who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the Deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spend defends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the Triumph of high achievement and who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid Souls who never know VI who neither know Victory nor defeat it is not the critic who counts amen and we as children as Sons and Daughters of God as heirs to the throne as child Children of the king we are not called to simply be satisfied with the star we are not called to be simply satisfied with the with the sign that was in the heavens amen we are called to get into the arena a that you can't sit on the sidelines because as the The Story Goes about the fence the devil owns the sidelines you have to get in you're either in or you're out but you have to see the star you had to come to the star and now something had to had within you you won't be the same after that you because you go away knowing a portion of truth because the sign brings you a portion of the truth amen and so they once you see that is now your time to take action will you step into the arena amen we are called to be soldiers of the Cross to fight a bloody battle amen but God is faithful and God has given us the strength and had God has given us the calling that's the Paradox and I'm getting ahead of myself but we'll just follow the lord that's the Paradox of seeking after God because the scripture says he seeks after us and so you would that the wise men were predestinated to accept the sign of the star but to go further than everyone else to go further than the rest of their their Church to go farther than what than simply agreeing upon a sign that there was a star in the heavens that this thing happened amen those other wise men that didn't follow after the star no doubt talked about these planets that came into existence because to in our day that we live in we know which planets they were so it had to be recorded somewhere and so this they they talked about yeah there there was this s but there was nothing about it that compelled them to take action now the wise men with this Revelation that this star holds a greater truth amen they step forward on ashamed you have to be unashamed to stand among the critics and press on for God you have to be unashamed to go on a crazy Journey who knows how far to find the answer to the sign there has to be something about you that gives you the ability Amen to raise your hand in surrender you have to be unashamed of what you are called to do so there is only one thing to do for the wise men and that was to go the scoffers laughed but it is not the critic that matters they were unashamed of the truth they now possessed and there was just one thing left to do so now they're on their Journey no doubt everywhere they stopped right here's these guys I mean the the uh the the the books and the pictures portray these guys is very well ordained or whatever covered with fancy stuff fancy clothes say so they they look like men of money right according to uh pictures and whatnot I'd never have seen them with my own eyes and um so no doubt everyone's like wow you know they pass through Little Village what are these guys doing here they probably had several more camels carrying their tents and their servants and so on and so forth that was how they traveled then and they had all this you know they were going and then everyone could see their they're people of of of something and so well hey wow where are you going are you coming here where where where are you headed well we're not sure we're just following the star right oh have a nice day right listen if it was something that everyone accepted as a thing to do nobody would have cared otherwise and it wouldn't have just been those three right you're talking millions of people right right only these three men were compelled to follow the star not even the Shepherds everyone comes their own way to the truth the Shepherds were given it a different way the wise men were following the star so where are you going you know you must be on a business trip are are you going to see this so and so of high stature in the city no we're just following the star they were were seeking amen they were seeking in faith they were just following the sign they left what they knew behind them not know not knowing how long it would take I'm going through my notes fast tonight praise the Lord not knowing how long it was going to take if you're following after something like a star I've never done it maybe you have um you it if you don't if you're not told where the destination is you're just following along it's like it's like you someone says I we we'll take you to such and such a place and you never been there before say you're out of town from out of town visiting amen and sometimes it can seem like it took really long to get there and then it's really fast on the way back because you know you see signs along the way of how close you're getting to the destination but on the way there you have nothing you have no point of reference except for you're following or you're riding along with your guide so they had no point of reference No Doubt they had never been to these parts of the world but they're just following after the star that takes great faith SS of God takes great faith it takes great faith for you to sit here tonight and follow after the sign after the revelation of the truth I'm being ahead of myself behind the sign praise the Lord but they knew they would find the answer they had faith that they would find the answer they they they would not have embarked upon this great journey they would not have left their their Prestige and left their nice homes and their own cozy bed they would have never gone after this crazy adventure until unless they actually believed they would find something underneath the star they had a revelation that there was something to be seen amen they were looking for the truth behind the sign and they got the the star led into Jerusalem where we read in the scriptures that they go to Bethlehem and they found the truth behind the sign Emmanuel amen God With Us no doubt they sat with Mary and Joseph and heard the testimony of a virgin giving birth they now had met and seen the Fulfillment of scripture amen they found the reason for the sign the answer and there's one thing that happens when you come face to face for the reason behind the sign when you come face to face with the truth of what your of what you've been seeking for and that that that is that you will never be the same people that have come face to face with the sign they are never the same they go about all they can do is talk against it there's those that have come face to face with the sign and discovered the truth behind it and you can never unconvince them of it amen because why it is a revelation of Jesus Christ these wise men in their own time in their own way received a revelation of Jesus Christ now what was their testimony this is we're getting into the meat of this tonight what was their testimony was it about the star they went they followed the star they found the Messiah they left they went back home and they went on with their lives we hear nothing more of them in scripture but we know they were men and they had to talk about what they experienced so what was their testimony did they talk about the star I'm sure they mentioned it in passing but what what was the focus of their testimony what was the when they told the story as it was in those days to to to tell stories to pass on to Generations down the line what was the story they're told what was the main point was it the star the star was not the main event that's right so what was the main event what was the main point of the story of their testimony that they told after going and finding the truth behind behind the sign it was Christ they didn't they they are now possessors of the truth the sign brought them to the star was not the main event Christ was the main event so then when they went out and they told the testimony of this star that they followed they had to talk about the star because it brought them to it but what did they talk what did they go on and on and on about and what did they say oh you should have been there you should have seen it we heard this this this this and this it was all about that boy the Messiah Emmanuel the star was pushed to the side once you got to the main point of the story right it was simply what brought them to Christ amen they they they they they they followed the star and when they discovered Christ they didn't they're Obsession was no longer around the star amen their Obsession was around Christ amen Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen amen he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him what was one key ingredient that the wise men possessed they un they were unwavered you think they met obstacles in the way absolutely absolutely you think when they told their testimony there was people that didn't believe them says oh we can well we can look in the chronicles of of Jerusalem um for all the babies that were born in Bethlehem and they were all killed by Herod so there's that well no because Joseph and Mary escaped Bethlehem so there was people who came and and and and and unconvinced some of the people they testified to that's right there's people that came along with their own idea and said well you know the start didn't really happen because you know these planets they can't come together like that it doesn't happen right I don't know prove me wrong I don't think it's happened since May maybe so this isn't no that those guys were just few old few crazy old guys okay yeah no they they they had to face persecution they faced Critics on the way there and afterwards when they shared their experience and they faced obstacles you will face obstacles you will come to things that um let's be honest make you think about what you're doing with your life yeah there is never ever this you know you will never leave the truth as a true son and daughter of God do you think what's going on where am I what am I doing when they were crossing the desert and the winds were blowing 100 miles an hour what am I doing I could be back in Babylon or wherever it was taking a milk bath instead I'm in the middle of the Sahara getting blasted by sand why I I I have enough money I don't need to be out here doing this but something would stir within their heart say don't you want to know what it's all about there was something that drove you to find out what is this all about but there's one difference between people that saw the star and the wise men there's a difference between you and the people that saw the sign and just said there's a sign and they talked about a sign and tell that sign failed them right so to speak because unless you could not tell you could not tell the wise men they didn't see a messiah that's right there was you couldn't do it you you could try your best but you can't could not tell them they never saw nothing they never saw anything excuse me because they met him face face to face and the Bible says they fell on the ground and worshiped him so they knew who he was they brought gold and frankincense and myrh they knew who this young man was this young boy at the time we don't know maybe they came back years later maybe maybe news traveled up the Nile and and you know across the desert and they heard of this man named Jesus who caused a Ruckus in Jerusalem and the surrounding area and was eventually hung on the cross and then everyone claimed he rose from the dead news like that travels they probably heard of that they said we knew we met him we saw him he changed their life why because he was a manifestation of the interpretation of scripture Before Their Eyes God interprets his scripture Man by bringing it to pass he brought the scripture in Isa 7:14 to pass right before their eyes you could not tell them they had not found truth they had been Seekers of Truth and then when they came to the place of of of that interpretation they were now possessors of that truth amen footsteps is possession the Israel the children of Israel were given a Promised Land but only 12 Spies went across Jordan 10 of them couldn't believe what they saw they couldn't accept Victory but there were two that did but those two could do nothing to convince those that didn't see it with their eyes of its truths but the but Caleb and Joshua had a revelation that they could possess it so there is even some that come across Jordan so to speak in the naturally and they experience this things and they go away saying yeah but it's it's it's it's a bunch of Lies Moses said this this this this this and and we there's no way nobody can do that nobody can live that nobody can fulfill that well where is all these things that need to to come to pass and so please don't think I am coming at anyone or trying to make a defense the shamed truth needs no defense from man that's right simply relaying history because history repeats itself amen and we should be encouraged tonight by the desire we have to continue to seek for truth because you cannot seek for truth until he Our Savior Our Father our husband is seeking after us there are truths about you he is seeking out amen he is he is pulling from within you the unimaginable amen he is pulling from you the ability to say you know what I'm sorry you're right into the face of an angry person he's pulling from within you the ability to stand strong against the critics he's pulling from within you amen the truths that you didn't even know about yourself and what is oh it's amazing it's him that's right he is pulling himself out of you and when I say pulling I mean manifesting himself on the outward of you because you were called and predestinated to this position so guess what you followed the sign you followed the star you found the truth now guess what you're the sign amen right the wise men now carried the truth with them and they were out as a sign to that truth saying this is what we saw this is what we experienced amen this is what the Revelation and the interpretation of these scriptures amen now a sign sign is an object quality or event whose presence or occurrence indicates a probable presence or occurrence of something else so it just means a sign tells you of something else so even the very definition of sign does not say I you have have arrived I am it that's not even the def definition of the English word sign praise the Lord the only reason the wise men would have gone away talking about the sign okay the only reason the wise men would have left back home and just had a testimony about the star and the sign would have been they never ever met Jesus that's right you can't follow something to a place and returned not talking about that place especially when you go through what they went through the only way is if they would have gone all that way and never found anything then they would have gone away talking about the sign and all so you have people in our day that we're living in around the message around the world in denominational churches that have followed signs but never found the truth behind it that's right a they never got a revelation of the truth of the sign the sign was pointing to something they followed it they went to it but they never found truth know the truth and the truth s shall set you free without Revelation the sign is the main event that's right guess what these signs out here on the side of the road they come and go right they fulfill their purpose they're taken down the road construction ahead sign doesn't stay there when the road's finished amen it goes away and you don't go man I I can't drive down this road I don't have a sign I is there road construction up ahead how am I supposed to know there's no sign yeah just follow the road nothing against my sister growing up though I would say you know hey you know you can get to such such a place if if you just go down let go this you'll see it but where do I turn you you'll just drive down the road you'll see it no you have to tell me where I turn how many miles I have to go or which street I need to turn right on or what color the building is just go you'll see it she couldn't do that just the way her brain works but when you can follow after Christ with faith and he says hey just just take this scripture uh in Acts chap 2:38 repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you will receive the Holy Spirit well well how will I how will I How will I know what's truth and and I I believe this scripture but but how will I how will I understand the rest of it where where will I turn don't worry just drive down the road don't worry just walk down the path guess what what in the Pilgrim's Progress when when um forget his name when he came to every every uh obstacle on his journey there was signs pointing him in the right direction he didn't have to worry about figuring out every step all the way down the road and riding it all down on a big sheet of paper he just had to walk and when he came to those places you come to places in your life a scripture now means something totally different than it did before because there's a truth within there that God is bringing out to show you and point you down the road but if you have the faith and the revelation of the sign amen you can trust the truth behind it and you can trust that God is pointing you in the right direction sometimes sometimes uh praise the Lord these um man-made signs that we have these man-made maps that we have sometimes don't always take you down the right Road they get you lost they get you confused but there's one thing that's that is true about God's word is that he will always steer you straight any confusion your you are experiencing is because somehow you mixed something with your Humanity right you said this is impossible or I don't understand it God doesn't need your understanding that's right God will show you in due time if you'll still stay faithful and just keep following the star I don't know how long their Journey take but let's say it was it was a couple of years because we know he was about two years old when they found him do you think about 9 months in they were like man are we ever going to get to the place where the star actually is where the star is pointing us to how do I stay this when when your six okay five do we have how many senses do we have five five thank you when your five senses tell you you need to give up or this isn't possible you have to tap into Faith amen and faith comes by Revelation that's the six sense thank you that's why I was thinking we had six senses praise God brother Chris can't count that's all right um praise the Lord so they saw the Fulfillment of the scripture therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel they saw the interpretation of scripture they had faith that they would find that the truth of that sign now the Paradox like I said is this scripture for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which is which was lost he he doesn't even say is lost he says was why because you were found before the Virgin ever heard the message from the angel you were found before the foundation of the world but God had to come and fulfill scripture in your life in the day and age that he called you to be in as a child of God forever seek truth you can seek truth in reading your Bible you can seek truth in listening to the message you can seek truth in prayer you need all three of those things actually to seek truth but you must never stop amen the children of Israel stopped they got to a very big obstacle the the the amalaki or the jebusites and all them Jericho all those the Giants in the promised land they got to an obstacle and they stop seeking truth and they they all died in the wilderness but Joshua and Caleb they were ten Tena tenacious Seekers they sought truth they they they they defended truth they they stepped out from the promised land and to the children of Israel they said it doesn't matter what these guys say trust me this is exactly what God said it would be it is the Fulfillment of what we have heard amen so be a tenacious Seeker know the truth for the truth shall set you free that's now guess what there's one ingredient the world the world in the secular world there's a saying you know always ask the question why you know don't be confined to a bathtub the problem with their ideology is it's partially true amen always ask why all press and find the answers to what is in your heart but guess what sometimes the answer is wait amen that's when you don't understand something about the scriptures or about the message the answer is not turn aside and go look somewhere else I can tell you right now there is no other truth outside of the word of God what happens when you come to something you do not understand see what happens is people focus on that that's all they think about and they're consumed with this question and they think because of this one question all the other truths surrounding that must be false well they don't even know the answer to it yet but because they don't know the answer you know there must not be an answer and the rest of it must not be true but if you'll stay the course God will show you the children of Israel uh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego did not discover the truth until they stepped into the fire right they had to first first step in by faith into the very thing their five senses said said do not do you will die but once they stepped into the fire they had a shouting Jubilee yeah they come out not even smelling like smoke sometimes you're standing there on the edge wondering should I step into the fire the word of God says the Holy Ghost is a con all consuming fire amen the devil's saying you don't want to go in there you'll die he's right right you will die you'll dial to yourself you have to surrender because that those three boys were fully surrendered to God in order to step into that fire you have to be willing to say God I don't understand why but I know you won't fail me amen so if I perish I perish but I'm going to see the king if you perish you perish but step into that fire and find out for yourself because once you do you could not tell Shadrach Meek and Abednego that uh they survived the fire they didn't survived the fire you couldn't tell them that you couldn't tell them they didn't come face to face with god with Jehovah in that fire you couldn't tell them because they saw it for themselves they saw it with their physical eyes the wise men saw with their physical eyes but you see it with the eyes of faith and the Bible says that is a greater Miracle when you see the truth for yourself Through The Eyes of Faith you you have accepted Jesus Christ and that's what it means to know him personally amen I know I'm probably preaching to the choir tonight that's good maybe you need to be a reminder praise Lord you are an unashamed possessor of Truth start talking past tense like that scripture said right you are a woman of Faith you are a man of Faith you do possess the gates of your enemy you have overcome the world you have overcome death say I'm sitting here in the pew doesn't matter the truth lays within you and that truth before you were ever born overcame death for you you have the ability to stand because you have come face to face with Revelation but guess what if you haven't maybe you're the wise man and he's only a year end you're only a year end to your two-year journey I have one thing for you don't leave church don't stop reading your Bible don't stop praying even if you're not hearing anything I have friends who said it's not true nothing happened but if they would have just kept on knocking that's right you're not a hypocrite if you sit in church and you don't believe amen you're not a hypocrite keep on seeking the truth admit admit you need so you're not a hypocrite if you're honest with yourself that you don't understand what's going on it's not pretending this is the best place for you if you're confused this is the best place for you if you have doubt we're not telling you to leave because you don't believe we're telling you to stay because God will reveal himself to you guess what this in this place there's no noise in this place there's no con there's no other other voices that's right physically there is the Devil comes to church too in this place there is a combined power of Jesus Christ because of those around you that have accepted the truth amen you don't have your fire lit that's okay there's fire here keep on coming because God will reveal himself to you he promised he would right and I'm standing here as a testimony just like the wise men that I have come face to face face with Jesus Christ and if he can do it for me he can do it for you the worst thing you can do is stop coming to church praise the Lord how okay so how could they talk about anything else besides the truth they discovered how can you we can't stop talking about it amen the truth that we have discovered praise the Lord know the truth and the truth shall set you free amen the musicians will come tonight praise the Lord it was a little bit shorter than normal but have you ever read the book of Romans yeah there's a sermon in every verse that's right I read through that book not quite once a month but very often because there is so much in there so one thing tonight to remember you are an unashamed possessor of Truth be a you are a tenacious Seeker un tenacious is I've saying that wrong I know unwavered you you you're un you say well I I Stumble go read Hebrews 11 tonight then go back and read the stories of all those people in that chapter and it's full of their mistakes but in that chapter when the Holy Ghost through the pen of Paul testifies of their life what does it say by faith Abraham by faith Noah it's a positive confession because what God doesn't look at your Humanity if he did no one would be saved but God looks at the testimony of the truth that is within your heart that's what he cares about cuz guess what you say how can he how can he rely his how can he base his his understanding of me off of my the truth in my heart though the outward would betray that sometimes because he knows if that truth is in your heart the outward will come right into line with that truth in your heart and he doesn't have to worry about it it's like somebody say you say say you you see somebody they got a broken down car but you know they have $100,000 sitting in the bank account you don't worry about them they've got the money they need to repurchase a new car if they so desire God doesn't worry what the outside you looks like because the truth within you amen will change the outside God doesn't worry about your negative confession because he knows a positive confession of the word into you will bring forth the right words from your mouth amen God looks at the desires of your heart thank the Lord for that thank the Lord that's God's Almighty Grace amen so when you hear about people and and everything and I I'm not trying to bring this up to be the dead horse but this is just the world we live in this is is what's happening around us and so we speak about what's relevant if you hearing voices that are contrary to what you're hearing here or to what you're hearing in the scriptures or what you're hearing from the message just look at their lives amen does their life testify truth amen do do do does what they talk about does what they they is there approach line up with the word of God and that's easy to find just go read a story or about the men of faith in the Bible and ask yourself do they line up with that praise the Lord I don't that was that was free that just came out of nowhere praise the Lord amen I feel like I'm repeating myself having a hard time stopping here maybe you get youall are [Music] pulling maybe of course you are praise the Lord amen I'm looking forward to one of these days not even having to worry about all this stuff just go walk the streets of gold do do you know that that's a reality there's a theory that we're all in the simulation and it's not really reality and uh you know what's funny about that is uh you kind of are a simulation of Christ and the rest of the world is is in reality this is not reality brother B says this is a negative of the real photo this is this is not it was in the mind of God yes God knew this was going to happen but this is not how God intended it to be but he's pulling he he's he sent you down and he has faith that you'll manifest his word and that you'll come but but the true reality is the other side a perfect uh I don't know uh most of you here have been out in the woods imagine the most beautiful place you've ever been and then times that by an Infinity number it's that much better on the other side I've had the privilege of being in some pretty remote places back home and you look and you you cannot see the touch of man anywhere and it it stir you up to think you're going to a place that is not been touched by Humanity but is 100% pure amen and you don't have to fight thoughts too toothaches headaches migraines frustration computer's not working you won't need them praise the Lord that is going to be a reality one day and I and I I pray that if you can hold on to one thing to tonight if if if you're a let's bow our heads if you're if you're a young person or an old person and there's questions that you are stumbling with if you can hold on to one reality and that is that God is preparing a place for you amen and he has faith in you that you will overcome the world sometimes do you know sometimes what you have is what you what you need is already within you sometimes you just have to convince yourself of it so start confessing positive I am a daughter of God I am a Son of God I am an overcomer stop confessing that many times the devil convinces you that you're still Bound by a spirit when actually God has set you free but your abil inability to accept that Deliverance is causing you to stumble remember fear is a liar anything that tells you contrary to the word of God is a lie but God has said you are able you are faithful you are an unashamed possessor of the truth you see unashamed I I can't even pray in public doesn't matter within you is the ability to stand unashamed for God dear Lord Jesus what a chopped up thing tonight Lord I pray none of my own words came out my own opinions but Lord it was completely entirely you you had something to say tonight and Lord we can say oh maybe it was a simple sermon but that's that doesn't matter if it's simple or if it's complex or if it's high or if it's low all that matters is that your words were spoken tonight Lord I trust and I have faith that Lord that was so delivered to your people I pray Lord the hearts that were touched I I don't know I may never know Lord but father you know and that's all that matters I don't get up here to minister for my own Glory I get up here Lord because you have called me to and you have given something upon my heart to speak and not my ideas I didn't come up with this I didn't come up with with any of these thoughts it was you Lord and father you had something to say so there's somebody here tonight in the building somebody streaming online somebody who's going to watch this later on father who you needed to speak to because God you orchestrate all things according to your time so now with Faith Lord with faith in your ability to bring us to Perfection with your with faith in your ability to speak to us though we fumble in words through the foolishness of preaching as Paul says L we have faith that Lord you will take what has been said and bury it deep into our hearts into My Heart Lord Into the Heart of my brothers and sisters here tonight father that we are of something greater than the world has to offer we are of something greater than our parents told us we were we are of something greater than the world tells us we are father because God you have put within us the sea Gene of God that will not maybe not might will fulfill fill all things for the glory of God lord like the wise men are crossing the desert Lord going through the trials and the tribulations to find the truth to discover the truth father I pray Lord those here tonight that have not yet come face to face with Christ would not turn back to the leaks and the garlics of Egypt would not turn back lord to to the Fine Things of Babylon but father would press across the desert knowing Lord that you will provide them the truth that they need to become a manifestation of you and therefore become a sign to this generation I don't care how old they are time in the message has shown us it doesn't matter how old you are father I just pray that you would just touch each one Lord oh God we we're longing we we fight with Faith Lord we fight longing to hear you say Well done my good and faithful servant you have fought the good fight we long to to to be in those places father to to be in glory with you we have a burning desire in our heart but Lord though we desire to rest we stand with our sword drawn knowing that time has not come yet father may we
