Wanted to remind everyone there'll be communion tonight at 5:00 back here. We'll look forward to seeing you then. Amen. Um have another song here that I think we've sang it before. I put it in there. [music] It's God Will Make a Way, but it's different version than what we normally sing. So it's 1095 just a little chorus. God will make a way when there [singing] seems [music] to be no way forever. He is [singing] faithful. He will [singing] make a road when you bear a heavy load. I know God will make a way. You sing [music] that with me. God will make a way [singing] when there [music] seems to be no way forever. He [singing and music] is faithful. He will make [singing] a road when you bear a heavy load. I know God will make a way. God will make a way. [singing] [snorts] when there seems [music] to be no way. [singing] Forever he [music and singing] is faithful. He will [singing] make a road when you bear a heavy load. I know God will make a way. Amen. Just felt to sing that this morning. Amen. [music] In his time. I didn't I didn't plan this, but I just noticed a lot of the a lot of the uh songs I wrote state forever. He is faithful. He is faithful. He [music] is faithful. You believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just believe. Amen. [snorts] In his time. [music] [snorts] In his time. He [singing and music] makes all things beautiful in his time. [music] Lord, please show me every day as you're [music and singing] teaching me your way that you'll do [music and singing] just what you say in [singing and music] your time. In his time, in [singing and music] his time, he [music and singing] makes all things beautiful in his time. Lord, to my life to you I bring. [singing and music] May each song I have to sing be [music and singing] to you a lovely thing in his time. Let's sing that part again. [music] Let's stand. Amen. In his time.

In your time. In your time. He [singing and music] makes all things beautiful in your time. Lord, my life to you I bring. May each song I have to sing be [music] to you a lovely thing. [snorts] in your time. [music] Amen. As we get ready to change order of the service this morning, number 890. Let's just give it all to him this morning. Amen. And I was thinking about our brother Paul's sermon on Wednesday night. And one of the things that [music] I'd been praying about and thinking on was just worshiping him unreservedly. Amen. [music] Can we just get everything out of the way this morning? Let everything, let every thought of this world, every ache, every pain, whatever it would be, forget about it and [music] think about our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. committed to him and [music] trust in him. Amen. Lord, my heart can grow so [music] far away and [singing] cold. And yet for me, your love is still [music] the same. Lord, I bend my knee [music and singing] in awe and fear of [music] thee. My heart bowed [singing] down in reence to your name. Lord, I lift your [music] [singing] name. your holy name. [music] Jehovah God elimin. [singing] You're the great I am [singing] the [music] risen lamb. my comforter [music] [singing] and king. Lord, my heart's desire [music] be filled with the spirit [singing] fire. My purpose [music] is to worship you alone. [singing] [music] Oh, open [music] up my [singing] soul to worship and adore. [music] Be a fragrance offer [music] to your throne. [music] Lord, I [singing] lift your name, your holy [singing and music] name. Jehovah God, [music] [singing] you're the great I am the risen [music] lamb, my [singing] comfort [music] and [singing] King. [music] Lord, I lift your [singing] name. Your holy name. [music] Hova God. [singing] Elimin [music] great. I am the [music and singing] rising lamb, my comfort [music] and king. Oh Lord, I [music] lift your [singing] name. Oh you [music] God him [music] the great I am a risen lamb my comforter and King, can we just live a little praise to the Lord this morning? Oh, how we love you, Lord. How gracious you are to us, Lord. Your loving kindness. Oh my. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes. So the uprising in Tanzania, the saints there are sharing that it's just &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; um so much violence that they can barely even go out in the streets. But yet, you know, the pull of being in the house of God has caused many of the believers to venture out today [music] and to be in the house of God. So let's let's remember them. Amen. And uh as been announced, communion this afternoon at 5. Brother Rich uh sends his warmest greetings from him [music] and his family and the saints in Monmouth just to greet each and every one of you and uh had a wonderful conversation with brother Dwayne Fair [music] and uh he sends greetings from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. And uh as hard as I I could [music] to to convince him he had to come here. for everything I offered, he seemed to have a something that well, not now. Not now. And I couldn't really push back too hard because I've used that so many times. Not now. But just remember the saints in Monmouth, remember the saints in Saskatoon. and uh just had I don't want to speak out of turn but just had some lovely conversations with uh I don't know depending on how you know them as brother Junior, brother Eagle and uh uh brother Job both of them feeling very much God dealing with them and [snorts] uh they've started a Bible study [music] and uh more and more people are coming. They've got some young people that are are just friends [music] that are coming in and uh interacting with them and uh so we just want to lift them up in prayer. [music] Amen. That uh you know God put something burning in the heart of the youth. Amen. Remember it was the youth that crossed over and possessed the land. Amen. So we want to remember them in prayer. [music] And uh Sister Jerry and I will be leaving in uh a little less than two weeks [music] to go to the Netherlands and to Belgium for meetings there. So we just desire your [music] your prayers. Amen. God bless you, brother. Good to have you with us. Amen. [music] And u each and everyone. There's some young men here that I I you know I had I hadn't seen them in so long. I just was like, who are they? Oh, sorry about that. [music] It's so good to see you guys. Amen. Brother Daniel, God bless you. And [snorts] uh each and every one of you. Uh [music] just happy to see you today. Uh brother Manasse, Sister Katie, good to see you. Amen. [music] Before we go to the word, just turn one another and greet each other. Sister Carrie, I I was one of those uh that was like starting to miss you. Amen. Yeah. I was just like thinking, I'll see her soon. I'll see her soon. God bless you. Amen. Praise the Lord. Yeah. Amen. Now, this is very special to me this morning, saints, because uh what the Lord laid on brother Isaac's heart to sing fits so perfectly with [snorts] what um I'm going to speak today. And the title of my sermon today, if thou canst believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Only believe. Amen. And here we are. If thou canst believe. Amen. We want to take this out of Mark the 9th chapter. We are all very familiar with this scripture. Mark 9:16- 24. Uh and uh you know it is there that um I I trust this morning you will understand the way that I desire to bring this to you. uh is that we must sometimes come to the reality that each and every one of us has a circumstance something that arises in our life that just buffets us. We we just feel like we have just been rocked onto our heels and and u it it is not uh well I'll wait I'll just preach the sermon to you instead of preaching it twice. Amen. Amen. Mark 9:16. And he asks the scribes, "What question ye of them?" So when they come back off the mountain, just give context to it. Uh they they see the scribes questioning or contesting with the disciples. And Jesus said, "Ask the scribes, what question ye with them?" And I love how this that God did not let this turn into some theological debate. But one steps out of the crowd. And one of the multitude answered, said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit, and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him, and he foamth, and nashethth with his teeth, and pineth away, which means to become rigid or or or stiff. And I spake to thy disciples, and that they should cast him out, and they could not. He answered him and said, "Oh faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me." And they brought him unto him. And when he saw him, straight away the spirit tear him. Now, isn't this the truth, my brother and sister? Every time God comes and and I just want to speak in a broad context here. Every time God comes and starts to deal with us, the devil shows up and tries to tear up the situation. He does not want you and I to ever get stabilized that this is the word. This is the truth and and we're going to hold on to this and this. No, he always comes throw something out there and it's there. Now, I tell you, this is a lousy analogy, but I thought it was interesting that recently in a police chase, the the police trying to stop this car. And [snorts] uh so they don't want to get run over on the freeway. So, as cars are passing by, they throw the spikes out there for the to try and get that car. They miss that car, but the other seven or eight cars that were going down the freeway innocently all now have flat tires. Now, that's the devil. He is constantly throwing things out in our way, trying to flatten our tires to stop our progress. Amen. So, here's what happened as Jesus starts to deal with this. [snorts] Amen. He throws a fit on this young man to break up the moving of the spirit. Amen. So there away, and they brought him unto him, and when he saw him, straight away the spirit tear him, and he fell to the ground, and wallowed foaming. And he asked [snorts] his father, "How long is it ago since he came upon him?" And he said, "Of a child, and often times has cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if thou can't do anything, have compassion on us and help us." Jesus saith unto him, "If thou canst believe," &gt;&gt; can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears, "Oh my, this moves me, saints,"Lord, I believe, &gt;&gt; but help &gt;&gt; my unbelief." &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, we ask for your blessings upon the reading of the word. Lord, this time, this thought that you have laid upon my heart, Lord, help me to express it. Touch the saints, bless the saints today, Lord, lead us and guide us. We ask in your precious name. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Though, as we look at this story, it is with much interest that I see this this story, how that it comes to pass and how that uh God coming here knowing exactly what this situation is. And you know what caught me? I'll just give a moment of explanation. Uh I was reading a scripture the other day and I was found it remarkable uh of how many scriptures there are. Something like for over 1,400 times in the scripture the word if is used. Now, not all in the same context, but would you look at that, my brother and sister? The word if signifies a condition in a sentence, often linking a human action or state to a divine promise. So, we see all through the scriptures if if if and behind that is if you can believe, amen, all things are possible. If you can take these things and and look, I encourage you, go look it up. It's a very interesting study, when you realize that this is in a context that God is then saying, if you will stand for the word, I'll bless you, Israel. If you'll be faithful to me, I'll bless you as a nation. Now, not all those were believers in there, but because Israel stood for the word, he blessed the nation. And you see we stand here today and we'll look at this and I I just want you to see the condition in your own life that if we will believe if we will stand on the word if we can uh be remain hot. Now look at this. Oh I didn't see brother Gideon and sister Lily. God bless you. Trust that sister Lily's feeling better. Been praying for you. Amen. But look at this how that this is taking place because God is puts many promises in a conditional basis. And so when we enter into the promise and we we act upon that God comes. Now I I think it's so powerful how that he said if thou can't believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now my brother and sister, we're preaching to believers today. We're preaching to the bride of Jesus Christ today. God placed something in you. Not not of your own mind, not of your own will, not of your own nobility, but he placed something in you that you can believe. Amen. And so, it's not a matter of if we can, but it's us getting all of the distraction out of our life, getting all of the litter, the clutter, all of the noise, and just simply come to the place we believe. Amen. There's so much distraction in the day that we live in, my brother and sister. It is a time that we live. They did some recent studies. Uh when I say recent, that's within, you know, a reasonable time. I don't remember the date, but here is here is a uh they did these studies and and young people uh have such a tremendous amount of time and they kind of lump things together how they're caught up in electronics. So whether it's television, their phones, and whatever. And so what's happening is they're they're pulling them from a reality to something that's there. You know, I always thought it was interesting many many years ago when the soap opera first appeared on television. They actually come to the conclusion that people were addicted to them. Amen. And I knew people grown men that actually would leave the farmwork for an hour to go watch as the world turns. Well, all you got to do is get up in the morning when the sun is rising, walk out your door and look around you, and you will see the world turning. Amen. But if you don't see God in the world turning, then you're seeing a soap opera. And Satan would desire for us to live in a sort of a fantasy realm of what it is. And the fantasy realm come down into the church and left people where they could claim to be a Christian. They could stand on these things. They can quote scripture, but my brother and sister, they're literally living in a fantasy world. And even in this stage right now, people are starting to discover that uh there's there's a dysfunction or disconnect that many people are adopting the name Christian but not changing their lifestyle. Now my brother and sister, we cannot be a Christian without our lifestyle changing. If there is no change in our life, Amen. We have not had a true experience. Amen. You can have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof, but we're here for the power of God to move in our life. Can we say amen to that? We want the power of God to change us. Now, change can be painful. Amen. Change can be disruptive. P, you know, there's a pain that comes when your life cycle as it is is changed around you and you must adapt to that. Amen. I heard one time a man made a quotation. He says, "Oh, being a Christian is like going to prison." Well, I'll tell you what. The Apostle Paul went to prison and was still a Christian. Amen. He didn't feel bound when he was in there. God used that time to speak to him. And so, if people have the idea that being a Christian is like going to prison, my brother and sister, they'll never go. &gt;&gt; They'll never be a part of that. &gt;&gt; So, you look at this. Amen. I say the same action is required today as Jesus spoke to this father about his situation. Amen. He says if thou can't believe that is the same thing is required today. We cannot sit here now if you don't mind me speaking a little direct this morning. You can quote the prophet all you want. You can just talk about how the message is so important to you. But if it doesn't have any effect, then we are just simply quoting. And anyone can say they are anything. Look at it today, my brother and sister. The boys are saying they're girls and the girls are saying the boys and schools are changing and literally creating rooms so kids can say that they are an animal. My brother and sister, well, that's a nature that is uh coming down upon the people that an anointing is coming there and they're going back to that old beast nature. And you're just seeing the little surface of it when a kid says he's an animal. Amen. That's just Satan just presenting a picture that's just there and it's so cute. Oh, my child thinks she's a cat. Oh, my kid thinks he's a dog. Oh, my kid thinks he's a horse. My brother and sister, it's a changing of a nature. It's a changing of an attitude, a spirit that's coming in. And that's just opening a door. Amen. Look how many times the prophet of God talks about how Satan likes to just open a door. And it may be years before he actually comes and anoints that, but he's got the door open. My brother and sister, you might as well leave your house unlocked and put a sign on the street. Please rob me. Amen. But that's what Satan's doing. When he can come, when he desires, he will come at the most inopportune time for your life. &gt;&gt; But the door is open. &gt;&gt; He's got access. And who gave it to him? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do we know who gave him the access? &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not serving God because of my pastor today. Your pastor didn't give access for the Satan to torment you. &gt;&gt; You had to unlock that door. &gt;&gt; Amen. And vice versa. Amen. pastors that say, "I'm going to quit the message because of the people." My brother and sister, they've left a door open somewhere because the people will never push or draw or interfere in the life of a real believer. People can't do that. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost guarding the door, people and spirits cannot get past that to cause that disruption. So, what happens is if we're not careful, we are just like this man here. And we come to a place that we know it's the truth. But you see, I I hope this isn't too big a step, but this is here because I'm bringing it down. I'm not preaching a historical message this morning. I'm preaching to saints as sons and daughters of God here this morning. So, don't let this be too big a step for you. But you know what? We need to come and we need to to admit, we need to come to a place that we would admit that at times it's hard to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if it seems like I'm backing up from what we believe, no, don't misunderstand me. It's not that it's hard to believe the Bible. It's not hard to believe the message, &gt;&gt; although some struggle with these things, but of little things. Why would God let this circumstance come into my life? Why would I be facing this challenge at this time? Why would God allow this? if God really loved me. And I used to think this was a young people's thing that they would come in a point in their life, you know, they're they're they're starting to establish themselves and and they're starting to, you know, kind of set their own boundaries and and be like, well, if God really loved me, but my brother and sister, we're starting to encounter people 40, 50, 60 years old that have not come to this solid conclusion of who they are in Jesus Christ. and they're wavering, being pushed around by spirits of the day and and the distractions of the day. And you know, I've spoke on this before. It's not always a blessing when God gives you a promotion. It's not always a blessing when you meet a new friend that just seems to click with you. It's not always a blessing when we come into these circumstances. We have to be here to judge the circumstance by the word. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I tell you, there's many a friend that has led a young man or young woman astray because they thought they were so and they convinced them. I could name names and you would recognize some of them. Amen. But my brother and sister, it's not about the individual, but it's about a spirit of the age and how it would come. So there's times that we just find. Let's be honest with ourselves. There's times it's hard to believe where we're at. One of the young young people's challenge of this day is that they can recognize that they are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; There's there's a challenge because the world's so beautiful out here. There is so much that's being offered and it comes so easy and it seems so free. But my brother and sister, the real truth of it is there behind the scene that you don't see is a spiritual warfare for your soul. Amen. Satan wants to. And that's why the scripture says, "Train up a child." No, that's not training them to quote scripture and quote quotes and dress just right, but train them up in the realm that they know that God is God and they are sons and daughters of God. And in that being established in a young age, they will be able to hold on to that as they progress in their life. Now, that doesn't mean that sitting in the house of God in the in the pew will not [snorts] come a time that they won't have questions and they won't be shaken to their very roots of of what is going on in their life. But my brother and sister, sometimes circumstance, anybody ever run into a circumstance that really shook you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll lift my hand for you. You all are just kind of tame this morning. Amen. Amen. Every one of you will face a circumstance because the word says you should rejoice when you come into fiery trials. Amen. When you come into that, so there's not going to be a time that you get to pass through without facing a fiery trial or a proving ground. But God bringing you to this place that he says, you know what? No matter what the circumstance, &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what the circumstance, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; you're going to still believe. &gt;&gt; That's what God is doing. That's right. &gt;&gt; But we have to understand this human element. And I hope you're following me this morning. In this human element, we have times that we struggle with certain things in our life. Maybe it's a little habit. Maybe it's a little just a little seemingly almost nothing circumstance, but yet it has an influence. Little things, circumstances. I say this morning, the Lord just really dealt with me as I was studying this out. Amen. I think it's time to be loosed of the things which hinder us and a time for us to stand up and declare, "Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Help my unbelief." &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever would come that would be my distraction, be my thing. But help me, Lord, cuz I do believe this word. I believe you're a risen savior. I believe you are the lamb of God. I believe all of these things. I believe your word is coming to pass. But there's times that I get in the way and Satan bombards me and I leave the door open just enough. &gt;&gt; See, the disciples had just been up. If you don't mind, I just feel a little dry here. If you don't mind me, excuse me. The disciples have just seen a supernatural event take place. They've been up on the mountain. They've watched Jesus and they've got to see Elijah and Moses and the whole conversation. Their conclusion is we need to build three temples. Amen. But my brother and sister, it's there that as this supernatural event takes place, just like I've already shared with you, as they come down the mountain, the scribes are there to argue the scripture with him. And so this supernatural event, which they did not totally understand, is now diverted away. And now they're in an argument. Is the message true or not? Amen. That's what that's what the argument of our day is. Right? There's a lot of voices out there that says it's not even true. It's false. It's empty. Well, I'm here to stand. Amen. At 63 years old and God dealing with me my whole life, even when I wasn't serving him, I can stand here and I don't know that I really qualify in your mind as a witness. But I can witness, my brother and sister, that God has been faithful to me all the days of my life. Even when I didn't serve him, even when I was distracted, even when these things come, he's healed my body. He's delivered me from my circumstances. He's kept me from the threshold of death. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you what, my brothers and sisters, you don't really know who I am. I'm sorry to tell you that here was a young man that got so wild in his teenage years. We used to take me and several several guys, some had pickups, some had sports cars and what and we used to see how fast we could drive up the road to Bogus Basin. And there was a time in my life because I was going to catch the car in front of me that I rounded a corner there and lost traction and went all the way over to the edge where the rear tires were over the edge spinning gravel and then I'm on the road again. Now, there's people died on that curve, my brother and sister. This is not just some random thing. There's no guard rail and it's not a random thing. And it got a hold of me for a little bit. &gt;&gt; But I didn't really give God liberty to do that. But I'll tell you what it did do. It anchored itself in the back of my mind in my life that I probably should be dead. &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you come down the road and there's times that pass by and days that pass by, weeks, months, years, and you come, but God anchored that to show me that I should be dead, but he lives in me and he wasn't finished with the work. Now my brother and sister, that kind of thing is very personal. It might not affect you like it affects me, but I tell you, I get emotional thinking about it even to this day to know that I come within that whisker of death. And it is a long ways. I could drive you right up and show you the corner. It's a very, very long ways down to the bottom of that ravine. And it's there that God come and he said, "I'm not going to let you even wreck. I'm going to save you before your life crashes." &gt;&gt; Can someone relate to that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're moving along here and the disciples have seen this supernatural event and out of the crowd, we're not going to even deal with the argument. We're dealing with life here, not those naysayers that are coming and saying, you know, the message is not true. We have this discrepancy. We have that discrepancy. Well, let me just throw one last little thing out. I believe every human and especially everyone right here, but everyone around it, if we followed you every day and recorded your public words, we would find discrepancy. [snorts] But those that are perfect, Amen, they want to be the critic. Well, they're perfect in their own mind. But you see, God has allowed our human element &gt;&gt; to still be here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses was without a doubt God's prophet. Had a human element. And we come right down through the ages. I can assure you, the Apostle Paul, Amen, as God's apostle establishing the word had a human element that if you wanted to be critical, you would find it. But you see, God's not dealing on the human side. So, I don't know why I'm saying this, but I just want to assert this. You can look at Brother Brandham's life and you can find things wrong with him. But my brother and sister, the God who is speaking through him has no fault, no failure, no shortcoming. So, we're not looking at the man, we're looking at the God. Amen. And so, as we look at the God, I want to ask you, has God ever failed you? &gt;&gt; Can God fail you? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it's there. You see, the distraction is to get your eyes to the man. Now, let me just continue this thought for just a moment. We can sit right here in church. Amen. And we can look around us and and I hope this spirit isn't here, but we can look around us and we can find fault. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With those in the church, &gt;&gt; somebody [snorts] ought to be able to lift a hand and say, "Amen." Yes, we can find fault. We'll start with you, Brother Paul. But from the oldest to the youngest, we can find that fault. And if we're looking for the fault, we'll find the fault. If you're looking for sons and daughters of God filled with the Holy Ghost, you are going to see sons and daughters of God filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. And if you look for the word fulfilled, you will see the word fulfilled. If you're looking for lives that are changed, you will see lives being changed. If you're looking for the right thing, you will find it. But if you're looking to the negative, you will find it. &gt;&gt; So it really doesn't come down to who's this and who's that and who did what. It's coming down to what you choose to focus on. [snorts] &gt;&gt; This man brings his son and the truth is uh he's vexed with the devil. &gt;&gt; But don't I love this. Do you see Jesus rebuke the man? Now, see, this is why I brought up how you view it. If thou can't believe, &gt;&gt; some would take it as a rebuke. He called me a buzzard. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. He called me an eagle. &gt;&gt; Amen. It all depends on who you take it. It says, "If thou can't believe, &gt;&gt; implying that he's not believing, but in such a way, the man receives that it discerns his heart." Let me say he's sitting here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's sitting here this morning. Don't look it as some historical thing. He's sitting here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord Jesus coming down discerning the heart. Now, this father receives this. He doesn't say, "Well, if he's going to look at me like an unbeliever, I'm out of here." No, he looks at that and says, "I am a believer. &gt;&gt; I believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, help my unbelief. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because every one of us is impacted by the spirits of the age. &gt;&gt; It's there. It's real. Now look, my brother and sister is the father. No doubt as Jesus is discerning this spirit, his his inner spirit. No doubt he's discouraged from years. His son from a child has been afflicted with this with this affliction. And no doubt he he's a little discouraged about that, you know, wondering is God really a healer. Amen. But Jesus doesn't rebuke him. Aren't you glad? Amen. I preach this about being built up. This is what God's doing. He's starting on a foundation. He's building us up. My brother and sister, when we make a mistake, Amen. God might tell you to to, you know, take a sawsaw and start cutting the studs out because you didn't frame them in the right pattern. They need to be different. He might cause you to have to go backwards in your life for a little bit so you can deal with issues that you skipped over because they were painful. &gt;&gt; But God will take you back to that place and he will build you back up. So here is this here is this father, amen, in this discouragement. And so Jesus doesn't rebuke him, but what he does do is he starts removing the barriers in this father's life. So there's a little hesitancy in his life about his son's healing. This is a little question mark in his life. Why, Lord? Come on, saints. You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Why, Lord? Why are my children not serving God? &gt;&gt; Why is a husband or a wife or someone very dear to us? Why why are they not overcoming? &gt;&gt; Why, Lord? But you see what Jesus does is he doesn't come and rebuke him. He starts to remove the barrier. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, feel free to speak out if you'd like to. What was the moment of him removing that barrier in his life? Was it the fact that he was in the presence of Jesus Christ? Many people were in his presence, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That didn't remove the barrier. &gt;&gt; Just like Acts 2:38, what starts it? Our confession, &gt;&gt; repent. The father then says,"Lord, I believe." So he's declaring his heart, "I believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And then his confession is, "Lord, help my unbelief." &gt;&gt; So the man lost all of his pious approach, all of his sanctimonious, righteous, self-righteousness, and he just admits right out in public. That's not a private conversation. and admits in public, Lord, help my unbelief. Amen. Who would like to be that person this morning? Father, Lord, I am a believer. I believe this word, but Lord, help my unbelief. Help me what hinders me from moving forward. Help me to deal with the things, Father, that seem to so easily beset me. Amen. Help me with this things, Father. little to besetting sin. A little attitude, a little spirit, a little bit of pride, a little bit of whatever it might be. Maybe a little resentment from something that happened years ago. &gt;&gt; See, the devil's here even in the microphone today. So, what does he do instead? He removes the barrier by the word. &gt;&gt; He doesn't remove it by chastising him. He gives him the word. And because he had a seed in him, he recognized the truth of the word and received it on good ground. He took that word and took it in and said, "Lord, I I believe, but I recognize there's things in my life that I'm not holding to." Amen. If I can be so blunt this morning. Our Lord Jesus Christ said in Mark that he healed you. Amen. What is it Satan coming to do? We get prayed for. We come, oh man, I thought I was healed. But my brother and sister, just as the story goes, that man comes back to brother Brandham and he says, you know, brother Brandham, you said I was healed. Brother Brandham doesn't coddle him. He says, you said you believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is hindering you? Because the symptom didn't disappear according to your plan. your agenda, your desire, but God says, "I healed you. Now, it's up to you to believe you're healed in the name of Jesus Christ." Amen. And many things that we want out of our lives. Amen. We could go through it. I'll just throw a blanket out there. Don't take it personal. The lust of the flesh, the pride of life, all of these things. And if we don't deal with them, you can hear all the word that you can hear. You can hear the word seven days a week constantly. And if those things are still there, that is unbelief manifested to hinder you. God, help us. &gt;&gt; God, help us to acknowledge, I believe, Lord, help my unbelief. Help me deal with what is hindering my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus just starts removing barrier. We see the father's response. Amen. [snorts] The word reached the right place in his life. It touched him in the right place. And he right there in public just says, "Lord, help my unbelief. I I'm an unbeliever." Isn't this the paradox, right? Amen. A little bit of the foundation of a two soul doctrine, you know? [snorts] Oh, when I would do good, that's when I'm in the Lord. But I'm over here in the flesh and my flesh gets to do this. Well, I'll tell you what, the flesh will obey the truth that's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to make an excuse. I I I wrote a note this morning connected to this and I don't know when it'll happen, but you know what? Time to set aside our excuses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; You give an excuse for why you behave or why this affected you or why what's going on. It's time for us to set aside our excuses. We have a pure word in this hour. We got a word that delivers. We got a word that heals. We got a word that sets people free. Amen. We don't need an excuse. We need the word. and give liberty to the word to change our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the word reaches the right place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his first declaration is I love the order of this. God sets things in order. He doesn't say, "Well, I'm a believer, but I'm believing." &gt;&gt; No, he says, "I am a believer." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; I am a believer. That's the first place in my life. I am a believer. &gt;&gt; I'm not focusing on my unbelief. Oh, I might have sinned. I might have done something, you know. I might have yesterday or the day before or a week before done something that would not be pleasing in the eyes of the Lord. But that's not the first and foremost thought on his mind. What's on his mind is I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I have some unbelief still residing in me. &gt;&gt; Cleanse me, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; and I will be clean. Wash me and I will &gt;&gt; be washed. &gt;&gt; You see my brother and sister, &gt;&gt; what's the first and foremost in your vocabulary? &gt;&gt; Yeah, don't be reading my notes. [snorts] I'm just kidding, Brother David. Yeah. So the word loosing the barriers, &gt;&gt; I could have took your comment and put it right there, brother David. In fact, I have a gap right there in my notes. [snorts] You see, it's the word that loosed the barriers. It wasn't the fact Oh, I hope you get this. This will toss some of you. Wasn't the fact that Jesus said it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was the fact that it was the father &gt;&gt; that said it. &gt;&gt; That's right. that I hope that didn't toss any of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was the father made flesh. &gt;&gt; But he stood there &gt;&gt; also as a man. &gt;&gt; And that's the side I brought right there. See? So you could say, well, brother Brandham said this. How many people did brother Brandham talk to that went right out in their life, never changed, never got better? You know, my brother and sister, well, he prayed for me and I didn't feel a thing. &gt;&gt; The word never said feel it. &gt;&gt; No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; The word says believe it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word also says that your body will obey your confession. &gt;&gt; So, there's a sign that you actually believe. You start to confess and it starts to come out of your mouth. Amen. I'm healed. People might say, "You're sicker than you ever was." Why are you saying you're healed? I'm saying I'm healed because this says I'm healed. And this is the Lord Jesus Christ in print. &gt;&gt; So therefore, I am healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. The body, it might be the body. It might have its issues, but the soul says amen to every word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now look at this here in the sermon inspiration. Amen. I think we have this. Yes. [snorts] So there you are. You have to cross through every barrier and burn every fence behind you to get to Christ. &gt;&gt; Can we erase the word every and that still mean the same thing? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Every means absolute. &gt;&gt; Every. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we can't be partway there and say, "Well, I I I I went to church. &gt;&gt; I believe Jesus Christ is the son of God." No. Every word. You need every word. &gt;&gt; And the word will go through every barrier and will burn every fence. No matter what the world says, what the church says, what the people says, it's what Jesus said that counts. Amen. &gt;&gt; I stand here this morning, my brother and sister, more than one ailment in this whole body. And yet, I believe I'm healed in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It is my daily confession. I do not like to even talk about it because what this body testifies and what my soul testifies have a conflict. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to stand with what God laid in my heart. Amen. what he said by the word. I'm going to stand on that that I am healed in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, you know, we become so dependent on things around us. Amen. That uh they become almost like a crutch. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I went to church and the pastor preached on healing, but my doctor says, &gt;&gt; "Well, as long as your doctor is Dr. Jesus, amen, that'll be okay. But otherwise, you ought to just cut off that conversation and say, "The word says, "I'm healed." &gt;&gt; Amen. So there [snorts] you are. You got to cross through every barrier and burn every fence behind you to get to Christ. [snorts] Now, sometimes the barriers are big. &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever looked at your life and said, "My problems are so little." Everyone's problem is big to them. Everyone's problem is is an issue to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes the barriers are so small you have glossed over that. But I tell you those little issues have the strangest ability to come to the surface at just a certain time. What didn't bother you, so to speak, last month, 6 months ago, will be tormenting you today. &gt;&gt; What do you think's behind pushing that? Something that was insignificant has now become insurmountable. Amen. My brother and sister, that is not the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Satan pushing the button to cause a disruption, to cause people to get unfocused, unhinged or where God's trying to take them and turn our attention. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I come across this many years ago in in my trucking days, people [clears throat] in an accident and you witness it, you feel obligated to stop. And their reasoning to the patrolman of how they tailed the car in front of them is that they were looking at the car that had tail ended the car beside them. That had nothing to do with them. If they'd have kept their eyes on what was in front of them, they would have said, "Oh my, those people just had an accident." And they would have went on. but instead they were looking at what was going on around them and totally totally missed it and now they're in their own circumstance. My brother and sister, poor analogy, but I think you get it. Amen. We're not called to look at what's going on, Mr. Trump. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's sit down for a moment. Amen. Do we got 30, 45 minutes or 30 or 45 days? All I know is according to the word in the end time &gt;&gt; there'll be wars and rumors of wars. There'll be all these circumstances the scripture has declared the prophet brought clarity into these things. I don't need to drill down on that. What I need to do is keep watching what is in front of me. I need to keep walking looking at Christ uh moving forward. I need to just uh come and make my calling and election sure. Amen. make sure I was just I I'll just be boastful. This will sound bad, but I was just in the back room praying before we come out today. Lord, let our young people especially, but every one of you, let you be searching for oil. Not for wealth, not for fame, not for this or for that, but be searching for oil. Because in the moment that we hear those words, the bridegroom cometh, my brother and sister, when you don't have oil in your lamp, you are going to suffer the greatest pain, physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, that you could ever suffer in your life. So don't look to the right, don't look to the left. Amen. Look to the one that has redeemed you, that has called you and put oil in that lamp. All the rest of this is Satan's distraction in your life. You say, but this is very important. They insulted me. They this and this did this and that happened there. My brother and sister, I want you to understand. I say this with absolute uh uh just um anchored solid into this. Amen. That's nothing but the devil. &gt;&gt; They said what they said to you. They did what they did to you. The circumstance was such recognize that's just distraction. That has nothing to do with you. Amen. You are a son. You are a daughter of God. And God's calling you to have oil in your lamp. Make sure you got oil in your lamp. Don't worry about what everybody else's lamp looks like. Look at your lamp. Amen. And when you look at your lamp, we'll start to get concerned when it starts to get low. &gt;&gt; We'll start looking back in the word and start getting sincere and focused. Amen. But sometimes the barriers are so small. &gt;&gt; I'll be transparent. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? You can use it against me later in the court of law. When I was just a kid, didn't know any better. [clears throat] My older brother out out in the edge of Oregon where the family owns a farm, the little store there, the man there, my older brother wasn't that much older than me. And uh I was 10 I think about at that time. So he was 12, 13 years old, 14 years old. the man selling cigarettes to my brother. And one day I happened to be there and I saw what was going on. I went and told my grandmother. The next time I walked in that store, that man practically pinned me against the wall and told me, "You've got diarrhea for a mouth." [clears throat] Glad some of you saw humor in that. At that age, I found no humor at all in that. And I remember that that hurt. It cut me right to the bone. But you see his insult by God's grace. I remember as a young kid, the church had a visiting minister and he says took the word, you know, kind of brought it around in such a way. Out of the mouth of many devils will a witness be brought. And I thought, oh, that's right. The devil's got his own witnesses. And I remember the next time I went in that store after that took place, I looked at that man and even as a kid, I thought, I need to feel sorry for you. You're a devil. That gave me a lot of satisfaction as a kid. You know, I'm not talking to a clerk in a store or owner of a store. I'm That's a devil. Changed my whole outlook. Amen. Of course, the devil's going to say to every man, woman, boy, girl, young teenager, whatever, that you you have a problem. It's you. It's all about you. It's not about me trying to kill the life and influence the life of children. It's you that's the problem. I'm right. You're wrong. Amen. But when you recognize that's just a witness of the devil, &gt;&gt; that's Satan speaking, &gt;&gt; you know what happens then? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Get thee behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; Get thee behind me. What you have to say has nothing to do with me. &gt;&gt; We're in like two different worlds. &gt;&gt; You're in your world, cursed. Oh, I know this sounds just real boastful, but I think you'll agree we're in our world. That's right. &gt;&gt; Blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I don't care what Satan's got to say. &gt;&gt; Might call this some old-fashioned religion, too rigid, to this, to that. My brother and sister, everything I believe, and I don't say this boastful, I say it as a fact. Everything I believe is anchored right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have an opinion out here that fits this or fits that. My opinion is right here [snorts] on the pages of this book. But not just on the pages cuz the Bible's everywhere. It's by revelation to be read between the lines to see who we are today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this word was meant to bring you to a state that you believe. &gt;&gt; That's all it's here for. Not to have church, not to have religion, not to have some pompus, but to believe the word is coming to make you and I believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look, doesn't matter how small the barrier is, a barrier is still a barrier. &gt;&gt; What's the definition of a barrier? Webster in the simplistic form is an obstacle. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you today, do you have obstacles &gt;&gt; in your life? Amen. &gt;&gt; I think every one of us, if we'd be honest, would lift a hand and say, &gt;&gt; "I have obstacles. &gt;&gt; I've got things I have to overcome." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got challenges that I can't seem to overcome. &gt;&gt; But the word says, &gt;&gt; "That's right. &gt;&gt; You're an overcomer." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, if you believe the word, you'll look at that obstacle and say, "Okay, I might not overcome you today, but tomorrow, watch out." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in the hidden life with Christ, [snorts] you know the best thing is to live a sermon instead of preach one. &gt;&gt; You know that. &gt;&gt; Your written epistles. Now, Brother Brandon was just randomly speaking to people here. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; no more random than I'm just speaking to people. &gt;&gt; God knew every one of you would be here today. And there was a purpose behind it. We can say, "Well, that old slobbering preacher, you know, that old guy just mispronounces his word, slurs them." No, no, no. You got to look a little deeper than that. God knew you would be here and what God laid on my heart. Amen. I had a whole different topic I was going to preach, believe it or not. Amen. And then I just couldn't get away from this one. And here we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister, God's that perfect. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he's not God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Isaac shared a little article with me, you know, that there science is thinking that u and brother Isaac might have to correct my my memory on this. Science is thinking there's coming a day they're going to have to correct their atomic clock because time has changed and and time has changed 1 billionth or something of a second. You think science can even figure out what 1 1 billionth of a second is? But you got to understand, let me insert this. Pause. Satan's whole goal, he doesn't care about what topic you're talking about. His whole goal is to get you to question the validity of what God said. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; His whole thing that he's working towards. It don't matter whether you're Catholic, a Methodist, Baptist, whatever. Going right down the line. It don't matter. You can be an atheist. He's still working on them to put it to a place where God is discounted. He's put to the side because we've saw a flaw. Well, my brother and sister, the word of God, which I happen to believe, and I know that you happen to believe, says he's perfect. &gt;&gt; So, what's Satan doing? He's working his way into society, into people. That it's there. Now, I know I've spoken over the pulpit. I've spoke it to you. But I want you to understand this this morning. Tie this in. These boys wanting to be girls and these girls wanting to be boys. You say it's science. No. Do you understand the whole undermining of this is they're trying to say God made a mistake. &gt;&gt; There's where it's at. That's what the whole underpine. God should have made me a boy. God should have made me a girl. God should have this. God should have that. He made a mistake. No, my brothers and sister, has nothing to do with gender dysphoria. It has nothing to do with these things over here. It's all about Satan's agenda to get people to believe that God cannot be trusted. God cannot be counted on. That God can make a mistake. &gt;&gt; And if you're going to sit there and say, "If he can make a mistake, then maybe when he said I was saved, that was a mistake. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe when he said he could forgive my sins, that was a mistake. It's a neverending thing that just goes on, just rolls right on and like a snowball on the mountain just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. And the end result of it is those young people come to the place that say there isn't even a God. &gt;&gt; It's no longer whether they can trust him or not. It brings them to a place they deny he even exists. &gt;&gt; There's Satan's goal. &gt;&gt; But he uses these other things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where was I? &gt;&gt; You know, the best thing is to live a sermon instead of preach one. You know that your written epistles, &gt;&gt; but you can't do it in yourself. Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; You can impersonate it for a little while, but your sins will find you out. &gt;&gt; You better just consecrate yourself to God and get on the inside. Shut the doors behind you. Burn every barrier that is behind you, every bridge, and launch out. Launch out. Amen. I know it's the truth. I know it will work. If it hadn't been for that, I don't know what would have become of me. That's right. But it ain't the people you have. My But it ain't the people you that look at them. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, my brother and sister, no matter what, Satan exposes a flaw in somebody. I brought that out earlier for this reason. You can look at me, you can find plenty of flaws. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In fact, I've just quit trying to even hide them. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It don't It don't work. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it don't work. When you look at me, our pastor has problems. It won't be long you're gone. But when you're walking out, please stop and look in the glass in the back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And look at the image &gt;&gt; and tell me that person is perfect. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; But when you look at me through the lens of the word, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; you're going to see blood covering me. &gt;&gt; That's right. And when I look at you through the lens of the word, I see blood covering you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we stand together then with the blood covering us, we can have fellowship because our fellowship is not in humanity. It's in God. It's in the word. It's in this resurrected life of a revealed word in this hour. There's where our fellowship is at. Amen. Better consecrate yourself to God and get on the inside. Shut the doors behind you. Burn every barrier there is behind you, every bridge, and launch out. I know it's the truth. I know it'll work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we believe this is truth at all, my brother and sister, the message of the hour, you've got a witness right here that's just as sure witness as you and I are to each other. And he's telling you, I know it works. And I stand here this morning behind this pulpit, this sacred desk, and I'll tell you, I know this works. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not guessing. I'm not throwing darts at a board to see what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now look at look at this. Such an action to come. God speaks to a man. If thou canst believe, his faith rose right up to that. Wait, no. He's confessing that he unbelieves. No, you missed the point. &gt;&gt; His faith rose right up. His fa faith expressed or exposed that he had certain little flaws, &gt;&gt; but he believed so much he pushed past the barrier of the flaw. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Admitted, I have unbelief &gt;&gt; and went and took a halt of the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what the saints will do. Once behind the veil, my brother and sister, you can't even recognize your old life because your old life has been removed from you. you're not a sinner. We say the phrase, "I'm a sinner saved by grace." But the real truth of it is when a a believer, son or daughter of God, gets behind the veil, you can never look back at your old life with the same eyes because it has been washed and you don't really see it. You say, "I was a drunkard. I was this. I committed adultery. I blah blah blah. My brother and sister, it's not the same. It's a whole different concept, a whole different thing bringing forth because you realize the old me is dead and that really never was me. This is me. &gt;&gt; This is me under the blood of Jesus Christ. This is me wrapped in the word. This is me robed in righteousness. This is me. Uh, amen. Perfect in his sight. Amen. This is me. That was not me. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Satan wants to always remind you about what you were. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he never talks about what you are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He wants to leave it past tense. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the minute you start talking about what you are, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He loses you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What do you mean I'm redeemed? &gt;&gt; You were a drunk. No, I'm You told me I'm redeemed. No, Satan will never go there. &gt;&gt; He'll never go there. Not with full revelation. Amen. [snorts] Let me move on. I don't know who stole the time, but somebody did. See, when you step across that line, as that father did, believe it or not, it was entirely his reaction to the word that delivered his child. &gt;&gt; Okay, family, this might be a little bit this might be a little bit in your face. &gt;&gt; We got children. [snorts] We got sons, daughters, husbands, wives not serving God. We're waiting for God to move. &gt;&gt; What if God's waiting for you to move? &gt;&gt; What if God's waiting for you to stand up and say, "Lord, I believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help my unbelief. &gt;&gt; Help me burn the bridges that would stop me from being able to claim deliverance. Amen. Salvation. Amen. for my children, husband or wife, whatever it is, good friend. You see, sometimes God's waiting on us. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; We sit back and say, "Well, I'm just waiting on the Lord to answer the prayer, and God's waiting for you to get off the couch." &gt;&gt; Amen. And do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12. Did I pass up just a second here? No, no. Looking at the unseen. I'm sorry. [snorts] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a time that the church needs to step across that line which separates you between faith and unbelief, by sight, and looking at the unseen by faith, it's now. Now look, my brothers and sisters, this is preached in 58. And of course, we see times have got so much better. No sir, you look back in 58 and I' I've done this. You go back and look at the the recorded history and uh a woman walk into a church in britches and they would have said, "What's wrong with you?" &gt;&gt; When women would have cut their hair, they'd have said, "What's wrong with you?" when men would behave what is common place now &gt;&gt; they have said what's wrong with you &gt;&gt; but it's declined to a place there's no respect anywhere &gt;&gt; now I know that kind might be straight it might be blunt but I'm telling you this is backed up by the word it's not a man's opinion and we'll look at this and this oh you might say well that's just a message perspective well it's strange that These people that deal in the realm of human behavior seem to have focused on that. They don't believe the message. I'm sorry to tell you, but they have focused that they have seen the decline and they've seen the rise. Oh my &gt;&gt; my. Can Can I just be blunt with you what I've read, studied, they saw the rise of single mothers. They saw the rise of children out of wedlock. Yeah. same thing, but just I thought the official term children out of wedlock of people just living together, the rise of parents abandoning their children, abortion, all of these things, my brother and sister. Amen. What did the prophet tell us? Somebody, somebody spit it out for me. When did the prophet of God say that if they don't accept Jesus Christ by this time? 56. &gt;&gt; I I challenge you. &gt;&gt; Go to Google, research it. 1956, the numbers turn up and go, and everything gets worse and worse and worse. The numbers start rising. You say, "That was just William Brandham's words, my brother and sister. That was God speaking a warning to America, and they didn't listen, and they rejected Christ. And the facts, the statistics prove it." Oh, that well that's your opinion. No. Well, like I said, these scientist guys, &gt;&gt; I don't think they all believe the message. I don't think they're just quoting the prophet because they feel obligated to. They're studying all of this behavior. &gt;&gt; And they're seeing the result of this behavior. Now, if Brother Brandham had come in 1992 and said, "Well, because of this," we could look at it and say, "Oh, he just Googled that and figured out." No. No. He spoke it before it happened. &gt;&gt; And so what was he doing? He was mouththing &gt;&gt; what God told him to say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was a warning to you and I. &gt;&gt; Now let me put it in this fashion. We have a warning in the word that says when you hear, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him." The word already warned us. There'll be a group of people that will say, "Oh, give me of your oil. I don't have any for myself. I I want I want you to have compassion on me and and give me some oil." &gt;&gt; But there's no secondhand Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; There's no secondhand relationship with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be a firsthand experience. Amen. If it's secondhand, my brother and sister, it's more than likely just religion. &gt;&gt; If you be this, you'll be saved. And I'm probably a little cynical. Forgive me. Works the same thing in the message. You can't sit here and say, "I believe God sent a prophet." That's not a vessel filled with oil. &gt;&gt; A parrot. Is this okay? Am I too blunt? &gt;&gt; You guys will all forgive me someday. &gt;&gt; You could teach a parrot to say, "God sent a prophet." &gt;&gt; We don't need a church with parrots. We need a church with people filled with a revelation of Jesus Christ present in our life. It's real and it's on fire and it's producing a result. Amen. That we could stand here today and it would be to a place if thou can't believe and we could be able I believe we will come to that place. He'll say, "If thou can't believe," and all we will say is, "I believe." &gt;&gt; We won't be looking back saying, "Help my unbelief." Because that's what God's working through us today to push the unbelief, to push that to a spiritual maturity where we come up. And it don't matter what we're facing. The word is preeminent. The word is first. The life of Christ is living in us. And that's all we see. That's all we want. That's all we're seeking for. And that's all we will be filled with. &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, my brother and sister, we'll be just another church. We'll just be another denomination. We'll just be another group out here. But the prophet of God told us this message will never denominate. And people say, "But but it is already this is going on." Ah, he was talking about the message. He wasn't talking about people around the message. &gt;&gt; He was talking about the message. Amen. Who's the message here today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are the message here today. We are the life of Christ being lived out today. The truth made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's who we are. Oh, do you think you're super spiritual? No. You just have to ask Sister Jerry. She'll tell you that yesterday I got all impatient with her. I mean, I wasn't asking much just to have her climb a 20ft step uh extension ladder up into the gable and hold on to a board. You know, I wasn't asking much. Come on, get up the ladder. Hurry up. We ain't got all day. Yeah. I know. I'm sorry. That's me. I'm not proud of that. But I'll tell you, that's not really me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not here alone, am I? &gt;&gt; No. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you say, what you've done, though your sins be a scarlet. You once passed through that line of barrier of the devil trying to torment you. &gt;&gt; Anybody here know this same devil? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saying you can't do it. You can't do it. And what are you going to say as a bride of Jesus Christ? I can do it. For Jesus said, whosoever will, let him come and drink of the waters of the fountain of life freely. &gt;&gt; Amen. Leave it behind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I've got a little more stuff here, but I just want you to know, let me move ahead here. Time for us to let the word move us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Across that line. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 12. As we look at this, [snorts] wherefore, seeing that we are also compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin that so doth easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, &gt;&gt; looking unto Jesus, &gt;&gt; not into CNN. That's right. &gt;&gt; Not in Donald the last Trump. &gt;&gt; No, that's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our trust is in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not in a man in a white house. Not in a man that's a whatever you call it, premiere of a country or this or that of the country. But we're looking to Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the author. Amen. He wrote it, my brother and sister, before the foundation of the world. And he's the finisher of our faith. Amen. And so all these years have went by, time rolling on, and he come down and says, "Now it's time in this age to finish it." &gt;&gt; And he is finishing it. And you are the product of which he is finishing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despises shame, and sat down in the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endureth such contradiction. Can I can I just focus for a moment on this? Endureth such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds. &gt;&gt; You know what that contradiction is? Every time we step outside of the word, we became a contradiction to our Lord Jesus Christ. Satan wants to bring it down. It's not a big deal. &gt;&gt; Simple analogy. Many years ago when I was in the trucking business, there was a company. I wasn't there when this happened, but it come down firsthand to us. [snorts] There's a company that'd been habit before. And I'd been there and loaded before and they would get upset with you when they had the load, very tall load, and you would stop right there and throw a strap over it and they'd tell you, "Ain't got time for you to do that here. Move." And it wasn't until one of those loads one day tipped over and crushed a man &gt;&gt; right there and killed him. And then it becomes such a contradiction because they went so far the other way trying to deal with this lawsuits and all of this. Isn't that human behavior? &gt;&gt; But look what it is. We can ignore it till it kills us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or we can stop and say, "Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Help my unbelief. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Lord, I I am a believer. &gt;&gt; I want to stand on your word today. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, saints, I'm not trying to make an altar call. I'm just not very good at that. But I tell you, times unbelief pops up in our life that makes us a contradiction. and condemnation will cause you to become weary and faint in your mind. Recognizing you should do different and not doing it will bring you to a state where you never have rest. You never find peace in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A little straight this morning. Forgive me if it is too straight. But I'm telling you, I think it's time &gt;&gt; for us to come to the place &gt;&gt; that we would say, Lord, I want to put this behind me. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be a contradiction to your word. &gt;&gt; I want to be your word unreservedly. I want to join that great host of witnesses. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when we read this scripture, we're thinking back. Maybe maybe your own mind would say, "Oh, we're compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses and we're looking back to Abraham and we're looking all the way back." What about yesterday? &gt;&gt; We had witnesses in our midst &gt;&gt; a great cloud. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; People just like you overcoming &gt;&gt; in this day that would be able to stand and say, "You know what? Mark 16 in action." You know, Brother Brown focused on that quite a bit. &gt;&gt; Saints, I'm going to tell you, if we wouldn't be looking backwards, we would see much more of Mark 16 taking place. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have contradiction in our life. I'm healed. I just don't feel like it. I just don't see it. I just don't. No, we would come and say, you know what? I don't care what happened. &gt;&gt; I'm healed in the name of Jesus Christ. I don't care what happened. I'm delivered in the name of Jesus Christ. I don't care what Satan says. I've got the Holy Ghost. I've met all the requirements and he promised to give me the Holy Ghost. I've got the Holy Ghost. Where is it at? It's growing in me being built up. It's coming forth as a life that is a testimony not to us &gt;&gt; but to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, would you come? Musicians. Amen. Hallelujah. Sorry, I've [snorts] kept you just a little bit long here. We'll be going on a trip. Brother David will cut his services short to make up for this. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's sing that song, The Other Only Believe. When Brother Isaac announced that, I thought, "Oh my, praise God." But then I realized I was talking about the other Only Believe. Amen. Let's just stand. Worship the Lord for a few minutes before we go. Hallelujah. [snorts] Come help me, brother Isaac.
