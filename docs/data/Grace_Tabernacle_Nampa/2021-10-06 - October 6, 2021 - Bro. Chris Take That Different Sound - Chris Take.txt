of god again i feel bad for y'all probably sick of me it's okay there's we're grilling steak sunday morning but david will be preaching so tonight it's just broccoli and chicken oh i'm just kidding exodus chapter 28. that's 28 34. a golden bell and a pomegranate a golden bell and a pomegranate upon the hem of the robe round about and it shall be upon aaron to minister and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the lord and when he cometh out that he die not leviticus 25 verse 8. 25 verse 8 and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee sometimes seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hollow the 50th year in proclaimed liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man on excuse me unto his family let's pray this morning this evening heavenly father lord jesus i pray you just quiet my spirit tonight lord father there's probably some here tonight might have come in in the world within the lord father forgive us lord jesus father we quiet our spirits now tonight as we would prepare to hear from you lord jesus that you would allow me to step aside lord and i just give you full control tonight you you you take the service lord that's why we came to hear you it wouldn't come if it was just a man speaking father so i just pray that you would bless your word tonight lord may something be said to encourage the hearts of your people lord lift us up we ask father god may our lives become more in tune with you father our hearts desire line up with the will of your word lord father and we just want to commit our pastor and his family to your hands as well lord is still coming to the end of the harvest but very busy work and along with the passing of sister jerry lord i just prayed and encouraged them lift him up give our pastor strength father lord we just love you so much we're so thankful that we get to be called father children of the king committed ourselves to your hands now in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated tonight amen i'd like to read a story here this evening before we get started i don't have a slide for it so you can just leave it where it is but my title tonight is that different sound and sounding for christ so we sing a song and most of you probably know this story but um i'm not going to give it away i'm just going to read the story so horatio spafford knew something about life's unexpected challenges he was a successful attorney and real estate investor who lost a fortune in the great chicago fire of 1871 around the same time his beloved four-year-old son died of scarlet fever thinking thinking a vacation would do his family some good he sent his wife and four daughters on a ship to england planning to join them after he finished some pressing business at home however while crossing the atlantic ocean the ship was involved in a terrible collision and sunk more than 200 people lost their lives including all four of horatio's bafford's daughters his wife anna survived the tragedy upon arriving in england she sent a telegram to her husband that began saved alone what shall i do horatio immediately set sail for england at one point during his voyage the captain of the ship aware of the tragedy that had struck the spafford family summoned horatio to tell him that they were now passing over the spot where the shipwreck had occurred as horatio thought about his daughter's words of comfort and hope filled his heart and mind he wrote them down and they have since become a well-beloved hymn when peace like a river attendeth my way when sorrows like sea bellows rule whatever my lot thou has taught me to say it is well it is well with my soul can we see that course together oh it is well [Music] with my soul oh it is well it is well with my soul hey man we enjoy that hymn it's always no matter how old it gets it still holds such power behind it and that's because horatio spatford in a time of difficulty in the time of tragedy in his life something moved in his heart and sometimes uh people and now this is totally a different direction than i thought it would go we're just relying on the lord but sometimes what happens is people question why someone can stand the faith in the face of a tragedy like horatio spafford went through but you see what happened was the pressure was put on him and when the pressure was applied to horatio it just pushed out music it pushed out a sound that was who he is who he was and that sound sounded for christ you see in the time of tragedy when people begin to fall from god it's because god never was inside of them when tragedy strikes or when things get hard or the road gets difficult and they're squeezed the sound of christ doesn't come out something else does a noise and so if you have christ when things happen in your life when you get squeezed out comes from you the sound of christ amen so we are singing the song one day um i keep listening for a different sound and um i begin to think about that and just stir within what what what's what is it the sound of the city that jumps the sound of the city the sound of the bride being united with the groom right but that different sound and that different sound is what our life produces under the anointing of christ that sound is what the relationship of the bride with the groom brings out is that sound of christ amen so sound is vibrations that travel through the arrow or another medium and can be heard when they wrench a person's or animal's ear or a thing that can be heard now there's a scripture in the bible that says blessed are those that hear or excuse me i might have misquoted that but my sheep hear my voice right to hear in the bible is to have a revelation yes so i didn't come up with this just out of the blue the word of god has a sound and that sound is the truth of christ that sound is christ or revelation god is in his nature you believe that because he created it it's a it's a it's a description of god just like your life is a description or an example of god your life lived for him the very creation of a baby in the womb is testifies to god and so sound is a part of what god created and so he he speaks and he says you know you hear my voice and not that it's some special uh tone or some special anything like that or vibration but it's a revelation that resonates within you so a steep calleth to the deep and um praise the lord so we're just using the sound as of this example and but sound noise is not the same thing noise is a sound but it's a little bit different when you when you hear a great a crash or a car wreck you man what was that noise right when you hear music or you hear something sweet you know you don't think of it as noise it's just a natural tendency we don't call it noise because the definition is a loud unpleasant disturbing sound sounding is giving forth sound especially loud or resonant sound amen so um the sound of christ is the sound of freedom it's music the great orchestra brother talks about it the great sound you know the clashing of the symbols at the right time if you clash the symbols together at the wrong time it's just noise there's no music nobody's going to call it music they're going to want their money back but the sound the music amen it's a beautiful sound we don't say beautiful noise we say a beautiful sound you hear the sound of the birds right john 8 32 says and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the sounding of christ my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me amen that is the sounding of christ but the world's call is noise and lots of it and you see if you take if you take a if you take a speaker and you put it here and you play just pure god anointed music and then you you turn up you said a speaker over here and you play something not got anointed and you blast that that noise will overcome this if it doesn't get turned up but it talks about the black dog and the white dog inside of you whether you feed the black dog or you feed the white dog depends on the victory you're getting or the victory you're not getting well when your life is sounding for christ you're having victory over the noise of the world but when the noise of the world has increased in your life and you're not putting emphasis on christ amen that sound begins to diminish and then you're pushing forth an atmosphere that's created from the noise of the world but when you're focusing on christ you mean you're pushing forth the sound or the music of the gospel of jesus christ and it's creating that atmosphere that goes with that how many of those music creates atmospheres amen they've the science has proven it with with plants growing into the speakers of classical and pure music and shriveling up and dying from the speakers of rock and roll so it's a sound amen everything has a sound that brings brings forth a sound and now first kings 19 verse 11 to 13. um we we pick up here the story of elijah and now um we're moving in from from um as christians our daily walk and as as a message believers especially well those are the same thing um the scripture says and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord pass by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and now after the wind and earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake oh you should have been there the power of god swept down or you should have been there it was like things where everything was shaking whoops sorry um anyways should have been there the rocks were falling from the mountains there were earthquakes and and the wind and it was it was it was crazy it was mighty but god wasn't in those things god is in see a connection you always bring a balance a connection with god in his presence will bring some kind of outward display of emotion not every single time but it's still of god by the dance across the pews remember but sometimes people can just associate the wind the earthquake the fire and just by the attributes of the fire and the wind of the earthquake they can say that's god but the bible says the lord was not in the wind in this instance he was not in the earthquake he was not and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice you see you're never going to confuse the voice of christ with anything else but you can't confuse the fire with something else you can't confuse the wind with something else you can't confuse the earthquake with something else you can have a a falling of the spirit and a great moving on your flesh and walk away unchanged but you hear the voice of god one time you will never be the same you will never be the same amen that's all you have to make sure is though is god in the wind ask yourself is god in the wind lord king revelation are you in the wind tonight are you in the wind this morning are you in the wind right now are you in the earthquake are you in the fire god because god was in the fire for the children of israel oh the three hebrew children shadrach meshach and abednego he was in the fire and he walked there had to be shouting right you're standing in flame and fire not being burned i think you would probably shout don't even sit there think you wouldn't you would you dance enough if you get burned um praise the lord praise the lord so what is the key what's the key here elijah listening for the sound of christ the lord was just trying to distract him he was testing him is he focused is he waiting on me brings the wind brings the earthquake brings the fire the lord was not in the fire after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle in other words he wrapped himself in humility and the the his the clothes of humanity and went out and stood in the entering into the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear elijah so god wasn't in the wind the earthquake the fire they were all just noises to the uncalled it would appear mighty and spiritual they say god you can go watch you know the pentecostals and some of them some well it's getting worse now but some of their music is is good you go watch them and and they're worshiping god right it's fire and earthquake and wind but god's not there but the bible says the angel of the lord said call them lodges there is no christ there but to the uncalled it's mighty and spiritual and it draws them to that because they're saying it has to be god because it's fire not because it's the word and that's the separation the sounding of god can use fire the sounding of christ can use an earthquake the sounding of christ can use the wind but it's going to line up with the word the sounding of christ your life will sound for christ you might run the aisles and be just as lost as the bomb on the street that's message that's in the message the spirit you've had you get baptized with the holy ghost on their flesh every day of your life and still go to hell this is a sounding so what happens god tests everybody the seed is gonna test it the person is gonna be tested because we're all human and we're going to go through tests and so when you go through that test the fire the earthquake and the wind is not going to save you in those tragic times or in those difficult times like horatio but it's the deep calling it's the deep within the sea down inside of you that's that will come forth and will sound for christ and will make the the bring forth the life of christ in those moments elijah did not get caught up in his feelings instead he listened for a sound that's the tricky thing saints of god the wind the earthquake and the and the fire they touch our emotions they touch our feelings but it's god in it i'm not saying they're wrong i'm asking you is god in it in that moment you have to use the sermon the bible says discern the um well the spirit of the lord will discern the very thoughts intents of the heart but he will give you the ability amen with the word of god to judge what is right and wrong with the holy spirit but don't become critical of someone who's displaying emotion and say oh it's emotion it can't be god see there's you can go the other direction you can sit on your pew phone stone face for 50 years and miss every move of god it can go both ways so the balance is what it always comes back to the word of god is it sounding christ okay so when when elijah was listening he was listening for the voice of god he was listening for the sound of christ and when he heard it he stepped forth you notice in that scripture that he stepped out then the lord asked him the question see guys are going to sit in vegas he wants us to stand like mature sons and daughters of god amen and step out in faith and faith takes a foundation upon the word of god and if you have a foundation on faith which is a spiritual revelation of christ your life is going to sound christ and if your life sounding for christ guess what you know what the sound of christ sounds like you can identify because my sheep hear my voice amen once you hear the voice of christ sound in your life you can step forth in faith but saying to god this is something that is kind of a go that's on my heart here in in in in in these notes and just in general is that we get in such a hurry man we the spirit of the age is hurry we ice we lived in phoenix right if you lived in phoenix at all you know bell road is the worst traffic in the world i don't care where you're from we moved here and it's like man there you guys are complaining about traffic and me and chris's life we've been here for only a year and a half and we're like this traffic is horrible it used to take me 10 minutes now it takes me 18. instead of an hour it's taking me an hour to go two miles down bell road right just it's it so it's everyone's in a hurry that's all i'm trying to say everyone's in a hurry they want it fast i work i you guys know what i do software engineering and websites and everything and i don't i don't do so much this part of things but i do know you you have you the attention span you have on a web page is like 0.7 seconds if you don't catch their attention in 0.7 seconds forget it they're gonna move on they're gonna go they're gonna click back and look at the next google search 0.7 seconds i was young enough and or i'm old enough i guess you could say that but and my parents were backwards enough that i had dial up as a kid mom get off the phone i need i'm trying to get on right i want to yahoo messenger somebody or something dial up you sat there and you waited five ten minutes right and that was that's just what you did now it's if it's not instant you're calling your network provider saying what's your problem my page didn't load in 30 seconds in a hurry in a hurry you can't approach god through the technique of the world you can't approach god in the style of the world you see that in domination in denominational lodges you see that man they got the skinny jeans and the mohawks and they just got the world over and they're trying to approach the gospel in the style of the world to appeal to the world and you can't do that so if in serving god you can't approach god in a hurry sometimes he is not going to give you the answer to your question because you're not ready for it you think you are you think you're ready for the answer but god says no you're not ready for the answer just yet corey ten boom was on the on a train traveling to amsterdam i believe with her father she was a young girl and she asked kind of an adult question just curious as a kid and and uh her dad didn't say anything they got to the train station he stood up he pulled his suitcase off the rack and he handed it to her and said corey can you carry this out for me sure she couldn't even pick it up so he grabbed it he said cory your question you asked me when you're strong enough god will give you the answer to carry that burden to carry that knowledge when you're big enough when you're strong enough then you'll know sometimes god knows you're not bigger big enough and strong enough in your faith to accept the answer because while you're asking why you're seeking him and he might bring up something in in your life for you to ask why because you've been sounding you've been bringing forth noise and he put something in your path that kind of stops you kind of shakes you up and so you start seeking you start praying and what you're doing is in your mind you're looking for an answer but what's happening is you're drawing nearer to god so god not not exactly but leads you along to bring you into a place nearer to him and then he'll he gives you that answer sometimes we're not always ready for the answer and god will bring things to draw us closer to him and then just like the roots of the tree something somebody asks you a hard question that you can't answer it shakes your roots and you go and you look in the word and you draw nearer to god and god gives you the revelation that you need to dig your roots down deeper so you don't always get the answer right away he wants you to step forth in faith so don't get a don't get in a hurry take time to find your footing on faith in christ and then don't step forth at the first sign you see be still and wait upon the lord i was talking to someone the other day and we were discussing a situation and they were mentioning some advice that they got and um i said you know that advice is what was good excuse me good advice but is that what the lord is is that the direction the lord is leading you you're talking about you know waiting you know well if it's god's will i'll wait and this thing will happen i said gideon was in the will of god when he set the fleece out for god to put dew on and no do on the grass or dry and do on the grass he was in the will of god god was leading him to do that to to to make sure that that's what gideon needed if god's not leading you to sit and wait for this over here you need to find the will of god i don't know how i got there because i was talking about being waiting and being patient the first sign that's what i was trying to say not always is the sign that that that that sign that you know how am i trying lord give me grace i've heard it said in times past um oh if god wants me to i'm going to use this example it's it's it's very uh not very um i'm just going to use this example if god wants me to have a job he'll give me one and i'm gonna sit over here and do nothing if god wants me to have a job he'll give me a job well it's god's will that you have a job because you're called to be a provider so if you're sitting there not doing anything about it you're out of the will of god because that's not what the bible says you should be out looking for a job but people can use that oh if god wants it to me he'll give it to me as a crutch and they never step forth in faith now once you once you catch the revelation of stepping forth in faith you become a doer you become an actionable christian but ins in doing so now you have to find the balance and not get in a hurry to go out and take it let god still bring it to you what was abraham was given circumcision as a testament to his faith amen god saw abraham's faith and gave him the sign of that faith so god will will ask you to step out of faith like elijah did ecclesiastes 3 1 to everything there is the season and the time to every purpose under the heaven there's a time for these things there's a season that god works in seasons and then it's not just a season where you need to sit and patiently wait long as you're in the will of god but they wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen when you hear that still small voice step forth no in a hurry god has a provided way it's a bit of a story kind of a long quote but bear with me here now our heavenly father standing here in this little old crude built tabernacle yet knowing that the shekinah glory of god who dwelt under the interlocked wings of the cherubs is standing present now and as our souls can let loose of the filthy things of the world that moves into his presence and we can feel and know that he is standing here we come boldly knowing that we would knowing this that we would die if it wasn't for christ's glory but his shed blood makes a way we could come then boldly up to your throne under the interlock wings of the cross god this man here fine looking big style looking man standing here wanting to preach the gospel what a glorious thing and yet satan has given him a stammering stuttering voice but he wants it to move today so that he can preach the gospel o eternal god we know that thou has used in times past stammers and stutters but this man wants to be free for he feels embarrassed about it with it so today by the merits of the lord jesus by god's provided program and way by the witness of the holy ghost and the presence of god and his servant i lay hands upon him and i condemn this spirit in the name of jesus christ may it leave my brother and may this evil thing leave that would hinder the gospel and may he go forth and be able to preach the gospel with the true ringing sounding voice for god's glory lord i lay these my hands upon him because it's your commission it's your bidding to do so through jesus christ that you granted for god's glory i want every head bowed and no one to raise your heads until you hear me say so please holy spirit heal this brother here in jesus christ's name for god's glory and the gospel and i condemn you thou evil one leave in jesus name now my brother i believe that you are going to preach the gospel i do and i believe that you're going to do without stammering without stuttering i want you to say praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah there you are i love the lord i love the lord give him i give him praise see different now now hold on to him while i talk to you while you feel better now feel different sure because the lord has granted this to you and you don't have it amen say this i love jesus praise be to god now just keep your heads bowed listen to this man no stammering at all he is healed god bless you brother go on your road now rejoicing now let's raise our heads and give god praise say thank you lord jesus there goes a man into the ministry to preach the gospel that once was once a stutterer you see god had given him a calling but there was something hindering him from fulfilling what god had called him to do god had called him to stand and preach the gospel to sound for christ now everybody has a different gift in the body of christ that god has called you to sound for him but if there's something in the way see the devil is going to come right away as soon as you catch revelation of what god wants you to do as soon as you catch the understanding all of your gift or what god has placed you to do he's gonna the devil's gonna come raging in and put a a roadblock in your way and you're gonna have to find god you're gonna have to wait upon god for him to renew your strength so that you can step forth into your ministry whether that's preaching or housewife or sit here in the church and help in the sound booth or the music whatever it is step forth in your ministry and begin to sound for christ you see it's god's will that whatever it is that is hindering you right now that it would be moved out of the way for you to step forth and sound for christ amen praise the lord nothing can stand in the way amen second kings chapter 5 verse 1 to 4. now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master i know we just read about this but his master and honorable because by him the lord had given deliverance because excuse me unto syria he was also a mighty man in valor but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on naaman's wife and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of israel so we know the end of the story damon goes to israel and he's healed of his leprosy but you see that little maid she had a calling just like the man we read in the quote she had a calling but she god had to bring her into position for her to fulfill that calling to sound for christ when she said those words she was testifying of christ she was sounding for christ it's a different sound right so different syria didn't have prophets of the lord it's a different sound it's odd to the world because it's christ it's the direct opposite the satan's eating this the noise is very different but you see she had a calling she was born for this day this little girl was born for this day and what kind of and i mentioned i think i mentioned this on sunday what kind of heartache did she have to experience what kind of backside of the desert experience did she have to go through to get into position you see god did this in my own life brought me from one place to another to sit and and to go through things and to learn and to and and to and for god to express and and me having a desire that god would use me but god's saying it's not time yet you need training to get into position she she needed to be physically moved from israel to syria he said oh wow you know i feel a calling to syria no she was taken from her home taken from her family taking from everything familiar to her you see god sometimes will rip us up and put us somewhere else so that we can sound for christ that can be a physical location different state move across the world my wife and i were discussing this earlier today you know it's funny sometimes uh even messi sometimes message believers they'll ask you questions like why are you moving why are you leaving and and and wonder what what well what what's what um what's happened so i just started saying well the will of god but i want to say does is the will of god not involve moving locations moving across god can call you to move to timbuktu tomorrow and and and if somebody's not careful they're looking so brother david done lost his mind uh well i'm sorry whether david was brother david for all the other times now he's doing something absurd timbuk2 and suddenly he's lost his mind i don't know how or god calls you to live in downtown chicago and somebody says ah brother i don't know how you do that the will of god it's a simple question so so so anyway she's pulled from her home and she's put in her position so god will move you sometimes that's why i was what i was going with that got a movie sometimes and this is um brother andrew coffey was was giving a presentation at the men's meetings and he was talking about training providers young men in the church training them to be providers and uh but he he brought up a concept that's called it's anywhere people versus somewhere people and this concept is is uh you know this this man he his his great-grandfather worked at the factory down from the road his grandfather worked at the factory down at the end of the road his dad worked at the factory down at the end of the road and he looked at the factory down the end of the road well then some decision is made in china this trade route is taken off this product's not bought anymore and that factory's closed down now they don't know what to do that's a somewhere people but in anywhere people the market dries up they move they move from chicago to denver where the market's hot then that dries up they move right so they have no issues they're anywhere anywhere you want to go and it's it stuck with me because i thought you know that's true with us in our life we have to be careful not to put a period at the end of god's will for our life what's god going to call you to do tomorrow you don't know but you can prepare yourself for that you can prepare yourself for what god because guess what you don't want to miss you don't want to miss his voice because you miss it you here's the thing as a as a predestinated seat of christ you will come to your position but wouldn't you rather get there the easiest way possible so if you're paying attention if you're if you're focused on sounding for christ when god asks you to move to northern siberia you say where's my backpack for northern alaska barrow where it's dark all year round right you're ready amen you're sounding for christ so she she was put into a position where she could sound for christ and by her testimony by her sounding for christ a man was delivered from sin leprosy's a type of sin a few words spoken of her in the season in the time brought about deliverance sometimes god sends you through difficulties for somebody else he'll make you live hell go through hell so you can be there when someone else needs it that's exactly right we look at the story of joseph oh joseph have every right to be mad at god if you will if you will allow me that liberty to say that but inside joseph was something anchored in faith and when the pressure was put on him he didn't crack the sound and the music of christ bursted forth no matter where he was the atmosphere changed because the sound of christ was coming from his life you have a rough day at the house you know everyone's put on some nice music that atmosphere is created put on the tape that atmosphere created right so the same thing with joseph potiphar's house house excuse me potiphar's house abundance and blessings the jail abundance and blessings you say oh god can't bless me here in this position with my dad and my family or in this position with my husband or my wife i just i just need to get out of this position no god didn't call little girl a little maid to get out of her position for all we know she went the rest of her life in bondage to that family that's for all we know but that was the position that god placed her in i wished i could remember the story but i'll try my best there was a a a man maybe i maybe may have even heard it from from our pastor over this pulpit but a man that was sent to the remote jungles of africa and and and he he they he finally got support he went over there years he's been over there years finally um so the financial support was pulled because nothing was happening and um you know his family had gotten sick i don't think anybody passed away but just just turmoil and he was there for years and never saw the fruits of his labor he he you know god called him to leave he left and like i said i wish i had the details but sometime later because of him being there this person down the road they took what he told him their life changed finally well after he left and he went down the river and just lit the whole country side on fire for christ villages and chiefs and everything just whole crop come to fruition but that man never saw it not always will we see we'll look back on our life and say why you know if we're not careful we'll say well that was a mistake why did i do that you know why did i you know for me like why did i go to college for a semester and waste five thousand dollars if i didn't finish college i don't know i might i might have maybe maybe missed it at the beginning and god didn't want me to go there maybe it was permissive well maybe it was the will of god i'm gonna take it in this stance it was the will of god and i had an impression on somebody and i probably will never ever know that am i lifting myself up absolutely not i'm saying god will place you places to do things for other people and you might not always know it amen you talk about joseph though forsaken of his brethren falsely accused forgotten in prison and then raised up to his position so god could use him all that that he went through the the torment and the the pain that he went through was he was blessed but god put in a position where he could then save the entire uh country of egypt whatever you want to call it his entire life was astounding for christ in what he did and then afterwards looking back on his life it was a type of christ so his whole as a whole sounded for christ in that way amen sounding for christ is a much different sound than the world is used to remember my title tonight that different sound it's different he say here is you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despises him that sent me amen you have to embrace that different sound we're we're odd to the world and there's no way getting around that please don't try never fear though god will use you see that's the thing that's the thing the world looks at you and says oh you're weak you need a crutch called the gospel when actually you have the power you're the one whose power has the power you're not in bondage you're in freedom they're in bondage but in the flesh realm so don't feel inferior to them because you are called of god you have a different sound but guess what you carry the power to change lives had somebody the other day tell me you know they're asking me what well i i coached um i was talking to a guy the other day and um i coached my son's t-ball team um not my choice and um one of the got one of the parents was asking where i was going because i had to set up for him to one of the parents to take the game while i was gone and i tell him a church retreat and he instantly goes hey you don't think i'm cussing but i know i got theology i went to school and that's a bunch of baloney i read the rosetta stone and and this and the whole thing it happened before christ and all this stuff and hey man brother get knowledge man get knowledge and he walked off and got in his car and left and i was just like i didn't say anything i was just like i was unexpected but did the rosetta stone changed his life i you know if i had if god will will it he'll give me the courage to say it show me what the rosetta stone did for you they can't and they won't always be honest with you they say oh i'm i have a great life but they don't they don't i can say well i'll go read your rosetta stone i'm not afraid to read it because that's the hey let's just start there a stone somebody dug up but we have the bible that's been copied and transcribed down through history from its origin and they're going to go off some stone some loony bin dug up in the desert somewhere in the remote location in the world anyways you just put a little common sense to it amen a lot of times you can anyways let your life sound for christ me and him i never talk about the gospel again but every practice every game mine my wife my kids our life is going to sound for christ amen you must embrace that different sound because your life through the word sounds for christ even musicians come tonight that is my desire i believe that's your desire and when we get noisy help us to lord ask the lord to help us to recognize that the set that the what we're bringing forth is just noise sometimes as long as we just need to sh we just need to shut up just stop talking don't say a word i was talking to my wife and i was i was like man i should have said something when that guy's when he said all that stuff but i i couldn't and there's been other times where someone has said one little thing and i've had all this stuff to say that just lined right up and i told her you know i was like you know what i i need to not feel bad because god didn't want me to say anything because the bible says do not fear i will put the words in your mouth in the time that you need to say it not every time that you talk to somebody you need to say explain the doctrine of the of the godhead and the serpent see and all this stuff sometimes you just need to say you know what my life was a mess [Music] and then i found christ and now it's not that's the simple truth of the gospel now i'm destined for something call it what you want call it fantasy but it changed my life you find me something that will change that can change your life i'll move on to that but you can't no you can't there's nothing out there that can bring you the change that you need it can bring you the victory you need that's like that's the theme of the world we live in you know make a better body make a better mind everybody's trying to get better that you can go and every bookshelf and bars and nobles or every book starts all these books about how to make you better and i had to be honest i got caught up in that i was and there's some good stuff out there there's some good stuff that god can give you you can glean from that that anywhere people versus somewhere people came from a book like that and um you can clean stuff on that but i got really caught up in it and and god just just took me through that that season and i came up the other side and i realized you know there's some good in that but it's not all about that and i started to look at the man who was telling me to read all these books and he had all these books on every shelf in his in it and every shelf but he didn't have the life that he said he did message message believer message believer because he didn't have a life that he said he did because of the books or because of the message oh he could quote the message he could quote the books he his list of books he read i'll never accomplish maybe i don't know [Music] but he didn't there was no life there was no life so all that didn't hit no good that's all i'm trying to say praise the lord [Music] we hear about the wars keep famine in the land there's questions in the children's eyes trouble in the east again the world is shaking there's no sure place to stand and mournful sounds are heard throughout the land oh but i keep listening for a different sound [Music] [Applause] with the groom why keep listening i keep listening i keep listening [Music] i remember the preacher saying it shall come to pass there will come a generation and that will be the last i can't believe i'm standing here seeing the end of time and the preacher's voice echoing in my [Applause] [Music] the sound of the bride being united with the group i keep listening i keep listening i keep [Music] [Applause] [Music] glory to the lamb i keep listening i keep listening i keep listening [Applause] [Music] the sound of the bride being united with the groom the sound of the chorusing glory to the lamb i [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] heavenly father lord jesus we thank you for for that different sound oh down for the ages they longed the hearing they searched for it they tried for it but god in this age of sound came forth pure unadulterated revelation of you father lord that sound that we've received now gives us the ability under the anointing of christ to live a life fully surrendered to you jesus your redemptions planned father has manifested and now in the age that we stand here we can stand in the chaos and the noise of the world but our life will push forth the sound of christ it's a different sound but lord it's a sound of the purity it's a sound of confidence in the word not of arrogance but of confidence that your word said so we shall do father we thank you lord jesus may you put energy and inspiration to your people for the remainder of the week lord jesus father that we would be conditioned lord we will be ready father lord if there's something you're fixing to do and someone here tonight in their life father a form that you're trying to turn father awaken us lord may our eyes be be clear and focused on you our hearts be prepared father if you ask us to turn a corner that will be ready lord jesus father i believe that we will but as we stand in the position that you have called us to be in father that we can fulfill the great plan that you have of christ in us the hope of glory we thank you father for redemption is the whole story thank you lord jesus we commit ourselves into your hands now pray once again for our pastor his family lord and just touch them lord in this time and the family that's not serving you as well lord the whole thing everyone involved in grace comfort father healing lord jesus we ask we love you lord we thank you for jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] just you know sometimes wednesday night sometimes when you're as a preacher you study something and you feel like it's going to be evangelistic but i've learned in the short time that i've been preaching that sometimes for the local church you just sit down and just have a nice meal together so i hope that uh spoke to your heart tonight but um what i'm trying to say is it's just a nice atmosphere tonight just a nice atmosphere i feel like this is the perfect song to sing uh as we as we go home we're gonna go to bed um because and not only is it not not as it uh not is it always the wind the earthquake and the fire but it's that still small voice that peace that rolls over you and the last few days that i've had the fast day that i had i just want his peace to wash over me let's sing this song amen [Music] when peace [Music] oh [Music] me to say [Applause]
