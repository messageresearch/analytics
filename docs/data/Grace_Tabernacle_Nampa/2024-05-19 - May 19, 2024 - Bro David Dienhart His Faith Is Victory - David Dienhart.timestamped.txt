[33:02] How Sweet the
[33:04] Sound he said well bless God old brother
[33:06] Brandon made
[33:08] it whether I met him in that cabin or
[33:10] not but I met him in the cabin and I was
[33:12] sitting across the table from him a
[33:15] round table he was sitting at the head
[33:17] and a setting just caddy corner from him
[33:19] we were fellowshipping in the
[33:22] word I'll never forget those
[33:26] eyes look just like he look through you
[33:29] well he was not brother Brandon brother
[33:31] sister you know what I'm talking about
[33:34] it wasn't the revelation of brother
[33:36] brandom it was a son of man revealing
[33:38] the son of man God was using the man
[33:41] we're not feeding upon the a man we're
[33:44] feeding upon the body word of the son of
[33:46] man and where that carcass is there the
[33:49] Eagles are gathered the word for the
[33:52] season
[33:53] that's brother brandom asked me he said
[33:56] what are we to be like David what are we
[33:58] to be like Brother
[34:00] David I looked at him I'm just a young
[34:03] man of 18 put my head down and raised
[34:06] the back up
[34:08] and he said to be like
[34:13] Jesus that's my
[34:17] desire that's what I want to
[34:21] be I want his
[34:24] character I want his life to be
[34:26] manifested
[34:28] [Music]
[34:30] is that your desire this
[34:32] morning I believe it is you wouldn't be
[34:35] here God brought you
[34:37] here Satan tried to do everything he
[34:39] could to stop this message from me
[34:41] bringing it this morning but he can't
[34:43] stop
[34:45] it if the message doesn't become flesh
[34:49] it's left on words on page it's got to
[34:52] become flesh in
[34:54] you got to become flesh in me
[34:58] that's who he's taking in a Rapture is
[35:04] himself amen he's taking himself he's
[35:08] got a little bride and that bride is
[35:13] himself I pulled up notes I
[35:17] had things I've written down for a month

[36:04] [Music]
[36:09] him so I couldn't even print out my
[36:12] notes this
[36:14] morning so I thought well I'll just
[36:16] bring the
[36:17] computer so I brought the computer cuz I
[36:21] it's on the table I have it printed out
[36:23] I saved it so I get in here and it wants
[36:25] to update now
[36:28] so the computer starts to update then it
[36:30] can't
[36:32] update and so it begins to unchange what
[36:35] it couldn't
[36:38] update and I've had that problem now for
[36:40] the last three or four times it's not
[36:42] updating not updating so I waited and
[36:44] waited these brothers know what I'm

[37:00] that's right that's right I know the
[37:03] message's on my heart God saying why
[37:06] don't you just preach what's on your

[39:15] computer I know you gave me those
[39:18] thoughts this morning but Lord I'm not
[39:20] depending on
[39:23] that I may not have a quote to go to but
[39:26] I've got it in my heart
[39:28] and I'm going to speak by your grace
[39:30] what your Prophet has already
[39:32] said and Lord let it be so you bring
[39:35] back to my remembrance in those hours of
[39:37] prayer that I've been in prayer to you
[39:39] and how you quickened your word and how
[39:41] your mercies are new Every
[39:43] Morning Lord I've just been so happy so
[39:48] much joy may you express now the joy
[39:50] it's in my heart express it to your
[39:53] people I'm depending on you now in thy
[39:56] name the Lord Jesus Jesus
[39:58] Christ
[40:00] amen amen while you're standing turn
[40:02] with me in your Bibles to First
[40:08] John forgive me if I snipple and snuff
[40:14] and something about
[40:17] preaching causes my nose to
[40:21] run I guess it's just
[40:24] the maybe the anointing maybe the
[40:28] inspiration it's like
[40:30] heating Mexican
[40:33] food my nose always
[40:36] runs maybe it gets good and hot and I
[40:40] like it hot and I pray that this word
[40:42] gets good and hot in your heart begins
[40:45] to melt away the old
[40:48] man and we turn our Reliance upon him
[40:52] because if you can't rely on him who are
[40:53] you relying upon who are you going to
[40:56] rely upon
[41:01] you can't make a Rapture in your
[41:03] reasoning you can't come to a body
[41:06] change in a mental conception it's got
[41:09] to be a divine revelation given by
[41:13] God he's the only one that can reveal
[41:19] it amen first John 5 let's begin let's
[41:22] read verse
[41:25] four my title this morning is his
[41:30] faith his
[41:32] victory his
[41:35] faith his
[41:39] victory for whatsoever is born of
[41:44] God overcometh the
[41:47] world that's pretty
[41:49] straightforward whoever is born of
[41:52] God how are you going to be born of God
[41:55] unless you were a part of God
[42:00] to be born of God is to be a part of him
[42:04] in him before the world
[42:07] began and how do you say how do I know
[42:09] that because your heart's desire is him
[42:14] yes when you hear the
[42:16] truth you want more of
[42:18] it when you hear the truth of the word
[42:21] for the season you've got to have more
[42:23] of it amen you want more of it your
[42:25] heart's desire is more of of it
[42:30] amen for whatsoever is born of God what
[42:34] would they be if they were born of God
[42:36] if God brought something of himself who
[42:37] would it
[42:40] be it would be
[42:43] himself that's right so whosoever is
[42:47] born of God overcometh the world Cosmos
[42:50] World Order
[42:53] systems and this is the victory that
[42:57] overcometh the world even our
[43:02] faith Ephesians chapter 2
[43:30] chapter 2 verse one and you hath he
[43:34] quickened now we heard the message
[43:37] Wednesday night you that were here the
[43:39] real
[43:42] you now brother Chris didn't know I had
[43:45] this on my
[43:47] heart and I'm expecting God to bring
[43:49] what's on my
[43:51] heart but I've had this on my heart over
[43:53] a month and I don't know how long he had
[43:55] it on his heart but this is true truth
[43:57] that you heard and been
[43:59] hearing who it is that you really
[44:05] are and you who's that you there well
[44:09] they say it's all of you yes it is but
[44:11] there's a part of him part of you that's
[44:14] you that's him that he
[44:16] quickens then when he's quickened that
[44:19] part it'll Quicken your whole mortal
[44:22] body and bring it subject to the word is
[44:25] that right absolutely
[44:27] because he
[44:28] said he that raised up Jesus from the
[44:31] dead dwell in you Romans 8:11 he that
[44:35] dwelleth in you he that raised up Christ
[44:37] shall also if that same spirit that
[44:39] raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[44:42] he that raised up Christ shall also
[44:44] Quicken your mortal
[44:47] Body by his
[44:50] Spirit Same
[44:53] Spirit that quickened him will Quicken
[44:56] you and bring it subject to the word
[45:00] amen so he that raised up the anointed
[45:02] word in you unveiled himself in you will
[45:04] also take your mortal body and bring it
[45:06] subject to the word amen all right and
[45:11] so and you ha the quickened who were
[45:13] dead in trespasses and sin where in time
[45:16] past you walked according to the course
[45:17] of this world according to the prince
[45:20] and the power of the air the spirit that
[45:21] now worketh in the children of
[45:24] Disobedience I want to jump down here
[45:27] verse four but God who is rich in Mercy
[45:29] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[45:32] when did he love
[45:33] you before you could even love him or
[45:36] even know how to love him he loved you
[45:39] Jacob I loved Esau I hated why because
[45:41] Jacob was the seed seed of who seed of
[45:45] God all
[45:50] right so even when we were dead in sins
[45:54] hath quickened us together with Christ
[45:58] with
[45:59] who where's your ident identification
[46:03] then
[46:05] Christ even when we were dead in sins
[46:08] hath quickened us together with Christ
[46:10] you were in him see you were in him when
[46:11] he come to this earth all that God was
[46:13] he poured into Christ you were
[46:18] there by grace are ye saved so it's not
[46:23] by works is it it's not by your works
[46:26] it's not by by anything you could do or
[46:28] even try to do God saved you before the
[46:32] foundation of the world he already
[46:33] placed you in Christ and saved you when
[46:36] you went to Calvary you were saved
[46:38] there before the foundation of the world
[46:41] he saw you saved before the foundation
[46:43] of the world God wanted to be
[46:46] bride did you hear what I said not have
[46:49] a bride he wanted to be bride
[46:52] amen yes to have a bride but he wanted
[46:56] to be Bri he had an attribute to be
[46:59] bride he had an attribute to be father
[47:02] he had an attribute to be husband he had
[47:04] an attribute to be wife had an attribute
[47:06] to be bride so it takes it completely
[47:09] out of your hands it's God's
[47:13] achievement amen whatever God does you
[47:16] never had a thing to you didn't put your
[47:18] hand in it you come in this world
[47:20] speaking lies you had you had you I'm
[47:23] talking about your your hand physical I
[47:25] mean not talking about your body body
[47:27] your your own physical flesh you the man
[47:30] didn't have anything to do with
[47:33] this it was God doing it all of
[47:42] it by grace are you saved verse six and
[47:45] hath raised us up together and made us
[47:47] sit together in Heavenly places in
[47:49] Christ Jesus while you're going through
[47:51] turmoil you're sitting in Heavenly
[47:53] places while you feel like you're
[47:55] defeated and you're you're going through
[47:57] pressures and you're nervous and yet
[47:59] you're
[48:00] peaceful simultaneously at the same
[48:03] time part of
[48:05] you has already
[48:08] risen the real you has already
[48:12] raised amen and here you are going
[48:14] through trials and stress and heartaches
[48:17] and yet all the time alive already
[48:20] raised and seated in Heavenly places in
[48:22] Christ prise the lord two Natures in the
[48:25] same body
[48:27] one God recognizes the other because of
[48:30] the blood he recognizes the blood his
[48:31] own life he does not recognize the
[48:35] other Hallelujah the outer man no good
[48:39] the inner
[48:41] man being the seed being the word
[48:44] quickened is life eternal
[48:48] life amen so you say Brother David how
[48:51] can I be seated in Heavenly places in
[48:53] Christ Jesus and at the same time going
[48:55] through trials and test and feel like
[49:00] nothing because you have a dual you have
[49:03] that dual
[49:07] Duality did you know that you are you're
[49:09] a duel nature you're you have a twin
[49:14] that's against
[49:15] you amen but you have the word and you
[49:19] are the word and you're the Living Word
[49:21] on the
[49:24] inside of the inside
[49:28] so and hath raised us up together made
[49:30] us sit together in Heavenly places in
[49:32] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he
[49:34] might show the exceeding Riches of his
[49:36] grace in his kindness toward us through
[49:39] Christ Jesus for he for by grace are you
[49:42] saved through
[49:44] faith and that not of yourselves it is
[49:49] the gift of God you may be seated what
[49:53] is the gift of God
[49:57] eternal life the gift of God is Faith
[50:00] that's exactly right brother Brandon
[50:02] made a statement on perfect Faith
[50:03] paragraph 68 he said he said the
[50:07] believer
[50:09] is he said if you can just recognize
[50:11] yourself a Believer and know that you're
[50:13] a Believer he said and rely upon what
[50:15] you are as a Believer he said the
[50:18] believer is the faith of God that moves
[50:23] in
[50:25] you the believer is the faith of God
[50:28] that moves in
[50:31] you the believer is the revelation of
[50:35] God the substance of
[50:37] himself because faith is the substance
[50:40] of things hoped for the evidence of
[50:42] Things Not
[50:43] Seen amen you are the faith of God the
[50:47] believer is the very Faith Of God you

[56:46] God is
[56:47] what light and in
[56:50] him well who's in him in him is no

[56:59] about the cloud ring he said look at
[57:00] he's looking to the right to the thief
[57:02] he he that he
[57:05] um saved on the cross pardon and he's
[57:09] looking but he said watch that light
[57:11] that comes from me you ever see that
[57:14] cloud ring and see the the light that
[57:16] comes from him he said we'll walk in
[57:18] that light then what are we to walk in
[57:21] that light we have to be the children of

[57:34] light when he when he when he come in
[57:37] the earth he was the fullness of the
[57:38] godhead bodily then you had to be in him
[57:40] then to be in him
[57:43] now you had to be in him
[57:47] then and when he rose from the grave and
[57:50] conquered death you conquered it then
[57:53] it's not I hope I make it you've done
[57:54] made it you've already made
[57:57] it if Christ made it you made it but
[58:01] what is lacking the revelation of it our
[58:03] brother said what's lacking you have the
[58:05] power God's given you the power but
[58:07] what's lacking the Revelation to move
[58:09] that power to use that power so what are
[58:12] we asking for more than anything else is
[58:15] revelation he
[58:16] said that what the prophet said that's
[58:19] exactly what he said he said the power
[58:21] the revelation of the word cannot be
[58:23] overemphasized your need of Revelation
[58:27] amen cannot be
[58:30] overemphasized amen then who's going to
[58:33] be who is it going to be in this hour
[58:34] that's going to have the revelation of
[58:36] himself and the revelation of herself
[58:39] being himself where's that going to be
[58:42] it's going to be in his bride then
[58:44] what's going to be her headship what's
[58:45] going to be her guide what's going to be
[58:47] the very thing she becomes the Little
[58:49] Wheel in the middle of the
[58:52] wheel you cannot lean upon the outward
[58:55] man to lead you you cannot lean upon
[58:58] your reasoning to lead you you cannot
[59:00] lean upon your feelings to lead you amen
[59:04] one of the great mysteries of God in
[59:06] this hour that brother brandom in the
[59:08] message is this the end sir he said's
[59:11] asking God is this the time of the end
[59:14] sir he said he talked about those
[59:18] Mysteries and he said he said now by
[59:20] God's help the angel let me let me add
[59:23] to what he was reading what the the
[59:24] major Mysteries were he said now by the
[59:27] help of God and and by the by the grace
[59:29] of that angel of this hour and that's
[59:31] not exact words but I'm just saying what
[59:33] he said he said now he said let me
[59:36] express some of the other mystery he
[59:38] said one of them is the mystery of the
[59:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[59:43] sensation how many remember that it's
[59:46] not man's working it's not a sensation
[59:49] it's not how much you jumped and how
[59:50] much you shouted that is no not the
[59:53] evidence of you having the Holy Ghost
[59:55] how many know know the prophet talking
[59:56] about 1 Corinthians the 12th chapter
[59:59] said all these great workings of gifts
[1:00:01] and all these Miracles and all these
[1:00:02] things are the working of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:04] but it's not the evidence that the he's
[1:00:06] indwelling you you can have those things
[1:00:09] and still be lost and go to hell what
[1:00:13] takes the difference the difference is
[1:00:15] the unveiling of himself in you because
[1:00:17] he planted himself in
[1:00:20] you I want you to know something I want
[1:00:23] you to know that the germ and the Egg
[1:00:25] the ground and the Egg and The Germ is
[1:00:27] all him it has nothing to do with you as
[1:00:31] a person it's him when I saw that I
[1:00:35] about had a jubilee and about flew
[1:00:38] because you try to make you think well
[1:00:39] there's got to be something about me
[1:00:41] then if I'm the egg and he and you say
[1:00:43] well that was predestinated that's
[1:00:44] exactly right but you're getting part of
[1:00:46] the picture he's himself that egg and
[1:00:50] that ground he himself was The Germ of
[1:00:53] life to meet it it's revealing of
[1:00:56] himself by himself coming to
[1:01:00] himself see it takes the man completely
[1:01:02] out of the picture completely away thank
[1:01:06] you Lord you have total Victory if we
[1:01:09] just realize the victory we have in the
[1:01:12] position than where we are standing your
[1:01:14] stand in him is perfect your leadership
[1:01:17] of him is perfect prise the Lord his way
[1:01:20] is your
[1:01:22] way so who is it there that contraries
[1:01:25] you every time time you start to do
[1:01:27] something evil is present who's that
[1:01:29] evil Paul said in re Romans 7 oh
[1:01:32] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[1:01:36] me from this corruptness who's going to
[1:01:38] deliver me that I thank God through
[1:01:39] Jesus
[1:01:41] Christ I live by his mind I don't live
[1:01:44] by this mind I live by his mind
[1:01:46] Hallelujah he said walk in the spirit
[1:01:48] and you'll not fulfill the lust of the
[1:01:50] flesh that's right let's go to that just
[1:01:53] a minute in Galatians let's turn over
[1:01:56] here to Galatians just a
[1:02:00] minute and let's look at Galatians here
[1:02:03] just a few scriptures let me
[1:02:05] just read this he said verse I think
[1:02:09] it's verse 26 here remember the law and
[1:02:12] I just back to verse 24 the and now I'm
[1:02:14] talking about 3:24 he said wherefore the
[1:02:17] law was our school Master to bring us
[1:02:18] unto Christ that we might be justified
[1:02:21] by
[1:02:21] faith what was this our school Master
[1:02:24] the law because the law only showed you
[1:02:26] that you were a sinner you couldn't it
[1:02:28] only condemned you because you couldn't
[1:02:30] keep the
[1:02:32] law that right and every time you failed
[1:02:35] there it was right in your face and you
[1:02:37] couldn't do anything about it you had no
[1:02:38] release from it there it was but God
[1:02:41] allowed it to be covered but the Christ
[1:02:44] that died on the calvary wasn't a
[1:02:45] covering it annihilated
[1:02:48] it are you with me the blood annihilated
[1:02:51] that that curse but he took the law amen
[1:02:56] you're not under the law anymore if
[1:02:58] you're in Christ you're not under the
[1:02:59] law you're under Faith which is the
[1:03:01] Royal seed which is what Abraham's own
[1:03:04] seed which is Christ himself in
[1:03:09] you amen amen amen because we have the
[1:03:12] faith we have the revelation of God this
[1:03:16] is our stand this is who we are this is
[1:03:20] what's moving inside of
[1:03:23] us the believer is what are we talking
[1:03:26] about a True
[1:03:28] Believer you're a True Believer Christ
[1:03:31] has identified you he's given you his
[1:03:33] ring he's given you the clothing he's
[1:03:35] provided everything you need for that
[1:03:37] meeting in the air and he's come and
[1:03:39] provided it all he's given you the
[1:03:41] identification he's identified you the
[1:03:43] token of his own life identifies you in
[1:03:46] him then quit your worrying about what
[1:03:49] the flesh feels how it feels your
[1:03:52] mistakes and failures has nothing to do
[1:03:55] with that Inside
[1:03:58] Man where is your identification it's in
[1:04:02] him it's that inner man it's that inside
[1:04:05] man there's an outside and an inside man
[1:04:07] how many know the word said it and the
[1:04:09] prophet said
[1:04:11] it said quit listening to the outer man
[1:04:15] and take what he said in the Inside Man
[1:04:16] the Simplicity of faith God said it I
[1:04:19] believe it he's proven it he's
[1:04:21] identified me in him and that settles it
[1:04:23] I raised with him when he raised from
[1:04:25] the dead I rose up Victorious over all
[1:04:27] death all mistakes all failures all
[1:04:30] feelings all senses I conquered it all
[1:04:34] Darkness I've I've resurrected out of
[1:04:37] Darkness the wave sheath of the maturity
[1:04:39] of the word and its fullness is way back
[1:04:41] over the people in this hour with a
[1:04:43] firstborn coming up
[1:04:47] manifesting the fullness the maturity of
[1:04:50] the word how many know that today that
[1:04:52] wave sheath has identified you in him
[1:04:56] waved over you that you've got to come
[1:04:59] to that full Revelation you've got to
[1:05:01] come to that maturity and when the word
[1:05:03] opened up it came out brother sister
[1:05:06] listen the Pentecostal message was the
[1:05:09] the birthing it was the baby stage but
[1:05:12] you had to have a message of maturity
[1:05:14] come forth in this hour a corner had to
[1:05:16] be turned and what the Pentecost
[1:05:19] producer made wait for was the Holy
[1:05:21] Ghost himself to come right down back to
[1:05:24] the perfect world again back to himself
[1:05:27] again how is he standing here in this
[1:05:30] day it's himself in the bride form it's
[1:05:33] himself as a bride What's the Word of

[1:05:39] made manifest in the formation of his
[1:05:44] bride go back to things that are to be
[1:05:46] it's exactly what he
[1:05:48] said what are we seeing we're seeing the
[1:05:51] word manifested in the formation of his
[1:05:54] bride amen
[1:05:57] these things had to come through a
[1:05:58] prophet first these things had to be
[1:06:00] spoken by a prophet first but who's here
[1:06:02] to receive the
[1:06:04] message if you can receive the message
[1:06:06] you are the
[1:06:08] message

[1:06:36] that's right but
[1:06:41] why oh well he's in the bride bless God
[1:06:43] he's in the bride how is he in the
[1:06:48] bride what makes him in the bride
[1:06:51] because God listen he met the Catholic
[1:06:55] priest there's three or four quotes on
[1:06:58] this he met the Catholic priest said God
[1:07:01] brother brandom God is in his church and
[1:07:04] everybody here would say amen that's
[1:07:06] exactly
[1:07:08] right we've said it over and over again
[1:07:10] God is in his church you believe that
[1:07:12] his church is the Bride of course the
[1:07:14] Catholic priest wasn't talking about
[1:07:16] that but he was still saying God's in
[1:07:18] his
[1:07:18] church and we say God is in his church
[1:07:21] brother Bram said no he said God is in
[1:07:24] his word
[1:07:26] amen help that to strike Lord how is he
[1:07:31] in the bride because the word's in
[1:07:36] you then you've already made
[1:07:41] it he's perfect so are
[1:07:44] you he's sinless so are you I'm talking
[1:07:48] about the real you brother Chris we're
[1:07:51] talking about the real you the real gift
[1:07:54] what is the real gift it's your soul
[1:07:56] down there that's the real gift
[1:07:59] Hallelujah that's eternal life that's
[1:08:02] who you are that's what God sees that's
[1:08:05] what he
[1:08:06] recognizes he's already conquered the
[1:08:09] curse of the law and mistakes and
[1:08:11] failures you're going to make them
[1:08:12] you're going to have them but if you
[1:08:14] don't even want to do them and when you
[1:08:17] have them that doesn't move that inside
[1:08:19] of the inside Revelation and unveiling
[1:08:22] of Christ it will not move that it can't
[1:08:25] move that it's unmovable you've received
[1:08:28] a kingdom which cannot be moved what is
[1:08:30] the kingdom it's the word unveiled in
[1:08:32] you what is the kingdom it's God's word
[1:08:35] Made Alive made life in you
[1:08:41] yes there's no defeat in that do you
[1:08:43] realize the bride cannot be
[1:08:47] defeated why she is the word
[1:08:57] that's why she can't be defeated that's
[1:08:59] why she can't come that's why I mean she
[1:09:01] can be deceived she can't be deceived
[1:09:05] why because the discerner is in her
[1:09:07] she's a part of the discerner she's in
[1:09:09] the word and the word can't be
[1:09:11] deceived I'm not talking about how much
[1:09:13] you carry a Bible around and how much
[1:09:15] you intellectually know what this says
[1:09:18] is it revealed in you that's the next
[1:09:22] thing the word the word itself
[1:09:27] is your Victory the word itself is your
[1:09:30] conqueror the word itself is your
[1:09:32] strength oh you say Brother David but
[1:09:34] that's not for me what makes you think
[1:09:37] it's not for you you're either going to
[1:09:38] say it's not for you or the inside's
[1:09:40] going to say it
[1:09:41] is then quit yielding to your flesh and
[1:09:44] to your past and to all your mistakes
[1:09:46] and what this person thinks and that
[1:09:47] person think get over your
[1:09:50] complex get over that fear he hasn't
[1:09:53] given you the spirit of fear
[1:09:56] but of power amen he's given you
[1:09:59] Faith then accept Faith go back to the
[1:10:02] word you'll find faith in the word you
[1:10:05] won't find it anywhere else your Victory
[1:10:07] lays in that faith that revelation of
[1:10:10] that word in you that's your Victory and
[1:10:12] it comes by hearing the
[1:10:16] word not by your works not by your
[1:10:18] failures not by your ups and down I fail
[1:10:21] every day you backslide every day that
[1:10:23] has nothing to do with that inside the
[1:10:26] inside still has peace the inside still
[1:10:28] seated in Heavenly places the inside
[1:10:30] still in Victory it's amazing you can
[1:10:33] have peace when you're in
[1:10:36] turmoil at the same
[1:10:39] time you just don't think that's PA look
[1:10:41] at Paul why outside he's despicable he's
[1:10:44] he bent over a little old Hunchback got
[1:10:46] welts in his back why but his words are
[1:10:53] powerful see he was one thing out
[1:10:55] outside but Paul never said follow the
[1:10:59] outside it doesn't matter what people
[1:11:02] think about
[1:11:05] you it doesn't matter what David thinks
[1:11:08] about
[1:11:10] me and David's going to give his reason
[1:11:13] why it can't be why it can't be why I
[1:11:15] can't do this why I can't do that I can
[1:11:17] do all things through Christ which
[1:11:19] strength
[1:11:21] me I am victorious over this I have
[1:11:24] conquered this your enemy is yourself
[1:11:27] the old selfman that's your enemy and
[1:11:29] he's defeated do you understand he's
[1:11:32] defeated
[1:11:35] huah you say well he is for today right
[1:11:37] now no he is all the time when you've
[1:11:39] met him he met you because the word was
[1:11:42] in you ready to be quickened Hallelujah
[1:11:45] and how could the word be in you then
[1:11:47] and not be in the
[1:11:50] word how could you how could the word be
[1:11:52] in you and you not be a part of the word
[1:11:55] how are you a part of the word you were
[1:11:57] the very substance of his own thoughts
[1:11:59] you were active you were you were alive
[1:12:01] you were in his mind and he said I've
[1:12:03] got to express it and when he expressed
[1:12:05] it you were that word and therefore you
[1:12:08] are my Witnesses because St John 15:27
[1:12:12] said you are my Witnesses because you
[1:12:14] were with me from the
[1:12:17] beginning right and in the beginning was
[1:12:19] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:12:22] the Word was God and the word was life
[1:12:26] and the life was the light of
[1:12:30] men and you tell me where the voice is
[1:12:33] you tell me where the word
[1:12:36] is now we're talking different you tell
[1:12:39] me where the word is I'll tell you
[1:12:40] there's
[1:12:43] Christen now he's in a body form he's
[1:12:47] the word you are the
[1:12:52] word amen because the word was ordained
[1:12:56] predestined in you placed in you and God
[1:12:59] did it he said I'm going to be I'm going
[1:13:01] to be that man down there I'm going to
[1:13:03] be David I'm going to be that word I'm
[1:13:05] going to be living in a body of flesh
[1:13:07] called David he's going to be born of
[1:13:09] sinful flesh he's going to be born he's
[1:13:11] going to come in the world speaking lies
[1:13:13] but I've already recognized myself in
[1:13:15] him I've already predestinated when he
[1:13:17] hear that word that inside would come
[1:13:19] alive that inside would be quickened
[1:13:22] that inside would come alive and say
[1:13:24] that's what I am oh I say thank you Lord
[1:13:27] I looked in the mirror and said that's
[1:13:31] me that's
[1:13:35] me how many look in the word with an
[1:13:38] unveiled face and
[1:13:41] say and grow into the same
[1:13:44] image who's
[1:13:46] growing David's dying I just said
[1:13:49] Colossians I I moved off of Colossians
[1:13:51] let me go back to that a minute hold
[1:13:53] that spot Galatians but back to
[1:13:56] Colossians I mean Colossians in verse
[1:14:00] two set your
[1:14:02] affection see you seek those things
[1:14:04] which are above then where's
[1:14:07] above he that humbles himself shall be
[1:14:09] exalted what do you ex what do you
[1:14:11] humbling yourself
[1:14:14] to you humble yourself to who you really
[1:14:18] are you lay down this old man in your
[1:14:20] thinking and Die daily you deny yourself
[1:14:24] deny this
[1:14:26] man did not the prophet say that little
[1:14:30] light was laying inside of me ready to
[1:14:31] be quickened and he said it was
[1:14:33] quickened and then I was born again and
[1:14:35] I'm no longer the son of Charles and
[1:14:37] Ella Branham isn't that right well I'll
[1:14:39] let you know right now I'm no longer the
[1:14:41] son of Bob and Joan dehart I'm a new
[1:14:43] creation I'm a Living Word I'm the
[1:14:45] Living Word that's what I'm relying upon
[1:14:48] I'm not relying upon well my daddy was
[1:14:50] this and my daddy is that therefore I'm
[1:14:51] doing this and that's why no no I let go
[1:14:54] I have to deny that and take that word
[1:14:57] there is my identification there's who I
[1:14:59] am that's the real
[1:15:06] me that's the one that has peace like a
[1:15:10] river that's the one that's settled
[1:15:14] that's the one that's already risen and
[1:15:16] conquered death hell and the
[1:15:20] grave who is it who is it that's that
[1:15:23] word inside of me that word's come alive
[1:15:26] and I recognize my stand my stand is in
[1:15:29] him my stand is perfect then I stand
[1:15:32] before him perfect I stand before him
[1:15:34] sinless I stand before him absolutely
[1:15:37] complete the Bible said I'm complete in
[1:15:39] him now either you are or not it depends
[1:15:42] on where you want to put your
[1:15:46] trust depends on who you want to trust
[1:15:49] where are you putting your
[1:15:51] trust on the outer man or that inner man
[1:15:55] that birthed word that new creation a
[1:15:59] what are you what are you on the inside
[1:16:01] you are a spoken word
[1:16:06] creation that's how he birthed his son a
[1:16:09] spoken word creation he was both egg and
[1:16:12] he was germ had nothing to do with
[1:16:14] Joseph had nothing to do with Mary I an

[1:16:40] who I am and it wasn't a public show
[1:16:43] either and neither is it now amen but
[1:16:46] it's the seventh seal opened and I am
[1:16:49] that seal revealed
[1:16:55] the secret is made known and that secret
[1:16:58] has been unveiled inside of me and I
[1:17:00] hold that
[1:17:01] secret and it's worth more than any
[1:17:04] precious gold you could ever ask for I
[1:17:06] don't care what it is it's eternal life
[1:17:08] and I say let us yield ourselves
[1:17:10] completely let us skip ourselves over
[1:17:12] completely no more let us walk by the
[1:17:15] dictates of our outer man let's walk by
[1:17:17] the dictates of that unveiled unveiled
[1:17:19] mystery of God himself in
[1:17:23] you amen amen amen amen God help us

[1:17:32] faith and what is his victory if you are
[1:17:35] his victory which you are he said the
[1:17:37] bride is his very Victory then where is
[1:17:40] his faith
[1:17:42] you then that Faith becomes the Royal
[1:17:44] seed and you are royal seed and your
[1:17:48] promise was to be here in this age what
[1:17:50] is the promise it would be Christ
[1:17:52] himself not another it would be Christ
[1:17:55] himself veiled behind skin yours and
[1:17:58] mine a skin of failure a skin of faults
[1:18:01] a skin of everything about it but God
[1:18:03] said I've conquered and I'll put my I'll
[1:18:06] put my spirit inside of you I'll wash it
[1:18:08] bring it back subject to the word I Am
[1:18:10] The Germ and I am the I'm the very G I
[1:18:14] mean you are the I'm the gene of life
[1:18:16] I'm the germ and I am that egg that
[1:18:18] would receive it
[1:18:21] amen that ground that I predestinated to
[1:18:24] receive
[1:18:26] it do you get the
[1:18:28] picture that ought to set you absolutely
[1:18:32] free you had nothing to do in this that
[1:18:35] ought to turn your hearts and your
[1:18:37] ambition and your thoughts
[1:18:40] heavenward amen you had not one thing to
[1:18:43] do with knowing him you say if I could
[1:18:45] just get enough works if I could do
[1:18:47] enough things you can't do enough to do
[1:18:48] anything your ways are dead your ways it
[1:18:51] says it right here he said for you're
[1:18:53] dead

[1:19:00] affection where is our
[1:19:04] affections are we walking by faith he
[1:19:06] said the just shall live by faith just
[1:19:09] who the Justified the declared righteous
[1:19:11] that I've declared in my word to be
[1:19:13] righteous they shall live by my
[1:19:17] faith he's got to fulfill his word
[1:19:20] brother sister you realize God can't
[1:19:22] speak a word and not fulfill it there's
[1:19:24] got there got to be somebody here to
[1:19:25] fulfill that
[1:19:30] scripture one of them I'm one of them
[1:19:33] how do you know Brother David because
[1:19:35] what is revealed to me lines up this
[1:19:37] word and becomes alive to me it becomes
[1:19:39] the message of the hour it's the
[1:19:43] revelation God is Sovereign with that
[1:19:46] Revelation well give it to me I couldn't
[1:19:47] give it to you if you
[1:19:49] wanted but I'll tell you where you can
[1:19:51] go get it
[1:19:58] amen that's right it's in the word and
[1:20:02] if the word's not in you you can say all
[1:20:04] you want about Christ being in you but
[1:20:05] if that word's not in there and you're
[1:20:07] not recognizing the word for the hour
[1:20:09] something's wrong you're not truly born
[1:20:13] again you can act like it you can feel
[1:20:16] like it but the new birth is without
[1:20:19] sensation it's a divine revelation given
[1:20:22] by God himself in you that quickens that
[1:20:25] word to life you say well is there a
[1:20:27] feeling yes but that's no evidence you
[1:20:29] ever got
[1:20:31] it well I weeped I teared I did this I
[1:20:34] spoke in tongues I prophesied you can
[1:20:36] have all those things and still not be a
[1:20:39] child of God you can dress right you can
[1:20:41] let your hair grow out you can do
[1:20:43] everything you want to do with it and
[1:20:45] still not be a child of God you can have
[1:20:47] the baptism of your Holy Ghost every day
[1:20:49] of your life and go to hell because
[1:20:51] you're a Triune being and that little
[1:20:53] man on the inside is either that word or
[1:20:55] it isn't that word it's the seed or it
[1:20:57] isn't the
[1:21:00] seed amen your spirit man your second
[1:21:03] realm can be Anointed with that spirit
[1:21:05] filled with that spirit and still miss
[1:21:08] it because you can't recognize you can't
[1:21:10] live you can't accept the word for the
[1:21:13] season when it's preached in
[1:21:16] faith that ouer man's going to reason
[1:21:18] and I don't care it can be living and
[1:21:20] alive and it is alive in me still that
[1:21:22] outer man of David
[1:21:25] try to reason this out re why is this
[1:21:27] happening well I don't understand why
[1:21:28] this is happening I don't understand why
[1:21:30] my computer's going
[1:21:32] down I don't understand why this has got
[1:21:34] to happen this way because God's trying
[1:21:36] to teach David to quit relying upon
[1:21:38] computers quit relying upon the man's
[1:21:41] side and take me at my word am I not
[1:21:43] able I brought it to your attention
[1:21:45] yesterday when you were out there on
[1:21:47] that trail I brought it to you I
[1:21:48] revealed it to you can I not come back
[1:21:50] and do it
[1:21:52] again then where is our
[1:21:57] dependency where is your dependency is
[1:22:00] it on things is it on your reasoning is
[1:22:03] it not your feelings your UPS your Downs
[1:22:06] your mistakes your
[1:22:08] failures
[1:22:12] no if you want to look back at your
[1:22:14] mistakes and failures you're not you're
[1:22:15] telling me God's not big enough to take
[1:22:17] care of the
[1:22:22] matter well I know this and I forget
[1:22:25] what you know what does God say about it
[1:22:28] what does his word say about it where's
[1:22:30] your
[1:22:31] absolute you're reasoning with the word
[1:22:35] reasoning well this is Happ because this
[1:22:36] has happened because I did this and
[1:22:38] because of that this is going to happen
[1:22:39] forget your reasoning what's the word
[1:22:42] say then the simple faith that I'm
[1:22:44] talking about will take God at his word
[1:22:47] no other opinion about
[1:22:52] it no other s with it I I I love to
[1:22:56] shout I love to I love these things but
[1:22:58] that's not the evidence I've got the
[1:23:00] Holy Ghost the evidence is when I see
[1:23:03] this word a promise for this hour
[1:23:05] revealed in me and lived out that's the
[1:23:13] evidence and the carinal man will say
[1:23:15] but I see what you did and I see what
[1:23:16] you didn't do and I saw your mistakes
[1:23:19] and I saw your
[1:23:21] failures that's the devil doing that
[1:23:24] that's not God's word god already
[1:23:26] declared what you are now whether you
[1:23:29] want want to say in your heart Amen to
[1:23:30] it and quit your fretting over it and go
[1:23:36] on that's the
[1:23:38] victory that overcometh the world even
[1:23:42] our
[1:23:43] Revelation God's Own Revelation in
[1:23:47] me my faith our faith our revelation of
[1:23:53] Who We Are
[1:23:56] right amen that's exactly where it lays
[1:23:59] brother
[1:24:01] sister I say we better get desperate
[1:24:03] about it because God God how many know
[1:24:07] God himself the fullness of God and
[1:24:10] embodied Christ
[1:24:14] Jesus and God himself comes right back
[1:24:17] around and embodies himself The Same
[1:24:19] Spirit in the form of his bride
[1:24:24] the same one we've come from the same
[1:24:27] source that he came from same word
[1:24:31] manifested for this hour do you realize
[1:24:33] that the promised word of this hour his
[1:24:35] promised coming would be in Bride
[1:24:38] form you say well what do we look at
[1:24:41] we're waiting for a meeting in the air
[1:24:43] what are we looking for the last one to
[1:24:44] get to a maturity that realizes they're
[1:24:47] the head
[1:24:50] himself you're in Union with that head
[1:24:53] what are we here to manest the capping
[1:24:55] The Headstone
[1:24:58] message what form is it going to be and
[1:25:00] he capped off that bride and said this
[1:25:03] is
[1:25:05] me came right back on that top of that
[1:25:08] pyramid where was that headstone all the
[1:25:10] time where was that Unwritten word of
[1:25:13] Revelations
[1:25:16] 10 you say Unwritten yes John was
[1:25:19] forbidden to write it but brother random
[1:25:21] said don't you think for a minute that's
[1:25:23] not hid in the word in here
[1:25:24] here it's something in the word it's hid
[1:25:27] in the word but it's not going to be
[1:25:29] unknown or made known I mean revealed
[1:25:31] until this end time and that's the
[1:25:33] corner turn unless you turn that
[1:25:37] corner you want to run down the straight
[1:25:39] roll of a Pentecostal message go ahead
[1:25:41] but God has turned the corner
[1:25:44] amen you're not going to be perfected
[1:25:46] under a Pentecostal
[1:25:50] message that's not contrary to what he
[1:25:52] said that's exactly what he said because
[1:25:54] that Pentecostal message which is the is
[1:25:56] the new birth made way for the Holy
[1:25:58] Ghost himself to come right down in
[1:26:00] Perfection back to the word again back
[1:26:02] to the word again back to what the word
[1:26:06] again then where's the word again and
[1:26:08] who's the
[1:26:12] word I am the word you are the word he's
[1:26:15] the word and what is it then it's a
[1:26:17] Oneness of
[1:26:20] unity it's Oneness again you're the word
[1:26:23] and I'm the word guess what we are one
[1:26:25] under one
[1:26:27] headship and when we turn the corner the
[1:26:29] Sun come forth in its strength and we
[1:26:31] have to lay in the presence of that son
[1:26:33] ripening until we ripen into his very
[1:26:36] position his very place his who he is
[1:26:39] what he is that's the
[1:26:42] bride and she's revealing she's
[1:26:44] manifesting the son of man
[1:26:48] again amen that's exactly straight as I
[1:26:52] know how to take it amen amen that no
[1:26:55] reason to jump around on it so it's his
[1:26:57] faith who are you his faith his
[1:27:02] victory you're his faith and you're his
[1:27:09] victory no you say well Brother David
[1:27:12] what your preaching you know that's hard
[1:27:14] to swallow who's hard to swallow
[1:27:17] it this flesh man don't believe
[1:27:22] it but he's brought obedience to
[1:27:25] it because greater is he that is in me
[1:27:29] how about you than he that is in the
[1:27:34] world that inside of the inside man is
[1:27:36] not worldly this inside man I'm talking
[1:27:39] about this real me is perfect it's
[1:27:43] complete it's Christ
[1:27:47] himself right manifested through
[1:27:51] flesh good sounding words isn't it good
[1:27:54] sounding words but where's the
[1:27:56] Revelation pray for Revelation so
[1:27:59] somebody's going to have that as a
[1:28:03] substance well I believe in giving the
[1:28:05] word a right metal attitude then let's
[1:28:07] give it a right metal attitude this
[1:28:08] morning
[1:28:10] yes you think you're hid from what
[1:28:12] you're thinking God knows exactly what
[1:28:14] you're
[1:28:17] thinking amen amen
[1:28:20] amen oh well I can't be that I'll just
[1:28:22] be no you can be that God said you would
[1:28:25] be that God said this is the bride this
[1:28:28] is who she
[1:28:29] is she is the
[1:28:33] Revelation who are you you're Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ

[1:28:41] is Jesus Christ there's no man
[1:28:46] handling in this virgin birth of the
[1:28:49] Bride no manhandling no sensation no man
[1:28:55] handling no denominational man other
[1:28:58] words flesh
[1:29:00] manhandling it's absolutely a working of
[1:29:03] God Perfect by God and she is Jesus
[1:29:06] Christ the same yesterday and today why'
[1:29:09] he repeat that so many
[1:29:12] times because that's who you
[1:29:18] are can we walk forward now from this
[1:29:22] service
[1:29:26] recognizing walking at a higher plane
[1:29:29] than you come in here
[1:29:31] on recognizing you're a
[1:29:38] conqueror am you're a
[1:29:41] conqueror you're more than a
[1:29:45] conqueror how can I say how can I be
[1:29:47] more than a conqueror I always liked a
[1:29:49] minister many years ago had said you
[1:29:50] remember Muhammad
[1:29:52] Ali A priz fighter he said he was a
[1:29:56] prize fighter he was the he was the
[1:29:59] champion but every bit of that thousands
[1:30:02] he got guess what he went back and gave
[1:30:04] it to his
[1:30:07] wife that's that was what he said I go
[1:30:10] back and put it in the hands of my wife
[1:30:12] she takes care of
[1:30:13] it okay then she's more than a
[1:30:20] conqueror she partook of what he
[1:30:22] possessed yeah and become her possession
[1:30:25] yeah that's exactly what he's done for
[1:30:28] us amen I've given you everything and
[1:30:31] you're still belly aching I say quit
[1:30:33] your belly
[1:30:36] aching you that know where I'm coming
[1:30:38] from on that I dad always had a sign up
[1:30:41] in his office he's an insurance Salman
[1:30:43] he said quit your belly
[1:30:44] aching it's all written all in one
[1:30:47] letter quit your belly aching but it's
[1:30:49] all not divided out you'd have to look
[1:30:50] at it look at it oh that's what it's
[1:30:52] saying that's a revealed
[1:30:55] mystery and it's a revealed mystery when
[1:30:57] you can quit your belly
[1:30:59] aching and recognize that God's done
[1:31:02] everything he needs to do and you just
[1:31:04] need to go and possess what he's given
[1:31:06] if that faith is in you then go possess
[1:31:08] it if you have the Holy Ghost that I'm
[1:31:11] talking about living and abiding in you
[1:31:12] who is the word living not feelings but
[1:31:15] the word living recognizing the word for
[1:31:18] the season recognizing the hour you're
[1:31:21] living in
[1:31:24] then you then you might as well just
[1:31:26] quit your belly
[1:31:30] aing you have nothing to belly ache
[1:31:32] about nothing to complain about where's
[1:31:34] your complaining why you murmuring
[1:31:36] because you're looking at the other side
[1:31:39] you're not looking in allowing the word
[1:31:41] to lead you you say Brother David why
[1:31:44] you talking that way to us because I'm
[1:31:46] going through the same
[1:31:49] thing you don't think I have to fight
[1:31:51] trials and pressures where persecuted
[1:31:54] yet not cast down or how's that
[1:31:56] scripture go 2 Corinthians
[1:31:58] 49 go back and read it and yet all the
[1:32:02] time at peace seated in Heavenly places
[1:32:05] in Christ
[1:32:07] Jesus rejoicing have joy in my Heart
[1:32:10] full of joy and that the outward man
[1:32:13] feel like he's pushed down bent down
[1:32:15] beat down and the devil said see there
[1:32:17] see there you're not one of them or you
[1:32:19] wouldn't be doing the things you're
[1:32:20] doing but take him back to the word what
[1:32:24] did my Lord say about me go back to
[1:32:27] what's revealed to you see said there's
[1:32:29] my state there's my anchor where's the
[1:32:33] anchor it's within the
[1:32:37] veil anchors on the solid Revelation
[1:32:41] Rock and won't let go of that I don't
[1:32:43] care how bad the Seas get I don't care
[1:32:46] how much the boat is broken up I don't
[1:32:48] care what about it he's still in the
[1:32:52] ship and if he said we're going to the
[1:32:55] other side we'll go to the other side
[1:32:57] right what do you got the belly ache
[1:32:59] about then why don't we just be happy
[1:33:02] and realize that nothing can come your
[1:33:03] way he's not the author of frustration
[1:33:06] but of peace and you have that peace
[1:33:09] then let that peace umpire your heart
[1:33:12] and if the Empire said it's a strike
[1:33:14] then you settle it in your mind your
[1:33:15] carnal mind and let go of it it's a
[1:33:18] strike and go
[1:33:20] on you know what I'm talking about the
[1:33:22] Empire of a ball game what if they
[1:33:24] didn't have an Umpire what if you didn't
[1:33:26] have a street light everybody's trying
[1:33:27] to beat the street lights
[1:33:29] now the red lights because they don't
[1:33:32] because they're becoming what Lawless
[1:33:35] just what the Bible said they would
[1:33:37] become they'll beat the system if they
[1:33:38] can beat it they'll beat the system they
[1:33:40] don't care if the police said it they
[1:33:42] don't care if the magistrate said it but
[1:33:44] you and I God put those Powers there to
[1:33:46] God's going to say I'm going to see how
[1:33:48] you react to it even to the speed limits
[1:33:52] so don't let that little fox of that
[1:33:54] outer man don't let the devil come in
[1:33:57] your senses and declare you're something
[1:33:59] when you're not that don't let him make
[1:34:01] you believe that you're identified out
[1:34:03] here in this old man you're not ident
[1:34:05] this is not the real
[1:34:08] me I've already heard from
[1:34:13] me I've already heard from my theophany
[1:34:16] I was meant to be that to begin with but
[1:34:18] sin brought me down here to be tested so
[1:34:20] that God's attributes can be manifested
[1:34:23] in in me that's worth everything I said
[1:34:25] then Lord blessed be your name you've
[1:34:27] got a reason for me to go through that
[1:34:29] you've got a purpose for me to go
[1:34:30] through what I go through and you're
[1:34:32] perfecting your character you're beating
[1:34:33] it out of me God had a reason to let
[1:34:35] that computer fail God had a reason for
[1:34:38] me not to print this out because he's
[1:34:41] teaching me it's already in you then
[1:34:43] preach the
[1:34:46] message preach the inspiration I give
[1:34:49] you I've learned a great lesson that may
[1:34:51] not be so much for you and I but it
[1:34:53] ought to be for us
[1:34:54] us because we better not look negatively
[1:34:57] on what God if you say well God's in
[1:34:59] complete control bless God then what are
[1:35:01] you could quit belly aching
[1:35:07] about he can't allow it to come unless
[1:35:09] he allowed it he can't have it unless he
[1:35:11] did allow it then he's made a way out of
[1:35:13] it oh don't think for a minute I was
[1:35:16] starting
[1:35:20] to
[1:35:21] ding ding
[1:35:24] no anybody that knows the old
[1:35:26] typewriters know what I'm talking
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:29] about push it over and you start
[1:35:32] again but you know what in all of that
[1:35:35] there was an inside
[1:35:37] man said just rest in me I've given it
[1:35:41] to you have not you said before out in
[1:35:43] prayer Lord I know you've given it to me
[1:35:45] if I don't use anything
[1:35:47] else then I know you can put it in my
[1:35:50] heart in my mouth to
[1:35:52] speak okay okay I'm going to try you on
[1:35:55] it thank God for victory despite David I
[1:36:00] still have Victory despite David I'm
[1:36:03] already free I'm still
[1:36:05] free despite what I did Satan said see
[1:36:07] you didn't have faith oh yes I
[1:36:10] do because that's what conquered it
[1:36:13] right are you with me amen I've learned
[1:36:17] a great lesson this
[1:36:18] morning God help
[1:36:20] me to quit relying on man's device I
[1:36:23] think we rely too much on man's devices
[1:36:26] and when it when it fails oh we
[1:36:30] failed we don't have the screen working
[1:36:33] anymore we don't have music anymore the
[1:36:36] piano is not being
[1:36:39] played what's that got to do with it
[1:36:42] God's going to have church
[1:36:44] anyway that right why are we fretting
[1:36:48] over those things why do we get fretful
[1:36:50] and scared to death you're relying upon
[1:36:53] something that God never sent for you to
[1:36:55] rely upon amen he's never given you that
[1:36:58] to rely upon how we going to go home in
[1:37:00] a Rapture when you try to live as close
[1:37:03] to sin as you can and
[1:37:05] compromise because of your feelings
[1:37:07] because of your reasoning because of
[1:37:09] what others around you is going to say
[1:37:11] don't tell me that's not right I'm a man
[1:37:15] also and don't think I don't get hit
[1:37:17] with that being a preacher yeah but
[1:37:20] where am I going to stand where's my
[1:37:22] stand what position am I going to take
[1:37:25] in this
[1:37:26] hour it's too late to be fooling around
[1:37:30] playing
[1:37:32] church I'm going to tell you right now
[1:37:34] it's too late right I said it was too
[1:37:38] late 25 and 30 years ago it's too late
[1:37:42] now amen you're either going to be what
[1:37:45] you're going to be you're going to be
[1:37:46] the truth or you're not the truth you're
[1:37:48] either in or you're
[1:37:50] out there's no halfway in between amen
[1:37:54] you either give yourself completely
[1:37:56] wholeheartedly over to this word and let
[1:37:58] him lead you or you're
[1:38:00] not now I'm talking about the inward I'm
[1:38:03] not talking about how you fail out here
[1:38:04] I'm talking about what is the motive
[1:38:07] inside are you going to give yourself
[1:38:10] completely over and then fail and then
[1:38:12] realize I never
[1:38:15] failed are you see what I'm
[1:38:18] saying or are you going to fail and say
[1:38:20] BL I guess that's it I fall I failed I
[1:38:23] guess I can't be a Christian I can't
[1:38:25] even live
[1:38:26] it he never asked you to live
[1:38:29] it he said I'll live
[1:38:35] it are you willing to yield
[1:38:38] completely with all your heart and
[1:38:40] sincerity and said I'm giving it over to
[1:38:42] you and walk out of this and say
[1:38:44] something you didn't want to say and
[1:38:45] have to ask forgiveness and still
[1:38:47] realize it's a finished work that you it
[1:38:51] doesn't move what you had in your heart
[1:38:53] from your heart to confess and say why
[1:38:56] don't you just turn around and say thank
[1:38:58] the Lord for the
[1:38:59] trial thank the Lord for the test thank
[1:39:03] you Lord we can thank him and we ought
[1:39:05] to be thanking him in all
[1:39:08] things why does the bible say that
[1:39:10] because this is the will of God
[1:39:13] concerning you what is it saying there
[1:39:15] it's saying that you're going through
[1:39:17] this by my directing and going through a
[1:39:19] trial and test to not move you you can't
[1:39:22] be moved out of me but to show you where
[1:39:24] your resting place where your where your
[1:39:26] peace is who you are and where you're
[1:39:31] standing I pray God help them to see it
[1:39:35] what we're saying
[1:39:37] here you can have two things working
[1:39:39] simultaneously at the same
[1:39:41] time do you hey raise your hand if you
[1:39:44] understand it what I'm trying to say to
[1:39:46] you you have two things happening
[1:39:48] simultaneously two Natures working but
[1:39:51] one is overcome one nature and the other
[1:39:53] can't overcome the other
[1:39:55] one is that
[1:39:57] right so where you going to rest where's
[1:40:00] your peace have you entered into rest
[1:40:04] what the Bible say when you enter into
[1:40:06] rest you have ceased from your own
[1:40:10] labors
[1:40:12] right I've
[1:40:14] ceased right not me trying to labor
[1:40:18] anything he's already sealed me off and
[1:40:20] said you're secure
[1:40:24] your owner is myself and it's a finished
[1:40:28] work that's what the seal signifies now
[1:40:31] either we believe that and we make a
[1:40:33] mistake we go right back over that and
[1:40:34] said but God you said or I say God I
[1:40:37] don't know understand what I'm going
[1:40:38] through you never said for me to
[1:40:40] understand it why because he's given us
[1:40:43] his mind hello now listen to this
[1:40:45] carefully his thoughts are higher than
[1:40:51] David's his ways are higher than David's
[1:40:54] so if he's given his mind then he's
[1:40:56] given me rest he's given me peace to
[1:40:59] know this that he's perfect in his way
[1:41:01] and his thoughts and he's made my way
[1:41:04] perfect and if he wants me to understand
[1:41:07] what he's doing as my shepherd he'll
[1:41:08] show me if he doesn't show me I still
[1:41:11] have confidence that he's in
[1:41:18] control and if you be that word heavens
[1:41:20] and earth will pass away but my word
[1:41:23] shall will never pass away and the
[1:41:24] prophet followed that scripture right up
[1:41:26] with this he said if you be that word
[1:41:29] heavens and earth will pass away but you
[1:41:31] canot fail you cannot pass away heavens
[1:41:34] and
[1:41:37] earth shall fail but I can't this little
[1:41:41] bride will not fail she cannot
[1:41:45] fall because she predestinated by me
[1:41:48] ordained by me it is me myself working
[1:41:51] in her and how can I fail therefore she
[1:41:54] can't fail she's as perfect as I am and
[1:41:56] she's LED perfectly and my ways are
[1:41:59] perfect and I made her way
[1:42:05] perfect you can sit there this morning
[1:42:07] and you can think I don't understand I'm
[1:42:09] trying to reason this thing out what's
[1:42:10] he trying to say I'm trying to
[1:42:12] understand forget
[1:42:13] it quit your trying to understand
[1:42:18] mentally I'm not explaining anything I'm
[1:42:21] telling you what the word word said and
[1:42:23] the revelation of
[1:42:26] it I can't explain this to you if I
[1:42:29] could it would be no more faith because
[1:42:32] faith is a
[1:42:33] revelation I can't explain it but
[1:42:36] whether you believe it or not now that's
[1:42:37] a different
[1:42:38] thing it's got to either register amen
[1:42:41] or I don't know about him he's trying to
[1:42:43] make himself something who does he think
[1:42:45] he
[1:42:47] is you
[1:42:49] see where we're
[1:42:51] standing crazy
[1:42:53] unusual to the world Heretics to the
[1:42:57] human
[1:42:58] reasoning how can they act so cra why
[1:43:00] they act crazy they gone off the deep
[1:43:01] end brother Trevor why have you gone off
[1:43:04] the deep
[1:43:05] end thank God I went off the deep end
[1:43:08] depends what end you want to go off if I
[1:43:11] go off the deep end then I'm swallowed
[1:43:12] up I'm over my head with the word and
[1:43:16] covered I've gone
[1:43:20] over listen
[1:43:24] the bride is the word cannot fail cannot
[1:43:27] pass away you might as well settle that
[1:43:28] and let it be fixed in your heart right
[1:43:31] now if you're a Believer you cannot pass
[1:43:34] away nor fail praise the
[1:43:37] Lord then rest in it the Lord is my
[1:43:40] shepherd I shall not want I don't have a
[1:43:43] lack but what he will meet I don't care
[1:43:45] what the situation is he's going to meet
[1:43:48] that
[1:43:49] situation I will not
[1:43:52] lack he'll make me to lie down why
[1:43:54] because he's come in me ordering my
[1:43:56] steps making me to lie down in Green
[1:43:58] Pastures when I didn't feel like laying
[1:44:02] down but he maketh me to lie down
[1:44:05] because he is the energy he is the
[1:44:09] energy of this
[1:44:12] Branch amen don't try to come in some
[1:44:16] other way you've got to come through the
[1:44:18] door Jesus said I am the door to the
[1:44:21] Sheep full there can't come no other way
[1:44:24] but through
[1:44:25] him amen and in order to come through
[1:44:28] him you had to be in
[1:44:31] him to begin
[1:44:33] with amen that's exactly what it is I
[1:44:38] can't say who is and who isn't but by
[1:44:41] their
[1:44:42] fruit fruits they are known you notice
[1:44:45] Jesus said in Matthew
[1:44:46] 2435 heavens and earth will pass away
[1:44:49] but my
[1:44:50] words plural yeah shall not pass away
[1:44:54] You're the word I'm the word the body of
[1:44:57] Christ is the word every member is the
[1:44:58] word my words will not pass

[1:45:06] realize that the word of God today you
[1:45:09] are that word cannot return
[1:45:14] void it's got to
[1:45:17] accomplish what it was sent to do
[1:45:23] so cheer up let me see a smile on your
[1:45:26] face
[1:45:27] amen start acting on the word how can
[1:45:31] you be anything but happy when you start
[1:45:33] acting on the
[1:45:35] word amen just take it you don't have to
[1:45:38] put your opinion on it forget your
[1:45:41] opinion of the outer man he'll give you
[1:45:43] your opinion he doesn't understand why
[1:45:45] it's
[1:45:47] happening go back and say but God you
[1:45:49] said the steps of a good man are ordered
[1:45:52] of the Lord and all things work together
[1:45:54] for good to them that love God called
[1:45:56] according to his
[1:45:57] purpose and the steps are ordered amen
[1:46:01] is that right he's working in
[1:46:03] me both will and to do of his good
[1:46:05] pleasure I've raised from the dead
[1:46:08] already raised from the dead I'm not
[1:46:09] going to raise I've already raised all
[1:46:11] that's got to catch up now is the
[1:46:12] quickening power that changed me and res
[1:46:15] what a resurrection that was but what a
[1:46:17] resurrection this is he's risen in me
[1:46:21] I've risen with him then it's
[1:46:24] finished it's finished there won't be
[1:46:28] many new births but there's no reason
[1:46:29] why you can't be one of them if that
[1:46:32] pull is inside your heart you get to
[1:46:34] where the source is and quit you're
[1:46:36] running from the presence of God and
[1:46:38] start running into
[1:46:42] it let's stand
[1:46:52] thank you
[1:46:55] Lord maybe I can start closing on time
[1:46:57] for a while now no you know what I I'm
[1:47:01] going to I'm sorry I said
[1:47:03] that it's his leadership I'm depending
[1:47:05] on whether it's on time in our minds or
[1:47:07] our reasoning or it
[1:47:08] isn't I'm not depending on myself and I
[1:47:12] trust you're not depending on yourself
[1:47:14] because you're wretched remember in my
[1:47:16] flesh that is Paul said in me that is to
[1:47:18] say in my flesh there dwelleth no good
[1:47:22] thing amen then how can you let it lead
[1:47:27] you when God's given you his word to
[1:47:30] lead
[1:47:33] you oh you say but I just not I'm not
[1:47:35] intellectual enough to listen You'll
[1:47:37] quit your worrying about whether you're
[1:47:38] intellectual enough get him inside of
[1:47:40] you and bring these things to your
[1:47:42] remembrance what you need to know and
[1:47:44] show you isn't that what he said we go
[1:47:47] back to St John 16 would he not show you
[1:47:50] will he not hear what the word said will
[1:47:52] he not receive it then it's all given to
[1:47:54] you right there the spirit of God comes
[1:47:57] in he'll lead you into all truth amen
[1:47:59] when he the comforter has
[1:48:02] come he will lead you into all
[1:48:04] truth I just feel I need to read that
[1:48:07] let's and let me just let me just while
[1:48:09] you're standing here let me read that
[1:48:11] and then I want to finish something here
[1:48:13] just give me about just a few couple
[1:48:15] minutes
[1:48:17] here in
[1:48:25] think about that
[1:48:32] now well it just slipped my mind
[1:48:35] now let's don't read it
[1:48:37] then you're right John 16 thank you
[1:48:40] brother John 16 see Satan tried to hide
[1:48:44] that didn't he John
[1:48:49] 16 watch the evidence here
[1:48:54] and let start with about 13th how be it
[1:48:57] when he the spirit of Truth is come he
[1:49:00] will guide you into all Truth for he
[1:49:03] shall not speak of himself but
[1:49:05] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:49:08] speak and he will show you things to
[1:49:11] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[1:49:14] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[1:49:19] you where's our confidence
[1:49:23] where's our confidence in the outer
[1:49:27] man our reasoning well you know I've got
[1:49:30] to have my beauty rest I can't go to
[1:49:33] church where's your reasoning did not he
[1:49:37] say to come can he not give you two
[1:49:39] hours of sleep and feel like it's
[1:49:42] eight he can give you eight hours of
[1:49:44] sleep in
[1:49:47] two it's our filthy
[1:49:49] reasoning that gets in the way I'm not
[1:49:52] just making that example I'm talking
[1:49:53] about anything it's your reasoning that
[1:49:55] gets in the way it's your old carnal
[1:50:00] self we limit him when he's unlimited
[1:50:04] right Hallelujah why don't we start
[1:50:07] living and walking with Christ as a as
[1:50:10] an def as a
[1:50:14] a
[1:50:16] invincible people army you can't be
[1:50:21] defeated live with him walk with him
[1:50:23] walk if you walk in the spirit Galatians
[1:50:26] said you'll not fulfill the lust of the
[1:50:32] Flesh and I was going to go over there
[1:50:34] let me just read that real quick for the
[1:50:37] flesh lusteth against the spirit see
[1:50:41] there but who are you the spirit capital
[1:50:46] S so the flesh lusteth against it what
[1:50:50] is it it's enmity it's your enemy
[1:50:53] why are you listening to your
[1:50:57] enemy forget your enemy forget its
[1:51:00] failures and its faults it'll never it's
[1:51:02] not going to be perfect you're going to
[1:51:04] have a carnal sticky nature as long as
[1:51:05] you're living here in this body but you
[1:51:08] can rule
[1:51:09] it with the
[1:51:12] word and we are made Kings and Priests
[1:51:16] rulers we start we just need to rule our
[1:51:20] ground amen all
[1:51:24] right not everybody else's
[1:51:28] yours okay for the flesh lusteth against
[1:51:31] the spirit and the spirit against the
[1:51:33] Flesh and these are contrary the one to
[1:51:35] the other so that you cannot do the
[1:51:37] things that you would then that sound
[1:51:38] like Romans 7 but Paul said I don't live
[1:51:41] by this mind I live by the mind of godj
[1:51:45] that's what he said right in that
[1:51:49] scripture but if you be led of the
[1:51:51] spirit you are not under the
[1:51:54] law
[1:51:56] amen
[1:51:57] amen
[1:52:00] amen oh Satan will take the law and said
[1:52:02] but you did this you said this but God
[1:52:07] the judges come back and said there's no
[1:52:11] record there's no record of
[1:52:13] it there's no book that even declares
[1:52:17] it they're free they're in
[1:52:21] me case is dismissed you have no case
[1:52:24] Satan you have no case I think you ought
[1:52:25] to tell them that every day you have no
[1:52:27] case against
[1:52:29] me my judge and my the and my judge and
[1:52:33] my attorney said I am completely
[1:52:35] delivered and free I am perfect he said
[1:52:37] I'm perfect he said I'm complete and he
[1:52:40] said I'm in the blood under the blood
[1:52:42] and how can you be anything but under
[1:52:43] the blood be be perfect
[1:52:47] and
[1:52:50] Powerful in faith it's the faith what is
[1:52:54] our Victory what is his victory you what
[1:52:57] is his faith is you because you're no
[1:53:01] more different than him you're his
[1:53:05] faith you say no more different that's
[1:53:07] exactly right you're him you're his
[1:53:11] glory and he said he would not share his
[1:53:13] glory with another but it so happens you
[1:53:15] are not
[1:53:17] another you're him
[1:53:22] so if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:53:25] walk in the
[1:53:28] spirit and they that are Christ have
[1:53:30] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:53:33] and lust they that are Christ have
[1:53:36] crucified it what do he say to do take
[1:53:38] up your
[1:53:40] cross
[1:53:42] daily deny yourself and come and follow
[1:53:48] me oh but Brother David you don't know
[1:53:51] what that that just I I I I know that's
[1:53:54] not the way to do it this
[1:53:59] situation and you have your confidence
[1:54:01] in yourself thinking you got it you can
[1:54:03] do something about it why don't you rely
[1:54:06] upon him let's bow our heads I've said
[1:54:09] enough Heavenly Father Thy word is
[1:54:14] perfect thy words are
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:19] true you said so let us then not be
[1:54:22] weary and well-doing
[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:25] let us not seow to the flesh Lord for if
[1:54:28] we sow to the flesh we reap
[1:54:31] corruption if we sow to the spirit we
[1:54:33] reap life

[1:54:37] Everlasting God you never said all of a
[1:54:40] sudden we become seed we always were
[1:54:42] seed that's why we could receive the
[1:54:44] spirit of God in us the word

[1:55:12] that way you would reveal yourself to
[1:55:16] us and we would walk in that we couldn't
[1:55:19] deny it how can we deny the word when
