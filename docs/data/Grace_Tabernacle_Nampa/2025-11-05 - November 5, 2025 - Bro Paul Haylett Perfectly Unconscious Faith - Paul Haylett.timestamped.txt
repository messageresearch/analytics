[17:50] um
[17:52] prophet was talking about
[17:55] was talking about the quickening power
[17:56] [music] but um talking about a brother
[17:59] he was hunting with a brother brother
[18:01] Donovan I think his name was young
[18:04] Christian another minister's son I
[18:07] believe it was [music] he had cancer on
[18:09] his ear
[18:11] and the prophet asked him said what's
[18:13] that on your ear and [music] mentioned
[18:15] something about it. He said he just
[18:17] reached over and put his hand on him.
[18:18] Didn't say a word. Within 24 hours, I
[18:21] was gone.
[18:23] Amen.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; That's the God I believe in. Amen.
[18:27] Hallelujah. [music]
[18:28] We don't have a lot of prayer requests
[18:30] written down tonight.
[18:32] Um I just have a burden for Liam to
[18:35] catch his knee.
[18:39] Just pray the Lord touch him. Amen. I
[18:42] know there's many others out there
[18:43] needing prayer this evening. Um, Alex
[18:46] and Rachel, I believe, are traveling.
[18:49] Amen. Lord, [music] just be with them.
[18:50] The different ones aren't with us this
[18:52] evening on the road, wherever they may
[18:53] be. Let's just bow our heads this
[18:56] morning or this evening [music] as we
[18:58] take it before the Lord.
[19:00] Gracious heavenly father.
[19:04] Lord, how we love you,
[19:07] Lord Jesus. [music] We
[19:10] help us, Lord God, to get ourselves out
[19:12] of the way,
[19:15] Lord, that [music] we can,

[19:32] Lord. that we can take all these things,
[19:34] Lord, that we've mentioned, the things
[19:36] of this [music] world, the things of
[19:38] this life, the things of the week, the
[19:39] day, the month, whatever it might be,
[19:41] Lord [music] God, and just commit it to
[19:44] you, Lord God.
[19:47] Lord, and just rest in what [music]
[19:49] you've said,
[19:51] Lord. Rest in what your word says,
[19:55] knowing that

[20:29] And Lord, I recognize the authority in
[20:33] that word,
[20:35] the creator and the author of our faith
[20:37] [music] of this universe, Lord Jesus.
[20:40] And so, Lord, we just commit these
[20:42] things into your hand, believing and

[20:45] of it, Lord Jesus. And we [music] rest
[20:47] in that tonight, Lord God. So, we come

[23:51] Hallelujah.
[23:54] Amen. [music] Man, as we change the
[23:56] order of the service tonight, I just
[23:57] want to sing that little chorus. I love
[23:58] him because he first loved me. [snorts]
[24:08] I
[24:10] love him.
[24:15] I
[24:17] love him
[24:21] because
[24:24] he first
[24:27] loved [singing] me.
[24:34] and purchased
[24:37] my
[24:40] salation
[24:44] [singing]
[24:46] on Calvary
[24:52] tree.
[24:54] Let's just stand sing it to him again.
[24:58] I
[25:01] love him.
[25:05] I
[25:08] love him
[25:12] because [music and singing]
[25:14] he first
[25:18] loved me
[25:24] and purchased
[25:28] [music and singing] my
[25:30] salvation.
[25:36] on Cal
[25:43] tree.
[25:48] I
[25:51] love him.
[25:55] I
[25:58] love [singing] him.
[26:02] because
[26:05] he [singing] first
[26:08] love me [music]
[26:14] and purchase
[26:18] my
[26:20] sound.
[26:32] tree.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to have the
[26:38] knowledge, the understanding that
[26:39] [music] the purchase price has been
[26:41] paid? Amen. To be able to stand here
[26:45] today [music] with such a complete
[26:47] confidence of what the Lord has already
[26:51] done. And uh [music] we just thank the
[26:54] Lord for that. Amen. and uh [music] how
[26:57] that he just you know speaks to us as we
[27:02] had [music] quite a busy week, the start
[27:05] of the week I should say and but such
[27:08] that it gave me time [music] to just
[27:10] focus, put the earphones on and just
[27:13] listen to the prophet and my it was just
[27:16] amazing little nuggets. [music] I I just
[27:19] I think you know you're you're busy. I
[27:21] was driving a piece of equipment, but
[27:23] you know, just [music] you just stop the
[27:25] the the audio and scroll it backwards
[27:28] and take a screenshot. And I I just
[27:30] [music] took it seemed like all day I
[27:32] was taking picture picture because it
[27:34] was just so profound. And I just thank
[27:37] the Lord for that. Amen. That that this
[27:39] is a living word. We're not sitting here
[27:41] in a dead letter uh saying, "Oh, yes,
[27:44] we're repeating. We're repeating." But
[27:46] it's [snorts] a living word coming out
[27:48] right now. And I think in my own humble,
[27:52] my dad said, "If you say you're humble,
[27:53] you're not." But in my own humble
[27:56] opinion, uh, it's more real
[27:59] &gt;&gt; to us today than it was 10, 15, 20 years
[28:04] ago. Amen. [music] It's more alive. You
[28:07] know, we're looking for the coming of
[28:09] the Lord each and every day. But I'll
[28:11] just be honest with you. If the Lord had
[28:13] come 20 years ago, I wouldn't have made
[28:15] a rapture. I wouldn't have been
[28:17] prepared. And I I don't know, not to be,
[28:19] but maybe obviously we're still not
[28:22] quite [music] there or the Lord would be
[28:25] coming. Many of you may be, but maybe
[28:28] it's your pastor. Remember, you know,
[28:29] the prophet said it it it doesn't mean
[28:31] the pastor is going. He might be the one
[28:34] reminds me of a little story once where
[28:36] a man said, "Now, you know, pastor, I
[28:38] just bought a new car and here's the
[28:40] spare keys to it." And the pastor said,
[28:41] "Why?" And he says, "Well, [music]
[28:43] when I go in the rapture, you might need
[28:45] this car." And so, you know, sometimes
[28:48] that's just the way it is. You cannot
[28:49] [music] predict. You can't look at the
[28:52] outside and say, I want to talk to you
[28:54] tonight. I hope you don't mind. Just
[28:56] kind of a homegrown night tonight. Amen.
[28:59] Thank you, musicians. God bless you.
[29:00] It's beautiful. Amen. I just want to u
[29:05] uh this comes out of the message. We'll
[29:07] touch on that uh when we come to the
[29:09] quote here, but a perfectly unconscious
[29:12] faith. And uh I I just thought it was
[29:15] such interesting wording, amen, that the
[29:18] prophet uses and and how it just speaks
[29:21] out. And I don't know about you, but
[29:23] there's been times in my life I was
[29:25] like, Lord, I need more faith. I need
[29:26] more faith. I need more faith. And yet,
[29:29] Brother Brandham kind of paints a little
[29:31] different picture concerning our faith.
[29:34] Amen. Now, it might seem as though the
[29:36] scripture is not necessarily related.
[29:39] Psalms 89 1-7.
[29:41] But to me, the Lord spoke to me as I saw
[29:44] this scripture and I just felt like it
[29:46] really fit in uh so so beautifully.
[29:50] Amen. Um
[29:54] Amen. Psalms 89 and one.
[29:58] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[30:01] forever. Now remember
[30:05] only the bride. Amen. really has that
[30:09] position.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; She's going to be there. So even though
[30:13] this was the Psalmist David, Amen. He's
[30:16] really speaking of the bride of Christ
[30:19] because he's talking about forever.
[30:21] Amen. He's not talking about for a space
[30:23] of time while there's breath in this
[30:25] body. I will sing of the mercies of the
[30:27] Lord forever. With my mouth will I make
[30:29] known thy faithfulness to all
[30:32] generations. For I have said, mercy
[30:35] shall be built up forever. Thy
[30:38] faithfulness shalt thou established in
[30:40] the very heavens. I have made a covenant
[30:43] with my chosen. I have sworn unto David,
[30:46] my servant. Thy seed will I establish
[30:49] forever. Do we believe tonight we're
[30:51] that seed? Amen. [snorts] And built up
[30:54] thy throne to all generations, Silah.
[30:56] And the heavens shall praise thy
[30:58] wonders, oh Lord, thy faithfulness also
[31:01] in the congregation of the saints. Amen.
[31:04] I believe tonight we could also say he
[31:06] is faithful.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that that's our heart? We know
[31:10] he is faithful. Amen. For who in heaven
[31:14] can be compared unto the Lord? Who among
[31:16] the sons of the mighty can be likened
[31:19] unto the Lord? God is greatly to be
[31:21] feared in the assembly of the saints and
[31:24] to be had in reverence of all them that
[31:27] are about him. Heavenly Father, we just
[31:30] ask you to come tonight, Lord. There are
[31:32] many here uh that were not able to be
[31:35] here tonight. We just ask you to be with
[31:37] them. Those on the road, those
[31:39] traveling, Lord, uh Brother Vicilei,
[31:42] Brother Sergey, out on the road, Lord,
[31:44] working uh each and every circumstance.
[31:47] Father, uh we would just ask you to come
[31:49] and and just speak to each heart
[31:51] tonight, Lord, and [snorts] just bless
[31:53] them. Draw them closer to you, Father.
[31:56] For Lord, the circumstances of this
[31:58] life, Father, would be such that they
[32:01] would try to hinder. Satan would try to
[32:03] hinder us from being in the house of
[32:06] God. But Lord, [snorts] we are here
[32:08] tonight. Few, maybe in number, but Lord,
[32:11] we are here, I believe, in great faith
[32:13] tonight. So we ask [snorts] you to speak
[32:15] to hearts, Lord, and lead us and guide
[32:17] us in truth in the name of Jesus Christ.
[32:20] Amen. You may be seated. Amen.
[32:24] You know, as we'll look at this, I I
[32:26] just love this scripture that he's made
[32:29] a covenant with his chosen. And um
[32:31] [snorts] I I believe that as that
[32:33] applies to you and I tonight, amen. The
[32:36] word of God is never had a beginning,
[32:38] never had an ending. So we don't put it
[32:40] for a certain generation. as many today.
[32:43] You know, I found it remarkable. I'd
[32:45] come across a deal where a man was
[32:47] emphasizing what he believed and said,
[32:50] you know, those things were for a
[32:52] different day. They're the Old
[32:54] Testament. And then he went on to
[32:56] testify what's wrong with America is
[32:58] they forsaken the Ten Commandments. And
[33:00] I thought, you know, there it is, the
[33:02] confusion, right? That they're there.
[33:04] That's no longer important. But you're
[33:07] in this condition because you've
[33:08] forsaken the no longer important things.
[33:11] Now, it just shows the confusion that's
[33:13] in their world, right? Where they
[33:15] they're not getting that settled. But
[33:16] I'll tell you, from the very first word
[33:18] of Genesis to the very last word of
[33:21] Revelation, the bride of Jesus Christ
[33:23] says amen to that. Amen. It's so real to
[33:26] her that she's not here to exclude
[33:29] anything. She's asking for revelation to
[33:32] understand it all. Amen. And so, you
[33:35] know, I just want to speak to you on
[33:37] that thought of perfectly unconscious
[33:39] faith. And [snorts] you know, part of
[33:41] the thing that uh we're here to to do
[33:43] now, this is like three sermons the
[33:46] prophet preached all kind of mixed
[33:48] together. But uh one of our challenges
[33:50] today is to overcome the realm of
[33:53] unbelief. And and we understand my
[33:55] brother and sister that uh unbelief is
[33:58] such an interesting thing because it it
[34:01] can creep back into our life so easily.
[34:04] little things, little comments, little
[34:06] whatever, you know, and and it's there
[34:09] that Satan wants to emphasize the
[34:11] negative in our life. And and what God
[34:14] wants us to do is simply completely
[34:17] believe the word. And even though
[34:19] circumstance and everything around us
[34:21] testifies differently, imagine you're
[34:23] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and
[34:25] they're walking you up the plank into
[34:27] the fire. And the men that are taking
[34:29] you there are collapsing from the heat
[34:32] and dying. And yet it's as though you
[34:34] were beckoned.
[34:36] Come on, my brother and sister. The
[34:38] scripture shows us those men, those
[34:40] great men, the great warriors of that
[34:42] kingdom never made it to the lip of the
[34:44] furnace. They collapsed from the heat.
[34:47] And Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, as
[34:49] though they were being wooed, kept right
[34:51] on walking into the fire. Now, we don't
[34:54] know it because the word don't really
[34:55] tell it to us, but I believe when they
[34:57] got up close to that, they saw their
[35:00] Lord Jesus Christ in there. Amen. And
[35:02] they were walking to him, not going to a
[35:05] fatalistic approach. Oh my, I guess I'm
[35:07] going to die in this fire. But they saw
[35:10] him. And when they saw him, they saw
[35:12] life. Now remember, my brother and
[35:14] sister, the Holy Spirit is a fire, a
[35:16] purifying fire. And when they saw that,
[35:19] they weren't seeing a fire that was
[35:21] going to destroy them. They saw a fire
[35:23] that was going to redeem them and
[35:25] cleanse them and purify them. And they
[35:28] walked right in there. And they walked
[35:30] right out of there. my brother and
[35:32] sister. You see, so sometimes unbelief
[35:34] takes certain forms. And if we're
[35:36] looking to, you might say a negative
[35:38] thing. Amen. Now, we're supposed to
[35:41] rejoice when we come into fiery trials.
[35:43] Amen. Do you rejoice? I want to know.
[35:45] Let's be honest, my brother and sister.
[35:47] Do we really enjoy rejoice when we come
[35:50] into fiery trials? Amen. I'm glad
[35:53] somebody could say amen because I tell
[35:55] you what, I don't. Yes, Sister Ruth,
[35:57] you're right. It depends on what day of
[35:59] the week and what that fiery trial is.
[36:02] Come on. Sometimes it's good to be
[36:03] honest with ourselves. But you see, the
[36:06] word is looking at us saying, "I have a
[36:08] goal in mind." And while this is a fiery
[36:12] trial, I've already declared you're
[36:14] going to walk right through it. It's not
[36:16] going to consume you. It's not going to
[36:17] destroy you. It's going to purify you
[36:20] and you're going to come out pure like
[36:22] gold. Amen. And so, we got to come. one
[36:25] of the things of the restored word. Now,
[36:27] critics would say, well, the message of
[36:29] the hour is not really restoring the
[36:31] word. It's always been there. But my
[36:33] brother and sister, what it's doing is
[36:35] restoring our faith in the word back to
[36:38] the faith of our fathers. Amen. So, it's
[36:40] there that we don't have to have a new
[36:42] message. You just need a message that's
[36:44] set in the right order, set the right
[36:47] priority, set to the right uh uh uh need
[36:50] of the age.
[36:51] So, it's what we're doing overcoming
[36:53] unbelief. Amen. Now, my brother and
[36:56] sister, I I like how brother Brandham
[36:59] put this. The smoking, the drinking, the
[37:00] dancing, all that. That's not unbelief.
[37:02] Those are the attributes of unbelief.
[37:05] So, what we're here is to overcome this
[37:07] realm of unbelief, which is the realm is
[37:11] an atmosphere that is around. So, a
[37:14] realm there, my brother and sister, is
[37:16] not just a singular thing at a certain
[37:18] time or place, but it's an atmosphere.
[37:20] Look at the world we're living in. Amen.
[37:22] Look at everything around it is an
[37:24] atmosphere that's opposed to God,
[37:27] opposed to his word, trying to show that
[37:30] God is not really God. But my brother
[37:32] and sister, there's a people on the
[37:33] earth today. You and I, I'm going to be
[37:35] just boastful tonight and say that you
[37:38] and I are on the earth to testify that
[37:41] God is real. He's alive. He's powerful.
[37:44] And his word has come like a two-edged
[37:46] sword and is cutting unbelief away from
[37:48] you and I. Amen. And God doesn't cut too
[37:51] deep. Sometimes we go, "Oh, I feel so I
[37:54] feel so hurt by this situation." But I
[37:56] want you to know God is so perfect. He
[37:59] never cuts too deep. So if he cuts you
[38:02] there in a certain way, it's because it
[38:05] needed to cut.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what are we doing? Unbelief
[38:10] keeps us from stepping through the veil.
[38:13] To take away unbelief is us stepping
[38:16] beyond the veil of flesh. So look at
[38:20] that process that comes. Brother
[38:22] Brandham says that uh when when Jesus
[38:24] was on the cross and the veil was rent
[38:27] that if the Jews had had the proper
[38:30] approach, they would have looked at the
[38:32] veil that was rent and looked beyond the
[38:35] veil and they would have saw Jesus
[38:38] Christ the redeemer on the mercy seat.
[38:40] But all they could look at is everything
[38:42] they believed had been now just shook
[38:44] up. They didn't understand what was
[38:46] going on cuz this man, this man, this
[38:48] man, that's how they saw him. just this
[38:50] man and look how the same spirit today
[38:53] just this man that they don't see what
[38:55] God's doing but God was bringing the
[38:58] mercy seat into plain view. Aren't you
[39:00] glad tonight he brought the mercy seat
[39:02] in plain view of you and I that we can
[39:04] look at that and realize I also heard
[39:06] the prophet this week say there is
[39:09] nothing you can do your name and the
[39:11] lamb's book of life there's nothing you
[39:13] can do that will remove your name from
[39:16] the lamb's book of life now just the
[39:18] book of life people can change their
[39:20] mind they can do things they can reject
[39:22] that and the name can be taken from that
[39:24] book but we're talking to the bride
[39:26] tonight amen and the bride is there God
[39:29] chose her. And it's not that we're going
[39:31] to go out and willfully go against the
[39:33] word, but sometimes Satan will trick us
[39:36] and things will happen. But Satan says,
[39:38] "Oh, you went too far." And God says,
[39:40] "You can't go far enough to get away
[39:42] from me." Amen. [snorts] Thank you,
[39:44] Lord. So, I've been in the last while,
[39:48] I've spoken many times on the action,
[39:52] you know, the certain things in the
[39:53] scriptures. Acts 2:38, repent is an
[39:56] action. And um but you know as I was
[39:59] studying this thought I want to bring a
[40:02] little balance into that. Uh I've spoken
[40:04] many times on the action we need to take
[40:06] to move forward. And I just really felt
[40:09] to to clarify some of these things that
[40:11] I was listening to and thinking and
[40:14] studying and uh you know I I felt like
[40:17] we needed to clarify it just a little
[40:19] bit or bring a little broader view. Now
[40:22] one of the things that we do need to do
[40:24] is take action on the word that we hear.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; So we don't want to be hearers only. We
[40:30] want to be doers. Right? So as we become
[40:33] hearers and doers of the word of God,
[40:36] there is actually an action that takes
[40:38] place that is not of works. We're not
[40:40] sitting there saying, "Well, if I say
[40:42] amen and I go out and attempt to fulfill
[40:44] this, then I'm satisfying the word." But
[40:46] it's something in us that the word is
[40:48] stimulating. [snorts] Amen. where an
[40:50] amen shouldn't be just a habit of some
[40:53] reaction in church that we don't really
[40:56] know what we said amen to but it should
[40:58] be a reaction to the word that has come
[41:01] and stimulated us. Amen. So you know
[41:05] it's there that that stimulation uh now
[41:09] there's no action that we can take
[41:11] there's nothing that we can actually do
[41:14] that changes our eternal destination.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "But but I chose to be
[41:21] baptized."
[41:23] You were called
[41:25] &gt;&gt; into baptism. [snorts]
[41:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "I I did this." No. Nope. The
[41:31] word says, "You never come to God. God
[41:34] came to you." So, he's pulling us,
[41:37] wooing us to himself. And many times
[41:41] this anointing, now let me just clarify
[41:43] a little bit how anointings can be. They
[41:46] seem to be can be so real
[41:49] that we would almost like testify in a
[41:52] court of law under some kind of oath
[41:54] that this was this and this is but that
[41:57] anointing could actually be from the
[41:59] pits of hell like religious spirit right
[42:02] brother Brown told us one of the
[42:03] strongest spirits there religious spirit
[42:06] and we would say God told me but it
[42:10] contrary to the word
[42:13] &gt;&gt; see so there's where our balance comes
[42:15] It isn't because a voice spoke to you in
[42:17] the middle of the night, but it's there
[42:19] that the voice has already told you,
[42:21] take it back to the word.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when that voice speaks to you
[42:24] and it lines up to the word of God, we
[42:26] need to take heed to that. So faith is
[42:31] this is not of our merit. Aren't you
[42:33] glad?
[42:34] &gt;&gt; I mean, come on. Let's just for a moment
[42:36] sit right down. Put our guard down. Put
[42:38] our guard down. If it was on our merit,
[42:42] where would we be tonight?
[42:45] lost.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad it's not our merit? Now,
[42:49] can someone say, "Thank you, Lord. It's
[42:51] not my merit. It's not what I have done
[42:56] &gt;&gt; or what I did not to do."
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[43:00] &gt;&gt; And faith, we recognize by looking
[43:02] through the word, can never be man-made.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; No.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; It's interesting how it is. You know,
[43:10] some people are born with an ability. I
[43:13] saw a little video clip of a person
[43:14] jumping off a cliff. It was like 122
[43:17] feet to the water. I don't know there's
[43:20] anybody here that's thinks in that
[43:22] realm.
[43:24] I mean, I'm sorry. It just takes another
[43:26] class of people to just run and leap off
[43:31] of a cliff like that, do two or three
[43:34] somersaults and in the water. And I'm
[43:37] like,
[43:42] and then it'd be call 911.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; He doesn't appear to be moving.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; But you see, my brother and sister, you
[43:49] would look at that and if we're not
[43:50] careful, we'd say, man, they just have
[43:51] this this confidence. They have this
[43:54] this something in them. They can do
[43:56] this.
[43:58] But if we're not careful, we mistake
[44:00] that in the in the spiritual world
[44:02] &gt;&gt; as faith.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely right.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; And it's not faith. It's a man-made,
[44:08] it's a natural born in them ability, but
[44:12] it's not faith. Where brother Brown says
[44:14] that you can be anointed of the Holy
[44:16] Spirit on this flesh all the days of
[44:18] your life and go to hell. And I, you
[44:21] know, I I think many a person uh maybe
[44:24] I'm sound like I'm assuming, but many a
[44:26] person would say, I just don't see how
[44:28] that could be. But look at this, my
[44:30] brother and sister, when it's really
[44:31] anchored on more of a man-made platform
[44:34] that that God is true. I read it in the
[44:36] word and it's all there. But it's not
[44:38] down in the soul that when the fiery
[44:41] trial would come, they could still stand
[44:42] and say the same thing that that God is
[44:45] true. I'm dying of cancer, but God is
[44:47] true. He's real. I've got this
[44:49] situation. I've been burnt. Amen. I seen
[44:52] a video clip a while back, a man
[44:54] hideously burnt. Amen. And and it's
[44:57] there that they're saying, "You're so
[44:58] lucky to be alive." And the man, you
[45:01] know, how scar tissue is and that stuff.
[45:03] And the man says, "I didn't die because
[45:05] God didn't give him permission."
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Now, there's some kind of revelation
[45:11] that the only reason I'm living is not
[45:13] because I'm lucky. It's because God
[45:15] never gave him permission to take my
[45:17] life.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we look at that. I don't
[45:21] believe that come from education. I
[45:22] believe there's an experience that was
[45:24] there. That man went through truly a
[45:27] fiery trial and he come out of it still
[45:30] believing that God's in control. Amen.
[45:33] So faith can never be man-made. Real
[45:36] faith can't be man-made. It only comes,
[45:38] as the scripture says, faith cometh by.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; There it goes. It all comes back to the
[45:45] word.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; The only way we're going to have faith
[45:47] is to be anchored in the word. Because
[45:50] if we're outside of the word, there's no
[45:52] other recipe to bring faith into the
[45:54] heart and life of a believer. Amen.
[45:56] [snorts] So it comes by the word. So
[45:59] here again, let me say this. Not by
[46:01] hearing only, but by being a doer of the
[46:05] word. Faith is implemented in us. Amen.
[46:09] Now, [snorts] there's times that really
[46:10] stimulate your faith, my brother and
[46:12] sister. I have seen things happen at
[46:15] different times and places through the
[46:17] years. Amen. I've seen it in such a
[46:20] fashion that you believe what you have
[46:23] done. Now, this I don't mean to focus
[46:25] this on me, but I'll just use myself for
[46:27] an example. I I've preached in more than
[46:29] one place and I felt like the sermon was
[46:32] an absolute failure. I felt like I
[46:34] stumbled all over myself and didn't
[46:36] really convey it like I wanted to. And
[46:38] then watch people flood to the altar and
[46:41] give their heart to the Lord or repent
[46:43] or be healed
[46:46] and you realize, okay, God's not only
[46:48] dealing with them, he's also dealing
[46:51] behind the desk.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. To show it's not how good you can
[46:56] preach. It's not how good you can
[46:58] present it, but it's whether my word is
[47:00] anointed and whether you give the word
[47:02] liberty to go out amongst the people and
[47:05] the people give the word liberty to come
[47:07] into them. And when that happens, you
[47:10] see the supernatural take place. It
[47:12] really all comes about no matter which
[47:14] side of the desk you're on. People
[47:17] giving liberty to the Holy Spirit to
[47:19] move.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So no longer, oh, I can receive.
[47:23] You hear it, my brother and sister. I'm
[47:25] not being critical, but you hear it and
[47:26] people say, "I I don't really receive
[47:29] from this brother when he preaches."
[47:30] Well, you've got a preconceived
[47:33] uh opinion or preconceived notion that
[47:36] what that brother preaches, maybe it's
[47:38] because it hurts and you just won't
[47:40] admit that it's cutting a little deep.
[47:42] But remember what I said, the Holy
[47:44] Spirit cannot cut too deep.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's there that as God's
[47:49] moving, we have to give the Lord when we
[47:51] come in the house of God complete
[47:53] liberty. Lord, do as you would with me
[47:56] tonight. Amen. And not hold back. So, as
[48:00] we'll look at that, uh, Brother Brandham
[48:03] says here in Melchzdc, the great prince
[48:06] and king. Amen. Um, so as we'll look at
[48:10] this,
[48:14] and the covenant was given to Abraham
[48:17] unconditionally.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you tonight, do we have an
[48:20] unconditional promise or not? Yes, we
[48:23] do.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we believe it's conditional,
[48:26] you'll never find yourself satisfied
[48:28] that you have met the condition.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; It's not in us unless got a religious
[48:33] spirit, right? That says, "Oh, we're
[48:35] perfect before God." Amen. So, let me
[48:38] throw this in. I've been just kind of
[48:40] pondering on this.
[48:43] We all understand what it is to live
[48:45] vicariously through someone else.
[48:48] So, you find the root word of vicarious
[48:50] is vicar. And so the pope comes and
[48:57] says, "God's living through me."
[49:03] Well, that's true if
[49:07] he's Holy Ghost fil.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Because each one of us tonight,
[49:13] Brother Trevor, Sister Carrie, Sister
[49:15] Sue, we could go on through all those.
[49:18] You could not tonight stand up and say,
[49:20] "I'm a vicor of Christ."
[49:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; He's living vicariously
[49:27] through me.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't allow us to go out and
[49:31] claim that everything we say is some
[49:33] perfect thing and everything we do is
[49:34] some perfect thing. You see, it's the
[49:37] life. It's a misrepresentation of the
[49:39] life that's supposed to be present in a
[49:41] Holy Ghost-filled believer. Amen. Now,
[49:44] Satan just took that and people want to
[49:47] be told what to do. You know, this is
[49:49] the truth, my brother and sister.
[49:50] People, many people are in church, they
[49:53] need someone big in their life. They
[49:54] need someone to tell them where to go,
[49:56] what to do, how to do it, when to do it,
[49:58] and and they won't acknowledge that. You
[50:00] ask them that and they'll deny it. But
[50:01] you just look about how they view
[50:03] church, how they look at pastors or
[50:05] whatever it is, and you realize they're
[50:07] looking for someone to lead them
[50:10] &gt;&gt; without realizing that it's supposed to
[50:12] be Christ.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; They're they're putting a man into the
[50:16] position and they're asking the man to
[50:19] lead and saying, "Well, maybe God's
[50:21] leading through him." But see, Brother
[50:23] Brandham, this is one thing I love about
[50:25] his ministry. He said, "I've never
[50:27] called you to myself." I'm not won't
[50:29] have these words perfect. Forgive me.
[50:30] But I never called you to myself,
[50:32] [snorts] but I came to introduce you to
[50:35] Jesus Christ. Imagine, Brother Trevor,
[50:39] Sister Carrie, that as you guys were
[50:41] getting to know each other that every
[50:43] time you'd be like, uh, I I would like
[50:45] to talk to Carrie, so I'll call Paul.
[50:50] You know, I want to talk to the Lord, so
[50:52] I got to call the preacher.
[50:55] No, that's not what it's about. It's a
[50:57] personal relationship
[50:59] that brings us into a place and [snorts]
[51:01] and so he says,"Abraham,
[51:04] uh, if you will do something, I'll do
[51:07] this." See, but that it was not the way
[51:09] God was doing. He told them, "Look, I've
[51:12] already done it."
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we say amen tonight? I've
[51:15] already done it. Amen. So, what you need
[51:18] to do isn't that what we do is what he
[51:20] has done for us. Nothing we could do to
[51:23] merit anything. What could we, the
[51:25] unrighteous ones, ever do anything to
[51:29] merit something before the great Jehovah
[51:31] God and his supremeo great supreme
[51:33] holiness?
[51:35] &gt;&gt; But look at this. This unconditional
[51:37] promise is [snorts] in the gap for you
[51:40] and I.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; So God doesn't look at us and say, "They
[51:43] didn't meet it. Oh, I guess the deal is
[51:45] off." He says, "I made an unconditional
[51:48] promise to them." And so it's not what
[51:51] we have done. And it's not as we've
[51:53] lived perfect. I said it at communion.
[51:55] It's not we're here not here at
[51:57] communion because we are perfect. We are
[52:00] here because God revealed to us that
[52:02] this is part and we are communing with
[52:05] him. We're sharing with him uh what our
[52:08] life is and what our desire is and what
[52:10] our heart is speaking. And God looks
[52:12] down and says it's by the blood, the
[52:16] body and the blood that I cleanse you.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So not not how good our attendance
[52:22] is, how much we gave to the church or
[52:24] anything like that. See, the only thing
[52:26] we can do is accept and be grateful for
[52:31] what he's already done for us.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; It's so simple,
[52:35] &gt;&gt; isn't it? [snorts]
[52:37] &gt;&gt; And I'm positive that many times in
[52:39] people's thinking that they try to make
[52:41] divine healing and so forth, some great
[52:46] outreaching.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. I've got to reach out
[52:49] there something way away. If I could
[52:53] only reach faith.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; But I like how the prophet of God come
[53:00] and he says, you know, everything you
[53:02] need, paraphrasing, not perfect words,
[53:05] but everything you need for the rapture
[53:07] is already
[53:09] &gt;&gt; in you.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; My, my brother and sister, every bit of
[53:12] faith that we need is already in us.
[53:17] And so we need to quit reaching because
[53:19] what we're doing is taking what God
[53:21] meant to be so simple and receive and
[53:24] we're complicating it. We're adding this
[53:26] and adding that and it's because we as
[53:28] human nature cannot just accept the
[53:31] simple redemptive blood of Jesus Christ.
[53:34] We've got to work for it.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; And I want to make emphasis on that.
[53:42] It's so simple,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; isn't it? Amen. We ought to be able to
[53:47] say amen to that and believe that that
[53:50] it is so simple. Now,
[53:54] is it possible you think that we try to
[53:56] make faith happen?
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; I think it's a very real reality to many
[54:02] people. They're trying to make faith
[54:05] happen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; They're trying to produce it.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; And intellectually, we we want it faith
[54:14] so bad. We we want it to happen so bad.
[54:18] So, Brother Brandham tells this and and
[54:21] uh it's um oh my yes in uh faith is a
[54:26] substance. Brother Brandham uh says this
[54:28] here in faith is a substance. He's
[54:30] talking about how this not exact words
[54:33] here again, but how that someone comes
[54:36] off the street
[54:38] and they receive their healing while a
[54:41] godly sister
[54:44] doesn't.
[54:46] Now, how can that be? This person from
[54:49] the street,
[54:51] how could they receive their healing and
[54:53] a godly sister not? because this person
[54:56] from the street comes and says, "He said
[54:59] it, I believe it, and it's settled."
[55:04] &gt;&gt; And the believer is like, "I've been
[55:05] living a good life. I've been faithful
[55:07] in church. I read my Bible. I pray, I
[55:09] this, I that I'm doing." And and and uh
[55:12] Lord, I hope that I'm actually worthy to
[55:15] receive this. And the person, we won't
[55:17] say necessarily they're a gross sinner,
[55:19] but they're just off the street and
[55:20] they're just coming in there and saying,
[55:22] "God said it. I just believe this."
[55:24] Amen. God heals him and the other one's
[55:26] trying to work their way to it. They're
[55:28] trying to come and approach it and what
[55:30] am I missing? And you know what happens
[55:32] when they don't receive their healing?
[55:34] They go back and they try even harder.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; In other words, they're not coming to a
[55:39] place that they simply say, you know, he
[55:40] said it. I believe it. It's settled.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; But when it doesn't happen, they try it
[55:45] harder.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, reminds me of an
[55:49] individual I know, young man, and he was
[55:51] taking whatever those tests are when
[55:53] you're in high school, going on to
[55:54] college and and uh he flunks it. He had
[55:58] studied literally every day for hours
[56:01] coming up to this test and he flunks it
[56:04] and he got so discouraged. So then he
[56:06] just doubled down and he studied it
[56:08] twice as much and he goes back for a
[56:10] second try and he flunks it again. Well,
[56:13] I say flunk. You know, there's certain
[56:14] levels, you know, you you reach in your
[56:18] accomplishment.
[56:20] And
[56:22] they gave him one more chance and they
[56:24] said, "You have to wait a certain period
[56:26] of time."
[56:28] And he thought,
[56:30] "I don't understand. I've I've studied
[56:32] everything. I've done all that I could
[56:36] do."
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And he come from a Christian home. and
[56:41] his parents rallied around him the
[56:42] morning of his next test. Not before,
[56:44] but just the morning of this next test.
[56:47] And they prayed, "Lord, thy will be
[56:48] done." He walks in there thinking,
[56:51] "Well, I haven't learned any more than I
[56:53] already knew, and I didn't pass then,
[56:54] but I'm still going to give my all." And
[56:57] they come back later and said, "We can't
[56:59] believe after failing it twice that you
[57:00] had such a good score."
[57:03] And what it testifies in this little
[57:05] story is he went from his ability
[57:09] &gt;&gt; to trusting God. And that changed the
[57:12] whole picture.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's there that in our own
[57:16] ability, we're sure we can do it by our
[57:18] own studies, by our own efforts, by our
[57:20] own thing. But you see, that won't get
[57:23] you healed, the prophet's telling us.
[57:25] And it won't get you past a test. God
[57:27] wants sons and daughters of God to trust
[57:29] him and him alone, not their own
[57:31] ability. [snorts] Amen. So, you know, we
[57:35] wonder what's wrong with us and then we
[57:37] try even harder. Now, in the sermon,
[57:39] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[57:41] today, and forever. This was preached
[57:43] just a few days later. Uh and uh brother
[57:47] Brandham says this. Then God comes down
[57:50] in anointing of another gift. And he
[57:52] will know things and foreshow things and
[57:54] tell things that was and what will be.
[57:56] What's that to do? Does that heal you?
[57:59] No.
[58:01] My my brother and sister, you can have
[58:02] prophecy in the church. You can have the
[58:05] gifts moving powerfully in the church.
[58:08] That won't heal you.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; It brings your faith up to Christ who
[58:15] has already healed you.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; So, it's not what we have to say, oh,
[58:20] I'm going to bring myself or, you know,
[58:22] I can do with this and get healing. No.
[58:25] What God's doing is building us up to
[58:28] get us up to this level that our healing
[58:30] is at.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, uh forgive me for
[58:35] putting in this silly little story, but
[58:37] Sister Jerry and I on a trip one time
[58:39] and and uh we punch in the button for
[58:42] the ground floor and it goes down a
[58:44] floor and stops and open doors and and
[58:46] the woman walks on. The lady walks on
[58:49] and um then it pushes the button and it
[58:53] goes down to the next floor and um the
[58:57] door opens. She just walks out, turns
[58:59] the corner and all there is there is an
[59:01] ice machine and she just looks at it
[59:03] dumbfounded like there's supposed to be
[59:06] a lobby here. Now my brother and sister,
[59:08] if we're not careful, we believe we're
[59:11] going to the right place to step out
[59:13] into a realm of faith, but we're finding
[59:16] ourselves stepping out into a different
[59:17] set of circumstance, a different realm,
[59:20] and it it's not there. But if we'll let
[59:22] the Lord be in control and we will give
[59:25] him preeminence in our life, he we don't
[59:28] have to be a rocket scientist.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be intellectually,
[59:32] spiritually intellectual. We can just
[59:35] say, you know what God said?
[59:37] &gt;&gt; said said he would give me a sound mind.
[59:39] I don't know about you guys, but I'll
[59:41] tell you sometimes the devil just beats
[59:42] on my brain so hard. I I want to say
[59:45] that it's just life making my brain
[59:46] mush. But I know it's the devil beating
[59:48] on me, turning my brain to mush where I
[59:50] can't hardly make a decision. But
[59:52] whenever I stop and say, "Lord, you
[59:54] promised me a sound mind." Then I can
[59:56] make a decision. Amen. Because Satan's
[59:58] going to use every tool there is on this
[1:00:01] earth against us. And if we're not
[1:00:03] careful, we'll think that because we
[1:00:05] know the message, we've read our Bible,
[1:00:07] that that's faith. That faith is that
[1:00:10] unhindered trust in God's word.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; No hindrance at all. We are simply
[1:00:16] trusting. Amen. So, uh, it brings your
[1:00:20] faith up to Jesus Christ who has already
[1:00:22] healed you. That's it. When you believe
[1:00:24] it and go away saying, "Praise the Lord,
[1:00:27] I'm healed. So, here's some action."
[1:00:29] See, this is why I felt really compelled
[1:00:31] to to bring a balance to me saying the
[1:00:33] action thing because action's not works,
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; but it is responding to the word. So,
[1:00:39] Brother Bram saying right here, see, uh,
[1:00:42] it brings your faith up to Jesus Christ
[1:00:43] who's already healed you. Then you
[1:00:45] believe it and you go away and an action
[1:00:48] takes place. Praise the Lord, I'm
[1:00:51] healed. Now Jesus crossing in the boat
[1:00:54] quickly now just a few minutes crossing
[1:00:57] the sea. I can just imagine how that
[1:00:59] was. He preached all day and that night
[1:01:01] a big storm come up on the sea and like
[1:01:03] to have sunk the little boat. Weary and
[1:01:05] tired but never afraid. I like that
[1:01:08] Jesus didn't have to go out and fast all
[1:01:11] day and pray all day then say, "Now I
[1:01:14] wonder if I've got faith enough to do
[1:01:16] this."
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. H [snorts] he was
[1:01:19] unconscious of the faith that he had.
[1:01:23] Any men or women that make you real
[1:01:26] warriors in the kingdom of God is p
[1:01:28] perfectly unconscious to their faith.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Ah I think I'll just be a prayer warrior
[1:01:35] today. No sir, you are a prayer warrior
[1:01:38] because you are praying the prayer of
[1:01:40] faith anointed from the Holy Ghost in
[1:01:42] you and you're just praying your heart
[1:01:44] to the Lord and you don't give up at the
[1:01:46] first knee ache or the first back ache
[1:01:48] or the first whatever. Amen. You always
[1:01:51] thought, am I the only one on earth that
[1:01:52] when you go to pray your phone starts
[1:01:54] ringing? Amen. I was talking to
[1:01:56] different brothers and they're like,
[1:01:57] nope, same thing happens. I said, how do
[1:01:59] you deal with that? He said, I leave my
[1:02:01] phone on silent in the other end of the
[1:02:03] house. Amen. And I don't even want to
[1:02:06] hear it go
[1:02:09] because I'm human and I want to know
[1:02:11] what's making it go.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Put it in the other end of the house.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz Satan's going to cause every
[1:02:20] salesman and every whatever in the world
[1:02:22] to call you to distract you from
[1:02:24] praying. [snorts] Amen. So it's there.
[1:02:27] Now I wonder if I've got faith enough.
[1:02:30] Jesus didn't go out and fast all day and
[1:02:31] pray all day and then say, "Now, I
[1:02:33] wonder if I got faith enough to do
[1:02:34] this." He was unconscious of the faith
[1:02:37] he had. Any men or women that ever make
[1:02:40] real warriors in the kingdom of God is
[1:02:42] perfectly unconscious to their faith.
[1:02:45] You keep trying to test your faith.
[1:02:48] Wonder if I've got faith enough to do
[1:02:49] this.
[1:02:52] How many times have we seen and
[1:02:55] witnessed people getting prayed for
[1:02:59] and they come to the minister and say,
[1:03:03] "I want you to pray for me that your
[1:03:06] faith."
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Well, there's some grounds to that.
[1:03:12] Brother Bram said, "We bind our faith
[1:03:14] together."
[1:03:16] But imagine what that will be if you
[1:03:18] have powerful faith and powerful faith.
[1:03:24] Let me liken it to you this way. If you
[1:03:28] are trying to put battery charger or
[1:03:30] cables, jumper cables on [snorts] a
[1:03:33] machine that takes four batteries to
[1:03:34] start and you're trying to charge it
[1:03:37] with a machine that has one little
[1:03:39] battery and you leave it on there for an
[1:03:42] hour or two. your pickup is idling and
[1:03:44] you go out in an hour or two, the
[1:03:46] battery is no longer dead, but all it
[1:03:48] does is go click, click, click. You see,
[1:03:51] it takes more power. Adding one battery
[1:03:54] to something that's dead doesn't
[1:03:57] energize it.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Silly analogy, but are you with me?
[1:04:04] [snorts]
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what happens is when we come
[1:04:07] in this, we should never come. Brother
[1:04:09] Brandham says it's a devil's language.
[1:04:11] We should never come and say, "I just
[1:04:12] don't have any faith." What we need to
[1:04:14] do is say, "Lord, I believe. Help my
[1:04:16] unbelief and let me take a hold of this
[1:04:19] because you said it, Lord. It's not what
[1:04:21] I said that's going to heal me. It's
[1:04:23] going to deliver me." It's what you said
[1:04:25] and I believe it with every bit of the
[1:04:27] fiber within me. I know it's the truth.
[1:04:30] Amen. We don't we go up there and say,
[1:04:32] "You know what? I'm a weak battery. Can
[1:04:35] I draw off of your battery and somehow
[1:04:37] make my battery strong again?" It won't
[1:04:39] work. It won't work. God wants you to
[1:04:41] come and say, "You know what? I've got
[1:04:43] the power to overcome every spirit,
[1:04:46] every circumstance, every fiery trial,
[1:04:48] every stumbling block, every railroad
[1:04:50] tie throat in my way, every pothole in
[1:04:53] the road of life. I can overcome this
[1:04:55] because I am the bride of Jesus Christ."
[1:04:57] When we come like that, God's got
[1:04:59] something he can come. And then he takes
[1:05:02] his word. If you don't mind me just
[1:05:03] bringing this in a natural level. Amen.
[1:05:06] He just takes his word and he goes over
[1:05:08] there if you guys don't mind. I'm not
[1:05:09] picking on nobody, but he pulls that out
[1:05:11] and he's got the jumper cables of the
[1:05:13] word and then he clicks them on there.
[1:05:15] Amen. And when the jumper cable of the
[1:05:17] word is already tied to the fact that
[1:05:19] you know you are the bride of Jesus
[1:05:21] Christ, you know the word is true. You
[1:05:23] know the Holy Spirit is moving and boom,
[1:05:25] things happen and we can say, "Oh, oh,
[1:05:28] brother so and so, such a powerful
[1:05:29] preacher." No, my brother and sister, it
[1:05:31] was your faith that received the charge
[1:05:33] from the Holy Ghost. It was your faith
[1:05:35] that received that and let that in.
[1:05:38] Amen. And then God makes it happen. If
[1:05:41] we're not careful, though, we look to a
[1:05:42] man and say, "It's this brother's
[1:05:44] ministry that did this. He was preaching
[1:05:46] when they were healed. He was preaching
[1:05:48] when this was delivered. He was
[1:05:50] preaching when this." My brother and
[1:05:52] sister, you might have confidence
[1:05:53] because that man is a man of God. But it
[1:05:56] takes something on your side because you
[1:05:58] have a dead failed battery. It don't
[1:06:00] matter how much charge you put to it, it
[1:06:03] won't start.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; It won't work.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know why I think
[1:06:08] about this, but remember on the highway
[1:06:09] that time, yeah, maybe I caught your
[1:06:12] thought. Amen. On the highway out there
[1:06:14] and those batteries, for whatever
[1:06:16] reason, just decided we've done all
[1:06:18] we're doing in life. Amen. And and we're
[1:06:20] just done. And and you couldn't do
[1:06:23] anything to put any juice in there. But
[1:06:25] I tell you, by God's grace, there was
[1:06:27] some other batteries there and it was
[1:06:28] there and made it home. I think your
[1:06:30] alternator died or something like that,
[1:06:32] right? So, you look at that. See, it it
[1:06:35] just doesn't matter, my brother and
[1:06:36] sister. There has to be something there
[1:06:38] to receive the charge. Something has to
[1:06:41] be there to receive it. Amen. Now, it's
[1:06:44] there. See, you don't go fast and pray.
[1:06:47] Jesus was unconscious of that. He says,
[1:06:49] "You keep trying to test your faith.
[1:06:51] Wonder if I got faith enough to do this.
[1:06:52] Have I got faith?" Don't test your
[1:06:53] faith. God said it. God said so. Do it
[1:06:57] anyhow.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's a realm that each one
[1:07:01] of us has to face. Amen. He said, "I'm
[1:07:04] healed."
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; I don't need to go get some affirmation
[1:07:08] from a preacher somewhere that I'm
[1:07:09] healed. God said I'm healed. Amen. I
[1:07:12] don't need somebody to pat me on the
[1:07:14] back and say, "You're healed. God said
[1:07:17] I'm healed." Amen. And when we take that
[1:07:19] approach, it'll change our approach to
[1:07:22] God and change our approach to the word
[1:07:24] being preached because all we're doing
[1:07:26] is hearing words of affirmation. It is
[1:07:28] not words that we have to draw all the
[1:07:31] energy out of to receive a promise. the
[1:07:33] promise been made.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, look at this. Uh because God
[1:07:38] said so. Now, I like this part. I hope
[1:07:40] you guys don't mind. I just enjoyed
[1:07:42] studying this. Have you ever tested your
[1:07:45] faith whether you had enough faith to
[1:07:47] come to the meeting or not tonight? Is
[1:07:50] there anyone here that sat down in the
[1:07:52] house tonight and said, "I just hope I
[1:07:56] just hope I have enough faith to get out
[1:07:58] of this chair,
[1:08:00] walk out to the car.
[1:08:04] Will the car even start?
[1:08:07] What if we go to church and nobody's
[1:08:08] there?"
[1:08:10] No. No. That's why the house of God
[1:08:14] should be open. The lights should be on.
[1:08:16] Amen. Anything but the worst of weather,
[1:08:18] etc. But test you had enough faith to
[1:08:21] eat your supper tonight. Did you need to
[1:08:24] pray through? Now, Sister Ruth, I'm
[1:08:27] sorry. I don't mean to embarrass you,
[1:08:28] but see, there's a certain degree.
[1:08:30] There's a time of trial, fiery trial
[1:08:32] when it comes that it is a test
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; to eat your food.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; But you don't go on living that way
[1:08:40] because God came on the scene and said,
[1:08:41] "I have faith. I believe he healed me."
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And so by believing he healed you, Amen.
[1:08:47] then it come down. You didn't have to go
[1:08:49] and pray through to whether you could
[1:08:51] eat or not
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; because the word already said, "I healed
[1:08:54] you." And that healing fixed this
[1:08:56] problem. And that's the way our life is,
[1:08:58] my brother and sister. Relationships,
[1:09:00] friendships, fellowship with God. When
[1:09:02] we'll get back to the basic and let God
[1:09:05] fix the basic things in our life, then
[1:09:08] all this other stuff just starts falling
[1:09:09] in place and we don't have to pray
[1:09:11] through. Oh, should I be friends with
[1:09:13] anybody at church? I better pray
[1:09:15] through. Should I really go to the
[1:09:17] household of faith? Should I go and join
[1:09:22] myself together? No. The word says,
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; and so when we have that right approach,
[1:09:27] see if you had enough faith to eat your
[1:09:28] supper tonight. Have you tested? Do you
[1:09:30] think you'll have to fast a while and
[1:09:32] test your faith to see if you got enough
[1:09:34] faith to drive your car home? Certainly
[1:09:37] not. It's just automatically you believe
[1:09:40] it.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look at that, my brother and
[1:09:43] sister. It's there. Think about how
[1:09:46] often in that more natural sense that we
[1:09:48] have faith. I tell you, if you drive a
[1:09:51] vehicle that you have to pray through
[1:09:53] before you put the key in the ignition
[1:09:54] and twisted, it might be time to save up
[1:09:56] money for a different car. Amen.
[1:09:58] [snorts]
[1:09:59] But it's there. Look how simple we are.
[1:10:01] We're stunned when the car won't start.
[1:10:05] We don't, you know, unless there's
[1:10:06] problems leading up to this, my brother
[1:10:08] and sister, right? A Christian on a
[1:10:10] starvation diet is not stunned when God
[1:10:15] doesn't answer prayers because they
[1:10:16] never expected him to. [snorts]
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; But when you are a Holy Ghost fililled,
[1:10:20] full of the word and you go into the
[1:10:23] word and you come in the presence of
[1:10:25] God. Amen. We have full expectation. God
[1:10:28] said it. I believe it's going to come to
[1:10:30] pass. Amen. Now, look, I tell you, I'll
[1:10:33] just put this as a type and move on.
[1:10:36] when you leave something sitting long
[1:10:38] enough.
[1:10:41] We have a truck
[1:10:43] that we went to use it here month or so
[1:10:46] ago
[1:10:48] and it's it's dead. We tried charging
[1:10:51] the batteries. They're no good. We
[1:10:52] looked at the batteries. The batteries
[1:10:54] are not really that old. The truck
[1:10:56] hasn't been driven that much. [snorts]
[1:10:59] But why did it die?
[1:11:03] From lack of use. That's
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; right. And many a believer, many a
[1:11:07] Christian's faith has died from what?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Lack of use.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown talked about faith is a
[1:11:18] muscle.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we all know what it would be
[1:11:21] like if we just lay around, lay around,
[1:11:23] lay around. Amen. You know, I tell you
[1:11:26] that's what you know, it comes to the
[1:11:28] point they say, "Well, I used to be able
[1:11:31] to run, but I haven't ran in years. Now
[1:11:35] I can't even walk to the mailbox. I
[1:11:37] don't understand."
[1:11:39] And our faith muscle is the same way. We
[1:11:41] say, "Well, I used to have faith to
[1:11:43] believe. I used to have Why have you
[1:11:45] been exercising it?"
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; No, I haven't.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Well, what what do we expect?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] Okay. Hey, as real believers, the
[1:11:54] prophet of God laid it down to us that
[1:11:56] we should say amen to every word of God.
[1:11:59] Now, I'm I'm going to just I hope this
[1:12:01] doesn't seem too pushy, but uh I'm
[1:12:04] telling you, if you're not saying amen,
[1:12:06] you are not exercising the faith that's
[1:12:08] in you. Now, some people say, "Well, I'm
[1:12:11] just a quiet kind of a person." But
[1:12:13] amen. The prophet of God said, a real
[1:12:16] believer says amen to every word of God.
[1:12:20] And you might say, "Well, I said it in
[1:12:21] my heart." Well, try saying it out loud.
[1:12:23] Amen. I think that even helps more. It
[1:12:25] helps inspire us. I've shared with you
[1:12:28] how that there was a time in my life I
[1:12:30] was embarrassed and all of these things
[1:12:33] and and such a contradiction in my life
[1:12:35] and I finally had to come when I was by
[1:12:37] myself and it'd be like, "Go ahead and
[1:12:38] say it, Paul."
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] But I get in public, I wouldn't say it
[1:12:43] out loud, you know? I was, "Amen."
[1:12:46] But then I finally was like, "You're a
[1:12:47] coward, Paul. God be ashamed of you.
[1:12:51] And I started exercising that. I know
[1:12:53] this sounds real carnal, but I started
[1:12:55] exercising that until it become natural.
[1:12:58] If I agree with what the preacher is
[1:13:00] saying, and even if I don't agree with
[1:13:02] what the preacher is saying, if it's the
[1:13:04] word,
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; oh, you guys have been there. You know
[1:13:06] what I'm talking about. It can be the
[1:13:08] word and we still don't necessarily
[1:13:09] agree with it, [snorts] you know,
[1:13:11] because that cut deep. But remember, God
[1:13:14] won't cut you any deeper than what he
[1:13:17] intended to.
[1:13:19] H.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; My.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; So, where does this come from? From the
[1:13:26] inner man.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; And it is enforced. Brother Paul's going
[1:13:30] to look out in the congregation. If I
[1:13:31] don't say amen, he's going to judge me.
[1:13:33] No, you don't forget about that.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Paul Paul does nothing with your with
[1:13:38] your destination, with your life. Amen.
[1:13:40] It needs to come automatically,
[1:13:42] unconsciously from the inner man. Amen.
[1:13:45] And that's the way our faith is growing.
[1:13:47] unconscious. We don't go to church and
[1:13:48] say, "I'm going to add another cubic to
[1:13:51] the stature of my faith today, but it
[1:13:53] just comes unconscious that the word of
[1:13:56] God stimulates us and we say, "That is
[1:13:57] the truth, and I'm going to rise up to
[1:13:59] that level." We say it within ourselves,
[1:14:01] Lord, raise me to that level, Lord. Then
[1:14:04] I can be used by you. I can be a real
[1:14:06] servant to you in whatever fashion you
[1:14:09] call me. Now my brother and sister, this
[1:14:12] is not that you have to translate every
[1:14:14] word of man, every word the preacher
[1:14:17] says. Because one preacher will say
[1:14:18] something a certain way and the other
[1:14:20] preacher looks like he's contradicting
[1:14:22] because he says it a different way. But
[1:14:24] when we dig to the bottom of it, what
[1:14:26] did God say to you? Amen. It's not going
[1:14:28] to be what the preacher said to you.
[1:14:30] It's what God says to you that makes the
[1:14:33] difference. Amen. So every faithful
[1:14:36] minister [snorts] sh would or should
[1:14:38] preach exactly what the word says. And
[1:14:40] God help us as a church, right? Not not
[1:14:42] just because brother Paul chose to or
[1:14:44] what, but God help us that we'd have
[1:14:46] wisdom to choose the right men to preach
[1:14:48] the word to us and affect our families
[1:14:50] that the word coming that we could. Now
[1:14:54] this will sound rough.
[1:14:57] Many tape only people say well we want
[1:15:01] only the tapes because then we can trust
[1:15:04] every word that we hear.
[1:15:09] But why this sounds rough are there so
[1:15:14] many hearers
[1:15:16] and so few doers?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:15:21] If it was only about the pure word, only
[1:15:23] the unadulterated that we can trust this
[1:15:27] because why? Go back. Brother Bram says
[1:15:30] our absolute is the Bible.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says don't forsake the
[1:15:35] assembling of yourselves together. We'll
[1:15:36] push that off the side because brother
[1:15:38] Brown said now you'll hear on this tape
[1:15:40] someday. Oh yeah, that's what we're
[1:15:41] holding to. But he told you to find a
[1:15:44] Holy Ghost fil church.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Go to it. That's right.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; And the word says not to forsake the
[1:15:52] assembling of yourselves together.
[1:15:54] That's not necessary. We have the pure
[1:15:56] word in our home now. Okay.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Okay. That's fine. That's fine. But you
[1:16:01] see, that's not what was said.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And so, we have to be really careful
[1:16:07] that [snorts] we don't look for it to be
[1:16:09] expressed in the way we want because
[1:16:10] otherwise that preacher, that preacher,
[1:16:13] that preacher, that nope, there's no
[1:16:14] good preachers.
[1:16:17] I know that's a little direct.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; But
[1:16:22] now look at this. I just listening to
[1:16:24] brother Brown speak and it it just
[1:16:25] touched me. By revelation,
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; the word in you.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Responds to the word coming to you.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful? I'll tell you
[1:16:38] what. It's Christ the word in you that
[1:16:41] is reaching out and receiving Christ the
[1:16:44] word coming to you. Amen. And there's
[1:16:48] the coming of Christ in our day.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; He come through his word to those that
[1:16:56] have the word in them. Amen. So we're
[1:16:59] looking as it is a literal coming of
[1:17:01] Christ. But the prophet of God told us
[1:17:03] already in the seventh seal, he is here.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. And so the word has to be
[1:17:09] receiving the word coming to it. And
[1:17:11] when we receive the word coming to us,
[1:17:14] then there is a joining together. And we
[1:17:17] can say amen to that.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Now look, this fire of the Holy God,
[1:17:22] amen, is coming to you to put faith in
[1:17:25] you.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; You know, that's what the moving of the
[1:17:27] Holy Spirit is. It's not just so we get
[1:17:29] sensations and shivers. [snorts] Amen.
[1:17:32] So the Holy God, I worded it that way on
[1:17:34] purpose because that's what he is. Amen.
[1:17:37] A holy God. And he's coming down and the
[1:17:40] word says he rightly divided himself
[1:17:42] into many licks of fire among the
[1:17:44] saints. And so he's coming down to you
[1:17:47] and I and coming into us and it's coming
[1:17:50] and he's putting faith in it. If the
[1:17:52] Holy Spirit's not there, my brother and
[1:17:54] sister, you're not going to have faith
[1:17:56] because faith comes by hearing the word.
[1:17:59] But we can't even call Jesus the Christ
[1:18:01] without the Holy Ghost. And so when we
[1:18:04] come and the fire of God comes down upon
[1:18:06] us, licks a fire moving, revelation
[1:18:09] moving on us, what is he doing? He's
[1:18:11] pouring faith into you and I. He's
[1:18:13] putting a fire into our heart and soul.
[1:18:15] And that fire is what causes the
[1:18:17] believer. It isn't how much churchianity
[1:18:20] we have or how many years we've went. My
[1:18:22] brother and sister, the oil in our lamp
[1:18:25] is the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:27] a cleansing fire. It is a fire that
[1:18:30] makes itself present. It's a fire that
[1:18:32] was on the mountain with Moses. It was a
[1:18:35] fire that come all the way down in the
[1:18:37] temple. Amen. On the candlestick. All of
[1:18:40] these representations. If we spoke them
[1:18:42] all tonight, we'd be here all night. But
[1:18:45] it's all there through that. And without
[1:18:47] that fire, God says, "I'm not there."
[1:18:50] Amen. He come there in the tabernacle in
[1:18:52] the wilderness and they saw that fire
[1:18:54] rise and fall. Amen. They saw that. They
[1:18:58] knew God was in the tabernacle. They
[1:19:00] knew he was there and between the wings
[1:19:02] of the cherubam and his presence was
[1:19:05] there. Israel knew it, my brother and
[1:19:07] sister, because God made himself known.
[1:19:09] Now, I want to tell you right here, step
[1:19:11] out on a little bit of limb. There is no
[1:19:13] longer as it is uh us looking to uh the
[1:19:16] cherubam between the wings of the
[1:19:18] cherubam. It's you with your hands
[1:19:20] lifted up and the Holy Ghost is down in
[1:19:22] the midst of the wings of the cherubam.
[1:19:24] It's Christ in you. Amen. today the
[1:19:27] glory of God coming down. And it should
[1:19:30] be not that we boast of it, but it
[1:19:32] should be evident that the Holy Ghost
[1:19:34] has fallen on you and I. It should be
[1:19:36] evidence that he's present with us. It
[1:19:39] should be evidence in our decisions of
[1:19:40] life and how we behave. It should be
[1:19:43] evident,
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; amen, to put a fire in our heart and
[1:19:47] soul. And it empowers us to act on the
[1:19:50] word of God. [snorts] Amen. You see,
[1:19:54] we live in such a
[1:19:56] influenced age.
[1:20:00] And
[1:20:03] brother Brown talks about how that
[1:20:05] hunting and stuff, he would get up in
[1:20:07] the morning and he would go out there
[1:20:09] and they just be little coals there in
[1:20:12] the fire.
[1:20:14] And he said, "You throw a few little
[1:20:16] sticks. You don't go get a big log.
[1:20:18] Throw a few little sticks on there. Then
[1:20:21] you fan it. Go look it up. It's good.
[1:20:24] It's good reading.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Then you fan it.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; You don't call somebody to come up the
[1:20:30] mountain and fan it for you.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; You fan.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; And you fan it. And brother Bram goes on
[1:20:36] to say, "Where there's smoke, there's
[1:20:38] fire."
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; And we think, "Oh, I don't really see a
[1:20:42] fire in my life, but something putting
[1:20:45] on that." What is it? We don't give up
[1:20:48] and say, "Well, I guess God's not here.
[1:20:49] I guess I'm not the bride of Christ. Fan
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; the coal. Fan the flame.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; And it will become. And then brother
[1:20:56] Brown goes on to say, Amen. When you
[1:20:59] have a fire in a dry forest, Amen. that
[1:21:02] fire creates its own wind which makes
[1:21:05] the fire greater and greater and
[1:21:08] greater. And he's making an example of
[1:21:10] you and I fanning the flame of the Holy
[1:21:12] Spirit in our life. Amen. And the more
[1:21:15] we fan it, the more that flame does, the
[1:21:17] more it creates its own life that comes
[1:21:20] forth and we no longer are lukewarm or
[1:21:23] cold. Amen. Because the fire has been
[1:21:25] fanned. I say God, help us to fan that
[1:21:27] fire tonight.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Hallelujah. Amen. And as
[1:21:32] brother Brown uses that story, sorry to
[1:21:34] keep referencing like that, but just
[1:21:35] hearing all this stuff, a painted fire
[1:21:37] ain't going to do it for you. I just had
[1:21:39] a conversation with a gentleman today at
[1:21:42] this point in time. I'll keep it very
[1:21:44] simple. But I told him right to his
[1:21:46] face, not boastfully, but I said, "You
[1:21:48] know, be prepared that uh I'm going to
[1:21:51] get you in church." And he looked at me
[1:21:54] and goes, "Well, well, I already go."
[1:21:57] And I said, "No, the real thing.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; The real thing." Well, you know where
[1:22:02] I'm going right now? I I just told the
[1:22:04] preacher the other day that that you
[1:22:06] know, if you just keep reading from the
[1:22:08] Bible and and you just keep it real
[1:22:10] simple, I'll be here. but you do
[1:22:11] anything else, I'm out of here. And I
[1:22:14] was like, "Yeah, you know what? You're
[1:22:16] out of here with that attitude." But
[1:22:18] when God comes and changes the spirit
[1:22:20] and actually fans a little fire that
[1:22:23] says, "I need more. I want more. I have
[1:22:26] to have more." You won't be just
[1:22:28] settling for a couple little scriptures,
[1:22:29] a little pat on the back, and sent out a
[1:22:31] church in 30 minutes. Amen. You'll want
[1:22:34] something more. And I'll tell you, my
[1:22:36] brother and sister, if we're here
[1:22:37] tonight trying to have more faith, and I
[1:22:39] think all of us in a sense would say
[1:22:40] yes, we want more faith. You know what
[1:22:42] the [snorts] prophet told us to do?
[1:22:45] Relax.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Let God have his way.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Not climbing up broken
[1:22:53] glass.
[1:22:55] Not how many Hail Marys, not how many
[1:22:57] whatevers. He's telling us relax and let
[1:23:01] God have his way. Just let God work in
[1:23:04] our life. Let it let it come. Amen. He
[1:23:07] talks about your healing. You want to be
[1:23:09] healed, just relax and believe God.
[1:23:11] Confess you're healed. Just go from
[1:23:13] there saying, I'm healed. I am healed.
[1:23:16] Go from there. I am saved. Go from
[1:23:19] there. I'm filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:21] Amen. Got a need in your life? Got a
[1:23:23] desire in your life? Don't sit there and
[1:23:25] fret and fuss and get all tense about
[1:23:27] that. Amen. Go out of there saying, you
[1:23:29] know what? Praise God. God said it. I
[1:23:32] believe it.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let the word in you fan the
[1:23:37] flame.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Now, the word is, Brother Brandham puts
[1:23:40] it this way. Not exact words, but puts
[1:23:42] it this way. The Holy Ghost is never
[1:23:44] nervous.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost inspires confidence in
[1:23:49] us.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Imagine now we're here,
[1:23:52] message believers tonight, and we're
[1:23:54] nervous whether God can actually have a
[1:23:56] rapture.
[1:23:58] How could you ever have faith that God's
[1:24:00] going to take you in a rapture if you're
[1:24:02] not sure he can do it?
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Me as a Christian almost like an
[1:24:08] oxymoron, right? Just kind of a,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; you know, well, I hope God
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; can actually create the new Jerusalem.
[1:24:20] Well, you know, brother Brandham, in so
[1:24:24] many words, I won't get off on this, but
[1:24:26] what is the new Jerusalem?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; It's you
[1:24:34] and the word
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; is the new Jerusalem.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Not a destination,
[1:24:41] you know, not like, oh, we're going over
[1:24:44] here. It's you and the word or the new
[1:24:47] Jerusalem. Amen. Now, how God chooses to
[1:24:50] manifest that? Well, how could I predict
[1:24:53] what God would do for you? Amen.
[1:24:57] Sister Vika,
[1:24:58] this man needs to stop. If you will help
[1:25:00] me come to the piano, please.
[1:25:04] In the book
[1:25:06] of Fleiman, first chapter:es 1-6.
[1:25:11] Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and
[1:25:15] Timothy our brother, and to Fleiman, and
[1:25:17] our dearly beloved and fellow laborer,
[1:25:19] and to beloved Aphia, and I looked up
[1:25:23] how to pronounce that word, and it's
[1:25:26] escaped me,
[1:25:28] Ashus, our fellow servant, to the church
[1:25:30] in the house. Grace to you and peace
[1:25:32] from God our father and the Lord Jesus
[1:25:34] Christ.
[1:25:36] F, look at this. Fiman's love and faith
[1:25:39] is what God's he's addressing. He's
[1:25:41] dealing put this. I thank my God, making
[1:25:45] mention of thee always in my prayers,
[1:25:48] hearing of thy love and faith which thou
[1:25:51] hast towards the Lord Jesus and toward
[1:25:54] his faith uh and all his saints. So what
[1:25:57] is it? He's seeing his faith expressed
[1:26:02] in his love
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; to the saints.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't this incredible? It wasn't that he
[1:26:08] goes out and casts out a demon here and
[1:26:10] and prophesies here, but it come out
[1:26:13] that this man had faith in what the word
[1:26:15] said and it's now exposed or expressed
[1:26:18] in him. I love that. It really speaks to
[1:26:21] my heart. Amen. Hearing of thy love and
[1:26:24] faith which thou has towards the Lord
[1:26:26] Jesus toward all saints that the
[1:26:28] communication of thy faith may become
[1:26:31] effectual.
[1:26:34] the communication becoming effective
[1:26:38] by the acknowledging of every good thing
[1:26:40] which [music] is in you in Christ Jesus.
[1:26:42] Wait, we're looking about being super
[1:26:44] spiritual. We're looking about this and
[1:26:46] we're looking about that. How about it
[1:26:48] becomes effectual or effective by
[1:26:50] acknowledging every good thing. Amen.
[1:26:53] You know what that is? That's [music]
[1:26:55] why we are called to come together as a
[1:26:57] body to fellowship together to encourage
[1:27:00] one another. Have you ever noticed just
[1:27:02] like a coal that is moved away from the
[1:27:05] fire in the fireplace, it don't take
[1:27:07] long it loses that bright orange hot
[1:27:11] look and it gets darker and darker until
[1:27:14] ultimately it just goes cold over there.
[1:27:17] That's us saints.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; What is our faith? Our faith is, if you
[1:27:22] don't mind me, Brother Trevor, Sister
[1:27:23] Carrie, [snorts] Amen. Our faith is
[1:27:26] somebody like you saying, "Looks like
[1:27:28] Paul's getting a little cool. We better
[1:27:30] pray for him." one, but we better just
[1:27:32] nudge him back over towards the fire. We
[1:27:34] don't have to say, "Look, it looks like
[1:27:35] you're getting cold and we need to help
[1:27:36] you and we need to get [music] No, just
[1:27:38] a little nudge. Hey, brother Paul, did
[1:27:40] you know, God, we were praying the other
[1:27:41] day about this and this and the Lord
[1:27:43] come in the service and preached exactly
[1:27:46] on that and we [music] thank you what
[1:27:48] God has done." Oh, we prayed for a
[1:27:50] neighbor and the Holy Spirit come
[1:27:52] [music] down and that neighbor who was
[1:27:53] sick, God touched them and raised them
[1:27:56] up. Look what God's doing. He's hearing
[1:27:58] the prayer of the saints. Oh, look what
[1:28:00] God did over here. We're praying for a
[1:28:01] sister overseas. We're praying for that.
[1:28:03] Do you guys remember we prayed for a
[1:28:05] little girl?
[1:28:07] A little girl in South Africa that had
[1:28:10] been kidnapped.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Remember that prayer?
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you remember what happened to
[1:28:16] her?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Saints around the world started
[1:28:20] praying for little Rebecca. Amen. And
[1:28:23] the the uh people who kidnapped her were
[1:28:26] looking for a ransom. And the family
[1:28:28] said, "We we have no we have nothing to
[1:28:32] give for ransom. We are poor people."
[1:28:34] And they said, "Go borrow it." And they
[1:28:37] even went and inquired, "Could we borrow
[1:28:39] money to ransom our daughter?" And and
[1:28:41] no place on earth, no banker, no place.
[1:28:44] They're like, "You have nothing. We're
[1:28:46] not going to do this." And so then they
[1:28:48] got desperate. We got desperate. I I
[1:28:51] hope you're with me on that. We got
[1:28:52] desperate. Lord, you need to deliver
[1:28:54] little Rebecca. And one day a man come
[1:28:57] and she was terrified because he was
[1:28:59] very angry. He loads her in a car
[1:29:01] blindfolded, drives her, turns here,
[1:29:03] turns there, turns there, drives her,
[1:29:05] and drives within a few blocks of the
[1:29:07] place they kidnapped her and kick her
[1:29:09] out of the car. Now, don't tell me my
[1:29:11] brother and sister that people that
[1:29:13] have, you know, what's happened in South
[1:29:15] Africa, a lot of those that they didn't
[1:29:16] pay ransom, they found them in the park,
[1:29:18] all right, but they were dead.
[1:29:21] But the Holy Ghost come, the power of
[1:29:23] God, the answer to prayer because the
[1:29:25] prayer of the saints avaleth much. Amen.
[1:29:28] And that's a life-changing thing. So
[1:29:30] what Satan wants to do is get us to not
[1:29:32] pray. Amen. So that he can have his way,
[1:29:35] but we as sons and daughters of God by
[1:29:37] the faith of God coming down in our
[1:29:39] hearts saying, "My prayer makes a
[1:29:41] difference." Amen. It might not seem
[1:29:43] like it changes much, but my prayer
[1:29:46] makes a difference. and Satan, I won't
[1:29:48] stop praying just because I might be
[1:29:50] discouraged. I'm going to pray anyhow
[1:29:53] because my God is a faithful God. My God
[1:29:56] answers prayer and I'm here to pray.
[1:29:59] Hallelujah. Now, I'm just going to get
[1:30:01] all wound up and excited. Hallelujah.
[1:30:04] [music] That the communication of thy
[1:30:06] faith, Amen. Maybe we could read that to
[1:30:09] oursel and say, "The communication of my
[1:30:11] faith has become effectual by
[1:30:15] acknowledging the good things that God
[1:30:16] [music] has done for me." Hallelujah. I
[1:30:19] love the Lord tonight. Amen. Excuse me.
[1:30:22] I think I managed managed to get through
[1:30:25] most of my notes here. Amen. Let's just
[1:30:28] stand sing a tong song or two. I was
[1:30:30] listening. I believe it was harvest time
[1:30:32] and I sometimes feel bad that I I end up
[1:30:35] singing lively songs at the end of
[1:30:37] service and I'm thinking I should sing
[1:30:39] more reverent kind of songs or whatever
[1:30:42] and and at [snorts] the end I believe
[1:30:44] it's harvest time u or who is this
[1:30:47] Melchzdc brother Brandham comes right
[1:30:49] out and says now let's sing this and he
[1:30:51] goes right into this lovely lively song
[1:30:54] and I thought oh thank you amen [music]
[1:30:56] it's not just me but look at this my
[1:30:59] brother and sister when We have a joy of
[1:31:01] our salvation. We [music] will share it.

[1:31:07] Isaac. Amen.

[1:32:39] Hallelujah.
[1:32:49] Give me your hand.
[1:32:53] Let's agree together
[1:32:58] that all of our eneies
[1:33:02] will crumble at our feet. [music]
[1:33:08] Whatever we bind on earth [music] shall
[1:33:13] be bound in heaven
[1:33:18] at the name of Jesus.
[1:33:23] Satan has to flee.
[1:33:28] We've [music and singing] got the power
[1:33:33] in the name of Jesus.
[1:33:38] We've got the power
[1:33:43] in the name [singing] of the Lord.
[1:33:48] Oh, Satan raouses.
[1:33:52] We cannot be defeated.
[1:33:55] [singing and music]
[1:33:57] You got the power
[1:34:02] in the name of the Lord.
[1:34:07] For many years now,
[1:34:11] Satan's tried to stop [music] us.
[1:34:15] Oh, but you, oh Jesus,
[1:34:21] Lord, we're still alive.
[1:34:26] mighty [music]
[1:34:28] army.
[1:34:30] We keep marching [singing] all over,
[1:34:35] fighting every battle [music]
[1:34:40] cuz the Lord's on our side
[1:34:46] [music] of the [singing] power
[1:34:50] in the name of Jesus.
[1:34:55] He got [music and singing] the power
[1:34:59] in the name of the Lord.
[1:35:05] [music] Oh Satan ra

[1:35:14] We've got the power
[1:35:18] in [music] the name of [singing] the
[1:35:20] Lord.
[1:35:24] [music]

[1:35:28] Not to add to anything, but when you
[1:35:30] were talking about the fire [music] and
[1:35:32] it fanning the flames further, there's a
[1:35:35] there's a term in firefighting. It's
[1:35:36] called plume dominant. When a fire
[1:35:39] creates [music] so much energy, it
[1:35:41] actually begins to create its own
[1:35:43] atmosphere
[1:35:44] around the [music] fire and it
[1:35:49] obviously [music] once it creates its
[1:35:51] own atmosphere, it's in control.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; And it and it and it causes massive fire
[1:35:56] growth. Praise God.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. It'll create its own
[1:36:03] clouds, its own lightning. Praise God.

[1:36:08] that. Amen.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I want to sing that
[1:36:12] little chorus. In the name of Jesus.
[1:36:22] I think the one right [music] below it.
[1:36:24] Yeah. There we go.
[1:36:30] In [music] the [singing] name of Jesus.
[1:36:34] In the name of Jesus.
[1:36:37] We have the [music] victory
[1:36:43] in the name of Jesus. [music] In the
[1:36:46] name of Jesus,
[1:36:49] demons will have [singing] to flee.
[1:36:55] Can [music] we stand in the name of
[1:37:00] Jesus?
[1:37:01] Tell me who can stand
[1:37:04] [music and singing]
[1:37:05] before
[1:37:07] in the preious [music]
[1:37:10] name of Jesus.
[1:37:13] We have the [music] victory
[1:37:20] in the name [music] of Jesus.
[1:37:23] In the name of Jesus,
[1:37:26] I have the victory. [singing and music]
[1:37:32] In the name [music] of Jesus,
[1:37:35] in the name [singing] of Jesus,
[1:37:38] demons [music]
[1:37:39] will have to flee.
[1:37:44] When I stand in the [music and singing]
[1:37:47] name of Jesus,
[1:37:50] tell me who can [music] stand before.
[1:37:54] [singing]
[1:37:56] In the preious [music] name [singing]
[1:37:59] of Jesus,
[1:38:02] I have the [music] victory
[1:38:08] in the [singing] name of [music] Jesus.
[1:38:11] In the name of Jesus,
[1:38:14] I have the victory.
[1:38:17] [music]
[1:38:20] In [singing] the name of Jesus,
[1:38:22] in the name [music] of Jesus,
[1:38:25] demons [singing]
[1:38:27] will have to flee.
[1:38:32] And I [music and singing] stand in the
[1:38:34] name of Jesus.
[1:38:37] Tell me who can stand
[1:38:41] [music and singing] before.

[1:38:48] [singing]
[1:38:49] I have the victory.
[1:38:55] Amen.
[1:38:57] Amen.
[1:38:59] Praise his name.
[1:39:02] Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. I
[1:39:05] wanted to sing [music] one more little
[1:39:06] chorus before we go. Uh little song, God
[1:39:09] rich in mercy was on my heart tonight.
[1:39:11] [music] Amen.

[1:39:27] God [singing] rich in mercy.
[1:39:34] says, "Sending his son, [singing]
[1:39:38] we [music] were undone.
[1:39:42] God rich in mercy.
[1:39:49] God [music] rich in grace,
[1:39:53] God rich in love, [singing]
[1:39:57] sending [music]
[1:39:58] his best from heaven above,
