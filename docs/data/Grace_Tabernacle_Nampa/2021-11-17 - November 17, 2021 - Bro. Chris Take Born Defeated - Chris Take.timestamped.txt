[35:03] why don't we stand tonight
[35:08] have your bibles turn with me to john
[35:10] chapter 11.
[35:28] challenge doing that
[35:45] uh verse 38.
[35:52] this is the story of lazarus
[35:55] you can read the rest of the chapter at
[35:57] home if you'd like we're going to pick
[35:58] up here in verse 38
[36:01] jesus therefore again groaning in
[36:03] himself coming to the grave
[36:05] it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
[36:08] jesus said take you away the stone
[36:11] martha the sister of him that was dead
[36:13] saith unto him lord by this time he
[36:14] stinketh for he hath been dead for days
[36:22] lord it's too hard now
[36:25] it's been too long
[36:28] nothing is impossible with god
[36:31] jesus saith unto her said i not unto
[36:33] thee that if thou is believed thou
[36:35] should have see the glory of god
[36:38] and they took away the stone from the
[36:39] place where the dead was laid and jesus
[36:42] lifted up his eyes and said father i
[36:44] thank thee that thou hast heard me
[36:46] before his requests he thanks the lord
[36:48] for answering his request
[36:50] and i knew that thou hearst me always
[36:52] but because of the people which stand by
[36:54] i said it that they may believe that
[36:56] thou has sent me
[36:58] and when he thus had spoken he cried
[37:00] with a loud voice lazarus come forth
[37:03] and he that was dead came forth bound
[37:05] hand and foot with grave clothes and his
[37:08] face was bound about with the napkin
[37:10] jesus saith unto them loose him
[37:12] and let him go
[37:14] amen
[37:15] may lord a blessing to the reading of
[37:16] his word he may be seated tonight
[37:24] amen my title tonight
[37:26] is probably a bit different but i think
[37:28] you've known me a while know that
[37:30] sometimes they are a bit different
[37:34] my title is born defeated
[37:38] very positive
[37:42] and encouraging
[37:44] but i trusted the lord half his weight
[37:46] tonight
[37:47] i was in the back studying and i had a
[37:50] bunch of quotes and i'm sorry to alex he
[37:53] might have done more work than he have
[37:55] she might have needed to but
[37:58] um
[38:00] and i just felt like it was i had just
[38:02] it was just too cluttered and i was
[38:03] trying to find the direction exactly i
[38:05] knew i knew what god laid in my heart
[38:07] but i was trying to find the direction
[38:09] because the god's word is just abounding
[38:11] and endless and you can take many things
[38:13] and go many different directions
[38:15] and i felt the lord say you know just
[38:17] pull it all out
[38:19] and take
[38:21] this one quote so we'll just ask the
[38:23] lord to come because i cannot
[38:25] do this amen just like any preacher will
[38:28] admit
[38:30] but tonight born defeated so this is as
[38:33] a quote it's kind of long but it's from
[38:36] the message how can i overcome and i
[38:39] have to be honest when i look the quote
[38:40] up i didn't know what came from this
[38:42] message till later on
[38:45] and i realized just how perfectly it
[38:47] lines up with the title how can i
[38:48] overcome
[38:50] but the bible says see as i said at the
[38:52] beginning
[38:53] you are born defeated now you can search
[38:56] the words born defeated and he only says
[38:58] it one time
[38:59] in this mess in his message
[39:01] and that birth can never bring you to
[39:04] life because you're born defeated in
[39:06] other words your natural birth
[39:08] you find no success with your natural
[39:10] birth
[39:11] there's no victory in your natural birth
[39:13] there's no not even any life in your
[39:15] natural birth
[39:18] because you're born defeated
[39:20] and you're in a defeated world amongst
[39:22] defeated people amongst defeated creeds
[39:26] defeated denomination
[39:29] thank you for coming tonight
[39:32] it doesn't end there
[39:34] god always starts
[39:35] here
[39:37] and moves
[39:38] here
[39:40] god always starts something in our lives
[39:43] at a place because we are beings of time
[39:46] god had a vision for us before the
[39:48] foundation of the world god knew where
[39:50] we would be what time in the in life we
[39:53] would in history we would come
[39:55] and god had a story to be written out in
[39:58] our lives god had something that he
[40:00] wanted to do not a single one of us is
[40:03] here tonight
[40:04] without a purpose
[40:06] not a single one of us is here
[40:10] without victory
[40:12] he says you've got to come to victory
[40:14] somehow not maybe you'll need to come to
[40:17] victory or maybe you might come to
[40:19] victory he says you have to come to
[40:22] victory you see if you believe what god
[40:25] has said you are to be
[40:28] you will say there has to be a victory
[40:31] amen
[40:32] if you really accept what god's word
[40:35] says about you
[40:37] man you have to say there will be a
[40:40] victory now the biggest thing that we
[40:42] have to learn is obedience to god's will
[40:45] for our life so how will that victory be
[40:48] interpreted inside of you is going to be
[40:50] different between one and the other
[40:53] god's will for some when they are sick
[40:55] with cancer is to pass on the glory they
[40:58] got their victory
[41:00] god's will for some with cancer is to be
[41:02] healed and live a long longer life and
[41:06] walk and testify of god's healing power
[41:09] you see god has many attributes and i
[41:11] had some quotes i i pulled them out but
[41:14] you can go and you can search and
[41:16] attributes god had an attribute to
[41:19] manifest
[41:20] in victory over death
[41:22] so he needs some saints to cross over in
[41:26] victory over death you see we're not
[41:28] called to
[41:30] to to just
[41:31] vaporize at the end of our life there is
[41:34] a destiny that we have to meet
[41:37] and if you believe that if you can catch
[41:40] that key that god has for you of who you
[41:44] really are you will find victory
[41:49] you will find victory in the morning to
[41:50] get out of bed you will find victory to
[41:53] set down with your devotions and there
[41:55] are things that we learn through our
[41:57] lives and some some will say oh that
[41:59] victory is easy and it's not for another
[42:01] and another would say oh that victory is
[42:03] easy but it's hard over here we all have
[42:06] different interpretations different
[42:08] things in our life that we go through
[42:10] but we will always have to stand and
[42:12] fight to obtain our
[42:15] victory
[42:16] whatever that victory will be but see
[42:18] you were born defeated
[42:24] there's two things as christians we have
[42:26] to learn
[42:28] humility we have to realize
[42:31] i said too but humility and god's grace
[42:35] we have to realize we were born defeated
[42:38] amen
[42:39] we
[42:40] cannot do it amen you say you talk about
[42:42] let's pull a sage from the bible a man
[42:45] of god that had tremendous victory that
[42:48] had many testimonies in his life we'll
[42:50] pull brother paul
[42:53] what did he say i am a prisoner to
[42:56] christ
[42:58] he did not say he was great look he had
[43:00] everything he could ever need
[43:04] to teach the bible
[43:05] and he went and threw it away
[43:08] and he started from scratch if you will
[43:10] he had to unlearn everything that he had
[43:13] received through man's interpretation
[43:16] and god had to take him and say look
[43:19] paul you were born defeated you don't
[43:22] have nothing to bring to this table
[43:25] except for your willingness to surrender
[43:28] paul had to be stripped down
[43:31] everything had to be taken down away
[43:33] from him so he could realize i am born
[43:36] defeated amen but the victory that i
[43:39] need the victory that i am called to is
[43:43] mine for the taking if i will step
[43:45] forward and receive it
[43:48] but you see many times that victory
[43:50] stands there before
[43:52] all we have to do is grab it but we
[43:54] think we're not good enough or there's
[43:56] something that holds us back because we
[43:58] think no we're not ready yet to receive
[44:00] that when all the while god is standing
[44:02] there saying all you have to do is grab
[44:05] it amen we've heard the story hold out
[44:07] the hundred dollar bill
[44:08] how many people came and grabbed it
[44:10] it took a long time for one person
[44:12] finally did but they were still he was
[44:14] standing there with a free hundred
[44:15] dollar bill
[44:16] you see oh what what would be your
[44:18] concerns what would be holding you back
[44:21] from doing that
[44:22] i'm not talking about a job i'm not
[44:25] talking about a girlfriend or anything
[44:27] like that i'm talking about
[44:29] you
[44:31] thinking you're not enough
[44:34] for what god has for you
[44:36] i'm talking about personal complexes i'm
[44:38] talking about things that inhibit us
[44:41] that we are we live defeated because
[44:44] we're living in what we were born
[44:47] but god says i have a victory i'm
[44:49] calling you to live in you were born
[44:52] defeated and you'll have to fight
[44:54] against that every day of your life but
[44:57] he has a victory that you have to come
[45:00] to
[45:02] it's just like a lily whereas the lily i
[45:04] i think is is one of
[45:07] of the most prettiest flowers that there
[45:09] is
[45:10] i'm very fond of those great calla
[45:11] lilies and pawn lily i think there's
[45:14] nothing hardly as pretty as a great big
[45:16] pond billy
[45:18] call it water lily how it's radiant now
[45:21] where does it come from it's a little
[45:23] seed down in the bottom of a muddy mucky
[45:25] pond
[45:29] and that little seed yet all the
[45:30] radiance that'll ever shine in in it is
[45:33] in it right then
[45:36] when it's in that mud
[45:39] now reverend fish
[45:41] swam by one day
[45:43] and saw this
[45:44] dirty little muddy plant in the bottom
[45:46] of the water
[45:47] and he said oh that'll never come to
[45:49] nothing
[45:53] because of its present condition
[45:56] on the outside
[45:58] it was born defeated
[46:01] it was born in the mud at the bottom of
[46:04] the water
[46:05] five to six feet deep
[46:07] that's what they say
[46:10] it was born down there in the mud no
[46:12] potential
[46:13] and that person has no potential
[46:17] god loves people with no potential
[46:21] because a greater testimony amen a
[46:24] greater that's why that's why
[46:26] the bible says it's better that you
[46:28] never even saw with your own eyes and
[46:30] yet you believe
[46:33] a greater victory
[46:35] so that lily's born down there in the
[46:37] bottom in the mud but guess what even
[46:39] though it's down there in the mud it
[46:42] already is
[46:43] that lily on top of the water
[46:46] it already is
[46:48] you can call it a lily
[46:51] you can call yourself
[46:54] a child of god
[46:57] god was calling you a child of god while
[46:59] you were out there making a mess
[47:02] while we were yet sinners christ died
[47:04] for us because you were already a lily
[47:07] you can walk up to somebody if god could
[47:09] show you let's just say for
[47:10] just as an example you had the ability
[47:12] to know this person out here looking
[47:15] like the world very much like the world
[47:17] was a true child of god you can walk up
[47:20] and say nice to meet you brother
[47:24] because he already
[47:25] was
[47:26] a brother
[47:27] nice to meet you sister
[47:30] and that's what christ is doing christ
[47:32] began to call his disciples when he
[47:34] walked the shores of galilee
[47:36] fishermen they're over there arguing
[47:39] with one another who's the greatest
[47:42] wanting to beat up the samaritans and
[47:44] and call down lightning and fire from
[47:46] heaven
[47:48] but see god could see you see well well
[47:51] he could have picked a lot better crowd
[47:53] that's what you could have said if you
[47:54] saw them before
[47:56] the upper room that's what you could
[47:58] have said especially when peter cursed
[48:00] and said he didn't know him but see
[48:02] peter was already brother peter
[48:04] peter was always ready a lily
[48:07] down there in the muck in the mire born
[48:09] defeated but peter had a victory to come
[48:12] to amen
[48:15] a lily has what it needs to get through
[48:19] the mud to the light
[48:23] you have what you need to get through
[48:26] the mud to the light you have what you
[48:28] need to get through the world to get
[48:30] saved to get the holy ghost to start
[48:32] serving god guess what you have what you
[48:34] need to get through your trial took the
[48:36] light on the other side
[48:39] god has already given you the ability
[48:41] and the victory even though you were
[48:42] born defeated
[48:45] all the radiance that'll ever shine he
[48:47] says it's in it right then when it's in
[48:49] that mud but it has to strive daily
[48:51] there's the key say to god they have to
[48:53] strive daily you have to push you have
[48:57] to fight you have to stand in the mud
[49:00] and you find the mud guess what you're
[49:02] covered in
[49:04] you are messy
[49:06] it's mucky it says that he said it's
[49:08] black
[49:09] it's dirty it's mucky it's slimy in that
[49:11] slime that it's living in yet it presses
[49:15] its way through the mud
[49:17] the muck and the waters and the stagnant
[49:19] places until it sticks its head above in
[49:22] the light and expresses what it's been
[49:24] hid in it all the time
[49:28] i think that's an overcomer he says that
[49:31] once in sin once did things that was
[49:33] wrong don't worry about it now
[49:35] once did things that was wrong then now
[49:37] why look back into the pond again see
[49:40] that's it god by his predestination see
[49:44] has brought this seed to life
[49:47] and it's pressing itself see coming to
[49:49] light and now on top of all of that it
[49:52] has overcome see it doesn't express
[49:55] itself down there it's getting up to
[49:57] express itself
[50:01] lily has roots i forget the name of them
[50:03] but they grow down and then they grow
[50:05] back up rhizome or rosem or something
[50:07] like that
[50:09] these roots anchor it in the mud below
[50:13] it is our experience of salvation
[50:17] that can anchor us to christ
[50:20] when someone has a real experience with
[50:23] god
[50:25] knowing what they were before god saved
[50:28] them
[50:29] knowing where they came from
[50:32] don't put a level of how bad it was that
[50:34] does not mean anything right once a
[50:36] sinner
[50:37] you were a sinner that's it
[50:40] there's no
[50:41] greater or less
[50:44] but that that you were that you and you
[50:47] have changed and mercy has rewrote your
[50:50] life and you stand today a lily on the
[50:52] water is your roots
[50:55] is your anchor why because you met
[50:59] christ
[51:00] when you met christ your anchor went
[51:02] down when you met christ your roots
[51:04] begin to spread and you begin to grow
[51:06] from the mud you begin to grow from a
[51:08] defeated state
[51:11] you did not have
[51:13] the ability to do it on your own but the
[51:15] life of christ began to grow inside of
[51:18] you and push you up push you through the
[51:21] mud that's the i think about that all
[51:23] the time says to god the paradox of god
[51:26] he calls you
[51:27] he chooses you before the foundation of
[51:29] the world then he gives you what you
[51:31] need to come to the place he wants you
[51:33] to be
[51:35] all you have to do
[51:37] is surrender that's right all you have
[51:39] to do is accept it
[51:41] all you have to do is say yes i believe
[51:43] god can change me
[51:45] that's all you have to do it's not
[51:47] complicated thanks to god i believe god
[51:49] can heal me don't try to
[51:51] [Music]
[51:52] make yourself healed
[51:55] can't do it
[51:57] don't try to force yourself to
[51:59] deliverance or force yourself to victory
[52:01] yes so no matter how hard that plant
[52:03] pushes he can't grow any faster
[52:06] he'll only grow
[52:07] he'll only grow to the speed of the life
[52:10] that he's receiving to give him the
[52:13] growth that he needs for victory
[52:16] the growth you need for victory comes
[52:19] from your experience with christ god
[52:22] begins to feed you some grow a little
[52:24] faster than others
[52:26] but god's feeding you the life that you
[52:28] need to come to the potential that only
[52:31] he can see sometimes
[52:34] praise the lord neither
[52:36] god by his predestination see has
[52:38] brought this seed to life and it's
[52:39] pressing itself see coming to light
[52:44] next paragraph neither did you and your
[52:46] sin and adultery and everything that you
[52:49] lived in you didn't express nothing but
[52:51] there was a seed in there and it got a
[52:53] chance to press itself into light see
[52:56] your seed pushed you into the light
[53:00] and now you're in the presence of jesus
[53:02] christ with the sunlight
[53:04] it brought out what you really was in
[53:07] the beginning
[53:09] when you were born defeated that's not
[53:11] who you were
[53:13] when you were born in the mud that's not
[53:15] who you really were no sir that's right
[53:17] people wanted to tell you that's what
[53:19] you are people still today want to tell
[53:21] you that's what you are but guess what
[53:23] down inside of you is a life that's
[53:25] going to push that's going to press and
[53:28] push back against the darkness of the
[53:30] world around us till one day we stand in
[53:32] glory next to our king amen
[53:36] that is who we really are
[53:39] that is who we really are you see it's a
[53:41] powerful thing when somebody really
[53:43] believes in themselves amen you can go
[53:46] study uh muhammad ali the boxer
[53:50] statistically physically wasn't
[53:53] better than the next guy
[53:55] but he believed he was better than the
[53:58] next guy and he convinced them that he
[54:00] was better than them
[54:02] he got in their heads
[54:04] so you got to do
[54:05] say hey satan see the devil already
[54:08] knows he's defeated that's right so that
[54:10] that part is already done for you
[54:12] you just have to
[54:14] amen
[54:15] that's why we are the bible listen to
[54:18] tapes right what is it doing it's
[54:20] telling i tell i get up i remember it's
[54:23] telling me chris
[54:24] you are victory
[54:27] chris
[54:28] you are victory amen oh it comes in many
[54:31] fashions the story of lazarus
[54:34] the story in genesis
[54:35] no one in the ark you are victory
[54:40] it's the faith that rises up in you
[54:43] that is the revelation that cry
[54:46] revelation of what god has called you to
[54:50] be
[54:53] praise god
[54:55] see you have to accept it amen
[54:58] many times you're all
[55:00] well every time you're already delivered
[55:03] you just have to accept it and it's not
[55:06] complicated
[55:08] you just have to say you know brother
[55:11] bug when did you start smoking
[55:13] just did
[55:15] you just have to say
[55:17] now is the
[55:18] time
[55:20] if you really believe that god can do it
[55:23] you will step forward and accept it amen
[55:25] that's right
[55:27] praise god yes sir
[55:29] it brought out what you really was in
[55:31] the beginning you see what i mean you
[55:33] saw the light you bloomed out you laid
[55:35] your heart open and now you're a lily
[55:38] that's it
[55:39] you remember my sermon on the lily
[55:41] reverend lilly how he toils and yet does
[55:43] he not spin and yet solomon and all his
[55:46] all of his glory is not arrayed like one
[55:48] of these
[55:49] look at him he's ready he takes nothing
[55:51] for himself
[55:53] the lily don't care about himself what
[55:55] does he do he throws his beauty out his
[55:58] life that others might see
[56:00] his life is expressed out amen
[56:05] then others might see the glory
[56:08] what's in him that was in him in that
[56:10] mud
[56:11] now he's on top
[56:14] lily's like still waters
[56:17] that's what they grow
[56:19] they only bloom for three days
[56:22] every year
[56:25] and the last thing they do is they
[56:26] spread to help the other flowers
[56:29] they give of themselves
[56:31] what's that what but what about them say
[56:33] eternal life was living forever
[56:36] god brought you from the mud set you on
[56:39] top now gives you the beauty of a lily
[56:41] you bloom you receive life you become
[56:44] germinated by the word and then you
[56:46] spread and you give yourself out
[56:49] you live your life for others
[56:52] in an expression of what god has called
[56:54] you to be
[57:01] praise the lord
[57:05] what does he do he throws his beauty out
[57:08] that others might see the glory of
[57:09] what's in him
[57:10] that was in him in that mud now he's on
[57:13] top that's the overcomer he overcome the
[57:16] mud he overcome the things of the world
[57:17] now he freely gives himself out
[57:20] everybody can look at him his life you
[57:22] can't put a finger on it see he's a real
[57:24] overcomer you can't say nothing about
[57:27] him now
[57:28] say he come out of the mud but he's not
[57:30] in the mud now
[57:33] he's not in the mud now
[57:35] oh well you were born defeated that's
[57:37] what satan loves to tell
[57:39] remember the fall remember the flesh
[57:41] that you live in remember how you were
[57:42] born defeated remember when you were in
[57:44] the mud and you couldn't see the light
[57:46] remember that that's who you are that's
[57:48] who you really are this is just an
[57:50] illusion this isn't reality
[57:52] this isn't you know this is
[57:55] but this is not what you think it is
[57:57] he likes to paint a picture he's a he's
[57:59] a he's an artist
[58:02] he's an artist but he paints with
[58:04] fake
[58:06] paint you remember the emperor with no
[58:09] clothes
[58:11] the man sewed him the most beautiful
[58:13] outfit or so he said
[58:15] nobody could see anything but nobody
[58:17] wanted to admit they couldn't see
[58:18] anything
[58:21] there's never nothing there
[58:24] but god's word is the reality amen god
[58:28] word god's word is what's real
[58:30] so it's true so then if the devil's
[58:32] talking to you what is that it's a lie
[58:36] but god's word says you can and you will
[58:40] have victory
[58:42] but he's not in the mud now he's on top
[58:44] of it amen you you can't now point back
[58:47] what he was what is he now he's on top
[58:50] then the bee comes by and says that's a
[58:53] wonderful perfume i believe i'll go and
[58:55] get my part he just opens up his heart
[58:57] come on now all right everything takes
[59:00] from him see he's a real pastor he
[59:03] expresses the glory of god and look
[59:04] where he come from he had to overcome to
[59:07] do that amen you see god had attributes
[59:10] that he wanted to express
[59:13] he wasn't god until he had people to
[59:16] worship him
[59:17] definition of god is one that's
[59:19] worshipped so he wanted to express that
[59:22] he was god
[59:24] he wanted to look so he created people
[59:29] created you and i he wanted to express
[59:31] he was a healer so we got sick
[59:33] he wanted to express all these things
[59:36] that he had inside of him so he created
[59:38] us
[59:39] to fulfill the other part of who he is
[59:44] we complete him
[59:47] that's not blasphemy saints of god mrs
[59:49] jesus christ my wife completes me
[59:53] we complete christ
[59:56] he needed us
[59:58] amen he needed us so he had attributes
[1:00:00] that he wanted to express
[1:00:03] so we had
[1:00:04] hardships and we had trials and we had
[1:00:08] captivity but god was able to express
[1:00:11] himself express his attributes
[1:00:14] but guess what because he called you he
[1:00:17] has attributes he wants to express
[1:00:20] through you
[1:00:22] he has attributes that he expresses on
[1:00:24] to you when you're healed
[1:00:26] unto you when you're delivered but he
[1:00:28] has stuff he has attributes he wants you
[1:00:30] to express out because guess what you
[1:00:33] become
[1:00:34] part of christ you express and you
[1:00:37] unfold the life of christ to the world
[1:00:39] around you you're going to express the
[1:00:42] attributes of christ
[1:00:45] so in order to be an overcomer you have
[1:00:47] to have something to overcome
[1:00:50] he wants you what does the scripture say
[1:00:52] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:00:54] lamb and the word of the testimony god
[1:00:56] wants is coming for a bride that's an
[1:00:58] overcomer
[1:00:59] can you be an overcomer unless you have
[1:01:01] something you need to overcome
[1:01:03] absolutely not
[1:01:05] absolutely not
[1:01:07] if i want to build a wood desk i got to
[1:01:09] have wood
[1:01:10] i found a bit of melted metal desk i got
[1:01:12] to have metal
[1:01:14] i got to have what i need in order to
[1:01:16] bring forth what i want to express
[1:01:19] god saved you filled you with the holy
[1:01:21] ghost and he's calling you to overcome
[1:01:24] because he wants that attribute
[1:01:26] expressed through you so guess what
[1:01:30] you're going to have things that you
[1:01:32] need to overcome
[1:01:34] the flesh every day of our life we have
[1:01:37] to overcome
[1:01:38] this man when you bite your tongue you
[1:01:41] overcame that man
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:46] and grace wanted to express
[1:01:48] his attributes through you amen
[1:01:54] praise the lord
[1:01:56] your first birth could never bring you
[1:01:58] to life
[1:02:00] so god brought the victory to you
[1:02:05] he said you know what he sent adam and
[1:02:07] eve down there
[1:02:11] and they fell
[1:02:16] so then he said down
[1:02:18] isaiah
[1:02:20] job
[1:02:22] jeremiah
[1:02:24] they testified of what god was going to
[1:02:27] do
[1:02:28] they testified of the victory that was
[1:02:30] coming
[1:02:31] they talked about it they preached about
[1:02:32] it
[1:02:36] malachi
[1:02:38] jose
[1:02:40] expressing prophesying of what god is
[1:02:43] and wanted to express but there was
[1:02:46] still something missing
[1:02:48] there was still a part that had to be
[1:02:51] expressed in order to receive the whole
[1:02:55] god had to come down and
[1:02:58] take the sting out of death
[1:03:01] death so that you could receive
[1:03:03] spiritual life god had to calm down and
[1:03:06] bridge
[1:03:07] bridget chasm
[1:03:09] bridge the the the
[1:03:11] the space between man and god because
[1:03:14] there was something there in the way
[1:03:17] he wanted you to be an overcomer but
[1:03:20] bulls and goats didn't do it right he
[1:03:22] wanted you to express this he wanted you
[1:03:25] to be victorious
[1:03:28] but the blood of an animal didn't do it
[1:03:31] it only
[1:03:32] described the attribute of victory
[1:03:37] it only was a shadow of what god had in
[1:03:40] store
[1:03:42] the life that we live today is only a
[1:03:45] shadow of what god has in store for us
[1:03:47] in glory
[1:03:50] saints of god you have been called to be
[1:03:53] to come through that shadow because you
[1:03:56] now have the complete and whole part of
[1:03:59] christ
[1:04:00] don't live in the shadow the bible says
[1:04:03] the a though i walk through
[1:04:05] the valley of the shadow of death we
[1:04:08] don't stop in the shadow we don't say
[1:04:10] wow look at the shadow of that cross
[1:04:12] it's beautiful no we see the shadow and
[1:04:15] we look to the real thing
[1:04:18] it's the shadow is just describing
[1:04:21] everything that god has for you when the
[1:04:24] spirit of the lord falls and it's a
[1:04:26] blessing on your flesh it's a shadow of
[1:04:28] what god wants to do inside of you
[1:04:32] when on the outside it's it's raining
[1:04:34] because guess what you're on top of the
[1:04:35] waters
[1:04:36] you grow in still waters but it rains
[1:04:39] it storms
[1:04:41] the the waves can get big down there
[1:04:43] with the wind
[1:04:44] storms can come through you say oh i
[1:04:46] came through the muck and i'm on top and
[1:04:48] now you're you know you're facing the
[1:04:50] storms
[1:04:51] but you see it's the victory that god
[1:04:53] gave you over your defeated birth that
[1:04:57] you can find victory in again when you
[1:05:00] say if he did it once back there he can
[1:05:02] do it again today
[1:05:04] he gives us examples in the scriptures
[1:05:07] and an expression of his attributes
[1:05:09] through the victory that job had over
[1:05:11] his trial job was down in the muck if
[1:05:15] you will if you allow me the liberty to
[1:05:17] say so yo job was down there in the mud
[1:05:20] but you see god wanted to express
[1:05:22] something through job god wanted to push
[1:05:25] something out through job god wanted to
[1:05:27] show the power of christ in a man god
[1:05:31] wanted to show what a man can do when
[1:05:34] he's really really tied to christ
[1:05:38] so the frogs and the fishes came along
[1:05:40] and said you're just a muddy sinner job
[1:05:44] you're nothing you're defeated you're
[1:05:45] born defeated there's nothing that you
[1:05:47] can do you are a secret sinner
[1:05:50] and job stood and he said i i i am not i
[1:05:54] am fulfilling
[1:05:56] scripture amen
[1:05:58] i am standing on the shoulders of
[1:06:02] jehovah
[1:06:04] i am expressing what god has i am
[1:06:08] serving god i am giving and full of
[1:06:10] surrender to god
[1:06:12] but you see all they could see was the
[1:06:14] boils that covered him from head to toe
[1:06:16] how many times does the brother or
[1:06:18] sister is covered in boils
[1:06:22] it's an outward expression you can see
[1:06:23] it
[1:06:24] and we want to say oh
[1:06:27] they must have something they're doing
[1:06:28] wrong
[1:06:31] when they're just job
[1:06:33] amen about to express an ultimate
[1:06:36] victory
[1:06:38] what is the story of an underdog without
[1:06:40] defeat
[1:06:44] there's not much of a story in them in a
[1:06:46] team that's got all the best players
[1:06:50] all the best facility the best coaches
[1:06:53] and wins every single game there's no
[1:06:56] story
[1:06:59] but when you have a defeated team
[1:07:04] who realizes their full potential
[1:07:07] and
[1:07:08] loses a game
[1:07:10] and loses another game
[1:07:14] and then
[1:07:15] begins to win a game
[1:07:18] begins to get closer to the same points
[1:07:21] a tie
[1:07:23] to an ultimate victory there's a story
[1:07:26] there
[1:07:29] god wanted to show
[1:07:31] that it didn't matter what the
[1:07:33] circumstances around the man
[1:07:36] it didn't matter what it was that he
[1:07:38] that was in his life
[1:07:40] that was so dear to him that was shipped
[1:07:42] away it didn't matter
[1:07:44] god wanted to show the power that he has
[1:07:47] when a man is harnessed to his will can
[1:07:50] overcome the greatest of tragedies
[1:07:53] so that when you are having a hard time
[1:07:56] getting out of bed tomorrow
[1:07:58] you can remember job
[1:08:02] so when you have a hard time
[1:08:04] next week on your job you can remember
[1:08:06] job
[1:08:08] so when we preach services like this we
[1:08:10] can't talk about job
[1:08:13] you see
[1:08:14] a story of the expression of god's
[1:08:17] attributes
[1:08:19] manifested through a man that we could
[1:08:21] call brother
[1:08:23] a man in our shoes that we could call
[1:08:25] brother expressing the attributes that
[1:08:28] god desired even though he was born
[1:08:30] defeated
[1:08:33] god had a victory for job to come to
[1:08:37] gideon was living defeated
[1:08:41] gideon was born defeated you say pick me
[1:08:43] a man that's born defeated uh gideon
[1:08:47] if you lived with him
[1:08:49] remember that guy getting in high school
[1:08:50] man that guy was such a
[1:08:53] yeah i remember what's he only
[1:08:55] collects green for daddy
[1:08:58] not much of a man just kind of you know
[1:09:00] whatever not much of a warrior
[1:09:06] you see
[1:09:07] we're all born defeated when we come out
[1:09:09] of the womb
[1:09:10] gideon was born defeated out of them but
[1:09:12] gideon stayed defeated
[1:09:16] just because you're born defeated
[1:09:17] doesn't mean you need to stay defeated
[1:09:20] that's what god
[1:09:23] that's
[1:09:24] what the title is about right you're
[1:09:26] born defeated but you have to come to a
[1:09:29] victory
[1:09:31] you're born defeated but
[1:09:34] you are an attribute of christ
[1:09:37] gideon was down behind the wine press
[1:09:40] and i apologize for always using gideon
[1:09:41] maybe somebody just needs to hear about
[1:09:43] gideon more often
[1:09:45] or maybe i just connected with him
[1:09:50] and the angel says gideon you are a
[1:09:52] mighty man of valor
[1:09:55] no i'm not
[1:09:58] okay
[1:09:59] real mind
[1:10:01] gideon an angel of god
[1:10:04] just told you
[1:10:06] you're a mighty man of valor
[1:10:08] no i'm not gideon
[1:10:10] get in when's the last time you saw an
[1:10:12] angel
[1:10:15] no i'm not
[1:10:16] gideon
[1:10:18] an angel
[1:10:20] told you
[1:10:23] you are
[1:10:25] a mighty man of valor
[1:10:28] whoa
[1:10:29] yeah wow okay
[1:10:30] uh get in do you know where angels come
[1:10:32] from
[1:10:34] do you know where the angel got that
[1:10:35] message
[1:10:39] christ
[1:10:40] amen do you know where your angel got
[1:10:42] his message
[1:10:45] straight from the throne
[1:10:46] christ you are a mighty man of valor i
[1:10:50] could call every single one of your
[1:10:52] names and say you
[1:10:53] are a mighty man a mighty woman of valor
[1:10:58] you already are amen gideon says okay i
[1:11:01] kind of sort of believe that but i need
[1:11:03] to test that i need to i need to make
[1:11:05] sure that's true let me allow me to run
[1:11:07] a few experiments
[1:11:10] god in his infinite mercy and wisdom and
[1:11:13] patience allowed that because guess what
[1:11:16] if gideon
[1:11:17] and that's
[1:11:18] if gideon just would have
[1:11:21] buried his doubts
[1:11:23] pushed them aside they are still there
[1:11:26] and just okay okay yeah let's do this
[1:11:29] but all the time thinking huh was that
[1:11:32] really an angel
[1:11:33] was that really
[1:11:34] the gideon in the beginning turned and
[1:11:37] faced them thomas in the beginning
[1:11:39] turned and faced his doubts
[1:11:41] he didn't just go with the crowd because
[1:11:43] that was the right thing to do he didn't
[1:11:44] just get up and and praise god in the
[1:11:46] meeting because everyone else was he
[1:11:48] waited and he said i'll fleece
[1:11:51] no no doing the ground
[1:11:53] though fleece wet
[1:11:55] the fleece dry dew on the ground
[1:11:57] an offering of food
[1:11:59] consumed by fire
[1:12:01] gideon was offering up
[1:12:05] himself
[1:12:07] he was surrendering his doubts of who
[1:12:10] god said he was now you see the next
[1:12:13] time you say well gideon had doubts
[1:12:14] again he did
[1:12:16] but those doubts for whether or not he
[1:12:18] could be victorious over the midianites
[1:12:20] but he knew
[1:12:21] he was a mighty man of hour
[1:12:24] because christ told him he was
[1:12:27] born defeated
[1:12:28] living defeated but then the message
[1:12:30] came you are a mighty man of healer he
[1:12:32] stood up and then he went forward
[1:12:36] and
[1:12:37] had victory
[1:12:38] god shipped him of all the men
[1:12:42] testing him
[1:12:44] why because if he had all the men of
[1:12:46] israel
[1:12:47] guess what scoffers could have said well
[1:12:50] you had a lot of soldiers
[1:12:52] but i said let me let me really prove my
[1:12:54] point
[1:12:56] scoffer should have said oh yeah but if
[1:12:57] lazarus had died
[1:12:59] let me prove my point well yeah if
[1:13:02] lazarus had been in the grave for four
[1:13:04] whole days
[1:13:05] let me prove my point
[1:13:07] you see sometimes we think god's not on
[1:13:10] time
[1:13:11] sometimes we think why isn't this prayer
[1:13:12] been answered yet when all god is doing
[1:13:15] is creating
[1:13:16] a greater testimony
[1:13:18] because somebody needs to hear it
[1:13:21] maybe you
[1:13:23] it's going to bless you but maybe god is
[1:13:25] conditioning and setting forth in you a
[1:13:28] place where you can speak from
[1:13:30] experience and say you know what four
[1:13:33] days late still on time
[1:13:36] oh he passed away but god spoke his name
[1:13:39] from the grave he was in a dark cane and
[1:13:42] a stone was rolled you think their
[1:13:44] destiny is sealed
[1:13:46] you think your loved one's destiny is
[1:13:48] sealed because a stone is rolled over
[1:13:51] the cave
[1:13:54] god says
[1:13:56] lazarus come
[1:13:58] forth lazarus come forth
[1:14:03] did he walk out perfect no he came
[1:14:06] walking out in grave clothes
[1:14:07] he came walking out showing signs of the
[1:14:10] world but god said
[1:14:12] take those off of him and let him go
[1:14:16] you as a child of god have the ability
[1:14:19] to stand in faith and remove the grave
[1:14:22] clothes and let them go
[1:14:24] are they bound by your unforgiveness are
[1:14:27] they bound by your bitterness are they
[1:14:30] bound by your inability to see the true
[1:14:32] potential that god has placed inside of
[1:14:34] them because all you can accept is the
[1:14:36] outward muddy nature amen but all they
[1:14:39] need is someone to say you
[1:14:40] are a mighty man of valor all it is i'm
[1:14:43] going to say you are better than this
[1:14:47] i had the opportunity the last few days
[1:14:49] to visit with an old friend
[1:14:51] who's not serving god
[1:14:54] he told me he wants the message to be
[1:14:56] true
[1:14:58] but he just
[1:14:59] hasn't come there yet
[1:15:02] and i said you have
[1:15:04] these are my exact words but i said you
[1:15:06] have potential
[1:15:08] i'm not lifting myself up
[1:15:11] in any way i'm sharing a testimony
[1:15:14] i believe one day
[1:15:15] we're gonna see the fruits of that
[1:15:17] desire you know i'm not gonna look at
[1:15:19] the man on the outside i'm not gonna
[1:15:21] look at what he's doing or how he's
[1:15:23] talking i'm going to look at the desire
[1:15:24] that's in his heart
[1:15:26] guess what sometimes that desire doesn't
[1:15:28] come from their lips
[1:15:30] sometimes that desire can can get won't
[1:15:32] express it verbally to you but you have
[1:15:35] to have faith that the mud that covers
[1:15:37] that lily
[1:15:39] is going to wash away in the light of
[1:15:40] the sun
[1:15:42] and you have to
[1:15:43] believe it
[1:15:44] as much as you want them to
[1:15:47] amen now i believe we're going to see
[1:15:49] your testimony
[1:15:53] praise well the musicians want to come
[1:15:55] tonight
[1:16:01] you know we sing that song he's in the
[1:16:03] house
[1:16:05] and i thought it was very fitting
[1:16:07] because that's the story of i think it's
[1:16:09] jairus daughter
[1:16:12] dead
[1:16:14] but jesus said
[1:16:16] no
[1:16:17] she's just asleep
[1:16:19] what did he see he saw a true potential
[1:16:22] he saw born defeated
[1:16:25] but resurrection
[1:16:27] destined
[1:16:30] lazarus was dead he was born defeated
[1:16:33] and he died just like his body was
[1:16:34] destined to be but god said the story
[1:16:37] doesn't end here
[1:16:40] and god called out his name from death
[1:16:44] that little girl was lying there
[1:16:46] everybody was crying everyone was sad
[1:16:48] everyone had given up hope
[1:16:51] because she had passed away
[1:16:53] but god came in the house
[1:16:56] when god comes in your house
[1:16:59] when god comes in the house
[1:17:01] victory
[1:17:03] has arrived
[1:17:05] and he said look
[1:17:06] saints of god he said look my children
[1:17:10] she's not dead
[1:17:12] she's just asleep
[1:17:14] she forgot who she was supposed to be so
[1:17:18] she fell asleep
[1:17:20] maybe it was on a church pew maybe it
[1:17:22] was at home but she fell asleep
[1:17:25] she forgot who she was she didn't stay
[1:17:28] awake she fell asleep saints of god
[1:17:31] don't fall asleep
[1:17:33] don't fall asleep stand up and remember
[1:17:37] you are victorious i know you're tired i
[1:17:40] know you're weary but god says don't
[1:17:42] fall asleep
[1:17:45] we know some that have fell asleep we
[1:17:47] want to say they're dead but god is in
[1:17:50] the house tonight and he says they are
[1:17:52] just asleep
[1:17:54] and the word will speak and the word
[1:17:56] will bring them from that place and they
[1:17:58] will stand alive
[1:18:00] testifying of the power and the grace of
[1:18:03] jesus christ
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:08] because he's in the house
[1:18:10] he said well i i can't i can't my kids
[1:18:13] are falling asleep what do i need to do
[1:18:15] get jesus in the house
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:18] i'm falling asleep i i have my sword and
[1:18:21] my vision is swimming i'm falling asleep
[1:18:24] get jesus in the house
[1:18:30] because he has a desire to see you
[1:18:32] express the attribute of an overcomer
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:36] he's going to give you oh they have they
[1:18:39] want to prescribe everything for for
[1:18:41] people that fall asleep more caffeine
[1:18:45] but it only works for a short amount of
[1:18:46] time you go to revival you just drink a
[1:18:49] big old thing of caffeine a big old
[1:18:50] thing of spiritual revival at a meeting
[1:18:53] and then it goes away because that's all
[1:18:54] it was it was a flesh stimulant
[1:18:57] but god's not calling you to just that
[1:18:59] he's calling you to a deeper thing and
[1:19:01] that was in my notes take me deeper
[1:19:04] that's my desire lord take me deeper you
[1:19:07] say oh you know that brother is such a
[1:19:10] man of faith and his desire is crying
[1:19:12] out saying take me deep
[1:19:13] [Music]
[1:19:14] the deeper you go in christ
[1:19:17] amen the more awake you are
[1:19:20] the natural types of spiritual they have
[1:19:21] a perversion they call woke
[1:19:25] guess what
[1:19:27] the reality of that is a bride that's
[1:19:29] standing
[1:19:30] wide awake
[1:19:32] oh the music of laodicea is playing
[1:19:34] softly the music is playing softly
[1:19:38] trying to put you to sleep
[1:19:42] but you gotta have that thing inside of
[1:19:44] you that keeps you woke
[1:19:46] if if you will permit me to use that
[1:19:48] term amen god has given us the ability
[1:19:53] we were born defeated
[1:19:55] but a victory has to come
[1:19:58] amen praise the lord
[1:20:01] like preaching more but i don't think i
[1:20:02] have any more words
[1:20:05] let's bow our heads
[1:20:08] you know he says we're born defeated in
[1:20:11] a defeated world with a defeated people
[1:20:13] with defeated creeds with defeated
[1:20:15] denominations but we have to come to a
[1:20:18] victory
[1:20:20] the victory expresses what's been hid
[1:20:23] all along
[1:20:25] yes everything around you is defeated
[1:20:29] the creeds the denominations the people
[1:20:31] the world is defeated but you stand to
[1:20:34] testify of the victory that is found in
[1:20:36] jesus christ heavenly father lord jesus
[1:20:39] i just asked or not knowing exactly how
[1:20:41] this is going to go tonight father i
[1:20:43] just pray that father what was said lord
[1:20:46] would touch the hearts of your people i
[1:20:47] know i needed to hear it
[1:20:50] it is an encouraging father
[1:20:52] lord so many times the devil with
[1:20:53] through conflict is one of us that wants
[1:20:55] to tell us we're less than who we are
[1:20:57] make us feel inferior to the promises of
[1:21:00] god but those promises are exactly for
[1:21:02] us
