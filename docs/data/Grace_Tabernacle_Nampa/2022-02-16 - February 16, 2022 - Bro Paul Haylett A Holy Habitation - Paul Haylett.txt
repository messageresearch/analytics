TRANSCRIPT
========================================
adore god bless you the healing and grace are our hearts always hunger for oh our hearts always hung before beautiful you know as we're singing this song it um brings me in remembrance of something i just read a few days ago i thought it was so beautiful prophet of god talking about our lord jesus took our sin so completely that it became his sin so that we should take righteousness so completely that it would be identified as our righteousness oh i tell you i i just stirred my heart it's not we're trying to be righteous somehow but he let us become his righteousness and i say thank you tonight amen that song just inspired me reminded me of that how beautiful that is of what god has done for us and can we say it is good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen god bless each one of you well you know brother james as soon as he realized we had a technical problem here uh said we're gonna have a good service amen so i'm gonna fully just expect that and confess we're having a good service tonight amen you know we're over at brother riches and i realized how completely spoiled i have become with the brothers just making everything work so well and stuff so amen god bless you sister tonight sister to bethlehem let's just stand go into our bibles i want to be we are witnesses again just a continuation of that thought i am so glad my brother and sister that god saw us to be worthy to be his witness amen of all of humanity that he could have chosen and i don't know it's been preached on a lot but i just got excited the other night as i'm just reading what the prophet of god was saying about job and i i hope you can catch this but you know when he spoke to job and he says where were you tough question huh brother trevor man stop but look at the difference of the age that we live in job had to stop and think about where was i but the words been revealed in our hour that if the lord jesus christ come tonight and said where were you when the sons of god sang for joy and the heavens rang and we'd be able to say i know where i was at hallelujah because the word's been opened to us and and i just got so excited reading that thinking thank you lord we don't have a big question mark out there hallelujah amen hallelujah let's just turn i want to speak to you tonight on a holy habitation amen and to take that out of ephesians the second chapter verses 17 to 22 and uh just uh desire tonight by god's grace to to just bring this little thought to you amen ephesians the second chapter verses 17 through 22. amen i kind of pulled this back a little bit to just try and keep this i one thing about it saints you know we can always go and read the big picture right just go back to you know ephesians 1 and just start reading and go to three or four and we get the whole picture of what was being spoken i feel the same way many time about the quotes people are like well you know you cut this off cut that off there's nothing hindering anyone from going and searching it out people say well you took that to make the point you wanted to make well good you go home and read all of it and you'll get the whole point amen not just the few minutes that we have ephesians 2 and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners i can say amen to that but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth into a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god through the spirit heavenly father we ask you to come tonight and lord i just lift a thought to you lord just reveal to the brothers father where to look and how to fix and father you know all things and i know you care about these things and ask you lord tonight for the saints and those who are not here tonight for whatever reason lord whatever circumstance just asking for your hand of mercy upon each one we ask father lord for revelation not as it were that we would look in the bible and say oh i understand this better or greater but father we want you to come down in our heart in our soul lord you yourself as the prophet of god says in the person of jesus christ we invite you tonight lord and we thank you for what you have done for us we're looking for what you will do tonight and in the future father lord to take a bride home lord that's what we're searching for we ask for your word to be open to us now in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now i just want to as a little prayer in the back there just pray a little prayer with me if you would or for me that i can just be real concise tonight there certainly is a a great abundance of avenues as it were uh in this word amen but i i one thing that really touched me as i've been reading these scriptures for a little bit uh you know that he come and preached peace to you which were far off and uh you know the thing i love about this is uh our lord jesus christ not being a respecter of person but also because he knew where we were it wasn't as though we had to travel through life until we stepped on the x he knew right where to find us he sent the word to us he brought us into his presence and so to those who were near and to those that were afar off he he knew who he was speaking to and he knew where they were amen uh in in the beginning as it were and so you know i i just love that it see it's not uh dependent upon our uh position and one thing that really strikes me by brother and sister and i've seen through the years by personal experience that it is very hard not to be a respecter of persons let's think about this you know um i i believe it's a true story back east a pastor new pastor of a large church and never been there before it's supposed to be a sunday the church was packed out everyone's an expectation but the pastor actually showed up dressed as a bomb and stood by the front doors of the church and tried to break into conversation with people and people just basically brushed him off and so as time comes for the service to start you know the bum disappears and you know then they're there and they're awaiting expectation for their pastor and and they're a little dismayed because their new pastor has maybe he didn't make it here until down the center aisle comes the bomb and one of the deacons even said sir you can't go up there so it's really hard for us not to be a respecter of person if he had walked in in a fine suit they would have realized this is our new pastor but he come and he used that as an opening you might say a a statement to the church and then he told them he says i believe we as christians have a lot to work on and uh you know it's it's very hard but look at the word here the apostle paul's coming and he says i'm a fellow servant he put himself right here with us he put it right in a place and said you know what i'm not above you even though he used words and was speaking i paul a prisoner of christ i paul an apostle i paul but he come down and put himself right back to it and you know that's one thing i love about the ministry i remember as a child saints it's it's it's very interesting the profound things that you remember as a little boy hearing the message for the first time and you know you have to forgive my family my mom and dad did their best but i i remember at the time we were introduced to the message uh you might have been dismayed to see you know this shaggy boy with hair down in his face and on his collar and i remember my dad i say this with humor he said we're going to this house we are going to sit and we're going to listen to a tape and you children if you even so much as move when we get home i'm beating you not a very good introduction to the message right but i tell you what i remember from that very first night good evening friend did not come in a great prestigious deal did not come as an article but come as a friend a fellow servant to bring the word to draw us in and it's interesting in the day that we live in and i don't want to get sidetracked to that but there's a lot of distractors detractors uh those that are trying to stir up the pot about it's this and it's that but my brother and sister as we read the quote the other day it's when it becomes personal they can say this is this but you can say sorry i was there when it happened and that is what we're looking for that kind of relationship today not one based on you or you or you or you or you or you on me but we have that relationship that's based upon that personal experience of jesus christ and to me you know i guess i i hate to admit this but i find myself being very analytical which is a fancy word for critical just spelled different and i want to know why i drive my wife crazy she says why do you always answer questions with a question i want to know why she's asking the question before i answer the question make sure there's not a hidden motive but look at this my brother and sister when we're looking in the word we're seeing uh the clear picture of the apostle paul is not coming to build a kingdom not coming to have a great big parsonage not coming in fact through history we see that when there was no support from the church as it were or the saints he would sit down and make tents he didn't say i i'm not gonna do this or do that unless you guys support me in the style i want to become accustomed to but a true servant of god whose heart was there and god had molded that character of that man to be able to come and bring a pure unadulterated word not affected by the politics of the day not affected by popularity and movements but to be affected by the moving of the holy spirit and i say god help us amen now look at this i love this verse 20. he said and are built upon now let me back up a little bit see you're no more a stranger aren't you glad you can walk into the house of god among strangers as it were because you don't know them but in the preaching of the word you're not a stranger and as it is i i can say this when they see you praising god when you walk out the doors they know you're not a stranger in that house they they identify who with you and who you are and you see i love that because it is not just a group of people thrown together we're not strangers and foreigners but we have become fellow citizens and and the gospel is so beautiful because my brother and sister sister sorry i got kind of a little hesp tonight sorry but we all understand the value of citizenship the value of you know so to speak having a right and not in the sense that the world takes rights but you know to know that when i say rights i mean we have right to boldly approach the throne of god because we know who we are we know that we've already been accepted in the beloved we're not hoping but we have a confidence because we have already come and as i spoke to you the other day we have seen our adoption papers they've been revealed and everything according to it has been signed sealed and stamped in the blood of jesus christ oh how beautiful that is and to be of the household of god you know there's nothing like i was thinking about this the other night we were invited i'm going to work on not naming names we're invited for dinner and it was just a lovely time a comfortable time i just slouched down in the chair at the table ate all i could eat went back for dessert three times see there's something about knowing you're part of the household knowing you're not a stranger there knowing that you don't have to do everything prim and proper which we wouldn't have a clue how to sister jerry tells me if you ever paul go somewhere there's all kinds of silverware on the table i know you won't know what to do so just start on the outside pretty good advice but that didn't cover it all what do you do with the one that goes crossways at the top of the plate and what do you do with the small glass and the large glass and what do you do with all this but you see when you are in the house of your own family praise the lord amen no sir i'm in the house with my family hallelujah that's good preach it brother chris i'm hungry i come to the house of god tonight hungry keep preaching i know might not have enough place settings to cover this whole meal i can reuse this fork a boy you go into a different house and brother branham said well i won't go into what brother branham said something about a dying something uh why because they're afraid to express from their heart but when we've come into the household of our god who has showed us clearly who we are we can just be ourself hallelujah we don't have to go on some kind of presentation jerry and i was joking the other day you know if this stuff gets too far along we'll come down to the time kind of like the pentecostals and we'll just have to have sister emmy or sister ruth just sit at the piano sister sarah whoever it might be just sit at the piano through the service and if we say something that's worthy they'll be like [Music] why because the people don't say amen so the piano has to say it for him so pretty soon you can see whether or not the piano player is revelated but we have no clue what the rest of the family is doing but look at this my brother and sister as it is now i want to hurry along here and see we are built upon the foundation i've been preaching a lot of foundations and ironically brother chris was had on his heart to go that way with the young people and different things interconnecting but look at this he says you're built upon the foundation of the apostles and so tonight because my name happens to match the apostle paul i'm going to just look and focus on building what he said and you know how important that really is saint you say well why'd you choose him over the others well my brother and sister when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time and he's there and that they're speaking and he says i preached what paul preached he didn't i'm sorry we're not taking some preference here we're not trying to be respected as a person but he didn't refer to timothy or luke or john or anyone else he come back i preached what paul preached and the response of the believers was we're resting on that because there was a foundation and any true believer amen knows he can go back to what paul preached and latch on to that and start building his habitation amen so it's there that it comes this foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone now you know i can't really i i i don't like to to do this but i'm sorry i'm going to name names amen tonight as it were amen but you see all of this at verse 20 none of it matters if jesus christ is not the cornerstone if we have another cornerstone if our cornerstone is our church or a certain ministry we're in trouble my brother and sister but when the cornerstone is jesus christ he as a master builder now the apostle paul said i a master builder but what paul was really saying is he that's in me is the master builder and so i have come to lay the foundation for you to build upon and now he's clarifying jesus christ is the cornerstone so you got to start building the house somewhere right so you start at the cornerstone and you build the house as it were around the cornerstone and i'm telling you my brother and sister it don't matter how rough life is if jesus christ is our cornerstone we're going to make it we we pray for brother marty we pray for sister laura and many others i know there's many requests that just kind of slip from our memories and lord forgive us for that but my brother and sister no matter how rough life is if jesus christ is our cornerstone we're going to make it amen brother jason as you said whether her sister laura whether she's healed here or steps beyond the curtain of time into that perfect body we know where the stand is she has confessed it she's lived it and still as cancer eats her body is confessing not i hope to be healed but her confession is i am healed amen why because she's got a cornerstone she went back and said everything of my house has lined up with this cornerstone as it is you know it's so many feet here so many feet here so many feet here so many feet here a window here a doorway here and everything fits trust me i've been there before in the natural framing houses and you go to do a layout and you're like uh guys there's something wrong this foundation will not support this blueprint what are you gonna do oh you know what we just decided folks that are paying a few hundred thousand for this house that it looks really cool for the floor joists to hang off the foundation it makes a good spot for your cat to get in where it's warm know what you do is they stop and say we got a problem we got a serious problem a problem that warranted a trackhoe ripping out a whole foundation now do you know that god loves you so much you'll bring a spiritual track hope into your life and rip out your foundation because he is going to bring you to that place that you are a holy habitation and we say oh lord no and he says yes for you to be who you're called to be i got to tear this out and rebuild it because otherwise you're patched together christian i don't need a patch we have the song the patched up life oh no wait that's not how it goes the original life the original word was patched up just for you and i i don't mean to sound facetious tonight but i want to make the point god don't deal with that he deals the original word as the perfect word come from the mind of god was expressed was manifested and come to life in you and i amen not something patched together not not something that you know i don't want to go back to the bedrock to straighten this out but i'm telling you my brother and sister it's all about the cornerstone amen so you know the scripture tells us that jesus christ as the cornerstone become a rock of offense but my brother and sister there's no way a god called son or daughter amen you know what i'm saying there's no way a god called son or daughter can be offended at the word there's no way that we can come to a place that we say i just can't accept this in fact as we were speaking the other day there's something that's built into the believer that such a hunger that causes them even though they feel like that they have been peeled with a potato peeler they go i gotta go back that's all there is to it i got to go back that's who i am this is not who i am this is what the devil tried to make me into but i see who i am and lord i come back now look at this you know i say this with a bit of humor sometimes i'd like to stand up and say um brothers just stop preaching you're stomping on my thoughts but you see here now this building is so fitly framed together that it groweth into a holy temple in the lord so this is as brother chris preached about the altar this is not something that man has been allowed by god to hew here and hew there because then it would be as it were a pastor would hew the church into his vision of what a good christian or the perfect christian is but you see when the pastor would be there looking at the cornerstone and that cornerstone is anchored in his own life he'll sit in an office he'll sit in his home in the car whatever and say lord let me just speak what they need to hear not what i want them to hear but what they need to hear that they might walk out satisfied in their spirit and so it's there that as brother chris preached just to bring this into context amen god did not allow a tool to be put to the rock thank you for that sermon brother chris that was good no tool to be put to the rock i want jesus christ in this church in my life in your life unadulterated untrained unchipped unaffected i want it to be the original word coming forth that we can literally anchor our souls to it and build hallelujah because you see if it's man's work it'll bring man's result amen so as brother chris preached the other day no tool could be put to the rock to the stone it had to be the original and i'm telling you my brother and sister if i could just take this it's the original word you might be just living life and it's good and you'll be doing your devotions and you'll read a scripture and there'll be a little something i know you'll be able to say him into this a little something pangs in your heart and you're like oh lord what is that and then he starts to deal with you over something and it might be something you totally forgot about something went over your head or it might be as it were i'm going to use the term revelation that god's opening your eyes to something and we say thank you lord and we like that i love revelation but did you know revelation is interesting because god uses revelation to expose our unbelief our fears our doubts we don't normally look at revelation like that do we we look at revelation as like oh look at that but how about when revelation is you have a smudge on the hem of your garment that's revelation my brother and sister we might think oh no problem no problem i live in a as it were dirty world and he says nope smudge must go and we start to look at that and at first we think i'm okay i'm okay i'm okay then we start to realize by revelation not okay oh my you know we talk about praying for patience and we sometimes kind of joke about that i wonder how far can we go to pray for correction maybe we could add that to the list of the things that we pray for lord correct me prophet of god i read you the quotes he says you know we need to repent every day so we come to the point we might as well just go ahead and on our prayer list just pin in there pray for correction because you see we don't want to be the rebel we don't want to be the one that decides a house would be better with a different cornerstone now let's look at this as i move on real quickly here fitly of a type suitable to meet a required purpose in whom all the building fitly framed together growth into a holy temple in the lord i want you to think about this saints just before we move on god said you were suitable you're suitable to fulfill this calling he said i need a bride in laodicea one that will not fall like eve did in the garden but she's going to stand upon the unadulterated word and she won't be moved from that and so what i've got to do is go now and search the earth as it were just let me do this figurative we know it didn't work that way but let me search the earth and i'll find those who are suitable to be my bride now to the married people here today you know we didn't just go out here and go down to the mall and say well brown hair blue eyes five foot whatever first one that meets that criteria i'm gonna ask her to marry me i shouldn't say it this way but forgive me first one you meet that might be that criteria might look like a fence post and i can assure you that it's going to take the lord leading you to marry somebody that looks like a fence post because we as humans just like peacocks like all the beautiful colors but you see that ain't how we search for a wife or a husband right so god when he come down he said you're suitable come on saints i want you to just grasp this tonight are you grasping it am i just being too redundant forgive me tonight i might be on my redundant mode but i want you to grasp this that god said you're suitable to be my bride and that's why i started to reveal myself to you he didn't reveal himself just because he does that he's revealing himself to his bride that his bride can realize that she was chosen before the foundation of the world that she has been positionally placed and now she's receiving that and can move together now look at this in whom ye also are build it together it's verse 22 uh together for a habitation of god through the spirit now i just want to make emphasis before i move on here the word together means simultaneous it include includes companionship or close association hallelujah family how much closer can we get you see when we move into this realm to realize that god is not just revelating the prophet of god made a statement in this fashion he says it's not about these revelated or i'm i'm kind of paraphrasing it these guys that are in the spirit in the pulpit he said it's about the whole church it's about the body receiving the word amen and coming what is it not not now there will be those of us uh those of you let me put it that way that will spiritually catch and move forward in things a little before others but you see it's a simultaneous move of god and the holy ghost when i say simultaneous to drive that home is god will be preaching on these very same things all the way in africa and south america north and south and east and west because he's working simultaneously in a bride of christ he bringing her together into this house all at the same time don't ever feel like you've been left out my brother and sister god might be stirring you to be more sincere god might be stirring you to to uh more well let me just read this jude 1 1-6 jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ oh and cold mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith see not a hap hazard when it works when it fits my schedule when it fits my lifestyle when it fits my world but he says that you should earnestly contend for the faith which is once delivered unto the saints now this once delivered some people some theologians want to say you know as a past tense but really what the word is saying here that this was delivered this was one time once delivered some take it in the other side of the definition as a context of a past tense but truly what this is is god delivered one word he doesn't have two messages doesn't have three messages he doesn't have you know how is it brother chris you you computer people it's like version 2.1 2.3 2.7 3.2 god don't have versions he give it once he delivered it to the saints once it's there there's a period of time that the word came just as it is in our day there was a period of time but i'm asking you tonight you don't have to lift a hand but is the holy spirit still opening the word to the bride a prophet of god has been gone since uh 1965 amen but the holy spirit is still opening the word and where's he taking us back to that original once that it was delivered not a second version not a third version not a laodicean version amen just like you talk to somebody about clothes and hair and baptism and this and they'll look you in the face and tell you that was for way back then this is different now it doesn't fit the bible he says for there's certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation now you know some people don't believe predestination but um my brother and sister it's just pretty scary when you think about it but let's not think about the scary side tonight i want you to lift a hand to heart and rejoice predestination and and we'll maybe this next sunday lord willing we'll go into that but my brother and sister some people's idea and i already kind of gave a prelude to this some people's idea when you talk about predestination is though god put somebody in a headlock and said i'm going to make you go to an altar but what he did is put us in a heart lock and our heart is what took us to the altar our heart took us into consecrated life our heart took us deeper in jesus christ there was no big strong men in fact it turns big strong men into humble men but it's there that god makes them because the heart then leads the man right even modern science will will tell you that there's an influence that they still haven't been able to quantify some just want to call it emotion well if god used emotion to break me down to come to an altar to repent then praise the lord for emotion if it was something deeper in our heart well praise the lord for that too so you look at this so we see that the the men are creeping in unaware so they've been they made it into the church and nobody really recognized them and uh they have been uh ordained uh to this and he says they're really actually ungodly men regard regardless of what the outside looks like they're ungodly men and uh they're used you've got to be careful about this but let's just stop for a moment and take this back remember all i'm doing tonight is stirring up your pure minds we deceive the very elect now if we just cut that off right there i'm terrified but praise the lord the bride recognizes it's not just as it were somebody speaking to them but it's her husband and he said but don't worry about it deceive the very elect if it were possible kind of makes my heart sad when people are just so so terrified of being deceived come on let's just get into the word get consecrated get sincere and know where we stand and know that we are in the word we have been adopted into the beloved and we are steadfastly anchored in jesus christ we don't have to worry about being deceived oh does that mean we don't need to pray don't need to read our bible no my brother and sister we need to do all of that but god said you when you come to the crossroad and don't know whether to go right or left he'll the holy spirit will lead you on where to go amen and it certainly helps as one brother preached one time he said it certainly helps if you've read the road map before you need to turn right or left then verse five is not a downer but you know what it just says i'll put you in remembrance though you once knew this that how the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt in other words called them out of the world brought them into the word amen brought them into goshen and afterwards destroyed them because they didn't even believe think of all those people saints that left egypt they got to see the supernatural come on let's face it we're at the red sea there comes pharaoh's army in our flesh we're scared silly and we face circumstances in this life that we look at that and we look at the world and we are scared silly come on let's admit it we're like lord what do i do what do i do we have this situation we have that situation but my brother and sister these people before they actually made their final decision had seen just as much supernatural as they had seen of those things to be terrified of so they made the decision not god they made the decision whether to believe or not people say well why would god do that well god didn't do that the scripture says that he destroyed them that believed not you say but predestination falls in there but you know what there's that little narrow avenue where if a man now this might be controversial so take it with a grain of salt there's that little narrow sliver the prophet of god talks about if a man who's not even predestined but he'd believe that these words of god were for him that god would make a way for him if he'd stand on that word and believe it god would make a way for him now my brother and sister pardon me tonight i'll express a little opinion i don't plan on being a doormat in heaven but i'd rather be a doormat in heaven than any other alternative yeah yep now we distort sometimes the whole glass of water thing and i don't know which way to go on that you know i think personally sometimes people take it a little far but my brother and sister god knows might be at a certain moment in your life someone does that does that thing and god says i'm going to honor them for the sake of my beloved my wife now think about it in a natural term what if your wife brothers was on the side of the highway with a flat tire and you're not available and some gentleman stops and says ma'am no please don't get your clothes dirty i'll change your tire for you we'd be appreciative wouldn't we we'd be saying bless this man and you see god looks at this because saints we're not people oh that's going to sound weird are you all ready to be weird we're not people we're god's habitation that means we're not name your name we are mrs jesus christ we are a part of him we are identified in him we are not just put your name in the blank just people believing but god views us not as just some singular person walking on the earth flesh that was born of man but we are here my brother and sister as the very habitation of almighty god and sometimes we forget that like real regular come on real regular we forget that and we're just bonnie sue and life is hard but how about we put that before us that we truly are the habitation in other words we are as they say years ago we used to put it this way part and participle because we didn't get the particle right but a past particle no a present particle yeah talking to a man today i said yeah i'm a high school dropout and basically he's like i can tell but you see i want to make a point right here i will put you in remembrance though you once knew this how the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt after word destroyed them that believe not now look at verse six and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation they had an identified habitation in the almighty almighty creation of god i don't even know how to put it towards they had an appointed habitation that they could dwell in and they would be pleasing to god and be part of this great eternal plan of redemption that god has and they chose to leave that estate and they left their clearly identified habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains in the darkness and the judgment of the great day so they come my brother and sister a conscious decision anointing many people describe it many ways but they come to a place that the very habitation that god gave them they looked at that habitation and they looked at an empty promise they looked at a vain promise and they left the very promise of god for this other promise or habitation as it were and they said you know what i value this more than the habitation of god and it was in that realm that their condition was changed forever sure wish we had this screen 1964 726 brother branham preached recognizing your day in its message paragraph 135 he said parallel it with today amen praise be to god it's more than life to me my age begins to creep on and i see the hour of vulgarity and immorality sweeping the lands and things then i look back and see what's happened in that we can state this i believe we can take those sentence right there and say that fits today he said my heart leaps for joy knowing that after a while this earthly tabernacle of habitation will be dissolved but i got one waiting yonder i'm trying to pull a chomp them from these things and things and pull them out to show them by the scriptures that god is standing there with a vindication of the pillar fire which hundreds and thousands have seen even had it took before with a camera time to time to prove it impersonators rise up you want to have a good view of the impersonators i should be careful there's big kids probably follow through that but all you have to do is type in church preaching religion into something like youtube and it pops up oh my i don't want to get critical tonight but if you can stomach that you could probably stomach almost anything they're up there skinny jeans shirts unbuttoned but it's okay because i have a big cross hanging there they got styled hair that looks like they dumped some contacts he meant on and then they tell the people this is god's promise to you if you need this or this or this god's obligated to give it to you god's not obligated to no god said i'm in my word and i obligated myself to my word that's the only thing i obligated myself is to my word now when the words in you and i he's obligated to us but when we're outside of the word it's not obligated and people want to put an obligation on god and so the world now my brother and sister now the prophet of god talked about when these people start thirsting for the holy ghost it's getting close and people are now starting to rise up and say yes we've gave millions to these people but we realize they're actually serving themselves and not serving the body of christ and people are starting to push that so the impersonations paragraph 136 impersonations rise up sure it's got to be done impersonators rose up in the day of moses and done the same thing god said separate yourself moses don't ring don't hang around them i'll swallow them up and it's interesting how many people read that don't make the correlation to the day we're living in brother brown says and the world got them he didn't say the earth swallowed him up do you see where he makes the transition right there and the world got them and so it is today they go right back in the world money schemes and everything else see oh um if you guys are interested in the latest lmm what is that l m l m you know i'm not very experienced at this we have a sign up sheet in the back i'm telling you saints as long as god would allow me you would allow me to be a pastor of this church i will burn down anybody trying to sell that in the house of god i will be beyond rude i'll have to repent to you afterwards but you see this being fulfilled we see this happening over and over and over again and all it is brother trevor you can build your own little thing and you don't want sister carrie to build on yours you want to build your own and she'll build one so all i need is 500 a piece sister sue i know it'll be painful but i just 500 you'll get it back you'll get rich and i've seen it sweep the church and we say we're message believers and the prophet of god says words like this and they don't even it don't even touch them why because they're building the wrong habitation they're not building a house of god they're building a house on earth now we all have to live right amen but brother and sister the prophet god's saying you know what they're going to do they're going to have money schemes and everything else now we're going to go back to jude jude the first chapter as it is only chapter verses 20 through 25 but ye beloved building up yourselves in the most holy faith praying in the holy ghost now i had an individual one time say brother paul i don't understand that praying in the holy ghost i had to look him in the eye and say i don't know i don't understand it either what you're the preacher you should understand it now let me tell you why i don't understand it because there's times saints that i pray for things i pray for things in this body of believers i pray for things in my family and i go before the lord and i feel like i have been kicked drugged and whatever just and i say lord just lord i need you to i need you to just take care of this i don't sound like i'm praying in the spirit does it god answers that prayer so what do we get the idea that the preacher or the wife or husband is say you know in their their devotions oh the praise alone you're going to do this lord for me oh they were in the spirit i've seen it in church i've seen people almost almost you know cause them to go to the chiropractor the next day because they're there oh praise allah that's not the spirit my brother and sister the spirit is when your heart's desire and the character of your soul is lined up with the word of god there you're praying in the spirit it doesn't require a bunch of shouting it doesn't require running it doesn't require anything but to get in that and say as it were to put it simple you see jesus prayed in the garden in the spirit lord thy will thy will be done you see he would have been out of the spirit of what god was accomplishing if he'd have said lord i've decided to do something different here but he got in the spirit he knew where god was taking him saints when we're in the word and we have claimed the word we express the word and we are desiring to live the word you will find yourself praying in the spirit and god will cause you to pray as the scripture says we don't even know how to pray we don't even know what to pray for but the holy spirit guides us we pray in this spirit oh i i think it's it's nice when we get you know an anointing we get excited we you know just to have a you know a time of prayer just so thank you lord i know you're gonna come i know you're gonna do this lord your word promised it i believe it lord that's wonderful to pray that but i'm telling you my brother and sister day in and day out we don't feel that way do we if we lift our hand and tell the truth but we can get in the spirit and it's the holy spirit guiding us when we say you know what i i'll just put it kind of direct lord i i just know that brother so and so sister so and so they've got struggles they've got troubles there's something happening they've got teenagers lord the lord i know you promised and you're going to deliver and this is your heart's desire and this is what we desire and it don't sound so beautiful but god says that's what i wanted you to do i wanted you to bear one another's burden i wanted you to enter in for them i wanted you to become an intercessor but here again a little off track but i want to say this we find ourselves saying lord i need this lord i need this my family lord this this this probably not in the spirit saints amen you know you'll have more blessings if you'll pray for everybody but yourself now imagine those of us here tonight if every one of us truly prayed for everybody but ourselves i'm not going to count it i'm just going to say there's 35 of us there's 35 people praying for me or myself one i think i'll think i'll settle for i'll pray for all 35 of you if all 35 of you will pay pray for me amen makes way more sense but you see the word foundation is that we don't live for ourself what the prophet of god tell us being a christian is living for others let me change that being a christian praying for others being a christian serving others oh while i was talking somebody stole the time now look at this keeping yourselves in the love of god this is connected together my brother and sister remember we're the ones that have put verses and periods but beloved building up yourselves and your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ into eternal life and some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even a garment spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise god our savior be glory and majesty and dominion and power both now and ever amen so he closes this whole thought out my brother and sister by telling you and i that god is going to keep us amen that we are held by the power of the word we'll keep you from falling and we'll present you faultless now i can't stand here tonight and tell you i'm faultless i don't believe any of you can sit here tonight and say i'm faultless but there is one who has said you know what i can make this tabernacle this habitation be faultless it will be perfect according to the plan by which i come to build it and it's in that that we have security i think for the sake of time i'll move but move on here but in earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints brother branham is telling them that they're preserved going down through that starting right the very start of the of the sermon paragraph 4 and he says now you're the people i'm talking to that will earnestly that will that you will earnestly contend for the faith it was once delivered not the not a faith that was delivered but the faith that was delivered not a faith but the faith did you notice there the faith once delivered to the saints not just a faith some people say well that's against my faith there's only one faith one faith one lord one god one baptism one faith and people say now i have a faith and i go to my own church well that's not what jude's speaking to here he's talking to the people that's to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints amen saints i regardless of what the world thinks about you and i they make their little videos they make their little declarations of why you know they make use words like they're arrogant no i'm not arrogant i'm willing to concede that there is thousands and tens of thousands of people that god will say but there is one thing i can declare to you i absolutely with every fiber of my being believe i'm one of them now i'm not going to be condescended to as though i'm just some kind of trash when i am of the royal seed of abraham when i have been spoken through the word and declared to be of the mind of god and the spirit of god my brother and sister i don't mean to come across there again i want to be confident i want to be able to come boldly to the throne of god if you don't have confidence in who you are and what god called you for you will not come boldly to the throne you will come as a beggar you will come as one thinking that they are unworthy and we all deal with that can we be truthful oh i'm not even worthy well good he said you're worthy now you can believe yourself the devil or god make your choice he said you're worthy i'm worthy he said i'm chosen i believe i'm chosen he said i'm sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and i believe that amen he said you know now let me just jump along here now if we'll go back to where they first called saints and found out what kind of faith they had then we'll know more or less what they contend or what to contend for now when the church be called was called saint was after they were sanctified and the word sanctified or saint becomes sanctified meaning clean pure holy unadulterated so forth that's my heart's desire now if there was in the beginning of the church when it was inaugurated at the day of pentecost now let's look at what they had back there what the church contended for and what they lost now just 33 years after the beginning of the church now you know jude wouldn't be talking about back in the old testament under the levitical law see because they were he's a christian he's talking about the first church was set in order was inaugurated on the day of pentecost and i'll just paraphrase some of this they'd already lost it come on saints i i don't want to sound negative here what are we 60 get my brain to do the math 56 56 years they lost it in 30. that be right 1965. oh yeah okay i'm sorry i just couldn't get my brain to wrap around that my wife's 56. come on think about it the original church lost it in 30 years and we're 56 years from the lord taking the prophet home we must be tough we're smart we're street wise no god rich in mercy god rich in mercy amen let's never stop thanking him we're going to close right here in just a second i got all kinds of other stuff here now we noticed what kind of faith they had they had a faith in a resurrected living christ someone who had rose from the dead and was living among them just the same as he was before he ever died now that sea they wasn't contending for some historical affair but they were contending for a living christ a resurrected one who is in their midst that's what we're contending for not history saints now i'm going to take this just a little step further if you don't mind sister emmy if you'd come the prophet of god uses these words right here and he says but they were contending for a living christ a resurrected one who was in their midst now when you go my brother and sister into genesis and you start looking into the fall in the garden you'll find that in that context it didn't come as a revelation to the mind it didn't come as a motivation to the feet but a living god who was living in the midst that's the kind of god we're searching for and we are serving today one in the midst now we could take that in a different context and say he's in the middle of this room so he's in our midst but i don't want god just in the middle of the room do you no sir i have got a habitation i've got a tabernacle i've been allowed think about this the privilege that god has given us we have then been given the privilege been allowed to build a habitation for god and god said because i love diversity and amazing how satan has taken the word diversity turned it into an entirely different thing but god loves diversity that's why he has you that's why he has me you know i just think about this i've said this before sounds very arrogant and i guess we don't take it away from that but uh you know it would have been much more convenient as a pastor if we just had a whole church full of people just like me but that is what god wanted he wanted a bouquet and he wanted you to build your habitation and imagine i'm closing i'm done the lafontaine sing that song are you she we're probably all familiar with that i want you to really think of the depth and anointing of that because my brother and sister this age is the worst worst yeah only thing could have done worse than that would put a the on the front the worst wicked age brother rich and i was talking he had done all the math you have to make some assumptions x amount of believers on the earth real true sons of daughters of god he said my mouth paul says that out of the river euphrates was dumped another 20 000 demons for every believer on the face of the earth you wonder why some days feels like you're finding an uphill battle he was just making that point all of those demons been dumped out upon you and you're fighting your way through them but god said don't worry i'm right on time i'm running time i'm with you i'm walking with you i've already made the way before you i made the rough way smooth and i provided in fact the answer is already on the way so let's just look up and say you know what lord i'm building this house not for paul haley put your name in there i'm not building this house for me lord i want to build this house for you and i want you to be pleased and habitate this house i want you to come down so to be pleasing i need to build a house that he wants not the house that paul wants sorry to reference back to brother chris but it just strikes me easy has a price my brother and sister it could be so easy to be a christian and we'll just trade easy for eternal life lord help me to fight give me strength give me courage but most of all lord let me go back to the cornerstone amen to be a real true carpenter i i learned to frame houses under a man that said now i want you to listen to me boy you will measure two three four five times but when you cut that it better be right help us help us lord that we don't just take the easy way but we look at this and say lord this is a house i don't want to worry about i live in lord am i building a house that you will live in that's what we're searching for saints amen reminds me a little story you know the story the man had been the foreman building big beautiful houses for everyone and he thought this last house i'm going to be cheap on it and i'm going to pocket some of that money because he's retiring and i have nothing in the end you know a story i'm talking about in the end what does he do this cheap chintzy house he built was given to him let's just for a moment here think about the natural the carnal when the doorknob come off in his hand and the windows won't open when the cabinets shelves collapse every time he'd been remembering if i had only just built this to what i was supposed to build this i would be living in a beautiful house lord help us saints i just want to encourage you lord help us when it gets hard press harder pray harder amen call on him more trust him more because he's actually the one building this house i say thank you lord he's building it with his word he's building it by the leadership of his holy spirit amen hallelujah brother jay help me sing this song this is your house let's just stand worship the lord a song or two i've kind of kept you a little late here longer than i thought i would amen i cut it in half and it was still too long amen hallelujah we've set aside this temple for [Music] let your glory fill this sanctuary be enthralled in the praises of your people lord we agree in unity this is your house father come and dwell this is your house it's a holy house of prayer where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their cares this is your house this is your house this is our prayer come and dwell [Music] holy spirit overflow this place decorate our walls with grace and mercy let healing and redemption find searching souls lord have your way we humbly pray this is your house father come and dwell this is your house it's a holy house of prayer where the lost and the loneling bring their burdens and their cares this is your house this is your house come and dwell hallelujah i'd like to take that song and place it right down to each one of our lives not talking about a building but lord come in this house come and dwell amen amen let's just sing that little chorus that song jesus draw me close yeah hallelujah jesus just lift your hands your heart let the world around me fade away oh jesus draw me close closer lord to you for i desire worship and obey let's just sing it again oh jesus draw me close lord that's our prayer closer to you let the world around me let it fade and away oh jesus draw me close closer lord to you for i desire to worship and obey can we say amen to that hallelujah i'd like to sing psalms 19 as our dismissing song you know it's very providential i believe when we look at this song because it's actually declaring to us that this word right here is unerring infallible it takes the educated and god hides himself from it but we come in the simplicity of the word and he reveals himself i i love this song is all i can say hallelujah the law of the lord is perfect [Music] converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making gold statutes of the lord all right [Music] rejoicing the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes more to be desired a day than gold gave a much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb [Laughter] the fear of the lord is clean [Music] enduring forever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous all together and in the keeping of them there is great reward there is great reward in the keeping of them there is great reward god bless you saints i trust tonight this whole foundation in building a house has been weighing quite heavily on my heart because as i look through the land and i interact with people i realize how many foundations were not properly laid and people wonder why they're not finding liberty in the word they're not finding liberty in their life sometimes we just have to go back and examine the foundation and as it were find what was not put in the right place and find what is missing maybe altogether and there it's nothing to be ashamed of it's god's desire that we come to that place that we have built a perfect habitation according to the word of god and i just encourage you in your prayers and your devotions in your scriptural readings your study of the message just stop regardless of what we've been taught before i've been doing this myself recently and i'm reading this scripture and i'm saying lord my understanding you see it's not about oh this is this and this is that but lord is my understanding correct i want to understand the word and i want it to be alive to me so when i build upon this i don't come up with the wrong conclusion and saints i just encourage you we're not backslid we're not lost but i believe as we get closer to the coming of the lord it's kind of brother branham calls it a checkup time let's check up god bless you we love you in the lord we'll see you on sunday amen
