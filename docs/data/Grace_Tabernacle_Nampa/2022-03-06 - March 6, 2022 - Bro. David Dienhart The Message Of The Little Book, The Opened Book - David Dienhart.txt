prayer this morning it just moves right along with the message brother tim god bless you and everyone that's here god bless you you're happy good to see brother vasily sister tomah god bless you nice to have you back home and just god bless everyone and good to see you're feeling well now brother ivan good you're feeling better amen now don't you get it maybe you've already got it i don't know okay okay happy to be in the house of the lord amen god bless you i won't need the songs thank you for playing appreciate the instrumentals i appreciate those that play the instruments of mystery you know amen and those that have well we all have it's not just those that have we all have brothers and sisters in christ all over the world in ukraine and we're especially holding them up in prayer not only ukraine russia poland latvia lithuania belarus whatever it is it's just they're brothers and sisters and i know there's bride in every one of those countries but you know what let me just encourage those and i know sister yulia you have a cousin family i know vasili ivan the super family have family here in in ukraine but brother branham said let me remind you of this brother brown said nothing can happen by chance to a christian nothing he said because all things work together for good to them that love god that are called that are the call you notice he didn't say a call thee called according to his his calling his purpose exactly right and you know every member of that bride and i believe that's the calling that's the called every member of that bride is under an eternal purpose amen so we have nothing to fear not one thing to fear not one thing to be anxiety over and i know sister toma her mother and i don't know if she's still out of the nest can't get into the nest because i know they have a barrier there now and but here again every believer every one of them nothing happens by chance you know in our human mind that's where we have to lay down our human mind which is easier to take the reasoning of the devil science and education amen or simply take him at his word which is easier god made it simple didn't he he didn't have to figure anything out just take me at my word believe what i said it's got a mad come to manifestation why because it's eternal amen so god bless you nice to be in the house of the lord i'd like you to stand with me and we'll have a word of prayer and we'll go to the word of revelation the revelation of jesus christ i'm referring to it that way because that's what this book of revelation is is the revelation it's the complete revelation amen there's two books that satan hates genesis and revelation because the revelation the genesis exposes him and revelations the alpha and omega it's the same person he showed forth in genesis what he would do in revelation amen and so we are just happy in this hour to be walking in such a light isaiah 60 says thy light has come and such a light that we can walk in you know those that are those that we walk in the light the bible says we're walking in the light and in him is no darkness at all amen so we aren't in darkness we're in the light we're in him this is the message that's his message god is light and in him and if you're in him praise be to god what's there to fear he is my light and my salvation psalm 27 1 he is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the bible said goes on to say and i think in that same scripture he said i said if the war rise against me and this will i be confident that i'm seated in heavenly places in christ jesus seated hidden in the secret of himself who can touch you when you're in him who can touch you what plague can come nigh your dwelling your dwelling is christ his dwelling is you but your dwelling is inside of him amen so you're protected that's to the born again that's to those seed that have been quickened amen and become the holy spirit in you you are the holy spirit in you and so and that's the word i thought sounds strange but that's the truth that couldn't be opened to us until this hour amen amen so we have the light and so the bible said and i think it's psalm 91 he said though a thousand he said the thousands shall fall by my i think my left side and there are ten thousand on my right or vice versa i can't remember but it shall not come not you right amen you'll see them fall on this side and fall on that side exactly what's happening exactly what's happening the word of god's got to be fulfilled that's what it's all about in ukraine amen the word of god is being fulfilled but the bride of jesus christ is the word promise for this hour made manifest the word of promise which is god himself in himself the bride amen heavenly father as we bow our heads in your presence this morning we are not here by chance we have not been seated here by chance where these people are seated right now is not by chance there's not one thing by chance lord that we've come here now and i pray that every heart has come open to receive the word not them not a word of david not the word of a man but they've come here it's not a man among us no flesh shall glory in your presence we have come here to receive the truth we have come here lord because we're hungry we have come here needing more of you because we have a goal and that's the change of our body and you step forth in this hour to receive a son to yourself that where you are we may be also you had to take the book and you had to claim your possession that you have already redeemed but you come forth to claim it now father we don't know when that last one comes in we don't know that but lord the door will be shut and we trust it isn't shut yet that there's still lord and i know the bride has a hungry heart and i know the bride will be willing and is laying in the presence of the son eating the opened word bless your word this morning now i pray as we give you all the time you need we're not going to put you in a box this morning and say you've got to do it according to our thinking we're asking you to have your fulfill your perfect will and way in every individual may you so captivate the individuals this morning to your word as we ask this now in thy name the lord jesus christ our redeemer our lord our refuge our revelation we pray amen amen amen turn me to the book the revelation of jesus christ chapter 10. several scriptures here we just want to follow as the lord leads us here this morning revelations 10 1 starting with verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven i wonder if we've seen him clothed with the cloud just like he went away he comes again and i in a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the sun i wonder if that could also mean s-o-n they took a picture of it you know as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had i want you to notice who had it in his hand and how does god work how does god reveal his word i will do nothing but i reveal my secrets to my servants the prophets so who did we see manifested through that prophet in this hour who was identified the son of man through a son of man amen then he had in his hand remember brother branham said i was caught up in the consolation and i had to get the revelation of that seal seventh seal and he said i had to come back with that revelation and he had in his hand a little book open notice a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice i wonder if it could be the same voice as the resurrection and he cried with a loud voice as when the a lion roareth remember the lion who is manifested as the lamb couldn't be made known until the end it was the end time the lion was revealed cried with a loud voice is when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write john speaking and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me from heaven seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not brother branham said he couldn't write it he knew what it said but he couldn't write what it said and he said because this is also sealed in heaven remember revelations 8 1 said there was a there was when he had re when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence where in noting this is the mystery now opened what john couldn't write amen all right then i want to jump down here to seven and notice this comes at the time when there's time no longer that's verse six long longer time is no longer delayed remember the seventh seal is the end of time of all things that's why we see things happening the way they are at the end of time it's the end of time of all things amen comes to a close finishes verse 7. here's a mystery couldn't write but but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound watch this the mystery of god i wonder who reveals the mystery of god christ christ is the mystery of god revealed all right all right he says the mystery of god should be finished other words completed as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and when he and and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand now who's he speaking to john being a type of the bride said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel that switched standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel messenger and the angel christ brother brahm said that's christ in revelations 10 i went unto the angel and said unto him give me give me i wonder how many have said give me lord give me the revelation that book give me the little book and he said unto me take it now notice it's been opened by this the messenger of the of the of the under the seventh angel's message his message was to open this little book to reveal the mystery in that book brother branham said his message of revelations 10 was the seventh seal okay okay are we all with all of you all together those seven seals had to be open there were seven thunders but brother graham said one thunder seven messages all right we know a thunder denotes the voice of god it's spake there's a blast of thunder amen and their seven angels appeared that's right is that right all right all right now he says now it's been opened now he's tall asked john he's told the bride you go and take the book you go take the book and you eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter everybody's going to be against you is going to have a hard time is going to call you fanatics they're going to call you this they're going to call you that they think this about that about it it's a hardship a struggle amen in the flesh you're in a battle amen but the battle is not between you and satan it's between god and satan that god in you that revealed word in you the who you are that battles between the word and satan it's not between you the flesh man and satan your enemy is standing right there covering you your greatest enemy you've got the greatest enemy i've got's david dean hart but that enemy is dead that enemy you say well you're pretty much alive to me but that nature is gone that tried to rule over me because i'm a new creation in my soul amen amen so the battle is between what he thinks and what the word thinks but it's not be so that it's between the enemy and god hallelujah he told us what your greatest enemy was and he'll try to speak to you every day in fact he's probably already tried this morning amen he'll try to use the channel of your spirit well god wants to use the channel of your spirit so you have to keep your thoughts under obedience to christ you have to keep your spirit realm your little human spirit realm under obedience to christ so he's at told john you go take it it's going to make your belly bitter but when it comes in your mouth it is sweet as honey how many has experienced that absolutely all right and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as eaten my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy final voice thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings because you've got a message you've got an opened book you know the message you are the message i'll just say that i'm going to preach it this morning my title i don't know if they wrote that down on there but my title is this the message of the little book the opened book or the words the opened record you may be seated the message of the little book amen that message in itself will rapture a bride out of here [Music] amen that message in itself was sent for the going home of the bride it's the seventh angel's message so i'm speaking of the message of the little book and we think it's so deep and so hard it's simply so simple you can't in your human knowledge figure it out that's just exactly what it is it takes the revelation of god to to catch this it doesn't take your intellects you try to figure it out i'll just tell you right now quit doing it because you can't and you're going to get frustrated and upset and you're going to get weird because you can't figure it out it's not your working it's the working of god in you all right i'd like you to turn with me to genesis or our first john i'm sorry go to first john i'm going to go through this as quick as i can and i want to stay focused this morning there's lots of things we could say about these things and i just believe that it's been put down here this has been given here and i i want to bring this in first john 5 and i'll just we could start there at verse 9 or verse 6 actually showing the birth showing the witness of the holy spirit which is the token but it comes to verse 11. or just take verse 10 and he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness the witness is the token the witness is the person of the holy spirit in you christ he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record i want you to notice this he believeth not the record that god gave of his son and this is the record that god hath given to us i want you to notice this this is the record we're talking about a little book that was sealed up and when he had cried when he had voiced the revelation of that book seven thunders under their voices there's something that was said but it was sealed up and could not be made known until this day and the reason it was hid because it was kept from the devil so he couldn't get it but now it can be opened up in the time it was called to be opened up and meant to be opened up and here it is being opened in our day and it's only for the bride brother brahm said the seventh seal the revelation of these seven seals is only for the bride this little book only can contain names and i'm going to say right now because i want to bring it into what the church age here quickly that the though that book contained names and that book was the names of only his bride and it's a part of the lamb's book of life or the book of life brother brahm said there's no difference i can tell you right where he said some think there's a difference between the book of life and the lamb book of life he said it's the same book amen he said there's no difference it's the same book it could be called the book of life the book of christ it's it's several names and the bible refer to that but brother brahm said there's no difference amen because because he said and i'll refer to this in just a moment where that is but he said remember he used the wheat plant as the as one seed going in one seed falling in the ground to bring a multiple of seeds at the end and that wheat plant he said brother branham said there's the book of life there's the they're denoted or brought the revelation of jesus christ because the bible is the complete revelation of jesus christ amen the complete revelation but there is a portion of that is the eternal life record it doesn't mean that all they're on that weren't but names can be removed and we're going to get into this wednesday and what names are saved or what names are not but names can be removed from the book of life but they cannot be removed from the eternal record of his own life so so that that creates people i'm thankful we had a message in this hour to unveil this to us we wouldn't catch it because it sets the bride in her position because this is what the book of the revelation is all about okay so reading again and this is the record that god has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son i want you to notice this life is in his son what was he the seed royal seed god himself veiled in a body of clay manifesting himself through the flesh made him god the son amen are you with me all right then then this son is that royal seed i'm going to come into a little more on that because it's a purpose of god in the revealing of this book there's a threefold purpose amen and this is what we've got to know and spend more time in that so we'll just see how far god goes with this but he that hath the son hath the seed remember the bride is the seed amen amen i you you just you've got if you don't catch that revelation you'll never catch if you don't catch that revelation you'll never see yourself as you ought to see it that's god revealed to you are you seed amen amen because it's the seed that opens that is the open word in the soul okay so he that hath the son hath life that's not human life that's eternal life hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life i want you to turn with me now to genesis so that's my message the title the message of the little book the open book the opened record and my subject is part of this subject is to gather his bride together to gather to gather his bride together and see that we are seeing past the curtain of time so genesis 1. let's get into this genesis 1. genesis 1 26. let's go right back to the record let's go back to the original we'll see here i pray god will just help us to truly catch a revelation of this in our day because this is the message of the hour all right genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth verse 27 so god created man in his own image now you're looking what you're going to read in the image of god created he him male and female created he them there is the image of god not just male male and female amen the image of god he said let's put that in man because i am a man i put that in man and but i'm both male and female and i'm going to express myself here the same i'm going to create a man because i have a i have a purpose in expressing myself this way amen so male and female created he them that's the image of god and now we come over here to chapter two and verse two now we're in the seventh day hello now we're in the seventh day and he said on the seventh day god ended his work i just i just can't keep commenting on all this i won't get done so god ended his work i'm just saying lord just quicken it to him god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work seventh day was a day of sabbath amen and where is our who is our sabbath our sabbath is the holy spirit that is our rest he that enters into his rest which is the holy spirit has ceased from his own labor just like god did on his in his day amen all right but we also know okay well i will go there right now like i say i can't keep commenting okay ended his work which he had made on the and he rested on the seventh day from all his works then i want to go to verse seven and the lord form man man was spirit he was in the image and but but god the lord god formed man of the dust he just took up some dust there's me are you with me he said in god the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground he formed him now how long he took or what he did i'm not i just blew that because brother brown said it like that he said there's another one and there's another one and he said on the seventh day excuse me and in the lord god for man of the dusty ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of what life and man became a living soul third realm third realm your triune being first realm is flesh second realm of spirit but the third realm only the bride can go into that third pull is the opening of the word amen all right it takes the word to do it it took a message it took the turning it took a turning from prophet to his prophecy amen are you with me all right and became man became a living soul then we go over to verse 21 and the lord god calls the d and he says not good verse 18 the lord said it's not good that man should dwell alone god's speaking here's his here's his image it's not good that it's got good that man should dwell alone he's saying it's not good that i dwell alone i will make him a help meet i'll make him a help meet m-e-e-t just for him just what he has need of to express him to be a help to him and alex because it's going to be a man with a womb going to carry my life amen so he said now i will make him a help meet for him okay then in the lord god 21st verse and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man amen he brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh and he could have said what brother branham said on the masterpiece she is him but he said that he said that because she was called woman because she was taken out of man to what was she who was she she was adam expressed in another form all right and so therefore shall a man leave his mother father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife god's still expressing himself here i hope we're seeing the the mystery being expressed here that god has unfolded right in the beginning because here's the original and it comes back to revelation he's alpha and he's the omega therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and he shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh the prophet said i'll just jump ahead a little bit he said the head and the body have united they're no longer twain they are one flesh when could he say that after the message of this hour what would the word produce it would produce that amen right back going right back to eden again okay now isaiah 53. i'm laying all these scriptures down i've got i want i'm pointing to a subject here and i'm trying to hold myself back i'm like a racehorse right here but i've got to hold myself back because i want to get this out isaiah 53 so you pray for me keep me in prayer and i know i'm thankful those who have prayed for me today isaiah 53 now this is the masterpiece amen this is the masterpiece but the masterpiece remember the masterpiece is also and we'll find right here where the female is there portion of him is there remember the eve never took another spirit eve took his spirit he was both masculine feminine in spirit wasn't another spirit it was the same spirit the body was different the spirit was the same all right who has believed our report what a report we've got today who has believed our report them speaking of this masterpiece who's believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed it's revealed to them whoever it's revealed to believes the report okay and it goes on he'll grow up he won't have any beauty that we should desire him he's despised and rejected amen so is he today when he steps down here in the bride form he still despise rejected it shall be bitter to your belly all right he's despised rejected he's acquainted with grief isn't that interesting we say oh he shouldn't have any grief but he's acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs he's carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god smitten of god and afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are are healed amen now verse 8 and you can read how he's oppressed as a lamb to the slaughter the sheep before shears verse eight he was taken from prison and from judgments now watch i'll just say this ahead of time when jesus christ our redeemer went to calvary he was had both he was both male and female she the bride was in him amen all right he was the second adam that's why he had to come through a woman i don't have time to describe that you know that why he had to do come through a woman to take that off the to take that uh well to take the stain off of it he had to come through a woman to be a redeemer satan couldn't get to that woman first god did okay and satan couldn't get to us first god did at the end here he couldn't amen that's why he kept it hid all right now let's go here and he was taken from prison from judgment and who shall declare watch here she is who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living and for the transgression of my people was he stricken verse 10 we want to see her again yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed and he shall he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand first peter 2 9. i want to speak i want you to hold this word generation here just a minute and go with me to first peter generation let me just read first peter first and then generate first peter and i'll give you the meaning of that generation there and we don't have time to speak that i preached a message on it two or three years ago here on the generation first peter 2 9 but you are a chosen generation hallelujah you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness thy light has come out of he's called you out of that in out of dark denominationalism the prophet said out of darkness into his marvelous light all right now a generation means a kind brother brandon made a statement in the church age book she was of him she is she come from him she came he as he was the word made flesh as the seed of god manifested and she came from him he she came from the same source and and brother brown and the scripture said every seed shall bring forth of its kind he shall see his seed and every seed shall bring forth of its kind you can't plant a corn seed and expect to get cauliflower you plant a corn you get corn amen you plant it in the right kind of ground and it's going to produce fruit it's going to bring forth of itself life that was in that original seed comes up through that corn back to many seeds it's the life we're dealing with in this little book the eternal life of himself so the generation is kind it's a kind kind the same kind it's the same race it's his family a generation is a family okay come he they've come from the same source meaning same source an offspring and brother brown said it's a super race and another place he said it's the royal seed the royal race it's a royal race prophet said in this day he would uncover it in this day he would bring forth a royal bride which would be the royal seed to the royal promised son he said that's the promise that's who's to come in this day he said amen all right now in the message who is this melchizedek who is this melchizedek notice now remember brother brown said the masterpiece there's your masterpiece but he said there is another masterpiece in the making it was taken out of that masterpiece amen watch god because all the way from from from genesis he begins to restore and he first restores the adam again second adam are you with me then he brings out of her out of him this is jesus christ all right so now he said notice like the sculpture he hides he hides with a mask over it that's what god has done to this age it's been hid now remember brother branham said but he's come in full view of you hid but you see him he said but unless you're a part of him others don't see him because he's hid so he's been hid today but he's come in full view of somebody because the prophet said he's come in full view of you bride all right now he said it's been hid god has done he's been hid all these things have been hid and well watch it's been hid but it's supposed to be revealed it's supposed to be revealed in this age now the bible says that it will they will be revealed in the latter times they will be they who's they they will be revealed in the latter times it's like a sculpture keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is ah good at me the message of the seventh angel all right all right god and morphy now now now excuse me i'm my head and that's what the bible has been it's been a great it's been a work of god it's been a work of god it's been god's achievement other words it's been a work of god that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and its sevenfold mystery and god promised in this day at the age of the laodicean church this day seventh day in the this day at the age of and the age of his later in church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing god and morphy god above us god with us god and morphy above us god with us god in us the condescending of god great is the mystery of godliness all right we see that then he's got to unveil himself there's another masterpiece in the making revelation 19 7 you know that scripture very well but we're going to i'm going to read it again let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and we don't need to understand if it is or not because the prophet has identified it is and he said and he said let us be glad to rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find lennon what made her ready the true baptism of the holy ghost made her ready that was a pentecost amen that's the pentecostal blessing i'm real pentecostal i'm not a denominational shuck i believe the baptism of the holy ghost brother branham said it was it's the new birth it's god birthing you it's the revelation of jesus christ in you because you're the seed and the seed can't be quickened and reveal anything else but jesus christ in you and he identifies himself by hearing and keeping the word of god all right now and to her was granted anybody else to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find lenin clean and white for the fine lenin is the righteousness of saints amen and he saith unto me right blessed are they they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god amen and i fell at his feet to worship him others going to worship the angel that's revealing this to him amen we don't worship brother branham we don't worship that seventh angel hello and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus who has the testimony of jesus in here then you're a true witness if you can truly have his testimony you're a true witness and it's by your testimony you've overcome and by the blood of the lamb and your testimony all right he said and i am thy fellow servant that brother have the testimony of jesus that's the bride worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy long as that prophecy is with the word you're okay because then you're speaking what the prophet said all right all right now i could go the next verse because we've seen it and i saw heaven opened i didn't hear an amen brother braham said heaven consists of the word where you came from and if you're being ambassador to heaven from heaven from heaven all heavens behind you we saw heaven open and behold a horse is a power wasn't a dark one it wasn't a black one it was a white one amen are you with me all right i won't go any further than that but he already said so in revelations 10 11. you must prophesy again brother braham said she'll ride the trail again following him all right i won't go into all that but let's go here a little further now the bible this bible in the message of the church age brother branham makes it very clear he says that this he said a single grain is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will produce and multiply itself through a certain process during a certain period of time that single seed will die but in dying the life that was in it will come up the life we're told notice we're speaking about the life not the plant the life that was in it will come up up into a plant which in turn will be the bearer the plant will be the bearer or carrier of that life which is to come back to originality in a multiplied form jesus the great royal seed died the matchless one who had his who is the life of the church stands in the midst of the church in all seven ages giving him his giving his life it's the church giving his life to the church the carrier or the bearer he gives his life she's a woman other words are you with me the life the church is a woman she's a bearer she's a carrier of that life all right so at the end of his uh to the carrier bearer give his life to the church to the end that his very life will be reproduced in bodies like and unto his in the resurrection it is at the resurrection that the royal seed will see many royal seeds like unto himself the royal seed will see many royal seeds like unto himself all right and they will even they will be even as he is for said john we shall see we shall be like him now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in a multiplied form this wheat plant is the book of life all right now listen just keep keep with me i repeat the history or record of this wheat plant is the book of life of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a part of that life is a record of that plant is a record of eternal life and he said a part of an apart and he said it's a record of eternal life and that is a section of the book of life now we could go back into several places here and show you that section is the section of his bride and i will a couple places here all right then it's a section of the book of life this is convincingly seen by the examination of the wheat plant so he goes on to tell about the wheat plant now he says no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life that is another record a section though contained in the book of life and i just read you the scripture in first john this is the record that he's given us eternal life all right so it's another he said is another record in that book of life all right then he said he goes on to express it and so the record of the church the wheat the plant he said and and not all the plant not all the plant will give into this wednesday because not all the plant is is used in the harvest and so with the church he said all the church is not bride all the wheat plant is not bride hello he said and neither is it all given eternal life in other words all the wheat plant there's some parts not given it just dies now given eternal life we'll come into the given part on wednesday i'm not going into that this morning all right but i'm wanting to make it known to you that your name was in a section a little book a section of this record of the book of life it was in another record and that's an eternal life record which brother brown said is a section and the names in that book that section can never be removed under any circumstance now i'm going to say that i've got two other places to tell you that but i think i'll just say it out at the same time if you wonder where it is we go right back from page 265 read from page 265 in this book if you have the other book it's going to be a different page number like we it'll find it but at 265 all the way in i'm on page 284. so in through there he keeps he lays it out perfectly where the bride is she's found in this little book that's why the message of the seventh angel was the message of that little book but when he begins to bring that message it causes separation amen it separates the rest of the wheat plant from the record of eternal life because only she can pick up that ministry because she is a part of him as bride there's others we'll get into it more there's others that'll get eternal life at the white throne judgment because their name was found in the book of life but anyone in the record of the section of that book which is the bride section only the bright section is the only one that's going in the rapture the first resurrection and so the rest of this seven ages without us and without this ministry without this opening of this word is not made perfect you see our ministry is not made perfect without us perfect mean mature or complete it's not complete without the book being taken and the claiming of his possession paul even said the ones in the old testament were made perfect i speak of barack and samson and jeopardy and all these things he said and and which the world's not worthy of and he said without us today he said living here under the first coming of christ and seeing the son of god manifest and to realize what it was without us they can't be made perfect amen do you see where we're standing today where we're at all right so i'm not going to go he said but no names no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life that is another record though contained in the book of life it's another record amen that's why it referred to it as a little book and brother branham also referred we'll get to it just a moment what is the bride book all right now so i'm gonna i'm gonna lay that down in a minute and i'll try to we'll come into more of not more of that necessarily but more of and well just wednesday lord willing you pray for me who are these other righteous that are given life in the white throne judgment because it's not the bride standing before him in judgment of the white throne judgment she's judging she's already in the throne this books her book has already been opened her book has already been opened brother brown brings that out in the rising of the sun he said he said there they are standing before but notice the bride's already with him in the throne so when was her book opened at the message of the seventh angel it was sent to bring this bride to her completion to the complete revelation jesus christ said i'm gonna i purpose in myself i will have a bride it's my heart purpose of my choosing he is sovereign in his choosing you've got to recognize that because he chooses by foreknowledge he's elected by foreknowledge amen first peter one two elect according to foreknowledge all right now now we'll jump over here into a message called the ephesian church age paragraph 80 verse 2 the true church of jesus christ the bride the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what she is well excuse me what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her i wonder if we're looking past the curtain of time if we're seeing past the curtain i wonder if we're seeing a message in this hour that's bringing this bride together a gathering could it be i'll well i won't say that i'll come to it in a minute i'll get ahead of myself what is what he is okay she is glorious there's no fault in her she is glorious within and without she is glorious within and without well brother david i don't feel so glorious i got all kinds of mistakes listen if she's glorious within what's god looking at you through all right now she is glorious see we're not speaking about people i get up and sound pretty harsh when i when i what am i looking at i'm seeing a spirit not individuals individual has nothing to do with it i'm the individual like they're an individual full of mistakes and failures and faults and but what are we looking at we're identifying a spirit this message just got so perfected so complete it's such a such a revelated thing that we're recognizing spirits that used to hide themselves are being exposed why because we're in the light i don't feel bad if it sounds like i really come against you hard i'm not against you i'm against that spirit that's trying to kill you i'm against that spirit that's trying to take you away from the true revelation of this word for the season it's a spirit everything even the clothes you wear identify a spirit everything got a spirit behind every word you speak is motivated by some spirit it's a thought first before it's a word we ought to recognize this brother sister see all right i'm going to get off my trails i'm like i mean i don't want to get off the track here so she is glorious within and without from beginning to end from beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect you believe that he said he made your way perfect too being in him how can your way not be perfect how can your way then not be sinless before him amen beginning to ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect now you think i got that for myself the bible said his ways are perfect and he's made our ways perfect go back to psalms and find out if he didn't say that amen it's not my word that's the word of the lord okay from beginning to ending she's the work of her lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god in him is perfect fulfillment amen though once we esteemed him not now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of glory in the midst of the church he stands and we will sing his praises for he's the mighty conqueror he's the head over the church which he's the head over the church which is his bride he bought the bride he owns her she is his and his alone he cares for her he is our king and we are his and we are his kingdom we are his word made life his kingdom in he said and then he says his eternal possession then consider this since it was the blood of god that was shed for you it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood was and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin how do you know it is because you have his life it identifies that you've come through that blood not just you to say you have you believe you have but where's the evidence that you have where is the evidence that except and read and makes known that your faith is his you say what are you talking about the token his own life testifies you've come through the blood you have to worry about it anymore let off the pressure i have the token i have the very life of christ living in me the very literal life he can't deny me he can't deny it then you can apply it amen so he said in them he said he said then that blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the losing is perfect and it's complete there is now therefore no condemnation amen he said who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that declares us righteous justified and then who is he that condemns amen is that right okay now i just went through what i wanted to go through the church age so invisible union remember that what he remember what he said what time is it he said how many remember excuse me the message what time is it sir remember we talked about that what time is it sir how many heard it say amen congrats and says amen this was preached in shreveport 1965 invisible union he said amen was that exactly right amen then we've got i don't want you to miss this now then we have got in this last days the revelation for the message of the lord to gather his bride together no other age has it been promised it's promised in this age it's to gather his bride together i want you to turn with me to to thessalonians or at first turn with me to john 14. john chapter 14 very familiar scripture again verse 2 or verse 1. let your not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many dwelling places mansions are you with me you're a dwelling place of god many dwelling places bodies made up of many members is that right in my house in my father's house that's his kingdom that says that's his domain amen and who is his domain and where is his place of worship but where he put his name and where he put his name was in his bride in his body in himself all right then he didn't put it in a man he put it in himself and the birth of the word is himself in you then where he is there is my place of worship brother brahm said they worship him through the revelation of himself all right now he said in saint john in verse two in my father's house many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you verse 3 and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again [Applause] i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there's a purpose of me doing this there's a purpose in that mystery being revealed that where i am you may be also talk about god's grace talk about the goodness of god talk about a pro talk about the god getting through the message with the message i'm coming down to that in just a minute okay now first our second thessalonians chapter two second thessalonians chapter two this is like a little study a little a bit of a teaching here but ii thessalonians chapter 2 watch what paul says in verse 2 verse 1 chapter 2 verse 1 now we beseech you brethren by the what coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering our gathering brother braham said we have received the revelation the message of the hour for the gathering of the bride and by the gathering together unto him and what message was sent to bring us into that gathering there had to be a trumpet blown a trumpet denotes a gathering it means war but but the seventh trumpet sounded how many know that's true and it denotes a gathering a gathering of who the trumpet was a voice and it was the first trumpet we heard john heard it amen and the voice said something to john come up higher we sing the song don't we there's a there's a bride where the worshipping arise the worshipers are rising isn't there a rising up rising up all right these things may sound a little strange to you but there's a message in this day to take a bride home don't care what the world thinks about it to me that's my husband the word the message is my husband and he's come at nighttime to bring her out of that dark denominationalism like romeo did juliette and it's not a it's not it's a mystery to everyone but the bride he's come for her he didn't come for the rest of them he said this is bride time he said the the churches have denied the word they turned him out now he's turned the corner the opening of the seven seals with the turning of the corner in order for there to in order for that to be revealed there had to come a falling away first and there was the church had to deny the word in their midst and they did church natural so he could turn to that bride right at the time that he said god would choose to strike he did and there's a message went forth and this bride is in a revival and she's in a resurrection and she's raptured in a rapturing power and movement right now it's already begun inside of her and she has the assurance she's already included in it there's been a change and they that were ready matthew 25 10 they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and at that time there was there was a foolish virgin say we need some of your oil we need some of your oil they weren't ready they didn't have the oil but when she went into that marriage she began she began to be clothed with life because it was granted to her amen all right all right here we are and so now we come along here now watch so thessalonians said paul's speaking of the first coming he said we are being gathered together under a ministry of our savior we are being gathered together paul is also speaking of the future because it was at this time and we could go on you could read the rest of the scripture there don't be stirred by a letter from us or by a letter from us or a spirit by word or something see just because god who letteth will let this this this beast can't become beasts this false prophet this thing is happening right now all of nato and everything else ruled by rome why didn't rome standing out against ukraine because it's manipulating money finances breaking the nations bringing her under her they're bringing them under her power that's what's going to make russia bow is under finances amen it's oil remember brother ram said watch when russia goes down to get that oil what's she concerned about right now her pipelines her gas deliveries what's the world threatened about now the gas deliveries the pipeline of oil brother sister we're we're seeing prophecy for him fulfilled the king of the north has kind of started to rise up a little bit hasn't he uh-huh okay i don't know when it's all going to finish but we're seeing prophecy being fulfilled it's happening it's moving in position you know where they'll end up they'll end up in a final battle we're already in the greatest battle ever fought fighting it but it's got to end up in a physical one just like we end up in a physical change but we already are changed amen spiritually amen it's got to end up in a physical battle and that's the battle of armageddon and it's going to end up right there in the land of israel and russia has a bomb for the image which is us united states and a bomb for russia for rome and will wipe her off the map why she's ordained to do it he's ordained the king of the norse ordained jehu again he was used they're you don't you fear russia brother bam said don't you fear russia watch her because she's a time she's a time capsule something's happening when you see russia begin to move here because we have a catholic president and russia is against catholicism and the church is against communism but the bride's being united the rapture do you see you see the three right there uniting with the word what's the bride uniting with you better start eating the book you better lay down your little pity panty ideas and your things and start eating the book if you expect to make it out of here you better start asking god for revelation and get in that book period because you're seeing all these things beginning to happen i'm not worried about the bride in ukraine she's already in christ i'm not worried about the bride anywhere not even here you think we're all god at ease here wait till the money system starts calling in the changing the currency changing they won't change the currency they'll put it under gold brother brahms said when that covenant's made with israel because she holds the paper this bride won't be here to see it and how close are we oh brother sister i'm glad there's a message that was sent for the bride all right i've got to keep moving now thessalonians now we go back we can find where jesus in the fullness of time when the fullness of time singular time then god sent his son born of a woman born in the earth to bring those to send the holy spirit to those that are already his sons you know what galatians spoke so i saved time reading galatians but you know we've been through it we were through it just wednesday amen all right but now i want you to go to ephesians 1 10. we read ephesians 1. you know you're you're you know that you've been chosen in him before the foundation of the world how many know that i say know it do you really know it chosen in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blame before him in love amen he's already positioned us for adoption already did a placing amen see see but it comes down to verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness not of time but of times this is at the end time we've entered the dispensation of times dispensation being the dispensing of it's a dispensing of time it's the dispensing of something happening in our day amen so we see then at the at then at the that in the dispensation of the fullness fullness how many believe you're at the end we've had already received the sign of the end the opening of these seals the seventh seal was the sign brother branham said we have arrived time shall be no more it's at the end amen okay at the dispensation of the fullness of times what is he going to do he's going to gather together he's going to gather that he might gather together in one in one hallelujah in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him you talk about god's achievement we don't realize we're taking it too lightly what this message means the son of man is amongst as right now brother sister the son of man is being revealed he's here the germ has come life is in the grain the head is united with the body amen this is head time these are all things i've got right from the prophet this is this is head time the head has appeared the head is uniting with himself the body the bride this is happening it's already brother sister what do you think that sign was in the heavens in 1963 it was the head coming to the body then we are being gathered by his coming glory to god don't just get dilatory and lazy on it if there's anything inside of your soul you better let god have that tug that's in your heart it's that little tug that god has to quicken it's that little tug that god has to he's sent to quicken amen that tug towards him it's a deep calling to the deep i've got to have more of you god than perish and let go he's calling on you to let go of these things of the world and give yourself unreservedly to him amen amen amen and lay aside every little weight in the sin what is the weight in the sin when satan keeps pointing at you accusing you accusing you accusing you he says yeah i did that yeah i'm saying you're right no he isn't right because you don't realize who you really are of the soul you are himself god himself living in a body of clay and he said to lay aside that weight rebuke it refuse it i don't care if what he tries to come through your senses with reject it and your sense realm your senses of imagination memory reason memory and conscience and affection when he tries to use those things reject him oh he said i wish i could do that the word in you can do it you just need to take it and appropriate it then recognize your position that you're already seated in heavenly places in christ and deny that weight that thus so easily beset you and this sin i'm not i'm sinless but this old boy wasn't born again and if it wasn't for the power of god he'd go wild but it's the power of god that holds this under obedience to the word that's what romans that's what romans 11 8 11 if the spirit that dwells in you that dwells in you he shall also quicken your mortal body brother brown said he'll bring it subject to the word if you don't see that happening something's wrong with your relationship with christ hallelujah all right okay some of this i'm gonna bypass it's the books even sealed in heaven the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world he took the book opened the seals opened the book tore off the seals sent it down to his sent it down not notice what he did he sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people and there was a sword in my hand and it wasn't just a sword it was the king's sword it was the king when he cried king did seven thunder's other voices and it was time for that to be revealed now oh brother sisters brothers brothers oh brother oh brother don't tell us the seventh seal is open i beg your pardon it's open and it's in me revealed whether they like it or don't like it it's that denominating spirit of dominating woman that hates that message and she's against it and wherever is spoken she will be against it amen because that's denominational spirit has tried to infiltrate this message but it can't infiltrate the message of this book because you're the message of the book can't get to you already been set free what a resurrection this is we've had received the voice of his resurrection and we are voicing that voice of his resurrection we become that voice i'm jumping way out of my notes right now but i guess i'll have to because of time all right but i'm going to continue on here until i run out of time all right now there you are he send it down to seventh angel reveal it there you are oh the screams he said the shouts the hallelujahs the anointed the power the glory the manifestation watch what he says here but that he's talking about the dove message wings of a dove he's but he kept climbing he kept climbing enoch kept climbing he was walking with god brother brahma said is the light shone he just made one step higher the next one a little step a little higher and this one a little step a little higher and it was not for god took him god took him what does this message mean to you is it really alive to you do you really realize are you just playing church and have church hannity that's why brother brown said i call for men men of valor men of that's got the sword to step forward and slay these ungodly denominational philistines that want to rise up and blind your eyes where's where's the men like levite that levi that because that spirit entered into the camp he took a javelin are you with me i don't advocate killing anybody but it's time we stood for the word and had a testimony that's not my god that's a wrong spirit amen all right he kept climbing and finally he made it crippled wounded broken bruised but he fell in the camp with the message that was a great dove and we stand justified declared righteous in christ that's what justified means you know we stand justified in christ before him because he cannot pass judgment for he's already judged that body in which i'm a part of how am i a part of it here it is it's in me amen amen there's a message coming forth now and i pray god that you'll let the dove lead and i pray god this morning let the dove lead not your stinking thinking of your old carnal spirit let the dove lead that was pretty harsh you say horse it is it's stinking thinking because we've got we've got this old human element here human mind that the bible already said is your enemy that human spirit is not the mind of god amen you receive the mind of god when the seed in your soul had been opened that's the opening of the book all right now because it was a third pull you have a pull you have a tug and you're wanting something you're searching and there's an answer to it it's called the third pull amen is that right certainly it's right all right now i want to get into this right here if i don't get into anything else today and i believe i will but i wanted to get into this threefold purpose i want you to listen to me carefully we know that the prophet does we know that the messenger the seventh angel the messenger of malachi 4 revelation 10 7 does two things i'm just going to brief this just a moment and he says this now we know the messenger of malachi 4 revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders contained in earth seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the true faith pentecostal fathers not the denominational father and if you think all pentecost is shouting and dancing and speaking in tongues and prophesy i got news for you it's not it's the revealing of the word you just search what happened on the day of pentecost it was the word that was revealed to them the word was vindicated and by that word being vindicated by the holy spirit revealed to them they really heat it up it came by revelation that ought to give an answer to somebody but pentecost shuck has perverted that if you want to see the pentecostal shuck shouting and charisma and everything else you're down the wrong line you're looking at the wrong thing that's not the original pentecost because brother branham said the true worship involves oil and wine it's stimulation by revelation given by the holy spirit amen all right now god's threefold purpose i'm going gonna read some things here now just carefully listen he's speaking on the seventh seal i had the revelation it was revealed to me he said you all know that i know what that seventh seal means but he said i've got to stop at the moment i can't go any further why did he have to because it's denoting to you that this is the mystery it can't be known to the public all right he said but it's revealed it's it is it's in a three-fold mystery amen amen brother abraham said that seventh seal he said it's unveiled in a three-fold mystery god it's in fact brother sister the seventh seal been right back there in genesis i just read about it right it's happened all the way through the bible god is gradually he's kept it hid it wasn't time to lift it off this wasn't time to lift it off his statuary it wasn't time to unveil this other masterpiece it wasn't even time then to unveil the original masterpiece but he did he spoke of it you see it was hid but now since the seals are open we can see it unveiled right there in genesis all right because brother brown said it goes all the way through it just passes right through the scriptures it came right up through the wheat plant too do you see what i'm trying to say part of that wheat plant dies part of it's burned part of it's saved at the white throne judgment but there's a part that goes in the bride original grain don't you see where we're at life is in the grain again it's seed time it's bride time it's rapture time the head and the body are coming together in unity one she's laying the presence of the sun and ripening ripening to what himself mrs adam was the mystery of mr adam that's all there is to it amen all right now now listen to what he said he said now why he said now none of us know but i'm going to tell you my revelation of it no nobody knows but i'm going to tell you my revelation john got it and the prophet had to get it in order to give it to us amen now watch what he continues to say now why let's prove it why is this secret why is the secret that no one knows about john was forbidden to write it even write a symbol about it why this is why there was no activity in heaven remember it was sealed in heaven no activity okay he said it might give away the secret but remember that activity was only for a time no activity i mean the silence was only for a time all right but it opened something brother brown said oh it's open people say no it's closed it's closed no brother brown said it's unopened the lamb opened it opened what the mystery of the seven thunders the revelation contained in there that john couldn't write all right now he said even write a symbol about it why no activity now it now do you see it now he said it might give away the secret it's so great it must be included it's got to happen what is it i love the way the prophet brings this what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it he said even i don't know anything about it it goes on to say he didn't know it himself that made you swallow pretty hard he didn't know it himself when he was here on earth god the son he didn't know it himself even jesus said there's things that i couldn't finish but i will finish later and i'll work in and through the bride to complete what i couldn't complete when i was in my earthly journey but i will now complete it in the bride amen i'll work in and through my bride all right he said he didn't know it himself god only would know it that's what he said god only knows it and he told us when you begin to see these signs coming up now you're getting somewhere all right notice we can see those signs coming up he said he said there's satan satan he said doesn't know anything about it it's the third pull he just doesn't know about it it's the third pull right now some of you really need to be eating the book some of you really don't know the clue what i'm talking about because you need to be feeding on the book and not your so-called pleasures amen i'm sorry i'm not trying to be judging anybody and i'm not but that's what the bible said every every well i won't go there i've said that so god said that so it would shake you to get to reading get the searching you're missing something and this devil's taking up your time and getting you so tore up and so upset over little pity any things to keep you away from this he hates the manifestation of the word but it so happens that's the bride's position is the manifested word because he's the word she is the word and today it's himself in the formation of the bride that's your message same one same power same jesus he said right here today same one same power same jesus in the bride form and he said it is the bride coming of christ god had a purpose now you say well see he didn't go he didn't even know about it he said it's the thing say she said the things god didn't know about and he brother brown said i saw that seventh seal open and it was the thing that jesus did said he didn't know about and then he said i saw it go to those seven thunders and john was forbidden to write it so the two are the same what he didn't know about was what was hidden amen but i've got news for you he began he did know about it because when he sent it down and put that sword in the hand of his prophet he knew about it amen listen this just let me get that right here on the message revelation the revelation of jesus christ 1960 1204 he said but after his death he said jesus said it's not for you to know the hour or the time no one would know even the son as yet did not know as yet did not know he said but after his death burial and resurrection and ascension into glory he received from god the future of the church and he said then he returned back to bring this message to the church this message and this message and this message of his coming and and he said he would give the condition of the churches down through the age he could not do it before his death burial and resurrection because he had not known it yet himself amen but did you notice how the scripture reads there the revelation revelation 1 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him where did god give it to john no he gave it to jesus christ what did he give to him a complete full revelation of deity and without his bride he is not complete adam without eve was not complete it had to be he had him in himself but he wasn't completed yet god had a further and he and we call it and we believe it is this it's the capping off or the crowning act in genesis that was the crowning act of god's work was when he brought the woman out of the man and today it's the crowning act of the creation of his word of jesus christ a spoken word creation because that's what literally the bride is as a spoken word seed of god that's what he said the bride is all right oh my amen i all right threefold purpose brother branham i was reading about that let me get it back here i've got to get to that before we close so you just bear with me now this god's great mystery god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning he's preaching a message christ the mystery of god revealed and he's saying right back from what he just said he said but i want to speak on it this morning what was he wanting to speak on the seventh seal i want to speak on it this morning and it's god's purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak to the church the morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living amen and he says then you will understand clearly you see what i believe what is being done god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand what did he say the mystery of how and he didn't reveal it and the reason under our seventh seal when the seventh seal was open there was silence jesus said when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen god has all of this to himself so what is this he's going to unfold a three-fold because this revelation is unfolded in a three-fold manner or myst or purpose and he gradually began to unfold that threefold purpose all the way through the scriptures and when you see it is so simple you wonder how you missed it because it took a bride to uncover it i mean excuse me a messenger by the holy spirit to unc took god to uncover that and let you see it god's work all the way through and he had for one purpose he was doing that to take to him a bride to himself he would bring her to himself and he will carry you on eagle's wings and bring you to himself amen all right then that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour it's a secret even this and it's still a secret because brother branham said it cannot be known to the public and we all know the public can't know this the only way the public can know it is after the bride leaves because he who letteth will let until he the bride christ the bride is taken out then he unveils himself to the world the bride's done gone this that we're talking about is an unveiled mystery a finished mystery of god that he said i'll withhold it but i'll let it know and i'll bring my bride to her position and her place and she'll recognize what she is who she is how that she was in me at the beginning how i that's why the seals were open i got the quote right here he said you want to know if you want to know why how she would be he said those seven seals being open paragraph 12 rising of the sun he said those seals were opened by god's gods himself revealed these mysteries not by man but god himself that opened those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last day you say brother david why are you so why are you preaching such a deep because i've got to get you to reach for something the ministry should be getting the people to try to press to reach for something more i'm what am i doing then if i'm doing anything else i am planting seed amen it's not in vain the message we got to preach the message well i just don't need that then well maybe you don't need to go home then to a rapture because this will be the thing that's going to literally change your body amen i mean that with all my heart and i'd say you better get desperate when you realize that it was once embodied in the body of jesus christ and now what was embodied in him is now embodied in the bride the prophet said it ought to bring a desperation to you you say well the people don't have any desperation they just like the days ago they're coming under a lady seeing spirit we just go to church no there's a bride that's in a revival and is red-hot she'll have nothing to do with that compromising laodicean spirit young or old the word is before you go eat the book pray for god praise and god reveal this to me to me whether you do to mom and dad whether you do to son or daughter reveal it to me it's me that's standing before you i've got to have you there was something in that book that would set this little bride in a rapture and a meeting in the air and it's got to be here and we are being gathered together by the coming of the lord brother brown said that seventh seal was that mystery of his coming amen all right now see so you see it says how she was in christ already in god how was she in god in the thinking of himself in eternity already revealed we didn't know that brother branham took the message and opened up what god had in his mind and where you were there then he said and i'll reveal it to how they were in the sun then i'll make it known how they're to be here in the end time three-fold manner all right so purpose the purpose of god now save time he showed it and revealed it in every type of the bible the entire bible is expression of one goal had had god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in bible have been expressing what god's great goal is and how it's revealed in the last day he shows it and how god's help will see it right here this morning why don't you run into that message and find out what he said amen it's laying there why are you letting the devil talk you out of doing it i'll tell you why because it'll produce a rapture amen it's your life you know once you get that life you don't want to see that manifested he wants you to miss the rapture he don't want you to have that meeting you know what you think you're married to the bride the married to the bridegroom and the marriages come he don't want you to see your name written that book when that mystery is revealed to you personally and you see your name written there he don't want you to see that because why he's lost the battle it's done finish for him amen now you say i'm still fighting sure you are but you're a victor you know you are you are his victory oh brother i have to put up with so many things you you let it you you put up with it god's saying to say what's your decision why are you putting up with it you claim the hell of the holy ghost where's your discernment the light's going to dispel the darkness he's going to discern what that spirit is working among you that's so subtle and so reasonable sounding it's contrary to the word see you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind brother branham called it the back part of his mind what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it and now god has had a threefold purpose in this great mystery secret god is a great mystery secret he had it before the world began he's got a threefold purpose in it and that's what we want to go upon this morning is what is that threefold purpose now i believe by god's help who is present he'll show it to us now what his threefold purpose we want to find out what is that threefold purpose and he said i haven't had i haven't been able to express it or explain it like like i'm going to this morning he said amen there you for you can see what this great meaning of what has been what it has been to know this therefore you can see the great meaning of what has been to know this and then try to bring it to the people and i and i haven't went into details to try to explain it as god has revealed it to me oh my brother sister we'll see it right here this morning the mystery of his coming and what he's done and what has it been it's been his coming it's been god expressing himself through the whole wheat plant right down here to the very end where he can pull out what that eternal life record is of his own self the life has come up through it and at the end it comes back to the seed again all right you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus in bride form same church same thing same word sucked up through these up through these what these carriers come up through the plant come up here and it come to a head here and all that life that come up there picked up its people and now it's forming up into a head for the rapture what's forming up into the head his people united with him coming one with him amen now first coming second coming third coming i may believe he comes in three comings he comes three times our lord comes three times first coming paul spoke about it we're being united we're being gathered together by the first come by his coming okay first stage of the threefold purpose second stage we'll come to it listen carefully and like i said we'll get into this as much we can i still got a little bit of time amen you may not think i do but you just let go of your thinking a minute this is more important than your food this is rapture you say you believe that don't you i absolutely believe it not because i'm saying it because it's the message of this book somebody somebody is identified there i pray we all are every one of us i may not know that but i know i can know it myself all right third coming you know what he does first coming second coming third coming now let's touch on this a minute the purpose god had a purpose he began to unfold it restoring back to what his whole purpose is to take us back home to eden walk out with us in a millennium that's his third coming did you know that okay we come back to earth in a millennium walk upon the ashes of the wicked amen all right all right now we're into the age of the eagle the revelation to be revealed the whole thing if we are to reveal have the revelation of the whole thing then the seventh seal is open okay now compare this with revelation 10 chapter verse 1 to 7 we'll see here in revelation 10 1-7 that in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel and another translation said the seventh eagle message was to finish up all the mysteries of god amen what is it heading up in if all the mysteries are revealed contained in those seven seals okay now i've already read paragraph 12 of the reason he's opened those seals now notice it's all about you it's all about himself in bride form it's all about himself in the formation of the bride if you want to read the formation of the bride i quote it to you wednesday go back there to things that are to be he says it in there okay now notice notice paragraph 140 christ the mystery notice god has had a threefold purpose in this great mystery secret god in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he has got a threefold purpose in it now we now what we want to go upon this morning is what that threefold purpose is because this seventh seal is contained in that threefold purpose amen it's right there threefold mystery okay the first thing first thing he said of this purpose was that god wanted to reveal himself to the people that was his what that he said that was his and one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in christ what was the title of this message christ is what the mystery of god revealed amen so he wanted to express himself as a human being to reveal himself in christ other words to express manifest the mystery of himself in a man all right all right he's talking about the second adam now watch what he says here secondly secondly because he's wanting to express himself in christ so all that god was all a double l all that god was he did what poured himself into christ jesus christ all and became the full godhead bodily the fullness of himself in one man our savior our redeemer redeemer deity himself in flesh god come down to identify himself with man as a as a gowell as a kinsmen redeemer all right now secondly that was his first plan that was i mean of his threefold purpose secondly to have the preeminence to for that purpose he did that to and see to have the preeminence to have the preeminence in his body of believers that's his second fold the purpose of his first time coming the first coming was to have the and and to do this to do what so he could have preeminence in the body of his believers that is his bride that he might live in people another place he said he did that for the purpose of sanctifying his bride that he could come and live in her okay so now secondly you have the second full purpose the second fold was to come in the body of believers that redemption the paying of the price the pouring out of the holy spirit would come back into the body of the believers they would be could receive a new birth amen by the baptism of his own life in them meeting that seed in their soul right now that he might live in people again paragraph 145 of the same book christ the mystery now now he could do that in adam and eve oh now you see why we read the genesis he did that very thing see he showed it right there in adam and eve where was eve in adam where did god pour himself into adam let us make man in our image where was the woman in the man that right what was the second fold when the woman was brought out of the man amen it was adam in the feminine form of his wife she was his mystery revealed what he came for god pulled it out of him he died for that purpose that he brother braham said what was the crucifixion of christ for it was for a purpose that he might take one to be his bride amen a masterpiece other words the peace smitten off of him he took and created his wife amen made his wife created she's a spoken word creation took the peace off of the second atom made and formed the bride out of that piece and she said she's the very piece of himself and we come back together by the revelation of this message they come back together you don't see super separate people you see the same self person they're one united together they're one no longer twain the marriage has come what brought what is the marriage the son of man revealing himself through a son of man to unite the two together amen amen he brought her to himself all right then he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again you see god in order to express himself in his attributes he knew that would happen but is he going to lose it no he's going to restore it right back again in total perfection amen by what the masterpiece christ our son christ jesus our bridegroom christ jesus the one christ jesus the only one christ jesus who we are in and now here manifesting himself what are we doing revealing the son of man again bride can't do anything else but be the genuine manifestation of her husband amen amen and now when i see god's great purpose think think of what god's purpose when i even think of it it's rich to me see we'll see what god's purpose was when i see god's purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in christ number one to the fullness of the godhead bodily number one and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people what is the bride what would be that last one it would be his fullness again himself again in a many member body one seed bringing forth many seeds but it's the same seed bringing forth himself again right here before the people it's himself don't you see we're being gathered by that coming being gathered together by this message right here there's no ism schisms among the bride there's no denominational spirits we don't put up with that nonsense we don't put up with that thing we don't put up with it in this church when it wants to raise its head up and spread among the people like a cancer we do it we just call it out that's all there is to it by the word it's wrong see and the holy spirit discerns it it's off the word why would it be wrong it's off the word it's not god's provided way you see what satan did to eve all he did was said one word surely he won't you won't die god didn't mean what he said here let me explain to you what he meant here let me prophesy to you he's still trying to prophesy through a dominating female spirit today but he won't let that thing dominate it will not have nomination over me nor will it have it over the bride and when god unveils it you ought to take up notice and you ought to repent and get right and get that spirit off of you that's right we won't put up with it see all right i say we we as he because you lack the revelation of the word you're not discerning what it is okay now so see the second fold is to bring the fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminences the oversight and the leading he you become a prisoner a love slave to him alone notice again now what's his threefold purpose manifests himself in jesus christ number one to come into his body by jesus christ to have the preeminence number two and then what to restore back eden back again that which was lost brother brahm said we're going right back to a restored original eden he didn't lose a thing he poured his blood on it washed it with water poured his blood on it sanctified it and will receive a baptism to clean it off is that right amen my oh my oh my to think where we're at in the hour we're in and your position in that hour notice like the seven mysteries of the seven last seals the mysteries of them the seals had done been broke and every age had come down and there they had a left a lot of scattering and god not willing that it should be scattered he come back and picks up those things those doctrines they started and brought it on out and it revealed the whole thing same thing he's doing right now in revealing the mystery of christ how he was god's threefold purpose for the church oh my letting him out reveal who's he letting out him you all right when we see all of these he said notice god had the threefold purpose in this great mystery in his great mystery secret and when we see all these great threefold revelation god in christ christ in the church the kingdom coming adam and eve redeemed back to the garden of eden in the representation of christ and his bride then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise praise be to god now by the revelation of the threefold mystery the secret it's a seal he said by the revelation of this threefold mystery the secret he said and by the personal vindicated word of his original headship it's revealed to the people amen what he said it's revealed he said he said the headship and the body has become one unit amen if i'm united with that headship and become that make up that headship of himself the full revelation of himself what am i i'm him couldn't be anything else sister sue that's exactly right you're him that's it amen finish mystery the mystery of god's finished who is it you where's the message of the book you he brought you forth how'd he do it by his way of doing it his purpose of doing it he kept it hid all the way through the bible until this hour then he just opens it up and we see it satan you don't have a foot to stand on in fact you don't even have feet your legs have been cut off your head's been cut off it's true you're unveiled the secret is out you're a deceiver you're a reasoner we don't want your knowledge brother adam called it wisdom versus faith we don't want your wisdom we don't care about your psychological wisdom we want the revelation of the word let me have that that'll defeat every devil every devil that tries to raise up in your senses of your spirit that'll defeat it right there let me bring everything under obedience to christ and quit trying to use a carnal warfare to deal with it our warfare is not carnal to the pulling down with strongholds well i'll help that person by psychology to pull down that stronghold that they've been under so many years you're doing it the wrong way it's not the word of god amen amen you can't do it books have been written all about it they can't do it it's only a temporary band-aid amen god said it's by his word he delivers that and you bring it under obedience through the word not under obedience through this carnal thing it's under obedience to the word amen now threefold purpose of god manifested in adam and eve three full purpose of god manifested in the second adam threefold purpose of god and every prophet undoubted through the ages and he that is to come he that was which is and is to come the whole manifestation the revelation of the word of god adam and eve going back home again redeemed god making himself known that's the seventh seal seventh is god threefold purpose amen the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like a bullock and they shall feed together and lay down he talk about the millennium now they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain right back exactly to eden again as hard as it can go can you see the first coming the second coming and his third coming right there unveiled right in this purpose what was the second coming you are manifesting that coming that's what it's all about for the meeting in the air my brother sister what an hour we live what a message to bring to the people no wonder the devil's so against it he hates it because it exposes unbelief it exposes make belief it exposes anything contrary to the word anything outside of it and the bride in her alone is this revealed you say well that doesn't pertain to me then why are you announcing who you are then it does pertain to you if you've got that pull inside of you i've got to have this or perish just like jacob i'll either have the birthright or perish is that right what went with that birthright everything that birthright stood for what goes with the name of jesus christ everything it stands for amen what goes with the revelation of christ in you everything christ is you are amen all right now i'm closing i have to close yeah well i got three minutes all right there is the threefold purpose oh he said he said though he said right back to eden again as hard as it can go he said there is his threefold purpose oh god help us to know it help us to know it don't you love that congregation his threefold purpose of his great mystery of revelations has been revealed he is the main one that's the one now the people that took this revelation from god became the living epistles known and read of all men for their generation god's raised up others and so it's gone on through the years until then the last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age oh brother sister what are we looking at the bride she's pregnated with his spirit bearing children impregnated with his spirit bearing his name bearing his name bearing his life bearing forth the signs of life edit with evidence with the preeminences evidence of his resurrection showing that he's not dead but alive forevermore this is eternal life how do you know this because you're a church member no christ is living through you so pregnanted with his spirit you're a prisoner to anything else you're confined oh my by the gospel confined to the word and you become a prisoner because that seed was there the seed was already there when was it put there before the foundation of the world and that life-giving water comes upon it what's it going to do quicken the life amen now i'm skipping she's got to be cried the bride is the be the word she is to be the word then she's got to be of christ part of the bridegroom she's got to be the word and she's not the word for his day but she's the word for this day amen that he promised would be in this day that he sent his word forth to mold his bride and make her we're in the head now that's the promised word for this day we're in the head now this is christ this is the head time christ the headstone comes to the body amen amen and it is a secret going of the church amen praise the lord i'm just moving through this real quickly now revelations 4 1. if you'll turn i'll probably try to close here on these right here thank you for being so patient you know i got to get this out because i don't know when i'll preach again revel well i know when i'll preach again sorry lord willing wednesday but i won't bring i don't think we'll i'll bring something else out of there revelations 4 verse 1 after these after this after what after what this the age carried itself out laodicea after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven praise be to god a door was opened and the first voice which i heard as there were a trumpet talking with me said come up higher and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was said in heaven and one sat on the throne what are we beholding have we been caught up have we come through the door he's called for his sheep to come through the door my sheep hear my voice the stranger they'll not follow and he is the door and the door was set open you say brother david brother branham said this this ministry right here was found right here in revelations chapter 4 amen and here we are and here's what happened brother branham on the fourth seal said out of the millions in the world in the days of elijah when jezebel and ahab were reigning in the type of the antitype today out of the whole world there was only 700 now we know he said 700 the bible said 7 thousand saved of elijah's preaching elijah never knew one of them was that way he didn't know they were that way he thought he was the only one saved until god opened one of the seals one of the seals and showed him the mystery of the book amen what are we speaking of this morning the mystery of the book showed him the mystery of the book that he had 700 that or 7 707 that doesn't matter that never bowed them down to them creeds they had when god opened his book to elijah he said now wait a minute son i've got 700 that's tucked around out there got their names on the book since the foundation of the world they're mine did you catch that okay god opened the seals that's the reason i think john was doing all that shouting the other night he must have seen his name on there you see that was revelation chapter five when he had taken the book he said talk about a happy time when them seals broke talk about a happy time when them seals broke today talk about a happy time we're having i can't get enough of it talk about a happy time there when they're sealed broke john must have looked in and seen a past the curtain of time and said there's john i wonder if you look to pass the curtain of time and see the mystery of yourself revealed or if you can say there's you fill it in but there's the real you on the inside the spirit of god there he is there's the open word that's what he sent it for that's why he said the ministry of the seventh angels the third poll that's why he said the ministry of the of revelation 10 is the third pull because it opened in us it's the opening of the word personally he opened up the book and you've looked past the curtain of time amen praise be to god amen amen we're doing real good now i'm closing i didn't even hear an amen that's good i'll continue on okay no i'm closing of course we know the mystery is only revealed to her the bride book notice now then you are a son of god in the house of god you are part of god's economy then there is no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus no judgment now we do stand before a throne i will tell you but it's not the white throne we stand before a throne to give an account of our life here to him for reward not for judgment it's a judgment for rewards i don't have time to go into that explain it but it's all through the bible paul said we must all stand before the throne of god and he's talking about the reward you're not losing your
