[9:10] Um,

[9:14] different tempo,
[9:16] but we'll just go to that number 543,
[9:19] please.
[9:21] [Music]
[9:26] I'm pressing on
[9:30] the upward way.
[9:33] New heights I'm gaining
[9:37] every day.
[9:40] Still praying.
[9:44] I'm onward bound.
[9:47] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[9:51] ground.
[9:54] Lord, lift me up
[9:57] and let me stand
[10:01] by faith on heaven
[10:04] and save a land
[10:08] a higher place
[10:12] than I have found.
[10:15] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[10:19] ground.
[10:22] My heart has no
[10:25] desire to stay.
[10:29] where doubts arise
[10:32] and fears dismay.
[10:36] Though some may dwell
[10:40] where these abound,
[10:43] my prayer, my aim is higher
[10:47] ground.
[10:49] Lord, lift me up
[10:53] and let me stand
[10:57] by faith on heaven
[11:01] stable land
[11:04] a higher plain
[11:08] than I have found.
[11:11] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[11:15] ground.
[11:17] I want to live
[11:21] above the world.
[11:25] No Satan's stars
[11:28] at me are heard.
[11:32] For faith has caught
[11:35] a joyful sound.
[11:39] The song of saints on higher
[11:43] ground.
[11:45] Lord, lift me up
[11:49] and let me stand
[11:52] by faith on heaven's
[11:56] table land
[12:00] a higher place
[12:03] than I have found.
[12:07] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[12:10] ground.
[12:13] I want to scale
[12:16] the utmost high
[12:20] and catch a gleam
[12:24] of glory bright.
[12:27] But still I'll pray
[12:31] till heaven I found.
[12:34] Lord lead me onto higher
[12:38] ground.
[12:41] Lord, lift me up
[12:44] and let me stand
[12:48] my faith on hand
[12:51] and save a land
[12:55] a higher place
[12:58] than I have found.
[13:02] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[13:08] Oh Lord, lift me up
[13:12] and let me stand
[13:15] by faith on heaven
[13:19] and save a land
[13:23] a higher plane
[13:26] than I have found.
[13:30] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[13:34] ground.

[35:27] promise that whether two or three of us.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; And there's another place where it said
[35:32] if any two agree and ask for something,
[35:35] &gt;&gt; you can have what you ask for. And we
[35:37] know the message of the hour says that's
[35:39] you and God.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; So if you and God can agree on
[35:43] something, you can have whatever you ask
[35:46] for. God bless you, sister. And so,
[35:49] we're just happy to be here this
[35:50] evening. I thank brother Paul and we uh
[35:53] tweaked something as we were going down
[35:55] the stairs this morning taking care of

[36:03] Deborah was telling him, "Yeah, he's
[36:04] having a little hard time walking. So,
[36:06] if I went, it's only just because
[36:08] there's a a kink there." But uh
[36:13] as uh then she goes, "Oh, it's going to
[36:16] be a really good service."
[36:19] She's been around the block and she
[36:21] knows. So, praise the Lord. Could we do

[39:13] love
[39:16] you. Just softly on the chorus,
[39:20] singing, I
[39:24] love
[39:26] you, Lord.
[39:30] singing
[39:32] beautiful
[39:34] love
[39:36] you
[39:41] singing
[39:43] I
[39:45] love
[39:48] you
[39:51] Lord
[39:54] I
[39:56] love
[39:59] You
[40:01] gracious heavenly father,
[40:05] we know that singing and songs has are
[40:08] like prophecy. In fact, if we looked in
[40:10] the book of Psalms, we find place after
[40:13] place where they are prophesying words
[40:16] unto thee,
[40:18] Father. And so, as we sing this tonight,
[40:20] you have heard the hearts of your
[40:23] people.
[40:25] And we realize that when we project love
[40:28] to you, you project love back to us.
[40:33] And we realize also from the scripture,
[40:35] it says, "For God so loved the world
[40:38] that you gave your only begotten son
[40:41] that whosoever believeth in him should
[40:44] have everlasting life, not perish.
[40:47] Father, so we thank you tonight. I give
[40:50] you myself,
[40:52] Lord Jesus. take control of this man.
[40:55] Take control of my heart. Take control
[40:57] of every heart here in the name of Jesus
[41:00] Christ that you might be magnified and
[41:03] glorified above all things tonight. And
[41:05] and if it should be that that service
[41:07] would last to where we'd leave this
[41:09] place, may we leave with our hearts full
[41:12] of your love and grace in the name of
[41:14] Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen.
[41:18] Praise the Lord.
[41:20] We uh
[41:23] I don't like to leave you standing, but
[41:24] let's let's turn first to uh and I know
[41:28] this is really familiar. We mentioned it
[41:30] many times. John the 11th chapter.
[41:35] We uh uh we hear different things and
[41:38] how people uh talk about rapture and
[41:43] we're going to and this isn't to put
[41:45] anybody's
[41:46] down particularly,
[41:49] but they'll say, "Well, I've had young
[41:51] people come before it like youth camps
[41:53] and oh, how you know, how can how can I
[41:55] make the rapture?"
[41:57] And let's just clear up a few things
[42:00] tonight, Lord willing. uh because I
[42:03] think you'll find it a little different
[42:05] than what the normal
[42:08] way of looking at things is. And this is
[42:10] where Jesus Lazarus has died. We know
[42:13] Lazarus was uh Jesus and we went through
[42:17] a few services back about what it
[42:20] actually means. And one of the meanings
[42:22] there is the glory of Israel. And so he
[42:25] is going Jesus is going down to raise
[42:28] Lazarus or raise the glory of Israel
[42:33] from the dead because the glory in
[42:36] Israel was dead. That's why Jesus was
[42:39] there. So he's going there to raise up
[42:41] the glory of Israel. That's one of the
[42:44] definitions anyway. And we'll start
[42:46] there and it's with about uh
[42:50] we'll start with verse 20. So chapter 11
[42:52] verse 20. Then Martha, as soon as she
[42:55] heard Jesus was coming, went and met
[42:57] him. But Mary sat still in the house.
[42:59] Then said Martha unto Jesus,"Lord, if
[43:01] you had been here, my brother had not
[43:03] died. But I know that even now
[43:05] whatsoever thou wil ask of God, God will
[43:08] give it to thee." Jesus saith unto her,
[43:10] "Thy brother shall rise again." I want
[43:13] you to pay attention to the sequence as
[43:16] we go into this. So he speaks or
[43:18] prophesies, "Your brother will rise
[43:21] again." Martha saith unto him, I know
[43:23] that he shall rise again in the
[43:25] resurrection at the last day. Jesus said
[43:28] unto her, I am the resurrection and the
[43:32] life. He that believeth in me, though he
[43:35] were dead, yet shall he live.
[43:38] And whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[43:41] shall never die, believest thou this.
[43:45] So now let's just turn over uh little
[43:48] different approach to this this evening
[43:50] to John the 14th chapter
[43:54] and uh
[43:57] we'll start there at
[44:01] the
[44:04] 17th verse. So John 14:17
[44:08] he said even the spirit of truth whom
[44:10] the world cannot receive because it sees
[44:13] him not neither knoweth him but ye know
[44:17] him for he dwelleth with you and shall
[44:20] be in you.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Okay I will not leave you comfortless. I
[44:26] will I will come to you. Okay, I will
[44:29] come to you let yet a little while and
[44:32] the world seeth me no more but ye see me
[44:35] because I live you shall live also. At
[44:39] that day shall ye know that I am in the
[44:42] father. I am in my father and ye in me
[44:48] and I in you.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we've read your word
[44:53] tonight. May you bless it in the name of
[44:55] Jesus Christ. God, just open our eyes by
[44:58] revelation of Jesus Christ as our
[45:00] brother spoke about Sunday. We thank you
[45:02] now and make it personal to each heart
[45:04] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And for
[45:08] those who might be out there on the
[45:09] internet tonight or or listening in, God
[45:12] bless you. We appreciate you being with
[45:14] us in spirit. And so, please be seated.
[45:18] So, we look at this and you know, in
[45:22] modern English language, we call it
[45:24] rapture. And so we think about well what
[45:26] is this rapture?
[45:29] And we most often we think about it if
[45:32] we were to go back to Corinthians it
[45:33] talks about we shall not all die we
[45:35] shall be changed.
[45:38] So we realize in another place it says
[45:41] we shall be changed in a moment and a
[45:43] twinkling of an eye. And I suppose I've
[45:45] probably told this before but one time I
[45:48] got really into this. I was praying and
[45:49] praying about what is a moment? Well, we
[45:52] know it's a time space
[45:54] and I I got, you know, well, it's a and
[45:57] so when you get serious about it, it's
[45:59] an unidentified
[46:03] identified space of time.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; So, it's a specific identified space of
[46:09] time that's unidentified.
[46:11] So, I'm going, okay, all right. So, I
[46:14] was praying about this for actually many
[46:16] days. And so, you know, I'm just going,
[46:18] Lord, what's this all about? out and I
[46:20] remember I I believe it was I went to
[46:22] the the drive-thru somewhere and the the
[46:26] little lady comes on the phone and said
[46:28] uh you know I'll be with you in a
[46:30] moment. I'm going here it is I'm going
[46:34] to learn what a moment is and about 2 3
[46:37] minutes later you know here's your
[46:38] burger or whatever is we were getting
[46:40] and you know okay so that's what a
[46:43] moment is so 2 3 minutes it's all going
[46:45] to be over right well so then I go down
[46:47] to the doctor's office a little bit
[46:50] later and as I walk in the door she
[46:52] hands me the little thing and says here
[46:54] we'll be with you in a moment there's
[46:56] that word again so about 15 20 minutes
[46:59] by the time you get everything filled
[47:01] out. I'm going, "Okay, so a moment might
[47:03] be 3 minutes, might be 20 minutes
[47:06] because it's an unidentified identified
[47:08] space of time. So, this is really good."
[47:10] Well, that afternoon I had to go down
[47:11] and get my license plates renewed.
[47:15] Now, Idaho is good compared to some
[47:17] states.
[47:19] And they said, "Take a number and we'll
[47:21] be with you in a moment." About an hour
[47:24] and a half later,
[47:27] I was going up to get my drop live my
[47:30] license plates. So, uh, you have this.
[47:35] All we know is it's a time frame. We
[47:38] don't know how long exactly because it
[47:41] might be 3 minutes, might be 20, might
[47:43] be might be two or three days depending
[47:46] on the situation that brings it forth.
[47:49] But we know that during that moment
[47:52] somehow there's going to become a body
[47:55] change in these these mortal bodies are
[47:58] going to be changed from one body into
[48:01] another body. And that body is as Paul
[48:05] was talking to Isaac and Isaac and we
[48:08] had the same conversation about I can't
[48:10] even remember the name of the what it
[48:12] was we were some kind of new science
[48:15] that they're starting to figure out.
[48:17] if you speed things up fast enough
[48:19] because there's certain things they
[48:20] figured out move faster than the speed
[48:22] of light. And that's like the little
[48:24] electrons that go around the
[48:27] that those actually goes and and they
[48:29] say that the nerve synapse in your body
[48:33] is actually travels faster than the
[48:35] speed of light. And I remember when I
[48:37] had, you know, here I'm limping a little
[48:39] bit today. I remembering what it felt
[48:41] like 18 years ago when they told me I'd
[48:43] never walk again. and they had a tube
[48:45] right they'd stuck in there along my
[48:48] spinal cord and when they pulled that
[48:49] tube out I'd never felt they said this
[48:52] is going to feel strange
[48:54] and and they were draining the fluid off
[48:56] my spinal cord when they took out part
[48:58] of my backbone and when they yanked that
[49:00] tube out I could feel it instantly
[49:04] in every
[49:06] like cell of my body and it felt really
[49:10] strange I will agree but it was there
[49:14] almost like before it happened it was so
[49:17] fast. So and if they if we are changed
[49:22] to where we become like that kind of
[49:25] construction we can begin to move and
[49:27] they said if you can ever move that fast
[49:30] you can go through walls
[49:33] you could get hit by a car and never
[49:35] even know the car hit you because you're
[49:37] and they've have documented cases of
[49:39] this thing these things kind of things
[49:40] happen. In fact, they had pictures of
[49:42] somebody that was in the street and a
[49:45] truck hit them, but they were still
[49:46] standing there after the truck went by.
[49:50] You go, "How does this happen?" Well,
[49:53] the person was a Christian and they were
[49:55] praying and they didn't see the truck
[49:56] and was too late, but they were still
[49:59] standing there after the truck went by.
[50:01] And there's other cases, documented
[50:03] cases through history. So if we're
[50:06] looking at this and we think about
[50:07] rapture and we think about Jesus after
[50:10] the resurrection
[50:13] and how that he could move from one
[50:17] place to the other place instantly.
[50:21] So we're looking for some kind of a body
[50:24] change to where we can move instantly.
[50:28] And in one place, you know, we've heard
[50:29] it said that you can travel like a
[50:31] thought. Well, how fast does a thought
[50:34] travel?
[50:35] Well, if the nerve syninnapse is faster
[50:38] than the speed of light, how fast is the
[50:40] thought
[50:42] &gt;&gt; behind it? We're just we're going to
[50:44] look at scriptural things about the
[50:47] rapture tonight or what we call rapture.
[50:50] It's actually body change or also called
[50:53] translation.
[50:55] And as we begin to think about these
[50:57] things now, we saw there where Jesus
[50:59] here he is. He's coming down to raise up
[51:01] Lazarus.
[51:03] And Lazarus, you know, the glory of
[51:05] Israel, the strength of Israel, the oak
[51:07] tree experience, all those things that
[51:09] Lazarus, the name Lazarus means. And
[51:12] each one has a specific thing that goes
[51:14] along with it and how that when he goes
[51:17] there and the first thing that Martha
[51:20] says, if you had been here, my brother
[51:22] had not have died. So, she's got faith
[51:25] that there's something about Jesus
[51:27] that's different because she calls him
[51:30] master. And I believe that's like rabbi
[51:32] or raoni. I didn't happen to look it up
[51:35] there, but it's she's calling him, you
[51:37] are the master. You are, you know, God
[51:41] in a man or what they call the Messiah.
[51:44] And so when she gives him that
[51:45] recognition
[51:47] and she said, "If you'd have been here,
[51:49] my my brother would not have died." And
[51:51] the first thing he does is he prophesies
[51:54] to her.
[51:56] He says, "Your brother will rise again."
[52:00] Now, she was well trained. She believed
[52:03] in a resurrection. She'd been around the
[52:05] Pharisees. They're the ones that
[52:06] believed it. The Sadducees didn't. But
[52:09] so she and she said, "Yay, Lord, I know
[52:13] that my brother will raise at the last
[52:15] days." in the general res in in the
[52:16] resurrection of the and he goes the word
[52:20] always corrects the error
[52:24] she gave true doctrine
[52:29] there will be or there is I don't know
[52:32] how to explain it a general resurrection
[52:35] for those that go on
[52:38] and that aren't as we would say
[52:41] believers or Christians. So she told the
[52:44] truth that was the common doctrine of
[52:47] the day and it was absolutely true
[52:50] doctrine. But the word because Jesus is
[52:54] the word in the beginning was the word.
[52:56] The word was with God. The word was God
[52:58] is God. Always will be God. So Jesus
[53:02] Christ the word became flesh. So this is
[53:04] the word in flesh. and the word the word
[53:09] now there's a difference when you say
[53:11] you know in English word because there's
[53:13] what we call remma what is in this book
[53:16] is called the remma
[53:18] &gt;&gt; which mean it's the written it's the
[53:19] letters but the logos
[53:23] is the thought behind the sequence of
[53:28] words
[53:30] &gt;&gt; that's the logos
[53:32] so she gave the absolute truth truth in
[53:37] what she said. But the word or the
[53:40] logos, the general sequence of the I am
[53:46] God,
[53:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Corrected the error.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; He corrected the error because he said
[53:54] he said, "I am." Who's the I am?
[53:58] &gt;&gt; We we all know who the I am is. When
[54:00] Moses was in the wilderness, he said,
[54:02] "Who should I say sent me?" When God has
[54:04] sending him down to Egypt, he said,
[54:05] "Tell him I am sent you." Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Then when Jesus, we just read it there.
[54:12] He said, "I am." And she said, "He he'll
[54:15] rise again, but he said, I am the
[54:18] resurrection."
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Who is the resurrection? Is it a thing
[54:23] that we're waiting for?
[54:26] There will be a manifestation.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; But how do we get into or translate it
[54:32] into that revelation?
[54:35] I am
[54:38] &gt;&gt; because it's not
[54:41] a thing that we're trying to jump into
[54:44] like like like you're going to go
[54:45] swimming or something. No, the swimming
[54:48] pool is inside of us
[54:51] because he said, "I am." Who's speaking?
[54:54] Jesus Christ. The I am God.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Of the Old Testament,
[55:01] Jehovah of the Old has become Jesus of
[55:04] the New. And the I am God that was there
[55:08] is now manifesting himself in a fleshly
[55:12] body through as we know Jesus Christ or
[55:14] what we call the God man. He was half
[55:16] God, half man because he was living in a
[55:19] fleshly body. But that fleshly body was
[55:22] birthed by what? by the word of God.
[55:26] Behold, a virgin shall conceive. And as
[55:29] that word when spoken by Isaiah, as that
[55:33] word began to travel through history, it
[55:35] started laying out a sequence.
[55:38] We call it sequencing. And and they use
[55:40] it in computer language. One of these
[55:42] other brothers, I'm sure, could tell you
[55:44] more about it. And how that that
[55:46] sequence builds
[55:49] a and as it goes through history. And
[55:52] well, you want to see know what the
[55:53] sequence is? It's pretty easy. You go
[55:55] back, I think it's the first of Matthew,
[55:57] and so and so begat so and so, and so
[55:59] and so begat so and so, and so and so,
[56:02] and it goes all down through that
[56:04] genealogy that if you want to go to
[56:06] sleep, that's a pretty good way to do
[56:08] it. Sometimes
[56:10] it really works. You start reading some
[56:12] of those long genealogies. Boy, I'm
[56:14] going,
[56:16] come on, man. What's this mean?
[56:19] Well, it's actually the sequence of God
[56:23] bringing about the word that Isaiah
[56:26] spoke back there from the I am God
[56:31] &gt;&gt; because the angel of God had come to
[56:33] Isaiah and all those other prophets.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; And when he spoke, it was God speaking
[56:42] as we would think of the beginning in
[56:44] this in this sense of Jesus Christ.
[56:47] He's telling us how that beginning is
[56:50] going to come to pass. And then he lays
[56:52] out the sequence. This one begat. This
[56:54] one begat. This one begat until when it
[56:57] comes time to for Jesus to come on the
[56:59] scene. What did it say? Well, it comes
[57:03] down to an angel appears to Mary. And
[57:06] the angel said,
[57:08] you know, behold, thou art most favored
[57:10] among women. And as he he he goes begins
[57:14] to talk to her and he tells her, "You're
[57:16] going to have a son." And she and valid
[57:19] question. She goes, "How's this going to
[57:21] happen?"
[57:23] Uh, come on. The way kids get here is
[57:26] not what you're telling me. But he said,
[57:29] you know, and he begins to tell her. He
[57:31] says, "The Holy Ghost." Who's the Holy
[57:34] Ghost? The I am.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Just in a slightly different form. He
[57:39] said, "The Holy Ghost or the I am will
[57:41] overshadow you." So, who's the father of
[57:43] Jesus?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; The I am.
[57:47] And
[57:48] and you're it'll overshadow you and
[57:50] you'll bring forth this forth this son.
[57:52] Well, what was her answer that so
[57:54] pleased the Lord was, "Be it unto me
[57:56] according to what?" Your word.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Well, what word? This word
[58:03] or the thought behind the word? The
[58:08] thought behind the word was this
[58:10] sequence is about to go into a new
[58:13] phase.
[58:15] It's been sitting there all these years,
[58:18] you know, going through that lineup and
[58:20] then it gets to Mary and it says now the
[58:22] sequence is going to begin
[58:25] because Jesus had a beginning. That's
[58:27] why he's not, as some people say, the
[58:29] eternal son.
[58:32] Pentecostal dogma, it it's not God
[58:35] because Jesus had a beginning.
[58:38] And yet the God of no beginning, no
[58:40] ending, or what we call Melzdc in
[58:43] another place is the God that created
[58:46] that beginning.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; And we know he's the beginning because
[58:51] if we turn to Revelations, I forgot what
[58:54] it is. Revelations 1, he says, "I am."
[58:57] Who's the beginning? The I am.
[59:01] But then he comes back and says, "It's
[59:02] Jesus Christ." It's because the I am
[59:06] created himself
[59:08] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the heart of God.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Exposed.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; And I know we went through this, but
[59:20] I'll just drop it in for there's a few
[59:21] people weren't here before. When David
[59:24] gets the sword from the altar
[59:27] and it was wrapped
[59:30] and David is called in the book of Acts
[59:33] a man after God's own heart, he received
[59:36] the heart of God because he took that
[59:40] from the heart of the altar
[59:43] and he pulls it out and it's wrapped.
[59:46] Well, what's it was talking about? It
[59:48] was showing us Jesus Christ because the
[59:50] word is a sword in the book of Hebrews.
[59:53] And so the word as a sword was revealed
[59:56] how he had to unwrap the sword.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; The word or the logos of the I am is the
[1:00:06] sword of the word. And that sword of the
[1:00:09] word was wrapped. And then you advance
[1:00:12] that sequence again going through time.
[1:00:14] And what is it? Then he had the
[1:00:16] shepherds abiding in the fields keeping
[1:00:18] watch over their flock by night. And he
[1:00:20] says, "Lo, the angel of the Lord came
[1:00:22] upon them and the glory of the Lord
[1:00:23] showed upon them." And and they were
[1:00:26] sore afraid. The angel says, "Don't be
[1:00:27] afraid, for to you this night there is
[1:00:30] born a Savior who is Christ the Lord."
[1:00:34] And what was the sign? The same sign is
[1:00:37] the sword head that David took from the
[1:00:39] altar. You shall find the babe
[1:00:43] wrapped in swaddling cloth.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; The baby was wrapped, the sword of God,
[1:00:50] the very from the heart of the altar of
[1:00:53] God is the sword of God, which is the
[1:00:57] word of God. But it's not just this the
[1:00:59] little tinky letters in your book or
[1:01:02] your Bible or in your cell phone or
[1:01:03] wherever you look at them. It's the
[1:01:05] thought behind the word. It's the
[1:01:08] personal experiences. As our brother was
[1:01:09] talking about Sunday, it's the personal
[1:01:12] experience between you and God, between
[1:01:15] me and God. And that God, that personal
[1:01:19] I am God.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Is to live within us.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:01:27] Christ. You shall receive what? The Holy
[1:01:31] Ghost.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Who was the birth father of Jesus? Yeah.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Well, Mary, yeah, you can have the
[1:01:38] you're going to have the baby because
[1:01:40] you'll be overshadowed by the Holy
[1:01:42] Ghost,
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; which is the logos heart thought of God
[1:01:47] pouring himself into the womb of a
[1:01:50] woman.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; We know the woman types the bride.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; All through the Bible or we would call
[1:01:56] the church, the church of the living
[1:01:59] God.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And what does he do with the woman? He
[1:02:02] puts Christ in her.
[1:02:05] And that brings forth a baby.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; What are we afraid of people?
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Why are people afraid?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; If you have received Jesus Christ, you
[1:02:18] will produce Jesus Christ.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; You're not going to make pumpkins and
[1:02:23] watermelons or something else.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; It's going to be the God of this Bible.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; So, back to the subject. So Jesus said,
[1:02:34] "I am the resurrection."
[1:02:37] So what is the resurrection?
[1:02:40] It's the I am.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; It's the personal God.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; And if you receive him, where does he
[1:02:48] live?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Well, we read it in John 14.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; I am in my father, you in me, and I in
[1:02:57] you.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Huh? And I shall be in you. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; I'll not leave you comfortless. I will
[1:03:06] come to you.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; What I are we talking about? Jesus just
[1:03:11] told us the I am is our resurrection.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; That's why a Christian should have no
[1:03:19] fear. If they kill us, well,
[1:03:24] I am lives in here.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Lives right down there in a little
[1:03:28] place. And they even click medical
[1:03:30] science in the heart. They say there's a
[1:03:32] little tiny room in your heart. And this
[1:03:34] is, you know, this is my I can't say pet
[1:03:37] peeve particularly, but I look at it
[1:03:40] like this. They call even medical
[1:03:42] science calls it the house of the soul
[1:03:44] or the room of the soul inside your
[1:03:47] heart. Just a little tiny tiny room.
[1:03:50] Well, if the Holy Ghost is in that
[1:03:51] little tiny tiny room and he's our
[1:03:55] resurrection, every time your heart
[1:03:58] beats, bloop bloop, that blood has to
[1:04:01] pass right by what? The Holy Ghost.
[1:04:07] Now, who's the creator?
[1:04:11] Well, we know in Colossians, I believe
[1:04:13] it is. It says, "All things were created
[1:04:15] by him, for him. Without him, there was
[1:04:17] nothing made that was made." And and I
[1:04:19] believe it repeats that. I think it's in
[1:04:20] Revelations 4, chapter 5, right in
[1:04:23] there. And I think there's a third place
[1:04:25] it says it, but I I don't remember where
[1:04:27] it is. But if you go back to Genesis,
[1:04:29] says in the beginning, God created the
[1:04:32] heavens and the earth. In where? The
[1:04:35] beginning.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:37] And when that prophecy or that word from
[1:04:41] Isaiah came all through the sequence,
[1:04:44] Jesus Christ became the beginning. But
[1:04:48] it's the beginning of what? The
[1:04:50] manifestation of the I am God.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:04:57] I am I am in the father
[1:05:01] and you in me and me in you.
[1:05:04] So, and if we have that Holy Spirit
[1:05:07] experience in our hearts
[1:05:11] and every time that heart pumps,
[1:05:14] that blood has to pass by. What are
[1:05:17] they? What's it passing by? The creator
[1:05:20] of the entire universe.
[1:05:24] All things created by him, for him, and
[1:05:28] without him there wasn't anything made.
[1:05:32] And that's I'll drop this in maybe for
[1:05:34] somebody online out there. If you're
[1:05:36] worried about your sin, what we call
[1:05:39] sin, which is unbelief. It's not all the
[1:05:41] attributes of sin. I mean, those come
[1:05:43] because of unbelief. Unbelief in what?
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Unbelief in God's word, but not just the
[1:05:50] letters.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; But unbelief in the thoughts of God
[1:05:55] expressing Jesus Christ. And if you're
[1:05:58] worried about it, there's a place that
[1:06:00] says if we confess our sins, they go
[1:06:02] into the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Well, we know that other places in the
[1:06:08] scripture when it talks about God says
[1:06:10] he knows all things.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz well, he created everything. Of
[1:06:14] course, he knows everything
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; and he knows all things and he knows the
[1:06:19] beginning. He knows the ending. He knows
[1:06:20] all this. But you know, if we have a sin
[1:06:23] and it says if we confess it and he
[1:06:26] drops it into his forgetfulness.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Right. You know, we had a prophet's
[1:06:34] message that said, uh, it's like if you
[1:06:37] had a great big tub of, you know, like
[1:06:39] one of those 55gallon drums of bleach
[1:06:43] and you put all the sins, uh, uh, your
[1:06:45] whole life in a little eyropper,
[1:06:48] and you take it and you drop it in that
[1:06:50] bleach. He said, that bleach is so
[1:06:52] strong, it completely annihilates
[1:06:59] those cells and things that were in it.
[1:07:01] It annihilates it because chemically it
[1:07:03] absorbs it into the bleach.
[1:07:06] And he said in one place he says, "So
[1:07:08] it's like it never existed."
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Well, God knows all things.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; But if it never existed, God won't
[1:07:18] acknowledge it because it never existed.
[1:07:20] Because he created all things. And if
[1:07:23] it's not part of the creation, it
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; think about this.
[1:07:29] Your sin never existed.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; If you have confessed your sins, they
[1:07:34] don't exist.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; They're gone, friends.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; And not even God will remember them.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; I might jump yet tonight.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus said here, I am the
[1:07:51] resurrection and the life. And the word
[1:07:55] there
[1:07:57] is Zoey which means God's life
[1:08:02] and and I puzzled over that for a long
[1:08:04] time like the the moment right and he
[1:08:08] said and he said you know I
[1:08:12] there he said though he were dead yet
[1:08:14] shall he live. Well why is he going to
[1:08:17] live? Because the I am is the
[1:08:20] resurrection. And if that blood has been
[1:08:22] pumping past that Holy Ghost,
[1:08:25] well, if you're one of those that's not
[1:08:27] going to be alive and remain as one
[1:08:28] another place in the scripture says,
[1:08:31] don't matter.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Because every time that blood went past
[1:08:35] there, the creative power of God was
[1:08:37] creating that person as a resurrected
[1:08:40] saint.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He was creating you,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; He's creating all of us right now for
[1:08:47] one or the other. I don't
[1:08:51] I can't tell you who's who or whatever,
[1:08:53] but God knows.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; And he is creating you to either be a
[1:08:57] resurrected saint, which is one of those
[1:09:00] that when they died, they didn't really
[1:09:01] we Christians never die. We just step
[1:09:04] from one dimension into another one.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Just now think about it. How do you do
[1:09:09] that? Because you're traveling faster
[1:09:12] than the speed of light because you're
[1:09:14] traveling at the speed or the thoughts
[1:09:17] of God. And in uh 1 Corinthians 2:16,
[1:09:22] let's just read that. We're we're okay,
[1:09:24] I think, timewise.
[1:09:26] Uh
[1:09:34] because we're moving at the speed of
[1:09:36] thought.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; And in 1 Corinthians 2, I'm still I'm
[1:09:41] working on this new Bible. I'm getting
[1:09:43] more and more through it, and I really
[1:09:45] like it, but I'm still slow. So give me
[1:09:49] okay he said uh 2 and 16 he said for who
[1:09:54] hath known the mind of the Lord that he
[1:09:57] may instruct him. So you have to know
[1:09:59] the Lord
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; to be instructed by him because then it
[1:10:04] says, "But we have the mind of Christ."
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; We have the mind of Christ.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; And the mind of Christ
[1:10:15] there were the guys on the road to
[1:10:16] Emmas. Remember that? And and here they
[1:10:20] were walking the wrong direction because
[1:10:22] they're leaving Jerusalem and they were
[1:10:24] preaching the gospel to Jesus. Well,
[1:10:27] yeah. You know, we've had this prophet
[1:10:29] on the scene. Just think about this,
[1:10:31] okay? Oh, yeah. Well, why are you guys
[1:10:34] so sad? Well, well, there was this great
[1:10:36] mighty prophet on the scene. So, he's
[1:10:38] they're telling him about a prophet. And
[1:10:40] they said, "And we thought that he
[1:10:42] should be the Messiah. So, now they're
[1:10:43] talking about this." And, you know, it
[1:10:45] was that close. You think these people
[1:10:47] out here don't have problems with it? Of
[1:10:49] course, they have problems with it
[1:10:51] because it was that close, friends. And
[1:10:53] then we thought that this prophet was
[1:10:55] now God.
[1:10:58] And so they and so they're preaching
[1:11:00] about that and and then they could go a
[1:11:03] little another step. They said and then
[1:11:05] here this morning the sisters went down
[1:11:08] there. And can you believe this? They
[1:11:10] said that he wasn't in the tomb and told
[1:11:13] and told the other disciples that he
[1:11:15] raised from the dead. And there was an
[1:11:16] angel in there. She said that spoke to
[1:11:18] her and told those those girls that.
[1:11:22] And so they're preaching all this stuff
[1:11:24] to Jesus and they don't even have the
[1:11:26] Holy Ghost yet.
[1:11:29] H
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; interesting.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Interesting, isn't it? Yeah. And you
[1:11:33] wonder why there's problems in the
[1:11:35] message or in religion as a whole
[1:11:39] because there's out there that can
[1:11:40] preach at you about the death, burial,
[1:11:42] and resurrection and not have the Holy
[1:11:45] Ghost because they never got a personal
[1:11:47] experience with Christ. How do you get
[1:11:50] it? You ask him.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Just ask. It's like if you need a drink,
[1:11:57] just ask. I'll give you the, you know, I
[1:11:59] won't give you this bottle, but I'll
[1:12:00] give you a bottle. You know, who knows
[1:12:03] what what I had in this beard today.
[1:12:07] But so you understand, we just ask him.
[1:12:10] And when you ask him, he'll come upon
[1:12:13] you and he'll cause you to what we call
[1:12:17] repent. He will cause you to do those
[1:12:19] things. And for some people, you know,
[1:12:22] for me, I woke up on the floor covered
[1:12:25] in tears like I'd been in a shower.
[1:12:28] For other people, maybe they don't have
[1:12:30] so much they're packing. And there's I
[1:12:33] remember the story about the one guy
[1:12:35] that uh all he did was pick up a tract
[1:12:38] off of a car and I believe the track
[1:12:42] said something like uh where are you
[1:12:43] going to spend eternity? And it really
[1:12:46] it shocked the man. He was like, "Oh,
[1:12:49] wow." They say he wadded it up and threw
[1:12:52] it in the garbage.
[1:12:55] H
[1:12:57] and but that from that day on he started
[1:12:59] searching. He went to this church and
[1:13:01] that church and this church and that
[1:13:04] doctrine and this and that and this and
[1:13:07] Billy Graham, Oral Roberts, all the
[1:13:08] bigname guys. And finally,
[1:13:12] he thought, "How do I get this Holy
[1:13:14] Ghost? I've been prayed for. I I've
[1:13:17] danced. I've shouted. I' But I just
[1:13:19] don't feel like I I got it."
[1:13:23] And somebody said, "Well, there's a
[1:13:25] prophet down there. Maybe you should go
[1:13:26] see him." And some people, I guess, even
[1:13:29] said, "Well, maybe blasphemed or
[1:13:31] something."
[1:13:33] Because in his life, he didn't feel like
[1:13:35] he had what he was supposed to have. And
[1:13:37] when he goes before that prophet's
[1:13:41] vision,
[1:13:43] he said, "Oh, I see you picking up that
[1:13:46] tract and I see you wadded it up and you
[1:13:49] threw it away." But he said, "That's
[1:13:52] when you got it."
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; That's when you got it. And the guy
[1:13:59] goes, "What?" He said, "Because that's
[1:14:03] what led you
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; here.
[1:14:08] How simple is this?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "I am the resurrection
[1:14:18] and I am the life." And he says, "We
[1:14:21] have the mind of Christ." Well, the mind
[1:14:23] of Christ when after they, you know, had
[1:14:25] told him all that stuff, he he calls
[1:14:29] them fools.
[1:14:31] You fools. slow of heart to understand
[1:14:34] what all that the prophets
[1:14:38] and the law had spoken
[1:14:42] because Jesus Christ is all over the
[1:14:44] law.
[1:14:45] He's all over the prophets because it's
[1:14:48] him in in shadow and type form. And so
[1:14:54] he calls him fools and he, you know,
[1:14:56] they're he's he's waving goodbye. Hey,
[1:14:58] see you guys around. They're going, "No,
[1:14:59] no, no, no. stay, stay, stay with us
[1:15:02] tonight.
[1:15:04] So he said, "Okay." So he goes in and to
[1:15:07] the I guess they call it an inn. And and
[1:15:09] when they're in there, they he starts to
[1:15:12] break the bread at the meal. And when
[1:15:15] they see the breaking of the bread,
[1:15:18] the Bible said their eyes came open.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:22] Because that breaking of the bread
[1:15:25] signified a change
[1:15:28] from an Old Testament law which was
[1:15:31] still valid even when Jesus was there
[1:15:33] because he told the lepers, "Go down,
[1:15:35] show yourself to the priest and make the
[1:15:37] sacrifice."
[1:15:39] The law was still in effect until death,
[1:15:43] burial, and resurrection.
[1:15:47] And so he
[1:15:50] he turns to him when they saw that part.
[1:15:55] What happened? What did the mind of
[1:15:58] Christ do with Jesus?
[1:16:00] Gone.
[1:16:02] Where did he go? I don't know. Anybody
[1:16:06] got any ideas? I don't know where he
[1:16:08] went. Just says that he did. He vanished
[1:16:11] when they re when they recognized him.
[1:16:14] He vanished.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Let that soak in for a second.
[1:16:21] When we recognize him, we don't have to
[1:16:23] see him here in physical form.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Because he's here.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; In the form of the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; And what's the next thing it did? The
[1:16:33] word had corrected the error and they
[1:16:36] turned around and headed straight back
[1:16:38] to Jerusalem because the word says
[1:16:40] that's where the Holy Ghost was going to
[1:16:42] be poured out.
[1:16:44] So they had they got their words
[1:16:46] corrected and away they went.
[1:16:49] And it's the same way with us as
[1:16:51] Christians.
[1:16:52] Might happen like that
[1:16:55] 3 minutes through the drive-thru or it
[1:16:58] might be like the license plate place.
[1:17:02] I don't know.
[1:17:05] Each one of us is different. We each
[1:17:06] have a part to play in this gospel of
[1:17:09] Jesus Christ. So he said, "I am the
[1:17:11] resurrection and the life." And that
[1:17:14] Zoey life, it just I looked at it and
[1:17:16] looked at it and looked at it and I
[1:17:18] prayed and prayed and prayed. I said, "I
[1:17:19] don't quite understand exactly why this
[1:17:22] is used like that." And one day the
[1:17:25] spirit of the Lord, he had mercy on me.
[1:17:27] Some kind of I was a logger, come on.
[1:17:30] And a firefighter. I wasn't a priest.
[1:17:34] and and he just said, "Where is the
[1:17:36] mention of death?"
[1:17:40] Uh, it's not there.
[1:17:43] So, if it's talking about eternal life,
[1:17:47] it's talking about a life without death.
[1:17:50] And what do we call the rapture or the
[1:17:53] translation, the body change? It's the
[1:17:56] ability to walk out of this off this
[1:17:59] planet
[1:18:00] without death.
[1:18:03] Well,
[1:18:05] but Paul said, "I die daily." Yeah,
[1:18:08] you're right.
[1:18:10] We die daily. That is our death
[1:18:14] is to die daily to sacrifice our
[1:18:18] desires, our needs, our wants, whatever
[1:18:21] it is that if it's you can have all
[1:18:24] anything you want if it's in this book.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; But if it's not, then we sacrifice that.
[1:18:31] We lay it on the altar of our heart and
[1:18:33] say, "Lord, please take that out of me.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Just take it out
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; because I want to be full of the Holy
[1:18:41] Ghost."
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:18:45] it's the ability to walk out of here
[1:18:47] without death because how by the mind of
[1:18:50] Christ because the same mind that took
[1:18:53] him disappeared from those guys and emus
[1:18:58] where's the next time you see him? All
[1:19:00] the disciples are gathered together in
[1:19:02] Jerusalem and what happens?
[1:19:04] He comes walking through the walls. How
[1:19:06] you doing, guys?
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; What did that? The mind of Christ.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be with what? I'm in the
[1:19:16] Father. The Father's in me and I in you.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be with his disciples
[1:19:24] so that they could have the same
[1:19:26] experience or the same mind that he did.
[1:19:29] He showed him.
[1:19:32] How did he just do that?
[1:19:34] How? Well, it was Philillip, wasn't it?
[1:19:38] Philip got the revelation somewhere
[1:19:40] along the line because here he is. He's,
[1:19:43] you know, they was in a big revival
[1:19:45] meeting. Brother Brandham said in a big
[1:19:48] revival meeting. Got this, you know,
[1:19:50] like the geese. What What makes what?
[1:19:53] What? Why did we start hearing geese two
[1:19:55] days ago?
[1:19:57] Well, because something in those geese
[1:19:59] said, "It's time to get out of the north
[1:20:00] country because it's getting ready to
[1:20:03] get cold." And there was something that
[1:20:08] in them
[1:20:10] they needed to see that so that they
[1:20:13] would know that's possible. All things
[1:20:16] are possible. And here was Philillip. He
[1:20:19] gets that thing that I got to get out of
[1:20:21] this meeting. I don't know. There's
[1:20:23] something going on here and I'm I'm just
[1:20:25] not comfortable. Yeah, they're having a
[1:20:27] nice revival, but Lord, I just I want to
[1:20:30] go eat a sandwich or something. I don't
[1:20:32] know. And so he he leaves and when he
[1:20:35] leaves, all of a sudden, you know,
[1:20:37] here's this guy in a chariot and reading
[1:20:39] a Bible.
[1:20:41] It's so simple, friends.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; It's so so simple. This this guy's
[1:20:46] reading a Bible. the the uno I think he
[1:20:48] was from Ethiopia if I remember and he's
[1:20:52] he's there and he's reading the Bible
[1:20:53] and Philip just asks do you know what
[1:20:56] you're reading
[1:20:59] you ever see people like that
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; you ever ask him
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; we should
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; you know what you're reading the guy
[1:21:07] goes not really need somebody to teach
[1:21:09] me well here's a man full of the Holy
[1:21:12] Ghost say oh where was the Holy Ghost
[1:21:16] the teacher
[1:21:17] is the Holy Ghost and it's in Philillip
[1:21:20] and he gets in the chariot.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And he pre begins he starts taking the
[1:21:25] same scriptures and stuff that probably
[1:21:27] that Jesus gave him on the road to Emmas
[1:21:30] showing him Jesus Christ in the
[1:21:32] scripture. They didn't have the New
[1:21:34] Testament yet. So he had to be using the
[1:21:37] Old Testament to show him Jesus Christ.
[1:21:40] And the guy, hey, I want to get
[1:21:43] baptized.
[1:21:46] How did he get the jump from the Old
[1:21:49] Testament to getting baptized in the
[1:21:51] Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:53] without a New Testament being there? But
[1:21:56] he did.
[1:21:58] And he went and got baptized. And as
[1:21:59] soon as he got baptized, what happened
[1:22:01] to Philillip? The mind of Christ
[1:22:05] out of there. It is very possible,
[1:22:07] friends.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Very, very, very possible. All things
[1:22:11] are possible to those that believe.
[1:22:14] Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And so we see this he said in the
[1:22:17] beginning are uh you know I am the
[1:22:19] resurrection and the life and then we
[1:22:21] look at what the requirements were
[1:22:26] the you want to know what the
[1:22:28] requirements is everybody well can I
[1:22:30] make it can I do well if we're putting
[1:22:33] this rapture this rapture thing this
[1:22:35] body change way off in the future
[1:22:39] what are we doing
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; we're doing the same thing as well.
[1:22:45] Jesus is coming. He's coming. He's
[1:22:46] coming. And ignoring the fact that he's
[1:22:49] here right now.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; I'll say that again. He is here right
[1:22:54] now.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Not in the form of the man on Calvary.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said he's the same
[1:23:02] yesterday,
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; the man on Calvary today. That's the God
[1:23:06] that's here right now. And I remember we
[1:23:10] mentioned this a while back but the
[1:23:12] words there is from the Greek is
[1:23:15] copulative cumulative cumulative and
[1:23:17] what that means is a very close
[1:23:19] relationship that accumulates. It's like
[1:23:22] you get put a man and a woman together
[1:23:24] in in wedlock and what's it produce?
[1:23:26] Produces something children.
[1:23:30] And so Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:23:34] and today produces forever.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; And so the what's it say there?
[1:23:48] It says, "And whosoever lives and
[1:23:51] believes in me," where do you have to
[1:23:53] be? In me. I'm in the Father. Father's
[1:23:58] in me. I in you, you in me. And so if we
[1:24:01] are in Jesus Christ, you are in the I am
[1:24:07] who is the rapture.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Scripturally, I'm just doing this
[1:24:12] scripture. Okay. If we stay in the
[1:24:13] scripture.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:16] So we are if you are in Jesus Christ and
[1:24:19] Jesus Christ is in you.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; What in the world? Why are we afraid?
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And I think about again mentioning you
[1:24:31] know brother Brennham and he said he got
[1:24:33] to the place to where he said you know
[1:24:36] if I'm a Judas he goes make me a really
[1:24:39] good one
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; because I love him.
[1:24:44] I love him so much.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And when we get to the place to where we
[1:24:49] love God more than anything in the
[1:24:52] world.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; And we love him so much that we don't
[1:24:56] even care what happens to us beyond this
[1:24:59] veil.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; You're just getting ready for service.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; That means okay. God says now I can use
[1:25:08] you.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's it. Exactly. that my opinion but
[1:25:13] thank you brother
[1:25:15] sir
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; because when we get because why because
[1:25:18] all fear is gone.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; And and the only thing he said was
[1:25:24] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:25:26] shall never die. Now I'm not saying
[1:25:30] uh you know there's a there was a
[1:25:32] doctrine went around that said I can't
[1:25:33] die. That's not what it says,
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:36] you know, and they found that some of
[1:25:39] those people that said they couldn't die
[1:25:40] did die.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Well, it's nice to claim it. That's
[1:25:45] fine. But if you do, make sure you got
[1:25:48] the resurrection
[1:25:50] in there, too, because it's all in Jesus
[1:25:53] Christ. It's all in your personal
[1:25:56] experience with Jesus Christ.
[1:26:00] And the only
[1:26:03] says, do you believe it? Believest thou
[1:26:06] this? That's the requirement.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Do we believe it? Do we believe that I
[1:26:14] have the mind of Christ?
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Well, man, you sure did some stupid
[1:26:18] stuff. You, you know, dumb stuff
[1:26:20] yesterday.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I did. You know, the enemy's
[1:26:25] right there going
[1:26:28] and you're going, "Uh,
[1:26:31] well,
[1:26:32] no, he said I have it." Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And if I do something or say something
[1:26:38] that I shouldn't, then the only place to
[1:26:40] go is to that bucket of bleach.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Because if it hits that bleach, it never
[1:26:47] existed in the first place. You are
[1:26:50] absolutely totally. He that is justified
[1:26:53] is sanctified. He that is sanctified is
[1:26:58] glorified.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Why? because it all comes from that jump
[1:27:04] of sequence
[1:27:06] from mortal to immortality.
[1:27:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:13] Let's just look at the type and shadow
[1:27:14] as we get ready to close in Hebrews the
[1:27:19] 10th or 11th chapter. I I love
[1:27:24] because he's our type in shadow. Now
[1:27:26] there there was a big question came up
[1:27:28] one time when I was in Panama. They
[1:27:30] couldn't figure out out, you know, about
[1:27:32] Enoch and, you know, where did Enoch go?
[1:27:35] What did he Well, there's a a place in
[1:27:38] one of the message books where
[1:27:41] brother Brennham said that he was he
[1:27:43] didn't go all the way to glory.
[1:27:46] No, he just moved without death into the
[1:27:50] regions of the saved.
[1:27:53] the ones that when Jesus came up out of
[1:27:56] uh out of hell after preaching to those
[1:27:58] in hell that and he went by there and
[1:28:02] you've heard that you know the mighty
[1:28:04] conqueror and Enoch was with that group
[1:28:08] because that was the group he was born
[1:28:10] into
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; or with so to speak and so but he had
[1:28:16] enough
[1:28:19] rapture power change power he did it
[1:28:21] without dying. He just walked over.
[1:28:26] Just walked over. And And so we look at
[1:28:29] here in Hebrews 11:5.
[1:28:32] By faith. How did he do it? By faith. He
[1:28:35] had faith. That Enoch was translated
[1:28:38] that he should not see death. And he was
[1:28:40] not found. Because God had translated
[1:28:44] him. Thank you. God translated him.
[1:28:49] And before his translation, he had a
[1:28:52] testimony. And that testimony pleased
[1:28:55] God.
[1:28:56] Again, we're just looking at this by way
[1:29:00] of the scripture. Nobody's I don't have
[1:29:02] a pet peeve doctrine or anything, but
[1:29:05] what the scripture says that Enoch was
[1:29:08] translated
[1:29:10] I don't see
[1:29:12] ablar espanol. Anyone?
[1:29:17] Poito, please. Uh, see, uh,
[1:29:22] you're not going to do it. She won't do
[1:29:26] it. And I if I could,
[1:29:30] how about
[1:29:32] I use that a lot. And to translate that
[1:29:36] for you, that means what am I doing
[1:29:38] here?
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; I use it a lot when I'm in Spanish
[1:29:42] countries.
[1:29:44] But what just happened? You heard me
[1:29:47] speak from one man the mind of English
[1:29:51] and it was translated in sequence
[1:29:55] into another language into the a mind. I
[1:29:58] love to go to countries and get into
[1:30:00] their language because if you get into
[1:30:02] their language, you start understanding
[1:30:05] their mind.
[1:30:07] Was talking about brother Eric. We got,
[1:30:08] you know, I had a wonderful time with
[1:30:10] him here,
[1:30:12] you know, cruising around and talking
[1:30:13] about the things of the Lord and stuff.
[1:30:16] And Japanese language, you know, there's
[1:30:19] a big difference between right brain,
[1:30:21] left brain. And those people are very
[1:30:24] culturally different. They say that the
[1:30:27] whatever side of the brain they use,
[1:30:29] it's the same kind that we use for music
[1:30:31] and art. Well, there's art everywhere in
[1:30:33] Japan.
[1:30:35] Why? because that's what's in their
[1:30:38] mind.
[1:30:40] And it said that he was translated, but
[1:30:42] that translation when his mind
[1:30:46] was said he was translated that he
[1:30:49] shouldn't see death.
[1:30:51] What do you mean he could not see death?
[1:30:54] Okay, if this was death tonight, just
[1:30:59] and Enoch, we don't know what happened,
[1:31:01] how it happened, it just said he walked
[1:31:03] with God and he wasn't there anymore.
[1:31:05] Then if he's walking along that road and
[1:31:07] there's death,
[1:31:10] that's what he sees
[1:31:14] because he couldn't see death. I'm just
[1:31:18] tell That's what it said, right? I'm not
[1:31:20] making this up. He just couldn't see it.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Couldn't see it. Why? because his mind
[1:31:28] had been translated
[1:31:31] from an earthly fleshly mind into the
[1:31:34] mind of God.
[1:31:37] And you can go back and read about him.
[1:31:38] I think it's Genesis 3, I think it is,
[1:31:41] and how it said that
[1:31:44] he was it said he was translated so that
[1:31:46] he couldn't see death. A and here
[1:31:50] because God had translated him. So God
[1:31:54] translated.
[1:31:56] Well, I wonder what God what language
[1:31:58] God was using.
[1:32:02] Are you understanding?
[1:32:05] He was translated
[1:32:07] because God had translated him.
[1:32:11] God put his mind into Enoch so that
[1:32:15] Enoch, he just couldn't see death. It
[1:32:17] just wasn't there. Wasn't in his
[1:32:19] vocabulary.
[1:32:22] It's not in God's vocabulary.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And if God, we are in God.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Where does that vocabulary exist?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Right here.
[1:32:37] Because I am the resurrection.
[1:32:40] I am the life. Who is the I am that
[1:32:44] lives in you and me. But now remember I
[1:32:47] said watch the sequence because when
[1:32:50] Jesus came on the scene and she
[1:32:53] exercised faith that's this first word
[1:32:57] second word right there faith when she
[1:33:00] exercised faith. Oh if my brother master
[1:33:05] that's Messiah God
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; if you'd have been here my brother
[1:33:10] wouldn't have died. She's exercising
[1:33:13] faith to tell him and she even says
[1:33:15] nevertheless whatever you ask God will
[1:33:18] give it to you. So Enoch was
[1:33:21] exercising that faith and that faith
[1:33:25] brought a translation or a changing of
[1:33:27] his
[1:33:29] mental conception or his language from
[1:33:32] an earthly one to a heavenly one. God
[1:33:36] had translated him.
[1:33:39] But before his translation, he had this
[1:33:42] testimony that he pleased God. You ever
[1:33:46] read Enoch's testimony?
[1:33:49] It actually tells us what it is.
[1:33:53] Does anybody know where it is? You're
[1:33:55] smiling.
[1:33:58] Let's look at Jude. We'll finish with
[1:34:00] this.
[1:34:01] Been such a wonderful group, but I want
[1:34:03] to get you out of here by 9.
[1:34:07] I'm I'll have to hurry here, but it's
[1:34:09] this is only just a little bit.
[1:34:14] Jude, it only has one chapter
[1:34:17] and and it's talking about spots in your
[1:34:19] feast of charity, the feast and the
[1:34:21] feeding without fear, clouds and about
[1:34:24] all the bad guys. Okay? And it comes
[1:34:27] down in verse 14.
[1:34:30] And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam,
[1:34:34] prophesied of these things, saying,
[1:34:37] "Behold, the Lord cometh with 10
[1:34:39] thousands of his saints."
[1:34:42] H to execute judgment upon all, and to
[1:34:47] convince all that are ungodly among them
[1:34:49] of all their ungodly deeds which they
[1:34:51] have ungodly committed, and of all their
[1:34:53] hard speeches which ungodly sinners have
[1:34:56] spoken against him. what he's telling us
[1:35:01] the change of order.
[1:35:04] Enoch was trying to tell the people or
[1:35:07] he was telling the people.
[1:35:10] How did he do it? He prophesied.
[1:35:13] He prophesied just like Jesus turns back
[1:35:16] to her and says, "Thy brother will rise
[1:35:19] again." He's telling her there's going
[1:35:21] to be a change for the glory of Israel.
[1:35:24] It's coming again.
[1:35:27] It's going to come forth again. And
[1:35:30] here's Enoch saying,
[1:35:33] telling them, he prophesied of these
[1:35:35] things. Behold, the Lord cometh with
[1:35:36] 10,000 of his saints. What's his
[1:35:39] prophecy?
[1:35:41] Behold, the Lord comes.
[1:35:46] That's a present tense. Come.
[1:35:49] Because come in Hebrew can go mean the
[1:35:53] same as going. Because if I I came out
[1:35:56] tonight or I you know I I come here
[1:35:58] tonight
[1:36:00] but I had to go from that room to get
[1:36:03] here.
[1:36:06] So it's a coming and a going. And he
[1:36:09] said he comes what comes with 10
[1:36:13] thousands of his saints. He's
[1:36:15] prophesying about the coming of the
[1:36:16] Lord.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Go home and look at the cloud picture
[1:36:21] and then tell me about it.
[1:36:27] But it is also prophesying to execute
[1:36:30] judgment.
[1:36:32] Now I we don't have time to go into
[1:36:34] Isaiah. Maybe some other time and we can
[1:36:37] see where the break is in Isaiah where
[1:36:39] it changes from what we call grace to
[1:36:43] judgment. But the highest form of
[1:36:44] judgment there is or I mean the highest
[1:36:47] form of grace is actually judgment
[1:36:49] because only the judge has the power to
[1:36:52] look at your case and go never did it.
[1:36:55] Get out of the courtroom.
[1:37:01] You never did it.
[1:37:05] Get out of the courtroom.
[1:37:08] So what is this rapture? It's Christ in
[1:37:11] you.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Christ in me because he is my
[1:37:17] rapture or my body change. He is my
[1:37:20] resurrection. He is my life. Let us
[1:37:23] stand. Sister, please come. God bless
[1:37:26] you. We made it. Three minutes under the
[1:37:29] wire. And I do that just simply because
[1:37:33] because I do. I don't know why.
[1:37:38] I can't know everything about his life.
[1:37:41] Praise the Lord. How about do you know
[1:37:44] that uh
[1:37:47] I now see I want I'm thinking of it in
[1:37:48] Spanish. There's that change there.
[1:37:51] Lord, you are so precious.
[1:37:55] Okay, start. Sister brother Alex, you be
[1:37:58] out of here. I do it in A. I don't know
[1:38:01] what key you do it in.
[1:38:05] It says G, but I think A is for baby.
[1:38:07] Lord,
[1:38:09] you are
[1:38:12] so precious
[1:38:14] to me.
[1:38:18] Lord,
[1:38:20] you are
[1:38:23] so precious
[1:38:26] to me.
[1:38:28] And I love
[1:38:32] you.
[1:38:34] Yes, I love
[1:38:38] you
[1:38:40] because
[1:38:43] you first love me.
[1:38:51] Oh Lord,
[1:38:54] you are
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; so gracious
[1:39:00] to me.
[1:39:03] Lord,
[1:39:05] you are
[1:39:08] so gracious
[1:39:11] to me
[1:39:14] and I love
[1:39:18] you.
[1:39:20] Yes, I love
[1:39:24] you
[1:39:26] because
[1:39:28] you first love me. We always sing that
[1:39:34] part again. And I love
[1:39:39] you.
[1:39:41] Yes, I love
[1:39:45] you.
[1:39:47] because
[1:39:50] you first love
[1:39:53] me.
[1:39:55] I want to do something here just as we
[1:39:58] as Alex comes.
[1:40:00] I'm going to sing it in Spanish
[1:40:03] because it's a different mind.
[1:40:06] But to show you how that when Enoch was
[1:40:10] translated, they go together in a
[1:40:12] sequence.
[1:40:14] So, I'm going to sing it from if I could
[1:40:16] do it in Japanese, I would, but I I I
[1:40:18] know it in Malagasi in Fr. I used to
[1:40:21] know it in French. And so, I'll sing it
[1:40:24] in Spanish and you guys sing it in
[1:40:26] English. If you know it in Spanish, sing
[1:40:28] it with me.
[1:40:40] I'll sing it in Malagasi. I remember it.

[1:43:31] Justified
[1:43:34] D.
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:40] I was sitting alone in one dream about
[1:43:45] what I'm supposed to do.
[1:43:49] I can't deny the times I've made
[1:43:52] mistakes. I can't hide from him. He
[1:43:56] knew.
[1:43:58] But I know that deep within my soul, I
[1:44:03] feel sorry. Honest I do.
[1:44:07] So I just cry and say, "Forgive me,
[1:44:11] Lord. Forgive me, Lord. Will you?" Oh,
[1:44:16] justified.
[1:44:21] I'm justified.
[1:44:25] You have not done it in the first place.
[1:44:30] You're justified.
[1:44:35] Justified.
[1:44:39] Oh, justified.
[1:44:44] You have not done it in the first place.
[1:44:49] You're justified.
[1:44:54] He looked at your perfect picture
[1:44:59] without blame, spot, or wrinkle.
[1:45:04] He didn't look at you where you are now.
[1:45:09] He looked from eternity.
[1:45:13] He said, "You're just trapped in that
[1:45:16] body.
[1:45:18] You by past your theophony.
[1:45:22] You have not done it in the first place.
[1:45:27] You're justified.
[1:45:31] Oh, justified.
[1:45:37] Justified.
[1:45:41] You have not done it in the first place.
[1:45:46] You're justified.
[1:45:51] Justified.
[1:45:56] Justified.
[1:46:00] You have not done it in the first place.
[1:46:05] You're justified. Let's sing. I'm
[1:46:07] justified now. Oh, I'm justified.
[1:46:14] I'm justified.
[1:46:19] I have not done it in the first place.
[1:46:24] I'm justified.
[1:46:28] I'm justified.
[1:46:33] I'm justified.
[1:46:38] I have not done it in the first place.
[1:46:42] I'm justified.
[1:46:46] Amen.
[1:46:48] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:46:50] I thought of that song. I don't think
[1:46:51] we've ever sang it. Maybe we can just
[1:46:53] sing the chorus. Um, I'm going to be
[1:46:56] gone.
[1:46:58] You can look that up.
[1:47:03] That's the one. Chorus.
[1:47:08] I'm going to be gone
[1:47:12] in a twinkling of an eye. I'm going to
[1:47:16] be gone.
[1:47:20] I won't have time to say goodbye. I'm
[1:47:24] going to be gone.
[1:47:28] It could be while I'm singing this song.
[1:47:31] I'm going to be gone and it won't be
[1:47:35] long. I'm going to be gone. One more
[1:47:38] time.
[1:47:39] I'm going to be gone
[1:47:44] in a twinkling of an eye. I'm going to
[1:47:48] be gone.
[1:47:51] I won't have time to say goodbye. I'm
[1:47:56] going to be gone.
[1:48:00] Could be while I'm singing this song.
[1:48:03] I'm going to be gone and it won't be
[1:48:06] long. I'm going to be gone. One last
[1:48:10] time. Oh, I'm going to be gone
[1:48:16] in a twinkling of an eye. going to be
[1:48:21] gone.
[1:48:24] I won't have time to say goodbye. I'm
[1:48:28] going to be gone.
[1:48:32] Could be while I'm singing this song.
[1:48:36] I'm going to be gone and it won't be
[1:48:39] long. I'm going to be gone.
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:45] Amen.
[1:48:46] Can you show me the verse? Maybe we
[1:48:48] could try. I think we have time.
[1:48:55] This soul
[1:48:57] getting better
[1:49:00] every day. It's getting worse. So much
[1:49:04] fighting and confusion going on down
[1:49:08] here on Earth. But don't let that bother
[1:49:14] me cuz I'm not here to stay.
[1:49:18] I know my Lord is coming soon and I'll
[1:49:23] be called away. I'm going to be gone
[1:49:29] in a twinkling of an eye. I'm going to
[1:49:33] be gone.
[1:49:36] I won't have time to say goodbye. I'm
[1:49:40] going to be gone.
[1:49:43] Could be while I'm singing this song.
[1:49:47] I'm going to be gone and it won't be
[1:49:50] long. I'm going to be gone.
[1:49:54] Oh, it could be just any morning. It
[1:49:59] could be at night or noon. We don't know
[1:50:04] just when he's coming, but we know he's
[1:50:08] coming soon. I can say with calm
[1:50:12] assurance, this old world is not my
[1:50:16] home. One of these days you're going to
[1:50:20] look for me. Praise God. I'm going to be
[1:50:24] gone. I'm going to be gone.
[1:50:28] Oh, in a twinkling of an eye, I'm going
[1:50:32] to be gone.
[1:50:36] Won't have time to say goodbye. I'm
[1:50:39] going to be gone.
[1:50:43] Could be a while. I'm singing this song.
[1:50:46] I'm going to be gone and it won't be
[1:50:49] long. I'm going to be gone.
[1:50:54] Oh, I'm going to be gone and it won't be
[1:50:57] long. I'm going to be gone.
[1:51:02] Amen.
