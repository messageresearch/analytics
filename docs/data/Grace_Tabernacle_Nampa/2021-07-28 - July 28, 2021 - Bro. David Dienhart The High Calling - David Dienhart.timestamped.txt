[10:59] [Music]
[11:17] amen well god bless you good to have you
[11:20] all here this evening
[11:21] and gathered in his name amen looking
[11:23] for a wonderful time in his presence
[11:25] and you know sometimes we just have a
[11:28] satan gives us a horrible monday and
[11:30] tuesday
[11:31] and then we get to come to church and
[11:33] give it back to him hey man
[11:35] well i'd like to sing number 452
[11:39] now i was looking i was like i told
[11:41] myself there's less people
[11:44] on this side i'll have you sing with me
[11:46] and the more people if you want to put
[11:47] on the screen
[11:49] i love the red book and that is not the
[11:51] song that's 452.
[11:55] that is not right
[11:58] that is a different ooh
[12:02] that's scary hallelujah we shall rise
[12:06] what happened to our program
[12:10] [Music]
[12:14] try that again there you are that's her
[12:18] it's 205.
[12:21] okay i have announcement with regards to
[12:23] that anyways
[12:24] so well
[12:28] because i might as well make that
[12:30] announcement we are going to
[12:32] because when i came down from canada i
[12:34] brought my song
[12:35] book and then you guys had your song
[12:37] book we brought them together
[12:40] that's probably what's happening here so
[12:42] we're i'm going to be reprinting
[12:44] my song book because we've made changes
[12:46] so if there are
[12:48] songs that courses we're singing and
[12:50] maybe there's verses that i don't know
[12:52] about but they can be put in
[12:53] get those to me so in the next month or
[12:56] so i'd like to have those
[12:57] because i'm going to put them in the in
[13:00] to make sure they're in
[13:01] and if i don't know them learn them and
[13:04] uh
[13:04] so we can just have more of a fuller
[13:06] song song book
[13:08] i i think having two thousand songs
[13:10] isn't enough so we need more
[13:14] so anyways what i was what i was wanting
[13:15] to get at is how many remember the old
[13:18] red hymn book okay
[13:20] for all us old people i love it and i
[13:23] miss it
[13:24] when this came into being we lost well i
[13:27] don't want to say the word tradition
[13:28] but we lost something and so what i'd
[13:30] like is this side of the congregation
[13:33] to sing what's in the brackets okay so
[13:36] it's kind of
[13:37] after time and those over here can just
[13:39] follow me
[13:41] because there's less of us and i'll need
[13:43] the help
[13:44] so let's let's sing it i'll direct you
[13:46] with my hand and you'll kind of know
[13:48] when to come in but i i missed that
[13:50] because i remember as
[13:51] a child we would sing this and hear to
[13:53] hear half the congregation did the
[13:54] halftime and
[13:55] the rest of congregation didn't know
[13:56] what half time was just follow the song
[13:58] later
[13:58] so let's try that
[14:02] the resurrection morning when the trump
[14:06] god shall sound eyes
[14:11] we shall rise and i forgot the song when
[14:14] the saints will come

[33:29] [Music]
[33:37] [Music]
[33:50] our
[33:57] hallelujah you can't talk about jesus
[34:01] enough because every time you talk about
[34:05] him
[34:05] every time you meditate on him he comes
[34:08] near
[34:09] you draw an eye to god and he'll draw
[34:11] night to you
[34:12] amen i think that ought to be our
[34:14] conversation more and more
[34:16] is on him is on his goodness on his
[34:20] word which he is you know that he is the
[34:22] word
[34:24] we say i believe jesus then you believe
[34:26] the word
[34:28] how can you do one without the other see
[34:29] he's the same you can't
[34:31] you can't separate our lord jesus from
[34:33] his word
[34:35] he said i'll serve him then here's the
[34:37] word
[34:39] you see god's word is enough
[34:45] amen god's word is enough what god said
[34:48] in his word he's going to keep his word
[34:49] he's obligated to his word
[34:51] and if you came from him and a part of
[34:55] him and he's the word
[34:56] then you are become the word and so how
[34:59] can he turn his word down
[35:03] what a consolation when we know
[35:06] we are in him and he in us
[35:10] amen amen i
[35:13] thank the lord for the opportunity to
[35:16] god bless you
[35:17] dismissed amen i don't mean dismiss it's
[35:20] not a classroom
[35:21] but you go in the corner
[35:30] no no no no no no no we don't want to
[35:32] get in the corner if we're getting the
[35:33] corner god will get us out
[35:36] all right sometimes it's good to be in
[35:37] the corner we need those corners
[35:41] amen something tonight that it's almost
[35:44] like i'm calling this three different
[35:46] subjects
[35:47] three different topics through different
[35:48] titles
[35:50] and yet it's a strange way that the lord
[35:52] has led me to go this way and it may
[35:54] seem strange in the way it's brought
[35:57] but i know that this is god directing it
[36:00] and i can do only one thing follow him
[36:04] i don't know there don't i don't know
[36:06] how he's going to put it together how
[36:08] it'll be but i believe it'll speak to
[36:09] your heart
[36:11] if you'll just let him do it i believe
[36:14] it spoke to mine i know to speak to
[36:16] yours and it will continue to speak to
[36:18] mine
[36:18] amen has it trusted it speaks to you
[36:21] amen there's some things here i've got
[36:23] to read i'll do quite a bit of reading
[36:25] and i
[36:25] that's a little out of character for me
[36:27] i don't like to do that
[36:28] there's times when i will do that but
[36:30] please don't
[36:32] turn yourself off right now
[36:36] amen you can feel i just turn i'll turn
[36:38] him off i'm tired i've had a busy day
[36:41] you know i'm not going to listen now i
[36:43] want you to listen because
[36:44] the only way i know to bring this is the
[36:46] way god said to bring it
[36:47] and he showed me to bring it so i got to
[36:49] bring it that way so any minister will
[36:52] do the same thing
[36:54] we're all different god didn't put us in
[36:56] a
[36:57] in a in a uh
[37:00] yeah cookie cutter and made us all the
[37:02] same you're right brother it's a cookie
[37:04] cutter no we're not
[37:05] we are members in particular set aside
[37:09] particular
[37:09] under a certain measure of god and he
[37:12] can only follow
[37:13] as he leads i want to call this the the
[37:16] main title i'm calling it here is the
[37:18] high calling
[37:20] the high calling but underneath that is
[37:22] perfect strength by perfect weakness
[37:25] and then if i have time and may touch
[37:27] this at the end consider your ways
[37:30] so it seems strange the way that we're
[37:33] bringing this but
[37:34] but god have his way he's calling for
[37:37] you tonight
[37:38] i believe that we're not here by chance
[37:39] i believe that god brought us into this
[37:42] this building god's given us the
[37:43] opportunity to be here
[37:45] satan would have liked to kept you from
[37:47] coming because you've come to hear the
[37:49] word you haven't come to see or hear a
[37:51] man
[37:52] i don't think we ought to come to church
[37:54] at any time
[37:56] to hear what a man has to say we want to
[37:58] hear what god has to say through that
[38:00] man
[38:01] we must submit ourselves to him
[38:04] amen there's no flesh will glory in his
[38:06] presence how many believe you're in his
[38:08] presence
[38:09] amen then there's no glory that's gonna
[38:11] there's no flesh excuse me that will
[38:13] glory in his presence
[38:15] amen god works through flesh but he
[38:18] doesn't bring glory to the flesh
[38:20] amen but he gets glory to himself
[38:24] it's god's way to speak through man amen
[38:28] and i'm not just saying just ministry
[38:29] only i'm talking about every member of
[38:31] the body of christ man or woman
[38:33] god speaks through the housewife god
[38:35] speaks to the
[38:36] the the mother god speaks to the daddy
[38:39] god speaks to the husband god speaks
[38:41] remember every member of the body and
[38:43] its measure will speak
[38:45] because it is the blood speaking
[38:49] god speaks through that amen every
[38:52] member every member of the body
[38:54] is the blood of jesus christ by the
[38:56] spirit
[38:57] god has one place that he put his name
[39:00] and that's one place is where you've got
[39:02] to
[39:02] worship him and that's in christ there's
[39:05] only one true worship one place of true
[39:07] worship
[39:08] that's in christ we can only give in
[39:10] christ by by the true baptism of the
[39:12] holy spirit can we be placed
[39:14] in that position amen and when we're in
[39:16] that position then the word becomes
[39:19] quickened to us alive to us amen because
[39:22] it takes the spirit of god to quicken
[39:25] the word of god
[39:26] amen amen amen so we then the bride
[39:30] lives and
[39:31] and every member lives by revelation
[39:34] and that's not of ourselves it is the

[39:55] so he's here calling for you tonight
[39:59] to the high calling

[40:10] day in which
[40:11] we are in we are here brought in this
[40:13] hour to manifest the word for the hour
[40:16] we weren't here to manifest the word for
[40:18] another hour but for this hour
[40:21] amen and
[40:25] and it's a high calling the bride has
[40:27] the highest calling there is in the land
[40:30] amen she she's not just a fly by night
[40:34] she is god's wife she has a very high
[40:38] calling and we ought to conduct
[40:40] ourselves and i say god help us
[40:42] to remember to so submit ourselves to
[40:45] god
[40:46] and help us to live a life worthy of
[40:48] that call
[40:50] of that calling because we are have a
[40:52] high calling
[40:53] and so he's calling for you tonight to
[40:56] the high calling
[40:57] of perfect strength
[41:00] by perfect weakness
[41:04] amen of perfect strength
[41:07] by perfect weakness amen
[41:10] so i pray that after tonight you'll
[41:13] realize
[41:15] that you begin as paul said to glory in
[41:17] your weakness
[41:20] because unless you become weak you're in
[41:22] the way of god using you
[41:25] amen that's right because god uses
[41:27] weaklings
[41:29] he doesn't use man's knowledge and his
[41:32] ability of what he's learned
[41:33] god will not use it i i've
[41:36] i've got it's not a not just a statement
[41:39] here
[41:40] he uses himself when he called moses
[41:44] after he got moses to the place where he
[41:46] was so insufficient he made excuses for
[41:48] his weaknesses
[41:50] that he stood before that pillar of fire
[41:53] he said god i can't speak i can't talk i
[41:55] stutter
[41:56] i'm not eloquent i don't i don't have an
[41:58] ability i'm this i'm that i'm this and
[42:00] that
[42:01] and god's exactly where i want you
[42:04] and he meant to meet that light to
[42:07] anoint that something in him that god
[42:09] himself placed there so that god himself
[42:12] could come down and use
[42:13] himself he had to make a weakling so god
[42:16] could take what's in you
[42:18] and use it he has to take himself and
[42:22] uses himself
[42:25] now that's that's the that is
[42:29] the path of every true believer
[42:32] amen is that you have to become a
[42:34] complete weakling
[42:37] and and a total complete submission i'm
[42:39] going to come back on the surrender and
[42:41] submission here
[42:42] seem like every service now for the last
[42:44] several i've been on
[42:46] on on surrender submission
[42:51] and and committing and committal
[42:57] it takes submission god's looking for a
[43:00] wife
[43:01] that will submit herself completely
[43:03] everything
[43:04] she is everything she ever was all about
[43:08] it
[43:08] and realize that god deals with her
[43:12] sovereignly individually and that
[43:15] as a member of his body he has a right
[43:18] to do with his instruments as he desires
[43:20] is that right do you believe he's
[43:21] sovereign
[43:23] there's one thing god will not do is
[43:25] lead you off of his word
[43:28] but he can do whatever he wants to do in
[43:30] manifesting and completing that word in
[43:32] your life
[43:33] and he will do it through scars and
[43:35] trials and testings
[43:37] and and all these things he will bring
[43:39] about redemption in your life to show
[43:42] that it had nothing to do with you it
[43:45] has everything to do with him
[43:48] because without those scars and those
[43:50] trials and those tests he can't show
[43:51] character he
[43:52] won't pull out his character he has that
[43:55] in you does that with you to bring out
[43:57] his character
[43:58] and i'm a little ahead of myself here
[44:00] but i'll just
[44:01] just continue on here so god is calling
[44:04] for
[44:05] a complete surrender he's calling for a
[44:08] complete submission
[44:10] and yielding of your weaknesses to him
[44:14] of your weakness to him brother branham
[44:17] said if we have weakness
[44:19] we have strength
[44:24] if we have weakness we have strength all
[44:27] right
[44:29] philippians 3 14 if you'd stand with me
[44:32] take your bibles
[44:33] philippians 3 14.
[44:43] and then i want to go to second
[44:45] corinthians chapter 12
[44:48] in hebrews 11. philippians 3
[44:53] verse 14 and i think we'll begin reading
[44:58] well that's not the one i wanted
[45:01] yes it is i'm sorry yes
[45:11] let's start up here with verse 10 that i
[45:15] may know him
[45:16] and notice that's not that's a
[45:19] revelation that's revelation that i may
[45:21] know him
[45:22] and the power of his resurrection and
[45:25] the fellowship of his sufferings
[45:27] being made conformable unto his death
[45:30] if by any means i might attain unto the
[45:32] resurrection of the dead
[45:35] not as though i had already attained
[45:36] neither were already perfect
[45:38] but i follow after if that i may
[45:41] apprehend
[45:42] for that which also i am apprehended of
[45:44] christ jesus
[45:46] brethren i count not myself to have
[45:48] apprehended but this one thing i do
[45:50] forgetting those things which are in are
[45:52] behind or in the past as brother brown
[45:54] boys say
[45:55] forgetting those things which are behind
[45:58] amen and reaching forth unto those
[46:01] things which are before
[46:05] forgetting the things behind reaching
[46:07] forth unto those things which are before
[46:09] i press
[46:13] not just a casual walk but a walk of
[46:16] trials
[46:17] testings pressures persecutions
[46:23] everything goes into that in obtaining
[46:26] that goal you have to walk through every
[46:29] bit of it
[46:30] amen you say well if i made perfect why
[46:32] i would have to go through that because
[46:34] god wants to show redemption he wants to
[46:36] show his attributes of a savior
[46:38] a healer a deliverer amen
[46:42] that's all of what it's all about amen
[46:45] you wonder why i have the scars after
[46:46] this service i hope you quit
[46:48] you quit making your scars your excuses
[46:54] but making your uh your failures your
[46:57] excuses
[46:58] so i failed this i failed that we all
[47:01] failed something
[47:03] amen but god doesn't fail the prophet
[47:06] said that faith in you cannot fail
[47:10] the holy spirit in you cannot fail the
[47:13] revelation of the word cannot fail
[47:15] the revelation of jesus christ in you
[47:17] cannot fail
[47:20] who you really are cannot fail
[47:25] amen that's right all right so now
[47:28] i press toward the mark the mark the
[47:30] goal i press
[47:32] toward the mark or the goal for the
[47:34] prize
[47:36] the reward the prize are you expecting a
[47:39] reward
[47:40] yeah we are we say well i lord i you're
[47:43] the one and you know what we're gonna
[47:45] we're gonna bow before him and place
[47:46] those rewards right down at his feet
[47:48] again because without him we wouldn't
[47:50] have any reward
[47:52] he already purpose reward brought you
[47:54] through everything to give you the
[47:55] reward
[47:56] amen is that right he's the one that's
[47:58] done that every bit of it
[48:01] amen right so he loves to show himself
[48:05] and without without see right at the
[48:07] very beginning without abraham
[48:09] with i'm excuse me without uh adam
[48:12] falling he wouldn't be able to
[48:14] show his attributes amen
[48:17] but he can't lose what's himself
[48:22] amen that's right all right i pressed
[48:25] toward the mark
[48:26] the goal for the prize of
[48:29] the high calling of god in christ jesus
[48:34] amen of the high calling
[48:37] all right then i'd like you to go with
[48:39] me to second corinthians chapter 12.
[48:48] verse 9 and he said unto me my grace
[48:52] is sufficient for thee
[48:56] my grace is sufficient for thee is there
[48:59] any these here tonight
[49:02] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[49:05] strength is made perfect
[49:09] is made perfect in
[49:12] weakness paul said most gladly therefore
[49:16] will i rather
[49:17] glory in my infirmities not hate them
[49:22] not make excuses for them
[49:25] but glory in them
[49:29] now that's contrary to human he and you
[49:31] will not want to glorify
[49:32] every one of them through faith subdued
[49:35] kingdoms
[49:37] wrought righteousness obtain promises
[49:41] stop the mouths of lions quenched the
[49:44] violence of fire
[49:46] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[49:49] weakness
[49:50] were made strong
[49:54] waxed valiant in fight f-i-g-h-t
[49:59] turned to flight
[50:03] the armies of the aliens amen
[50:07] amen you may be seated
[50:13] jesus himself jesus as a man
[50:18] was and had to learn human
[50:22] weakness because the bible said
[50:26] the bible said that he let's just turn
[50:28] to it in hebrews 5 just the pages back
[50:31] if you still have hebrews open
[50:32] turn back here to hebrews 5
[50:37] and look here at this
[50:40] seventh verse who in the days of his
[50:43] flesh when he had offered up prayers and
[50:45] supplications with strong crying and
[50:47] tears
[50:48] unto him that was able to save him from
[50:50] death and was heard in that he feared
[50:53] though he were a son yet learned he
[50:56] obedience and you look that word up
[50:59] obedience that word obedience means
[51:01] submission learned he
[51:04] obedience or submission by the things
[51:07] which he
[51:08] suffered amen so he also
[51:13] could do nothing jesus said himself i in
[51:16] my own self
[51:17] can do nothing
[51:20] amen he was unless god showed him what
[51:23] to do
[51:24] unless god moved upon him what to do and
[51:26] the same thing applies to him every
[51:28] member of his
[51:29] body he could do nothing
[51:32] in himself
[51:36] amen all right so
[51:39] so he see we see here that and being
[51:42] perfect he became the author of eternal
[51:44] salvation unto all them that obey him
[51:47] and if he learned obedience or
[51:49] submission through what he suffered
[51:51] and become perfect
[51:54] then then there's none perfect but god
[51:57] and yet we are to be perfect as our
[51:58] father in heaven is perfect
[52:00] then we are going to learn the same
[52:02] thing
[52:04] amen through suffering through trials
[52:08] through scars through pressures
[52:12] amen and we can learn and realize these
[52:14] things are for
[52:15] our good because god has control over
[52:19] those things
[52:20] amen he's not going to bring anything
[52:22] upon you but what you can bear
[52:25] is that right he's not going to do
[52:27] anything but what has got to work
[52:29] together for your good
[52:32] period all things work together for good
[52:36] to them that love god to them that are
[52:38] the
[52:39] called according to his purpose he's
[52:42] going to work his purpose
[52:43] but he's sovereign and how he wants to
[52:45] work it
[52:48] scars trials has nothing to do
[52:51] with the seal that god's placed in you
[52:54] in him
[52:56] amen because when we enter into his rest
[52:59] amen we have ceased from our labors then
[53:02] let's
[53:03] let god have his way and when we face
[53:06] these things
[53:07] let's remember we have his word of
[53:09] promise
[53:11] to take a hold of and pass right on
[53:13] through it because his grace
[53:15] is sufficient amen
[53:19] amen if god allowed it brother brahm
[53:22] said god give me grace to go through it
[53:25] i'll hold steady with your word
[53:29] that's it amen the word alone
[53:32] not adding your reasoning not adding
[53:35] your feeling to it but the word alone
[53:38] take what the word said alone and stand
[53:40] on the word
[53:43] quit trying to put your opinion to it
[53:47] god don't need an opinion god's word is
[53:49] perfect okay
[53:50] brother branham said this and i'm going
[53:53] to quote a lot of things out of here
[53:54] because i i just don't know what else
[53:56] how else to do it
[53:58] but on the message perfect strength by
[54:00] perfect weakness
[54:03] he said the pastor and to the children
[54:06] all may we be able to lay ourselves
[54:08] aside
[54:08] on the altar of god and open our hearts
[54:11] and listen
[54:12] to the holy spirit as he'll speak to us
[54:14] and i say
[54:15] may that be so tonight i don't believe
[54:18] these things are just read by chance
[54:20] this is
[54:21] this is directed and he's going to speak
[54:23] directly to all of us
[54:25] are you willing to let him do that all
[54:27] right
[54:28] we try to make our weaknesses excuses
[54:34] we try to make our weaknesses excuses
[54:37] therefore so many there's so many of us
[54:40] likes to testify or likes to think
[54:42] we're insufficient and therefore we make
[54:44] that an excuse
[54:45] i have no education i have no ability
[54:47] i'm not able to do this
[54:49] if you keep that up and do it in that
[54:51] way keep going
[54:52] like that then you can't amount to
[54:54] anything
[54:55] but the very thing that we make excuses
[54:58] by our weaknesses
[54:59] god uses the very thing to tackle the
[55:01] job with
[55:03] see he waits for us to get to that
[55:06] condition
[55:09] he waits for us and and there's points
[55:11] here i want to make out
[55:12] as i come to him i want to stress those
[55:15] areas
[55:15] he he waits for us to get to that
[55:18] condition
[55:19] so that he can use this
[55:24] all right well i i'm not i can't do this
[55:30] i'm insufficient i can't do it and god
[55:33] takes the very
[55:34] thing to do the job with that's true
[55:37] that's the reason why he
[55:40] chose us
[55:45] what what did he choose how did he why
[55:47] did why did he choose us
[55:48] because we're in the condition of
[55:52] weakness amen i've got a scripture we
[55:56] got a scripture on it god
[55:57] the prophet the bible said he chose the
[55:59] weak things
[56:01] amen amen are you with me he chose them
[56:04] he knew that before the foundation of
[56:06] the world
[56:09] okay so he said the reason he cho
[56:12] that's the reason that he chose us
[56:14] because we're in that condition
[56:16] now that sounds strange he said but
[56:19] we'll
[56:19] we'll find a few minutes get the reason
[56:21] of god willing
[56:23] weakness and rejections
[56:26] we find that those people who are the
[56:28] weakest and the rejected by
[56:30] the outside world is god's heroes
[56:37] amen that conquer up in the front line
[56:41] they're the conquering ones why because
[56:43] they're not depending on themselves
[56:48] i can't depend on myself myself will
[56:52] trick myself
[56:55] the greatest enemy i've got we'll find
[56:57] where brother brown says the same thing
[56:58] but the greatest enemy i've got is david
[57:00] dean heart
[57:01] you put your name in
[57:04] amen but the beauty of it is
[57:07] the greatest enemy i've got is defeated
[57:16] then we ought to reckon him defeated
[57:21] amen are you with me amen all right
[57:26] we ought to reckon the bible said reckon
[57:27] ourselves dead indeed unto sin
[57:30] all right now so
[57:34] he said the weakness he said if god be
[57:37] willing that he said
[57:38] god's heroes that conquer up in the
[57:40] front line it takes those who feel
[57:42] themselves
[57:43] unworthy oh how the devil jumps on that
[57:48] you ever have the devil jump on that
[57:50] when you felt like you're just unworthy
[57:51] you just
[57:52] why you must not be anything you'd be
[57:54] this and that
[57:55] way watch him turn that around
[58:00] amen then if you start knowing you're
[58:02] unworthy
[58:03] and no you can't do it start depending
[58:04] on god watch the devil fight that
[58:07] well you did this you did that you can't
[58:09] be you can't be a christian
[58:14] all right now we just received the
[58:18] if there's a minister's come to him and
[58:20] brother brown refers to this i'm trying
[58:21] to cut
[58:22] these down as much as we can we just
[58:24] received the holy ghost shall we now
[58:25] seek for gifts for our ministry
[58:28] the prophet said don't you do it let it
[58:30] alone
[58:33] amen well i just read in the book they
[58:35] said the brothers book told us after we
[58:37] received the holy ghost we should seek
[58:39] gifts
[58:39] to use the holy ghost
[58:43] i said and become a stuffed shirt
[58:47] if you'll notice in the bible it's
[58:48] always those who who are trying to get
[58:50] away from that
[58:54] that god uses
[58:57] as long as a man wants to do something
[58:59] and thinks he's got enough ability
[59:01] he can put the job over
[59:05] god could never use that man
[59:12] as long as a man thinks he can has the
[59:14] ability and can put the job over
[59:15] god will never use that man
[59:19] that thinks he can do it
[59:22] he's got to realize he can't do it
[59:26] you cannot truly surrender yourself to
[59:28] god until you come to that place
[59:38] all right so he says here
[59:42] i said
[59:46] look he said look at the man running
[59:48] look god could never use that man look
[59:50] at moses running look at paul running
[59:52] and the rest i'm trying to get away from
[59:54] it
[59:55] yeah moses ran out of the wilderness to
[59:57] get away from it he failed
[59:59] well my failure my goodness assad said
[1:00:01] that's just what i wanted to do
[1:00:04] so i could get him cured up
[1:00:08] teach him some weakness he was a scholar
[1:00:11] man next pharaoh talk about depending on
[1:00:15] your strength
[1:00:19] if anybody had strength to depend on it
[1:00:21] would have been moses and paul
[1:00:24] is that right in the scriptures but they
[1:00:27] forgot they had that they had to be
[1:00:29] they had to be uh whipped out
[1:00:35] they had to find they found themselves
[1:00:36] in the dust
[1:00:38] they had to learn human weakness
[1:00:44] and so he said
[1:00:47] i said don't seek nothing god's got
[1:00:49] anything for you
[1:00:51] he'll give it to you look how simple
[1:00:56] if god's got anything for you he'll give
[1:00:58] it to you
[1:00:59] and just let him take care of that
[1:01:04] just let him take care of it i said then
[1:01:07] you get some of these times like we got
[1:01:09] have today that everybody's wanting to
[1:01:10] do this and that and become some great
[1:01:12] person
[1:01:13] look what we got is into with it you see
[1:01:16] instead of trying to be great we ought
[1:01:18] to be trying to find out how little we
[1:01:20] can get
[1:01:22] my my mind isn't that lovely
[1:01:26] you know i think it's lovely because
[1:01:30] god can express himself that's my desire
[1:01:34] personally i want him to express himself
[1:01:38] to the hour and the time and the message
[1:01:40] of the hour let me become that
[1:01:41] manifestation
[1:01:44] i sure can't do it by depending on
[1:01:46] myself i have nothing to depend on
[1:01:49] but i can he can do it and he will do it
[1:01:52] and he promised to do it
[1:01:55] you want to remember that nobody can
[1:01:57] take your position
[1:01:58] in the body of christ i'm speaking to
[1:02:01] believers tonight i'm not speaking to
[1:02:02] just
[1:02:04] people i'm speaking to believers bride
[1:02:09] nobody's going to take your position
[1:02:11] there's not enough devils in hell can
[1:02:12] knock you out of your position
[1:02:14] it may look like nothing to you but it's
[1:02:16] great in god's sight there's no such
[1:02:18] thing as big and little in god's sight
[1:02:20] because it's all himself working now you
[1:02:23] tell me how you can chop up god big and
[1:02:25] little
[1:02:26] you can't do it all right so
[1:02:33] i said just see how little you can get
[1:02:36] then god
[1:02:37] can use you
[1:02:40] now listen to what the it's like i said
[1:02:42] a gift is not something you take
[1:02:45] like a knife you want to cut this with
[1:02:48] it you can cut it or you can cut this
[1:02:50] you can cut it cut that or whatever you
[1:02:52] want to
[1:02:52] that's not a gift of god see
[1:02:56] no that's not a gift of god he says
[1:03:00] it's like i said uh no i said excuse me
[1:03:04] a gift of god is some way you have of
[1:03:06] getting yourself
[1:03:07] out of the way and gifts and callings
[1:03:10] are predestinated
[1:03:11] predestin are the predestination of god
[1:03:13] gifts and callings are with
[1:03:15] are even without repentance so you're
[1:03:18] not saved by a gift
[1:03:21] because i minister the word i'm not
[1:03:22] saved by ministry
[1:03:25] i have a choice to minister not a
[1:03:27] minister and god showed me will be unto
[1:03:29] me if i don't
[1:03:31] so i have a choice though i can do so or
[1:03:34] i don't have to do so and if i
[1:03:36] choose not to do so a dispensation of
[1:03:38] the gospel that i would have ministered
[1:03:39] to is going to be held against me
[1:03:43] and be counted to my hand so see we got
[1:03:46] a choice and i say but god
[1:03:48] it's your gift now watch what the
[1:03:49] prophet continues to say and it's the
[1:03:51] way with everyone
[1:03:52] ministry i'm talking about but also
[1:03:56] as a member of the body now watch this
[1:03:58] he said
[1:03:59] he said you are born with it
[1:04:03] give some calling without repent you are
[1:04:04] born with it a little gear you pull
[1:04:06] yourself over in but you cannot step on
[1:04:09] the pedal
[1:04:14] anybody's minister very long knows they
[1:04:15] can't step on the pedal
[1:04:18] but somehow when you get up here giving
[1:04:19] yourself to god god steps on the pedal
[1:04:23] and you say things you didn't even think
[1:04:24] you would say
[1:04:27] and it flows right together okay
[1:04:31] but watch he said a little gear you pull
[1:04:33] yourself but you cannot step on the
[1:04:35] pedal
[1:04:35] god has to operate it
[1:04:38] you have to get yourself out of the way
[1:04:41] you do not pump it up pull it up
[1:04:43] join it go into something to learn how
[1:04:47] to use it
[1:04:49] you don't learn how to use god you don't
[1:04:52] learn
[1:04:54] as when you begin to learn how to do
[1:04:57] something
[1:04:58] and say god here's something i learned i
[1:05:00] know i can use it for your glory he has
[1:05:02] no
[1:05:02] you ha he will not be able to use that
[1:05:05] ability
[1:05:06] you're out of the will of god doing it
[1:05:12] amen you watch what the prophet said i
[1:05:15] believe the prophet said okay then
[1:05:16] listen
[1:05:16] listen carefully tonight all right
[1:05:20] now you can't pump it up join it you
[1:05:23] can't learn how to use it
[1:05:25] they tell you how to use it there in
[1:05:27] some seminary school well you have to
[1:05:29] receive the holy
[1:05:30] well yeah well you if you have received
[1:05:32] the holy spirit we believe that but you
[1:05:34] you do it this way but you see there's
[1:05:37] no control of it
[1:05:41] you see psychology only deals in one
[1:05:44] facet of your being
[1:05:47] it's the intellectual side it's not the
[1:05:50] soul realm
[1:05:53] all right because there's only one thing
[1:05:56] that's going to deal and deliver you in
[1:05:58] the soul realm and that's the word of
[1:05:59] god
[1:06:01] for the season by revelation
[1:06:05] that's all amen
[1:06:10] you can't do nothing you try to do
[1:06:11] something in your own self
[1:06:13] it won't work or it may look like it
[1:06:15] works but it won't be amount to anything
[1:06:18] by faith they did this by faith by faith
[1:06:21] by faith by faith by faith every bit of
[1:06:23] it was by faith
[1:06:25] your confession should be by faith amen
[1:06:30] okay all right now
[1:06:34] he said god has to operate it okay
[1:06:39] he said but you see you have no control
[1:06:42] over it
[1:06:43] you don't use the holy spirit
[1:06:52] you don't use the holy spirit the holy
[1:06:56] spirit uses you
[1:07:01] amen the holy spirit uses you see you're
[1:07:04] not you're not to use the holy spirit
[1:07:06] you're not to use the holy spirit
[1:07:08] the holy spirit's got you a gift is not
[1:07:11] something you take like a knife and a
[1:07:13] sharp and pencil with it
[1:07:14] it's yielding yourself to god getting
[1:07:16] yourself out of the way so they let the
[1:07:18] holy spirit use you
[1:07:19] and if he uses you it'll be with the
[1:07:22] word
[1:07:24] and if you can't discern what's with the
[1:07:26] word or not you need the holy spirit
[1:07:30] all right amen
[1:07:34] all right now
[1:07:39] a gift is not something you take okay
[1:07:42] see
[1:07:42] it's like a knife it's yielding yourself
[1:07:45] to god getting yourself out of the way
[1:07:47] so the holy spirit can use you now
[1:07:48] i just thought i'd drop that in now
[1:07:50] let's continue on here
[1:07:52] on this message those are other messages
[1:07:55] he spoke that in but this coming back to
[1:07:56] perfect strength and perfect weakness
[1:07:58] notice that it takes the weakest it
[1:08:01] takes
[1:08:02] notice he said it takes the weakest and
[1:08:04] rejected and practically every hero god
[1:08:06] ever had in the front line
[1:08:08] was that type of person
[1:08:13] a person that was rejected a person that
[1:08:15] thought he was
[1:08:16] insufficient a person that had no
[1:08:18] ability at all
[1:08:21] then that's just that's the person just
[1:08:23] in good shape so god can start using
[1:08:25] them
[1:08:26] that's right when they feel like they
[1:08:28] can't they haven't got nothing
[1:08:30] that's when god can take a hold of them
[1:08:32] and do something with them
[1:08:34] but when we are thinking but when we are
[1:08:37] thinking
[1:08:38] now watch that word thinking
[1:08:41] but when we are thinking that we're able
[1:08:43] to do it then god can't use
[1:08:45] us because we are wanting to do it
[1:08:50] i think this is timely all right
[1:08:53] even though it's brought out a little
[1:08:55] different maybe you're used to
[1:08:57] but it's just lessons here tonight and
[1:08:59] god wanted you to sit here and hear it
[1:09:04] i don't mean to be out harsh but i'm
[1:09:06] that positive all right
[1:09:09] now
[1:09:14] he said because we're wanting to do it
[1:09:17] i've worked out the next word
[1:09:18] ourselves first corinthians
[1:09:23] chapter one let's go over there just a
[1:09:25] moment
[1:09:27] first corinthians 1 chapter 1
[1:09:31] and verse 20
[1:09:36] 26 for you see your calling brother and
[1:09:40] how that not many wise men
[1:09:42] after the flesh
[1:09:46] not not not many dd ldds and this and
[1:09:49] that and somebody just studied and said
[1:09:51] this is the way to bring the spirit
[1:09:53] under
[1:09:53] under control nonsense there's only one
[1:09:55] way to bring the spirit under control
[1:10:00] that's by the power and revelation of
[1:10:03] the word
[1:10:05] amen by the spirit of god all right
[1:10:11] but god he said for you see your calling
[1:10:13] brother not many wise men after the
[1:10:15] flesh not many mighty men not many noble
[1:10:17] are called
[1:10:19] but god hath chosen the foolish things
[1:10:21] of the world
[1:10:23] to confound the wise god hath
[1:10:26] chosen the weak things of the world
[1:10:31] to confound the things which are mighty
[1:10:34] and the base things of the world and
[1:10:36] things which are despised have god
[1:10:38] chosen yea
[1:10:39] and things which are not to bring to not
[1:10:42] things that
[1:10:42] are that no flesh
[1:10:46] shall glory in his presence
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:53] amen and he says now
[1:10:56] on the other side we get these feelings
[1:10:59] we think that we're insufficient we
[1:11:00] don't want to do it
[1:11:01] but if we just listen to the call of god
[1:11:04] that's the very thing god
[1:11:05] wants us to get into that kind of a
[1:11:08] shape
[1:11:09] so he can
[1:11:13] oh my amen
[1:11:16] god's working on me god is working on me
[1:11:20] to make me what i ought to be what what
[1:11:22] how what am i ought to be
[1:11:24] himself made manifest in flesh
[1:11:29] amen all right he said
[1:11:33] we when we are insufficient ourselves
[1:11:37] watch this quote i love this when we are
[1:11:40] insuffic anybody insufficient yourself
[1:11:44] okay that's wonderful see he loves to
[1:11:46] hear you confess it
[1:11:48] [Laughter]
[1:11:50] that's right when we are insufficient
[1:11:52] ourselves and we are subjects to yield
[1:11:54] to
[1:11:55] god's spirit my
[1:11:59] amen when we are insufficient ourselves
[1:12:01] we are subjects to yield to god's spirit
[1:12:04] as long as we think that we can do it
[1:12:07] then we can't do it but when we get to a
[1:12:10] place where we
[1:12:11] know no we can't do it then we yield
[1:12:15] ourselves to god
[1:12:16] and he does it
[1:12:20] amen remember god does not use educated
[1:12:24] theology
[1:12:25] and man's uh wisdom and
[1:12:29] and the ability of human men
[1:12:35] he can't use it
[1:12:39] amen now that audit that ought to shake
[1:12:42] some people to the roots
[1:12:43] because it's upsetting their very
[1:12:45] thought
[1:12:49] because it upsets denominationalism it
[1:12:51] upsets the spirit of denominationalism
[1:12:56] it upsets that female dominating spirit
[1:13:02] ever learning never able to come to the
[1:13:04] knowledge of the truth
[1:13:09] uh-huh you see what i'm saying all right
[1:13:13] all right now now
[1:13:17] then if it then if it's us trying to do
[1:13:20] it
[1:13:20] we'll fail but if we'll just yield
[1:13:23] ourself to god then god
[1:13:25] can't fail there's one thing god cannot
[1:13:29] do did you know there's something god
[1:13:31] cannot do how about young people did you
[1:13:32] know there's something god can't not do
[1:13:35] you say do all things oh there's
[1:13:36] something he cannot do
[1:13:39] that's fail
[1:13:43] and god is the word
[1:13:46] now which side would you rather be on
[1:13:48] his or yours
[1:13:53] he's given you opportunity to receive
[1:13:55] him
[1:13:56] so which side would you rather be on his
[1:13:59] or yours
[1:14:00] yours is failed yours has already failed
[1:14:08] his never did fail can't fail never will
[1:14:12] fail
[1:14:14] amen that's right and he's invited you
[1:14:17] to come through the blood
[1:14:20] amen you feel that tug in you then yield
[1:14:23] to it
[1:14:26] amen yield to that pull yield to that
[1:14:28] tug
[1:14:29] i want jesus christ but what will my
[1:14:31] friends think
[1:14:32] die to your friends die to what they
[1:14:36] think
[1:14:38] what difference does it make what they
[1:14:40] think are you going to allow them
[1:14:42] to keep you out of the kingdom
[1:14:46] amen you have everything at your
[1:14:49] disposal
[1:14:49] draw an eye to god draw night to him and
[1:14:52] hide
[1:14:53] just draw nigh to him through the bible
[1:14:54] draw nigh to him through the message of
[1:14:56] the hour
[1:14:57] you get to business individually with
[1:14:59] god yourself
[1:15:03] amen you're not too young to get to
[1:15:05] business with god
[1:15:07] start feeding on his word start asking
[1:15:09] god to reveal his word to you
[1:15:11] personally reveal himself in you
[1:15:13] personally
[1:15:15] he wants you to ask him
[1:15:23] he's given you the way out
[1:15:27] he's given you the way out of this chaos
[1:15:29] and into his presence
[1:15:33] amen personally personally
[1:15:36] he's caring about you personally
[1:15:41] okay now
[1:15:44] so long as we're trying in ourselves
[1:15:48] the only thing see all we're trying
[1:15:50] ourselves and depending on our own
[1:15:51] abilities and so forth
[1:15:53] we'll do nothing
[1:15:56] but when we get to a place where we know
[1:15:59] we're nothing
[1:16:01] that's the great thing when we get to a
[1:16:03] place where we know
[1:16:05] we're nothing
[1:16:08] we don't focus on the things we don't
[1:16:10] focus on nothing
[1:16:12] we focus on something
[1:16:16] why focus on nothing when you can focus
[1:16:18] on something
[1:16:21] a real so therefore though for
[1:16:24] therefore we are not focusing on the
[1:16:26] things which are
[1:16:27] are temporal
[1:16:31] but on the things eternal the eternal's
[1:16:34] more real than the temporal
[1:16:36] did you know that the things unseen
[1:16:38] which is the eternal is more real than
[1:16:40] the things that are seen
[1:16:42] where is your focus today today tonight
[1:16:46] where's your focus where's your desire
[1:16:50] laying
[1:16:50] on what you see and whether whatever
[1:16:53] others
[1:16:54] that you think they see in you
[1:17:00] our dwelling our focus is not on human
[1:17:04] it's on eternal word it's not on the
[1:17:08] on the outer man it's on the eternal
[1:17:11] word
[1:17:12] of the inner man it's upon
[1:17:15] christ himself that's more real because
[1:17:18] everything that you see
[1:17:19] came from a creation from an eternal
[1:17:25] so what's more real the eternal
[1:17:29] or the things you see that are passing
[1:17:34] amen amen all right
[1:17:40] my absolute my absolute
[1:17:43] isn't upon the the the temporal
[1:17:46] my absolute is on the eternal
[1:17:51] what's real is his revelation of himself
[1:17:54] in me
[1:17:55] it in you that you're where your trust
[1:17:58] is
[1:18:00] amen right all right now
[1:18:04] okay now i'm gonna as long as you're
[1:18:07] trying in yourselves and depending on
[1:18:09] your own abilities and so forth
[1:18:11] you'll do nothing but when you get who
[1:18:14] you say well brother david
[1:18:15] ah well what do you mean nothing in
[1:18:17] whose eyes are we measuring this uh by
[1:18:20] it's measured by god's sight it's
[1:18:22] measured by his word
[1:18:23] you're doing nothing you may say i've
[1:18:25] got all kinds of people following it
[1:18:27] look at the crowds
[1:18:28] look at the numbers but you're doing
[1:18:30] nothing
[1:18:34] amen based on what the word
[1:18:38] based on what he sees
[1:18:45] amen it isn't based on your judgment
[1:18:48] isn't based
[1:18:49] why you can stir all kinds of people
[1:18:50] through all kinds of ways
[1:18:52] have an emotional up why they can just
[1:18:55] gather around emotionally but you've
[1:18:56] done nothing
[1:18:57] outside of the word of god you've done
[1:19:00] nothing
[1:19:01] outside of god portraying himself
[1:19:04] through you
[1:19:05] by revelation and you and taking you
[1:19:08] aside and killing
[1:19:09] you first and then filling you
[1:19:12] you're doing nothing
[1:19:17] it's a killing first in fact every day
[1:19:20] it's a killing
[1:19:22] to see god manifest jesus himself said
[1:19:25] you must deny
[1:19:26] yourself take up your cross
[1:19:31] and follow me
[1:19:34] who is he the word
[1:19:37] for the hour the word of a prophet
[1:19:41] the word of this bible you never can
[1:19:44] prove anything the prophet
[1:19:46] brought us that contrary this bible
[1:19:49] in fact if the prophet didn't bring it
[1:19:51] you wouldn't know what was in this bible
[1:19:52] for this day
[1:19:54] because god has a channel to bring his
[1:19:56] word through
[1:19:57] and that he would do through a prophet
[1:20:00] it's not following a man it's following
[1:20:02] god's ordained
[1:20:04] way
[1:20:08] see god can do anything he wants that's
[1:20:10] right but when he sets a pattern
[1:20:12] he doesn't move from it when he sets a a
[1:20:15] pro
[1:20:15] when he has when he sets a preeminence
[1:20:17] he doesn't move from it
[1:20:18] and in the beginning he showed us that
[1:20:20] revelation made the difference between
[1:20:22] cain and abel
[1:20:23] revelation was the difference and
[1:20:25] revelation is what he accepted
[1:20:27] then how we gonna get in the other way
[1:20:33] amen that's right it's exactly right
[1:20:37] amen so the important thing
[1:20:40] now watch but when we get to the place
[1:20:42] we know we're nothing we get to the
[1:20:44] place when we know we're nothing then
[1:20:45] god can use us
[1:20:46] the important thing here's an important
[1:20:50] thing he said one of the most
[1:20:52] important things we must master he said
[1:20:58] now remember this and especially you
[1:21:01] young preachers
[1:21:02] and lay members alike and that included
[1:21:04] me because i was once a young preacher
[1:21:06] also
[1:21:09] and i read that same quote for years
[1:21:12] but i love this message don't you i just
[1:21:15] love it because why
[1:21:16] it just keeps opening
[1:21:19] what is it the opening of the sun where
[1:21:22] is it rising
[1:21:23] in me in you
[1:21:32] brother branham said it is the rising of
[1:21:34] the sun
[1:21:36] in fact he turned right around and said
[1:21:38] and the sun is up
[1:21:40] think of that then where do we see it
[1:21:44] rising
[1:21:49] amen amen amen it's called an invisible
[1:21:52] union
[1:21:53] all right that's not i'll just pull off
[1:21:54] of that but by that union the bride is
[1:21:57] positionally placed
[1:22:01] okay
[1:22:05] the important thing you young preachers
[1:22:07] and lay members alike there's one thing
[1:22:09] you've got to master
[1:22:10] if you expect to fulfill god's desire in
[1:22:13] your life
[1:22:14] that is we have to master the thought
[1:22:21] of human ability
[1:22:26] amen amen amen god help us all
[1:22:30] to master that thought of human ability
[1:22:37] amen oh my
[1:22:41] all right if we ever get to a spot where
[1:22:44] we think we can do it with our own
[1:22:48] intelligence and our own ability
[1:22:50] something you've learned
[1:22:51] we've got to master that in such a way
[1:22:53] that we can get rid of that thing
[1:22:55] and lay it aside so that god can use us
[1:22:59] that's right
[1:23:02] amen amen
[1:23:09] and conjunction and
[1:23:14] tying these two together and make a
[1:23:16] complete surrender
[1:23:20] cannot use one ability we've got to make
[1:23:24] a complete surrender
[1:23:25] and come to god you've got to surrender
[1:23:28] to him both
[1:23:28] soul body spirit everything that you
[1:23:33] are has to be surrendered to god in
[1:23:36] order that he can work his will
[1:23:38] in you and me brother david you're
[1:23:40] making emphasis
[1:23:41] absolutely that's the key
[1:23:46] amen and then if i must press
[1:23:49] and i will press and i will press in
[1:23:53] that right there to the high calling to
[1:23:56] the prize of it
[1:23:59] amen i want to see that measure of what
[1:24:02] god called me to do
[1:24:03] fulfilled in my life by his power
[1:24:06] i have no other desire amen
[1:24:10] that's right that is the absolute desire
[1:24:13] let me completely absolutely yield
[1:24:16] and surrender and submit everything and
[1:24:19] then rest in it because i know you're in
[1:24:21] me
[1:24:21] and you've accepted the obligation
[1:24:25] i'm giving you full headship and
[1:24:27] responsibility
[1:24:29] and then don't fret over it when it
[1:24:30] doesn't go the way you think it should
[1:24:35] that's right and quit your murmuring
[1:24:37] about it
[1:24:40] because if you know god's in you he's
[1:24:42] got to lead you if you give
[1:24:44] yourself to him he'll take it
[1:24:47] then he's going to do things that's
[1:24:48] going to absolutely be radical to your
[1:24:50] own thinking
[1:24:51] man's thinking david's thinking he's
[1:24:53] going to do things that's absolutely
[1:24:54] going to be
[1:24:55] opposite way you think and reason it
[1:24:57] should be
[1:24:58] but when you're certain of god he's
[1:25:01] going to guide you and lead you and
[1:25:02] it'll come out just right
[1:25:09] now we can come into that thought of
[1:25:12] of that thought of uh considering your
[1:25:16] ways
[1:25:18] because in haggai
[1:25:22] he said consider your ways you're going
[1:25:25] out here making a living and putting it
[1:25:27] in bags with holes
[1:25:28] you're doing this you're sowing and
[1:25:30] reaping little and all these things and
[1:25:31] the reason why because you've got your
[1:25:33] focus wrong
[1:25:35] you should be focusing on building the
[1:25:37] body
[1:25:38] the temple the house and the and the
[1:25:41] word of god for the hour and take your
[1:25:43] focus on that instead if you put it back
[1:25:45] in your sealed houses
[1:25:46] and your businesses and everything else
[1:25:48] comes into place
[1:25:50] instead of the word the word takes
[1:25:51] second place and it should
[1:25:53] be first
[1:25:58] hebrews matthew 6 33 said seek ye first
[1:26:02] not last give god the first of your day
[1:26:06] give god the best of your day give god
[1:26:08] the everything
[1:26:08] first prayer first
[1:26:14] amen get up a little earlier
[1:26:17] if you can't do it at night do it in the
[1:26:19] morning
[1:26:21] giving the first part of your day oh i
[1:26:23] said but i gotta have my beauty rest
[1:26:25] no you just think you do give him an
[1:26:27] hour give him a half hour
[1:26:30] give it to him and you'll find out your
[1:26:31] day will go different than it did
[1:26:32] yesterday
[1:26:34] give him that first place
[1:26:37] i don't care how pressed you are to get
[1:26:39] something done i learned that a long
[1:26:41] time ago
[1:26:42] when i felt so pressed i got to do this
[1:26:44] and if i give god that time
[1:26:45] i'll never get it done well i didn't get
[1:26:47] it done but when i gave god the time and
[1:26:50] giving the place and the first place in
[1:26:51] my life
[1:26:52] everything got done in his order in time
[1:26:55] and i wrote more business i did
[1:26:56] everything better
[1:27:00] that's when i was the insurance business
[1:27:02] what about when you're a pastor
[1:27:03] same thing
[1:27:09] take time you say i don't have time take
[1:27:11] it redeem it
[1:27:16] and quit your fearing about the other
[1:27:18] because when you seek first the kingdom
[1:27:20] of god and his righteousness which is
[1:27:22] his will
[1:27:22] which is his word
[1:27:26] amen then what's going to happen all
[1:27:28] these other things are going to be added
[1:27:30] to you
[1:27:36] get our focus right and the and the
[1:27:40] holes will start closing up
[1:27:44] putting first in your finances put him
[1:27:46] first in the tithing putting first in
[1:27:48] everything you do
[1:27:48] everything let god be first
[1:27:52] let his word be first let his will be
[1:27:54] first and i guarantee you
[1:27:56] that everything else will fall in its
[1:27:59] place and you will be provided
[1:28:01] everything
[1:28:01] will be right not whether you think it
[1:28:04] is but his word his word will be right
[1:28:06] his ways are right
[1:28:07] his ways are perfect all that god does
[1:28:10] is perfect
[1:28:11] and he said he made your way perfect
[1:28:16] that's what he said god's ways are
[1:28:19] perfect
[1:28:20] and you being in him have to be perfect
[1:28:23] he said he made your way perfect
[1:28:26] and perfect included scars
[1:28:28] misunderstandings persecution
[1:28:33] what are you doing perfecting the flesh
[1:28:35] or perfecting the inner man
[1:28:37] who's growing up here who's taking the
[1:28:41] body change
[1:28:42] who's who's going to come who's going to
[1:28:44] come to the point
[1:28:45] where he's going to come out of this
[1:28:46] whole body what's going to produce it
[1:28:51] amen all right now
[1:28:54] i'll hurry i still have a little bit of
[1:28:57] time
[1:28:58] okay and make a complete surrender now i
[1:29:02] know it's hard
[1:29:03] brother bram said i know it's hard why
[1:29:05] because it goes contrary
[1:29:07] to your human nature it goes contrary to
[1:29:11] the way
[1:29:11] even to you know genetically well my
[1:29:14] mother did this and i'm strong in that
[1:29:16] i just forget that
[1:29:19] die to it if it's not the will of god
[1:29:22] die to it
[1:29:23] if it's contrary to the word
[1:29:26] and keep it under obedience
[1:29:29] you know satan got a punch coming at you
[1:29:31] you know that
[1:29:32] what would you rather that punch me
[1:29:34] nervousness or arthritic or something
[1:29:36] said he said satan got a place to punch
[1:29:39] at you
[1:29:40] a weak place i think i just lost the
[1:29:42] knife
[1:29:43] got a weak place but he said that's the
[1:29:47] place you have to keep covered
[1:29:50] amen you and i both have that i know
[1:29:53] where that
[1:29:54] is hello
[1:30:00] are you there i'm there all right
[1:30:06] i know we're always wanting to put a
[1:30:07] part in something that you know
[1:30:10] that we know that we want to do it we'll
[1:30:13] say well i just
[1:30:14] i just know it should be done this way
[1:30:21] kind of hits the core doesn't it
[1:30:24] of all of us some of us to a greater
[1:30:27] degree than others
[1:30:29] and i just know it has to be this way
[1:30:31] because i'm first born
[1:30:36] i speak for my wife too
[1:30:40] because she's first born and we have a
[1:30:44] happy time together
[1:30:46] 50 years of happy time by the grace of
[1:30:48] god
[1:30:51] it sharpened us
[1:30:55] stone sharpeneth what's hot that steals
[1:30:58] iron sharpened with iron
[1:31:02] i'm glad she lost her iron disposition
[1:31:05] and i'm losing mine
[1:31:11] thank god i can look both of us and say
[1:31:13] we've lost it
[1:31:15] by the grace of god amen
[1:31:18] amen but you know moses had to be
[1:31:21] tempered by a wife too
[1:31:24] brother brown said she was hot tempered
[1:31:27] and he learned
[1:31:28] some weakness god knows how to give it
[1:31:32] to you
[1:31:32] to bring out his character to get you
[1:31:35] the point where someday you'll look back
[1:31:37] and say
[1:31:37] thank you lord for every one of those
[1:31:39] times how many times through the years
[1:31:41] we prayed this and this i don't know why
[1:31:43] this happy lord i don't know why it's
[1:31:44] happening i just don't
[1:31:46] all of a sudden he shows you that was me
[1:31:48] all the time molding you
[1:31:50] shaping you bringing out what i wanted
[1:31:52] to bring out
[1:31:53] i had you go through this in your church
[1:31:55] i had you to leave i had to do this i
[1:31:57] had to scar you and scar you
[1:31:59] and scar you and scar you by think
[1:32:01] people said they didn't say shoulda said
[1:32:03] everything else you haven't been in the
[1:32:06] pastor too long and not know that
[1:32:09] scarred why but it's god
[1:32:12] molding you bringing you to the position
[1:32:15] and place where you need to be
[1:32:22] so quit making excuses for your scars
[1:32:27] that's right look upon them differently
[1:32:30] quit hating them
[1:32:31] look and say god you had control over
[1:32:33] every bit of it look where i am today i
[1:32:35] didn't leave your word by your power i
[1:32:37] didn't leave it
[1:32:39] it didn't put me under it just let me
[1:32:42] dig a little further
[1:32:43] it just kept bringing out the character
[1:32:44] was inside of me you wanted to mold me
[1:32:46] in
[1:32:47] that's right and he's still working on
[1:32:49] me
[1:32:52] he's not perfecting this he's perfecting
[1:32:54] that inside that perfects this will
[1:32:56] change it
[1:32:59] all right let me go this little flower
[1:33:02] further here
[1:33:04] now that's hard i know we're wanting to
[1:33:05] put our part in something we know
[1:33:07] something we want to do
[1:33:08] god cannot use your ability but as long
[1:33:11] as you're doing it the way
[1:33:12] it that doing it that way is going to be
[1:33:15] wrong
[1:33:16] i just know i know that has to be done
[1:33:18] this way but it'll be wrong god will
[1:33:19] never use that effort
[1:33:21] maybe with the help of the lord we're
[1:33:22] going to get into that in a few minutes
[1:33:23] and just show you god cannot use your
[1:33:25] ability
[1:33:28] amen
[1:33:31] that's what's the matter with the world
[1:33:32] today there's too
[1:33:34] much seminary experiences in the message
[1:33:42] i put that in there that was injected
[1:33:45] for emphasis
[1:33:47] all right too much placed upon education
[1:33:50] too much placed upon relationships or
[1:33:52] fellowships in denomination
[1:33:57] a system an order of doing something
[1:34:00] all right he said and making it a group
[1:34:04] affair instead of an individual affair
[1:34:09] we rest on one another we rest upon men
[1:34:12] with ability
[1:34:15] the bible said how can you have faith
[1:34:17] when you're preferring one another
[1:34:20] well this guy's a great person look what
[1:34:21] he's done why he's been with the prophet
[1:34:23] talked with the prophet hung with the
[1:34:24] prophet why he ought to know what he's
[1:34:26] doing and he built a church and this and
[1:34:27] that and something else
[1:34:28] and he's passing money out everywhere
[1:34:30] building land and properties and not
[1:34:31] giving them the message
[1:34:36] what's wrong is he lacks revelation
[1:34:41] and they put their confidence in men
[1:34:46] and lets the man fail
[1:34:49] and still the people don't get it that's
[1:34:52] right
[1:34:53] all right now
[1:34:57] well we'll just lean we'll displease
[1:35:00] with you must lean upon god and god
[1:35:02] alone we mustn't trust the ability of
[1:35:04] ourselves
[1:35:12] we must not trust the ability of
[1:35:13] ourselves
[1:35:17] or any man
[1:35:21] we must completely yield to god
[1:35:27] no ability i don't care whose it is will
[1:35:29] never be usable in the sight of god
[1:35:31] god has to get all our abilities out of
[1:35:34] us
[1:35:34] before he can achieve his purpose if
[1:35:37] he's got something for us to do as long
[1:35:39] as we feel that we're doing a pretty
[1:35:40] good job of it then we'll never be able
[1:35:42] to be used of god
[1:35:47] we tried to do it in human ability
[1:35:51] if every person that professes to be a
[1:35:53] christian will forget his own ability
[1:35:55] and yield himself to god then god can
[1:35:58] achieve his purpose
[1:35:59] by sending not a revival but brother
[1:36:01] what he needs to first send is a killing
[1:36:04] that's right so we can revive you have
[1:36:07] to die
[1:36:07] before you can be born again you have to
[1:36:10] he needs a killing
[1:36:11] it need he we need a killing of
[1:36:12] ourselves the tabernacle needs a killing
[1:36:14] brother abraham says and me
[1:36:16] with it all of us we need a killing
[1:36:20] so that we can revive be revived in a
[1:36:23] new life a new
[1:36:24] hold a new hope a new experience we must
[1:36:27] get away from that human ability
[1:36:29] we've got to get to a place where we can
[1:36:31] surrender our souls and lives
[1:36:32] even to the housewife to the farmer to
[1:36:35] the mechanic
[1:36:36] or whoever we are we've got to surrender
[1:36:38] completely to god and know that we
[1:36:40] are nothing
[1:36:45] then let god start from there then he
[1:36:48] starts moving
[1:36:50] working that includes all of us everyone
[1:36:53] that's the thing we've got to do
[1:36:57] some of us build upon intellectual
[1:36:58] conception well that man's a scholar and
[1:37:00] he wrote a book
[1:37:03] and some of us and he's a he's an
[1:37:05] excellent speaker and he's got the way
[1:37:06] to bring
[1:37:07] peace and harmony and nonsense there's
[1:37:09] only one place of peace and harmony
[1:37:16] the next one based on some sensation of
[1:37:18] movement shaking crying
[1:37:20] shouting dancing in the spirit or
[1:37:22] something some emotional
[1:37:23] outward work and that's just as bad as
[1:37:26] the education
[1:37:27] if the devil can't get you on one side
[1:37:29] he'll push you off the other side
[1:37:31] but the thing of it is is having nothing
[1:37:33] you can depend on in your own self
[1:37:36] or anything you can do just a complete
[1:37:38] total surrender
[1:37:39] of your weakness unto god and say here i
[1:37:41] am
[1:37:42] have nothing no ability that you can
[1:37:45] trust
[1:37:46] in
[1:37:51] god can use them if they're ready to
[1:37:53] forget that they are a somebody
[1:37:56] you've got to forget you're a somebody
[1:37:57] and become a nobody
[1:37:59] god can use you and make us somebody out
[1:38:02] of you but you've got to forget that you
[1:38:04] are so important
[1:38:07] there's many of us now look he said the
[1:38:09] more you get out of yourself the more
[1:38:11] room you can
[1:38:11] got for the holy spirit to come in
[1:38:16] paul said first corinthians 2 1 i am
[1:38:19] determined not to know anything among
[1:38:21] you save jesus christ
[1:38:22] and him crucified i didn't come to you
[1:38:26] with excellency of speech
[1:38:27] i didn't come to you through my learning
[1:38:29] i come to you as a weakling
[1:38:30] he said i come to you in fear and
[1:38:32] trembling
[1:38:35] he said trembling that i come to you in
[1:38:37] weakness and trembling
[1:38:39] because he said i cannot trust in my own
[1:38:41] ability
[1:38:43] if he couldn't trust in his learned
[1:38:45] ability
[1:38:46] then since when are we going to trust in
[1:38:48] any other man's ability
[1:38:49] or our own ability to think it through
[1:38:52] and to learn and then to pass
[1:38:53] that garbage onto other people in this
[1:38:56] message when we ought to be living a
[1:38:59] manifestation of the promised word but
[1:39:01] the problem is
[1:39:02] is you need the holy ghost to do it and
[1:39:05] because you shouted because you
[1:39:06] prophesied because you do this
[1:39:08] and that and something else you think
[1:39:09] you got it when your life won't match
[1:39:11] the word
[1:39:15] how you say it will match your word
[1:39:16] because your fruit is not the word for
[1:39:18] the season
[1:39:23] amen that's where the blood lays
[1:39:28] i said a mouthful right then
[1:39:31] god give us understanding
[1:39:35] i don't know i'm determined not to know
[1:39:36] anything about your abilities paul said
[1:39:38] i know there's nothing in you and i'm
[1:39:40] only determined to know one thing that i
[1:39:42] see in you
[1:39:43] i want to see jesus christ and him
[1:39:46] crucified
[1:39:48] boy all but it's hard when he crucifies
[1:39:52] or when we're crucified is that right
[1:39:56] but that's what he said i want to see
[1:39:57] i've got to see jesus christ in you
[1:40:00] and him crucified
[1:40:06] all right the crucified saver among you
[1:40:08] that's all i'm going to recognize
[1:40:12] because he could not trust in his own
[1:40:13] ability i hope that gets down deep to us
[1:40:16] both here in the tape world too
[1:40:18] that you realize that you've got to
[1:40:19] become nothing
[1:40:21] not a know-it-all not a great somebody
[1:40:24] but a nobody
[1:40:25] you've got to come to dust you've got to
[1:40:27] get to the place that you know that
[1:40:28] you're nothing
[1:40:30] you don't and don't ever raise above it
[1:40:32] for as soon as you raise above it you
[1:40:34] rise above god
[1:40:35] you've got to keep yourself in the dust
[1:40:37] and on the road to damascus
[1:40:39] you've got to keep yourself off your
[1:40:40] high horse and that's for everywhere
[1:40:42] here
[1:40:43] and in the tape world and it's not a
[1:40:46] make-believe
[1:40:47] it is a real belief revelation is not a
[1:40:51] make-believe
[1:40:52] revelation is a true substance of the
[1:40:54] word in you revealed
[1:40:58] all right then paul said when i'm weak
[1:41:01] then i'm strong then i will glory my
[1:41:03] infirmities of my weakness and so forth
[1:41:05] i thank you god that i got it all out of
[1:41:07] me
[1:41:07] and when i get everything out of me then
[1:41:09] god can come in but as long as i got
[1:41:11] some of myself there god can't get in
[1:41:14] we smother him out we drive him away
[1:41:16] from the poorest of us to the richest of
[1:41:18] us from the lost
[1:41:19] the least to the greatest we keep god
[1:41:21] out of our lives because of
[1:41:22] our own selves
[1:41:26] that's the greatest enemy of god's
[1:41:27] william branham he's the one that gets
[1:41:28] in god's way he's the one that gets lazy
[1:41:30] he's the one that gets to a place where
[1:41:31] he thinks he can do something about it
[1:41:33] when he does that shoves god right out
[1:41:35] of the picture let me tell you something
[1:41:37] we appreciate good works but good works
[1:41:39] won't bring in the rapture
[1:41:43] but works reflecting faith the faith of
[1:41:46] god
[1:41:46] the faith of god will put you in the
[1:41:48] rapture
[1:41:50] amen are you with me it's revelation
[1:41:52] that makes a difference
[1:41:55] amen and if there's true revelation
[1:41:57] there your works will show that
[1:41:59] revelation
[1:42:00] and men will see those works and glorify
[1:42:02] your father which is in heaven
[1:42:04] because they see the works of the holy
[1:42:06] ghost and you manifest it
[1:42:08] through faith
[1:42:11] amen that's it all right
[1:42:16] when i can get this guy out of the way
[1:42:18] william brown and when i can get a place
[1:42:19] where he's out of the way then
[1:42:20] god can come over and do things that
[1:42:22] william branham's nothing about
[1:42:24] so when that's when god can use you
[1:42:26] that's when he can use any
[1:42:28] of you he can use anybody when we get
[1:42:30] out of the way but as long as we got
[1:42:32] ourselves in the way we cannot
[1:42:34] all right oh my
[1:42:38] god soldiers our heroes
[1:42:42] we just read in the book of the 11th
[1:42:43] chapter 34th verse out of weakness was
[1:42:45] made strong
[1:42:46] they had to get weak before they could
[1:42:48] get strong
[1:42:51] out of their weakness they were made
[1:42:54] strong
[1:42:56] can you give me five minutes i've got
[1:42:58] something i gotta finish with
[1:43:00] i'd like to go more on that on that of
[1:43:04] consider your ways but we can do that
[1:43:05] another time i think i touched on it you
[1:43:08] made that we made that no you believe
[1:43:11] god's sovereign
[1:43:13] how many has ever heard this writing
[1:43:14] called the high calling
[1:43:18] yes okay it's called the high quality
[1:43:21] may not be what you have in the office
[1:43:23] no no it may be
[1:43:26] and it may not be i want to read it can
[1:43:29] i read it
[1:43:30] okay a little bit of reading here again
[1:43:32] just listen to me because i want to
[1:43:34] i didn't know whether to start this or
[1:43:35] close this but god definitely had had
[1:43:37] laid this in my heart i got to read this
[1:43:39] i pray god will help us bring out in it
[1:43:42] for you individually what you need
[1:43:46] how this come about this message was
[1:43:49] found written on a piece of paper
[1:43:51] amongst the artifact they use the word
[1:43:53] artifacts of brother branham
[1:43:55] or his personal possession
[1:43:59] it is understood that he carried it with
[1:44:01] him as a reminder of his high calling
[1:44:05] okay so you're aware of that okay it was
[1:44:07] actually given to ernie fandler i guess
[1:44:09] and then ernie was given to him by
[1:44:11] another brother too ernie brother
[1:44:13] branham gave it to ernie fandler
[1:44:15] through another richard i think it's a
[1:44:17] richard gough
[1:44:18] anyway you're aware of it you mind if i
[1:44:21] read it
[1:44:22] just let me read this if god has called
[1:44:24] you to be really like jesus which the
[1:44:26] bride
[1:44:27] is called to be really like jesus
[1:44:29] because she is
[1:44:30] she is jesus in another form
[1:44:34] i hope i didn't choke anybody by that
[1:44:35] statement all right
[1:44:38] if if god has called you to be really
[1:44:40] like jesus in all your spirit
[1:44:42] little s spirit he will draw you into a
[1:44:45] life of crucifixion and humility and put
[1:44:48] on you such demands of obedience
[1:44:50] that he will not allow you to follow
[1:44:52] other christians and in many ways he
[1:44:54] will
[1:44:54] he will seem to let other good people do
[1:44:56] things which he will not let you do
[1:44:59] is that the same thing okay other
[1:45:02] christians and ministers who seem very
[1:45:04] religious
[1:45:05] and useful may push themselves pull
[1:45:07] wires work schemes to carry out their
[1:45:09] plans
[1:45:09] but you cannot do it and if you attempt
[1:45:13] if you attempt it you will meet with
[1:45:15] such failure and rebuke from the lord as
[1:45:17] to make you solely
[1:45:18] sorely penitent others can brag on
[1:45:22] themselves on their work
[1:45:24] on their success on their writings but
[1:45:26] the holy spirit will not allow you to do
[1:45:28] any such thing if
[1:45:30] you begin it he will lead you into some
[1:45:32] deep mortification
[1:45:34] that will make you despise yourself and
[1:45:36] all your good works
[1:45:38] okay others will be allowed to succeed
[1:45:41] in making great sums of money
[1:45:43] or having a legacy left to them or
[1:45:45] having luxuries but god may supply you
[1:45:47] daily
[1:45:48] but god may supply you daily daily just
[1:45:51] daily not just giving you everything
[1:45:53] but daily getting you to trust him daily
[1:45:57] because he wants you to have something
[1:45:59] far better than gold
[1:46:00] that is a helpless dependence upon him
[1:46:05] that he may have the privilege of
[1:46:06] providing your needs day by day
[1:46:08] out of the unseen treasury the lord may
[1:46:11] let others be honored and put forward
[1:46:13] and keep you hid away in obscurity
[1:46:15] because he wants to produce some choice
[1:46:18] fragrant fruit
[1:46:19] for his coming glory which can only be
[1:46:21] produced in the shade
[1:46:23] in obscurity god will let others be
[1:46:26] great
[1:46:27] but keep you small he will let us do
[1:46:29] work for him and keep his
[1:46:30] keep the cred and and get the credits
[1:46:33] for it
[1:46:33] but he will make you work and toil on
[1:46:36] without knowing
[1:46:37] how much you are doing and then make
[1:46:39] your work
[1:46:40] still more and then to make your work
[1:46:42] still more precious
[1:46:44] he will let others get the credit for
[1:46:46] the for the work
[1:46:47] which you have done and this will make
[1:46:49] your reward ten times greater
[1:46:50] when jesus comes the holy spirit will
[1:46:53] put a strict watch in you with jealous
[1:46:55] love
[1:46:56] and will rebuke you for little words or
[1:46:58] feelings or for wasting your time
[1:47:00] which other christians never seem
[1:47:02] distressed over
[1:47:04] so make up your mind that god is
[1:47:06] infinite is an infinite sovereign
[1:47:08] he has a right to do as he pleases with
[1:47:10] his own
[1:47:11] and he will not explain to you he will
[1:47:13] not explain to you a thousand things
[1:47:15] which may puzzle your reason
[1:47:17] in this dealings with you that's where
[1:47:19] you have to know
[1:47:21] that's where you have confidence to
[1:47:23] completely give it over to you have to
[1:47:25] know him
[1:47:26] and he's in you then you rest
[1:47:30] i don't care how the way goes it's going
[1:47:33] to work
[1:47:34] according to his dealing and if it's
[1:47:36] something wrong little any little thing
[1:47:38] wrong
[1:47:39] prophet said he'll show you
[1:47:42] you'll correct it see the confidence we
[1:47:44] have in him
[1:47:45] all right put him first
[1:47:51] god will take you god
[1:47:54] will take you at your word and if you
[1:47:56] absolutely see yourself to be his slave
[1:47:58] he will wrap you up in a jealous love
[1:48:01] and let other people say and do many
[1:48:02] things that you cannot
[1:48:04] say cannot do or say settle it forever
[1:48:07] that you are to deal directly with the
[1:48:09] holy spirit that is to have the
[1:48:11] privilege of tying your tongue
[1:48:12] or chaining your hand or closing your
[1:48:15] eyes
[1:48:16] now that's not
[1:48:19] now let's let the lord take care of that
[1:48:21] all right in ways that others may
[1:48:23] are not to deal with now when you are so
[1:48:27] possessed with the living god that you
[1:48:29] are in your secret heart please
[1:48:31] and delighted over this particular
[1:48:33] personal private
[1:48:34] jealous guardianship and management of
[1:48:36] the holy spirit over your life
[1:48:38] you will have found the vestibule of
[1:48:40] heaven
[1:48:42] now listen brother sister god will deal
[1:48:45] directly with you with the holy spirit
[1:48:47] but there's one thing the holy spirit
[1:48:49] will not do is lead you away from his
[1:48:52] word
[1:48:54] see satan can use that he says see the
[1:48:57] holy spirit's on you
[1:48:58] but what are you doing you're leaving
[1:49:00] the word
[1:49:01] the holy spirit's not doing that just
[1:49:04] let that soak in
[1:49:08] the holy spirit will not lead you off
[1:49:10] his word
[1:49:11] he said i'm led by the holy spirit i can
[1:49:14] go against my husband
[1:49:18] not according the word you can't unless
[1:49:21] he says something or does something
[1:49:22] contrary to the word or makes you do
[1:49:24] something contrary the word
[1:49:26] then you stay with the word is that okay
