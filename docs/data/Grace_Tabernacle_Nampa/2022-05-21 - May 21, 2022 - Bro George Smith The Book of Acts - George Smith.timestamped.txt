[28:51] bless you brother george have your
[28:52] liberty
[28:55] good evening
[28:56] it's good to be here yeah
[28:58] and we trust that
[29:00] everyone is awake
[29:03] and um
[29:05] hungry for a part of the word
[29:08] now according to my figures i was last
[29:10] here in um
[29:11] looks like february of last year
[29:14] and so
[29:15] we were going through the book of acts
[29:17] and you probably forgot about it already
[29:19] we're not going to start up chapter one
[29:21] again
[29:22] but we could
[29:24] um but as you're seated there just open
[29:27] your bibles to chapter 18
[29:30] of the book of acts
[29:33] and i may read out of more than one
[29:35] bible
[29:36] because we have
[29:38] king james version we've had since you
[29:39] know about 500 years now
[29:41] and we have uh the lambs a bible
[29:45] some of you students have heard about
[29:46] that
[29:48] and uh it's a
[29:51] very good translation
[29:52] has just a little more
[29:54] salsa let's say in some areas
[29:57] so it
[29:58] it helps to
[30:01] understand maybe
[30:03] but anyway
[30:04] um
[30:05] i'm thankful that brother
[30:07] paul has invited me out
[30:09] and we need to pray for our brother he's
[30:11] got the ox in the ditch he's trying to
[30:13] get it going again so
[30:15] you understand him better than i do
[30:17] but i'm just glad to be here also
[30:19] and we've been in a lot of places
[30:23] i was sick with covert last year but i'm
[30:26] well now
[30:28] immune
[30:31] lord willing i'll be going to south
[30:33] africa in july
[30:35] but for now we're here and we want to um
[30:38] just approach the word of the lord and
[30:40] see what he has for each one of us let's
[30:42] pray father we thank you for your word
[30:43] we thank you for this occasion we can be
[30:45] together we thank you lord for this
[30:47] beautiful group of people we pray that
[30:48] you should bless them and lord may you
[30:50] minister to them only the way you know
[30:52] how to as we look into your word give us
[30:55] grace
[30:56] lord bless brother paul bless each one
[30:57] lord that's out or pray that you should
[30:59] bless them bring them in tomorrow help
[31:02] us now in jesus name amen
[31:05] so in the book of
[31:06] acts we have
[31:08] um
[31:09] the
[31:10] history of the early church these are
[31:12] our people this is our church back there
[31:14] where it started
[31:15] and it's come through a couple thousand
[31:16] years
[31:17] and a lot of trials and tribulations but
[31:20] um
[31:22] uh
[31:22] we look back so that we can see the
[31:24] foundation again
[31:26] it's fine to
[31:27] re you know relish what we have now
[31:29] where did this come from how did it how
[31:32] did we get this far
[31:33] and um brother branham says over 200
[31:36] times back to the word so we have
[31:38] authority to go and look into
[31:40] his
[31:41] um
[31:44] we call it
[31:45] absolute
[31:46] and see what
[31:47] god has for us
[31:49] so in chapter 18 we have paul and silas
[31:52] his trusted associate
[31:55] and they're in the midst of their second
[31:56] missionary journey now
[31:58] and the date is about 49 a.d
[32:02] and paul at this point has already
[32:04] written his letter to the galatians
[32:06] and um
[32:08] also the letter to the 12 tribes which
[32:11] is known as the epistle of james in our
[32:14] bible right after hebrews
[32:16] and so
[32:17] all this is going on i used to think
[32:19] that all the letters that paul wrote
[32:20] were written from prison but they're not
[32:22] they're written from along the way
[32:23] sometimes
[32:24] you got letters hey what about this what
[32:26] about that and so he had to uh find the
[32:28] mind of the lord
[32:30] to um
[32:31] you know to write to them so in verse 1
[32:34] of chapter 18
[32:36] and it came to pass that while apollos
[32:38] was in corinth
[32:40] 19 chapter 18. after these things paul
[32:42] departed from athens and came to corinth
[32:46] now we're going to go through this
[32:46] slowly so you can understand and see
[32:48] where we're at
[32:50] now corinth is about 20 miles west of
[32:52] athens
[32:53] it was a city well known for idolatry
[32:57] very bad reputation amongst the citizens
[33:00] and on the edge of the city was a great
[33:03] temple built to the goddess diana
[33:05] complete with women priests and every
[33:07] kind of
[33:08] perversion so we're not going to go into
[33:10] all that but you can imagine
[33:12] and this was one of the reasons that
[33:14] paul seemed to be so heavy-handed
[33:16] against women because there was a lot of
[33:18] bad things going on
[33:21] and just like in our day brother brennan
[33:22] wasn't screaming at the ladies and
[33:25] screaming at the women you know
[33:27] and uh many of them were completely out
[33:29] of their place they were doing every
[33:30] ungodly thing
[33:32] and um
[33:34] but paul was sure about what he preached
[33:36] see because he received it by revelation
[33:39] from god
[33:41] now in the church age book on chapter 1
[33:43] paragraph 98 brother ram says we need to
[33:45] call on god for revelation more than
[33:47] anything else in the world
[33:51] from the 16 year old to the
[33:52] seven-year-old to all of us
[33:54] that is the most important thing
[33:56] call on god for revelation he says we
[33:58] have accepted the bible we have accepted
[34:00] the great truths of it but we still it
[34:03] is still not real to most people because
[34:06] the revelation of the spirit is not
[34:08] there
[34:08] the word has not been quickened
[34:10] all up down the street we've got nice
[34:12] churches and they all have this same
[34:14] bible
[34:15] and they probably know it a lot better
[34:17] than some of us but we need to you know
[34:19] ask god for more revelation
[34:22] because then when we get to galatians 1
[34:23] and 8
[34:24] if you look at that very uh quickly
[34:27] galatians 1 8 as we read it from the
[34:29] lamsa bible here
[34:31] is
[34:32] the fact that
[34:33] we have the truth
[34:36] but um paul was writing to this new
[34:39] church over there in verse six i'm
[34:41] surprised how soon you have turned to
[34:43] another gospel
[34:45] away from christ who has called you by
[34:47] his grace so they knew the grace of
[34:50] christ they've been converted but now
[34:53] they were being attracted to something
[34:55] else
[34:55] he goes on and says a gospel which does
[34:57] not even exist
[34:59] how be it there are men who have stirred
[35:03] you up and want to pervert the gospel of
[35:05] christ
[35:06] but though we
[35:08] that's he
[35:09] silas
[35:10] paul george whoever
[35:12] though we or an angel even from heaven
[35:14] comes down and preaches any other gospel
[35:16] to you than that which we have already
[35:18] preached to you
[35:19] let him be accursed
[35:21] so there's no grace there's no getting
[35:23] along there's no let's have coffee no
[35:26] it's either gospel or it's to the hot
[35:28] place
[35:29] two choices
[35:31] verse nine in case you missed it the
[35:33] first time as i said before
[35:35] so i i guess i say again if any man
[35:38] preaches any other gospel to you than
[35:40] that which you have received let him be
[35:43] accursed
[35:44] so we don't have to wonder what that
[35:46] means
[35:47] um
[35:48] god's word is our basis
[35:50] it's not because brother branham said so
[35:52] not because this or that because the
[35:54] word says so
[35:56] so paul had to deal with a generation of
[35:58] women out of control
[36:00] living way beyond scriptural brown
[36:02] bounds
[36:03] and brother brown faced the same thing
[36:05] you see so that's why it seems a lot of
[36:07] his
[36:08] preaching was against women
[36:10] well you remember the story of
[36:11] cinderella
[36:13] there's only one person in the shoe fit
[36:17] that's right so
[36:20] in the message choosing of a bride
[36:22] a sentence here that you probably never
[36:24] heard before
[36:27] he says but if she can hold herself
[36:29] right
[36:30] that means balanced in every way and yes
[36:32] i did not forget to bring a level
[36:37] still good okay
[36:39] if she can hold herself right
[36:42] balanced you know
[36:43] modest apparel eyes on calvary what a
[36:46] greater reward she has than a man oh
[36:49] where'd that come from
[36:51] doesn't come from some of the churches i
[36:52] met at greater rewards she has than a
[36:55] man she is put on a testing ground so
[36:57] that's for you ladies in particular and
[36:59] the bride in general you see
[37:02] so there's a continuity to the word of
[37:04] god and the spirit of god working in the
[37:06] seven messengers but we especially
[37:09] appreciate the similarities between the
[37:10] first messenger and the seventh
[37:12] messenger see
[37:14] because see hebrews 13 8 is still in
[37:16] effect amen now it was easy to believe
[37:19] when brother branham was standing here
[37:20] and yeah same yesterday today oh yeah it
[37:22] looks the same and tomorrow who knows
[37:25] well we're there we're tomorrow now
[37:26] that's right
[37:27] so there's a there's a group of people
[37:29] that is reflecting hebrews 13 8 today
[37:32] see
[37:33] and so um
[37:35] he's still the same
[37:36] and it'll be seen in followers of the
[37:38] true word not in followers of
[37:40] personalities
[37:42] we've been there
[37:44] you know
[37:45] because in the scripture it it has room
[37:47] for all that in horsing in
[37:50] genesis 1 every seed after its kind
[37:53] so the baptists are only going to
[37:54] produce baptists
[37:57] the big church you know headquarters in
[37:59] utah they're only going to produce those
[38:00] kind of people but we're here to
[38:03] encourage you to live the word amen
[38:06] okay we've got another place here where
[38:08] brother man speaks 1955 a few nights ago
[38:11] in prayer in a prayer meeting a man said
[38:12] to me the holy ghost was only given to
[38:14] the twelve of the day of pentecost
[38:16] i said well then what about the 120th
[38:18] that was there at the same time received
[38:20] it how about down to the house of
[38:21] cornelius and we've covered that in
[38:22] chapter 10 i believe was
[38:24] and 33 years later paul asked the
[38:26] baptist if they had received the holy
[38:27] ghost since they believed he laid hands
[38:28] on them and they received the holy ghost
[38:31] setting the church
[38:32] in order in corinth okay he also said uh
[38:36] in the church apostles prophets teachers
[38:38] evangelists gifts of healing all that's
[38:40] part of the word
[38:42] you know it didn't go away
[38:44] and
[38:45] all those marvelous gifts beyond
[38:48] years and years beyond pentecost well
[38:49] then so it is today with every believer
[38:52] go into all the world and preach the
[38:54] gospel to every creature
[38:57] that's the general orders you see
[38:59] it it didn't go away
[39:01] and so how far all the world
[39:04] people like david i've been there some
[39:05] of those places you know how many all
[39:07] the people he that believeth and is
[39:10] baptized shall be saved so you got to
[39:12] start at the cross not start with the
[39:15] you know seal book or marriage and
[39:17] divorce no you start at the cross
[39:19] okay
[39:21] he that believeth not shall be damned
[39:23] and these signs shall follow them that
[39:24] believe in my name they shall cast out
[39:27] devils heal the sick and so forth there
[39:29] you are it's god's promise that he swore
[39:31] he would do it
[39:32] no matter how much
[39:34] you know rises up to try to counterfeit
[39:36] to impersonate it or how many things
[39:38] raise up to try to contradict it or take
[39:40] it down it will go on and on and on
[39:44] god has sworn by himself that he would
[39:46] keep it so remember though we
[39:49] or even an angel comes down right here
[39:52] wow
[39:53] got to believe what he said really
[39:54] they'd better say what the word says
[39:56] right and you better know what the word
[39:57] says you'll be swept away you see
[40:01] and so that's why it's important to me
[40:03] to look into what paul said because when
[40:06] brother brahma had the experience of
[40:08] beyond the curtain of time it was all
[40:10] based on the fact that paul preached the
[40:12] truth
[40:14] amen
[40:15] those of us that were there i'm sorry
[40:16] but not everybody's carrying these books
[40:18] is going okay that's right but if you're
[40:20] serious you know you're plugged in god
[40:22] will take you but
[40:25] those of us that were there beyond the
[40:26] curtain of time
[40:28] um
[40:29] when brother brown was asked
[40:31] you know he said you got to be judged
[40:32] what you preached
[40:34] well he didn't start biting his
[40:35] fingernails and worrying
[40:37] immediately what about paul well he'll
[40:39] be judged also well if his people make
[40:41] it in my people make it because i
[40:43] preached exactly what paul preached and
[40:45] we all said we're depending on that amen
[40:48] not that you knew the secrets not all
[40:50] these other things but you preach what
[40:51] paul preached
[40:53] okay amen
[40:54] 18 verse 2.
[40:56] and so he said corinth and found a
[40:59] certain jew named aquila
[41:01] born
[41:02] in pontus lately come from italy
[41:05] and his wife priscilla
[41:08] because that claudius had commanded all
[41:10] the jews to depart from rome
[41:12] and so he came into them
[41:14] and
[41:15] because he was of the same craft
[41:18] he abode with them and wrought for
[41:21] um
[41:22] by their occupation
[41:23] they were tent makers okay
[41:25] so this couple aquila and priscilla man
[41:28] and wife they were jews and they had a
[41:31] crap they knew how to do things they
[41:32] made tents
[41:34] so they had this trade
[41:36] and the manufacturer of affordable
[41:39] mobile buildings will say
[41:41] for working for living for traveling
[41:45] like travel trailers or you know
[41:47] economical rvs
[41:48] and so we'll find this couple later in a
[41:51] lot more of the study but uh in verse 4
[41:53] paul went to church when the doors were
[41:55] open
[41:57] on their worship day the sabbath and he
[41:59] spoke only to jews and greeks because
[42:02] jesus said back in matthew 10 i believe
[42:04] it is
[42:06] go only to the house of israel
[42:08] not sure everybody would like you know
[42:09] we'd like to preach the gospel to
[42:11] everybody but he said go only to the
[42:13] house of israel but even in the old
[42:15] testament he says you know talks about
[42:16] the gentiles and the new testament how
[42:18] that paul will go to the gentiles but
[42:21] first the house of israel
[42:23] so he only went to them
[42:24] and so finally um in verse five his
[42:27] helpers arrived from up north and
[42:30] but the opposition was real great you
[42:32] know
[42:32] and uh it says paul was pressed in the
[42:34] spirit one translation says that he was
[42:37] not free to speak because the jews
[42:39] opposed him and blasphemed as he
[42:42] testified that jesus is the christ
[42:45] so see that was their message at the
[42:46] time
[42:48] it wasn't jesus said and jesus said
[42:50] no
[42:51] they already had a bible that was 200
[42:53] years old the translation
[42:55] excuse me and so
[42:58] the the priests the one people that
[43:00] could read they knew their bible
[43:02] and to all paul his message was this is
[43:05] the fulfillment of the scriptures y'all
[43:07] memorized
[43:08] see that's what he was doing
[43:10] and so um at this point in the in the in
[43:12] the story here in acts 18
[43:15] um it was a real turning point for paul
[43:18] he had worked hard endured opposition
[43:21] beatings prison and now open blasphemy
[43:24] against the name of jesus christ you
[43:26] know so he
[43:27] shook the dust off his coat
[43:29] and he said over here in verse six
[43:31] and when they opposed themselves and
[43:33] blasphemed he shook his reign shook the
[43:35] dust off
[43:36] and said them your blood be upon your
[43:38] own heads i'm clean in other words i'm
[43:41] finished with you people from here on
[43:43] i'm going to the gentiles
[43:45] he's had it you know there's there's a
[43:49] breaking point
[43:50] and so um
[43:52] sometimes you just got to push delete
[43:54] and go on
[43:56] you know there's no uh there's no repair
[43:58] sometimes
[43:59] so um you know we would like for
[44:01] everybody and our relatives and
[44:03] everybody to uh to
[44:05] hear the truth believe the truth and
[44:07] live
[44:08] in peace with god
[44:11] but some people are just not cut out for
[44:13] it
[44:14] you know they're after another kind
[44:16] sorry
[44:17] and um
[44:18] you go you go trying to press it on them
[44:21] they will make you miserable
[44:23] and eventually they will blaspheme you
[44:25] because you didn't know when to stop
[44:27] you know so we got to move on
[44:30] we can only help those that ask for help
[44:33] now when you're in the ministry it's a
[44:34] very difficult thing because we can see
[44:37] a situation we've been through this
[44:39] before or god has showed us something
[44:40] and we know how to give them some advice
[44:43] but we've got to
[44:46] when they ask for help then we can help
[44:49] verse 7 and he departed thence and
[44:52] entered into a certain man's house and
[44:54] his name was justice okay so he moved on
[44:57] uh and this is one that worshipped god
[44:59] his house
[45:00] it says here joined heart of the
[45:02] synagogue that means he shared a wall he
[45:03] lived right there next you know he was
[45:05] the next department right there
[45:07] and um
[45:09] and crispus the chief ruler of the
[45:11] synagogue believed on the lord with all
[45:13] his house
[45:14] and many of the corinthians hearing
[45:16] believed and were baptized that's good
[45:19] then spake the lord to paul in the night
[45:22] by vision
[45:23] be not afraid but speak
[45:25] and hold not thy peace for i am with
[45:28] thee and no man shall set on thee to
[45:31] hurt thee for i have much people in this
[45:34] city
[45:36] now that's good
[45:37] you got a direct word from god oh don't
[45:39] leave there's things to do here
[45:42] and so um
[45:43] and he continued there a year and six
[45:45] months teaching the word of god among
[45:47] them so here he is 18 months in corinth
[45:50] getting the church in order preaching
[45:52] the word by permission you know vision
[45:54] of the lord so 12 through 17 once again
[45:57] we have the fanatical religious jews
[46:00] took paul into court
[46:03] this guy is persuading men to worship
[46:05] god contrary to the law
[46:07] he was only showing christ from the word
[46:10] he wasn't contrary to the law the law
[46:12] was good had its time but it had a
[46:14] fulfillment
[46:15] and so um
[46:17] they they were upset but he's only
[46:19] showing you know the god that they said
[46:21] they knew
[46:22] but they had no revelation right just
[46:24] like brother brown said in the church
[46:25] age book
[46:26] we we're sure the bible is right but we
[46:28] got to have revelation to make it work
[46:30] you know
[46:31] and so when the judge
[46:33] realized it was not a civil case but a
[46:35] religious issue he dismissed them all
[46:37] you know go home verse 14.
[46:40] um paul's when paul was about to open
[46:43] his mouth
[46:44] um
[46:45] galileo said unto the jews if this was a
[46:48] matter of wrong or wicked lewdness you
[46:50] jews reasoned that that i would bear
[46:52] with you but if it be a question of
[46:55] words and names and your law
[46:58] you'll take care of it
[46:59] i won't be a judge in such matters you
[47:02] drove them out of the court out of here
[47:04] you know
[47:05] and so um
[47:07] the greek citizens were really upset
[47:08] because they wanted they wanted
[47:10] somebody to you know they wanted blood
[47:13] and um
[47:14] and so what they do they beat up one of
[47:15] the rulers of the synagogue
[47:17] the law did nothing just kind of look
[47:19] the other way
[47:21] sounds like downtown here right yeah
[47:23] louisville everywhere else
[47:24] yeah same spirit
[47:26] so in verse 18 paul heads off to syria
[47:29] stop over in ephesus
[47:31] and he left aquila and priscilla in
[47:33] ephesus
[47:34] and they were very instrumental in
[47:35] forming the local church in rome in
[47:37] corinth emphasis a great husband and
[47:40] wife team and if you haven't seen the
[47:42] the film
[47:43] paul apostle of jesus christ it's
[47:45] available on dvd it's right there on
[47:47] your phone you can buy it it's very very
[47:50] good
[47:52] righteous jerry
[47:54] okay
[47:56] needed amen that's all
[47:58] verse 24
[48:00] and a certain jew named apollos born in
[48:02] alexandria eloquent man mighty in the
[48:05] scripture
[48:06] came to ephesus so he's preaching
[48:08] through there
[48:10] and this man says he was instructed in
[48:12] the way of the lord and being uh fervent
[48:14] in the spirit he spake and taught
[48:16] diligently the things of the lord
[48:18] knowing only the baptism of john
[48:20] so up to there he was really good at
[48:22] what he was saying
[48:23] and he began to speak boldly
[48:25] in the synagogue
[48:27] who when aquila and priscilla heard him
[48:29] they took him home
[48:31] for dinner and expounded him more
[48:34] perfectly the way of god
[48:36] and when he was disposed to pass unto
[48:39] asia
[48:40] the brethren wrote exhorting the
[48:42] disciples to receive him who when he was
[48:44] come
[48:45] help them with which he believed
[48:48] through grace for he mightily convinced
[48:50] the jews and that publicly showing
[48:53] by the scriptures that jesus was the
[48:55] christ
[48:56] see that was their message okay
[48:59] so meanwhile back
[49:00] you know uh ephesus
[49:03] they uh
[49:05] they helped brother apollos because you
[49:06] know he lacked in in revelation
[49:09] but um the light had moved on he just
[49:12] wasn't aware of it you know now
[49:14] in alexandria uh it's still there today
[49:17] it's it's port city in egypt and that's
[49:20] where the more readable user-friendly
[49:22] greek translation was made of the old
[49:23] testament
[49:25] um
[49:26] probably 200 years before christ so
[49:28] greek was the trade language of the day
[49:30] see like english yesterday maybe and
[49:32] that would have been the bible that
[49:33] peter was quoting from
[49:35] uh
[49:36] and used by many others
[49:38] and uh even to this day it's the bible
[49:40] used by the greek orthodox church
[49:42] they don't get confused the greek
[49:44] orthodox church is based in istanbul
[49:46] turkey and it's simply the eastern half
[49:49] of the church of the catholic church
[49:51] rome is the headquarters of the
[49:54] western church
[49:56] and there was one church
[49:58] until they couldn't agree on doctrine
[50:00] and he divided in the year 1054.
[50:03] and just recently the two heads got
[50:04] together you know it'll all be one
[50:06] church eventually
[50:08] okay so
[50:10] uh um
[50:12] 26 which i think already read here yeah
[50:13] they spoke boldly and so forth so more
[50:15] precisely the revelation of the word of
[50:17] the day which they lived they weren't
[50:19] living in the glare of another day they
[50:21] were living in present tense see god is
[50:23] revealing self in present tense
[50:27] we're still under the umbrella of the
[50:28] seventh messenger you see
[50:30] all god's word is true but there's a
[50:32] period it's something allotted for each
[50:34] period it's just divided up
[50:36] and so we're under that umbrella we love
[50:38] all the word but the goal that we have
[50:41] today isn't looking for that seventh
[50:43] messenger because
[50:44] he was already here
[50:46] i knew him personally so he was here
[50:48] left us
[50:49] something to work with and um but the
[50:51] message today
[50:53] is
[50:55] looking for the exit of laodicea
[50:57] it's right out here you know
[50:59] we're leaving
[51:01] so the message continued to be the same
[51:03] and
[51:04] apollos was preaching the same as paul
[51:07] showing publicly by the scriptures that
[51:08] jesus was the christ
[51:10] so later god would reveal some other
[51:12] doctrines to him so now we get into
[51:14] chapter 19
[51:15] so apollo says holy meetings in corinth
[51:18] paul is traveling you know into had
[51:20] contact with the believers in emphasis
[51:22] uh emphasis at that time would have been
[51:24] a city of possibly 350 000 people
[51:27] maybe the size of louisville or
[51:29] something a big city
[51:31] and um so priscilla and aquila they were
[51:33] there with their tent making
[51:35] and so uh chapter 19 verse 2
[51:38] and he said unto them you know he found
[51:40] these other disciples over there
[51:42] he said have you all received the holy
[51:44] ghost since you believed
[51:45] and they said
[51:46] we don't know anything about that never
[51:48] heard about it and he said to them unto
[51:51] what were you baptized
[51:52] and they said john's baptism that's all
[51:55] the light they had
[51:57] now they could have said and we don't
[51:58] want to hear no more thank you leave
[52:00] but they knew there was more
[52:02] see
[52:04] then said paul
[52:06] john verily baptized with baptism of
[52:08] repentance saying unto the people that
[52:11] they should believe on him which should
[52:13] come after him that is on christ jesus
[52:16] that's who i'm here to tell you about
[52:17] see and when they heard this they were
[52:19] baptized in the name of jesus in the
[52:21] name of the lord jesus okay
[52:24] so um and when paul had laid his hands
[52:26] on them the holy ghost came to them and
[52:29] they speak with tongues and prophesied
[52:30] and most people only go that far and you
[52:32] thought it was 150 people it was 12
[52:35] people
[52:36] and it's right there
[52:39] okay
[52:40] so
[52:42] they were perfectly carrying out
[52:44] the pattern of acts 2 the day of
[52:46] pentecost
[52:47] here's great missionary paul
[52:49] baptizing a small group of 12 people
[52:52] and the same was done at each baptism
[52:54] throughout the entire book of acts all
[52:56] through the bible
[52:57] as they spread the gospel in the name of
[53:00] the lord jesus christ up until the
[53:02] catholic church changed the to the
[53:04] original words of the trinitarian
[53:06] words of jesus in the year 325
[53:09] so the baptism remains simple
[53:12] and pure in the name of jesus christ for
[53:14] over 300 years
[53:17] and for most of these other 1700 years
[53:19] the prevailing teaching has been and
[53:21] continues to be in the precise words of
[53:24] jesus christ from matthew 28 19
[53:27] which anybody that reads that well what
[53:30] is the name
[53:31] it's not in the name no in the name
[53:34] so they do it without revelation
[53:36] and so the roman church despises
[53:39] revelation
[53:41] we all have friends we got relatives
[53:43] they don't want to hear about revelation
[53:44] they want just what it says and we don't
[53:46] hear no more
[53:47] well you're cutting yourself off from a
[53:49] blessing
[53:51] so god rich in mercy sent us a prophet
[53:53] in the 20th century
[53:54] and to open our eyes our understanding
[53:57] so we know god by his word and by
[53:59] revelation
[54:01] now you may get some revelation without
[54:03] the word but it's going to be pretty
[54:04] narrow so
[54:06] this whole thing this study is designed
[54:07] you go and read the bible for yourself
[54:10] because we're going to jump over some of
[54:11] your favor verses guaranteed
[54:13] so you read and god will reveal himself
[54:16] by his word
[54:18] so paul stayed here
[54:20] um
[54:20] in the area over two
[54:22] two years which is that verse 10
[54:25] of 19 says here
[54:27] and he continued by the space of two
[54:29] years so that all they which dwelt in
[54:31] asia heard the word of the lord jesus
[54:32] both jews and greeks well
[54:35] we'll just
[54:36] reduce that to the predestinated because
[54:38] you know it didn't all here but the ones
[54:40] were ordained to hear it they did
[54:43] okay
[54:44] so i would suggest that you read very
[54:46] carefully
[54:47] chapter three of the uh church age book
[54:51] lots of details you see
[54:53] and
[54:55] in speaking of the early church brother
[54:56] ram says on page 86
[54:59] their persecutions and trials which they
[55:02] had a lot
[55:04] their persecutions and trials and
[55:05] patience weren't
[55:07] they were over the name
[55:09] the blessed name of jesus you know that
[55:11] is not all strange for it is the word
[55:13] and the name that brings the enemy
[55:15] pouring after us like a flood
[55:17] that mighty word which was manifested in
[55:19] healing signs and wonders and other
[55:21] demonstrations like we've seen right
[55:23] here in
[55:24] acts 19 11
[55:26] caused the pharisees to scream out for
[55:29] the death of the true believers
[55:31] and now
[55:33] that name hated and despised by the jews
[55:36] here is mocked by the culture you know
[55:38] important arrogant people as they laugh
[55:41] to think that anyone could be so foolish
[55:43] as to believe in a man who died and rose
[55:45] again and now seated in heaven so here
[55:48] were the religious persecutors the jews
[55:51] cursing this jesus
[55:53] which caused paul to leave corinth
[55:54] remember
[55:55] who to them was not he was a false
[55:57] messiah and here were the others
[55:59] laughing with the light mocking
[56:01] sarcastically at the name of a new god
[56:04] who to them wasn't a god at all
[56:07] so you see why okay you only put up so
[56:09] much of this now here's something else
[56:10] that started in that age and we'll
[56:12] continue right down through the ages and
[56:13] getting deeper and darker that his
[56:15] people
[56:16] were repudiating that name
[56:18] that means refuse to recognize to reject
[56:22] people were repudiating that name it was
[56:25] not that the true ephesian church
[56:27] that was doing it no sir it was the
[56:29] false apostles
[56:31] but they were using some of the same
[56:33] words
[56:35] see everybody has these spoken word
[56:36] books didn't go into heaven some were
[56:38] using for wrong purposes it was the
[56:40] outsider trying to get in and defiled
[56:43] the believers
[56:44] the ephesians knew that name and they
[56:47] loved it
[56:48] and that's where we've been brought back
[56:50] to to the name that's right it's all
[56:53] through the book of acts
[56:55] brother madam also says over here in the
[56:56] his uh this great servant moses
[56:59] now as moses went with that judgment
[57:01] stick before him
[57:02] that same stick tonight to the church is
[57:05] jesus christ
[57:06] if the egyptians could have ever got
[57:08] that little simple stick out of moses
[57:09] hands they would have had him whipped
[57:12] and when the devil can ever get the
[57:14] deity out of the name of jesus christ
[57:16] he's got the church whip
[57:18] and it's happening
[57:20] because we've got people in pulpits
[57:22] tonight and tomorrow that
[57:24] using some of this same word
[57:26] but they're removing the deity out
[57:28] they're putting it over here in this man
[57:30] in this organization and no power
[57:33] it's happening
[57:35] so it's still all about the name of
[57:37] jesus christ
[57:38] just like luther said a long time ago
[57:41] christ alone
[57:43] so that's a message for another day so
[57:46] verse 11 of chapter 19
[57:48] uh we won't be here too much later but
[57:50] uh let's see here chap and god wrought
[57:53] special miracles by the hands of paul
[57:56] okay so they had signs and wonders just
[57:58] like we have today
[57:59] and i remember the first time we went to
[58:02] rome
[58:03] um
[58:04] we had this woman guide she was showing
[58:06] us around and we came to you know paul's
[58:09] grave and here's a
[58:11] like a gravestone maybe the size of this
[58:13] pulpit but it's it's broke you know it's
[58:15] in pieces
[58:17] and so um
[58:18] of course
[58:19] me not revelated i guess uh i said
[58:22] whites are broken oh she said for
[58:24] centuries people
[58:26] used to come by here with a string
[58:29] and a handkerchief and a rock and they
[58:31] would tuck around and let it till it hit
[58:34] and then they bring it out and go late
[58:36] on somebody so even after death
[58:39] they were laying you know uh things were
[58:41] happening
[58:42] and um
[58:44] and so it was just a marble slab you
[58:46] know they just said apostle paul martyr
[58:49] so in the year 2000 they began work
[58:52] to
[58:53] bring the sarcophagus up from where it
[58:55] was that way down low
[58:57] make it accessible now you walk right up
[58:59] to it they're one of the churches in
[59:00] rome
[59:01] so um
[59:03] verse um
[59:04] 13-20 we have what's called the vagabond
[59:07] jews
[59:08] these were some bad boys that thought
[59:10] they were going to do some you know
[59:13] great things
[59:14] they were like freelance they weren't
[59:16] orthodox and there was a man named siva
[59:19] the chief priest among the jews it's all
[59:20] right there in the scripture
[59:22] and he knew his prophet's words very
[59:24] well see they didn't have no ipad or
[59:26] nothing they had to read and memorize
[59:28] you know
[59:29] and so he knew his prophets well he had
[59:32] seven sons they were into to exercising
[59:35] exercising evil spirits i mean you know
[59:37] removing and casting out
[59:39] and they heard about the success of paul
[59:41] up there in verse 11
[59:43] you know special miracles
[59:45] and they thought you know
[59:47] we should try that yeah
[59:49] so they found a man with an evil spirit
[59:51] he was actually insane
[59:53] and in verse 13 we adjure you in the
[59:55] name of jesus whom paul preaches see
[59:58] they were not witnesses they were
[59:59] wannabes
[1:00:01] verse 15
[1:00:03] and the evil spirit answered to them
[1:00:06] jesus i know
[1:00:07] and paul i know
[1:00:09] who are you guys
[1:00:12] and the man in whom the evil spirit was
[1:00:14] now this sir here's this man this insane
[1:00:17] man spirits in him
[1:00:19] so it says that that spirit
[1:00:21] that guy leaped on these seven guys
[1:00:24] overcame them
[1:00:26] and
[1:00:26] prevailed and they fled the house naked
[1:00:31] and wounded
[1:00:32] that's pretty powerful spirit against
[1:00:34] seven guys
[1:00:35] but that's what was happening
[1:00:38] so in the midst of all that confusion
[1:00:39] verse 17 and this was known to all the
[1:00:42] jews and greeks dwelling in ephesus
[1:00:45] and fear came upon them all and the name
[1:00:48] of the lord jesus was magnified thank
[1:00:49] you
[1:00:50] and many
[1:00:52] that believed came and confessed and
[1:00:55] showed their deeds all so now we're
[1:00:57] going to have a cleansing
[1:01:00] yeah
[1:01:01] so
[1:01:03] such a conviction in their hearts or
[1:01:04] what they'd seen that day
[1:01:07] due to the reality of christ in his word
[1:01:09] that
[1:01:10] many of them verse 19 also which used
[1:01:13] curious arts that's like magic and like
[1:01:16] crystal ball and all that kind of stuff
[1:01:18] brought their books together and burned
[1:01:20] them had a big downtown
[1:01:22] big big
[1:01:25] book burning
[1:01:28] probably say in spanish better than
[1:01:29] rhyme
[1:01:31] and uh they burned them before all men
[1:01:34] and they counted the price of them that
[1:01:35] found it to be fifty thousand pieces of
[1:01:37] silver
[1:01:39] okay
[1:01:40] that's the only way to get rid of evil
[1:01:42] spirits is a burning
[1:01:44] you don't put it in the yard sale and
[1:01:45] you know bless somebody else no you burn
[1:01:47] it
[1:01:50] so um
[1:01:52] they were serious
[1:01:54] about following the way of jesus christ
[1:01:56] you see
[1:01:57] not optional or popular but they were
[1:01:59] convicted by the holy ghost preaching
[1:02:02] and they got really serious
[1:02:04] now i had a friend up in bc when i lived
[1:02:06] up there many years ago he was a new
[1:02:08] convert
[1:02:09] there was a logger no big ol guy
[1:02:11] and so um he come to the lord
[1:02:15] and he had a big collection of big lp
[1:02:17] discs you know
[1:02:19] nice to them at the time it was nice
[1:02:22] stuff it was pretty heavy rock and roll
[1:02:23] it's what it was
[1:02:25] and so just a few weeks before somebody
[1:02:27] had offered me three thousand dollars
[1:02:28] for this collection but when you come to
[1:02:30] the lord
[1:02:31] he took his 24 inch chainsaw went
[1:02:34] through the whole mess and burned it
[1:02:36] just like these guys they were serious
[1:02:38] so it says here the value of the books
[1:02:40] was equivalent of
[1:02:42] it says 50 000 piece of silver so that
[1:02:44] would be equivalent to 50 000
[1:02:47] days wages for one man
[1:02:49] or about the equivalent of 10 men's
[1:02:51] wages for 14 years
[1:02:54] so once what they once thought was
[1:02:55] valuable and a way of life was now trash
[1:02:58] in the fire
[1:03:00] brother bran preaches the same thing in
[1:03:02] the token in desperation and a few other
[1:03:04] places
[1:03:05] get rid of it you see
[1:03:07] so anything that was contrary to jesus
[1:03:09] christ went into the fire
[1:03:12] they were serious they applied they
[1:03:14] applied the token for real and satan was
[1:03:16] on the scene
[1:03:19] but verse 20 so mightily grew the word
[1:03:21] of god and prevailed
[1:03:24] so with all this going on
[1:03:26] what's going on here verse 23
[1:03:28] at the same time there arose no small
[1:03:30] stir about that way well yeah this is
[1:03:32] going to cause quite a bit of confusion
[1:03:34] you put all this these books all this
[1:03:36] stuff in the fire and everybody's seeing
[1:03:38] it
[1:03:38] so it caused no small wave there's no
[1:03:41] small stir here in the way
[1:03:42] because a certain man named demetrius a
[1:03:45] silversmith which made silver shrines
[1:03:48] for diana
[1:03:50] uh brought no small gain into the
[1:03:52] craftsman so it was a big business
[1:03:54] you know
[1:03:55] and um
[1:03:58] because you know in john 14 6 i am the
[1:04:00] way the truth of life no man cometh to
[1:04:03] the father but by me and that one word
[1:04:05] kind of stuck with him the way you know
[1:04:07] and uh so now demetrius and his his uh
[1:04:10] people they're ray upset
[1:04:12] and um
[1:04:13] so when this is going on with the twins
[1:04:15] showed up
[1:04:16] and these guys are making idols and he
[1:04:18] was a silversmith
[1:04:20] and um see the they call it the temple
[1:04:23] of diana that was the roman name the
[1:04:25] artemis was the greek name
[1:04:28] and so they had a union meeting to
[1:04:29] discuss their future verse 25
[1:04:32] when he called together with
[1:04:35] the workmen of like occupation and said
[1:04:37] sir
[1:04:38] you know that by this craft we have our
[1:04:40] wealth
[1:04:42] moreover you see that here
[1:04:45] that not alone at ephesus but almost
[1:04:47] throughout all of asia this guy paul has
[1:04:50] persuaded and turned away many people
[1:04:53] saying that there be no
[1:04:55] no gods which are made with hands in
[1:04:58] other words you know
[1:05:00] our business is going out it's bad news
[1:05:03] so that not only our craft is in danger
[1:05:05] to be said it not but also that the
[1:05:08] temple of the great goddess diana should
[1:05:10] be despised
[1:05:12] and her magnificence should be destroyed
[1:05:14] whom all asia and the world is
[1:05:16] worshiping which is serious
[1:05:19] and when they heard these things they
[1:05:21] were all filled with wrath they were
[1:05:23] upset and they cried out saying great is
[1:05:26] diana of the ephesians
[1:05:28] but it was a silver idol
[1:05:30] it was nothing
[1:05:32] mexico is full of it and a lot of other
[1:05:34] places
[1:05:35] verse 29
[1:05:36] and the whole city was filled with
[1:05:37] confusion
[1:05:38] having caught gaius and
[1:05:41] aristichus men of macedonia paul's
[1:05:44] companions in travel
[1:05:46] they rushed with one accord into the
[1:05:48] theater in other words the court
[1:05:50] so
[1:05:52] in verses 6 12 and 17 we got great
[1:05:55] blessings of god the name of the lord
[1:05:56] jesus was magnified but now in verse 29
[1:06:00] there's mass confusion and it took two
[1:06:02] christians into custody
[1:06:04] and then brought them into the public
[1:06:06] area here in 32
[1:06:08] some therefore cried one thing some
[1:06:10] another for the assembly was confused
[1:06:13] and the more part knew not wherefore
[1:06:14] they were even come together
[1:06:16] so we've seen that right in our usa
[1:06:20] crowds of crazy people
[1:06:22] screaming and hollering throwing beer
[1:06:24] bottles and whatever
[1:06:25] not even knowing what they're what their
[1:06:27] cause is well the same thing they're
[1:06:29] just utter confusion you know so
[1:06:33] they um
[1:06:34] so we have a case here where paul he
[1:06:36] wanted to go in and help he thought man
[1:06:37] i can i can solve this i can help you
[1:06:39] all but his friends and companions
[1:06:41] stopped him now it's too dangerous no
[1:06:42] you can't do that what it was was a well
[1:06:45] well-calculated ruckus which only
[1:06:47] produced organized confusion
[1:06:50] but their attention was focused on
[1:06:51] brother alexander verse 34
[1:06:54] when they knew that he was a jew
[1:06:56] all with one voice about the space of
[1:06:58] two hours cried out great is diana of
[1:07:01] the ephesians so there's a there's a
[1:07:03] riot and they got it going you know just
[1:07:06] like some things we've seen graves got
[1:07:08] it in for for you know for two hours
[1:07:10] and um
[1:07:12] so we got this religious riot and
[1:07:13] ephesus because of the way
[1:07:16] and what it produces what's to produce
[1:07:19] god fearing christians
[1:07:21] willing to take a stand for the truth no
[1:07:23] matter what the relatives thought or
[1:07:24] believed
[1:07:26] and those are our brothers and sisters
[1:07:29] and we are the present day fulfillment
[1:07:31] of hebrews 13 8.
[1:07:33] back in 1950 brother branham said behold
[1:07:35] the lamb of god get ready wake up lift
[1:07:38] up your heads redemption is drawing nigh
[1:07:40] get ready signs and wonders appearing
[1:07:42] critics infidels waxing worse and worse
[1:07:45] it sounds like they didn't
[1:07:47] that was 1950
[1:07:50] he says we've got to put up with them
[1:07:52] but we're not looking to them we're
[1:07:53] looking to god so
[1:07:56] the believer that is secure and
[1:07:58] fortified by the word of god
[1:08:00] knows that john 1 john 4 4 is right
[1:08:03] greater is he that's in me
[1:08:05] and all this stuff out here
[1:08:07] and jesus said in luke 21 28 when all
[1:08:09] this begins to happen you look up
[1:08:12] don't worry about that you can't solve
[1:08:14] it leave it alone
[1:08:15] we're leaving soon
[1:08:17] so jesus prayed for us
[1:08:20] over here in
[1:08:21] uh i know you probably didn't think of
[1:08:23] that but in john chapter 17
[1:08:26] look over there real quick
[1:08:28] in john 17 verse 20
[1:08:31] and i'll read it out of this other bible
[1:08:33] and you can see how
[1:08:35] sometimes it helps let's see john 17 and
[1:08:38] 20.
[1:08:41] give my number straight here
[1:08:43] um
[1:08:44] verse 20.
[1:08:46] i'm not making requests for these alone
[1:08:49] in other words these 11 disciples here
[1:08:52] but also for the sake of those who
[1:08:54] believe on in me through their word
[1:08:56] that's us that's right
[1:08:58] we weren't there we don't have films we
[1:09:00] don't have nothing we got their word
[1:09:02] and that's why we believe
[1:09:04] so that they all may be one just as thou
[1:09:06] my father art with me and i am one with
[1:09:08] thee they also may be one with us so the
[1:09:11] world may believe that thou didst send
[1:09:14] me okay
[1:09:16] so you were in the thoughts of jesus
[1:09:18] christ even before he got to the cross
[1:09:22] okay
[1:09:23] he loves you
[1:09:24] how much does he love you
[1:09:26] arm is wide open
[1:09:28] for god so loved the world
[1:09:30] he gives only begotten son
[1:09:32] okay
[1:09:32] so the resurrection is the cornerstone
[1:09:35] of our message amen see everybody's got
[1:09:37] a bible they're everywhere but you have
[1:09:39] to believe in the resurrected christ and
[1:09:41] his spirit coming into us
[1:09:44] so in our story here in verse chapter 19
[1:09:46] the mayor of the town
[1:09:49] we got them all quieted down and
[1:09:52] he says you know people calm down we
[1:09:54] have laws we have legal ways of dealing
[1:09:56] with all this
[1:09:57] they're in verse
[1:09:58] 36
[1:10:01] seeing that these things cannot be
[1:10:02] spoken against you ought to be quiet do
[1:10:04] nothing grassley for we have brought
[1:10:07] hither these men which are neither
[1:10:09] robbers
[1:10:10] of churches nor blasphemers of your
[1:10:12] goddess
[1:10:13] wherefore if demetrius and his men
[1:10:16] have a matter against any man
[1:10:19] the law is open
[1:10:22] we have deputies so forth
[1:10:24] but if you inquire anything concerning
[1:10:27] other matters it shall be determined by
[1:10:28] law
[1:10:29] for we are in danger to be called in
[1:10:31] question for this day's uproar all this
[1:10:33] nonsense you know
[1:10:35] there being no cause wherefore whereby
[1:10:37] we may be uh to give account of the
[1:10:39] concourse and when he had thus spoken
[1:10:42] you dismissed the assembly okay
[1:10:45] so
[1:10:46] you got a picture of what's going on
[1:10:47] there paul's journeys weren't pleasant
[1:10:50] they didn't know they didn't have
[1:10:51] five-star hotels and he's being you know
[1:10:54] accused of things he's trying to defend
[1:10:56] himself
[1:10:58] and then we're having a lot of problems
[1:11:00] so let's look at chapter 20
[1:11:02] and then we will
[1:11:03] dismiss until tomorrow the lord tarries
[1:11:06] fair enough
[1:11:08] sun's still out
[1:11:10] dairy queen's still open so chapter 20
[1:11:13] verse 1
[1:11:14] and after the uproar was ceased
[1:11:16] paul called unto him the disciples and
[1:11:19] embraced them
[1:11:20] and departed for to go to macedonia okay
[1:11:24] so after the riot he had a meeting with
[1:11:26] the faithful they embraced they prayed
[1:11:28] went on to macedonia so the text goes on
[1:11:30] to mention several of his faithful
[1:11:32] traveling companions there's seven of
[1:11:34] them
[1:11:35] and of significance in verse six they
[1:11:37] sailed for five days to cover 200 miles
[1:11:42] now today you know we have these nice
[1:11:44] cars
[1:11:45] i mean if you really try you can go
[1:11:47] six maybe 800 miles a day
[1:11:49] so five days they sailed they didn't
[1:11:52] have no motors okay
[1:11:54] the wind was blowing right you could row
[1:11:55] and so forth
[1:11:56] and they were very patient people
[1:11:58] because they had no other choice
[1:12:00] now just for comparison you know today
[1:12:02] we have uh many choices for travel we've
[1:12:05] got all kinds of restaurants all kinds
[1:12:06] of stuff now down in brazil they have a
[1:12:09] big river it's called the amazon now
[1:12:11] where the amazon and the southern river
[1:12:12] come together the river is five miles
[1:12:15] wide it's a lot of water
[1:12:17] and so it's moving and so to get from
[1:12:20] there out to the coast it's 1200 miles
[1:12:24] and
[1:12:25] with a diesel powered barge it takes six
[1:12:27] days
[1:12:29] so even today there are places where
[1:12:31] they've got to have a lot of patience
[1:12:33] so anyway
[1:12:34] they're with the believers in troas for
[1:12:37] seven days that's in current day turkey
[1:12:40] that was a key roman seaport at the time
[1:12:43] and the working people gathered around
[1:12:45] the visitors to
[1:12:48] spend an evening
[1:12:49] together uh to hear more about the faith
[1:12:53] they were following the pattern
[1:12:54] established in the beginning coming
[1:12:56] together around the apostles teachings
[1:12:58] for fellowship for daily breaking of
[1:13:00] bread
[1:13:01] and in chapter 2 verses 42 and 46 we
[1:13:04] found whether they came together daily
[1:13:05] and brother brown says that when they
[1:13:07] came together daily they were partaking
[1:13:08] of communion
[1:13:10] because they were just following the
[1:13:11] instructions the lord said in luke 22
[1:13:13] this do in remembrance of me
[1:13:15] so chapter 20 and verse 7
[1:13:18] and upon the first day of the week
[1:13:20] when the disciples came together to
[1:13:22] break bread
[1:13:23] paul preached unto them ready to depart
[1:13:25] to depart on the morrow and he continued
[1:13:28] his speech until midnight
[1:13:30] now we're not going to stay at midnight
[1:13:31] but
[1:13:32] um
[1:13:34] he uh he was with his associates there
[1:13:37] and
[1:13:38] normally they would meet with this with
[1:13:40] the
[1:13:41] jews on the sabbath and the synagogues
[1:13:44] and these early missionaries
[1:13:46] took the gospel wherever whenever they
[1:13:48] found people gathered sometimes down at
[1:13:50] the river chapter 16
[1:13:52] but here for the first time
[1:13:55] it's mentioned that the the christians
[1:13:57] broke bread on the first day of the week
[1:14:01] two important points the early church
[1:14:04] they were significantly warned against
[1:14:06] submitting themselves to the bondage of
[1:14:09] any legalistic observance of sabbath
[1:14:11] days it's in colossians 2 and galatians
[1:14:14] 4.
[1:14:15] these early churches voluntarily chose
[1:14:18] um the first day of the week as an
[1:14:20] appropriate time to fellowship and
[1:14:22] worship
[1:14:24] here in first corinthians 16 in
[1:14:26] remembrance of
[1:14:28] the day our lord arose
[1:14:31] that's of course in the four gospels
[1:14:34] but it was a new day a new people a new
[1:14:36] creation first corinthians 5.
[1:14:38] so the observance of the first day of
[1:14:40] the week is in many early writings even
[1:14:42] irenaeus messenger to the second church
[1:14:45] age so here's paul having communion
[1:14:47] service with the saints in troas
[1:14:50] he's leaving the next day
[1:14:52] and he's preaching to a very
[1:14:54] eager bunch of disciples
[1:14:56] and he had a lot to tell him
[1:14:58] i mean i don't know about brother paul
[1:15:00] but you've had people in here that
[1:15:02] they go over the time limits you know
[1:15:04] please turn the lights off when you
[1:15:05] leave but
[1:15:06] it was different back then so he had a
[1:15:08] lot to say and they were listening
[1:15:10] and he's still preaching at midnight
[1:15:12] look at verse 8
[1:15:13] and there were many lights in the upper
[1:15:15] chamber where they were gathered
[1:15:17] together and what i like about luke's
[1:15:19] writing he includes all the details
[1:15:23] we got many lights here but nobody's
[1:15:25] about to faint nobody's you know getting
[1:15:27] tired because of the heat off the lights
[1:15:29] but back then it was fire
[1:15:31] it was torches on the wall
[1:15:33] a lot of them it says so it's warm
[1:15:36] and they're sat in the window a certain
[1:15:39] young man named uh eutecus
[1:15:42] and he fell into a deep sleep
[1:15:44] and as paul was preaching you know past
[1:15:46] 12 o'clock
[1:15:47] he went just down with sleep and he fell
[1:15:50] out of the window in the third loft
[1:15:52] yeah the third story is out there and
[1:15:54] now he's dead
[1:15:55] now what are you going to do
[1:15:57] and paul went down fell upon him and
[1:15:59] embraced him and said trouble not
[1:16:01] yourselves
[1:16:02] life is in him and we therefore come up
[1:16:05] again he they broke bread eaten and
[1:16:07] talked a long while even until the break
[1:16:09] of day and then he departed so he's been
[1:16:12] up all day
[1:16:13] preached clear up past midnight and had
[1:16:15] communion okay the sun's coming up it's
[1:16:17] time to go
[1:16:18] so
[1:16:19] y'all got dc
[1:16:21] they didn't have air conditioning either
[1:16:24] um
[1:16:25] so yeah it was um
[1:16:27] interesting times back then
[1:16:29] so um
[1:16:30] now they're headed to jerusalem for the
[1:16:32] feast of pentecost that's 50 days after
[1:16:34] the resurrection okay acts chapter 2.
[1:16:36] and from the text they were hurrying
[1:16:39] and they stopped at militants
[1:16:41] sent a messenger up into town called the
[1:16:43] elders
[1:16:44] of the church in ephesus he came down to
[1:16:46] the port to see him
[1:16:48] verses 18 through 35 it was his farewell
[1:16:51] speech to the believers the church
[1:16:52] leaders and he felt compelled he must
[1:16:55] get to jerusalem even though the saints
[1:16:57] at every stop urged him not to go
[1:17:00] now let's look at the facts uh verse 25
[1:17:04] of chapter 20
[1:17:07] verse 25 and now behold i know that you
[1:17:10] all
[1:17:11] uh among whom i have gone preaching the
[1:17:14] kingdom of god shall see my face no more
[1:17:17] oh they didn't want to hear that
[1:17:20] verse 27
[1:17:21] for i have not shunned to declare unto
[1:17:23] you all the counsel of god
[1:17:26] 28
[1:17:27] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:17:29] to all the flock and he's speaking to
[1:17:31] the church leaders here
[1:17:32] over which the holy ghost hath made you
[1:17:34] overseers to feed the church of god
[1:17:36] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:17:38] blood
[1:17:40] and we'll keep going for i know this
[1:17:43] that after my departing shall grievous
[1:17:45] wolves
[1:17:46] enter in among you not sparing the flock
[1:17:49] others come to tear things up
[1:17:50] also of your own selves
[1:17:53] many shall arise speaking perverse
[1:17:55] things
[1:17:57] and draw away disciples after them
[1:17:59] we've seen the first same thing
[1:18:01] yeah
[1:18:03] therefore watch and remember
[1:18:05] that by the space of three years i cease
[1:18:07] not to warn everyone day and night
[1:18:10] with tears
[1:18:11] and now brethren i command you i commend
[1:18:13] you to the god
[1:18:14] and to the word of his grace which is
[1:18:17] able to build you up and to give you an
[1:18:19] inheritance among all them which are
[1:18:20] sanctified i have coveted no man's
[1:18:22] silver gold so forth yay yourselves know
[1:18:26] that these hands have ministered unto my
[1:18:28] necessities in other words i made my own
[1:18:29] way
[1:18:30] and to them that were with me
[1:18:33] i have showed you all things how that so
[1:18:36] laboring you ought to support the weak
[1:18:39] and to remember the words of our lord
[1:18:40] jesus how he said it is more blessed to
[1:18:43] give than to receive
[1:18:45] and when he had thus spoken he kneeled
[1:18:47] down now they're down at they're at the
[1:18:49] they're in the sand there the boat's
[1:18:50] right there they came down from town so
[1:18:52] they're right there in the sand
[1:18:54] they kneeled down and prayed with them
[1:18:56] all
[1:18:58] and they all wept sore and fell on
[1:19:00] paul's neck kissed him sorry most of all
[1:19:04] for the words which he spake that they
[1:19:06] would see his face no more and they
[1:19:08] accompanied him into the ship
[1:19:10] so it's a sad situation but it's facts
[1:19:14] and i'm glad that we have
[1:19:15] luke that wrote all this down carefully
[1:19:18] and
[1:19:19] they were sad to see him go but he left
[1:19:21] them with the word they they had
[1:19:23] something to hold on to
[1:19:25] so that's where we're going to stop for
[1:19:26] tonight
[1:19:28] if the lord gives us breath we'll be
[1:19:29] back in the morning
[1:19:31] and we'll pick it up from there
[1:19:33] and
[1:19:34] be sure and come back so if our brother
[1:19:36] would
[1:19:37] like to come up and dismiss the service
[1:19:40] we'll start on chapter 21 tomorrow
