[41:34] compliments
[41:35] that a minister can give to a
[41:37] congregation
[41:38] and that is
[41:40] he had complete liberty
[41:44] no resistance no pushback a spirit of
[41:48] receiving and and claiming and uh uh
[41:52] just uh to to have a brother
[41:55] we see the gift of god in his life and
[41:58] that he is as it were an experience and
[42:00] and uh uh you know uh
[42:03] experienced minister

[42:23] to live the word
[42:25] doesn't want to cherry-pick the word
[42:27] just lord i want the word give me the
[42:29] word i'll i'll do
[42:30] but i also want you to remember brother
[42:32] dwayne and sister connie uh remember
[42:35] them in prayer they have um some
[42:37] situations that are upcoming uh some
[42:39] decisions that uh are to be made and
[42:43] just maybe even the next month or so
[42:46] and um
[42:48] it doesn't just concern them as brother
[42:50] dwayne's sister connie but you know kind
[42:52] of a whole context of people and just
[42:55] lift them up amen
[42:56] and uh
[42:59] brother ivan and i have been dealing
[43:01] with a little situation um
[43:03] and uh
[43:04] just ask you to pray for this unspoken
[43:08] request lord that that the lord would
[43:10] just come and anoint individuals to make
[43:13] the right decision
[43:15] there's decisions to be made
[43:17] and
[43:19] while you might say they don't impact us
[43:22] but my brother and sister i believe it's
[43:23] a true sign of real christians right the
[43:26] prophet of god said that a real
[43:28] christian
[43:29] thinks about himself only
[43:32] no
[43:33] a real christian lives
[43:36] for others
[43:38] i want to be a real christian
[43:40] i want the life of christ to be
[43:42] expressed in us that we have no other
[43:46] thought than to live for others
[43:49] but here again
[43:51] there's no bridle and reigns attached to
[43:54] others
[43:55] and so we just have to sometimes just
[43:57] pray lord
[43:58] you lead them you guide them you direct
[44:01] them
[44:02] and father you anoint them to make the
[44:04] correct decisions
[44:06] and uh so just just asking for prayers
[44:10] concerning
[44:12] uh these situations uh that they would
[44:14] make the correct decisions
[44:16] now brother andrew glover i want to get
[44:19] this out here just basically a couple
[44:20] weeks early brother andrew glover is
[44:23] coming on june the 17th which is friday
[44:27] through june 19th which is sunday
[44:29] so
[44:30] now i know there's some parents that are
[44:32] not here
[44:33] uh and and so we want to share this
[44:37] okay just make sure everyone hears
[44:39] uh june 17th i've i've got to totally
[44:42] confirm this with with uh brother andrew
[44:45] but he's a very pliable uh very led of
[44:48] the spirit and i believe if god's
[44:49] leading me in this direction he would be
[44:51] leading him in that direction
[44:53] i want june 17th friday evening now
[44:56] brother chris sent out a little
[44:58] notification and we always tie
[45:01] grace kids to grace youth
[45:04] so brother chris had said you know due
[45:06] to all these things that are happening
[45:08] we're not going to be able to have a
[45:09] service which for him was the fact that
[45:11] he's going to be gone as soon as he gets
[45:13] home he's going on to minister in other
[45:15] places
[45:16] and um
[45:18] the night of june 17th friday evening i
[45:21] want to have a youth oriented service
[45:23] we're going to ask brother andrew so
[45:25] please parents just act like this is a
[45:27] regular scheduled
[45:29] youth meeting
[45:30] and grace kids
[45:32] and
[45:34] it's here at the church yes
[45:36] and uh so let's just assume it was just
[45:40] a regular scheduled time
[45:42] and um then pray also that the lord
[45:45] would just anoint brother andrew
[45:47] something to benefit our young people
[45:49] our youth
[45:50] and
[45:51] then
[45:52] we'll have a little bit of a
[45:54] treat or finger food or whatever it is
[45:58] that you would feel led to kind of bring
[46:01] and fellowship a little bit after the
[46:02] fact
[46:04] then on june 18th which is saturday
[46:07] uh we will have it six o'clock a
[46:09] saturday evening service
[46:11] and then of course on sunday morning
[46:14] june 19th we will have a regular service
[46:17] and i find this humorous because the
[46:19] question was brought up and it just
[46:20] strikes me in the humorous sense
[46:23] when we say there's a fellowship
[46:25] that is message lingo for food
[46:28] and uh so
[46:30] we will have a fellowship after the
[46:32] sunday service
[46:34] and uh let's not be thinking about the
[46:36] food let's be thinking about the
[46:39] fellowship with our lord jesus christ
[46:41] amen
[46:42] so remember that and share that okay
[46:44] please if someone's not here uh just
[46:47] kind of as you visit and whatever
[46:50] just remember that
[46:52] amen
[46:54] so um let's just stand and go into the
[46:56] word this morning
[46:59] um
[47:02] now i hope
[47:04] that each and every one of you could
[47:06] just kind of reach back into last sunday
[47:10] and uh take a hold of what we are
[47:12] because i'm going to
[47:14] backtrack just a smidge but not much but
[47:16] we're tying this directly i cut off from
[47:19] last sunday because of time's sake i
[47:21] knew it'd be like another hour
[47:23] to to bring this out and um i've just
[47:26] been praying and the lord's been dealing
[47:28] with me to be mindful
[47:30] uh you know my brother and sister i
[47:32] heard it said like this in a little
[47:34] natural thing
[47:36] um
[47:37] that uh i thought would be nice
[47:39] it was i'd rather spend an hour
[47:42] eating good food
[47:45] than all day
[47:46] eating bad
[47:48] so
[47:49] you know lord just dealt with me lord
[47:51] help us
[47:52] to be able to just bring good food this
[47:54] gospel is good food
[47:56] amen so so it isn't the quantity as it
[48:00] is
[48:01] but the quality amen let's turn in our
[48:03] bibles to esther the fifth chapter
[48:05] verses one through three the same verses
[48:08] that we started off last sunday
[48:10] oh and i will also ask you it's just
[48:13] the lord's in control
[48:15] uh but
[48:17] mother nature has not been so kind as it
[48:21] would be in the natural
[48:23] and sister jerry and i have a
[48:25] considerable considerable amount of work
[48:28] to do out of town in mountain home uh if
[48:31] the weather will crop work
[48:33] this next week
[48:35] amen so
[48:37] brother david
[48:38] will no doubt be ministering this coming
[48:42] wednesday again
[48:43] which makes him happy because he has
[48:45] part three i think it is and uh
[48:49] so you know he he told me when i called
[48:51] him and told him my situation he goes oh
[48:54] praise the lord brother paul i i'm
[48:56] already working like on four and five
[48:59] and and so anyway just uh you know take
[49:03] take the word
[49:04] eat the word amen
[49:07] esther the fifth chapter now come to
[49:10] pass on the third day
[49:12] that esther put on her royal apparel
[49:16] now my brother and sister i don't want
[49:18] to preach this out but there's so much
[49:20] hiding here
[49:22] you see there was no royal apparel for
[49:25] you and i to put on
[49:27] until the third day
[49:31] and after the third day
[49:33] we had
[49:34] an apparel to put on that is so
[49:36] beautiful so fine so precious
[49:39] so valuable
[49:40] i say thank you lord
[49:42] thank you lord that after the third day
[49:46] hallelujah
[49:48] see god hides these things in his word
[49:50] my brother and sister because he's god
[49:53] and he changes not and you might say not
[49:56] for the the term some people say well
[49:58] they repeated themselves that's kind of
[50:00] boring but you see god repeated himself
[50:02] to prove to you and i that it's always
[50:05] been the same story
[50:07] god didn't come up with a new story in a
[50:08] new day in another age but it's the same
[50:11] story for every age for every day and
[50:14] for you and i
[50:16] that esther put on her royal apparel and
[50:18] stood in the inner court
[50:20] of the king's house over against the
[50:22] king's house
[50:23] and the king set upon his royal throne
[50:26] in the royal house over against the gate
[50:28] of the house and it was so when the king
[50:31] saw esther the queen standing in the
[50:34] court
[50:35] that she obtained favor in his sight
[50:39] and the king held out to esther the
[50:41] golden scepter
[50:43] that was in his hand
[50:45] now i want you to think about what the
[50:46] scripture says
[50:50] what's in the hand of christ
[50:55] your name
[50:57] you
[50:59] inscribed
[51:01] and he held his hand out to you and i am
[51:03] amen
[51:04] oh how beautiful
[51:07] but just as it was brother jason you
[51:09] just don't even realize this morning
[51:13] the key
[51:14] takes a hand
[51:16] and the scepter's in god's hand but we
[51:19] have
[51:20] to take a holds of that key
[51:23] and claim that in the name of jesus
[51:26] christ
[51:27] we can't just say oh praise god i'm
[51:29] saved
[51:31] everyone says that saints
[51:33] the world says that
[51:36] pool parties beach parties all kinds of
[51:39] party parties that that they're just
[51:41] partying away and saying i'm saved
[51:47] oh if you have a swimming pool in your
[51:49] backyard saints don't
[51:51] mean i mean that kind of thing
[51:53] you know don't misunderstand
[51:56] she obtained favor in his sight and the
[51:58] king held out to easter
[52:00] esther the golden scepter
[52:03] that was in his hand
[52:06] so esther stayed in the courtyard
[52:09] no sir she drew near
[52:12] the word of god says if you'll draw nigh
[52:14] to me let me just paraphrase this if
[52:16] you'll draw nigh to me i will draw nigh
[52:18] to you
[52:20] amen she couldn't stand in the courtyard
[52:22] and say oh king
[52:24] i have a petition
[52:26] she had to come
[52:28] as it were the scepter was an extension
[52:31] of the king's hand
[52:33] she had to come and touch his hand
[52:36] she had to touch him
[52:39] oh hallelujah i could get excited this
[52:41] morning
[52:48] then said the king unto her what will
[52:50] thou queen esther
[52:52] what is thy request and it shall be
[52:55] given thee
[52:56] even to the half of the kingdom
[52:59] my oh my thank you lord jesus
[53:02] father i know my heart already is
[53:04] rejoiced this morning
[53:06] lord truly as our brother jason made
[53:08] that statement as the song was playing
[53:11] would just skip the service and
[53:13] go right in the rapture
[53:15] oh lord that would be our hearts desire
[53:18] lord how we long to live in your
[53:20] presence lord jesus
[53:22] lord to feel you
[53:24] near us around us in us
[53:27] lord we thank you father for your grace
[53:29] and for your mercy guide us today i pray
[53:32] in the name of jesus christ you may be
[53:34] seated saints
[53:40] now this last sunday we were touching
[53:42] upon
[53:43] uh those things concerning esther
[53:46] and that she had come
[53:48] for such a time as that
[53:50] uh mordecai speaking those words to her
[53:53] and you know my brother and sister as
[53:55] we'll look at that we realize that
[53:57] esther had broken
[53:59] all of the traditions of men
[54:03] the scripture says that it would be by
[54:05] their traditions that men would serve
[54:07] god and esther was called of god to be a
[54:10] tradition breaker
[54:12] and while the world says oh we come to
[54:15] god through the church
[54:17] a prophet in our day come said no this
[54:19] is a personal relationship between you
[54:22] and jesus christ it is not you in the
[54:25] church or you and the prophet or you and
[54:27] a pastor or you and an evangelist it's
[54:30] you and jesus christ and so we're
[54:33] breaking the traditions that have been
[54:35] taught for thousands of years for
[54:37] decades upon decades that the church was
[54:40] the necessary component but my brother
[54:43] and sister we recognize that uh christ
[54:45] in his word amen
[54:47] is going to be magnified to us and the
[54:50] mystery of that is uh then revealed in
[54:54] our day a promise was given that it
[54:56] would be revealed in our day now so many
[54:59] people think this mystery my brother and
[55:01] sister is going to be now if you could
[55:04] just follow my little type here when the
[55:06] prophet of god was there in the cave or
[55:09] at the cave
[55:11] he was there and he's crying out to the
[55:12] lord and the wind
[55:14] blows the pages of his bible
[55:17] and he thinks well yeah the wind did
[55:20] that
[55:21] but it does it again
[55:23] you see there's no chance as it were my
[55:25] brother and sister just a stroke of luck
[55:28] or a stroke of circumstance that causes
[55:31] these things to happen it is god in his
[55:34] word fulfilling his word and so people
[55:37] would come to a position and the
[55:38] mysteries my brother and sister that are
[55:41] in the word of god that the prophet was
[55:43] to reveal in our day was not theological
[55:46] mysteries it was not intellectual
[55:48] mysteries it was christ himself but
[55:52] being the mystery revealed to you and i
[55:55] and so we are here today now some people
[55:58] would say well that's not pertinent
[55:59] that's not for this time that's not
[56:02] relevant my brother and sister we're on
[56:04] the very cusp of time and it takes a
[56:06] bright time a season
[56:09] to come to full maturity and so god's
[56:11] providing the light for the bride to
[56:14] come into maturity and i say thank you
[56:17] lord
[56:18] oh how i say thank you lord
[56:20] amen so as we see esther and preparing
[56:23] and all that happened
[56:25] breaking this tradition that was there
[56:28] we touched upon the fact that uh vashti
[56:31] was a queen who didn't want to be a wife
[56:35] my what a position that represents the
[56:38] very spirit of the age we live in right
[56:40] there saints
[56:41] they want position right seven women
[56:44] claiming one man we don't need nothing
[56:46] from you just your name
[56:48] so all she cared about was the name that
[56:51] she had being a hazardous queen
[56:54] she didn't care about the king even
[57:00] but here comes esther
[57:03] and her heart is i want to be a wife
[57:05] that's my husband
[57:07] the office i've been given happens to
[57:09] have the title of queen
[57:11] but that's not important to me because
[57:13] it's this man here
[57:16] the man christ jesus
[57:18] that's the one
[57:20] that we're in love with
[57:22] it's not a title to go around as it were
[57:24] and crow and say i'm the bride i'm the
[57:26] bride i'm the bride i'm the bride
[57:29] but to be in love with the one who made
[57:31] us the bride
[57:33] amen to the one who opened the word that
[57:35] we could see that we were the bride of
[57:37] this last age that we could see the
[57:40] revelation of the day that it would come
[57:42] in the very very darkest of days we
[57:45] could come and there's a light shining
[57:47] you say brother paul our life is
[57:49] difficult that's fine the word's been
[57:51] opened to you and you know who you are
[57:54] in jesus christ so quit dwelling on the
[57:56] circumstance and dwell on the one that's
[57:59] shining the light for you
[58:05] because you see the circumstance may
[58:07] never go away
[58:12] my
[58:14] so many examples but i want to deter
[58:16] myself this morning
[58:18] i want to just jump forward i don't know
[58:20] if that recapped this last sunday enough
[58:22] for us to step forward but i hope so now
[58:25] here in the church ages brother branham
[58:27] says this the reason that this is part
[58:29] of the eulogy of the spirit
[58:32] is because these brave soldiers
[58:37] now i want to go i want to back up for
[58:39] just a second here
[58:41] in the church age book this would
[58:43] actually have up above this as a caption
[58:46] or a header would be
[58:48] where satan's seat is
[58:52] so it is describing or giving us a
[58:56] a a clear visual picture of where
[58:59] satan's seat is now is anybody in
[59:02] question this morning where satan's seat
[59:04] is
[59:04] it's just right outside the doors of
[59:06] this church
[59:07] it's right over here in the mall and
[59:10] right over here in the theater and out
[59:12] in the park at the lake today this is
[59:14] where satan's seat is he's the god of
[59:16] this evil age and so this is his seat
[59:19] that's out here my brother and sister
[59:22] this is how close god called you to live
[59:27] to satan see
[59:30] now if god called you that close to live
[59:33] that close
[59:34] to satan's seat
[59:36] how much closer did he call you and i to
[59:40] live to his seat
[59:42] to live to his throne
[59:45] not a distant relationship my brother
[59:47] and sister i to just put it in an
[59:49] overall sense if i can walk out this
[59:52] door and bend down and put my hand on
[59:54] this parking lot out here or as it were
[59:58] on a car or whatever it is of the
[1:00:00] possessions of this life right here and
[1:00:02] i'm that close to satan see i want you
[1:00:05] to catch a revelation of how close god
[1:00:07] wants you to be to his throne to his
[1:00:10] seat to come into that place that it is
[1:00:12] so close to us it is us
[1:00:15] amen
[1:00:16] now the reason this part of the eulogy
[1:00:18] of the spirit is because these brave
[1:00:20] soldiers
[1:00:21] amen
[1:00:23] come on brave soldiers
[1:00:26] are we brave soldiers amen we're not
[1:00:29] we're not scared
[1:00:30] we're not full of fear
[1:00:32] we're not going to run and hide
[1:00:34] my brother and sister we're brave
[1:00:36] soldiers
[1:00:37] of the cross we're overcoming satan
[1:00:40] right in the midst of his own throne
[1:00:42] room
[1:00:43] now imagine this is not even on the
[1:00:45] outside as it were but now you've been
[1:00:48] invited so close satan wants to draw you
[1:00:51] so close he pulled you right into his
[1:00:53] throne room and you are living there and
[1:00:56] imagine how it must make the devil feel
[1:00:59] when you as brave soldiers of the cross
[1:01:02] are standing can you visualize that
[1:01:05] right in the midst of his throne room
[1:01:08] and you are defeating him
[1:01:10] he cannot take dominion over you he has
[1:01:13] no authority over you he cannot cause
[1:01:16] you to follow his whim and his will and
[1:01:19] you are there as brave soldiers of the
[1:01:22] cross amen and you're defeating him in
[1:01:24] the midst of his own throne room look at
[1:01:27] the world out here my brother and sister
[1:01:29] satan possessing people and people's
[1:01:31] behaviors in their life it don't matter
[1:01:33] if they're rich or they're poor it don't
[1:01:35] matter if they're smarter if they're
[1:01:36] just average none of that matters
[1:01:38] satan's got him in the throne room and
[1:01:40] he's dominating their lives
[1:01:44] and then comes along
[1:01:46] this other little girl
[1:01:49] called the bride
[1:01:51] hallelujah
[1:01:52] and she's walking right through his
[1:01:54] throne room
[1:01:56] and he's throwing every fiery dart he's
[1:01:58] throwing every suggestion every
[1:02:00] circumstance everything that he could
[1:02:03] buffet her with every stumbling stone
[1:02:08] maybe she'll be singing as it was the
[1:02:10] prophet's vision
[1:02:12] of those two churches
[1:02:14] and maybe she'll just be going through
[1:02:15] this throne ring singing onward
[1:02:18] christian soldier
[1:02:20] marching as to wait i am in the middle
[1:02:22] of a battle
[1:02:24] anybody in the middle of a battle
[1:02:26] come on saints we got to just you know
[1:02:28] don't try and hide that i'm sorry it's
[1:02:30] just a fact if you're a son or daughter
[1:02:31] of god you're in the middle of a battle
[1:02:33] and you go from one battle to another
[1:02:35] battle to another battle to another
[1:02:37] battle because you were called to
[1:02:39] possess the land you weren't called to
[1:02:41] live on the fringe of the land you
[1:02:43] weren't called to just catch one little
[1:02:45] grape from the land you were called to
[1:02:47] possess that land
[1:02:50] amen they're winning the battle through
[1:02:52] the name and the faith of jesus right in
[1:02:54] the camp
[1:02:56] of the leaders of darkness
[1:02:59] what a tremendous commendation
[1:03:04] i wonder if this kind now don't get me
[1:03:07] wrong here but i wonder if this kind of
[1:03:09] a a atmosphere
[1:03:12] is the kind of atmosphere
[1:03:14] that's open and receptive to the
[1:03:16] preaching of the word
[1:03:20] are you with me
[1:03:22] i don't think this kind of atmosphere
[1:03:25] that causes people to fold their arms
[1:03:27] and say
[1:03:29] oh wow they're preaching about being
[1:03:31] saved and having the blood and
[1:03:34] and having the holy ghost and
[1:03:36] living holy and righteous
[1:03:38] get on with it i've heard it before
[1:03:44] do you know saints those very words
[1:03:46] have been uttered inside
[1:03:49] this sanctuary
[1:03:53] get on with it
[1:03:55] what were they looking for
[1:03:58] a tradition
[1:04:01] a 15-minute tradition
[1:04:04] a tradition of if you want more people
[1:04:06] or my family to come you need to just
[1:04:09] tone it down
[1:04:11] those words have been spoken under this
[1:04:14] roof
[1:04:16] you realize how satan would try to bring
[1:04:18] the warfare to us
[1:04:21] but the prophet of god is not talking
[1:04:23] here about satan bringing the warfare
[1:04:26] inside our church but he did say
[1:04:28] that satan goes to church
[1:04:31] now we're talking to another group of
[1:04:33] people come on am i speaking to another
[1:04:35] group of people and they are going to be
[1:04:37] the people that whether satan came to
[1:04:40] church or not it doesn't matter because
[1:04:42] they're right in the midst of satan's
[1:04:44] throne room and they are living the word
[1:04:46] of the hour they are the conquerors
[1:04:48] they're the overcomer the word is
[1:04:50] talking about and it's right here oh
[1:04:52] what a tremendous commendation like the
[1:04:54] mighty men of david who invaded the camp
[1:04:57] of the enemy to bring david thirst
[1:04:59] quenching water so these giants of faith
[1:05:02] invaded the realm of satan's earthly
[1:05:04] stronghold did you see what the prophet
[1:05:06] of god said i don't believe these words
[1:05:08] are by accident people say well you know
[1:05:10] people help brother branham write this
[1:05:12] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:05:13] sister no doubt paul had those and
[1:05:16] historically so they'd help him write
[1:05:20] but that didn't mean that the spirit of
[1:05:22] god that the holy spirit was not the one
[1:05:24] controlling what was being written
[1:05:26] and people want to say well this was
[1:05:28] done that was lee vale this was this one
[1:05:30] this person forget that nonsense my god
[1:05:34] your god is in control
[1:05:37] they wrote what god wanted wrote not
[1:05:39] what they wanted wrote
[1:05:42] and you can see the evidence of that of
[1:05:44] things that they went on to write later
[1:05:46] that counter dick this
[1:05:49] they were under the anointing of the
[1:05:50] holy spirit here and they were under an
[1:05:53] earthly anointing
[1:05:54] there
[1:05:57] so don't let anybody fool you and say
[1:05:58] well those aren't brother branham's
[1:06:00] words he endorsed it
[1:06:03] amen and by preaching and exhorting
[1:06:05] brought the water of salvation to those
[1:06:06] who lived under the shadow of death now
[1:06:08] as much as these words concerning the
[1:06:11] throne and the realm of satan are part
[1:06:13] of god's praise
[1:06:16] see sometimes my brother and sister god
[1:06:17] help me i don't want to be a negative
[1:06:19] preacher
[1:06:20] but sometimes my brother and sister when
[1:06:23] god is speaking when he says those i
[1:06:25] love i chasten do you realize that was a
[1:06:27] commendation to the bride of christ that
[1:06:30] was a compliment to the bride because
[1:06:32] he's telling her if you're mine you're
[1:06:34] going to receive this correction and i
[1:06:37] believe your mind so i believe you're
[1:06:39] going to receive it
[1:06:44] you know kind of the old phrase
[1:06:47] he called me a buzzer
[1:06:50] well
[1:06:51] take me home
[1:06:53] show me what you eat
[1:06:58] come on
[1:07:05] reminds me of his sister
[1:07:09] he's come to me one time and says
[1:07:10] brother paul what does a person do
[1:07:12] my husband loves sports
[1:07:15] he gets sports illustrated
[1:07:19] but did you know once a year they have
[1:07:20] an addition
[1:07:22] that's full
[1:07:25] of half naked well not even half half
[1:07:28] probably wouldn't even be that bad
[1:07:32] swimsuit edition
[1:07:35] what do i do brother paul
[1:07:38] it's just like laying around on the
[1:07:40] floor in our house
[1:07:43] and i said well sister
[1:07:45] if you throw it away
[1:07:48] he'll miss it
[1:07:50] that's the truth of it kind of blunt
[1:07:55] so when it shows up
[1:07:59] there's not much you can do about it
[1:08:04] but what you can do because you get the
[1:08:05] mail before he comes
[1:08:07] you know take that little magazine come
[1:08:09] on saints god god works through you and
[1:08:11] i
[1:08:12] we don't have to have some supernatural
[1:08:14] stroke of lightning come down and i told
[1:08:16] her i said sister you take that thing
[1:08:18] and you put it on the counter you set
[1:08:20] your bible on top of it because the word
[1:08:22] of god said that we would put our foot
[1:08:25] or heel to the head of the serpent and
[1:08:28] you put your bible on top of that and
[1:08:30] then you say lord let this make my
[1:08:32] husband's eyes sick and weary and his
[1:08:35] heart vomit over this filth and you know
[1:08:38] what happened is he comes home he comes
[1:08:40] home and it's laying there on the
[1:08:42] counter and he looks at that and goes
[1:08:43] you know why don't you just throw that
[1:08:45] out
[1:08:46] a one-day answer to prayer
[1:08:52] because
[1:08:53] the word
[1:08:54] not her
[1:08:55] get this saints she didn't get over
[1:08:57] there oh what am i gonna do what am i
[1:08:58] gonna do how do i cure this heterosexual
[1:09:00] she'd done that for years it never
[1:09:01] changed a single thing but when she took
[1:09:03] the word of god and she put it on top of
[1:09:06] that and said in the name of jesus
[1:09:08] christ
[1:09:10] possess that land
[1:09:12] come on are you with me let's possess
[1:09:14] that land
[1:09:16] we don't have to let satan roam through
[1:09:18] our house we don't have to let satan
[1:09:21] conquer our domain
[1:09:24] oh hallelujah
[1:09:26] amen these giants of faith is a
[1:09:28] compliment to you
[1:09:30] invaded the realm of satan's earliest
[1:09:31] song stronghold preaching exhorting you
[1:09:34] say but i'm not a preacher yes you are
[1:09:36] not a one of us here today that's not a
[1:09:38] preacher
[1:09:39] amen we'll share the gospel in one form
[1:09:42] or another
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:48] now as much as these words concerning
[1:09:50] the throne realm of satan are part of
[1:09:51] god's praise for his elect they actually
[1:09:53] set the stage for the denouncement of
[1:09:56] the evil that has gained supremacy in
[1:09:58] the church
[1:10:05] i promised i wouldn't be negative today
[1:10:08] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:10:10] sister
[1:10:12] it's creeping
[1:10:13] in
[1:10:14] to the message
[1:10:17] but praise god
[1:10:19] could i jump and shout i can't kick my
[1:10:21] heels i'm afraid i'd fall down
[1:10:24] look at this my brother and sister
[1:10:26] i don't care i have focused some in the
[1:10:29] past and i may in the future again if

[1:10:41] people according to the word that will
[1:10:46] overcome

[1:10:51] going on out here and what we call the
[1:10:54] message there's a people who are going

[1:11:00] the evil that is coming to the church i
[1:11:02] say lord help me to be that announcement
[1:11:05] lord i don't want to be what a part of
[1:11:08] the evil that's coming into the message
[1:11:10] of the hour i want to be that and it
[1:11:13] won't be because we stand on a chair and
[1:11:15] say woe unto all you that got these
[1:11:18] spirits it will be our life
[1:11:21] it will be our life it will be the
[1:11:23] atmosphere around us oh i don't need to
[1:11:26] make that much of it i didn't realize
[1:11:28] when i was saying that what it was but
[1:11:30] i'm telling you when a preacher comes
[1:11:32] and he leaves and says there is such a
[1:11:35] warm welcoming spirit in your church and

[1:11:48] midst and they have shared with me when
[1:11:50] they left brother paul there is a warm
[1:11:53] welcoming spirit in your church and i
[1:11:55] would like to just bust the buttons yes
[1:11:58] but it's not me it's the holy ghost in
[1:12:01] you
[1:12:02] hallelujah it's not the preacher that
[1:12:05] makes this a warm welcoming spirit it's
[1:12:08] a holy ghost in you
[1:12:10] oh thank you lord
[1:12:12] amen

[1:12:47] in the church
[1:12:49] my brother and sister
[1:12:51] your testimony
[1:12:53] your testimony
[1:12:56] is what we'll denounce
[1:13:00] we don't have to come out post something
[1:13:02] on the church site
[1:13:05] denouncing all of this that and the
[1:13:07] other
[1:13:08] just let the word live yes
[1:13:11] lord let the word live in me
[1:13:14] oh as that song says amen just let it
[1:13:17] live in me lord
[1:13:18] hallelujah
[1:13:20] now look at this
[1:13:22] he's talking about in in this quote he's
[1:13:24] talking about brave soldiers
[1:13:27] amen my brother and sister
[1:13:30] it is not as it were
[1:13:32] that we would come
[1:13:34] and say well look i i'm brave
[1:13:38] you know my daddy raised me up
[1:13:40] with some you know might say different
[1:13:42] thoughts that he shared
[1:13:44] one of them as i've shared with you in
[1:13:45] the past he says son
[1:13:47] when people tell you that they're humble
[1:13:50] they're not
[1:13:54] and me being
[1:13:56] i say this in all kindness because
[1:13:58] sister sue is
[1:13:59] very dear to me
[1:14:01] through the years has bought me a lot of
[1:14:03] books of history
[1:14:06] warfare
[1:14:11] and over and over the story is repeated
[1:14:14] the loud
[1:14:15] and the boisterous
[1:14:17] are not the brave
[1:14:22] take it all back through the history of
[1:14:24] mankind and warfare
[1:14:27] little scrawny
[1:14:30] little
[1:14:31] humble real actually humble
[1:14:34] in the time of warfare
[1:14:36] they're the ones that are like i have
[1:14:38] something to fight for
[1:14:41] the loud and the boisterous my brother
[1:14:42] and sister
[1:14:44] are trying to present an image
[1:14:46] that they hope they can live up to
[1:14:51] i just want to live up to it
[1:14:54] i may not seem like much you might not
[1:14:56] seem like much
[1:14:57] but what we want to do is live up to it
[1:14:59] amen we want to live at that level that
[1:15:01] god called us
[1:15:03] amen it'd be nice wouldn't it as it were
[1:15:05] to walk around in our queenly robes and
[1:15:08] everyone would give honor to us because
[1:15:10] we're a queen
[1:15:11] but my brother and sister how it would
[1:15:13] be
[1:15:15] to serve
[1:15:17] how would be to serve our husband
[1:15:19] our bridegroom
[1:15:21] without boasting
[1:15:24] without telling the world
[1:15:26] we've done some great deed
[1:15:29] lord help us
[1:15:30] amen
[1:15:32] amen but it's not a thing of the past
[1:15:34] there's there's brave soldiers sitting
[1:15:36] right here in this congregation this
[1:15:38] morning men are the prayer warriors
[1:15:40] they're the ones that want to help
[1:15:41] they're the ones that would go do
[1:15:43] something for someone they're the ones
[1:15:44] who care about those around them
[1:15:50] but having said that i can't fix your
[1:15:52] problems and you can't fix mine
[1:15:55] so there's only one that we can go to
[1:15:57] if we need to have our problems fixed
[1:16:00] amen so it is
[1:16:03] look my brother and sister this is a
[1:16:05] time esther coming she came to her king
[1:16:08] to her husband she didn't necessarily
[1:16:10] come you know when mordecai or uncle
[1:16:13] comes and says you know it ain't even
[1:16:14] going to save you if you keep silent it
[1:16:16] won't save you
[1:16:19] you understand why you wouldn't save her
[1:16:20] because when the king's decree would go
[1:16:22] forward whatever the king had put his
[1:16:25] ring and the seal upon it it had to take
[1:16:30] place so if there was a condemnation as
[1:16:32] it was in this case of the jews it
[1:16:35] wouldn't even save the queen
[1:16:38] wow
[1:16:39] you imagine what it would been for
[1:16:42] hazards to
[1:16:44] realize my wife
[1:16:47] is jewish
[1:16:50] but i made the decree and
[1:16:52] under the law of the medes and persians
[1:16:54] i i cannot
[1:16:56] reverse that
[1:17:01] do you realize haman didn't even know
[1:17:04] esther was a jew
[1:17:07] satan doesn't know who the bride of
[1:17:08] christ is
[1:17:11] so he's just going to put a death
[1:17:12] sentence
[1:17:14] on all humanity
[1:17:17] trying to get the bride
[1:17:20] oh think about it
[1:17:21] it's pretty deep subject we don't have
[1:17:23] enough time today
[1:17:25] amen so you look at this and realize now
[1:17:28] that that this little decree
[1:17:30] that haman was searching for
[1:17:32] amen was there and esther
[1:17:36] when she realized one she knew who she
[1:17:39] was come on the prophet of god said
[1:17:40] we'll take a rapture when we know who we
[1:17:42] are
[1:17:43] so some of us don't know who we are
[1:17:45] because we haven't taken a rapture yet
[1:17:47] amen so we want to come to the place of
[1:17:50] the knowledge of the word that we would
[1:17:52] know who we are and the kind of knowing
[1:17:56] who we are comes with being bold enough
[1:17:58] to put on our royal garments and to walk
[1:18:00] into the presence of almighty god and to
[1:18:02] be able to name our decree our desire
[1:18:05] our wishes to him and it's there not as
[1:18:08] beggars not crying not weeping not
[1:18:10] begging but coming boldly to the throne
[1:18:12] of god to be able to say you know what i
[1:18:15] finally caught a revelation i have my
[1:18:17] husband's here amen he cares about it
[1:18:21] you go on we'll preach about it so you
[1:18:23] know but we're going to go on a little
[1:18:25] bit i just felt anointed this morning
[1:18:26] early today i was just like i'm done
[1:18:29] with this and then i got an anointing i
[1:18:30] was like no there's more to come but my
[1:18:32] brother and sister you'll come and well
[1:18:35] i might as well just encourage you to do
[1:18:36] it you go read nestor and it comes to a
[1:18:39] time that hazara says to her tell me
[1:18:41] what to do
[1:18:44] do you get that revelation
[1:18:46] come on bride do you get that revelation
[1:18:49] almighty god says whatever you ask in my
[1:18:52] name i shall do it i shall give it to
[1:18:56] you it come a time a hazard says to
[1:18:58] esther tell me what you want done
[1:19:02] and we are sitting here as the bride of
[1:19:03] christ now this is the point the rubber
[1:19:06] hits the road is that how we're
[1:19:08] approaching god
[1:19:12] i think there's more beggars amongst us
[1:19:16] than esther's
[1:19:20] but we'll save that just a moment maybe
[1:19:23] for another service another day i don't
[1:19:24] know
[1:19:26] now look at this
[1:19:28] this little brides only begin to fight
[1:19:29] for a people
[1:19:31] i said this to you last sunday i say it
[1:19:33] again i am your people.
[1:19:36] and you are my people
[1:19:38] amen and we are god's people
[1:19:40] amen there should be no one greater on
[1:19:42] the earth to fight for than these people
[1:19:46] amen of who we are
[1:19:48] hallelujah now look at this
[1:19:50] uh ii corinthians oh i think i skipped
[1:19:54] i might have skipped
[1:19:56] oh let's just go forward brother ivan
[1:19:59] would go forward i think i had them
[1:20:00] scriptures turned around maybe
[1:20:04] yeah second corinthians what we want to
[1:20:06] go to
[1:20:18] is there

[1:20:22] that's all right just turn your bibles
[1:20:23] real quick you you know the scripture
[1:20:26] for though we walk
[1:20:28] ii corinthians 10 3 and 4 though we walk
[1:20:30] in the flesh we don't war we do not war
[1:20:33] after the flesh for the weapons of our
[1:20:35] warfare are not carnal
[1:20:38] have you ever come on saints just be
[1:20:40] real today if we ever just felt really
[1:20:42] frustrated with a brother or sister uh
[1:20:44] we felt really frustrated with a family
[1:20:47] we've been really frustrated with the
[1:20:48] preacher we've been really frustrated
[1:20:50] with the deacon we've been really
[1:20:51] frustrated with uh well let's not go on
[1:20:56] you realize that's not you can say well
[1:20:59] well it was it was how they did this or
[1:21:01] what they did here what they did there
[1:21:03] come on remember this is not flesh
[1:21:06] this is not flash this is the devil and
[1:21:08] they're not perfect christ is the
[1:21:10] perfect one amen so you've got to get
[1:21:12] rid of that attitude
[1:21:14] and then come and say but that's my
[1:21:16] brother and i'll fight for my brother so
[1:21:18] lord if the preacher's spitting and
[1:21:19] stumbling and he's kind of losing his
[1:21:21] train of thought and stumbling around
[1:21:24] i'm not going to criticize him i'm going
[1:21:25] to say lord help that man because he's
[1:21:28] just a man
[1:21:29] help him lord
[1:21:31] and when we start doing that we look
[1:21:32] around see somebody in the church
[1:21:34] struggling a little bit and we'll get
[1:21:35] down and say you know i'd like to slap
[1:21:37] him silly
[1:21:39] but i'll pray for him instead
[1:21:41] because whatever's happening in their
[1:21:43] life is not flesh and blood it's of
[1:21:46] principalities and powers of darkness
[1:21:48] and i
[1:21:50] whoa can we have this kind of confidence
[1:21:52] i'm going to walk right in the midst of
[1:21:54] the throne room of satan and i'm going
[1:21:57] to rebuke satan get your hands off my
[1:22:00] brother get your hands off my sister get
[1:22:03] your hands off of our youth get your
[1:22:05] hands off of this
[1:22:08] oh but i don't know if i do that you
[1:22:10] know i'm gonna have a terrible month
[1:22:12] following
[1:22:13] you're gonna have a terrible month
[1:22:14] following regardless of what you do
[1:22:16] because this is warfare
[1:22:18] oh the devil might be sitting back you
[1:22:21] know what he'll do
[1:22:22] amen he'll set back and he'll watch and
[1:22:25] say now how are they overcoming
[1:22:27] well i noticed they've been reading
[1:22:28] their bible
[1:22:30] well i'll tell you what i'll do
[1:22:32] i'll get them some sick children
[1:22:35] i'll break everything they own i'll make
[1:22:38] it to when they get up in the morning
[1:22:40] they put their clothes on and they dash
[1:22:41] out the door because they got more
[1:22:43] problems than they can fix
[1:22:47] so

[1:23:22] his life
[1:23:24] he just preached recently down there in
[1:23:26] phoenix
[1:23:28] evening life fellowship
[1:23:31] and he's bringing it from the avenue of
[1:23:33] a football player
[1:23:36] and when you're there
[1:23:38] and the other team
[1:23:40] is starting to dominate you
[1:23:42] they've figured out your game plan
[1:23:46] you don't just sit there
[1:23:50] you adjust
[1:23:53] you change your game plan
[1:23:57] so that satan
[1:23:59] cannot block it
[1:24:04] well i just don't have time to pray
[1:24:15] okay
[1:24:19] sorry coach we lost the game i didn't
[1:24:21] have time to throw a pass i had to run
[1:24:23] over here and i had to run over there i
[1:24:24] had to knock this guy down and i had to
[1:24:27] i just didn't have time to score a
[1:24:29] touchdown
[1:24:33] no
[1:24:34] you're not going to see a football
[1:24:35] player
[1:24:36] quarterback do that
[1:24:39] if they figure out the pass you run they
[1:24:41] figure out the run you pass
[1:24:45] it's a very nice service brother brought
[1:24:47] it out very simply
[1:24:48] but it's profound
[1:24:51] i don't have time
[1:24:52] you don't have time
[1:24:53] well at the minimum as we're driving all
[1:24:56] over town
[1:24:58] put the bible on
[1:24:59] because said
[1:25:01] but did you know that when the scripture
[1:25:03] said
[1:25:05] to dig into the word of god
[1:25:07] they weren't talking about mr scoby
[1:25:10] they were talking about you
[1:25:12] digging into the word of god
[1:25:15] well that's the only thing i got time
[1:25:17] for
[1:25:19] well fine did you eat today
[1:25:22] yes
[1:25:25] read your bible
[1:25:27] the food natural is secondary
[1:25:30] change the game plan
[1:25:32] because we are here my brother and
[1:25:34] sister
[1:25:35] to defeat
[1:25:37] amen
[1:25:38] this for the weapons of our warfare are
[1:25:41] not carnal but mighty through god to the
[1:25:44] pulling down of satan's throne room
[1:25:49] that's what we're doing because you see
[1:25:50] every day do you ever you know like
[1:25:52] stretch your back and feel a little pop
[1:25:54] that might have been the devil with
[1:25:56] jackhammer trying to put a foundation in
[1:25:57] your
[1:25:58] in your life
[1:26:01] he's there
[1:26:03] i'm going to go ahead and build a throne
[1:26:05] room here
[1:26:07] in this one
[1:26:08] and that one
[1:26:10] and if we allow him to my brother and
[1:26:12] sister
[1:26:13] he will come
[1:26:15] and let me reverse this scripture to you
[1:26:18] the
[1:26:19] bigger
[1:26:20] the foundation of the throne room
[1:26:23] the more
[1:26:24] we will walk
[1:26:25] after the flesh
[1:26:27] if we look out and see ourselves walking
[1:26:30] after the flesh
[1:26:32] then there is something wrong the word
[1:26:35] is not working mightily in us
[1:26:38] we've given satan time to start building
[1:26:41] an extension a porch to his throne room
[1:26:44] in our life
[1:26:46] can we say amen
[1:26:48] amen you see this warfare is not going
[1:26:51] to end till the end
[1:26:53] that's the truth of it now look at this
[1:26:56] my brother and sister we're going to
[1:26:57] have to just call it good here i hope
[1:26:59] something's been valuable to you this
[1:27:01] morning but look at this now haman
[1:27:04] i've got in my notes here quotation mark
[1:27:07] satan
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:09] haman has already tried to pass judgment
[1:27:12] see this is how haman come he come into
[1:27:15] the king and he has got a petition that
[1:27:17] he's going to lay before the king and
[1:27:20] he's expecting because he is trusted
[1:27:23] right
[1:27:24] amen look at lucifer's position he was
[1:27:27] trusted he knows how god works
[1:27:31] and he was just going to have the king
[1:27:32] just put a petition there before him and
[1:27:35] the king and his busyness was going to
[1:27:37] say now what is this oh there's some
[1:27:39] there's some troublemakers
[1:27:41] come on i hope you catch this maybe even
[1:27:43] see a little humor in it hey there's
[1:27:46] some troublemakers in the kingdom
[1:27:48] they're the ones that keep upsetting my
[1:27:51] plans
[1:27:52] why don't you go ahead and sign this and
[1:27:55] we'll judge those people
[1:27:58] and when we judge those people we shall
[1:28:01] punish those people
[1:28:06] you know why satan haman could do this
[1:28:09] because he already knew what the
[1:28:10] previous laws and decrees he already
[1:28:12] knew what the old testament was he knew
[1:28:15] what would be manifested in the new
[1:28:16] testament and he says oh the man
[1:28:19] sister darren i was talking about this
[1:28:21] on the way to church the man that
[1:28:22] looketh upon a woman to lust after her
[1:28:25] has committed adultery already and the
[1:28:27] scripture says an adulteress won't enter
[1:28:30] the kingdom of god so what i'm going to
[1:28:33] do is i'm going to pray them up and down
[1:28:34] the streets i hope this is not too
[1:28:35] personal to whatever i'll pray them up
[1:28:37] and down the streets
[1:28:40] i'll put them in front of them
[1:28:41] everywhere they go they can't even pump
[1:28:42] gas in their car i'll put them in front
[1:28:44] of them
[1:28:46] and then because they're men
[1:28:50] they're done they're toast
[1:28:53] but you see god put a special anointing
[1:28:55] in the bride of christ
[1:28:56] an anointing that we will stand
[1:28:58] correction in that beautiful can someone
[1:29:01] say thank you lord that we can come and
[1:29:03] say lord i receive the correction
[1:29:06] forgive me lord but you see satan's
[1:29:08] trying to pass judgment upon you he's
[1:29:12] trying to already put you in a place
[1:29:14] that puts you in the pit
[1:29:16] with him he can read the word he knows
[1:29:18] he's going to the pit he's going to take
[1:29:20] as many with him as he can and so he
[1:29:22] does that but what he doesn't realize is
[1:29:25] a special anointing and because he's
[1:29:27] never felt it
[1:29:29] come on
[1:29:31] he's never felt that anointing to
[1:29:33] receive correction or there would be no
[1:29:35] lucifer
[1:29:37] there would be no devil
[1:29:39] if he'd ever felt that anointing he
[1:29:42] would have sat there in heaven and said
[1:29:43] forgive me i tried to i tried to turn
[1:29:46] these angels against you almighty i i
[1:29:49] forgive me but she has never felt that
[1:29:51] anointing he don't know what it is
[1:29:55] and you realize it's not an anointing in
[1:29:57] the mind
[1:29:58] it's a moi anointing in the soul
[1:30:01] and so he can't intellectually figure
[1:30:03] that out because intellectualism will
[1:30:05] not give you an answer in the soul
[1:30:07] and so while he tries to figure this
[1:30:08] whole equation out saint he can hear our
[1:30:11] voice speaking this but because he's
[1:30:13] never been anointed that seed was never
[1:30:15] placed in him he cannot repent
[1:30:19] otherwise when it come up to the edge of
[1:30:21] the pit
[1:30:22] in the judgment
[1:30:23] he'd be saying forgive me
[1:30:25] and god would be obligated by his own
[1:30:27] word to forgive him
[1:30:31] so but he doesn't really know who who
[1:30:33] this is he didn't know that esther was a
[1:30:36] jew
[1:30:37] amen but haman knew if he could get a
[1:30:39] king's decree it would judge all and my
[1:30:42] brother and sister here is the king's
[1:30:43] decree right here and the king has
[1:30:46] already passed judgment on her
[1:30:49] on esther
[1:30:50] this is where haman misses it
[1:30:54] he doesn't know who she is he doesn't
[1:30:55] know the connection that is there he
[1:30:58] doesn't can't figure it out he has no
[1:31:00] access to the lamb's book of life
[1:31:03] you have access to the lamb's book of
[1:31:05] life by the holy ghost
[1:31:07] amen that god confirming in you i have
[1:31:10] saved you i have claimed you i have
[1:31:13] sealed you and satan cannot get in that
[1:31:16] book he doesn't know who he's dealing
[1:31:18] with but he looks around and says
[1:31:19] they're kind of displaying they're kind
[1:31:21] of displaying
[1:31:23] yeah they're not
[1:31:26] coming in flip-flops and
[1:31:27] baggy shorts and tank tops to church
[1:31:34] why is it that these people choose to
[1:31:36] wear royal garments
[1:31:39] why are they
[1:31:40] dressing
[1:31:43] you notice that i hope you don't find
[1:31:45] this as mockery
[1:31:47] but you notice that esther didn't come
[1:31:48] in
[1:31:49] with a beach towel an umbrella and a
[1:31:51] cooler
[1:31:52] and invite the king to the beach
[1:31:56] hope brother jason
[1:31:59] i'll tell you about jumped out of my
[1:32:01] seat i think i maybe didn't make a
[1:32:02] little bit of noise i was containing
[1:32:05] myself my brother and sister look at
[1:32:07] this now she was anointed to go right to
[1:32:09] the throne and she set the stage for
[1:32:11] deliverance by her approach to the
[1:32:14] throne
[1:32:15] amen she followed that amen now look at
[1:32:17] this i'll catch that in just a minute
[1:32:19] for you i want to make this bold
[1:32:21] statement satan is exposed to the
[1:32:24] believer amen it is not that we have a
[1:32:27] mystery of what's going on around us
[1:32:30] amen esther a type of the bride anointed
[1:32:32] desperation
[1:32:34] amen came to the throne room and she met
[1:32:36] the king in there right now look at this
[1:32:38] the prophet of god brings to us a vision
[1:32:41] that some people still have it believing
[1:32:43] that brother branham must come back to
[1:32:44] fulfill this uh believing these things
[1:32:47] must be but in the tent vision brother
[1:32:49] branham tells he shares this god speaks
[1:32:51] to him says i'll meet you in there but
[1:32:54] it'll be a mystery
[1:32:56] and in that vision they come out and
[1:32:58] they're asking them what happened in
[1:32:59] there
[1:33:01] i don't even know you imagine how weird
[1:33:03] that must be sister sue you was just in
[1:33:05] a tent you walked in the door on this
[1:33:06] side that little room
[1:33:09] you walked in the door on this side
[1:33:10] maybe you walked in there
[1:33:14] but mostly that
[1:33:16] is in here
[1:33:19] you walked in there and you walked out
[1:33:20] free you walked out delivered you walked
[1:33:23] out healed and they're saying what
[1:33:24] happened you can't describe it
[1:33:27] you can't describe it i don't know
[1:33:29] i was under i was under depression i was
[1:33:32] under anxieties and oppressions and i
[1:33:34] was under this stress thought i was
[1:33:36] gonna blow up thought about taking my
[1:33:37] own life all these different things and
[1:33:39] i come out of here and now i have such a
[1:33:41] liberty what happened
[1:33:42] i don't know
[1:33:44] i don't know i can't i can't even tell
[1:33:46] you
[1:33:47] saints i can tell you and i don't mean
[1:33:49] to speak it about me but it's personal
[1:33:50] to me you know i've shared with you
[1:33:52] before how i had that growth in my foot
[1:33:54] and and you know went in there in in in
[1:33:57] uh meetings there in cloverdale and in
[1:33:59] new year's
[1:34:01] the presence of god was so strong
[1:34:04] brother biscuit got up and said now
[1:34:06] remember the prophet of god said
[1:34:08] it was a communion service
[1:34:10] he said in times like this
[1:34:12] it's a good time to receive your healing
[1:34:15] and i remember that's all it took saints
[1:34:18] nothing boasting of paul but there was
[1:34:20] an anointing there the words were spoken
[1:34:22] i decided i believe it i lifted my hands
[1:34:24] and i said thank you lord for healing me
[1:34:27] and it was only just a minute or two
[1:34:28] later this great heat swept up through
[1:34:31] my foot and up my leg and come out
[1:34:34] and three days after we arrived home
[1:34:37] i had no more growth in the bottom of my
[1:34:39] foot gone
[1:34:41] that's the god we serve but what satan
[1:34:44] would want to do is for you to say well
[1:34:46] that might apply to somebody else
[1:34:48] how could i ever make that claim because
[1:34:50] i snapped at my husband i was mean to my
[1:34:53] wife i did this or i did that no my
[1:34:56] brother and sister come boldly today
[1:35:00] come boldly for what the need is don't
[1:35:02] sit here defeated come and say i am not
[1:35:06] worthy but i serve one that is worthy
[1:35:09] and i will serve him
[1:35:10] hallelujah
[1:35:12] amen
[1:35:13] the tent vision i'll i'll meet you in
[1:35:15] there
[1:35:16] amen
[1:35:19] oh my goodness brother jason
[1:35:22] if i had it to do over again i might
[1:35:24] just jump out of my chair and go run
[1:35:25] around this church and freak all of you
[1:35:27] out
[1:35:28] because some of you would be freaked out
[1:35:30] you wouldn't know what to do brother
[1:35:31] paul's lost it
[1:35:32] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:35:34] sister when brother jason brought that
[1:35:36] song and right here written in my notes
[1:35:38] not one word changed from that moment to
[1:35:41] now but you see as she is there in the
[1:35:44] presence of the king and he has told her
[1:35:46] i'll give you anything you want even to
[1:35:48] the half
[1:35:50] of my kingdom
[1:35:52] oh come on saints get this
[1:35:55] she said i want you to come to my house
[1:35:59] i want you to come to my house that's
[1:36:02] where i want to meet you and look at
[1:36:05] this now he comes to her house and she
[1:36:08] doesn't just unload on him amen now this
[1:36:12] is in the day it's in the age it's not
[1:36:14] our age don't take this home and think
[1:36:16] this is the way to do it but they're
[1:36:18] there sharing a glass of wine and a
[1:36:20] little dis danger dessert and whatever
[1:36:22] it is and then the king says what is it
[1:36:25] wife
[1:36:26] what is it queen esther that you want
[1:36:30] well i finally got you in my house and i
[1:36:32] want you to do this and this and this
[1:36:34] and this and this no sir
[1:36:36] what did she do
[1:36:38] it would be pleasing to you king
[1:36:41] he tells her
[1:36:43] esther
[1:36:44] i can just see it play silent i don't
[1:36:46] believe the emphasis is in the words
[1:36:47] that displays this to us but he was
[1:36:49] there going look i've already promised
[1:36:51] you half the kingdom
[1:36:53] just tell me what you want up to the
[1:36:54] half of the kingdom
[1:36:58] would you come back to my house
[1:37:00] tomorrow
[1:37:02] i have a need
[1:37:04] i have something i want to
[1:37:06] but it's pretty big and instead of just
[1:37:08] coming and looking ungrateful and acting
[1:37:10] ungrateful then i just bombard you the
[1:37:13] minute you come into my house i i want
[1:37:15] to just sit here and enjoy this time
[1:37:17] with you
[1:37:19] but i would like you to come back
[1:37:20] tomorrow
[1:37:23] my brother what'd she do
[1:37:25] she made her house
[1:37:28] an extension
[1:37:30] of the throne room
[1:37:32] she didn't separate that and say well
[1:37:35] you know
[1:37:38] now i'm not speaking ill of my sisters
[1:37:40] my wife or anyone
[1:37:42] it's just the way god made men and women
[1:37:48] i'm not
[1:37:49] advocating
[1:37:51] nagging your husband
[1:37:54] but sometimes men
[1:37:56] do need a little help
[1:37:58] get off the couch
[1:38:02] huh i know which ones have spoken that
[1:38:05] word so i can see it in your faces
[1:38:09] and i say that with humor
[1:38:12] jerry and i've had these towel
[1:38:15] for the common bath in our house
[1:38:18] so long i forgot all about them she
[1:38:20] finally got tired of waiting and took
[1:38:21] them off the shelf and put them away
[1:38:23] somewhere and that really got them off
[1:38:25] my mind
[1:38:27] but you see the other
[1:38:28] evening she's like paul
[1:38:31] would you hang the towel racks in the
[1:38:33] bathroom
[1:38:36] and i'm thinking i'm tired i don't want
[1:38:38] to hang towel racks
[1:38:42] she spoke the right word saints
[1:38:45] no supper for you then
[1:38:49] no no
[1:38:51] honey it'll only take a minute
[1:38:53] and i'll help you
[1:38:56] ah
[1:38:57] i can do that
[1:38:59] guess what we have towel racks in the
[1:39:00] bathroom
[1:39:02] because it's about approach
[1:39:05] it's all about the approach
[1:39:07] and esther didn't come and say now look
[1:39:09] this thing here and this is there and
[1:39:11] that no she says look
[1:39:13] i i had you come but tomorrow night
[1:39:18] i want you to come to my banqueting
[1:39:20] table
[1:39:24] um
[1:39:27] imagine
[1:39:29] we could invite him to our house
[1:39:33] 24 hours a day seven days a week
[1:39:37] and you know what our banquet table that
[1:39:39] we can offer him
[1:39:42] is our praise
[1:39:43] and our worship
[1:39:47] don't have to spend hours slaving over a
[1:39:49] stove
[1:39:50] and trying to arrange this
[1:39:53] it reminds me of a sister in chile
[1:39:55] i don't know what she's went on at one
[1:39:57] time she was going to make a catering
[1:39:59] business
[1:40:00] but this sister went
[1:40:03] and uh
[1:40:05] become
[1:40:06] all this culinary arts i couldn't think
[1:40:08] of the word she studied culinary arts
[1:40:11] and we were invited
[1:40:14] were they related or she just a sister
[1:40:15] to them she's related to them
[1:40:18] and
[1:40:19] we're invited to their house i'm hungry
[1:40:23] i'm thinking okay i've heard this
[1:40:24] reputation this sister she's such a good
[1:40:26] cook
[1:40:28] she went to school she's got a degree
[1:40:30] plaque on the wall all this stuff
[1:40:32] and we got there
[1:40:34] i'm ready to tear into the food and
[1:40:36] they're like sit down it's not ready yet
[1:40:41] he told us to be here at
[1:40:43] seven o'clock i just kind of thought i'd
[1:40:44] just come in and slide into a seat and
[1:40:50] after a little while
[1:40:52] here come
[1:40:54] of all things
[1:40:55] the tomatoes
[1:40:57] or as they say tomatoes
[1:41:00] is that right jolene
[1:41:05] only they all looked like roses
[1:41:10] and they were beautiful i was like are
[1:41:11] we supposed to eat these
[1:41:14] that almost
[1:41:15] seems
[1:41:16] bad we're going to eat the decorations
[1:41:20] and then there was carrots that were cut
[1:41:22] up into different things and there was
[1:41:24] different things you know the only thing
[1:41:25] they didn't make a design out of was a
[1:41:27] broccoli
[1:41:30] and that kind of sent a message to me
[1:41:32] there's nothing beautiful about broccoli
[1:41:37] but
[1:41:38] the thing was see
[1:41:41] we sometimes
[1:41:43] make this
[1:41:44] assumption
[1:41:46] i'll slide into church at the last
[1:41:48] minute
[1:41:50] oh let's see monday i got to make the
[1:41:52] house payment and i got to do this i
[1:41:53] need to mow the yard

[1:42:14] house tomorrow also
[1:42:16] i want to have a conversation with you
[1:42:17] again but sometimes the conversations
[1:42:20] are serious
[1:42:21] sometimes they're deep
[1:42:23] sometimes there's fears and anxieties
[1:42:26] and things attached to the conversation
[1:42:29] our problem is
[1:42:30] we come sliding right in
[1:42:32] husband i need you to do this need to do
[1:42:34] that
[1:42:35] no
[1:42:36] sometimes
[1:42:38] remember when i joked here in the church
[1:42:40] about why i was meeting your husband at
[1:42:42] the door
[1:42:43] giving him a big old smack
[1:42:45] instead of tearing into him are you
[1:42:47] going to mow the lawn tonight
[1:42:49] are you going to fix the window that
[1:42:50] won't slide
[1:42:51] are you going to change oil on the car

[1:43:03] big old smack
[1:43:04] you know that very sunday i find this
[1:43:06] humorous hope you don't mind just take a
[1:43:07] moment
[1:43:09] the very sunday
[1:43:12] i spoke that to you i went home the wife
[1:43:14] and i now you know had a friend tell me
[1:43:16] this you know you're getting old when
[1:43:18] you get this sunday newspaper so you can
[1:43:19] look at the obituaries
[1:43:22] and uh
[1:43:24] so we get the sunday newspaper and
[1:43:26] mostly everything else is nonsense but
[1:43:28] strangely enough there's people my age
[1:43:31] that are appearing in the newspaper or
[1:43:33] only it's on the fourth page and that's
[1:43:35] not good
[1:43:37] and i flipped the newspaper and right
[1:43:39] there is a cartoon
[1:43:42] and here's the husband
[1:43:45] briefcase walks in the door
[1:43:48] and the wife runs up there
[1:43:50] and in the cartoon they've got this
[1:43:52] great big smack
[1:43:58] and then she says honey how was your day
[1:44:00] he's got a silly grin on his face he
[1:44:01] goes
[1:44:04] it was good it was good
[1:44:08] yeah

[1:44:26] provider why am i broke if you're my
[1:44:29] provider

[1:44:38] i have a provision that only you can
[1:44:40] take care of
[1:44:42] amen because look at this
[1:44:46] remember
[1:44:47] she invited him to her house but her
[1:44:50] house was really
[1:44:52] his house
[1:44:54] and when you invite christ into your
[1:44:56] house you're really inviting him into
[1:44:58] his own house but he's very happy i
[1:45:02] won't go into that it goes off into
[1:45:04] another
[1:45:05] another aspect
[1:45:07] but um our lord jesus christ speaking of
[1:45:09] a house amen so what did she do she set
[1:45:12] a stage for deliverance at her house
[1:45:15] amen now look at this i want you to
[1:45:16] catch this parents
[1:45:18] children
[1:45:20] she didn't wait until the damage was
[1:45:21] done she didn't wait until haman had his
[1:45:24] way
[1:45:25] amen she started asking god to fix it
[1:45:30] before the devil had his way amen she
[1:45:33] wasn't saying well you know i'm just
[1:45:35] going to sit back i don't want to put
[1:45:36] too much pressure on my children about
[1:45:39] you know serving god because we live in
[1:45:42] a day and i just don't feel like ought
[1:45:43] to put that go ahead you'll be spending
[1:45:45] the rest of your life praying for god to
[1:45:47] fix it if you're not willing to spend
[1:45:49] the time asking him right now to keep it
[1:45:52] come on saints come on parents i want
[1:45:54] you to think about that now is the time
[1:45:56] to be bold not when they're caught up in
[1:45:59] the world amen not when they're caught
[1:46:01] up in all this garbage well you know
[1:46:02] they're teenagers and they're just
[1:46:04] expressing themselves yes they're
[1:46:06] expressing exactly every bit of the
[1:46:09] content of satan's throne room that's
[1:46:11] what they're expressing if they're not
[1:46:13] expressing the things of god they're
[1:46:15] expressing the things of satan's uh
[1:46:17] throne room and you know the spirit of
[1:46:20] indifference comes and kids are like it
[1:46:22] doesn't matter my mom and dad have a
[1:46:23] religion they still fight and they still
[1:46:25] don't have enough money and we still
[1:46:26] this and we still that that's good
[1:46:28] parents that's good sit back just give
[1:46:30] your kids free reign you'll spend the
[1:46:32] rest of your life praying for their soul
[1:46:35] come on that's bold
[1:46:37] i'm sorry but it's the truth
[1:46:39] amen so she didn't wait for the damage
[1:46:41] to be done and then ask god to fix it
[1:46:43] she went to her king amen our king amen
[1:46:47] before there was any damage done
[1:46:49] amen
[1:46:50] and now look at this isaiah 50 will be
[1:46:52] done in just a minute isaiah 50 i mean 5
[1:46:56] isaiah 5 and 20. woe unto them that call
[1:46:58] evil good and good evil and that put
[1:47:01] darkness for light and light for
[1:47:03] darkness that put bitter for sweet and
[1:47:05] sweet for bitter
[1:47:06] that is the day we live in
[1:47:10] we are living in this time right now
[1:47:13] young people hear me and hear me well we
[1:47:16] are living in the hour where satan has
[1:47:19] called good evil and evil good and this
[1:47:22] world has embraced it
[1:47:24] satan's throne room has embraced it
[1:47:27] i just pray that god
[1:47:29] would would just
[1:47:30] lay upon your hearts to realize that
[1:47:33] these things this indifference that
[1:47:35] satan's putting into lives my brother
[1:47:37] and sister
[1:47:39] oh
[1:47:40] lord i could go on to so many things
[1:47:42] there
[1:47:43] now look satan's time is subject to
[1:47:45] god's time now i'm going to use the
[1:47:47] story of haman as we close this out for
[1:47:49] today
[1:47:51] haman had a timeline
[1:47:55] we're going to start bringing the
[1:47:56] stories of what's all wrong
[1:48:00] and telling the king about these
[1:48:01] rebellious people in the land never
[1:48:03] identify them
[1:48:05] but just these rebellious people
[1:48:09] and then we're going to get the king
[1:48:12] to make a decree
[1:48:14] about these rebellious people
[1:48:16] and in the fine print on the decree
[1:48:21] we're going to name them
[1:48:25] but the king's not going to read this
[1:48:26] whole big long document
[1:48:29] he's going to say tell me what's in it
[1:48:32] this is what's in it
[1:48:33] okay yeah no we got to deal with the
[1:48:35] rebels
[1:48:36] sign it now remember the kings wore a
[1:48:39] ring that had
[1:48:41] they called it a signet
[1:48:43] it was like the seal and they would roll
[1:48:45] that on that document
[1:48:48] now i want you to keep that in mind
[1:48:49] maybe for another sunday
[1:48:52] amen
[1:48:53] but i want you to keep in mind for the
[1:48:55] day
[1:48:56] there's a reason
[1:48:58] following as it were in this line
[1:49:01] god had a scroll
[1:49:03] of seven
[1:49:05] documents
[1:49:08] and each one
[1:49:10] was sealed
[1:49:14] think about it
[1:49:18] for another sunday we won't go that far
[1:49:21] see so
[1:49:23] satan's time is subject to god's time
[1:49:25] and satan haman here had a schedule
[1:49:27] worked out he had a time he was going to
[1:49:29] present this
[1:49:30] and then all of a sudden before he can
[1:49:32] present his side of it here is now
[1:49:35] esther coming and saying i need a
[1:49:37] petition now haman misinterpreting what
[1:49:40] was happening thinking that esther liked
[1:49:43] him
[1:49:44] amen goes home tells his family wow guys
[1:49:46] i'm the only one in the whole palace
[1:49:47] that's been invited to ever set down as
[1:49:50] it were you know because they ate their
[1:49:52] deal on the on a mattress you might say
[1:49:54] on a cushion on the floor different
[1:49:57] cultures still do that and and it's like
[1:49:59] well i'm the only ones ever invited down
[1:50:01] to to be with the king and with her in
[1:50:04] this time it's a time of great glory and
[1:50:06] in fact because i've been elevated to
[1:50:08] this position right did not satan say i
[1:50:10] would be raised up above
[1:50:16] oh how glorious is going to be
[1:50:19] he had his timeline
[1:50:21] god said here let me just read it to you
[1:50:23] i've got to hurry along
[1:50:25] amen
[1:50:28] matthew 24 22
[1:50:30] except those days should be shortened
[1:50:33] there should no flesh be saved but for
[1:50:36] the elect's sake those days shall be
[1:50:39] shortened
[1:50:40] god looked out and said that's my chosen
[1:50:41] people haman's trying to destroy
[1:50:44] i'm not making a doctrine out of this
[1:50:45] don't misunderstand me but god said no
[1:50:48] no no
[1:50:49] here is
[1:50:50] haman's timeline
[1:50:52] and i'm going to shorten the days i'm
[1:50:54] going to shorten this timeline
[1:50:56] and i'm going to come
[1:50:57] and i'm going to do a mighty work a
[1:51:01] deliverance before satan's timeline i'm
[1:51:04] going to shorten these days my brother
[1:51:06] and sister people was asking the prophet
[1:51:09] of god you go on the internet feel free
[1:51:11] to do that when people think the rapture
[1:51:13] will be oh no no no the bride of this
[1:51:15] last age the redeemed of this day they
[1:51:17] go through the tribulation and they go
[1:51:20] through all of these things no it don't
[1:51:21] fit the type my brother and sister now
[1:51:23] god is going to shorten the days amen
[1:51:26] for the elect's sake is there any elect
[1:51:29] here this morning amen god is going to
[1:51:31] cut this short of satan's plan for you
[1:51:35] amen for the true church of god he's got
[1:51:38] his plan and god says you know what
[1:51:40] right before all hell breaks loose on
[1:51:43] this earth i am going to his tummy and
[1:51:45] i'm going to shorten the days for my
[1:51:47] bride and i'm going to take her right
[1:51:49] out of here but it didn't change the
[1:51:51] scripture now all of that must be
[1:51:53] fulfilled
[1:51:54] and so here it is now that haman has his
[1:51:57] plan and god anoints her that day he
[1:52:00] anointed her saints to get up and put on
[1:52:03] the royal garment why that day
[1:52:08] because i already spoke to you
[1:52:10] there's no power
[1:52:12] for the bride for the believer
[1:52:15] until after the resurrection
[1:52:17] the third day
[1:52:19] amen when that life come to life
[1:52:21] that gave us authority of the word of
[1:52:24] god
[1:52:25] to take that
[1:52:26] amen no wonder satan tries to mess with
[1:52:28] things look my brother and sister when
[1:52:30] the time's messed up it's not god
[1:52:32] messing up the time it's us
[1:52:34] hallelujah so look at this now
[1:52:37] amen so unless the time be shortened
[1:52:39] there'd be no flesh saved so this is a
[1:52:41] god-given decree right right here in the
[1:52:43] scripture
[1:52:44] amen now use i'm going to hurry along
[1:52:46] here use the decree which is the word to
[1:52:49] defend yourself i'm jumping ahead
[1:52:51] setting a stage for maybe another
[1:52:53] another time here use the word what was
[1:52:55] the final deal when this all come out
[1:52:58] amen haman the devil was arrested
[1:53:01] he was subdued he was bound
[1:53:04] in that moment in that season he was
[1:53:06] bound and it's there in that realm right
[1:53:09] there the final decree that went forth
[1:53:12] was that it was now mordecai it's a
[1:53:14] bigger story i just hit a couple of them
[1:53:16] mordecai now elevated in the position
[1:53:18] that that um haman had
[1:53:22] and the very ring
[1:53:25] that haman used to have
[1:53:27] that he used to mark this as the
[1:53:28] official business of the king
[1:53:31] is now given to mordecai
[1:53:35] and now
[1:53:38] kind of give away maybe a future
[1:53:42] he says to esther
[1:53:45] what should i do
[1:53:48] what should i do
[1:53:51] and with the advice of mordecai and
[1:53:53] esther together
[1:53:55] no doubt the king being a part of all of
[1:53:57] this
[1:53:58] will send forth a decree
[1:54:02] we cannot reach every corner and stop
[1:54:05] every person that was part of haman's
[1:54:09] conspiracy
[1:54:11] are you with me amen
[1:54:14] but we'll send a decree
[1:54:16] that everyone has a right
[1:54:18] to defend himself
[1:54:22] oh hallelujah
[1:54:24] hallelujah and i don't want to carry
[1:54:26] this out too long will you come sister
[1:54:27] emmy amen and heidi amen look at this my
[1:54:31] brother and sister the decree was to
[1:54:34] defend yourself and your family in your
[1:54:36] house or in the field or on the roadway
[1:54:40] wherever you might be you have been
[1:54:42] given this given this right to defend
[1:54:45] yourself and encourage to defend
[1:54:47] yourself amen i tell you my brother and
[1:54:50] sister it's come right down it's time as
[1:54:53] i spoke to you the warfare of the day
[1:54:55] that we live in it's time for us to
[1:54:57] stand up and say that's my baby girl
[1:54:59] that was given to me as a gift of god
[1:55:01] that's my baby boy that was given to me
[1:55:03] as a gift of god that was a husband that
[1:55:05] was given to me as a gift of god as a
[1:55:08] wife that was given to me as a gift of
[1:55:10] god that's my brother in christ that's
[1:55:12] my sister in christ and i have a decree
[1:55:15] now from the very word of god that i can
[1:55:18] stand up and defend them wherever i meet
[1:55:21] the devil he comes to my house i have a
[1:55:24] right to defend myself i meet him in the
[1:55:27] market i have a right to defend myself i
[1:55:29] meet him wherever i have a right to
[1:55:31] defend myself i have a royal decree
[1:55:35] oh and i want to go into this in future
[1:55:37] time with the lord will and then the
[1:55:40] king took the signet the ring that was
[1:55:42] on his own hand and he sealed he put it
[1:55:46] in an envelope
[1:55:47] are you with me
[1:55:49] rolled up the scroll
[1:55:50] amen the seven seals rolled up in a
[1:55:53] scroll and that wasn't one giant seal on
[1:55:56] the seventh seal it was seven individual
[1:55:59] seals because each one was a letter to
[1:56:02] the people for a time for a place for a
[1:56:05] purpose but the thing is the king now
[1:56:08] comes and the decree is placed in the
[1:56:10] envelope and the king then takes his
[1:56:12] signature and he seals it
[1:56:15] but you know what i kind of got ahead of
[1:56:17] myself well inside that envelope
[1:56:20] was a king's decree
[1:56:25] you can defend yourself
[1:56:28] you can come right down in laodicea and
[1:56:30] i have given you a god-given right
[1:56:33] to defend yourself your family
[1:56:36] your brother and sister your church
[1:56:38] family
[1:56:40] i've given it to you oh my brother and
[1:56:42] sister that decree across the land
[1:56:46] and the people rose up on that day to
[1:56:47] shorten the story
[1:56:49] and they fought
[1:56:52] for what had been given
[1:56:54] them oh hallelujah the bible even goes
[1:56:57] as far as to say that many people became
[1:56:59] jews
[1:57:03] now i don't know if you don't have
[1:57:04] jewish blood in you how you become a jew
[1:57:07] but i don't believe it was there to be
[1:57:08] fussed over i believe it's there
[1:57:11] to show us
[1:57:13] that you fighting for your family and
[1:57:15] standing for the word of god
[1:57:17] will cause others to come
[1:57:19] and want to be a part of this same
[1:57:21] family
[1:57:22] cause others to say you know what
[1:57:23] there's something different about them
[1:57:26] amen they're standing right in the midst
[1:57:28] of satan's throne room
[1:57:31] and while i see them buffeted
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:34] let me just put it this way have you
[1:57:35] seen paul make a mistake
[1:57:38] come on
[1:57:39] don't be ashamed nod your heads it's
[1:57:41] true
[1:57:45] but you're still fighting for me aren't
[1:57:46] you
[1:57:48] you still pray for me once in a while
[1:57:49] don't you
[1:57:52] and the vice versa
[1:57:54] you see my brother and sister isn't
[1:57:55] about what we are it's what we stand
[1:57:57] under and we have a decree
[1:57:59] i said rise up use whatever is necessary
[1:58:03] to defend yourself
[1:58:05] now look we'll close with this right
[1:58:06] here for today
[1:58:08] i'm taking a little more time than i
[1:58:09] intended i'm sorry
[1:58:11] what a perfect type it is of christ the
[1:58:14] antitype a male a lamb
[1:58:17] and he was tested for three and a half
[1:58:19] years of his ministry through critics
[1:58:21] and everything the clergy of that day
[1:58:23] but was proved to hold fast to the
[1:58:26] father's word even in the presence of
[1:58:29] haman
[1:58:30] i mean satan
[1:58:32] he said it is written it is written
[1:58:35] constantly he defeated the enemy on the
[1:58:38] word
[1:58:39] a perfect example for us today always
[1:58:42] defeat the enemy with the word of god
[1:58:45] that's written for the day i want to ask
[1:58:48] you
[1:58:49] do we have a word for our day
[1:58:52] oh hallelujah hallelujah can we just
[1:58:54] stand up and worship the lord a little
[1:58:55] bit
[1:58:56] i apologize i i didn't mean to take it
[1:59:00] so far
[1:59:01] hallelujah
[1:59:03] amen
[1:59:05] hallelujah come holy spirit
[1:59:09] let's just just worship the lord today
[1:59:10] let's just invite him
[1:59:12] to come back
[1:59:14] right here today in our presence and
[1:59:16] speak to our hearts and
[1:59:19] you know my brother and sister sometimes
[1:59:20] people get ideas satan puts these ideas
[1:59:22] that it'd be like well
[1:59:24] you know they're chasing that means that
[1:59:26] you know the preacher is going to beat
[1:59:27] us
[1:59:28] the preacher is going to condemn us
[1:59:31] i pray you never
[1:59:33] feel that or have that attitude here
[1:59:35] what i want
[1:59:37] is the holy ghost
[1:59:39] to come down
[1:59:40] you might be at home you might be at
[1:59:41] work you might wake up in the middle of
[1:59:43] the night
[1:59:44] and then that would be the moment that
[1:59:46] god would choose to speak to you
[1:59:48] and you would sit there
[1:59:51] i'm not trying to make any point saints
[1:59:54] but in the last few months hear god
[1:59:58] it's been chasing and paul a lot
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:02] oh no i'm not robbing banks or i'm not
[2:00:04] doing anything that you guys would all
[2:00:06] just go in shock over
[2:00:09] you might say he's made me go through
[2:00:11] the closet of my life
[2:00:15] i'm in the attic of my life i'm in the
[2:00:17] garage of my life
[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:20] and god says you shouldn't have this
[2:00:22] here
[2:00:24] paul this shouldn't be a part
[2:00:26] of your life
[2:00:30] yes lord
[2:00:32] yes lord to the best of my ability
[2:00:34] saints
[2:00:36] i have just been saying okay lord
[2:00:39] done with this
[2:00:40] things i i don't even like i said
[2:00:42] they're not evil i wouldn't be ashamed
[2:00:44] you'd look at that and go oh i wonder
[2:00:45] why brother paul would have this or that
[2:00:47] or whatever
[2:00:48] one of them would be a pile of
[2:00:49] motorcycle magazines that i have saved
[2:00:51] for 20 years because they had cool
[2:00:53] pictures in them of the guy you know
[2:00:56] doing this or doing that on the
[2:00:57] motorcycle and and god was like
[2:01:00] are you really this is what the lord
[2:01:01] spoke to me
[2:01:02] are you really
[2:01:04] believing
[2:01:06] in that
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:10] yeah one time lord it was my god
[2:01:14] one time i worshipped at that altar if
[2:01:16] you own a motorcycle that's fine i'm not
[2:01:17] talking about that i'm talking at a
[2:01:18] higher level where you elevate this
[2:01:22] and i thought lord
[2:01:23] i want to be submitted to you not to the
[2:01:25] spirits of the age i remember what it
[2:01:27] was like
[2:01:28] i remember what it was like saints i
[2:01:29] used to be very good at riding a dirt
[2:01:31] bike and i looked at that and i even you
[2:01:33] know
[2:01:34] my wife always said it was the lord
[2:01:35] punishing me for lying to her when i
[2:01:37] when i destroyed my knee
[2:01:40] but you see i had lied to her and i had
[2:01:42] lied to her and i had lied to her and
[2:01:44] i'm working
[2:01:46] and i used to justify to myself to ride
[2:01:48] a dirt bike fast in the desert his work
[2:01:50] [Music]
[2:01:55] and just as god used it to wean me from
[2:01:57] that
[2:01:59] when i grabbed this big pile of all
[2:02:01] these different editions of these
[2:02:03] magazines and i took them out and i
[2:02:05] dropped them in the trash
[2:02:10] it's like okay the final little tale of
[2:02:13] the trail of the serpent
[2:02:16] just got cut off now don't think i went
[2:02:18] back to the serpent if you hear i bought
[2:02:19] a motorcycle
[2:02:22] but it will never ever again if i ever
[2:02:24] did it would never dominate my life it
[2:02:25] wouldn't be the control of my life i
[2:02:27] wouldn't be tempted to find an excuse to
[2:02:29] skip church to ride the bike
[2:02:32] and god's doing that i just use that as
[2:02:34] a little example other little things
[2:02:36] books mystery
[2:02:37] combat spy movie type books and it's
[2:02:41] there
[2:02:42] and the lord saying do you really
[2:02:44] need that in your house
[2:02:47] now expand house here
[2:02:52] it was a really good book saints except
[2:02:54] for the one part that was a little bit
[2:02:58] the lord's saying really you're gonna
[2:03:00] justify
[2:03:02] having this garbage in your house
[2:03:04] no lord
[2:03:05] i'm not
[2:03:08] i'll i'll donate him so somebody else
[2:03:10] can have the devil in their house
[2:03:14] no i went out to a garbage can
[2:03:16] to plunk
[2:03:17] they're under probably 30 or 40 foot of
[2:03:19] trash out at picklebee landfill

[2:03:26] come on saints we're in the final run
[2:03:28] we're in the cleansing season we're in
[2:03:31] the time the prophet of god said god

[2:03:35] our life
