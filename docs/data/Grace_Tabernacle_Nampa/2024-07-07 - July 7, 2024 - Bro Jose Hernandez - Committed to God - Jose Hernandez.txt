ours we expect to receive the answer we expect these things to be answered according to your will in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] s what a beautiful thought I was thinking concern burning The Great Speckled Bird remember her name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word all the other birds flocking around her and she is despised by the squad and The Great Speckled Bird in the Bible represents you the great Church of God she is spreading her wings for a journey she is going to take by and by when the Great trumpet sounds in the morning [Music] she will meet her dear Lord in the sky with all the other churches against her they Envy her glory and fame they hate her because she is chosen and never has denied his his dear name Desiring to lower her standard they watch every move that she makes they love to find fault with her teaching but really they find no mistake in the pr presence of all her despisers with song Never Ed before she'll arise and be gone in a moment till the great tribulations are over I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am glad that my name's on the book for I want to be one ever fearing on the face of my savior to [Music] [Applause] look amen

words could not express the love we feel but we long for you too to he listen to our heart hear our spirit sing the song of Praise that flows from those you have redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are words are not enough to tell you of our love listen to our hearts if words could fall like R from these lips of mine and if I had had a thousand years I would still run out of time so if you listen to my heart every beat will say thank you for the life thank you for the truth thank you for the way oh Lord Jesus listen to our hearts here our spirit sing a song of Praise that flows from those you have redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God words are not enough to tell you of our love just listen to our [Music] heart heart hear our spirit sing the song of Praise that flows from those you have redeemed and we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are and words are not enough to tell you of our love listen to our [Music] [Music] heart God bless you brother Isaac greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's always a pleasure be here being here I was telling brother Paul back there that uh I I I just couldn't just pass through and I I I start feeling like this is my second home Church um I I uh we went to Colorado had a good time over there but part of my heart was in [Music] here and and [Music] trius we enjoy the word but you know what US is something is something else that you want and I just love you [Music] guys I I love the fact that I I can come here and and feel [Music] like I'm loved too and it's nothing special about me it's it's nothing special about you but the special is the love of Christ in [Music] us the love of [Music] Christ surpasses or oversees any wrongdoing right our brothers and sisters we have we have many in our life we have many ups and downs [Music] right but we don't we don't stay just think you know I'm messed up over here we just don't stay there and crying about the messed up we [Music] did we got up yeah we stay down on our knees saying Lord I'm I'm [Music] sorry I messed up here there and there [Music] but I don't want to do the same mistake [Music] again because we're crucifying Christ [Music] again if we continue continue doing the same thing over and over we just don't appreciate his sacrifice we don't appreciate that the fact that he came and die not only die but he suffered he suffered the moment he [Music] start he start doing his his work because nobody saw him with good eyes because he didn't came from from the temple he didn't have any [Music] degree but he did it for you and he saw he's saw all until 20124 that's right he saw us amen and he said I'm doing it for [Music] them I uh appreciate Brother Paul's confidence to allow me to stand behind this pulpit and I appreciate you for taking the time and coming this morning to hear from God cuz you're wasting your time to see what I can bring to you and I'm wasting your my time just trying to entertain you you know what sad thing is that the the a lot of churches are full because they like entertainment I heard someone say that if you're in a church that you like to hear just the good things that they say walk out of there because they're not preaching the Bible because the Bible Cuts us I mean we're we're human beings full of mistakes and and and the moment [Music] you take your sight out of the path of God you made a mistake when we're not when we're losing the focus and God's will for our life we made a mistake and then when the Bible comes and and it's telling us where we we're failing oh this flesh doesn't like that cuz this flesh enjoys the things of the world that's right you know last time I was here we spoke about the bread represents the flesh and that poor man the baker guy got hanged so we have to hang that's right this flesh so it can be turned [Music] apart so God can come and put the good pieces back together and put him to [Music] use it's always a pleasure traveling with my [Music] family I always say [Music] that I couldn't find a better wife she keep us keep up with me and the boys I think she slept like night like 1:00 in the morning just trying to get everything ready for us this [Music] morning there's so many things in [Music] life that you're not going to give enough thanks to God that he's given you even though we're full of mistakes sometimes we the we deserve less by your [Music] actions but you know what that's the beauty of loving [Music] father when he was on the cross you and I were on his mind and he thinks we deserve the best as a father I can ask you as a father do you don't you think your kids deserve the best they [Music] do but I sometimes I see that we take we take things for granted and we don't appreciate the sacrifice behind the gift that's right so I uh I don't know what you do but you made me cry every time I come [Music] here I believe is the love of [Music] God he's so [Music] marvelous I always try to try to find a good reason why we can quit serving God but there is no [Music] reason if you try hard to to get away from [Music] God God is going to let you go but you're you're going to have to live with the scars that you C yourself for the stubbornness not [Music] listening my thought this morning is committed to God [Music] Amen and the word commitment is this state or quality of being dedicated to c a [Music] cause or activity and the similar words to Commitment are dedication devotion Allegiance loyalty faithfulness fidelity if you can write those words down I'm trusting God that you can have the complete re Revelations Revelation from God to to this message if you please stand with me let's go to the book of Deuteronomy 32 verse 46 if you have it you can say amen amen is uh let's borrow our heads first Heavenly Father we come before you Lord father I ask you this morning Lord that you come and take preminent of this place take control of each and every one of us Lord and help us to do a service father that can be a great service to you Lord not but not because what we do father but because you are here present and taking control of myself help me to set aide so you can come and speak to the people Lord father we thank you for this opportunity to have spend time this Resurrection morning Lord the reason we are here father is because you Rose up amen from the dead amen and you say it because I live you also Believe In Father we thank you for the sacrifice Lord and thank you for your love and a special blessing for the Tabernacle Grace Tabernacle father we praise your mighty name we thank you for the love that you can provide through your bride Lord thank you for the blessings that we receive I personally thank you Lord because you allow me to go traveled so many hours and come back lord and by your grace father we are here so we thank you and and and and and we ask you so you can come and reveal the word of God that we've been about to read father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask you amen amen amen I uh honestly I don't know where to start I I've been I've been through so many scriptures and uh and all of them are just so good let's start reading verse 46 and he said unto them set your hearts unto The Words which I testify among you this day which ye shall command your children to observe to do all the words of this law amen for it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life am and through these things ye shall prolong your days in the land whether you go over yordan to possess it and then let's uh let's go to Psalms 37 375 excuse me it reads like this commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring bring it to pass amen you may be seated this um scripture here I explain a little bit about the commitment so we we go to the the Bible every time we go to the Bible and and and read something uh we we're not required to learn by memory the whole Bible it's not a requirement because what is important is if you learn one or two words today let's just put those two words to work to be manifest through our life it is it says that uh if a person chew the food but don't swallow it spit it out eventually it's going to die of hunger so it's the same way with the word of God how many times we come to church and unfortunately there are many people that just become church goers yeah and in James the Book of James says we have to be doors not only just here and here amen because this is basically what people do they just go to church because they like to hear how beautiful the band plays and and and but we we don't pay attention that those words that the the the the the preacher are saying those words are food to our spirit and if we don't [Music] have the commitment right to make those words work in our life eventually you're going to die right because this the the word of God I mean it says here in in 47 for it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life so your life depends on this amen word right that's what what um God told Joshua don't let this book depart from you meditate day and night amen and and you know what Joshua had to commit himself to to God's Commandments to God's requirements and he did it now the question is everybody did it no but because somebody else didn't act upon those requirements we're not going to do it based on somebody else's actions right we're not here not even to imitate the pastor's actions that's right we are here to imitate Christ life amen Christ life has to be displayed in his body which is us now it's so hard to to imitate Christ life but we're not required to meet all the requirements but that Christ did it because he knows you and me we're not able to do it but when he sees you doing your 100% you think you're doing your 100% but we're not doing it 100% before the eyes of God he's there for us to complete what we're lacking of Amen because that's that's why he went to the Cross because he knew we you and I we couldn't meet those requirements that's right so he put his partial so so you and I can't have the same reward that's why he called once some people in the morning some in the noon and some of the evening but you know what the pay was the same so you you don't have you don't get to complain because you you've been working in God's Farm all your life does his his will he chose you because he saw in you a potential that you can be a help for others so we have to be grateful to to God because how many people because they've been called at the later time they've been bouncing their head so many times against the wall what what what can I do what I'm going through this well the light hasn't shine on them yet but that's where you and I we're here to help the people in need out there God called you to be a light for this Dying World and if we don't display the light that Jesus display we're missing something and I I was talking to someone the other day said uh I don't need to go to church yes but you need to have an experience with Christ because Daniel didn't need a temple to commit his life to God right but it was the circumstances that took him there but he was 100% committed to God and those people that they say oh I don't need it's just religion an excuse right because they're not committed either in church than I committed either in a house a home it's just a covering oh because brother so and so says just push play come on yeah right I mean you can push play Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Saturday I heard a preacher a long time ago he said that I never understood but he said Sunday begins on Saturday around 6 and I I I never quite understood that part but the way I understand it now is that on Saturday around six you should start looking to have that connection with God you start just I mean we have things to do yes I I I I I I I tell my wife you should you should make a schedule so you can iron the the clothing for Sunday like Friday so you can have Saturday evening more relaxed and and when this this preacher was saying that like I said it's long time ago obviously it was a little L but uh I understand that you have to start getting in the same channel what God is going to bring on Sunday for me because if you're not in the same channel you're going to miss it you come to church expecting from God you you come to church expecting from The Fountain the Living Word but if we come worry about oh my boss is going to get mad at me because I forgot to do the things he told me to do on Friday or anything else right maybe the young people say I didn't did my homework I didn't do it I'm going to be in trouble no we have to start getting that connection I'm not saying you can do whatever you want from Monday through Friday but we commitment is that if you're committed with God everything that you do Apostle Paul says whatever you do do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I uh I want to I want to go to James James 1 James 1:22 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves and then in Matthew 7:26 Jesus is telling about the person who built a house on a sand so the the storm came and then there that was not found for the house so is basically what we do when we come to church and and we don't be doors of the word of God everything is going to just it's going to be like the guy that was praying to an idol and he was asking something always asking something and then the the idol didn't never answer his pray prayer and he said oh I know why you don't answer uh don't answer me is because you can hear he doesn't have ears so he just drill a hole here and he came through here and then all he kept asking an asking the miracle and all of a sudden oh I know why it's because he comes from one ear he goes out to another one so we we don't want to be that kind of person because we we as as a parent we have to set a good example to our family and the kids have to be a good example for the kids they hang out at school so they can be an a good influence so they can they can prove to other kids that they don't believe in God that there is a living God because of their actions but if we don't get socked in into the word of God it's really easy that they can just move us from one place to another you know for how many many years we've been in church how many years you heard the word of God but it's is not it's it's not about time that's right is about when you make your decision and commit yourself to God now the commitment is not an easy thing to do that's right because commitment requires sacrifice that's right a good friend is going to make a sacrifice for his friend because he's committed his friendship so if he's if if if your friend is in trouble and you have the means to get him out of trouble even though you have to make a sacrifice you're GNA do it because you're committed to that friendship so James is saying that let's just stop being someone who's just here and here and here and here another words he wants to see the fruits he wants to see what is the word of God what kind of impact is the word of God is doing in your life like this this man in uh David was just thinking about the water of Bethlehem or if I can just have a drink you know what this man they weren't committed to the the king they didn't think about old but there's so many Philistines around it right there's so many enemies but uh a wish from the King for them because they were committed to him it was a command amen amen now just think about it just think about these actions that's it and this this man is just they were committed to another man thank God we don't have to get a sword and and a shield to go to go to go to war but we're we're we're fighting a spiritual war that's right my barber the other day she says uh she she's a Mormon she was telling me said you know what is this world is going so upside down that I mean even if uh somebody comes and and thre threatens me to kill me because my fate I will give it up I say yeah that sounds really good I mean saying is sounds really good right I said but what about they come and and tell you I'm going to kill your daughter if you don't deny your faith and she just turn on me and oh that's that's a different it's a different thing now because you know you you you can die You You Believe In Christ you you believe that if you die just you're doing me a favor but you can live with the pain that you saw your son or daughter die it's not easy it's a different story but you know what you can't complain about that because God did it he saw your son dying for you and me she couldn't answer that why I said have you heard the song I have decided to follow Jesus how many of here know the story behind that well that guy was committed to give up his life not only his life but he was committed to give up his son's life his wife's life and himself because of the love of Jesus Amen so he got the Revelation that he said I mean the guy was in India and and it was a village so a village normally is a poor people who live there and you know when you when you have needs when you have all the means to to have a a decent life you tend to to lean more on God on God's will but when you have everything I mean if you got sick oh I have insurance I'll go to see a doctor oh I I my AC run out oh I got the money in the bank I could just call the company replace it that's that's how difficult is for God to manifest in people who has everything because they don't know the need of God because every they think everything in their head is I can solve everything with money right right but the Bible says that everything everything here in this world is going to pass that's right heavens and earth will pass but you know what I experien even though I don't have money I experienced that the money has limitations science have limitations right that's right the only the only thing that doesn't have limitations is God and he's just right there for you Amen in time of need but you you have to go on your knees and say Lord I need you I'm going to share with you this it says how do you how do I explain to Abraham that is difficult for you to be faithful to God when he was asked to sacrifice his only son how do you explain to ananas Michel and Azariah that you cannot avoid being seduced by the things of the world when they prefer to be burned rather than worship idols how do you explain Daniel that it is difficult for you to have devotional devotional life because of laziness when he did not give up despite putting his life at risk becoming a lion's food you know we always have excuses we always have things to do in life and I mean my might be one of those guilty ones but is it requires a sacrifice and again and I'm sorry if I said it this too much or too often but this flesh has to be put at sacrifice amen because this flesh is the one given us a hard time that's right to get committed to God because the things you do as long as pleases this flesh it w be a problem but when you try to do things for God this flesh starts complaining that's right absolutely that's right and I can tell you something really simple we can go on our knees to pray because it hurts yeah oh I'm getting all I hardly get up after and and you you grabbed your Bible and started I mean you have so much sleep and if you go to bed to sleep you can sleep now tell me what it is what is causing that I mean it's the enemy he knows what wires to put together so you cannot get in connection with God if you have crosswires you're going to spark but that spark is going to cause to cut the power right so you don't you don't cross wires so the current goes that's right one way and comes back the other way so when you make a sacrifice for Christ it might hurt going this way but guess what yeah the blessings are coming that's right and when you receive the blessings what you do praise God it's the same thing when when when the rain comes to to a dry land and and and and the the wheat or whatever the corn that's what brother said that they just get up and say praise the Lord I got water but the weat too but at the end well brother Paul is a farmer he knows everything about that at the end he he doesn't doesn't care about the wheat he cares about the corn because he the good thing he's he going to make money he doesn't make money out of the Wheats so we we we we're we're in church to become the grain of weed that's right oh yeah it's beautiful but you know what even the grain of wheat is going to have to be that's right amen we don't like that either and even though we sing so many times to be like Jesus to be like Jesus well Jesus got bit we have to be willing to receive the beating that's right so the the good thing of us can come out I I I saw a reflection really I mean it's simple but you see the guitar right there it says the a Christian is like the strings of the guitar so and the head you have to be connected to the head that's right and you have to be connected to the B that's right and in order for the string to do a fine sound it has to be tense yeah that's right that's it but do you think that string is not suffering right there that's right that's it that's it it's in pain yes sir you you don't know but it's in pain and we don't like to be in pain that's it we like to be relaxed amen I might be preaching to myself this morning but it is the truth it is the truth that that that when when everything is easy yeah we enjoy it but you know what we lose interest as soon as as as soon as the the I mean very simple you give your gifts Christmas gift to the kids they're excited about unwrapping this those gifts and even if it's a 100,000 I mean a $100 or $1,000 gift they're going to be hi it only one night maybe next day 3 days later you're going to find him playing with sticks out there back in the backyard or going back to the old toys so the string in the guitar to do it to give out its best has to be real tense amen so the head is cry am and the base is the church so it has to be tense oh I don't want to go to church because there's so many Hypocrites there maybe one one of them is you have you thought about that because when you do this three fingers are pointed back to me is it's so easy to give up when the things get tense continues how do I explain to Isaiah that to live a Christian life is very hard when he died chopped in pieces how do you explain to Prophet Jeremiah that is difficult for you to get out of the pit of discouragement when he was put up to his net in mud blocked in his sister how do you explain John the Baptist that you are afraid of losing your job if you point out the irregularities you see when he lost his head for the truth how do you explain Steven that it is difficult to stand and firm in the faith when he was stuned to death how do you explain Peter that you feel like miserable traitor to the master when he stood up and G in evidence he died upside down on the cross how do you explain Paul that you cannot stand being mocked because of your faith when he was whipped and almost killed because of his faith how do you explain Jesus that is hard for you to forgive when he was in the cross he asked his father to forgive the one now is a Christian life easy no is a Christian Life requires a sacrifice yes but you're not the only one that's right I mean what is a sacrifice for you maybe is is not a sacrifice for the neighbor and his sacrifice is not your sacrifice because you know that you you overcame that situation by trusting your situation in God and and God give you the peace the Peace of Mind peace of your heart but there is always something in life as long as we stay in this stinking flesh that's right we're going to stink I'm sorry but we have to I mean the same way you you you have to maintenance in your body you stop doing maintenance in your body that's right you have to do maintenance in your spiritual body too right because the the moment we quit letting the the the water of the the war come through and it start washing us every day every day you stop doing that I mean simple as that right we don't we don't we don't have we don't we don't have to to work miracles every day we just have to display the love of Jesus that's right to someone bro Brian says I rather have a church Full Of Love Of Christ than full of gifts right amen and you know what because the gift can be copy that's right the enemy can can do the actions of speaking in tongues and things like that I was telling brother Paul that at one time in Colorado I went to a Pentecostal church and I invite people to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and I and I say I I I I mean I haven't been in church uh for many I will say couple day years so I went to visit this church and then I went and they were just training them to to just how to twist the tongue and then and do this noise and and eventually it's going to come out I just walk out of there that's a big nice beautiful church but what good is in it vain yeah they're beautiful buildings but empty right there is no holy ghost in there right and here they are trying to teach gifts of the Holy Ghost the thing that they don't have right that's right I I'm not a Christian because of the gifts of the Holy Ghost right I'm not after that I just want I just want to be a billboard if someone sees me that I can reflect a little bit at least a little bit of Jesus Christ because the moment that you are willing to to commit and do the put this flesh to sacrifice for Christ amen you even know how you do it but you do things that you don't imagine that's it that's and you're going to be amazed of yourself because it's not you it's Christ in you imagine Paul going on to Damascus in his heart and in his mind was to kill and put in prison as many Christians as he can this is a man thinking his own way this is a man doing somebody else's Commandments but when he come and faces the word the very word and that light in form of light he became different man BR Brandon say that anyone who comes in contact with Jesus Christ he cannot be the same again right and if you think you have to come in contact with Jesus Christ and you cannot get rid of this get rid of that I'll suggest just to go back on your knees again because the only way we can achieve the goal is by Christ being in our lives that's exactly right that's the only way when Jesus comes and and leaves and Reigns in this Temple that's right because that's what we called to be a temple of the Holy Ghost that's right we are capable of doing things that we're not Unthinkable things that's right imagine walking Jesus going to to to see this uh person with Legion of demons people think that it was an easy task for Jesus because oh he was God but he said but brother Brown says that he was a human being as you and I but it was God at the same time that's right amen so he felt the pain that you feel right now amen because he was a human being that's right oh he cried on the T of Lazarus yes he cried because he was a human being but as a God he say just command Lazarus forward right that's the kind of life we have to display amen so when we when we required to pray for a sick person we didn't call Brother Paul he's not the only one with the authority to pray every single one of us but we need to live the kind of life that we ready for that because otherwise we can come up with those those guys that we're praying for to sick and and the demon came says I know Jesus I know Paul yeah but who are you that's right so we don't Bluff we have to make sure we don't we're not bluffing amen because amen we have to act upon the scriptures but we have to make sure that we are living the type of life that the demon can come and challenge you and if he does you're ready for the fight why is Comm commment so important the Lord leads with unfailing love and faithfulness all who keep his command Covenant and obey his demands when you are committed to following God he will lead you to his will for your life the satisfying and fulfilling goal for which he has created you amen amen that's Psalms 25 510 in Psalms 3123 says for the Lord protects those who are loyal to him now the question is do you think it's worth to be loyal to God or not yes it is I mean he is the one who fights for you amen the enemy is going to rise up his army but you be loyal to God he's going to fight for you amen when you are committed to God he is committed to to watching you out for for you and caring for you Ruth 1:14 and again they wept together and Nora kissed her mother-in-law goodbye but Ruth clung tightly to Naomi commitment is the true Mark of friendship amen right I mean just think about Ruth what Naomi has to offer her she has nothing what old she had nothing she didn't even know if she was going to be able to to repossess the the the lands she lost when she left so Ruth was committed because of the rebolation that's it listen that's right because of her choice that's right God blessed her to become part of the lineage of Jesus Christ amen do you think she think about that no it's God's mercy God's grace that's right when you're loyal to God God is going to bless you amen he's going to give you more than you deserve that's right that's for sure I mean do you think she deserve to be part of the lineage of Jesus Christ being an idol I mean idolator she she came from a city that they just know about Idols but she said you know what uh Naomi I'll go with you no matter what and I believe and this is me and I believe what the moment she said your God will be my God yeah yeah that's settled amen that's right absolutely right because she commit to God she didn't commit to Naomi Naomi had nothing to offer her eveni said I mean do you expect me to have another children and and you're going to wait for them to gra up she didn't care about that amen 1 Corinthians 13:7 says love never gives up never loses Faith amen it's always hopeful and endures through every circumstance amen commitment is the evidence of love for one another amen what are the characteristics of a committed person Proverbs 11:3 says honesty guides good people a loyal person is trustworthy and thereof honest Chronicle 1 Chronicles 11:18 says so this the so the three men broke through the Philistines lines drew some water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem and brought it back to David a loyal person will make great personal sacrifices for friends amen it was a big sacrifice they risking their life just for a cup of water and what did David did poured out on you know why because David also was committed to a higher power God he says my life is not worthy to the the cause of this life so he didn't in sacrifice to God Amen he offered the sacrifice they did to God what does it mean to be committed to God Matthew 41920 Jesus called out the to them come follow me and I will show you how to fish for people and they left their Nets at once and follow him commitment to follow God requires decision of the Mind follow it by Act of will yes we can go to church every Sunday every Wednesday but if you're not committed to God doesn't do any good to you that's right that's right Psalms 37:5 commit everything you do to the Lord Proverbs 3:6 seek seek God's will in all you do that's right and he will show you which path to take commitment to the Lord manifest itself to obedient trust Amen in Luke 14:27 if you do not carry your own cross and follow me you cannot be my disciple that's right but don't begin until you come the cost you have to think okay this is going to be costly are you are you up for the challenge are commitment to God is costly because to follow him is to leave lesser but every attractive thing behind Daniel 3:17 says if we are thrown into the Blazing furnace the god whom we serve is able to save us but even if he doesn't we want to make it clear to you we will never bow to your Gods commitment is is being willing to to accept the something painful consequences of obedience to God when you are committed to God there will always be those committed to position and you will always stand for it this is this sense of spiritual warfare and any bottle there will be some wounds so as as soon as you're committed to God there is always somebody is committed to the opposite right so he's gonna give you a hard time yeah the the the the same way God is equipment equipping you the enem is equipping his that's right he's arming and you know what the the sometimes we think we know so much Bible and but the enemy knows more Bible than us yeah that's right so that's why James says here we have to be doors because knowing the Bible doesn't put you in a higher place that's right right that's right but when you become a doorer it puts you in a different position that's right it separates you from the crowd not because you you're more important no is because the life in Christ in you amen takes you to a place that's right amen where you cannot be touched By God's enemy unless God allows it amen that's exactly there is a little story that there were two friends one was a a Christian and the other one was a A marcker or unbeliever and they got to uh they want they made plans to go to hand Ducks so that morning the unbeliever showed up his friend's house and he picked up over the window and he saw him praying and when he saw him praying he start laughing within himself and he said when they went out and say see my life is easier than yours because this morning when I was coming in I saw I saw you praying and I heard you saying Lord please help me to get rid of this situation help me to conquer this problem that I'm in see the enemy doesn't bother me I don't have to pray pray God I don't have to pray any to any anyone and the Christian friend says okay when we go hunt Ducks you should you kill one and the other one is wounded which one are you going to go first the one is dead or the one is wounded he say well I'm going the one is wounded because the dead is already there I I have it well is the same thing when the de the devil has you he's not worried about you he's worried the about the one he doesn't have yet so we're in struggling yes like I say as long as we stay in this place we're going to have struggles in life amen but we're not we're not called to quit that's right right we are called because the Bible says we are more done a conqueror he said a sample of it he conquered death that's what that's why Paul he got the Revelation says I don't mind dying he got bit throwing in jail but he was committed to God Amen if they if they let me go praise God if they don't let me go praise God Amen if they kill me Hallelujah I'm going home Romans 121 says give your bodies to God commitment is more than intellectual agreement it involves sacrific I giving of the whole self not it's not just part of you all of you I think there is a song is he wants all of you but we don't want to give up all of us because there is always something that is really hard for us to get rid of it oh but I enjoy so much this watch out amen if you enjoy one thing of this world it's danger because that is in between you that's it and God Amen that's it that's and everything that is between you and God becomes an idol that's it that's right I think I'm going to stop right here brother Paul I if it's okay I would like to ask brother Jonathan to come and he has a a song to to play and um see when when when you see things like this young people doing things for God I mean it gives you Joy does but but just looking up looking down and looking back and I say what did I do I I did nothing other than I just giving back to God and eventually they're going to have to make a decision that's right because it's between God I'm him that's right right my role here is to in intr introduce them to Amen to God Amen give him instructions about God and they they're going to have to make their own decision that's right the same way I did my own decision the same way you you make your decision every every single one of us we have to have our own experience that's ex right because we cannot live by the experience of the pastor we cannot live by the experience of our parents that's right some of us maybe don't have Christian parents but you know what when you give your heart to God I mean we is dreaded if you're loyal to God he's going to be fighting for you oh the enemy is never going to give up that's right you overcome one thing and the enemy is going to be ready for you too amen amen but Rejoice amen Rejoice because you're not the dead dock that's right you might be wounded right but you're not dead yet Hallelujah let us pray heavenly father thank you Lord for this opportunity that you give us Lord and I pray Lord that I didn't offend anyone this morning Lord and if I did Father I ask forgiveness and give us Lord the encouragement to continue this journey father even though we are not living an easy life father but we ask you to come and strength or Spirit Lord give us the Revelation that we we need to continue this journey father father even
