morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord I greet those that are on the internet that are listening in may God bless bless you with his word we're asking God to bless his word this morning and then bless that word that's hidden behind Earth and vessels this morning amen he's come to bless his word he sends his spirit for one purpose that's to Quicken that word amen amen so we're happy to be here I hope you're happy I trust you're happy this morning you're not here by chance there's another power that brought you here you think you brought yourself Satan would have not let you come in the face of the word so it was a greater power that brought you that's Grace that's Mercy amen let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Our precious Heavenly Father we stand in the presence of the almighty the Eternal God the creator of heavens and earth The Giver of Life and The Giver of every good gift we are presenting ourselves to you Lord not to hear a man David in himself has no power nor do I have any any ability to bring this word as it should be this morning I am dependent upon thee and I pray that Lord your little bride has come dependent upon thee and in the spirit saying Lord feed me feed my soul reveal yourself to me show us Lord if we've come short show us where we let your mercy to us to reveal to it Lord and I know there's one thing your little your people your chosen your elect will respond and that's your word they will respond to your word yes save the savable this morning Lord heal the sick among us through your word save we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask these things and for thy glory and thy Glory alone amen amen amen I'm gonna you online if if you haven't a church age book I'm going to be referring a lot to those are to the pages and numbers if you want to write them down in the in the church age book brother I just call it this brother George's Edition It's the leather one if you have that or the red book they're both the same numbers I'm going to try to bring something to you this morning and continue it on as the Lord leads in the time that I have here to minister to you I want to title this the white Throne judgment all the books are opened a white Throne judgment all the books are opened and I'm I'm I'm probably going to make this only part 1A and then I'd like to continue on with this in the subject my subject here is who are these ones at the judgment and why are they there let's read out of Revelations 20. to start with your Bibles read out of Revelations 20. and verse 11. starting with I've said the scriptures other places I will be referring to this church age book quite a bit I want to I feel like I just anointed to be more of a teaching this morning and throughout this time you know teaching brother Branham said is is uh treacherous but it's a gifted there's a gift of teaching he said it's also uh cutting but he said teaching positionally places the people we're speaking would positionally placing this morning and and it it but it has to be brought under inspiration if it's not inspired by God it's just intellectual so we're depending upon God this morning to teach so you can just settle down relax I'm a preacher but I'm going to use that little office that of teaching so I just pray that God will help us to receive from the youngest to the oldest we're here in his presence I want that to be known by yours may your soul recognize that we are here in his presence amen Revelations 20 verse 11 and I saw a great white throne I'll just say this right now this is after the millennium all right so so we'll come into that more as we go along but and I saw this is John type of the Bride who is revealing these things to John a prophet an angel are you with me those that you know the scripture oh that's true amen and I saw a great white throne in him that's and him singular that sat on it from whose Faith the earth and the heaven fled away and there was no place found for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books plural were opened and another book singular was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books they're both records now amen all right they were written in the books according to their works what were they being judged by The Book of Life okay and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death this is after the second Resurrection what we're looking for what the bride's looking for is the first amen are you with me we're not a part of the second but there are those that are part of the second whether you like it or not you may go in the grave anytime but you're going to rise again because all will be at this place all will be at this judgment amen I hope you become very aware of that as we go along and what takes place and whosoever was it verse 15 and whosoever was not found written in the books of excuse me not books and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death amen let's go to Daniel while you're standing Daniel 7. see what prophet said over in Daniel he loud Lord allowed him to see that time in Daniel 7. verse 10 starting with verse 9. now the book very often referred to I still hear a lot of attorney I'll just wait just a minute Daniel everybody got it say Amen Daniel 7 9 and I beheld till Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool I hope that reminds you of something bride the prophet called him the judge are you with me the hair of his head like pure wool see the bride sees this amen and the hair of his head like pure will that that person I'm saying his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from him thousand thousands ministered unto him and Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were opened and of course we know another book was opened also you may be seated now I'm going to give you places here in the church age book I'm reading from paragraph numbers because this book these books are broken down into paragraph numbers for as other than the older book and and you say why do you refer to a book because this is the word of the Lord through a Vindicated prophet amen the Bible said the word of the Lord comes to His prophets he had no other way of bringing the interpretation of the word for the season outside of bringing it through a prophet did you know that I the Lord will do nothing but I reveal my secrets to my servants the prophets amen see now now we realize that that Prophet had the word of the Lord for the hour and somebody is going to stand here vindicating that prophecy and manifesting it and she is called the bride the message is still operating brother sister the message didn't leave when the prophet left the message is in the as that as on the scene it's in Bride form under her messenger she would be the final voice not another voice the same voice amen amen all right just wanted to clarify that on paragraph 174 of the church age book and this message I'm in the message well this paragraph I'm in the message you better know what the message is it's a sardesian church age okay so I'm on paragraph 174 I'd like to read this and it's under the heading it's under the heading where I'm reading from to the end of the message that message that Porsche is the promise to the overcomer so if you're interested on where I'm speaking this from this is where it is paragraph 175 then will come the day when all stand together as seen in Daniel 7 10. I just read it to you the king will be there with his bride of course that's his Queen with his bride the king will be there with his bride and in front of them I want you to know there was one set upon the throne but who was in the throne with him who was in The Authority with him who's one with him when you saw her you saw him when you saw him you saw her it was not two as one amen are you with me all right he said the king will be there with his bride and in front of them will be the multitude so far who are to be judged amen she's not in front of them him she's at she's in the throne with him okay yes all will be there that includes you it includes me it includes every one of us all will be there all the books are opened because remember he was there we saw the position of the bride and before him and the books were opened all right a final disposition of all is made a final disposition placing a final placement a final disclosure a final the final disposing the final the finality of all positioning placing is to be is made the Harvest is indeed over the books once opened are closed this is what we're coming to all right let's continue on here he said John the Baptist exactly what John the Baptist said he said in in the wheat would be garnered the chaff burned said bind the tares and then gather the wheat the economical move will bind the to the tear churches together for the tares must be bound first what binds them together their rejection of the word put them out of the church they are bound together under an ecumenical World Church move that's what's happening the denominations have rejected the word of Truth in this hour they've rejected it they turned it out we find in Revelation 14 they shut the door to it he the Lord was on the outside knocking on the church door they had put him out sad condition that's our day and what they've done is now Consolidated themselves against the word now they're turning to the World Council of churches which we know who's the head of that though they don't though don't Envision it we do how come we do because the word's been opened the message has come out we know who the Beast is and we know who the Beast system is the bride is not to be deceived she will not be deceived because Seven Seals have been opened there's already been a book open to the bride that's kind of a little ahead of myself but there's already been a book opened the bride has done judged herself she's heard the word of the judge to her that the case is dismissed there's no case against the bride she has no sin to be judged for amen hallelujah all right now so let's I'll just back off a little bit now the second move will be the binding this is what bundles them together all under one thing under one head and it's not God's head and it's not the word there's only two Powers she's bound under Satan's power a very religious move but bound under that all right now he said beyond the Baptist even said the chaff has got the chaff will be burned but the wheat will be gathered into the Garner it's up to him Christ to do that all right now he said for the tares must be bound first and their end is burning though they are not burned at their binding but they are reserved to a later date which is at the end of the Thousand Years or the second Resurrection but once the tears are bound the Rapture can take place now you see how where we're at once the tears are bound the Rapture can take place but what's the bride been doing these few years laying in the presence of the open sun ripening the tares have already rejected the word they're being bundled what's happening to the bride they're laying in the presence of the Sun all right what is the sun the revealed word himself revealed unveiled to her alone it isn't everybody else who do I know they are I don't know but I know I'm one of them how do you know that because I see the evidence of what he said I would know amen in me personally this this we're going to stand before him someday as individuals we're going to stand before the bride and the groom king and queen as individuals the message to the brightest individuals that make up the body of Christ it's not groups Affair it's individual affair so you this morning are standing before the king you're going to hear the message of Salvation you're going to hear what's going to take place you've got a choice to make and that choice will be based on his choice that sounds strange doesn't it but you could not make a choice to have him without him choosing you first you couldn't even have a desire for him until he put the desire in you first unless he desired for you to be what you are to be a part of him because you were in him you would have no desire to serve him amen amen amen that's right all right so he said but the tares the Rapture can take place and we'll do so be somewhere between the binding and the revelation of antichrist now we could go to Second Thessalonians 2 7. why don't we just turn there just a minute second Thessalonians 2 7. I wasn't going to read this but I just gonna just gonna second Thessalonians I think it's second uh yes yes two seven talking about the The Binding see verse 7 says for the mystery of iniquity doth already work let's just start let's just start with verse one there now beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who is he Supreme judge I'll just say it that way you'll know what we're talking about right beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him what gathers us together sound of a trumpet all right that you be soon you suit you you be not soon shaken in mind or troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day will not come except there coming of Falling Away first and that man of sin what we just read there see that man of sin between the binding and the revelation of antichrist who's the man of sin Antichrist and that man sin they the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition son of Satan who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God all right remember ye not that when I was with you I was yet was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who letteth will now let we know the prophet said he who letteth is God he that who let us will let Christ until he Christ the bride be taken out of the way amen so he who letteth will let until he Christ be taken out of the way the bride and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and so for that cause God has sent them us sell send them strong delusion that they be that they should believe a lie why because they're turning away from truth they're given a strong delusion to believe a lie thinking they're all right and don't know that they're lost amen are you with me okay all right so that so that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness oh my what an indictment huh all right now look so we just read that day will come but we're looking for the rapture the next thing for the bride is the body change that is now in progress we're coming to that position amen all right who are these righteous ones now there's going to be righteous ones now this may sound strange but there's going to be righteous ones at the judgment you say well the bride's righteous but there's other righteous amen that miss being in the bride that will come up at the second Resurrection amen who are then these righteous that are standing before the bride that are being judged by their works that are being judged by The Book of Life why are they there all right this paragraph 131 brother Branham says this he says there will be both a righteous and unrighteous in this judgment it says these righteous will not be in the bride will not be the bride for the bride sets with him in judgment so just to make you clear that this is not bride all right because the bride in in second First Corinthians 6 20 or 6 chapter 6 First Corinthians 2-3 do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters what is to be judged something discern it amen who's the discerner the Holy Spirit himself where is he today is in his place of worship he is in where he put his name and that's in his body all right know you not that we shall judge angels we who's we he's talking to Paul including himself know you not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life then in Revelation 3 21 it says the layout of CN age to him that overcometh overcome what the age the power of that age the the the the the the Antichrist system amen to him that overcometh well I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also we're going to overcome the same we way he overcome as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne amen him and his father won he said I shall be one in you I in you I and my father my father me I and you and you and me you know what we don't see anything but one God there amen for Jesus Christ was that God made flesh amen and now where is he made flesh the spirit that was in him is now in you and I the bride Same Spirit not another all right see the bride is with him paragraph 132 see the bride is with him in the throne as she is to judge the world she has to be sitting in the Judgment with him that is exactly what Daniel saw those thousand thousands that ministered unto him is the bride amen see it's the same scene for the thousand thousand who are ministering are the bride for who ministers to the husband but the wife the question now arises who are these righteous ones in the judgment there is no other place that they can come up for there are only two resurrections I'm talking about who are these righteous ones in the Judgment before the bride being judged there's no other place they come up after the second Resurrection they miss they did not qualify for the first resurrection they came up in the second which is a resurrection unto judgment the ones who qualify for the first resurrection are the bride and not in the judgment all right now then he goes on to paragraph five in the paragraph or I mean excuse me John 5 24. verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word what is the word hearing the Bible under in the church ages under every Church age the last thing was he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith to the church now in every Church age there was true and false in that church are you with me God put them together but in the end time there's a separation made and in every age there's been the True Believer that followed the light for that hour and received the message of the messenger and were accounted as bride in that time they are there in the Judgment when we're talking about the bride the Judgment it's not just the Bride of this age it's the Bride of all ages since Jesus Christ the seven Church ages they'll sit there in judgment and they will judge them of their own age their time amen yes I did speak we'll brother Brown said I'm going to be there and I'm going to give an answer for what I said I'm going to have to answer for what I said here this morning I do too amen that's why I say we're not just here to have a happy holiday we're here to meet God this morning we didn't come here to frolic and talk about the thing I pray that God will wash your thoughts and bring you such subject to Christ this morning and wash your thoughts of what happened yesterday or what you think is going to happen tomorrow and the Affairs of what took place and wash your mind and pay attention to what's being said because you're going to be there all right now verily verily I say unto you speaking to you unto you who's you he said ah Jesus saying to to his followers I say unto you verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life that word Everlasting is eternal in this particular context it's eternal life and he that hath everlasting life and who is that that is the believer that believer is already the recipient of eternal life he that heareth my word hath and believeth on him that sent me hath already a recipient of eternal life already in his possession now there's only one people upon this Earth at a possession of eternal life and that's the bride alone there's only one people that's going to go in the first resurrection which we're looking for the Rapture and that's the bride only she has the ear to hear what the spirits saith unto this church age and the only one you say how can you say that right here is the scripture amen Father Brown said all that the father has given me will come to me the scripture said that and no man could come except my father reveals me to you he that has an ear to hear what the spirit saith amen all right so it takes revelation of the word let this be first thing in your heart it's got to have revelation without Revelation you'll never be in the rapture you can intellectualize this message all you want but without Revelation you won't be there amen an intellectual an intellectual conception of this message will not put you in the rapture it takes the Holy Ghost himself that wrote this word to be in you receiving the word amen and if you have the revelation of the word it'll go through the whole scriptures back and forth it will not deviate and you can't base that on nothing else you can't base it on a Works Affair you can't base it on feelings you can't base out of whether you shout or dance you cannot base it on the fact that you can cast out Devils by the spirit of God and I believe in casting out devils in fact I'm preaching right here is casting out devils amen because it's a word I believe that but you can't base your Eternal salvation on the fact that you can do that that's not the evidence you can shout You Can Dance speak in tongues that's not the evidence that will not put you in the rapture am I I just kind of shaking a little bit isn't it you can be anointed in your spirit with the genuine Holy Ghost and still be lost and go to hell chewing that a while because the seed of God is not in your soul to receive that baptism you can have all the works you want to have speak in tongues and I believe in casting out Devils I I can never come against that because God is the only one that can cast The Devil out but you can have all those gifts and God will pour it out upon you to show who he's present but you will not receive it unless you have an open heart to receive that word itself by revelation God has to reveal himself to you he has to reveal that word to you got kind of quiet it's all right that's the truth you can't base it upon those things at all the devil hates that what I just said he'll do everything he can to keep you from that truth but that was to be preached upon and talked about brother man said at the end time was that mystery amen I'm getting off my line here but just help me Lord to get back here now watch He's reading that scripture the believer is already the recipient of eternal life which he has in his possession now and shall not come into condemnation that's judgment I'm still quoting Saint John 5 24. shall not come into judgment is what it really says shall not come into condemnation brother Brown said shall not come into judgment is what it really says but is passed permanently from death permanently from Death To Life because when that Holy Ghost comes in and takes its Abiding Place in that soul that seals you to the day of your Redemption amen that's right and then we grow into Perfection of The Headstone then we come into complete full stature of Christ himself in this hour there's your adoption amen that's growing into that perfect one that's growing in you not the perfect man it's the perfect one that's in you the perfect one that's birthed in you when you receive the baptism of Holy Ghost you're sealed right there when that Holy Ghost comes in because you can only be born again I've said this before but let me say it again you can only be born again if the seed of God is placed in your soul and if it is you'll have a genuine revelation of the truth and promise word for this season for this hour that's having an ear to hear it's not these ears it's this year amen amen amen all right so now he goes on to say and I think I'll let you see now if I'm yeah but notice carefully we must but notice carefully he said after reading that scripture but notice carefully paragraph 135 Jesus must have yet another group in mind he just identified the bride but yet he must have another group in mind who had a certain Resurrection second Resurrection will receive eternal life the righteous They will receive it at the judgment now I'm not going to get into who that is I'll get into that Wednesday night amen Lord willing because I've got I've got to go through this other right now he said they'll receive it They will receive it at the second after the OR at that second Resurrection not having previously received it as a member of the Bride amen all right now Revelations 20. I think I'll read you right now is going to put it ahead a little bit but I may come back to it anyway Revelations 20. verse 4. now this is concerning the bride amen of all ages that the bride is made up of all ages we're just a portion but without us they can't be being perfect why because what's unveiled to us is the headstone this is the revelation we step into amen is a stone of stumbling and offense to others but a glorious stone and a revelation to the Bride of Jesus Christ because it's her Capstone it's not a public show he comes and reveals himself only to his bride that's a mystery amen amen all right we'll get into that in just a moment all right Revelations 20 verse 4 and I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them and judgment was given unto them amen speaking of the Bride here and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ A Thousand Years we know that's the bride bride alone the prophet said that's the bride that's absolutely the brighter self right there but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is now he's talking about the one that's pertaining to the bride this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on which the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God in Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years amen that's what I'm heading for that's what I love him for is he'll bring me there he promised it why because I'm walking with him the token we'll come into that in just a minute all right now sermon I don't remember the name of them but 54. that's the year you'll hear me quote these 54 103 morning paragraph 102 not just those who are good people see this in other words in the judgment will be others there'll be it won't be just those who are good people they they the good people there will be good people that'll certainly miss the first resurrection the Bible said and the rest of the Dead live not until the thousand years were finished so it's more than just being good I believe in being good but good isn't going to put you in a Rapture it takes a new birth and that can't be happening without the power of the Holy Ghost to do so that's a spiritual birth in your soul that old Nature has to die you've got to die you've got to die in order to resurrect you've got to die to be born again amen you've got to die to that first nature that first husband not let him just put him on a shelf and continue just to pet him once in a while in your life he must die I know Nature's got to die to be born again because the new birth is a resurrection amen you've passed from Death unto life you've raised up in your heart your soul is raised amen you're living in the newness of Life a new creature the old things are passed away that first husband has no more jurisdiction over you he's dead he's eternally dead you are eternally separated from him amen all right now foreign he said and the Bible said the rest of the Dead lived not till a thousand years were finished is that right the that's those who had their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life but refused the baptism of the Holy Ghost now I'm going to stop here just a minute and I'm going to jump forward just a little bit and bring to you another quote here and I just feel to bring it at this time laughs foreign he said some say that the book of life is not the Lamb's Book of Life but as usual when one regards a verse superficially he comes up with a superficial understanding at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches God is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world all right you can't be something you're not you either have a true draw strong and desire for God or you don't down in that soul I said the soul not just your spirit your soul you've got to have God that's all there is to it and you can only hear one voice and that's the voice of Our Lord speak amen because he said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow all right now so there's nothing saying that there's presently a compiling of names and he said that he's because you think well I've got a new name written on the glory no that's untruth your name was written before the foundation of the world it's on the Book of Life a place there now I'm going to say this and I'm going to come to it not in this service but it'll be later on your name can be in that book of life and be removed that's the mystery that we're going to cover judas's name was removed but he was chosen of God and he had his name on The Book of Life foreign think of that amen and it was blotted out brother Branham uses the word blotted out the same blood that amen the same blood the same water that saved Noah destroyed the unbeliever the same blood that saves you can blot out think of that amen I'll just leave that with you for a while because we're going to talk about that later on Lord willing I'm not covering it now okay in this section now so you know what that ought to do to all of us we ought to set up and take notice where am I standing today this bride may be yet today is going to come up missing and some are going to be left here that is an actual fact that there's a move on for the of God there's a move on and it's thus saith the Lord the move is on for the bride something's happening we're marching whether you want to march with us or not we're marching in step with the word for the season and not fooling around with a bunch of other things that want to stick their heads up and and put themselves between you and God I don't want to get started on that because I can get going on that but that's the very thing that moved their names away was idolatry amen all right let's let's go on what we've had here we will actually show by scriptures by by the scripture that multitudes were not even who were not even born again will go into eternal life at the judgment as strange as that may sound it is certainly true and this is what we'll cover later on I don't have time this morning who are they and how do they get and give an eternal they're given eternal life they do not have a possession now they never will but at the white Throne judgment their Works testify they they can be given eternal life but there's a secret to that oh you say well see there if I'm not here and not but my Works will sure no they didn't even know what they did see you can't produce it by works you're going to be what you are in your heart I'm going to tell you right now every one of us are going to be exactly what we are in our heart today right now and right on to the end you can't change that hmm that makes us think deeply deeply where are you identified where are you presently standing where are you identified we will show that there is a group I just after reading that certainly true we'll show that there's a Greek group of people whose names having been placed on that record on that record Lamb's Book of Life Book of Life on that record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstances have those names removed under any circumstances amen now you think well God wouldn't do a thing like that you've got to remember something and keep in mind God is Sovereign he does what he wants and what he does is perfect and he makes choices by foreknowledge to say well I'm going to choose this one leave this one no he does that because he knew you before the world began he knew you'd be seated right here in what was going through your mind and what's going through your mind will meet you again at judgment right now you can be sitting here waving your head up and down and be a hundred miles from this place traveling on your thought right amen well I'm just here everybody knows I can I can pretend no let's not be a deceiver let's be genuine from our soul you either wanted to you didn't want to be here that's exactly right amen pretty straight isn't it teaching's pretty cutting listen now all right just give me your undivided attention to begin with I mean you haven't begun yet paragraph 107 to begin with there is no basis for the claims that the book of life is not the same as excuse me let me read that again to begin with there is no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the Book of Life now there's a mystery or a secret for that we're going to cover that Lord willing this morning before we close The Book of Life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's Book of Life or even the book or even thy book and also called The Book of the living it's referred that way through the Bible all right same book only names are written in it paragraph 91 if you want to look it up names means people names means people so when you see that only names are written only people individuals are written there amen they're judged by their works when the books was opened means the book of your life is absolutely uncovered we'll come to what the prophet just said about that just right quick you can see that though there are other books mentioned at the Judgment the books and then the book books were opened and then another book all right then you can see then that there is always a reference to one book containing names amen I'm laying this Foundation to you you can see then that there's only one book go back to scripture there's only one book containing names or people foreign containing the name in the individuals people he said in the Revelation it's called The blam's Book of Life or The Book of Life referred to both ways in the Book of Revelation all right let's continue on in that message we're reading so the rest of the Dead lived not until the thousand years were finished is that right that's those who had their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life but refused the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right they had the opportunity see but they couldn't come into it how many times have we said you can't stop at sanctification you said but I have been born I have been I have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ isn't that enough no you must go on and receive you either receive it or at your baptism or you're going to go on and receive it and don't stop there at sanctification the blood can sanctify you live a good clean holy life and still not have the Holy Ghost you'll still not be born again such are those in Matthew 25. foolish virgins amen they did not have the oil and yet they could they could do everything under sanctification yet they couldn't discern their hour and time they lived in amen that's right all right now let's go on he said just the elect goes in that time what's he talking about the Millennium just the elect takes the Millennium oh then brother what type of people should we be I want to live through the millennium let's lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us if the fellow says something wrong or does something this away pray for him and keep moving on let you your one alternative be set towards God if nobody helps make it you make it if nobody else makes it you make it that should be our determination it's not that I'm a part of a group and what they think about it I'm an individual before God Alone I must make my calling and my election sure and God's given you that that ability or that at that that the message to do that through amen he's not left you with any given you the tools to make your calling an election sure feed on the open word feed on the book let that be first place in your life let Christ the kingdom of God his righteousness be first place in all that you do let nothing come before you and him let that be your determination let it be a sole determination amen if nobody else make it you make it for there's going to be an elect who's going to live through Millennium and will go and will go in and out with Christ for a thousand years and then they shall go up into glory and with him and return When the resurrection of the wicked is brought forth the Millennium after the Millennium is over and before and and and aft and be and Christ will go into the Millennium with his bride and at the end of the thousand years he will return with the church return to what king and queen there is no bride will never be judged she's already judged all right we're coming into that and then the great king and queen comes down for judgment after the Millennium the white Throne judgment set the books plural were opened and there stands the redeemed Holy Ghost born Church of the Living God standing there in her beauty to judge the books were opened judgment was set and every man was judged thus that was The Sinner another book was open not for the not for the Holy Ghost Bride she'll never take it never take the another book was open that she that has nothing to do with the bride Amen in other words she's not being judged by The Book of Life let me just drop this in she's in the Book of Life and we're gonna we're gonna go and now say how that is oh yes oh yes her name's in The Book of Life but she's not judged by that book there hmm all right not like I just contradicted myself I didn't all right let's listen the books were open judge moose said every man was judged thus out of The Book of Life that's not for the bride if you're filled with the Holy Ghost this morning let me ask the question if you're filled with the Holy Ghost I'm not standing up here judging who is and who isn't if the word judges you it's not David amen I I judge my own self whether I'm in or not but I have to preach what he said I must preach the truth and let the word do the judging all right if you're filled with the Holy Ghost this morning and I pray that everybody is amen and God's power is moving in every fiber of your body what good would it do for you to stand in the judgment you're already judged and have been received and filled and already translated already translated into Heavenly places with Jesus Christ whew Hallelujah amen and making nobody else shout I will that's me he's talking to me right here you say you're pretty boastful I'm not boasting nothing I'm boasting my in all that I am to be Jesus Christ in his mercy and his grace and that has and as freely as I've received I can freely give to you if you believe it all right you're already judged and then received and filled and already translated in other words that we're now seated already now seated in Heavenly places in Christ that's the Bible Ephesians 2. not you will be you are now right now translated he's called he's Chosen and he who has chosen he's already glorified amen it was a finished work at Calvary and when he that finished that one that finished that work came in and took the book to claim what he redeemed my name was in there uh where was that book Brother David oh that book Revelations 10 2 that book was in The Book of Life he said there's only one book there is but there's parts of that book oh now you really got us into turmoil no I don't listen all right see this I'm just glad I'm thankful for a prophet today that God sent that truth down to and unveiled these Mysteries to them that he purposed was in him to reveal that mystery too I'm glad to be in that mystery I'm glad to be that mystery unveiled I'll say it again I'm glad by the grace of God to be that mystery unveiled because the mystery that God would be finished at the message of the seventh angel amen why would I be so I don't believe that Brother David it's all right I do it's an individual fair right I do I know it I'm walking with him what could the Enoch say be in the seventh from Adam I wonder what he said how you doing brother Enoch I'm perfect well you're a man yes I am but I'm walking with God Jesus said I'll not only be with you now but I'll be in you that is the bride's identification that's not a hope so that is absolutely a divine revelation to her well I just don't quite see it Brother David keep eating the book keep feeding on the promised word open up your heart and ask God to reveal his word to you don't just hope I'm in he never asked you to hope you are he said I'll give you the substance that you are the faith amen there's a face seen today there's a face seed on the Earth today where's that face Seed where is that Christ that we believe is that Royal Seed where is she she's he's in bright form all right say it the most Sublime words in the whole message is this she is him or I can say he is her he is she I like seeing that song he is she let's make a song out of that one amen but you know where God's focus is today on her that's his message it had to proceed from the prophet to his prophecy so therefore we are in the days of Elisha there had to be coming forth of a from the prophet he said I've introduced you to him I must decrease but he must increase where was he increasing Elijah did four Miracles Elisha did what eight where did it increase in the form of his wife she had his mental there's a whole message on that don't you steal it really Chris you be careful now I got I've got a copyright on that this is the days of Elisha I've already got it written down as a heading now just have patience with me I'll get to it all right now let's go so where is this book this Lamb's Book This Book of Life located Jesus answers that it's located in heaven said not we're standing in this Rejoice the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven the branch said see they're written and their names were written in heaven your name's written in heaven Rejoice not the spirits the subject unto you but Rejoice that your names are written in heaven he was talking to the seventy which left him by the way is that right they turned their back on him they rejected the word a promise manifested in flesh in their day what's the people rejecting today the same word manifested in flesh today he's made flesh in the way they didn't view him to be that's the mystery it's Christ in Bride form it's called The Bride coming of Christ all right now and that's the mystery of the seventh seal which is the rebel is the message of Revelations the seventh angel of Revelation 10. that's his message I could I'm not going to spend a lot of time in that because I could leave everything else and just go preach the seventh seal now but this is beyond that brother bran said This is the End of Time of all things this prepares you for that the seventh seal prepares you for the judgment to judge I'm talking to the bride amen all right if we didn't have that opening there would be no Rapture for the bride amen if those Seven Seals were not opened there would be no rapture it hinged on that right there and they've done been opened it's too bad you haven't sought it odd enough to see what it is and it pertains to you you you you you you me time we ought to look into it don't you think feed on it this message been around a few years what if the door's closed and the only ones that are left in is the bride what if it is I'm not saying it is what if it is if you still got a pull for him you better yield to that pull and not to your games and your videos and your things that you think you need to do you don't realize the sincere the the desperation of this hour you're playing around you can't play with this message no longer I say that in the name of the Lord Jesus you can't play with this message no longer all right let's go on and keep reading the books are open that's the book of your life when the Bible said the books were opened at the Judgment it's the books of your life in other words it's the record of your life it is but it becomes naked from the time you were born that record starts until the time you die in this life it quits and it's put in God's Library and it will come again right before everyone and you're going to face those thoughts those those attitudes amen I'm talking about every one of us this is a sobering moment it ought to be very sobering because we're right on the threshold right now very close very very very close to see the bride gone amen because she recognizes her day of her coming his coming and she's caught up in that amen exactly all right every man was judged thus the book of your life was open and every man was judged thus how were they judged by the book your name had to be in that book if it wasn't in that book your Works were not found in that book your cast as a goat Amen in that day something to think about something we ought to consider very deeply amen and something we ought to put number one in our life are we pleasing you Lord am I pleasing you by the things I say and do am I pleasing you by the way I dress am I plea what is my motive and objective when I come to church I don't like that preacher I don't like him but I'll act like a real believer be careful because God knows your heart he's already identified he knows where you live he knows your name he knows what you thought about this morning he knows what you're thinking now and he knows everything about you and where you're going to be tomorrow and where you're going to be when you walk out of this building he knows everything we ought to realize he knows you you couldn't hide any you might hide yourself from man and you might be very religious and and because I go to church and I have message books and I have tapes and I can hear hear yeah but what is it doing where are you at we don't make this message this message is not a religion it is eternal life all right when you were born I know I'm running just a little bit off here just be bear with me when them had done and went home and received their glorified bodies them talking about the bride and lived through the Millennium and was here in the white Throne judgment judging those he said would separate the sheep from the goats now they're not literally goats let me just let's let me just refer something to you here further clarify the words of Matthew and he's referring to Matthew 25 it does not say that as a that that a Shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a Shepherd dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of a Time white Throne judgment the Sheep are in the fold they heard his voice the word and followed him they are already they already have eternal life and that cannot come into the judgment the Sheep are his bride but in the Judgment he's separating as a Shepherd would sheep from goats how's he doing that by the word The Book of Life all right all right I want to clarify that now we know and I'm going to bypass some of this now there's a great record and of course science television declares that right through this room right now is traveling people cloth you know colors all kinds of things and because they manufactured something and picked that up called television what about at the Rapture what about I mean at the judgment all right now see I know there's a record do they rig oh God do they realize that every word we say it's on a record it starts when we start living in this earth and it ends when we die and it's put in God's album to be played back again at the Judgment or how are we going to escape it the damnation of God if the thing has been made so clear before us and yet we turn it down that's right just make it so clear before us you believe you're Believers I could come right now and preach a message on communion to you why don't you take communion you claim to be Believers it's a showdown time if you don't take it you have no part with him and if you take it unworthily not being born of the spirit you're giving false witness of what you say you believe it's a showdown amen go back and search and see if he didn't say that and you won't take it why don't you take it you claim to be a believer in the message you claim to believe the message why aren't you taking it you won't do this in remember himself it's probably because you've been taught something else that's contrary to the word this doing remembrance to me as long as you're here on this side I'm going to believe that but what is God he's interested in that you being right and obey his word if you don't obey him you don't love him I'm not saying well every time I got to be a communion but to refuse it every single time what's God think about it I just told you you say Brother David you don't have to be so hard I am not hard I love you with all my heart but I love you because I love you I'm going to tell you the truth you may hate me I don't care what you think about me I'm not concerned about that I'm not driven by that one thing I'm driven by is what God thinks about me and that's the way you ought to think doesn't matter what the rest of them think if I base myself on what people well they had they didn't like it or they did like it or what a mess I would be in we are I have no confidence even in this old boy none but I do have confidence in that token that's in me and I'm going to apply that token over this God help me to apply the token you've got to apply the token what is the token the literal life of Jesus Christ in you God himself in you love in you there is no perfect love outside of God dwelling in you you can have love but it's not perfect until God comes in you and lives his life amen then and then only is that life perfect that word that love perfect because God is in you and God is that perfect love you can love God from your spirit and still be lost did you know that you didn't know that oh yeah yep unless God's dwelling inside abiding living in your soul that's that is what casts out fear amen so apply the token what do you have to fear about if you are walking with God what do you fear you're walking with him Enoch was the seventh of Adam a type of our day right now Edom had a testimony he lived by raptured Faith by faith Enoch was translated that he was not found amen what did it Revelation faith amen I'm moving very quickly because I've got to get over here okay it starts your words never die you know every word you speak will never die and every vain word will be judged so see we need the blood every day to keep us clean how do we know the blood's applied because the Holy Ghost in that life of that blood is in you living that's the token amen then we can apply the token apply the blood well I just believe in the blood it's got to be more than just believing the blood you've got to have the life of the blood showing you went behind that veil of blood into the very inside of the inside the holiest of holies you meet God face to face you must have that face-to-face meeting with God amen you see where we come short there's only one group of people that are truly born again that's the bride and few there be that find it but are you one of the few well I want to be then pursue it what are you hanging back for what are you trusting in what are you relying upon there's only one that's perfect his word is perfect there's only one original word and that was God's word well I don't know brother branham's a false prophet then you show me the real one because a real one had to come first before you have a false one sin is a perversion of original of the truth unbelief is only a perversion of Truth there had to be an original first before he could have any copy you can say well that's a copy then show me the real one if you can't show me the real one then you then you are then then you think you're the real but you don't line up with the original word you have an original word brother sister remember these men that follow brother Branham they caught the vision of casting out devils and miracles and signs and wonders with like Janice and jambres that went behind him and then did everything he did you think he said hey here you can't do that no he just let him alone he was only commanded to do what God told him to do that was original look at the original look at what went first Moses went forth then Janice and jambres but until Moses had the original word of God Janice and jambres could do nothing Satan can do nothing he's powerless his only power is to pervert the original amen amen and when you catch that Revelation you're catching something amen all right everything you thought what was in their thinking will be known at the day of judgment every thought what the intents are he knows all about it I'm just going to say it doesn't matter the color clothes you wear and everything will be portrayed right before you why you did what you did why you put that tight skirt now why you did this why you did that when you were told and showed it's not right why'd you cut your hair why'd you Bob it why'd you cut it off because you were told of false things most likely by a false preacher to cut your hair you might as well shave it off to trim it I've got something I want to bring on that later on if you'll bear with me I mean not in this not today but later a true testimony of a woman that did that and was tempted to do it you just put a scissors to that here brother sister you've cut it it's no longer short I mean it's no longer long excuse me it's no longer long the Bible said you do that you might as well shave it off the same thing in God's sight to keep not one word you trespass in all of it when you know what to do the do the truth and turn away from it what then all that doesn't matter one little thing oh yes it does matter it was just one word that threw the whole thing into chaos in the beginning because one woman trusted the devil to throw her off by one word amen and you're going to get by with this not believing one word amen that's the truth all right all right nothing happens but what he knows it's recorded I'm going to get down to something here and I'm going to be done I'm going to take his law about as long as your pastor did last time I didn't hear an Amen on that no it's not about my brother's sister forgive me for even mentioning it I'm going to do what the Lord leads me to do amen if we can't set in a little bit of time and hear the word of God what's wrong with this maybe some laodicea is coming in amen amen all right I say me too God keep me from it let me die daily let me take up my cross and follow you deny myself now he knows all about it he knows whether you love him he knows whether your intentions are right to serve him he knows all about it and what will it be when you stand in that day and every sins naked before him and you stand there at the white Throne judgment how do we do that says now I'm going to go I'm going to take a little step on further here and just go on to something else not something else actually but just go on this is 1960 12 11 morning paragraph 35 how do we do that we come into Christ and are baptized into one body First Corinthians 12 one body we're baptized into the body of Jesus Christ and God has already judged that body how he could not he could not stand Us in judgment again because he's already judged that body and by the permission and Grace of Christ he brings us into himself First Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we're all baptized or birthed into that one body and free from all judgments because he stood because he's done stood the judgments oh aren't you so thankful for him he took the judgments for us she is the only one place provided that God put his name into worship that's in his body and how do you get into it by one Spirit are you baptized into that one body amen oh thankful for it he took the judgments for us no more judgment now remember we're going to deal on that sharply this morning you're either in that body or out of that body this morning no halfway between it there's no pretty good Christians you're either Christian or you're not a Christian and I'm going to tell you Christian is loose this morning you want me to tell you what a Christian is christ-like and Christ is the word Christ to be a Christian means you are tabernacling himself deity in you okay he's opened up that word in you it's a revelation of himself in you and you see him performing that doing that because you can say oh I'm a i i i why I've done this I preached in your name I've cast out Devils your name I've done all these things but he said depart from me you work of iniquity I never knew you he said many will come saying Lord Lord he said but he he says who is he that's in me is he that doeth the will of my father do it the doer comes in to do it the doer comes in and keeps you in line with the word how can you be in line with the word when even won't even respect your husband how can you be in line with the word when you're out of the word trying to take authority over a home we're given that and sidestep your own husband's desires and go in the way thing he'll never know it anyway and you say you're in the word okay I'll just let the husbands choose that pray that God will open some eyes you let her lead you around who's leading anyway she wasn't meant to be your leader I'm not talking about just disc cut and dry just uh legalism I'm talking about spiritual actual reality here you don't know your position and if she does it you're letting her husband you're letting her and you'll answer for everything that's contrary to that word you'll answer for it you better take some authority over it things are entering your house and you wonder why this is happening why that's happening why this is coming in why that's coming in because you're flirting with the Devil amen you're flirting that's all there is to it you're flirting thinking what's wrong with the little little a little Fellowship anyway you're fellowshipping with the wrong things you're fellowshipping with the doctrine of Balaam that's what you're fellowshipping with we're all one we all ought to love one another that's exactly what he said and God never forgave it we aren't one we are separated people separated unto God himself amen don't you let that Spirit come over here we will allow that Spirit to work itself into this assembly amen don't you bring that thing over into this work here God's going to call it right out and you may not like it very well when he does so listen I know why I said all that but I said it God's will be done all right there's no such a thing as a black white bird no drunk sober men hear the Christian or you're not a Christian your life is going to prove it or not prove it you say you are but you won't obey his word because this word is not your absolute where's the absolute you say well well this is my this is my absolute right here right here right here this is my absolute but you can't know this without this amen so why aren't you believing this because you don't want to be you don't want to be pushed out in the open by the unveiling of the word you want to just say well I can take this you can take this this is what this was the prophet's quote book right here but without the message I'm raising this up because the messy they're together you can't know what this word promised for this hour what the scripture said in this hour without his interpretation of God through that prophet that's exactly the truth I know there's people raised up against that but you raise up all you want about it but it's the truth amen God has a channel we must come Gods provided way of coming you can't deviate that way all right okay now I know okay let's get this done you're a Christian or you're not a Christian you're either a Christian or not a Christian you're either in Christ or out of Christ this morning this is what he said may not make no mistake about it a person that's truly born of the spirit truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that's the evidence of being baptized or born again with the Holy Ghost because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth if that seed's not in you can be baptized in your spirit have a real baptism but if that seed's not there and do the works of the Holy Spirit as far as Spiritual Works but to follow the word you're going to deviate off the word that's the fruit we know you by amen it's not the fruit of the Season go back to anointing when's the end time to see if that's not what he said how do we judge it we judge it by their Miracle signs and wonders no we judge it by the word for the season the fruit is not producing the word for the season it's a deviation off of that your life is deviating oh but I I love him no question I'm not questioning whether you love him or not but are you obeying is his Word Alive in you are you seeing the word for the season see all right okay now let's close this off are you willing give me about five minutes give or take all right so we look at the bride here Revelations 10 2 and he had a little book in his hand you know about that I'm just going to quote that I'm not going to have time to go take it and read it but you know what he said I saw another Mighty Angel descending from Heaven having the book in his hand an open book are you with me a little book The Bible said it was a little book now remember the Book of Life in the land Book of Life are the same book but here's a little book all right and brother Brandon referred to it as the bride's book amen all right so it's not something because seven seventh seals sealed that book and brother Brown said only these Seven Seals could be only open to the bride alone she's the only one that could see it okay so then there so that book contains names also and brother Bradham said it's not the name like David Dean Hart Orman Neville he said it's the mystery that's revealed there that calls your name because you're the mystery amen all right now you see yourself written used to recognize your position in the day you're not a grafted in Branch you're an original Branch from the root you're an original Orange or whatever the what it may be you're not grafted in you're not a tangelo you're not half orange and half tangerine see you're not half and half that's a grafted in living off the very life living off the same life The Same Spirit amen all right now he said let us go another step foreign just a minute now first Peter 4 7. let's go over there real quick first Peter 4 7. first Peter I'm in First Peter 4 7. for the time has come remember Revelation 10 2 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God whose house you are what's this house his body the Bride is a revelation of himself his body who must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God where's the final voice today where's The Voice the bride and if the righteous scarcely now the remember the bride's already judged this is not speaking of bride here if the bride scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear all right all right now let us go another step brother Brown says he said in our case thus far first of all we know assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election I wish I had time to go through these things but we know we're chosen in him before the foundation of the world Ephesians 1 9. says let's go over here just so real quick Ephesians 1 9. says that you were you were chosen Ephesians 1 3 and 4 chosen in him before the world began we know those scriptures you were chosen at the elect you're the elected so you know these things why I'm going to go just a little quicker over this now Ephesians and 1 9 said having made known unto us the mystery of his will who's us here the Saints the bride having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath past tense purposed in himself he purposed it in himself amen all right that in the dispensation of the fullness of times where we're at he might gather together all things in Christ how's he going to gather them by opening the little book a trumpet sounded what trumpet the final the seventh amen it opened what's it doing Gathering his people Gathering his bride the voices come out what's the voice what's the voice the bride has the voice of the Resurrection what's the shout the message of the hour did not it carry all of those what's not even even uh Ella will go there takes too much time now see referring to Gideon having a lamp a shout amen a trumpet he does all three while he descends I'll just leave it like that all right now now so so he said now we know the heart purpose I don't have time to go into that go back to page 163 or 162 163 that the Eternal God had Eternal thoughts those thoughts are Eternal that he had of you amen they were in his thinking they were in his thought that thought was substance I've already been through that so I'm not going to preach that sermon again I preach you here on Wednesday if you want to go Hear It Go hear it but that was substance that was already in him that was the face seed he already had you in his thinking all he had to do was express it he expressed it and you come in your season because you're a spoken word creation that new birth is a spoken word creation amen so you are substance in his thinking his thoughts are Eternal God's thoughts are eternal his heart purpose would have the Bride of his own choosing which he had already choose and purposed in himself so I won't go back to those quotes that I had here go back to it in the church age book page 162 163. paragraph 162 163 64 65 165. amen but he purposed like to have a people liking them to self that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was foreknown and beloved before those ever before there was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth before she was ever brought forth she was Redeemed by his blood she can never come into condemnation judgment she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her she stands absolutely sinless the bride is sinless totally brother Brown said she's perfectly totally sinless because she's in the sinless one you can't be in the sinless one and not be sinless be perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect and he gave you the the way to be made perfect come through the blood amen amen you're perfect you stand perfectly complete and sinless before him right that is what God thinks of you that's why this message pronounced judgment to you and said the case is dismissed you're sinless you're perfect not one thing can be held against you right and I have the proof of that because I have the token the token is my Assurance that I'm identified in that word I'm his eternal possession I'm his kingdom and he has taken complete control of me and I've given him total responsibility and he receives the obligation all right all right now so we're walking with God having this testimony what our testimony raptured Faith the same testimony that in a cat that please God Amen all right now you're perfectly sinless no condemnation to them Romans 8 1 no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen Romans 8 1. he that is born of God does not commit sin you say well I was born in sin that's right but you've been born again and he that's born of God look where you're born from of God if you're born of God who are you a little God you are himself so you're born of God amen he that is born of God does not commit sin because the seed of God which is who you are remains in you and it cannot sin there's no sin in Christ your identification is in Christ you have Christ you're walking with Christ you apply Christ every day you deny yourself and apply Christ you cry by Christ to me I apply it to my being a husband I apply it to being a husband I applied to being a minister so therefore by applying it to him I become a supernatural Minister I become a supernatural husband I become a supernatural wife you're a wife a supernatural wife why because you're more than a man being Christ you're more than a man you ever think about that who are you on the inside it's more than a man I have no confidence in the man I have confidence in what's inside of me makes you and I his bride but he is Veil behind a body of Flesh that makes mistakes that airs every day but he's not judging me by those things he's judging me by his thought he's expressed into word and gave the blood forth and a token to say you're underneath that word and there's nothing can move you from it Hallelujah Hallelujah that's what God's heart purpose is that's what he said you would be there's no condemnation see why you've got to have your position in Christ without that you're not going into rupture why am I saying it that way perchance or somebody that'll catch a conviction and stay in their face until they know that they know that they know that Christ lives in them if there's even a pull for that yield to it all I can say yield to it you young people yield to it don't you take what the world's given you out here don't you take religion you must be born again must be born again by the word it's a word promise of this hour birthed you come through that birth of that word promise the blood the blood I'm preaching right here what's happening the blood is going out he that receives it walks in the light amen are you are you are you what John first John said amen if we walk in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses a small sin amen all right but we must walk in the light of a light past it's the light of the promise the light of the hour baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself we're going back and and trying to preach a Pentecostal Doctrine we're preaching the rapture we're preaching Jesus Christ himself Among Us friends who do you say this is who do you say you are the real you are okay I'm gonna go through these very quickly now we're just like Enoch the Rapture were summonsed just a little bitty group but like Enoch will be taken up we're walking step by step in the light a little step higher a little step higher a little step higher okay maybe I'll pick these up sometime later almost 9 11 talks about the sovereignty of God we've got to understand the sovereignty of God he chooses whom he chooses Pharaoh wasn't didn't even have his name on the book and yet he was ordained to do what he did for the purpose that God would do him use him for you see sovereignty let God be God okay amen we could take a lot of time on that maybe we'll catch it another time now then he's made unknown unto us the mystery of his will thus if God sows thou design paragraph 159. thus if God is so designed that there's that there be those whose names are placed in a section of The Book of Life of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that where are they in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life amen now listen he said now I'm going to take these very quickly here that's paragraph 159 paragraph 164. now he goes into the wheat plant and I'll probably finish this series Lord willing with that if God so be willing but he takes a wheat plant the wheat plant the whole wheat plant is The Book of Life some die some are names removed others remain because his very life that started out as a seed would be reproduced in bodies like his in the resurrection it is at the resurrection that the Royal seed will see many Royal seeds like unto himself and they will be been as he is you see okay now he said he said the record of the wheat plants The Book of Life I repeat the history or record of this wheat plant is The Book of Life which part of the book which a part excuse me of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the Book of Life Christ died he gave his life that life was to come back upon the bride and bring many sons like unto himself and to glory in the resurrection that was paragraph 165. 164 165 and now 166. and of course that wheat seed has to have a carrier and that's what Luther Wesley and any cost per carriers then it came out of the carrier Pentecost into the light of the sunlight of the truth word for the Rapture amen and then he said let's go over it again he said about the wheat plant and then he says just part of the wheat of that plant can go back to being seed because just part of that wheat plant is eternal life wheat all right are you with me all right then he said notice how Christ the seed died gave his life planted that and it came up he started growing that life kept coming through carriers through carriers to carriers through through the it was it was in The Book of Life okay but then when the book is opened in Revelation 10 what's he revealing your section he's opening the book of the eternal life record apart a section of that book he's revealing that what seriously revealing it to for you bride to see who you are Amen to see your position and to act on it to speak with it to go forth with it amen all right now he says just part of that plant is eternal life wheat we have the same thing today now listen to this and go back to Revelations 10 2 in your heart we have the same this is paragraph 168 and I'm closing we have the same right today in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life now that's a whole section I want to talk on later but no names no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life it sounds like he's saying talk about a separate book it is separate remember how brother Branham said that in the message invisible Union he said it's like two books but it's not it's one book all right but it sounds like two books because he takes a little book and he takes that it's absolutely geared to the bride see see every one of these that get eternal life have already been rigged brother Brandon used that word by the way I'm speaking what he said your life's already been rigged that's what he said go look it up there's only one place he said it rigged or other words hard hard huh hard yeah hardwired I guess that's what I wanted to say or it's been hardwired you're going to do what's in your heart you're going to be what's in your heart your soul let me clarify that because that Soul's out inside that heart you're going to do what's inside your soul you're hardwired to do it but there's going to be a people today a people once again a people that's Royal seed brother Branham even said it on this day this scripture is fulfilled and we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled we see a bride that he said would be here promised to be here it would be the Royal seed to the Royal promised son and she was to come on the scene in this last day she's a promised word amen think of it you know your position as he knew his position it's a revelation to you if they think I've got it Brother David do you think you got it all no but I'm going to continue to feed and let him continue to open because his mercies are new every morning and I can't tell you enough how that sword has been opened and it seemed like it's opening faster and faster and faster even brother Brandon said I can't keep up with it anymore they're opening so fast out in those deserts and things you remember that why because he was coming to that place his message had to be complete and where we were coming to a completion we're coming to a body change we're walking with God you talk about the Simplicity of the body change you just go walking with God you'll become a was not that's how simple it is walk with God apply God apply the token walk with me oh my I thought Simplicity you'd be you'll just be one of these days walking somewhere and you're going to meet your loved ones and you watch you'll be changed if you're alive and remain you're gonna be changed in a moment and you know it's all it took when you were changed inside a moment you turn right around amen okay here am I he says watch no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the Book of Life that is another record what's this little book that is another record though contained in the Book of Life it's called the bride's book you see brother sister our book's been opened amen we see who we are brother Brandon said our judgment is now amen we're being judged now and you know what the judges said you're perfect amen you're in me you're me and if that doesn't keep opening up then you've got the wrong message because you're me he said amen all right do you love me today and those who had that have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation world that great Royal Sea Jesus Christ was planted that was what was that life that was in him came through the wheat plant reproduced itself in multiple wheat seeds having the same life in them see like the original like the original what because the Spirit by Spirit they are original Bible said Romans 8 11 if the spirit that dwelled in Jesus dwells in you Same Spirit watch what he said now we can see why the redeemed brought back to the original owner the bride was brought back the original owner she was in him like Eve was in Adam can never have she cannot ever have her member names taken off of the record she is a part of him she is in the throne she can never be judged everyone in the Bride is a member of him and he loses none Hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord back on paragraph 97 I'll read one more promise here or scripture and I'll read it to you Revelations 3 5 he that overcometh the same will be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and his holy angels so you have those that are in the book that are called The Bride those that miss the Rapture are still in the book and remain in the book and are given life at the white Throne judgment now we're going to find out the next time who are they that are given life and why are they given life amen let's Stand Together I'm sure I'd probably missed something I'll probably go home and say oh I wish I'd have got that but you know what God knows exactly what's been said and I believe he has control over it all God bless everybody that's come and stood this time I know it's been long a lot of people may be new here said man I've never been in a service with a preacher ever preached that long but you know what we're not like the others we aren't we are his Royal seed and we can't get enough of this message this message is not a man's message it's the message that's been promised in the word for the hour now what are you individually going to do about it I said for you to repent [Music] and be baptized in the name not titles the name of Jesus Christ not father Son and Holy Ghost but in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive this gift of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about which is eternal life in you living that gift is a baptism of the Holy Spirit and you young people if you don't have that don't you stop don't you even accept nothing like a made-up religious activity about a message if you need to be born again and I challenge I say I don't challenge I say God is challenging you to meet the challenge of the hour I'm getting old my desires I continue to bring the word as God would have me to do it but I know I've got to leave the scene [Music] unless I'm alive and remained and that's very close to possibility but there's going to be men like our brother Sean Gabriella they're gonna be sisters and men that are going to take this message and run with it like my brother Chris I know him since he was four and a half I don't mean to say that negative brother Chris but I've seen what God's done for him I said God keep revealing your word to this brother [Music] don't end deviate don't let him move from right or left if there's things in my life or his life or anybody's life that's not exactly your perfect will show us [Music] don't let us go out here and just try to try to do things to to find favor with people [Music] let me find favor with God let me obey God another Chris I know you'd say Amen to that I want to obey him doesn't matter what other people think I want to project his love and grace behind it I want to tell the truth God help me I've been through many hard battles I could spend the rest of the day and tomorrow and all next week telling you about the battles that means nothing to me God has me go through all of them go to you going through all of them what is it bringing out his character many things have happened but in all of it I say praise the Lord because God's been gracious God said merciful never has he ever let me deviate if I started to deviate brought me right back in line with it [Music] the battles are nothing we have to go through them [Music] I say thank the Lord he's given me Grace to go through him and you too his grace is sufficient and his strength is made perfect when he gets you cured up to realize you can't do nothing in yourself and you're going to have to depend completely upon him I say Lord let it be so not only me but let it be so Lord in every one of these young people young Brothers I don't know what's ahead of you but I know there's some treacherous times but just stay with Christ oh babe stay with him don't you move from it seek Him seek the favor of the Lord first seek the kingdom of God first [Music] artists this sure will is this what you want me to do show me what you had me to do and wait for him to reveal it [Music] there's Overcomers I'm an overcomer are you an overcomer this morning I want to be a part of that bride I don't want to be left here to go through tribulation you're going to give your life out there in the tribulation do you realize that but there's gonna they're gonna be they're gonna have to be purged for that they missed the message but they're going to come up someday and they're going to get life because of their stand my brother sister I want to be that bride but she's a she's a chosen people with the fruit bearing of the message of the hour though it misunderstood though it spoke against by many people but she's bearing that fruit and the Mystery of it is he's veiled in me he's coming the sisters he's on the move I we see the mystery of his coming we are that mystery that's the bride that's powerheads our heavenly father [Music] unto thee all praise all glory we've said here for a long time lord that's not been my purpose my purpose was to follow you and
