that amen amen don't put that up yet praise the lord it's good to be here this morning thank you musicians a beautiful song service thank you for the extra time brother Alex man you know we have been given an an incredible opportunity to sit here today amen and I don't say that cuz I'm the one Speaking he God I mean look at Adam and Eve they didn't they were cast out in the garden Generations upon Generations from them they didn't have this they had a promise of this amen not the building not the instruments and the singing and the preaching but the access full access to Christen every service that we come to here we should be on the edge of our seats amen what what is God going to say today if we can't have that confidence in our ministry we should pray about somewhere else to go that's right am but I believe that we're here this morning because we have that confidence in the ministry that God has called for Grace Tabernacle God what are you going to say today we're not fulfilling an obligation that's right we are acting upon a promis amen so I hope this morning we can we can we can put our thoughts and our hearts and our minds right on the right out there so that God can take them and speak to our hearts amen I'm going to invite you this morning to uh the courtroom we have some evidence we need to examine and we're going to put to trial the evidence of the Holy Spirit you can start it make sure this works my title this morning is finding evidence the subtitle of experience on trial we make sure this clicker working I think the batteries are dead again oh I can touch the screen you're right thank you well if somebody gets a chance to get new batteries and make this work that's it is easier then I have to don't come back to the pulpit so this morning I want to talk about finding evidence and I I want to I want to continue on to what we talked about last time I ministered which was on emotions position so this isn't technically part two it's a it's an extension because I found myself being too confined if I stuck with that title or that subject so I wanted to step on and and there's some things that come into play when you thank you sir when you deal with experience when you deal with with with something someone saying I got the holy ghost or or someone saying they got the Holy Ghost and this this goes in line with emotions because we're human beings and and and we and we only have five senses we have six actually the Sixth Sense is Faith yes science has proven that we have that as well so we have the ability to access the spiritual world don't worry we'll we'll stand and read the scripture in a minute here but so when it comes to that element of emotion there's something that that we that we we we apply that those terms or or the evidence of that emotion to if we're not careful we we we put that to an experience somebody had an experience someone is having an experience and so today I want to I want to look at that I want to look at um a couple of things what role does an experience play in the New Birth what role does emotion play in an experience and how do we know we know Christ now at the end of the day we could we could all say the same thing we could all say well we know Christ because Christ is in me and and and and uh an experience is receiving Christ and being and the new birth and the all of that is is is being able to say Amen to your word and those are those are the right answers but I want to by God's help Deep dive into what what this looks like there there are surface level answers that I'm sorry they are fine to communicate a subject but they are not enough to teach they're not enough to to to to just say those lines and move on no that you got to go into the word of God and say what does God say because if you're not careful you just take one little thing out you say well this is what God thinks about the topic but God has given us an entire book 66 books 1100 sermons there's a lot to God and we're going to Experiencing God and and understanding God for eternity so we have to be careful not to just gloss gloss over these things that God has given us so real quick couple quotes I thought I only had okay this is a longer quote we'll jump to the scripture can you guys jump to the scripture real quick then we'll come back to this quote here so Jeremiah chapter 2 I believe it is I don't want to spend too much time before we read the scriptures there we go Jeremiah chapter 2 verse 11 okay awesome Jeremiah 2 vers1 please stand with me in honor of God's word since we're in court this morning I could say all rise for the honorable Judge Jesus Christ amen hopefully you brought him with you amen Jeremiah chapter 2 verse 11 and this this thought started to come forth in many different stages be when I was listening to the sermon broken sisters so this is where the scripture comes from Jeremiah 2:1 hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no Gods but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit be astonished oh you ye Heavens at this and be horribly afraid be you very desolate saith the Lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and hewed them out sists broken sists that can hold no water let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord we we we we've studied we we put time and and Lord I I I pray that we we've got slides and PowerPoint and if we're not careful it just becomes an intellectual lecture I pray this morning that wouldn't happen that you would keep your spirit would have freedom to minister to us this morning Lord this is not just psychology Lord this something there's an element to this this is the living breathing word of God and Lord we have the desire God for you to to grow our hearts to grow our minds to to to catch a revelation of your word that that we could receive it that it could Dro down into our hearts that it could change us what point is there today to come here and leave no different God help us Lord Jesus to attain your word this morning may you speak to us may you push aside the the the the the our thoughts our opinions Lord even those sitting here this morning who have opinions may they lay those aside this morning that you could speak to our hearts I ask father and rightly divide the word of God in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated this morning so let's jump back to this quote so not only did in Jeremiah we just read not only did they create sisters they were broken sisters that's right so if you if you listen to the tape broken sisters you understand what a sistern is but just for the sake of context this morning a sistern is a man-made well that collects water from the rain amen so it only has water when it rains so someone if someone only has an experience when it rains but they don't have a something that that gives them the ability to live a life after that it's simply a sstn that's collecting water now when the W when when it rains the rain soaks into the ground and that and that'll go in that'll come into the ground and that's how that's where water comes from as well but so it's the same effect the rain's falling but there's something about the living Fountain G the Bible says fountain so there's something coming from the inside the the the it's not a sistern it's a well right there's always water coming okay and it and it it it doesn't stop amen if if it's dry you're not dry that's right am so in this in this quote here personal experience with god brother bam says he says you notice of a morning when the Dew I've watched it many times when I see the de fall at night time look out there see the d fall and every time when the sun comes up did you ever notice how happy a little do drop was for us the last past few days it's been Frost in the morning he just Sparkles and shines and sparkles and shines I was asking one one morning talking to nature which was my first Bible I said what makes you Sparkle little do drop and it seemed thank you for getting this working and it seemed like that something in a way spoke back to me said you know last night I was up there I know I'm going up again for I belong up there so the moisture came from the atmosphere and and fell upon the ground and and the d drop is speaking back say I I woke up this morning and I realized I belonged up there I'm going up there again Way Beyond this old hot Earth up there where the moisture stays and I was once up there and I'm happy because the Sun's shining on me and when the Sun Shines on me it'll draw me right up to where I was so he's going back to where he came from and something excites him what is it that it excites him remember we're talking about emotion and and I really pray the Lord help me not go off to this tangent where I'm going to try to support an opinion I just I just want to talk about preach on the word of God and and help bring light to ourselves how we balance Our Lives how we balance our ourselves in the in the church and in everything that we do and so he what excited him and maybe there's some you know in confusion around this subject whatever reason God's going to minister and because I have faith in him so he Sparkles not because of of the earth not because of the grass that he's on or wow he's on the president's lawn the DW drop does not care whose lawn he's on whether that lawn has been mowed or it's overgrown whether he's on the the the tip of a of a leaf of a Sage Brush whether he's on the the the the the the very top to of the the of the of the California Redwoods he does not care what excites him is the sun is shining on him and he knows that the effect of the Sun is going to draw him back up that's right okay that's what makes him Sparkle that's right that's what makes him excited okay he says and I think that's right the reason you can do that and Sparkle because you've got an experience amen so remember experience on trial this morning experience I'm not going to go there so you because you've got an experience you was up there once amen that's right the energy and the inspiration that comes from that Revelation that Revelation cannot be impersonated that's right the energy the sparkle can be but that Revelation cannot be and and we're going to bring those to case this morning and I think about that that a man's ever been born again and took out of this life into another realm of blessings and glories one of these days the son of righteousness will shine across the Earth and those with them kind of an experience what is the experience he's talking about I we're going to get to to bring this out more but I want to get your minds in the right direction what experience is he talking about he's talking about experiencing the realization the Revelation that you belong to Christ amen that is the experience that he's talking about we'll be caught up to meet him in the air so when you're in the service and and God begins to speak to your heart or you're at home listening to a tape or or or a sermon I'm trying to stop saying tape because they're not tapes anymore at home listening to a sermon of the Prophet or reading your scriptures or reading a devotion or or walking through the through the woods when some something strikes your heart and you brought to Remembrance in a moment that you're not from this Earth You don't belong here that that chaos that you see around you you don't belong in it you don't belong to it you're not involved you do not care amen right that is what made brother brown run around the tree that's that is what makes a real Son of God son or daughter of God Express themselves that's right however some people putting their hand up I mean you just reached a pinnacle of their expression but there's something happening inside of them and when that's the case because it's not a sstn it's a living water when that's the case and they walk out into the dry desert that the world is they're an they are an oasis of life amen what life that's it the Life of Christ that's right amen up there where they have been in the Realms of G glory and love lost themselves lost themselves you know one of the one of the Prime examples of brother brandom and and he's judging those women who are who are playing the the the washboard and playing the piano and they start to dancing in his church you remember that story when he's a young pastor and he starts to judge them then he starts to think wait a minute you know David danced and all these examples he puts it this way I came to myself dancing that's right something took him over he didn't go out there and say well I'm going to start dancing that's right nothing in the music queued his response it was something inside of him could not contain anymore that's right and that is a real experience and all that's around them they don't care who's around them they once been up and when they get into them kind of conditions with an with anointing of the spirit that Master Spirit Jesus Christ will come someday to claim his church Hallelujah okay so we read this scripture already but there's two evils that his people God's people are we God's people there's two evils that we find ourselves in it's always two right twins it's always two false True Vine amen okay fear Faith it's always two they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters so he's bringing us into context of the example okay the example is comparison of The Well of Living Waters a fountain a spring and a sistern what's the difference one is manmade right okay so he's not just saying You' forsaken me then you've hewed Out Sisters no he's saying who he's identifying who he is and before God ever makes a comparison before God ever makes a comparison before we can make a comparison we have to identify both sides of the equation you cannot compare on something you don't know that's right you cannot compare on on something you don't understand boy that's a problem in the world today that's right people are comparing so two evils forsaken the fountain Living Waters sisters the interesting thing is when a sister is full of water visibly visibly there's no difference there's water in both for the context this morning all water comes from God okay all water comes from God proverbs 5:2 it is the glory of God to conceal a thing with the honor of Kings is to search out A matter okay so why are we if the holy spirit is a magic pill why do we need the scripture that's right it's not a magic pill you know the Holy Ghost is the bottom of the pyramid there's been some gone back and forth the holy spirit's up there at the top no the holy spirit's at the bottom of the pyramid take that through the message through through the scriptures you will find that emphatically proved because from there what is Faith the holy spirit is a recognition of the faith that you have circumcision of the heart amen Abraham did not get the promised son till he was circumcised then he walked unto adoption amen he built his way through the statute of a perfect man many many examples to scripture so when you get the Holy Ghost it's not a magic potion you're suddenly going to have perfect marriages you're suddenly not going to have any problems that's right you have just begun amen that's God has concealed a thing amen God has concealed his word in Simplicity amen it is now up to you to search out the matter amen how how where do you even start the Holy Ghost is the inward teacher he leads you he guides you he he's he's if I could have the Liberty to make this example he's a librarian and you go to the librarian and this is at least how it used to be so I've heard in the old days and say hey this is the subject I'm studying and they can say okay I can recommend this book this book this book this book this book but it's your job to read it amen God has recommend recommends every Sunday every Wednesday a book to go read amen that's right it's up to us to search out the matter amen there's something in your life and we all know it's in the back of our head saying well if I just read more if I just prayed more now we take that quote where brother say you can talk too much you can read too much but you can't pray too much and then we don't do any reading balance balance so God conceals right look at what did the if it was good enough to just hear God speak and move on why did the disciples come to him and say Jesus can you explain to us that Parable that's right they were searching out the matter they care you can tell in the meeting a lot of time not every time but a lot of times in a business meeting you can tell when people are paying attention if they ask you questions that's right if there's no questions it's either a very obvious topic or nobody listened okay John 7:43 so there was a division among the people because of him you see I struggled to figure out how this fit to be honest with you but God May me leave it in there because if you're not if if if we're not careful Lord help me make this point we're called to search out the matter right yes okay if we're not careful we we we fall into this this example here so this is where this scripture comes from it comes from this just before this so there was division among the people because of him so Jesus just got done ministering and and and and John 7:50 to 53 Nicodemus saith unto them he that came to Jesus by Night being one of them he says do our law so the Pharisees Sadducees right there's division in the religious leaders says doesn't our own law judge a do our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth so Nicodemus has already had a personal conversation a personal interview with Jesus he was seeking out he wanted to go so often today this is a good P good lesson for your personal life don't assume go talk to the person go talk go talk to them so the same thing in the word of God if we hear something said and and and and we were quick to say well I've never heard that before and I've been in the church for 40 years I've been in the church for 20 years my parents been in the church whatever however long whatever whatever excuse you're going to use to then not go search out A matter you fall right into this error which is they answered and sent unto him art thou also of Galilee search and look for out of Galilee ariseth no Prophet that is true that's right but they missed amen it because they didn't even bother checking right and every man went unto his own house division came in there was a separation there because they didn't search out the matter amen God concealed himself in a illegitimate birth that's right and a census right there was a some Shepherds and a few wise men who quickly vanished after the experience too often I find in message culture when someone steps outside the message Norms not the word message Norms we excuse it immediately and we are just like the religious leaders of those days sir who who the Pharisees and Sadducees who are they today the church that's right am we are not immune to this problem finding evidence go ahead take it go to the word of God ask God to show you listen pray pray God preach to the preacher that's right amen that's right I wonder how many times we struggle to find the will of God for a sermon because you're not praying that's right yes sir that's right or I'm not praying so experience I think it's important to Define you know it's it's hilarious we all speak English and English is a complicated language and we all assume definitions of words constantly you hear them used and you're like no that's not what that word means dictionary is one of my best friends I I have to constantly look words up with the material that I that I listen to and at work people write documents sorry didn't understand a clue you just said let me get my dictionary so experience by definition is the apprehension of an object through or emotion through the senses or mind so what happens is is it's just like when you're training a a dog and he does something good you give him a little treat then he knows hey that thing gets me this treat so as we when when when something happens somebody there's an anointing happens on falls on somebody there's an they they have a um uh this manifestations we say they had an experience and our brains because our brains psychologically like to simplify everything if it's too complicated our brains get um what's called sensory overload so we like to simplify things that's why computers are in a nice plastic shell because if we could see all the components working it would be overload for our brains sheetrock on walls right okay so cars and the the covering of the cars you open the hood you're like especially nowadays like wow shut the Hood um unless you know what you're looking at so we like to simplify everything so if we're not careful as we grow up because I think this is the problem today in the message because of of of we're now a couple Generations into this okay we're a couple Generations into this and so we have seen these things happen over and over and over again and heard the same words said and experience and so then we say that's an experience okay now that could be anything right that could that's how the Pentecostals believe speaking in tongues you had an experience okay but by definition in those scriptures an experience when discussed so we take that example of an experience in our personal lives in the church and we then when brother benam says experience we apply that to that so that's why we're looking at the definition of the word the apprehension of an object through or emotion through the senses or mind active participation in events or activities leading to the culmination of knowledge or skill the knowledge or skill so derived so you have you know someone like a carpenter or an engineer they have experience if they've had the chance to work in that field for a time they gain knowledge or skill an event or a series of events participated in or lived through you know I ex somebody experienced the war of Iraq right so they've lived through that the total to totality of such events in the past of an individual or group so experience is so much more than just emotion through senses that's that's just one of the meetings experience is knowledge the knowledge of Christ okay so it's not just an emotional senses or or something in your mind it goes much much deeper than that okay evidence we hear that word a lot as well evidence of the Holy Spirit Well what is evidence evidence is the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid information drawn from personal testimony a document or a material object used to establish facts in a legal investigation or admiss admissible as testimony in a law Court signs or indications of something the side out side has evidence that there's a church here called Grace Tabernacle there is evidence is pointing to something it's pointing to an individual it's pointing to a truth and in the context that we're talking about today because we are this is not a lecture we are talking about the evidence of Christ right we we we as Sons and Daughters of God with the revelation of the word even even outside of that people have can have revelation of of of God exists and they begin to see evidence supporting that theory then it becomes truth so now when you when evidence points you to a truth now you have an entirely different Benchmark cuz you are looking at everything through this truth that's right if you lack that truth your evidence is different circumstantial this means pointing indirectly towards someone's guilt but not conclusively proving it now you'll see the word guilt used a few times but what I mean is is is is a Vindication that God that you know Christ okay so not guilt Guilty by associ guilty because you are part of the body of Christ but not guilty in a negative way of a description containing full details okay direct means bearing immediately and unambiguously upon the facts at issue okay so we're talking about finding evidence a couple definitions there kind of got off this I lost you a little bit I could tell so couple definitions there now let's step into remember we we're looking experience is on trial our understanding our definition of experience what it really means is on trial and we're Desiring this isn't a this isn't a court case to to to to say well you're you know we're going to knock that off no this is this is more of an of of an ex of a uh we're looking to find the truth okay well I guess that is any court case circumstance schedle evidence is a type of evidence in legal proceedings that does not directly prove a fact but allows for an inference to be drawn about the occurrence of that fact circumstantial evidence relies on inference and deduction so there's there's a there's a there's a robbery you you know robbery just happened you pull up to the store and you see somebody running out of the building they jump in a car and they race away that's circumstantial evidence that they committed the robbery this involves facts and circumstances that when considered together lead to a reasonable conclusion about the existence of another fact stay with me direct evidence is evidence that directly establishes a fact so it's ey testimony it's it's video footage photographic evidence documents that directly prove a fact that something happened it's a tangible evidence in other words direct evidence is evidence that if believe believed proves a fact on its own okay you're all sitting in a church building that is direct evidence okay so now in in a court case there can be both circumstantial and direct evidence we're going to go to law school for a second but it'll help bring us bring us to our point so when is circumstantial evidence dismissed if it is dismissed when direct evidence is presented so if direct evidence is presented if the direct evidence is strong and conclusive the circumstantial evidence May no longer be necessary to prove because it may be deemed irrelevant okay so the directive evidence undermines the circumstantial then they can dismiss the circumstantial evidence if the direct and circle circumstantial evidence contradict each other they will dismiss circumstantial in favor of direct uh if if if the if if it's complimentary in nature the direct and circumstantial evidence May sometimes complement each other with the circumstantial evidence providing additional context and support for the direct evidence okay circumstantial evidence is still important even when direct evidence exists okay now to bring you to point brother brandham said bury your religion if it has no em motion circumstantial evidence supports direct evidence so they are kept together it can help to cor corroborate the direct evidence and provide a more complete picture of the events in question if the direct evidence is weak or inconclusive the circumstantial evidence may be crucial may be crucial to the case the burden of proof always remains with the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt Beyond a reasonable doubt this includes considering all evidence both direct and circumstantial when reaching a verdict so the verdict we're after today is how do you know I'm me jump back to that slide oops wrong slide help me out guys um oh there we go it's still scrolling is the what role does an experience play in the New Birth what role does emotion play an experience how do we know we know Christ so the verdict is all of these have the same answer what is the conclusion how how do we know how do we know okay you know that person per se had an experience with God how do we know we had an experience with God if that's in question or just for definition sake how do we know what is that what is it May preach what is the Holy Ghost more than once it's important for you to know what this is what is the definition of this of of of this subject what how how does what are the implications of this how do we use this to judge situations excuse me get excited lose my voice so that's the verdict that we're after and now we are presented with with uh both sides so what is in the context of the Holy Spirit what is circumstantial evidence if threw a couple things in here it's not an exhaustive List full range of OT of full range of emotions within a church service holy dress coming to church testimony I mean you can all think of a lot of different things those are circumstantial evidence so they are important they are part of the verdict is am I or are they a son and daughter of God now the point of this sermon again is not for you to look across the Pew and say yep they don't have it or yes they have it that's not the point the point is I want Grace Tabernacle to know the truth amen I want you to know the truth this is not just some thing in out there in space well we got the holy ghost or they got the Holy Ghost no this is an important thing because many many times people people go through experiences where this is not even evidence there there is nothing supporting it and they are told something so they believe it that's right amen anytime in the book of kings that Israel went off the rails they took the king's word over Gods that's right the leadership's word over Gods I'm not saying we have a problem with our leadership here but I'm saying right now you should know you you responsible to know what the truth is about this subject cuz if you know then now you're a beacon of light because I'm going to tell you from personal experience this subject is very misunderstood in the church world today amen Message Church World very misunderstood and we just excuse it and say Well if they have it they don't have it but I have it well do you have it yes do you have the evidence to support your theory do you have the evidence to support your what you say is truth you come into the courtroom guess what they're going to take that evidence that you have presented and go through it front to back you're not going to decide your own verdict a jury is the jury and judge are both the same Jesus Christ so it that's why we have to examine Our Lives if this makes you uncomfortable today good go examine your life say God I I thought because I did this and this and this that's it or maybe you're struggling you're sitting there like man I wish I had the ghost wish I had the ghost and all the time you are Chuck full of the Holy Ghost you see this especially in camps now I'm not I I really I promise you I'm not trying to support an opinion or point across the fence not at all this is just experiences we're we're we're people are constantly feeling like they have to go back and get the Holy Ghost right because you're you're struggling and and and and uh and the uh amorites defeated you why did who was it who somebody help me out who was it that defeated Israel when Ahab had sinned a Ain had sinned he anybody to remember the name of the of the tribe he sinned at Jericho but okay whoever it was they fought next okay you all know what I'm talking about that tribe they fought next they lost to them not because they didn't Cross Jordan they already got the Holy Ghost they fell to them because in their cuz you talk about Israel now you could say as the whole church or as an individual there was something lingering in their lives that wasn't lining up with the word of God they had the Holy Ghost they were moving unto adoption right so you are on a journey moving unto adoption and you lose a battle you don't need to go back and cross Jordan again you've already been there you've already done that amen there you go but you are pursuing Perfection amen now you did something wrong you make it right right you kill aen that's right his whole family his cattle and you burn the booty with him everything there's no me remembrance you take the ashes and you throw them in the wind no remembrance of that get rid of it completely annihilate it that's why you ever wonder why Israel was so brutal that's why it's in a type for you and I that's how we need to treat sin in our lives amen don't stop till it's all gone amen amen but we just read here that circumstantial evidence is dismissed if it directly contradicts the direct evidence so someone has circumstantial evidence of the Holy Ghost you have circumstantial evidence of the Holy Ghost you're all here today looking very holy and dressed nice everybody here has circumstantial evidence but tomorrow later on today do you have direct evidence that's it because if you're feeding from a sistern that's it you won't that's right incidentally sisters get full of all kinds of junk that's right so pipes get clogged because there's giant cockroaches in the water or giant bugs in the water right rats fall in there squirrels fall in there oh Adam's not here but The Well of Living Water that's it nothing clogs that that's right that's exactly right A lot of times they'll find Wells that the the PSI or the whatever you call the the pounds the poundage the the the force of the water is astronomical they have to tone it down so it can come out your faucets at a mediocre speed so it doesn't blow your sink up right that's that we're talking about the most powerful well that there is on the face of the planet in in all of eternity in the universe and in the history of the world it is the power to blast through your corroded pipes the Holy Spirit comes in your life this is you got rotten pipes suddenly you got water everywhere because the Holy Spirit shines a light on your error amen so you go fix the pipes call the plumber to come fix it up fix your house so circumstantial evidence so we cannot so you can go on circumstantial evidence alone if direct evidence is not present but in our case direct evidence is always present right amen that's right it's always present amen so we cannot base our Eternal destination off of circumstantial evidence that's right we must base it upon the direct evidence but if your religion does not have emotion go bury it you need circumstantial evidence okay because these things manifest to the outside when Christ is inside of you this is what happens now not everybody does all ranges of emotions right I had to just include that I I'm really tired of the subject of emotion can I be honest with you I'm really tired of it like why do we even why are we why are we talking about that so much let's just get Christ and and get on with our lives just stop getting so so worried about that you clap or not I mean I think you should clap in respect to the Min and the song leader and help help the service but you dance you shout who cares cool great for you do you have Christ that's all I care about and that's all I want to preach about so I have to include it for the sake of the example but let's stop talking about it and just move on okay thank you holy spirit is the direct evidence now I went to make a list and I thought nope I'm going to leave this up to the prophet a court trial he says like we claim to be saved they say well show me how you're saved my life proves I'm saved see that's it praise God Amen I'm not amening myself I'm amening the word of God it's that simple amen folks it's that simple look at your life the the complicated part about it is looking at yourself yourself retrospectively but that's why the Holy Ghost is present that's why you come to church that's why you take communion remember that story of was that Danny Henry went to before the presence of God and every little thing he done wrong suddenly was glaringly obvious obvious if you have a life and you see somebody who's okay with with with with with sins um that aren't glaringly obvious because all Sin is Sin so there's no little and there's no big sins it's all sin but some of them are glaringly obvious obvious some of them are not you see somebody who's okay with that kind of stuff little R-rated movie here or PG-13 here little words here and there right then they come there's they're lacking the atmosphere so you say God I want to be as close to you as possible do the things that create the atmosphere in your home that's it okay amen so my life proves I'm saved so direct evidence the way I act proves whether I'm saved or not no matter how much I testify and it's interesting because I got this the quote I got this from is is from the Dynamics search message search um that Steve coffee and some some brothers over in um uh somewhere uh Puerto Rico or Portugal sorry they did and um the the the context is from I think it's from message Hub so Message Hubs all their quotes are I was actually I had a chance to be part of it I I didn't do it I was a young guy I was like no this is too much work but the the some of the youth and people at the church there they listened to the sermons and they typed it out so it was straight and fresh from the sermons and in this quote it says about a year you'll know in the table it says uh you about she'll he or something like that I didn't go and listen to it so go back and listen to this quot listen to what he says if he says about a year or not but I thought that was very interesting because it's a much different context when he says now no matter how much I testify about a year you'll know how I live whether I'm saved or not so in context I think it's about a year so in other words some time has to pass that's the point he's making there time has to pass I tell people all the time give it time tell people all the time give it time I tell people a lot give it time let time time isn't a miracle uh you did you know that time is a tool in God's hands yes it is he used time to bring out his Redemption plan amen so he's he's Eternal but he used time to bring out his Redemption plan so time is a tool in God's hands that's why gel that's why Nicodemus said the same thing give it time that's right okay yeah here fighting against God what Les she be fight found fighting against Goden so that's why some someone gets saved comes to the church we don't immediately put them in office give them time right amen we they could have been they could have had the most profound experience now I'm using the context of emotional or mind or or changing of their life experience where that they just everything changes boom I don't care because there's a Bible a scripture in the Bible says the seed fell and sprang up quickly that's right but life killed it that's exactly why because it wasn't didn't have a foundation in the word it didn't have an exp experience that's right a revelation okay so you give people time amen that's where a lot of times people get caught up in in schemes and and and and and um uh scams give it time give it a second think about it sleep on it I mean just take that one example if we're talking to personal lives take that one thing apply that and you will minimize 80% of the M the the the the bad decisions you make sleep on it that is totally my opinion so same way it is by healing if you accept it and believe it you're going to act like it so he's preaching court trial he's talking about Mr skeptic Mr impatient and Mr unbeliever and they said well I was prayed to be healed nothing happened and so that's the context of the sermon he's ministering on so he says same way by healing if you accept it believe it you're going to act like it you have to give it time amen right brother M said the angel comes your way okay so there's going to be such because God's trying your faith not because God can't do it then oh sorry I'm going to have to put you okay you got cancer you need to be healed I can schedule you for uh September 23rd 2025 can you live till then that's not God God is Not inhibited by time he us his time okay so he's testing your faith there's going to be such a change in you there's nothing can take it out of your mind he's testing your faith for yourself as well that's exactly he's building character because if you have to have faith for a longer period of time it's kind of like it's kind of like um stress over time right that's what builds resistance is stress over time that that they stole that straight from God's laboratory remember the devil can't create anything he can only pervert it so stress over time has been proven time and again by science to increase endurance so you want to run a marathon you you can't just run a mile once a day you're not putting your body underneath enough stress for a long enough time so you go the marathon you'll fall apart about mile three four maybe okay so God puts you under stress over time to increase your faith endurance that's right amen so there's going to be such a change in you there's nothing can take it out of your mind no no more than your salvation it's God's word you've got to accept it on the same basis by faith you are saved Jesus said to the woman who touched His Garment he said thy faith has saved thee that's right now see okay she touched His Garment she was healed instantly her faith that's right her faith was already at the point it needed to be right amen that's right she why because she had heard about him amen he wasn't a stranger who walked by she knew who she was touching oh pra God if you know who you're touching what a difference that makes in your life what a difference that'll make in the decisions you make if you know who you are that's why that's so important you want evidence you want direct evidence that God show me where I am who I am today know who you're touching amen how did she know she read about it she heard about it y that's it every time there was a new uh every every every Sunday or whatever whenever she got the paper she went straight to the front page cuz Jesus made Front Page News for three and a half years she went to the front page what's Jesus doing today oh when the the Pharisees had a comment or two to the journalist she excused it his unbelief and she kept reading now what did he do that's right what did he do and she knew who she was touching many times that's where our faith lacks it's because we don't know who we're praying to that's it that's exactly right we're not praying to The Ether we're not praying to the void we are praying to the God who created you amen right amen and if you know this if you if you search out the matter if you know what God's word says then you know what he's capable of Amen if you never heard that God saved could you believe he could save you no absolutely not you've got to accept it on the same basis okay now I'm not a scholar by a long ways but I have looked up a few words now that word there comes from the Greek word Soo which means save just like material ially saved or spiritually saved you're saved Soo he saved her from a premature grave just the same as he saves you from Hell Soo the same Greek word is used notice thy faith Soo has saved thee from the sickness that you had notice same word every time amen amen another circumstantial evidence addressed in this quote that's right fleshly demonstrations but what is the truth of it the seed is wrong to begin with that's exactly right am that's really powerful that's right absolutely it's really powerful when you can tap into the Revelation that every seed brings forth of its kind we we say that we have I've heard that my entire life but you have to come to the realization of that you have to see that in practice you have to see that happening that's it will you realize there's no other thing you can do amen so what do we want to water that's it we don't want to water the weeds we don't want to water them we want to water the wheat that's we want to water the true word of God amen amen you know somebody said to me one time and if they if this gets back to them we're we're we're bosom friends and and we we had these discussions before but they said to me well yes but why don't we you know yeah we know there's fakers in there but but but but what about the real ones so we're going to we're going to keep focusing on circumstantial evidence was basically what he was saying and and I I I it just didn't sit right with me and I and I I thought about it I thought about it for months and and I just I had this I was singing about it one night and I believe God spoke to my heart and he said why Point him to the thing that can be faked that's it when you can point them to the thing that can't be that's it that's right that's right that's why I'm saying why are we talking about emotions still let's Point Let's Point each other let's point the church to the thing that can't what's the word somebody help me what's the word that brother bam used reproduced or ah you talk about the third poll okay I can't remember the word but he says this thing cannot be imperson impersonated thank you let's Point them into the thing that can't be impersonated we talk about we talk about hey you know it's all let's talk about the real let's talk about the real and not worry about the fake then why are we talking about the fake why are we talking about fleshly demonstrations and emotions and all of this things and all we got to impersonate the Pentecost look go read the book of Acts it wasn't just chapter 2 there's several chapters where they just they just lived their lives they endured persecution they kept to the word of God they had all night meetings where Paul just stood up there and talked that's right I mean the guy fell asleep and died right that was the book of Acts amen that's right forgive me if so the seat is wrong to begin with so so all your fleshy demonstrations don't mean nothing that's right though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity it profit me nothing though I could move mountains and have not charity it profiteth profit me nothing though I give all my goods to feed the poor and have not charity it profit me nothing if I speak with tongue like men and Angel it becomes like sounding brass and tinkling symbols listen Church Pentecostal nothing why it's a hybrid SE am he's talking about the Pentecostal denominations it can't come to the word now there you are that's it that's rightall in 1 Corinthians 2 verse 11 I don't have this one on the slides the scriptures say something that I just just hit me for what man knoweth that's it okay they're going to bring it up for us give them a second it's 1 Corinthians 2:1 for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him a lion has a lion Spirit that's it and could never do do the things of a man that's right ever they can't walk on two feet I'm going to jump to it so I can see before and after scriptures they cannot do the things of a man because the spirit of man is not in them that's right to have a to have to have to consciously be aware that you are an individual and that you can use your hands and you can think rationally and you can make decisions and and and and and all of these things you have to have the spirit of man someone who is a man that I'm not saying man I'm talking broad male and female here just person can't do any of those things what do we call them dead even so the things of God knoweth no man man amen you literally cannot know God outside of the spirit amen of God if you approach the scriptures through the spirit of man you will miss God absolutely if you approach a service underneath the spirit of man that's it you will complain about the length that's it or the short that's it but if if you're there to hear what God has to say because you come under the spirit of God who are you going to hear that's exactly right you're going to hear God if you judge something by the spirit of man you will judge it outside of God that's right that is exactly man the the the the the existence and the mental faculty of a human being has so many branches based on experiences and information that we have collected over our lifetimes and and and biases and and and and and all these things but the center of that should always be truth amen the world loves to say well that's just your bias and that's his bias and this is my bias and say there's no truth that's not true to know the word of God you must come at it through the spirit of God Amen say brother Chris we have heard that yes I hope every service you've heard it already God brings us out on the youth this morning in young adults class he bring us the word from different angles because you look at me if you just if you only ever saw this half of my face and you saw this hack you your brain would have a hard time determining is that Chris take yeah you need a full view you can't just get God from one angle that's why he gave the fivefold ministry which if you think about it five is the full circumference of our hand that's it in other words complete amen complete the fivefold ministry is complete amen all of that we must have to bring us a balance but we have to approach it with the spirit of of God you cannot see see it without Christ amen and I so but if if you go back up to verse 9 says but at as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit search all things y the Deep things of God searches the Deep things of God don't excuse it don't don't don't don't say well you know hey you know you're getting too technical it just got to be Holy Ghost and we're down here no no no no no you can't even search out the things without the holy Holy Ghost that's right it's not the end it's the beginning amen that's right we want to we want to we want to pursue we want to come under Perfection because when we reach Perfection What do we do we leave this earth because our okay so here's the thing the reason you leave this flesh robe is because it's imperfect that's it and when your spirit your soul becomes perfect that's it the two can't stay together that's right that is why Enoch raptured that's right he had the rare experience because God wanted to make an example where his soul reached Perfection and his body couldn't hold him amen that's why we must always pursue Perfection we must always be seeking for a higher order a higher plane a higher station a a a a the highest rung of the ladder because we want to we want to come to that position amen and then we're gone amen that's why we have a theophany CU God said hey I can't have souls just drifting around in eternity I want to seeed them so he made a body for you that's perfect that your soul can then come into super technical sounding but it's the truth go read your Bible that's what happens so Brother Paul's been preaching on this the cup of iniquity if you fill the cup with Christ with the Holy Ghost the iniquity automatically flows out of it that's right so if you got problems in your life life you don't focus on those problems you focus on getting more Christ and he will push those problems out and he does so by giving you divine inspiration and wisdom on how to address them sometimes problems are not as simple as stop doing sometimes there are complicated complex things that we have to deal with for the spirit searches all things he the Deep things of God that's it verse 12 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us see amen see it's been freely given but you got to have the spirit of God to know it what is experience what is evidence the spirit of God Amen they Revelation that I don't belong here that's it how do you come to that revelation of I don't belong here that's right you come to that by SE searching out that's right the matter by by by by by pursuing the Deep things of God Amen because as you learn about him see your mind your your body everything guess what where did it come from the earth the Dust so you have a lot of unpacking to do yes a lot you take somebody who's been who's been been been been told for 20 years never had a mirror been told for 20 years they're green try and talk them out of that impossible impossible till you show them a mirror y that's it see you are actively talking yourself out of damnation yes sir amen by what pursuing the Deep things of God guys don't be a surface level Christian if you are a surface level Christian you'll live a surface level life that's right there is so much in here I mean okay this is just a slice of God yes sir yes I mean this in comparison to who God is you you cannot even see it you could have put it on the tip of a pen you couldn't put on the tip of a needle this broke but this is what he gave us that's right in other words this is the slice we need amen amen so is it good enough to just know by grace are you saved no is it good enough to know well brother randam was sent by God Malachi 4 no no is it good enough to know justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit baptism in the name of Jesus Christ no no because this book judges your life amen there are levels in our lives we have not even come close to touching that must be Min amen amen they must be excavated but we will never get to them if we don't get deeper into the things of God if we're too worried about dancing in church we will never get into the teaching of the word of Goden brother bandam says evangelism calls The Sinner to Christ he says teaching positionally places the church exactly right do you see why that is such a distraction in the world we live in right now in The Message Church world today why evangelizing and and high energy and and all of these kind of things why that is such a big deal and why it's important is because it's a distraction because it's the opposite of what we would call in our human Minds teaching although it's the same anointing that's right amen because where are we going to go how are we going to learn that we're the bride how are we going to know we don't belong here the word must be expounded to us amen if it was good enough for just justification you would have been born in Martin Luther's age that's it but you weren't that's it you were born today day amen and this is not going to be a popular opinion in the message that's it in the message it's not going to be a popular opinion but it's what's going to get you out of here amen is understanding who you are how can you understand who you are if you're constantly running around in the space of half an hour there was silence in heaven secretly God came down and said bride that's it is who I am that's it that's right exactly right and he slipped away and left the truth with you amen he's present right you understand example your life can take me back to the slides I do not believe saints of God that you can live a life with a higher standard and be if you want a life here I don't do not believe that your level of understanding of God can be here that's right amen it has to be here amen amen that's right you have to say I want to be a better Christian praying is not okay praying is enough okay because God will lead you to read right so maybe that where you start actually that's the best place to start say God I want to know you more give me wisdom and inspiration on what to read where to read it and when I read it speak to my heart that's why brother man said don't read it like a newspaper that's what he means that's what it that's what the meaning was that of that was the revelation of that subject for the man preached on the bride tree amen we love that topic in the world today when I say world I'm talking about message Church puts forth another Branch it'll be just like the book of Acts so I bring this example to to to bring this home not to point fingers or say anything anybody life cannot bring anything forth but the life it is but the vom saw that tree that had it had it had oranges and it had lemin and it had grapefruits and all these things and and and and and and and he says which I find it can I have a couple more minutes I find it amazing that he gives the story of the man first then he brings this example he's talking about the evidence in this man's life he said the guy was W was you know cutting up concrete for 25 to 30 cents an hour and then he surrendered his life to God and he said he has got five children he gave $3 million a year to the church never said how the man attended revivals and ran across a platform and spoke in tongues that was never addressed the evidence that brand Bram used was the life that's it he led exactly even if you don't have a if even if your paycheck is small you should have success to match that paycheck exactly because you a child of the king I can take that to heart better with things but anyway so he sees this tree and and he says well okay but but but but next year um I think exactly how he puts it but I'll just next year he says well okay if another Branch grows um or next year he says okay yeah but next year they'll all be oranges and he said no no no no the lemon Branch will be lemons the grapefruit Branch will be grapefruit and he says well what happens if the tree grows another limb says it'll be oranges you see saints of God do you know how long it takes another Branch to grow and then to put forth fruit time but time is your evidence time is your direct evidence circumstantial evidence will support if if the circumstantial evidence and the direct evidence lines up and it's an orange then you can keep the circumstantial evidence it supports circumstantial evidence is it's a tree and it's an orange tree and it's growing another branch right but come fall time they're all branches on the same tree through the winter well it's Citrus in or California so maybe in the winter is when it grows but in the off seon it's just a bunch of branches but then leaves come out and leaves say h circumstantial evidence is saying you're not an orange Branch that's it circumstantial evidence is saying you're not a that you're not a lemon branch and many people will go off the leaf alone but you want direct evidence yeah let the fruit that's it let the fruit come forth that's the focus that should be our Focus are the fruits of Our Lives proving the presence of Christ or are the fruits of our life withering up because you can be a child of God but the fruit just it's an orange but I wouldn't eat it that's it right that's exactly right but you fertilize the tree you protect it from the bugs and then you wait a whole season a whole year if you will to see did it work and the oranges come out and they're just perfect am God says amen peel that thing open that's a life pleasing to God Amen but the Holy Spirit you see brother talking about adoption he says the Holy Spirit Come to him and said Your son's not doing what he should be doing he's feeding them weeds and all this stuff all the while that man is a holy ghost filled Son of God but he's not come to adoption that's it amen you have to come to adoption here in this Earth because what good is the ability to write checks in heaven that's it you don't you people say well adoption is when we Rapture I'm sorry the ability to write a check I don't need that in heaven amen that's right there's no banks it's all free amen because I've already paid the price amen he's already paid the price but you need adoption here so therefore if you take those truths you see you take truths and you run them through the scriptures and I'm closing magicians want to come you take those truths and run through the scripture they disprove a lot of things because a lot of those things are based on circumstantial evidence but if he takes the truth like the checks are no good in heaven you don't need those there right you got to be adopted here and then you take that truth you say have to be adopted here you have to have the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is the inward teacher he's the tutor and you don't have the tutor until you have the Holy Spirit then that means there's this point in time where you can be a holy ghost filled child of God not acting like it amen that's it Bud Southwick had a problem with smoking we know the story it's an awesome story what gave him the ability to quit the Holy Spirit that's right he already had it two days before puffing on a cigarette he was the Holy Ghost filled Son of God Amen but then something happened and finally finally he caught a revelation I don't need this that's not every EXP experience is overnight saints of God not every experience does somebody get saved and quit smoking and quit all that stuff right then and there in that moment that's not always the truth that's right okay now take it a step higher because I don't believe any of us have those problems take it a step higher your bad attitudes your your your grievances your your offenses your your little things and your isms and your clicks and and and you see it this way and you know you know you say well I'm going to sit s on the back pew to just show them and stuff like that what what what's that you're not you're not adopted right an adopted son of God has Divine love amen acts with maturity as far as serving God and it reflects in the Natural Life see somebody who can't you see we we we want to talk about I just make one last point we want to talk all about the experience and all of these things and we can't even have a good marriage yeah our children are falling AP falling apart I'm sorry there's something missing there you need teaching you need teaching on how to lead a family according to the word of God yeah how to deal with your children when they're young when they're middle when they're you know in their late you know 10 age when they're teenagers when they're adults how how they how they go to be married if the Holy Ghost was the magic pill we wouldn't have to teach the young adults how to find the right mate yeah but that's where we've come to in the message World well just get the Holy Ghost you'll find the right one no you won't no that's right that is not enough because you need to know what the word says now God can lead you on your own he can have mercy and sovereignty to lead you on your own but he will lead you through the scriptures you're not just going to walk through your life suddenly catch it no you're going
