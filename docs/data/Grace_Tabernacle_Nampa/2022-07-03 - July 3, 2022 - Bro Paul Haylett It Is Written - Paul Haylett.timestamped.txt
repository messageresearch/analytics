[35:52] just touch your hearts today
[35:56] you know as we look at this time
[35:59] coming up on a holiday
[36:01] commemorating the birth of a nation
[36:05] people say this is what we did to make
[36:07] america but you see god placed america
[36:10] in revelation
[36:11] before man ever had the idea of a nation
[36:15] amen and in that nation that god birthed
[36:18] in revelation 13 he placed you and i in
[36:21] that nation put us here today for a
[36:23] reason for a purpose not just to
[36:26] celebrate you might say freedom
[36:29] but to celebrate a freedom that goes
[36:31] beyond anything man ever thought of
[36:35] i'm thankful for this sacrifice that's
[36:37] been made through the ages to allow you
[36:39] and i to have the freedom we have today
[36:42] but i just want to make this point this
[36:44] is my real point here the only real
[36:46] freedom we have today is in jesus christ
[36:50] [Music]
[36:52] while we celebrate all the years
[36:55] of what we call america
[36:59] i'm happy to say
[37:01] sons and daughters of god through the
[37:03] ages have been able to celebrate the
[37:05] freedom
[37:06] it is the true freedom
[37:08] it is not a freedom in name only it's
[37:10] not a freedom as a mirage but a freedom
[37:14] that behind an iron curtain there was
[37:16] freedom
[37:18] behind communist china there was freedom
[37:21] in the jungles of africa and south
[37:23] america there was freedom
[37:26] and in the most you might say refined in
[37:28] one sense nation on earth we have it the
[37:31] easiest i believe of any nation and yet
[37:34] we see the downfall of many a person but
[37:37] god has given us liberty in this place
[37:42] in this house of god today we have
[37:44] liberty not because of what was done in
[37:47] 1776
[37:49] but because of what was done on calvary
[37:51] and even more current you might say of
[37:54] what he's done in our life
[37:56] this morning
[37:58] hallelujah because you can look back at
[38:00] yesterday and say oh praise the lord i
[38:02] was prayed up i was on fire for god but
[38:05] that ought to be your testimony this
[38:07] morning
[38:08] that god is here god is present my god
[38:11] is powerful and he's breaking every
[38:13] fetter amen there's not a single fetter
[38:16] in your life that you look to this
[38:17] morning and say but this is what's
[38:19] holding me back let god break it
[38:22] in fact i declare to you god has already
[38:25] broken it amen
[38:26] it's just time for you and i to
[38:28] recognize this fetter this chain is
[38:32] already i was just reading so beautiful
[38:35] i was reading the prophet of god says
[38:37] now you have to look at this don't look
[38:39] at this as future tense you need to look
[38:42] at the word when he said you're healed
[38:44] he's not looking at the future it's
[38:46] looking at the past hands the only time
[38:48] probably a believer ought to look back
[38:51] it's already done
[38:53] it's already finished i'm already
[38:56] delivered from the yoke i've already
[38:59] been set free in christ jesus
[39:01] and i've already rose up
[39:04] into heavenly places
[39:06] claiming my rightful position in jesus
[39:08] christ
[39:10] oh hallelujah
[39:12] hallelujah
[39:14] you know what's really exciting
[39:16] you can find this in the message i
[39:18] encourage you to go read it there's just
[39:20] a handful of quotes
[39:22] you know what the real thrill in my life
[39:24] is
[39:26] see the birth of the bride amen
[39:29] the prophet of god put it this way it
[39:31] says it was there
[39:32] in word form yes sir
[39:35] hallelujah i'm glad
[39:36] let let me be born
[39:38] amen that i've become a perfect
[39:40] reflection of jesus christ
[39:43] hallelujah
[39:45] hallelujah
[39:47] i want to speak to you this morning
[39:50] on
[39:51] our position of strength once again and
[39:53] i want to
[39:54] speak with the title of it is written
[39:56] thank you so much and
[39:58] sister heidi i'm so happy to see you in
[40:00] your proper position
[40:02] amen hallelujah isn't this beautiful
[40:06] vika smile big because you're next on
[40:08] the list
[40:09] hallelujah
[40:10] and then we'll move right on down in
[40:12] fact let me just put it this way i don't
[40:13] care who you are or what you think about
[40:15] yourself this morning if god has placed
[40:17] a gift in you
[40:19] you need to break that bondage that has
[40:21] it i i can't do that i couldn't get up
[40:24] in public i couldn't say this i couldn't
[40:26] play
[40:27] i might make a mistake
[40:30] come on young people
[40:32] god's given you a talent exercise it for
[40:35] the glory of god
[40:37] not that people would look at you
[40:41] hallelujah
[40:43] that was a pretty dead response but i'll
[40:45] claim it anyhow
[40:47] amen
[40:48] hallelujah
[40:50] now it is written is often associated
[40:53] with the temptation that jesus had in
[40:55] the wilderness and as he come out of the
[40:57] wilderness i should say and satan was
[40:59] there to tempt him and uh our lord jesus
[41:02] response was it is written it is written
[41:04] that is often how we
[41:06] relate to the words it is written we
[41:08] think okay here was a time and it's
[41:11] written and i stand on that but i want
[41:13] to take a little different look at it as
[41:15] written this morning and i pray that
[41:17] this would be a blessing to your heart
[41:19] as we turn in our bibles to revelations
[41:21] 1 and starting with the first verse amen
[41:24] we just want to to
[41:27] be mindful because i'm telling you
[41:29] saints i am sorry but i have the king's
[41:33] buffet
[41:35] this morning
[41:36] hallelujah we didn't go over to the
[41:38] china wall
[41:40] we didn't go over here to this place or
[41:42] that place to partake in the buffet we
[41:44] came to the king's buffet this morning
[41:47] and i'm telling you the king's buffet is
[41:50] so big
[41:51] amen it's got everything you need right
[41:54] now those of you who eat green things
[42:00] it's there
[42:02] to those of you brother roar that are
[42:05] meat and potatoes
[42:07] it is there
[42:08] and those of you that like to indulge in
[42:10] dessert it is there
[42:13] and the thing is
[42:14] god's given you an appetite
[42:17] i don't know why i think about it this
[42:19] way but you know whenever your body
[42:21] changes and your body goes into ketosis
[42:25] and all of a sudden your body says you
[42:26] you don't need all this extra stuff here
[42:29] and your body starts to change and your
[42:31] metabolism kicks in and you uh you you
[42:35] start you know eating more and people
[42:36] are saying you eat so much how can you
[42:38] be so skinny well i'm telling you i
[42:40] don't know something happened and i i
[42:44] i'm not getting fat on laodicea because
[42:47] i've got a different diet now and that
[42:49] diet is promoting me to be hungry
[42:52] and that's why when i come to the house
[42:54] of god i'm hungry when i get up in the
[42:56] morning i'm hungry and when i go to bed
[42:58] at night i'm hungry
[43:02] because something's happening in me
[43:04] i couldn't make it happen
[43:06] but it did
[43:08] oh can someone say thank you lord
[43:11] thank you lord just pour the food out on
[43:13] us lord
[43:15] amen revelations 1 1-6
[43:19] the revelation of jesus christ
[43:22] singular right
[43:24] which god gave into him
[43:26] to show unto his servants things which
[43:29] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[43:32] and signified it by his angel and to his
[43:34] servant john now some people i've heard
[43:37] read this first verse kind of confusing
[43:40] because you see the the revelation of
[43:42] jesus christ which god gave unto him to
[43:45] show so they then start thinking these
[43:47] are john's servants
[43:49] no no these are not john's servants
[43:52] john is a servant amen
[43:55] amen amen
[43:58] who bear record of the word of god and
[44:01] of testimony of jesus christ amen and of
[44:04] all things that he saw
[44:07] firsthand account
[44:09] right
[44:10] not second-hand account
[44:11] these are the things that he saw
[44:14] blessed
[44:16] is he that readeth
[44:18] and they that hear the words of this
[44:20] prophecy
[44:21] now i want to take just a couple moments
[44:23] sorry keep you standing but
[44:25] see the whole book of revelation
[44:27] is prophecy
[44:30] now the proper interpretation
[44:33] is
[44:34] the book of the apocalypse
[44:37] but you see
[44:39] for you and i
[44:41] it's not an apocalypse
[44:43] if the lord would be gracious i wouldn't
[44:45] want to speak out of turn but
[44:47] this
[44:48] is the book
[44:49] of joy
[44:50] unspeakable
[44:52] and full
[44:53] of glory amen
[44:58] we preached last week the judgment
[45:00] begins in the house of god and when that
[45:02] judgment is complete saints it leaves
[45:05] you and i not with a tarnish
[45:08] or a scuff
[45:10] but it leaves you and i polished clean
[45:13] holy righteous
[45:15] beautiful in the eyes of god
[45:18] this
[45:19] is our jubilee amen hallelujah let's
[45:21] live in jubilee today saints don't be
[45:24] looking for a jubilee somewhere down the
[45:25] road live in jubilee today because
[45:28] you've been called by almighty god
[45:31] hallelujah
[45:32] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[45:35] hear the words of this prophecy
[45:38] and keep those things which are written
[45:39] therein for the time is at hand
[45:44] hallelujah now look at this my brother
[45:47] and sister as we look at this
[45:50] now i just hope
[45:54] that we can catch this
[45:58] john to the seven churches which are in
[46:00] asia
[46:01] grace be unto you
[46:04] and peace
[46:05] from
[46:06] him
[46:07] which is
[46:09] which was
[46:10] and which is to come jesus christ the
[46:13] same yesterday today
[46:15] and forever
[46:16] and from the seven spirits which are
[46:18] before his throne
[46:21] and from jesus christ who is the
[46:24] faithful witness and the first begotten
[46:27] of the dead
[46:28] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[46:31] unto him that loved us
[46:33] and washed us
[46:34] from our sins
[46:36] in his own blood
[46:39] you see judgment beginning in the house
[46:41] of god
[46:43] is you stopping long enough
[46:45] if you don't mind me putting it this way
[46:48] you stopping long enough
[46:50] to say lord
[46:53] wash not only
[46:55] my hands and my head
[46:58] wash behind my ears
[47:00] scrub my elbows
[47:04] my hinder most parts
[47:06] you know what that is that's the part we
[47:08] hide
[47:10] scrub me
[47:12] and lord i'll stand here amen
[47:14] and i'll bear
[47:16] the scrubbing amen
[47:18] i'll bear the cleansing
[47:20] i'll bear it amen
[47:22] amen because i want to be dead to
[47:25] everything but you lord
[47:26] amen therefore i will endure whatever
[47:29] chastisement correction
[47:31] i will bear it all lord for you
[47:36] amen because he washed us from our sin
[47:40] in his own blood and path
[47:42] i love this verse
[47:44] let's really focus on it because it's
[47:45] going to be a little portion of our
[47:46] foundation today
[47:48] now all that god has done my brother and
[47:50] sister he could wash us in his blood and
[47:53] he could have calvary and all of these
[47:55] things but he didn't have to do a single
[47:57] thing with you
[47:59] at that point you realize that god had
[48:00] no obligation to do one thing other than
[48:03] to say i'm gonna i'm gonna save you
[48:06] i'm going to come down i'm going to save
[48:07] you
[48:08] but look what god chose to do look at
[48:10] the beauty of verse 6
[48:12] and half made us
[48:14] that's us
[48:16] can someone say amen that's us
[48:20] kings and priests unto god and his
[48:23] father to him be glory and dominion
[48:25] forever and ever
[48:27] amen heavenly father bless the word
[48:29] today i pray in your name amen
[48:32] you may be seated saints
[48:35] you know it was a
[48:38] kind of a remarkable thing for me saints
[48:40] i
[48:41] went to bed last night and just the way
[48:43] i study and stuff and
[48:45] i had some thoughts down i had scripture
[48:48] down as we've just read
[48:50] and got up this morning and and felt
[48:52] like i had just walked into a wall
[48:54] and it's like okay stop
[48:57] i cannot struggle through this because i
[48:59] realize i just simply can't when the
[49:01] mind is blank
[49:03] then there's just not anything you can
[49:05] do you could pick up a thousand books
[49:07] you could do everything try to stimulate
[49:09] your mind but then what brings us to a
[49:12] place you stop and say well lord okay
[49:14] maybe my thoughts are what i was going
[49:16] to express lord let me you see we have
[49:19] to come to that place we say lord let me
[49:21] express what it is you want expressed
[49:24] and when you come into that position
[49:26] then the doors open and things just pour
[49:28] out and you realize the notes that you
[49:31] had in scriptures you had are all the
[49:33] same notes in scripture but a different
[49:36] thought a different uh avenue that god
[49:38] takes you down and and uh so as i was
[49:41] reading this this morning once again you
[49:44] know uh i i just realized how that god
[49:48] can allow us as in our studies and our
[49:50] thoughts to to start down the path but a
[49:53] decision of right or left or uh straight
[49:56] ahead or whatever it is not really our
[49:59] decision if we need to leave it as god's
[50:01] decision and that's why as young people
[50:04] we don't want to just plow ahead
[50:06] stubbornly in our own thoughts and ideas
[50:08] but we want to stop because you see
[50:10] while god you know i preached this in
[50:12] south america at a camp meeting and
[50:14] there was in a building there is
[50:16] actually a school and it was kind of
[50:17] interesting how that uh the lord just
[50:20] allowed this thought to come and maybe
[50:22] i'll just express it for a moment if you
[50:24] guys got an extra five minutes to spare
[50:26] and you know so it's here it is god
[50:28] trying to bring us to this place right
[50:30] here but you know when we make the wrong
[50:32] decisions when we make uh uh ideologies
[50:36] out of things and we're gonna go our own
[50:38] direction and we decide you know i don't
[50:40] really want to go the way that you know
[50:42] it seems as this is the church this is
[50:45] the message this is what they want me to
[50:47] do i i'm going to reject that i think
[50:49] what i'm going to do is i'm just going
[50:51] to go do my own thing and so here i am
[50:53] moving through life moving through my
[50:55] own situation and i i'm thinking i'm
[50:58] making my own decisions and i i think
[51:01] that i'm just doing what it is you know
[51:02] that i want to do and that's the best
[51:04] thing for me and i'm in and out of
[51:06] situations i'm in and out of the days
[51:09] and the ages and the places and the
[51:11] friendships and we see how that god
[51:13] would then allow us to come and we think
[51:16] that we're still in our own path doing
[51:18] our own thing and we would come and find
[51:20] my brother and sister that we are moving
[51:22] along and the years are going by isn't
[51:24] that scary
[51:28] it's july
[51:30] yesterday it was january
[51:32] and we're moving and we're thinking i'm
[51:34] doing my own thing
[51:36] and i'm just you know it's it's life is
[51:38] tough i don't care who you meet i don't
[51:40] care where you go there will be rich
[51:43] people my brother and sister that are
[51:44] depressed and have anxieties they have
[51:47] sicknesses they have struggles and they
[51:49] have all of that but a son or daughter
[51:51] of god one day and because this isn't
[51:54] quite as expansive of a building is that
[51:56] when one day you wake up and you say i
[51:58] just got to serve god and you realize
[52:00] you're at the point that god called you
[52:03] to in the very beginning but god rich in
[52:06] mercy
[52:07] god rich and mercy said they thought you
[52:09] were lost over there they thought it was
[52:12] done for you here and they thought they
[52:14] would take you away there but god rich
[52:17] in mercy brings you right back to that
[52:19] point and then you'll be like paul and
[52:21] look back and say i wish to god i had
[52:24] not wasted 21 years of my life
[52:27] but i can stand today not with tears or
[52:30] remorse but with tears of praise and say
[52:33] thank you lord while it looked like in
[52:35] those 21 years it wouldn't work but you
[52:38] brought me back you put me back on the
[52:41] rock again and it's you and you alone
[52:44] amen it that's right oh hallelujah
[52:48] look i hope you don't mind this morning
[52:50] but i'm going to be boastful i am a king
[52:54] i am a priest
[52:56] in the kingdom of my god
[52:58] i'm not just some weary pilgrim
[53:00] wandering through a dark and dreary
[53:03] pilgrim that's almost ready every single
[53:06] day to give up on my christianity
[53:10] i'm a son of god
[53:12] hallelujah
[53:14] oh
[53:17] now you look at this and have made us
[53:19] kings and priests unto god and his
[53:21] father to him be glory opinion forever
[53:23] and ever
[53:24] look at this when i i thought it was so
[53:26] interesting as i was reading this
[53:29] last night just reading again through it
[53:32] trying to find an inspiration not
[53:34] realizing what the lord would desire but
[53:37] you see someone my brother and sister
[53:41] someone
[53:42] has
[53:44] been exalted amen
[53:47] the word is never empty
[53:50] the word has not just got words to fill
[53:52] it up
[53:53] they didn't need to you know publishers
[53:54] today if a book is too few pages nobody
[53:58] wants to buy it because there's no
[53:59] content if it's too many pages people
[54:02] won't buy it because they're like i'll
[54:04] never get through that book
[54:07] the bible wasn't just filled up full of
[54:08] stories and words
[54:10] so that it'd be just the right size
[54:15] every word
[54:17] has value amen
[54:19] thank you lord for the word
[54:21] thank you lord for the word
[54:24] and he hath made us kings and priests so
[54:27] my point here is when i read that
[54:29] something spoke to me and said someone
[54:31] was exalted
[54:33] amen someone has been lifted up from a
[54:37] position that they were in previously a
[54:40] position that was in a lower state can
[54:43] someone say thank you lord i have been
[54:45] delivered from my lower state i've been
[54:48] raised up to another place called
[54:49] heavenly places i've been elevated i've
[54:52] been exalted oh you're a boastful you're
[54:55] a boastful man you make mistakes too
[54:58] that's right but it wasn't me that
[55:00] elevated me it was god that elevated you
[55:03] amen because if it was us we will fall
[55:06] off that podium or off of that pedestal
[55:09] but when god puts you up in the heavenly
[55:11] places god says i have the answer for
[55:13] you i put you there and i will keep you
[55:19] oh i there you too many christians live
[55:21] in fear they're going to fall off the
[55:23] pedestal the devil's going to knock me
[55:25] off and then oh all my years will be
[55:27] wasted you trust god and the devil can't
[55:31] knock you off of that pedestal he will
[55:34] try oh yes he'll try and you might think
[55:37] you're a failure but why don't you stop
[55:39] long enough to consult your god and ask
[55:42] him what he thinks
[55:45] we consult the devil all the time but
[55:46] you know what the problem is
[55:48] the devil just gives free advice
[55:52] and god expects
[55:54] something out of you for his advice
[55:56] and look at the world we live in
[55:59] have you ever noticed that just recently
[56:00] we were looking at a little document or
[56:02] whatever
[56:03] and i thought well i don't know maybe
[56:04] there's something online
[56:07] so i typed in the little query into the
[56:10] search thing and you know
[56:12] the the page i don't know i think
[56:14] there's like
[56:15] i don't know how many just page after
[56:16] page
[56:17] free legal documents
[56:20] all you have to do is
[56:22] give us your credit card number
[56:25] so that we can verify your
[56:28] human your address and your social
[56:31] security number and your bank account
[56:32] number and
[56:33] but it's free
[56:35] isn't that the way the devil works
[56:37] all you got to do is just well just go
[56:39] ahead and just
[56:41] i'm not going to charge you nothing
[56:42] today
[56:47] but at the end of it all
[56:51] fine print
[56:53] if you use this site 25 times we have
[56:56] the right to charge your credit card 98
[56:58] dollars
[57:00] sounds free to me
[57:02] and that's exactly where the devil's at
[57:05] you can live frolic run jump holler all
[57:08] this time but there comes a day he says
[57:10] oh you didn't read the fine print the
[57:13] fine print says when you come to me for
[57:16] my consultation i'll let you go for a
[57:19] while but after a while i have to charge
[57:21] you
[57:22] it's actually just to cover the overhead
[57:25] because you see pitchforks and flaming
[57:29] whatever anyway we'll skip out
[57:32] they cost a lot
[57:33] but someone my brother and sister
[57:36] has got to be
[57:38] exalted wonder who that's going to be
[57:43] is this going to take place in the
[57:44] future
[57:46] or is it already
[57:48] finished
[57:50] he's already
[57:54] provided amen
[57:56] oh lord would you come on this sea no
[57:59] what he's wanting to you is to stand up
[58:01] and say lord you promised it i'm not
[58:03] going to be arrogant i'm not going to
[58:05] come the prophet of god talking about he
[58:07] was somewhere at a place and there was
[58:09] somebody there praying they had a prayer
[58:11] line and the guy is screaming to the top
[58:14] of his lungs as though he's casting the
[58:16] devil out by screaming another one they
[58:18] grab an old man and they're almost
[58:20] beating on him to get this spirit out of
[58:23] him the prophet of god said none of that
[58:25] works it is that personal relationship
[58:28] with jesus christ that allows you to
[58:30] speak with authority
[58:33] and in that authority you're able then
[58:35] to stand with quiet confidence
[58:39] and here i am telling you that while i
[58:41] yell at you
[58:42] what a paradox
[58:45] but the yelling isn't what i do the
[58:46] yelling is the excitement bubbling up
[58:48] inside of me amen kind of like run away
[58:51] the bottle just explodes that's christ
[58:54] in you the hope of glory they can't
[58:56] bottle it up they can't keep it under
[58:58] control it is in you and it must come
[59:02] out it will come out
[59:04] because you can't stifle the life
[59:08] oh the devil would like to and old cold
[59:10] dead formal churches would like to but
[59:12] i'm telling you the holy ghost in you
[59:14] cannot be contained it will come out
[59:18] and it's powerful
[59:20] hallelujah
[59:22] now look at this
[59:23] what is happening here in this exalting
[59:26] my brother and sister
[59:28] god doesn't care about the carnal
[59:30] there's a whole realm in the world
[59:31] that's like well if you have the holy
[59:33] ghost or if you really feel that if
[59:35] you're fulfilling the word of god god
[59:37] wants to give you a big house
[59:39] god wants to give you a swimming pool
[59:41] with your big house god wants to give
[59:42] you a seven car garage with that big
[59:45] house and swimming pool but none of
[59:46] that's any good if you can't buy a
[59:48] maserati so god's going to give you lots
[59:50] of cash to burn and this is a sign that
[59:53] god loves you
[59:58] look how many people it snared
[1:00:02] look how many
[1:00:04] and it snared some
[1:00:06] right within what we call the message
[1:00:12] but what did the prophet say
[1:00:15] the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:00:18] there's a lot of different things some
[1:00:20] people say it's speaking in tongues
[1:00:22] some say it was oil in the hand blood in
[1:00:25] the hand blood in the forehead
[1:00:27] got all kinds of things
[1:00:29] but i love how the prophet of god
[1:00:30] brought it down and he put it so simple
[1:00:32] simple our our children can grasp this
[1:00:35] and he said the evidence of the holy
[1:00:37] ghost this is the version i like okay
[1:00:39] because there's several quotes and you
[1:00:40] can kind of take it however you want but
[1:00:42] this is the one i like he said it is
[1:00:44] believing and acting hearing believing
[1:00:48] and acting on it not just i heard it
[1:00:52] and i believed it
[1:00:54] and someday i'll
[1:00:55] do something with it
[1:00:58] hallelujah
[1:01:01] hearing
[1:01:03] we're going to have an emphasis here in
[1:01:04] just a few minutes hearing
[1:01:06] believing so it went from here
[1:01:09] into here
[1:01:11] and when it was in here it came back out
[1:01:15] here
[1:01:19] not like those that sounds critical but
[1:01:21] i'm just stating the facts not like
[1:01:23] those who you would never guess they
[1:01:25] were a christian until they told you
[1:01:26] they were yeah
[1:01:29] god help us we've all probably had that
[1:01:31] moment
[1:01:33] but it's not that we are boasting oh if
[1:01:36] there's one to boast it's only upon the
[1:01:38] lord
[1:01:39] but it is there that these are the
[1:01:41] evidences of life that have to come out
[1:01:44] it has to be manifested out because we
[1:01:47] can say we're a christian but if there
[1:01:49] is no outward manifestation then we
[1:01:52] would have to wonder how deep the
[1:01:53] revelation of what a christian is
[1:01:57] okay so god's not concerned about the
[1:02:00] carnal side my brother and sister but
[1:02:01] what god is wanting to deal with is in
[1:02:03] the spiritual realm as it comes down
[1:02:05] that he starts to exalt us now you say
[1:02:08] well what do you mean by exalt there's a
[1:02:10] lot of christians on the face of the
[1:02:11] earth yes there is and i'm not here to
[1:02:13] judge them not my job i don't even want
[1:02:15] to sign up for that job imagine going
[1:02:17] through the paperwork of trying to judge
[1:02:19] all the people whether they're christian
[1:02:20] or not you'd run up the rest of your
[1:02:22] life and only touch a fragment of
[1:02:24] society not our job but i'm telling you
[1:02:26] what happens my brother and sister is
[1:02:29] you come into that place and the
[1:02:31] spiritual life which is the very life of
[1:02:33] jesus christ starts to change you and
[1:02:36] you become such an oddball
[1:02:39] amen
[1:02:40] you become such an oddball you become as
[1:02:43] it were the fanatic you become that
[1:02:45] strange one aren't we all christians
[1:02:47] look my brother and sister go right down
[1:02:50] there at bail pior and they were all
[1:02:52] there aren't we all one
[1:02:56] and this is the scary part some said
[1:02:58] yeah
[1:03:00] yeah we are just all one
[1:03:03] well i'll tell you how the prophet of
[1:03:04] god says if we're looking for unity
[1:03:06] let's find unity in the word
[1:03:10] not in how beautiful we sing or how big
[1:03:12] our churches are or what kind of
[1:03:14] programs we have
[1:03:16] let's find unity in the word
[1:03:20] there's the real unity
[1:03:23] because otherwise i'll just put it real
[1:03:25] simple
[1:03:27] otherwise some will say well
[1:03:29] if you have drums in your church
[1:03:32] brother trevor and i've had this
[1:03:33] conversation a lot of times nothing
[1:03:34] wrong with the drums
[1:03:38] nothing wrong with it at all
[1:03:40] others say if you have them
[1:03:42] there's something wrong with you
[1:03:44] others say
[1:03:48] we use them as it were as a a part of
[1:03:52] the worship
[1:03:55] well good
[1:03:56] reminds me i'll just make this
[1:03:58] announcement right now ask my dear wife
[1:04:00] to make a note that i don't forget
[1:04:01] i have all of you
[1:04:04] that is musically inclined in this
[1:04:06] church
[1:04:08] i have a book i'd like you to read
[1:04:12] because it shows
[1:04:14] how
[1:04:15] the spirit in music
[1:04:17] will bring the presence of god isn't
[1:04:19] that beautiful david
[1:04:21] playing there for saul
[1:04:23] brought peace to it
[1:04:25] comfort to it
[1:04:28] but music
[1:04:30] please forgive me i uh
[1:04:32] i get in trouble over these things and i
[1:04:34] don't want to be in trouble
[1:04:36] but i'll tell you what
[1:04:38] there's songs out there
[1:04:40] i just happened to be in a store the
[1:04:41] other day and one was playing and i
[1:04:42] absolutely will not mention that song
[1:04:45] but you know it was talking about give
[1:04:47] me a certain music and set my spirit
[1:04:49] free
[1:04:51] no i'm sorry that is not freedom my
[1:04:53] brother and sister the spirit associated
[1:04:55] with that is a bondage and yet it's
[1:04:58] shocking how many people are still
[1:05:03] in the message
[1:05:06] under that influence
[1:05:09] oh trust me i've heard jesus loves me
[1:05:12] sing to rock and roll
[1:05:14] i've heard amazing grace saying to rock
[1:05:17] and roll
[1:05:20] old rugged cross
[1:05:22] to rock and roll
[1:05:25] that's a lying devil
[1:05:27] that's a lying devil
[1:05:29] let me just throw this out when i do
[1:05:31] this sometimes as the scripture talks
[1:05:33] about a wolf
[1:05:34] in sheep's clothing
[1:05:37] do you realize my brother and sister the
[1:05:38] way the scripture lays out they come in
[1:05:40] to tear up the flock
[1:05:43] if they're coming in to tear up the
[1:05:44] flock you see a wolf coming you're going
[1:05:46] to guard against that wolf but what if
[1:05:48] the wolf's already in the flock
[1:05:51] what if the wolf sat there for years
[1:05:56] nobody notices
[1:05:59] that the fangs have been sunk into this
[1:06:01] one and into this one and into that one
[1:06:05] they don't recognize it
[1:06:07] until their child turns 18 and splits
[1:06:09] and they say when did this happen where
[1:06:11] did this happen it was the wolf
[1:06:14] the wolf had already taken his bite
[1:06:16] caused the blood poisoning
[1:06:18] oh this is a whole different subject but
[1:06:20] god help us the whole different subject
[1:06:22] my brother and sister but the poisoning
[1:06:25] of the blood is in the scripture because
[1:06:28] it makes the redemption and the
[1:06:30] crucifixion of jesus christ the
[1:06:32] scripture says to none effect
[1:06:36] what did it do it poisoned the blood
[1:06:38] the blood's no longer valid the blood's
[1:06:40] no longer sufficient the blood's no
[1:06:41] longer good we doubt that there is even
[1:06:43] a god what did they do they poisoned the
[1:06:45] blood
[1:06:47] how can that happen
[1:06:49] because it wasn't the true blood
[1:06:52] it was the blood of church it was a
[1:06:54] blood of organization it was the blood
[1:06:56] of religious spirits
[1:06:58] now let me get going here
[1:07:06] promise me that none of you left
[1:07:07] something in the frying pan
[1:07:11] now in the church age book
[1:07:14] this is uh
[1:07:16] as you see there the way it is in the
[1:07:17] book the consummation of the gentile
[1:07:19] ages now look at this this age is the
[1:07:21] last of the seven church ages what began
[1:07:24] in the first or ephesian age must and
[1:07:27] will come to full fruition and harvest
[1:07:29] in the last laodicean age
[1:07:31] amen this is revelation one two three so
[1:07:36] must come to fulfill fruition and
[1:07:37] harvest in the last or later the scene
[1:07:39] age the two vines will yield their final
[1:07:42] fruit the two spirits will terminate
[1:07:45] their manifestation in each of their
[1:07:47] final destinations
[1:07:49] you know people struggle with this you
[1:07:51] know they're like well you know they
[1:07:53] want to make
[1:07:54] hell eternal
[1:07:57] if hell's eternal then they got eternal
[1:07:59] life
[1:08:00] and there's only one place there's
[1:08:01] eternal life and that's in jesus christ
[1:08:05] oh well let's argue the verbiage
[1:08:08] no
[1:08:09] let's look for the life
[1:08:11] we can argue all the verbage we want but
[1:08:13] that won't change anything there is two
[1:08:16] separate destinations
[1:08:18] the sowing the watering and the growing
[1:08:20] is all over
[1:08:22] summer is ended don we're going to take
[1:08:24] this literal saints we still got to
[1:08:27] we got a little while
[1:08:30] the sickle is now thrust into the
[1:08:33] harvest
[1:08:34] in verses 15 to 18 which you've studied
[1:08:36] lies the true picture of the ripened
[1:08:38] false vine full spirit false church
[1:08:40] people i know that works now this is
[1:08:43] just the bible saints let's just keep it
[1:08:45] right real simple here i know thy works
[1:08:47] that thou art neither cold nor hot i
[1:08:50] would thou worked cold or hot so then
[1:08:52] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:08:55] cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my
[1:08:58] mouth and that is shocking to me and has
[1:09:00] been my whole life from just a child to
[1:09:03] realize god would rather want me cold
[1:09:09] how can that be
[1:09:13] because at least at cold you've stated a
[1:09:15] clear position
[1:09:18] and hot
[1:09:20] stated a clear position
[1:09:23] but lukewarm
[1:09:26] lukewarm
[1:09:28] oh my goodness nobody knows what you are
[1:09:32] nobody knows where you're going or where
[1:09:34] you stand or what kind of fruit you will
[1:09:37] produce
[1:09:38] they don't have a clue
[1:09:40] sing in the choir and live like a devil
[1:09:44] come on the average if you follow me the
[1:09:46] average is lukewarm
[1:09:48] but god said i want you cold or i want
[1:09:51] you hot
[1:09:53] oh i think i'll just choose hot
[1:09:55] heart is way simpler i don't have to
[1:09:57] struggle with where i stand and who i am
[1:10:00] and why i was placed on this earth i'll
[1:10:02] just make the position when god called
[1:10:05] me he called me hot
[1:10:07] hallelujah
[1:10:09] hallelujah
[1:10:10] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:10:12] cold nor hot i'll spew thee out of my
[1:10:14] mouth
[1:10:15] now
[1:10:15] because thou saith i am rich now see
[1:10:18] there's a continuation of the spirit of
[1:10:19] the age
[1:10:21] do you know we're building millionaires
[1:10:24] around the world at a record pace
[1:10:32] but it's not just rich financially
[1:10:35] the scripture here
[1:10:37] is taking them in a position
[1:10:40] where they will tell you
[1:10:42] i've had the holy ghost for this many
[1:10:44] years
[1:10:46] and god has blessed me
[1:10:48] for this many years in this fashion
[1:10:54] how dare you question my spirituality
[1:10:57] how dare you preach that i could be lost
[1:11:01] how dare you assume
[1:11:05] what is it
[1:11:07] they're rich
[1:11:09] in their tradition
[1:11:12] unless you all get too comfortable and
[1:11:14] happy with me today i don't want you all
[1:11:16] leave happy
[1:11:19] we've got quite a few traditions our own
[1:11:21] selves
[1:11:24] and get more
[1:11:26] all the time
[1:11:30] wow
[1:11:36] are we doing okay
[1:11:39] okay
[1:11:40] now look at this
[1:11:42] i'm rich and i'm increased with goods
[1:11:45] bigger church than we've ever had
[1:11:47] you know i like how brother branham said
[1:11:49] he said you know maybe when it comes
[1:11:50] down to the point that the mayor starts
[1:11:52] to attend your church you better look
[1:11:53] real close
[1:11:55] when you become popular in your
[1:11:57] community
[1:11:59] you better look real close
[1:12:01] you know i'm sorry just bad sense of
[1:12:03] humor but you know i maybe i shouldn't
[1:12:06] have thrown that church building seminar
[1:12:08] thing away you know because they
[1:12:09] guaranteed it if after 18 months your
[1:12:11] church hadn't doubled in size
[1:12:16] and it was only three easy payments of
[1:12:18] 6.95
[1:12:21] is that what church is about
[1:12:27] it's about coming to the banqueting
[1:12:28] table amen
[1:12:31] and everything that's there
[1:12:33] is for your benefit
[1:12:35] everything there is for strengthening
[1:12:38] you everything there is to draw you
[1:12:40] closer to christ
[1:12:42] no free for all
[1:12:45] you know what that term means don't you
[1:12:47] no frills
[1:12:50] well we let brother so-and-so sing
[1:12:53] because he has a perfect voice
[1:12:56] well that would work good if he has
[1:12:58] perfect voice and the holy ghost
[1:13:00] but just having a perfect voice is not
[1:13:02] going to qualify him or it shouldn't
[1:13:04] anyway
[1:13:06] see now our wretched miserable poor
[1:13:09] blind naked
[1:13:10] this is why i won't even quote the
[1:13:13] numbers i don't remember it but this is
[1:13:14] why a huge percentage of confessed
[1:13:17] christians in america
[1:13:19] are also drunks
[1:13:22] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[1:13:23] in the fire that thou mayest be rich
[1:13:26] white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:13:28] clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:13:30] nakedness do not appear
[1:13:33] this is a whole another topic saints i
[1:13:35] was preaching it to sister jerry the
[1:13:36] other day talking about these things how
[1:13:39] it comes down my brother and sister you
[1:13:41] look at that and go all the way back to
[1:13:43] the garden and you'll see how that is
[1:13:45] planned but you look at that and it come
[1:13:47] down and satan says i have carried that
[1:13:49] all the way down and it's there
[1:13:51] constantly exposing us exposing this but
[1:13:53] then one day you i mean me come
[1:13:55] underneath the blood of jesus christ and
[1:13:58] while satan was still viewing us from
[1:14:00] the point of view they're naked they're
[1:14:02] naked they're naked the blood of jesus
[1:14:04] christ come down and closed you and i
[1:14:06] and we are there realizing i still have
[1:14:09] sins in my life saints there's times
[1:14:11] oh i tell you i don't even want to go
[1:14:13] there but there's times i just have to
[1:14:15] resist the urge to just slap people
[1:14:17] silly
[1:14:19] and if there wasn't gravity i'd slap him
[1:14:21] right off the face of the earth and it's
[1:14:22] an urge i have to fight
[1:14:27] jerry's like i don't think you should
[1:14:28] say that paul
[1:14:30] okay well i just want to choke him for a
[1:14:32] minute or two then
[1:14:35] and i'm not proud of that
[1:14:38] but you see
[1:14:39] i'm under that blood you're under that
[1:14:41] blood
[1:14:42] and satan still sees you naked
[1:14:46] are you with me
[1:14:47] satan sees you naked god sees you
[1:14:50] clothed in the blood
[1:14:52] and satan's looking it from one
[1:14:53] perspective god's looking it from
[1:14:55] another perspective and it's all about
[1:14:56] whose perspective we believe if we
[1:14:59] believe the devil then we're naked if we
[1:15:01] believe god we're clothed under the
[1:15:03] blood of jesus christ
[1:15:06] that's why the devil is going to recount
[1:15:07] a lot of things and say you did this and
[1:15:09] you did that but boy i'll tell you what
[1:15:11] my brother and sister he'll come up face
[1:15:13] the lord one day and the lord will say i
[1:15:14] don't know what you're talking about
[1:15:16] i say the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:15:18] appear and anoint thy eyes will i sound
[1:15:20] that thou mayest see no words ever
[1:15:23] spelled out a more bitter
[1:15:25] denunciation and no uh and no proud and
[1:15:28] arrogant religious people ever deserved
[1:15:30] it more
[1:15:31] see look what's happening here
[1:15:33] they're naked
[1:15:35] they have no covering
[1:15:37] of the blood
[1:15:38] they make confession
[1:15:40] but the blood washes away sin
[1:15:44] it doesn't oh see this is where some
[1:15:46] people have a misconception
[1:15:49] oh all my sins
[1:15:51] are covered by the blood
[1:15:56] intellectual
[1:15:58] i can do it
[1:16:00] and it's just covered
[1:16:02] but the blood of jesus christ washes
[1:16:04] away desire washes away all of the
[1:16:07] things that go with that
[1:16:09] so that there is no more sin
[1:16:13] no more conscious of sin
[1:16:15] see so they receive a bitter
[1:16:17] denunciation and
[1:16:19] no
[1:16:20] proud and arrogant religious people ever
[1:16:22] deserved it more but here comes a very
[1:16:24] quick beautiful all of that big long
[1:16:26] drawn out but look how beautiful this is
[1:16:28] yet
[1:16:29] yet is kind of like butt
[1:16:32] right you get to a certain point
[1:16:34] and then it's like this seems to be the
[1:16:36] end of it all
[1:16:38] yet
[1:16:39] there's a little more
[1:16:41] yeah
[1:16:42] yeah
[1:16:44] to him
[1:16:46] that's
[1:16:50] to him that overcometh
[1:16:53] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:16:57] oh saints this was a reinforcement to me
[1:16:59] you talk about being exalted to him that
[1:17:02] overcometh i can't overcome you can't
[1:17:05] overcome but christ in us is the
[1:17:07] overcomer and he said i'm going to pour
[1:17:09] myself into you that you will be an
[1:17:11] overcomer so that i can exalt you and
[1:17:15] put you up here in my throne
[1:17:17] oh you talk about i i don't know this
[1:17:20] might not come out right talk about
[1:17:22] self-serving god says i need some people
[1:17:24] i'm going to have some people not i need
[1:17:27] i'm going to have some people that are
[1:17:29] going to sit with me in my throne and
[1:17:31] i'm going to set the stage that they are
[1:17:33] overcomers so i can put them in the
[1:17:36] throne even as i also overcome and then
[1:17:38] sit down with my father and his throne
[1:17:40] we find the true vine true spirit true
[1:17:44] church people exalted
[1:17:47] to the very throne of god
[1:17:50] with the highest compliment ever paid to
[1:17:52] a humble steadfast spiritual group
[1:17:56] oh i tell you what my brother and sister
[1:17:58] i hope you don't miss it tonight today
[1:18:00] amen look what god's done god has come
[1:18:03] down and he has placed you in a position
[1:18:06] and then complimented you for being in
[1:18:08] that position he's made the way before
[1:18:11] you and then complimented you for
[1:18:12] walking in it and then he has placed you
[1:18:15] in heavenly places and then complimented
[1:18:17] you for overcoming
[1:18:20] oh i love serving a god like that amen
[1:18:24] not a proud arrogant church not not a
[1:18:26] proud we are so good we're so spiritual
[1:18:29] i am a failure without him
[1:18:32] that's right oh hallelujah
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:38] so
[1:18:39] look what we're gonna do we're gonna
[1:18:40] choose between being denounced
[1:18:43] or complemented
[1:18:45] but look how the devil spins this
[1:18:48] the devil
[1:18:50] is the greatest flatterer
[1:18:52] on the face of the earth
[1:18:54] remember he
[1:18:56] told eve
[1:18:59] right
[1:19:00] now remember this
[1:19:01] because it's important
[1:19:03] it's important how you approach god
[1:19:06] with eve
[1:19:08] he removed lord
[1:19:11] supreme authority
[1:19:13] removed lord
[1:19:15] out of
[1:19:20] surely
[1:19:22] thou shall not die
[1:19:26] bam
[1:19:28] he falls
[1:19:30] everything goes into chaos
[1:19:32] study it in genesis
[1:19:34] it's a beautiful beautiful deal because
[1:19:36] you see an impersonal god is a god who
[1:19:38] won't judge us
[1:19:41] take it right back to scripture you'll
[1:19:42] find it an impersonal god won't judge
[1:19:44] you a personal god will
[1:19:48] and the minute they fall
[1:19:51] look in scripture comes right back the
[1:19:53] lord god amen what was happening this is
[1:19:56] what i thought i was preaching this
[1:19:57] morning i'll give you a brief glimpse of
[1:19:58] this what's happening my brother and
[1:20:00] sister is satan trying to bring the
[1:20:03] people which includes us into a position
[1:20:06] that the record and we'll touch on this
[1:20:08] a little bit but just a different
[1:20:09] fashion the record that god is keeping
[1:20:12] amen god is his word
[1:20:16] god keeps records
[1:20:18] so here it is satan keeping records and
[1:20:21] satan intended to come before god one
[1:20:24] day and present his record and for god
[1:20:27] to be able to say i can't deny this i
[1:20:29] can't deny this what was he doing he was
[1:20:31] meeting out judgment but the scripture
[1:20:33] says whatever you meet out will be meted
[1:20:35] to you and well that goes in another
[1:20:38] avenue that we won't go today because
[1:20:40] the devil will receive the judgment he
[1:20:41] was trying to meet out on the bride of
[1:20:43] christ he will receive the judgment he
[1:20:45] was trying to force out on humanity and
[1:20:47] so he's keeping this record and so it's
[1:20:50] there that he's doing but god comes
[1:20:52] along through these words and says you
[1:20:54] know what i've got a compliment for
[1:20:56] those who have revelation of the word
[1:20:58] i've got a compliment for them something
[1:21:00] to encourage them something to encourage
[1:21:03] them a compliment to to get them to move
[1:21:06] on and to be able to
[1:21:07] keep pressing into the battle and so as
[1:21:10] they're there they realize you know what
[1:21:11] this might sound strange to you
[1:21:15] i've already got my spot picked out
[1:21:16] before the throne
[1:21:20] might sound weird i'm not trying to
[1:21:21] preach a doctrine don't get nervous back
[1:21:24] there
[1:21:27] and the reason i say that
[1:21:29] is because i believe god's given me
[1:21:31] vision so strongly i'm going to be there
[1:21:34] i'm i'm going to be there
[1:21:36] not like the people who said i got into
[1:21:38] the super bowl for only 150 dollars
[1:21:41] wow
[1:21:43] the sad thing was is my binoculars were
[1:21:45] not strong enough to see the playing
[1:21:47] field
[1:21:51] no
[1:21:51] i'm going to be there
[1:21:53] that's right
[1:21:54] not somewhere in the universe i'm going
[1:21:56] to be there
[1:21:58] why it's it's in my heart it's in my
[1:22:00] soul it's it what it's what guides me
[1:22:02] and leads me because i am going to be
[1:22:05] one of those that is the overcomer and
[1:22:07] i've been given a promise of the word to
[1:22:09] sit down with him in his throne now if
[1:22:11] i'm at the back of the colosseum my
[1:22:13] brother and sister i'm not actually
[1:22:14] sitting down with him
[1:22:16] now you say how does that come about i
[1:22:18] don't know and i don't care
[1:22:19] i just believe the word
[1:22:21] i get to sit down with him in heavenly
[1:22:23] places
[1:22:25] oh
[1:22:26] are we doing okay
[1:22:27] okay
[1:22:30] now as we look at this
[1:22:32] i want to just be a reminder to you look
[1:22:36] at what is written
[1:22:38] get off of your mind what i thought what
[1:22:41] i was taught what i my emotions says get
[1:22:44] off of all this stuff well growing up in
[1:22:47] the church we were taught differently
[1:22:49] well how about we forget what we were
[1:22:51] taught and look to
[1:22:54] what's written
[1:22:56] let that be our guide because if we're
[1:22:57] looking to an interpretation my brother
[1:22:59] and sister this gets scary
[1:23:01] this gets scary
[1:23:07] ephesians first chapter
[1:23:10] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:23:12] lord jesus christ
[1:23:15] who hath
[1:23:17] passed tense
[1:23:20] did somebody hear me
[1:23:23] amen
[1:23:24] so look don't be thinking you're going
[1:23:26] to look for this
[1:23:28] it's already here you just need to say
[1:23:30] lord i receive it
[1:23:32] i receive this
[1:23:35] he hath blessed us okay who's blessed
[1:23:39] amen every hand ought to go up in this
[1:23:41] building with all carnal blessings
[1:23:44] no sir you might be poverty-stricken
[1:23:47] your whole life and be a son and
[1:23:50] daughter of god and rejoice
[1:23:53] on the streets of glory on the hills of
[1:23:55] glory
[1:23:56] amen
[1:23:57] all spiritual blessings now did you
[1:23:59] notice what the scripture says all was
[1:24:02] really except for the seals
[1:24:10] come on saints
[1:24:12] now you might think i'm being brash and
[1:24:13] bold about this
[1:24:15] and i'm not
[1:24:16] it makes a difference
[1:24:19] it makes a difference
[1:24:22] when one comes in
[1:24:23] and starts to say all of the word of god
[1:24:26] is for you
[1:24:27] except for
[1:24:30] that's a wolf
[1:24:34] because you realize
[1:24:36] if the seventh seal is not open
[1:24:39] then you don't know christ
[1:24:42] ouch i heard somebody's pain
[1:24:47] why because the prophet of god clearly
[1:24:49] shows us
[1:24:50] that is christ
[1:24:52] so if he's hidden from us
[1:24:55] then what are we looking at that's right
[1:24:58] what do we see
[1:24:59] amen that's right
[1:25:02] he has chosen us in him
[1:25:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:07] that we should be holding without blame
[1:25:09] before him in love i'm i'm liking this
[1:25:12] having predestinated us in other words
[1:25:15] foreknown us into the adoption of
[1:25:17] children by jesus christ to the whole
[1:25:20] family of god
[1:25:23] see here's a real technicality
[1:25:27] he
[1:25:29] would adopt you into the family of god
[1:25:32] who can deny that
[1:25:33] i'm part of the family of god
[1:25:36] but you see if we don't take the next
[1:25:38] step
[1:25:40] oh welcome to our church we're we're
[1:25:42] christians we're serving god together
[1:25:45] we believe the message
[1:25:49] you stop too short too quick
[1:25:52] this adoption is not adopted
[1:25:56] to the church
[1:25:57] this is not adopted
[1:25:59] to the message
[1:26:01] this is not adopted to
[1:26:04] this is adopted
[1:26:06] to jesus christ
[1:26:08] to himself
[1:26:11] hallelujah
[1:26:13] well i'll tell you what my brother and
[1:26:14] sister you say brother paul i don't
[1:26:16] what's the emphasis on that
[1:26:18] i'm telling you there's a lot of
[1:26:19] adoptions taking place
[1:26:21] but not all of them are to christ
[1:26:25] hello
[1:26:27] hello
[1:26:28] according good pleasure of his will to
[1:26:30] the praise
[1:26:32] oh can i say once again
[1:26:34] it is written
[1:26:36] this is not opinion
[1:26:38] this is not surmising this it is written
[1:26:43] hallelujah
[1:26:44] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:26:47] wherein he hath made us acceptable
[1:26:51] accepted i mean in the beloved
[1:26:54] you know the word accepted is
[1:26:57] oh
[1:26:58] you english people
[1:27:00] no not by ancestry i mean those of you
[1:27:02] speak english
[1:27:05] i don't remember what you call that but
[1:27:08] in the context of that phrase right
[1:27:10] there
[1:27:11] i can't give you words to explain in the
[1:27:13] context of that phrase the word accepted
[1:27:16] is completely and absolutely past tense
[1:27:22] it's not you will be
[1:27:24] you are
[1:27:26] and if i have already been received in
[1:27:29] adoption and already been accepted in
[1:27:32] the beloved i can stand right now having
[1:27:35] been put through trials anybody have any
[1:27:37] fiery trials amen been put through the
[1:27:41] trial and oh i tell you my brother and
[1:27:44] sister the morning i woke up and
[1:27:46] realized that god had handed me a
[1:27:48] checkbook and that my name on that
[1:27:50] checkbook was just as good as his name
[1:27:52] on that checkbook and he said you ask
[1:27:54] anything in my name and i will cast this
[1:27:57] check and so it's in that position we
[1:28:00] can come not with power but i have the
[1:28:02] authority of my father
[1:28:04] i'm the authority of the one whose name
[1:28:06] is on the heading of the check and all
[1:28:09] i've got to do is sign off of it ask
[1:28:11] anything come on my brother and sister
[1:28:13] god knows you're not going to ask for
[1:28:15] cash he knows you're not going to ask
[1:28:17] for ego and this and that and fine
[1:28:19] clothes and trips to the mediterranean
[1:28:22] or maybe even just a house there no he
[1:28:24] knows you're not going to he knows that
[1:28:27] you signed that check and it's for my
[1:28:29] child and it is for my wife and it is
[1:28:32] for my husband and it is for my brother
[1:28:35] it is for my sister it is for everyone
[1:28:38] in the body of believers that's who i
[1:28:40] want to write a check for i don't have a
[1:28:42] selfish spirit i don't have a selfish
[1:28:44] desire lord i want to write a check for
[1:28:47] your body for your family for the needs
[1:28:49] of this church
[1:28:52] hallelujah
[1:28:54] oh because i'm already can someone say
[1:28:57] that i'm already accepted
[1:29:00] hallelujah
[1:29:02] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:29:04] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[1:29:06] to the riches
[1:29:07] of his grace wherein he hath abounded
[1:29:09] towards us in all wisdom
[1:29:11] and prudence
[1:29:13] now look at this i want to go along i
[1:29:14] wasn't going to read all this scripture
[1:29:15] but i think
[1:29:17] i think we shouldn't
[1:29:19] having
[1:29:21] made known to us unto us the mystery of
[1:29:24] his will
[1:29:27] isn't that why there's like
[1:29:29] thousands of denominations now
[1:29:32] because everyone's got a different
[1:29:33] interpretation
[1:29:35] of the mystery
[1:29:37] of god's will
[1:29:39] well i tell you what if we do a whole
[1:29:40] lot more praying lord what did you mean
[1:29:43] and a whole lot less of this is what he
[1:29:46] meant
[1:29:48] we'd have a lot more answers a lot more
[1:29:50] unity
[1:29:52] you know pardon me for doing this have a
[1:29:54] little insider knowledge but
[1:29:56] my brother and sister god never ever
[1:29:58] ever said in his word we're going to
[1:30:00] have unity by getting together and
[1:30:02] singing a bunch of songs
[1:30:06] but he did say
[1:30:07] amen right here
[1:30:10] is where you will find liberty and unity
[1:30:13] this is where you'll find what you need
[1:30:16] and it's not get there saints
[1:30:19] i will sound selfish here do you mind if
[1:30:21] i sound selfish for a moment
[1:30:23] when it comes down to the ultimate depth
[1:30:25] of a personal relationship
[1:30:27] i'm not as concerned about your position
[1:30:31] as i am about my own
[1:30:34] amen
[1:30:35] because you see i can't put you in a
[1:30:36] rapture
[1:30:38] we could pray every day we could cry we
[1:30:40] could weep we could shout we can sing
[1:30:43] and i can't make you
[1:30:45] and you can't make me that's right but i
[1:30:48] tell you what i can sure have a whole
[1:30:50] lot more
[1:30:51] not picking on you get real
[1:30:53] but i can have a whole lot more
[1:30:55] influence on this young lady's life
[1:30:57] if i've got the holy ghost
[1:31:01] not i've got an opinion
[1:31:03] i've got influence
[1:31:05] no if i've got the holy ghost
[1:31:07] i'll have way more influence
[1:31:10] oh god help us
[1:31:12] a little less in
[1:31:14] opinion a little more of the holy ghost
[1:31:16] what a change that will be
[1:31:18] amen
[1:31:20] somebody help me here
[1:31:23] fullness of times gathered together
[1:31:25] in one all things in christ that's unity
[1:31:28] both which are in heaven which are on
[1:31:29] earth even in him in whom also we have
[1:31:31] obtained an inheritance i like that idea
[1:31:39] being predestinated according to the
[1:31:40] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:31:43] after counsel of his own will we're back
[1:31:44] to god's will understanding that will
[1:31:47] knowing what it is and letting the holy
[1:31:49] ghost lead us instead of
[1:31:52] now an example of that my brother and
[1:31:53] sister
[1:31:55] most of us without the influence of god
[1:31:57] in our life would think that money would
[1:31:59] cure our problems
[1:32:01] just think with me right just in the
[1:32:03] carnal realm the carnal realm it's like
[1:32:05] seriously
[1:32:07] it's hard for us see now here's the
[1:32:08] thing
[1:32:09] it's hard for us to separate that
[1:32:11] thought because that's not where we
[1:32:12] dwell
[1:32:14] but just kind of take one good look at
[1:32:15] your carnal self and if you woke up
[1:32:18] tomorrow and somebody called you up and
[1:32:20] said
[1:32:21] oh no you're not going to buy a lottery
[1:32:22] ticket because you're a christian but
[1:32:24] i don't know publishing clearinghouse or
[1:32:26] this that or something you know how they
[1:32:28] always have these things and
[1:32:29] and we're going to give you um
[1:32:31] you know
[1:32:33] i forget i just heard a little deal the
[1:32:35] other day
[1:32:36] payment not to exceed
[1:32:39] eight hundred ninety five dollars a week
[1:32:43] i don't even make that a month
[1:32:46] yeah
[1:32:47] that would help fix some of my problems
[1:32:52] except for it won't
[1:32:56] because that's not what god ordained for
[1:32:58] you
[1:32:59] he said my word
[1:33:01] is what will change you
[1:33:04] it's my word that is the healing
[1:33:07] for the wilderness
[1:33:09] it is my word that would change your
[1:33:12] life
[1:33:13] but most of us
[1:33:15] well
[1:33:17] bill gates years ago some journalist
[1:33:19] said bill gates is so rich
[1:33:22] he could not afford
[1:33:25] walking down the sidewalk if there was a
[1:33:27] hundred dollar bill laying on the ground
[1:33:31] bill gates could not afford to take the
[1:33:34] time to bend over
[1:33:36] and grab that hundred dollar bill
[1:33:39] somebody else that read that article who
[1:33:41] had
[1:33:42] some way into this
[1:33:45] gets a hold to bill gates and says
[1:33:47] mr gates if you were walking down the
[1:33:48] sidewalk you saw a 100 bill laying there
[1:33:51] and it's probably not worth your while
[1:33:53] to pick it up but and he said what do
[1:33:55] you mean
[1:33:56] he said i'm not walking past 100 bill
[1:34:01] but i'm looking for big blessings
[1:34:03] brother i'm looking for speaking in
[1:34:04] tongues i'm looking for this i'm looking
[1:34:06] for all these things don't step over the
[1:34:09] simple things of the gospel in your life
[1:34:12] don't step over it is written in your
[1:34:15] life don't step over the promises for
[1:34:18] the little changes and it is there
[1:34:20] because remember you have to guard
[1:34:22] against the little fox
[1:34:24] don't just look for the wolf we'll guard
[1:34:26] the wolf and we'll leave the in-house
[1:34:27] door open until we see a wove no the
[1:34:29] little fox can come in there too so grab
[1:34:32] a hold of those little promises of the
[1:34:35] word it is written it is written it is
[1:34:38] written oh i'm having a terrible day but
[1:34:41] i tell you what i'm predestinated i've
[1:34:44] been called to god according to adoption
[1:34:47] unto him i don't need to have some great
[1:34:50] revelation i can just take what is
[1:34:52] written
[1:34:54] and now what he wrote he wrote it for
[1:34:56] you and i
[1:34:57] oh i'm so distracted off my thoughts
[1:35:00] forgive me
[1:35:01] amen
[1:35:03] in whom also
[1:35:04] ye also trusted after you heard the word
[1:35:06] of truth the gospel of your salvation
[1:35:08] and whom also after that you believe you
[1:35:11] were
[1:35:13] well i don't know if the seals are off
[1:35:15] limits then i don't know
[1:35:20] come on
[1:35:23] i don't make this as an emphatic
[1:35:24] statement
[1:35:26] but everything up to the sixth seal
[1:35:28] deals you might say
[1:35:30] in a global perspective
[1:35:33] you follow me
[1:35:35] the seventh seal
[1:35:37] dealt with the bride
[1:35:39] specifically
[1:35:42] the seventh seal was to that bride that
[1:35:45] god called that's identified by his word
[1:35:48] but sorry you guys
[1:35:50] stay lined up at the queue
[1:35:52] the door is closed
[1:35:54] until a later date
[1:35:58] no sir
[1:35:59] we just seen some of the most tragic
[1:36:01] things happen
[1:36:03] in just the last few weeks
[1:36:06] charlie and rachel
[1:36:08] their house explodes
[1:36:13] heart-rending
[1:36:15] heart rate a young couple with all their
[1:36:17] life in front of them
[1:36:20] i love how the news is some neighbor
[1:36:22] told a reporter well i don't know what's
[1:36:24] going on there might be suspicious you
[1:36:26] know i heard screaming
[1:36:28] before the house blew up maybe just
[1:36:30] killed her
[1:36:33] yeah
[1:36:34] sorry devil
[1:36:36] sorry devil
[1:36:38] you can smear anything you want but it
[1:36:40] ain't going to stick
[1:36:43] now look at this other family
[1:36:46] driving home from church
[1:36:49] somebody swerves strikes the back of
[1:36:51] another car their car flips through the
[1:36:53] air
[1:36:54] and lands right on their car
[1:36:57] kills the husband
[1:37:01] who hadn't been in church
[1:37:04] in a long time and been serving god
[1:37:08] but because of what happened with
[1:37:10] charlie and rachel
[1:37:12] he comes back gives his heart back to
[1:37:14] god
[1:37:16] oh it's so fortunate
[1:37:19] that he gave his heart back to the lord
[1:37:21] before he died
[1:37:23] no sir that was perfectly in footsteps
[1:37:27] it is written
[1:37:28] it is written

[1:37:33] oh look how our god works saints
[1:37:36] amen he tells you right here that you
[1:37:39] trusted after you heard the word of
[1:37:41] truth and you realized it was a gospel
[1:37:43] of your salvation also after you
[1:37:46] believed you were what
[1:37:48] sealed
[1:37:50] amen not superficial not intellectual
[1:37:53] but sealed down in the depths of a soul
[1:37:55] and what is that seven seal nothing less
[1:37:58] than jesus christ himself coming down to
[1:38:02] you and i and sealing us
[1:38:05] oh not wrapping us in denomination not
[1:38:08] wrapping us in some kind of organization
[1:38:11] wrapping us in him
[1:38:13] oh thank you lord i now have confidence

[1:38:20] oh my i got to move on here
[1:38:22] hey
[1:38:26] now look
[1:38:30] we see what is written
[1:38:32] amen you see this is not a mystery of a
[1:38:34] man
[1:38:35] it's a revelation of jesus christ
[1:38:38] amen now look
[1:38:40] i want you to catch this here if you
[1:38:42] would i'm kind of lost here i've got
[1:38:45] lost in my own thoughts and
[1:38:47] and things here excuse me
[1:38:50] oh my
[1:38:52] help me lord
[1:38:54] what is it you desire lord
[1:38:56] hallelujah
[1:39:11] do we
[1:39:13] oh my
[1:39:17] brothers do we have
[1:39:19] do we have uh
[1:39:21] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:39:24] okay
[1:39:25] i just
[1:39:27] got myself a rod up here excuse me
[1:39:31] now i want you to look at this
[1:39:36] we have had a revelation of the son of
[1:39:38] god but the last promise that abraham
[1:39:41] had before the son was made or brought
[1:39:43] into existence the one that he had been
[1:39:45] promised
[1:39:46] one
[1:39:47] been promised
[1:39:49] yeah
[1:39:50] before the promised son showed up god
[1:39:52] manifested himself there at sodom as a
[1:39:55] prophet being a man in flesh
[1:39:57] god amen
[1:40:00] elohim as i heard someone speak it a
[1:40:02] while ago which was godhead bodily was
[1:40:04] in him he was the fullness elohim is the
[1:40:07] fullness of the godhead bodily and we
[1:40:09] notice there when lot saw now paul's
[1:40:13] when abraham saw him coming he said
[1:40:16] my lord
[1:40:18] one he had a clear identification but
[1:40:20] the my is possessive
[1:40:23] right he looked at and said that's my
[1:40:25] lord
[1:40:26] what about the other guys
[1:40:27] look at that there was three of them and
[1:40:30] down in sodom
[1:40:31] lot saw two and said my lords
[1:40:36] look at this
[1:40:38] lack
[1:40:39] of revelation
[1:40:43] now if lot
[1:40:45] had been in the word
[1:40:48] and
[1:40:49] were able to say it is written
[1:40:53] it had a different perspective
[1:40:56] but you see you can't
[1:40:57] just put someone
[1:41:00] we got modern day theological schools
[1:41:04] i just watched an interview with a young
[1:41:06] man
[1:41:08] it really was not a it was a promotion
[1:41:10] for this
[1:41:12] independent theological school
[1:41:14] now i want you to catch this i hope you
[1:41:16] do catch this so this is an infomercial
[1:41:19] type of a thing
[1:41:20] microphone
[1:41:22] and why did you choose this school to
[1:41:25] come and study to for the ministry
[1:41:28] well sir
[1:41:30] i was getting out of high school i went
[1:41:32] to one year of college
[1:41:33] and i looked around
[1:41:35] and i thought
[1:41:36] i don't know what i want to do because
[1:41:38] this career i like this but the
[1:41:40] employment numbers are going down and i
[1:41:42] want to do this over here but it don't
[1:41:44] pay very much and i looked at that and i
[1:41:47] thought
[1:41:48] well
[1:41:49] if i just become a pastor of a church
[1:41:53] i would have a good career path
[1:41:55] with good compensation
[1:42:02] anyway um we're gonna pass the offering
[1:42:04] plate again before you guys leave today
[1:42:07] because the compensation part ain't
[1:42:09] working too well
[1:42:11] come on this is why we're serving god is
[1:42:14] this why we do what we do
[1:42:16] oh i tell you it's not at all my brother
[1:42:18] and sister there's not a man there's not
[1:42:21] a man sitting here has ever ministered
[1:42:23] the gospel that had a thought about the
[1:42:25] money about the money about the money
[1:42:28] and if he did his ministry would be
[1:42:30] ineffective
[1:42:31] be ineffective god would not bless that
[1:42:34] so what does it do it comes down the
[1:42:36] revelation of my lord is revelation amen
[1:42:40] it's not taught to us oh it can be
[1:42:43] taught we can recite it but you can get
[1:42:45] a parrot
[1:42:46] oh you'll like this little video i've
[1:42:48] seen recently a parrot doing the
[1:42:49] alphabet
[1:42:50] yes that's good
[1:42:52] i don't want the parrot right notebook
[1:42:54] for me
[1:42:55] now the red wire goes to the detonator
[1:42:57] and the blue wire goes to the
[1:43:00] and the parrot's like
[1:43:02] i don't remember
[1:43:03] it was the other way around
[1:43:05] i like blue
[1:43:07] red first
[1:43:08] i'm a truck driver red on right oh
[1:43:12] i don't remember boom
[1:43:14] no come on saints
[1:43:16] god never trusted the word for that
[1:43:18] god anchored
[1:43:20] anchored the word
[1:43:21] and put it there and how did he anchor
[1:43:24] it in revelation
[1:43:26] peter didn't get that and go off to
[1:43:28] school
[1:43:30] hmm i'm getting sidetracked i've been
[1:43:32] sidetracked so long this morning you
[1:43:34] guys wouldn't know where i'm at
[1:43:35] amen but look at this by revelation
[1:43:38] right
[1:43:38] one sees god
[1:43:40] elohim
[1:43:41] another sees two lords
[1:43:44] no wonder people are confused
[1:43:46] yeah
[1:43:47] to those who by revelation see we'll go
[1:43:49] back to our original scripture blessed
[1:43:51] is he that readeth and they that hear
[1:43:53] the words of this prophecy and keep
[1:43:55] those things which are written therein
[1:43:57] for the time is at hand isn't this
[1:43:59] beautiful now look i i am so far over
[1:44:02] and i'm going to do that
[1:44:04] brother dwayne fair thing can i just
[1:44:06] have five minutes
[1:44:07] five ten fifteen twenty thirty that'll
[1:44:10] be enough
[1:44:11] yeah now look at this we're turning
[1:44:13] esther the sixth chapter and i'm gonna
[1:44:15] go through here really fast
[1:44:17] now look at this
[1:44:18] there's a night i'm not going to read
[1:44:19] all the scripture just follow it on a
[1:44:21] night the king can't sleep and so he
[1:44:23] asked them to go get the book of records
[1:44:26] of the chronicles this is all that's
[1:44:27] happening in the kingdom amen and they
[1:44:30] were read before the king and it was
[1:44:32] found what written
[1:44:35] that mordecai told of uh big fenna and
[1:44:39] taresh two of the king's chamberlain's
[1:44:41] the keepers of the doors sought to lay
[1:44:42] hand on the king and so he says you know
[1:44:44] what what did we do for them and that
[1:44:47] they've done you know and he says nope
[1:44:49] we haven't done anything for him nothing
[1:44:51] done at all for him now look at this and
[1:44:53] the king says who's in the court now i
[1:44:55] want to take this over in a spiritual
[1:44:57] realm if you can just step over there
[1:44:58] with me now my brother and sister the
[1:45:01] devil is always outside the door
[1:45:03] you better believe the devil's outside
[1:45:05] the door he never lays down he never
[1:45:08] gets tired of his job he's already there
[1:45:10] but have you ever noticed there's times
[1:45:12] that god uses the devil
[1:45:15] oh there's times that god uses the devil
[1:45:18] he'll let man get so full of himself and
[1:45:20] then so fed up with himself and the
[1:45:22] whole time the devil's just feeding it
[1:45:24] feeding it feeding it until the day that
[1:45:26] god says done and then the devil says
[1:45:28] what malfunction i can't figure out did
[1:45:30] i get the blue wire wrong or the red
[1:45:31] wire wrong what went wrong here but you
[1:45:33] see as it is that this time this coming
[1:45:36] and the king now esther the bride is
[1:45:39] outside of this right now and the king
[1:45:42] himself is just looking back through his
[1:45:45] writings
[1:45:46] the writings the record
[1:45:49] now you've got to remember
[1:45:51] this is the record
[1:45:54] of god
[1:45:58] and haman typed as the devil
[1:46:01] has been keeping his own
[1:46:04] keeping his own
[1:46:06] excuse me
[1:46:07] i don't mean to be rude
[1:46:11] see the difference in the amount of
[1:46:12] notes here
[1:46:13] [Laughter]
[1:46:16] i don't mean to embarrass you but this
[1:46:18] is a beautiful point
[1:46:21] and i don't make no type
[1:46:23] i don't make no type to nothing please
[1:46:25] don't don't misunderstand
[1:46:27] but you see god's got some notes that
[1:46:29] are short and sweet
[1:46:32] and the devil's got extensive notes
[1:46:38] oh man sister gary
[1:46:42] it is a beautiful type though
[1:46:44] both sides keeping notes
[1:46:49] and haman's been into the king saying
[1:46:51] there's a people in the land
[1:46:53] they're trouble
[1:46:55] and i have kept a record
[1:46:57] of everything they've done
[1:47:00] i've got it all down in king i'm going
[1:47:02] to lay this record out before you and
[1:47:04] you're going to sign a decree now look
[1:47:06] saints
[1:47:07] this was so efficient
[1:47:10] that the king
[1:47:11] had the decree written
[1:47:15] signed it
[1:47:16] oh i hope you catch this
[1:47:18] and even
[1:47:20] put a seal upon it
[1:47:24] thou shall not steal thou shall not
[1:47:26] commit adultery thou shalt not covet
[1:47:31] and the king put his seal on it
[1:47:35] now imagine
[1:47:36] coming before the king one day
[1:47:39] the king
[1:47:41] what is the record of my life
[1:47:44] you lied
[1:47:45] you cheated you stole
[1:47:47] you lusted
[1:47:49] you've coveted you've done all of this
[1:47:53] how could we
[1:47:54] what would be our argument
[1:47:57] what would we say i nev
[1:47:59] because our own conscience
[1:48:01] would become
[1:48:03] the video playing
[1:48:05] before life and we'd say i did it
[1:48:08] forgive me lord but i did it
[1:48:12] and the devil would be right there as
[1:48:13] the accuser look what happens
[1:48:16] somewhere in the midst of this
[1:48:19] god
[1:48:20] intervenes
[1:48:22] how can someone say thank you lord
[1:48:26] before we come to that judgment god says
[1:48:29] i'm here to intervene because you see in
[1:48:33] the dark of the night i have got some
[1:48:36] records of my own i've got some
[1:48:38] recordings of my own and i have come and
[1:48:42] i have heard what those recordings are
[1:48:44] and this is my son and this is my
[1:48:47] daughter and i am going to intervene
[1:48:49] before satan can come and put his final
[1:48:53] stroke as it were and so it's there in
[1:48:56] that we see now did we we do something
[1:48:59] for mordecai and they said no nothing's
[1:49:01] done and he said who's in the court and
[1:49:03] the devil was out there
[1:49:06] he come in the outward court of the
[1:49:08] king's house why to speak to the king to
[1:49:11] hang mordecai i'm going to bring
[1:49:13] judgment on this guy right in the early
[1:49:16] hours of the morning
[1:49:19] but what he forgot was to read the
[1:49:20] scripture that said the lord's mercies
[1:49:23] we're new and fresh
[1:49:25] every morning
[1:49:32] he comes in there yes
[1:49:34] what will we do for a man you know haman
[1:49:37] was like i'm the man
[1:49:39] i'm telling you what we're not doing
[1:49:40] this halfway we're not giving him
[1:49:42] chicken wings we're giving him the whole
[1:49:43] chicken
[1:49:44] and so he comes and he says what would
[1:49:46] you do
[1:49:48] and he tells them then
[1:49:49] let's just go on here bounce that to the
[1:49:51] next scriptures there brothers
[1:49:54] and the king said to him what shall be
[1:49:56] done
[1:49:57] and haman thought in his heart to whom
[1:49:59] with the king delight to do honor more
[1:50:01] than myself
[1:50:03] you know after all church i mean being
[1:50:05] the pastor that makes me more spiritual
[1:50:07] than all of you obviously right
[1:50:10] hmm
[1:50:13] [Music]
[1:50:14] no
[1:50:16] not one problem
[1:50:18] god chose man
[1:50:20] puts him in an office
[1:50:22] and then that man's got his own fiery
[1:50:24] trial
[1:50:25] it's just in a different office
[1:50:27] and we won't even put it in office as in
[1:50:30] position
[1:50:31] office as in location
[1:50:33] it won't matter
[1:50:35] africa asia
[1:50:39] europe
[1:50:42] south america north america
[1:50:44] australia
[1:50:46] wherever that man is at
[1:50:48] he's still got his own firing
[1:50:56] oh let's see
[1:50:57] i mean after all
[1:51:00] and he answers the king for a man whom
[1:51:01] the king delighteth on or let the
[1:51:04] see the devil doesn't even know what
[1:51:06] he's saying saints are you with me are
[1:51:07] we on the same page this morning you
[1:51:09] know what i i want to curse this guy i
[1:51:12] want to hang this guy i'm going to do
[1:51:13] away with these people i'm going to
[1:51:15] judge it because every christian now
[1:51:16] remember satan's got some very good
[1:51:18] insight and every christian that ever
[1:51:20] said i'm going to live for the lord i'm
[1:51:21] going to die for the lord i'm going to
[1:51:23] commit myself to it the devil sees this
[1:51:26] he sees this and he sees this
[1:51:31] yeah and on a bad day he has to use
[1:51:33] shorthand to catch it all
[1:51:37] so what i would do
[1:51:43] i'd wrap him in royal apparel that's
[1:51:45] what i would do
[1:51:48] yup yup
[1:51:51] that the king wore
[1:51:53] not someone else's concept this is a
[1:51:55] peril the king has won
[1:51:58] what does the word say about the
[1:52:00] word the word
[1:52:03] is god
[1:52:05] in written form amen
[1:52:08] so when we
[1:52:10] go to put on apparel
[1:52:13] do you know what the devil oh i'm
[1:52:15] getting drawn out saints i'm sorry are
[1:52:17] we okay for a couple more minutes
[1:52:19] you know when the devil comes under
[1:52:20] religious spirit
[1:52:22] he wants to come and he says oh
[1:52:25] wrap yourself
[1:52:26] in the word
[1:52:28] no problem
[1:52:30] you see but he's got denominational mind
[1:52:32] because that's where that spirit come
[1:52:34] from
[1:52:34] they're going to wrap themselves in a
[1:52:36] religious spirit
[1:52:38] no problem
[1:52:40] but what he doesn't know is the bride is
[1:52:42] so literal that when she says wrap
[1:52:44] myself in the word
[1:52:46] she starts oh i hope you don't mind she
[1:52:49] just starts wrapping this
[1:52:51] around her
[1:52:55] and she becomes the
[1:52:56] word amen
[1:52:58] i don't know how it happened saints come
[1:53:00] on the prophet goes in a little room and
[1:53:02] and the people go in the little room and
[1:53:03] they come out and they ask them what
[1:53:05] happened in there i don't know and i
[1:53:07] can't tell you either but when i started
[1:53:09] wrapping myself in this word something
[1:53:12] started changing in my life i became a
[1:53:14] new creature in christ jesus i become a
[1:53:17] different individual do i have bad days
[1:53:19] don't have sister jerry please
[1:53:22] but i'll tell you what's happened the
[1:53:24] devil's trying to wrap you in a
[1:53:26] religious spirit but the apparel amen is
[1:53:29] being wrapped around you and so that
[1:53:32] word is become your very life it's your
[1:53:34] very identity and so then he says you
[1:53:36] know what and the horse that the king
[1:53:38] writeth upon and the crown royal which
[1:53:41] is set upon his head now remember we are
[1:53:44] the bride we're not the king we're the
[1:53:47] bride to the king and so when we're
[1:53:49] looking at this my brother and sister
[1:53:51] everything it's there has a spiritual
[1:53:54] type that is showing a position that god
[1:53:57] called you and i to take and not to just
[1:53:59] take it superficial but to take it as
[1:54:01] though our life depended on it
[1:54:04] and it does
[1:54:09] imagine now
[1:54:10] i'm sorry i hope you don't think i'm
[1:54:12] weird but i actually have a degree of
[1:54:14] humor
[1:54:15] when i read this because i i know some
[1:54:17] haman's they have different names on
[1:54:19] earth here
[1:54:20] but i've known some haman's
[1:54:23] that would one breath
[1:54:25] tell you
[1:54:26] you don't even have one bit of
[1:54:28] understanding of the word of god the
[1:54:30] next breath
[1:54:31] i think i'll bust your knees
[1:54:34] thank you brother haman i mean
[1:54:39] yeah
[1:54:41] if i told you some of you would know and
[1:54:43] that wouldn't be right so
[1:54:45] so what does he do he says deliver this
[1:54:47] and then oh besides that
[1:54:49] i think so much of you haman you lead
[1:54:51] the horse
[1:54:54] come on haman wasn't nearly as important
[1:54:57] in this program as he thought he was
[1:54:59] amen so you look at this now
[1:55:02] look i've got to i've got to move on
[1:55:05] here i'm sorry
[1:55:07] uh
[1:55:08] uh so it's there now i want to interject
[1:55:11] in the middle of that psalm 27
[1:55:13] so if we have that brothers pop that up
[1:55:15] there if you would uh psalms 27
[1:55:18] and
[1:55:19] we'll just kind of move on here psalms
[1:55:21] 27 5 says for in the time of trouble
[1:55:25] he shall hide me
[1:55:27] in my pavilion
[1:55:29] in my
[1:55:30] revelation in the church of my choice
[1:55:35] he said for in the time of trouble he
[1:55:36] shall hide me in
[1:55:38] his
[1:55:40] pavilion
[1:55:41] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:55:44] hide me
[1:55:45] he shall set me upon a rock now look
[1:55:48] don't take this literal don't i just
[1:55:50] trying to make a point to you in the
[1:55:52] time of trouble we face trouble right
[1:55:54] more troubles coming but the secret of
[1:55:56] his tabernacle now a tabernacle is a
[1:55:58] dwelling place amen so it's there that
[1:56:01] he's going to hide me in myself
[1:56:06] are you with me i'm not trying to change
[1:56:08] doctrine i'm not trying to twist nothing
[1:56:10] i want you to catch this he's going to
[1:56:12] hide me in myself
[1:56:15] why we are the house the tabernacle
[1:56:18] right he shall hide me and he shall set
[1:56:21] me on a rock of revelation in myself now
[1:56:26] it is not revelation i have of myself
[1:56:29] but the revelation that he's setting in
[1:56:31] my life he didn't come and pass out a
[1:56:34] pamphlet this is revelation day so you
[1:56:36] get it before i get it they get it and
[1:56:39] that and so so it is there that god is
[1:56:41] moving in his time and his position
[1:56:44] giving revelation to you and i and if
[1:56:46] you notice it's often times in the time
[1:56:48] of trouble that we dig deeper than we
[1:56:51] ever dug before and we submit ourselves
[1:56:54] to the will of god deeper than we've
[1:56:56] ever submitted before and god uses
[1:56:59] trouble god has harnessed
[1:57:01] trouble to bring us into his presence
[1:57:05] and it's there in that time of trouble
[1:57:07] because we're not quitters
[1:57:09] if there's any quitters here this
[1:57:10] morning you're dismissed
[1:57:12] because i'm going to make a bold
[1:57:13] declaration
[1:57:15] no quitter ever received the baptism of
[1:57:17] the holy ghost
[1:57:19] no quitter ever was filled from the brim
[1:57:22] to the brim of almighty god no quitter
[1:57:26] can stand because the fiery trial is too
[1:57:28] much for the quitter but to sit here
[1:57:31] today and receive the word of god and
[1:57:33] face every trial and be able to say in
[1:57:36] the time of trouble not he shall hide me
[1:57:38] he has hid me
[1:57:41] i am hid in him
[1:57:43] oh hallelujah i'm sorry i'm so excited
[1:57:46] this morning amen and he said i'll
[1:57:49] lift my head above my enemies around
[1:57:51] about me therefore oh i love this last
[1:57:54] closing therefore will i offer in his
[1:57:56] tabernacle
[1:57:59] come on saints right here in his
[1:58:01] tabernacle i shall offer praises unto
[1:58:05] the lord amen
[1:58:08] oh we aren't writing a note to a priest
[1:58:11] we aren't writing a note to some great
[1:58:13] authority it's your lips your heart your
[1:58:17] spirit crying out to the lord and then
[1:58:20] you will sing and you will make
[1:58:22] sacrifices of joy
[1:58:24] well brother paul if you knew our
[1:58:26] situation i don't know what your
[1:58:27] situation is but i'm telling you my
[1:58:30] brother and sister god didn't put a
[1:58:32] caveat on here unless there's marriage
[1:58:34] problems unless there's problems in the
[1:58:36] family unless there's money problems
[1:58:39] unless there's problems in the church
[1:58:40] then you don't have to do this he said
[1:58:42] if you have been in the time of trouble
[1:58:45] i'll hide you
[1:58:47] i'll hide you saints it's written
[1:58:50] this is not paul this morning this is a
[1:58:52] word of god it's written
[1:58:55] oh hallelujah
[1:58:58] i'm telling you what i want to dwell in
[1:59:00] the house of the lord forever
[1:59:02] amen hallelujah
[1:59:09] yeah i already touched on this
[1:59:12] way out order that's fine
[1:59:14] because that's when satan desires to
[1:59:16] defeat you
[1:59:18] he uses
[1:59:19] not the words
[1:59:21] of his book
[1:59:25] he uses the words of this book
[1:59:29] you'll not find a quotation recorded
[1:59:33] thus saith lucifer
[1:59:37] he condemns us
[1:59:40] with this book
[1:59:43] and he tries to judge us
[1:59:45] with this book
[1:59:48] but
[1:59:50] i turn
[1:59:51] to another page
[1:59:54] and it says it was written of you and i
[1:59:56] it is that we were in him amen before
[2:00:01] come on can we get far enough back
[2:00:02] before
[2:00:04] the foundation of the world
[2:00:07] oh before there was any ability in us to
[2:00:10] sin
[2:00:11] or be influenced by unbelief we were in
[2:00:14] him
[2:00:16] and i can't find a single word where he
[2:00:18] said
[2:00:19] i'm done with you
[2:00:22] but i do find a word where it is written
[2:00:24] he said they can't pluck you
[2:00:28] out of my hands
[2:00:30] how can someone say thank you lord this
[2:00:32] morning
[2:00:33] sister emmy would you just come i've got
[2:00:35] to stop here
[2:00:36] hallelujah but the king my king your
[2:00:39] king amen he's got his own record book
[2:00:41] and i'm so glad of that amen hallelujah
[2:00:45] look at this
[2:00:46] let's look at this my brother and sister
[2:00:49] first peter
[2:00:51] once again
[2:00:54] let me back up just a hair further
[2:00:56] see
[2:00:58] my son little redundant forgive me
[2:01:00] lord has his own
[2:01:02] record book
[2:01:03] he's got his own record
[2:01:07] haman had a record
[2:01:09] but the king didn't say go get haman's
[2:01:11] book
[2:01:13] he said bring me the book of the record
[2:01:16] of my kingdom
[2:01:20] thank you lord hallelujah
[2:01:23] not going to take someone else's
[2:01:25] word for it
[2:01:27] but let's
[2:01:28] church can we just rejoice for a moment
[2:01:30] do we have enough time i've been long
[2:01:32] can we rejoice for just a moment
[2:01:34] we look today
[2:01:36] by how
[2:01:38] i don't have a page in the bible that
[2:01:40] says paul haley
[2:01:42] i redeemed you
[2:01:47] but i have
[2:01:48] page after page
[2:01:51] that says
[2:01:52] i'm redeemed
[2:01:55] what is this
[2:01:57] revelation
[2:01:59] and it's written in the book
[2:02:01] but we have to get in the right spirit
[2:02:03] and the right attitude in the right
[2:02:04] atmosphere
[2:02:06] and then the words leap off the page and
[2:02:08] we realize he was talking about me
[2:02:11] the whole time
[2:02:13] the whole time talking about me
[2:02:16] oh praise god saints it's written in the
[2:02:18] book but it's revelation
[2:02:20] and then it got sealed in there with the
[2:02:22] blood of jesus christ
[2:02:24] sealed in there can be taken out
[2:02:26] oh my look at this now first peter
[2:02:30] come on who identifies with first peter
[2:02:34] yep yep
[2:02:38] yep
[2:02:39] confession time
[2:02:42] [Music]
[2:02:44] god's still working on me
[2:02:47] god is still working on me
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:52] and i look at this scripture and all i
[2:02:54] can say is thank you lord
[2:02:56] why
[2:02:58] he kept me he kept me
[2:03:01] to those who are kept by the power of
[2:03:03] god
[2:03:04] how did god do this
[2:03:07] through faith
[2:03:08] [Music]
[2:03:09] and then what did the prophet of god say
[2:03:11] about faith
[2:03:13] faith is revelation
[2:03:15] but you see faith my brother and sister
[2:03:19] it's not something
[2:03:20] this is where we get messed up people
[2:03:22] think i got saved gave my heart to the
[2:03:24] lord i've got faith
[2:03:25] yes you do
[2:03:27] but your faith is buried
[2:03:29] underneath anxiety
[2:03:32] underneath fear
[2:03:34] underneath all kinds of other things
[2:03:38] and so god knows how to do this
[2:03:40] just the other day watching
[2:03:42] a great big excavator
[2:03:46] now to me that's a beautiful thing
[2:03:48] saints
[2:03:49] an excavator
[2:03:53] yeah somebody look at me like he's got a
[2:03:55] problem
[2:03:56] but i tell you what if you've ever
[2:03:58] watched someone that's a professional
[2:03:59] excavator
[2:04:01] it's nice and smooth
[2:04:04] [Music]
[2:04:10] i know this is boring
[2:04:12] [Music]
[2:04:14] it's beautiful
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:17] and i'll show you the difference here's
[2:04:18] paul
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:28] and you say why are you making such a
[2:04:29] silly example
[2:04:32] because the overburden in our life
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:36] the holy ghost comes down
[2:04:38] and when we need faith
[2:04:41] he doesn't just accidentally rip your
[2:04:42] heart out
[2:04:44] he doesn't maim you
[2:04:46] he gracefully
[2:04:48] uncovers faith
[2:04:50] in our life
[2:04:52] and we suddenly look in our life and
[2:04:54] there is faith for the challenge of our
[2:04:56] day
[2:04:57] there's faith for the circumstance we're
[2:05:00] facing
[2:05:02] when man
[2:05:03] tries to uncover faith in you
[2:05:06] run
[2:05:09] run
[2:05:10] because man can't do it
[2:05:13] but the holy ghost gracefully
[2:05:15] where you submit
[2:05:17] to the operation
[2:05:18] of the holy spirit
[2:05:20] god does that
[2:05:22] can someone say thank you
[2:05:24] who are kept by the power of god through
[2:05:27] faith
[2:05:28] unto salvation
[2:05:30] oh i'd love to put a space in here you
[2:05:32] know i'm i'm real fun if you look at my
[2:05:34] notes i don't use punctuation colon
[2:05:36] semicolons commas
[2:05:39] i just put
[2:05:41] saves time you don't have to move your
[2:05:43] finger to all these other things
[2:05:45] i love dots
[2:05:48] amen god threw faith into salvation
[2:05:51] [Music]
[2:05:54] ready
[2:05:56] to be revealed
[2:05:58] in
[2:05:59] the last
[2:06:00] time i have faith
[2:06:03] you have faith it's right here and god's
[2:06:06] revealing it god's revealing it god's
[2:06:09] revealing it oh come on some of you are
[2:06:12] frowning at me now i know i went over
[2:06:13] the time

[2:06:18] chris will buy you lunch
[2:06:20] [Music]
[2:06:21] but look my brother and sister god's
[2:06:23] promised
[2:06:24] he's going to reveal this faith in this
[2:06:27] last time and somebody ought to stand up
[2:06:30] and say lord i'm claiming that i'm
[2:06:32] claiming that lord every bit of faith i
[2:06:35] need i'm claiming it today i'm claiming

[2:06:42] week and you sat down and the devil
