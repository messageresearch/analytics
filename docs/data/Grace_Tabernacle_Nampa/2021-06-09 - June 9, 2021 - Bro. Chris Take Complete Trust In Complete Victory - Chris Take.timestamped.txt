[23:03] looking forward to
[23:05] hearing from you
[23:12] [Music]
[23:16] as always it's good to be in the house
[23:18] of god
[23:19] amen always expecting to hear from him
[23:24] since you're already standing if you
[23:25] want to turn in your bibles to
[23:26] revelations chapter 15
[23:29] amen it's good to be back we enjoyed our
[23:33] trip
[23:33] down and enjoyed hearing what god did
[23:36] for the youth
[23:38] at camp and me and my wife had a little
[23:42] break
[23:43] over the weekend just really appreciated
[23:46] that
[23:49] but um brakes are good and they're
[23:52] needed but
[23:53] i'm ready to get back into saddle so
[23:56] revelation chapter 15
[23:59] amen verse two
[24:05] everybody we saw sends their greetings
[24:07] back
[24:09] just plain blanket statement there
[24:12] and i saw as it were a sea of glass
[24:15] mingled with fire
[24:16] and then that had gotten the victory
[24:18] over the beast and over his image and
[24:20] over his mark and over the number of his
[24:22] name
[24:23] stand on the sea of glass having the
[24:26] harps of god
[24:27] and they sing the song of moses the
[24:30] servant of god
[24:31] and the song of the lamb saying great
[24:33] and marvelous
[24:34] are thy works lord god almighty
[24:38] just and true are thy ways thou king of
[24:40] saints
[24:42] zechariah chapter 2
[24:51] from one end of your bible to the other
[24:59] beautiful
[25:01] these books separated by hundreds of
[25:03] years if not more
[25:06] it doesn't matter which way you go take
[25:08] a scripture here in the scripture there
[25:10] and it all
[25:10] perfectly lines up a testament that
[25:15] god truly wrote this with
[25:19] amen zechariah 2 verse 8
[25:25] for thus saith the lord of hosts
[25:30] after the glory hath he sent me unto the
[25:33] nations which spoiled you
[25:36] for he that toucheth you toucheth the
[25:38] apple of his eye
[25:40] of christ's eye for behold i will shake
[25:43] mine hand
[25:44] upon them and they shall be a spoiled to
[25:46] their servants
[25:47] and ye shall know that the lord of hosts
[25:50] hath sent me
[25:52] see and rejoice o daughter of zion
[25:55] for lo i come and i will dwell in the
[25:57] midst of thee
[25:59] saith the lord amen lord blessing to the
[26:02] reading of his word you may be seated
[26:03] tonight
[26:05] amen you are the apple of his eye
[26:10] daughter of zion and he promises to
[26:12] dwell
[26:13] in the midst of thee amen looks like we
[26:16] lost our
[26:19] powerpoint maybe but oh there we go my
[26:22] title tonight is complete
[26:26] trust is complete victory
[26:29] unless uh so a lot of words my subtitle
[26:32] is true interpretation of your christ
[26:34] relationship now tonight lord
[26:37] the lord would will we want to talk
[26:40] about
[26:41] finding victory
[26:44] from interpreting your relationship with
[26:46] your heavenly father
[26:48] through hurts from people who claimed to
[26:50] represent him so finding the true
[26:53] interpretation of
[26:54] what your relationship with christ how
[26:56] christ views you
[26:58] and how he wants you to see him a true
[27:00] revelation of that
[27:02] not not basing this upon false false
[27:06] representation of christ
[27:09] amen we don't want to know christ
[27:11] through man's interpretation of
[27:13] him we want to follow christ by
[27:16] revelation of who christ
[27:18] is in you amen so complete trust is
[27:22] complete
[27:22] victory when you can trust in god fully
[27:26] when you can give
[27:26] everything you have to god god
[27:30] will give you the victory and
[27:33] this isn't necessarily tonight about the
[27:36] interpretation
[27:37] of the word though it is it's a
[27:40] different
[27:41] angle i guess and so i pray that god
[27:43] give me the words and
[27:45] and just speak through me tonight so i
[27:47] don't fall into the
[27:49] the uh habits of phrases that we use
[27:51] because i really want to bring this
[27:54] from a different angle and that is that
[27:56] we we serve god we love god god's given
[27:59] up
[27:59] given us the holy ghost we have a
[28:01] revelation of the word
[28:03] but on this earth we were on a journey
[28:06] and a journey to become more and more in
[28:09] the image of christ
[28:11] and along the way we pick up hurts and
[28:14] we pick up pains and we pick up
[28:16] complexes
[28:17] because we live in the flesh man who is
[28:19] fallen
[28:21] and if we're not careful we can start to
[28:24] base on
[28:24] on past things and and say well um i
[28:27] don't do this anymore i have been
[28:29] delivered from this
[28:30] and i don't have these problems anymore
[28:32] i'm good and we give our we turn a blind
[28:35] eye to the things deeper within us and i
[28:38] believe that as we come down
[28:40] uh closer to the statue of the perfect
[28:43] man
[28:44] we're not breaking off big chunks we're
[28:46] breaking off small pieces we're we're
[28:48] putting in the detail of the crease in
[28:50] the shirt and
[28:51] we're putting in the finer details of
[28:53] the eye and and
[28:54] the the creases and the knuckles of the
[28:57] hand we're getting down to the fine
[28:59] details because
[29:00] gods are going to come for a bride with
[29:02] the blemish he's coming for a perfect
[29:05] representation of himself and so
[29:08] god is starting to get down to the
[29:10] nitty-gritty goddess i need to
[29:12] move down deeper into our hearts and say
[29:15] look i'm not worried about this stuff
[29:16] that
[29:17] that um this over here stop looking at
[29:19] the big things and start asking yourself
[29:21] on a daily am i doing everything that i
[29:25] can
[29:25] to please my savior am i doing
[29:27] everything that i can to
[29:29] fall in line with his word and what i
[29:32] want to focus by god's grace
[29:34] tonight is that sometimes we can look at
[29:38] christ we can look we can view a certain
[29:41] um a certain area of his word or a
[29:44] a um a doctrine if you will or just
[29:47] or just a a um a description of christ
[29:51] we can view that through a
[29:54] false representation of christ sometimes
[29:58] we can say oh
[29:59] you know um and one of the big ones is
[30:02] is that that this is kind of where this
[30:04] came from sitting in
[30:06] in church the other day it started off
[30:08] with the title
[30:09] i've got a problem calm the father
[30:13] and the the lord is through my heart and
[30:14] said if instead of i've got a problem
[30:17] father god comes down and he can and he
[30:21] he works in your life and so you can
[30:23] trust him and then you don't
[30:24] you don't serve him or you don't look at
[30:26] him through your relationship with your
[30:28] earthly father
[30:29] if that was one of pain and and hurts
[30:32] through life
[30:33] instead a comma is put there when god
[30:35] delivers you from that and you can come
[30:36] to christ
[30:37] fully trusting him and say i've got a
[30:39] problem
[30:40] father and so that kind of just
[30:43] converted down to this complete trust is
[30:45] complete victory
[30:46] and so that's a big one that that it
[30:50] kind of comes
[30:51] came came out in the study of this is
[30:53] that that's what you see a lot people
[30:55] have a hard time trusting god
[30:57] as their father if they had a hard time
[31:00] trusting their earthly father
[31:02] and what god wants tonight is he wants
[31:04] you to find
[31:05] complete trust in him and the only way
[31:09] you can do that is you have to take the
[31:11] description of christ
[31:13] directly from the truth of christ which
[31:17] is the message of the hour which is the
[31:18] word and this goes
[31:19] into all sections right this is the
[31:22] reason we needed the seventh
[31:23] the seventh messenger this is we the
[31:25] reason we needed all these things down
[31:27] through time that were lost and
[31:28] dispersed and
[31:29] and mixed into time and and the loose
[31:31] sins that had to be tied up because we
[31:33] needed a true representation of christ
[31:36] so if you step back and you take a broad
[31:38] view of the message
[31:39] and and and and the word um
[31:42] you say well i have a true understanding
[31:45] i have a true revelation
[31:46] of that and that's why i want to get
[31:49] into
[31:49] it even deeper you have i believe that
[31:54] even when you have that there's little
[31:56] things in your life
[31:57] that you keep you keep um you keep down
[32:01] you don't pay attention you don't listen
[32:03] to
[32:03] because you
[32:07] you're not realizing that you're viewing
[32:10] christ
[32:11] with the wrong idea you're viewing what
[32:13] god is trying to tell you
[32:15] through a relationship you have with a
[32:17] with a with a pastor or a preacher or a
[32:20] friend
[32:20] or or something that an event that
[32:24] happened in your life a big one that it
[32:26] we're kind of experiencing around the
[32:27] message right now
[32:28] is emotions and people can say well i
[32:32] got the holy ghost because i cried
[32:34] i got the holy ghost because i was
[32:36] emotional at the altar
[32:37] and then their life doesn't line up with
[32:39] that and they begin to question
[32:40] god that's a misrepresentation
[32:44] of god's truth about receiving the holy
[32:47] ghost
[32:47] and so they they can go through life
[32:49] even sometimes thinking well i got the
[32:51] holy ghost because
[32:52] i expressed emotions at the altar or i
[32:55] spoke in tongues because
[32:56] someone told them or someone maybe
[32:58] didn't directly tell them
[32:59] but someone portrayed christ to them
[33:01] that that's what it was
[33:03] all about and and they go years down the
[33:06] road and suddenly realize
[33:08] they never even had it and all the
[33:11] doubts and the questions and the
[33:12] struggles they had god says look
[33:14] that's not what it is that was a false
[33:16] representation here is the truth of it
[33:18] i was actually talking to a brother down
[33:21] there and i s
[33:22] god has done an incredible work in his
[33:24] life and has brought restoration to his
[33:26] family
[33:27] he said i sat in this church for 17
[33:29] years
[33:30] before realizing the truth and receiving
[33:32] the holy ghost
[33:34] it happened but god is gracious and god
[33:36] is true
[33:37] so
[33:41] what are what are what is um
[33:44] praise the lord
[33:47] so it's about relationship with christ
[33:51] which if you think about it is the whole
[33:52] point and it's com
[33:54] and this is completely about the word of
[33:56] god
[33:58] my wife sometimes she come to me and
[34:00] she'll say i don't understand you know
[34:02] why do i feel this way or
[34:03] or you know what's going on and and i
[34:06] laugh and i joke and i say sometimes
[34:07] i know you better than you know you and
[34:10] i said that and i told them i said well
[34:12] that's the same with christ god knows us
[34:15] better than we know ourselves
[34:17] and we we we we stress and we figure
[34:19] what's wrong with us what's going on
[34:21] what's my problem
[34:22] and god is is ready and he brings along
[34:25] an answer
[34:26] and shows you and brings through that
[34:29] that complete trust he brings the
[34:31] victory over that
[34:34] amen it can be a big it can be a complex
[34:37] in your life that
[34:40] come along through who knows what the
[34:43] devil
[34:44] got in there and so you look at god and
[34:48] you
[34:48] view this that you view
[34:51] you might view christ through that
[34:54] complex
[34:55] and god tries to move on you could be a
[34:58] it could be a complex of
[35:00] coming to the altar and you you won't do
[35:03] it
[35:04] and you can't do it and and and and
[35:06] everything else in your life
[35:07] is lining up and god's working on you
[35:08] and and and and but this little area
[35:11] you you um help me lord
[35:15] you you you try to understand
[35:19] what it you you kind of look past it but
[35:21] god comes along
[35:23] and he shows you the truth
[35:26] the truth of of his word and he and he
[35:29] and he
[35:30] deals with your heart and suddenly you
[35:31] realize oh i'm lacking
[35:33] victory because i'm not trusting in this
[35:36] in this in this portion
[35:37] amen praise the lord i hope the lord can
[35:39] straighten that out that was amen praise
[35:41] the lord the problem is when believers
[35:42] have a knowledge of the message
[35:44] doctrine but a wall within their heart
[35:48] prevents christ from becoming real to
[35:50] them
[35:51] and this can be as a whole someone
[35:53] without the holy ghost has a mental
[35:55] knowledge
[35:56] of the message and and you know the song
[35:59] take it from my head down
[36:00] to my heart and there can be a wall
[36:02] there and they not even realize it
[36:04] the same thing you can have a revelation
[36:07] of the message
[36:08] as a whole but there's certain things
[36:09] that are just in your head
[36:11] and they haven't moved to your heart
[36:13] because you have a wall up because you
[36:15] have a
[36:16] you're you're you're looking at it
[36:18] through the wrong interpretation
[36:19] through the wrong relationship you're
[36:21] looking at it through an earthly
[36:23] relationship or an earthly understanding
[36:25] and god's trying to tell you don't take
[36:29] an earthly representation don't take a
[36:31] physical or natural representation take
[36:33] the spiritual
[36:34] take the truth of god's word take the
[36:37] truth
[36:37] and believe it here instead of believing
[36:40] it from them
[36:41] over there so praise the lord
[36:49] amen we're going to go to ruth chapter
[36:52] 3.
[36:54] you can follow along
[36:57] if you would like to
[37:02] judges then ruth
[37:07] so rude chapter three gonna pick up here
[37:10] in the middle of the story
[37:12] then verse one then naomi her
[37:15] mother-in-law said unto her my daughter
[37:16] shall i not seek rest for thee
[37:19] that it may be well with thee and now is
[37:21] not boaz of our kindred
[37:23] with whose maidens thou wast behold he
[37:26] went with barley tonight in the
[37:28] threshing floor
[37:30] wash thyself therefore and anoint thee
[37:32] and put thy raiment upon thee
[37:34] and get thee down to the floor but make
[37:36] not thyself known
[37:38] unto the man until he shall have done
[37:40] eating and drinking
[37:41] and it shall be when he lieth down that
[37:43] thou shalt mark the place where he shall
[37:45] lie
[37:46] and thou shalt go in and uncover his
[37:48] feet and lay thee down and he will tell
[37:50] thee what thou
[37:51] shalt do and she said unto her
[37:54] all that thou sayest unto me i will do
[37:58] but the men says in the message the
[37:59] waters of separation 1955
[38:02] she had picked up the handfuls and she
[38:04] thrashed them out
[38:06] happy taking them back and that night
[38:08] she went down to
[38:09] to when he was winnowing wheat that
[38:11] night at the garner look
[38:13] ruth here uh um a
[38:17] example of the bride of christ is is is
[38:20] getting food
[38:22] from christ he's getting she's getting
[38:25] food she's
[38:26] she's she's taking it in she's she's
[38:28] getting ner she's being nurtured by
[38:30] christ
[38:32] but she still doesn't know him
[38:36] she still doesn't know him and she's
[38:38] going along
[38:39] happily in that
[38:43] not realizing there's greater things if
[38:46] she would go
[38:47] in and find a marriage with boaz
[38:51] but the word naomi
[38:54] the jew just like paul took the message
[38:56] to the gentiles
[38:57] she brings the truth to ruth and says
[39:00] look
[39:01] he's a kinsman um
[39:04] do you want me to look for your rest for
[39:06] you you need to go find your rest
[39:08] your your what what's wrong see ruth
[39:11] sometimes god has to give you a
[39:13] revelation
[39:14] not only of his word but a revelation of
[39:16] what you need
[39:18] from his word we have in the in
[39:21] the industry that i work in software
[39:23] engineer um
[39:24] our programming there's some there's a
[39:27] saying
[39:28] thank you for showing me what i didn't
[39:29] know i needed to know
[39:31] because it's very common you don't even
[39:34] understand what's going on
[39:35] you can't even in your wildest
[39:37] imagination figure it out until someone
[39:38] says oh
[39:39] that's because you need to know this to
[39:41] figure this
[39:42] and so so excuse me you need to know
[39:46] what you need the right information so
[39:47] you can ask the right question that's
[39:49] what i'm trying to say
[39:50] so god sometimes god has to give you a
[39:52] revelation sometimes of what you need
[39:54] isn't god good my goodness the grace of
[39:57] god you don't even know
[39:58] ruth didn't even know she needed to meet
[40:00] boaz she was getting plenty of food the
[40:02] bread was baking like crazy
[40:04] and she was getting extra portions
[40:08] so naomi says look ruth what you need is
[40:10] you need to go
[40:11] meet boaz that it may be well with thee
[40:15] listen he's winnowing barley tonight in
[40:17] the threshing floor
[40:18] here's what you need to do so now the
[40:21] word just like paul brought the word
[40:23] to the gentile the word comes and tells
[40:25] ruth what she needs to do
[40:27] to step into further blessings to step
[40:30] into a further relationship
[40:32] with christ amen that's why it comes to
[40:36] a choice
[40:36] will you go further or will you deny it
[40:39] and when you deny it that's when you
[40:41] step out of that so um he goes on to say
[40:44] he says
[40:45] um at the barn boaz laid down and when
[40:49] he laid down
[40:50] ruth notice this not ashamed to dispose
[40:52] herself to this man
[40:54] so ruth had to receive a revelation of
[40:57] what she needed
[40:59] then she had to trust
[41:02] what the word said about boaz
[41:06] she couldn't say well boaz might be like
[41:08] my other husband
[41:10] who let me down who gave me no no
[41:13] no who gave me no child in other words
[41:15] there was no
[41:16] life in that relationship so she said
[41:18] well what if it's gonna be like that
[41:20] again
[41:21] so um she had to to find and
[41:25] trust the word to fully surrender to
[41:28] completely trust so she could find
[41:30] complete victory so she steps she goes
[41:33] to to boaz he says um
[41:35] and not ashamed to dispose herself to
[41:38] this man
[41:39] as the real true born again church
[41:41] tonight is not ashamed to dispose
[41:43] herself to the holy ghost call of god
[41:46] when right down into the barn with this
[41:48] man
[41:51] giving him trust every man that comes to
[41:54] christ
[41:54] must forsake everything on both sides
[41:57] and put his full faith in the lord jesus
[41:59] christ
[42:00] no matter what your mother says what
[42:02] your daddy says
[42:03] what this says or mama says or what
[42:05] anybody says
[42:06] true trust christ i like how he ends
[42:10] this he says don't be afraid
[42:13] you have to fear is the devil's
[42:16] favorite weapon he loves fear
[42:20] because fear paralyzes you
[42:24] fear you know you you see somebody you
[42:25] know they they're all brave right
[42:27] there's
[42:27] there's all kinds of stories of people
[42:29] falling off cliffs are almost falling
[42:30] off us because
[42:31] they're all you know cocky and they
[42:33] stand look at this down the very edge
[42:34] and all of a sudden it hits them and
[42:36] fear takes over
[42:36] and they just can't turn around and walk
[42:38] away and so they either fall
[42:40] they almost fall it happens right fear
[42:44] paralyzes you in the natural and the
[42:45] spiritual fear can
[42:47] keep you from fulfilling fulfilling
[42:50] god's desire for your life
[42:52] you stay you stay maybe you're being
[42:55] called
[42:56] to something and uh i remember um
[42:59] when i was when i was when i was 15 i
[43:02] first felt the call to preach
[43:04] and i thought that's totally absurd i'm
[43:05] never ever going to be a preacher
[43:07] and um i was told you know
[43:10] just just get into the word of god and
[43:12] if it's god's desire it'll just
[43:14] come out even more and i was
[43:18] i think i was 18 and brother lindsey
[43:19] mcgrady was preaching
[43:21] and um i didn't i didn't want to preach
[43:23] and i was feeling feeling called to
[43:24] preach because i was afraid to preach
[43:26] and i was sitting in the second row or
[43:29] front row back on the left side and as
[43:30] he's preaching along he points and he
[43:32] says don't be afraid
[43:33] do what god has called you to do and god
[43:35] delivered me from the fear
[43:37] he gave me the calling he gave me the
[43:39] position to play the ability to fulfill
[43:41] his desire for my life
[43:42] but i was too afraid to step forward see
[43:45] it calms down
[43:46] god's going to do everything he can to
[43:49] give you what you need to fulfill
[43:51] the revelation he has of you in him
[43:56] but you have to take the first step
[43:57] forward
[43:59] that's what this free moral agency the
[44:01] funny thing of it is is you will
[44:03] if you're predestinated that's a whole
[44:06] other sermon
[44:07] but um so you have to step past fear so
[44:09] ruth had to step past the fear of
[44:12] the what ifs oh we can just go on and on
[44:15] about what ifs
[44:16] we can go on and on about what about
[44:18] this and or what will they think
[44:20] that's the worst thing guess what nobody
[44:22] really cares
[44:24] in that aspect we all care for one
[44:26] another but in that aspect no one's
[44:27] gonna think less of you
[44:29] they're gonna be if they're a true son
[44:32] or daughter of god
[44:33] they're gonna be excited for you
[44:36] and so um sometimes you have to take the
[44:39] step
[44:40] of faith and i and any any person who's
[44:42] been serving god for any amount of time
[44:45] any amount of time god can do a lot in
[44:47] one week
[44:49] one day you know that you have you when
[44:52] you trust god and you take a step of
[44:54] faith
[44:54] into the unknown knowing he knows the
[44:57] unknown
[44:57] you find complete victory because you're
[44:59] completely trusting in him
[45:01] that's how abraham had to take the
[45:03] revelation that i needed
[45:05] he needed to leave and walk away
[45:08] onto the desert and just where are you
[45:10] going abraham not really sure
[45:12] but god said to to follow him
[45:15] he had to have faith in order to do that
[45:17] he had to have complete trust
[45:23] so ruth could not interpret the man boaz
[45:26] through any other previous relationship
[45:28] you can't interpret your relationship
[45:29] with christ through a previous
[45:31] relationship
[45:32] with another religion or or or even in
[45:35] the natural with a
[45:36] with a a man or a previous pastor or
[45:39] preacher there are many people
[45:41] who can't get past the hurts of previous
[45:44] pastors or preachers
[45:46] who have done things said things been a
[45:48] certain way
[45:50] because they view christ through that's
[45:52] like someone who grows up
[45:54] being preached and get being preached at
[45:57] through like a
[45:58] kind of an angry twist on the word of
[46:01] god they go through that thinking god's
[46:02] mad at them
[46:05] and and so because of that false
[46:08] representation of christ they view god
[46:10] as
[46:10] is standing there with a switch ready to
[46:12] get them
[46:14] and so they serve god differently they
[46:16] serve god out of fear
[46:17] instead of out of love amen praise the
[46:20] lord and that's why i read that script
[46:21] scripture at the beginning zechariah 2
[46:24] you're the apple of his eye and daughter
[46:26] of zion he will come
[46:28] dwell in the midst of thee i really that
[46:30] god's been really dealing with my heart
[46:31] i've already said this
[46:32] up here uh before that he's trying to
[46:36] tell the bride look
[46:37] trying to tell us myself included i love
[46:40] you
[46:40] yeah i really really love you
[46:44] don't be afraid to come to me when you
[46:47] when you
[46:47] you you've slipped up or or when you
[46:50] just you just don't understand
[46:51] why you feel what the way you feel you
[46:53] don't understand this relate this
[46:54] situation
[46:55] he says just he's saying just come to me
[46:57] i love you we're his
[46:59] bride we're his wife do you does a good
[47:01] true husband
[47:02] ever want to just beat his wife no
[47:05] no when she comes to him oh my all he
[47:07] wants to do is just hug her
[47:09] pull her in close and and and give her
[47:12] even more love and that's what we're
[47:14] coming to because
[47:16] because the bride needs to get into that
[47:20] relationship with christ to receive amen
[47:24] the seed of christ so she had to take
[47:26] the truth of boaz
[47:28] that she learned from the word
[47:34] if ruth looked entirely at the truth of
[47:37] boaz from the message of her day
[47:39] it said boaz will take care of you boaz
[47:42] will love you
[47:44] boaz will heal you boaz will deliver you
[47:50] that's what the truth said about boaz
[47:52] but
[47:53] she had to have faith in that truth
[47:58] it's there for us it's there for us to
[48:00] read it's there for us to
[48:02] to to hear but you have to
[48:05] accept that it really is the truth
[48:09] and sometimes we accept parts of it
[48:12] and not the whole and then we wonder why
[48:14] our victory is not complete
[48:17] we have partial victory we have
[48:20] but because we are not trusting christ
[48:23] completely
[48:24] so that he can come and give us complete
[48:27] and total victory
[48:29] so um you struggle we can struggle to
[48:33] get past
[48:34] the hurts of life when you struggle to
[48:37] trust
[48:38] christ you say why can't i find
[48:41] victory over here and it's because over
[48:44] here
[48:45] you won't fully trust him over over here
[48:49] you won't fully give yourself to them
[48:50] and this goes right back to
[48:52] surrendering everything to christ and it
[48:54] goes right back to you know
[48:55] total separation from from everything
[48:58] that's that is
[48:59] uh from all unbelief everything that is
[49:00] not of christ
[49:02] and that that can go right on down from
[49:05] from from the lust of the flesh and and
[49:08] and drinking all the way down to
[49:10] complexes in your life
[49:13] brother battle talks about an
[49:14] inferiority complex
[49:16] and that can go right on down to that
[49:18] you feel like you're less
[49:21] so when you read the word and you read
[49:22] about the promises that god has for the
[49:24] bride you say oh yes for the bride but
[49:26] not for me
[49:28] so you live below your privilege
[49:31] and when you live below your privilege
[49:33] you live
[49:34] below your victory because
[49:39] living below your privilege doesn't just
[49:40] mean you won't accept god's blessings
[49:43] it means you won't accept god's
[49:44] deliverance
[49:46] and when you where god is is there and
[49:49] he's like
[49:51] he's trying to get to your heart that's
[49:54] what i was trying to say a few minutes
[49:55] ago god
[49:56] is trying to get to your heart are you
[49:59] going to let someone
[50:00] into your heart who's yelling at you
[50:03] who's angry with you
[50:04] who's telling you constantly what you're
[50:06] doing wrong
[50:07] no you're gonna put a wall up you're
[50:09] gonna you're gonna put up
[50:11] a fortification and then you're going to
[50:13] you're going to you're going to say what
[50:14] you think
[50:15] will please them to keep them happy
[50:20] lip service you're going to serve them
[50:22] you're going to serve god with an
[50:25] intellectual understanding sometimes we
[50:28] we look at people who have an
[50:29] intellectual understanding of christ and
[50:31] think what's wrong with them why won't
[50:32] they just
[50:33] you know if they would just let god work
[50:36] on them
[50:37] and let god deal with them you know they
[50:38] would go down to their heart if they
[50:40] just understand that you know it's all
[50:41] about the heart not about the head
[50:43] if they would just realize it's in their
[50:44] head when what when what we should be
[50:46] saying is god
[50:47] lead me to pray what's keeping them
[50:50] right
[50:51] from letting it into their heart because
[50:53] they want to
[50:56] you want to but there's something that's
[50:59] stopping you
[51:00] some and that's the flesh right because
[51:02] that's the badger skin
[51:04] and we talk about the badger skin and we
[51:05] say oh you know a temper that can fight
[51:07] a buzzsaw but sometimes the bad your
[51:09] skin is there because of
[51:10] past uh hurts or past or complexes in
[51:14] your life
[51:15] where you're serving god but you just
[51:18] you don't want to
[51:20] lay at the feet of boaz because it's
[51:23] kind of awkward
[51:25] it's kind of awkward right she's going
[51:28] in the room full of men
[51:30] to lay down to feed a boat she's
[51:32] probably thinking what if someone
[51:33] catches me what are you doing in here
[51:36] or what if this or what if that
[51:39] but that's where she found her victory
[51:41] and then
[51:42] and then she had to trust that she could
[51:45] make it to the feet of boaz but then she
[51:46] had to trust that boaz would respond
[51:49] to her need the way she was told he
[51:53] would
[51:55] you have to trust that when you come to
[51:57] god with a need someone can tell you oh
[51:59] look anytime man you need anything just
[52:00] just call me up we'll talk
[52:03] and the first time you call them they
[52:04] all they can do is tell you what you're
[52:05] doing wrong and chew you out are you
[52:06] ever going to call them back again
[52:09] no so she had to say you know
[52:12] she's probably thinking about her her
[52:14] husband i forget his name
[52:20] she had to she had to look past that
[52:27] and say what what she had to believe
[52:31] like
[52:31] she had to believe what the word said
[52:32] about bobas i'm sorry if i'm repeating
[52:34] myself
[52:37] amen if you understand amen amen
[52:41] so stop looking at your relationship
[52:43] with christ
[52:45] through your earthly relationships
[52:48] he always loved you he
[52:51] always will
[52:59] god is not angry with you you are his
[53:02] pride and joy you're the apple of his
[53:06] eye sometimes
[53:09] we can get to serving god through
[53:12] superstition
[53:15] and we think well
[53:21] i'm feeling i'm feeling led to do this
[53:23] does that mean something bad is going to
[53:24] happen
[53:26] or i i want to pray for
[53:29] for um you know i want to pray for
[53:34] patience but i'm afraid if i do
[53:38] you know then i'm going to go through
[53:40] well i want to pray that i'll trust
[53:42] the lord more but but what if i go
[53:43] through this really really bad trial and
[53:45] things are really really bad
[53:48] god's always teaching you and bringing
[53:51] us through things but don't
[53:52] serve god as if he's a
[53:56] reactionary god he's not
[54:00] you you you uh there was a sister i
[54:04] was i could remember her testimony she
[54:05] grew up and her understanding of god was
[54:08] if she ran a red light she might die
[54:11] because she
[54:12] she broke the law and god's just gonna
[54:15] just smite her down
[54:19] but that's not that's not the god i
[54:21] serve
[54:22] that's not the god the bible the bible
[54:24] talks about
[54:25] look i had to pray lord i don't know why
[54:27] you want me to preach this
[54:28] because you think as a preacher you get
[54:30] up and you think you think about
[54:32] everybody in the congregation
[54:33] sometimes if you have a tendency to get
[54:35] in the flesh and think okay who could
[54:36] this be for
[54:39] but i have no idea i can think i know
[54:42] you but i
[54:44] god christ knows you
[54:49] and and i and you have to just you just
[54:51] have to fully surrender and and just say
[54:53] what
[54:54] what god lays upon your heart and the
[54:57] the big thing that
[54:58] that comes to me from this from this
[55:01] thought is
[55:02] is is when you have a father who didn't
[55:05] do things right
[55:07] didn't treat you right didn't show you
[55:09] the love he should have
[55:11] didn't didn't and and and because of
[55:14] that
[55:15] that's how you look at christ he's your
[55:18] father
[55:19] we sing this long my father knows what i
[55:21] need but if your earthly father didn't
[55:22] know what you need
[55:23] how can sometimes you can say i can't
[55:25] get past that i can't i can't i can't
[55:27] serve
[55:28] god or or you are serving god but you're
[55:30] doing it through
[55:31] fear and when you serve god through fear
[55:34] there's victory lacking in your life it
[55:38] could be little things
[55:39] it could be small things maybe there's
[55:41] healing lacking in your life
[55:43] because you you you just can't forget
[55:45] let yourself
[55:46] fully trust him because of what happened
[55:48] before so instead of saying
[55:50] lord help me trust you more lord help me
[55:51] trust you more say lord help me
[55:53] see you as my father like the words as
[55:56] you are
[55:57] help me to see you as my husband like
[55:59] the word says you
[56:00] are maybe your husband doesn't have his
[56:03] act together
[56:04] but um god is go but
[56:07] instead of looking after that or or past
[56:10] what not or the other
[56:12] you look at god through what the word
[56:14] says about him
[56:16] and that takes tremendous faith
[56:19] it takes tremendous faith when you has
[56:21] it have a interpretation not that god
[56:23] not that someone told you this is how
[56:24] god
[56:25] is but a similar relationship
[56:28] falsely represented to you what that
[56:30] relationship should be
[56:32] and that's not the truth of what it
[56:34] actually is
[56:36] according to god's word and you have to
[56:38] let yourself
[56:39] be like ruth and say well i'm just going
[56:41] to trust
[56:44] and when she did amen ruth
[56:47] excuse me boaz goes down
[56:55] and is her kinsmen redeemer
[56:58] plays the part of the kinsman redeemer
[57:01] and then now you watch
[57:03] maybe this will be the next sermon
[57:06] she received no life
[57:10] from her womb with her previous
[57:12] relationship the previous husband
[57:14] he died according to the scripture she
[57:17] remarries
[57:19] boaz who redeems
[57:22] her back to she was
[57:26] gentile she had no inheritance
[57:29] but because of her relationship with
[57:32] boaz
[57:33] who was her kinsmen through naomi
[57:37] she's now brings forth a promised son
[57:41] just like the bride of christ and what
[57:44] this is saying tonight is if you can
[57:46] love
[57:46] your boaz christ enough to trust him
[57:50] to lay had his feet in the presence of
[57:52] of many other
[57:54] similar men boaz was in charge of the
[57:58] of the the uh the threshing and
[58:00] everything but there were similar men in
[58:01] his position
[58:02] in the room in the threshing floor
[58:05] taking care of the wheat
[58:06] and doing all this but she went to boaz
[58:09] she went to the true representation of
[58:12] his position
[58:14] and he redeemed her and from that
[58:17] trust came
[58:21] the promised word and that
[58:24] is your victory your victory isn't found
[58:28] in emotion your victory isn't found in
[58:31] some preacher your victory isn't found
[58:33] in your
[58:34] mother your father your brother your
[58:36] sister your uncle
[58:38] your aunt your cousin your victory is
[58:40] found
[58:41] in the word but unless you surrender to
[58:44] boaz
[58:45] and go into that and know him
[58:49] until you do that and bring forth the
[58:51] seed of the word
[58:53] that's where you find your victory
[58:56] because
[58:59] god takes you under the shadow of his
[59:01] wings
[59:02] psalm says takes you into the shadow of
[59:06] his wing
[59:09] and the word that you bring forward
[59:14] is what gives you your victory i'll i
[59:16] decided that amazing
[59:19] god's word
[59:24] when you trust god we don't we don't
[59:27] preach a prosperity
[59:28] message when you trust god
[59:34] and you follow his will even though it's
[59:37] hard
[59:37] scary you find such
[59:41] peace there
[59:44] you find healing in your body you find
[59:47] healing in your relationship you find
[59:50] victory in your spiritual walk when you
[59:54] line right up where god says you should
[59:57] be
[59:59] it's scary to get there sometimes
[1:00:03] but even though god says don't be afraid
[1:00:08] don't fear do what do it do do what the
[1:00:11] word says to do
[1:00:14] he's going to give you he when he says
[1:00:16] don't be afraid he's not putting it all
[1:00:18] on you that you need to deal with your
[1:00:19] fear
[1:00:20] he says turn under me and i'll take care
[1:00:23] of your fear
[1:00:25] it's like cruise control you don't have
[1:00:27] to steer
[1:00:32] actually actually it could be cruise
[1:00:34] control and you got to follow a map
[1:00:37] but god is going to bring forth in your
[1:00:41] life
[1:00:43] everything he has preordained you to do
[1:00:47] and uh musicians want to come tonight as
[1:00:50] the closer we get to the drawing clothes
[1:00:52] of this age who knows
[1:00:54] when it will be
[1:00:57] god is moving on the heart of his bride
[1:01:03] we have the message of the hour we're
[1:01:06] feeding on god's word
[1:01:07] and god is is is is
[1:01:15] loving on us yes he is absolutely
[1:01:18] right i don't need to get up here and
[1:01:21] tell you what you're doing wrong
[1:01:25] because the way of the way of god's love
[1:01:27] is god's love is so
[1:01:28] pure god's love is so righteous
[1:01:33] just being with him makes you want to be
[1:01:36] a better person
[1:01:37] just being with him makes you ever have
[1:01:39] those those are the best friends you
[1:01:40] could have
[1:01:41] just being with them makes you want to
[1:01:43] be the best christian you can be
[1:01:44] those are the friends you want to find
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:47] those
[1:01:48] people you want to find it's the same
[1:01:49] thing with god that's what he says he
[1:01:51] says you know
[1:01:52] we don't read our bible and listen to a
[1:01:53] message because that's our
[1:01:55] duty or our chore he's inviting us
[1:02:00] into a communion with him
[1:02:05] when you find communion through the
[1:02:07] reading of the word
[1:02:08] then you that's that's it that's what
[1:02:11] god is looking for
[1:02:13] we matthew 25 we preached about the
[1:02:16] last time where are we in that scripture
[1:02:21] well if we're if we're receiving seed of
[1:02:23] christ now
[1:02:24] we're in with the bridegroom
[1:02:27] we've shut out the world we've shut out
[1:02:31] the foolish virgin they're off doing the
[1:02:33] thing trying to find their oil
[1:02:34] and we are with christ
[1:02:38] just because you're in there doesn't
[1:02:39] mean sometimes you say you sit on the
[1:02:41] other side of the bedroom
[1:02:44] that can happen you sleep on that side
[1:02:47] tonight
[1:02:50] but we want to continue to surrender
[1:02:52] because
[1:02:53] the more we surrender the more we spend
[1:02:55] time with god
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:57] the more you love him and when you love
[1:03:01] god
[1:03:01] when you love christ i prefer to say
[1:03:04] christ
[1:03:04] i actually when i do my notes i try to
[1:03:06] say christ instead of god
[1:03:08] not that that's a bad thing but when you
[1:03:10] say christ there's a more
[1:03:11] personal relationship there even i even
[1:03:14] noticed this one time i was witnessing
[1:03:16] just uh
[1:03:17] somebody that was working for us and
[1:03:19] when i would say i
[1:03:20] i said jesus christ he stepped back
[1:03:24] and every time in the conversation i
[1:03:25] said jesus christ you've got to have
[1:03:27] this funny look on his face there's
[1:03:28] power in the name of jesus christ
[1:03:32] amen that's the name of our
[1:03:35] husband you are mrs jesus christ
[1:03:39] and that's what he's telling you tonight
[1:03:41] because guess what the more he tells
[1:03:42] us that we are his wife
[1:03:47] the less yeah when you the more we
[1:03:50] become
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:54] you can get married maybe the honeymoon
[1:03:57] lasts the first year
[1:03:59] maybe maybe not
[1:04:02] and you you're married
[1:04:05] you're in a relationship you're
[1:04:07] receiving seed there's rocky times in
[1:04:09] that
[1:04:11] so you can't say oh well we can't be
[1:04:13] married to christ because my flesh
[1:04:16] no you can't god's
[1:04:19] able to get into that relationship with
[1:04:21] you
[1:04:22] because that's where he has to be for
[1:04:24] you to come to perfection
[1:04:26] it has to be that close of a
[1:04:28] relationship and as time goes on
[1:04:30] the blood of christ will grow into the
[1:04:34] statue of a perfect man
[1:04:36] will drop these ropes of flesh which can
[1:04:38] never be
[1:04:40] perfected but the spirit of christ
[1:04:44] in us forces the outward
[1:04:47] into alignment with god's word and i
[1:04:50] trust that
[1:04:51] that was okay tonight
[1:04:58] god's word is freaking me
[1:05:00] [Music]
