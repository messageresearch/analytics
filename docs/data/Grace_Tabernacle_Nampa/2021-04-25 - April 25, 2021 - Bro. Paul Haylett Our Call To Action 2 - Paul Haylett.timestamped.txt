[42:01] our brother sergey is not here but i saw
[42:04] his daughter
[42:05] and also other sister sarah and

[42:10] recently uh
[42:12] brother dinardo such a precious visit
[42:15] that we made in in
[42:16] oregon there had a chance to see him so
[42:19] we're just glad to be in the company of
[42:20] the saint where
[42:21] the spirit of god can move freely and
[42:23] where the word of god can touch our
[42:25] lives and our hearts and revive us
[42:27] this is the time for the bread revival
[42:29] you know you can't look for it to come
[42:31] down the road
[42:32] uh today is our day so we just want to
[42:35] jump in the water as it's being stirred
[42:37] not studying it wondering what's
[42:39] happening but just getting the spirit as
[42:41] the song
[42:42] are moving us already in that channel so
[42:44] you always do a fantastic job
[42:46] god bless you and we appreciate it of
[42:48] course
[42:49] i realized that uh yes things run in the
[42:52] family your brother's such a preacher
[42:53] and you're
[42:54] such a song leader just about so god
[42:58] bless you and
[42:59] marry just to enjoy the prince of the
[43:01] lord let loose
[43:02] and let the holy ghost move upon us and
[43:04] anoint his servant
[43:05] it's good to be with you god bless you
[43:10] amen well i have to tell you that um
[43:13] when brother tim was making his words
[43:15] there if you can't preach under this
[43:17] i was actually afraid he was going to
[43:19] bust out and start quoting the quotes i
[43:20] have in my sermon
[43:22] this morning amen so it's just good to
[43:25] be in the house of the lord just pray
[43:27] each and every one of you let's just
[43:28] open up amen we have the pure word of
[43:32] god it's come to us
[43:33] and we are the recipients of the
[43:35] greatest gift that has been given
[43:37] to mankind amen so let's just stand and
[43:40] go
[43:41] in our bibles to first samuel the second
[43:44] chapter once again
[43:45] uh just going to speak to you on a
[43:47] second part of our call to action
[43:50] and uh you know just kind of uh i just
[43:52] really feel like the presence of the
[43:54] lord is moving this morning just to hear
[43:56] the words of our brothers and
[43:58] what they're saying and and talking
[44:00] about revelation talking about action
[44:02] already
[44:03] and this is what's upon our heart today
[44:06] so just believing that uh god is moving
[44:09] in our midst
[44:10] do you believe god works in the whole
[44:11] body amen he's not just looking for some
[44:15] anointed minister while the people the
[44:17] prophet of god speaks of this
[44:18] while the people sit there and wonder
[44:20] what's going on there's just some
[44:22] anointed ministry
[44:23] this bride brother didier as you just
[44:25] spoke this bride
[44:27] is anointed by the word she
[44:30] is the word and it is alive in her
[44:34] it's it's not a dead letter we're not
[44:36] sitting here quoting as it would be
[44:39] uh luther and trying to find
[44:42] that was there we know what was there
[44:45] right
[44:46] as i was just you know sharing uh uh
[44:49] with uh brother tim as we talked to him
[44:50] just a little bit before the service
[44:52] today
[44:53] uh my brother and sister we don't quote
[44:55] the message because that validates what
[44:57] we're speaking
[44:59] we quote the message because we relate
[45:01] to what it is and it becomes alive to us
[45:05] and and really speaks the very essence
[45:07] of what is
[45:08] in our hearts amen if we need to quote
[45:11] the message to validate ourselves
[45:14] as message believers we've missed the
[45:16] whole revelation of jesus christ
[45:19] amen hallelujah let's just go to the
[45:22] word
[45:22] i got quite a bit today so amen
[45:26] first samuel the second chapter the
[45:29] first verse
[45:31] and hannah prayed and said my heart
[45:34] rejoiceth in the lord
[45:36] my horn is exalted in the lord my mouth
[45:40] is enlarged over mine enemies now we
[45:43] have to recognize my brother and sister
[45:45] that one of the enemies that
[45:47] hannah had was herself
[45:52] so see the word of god will come and
[45:55] actually cause you
[45:56] to overcome all of
[46:00] your self
[46:03] well i was raised in a very quiet or by
[46:07] nature our family
[46:08] doesn't worship by nature this by nature
[46:11] that
[46:11] by you'll overcome that
[46:14] you'll overcome that because i rejoice
[46:18] in thy salvation there is none as holy
[46:22] as the lord
[46:23] for there is none beside thee neither is
[46:27] there any
[46:28] rock like our god hallelujah
[46:32] we'll tie i pray with god's grace that
[46:34] back together
[46:36] talk no more so exceedingly proudly
[46:39] let not arrogancy come out of your mouth
[46:42] for the lord is a god of knowledge and
[46:43] by him
[46:44] actions are weighed the bows
[46:47] of the mighty men are broken
[46:50] and they that stumbled are girded with
[46:54] strength
[46:56] they that were full have hired out
[46:59] themselves
[47:00] for bread and they that were hungry
[47:03] ceased
[47:04] so that the baron hath born seven
[47:07] and she that hath many children is waxed
[47:10] feeble
[47:12] the lord killeth and maketh alive
[47:15] he bringeth down to the grave and
[47:18] bringeth
[47:18] up the lord maketh poor
[47:23] and maketh rich he bringeth low
[47:27] and lifteth off he raised up the poor
[47:31] out of the dust and
[47:32] lifted up the beggar from the dunghill
[47:35] to set them among princes
[47:37] and to make them inherit the throne of
[47:39] glory
[47:40] oh can't you say hallelujah to that we
[47:43] were nothing
[47:45] we were nothing my brother and sister
[47:47] and he brought us
[47:48] and makes us to inherit this throne of
[47:51] glory
[47:52] for the pillars of the earth are the
[47:53] lords and he has set the world upon them
[47:56] he will keep the feet of his saints
[48:00] and the wicked shall be silent in
[48:02] darkness
[48:04] for by strength shall no man prevail
[48:08] lord we ask blessings upon your word
[48:10] today
[48:11] bless your saints we pray amen you may
[48:14] be seated
[48:17] you know as we read these scriptures
[48:21] we see the action that god bringeth
[48:24] forth
[48:25] we see that everything that is done
[48:29] is done of the lord that no man can by
[48:32] his own strength
[48:34] accomplish anything and as we look at
[48:37] this i want to just go back real quickly
[48:40] and just to look at this through the
[48:42] scriptures
[48:45] verse 2 says there's none holy as the
[48:48] lord
[48:50] and there's no rock like our god
[48:54] my brother and sister everything we have
[48:56] has been built upon that rock
[48:58] hallelujah it was not a rock that come
[49:00] from some man's
[49:02] idea was not a rock that was something
[49:04] where we found a place and said okay
[49:06] this is this and this is that
[49:08] you know the prophet of god talking
[49:09] about how that these people gave
[49:11] reverence as it was to the supposed
[49:14] nails that were driven in our lord jesus
[49:16] and declares then that there are several
[49:18] sets they claim they have it they have
[49:20] that they have it they have it
[49:21] but those meant nothing my brother and
[49:23] sister because it was the very life of
[49:25] jesus christ that was given for you and
[49:27] i
[49:28] was what it was all about it wasn't if
[49:29] we had wood from the cross or the nails
[49:32] or the hammer that drove them
[49:33] none of that mattered my brother and
[49:35] sister because the plan of god
[49:37] was not actually centered around the
[49:39] actual event
[49:40] of the crucifixion but it was about the
[49:43] life
[49:44] that was in him and the restoration of
[49:46] the life in you and i
[49:48] amen and he knew what it would take to
[49:50] redeem you and i
[49:51] and so he went through the action of
[49:54] redemption
[49:55] because he knew what it would be now my
[49:57] brother and sister we can tie this back
[49:59] as we have spoken many times here in the
[50:01] church
[50:01] and realize that the very plan of
[50:03] redemption you see the lamb
[50:05] died before the foundation of the world
[50:07] and so it's not that we had an
[50:09] act even if they had had a video as it
[50:12] were
[50:12] of of the crucifixion that my brother
[50:15] and sister is something that god made
[50:17] real to you and i to understand in our
[50:19] human element
[50:20] uh the very cost that it was so it was
[50:23] not just words upon a page
[50:24] but mankind become a personal witnesses
[50:28] of the event of the sacrifice that was
[50:31] given
[50:31] and so it says here that uh by him
[50:35] actions are weighed and so as we are
[50:37] speaking of this my brother and sister
[50:40] you will find uh just trying to parry
[50:42] this down today to not be too long but
[50:44] you look at this and the prophet of god
[50:46] says in several places
[50:48] that if you believe that i'm
[50:49] paraphrasing this if you believe you
[50:52] will act upon it so if you don't act
[50:54] upon it you don't really believe it
[50:57] so we want to not today just be men and
[51:00] women of words
[51:01] but we want to be men and women sons and
[51:03] daughters of god of action
[51:05] we want to be able to take this word and
[51:08] apply it to ourself and
[51:10] brother brown uses many examples he
[51:11] talks about how you can't blame
[51:13] the the uh uh pharmacist you can't blame
[51:17] the man
[51:17] if you won't take the medicine and so as
[51:20] we'll come today by god's grace uh
[51:22] every man that was ever called had a
[51:24] calling in his life to the ministry
[51:26] and he stands there my brother and
[51:28] sister it is not by
[51:29] him but he is ordained of god called of
[51:33] god
[51:33] to bring as it were the medicine to the
[51:36] bride of christ and
[51:37] if she will receive it if if men and
[51:39] women will receive it
[51:40] it is a life-changing event but we have
[51:44] to
[51:44] receive it or act upon it and we go and
[51:47] look at these
[51:48] paradoxes that go down through this
[51:50] scripture verse 4 the bows of mighty men
[51:53] are broken so the very strength they had
[51:56] everything they had behind them is now
[51:58] broken
[51:58] and the weak the they the stumble are
[52:01] girded with strength all these are a
[52:02] paradox
[52:04] and so those that were once full once
[52:06] that had everything they needed had need
[52:08] of nothing
[52:09] uh find themselves uh hiring themselves
[52:12] out or laboring for bread and
[52:14] you know those that were hungry uh cease
[52:17] to be
[52:18] hungry now i want to tell you my brother
[52:20] and sister there's something that is
[52:21] happening in the bride of jesus christ
[52:23] a lot of things happening in the bride
[52:25] of jesus christ but one of the things
[52:27] that's happening in the bride of jesus
[52:28] christ i believe with my heart in the
[52:30] hour we're living
[52:31] is that they are hungering they're not
[52:34] just sitting waiting
[52:35] we can sit and watch the hours the days
[52:38] the weeks uh
[52:39] tick by but my brother and sister the
[52:41] bride of christ
[52:42] is hungering to see the word fulfilled
[52:45] it is not just well when the time has
[52:47] come it will be fulfilled
[52:49] you see we are there the ones that are
[52:52] called to sigh and cry for the
[52:53] abominations
[52:54] we're the ones that are troubled not
[52:56] just to see what's happening in the
[52:58] inner cities and
[52:59] to see all of the disparities of our
[53:01] nation and
[53:02] and governments but my brother and
[53:04] sister we are longing as brother jason
[53:06] sang the song this morning led us in
[53:08] that song
[53:09] this world is not my home and i hope
[53:11] that's not just words what we speak i
[53:13] hope there's something in an
[53:14] unction inside of us saying lord come
[53:17] quickly
[53:18] come quickly lord this is not my home
[53:21] i i don't feel comfortable here anymore
[53:23] i can't relate to it
[53:26] amen i know as a young man i was
[53:28] interested in sports and
[53:30] i'm not speaking about that if you have
[53:32] interest i'm not speaking down on that
[53:34] i'm just speaking along these lines but
[53:36] i i was a young man i was fanatically
[53:39] involved you love to ride dirt bikes i
[53:42] like to do
[53:43] certain things and and i found through
[53:45] the years my brother and sister
[53:47] that my interest in all of these things
[53:49] has waned
[53:51] but something inside me has not waned
[53:54] something inside me has not faltered
[53:56] something inside of me
[53:57] has not went away with time and there's
[53:59] something inside of me that's actually
[54:01] growing and it's getting
[54:02] stronger and stronger and stronger and
[54:05] that is my desire to stand in the very
[54:07] physical presence of my lord jesus
[54:10] christ no longer just to be a person
[54:12] that would
[54:13] just talk about it but lord let it be an
[54:15] action
[54:16] that takes place in me amen and we look
[54:20] at this and realize the lord killeth in
[54:22] verse 6
[54:23] and maketh alive he bringeth down to the
[54:26] grave and bringeth up
[54:27] the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he
[54:30] bringeth low and lifteth up
[54:32] he raised up the poor out of the dust
[54:35] lifted the beggar from the dung hill and
[54:37] set them among the princes
[54:39] to make them inheritors my brother and
[54:42] sister not just a name on a page
[54:45] i i like to you know study these things
[54:48] just to look at
[54:49] examples and my brother and sister you
[54:52] see you can write a will
[54:55] you can have an ancestry and you can
[54:56] write a will
[54:58] but the will in and of itself has no
[55:01] value unless there is something
[55:03] inside of the will
[55:06] for a man to die and just leave a note
[55:09] and to say to my son and to my daughter
[55:12] and there's nothing else there it's
[55:14] empty
[55:16] but my brothers and sisters we're
[55:17] inheritors of the greatest gift
[55:20] that has ever been imparted on the face
[55:23] of the earth
[55:23] we're inheritors of an inheritance
[55:26] immeasurable
[55:27] in the carnal we're inheritors my
[55:30] brother and sister
[55:31] of not only just eternal life but to
[55:34] have the very nature of our lord jesus
[55:37] christ
[55:38] i'm telling you that's something and we
[55:39] don't have to wait my brother and sister
[55:41] to inherit most of this
[55:43] for the word of god says and the prophet
[55:45] reiterates these things
[55:47] that we're here in heavenly places my
[55:49] brother and sister that's not when we're
[55:51] standing before the throne
[55:53] that's here you and i in the presence of
[55:56] almighty god
[55:57] receiving of the word and the life that
[56:00] was imparted in the word
[56:02] right now hallelujah not looking for a
[56:05] move
[56:05] tomorrow not looking for a move next
[56:07] week or next year
[56:08] but to know christ is here in you and i
[56:12] the hope of glory made a life
[56:15] hallelujah no longer ink upon the page
[56:18] but a
[56:18] living word testifying of jesus christ
[56:22] right here today hallelujah
[56:26] oh i'll tell you when we get to when we
[56:28] get that my brother and sister
[56:30] we catch that the very essence of it the
[56:32] fact
[56:33] that the hunger that you have
[56:37] is ceased but it's not
[56:43] and the reason we can say it ceased
[56:45] because in the carnal
[56:48] we look at this and realize okay you get
[56:51] up in the morning early with the sun
[56:52] and you work five or six hours you're
[56:56] hungry
[56:58] you said now and you eat
[57:02] in a few more hours you're hungry again
[57:06] or some of us seemingly in
[57:10] 30 minutes we're hungry again
[57:16] that in the flesh will never cease
[57:24] and the parallel is that your hunger
[57:29] has been satisfied when you come
[57:32] into the presence of god
[57:35] but yet in a little while
[57:39] you want to experience that again
[57:42] and again and again
[57:46] you see we don't come into the house of
[57:48] god
[57:49] and then leave here and say oh i'm
[57:51] satisfied and then have to go out there
[57:54] to find something to eat
[57:58] we get to come back again and again
[58:02] and again i love that
[58:06] because we can sit here i hope you're
[58:07] following me we can sit here today
[58:10] and say we are satisfied
[58:15] are you with me but i do want more
[58:20] i want to be fed again and i want to be
[58:22] fed again i want his presence again
[58:25] and again and again you see
[58:28] but our hunger for the things of the
[58:30] world has ceased
[58:32] i thank god for that my brother and
[58:35] sister because you see without the holy
[58:37] ghost we would be out there hungering
[58:39] with them
[58:40] but god in his mercy has come and and
[58:43] has
[58:43] satisfied that hallelujah and you look
[58:46] as we look down through these scriptures
[58:48] i think i've given enough example for
[58:50] you
[58:50] to see all of this my brother and sister
[58:54] is an action that god is bringing forth
[58:56] he's declared in his own word
[58:58] through the words of a prophet through
[59:00] through the words of the ages of men
[59:03] through the ages he has declared all of
[59:05] the things that he
[59:06] can and will do and desires to do and
[59:10] will do
[59:11] and you hope for and he will do
[59:15] amen and it comes down to that my
[59:17] brother and sister you see that
[59:19] everything that we have is because of
[59:22] him and he says in verse 9 he will keep
[59:24] the feet of his saints
[59:26] my brother and sister you can't tell me
[59:28] today god has not honored that in your
[59:30] life and my life he has
[59:32] kept our feet amen there has been so
[59:34] many things even in the context of the
[59:37] message come around
[59:38] where people trying to draw away
[59:39] different ideas different concepts
[59:41] but yet god constantly brings us right
[59:43] back to the word
[59:45] of god that has become our absolute
[59:48] and he guides us back to that over and
[59:51] over and over again
[59:53] you know forgive me for such a poor
[59:55] analogy but you know sitting in a modern
[59:57] day
[59:58] tractor and sitting there going down the
[1:00:00] field you know and
[1:00:01] and we're planting and season now is
[1:00:04] upon us and we're planting it
[1:00:05] i can watch the the gps monitor in the
[1:00:09] tractor
[1:00:10] amen and and i'll help you take this i
[1:00:12] hope this doesn't sound just
[1:00:14] ridiculous but all kinds of little
[1:00:16] analogies that people have put on that
[1:00:17] i always just like to view gps as god's
[1:00:20] positioning system
[1:00:22] amen he's got a way to position his
[1:00:24] bride and
[1:00:25] and you know i'm sitting in the tractor
[1:00:27] natural and i'm going down the field and
[1:00:29] i can watch the deviation
[1:00:31] and it's incredible what technology is
[1:00:33] done and this will tell me i'm now
[1:00:35] three tenths of an inch off of the line
[1:00:37] to the right and
[1:00:38] then the tractor will correct itself and
[1:00:40] we'll hit a little dip in the field
[1:00:42] and it might be an inch and a half off
[1:00:44] the line on the other side
[1:00:45] but you see what's happening is it is
[1:00:48] constantly trying to come back to the
[1:00:50] center
[1:00:51] it is constantly trying to come back to
[1:00:53] the line that was designated for it to
[1:00:55] follow
[1:00:56] and that's what the word of god is doing
[1:00:58] to you and i we might drift to the right
[1:01:00] or to the left
[1:01:01] but god's got a line his word that he
[1:01:04] called you and i to follow
[1:01:05] and he's bringing us back and we can
[1:01:08] fret and go oh my goodness
[1:01:09] i kind of got off over here in a little
[1:01:11] ism don't worry about it he's bringing
[1:01:13] you back
[1:01:15] he promised that he would bring you back
[1:01:17] he promised that he would guide your
[1:01:19] feet
[1:01:20] hallelujah and so you stand on that
[1:01:25] do we care yes we should care i don't
[1:01:28] want to get off and say oh no problem
[1:01:29] god will lead me back
[1:01:31] god put something in you to desire to be
[1:01:34] right on the word
[1:01:36] hallelujah it's not a desire to be close
[1:01:39] to the word
[1:01:44] the wicked shall be silent in darkness
[1:01:49] you know that's actually a pretty big
[1:01:50] subject really when you look at that
[1:01:52] and you can tie this back my brother and
[1:01:54] sister
[1:01:55] just a quick example egypt
[1:01:59] darkness come upon the land where they
[1:02:00] could not even function it was so dark
[1:02:03] but there was light and goshen
[1:02:05] hallelujah it was a world that was in
[1:02:07] darkness it was not in goshen
[1:02:09] there was not darkness and goshen and
[1:02:11] this world my brother and sister
[1:02:13] you can just look and i don't really
[1:02:14] follow the news but
[1:02:16] you know every day i kind of click on a
[1:02:18] deal just to see what is the craziest
[1:02:20] headline you might say of the day
[1:02:22] and we got we got people that are
[1:02:24] seemingly they were smart enough to make
[1:02:26] millions of dollars
[1:02:27] but not smart enough to have common
[1:02:29] sense
[1:02:31] and you look at the world and the
[1:02:33] insanity of what is becoming the normal
[1:02:38] come on i want you to think about this
[1:02:41] why
[1:02:42] can they say what they say and you look
[1:02:45] at that and go
[1:02:46] how could they say that what are they
[1:02:48] thinking is because
[1:02:50] the world is in gross darkness
[1:02:58] you know when sister jerry and i moved
[1:02:59] into the house
[1:03:01] here well i think it's been about a
[1:03:02] month
[1:03:04] we've tried to keep it real simple but
[1:03:06] you know
[1:03:08] you're used to being oriented a certain
[1:03:10] way
[1:03:12] you get up in the middle of the night
[1:03:15] and you run into everything
[1:03:19] you stubbed your toes you catch the
[1:03:23] chester drawers in the chest
[1:03:26] you thought the doorway was in front of
[1:03:28] you my brother and sister that's
[1:03:31] gross darkness it's upon the land they
[1:03:33] don't know which way to turn they don't
[1:03:35] know what they're doing
[1:03:36] they can't find a direction that is
[1:03:38] there some say we must this and some say
[1:03:40] we must list
[1:03:41] and some say but you see because they're
[1:03:43] in gross darkness
[1:03:44] the ones with the questions there's no
[1:03:47] one with the answer
[1:03:55] but he'll keep the feet of his saints
[1:03:58] because you see my brother and sister
[1:04:00] while they are in darkness
[1:04:02] isaiah 60 verse 2 you look at that while
[1:04:05] they are in darkness my brother and
[1:04:06] sister
[1:04:07] for behold darkness shall cover the
[1:04:09] earth and gross darkness the people
[1:04:11] but the lord shall arise upon who
[1:04:15] thee that's where god's at he's with
[1:04:18] these not out here in the church
[1:04:20] and i could even go further he's not
[1:04:22] here in a building my brother and sister
[1:04:24] it's just a building unless you're in it
[1:04:27] hallelujah and when you're in it you
[1:04:29] it becomes a house of god so you see it
[1:04:31] could be
[1:04:32] this almost became a daycare but god's
[1:04:35] grace we were able to buy the building
[1:04:37] so today this building that we enjoy as
[1:04:39] a house of god anointed filled with the
[1:04:41] spirit of god
[1:04:42] could have all week little children
[1:04:45] screaming
[1:04:47] unhappy parents and unhappy babysitters
[1:04:49] and
[1:04:50] all kinds of chaos which unfortunately
[1:04:53] is how i see
[1:04:54] babysitting
[1:04:58] but darkness is going to cover the earth
[1:05:00] and gross darkness the people
[1:05:03] but look how the word of god this
[1:05:04] prophecy coming forth so strongly so
[1:05:07] direct
[1:05:08] but the lord shall arise upon thee
[1:05:11] and his glory shall be near you
[1:05:15] it will be somewhere in the building no
[1:05:18] it says it would be
[1:05:19] upon thee hallelujah that's the position
[1:05:22] we claim do we not this morning
[1:05:24] it's upon me the spirit of god is upon
[1:05:26] me i'm not just going to go
[1:05:28] i'm not going to be a follower of the
[1:05:30] message i am the message
[1:05:33] [Applause]
[1:05:35] hallelujah too many people are happy to
[1:05:37] be followers
[1:05:39] you know that mex multitude left out of
[1:05:41] egypt my brother and sister
[1:05:42] they never had a hope from that moment
[1:05:45] of ever making it to the promised land
[1:05:47] they were followers
[1:05:53] and having mentioned that sometimes we
[1:05:56] in our human element get a little
[1:05:58] carried away we get caught up with
[1:05:59] spirits
[1:06:00] we get caught up with stuff but i just
[1:06:02] want to remind you all the complainers
[1:06:04] were left in the wilderness
[1:06:08] come on now i'm not i'm not trying to
[1:06:11] silence anybody so nobody misunderstood
[1:06:14] this
[1:06:14] but i'm just here just to remind you the
[1:06:16] complainers all stayed in the wilderness
[1:06:21] now i want to just follow along on this
[1:06:25] zachariah oh looks like we missed
[1:06:29] zechariah
[1:06:30] on the screen here that's fine zechariah
[1:06:33] 14
[1:06:34] 7 but it shall be one day which shall be
[1:06:37] known
[1:06:38] to the lord not day nor night but it
[1:06:41] shall come to pass
[1:06:42] that at evening time it shall be light
[1:06:46] now my brother and sister this is close
[1:06:48] enough you see he didn't come along
[1:06:50] and say it'll be on this certain day or
[1:06:52] certain time because we know human
[1:06:54] nature
[1:06:54] you and i oh i know most of you are not
[1:06:57] procrastinators
[1:06:59] but some of us are
[1:07:04] some of us are
[1:07:07] not you but people like you
[1:07:11] but you see my brother and sister what's
[1:07:13] happening is god's moving
[1:07:15] in the midst of his people and while
[1:07:17] some are just trying to nail down a
[1:07:19] certain day because
[1:07:20] really the truth of it is if they knew
[1:07:22] what day it was they could just be lax
[1:07:25] until that day but god don't want you to
[1:07:28] be locked
[1:07:28] until that day he wants you to get up
[1:07:30] every morning saying today is today
[1:07:32] the day is the day i'm going to serve
[1:07:33] god with all that's within me
[1:07:35] today is the day that i will walk and be
[1:07:37] a living testimony of jesus christ
[1:07:40] but we have this assurance that it's
[1:07:42] evening time now i want to ask you my
[1:07:44] brother and sister
[1:07:45] is there any more evidence needed
[1:07:46] according to the word of god that we're
[1:07:48] in the evening time
[1:07:50] do we need to look around and say well
[1:07:51] you know what maybe another
[1:07:53] no the prophet of god showed us clearly
[1:07:55] there's not another age
[1:07:57] amen there's not another witness as it
[1:08:00] were that's going to come upon the earth
[1:08:02] we have it
[1:08:03] we have had the word of god it has come
[1:08:05] he has been made known
[1:08:06] the seals are open the life is revealed
[1:08:09] it is in you
[1:08:10] and i we have the identification
[1:08:13] hallelujah
[1:08:14] so it's in this season that it shall be
[1:08:16] light
[1:08:17] not tomorrow not next week not next year
[1:08:20] this season right here this morning
[1:08:21] we should be able to lift a hand and say
[1:08:24] thank you lord i'm walking in the light
[1:08:26] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:30] and if we're not let's just not just
[1:08:32] ignore it move on let's stop and say
[1:08:34] lord
[1:08:34] what is blocking the light right for yea
[1:08:37] i walked through the valley of the
[1:08:38] shadow of death the light had to be
[1:08:40] there or there could not be
[1:08:41] a shadow so something's just between you
[1:08:45] and the light so just look and figure
[1:08:47] out what it is that's blocking the light
[1:08:49] and get that out of your life and walk
[1:08:51] in the light
[1:08:53] hallelujah not something to be afraid of
[1:08:57] amen god revealed the light you might be
[1:09:00] in the shadows right now might be in
[1:09:01] what you call dark shadows right now
[1:09:04] but god by revelation will open our eyes
[1:09:06] to look and see what the light is and
[1:09:08] move into that light
[1:09:10] now in the fourth seal brother branham
[1:09:14] excuse me i i feel pressured for time
[1:09:17] this morning
[1:09:18] you know it just well anyway
[1:09:25] look what brother brown says here on the
[1:09:26] fourth seal and when god tells you
[1:09:28] anything
[1:09:29] and says you go do this and i'll be
[1:09:31] right with it for this
[1:09:33] is my word he shows it in the bible then
[1:09:36] god stands right behind that
[1:09:38] right hallelujah everything that's in
[1:09:42] here for the bride of jesus christ you
[1:09:44] should be able to take a hold of
[1:09:45] with full confidence and march forward
[1:09:48] without looking right or left
[1:09:49] you know as i spoke to you the other day
[1:09:51] there's some things in our life
[1:09:53] you don't need to stop and pray about oh
[1:09:55] lord do
[1:09:56] lord do you want to heal me no
[1:09:59] sir stand up lord i claim my healing in
[1:10:02] the name of jesus christ
[1:10:04] lord do you want to fill me with the
[1:10:05] holy ghost no stand up i have repented
[1:10:08] i've been baptized and i fully expect to
[1:10:12] receive
[1:10:12] the holy ghost sometimes we just need to
[1:10:15] take action
[1:10:16] we get down and it's like well what
[1:10:18] should i do about this what should i do
[1:10:19] about that
[1:10:20] some things you need to pray through
[1:10:21] till you know absolutely but there's so
[1:10:24] many things that are right here in the
[1:10:25] word
[1:10:26] that god gives you direction and when he
[1:10:28] gives you direction you don't have to
[1:10:29] stop
[1:10:30] and say lord should should i do that
[1:10:32] lord should i praise your name
[1:10:34] lord should i have a prayer life should
[1:10:35] i read my bible lord i'm going to pray
[1:10:38] about
[1:10:38] should i go to church come on there's so
[1:10:41] many things are right here
[1:10:43] take a hold of it act upon it
[1:10:47] well you know no i'll tell you what that
[1:10:50] is
[1:10:51] so many people have turned to i'm
[1:10:53] praying about it
[1:10:54] as their cover
[1:10:58] i'm not doing it i know i should do it
[1:11:01] that's iniquity
[1:11:02] but i'm going to cover that
[1:11:06] i'm praying about going to church
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:15] i'm praying about
[1:11:18] come on it's in the word
[1:11:22] act on it don't sit around with some
[1:11:25] excuse i'm i'm praying about it i'm
[1:11:27] praying about it
[1:11:28] i'm praying about it send the word
[1:11:31] do it
[1:11:36] and if it's not written in the bible god
[1:11:37] stands behind it anyhow if it's god's
[1:11:39] word see
[1:11:42] now you'll find my brother and sister
[1:11:44] that people will use that right there as
[1:11:46] a loophole we won't even cover that this
[1:11:47] morning because it could take hours just
[1:11:49] covering that
[1:11:50] of what well let me just let me just
[1:11:53] poke at that just a second it's okay
[1:11:54] just to poke that
[1:11:56] i shared with you some time back i know
[1:11:58] these people breaks my heart
[1:12:02] well praise god i woke up in the middle
[1:12:04] of the night
[1:12:06] and the lord told me to leave my wife
[1:12:10] and go marry sister so and so
[1:12:17] well it's not written in the word that's
[1:12:19] for sure
[1:12:23] but it doesn't fit in the continuity of
[1:12:25] the word either
[1:12:27] but god told me i'm sorry that wasn't
[1:12:30] god that told you
[1:12:32] that was a spirit that come masquerading
[1:12:35] as the holy spirit
[1:12:39] you see the foundation the context is
[1:12:42] not there
[1:12:42] but it was present that that was written
[1:12:44] back then
[1:12:45] this is now well i'm sorry god's word is
[1:12:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:12:51] and so you come now to balance this
[1:12:53] example out
[1:12:55] there'll be things that happen in your
[1:12:57] life that you won't find a direct
[1:12:59] scripture to deal with
[1:13:02] and god deals with you and says go do
[1:13:05] this
[1:13:06] go speak this but you see it will always
[1:13:10] have continuity
[1:13:12] it will never transcend the word of god
[1:13:15] even though you can't go find a
[1:13:16] scripture to back
[1:13:18] it up it will always be in continuity
[1:13:24] and if god tells you well actually
[1:13:27] there's verses forgive my analogy
[1:13:28] because there is verses to back this up
[1:13:30] but if the lord told you you go to
[1:13:31] brother so-and-so and you give him
[1:13:33] everything that's in your wallet
[1:13:35] and he spoke to you and you just walked
[1:13:37] out of the bank your whole paycheck's in
[1:13:38] your wallet
[1:13:42] i know the people that this happened to
[1:13:44] no i won't share their name
[1:13:48] walked out of the bank wallet full of
[1:13:50] cash several thousand bucks in his
[1:13:51] wallet
[1:13:52] the lord spoke to him and says go to
[1:13:54] this family
[1:13:56] give them everything that's in your
[1:13:58] wallet
[1:14:02] i can't do that lord i have a house
[1:14:04] payment i have a car payment
[1:14:06] i have groceries my kids are in private
[1:14:08] school i can't
[1:14:10] go
[1:14:13] i don't remember the exact number he had
[1:14:14] four or five thousand dollars in his
[1:14:15] wallet
[1:14:17] he felt so weird knocks on the door
[1:14:20] brother and sister opened the door god
[1:14:21] bless you brother what are you doing
[1:14:22] here
[1:14:23] the lord told me
[1:14:27] they're like they look at each other
[1:14:33] then they start smiling greedy little
[1:14:36] beggars weren't they
[1:14:39] no sir because they just got off their
[1:14:42] knees praying lord
[1:14:44] we're in a desperate situation
[1:14:47] we need you to touch our situation
[1:14:54] here's the money brother gets back in
[1:14:57] his car he's like do i call my wife do i
[1:14:59] tell her that uh we're worse than
[1:15:03] bread and water this coming month and he
[1:15:06] gets home and walks in the door and his
[1:15:07] wife's standing there in there
[1:15:09] something to share with you honey i just
[1:15:11] i don't i don't know how to tell you i
[1:15:13] don't know how to tell you
[1:15:14] remember that brother we met at those
[1:15:16] meetings and he said oh god we'll bless
[1:15:18] you one of these days soon
[1:15:19] you know that brother i'm talking about
[1:15:21] yes honey
[1:15:22] he sent us a check for sixteen thousand
[1:15:25] dollars
[1:15:32] now look get it out of your mind about
[1:15:33] the numbers
[1:15:39] it's whether or not you can step outside
[1:15:42] the word of god
[1:15:45] and just follow god
[1:15:48] god says can you do it amen
[1:15:51] oh do your due diligence come on saints
[1:15:54] do your due diligence
[1:15:56] is this in the word of god or not is
[1:15:58] this voice that spoke to me
[1:16:00] is this the word of god or not
[1:16:05] i hope you follow me oftentimes though
[1:16:08] no i i can't i can't do that
[1:16:11] i can't do that
[1:16:15] and then if it's outside of that's
[1:16:17] revealed to prophets we realize that all
[1:16:19] the mysteries of god is made known to
[1:16:21] prophets
[1:16:22] and them alone see amos 3 7. now we'll
[1:16:24] get down really to
[1:16:26] the gist of this quotation i included
[1:16:28] that other just because i thought it was
[1:16:29] interesting it was awesome
[1:16:31] now now the power of revelation
[1:16:35] brings stimulation to the believer
[1:16:38] now if you say i saw something in the
[1:16:40] word i never saw before oh well
[1:16:42] there's something wrong there my brother
[1:16:43] and sister the power of revelation
[1:16:46] brings stimulation to the believer for
[1:16:48] the power of wine natural wine
[1:16:51] is to stimulate see it is to bring a
[1:16:53] person
[1:16:54] that's all slumped down to a stimulation
[1:16:56] see
[1:16:57] see well then now there is power
[1:17:01] is a power of the revelation of the word
[1:17:04] gives stimulation of joy to the believer
[1:17:07] stimulation of satisfaction the
[1:17:09] stimulation that it's vindicated
[1:17:12] it's proved see there is a stimulating
[1:17:15] power in the word of god
[1:17:16] when you can pick up this bible and
[1:17:18] recognize yourself
[1:17:19] in the chapters and the verses and the
[1:17:21] lines you recognize that it's you
[1:17:23] that this word is talking about it's a
[1:17:25] redemptive power of this word
[1:17:27] coming directly down to you that you can
[1:17:30] do that now my brother and sister you
[1:17:32] can't sit on a pew
[1:17:33] like some old dead stump you can't sit
[1:17:35] there somewhere
[1:17:36] there's got to be a stimulation that
[1:17:39] comes into the heart
[1:17:40] of the soul now we are indifferent as
[1:17:42] humans some can jump
[1:17:44] and shout and run and others are nice
[1:17:45] and quiet but i'm telling you somewhere
[1:17:48] someway there's got to be a stimulation
[1:17:50] comes to you
[1:17:51] and you recognize hallelujah i am a son
[1:17:54] of god
[1:17:55] i'm a daughter of god and before the
[1:17:57] foundation of the world
[1:17:59] god put this all in motion you come
[1:18:01] right down
[1:18:02] to my household in eyes i as a little
[1:18:05] swaddling baby
[1:18:06] and god identified it yes it's this one
[1:18:10] oh hallelujah oh we could go off into
[1:18:13] predestination but you know what i'm
[1:18:15] talking about this morning
[1:18:16] you see there's something that stirs it
[1:18:19] it's the power of the revelation of the
[1:18:21] word
[1:18:22] and this is why the world today there's
[1:18:24] like whatever there is 30 40
[1:18:26] 000 different religions all of this
[1:18:28] stuff my brother and sister
[1:18:29] and you can go and i'm sorry when i
[1:18:31] study sometimes i look at these things
[1:18:33] and they will argue endless arguments
[1:18:36] over
[1:18:36] a word while they themselves oh i hope
[1:18:39] this don't offend no one
[1:18:40] are sitting there so far out of the word
[1:18:45] and argue whether this word should be in
[1:18:47] greek or hebrew
[1:18:49] or aramaic and was it theory or the old
[1:18:55] come on i come across the deal the other
[1:18:58] day
[1:19:00] two ministers on youtube fighting
[1:19:03] over whether or not this woman preacher
[1:19:05] is right or wrong
[1:19:12] come on if either one of them had half
[1:19:17] a lick of sense they'd be going we can't
[1:19:20] find any place in the bible for her in
[1:19:22] that office period
[1:19:24] so whether she interprets the word this
[1:19:26] way or that way is irrelevant she
[1:19:28] shouldn't even be there
[1:19:29] interpreting it so you see that's what
[1:19:32] happens when you walk in darkness
[1:19:35] you think you're going out to the
[1:19:36] kitchen you end up in the closet
[1:19:43] now look at this stimulated now i want
[1:19:45] to just kind of catch this you know
[1:19:48] brother branham used this example about
[1:19:50] uh a wine here
[1:19:52] now my brother and sister this example
[1:19:55] of using wine here
[1:19:57] is to stimulate see to bring a person
[1:19:59] that's all slumped down to
[1:20:01] a stimulation
[1:20:04] we got people around the churches that
[1:20:06] are upright until they get to the wine
[1:20:09] and
[1:20:09] when it's all done they're slumped down
[1:20:11] they got a wrong revelation about that
[1:20:14] a little wine is good for the belly's
[1:20:17] sake
[1:20:20] well i'll just back up on that excuse me
[1:20:22] i didn't mean to bring that up in public
[1:20:26] it may be lawful but the word says
[1:20:29] it may not be expedient
[1:20:33] we saw this i won't name the country but
[1:20:35] sister jerry and i have
[1:20:36] witnessed this we witnessed a
[1:20:40] stimulation doctrine come amongst a
[1:20:42] group of people
[1:20:44] and it all started off with a little sip
[1:20:45] here and a little sip there
[1:20:48] and pretty soon it made it to the
[1:20:49] kitchen table pretty soon it made it to
[1:20:51] recreation
[1:20:53] and pretty soon i felt compelled and i'm
[1:20:55] not boasting on paul don't misunderstand
[1:20:57] me but i felt compelled to
[1:20:59] tell the interpreter that i was dealing
[1:21:00] with
[1:21:02] i will never ever ever preach with you
[1:21:04] again
[1:21:05] until you find deliverance from this
[1:21:09] but our pastor doesn't mind
[1:21:12] i don't care what your pastor minds you
[1:21:15] look like the world
[1:21:17] every little picture starting to show up
[1:21:19] on social media there's a wine bottle in
[1:21:21] the background
[1:21:22] and crystal and the table sat and
[1:21:24] pictures of them
[1:21:26] sipping swirling it
[1:21:29] do i got that right
[1:21:33] i wouldn't know you see my brother and
[1:21:36] sister
[1:21:37] this stimulation we're looking for is
[1:21:41] not
[1:21:42] in this carnal realm it is the power of
[1:21:46] god and if we get oh i'm going to take a
[1:21:49] hard line if any of you are drinking
[1:21:51] wine i'm telling you this is where i
[1:21:53] stand as a pastor
[1:21:54] my brother and sister if you get to the
[1:21:56] place you need a stimulation of wine to
[1:21:58] exist in this world
[1:22:00] you are backslid go find you an altar
[1:22:03] somewhere get down and pray
[1:22:04] because we've been provided with the
[1:22:06] greatest stimulation that was ever given
[1:22:08] to mankind
[1:22:09] and that is the revelation of the holy
[1:22:11] ghost god in you
[1:22:13] we don't need some carnal stimulation
[1:22:16] hallelujah amen that becomes a crotch
[1:22:19] that the devil throws out and then
[1:22:21] justifies
[1:22:22] hallelujah that wasn't in my sermon so
[1:22:24] we get that one for free today
[1:22:26] but you see to be stimulated my brother
[1:22:28] and sister we're not looking for
[1:22:30] a superficial stimulation
[1:22:33] we're not looking for an action that
[1:22:35] just gets it for the moment
[1:22:36] otherwise you know what that was one of
[1:22:38] the things as a young man that i
[1:22:40] i got i was caught up in you know they
[1:22:42] used different words for it but i was an
[1:22:44] adrenaline junkie
[1:22:45] you know i i that's why i love to ride a
[1:22:47] dirt bike is because
[1:22:48] it was you know literally just this one
[1:22:51] constant
[1:22:52] you know ride in the desert was one
[1:22:53] constant drill and rush to the next
[1:22:55] during
[1:22:55] the rest of the next adrenaline rush and
[1:22:57] and it's cool if you've ever done it you
[1:22:59] would say well that is that is really
[1:23:00] fun brother paul
[1:23:01] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:23:02] sister it comes so dominant in my life
[1:23:05] god had to deliver me from that
[1:23:09] so to go out and ride through the woods
[1:23:10] or do or whatever it might be
[1:23:12] see that's fine but whenever you become
[1:23:15] over dependent
[1:23:16] on something god will remember we're
[1:23:19] getting back to god's positioning
[1:23:21] and god will take that from your life
[1:23:24] because you then have another god before
[1:23:27] you
[1:23:28] and god says i won't allow no other god
[1:23:31] god doesn't come and say oh they got
[1:23:32] another god before him
[1:23:34] i'm throwing them out no god repositions
[1:23:36] you brings you down to where it's him
[1:23:38] and him alone
[1:23:40] hallelujah and so this is the action
[1:23:42] that the word is taking
[1:23:43] bringing us moving stimulating us to a
[1:23:45] place you see it's not superficial
[1:23:48] just uh makes it skin deep my brother
[1:23:50] and sister it's not
[1:23:51] intellectual amen there are those
[1:23:53] amongst us that are very intelligent
[1:23:56] very very intelligent you can't stop and
[1:23:58] say well they they can't have the
[1:23:59] revelation of jesus christ they're super
[1:24:01] smart
[1:24:02] no my brother and sister the revelation
[1:24:04] is not intellectual
[1:24:05] doesn't mean the man cannot have a great
[1:24:08] iq
[1:24:09] and and whatever else but my brother and
[1:24:11] sister the revelation that satan wants
[1:24:13] to give to the people
[1:24:15] is an intellectual intellectual come on
[1:24:18] can i drive that home
[1:24:19] intellectual revelation of the word of
[1:24:23] god for our hour
[1:24:24] but my brother and sister it is not
[1:24:26] intellectual intellect
[1:24:27] will not hold you it never got the uh
[1:24:33] amen i said it almost
[1:24:36] it never got the three musketeers i
[1:24:38] almost said that
[1:24:42] never got shadrach means meshach and
[1:24:44] abednego out of the fire
[1:24:46] intellectualism never got him out of
[1:24:48] that fire but
[1:24:49] faith in the world did amen
[1:24:57] now look what this word's doing my
[1:24:58] brother and sister
[1:25:00] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:25:03] we're being stimulated
[1:25:05] to revelation
[1:25:09] the words preached
[1:25:14] something clicks
[1:25:17] i've never heard it preached that way
[1:25:19] before
[1:25:24] lord is that correct
[1:25:29] the lord promised
[1:25:33] he would reveal himself to you
[1:25:37] so the word being preached and you say
[1:25:40] lord is that correct reminds me
[1:25:44] first time i heard a brother preach on
[1:25:46] the third pole
[1:25:48] i look back on this with great humor
[1:25:50] right because we were probably amongst
[1:25:51] the most superficial of message
[1:25:53] believers there was coming out of the
[1:25:54] church we came out of
[1:25:57] i remember a brother got up and he
[1:25:58] preached a sermon tied it all together
[1:26:01] of the third pole and i remember sitting
[1:26:03] there going
[1:26:05] what is he talking about
[1:26:09] i've never heard that preached in my
[1:26:11] life what is he talking about
[1:26:14] and just my own personal shorthand you
[1:26:16] know how you all know how to take notes
[1:26:18] and understand your own notes
[1:26:20] or maybe you understand your notes after
[1:26:22] you wrote them
[1:26:24] i made a little note third pull
[1:26:28] a circle with a check in the middle of
[1:26:29] it and to me that was
[1:26:31] check this out you know before i had a
[1:26:34] chance to check it out the very next
[1:26:36] message i was in brother brown's talking
[1:26:38] about the third pole
[1:26:39] and then another third pole and then the
[1:26:41] third pole and the third pole on the
[1:26:43] third point
[1:26:44] you see that's how revelation is coming
[1:26:45] in the church my brother and sister you
[1:26:47] might have a brother he comes and he
[1:26:49] preaches from a certain direction of
[1:26:50] something he's been studying
[1:26:52] and it comes and you say i've never
[1:26:53] heard that before don't just chunk that
[1:26:55] thing out ask god to reveal it is it
[1:26:57] true or not
[1:26:58] god said i will guide your footsteps i
[1:27:00] will keep your steps
[1:27:01] i will take care of you and so there
[1:27:04] that's how revelations being opened in
[1:27:06] the word
[1:27:06] and we come and we take a holds of that
[1:27:08] and as that stimulates us we start to do
[1:27:11] what
[1:27:12] we start to dig into the word deeper
[1:27:14] when i heard that brother
[1:27:15] preach on the third poll you know that's
[1:27:17] been i don't know probably 30 years ago
[1:27:20] but when i heard him preach on that you
[1:27:22] see there was something there i didn't
[1:27:23] just throw it out like that i'm never
[1:27:24] listening to that guy again
[1:27:26] i like that preacher i liked how he
[1:27:27] brought things and you know i want to do
[1:27:29] that but you see i prayed the little
[1:27:31] prayer god if this is real reveal it to
[1:27:33] me
[1:27:33] and so god come and before i even had a
[1:27:36] chance to become
[1:27:37] a a a i'm not a great student you know
[1:27:39] but to sit down and try and figure this
[1:27:41] out
[1:27:41] and those of you remember the old eagle
[1:27:43] program it wasn't the easiest to use and
[1:27:46] not every quote on something would come
[1:27:47] up you know
[1:27:48] so it would be easy to type something in
[1:27:50] and push it and say see
[1:27:51] it's not there
[1:27:55] but then you push play over here and
[1:27:57] hear the prophet's voice and there it is
[1:28:01] stimulation of revelation was it due
[1:28:04] you have a choice saints
[1:28:08] when god speaks the word to you you've
[1:28:11] got a choice
[1:28:12] to dig into it
[1:28:16] or to toss it out
[1:28:19] but if it's false i don't want to have
[1:28:21] gotten involved with it
[1:28:23] if it's false and you're a son or
[1:28:25] daughter of god you can't be deceived by
[1:28:27] it
[1:28:30] how many people sit in churches today
[1:28:32] have heard the open word
[1:28:34] preached and said i've never heard that
[1:28:37] before and they
[1:28:37] tossed it out right
[1:28:40] come on saints we're coming down to the
[1:28:43] time you either believe that the word of
[1:28:44] god will not
[1:28:46] let you be deceived
[1:28:50] or is if it were possible means
[1:28:52] something else besides what i understand
[1:29:01] see you're simulated to revelation and
[1:29:05] related to an action now my brother and
[1:29:08] sister
[1:29:08] look at this persuasion is not
[1:29:11] a substitute for revelation this is
[1:29:14] somebody can explain to you take a chart
[1:29:16] take a a deal start drawing lines and
[1:29:18] tying scriptures together and put in a
[1:29:20] quote here and
[1:29:20] do all of this and you go okay i see how
[1:29:22] that is that's not revelation
[1:29:24] revelations when it's made alive to you
[1:29:26] and it becomes a
[1:29:28] living part of you the living word
[1:29:31] amen otherwise it is just an
[1:29:33] intellectual
[1:29:34] understanding hallelujah but whenever it
[1:29:37] comes and revelation comes to you
[1:29:39] now look here in luke 4 i mean luke 6
[1:29:42] and 48
[1:29:43] amen what happens when you have
[1:29:45] revelation my brother and sister
[1:29:47] you come here he is like a man which
[1:29:49] built a house
[1:29:50] and digged deep
[1:29:54] he didn't scratch the surface to build
[1:29:57] his relationship with god on
[1:29:59] he dug deep and he dug
[1:30:02] all the way down until he got to the
[1:30:05] rock
[1:30:08] hallelujah anybody can scratch a little
[1:30:10] trench in the sand and pour a little
[1:30:12] concrete in it
[1:30:14] praise the lord god sent a prophet good
[1:30:16] you're scratching sand that's
[1:30:21] because the prophet of god said i came
[1:30:22] here to introduce you to jesus christ
[1:30:25] so that means that you might come to
[1:30:26] your place in your life
[1:30:28] that god anoints you by revelation to
[1:30:30] start
[1:30:31] digging and you start digging and you
[1:30:34] sweat and you get now pardon me pardon
[1:30:37] me some of you will some of you won't
[1:30:38] but i'm just gonna say it this way
[1:30:40] most of you can't handle a shovel for
[1:30:43] eight hours
[1:30:44] you end up with hands like this
[1:30:49] i don't mean that as an insult take it
[1:30:52] spiritually
[1:30:55] scratch the sand okay that's good enough
[1:30:59] for me
[1:31:01] or by revelation the prophet said
[1:31:04] there's a rock here somewhere
[1:31:07] and i'm going to keep digging till i get
[1:31:10] to that rock and you
[1:31:13] dig when you're tired you dig
[1:31:17] when you're sad you dig when you're
[1:31:19] happy
[1:31:20] and you dig when you're glad but you
[1:31:23] will not
[1:31:24] stop digging till you get to that
[1:31:28] rock and then when you get to that rock
[1:31:31] you can stop and say praise the lord
[1:31:34] this word of god is true this message is
[1:31:36] true
[1:31:37] this life is real and i believe it and
[1:31:40] you start building your house from there
[1:31:44] and then no matter what comes whether
[1:31:46] it's somebody on youtube somebody on the
[1:31:48] radio somebody here or somebody there
[1:31:50] or some circumstance of life no matter
[1:31:53] what comes
[1:31:54] you can say that's all right i dug down
[1:31:56] to the rock
[1:31:57] and i built upon the rock i didn't build
[1:31:59] on men's idea
[1:32:01] i didn't build on a man's revelation i
[1:32:03] built on the very word of jesus christ
[1:32:06] and this house will stand hallelujah
[1:32:10] that's the kind of action we need you
[1:32:12] just keep digging
[1:32:14] young people dig till you get to the
[1:32:16] rock all
[1:32:17] people dig till you get to the rock
[1:32:20] hallelujah that house will stand
[1:32:23] people say well i don't know does it
[1:32:25] really matter
[1:32:27] well i'll tell you i think it really
[1:32:28] matters not even for just
[1:32:31] eternal security as it were you know for
[1:32:33] eterna uh
[1:32:34] eternal life but my brother and sister i
[1:32:37] know a man
[1:32:37] and sorry to put it this way kind of a
[1:32:39] direct deal i know a man i guess you
[1:32:41] would say he's a friend of mine
[1:32:42] and you know and after he went through
[1:32:44] his third wife his third marriage
[1:32:46] and everything was a wreck he woke up
[1:32:48] one day and he had courage enough to say
[1:32:50] you know what paul i figured out that
[1:32:52] the women the wives they weren't the
[1:32:54] problem
[1:32:54] i was the problem oh my brother and
[1:32:57] sister are we going to get to the place
[1:32:59] that we recognize i am the problem it's
[1:33:02] not the pastor of the church
[1:33:04] it's not a song leader a piano player
[1:33:06] this family that family that family
[1:33:08] i am the problem and when we can grasp a
[1:33:12] host of that
[1:33:12] you're getting pretty close to the rock
[1:33:15] because the rock brings us the prophet
[1:33:16] of god says the rock brings us
[1:33:18] to humility it doesn't bring us to
[1:33:21] arrogance it doesn't bring us high and
[1:33:23] mighty
[1:33:23] it actually humbles us down when we get
[1:33:26] to the rock
[1:33:28] oh thank you lord this is the kind of
[1:33:31] action we need to have
[1:33:33] amen hallelujah
[1:33:36] see not some shallow feeble attempt
[1:33:41] pardon me for putting it this way but
[1:33:43] not a sandbox experience
[1:33:47] now i've got a quote just in case
[1:33:48] anybody kind of
[1:33:50] wonders where i'd pull this from
[1:33:53] now it was all the way back from 53 and
[1:33:56] to people who like to use the calendar
[1:33:58] to dictate whether it was revelation or
[1:33:59] not
[1:34:00] this might be too old for you
[1:34:03] i'm not making fun of that there's a lot
[1:34:05] of people
[1:34:06] if it don't fit right here it's not real
[1:34:09] revelation
[1:34:11] well you go ahead and fit it on the
[1:34:13] calendar
[1:34:14] i'll tell you if it fits right here it's
[1:34:16] real revelation
[1:34:18] i don't need a calendar to tell me
[1:34:20] whether it was revelation or not
[1:34:24] making the valley full of ditches now as
[1:34:26] i tell you all the time saints go back
[1:34:28] read the whole context people don't like
[1:34:31] that term they like to use it derogatory
[1:34:33] you cherry pick that yes i did otherwise
[1:34:34] we'd be here for several hours because i
[1:34:36] got quotes out of three or four
[1:34:37] different sermons and we had to go from
[1:34:39] beginning to end
[1:34:40] we might be having our fellowship about
[1:34:41] 10 o'clock tonight
[1:34:44] i give you the resource you do your
[1:34:47] homework
[1:34:49] if i took it out of context or used it
[1:34:52] ungainly for the
[1:34:54] point then you are more than welcome to
[1:34:57] come and say
[1:34:57] you use that incorrectly
[1:35:00] trouble of it is you go to digging
[1:35:04] first thing you know you stick your
[1:35:06] shovel down and say pay 10 he's talking
[1:35:08] about tithe
[1:35:09] oh oh can't do that you don't get much
[1:35:13] water
[1:35:18] you know i had a brother he never
[1:35:19] preached it i often wondered why i think
[1:35:21] he thought maybe it actually was a
[1:35:22] little too strong of a pill
[1:35:26] he said i felt like preaching a service
[1:35:29] brother paul
[1:35:33] where i called on each husband each
[1:35:36] brother
[1:35:41] and cause them to
[1:35:44] show what they have
[1:35:48] and what they give and the correlation
[1:35:51] of the blessing
[1:35:54] involved
[1:35:57] then i got to thinking about it
[1:36:01] and he thought as a visitor
[1:36:05] that's probably not a good idea
[1:36:09] but my brother and sister the scripture
[1:36:11] says
[1:36:17] amen the scripture says
[1:36:23] oh can't do that you don't get much
[1:36:25] water
[1:36:26] the next you god if you'll just keep on
[1:36:29] digging brother
[1:36:30] come on keep on digging brother that's
[1:36:32] what i'm here for this morning saints
[1:36:34] keep on digging brother
[1:36:35] keep on digging dig them old doubts out
[1:36:39] them old dish pans and rocks and stones
[1:36:41] and things like that
[1:36:43] dig deep enough to throw it mostly out
[1:36:48] oh dig deep enough to throw it all
[1:36:52] out get enough water flowing there so
[1:36:55] you can get a good decent drink once in
[1:36:57] a while
[1:36:57] what's the matter tonight you got to dig
[1:36:59] away from your church
[1:37:03] you know i might as well just go for
[1:37:05] broke today
[1:37:07] you know the very thing where the
[1:37:09] prophet of god talked about people
[1:37:10] standing up and saying are you a
[1:37:12] christian no i'm a baptist
[1:37:18] i'm now serene you know that's invaded
[1:37:22] us
[1:37:25] i go to this church this brother
[1:37:28] is my pastor who is your pastor well you
[1:37:34] ain't never heard of him
[1:37:40] dig away from your church we didn't come
[1:37:43] here to be identified by our pastor
[1:37:48] dig away from this dig away from that
[1:37:51] dig
[1:37:52] into christ jesus there's the whole
[1:37:56] point now look my brother and sister
[1:37:57] don't misunderstand me we have brother
[1:37:59] didier here today
[1:38:00] there's nothing wrong with the saints of
[1:38:02] his church which i know love him very
[1:38:04] much
[1:38:04] identifying brother didier is our pastor
[1:38:06] and we are happy about that
[1:38:08] but here it is i believe well let me
[1:38:10] just maybe not worth quite as much
[1:38:12] confidence
[1:38:13] i i believe you guys love me
[1:38:18] and it's okay to be identified brother
[1:38:20] paul's our pastor
[1:38:22] but you see my brother and sister this
[1:38:23] message is not about the pastor
[1:38:26] the message is about jesus christ and
[1:38:29] the word
[1:38:30] revealed in you and i and god ordained
[1:38:32] through the word of god to use our
[1:38:34] brother
[1:38:35] to use ministry to bring the word out to
[1:38:37] you and i
[1:38:38] but remember god will not let another be
[1:38:41] before him so many people are like our
[1:38:45] heart is broken our pastor fell well the
[1:38:46] reason he fell
[1:38:47] is you put him on top of this pinnacle
[1:38:49] where there's no oxygen up there
[1:38:52] and he fell off for lack of oxygen
[1:38:56] so whose fault is that if the people had
[1:38:59] said i love my pastor
[1:39:01] i love how he preaches a word but you
[1:39:03] know sometimes i don't agree with him
[1:39:05] i think he ought to use a fork and he
[1:39:07] eats with his mouth open
[1:39:08] and he you can do all of that but
[1:39:12] honor the office honor the man in the
[1:39:15] office my brother and sister
[1:39:16] and you will come and find god will
[1:39:18] bless you for that and the channel is
[1:39:20] open
[1:39:20] and the word of god can be preached with
[1:39:22] liberty and you can walk out knowing
[1:39:24] that it was god that spoke to you
[1:39:26] and you can walk out knowing that god
[1:39:28] put that man in the pulpit and he was
[1:39:30] there
[1:39:30] because that was the right man for your
[1:39:32] life for your family for the word to be
[1:39:34] open to you
[1:39:35] in the way you understood it but it had
[1:39:38] to be god
[1:39:39] the action behind all of it has to be
[1:39:42] god
[1:39:45] so what are we going to do we got to dig
[1:39:47] away from our church
[1:39:48] we got to dig away from this and dig
[1:39:50] away from that and dig into christ
[1:39:52] and when we get dug into christ my
[1:39:54] brother and sister then we
[1:39:55] are on the right track then we're on the
[1:39:58] right point
[1:39:59] then we're guided by the word of god
[1:40:02] hallelujah not a man hallelujah
[1:40:06] i'm telling you this revelation of this
[1:40:08] hour is not a feeble little revelation
[1:40:11] this is not a look i signed my name on
[1:40:12] the book kind of revelation
[1:40:14] this is god himself coming down
[1:40:17] scrubbing you
[1:40:18] inside and out and pouring himself
[1:40:21] into you hallelujah
[1:40:24] that's the kind of revelation i want
[1:40:28] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:32] now look i know that research says you
[1:40:35] shouldn't read a lot
[1:40:36] because people lose attention but i'll
[1:40:37] just do my best to keep this
[1:40:39] now look i tell you my brother and
[1:40:41] sister i just was studying and
[1:40:43] felt very inspired in this it's quite
[1:40:45] lengthy but i think it's a sum total of
[1:40:47] what we're trying to say today
[1:40:48] let me show you another reason why satan
[1:40:50] hates this book of revelation of jesus
[1:40:52] christ in the church
[1:40:54] he knows that jesus christ is the same
[1:40:56] yesterday today and forever
[1:40:57] and change is not
[1:41:01] i'll tell you what i think i think i
[1:41:03] just heard my shovel
[1:41:04] hit on the rock
[1:41:09] hallelujah
[1:41:15] he knows a whole lot more than 90
[1:41:18] percent
[1:41:19] of the message preachers
[1:41:22] oh excuse me that might have been my
[1:41:25] note
[1:41:27] whole lot more than 90 percent of
[1:41:28] theologians
[1:41:30] he knows that since god is immutable in
[1:41:32] his nature
[1:41:33] then he's just as immutable in his ways
[1:41:36] thus satan knows assuredly that the
[1:41:38] original church at pentecost
[1:41:39] with the power of god mark 16 in action
[1:41:44] now let's look at this my brother and
[1:41:45] sister
[1:41:48] mark 16 in action
[1:41:52] oh is the true church that jesus claims
[1:41:55] as his own
[1:41:56] all else is false it has to be
[1:42:00] now look at this
[1:42:04] mark 16
[1:42:08] when we study it is a recollection
[1:42:12] of eyewitness report
[1:42:18] go read it that way don't just run
[1:42:20] through it my brother and sister
[1:42:23] mark 16 brings it down very
[1:42:26] carefully
[1:42:31] we saw jesus this morning amen that's it
[1:42:35] he's risen no you didn't
[1:42:39] where'd you get this crazy idea how do
[1:42:42] you think you saw jesus
[1:42:46] go read it two were walking in the way
[1:42:51] and he comes and he walks with them and
[1:42:55] when revelation
[1:42:56] strikes them this is the christ right
[1:42:59] here in our presence
[1:43:02] he disappears from them what did they do
[1:43:06] went home said we'll sleep on it no sir
[1:43:10] they turned right around and beat feet
[1:43:12] right back to the city
[1:43:14] and went right back to the city and told
[1:43:15] them we saw the christ
[1:43:17] and what did they do no you never
[1:43:21] we don't believe that come on saints
[1:43:25] there's more to mark 16
[1:43:27] than just taking up serpents and
[1:43:28] drinking things and
[1:43:30] whatever there's a lot more to this you
[1:43:31] see what it was is he was there in their
[1:43:33] presence
[1:43:34] and they couldn't get enough faith in
[1:43:36] them to believe
[1:43:38] that his word had actually come to pass
[1:43:42] but he told them this is what's going to
[1:43:43] happen he'd already
[1:43:45] revealed the word to them of what was
[1:43:48] going to happen and while it's happening
[1:43:50] they can't find enough faith to believe
[1:43:52] it
[1:43:53] now i'm going to tell you we've been
[1:43:54] told what's going to happen and we are
[1:43:56] seeing it happen and it is coming to
[1:43:58] pass right in our presence
[1:43:59] and people don't have enough faith to
[1:44:01] believe
[1:44:02] that god is in them they got enough
[1:44:05] faith to believe that god is present in
[1:44:07] the church
[1:44:07] that he's present in the bride that the
[1:44:09] word is unfolded that the mystery of
[1:44:12] jesus christ
[1:44:13] is open they don't have enough faith to
[1:44:14] believe that but yet
[1:44:16] it has been spoken
[1:44:25] it's a true church that jesus claims
[1:44:27] this is oats all else is false
[1:44:30] claims as his own all else is false
[1:44:33] has to be now remember this christ in
[1:44:35] the true church
[1:44:36] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:44:41] now brother and sister i've heard it
[1:44:42] spoke this way i hope you just give me a
[1:44:44] little grace in making this
[1:44:45] representation
[1:44:47] i heard a brother one time say
[1:44:51] the book of actions because you look in
[1:44:54] the book of acts
[1:44:56] and there's all kinds of things
[1:44:57] happening
[1:44:59] you do not open the book of acts and
[1:45:02] find some people
[1:45:03] sitting in a church singing three songs
[1:45:08] meditating for a few minutes getting up
[1:45:11] and
[1:45:11] walking out to come back on wednesday
[1:45:15] and do it again to come back on sunday
[1:45:18] to do it again to come back on wednesday
[1:45:21] to do it again
[1:45:22] come back on sunday to do it again it
[1:45:24] was a book
[1:45:25] of action they believe the word of god
[1:45:29] they spoke
[1:45:30] the word of god they claimed the word of
[1:45:32] god and the word of god came to pass
[1:45:35] a book of action my brother and sister
[1:45:37] and the prophet of god says right here i
[1:45:39] hope you'll give me grace on that
[1:45:41] example
[1:45:41] and the prophet of god says right here
[1:45:43] this is a continuation
[1:45:46] of the book of those actions it's going
[1:45:49] to be
[1:45:49] present in our day it's going to be
[1:45:52] alive in our day
[1:45:53] and he promised to be here in our day
[1:45:57] hallelujah not hey we believe a message
[1:45:59] oh everything's good
[1:46:01] my brother and sister a book of actions
[1:46:07] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:46:09] that the antichrist spirit will come
[1:46:11] into the church
[1:46:12] and defile it making it lukewarm formal
[1:46:14] and powerless
[1:46:16] don't feel bad it was right there when
[1:46:18] they come back
[1:46:20] and said we just saw christ no you never
[1:46:24] he was walking with me who do you think
[1:46:27] you are
[1:46:29] he talked to us god don't do that
[1:46:32] anymore
[1:46:34] oh you think those spirits are dead
[1:46:37] those spirits are alive
[1:46:39] i'll tell you you probably upset
[1:46:41] somebody
[1:46:42] but when people say you're only going to
[1:46:44] hear from god if you listen to a tape
[1:46:46] are defying the written word of god
[1:46:51] they've got it in their mind that it's
[1:46:52] got to be this way because we're going
[1:46:54] to eliminate
[1:46:55] the preachers
[1:46:58] i'll show you where god put it in the
[1:47:00] word of god you showed me where he took
[1:47:01] it out yeah that's right
[1:47:03] come on why because
[1:47:07] they don't want a living god in their
[1:47:10] midst
[1:47:11] with action because that living god's
[1:47:14] going to walk into and oh and i know
[1:47:15] we're all susceptible to these things
[1:47:16] i'm not preaching against you
[1:47:18] but we don't want the word coming into
[1:47:21] our video library
[1:47:23] we don't want the word coming into our
[1:47:25] music library
[1:47:27] we don't want the word coming into our
[1:47:30] closet
[1:47:34] and we don't want the word censoring our
[1:47:37] language
[1:47:40] come on right
[1:47:45] so antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:47:48] church
[1:47:48] defile it making it lukewarm and for
[1:47:51] formal
[1:47:52] and powerless
[1:47:57] oh my
[1:48:02] let me just go back to mark 16 for just
[1:48:04] a moment
[1:48:11] mark 16 10 she went and she
[1:48:15] told him she'd been with him
[1:48:22] they're mourning and weeping
[1:48:26] she's there to tell him i've been with
[1:48:28] him

[1:48:33] one

[1:48:42] bedroom

[1:48:54] who do you think you are
[1:48:57] come on saints the spirit's not dead
[1:49:00] that spirit's still living
[1:49:09] and he appeared in another form unto
[1:49:10] them too as they walked and
[1:49:12] went into the country they went and told
[1:49:14] it into the residue
[1:49:16] neither believe they them
[1:49:19] come on don't look at me like i'm
[1:49:22] sensational this morning
[1:49:23] but i've been walking with him i've been
[1:49:26] walking with him
[1:49:27] it's only by his grace but i'm walking
[1:49:29] with him
[1:49:30] hey man i'm not sitting down i'm not
[1:49:33] just waiting for him to do something
[1:49:35] i've been walking with him
[1:49:38] [Music]
[1:49:40] hallelujah well you're the most unlikely
[1:49:43] person that god would reveal himself i
[1:49:45] know i don't understand it either
[1:49:48] but he has been walking with me
[1:49:50] hallelujah
[1:49:52] look my brother and sister and when he
[1:49:55] meets them
[1:49:57] oh my forgive me
[1:50:00] no holds barred this morning
[1:50:05] some people believe that when brother
[1:50:06] brother comes back there's going to be a
[1:50:07] big tent and it's going to
[1:50:08] be clear full
[1:50:13] had a brother one time tell me he says
[1:50:14] bro paul if that's true he says
[1:50:16] i'm poor and i live in south america i
[1:50:18] could never i could never go
[1:50:20] there i said don't worry about it
[1:50:24] brother
[1:50:25] just pray god will make a way
[1:50:29] and don't worry about a seat because
[1:50:31] after the first couple nights
[1:50:33] the tent's gonna be mostly empty well
[1:50:38] come on you say why do you say that
[1:50:39] brother paul
[1:50:40] because he met them right here
[1:50:44] and he said he upgraded them
[1:50:50] our prophet the kind old grandfather
[1:50:54] is going to rip the hide off
[1:50:58] of us oh don't think i believe he's
[1:51:02] coming back i'm making a point to you
[1:51:05] he can't be anything but the word here
[1:51:07] you guys have watered it down the church
[1:51:09] is all cold and formal but praise god
[1:51:11] you believe my message
[1:51:12] no sir if we believed his message we'd
[1:51:14] acted on it and our church won't be cold
[1:51:17] and it won't be formal and it won't be
[1:51:18] filled with all kinds of garbage
[1:51:20] it will be swept out and the fire will
[1:51:23] be burning and there will be sons and
[1:51:24] daughters of god
[1:51:25] that will be testifying of the power of
[1:51:27] god and how he's still moving in me and
[1:51:30] my wife and my children and their
[1:51:32] children will be saying
[1:51:33] i saw god moving me my mama and my daddy
[1:51:38] come on saints you see satan's very
[1:51:42] clever he's come right here
[1:51:44] and he's moving into the church and he's
[1:51:46] trying to make it lukewarm
[1:51:48] and there'll be one thing that stands
[1:51:49] before the church being lukewarm
[1:51:51] and that's the holy ghost we can agree
[1:51:55] with that can't we
[1:51:56] but you know what it will be the holy
[1:51:58] ghost in you
[1:52:02] come on it's not just the holy ghost my
[1:52:04] brother and sister
[1:52:05] if we all compromise then we are a
[1:52:07] compromised church
[1:52:09] it will be the holy ghost in you that
[1:52:11] stands up and says i want the pure word
[1:52:13] of god
[1:52:14] i don't want some other kind of garbage
[1:52:16] don't be taking my milk
[1:52:17] and watering it down don't make my pepsi
[1:52:20] and water it down amen
[1:52:22] you wouldn't drink that in the natural
[1:52:26] come on i know these are poor analogies
[1:52:28] forgive me for that but it's the word of
[1:52:30] god
[1:52:31] and people sitting back watching it
[1:52:32] watered down and saying well i think i
[1:52:35] understood what he did
[1:52:36] and it sure is nice our church is
[1:52:37] growing
[1:52:40] it is it's growing
[1:52:44] lukewarm formal
[1:52:47] and powerless am i preaching too hard
[1:52:50] this morning
[1:52:51] hallelujah amen
[1:52:55] hallelujah see this is the church it was
[1:52:57] called action what does it do my brother
[1:52:59] and sister sometimes you know i have
[1:53:00] that little complex you all know it i
[1:53:02] apologize for things i shouldn't
[1:53:03] apologize for
[1:53:04] i should tear the height off even harder
[1:53:06] and i'm apologizing i'm sorry
[1:53:07] i apologize for apologizing
[1:53:12] but look what the word of god says the
[1:53:14] prophet says it exposes satan
[1:53:17] now satan the biggest chameleon there is
[1:53:20] knows how to hide in every way knows how
[1:53:21] to just do everything just right
[1:53:24] knows the right language they're not
[1:53:25] right dress the right dis
[1:53:27] all this stuff he knows it just right
[1:53:28] but it still exposes it
[1:53:32] revealing his works the attempted
[1:53:33] destruction of god's people that ought
[1:53:35] to get you
[1:53:36] now when i use these words i don't mean
[1:53:37] it in the flesh like we would normally
[1:53:39] but that ought to make you
[1:53:40] mad the fact that satan wants to destroy
[1:53:43] you
[1:53:43] ought to make you mad you ought to stand
[1:53:45] up and say you know what i've had enough
[1:53:46] of that devil
[1:53:47] you're not going to tear me down you're
[1:53:49] not going to ruin my marriage you're not
[1:53:50] going to ruin my family
[1:53:51] i will not put up with it right the word
[1:53:54] of god says and i'm
[1:53:55] victorious the word of god says i'm an
[1:53:58] overcomer the word of god says i have
[1:54:00] the token
[1:54:01] over my household and satan no more
[1:54:04] [Applause]
[1:54:07] but we'll have an obama line oh i
[1:54:10] shouldn't have said that forgive me
[1:54:12] but if you just look back through
[1:54:14] history you'll understand what the term
[1:54:15] obama line was
[1:54:16] that's when he went out and he told the
[1:54:18] world i'm sorry
[1:54:20] i have to draw this line
[1:54:23] and if you don't like that line
[1:54:27] i'll draw this one and if that was still
[1:54:30] offensive
[1:54:32] i'll draw this one
[1:54:35] no sorry there's got to be some
[1:54:36] preachers not right brother did he got
[1:54:39] to be some preachers are going to stand
[1:54:40] up and say this is a line
[1:54:42] it's always been the line and we're not
[1:54:44] moving it for nobody
[1:54:45] and the devil or even the most favorite
[1:54:47] deal the biggest tithe pair in our
[1:54:49] church the line
[1:54:50] don't move
[1:54:51] [Applause]
[1:54:58] yeah destruction god's people
[1:55:00] discrediting god's word right down to
[1:55:02] the time he he's cast in the lake of
[1:55:03] fire
[1:55:04] imagine how the devil knowing he's going
[1:55:06] the lake of fire right he's read the
[1:55:07] book
[1:55:09] how he's going to still exalt in the
[1:55:12] fact that even as he's being tossed in
[1:55:14] the lake of fire
[1:55:15] he takes one last one with him
[1:55:20] well i'll tell you what
[1:55:24] brother ron spencer preached down

[1:55:47] just give it back to him because you
[1:55:49] know what the devil
[1:55:50] ain't making it to heaven but the blood
[1:55:54] oh hallelujah the blood on this old
[1:55:57] mortal flesh that we
[1:55:59] labor over and we pamper and we do all
[1:56:01] of this it's the blood

[1:56:17] revelation of the true church

[1:56:51] move my children to the wilderness
[1:56:52] and pray that somehow they survive and
[1:56:54] meet a godly man or a godly woman
[1:56:56] and get married and live happily ever
[1:56:58] after
[1:57:01] well i had a man sit there and tell me
[1:57:02] one time praise the lord i'm moving my
[1:57:04] family out here in the sticks
[1:57:06] to get him away from all this worldly
[1:57:07] stuff
[1:57:09] you know his kids almost to the one have
[1:57:11] backslid
[1:57:15] because it's not flesh and blood amen
[1:57:18] it's not addressed
[1:57:25] if they get a true revelation true
[1:57:27] church what she is what she stands for
[1:57:29] and that she oh oh oh
[1:57:33] think the prophet of god just
[1:57:34] accidentally said these words in this
[1:57:36] way
[1:57:38] oh it can't be because if he did he made
[1:57:39] a lot more accidents of the way he said
[1:57:41] things
[1:57:42] that she can do you know what that is
[1:57:46] action action she's got a revelation
[1:57:49] of what i'm gonna do i'm not gonna sit
[1:57:53] back and say oh i praise the lord i hope
[1:57:55] it all works out
[1:57:56] she's gonna do the greater work she's
[1:57:58] gonna stand up and say the bible said do
[1:58:00] it
[1:58:01] i'm gonna do it amen the holy ghost
[1:58:03] moved me to do it i'm gonna do it
[1:58:06] hallelujah she can do the greater works
[1:58:08] she will be
[1:58:09] a invincible army if they get a true
[1:58:12] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:58:14] framework of the christian church
[1:58:16] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:58:17] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:58:19] satan will be powerless before her you
[1:58:22] know what my brother and sister i hope
[1:58:23] this doesn't hurt any of his feelings
[1:58:25] but the reason that we're not got satan
[1:58:28] in a powerless position
[1:58:30] is we haven't dug all the tin cans
[1:58:34] and all of the garbage out of our
[1:58:36] foundation yet
[1:58:38] we tried to build the house
[1:58:42] before we had the foundation solidify
[1:58:50] you know those of you know anything
[1:58:53] about construction
[1:58:55] there are always constantly trying to
[1:58:58] reinvent the house
[1:59:01] i just watched a video this company's
[1:59:03] actually
[1:59:04] persevered to be successful in their
[1:59:06] concept
[1:59:08] and that is while they've got a crew
[1:59:11] over here
[1:59:12] framing the floor
[1:59:16] they've got a crew already framing walls
[1:59:19] they've got a crew over here framing the
[1:59:22] roof
[1:59:23] and they've got their little process
[1:59:27] by which they tie all the trusses
[1:59:29] together sheet it
[1:59:30] even the fascia board on it they have
[1:59:32] these huge brackets
[1:59:34] they have a design where they leave
[1:59:36] several sheets out they reach down in
[1:59:37] there
[1:59:38] put these uh almost like forklift forks
[1:59:40] under it lift the roof up and set it on
[1:59:42] the house
[1:59:43] shortens the building of the house
[1:59:44] considerably hardly anyone has to really
[1:59:47] get up on the roof and
[1:59:48] do that really cool isn't it
[1:59:51] except for the very first house they did
[1:59:53] that way they lifted the roof on
[1:59:55] and it didn't fit
[2:00:00] we have a problem
[2:00:04] i mean most of you would like to be able
[2:00:05] to go in your bedroom and just reach out
[2:00:07] and see how cold it is
[2:00:12] see my brother and sister that why that
[2:00:13] way that's why god's got this
[2:00:15] process that he he's building and he
[2:00:18] said what i need you to do is i need you
[2:00:19] to
[2:00:20] take the action to dig and dig
[2:00:25] and dig and i'm tired of digging
[2:00:30] dig come on i'm digging
[2:00:37] prophet said sometimes he's not building
[2:00:40] a wall
[2:00:40] he's building a house so we come we've
[2:00:43] got to make the corner
[2:00:45] and dig and dig
[2:00:51] for time i'll mine my own business here
[2:00:58] they get a revelation
[2:01:01] see it's not persuasion
[2:01:04] it's not teaching that there's two
[2:01:07] spirits in the framework
[2:01:09] of this church
[2:01:12] it's a revelation
[2:01:17] then my brother and sister they can
[2:01:20] start withstanding
[2:01:23] it's only after you have it all in place
[2:01:25] that you can start to withstand
[2:01:27] you see this is why we have people who
[2:01:29] have actually literally i've got friends
[2:01:31] it breaks my heart i've got friends
[2:01:33] they gave 30 years of their life
[2:01:35] following the message
[2:01:38] and got up one day and walked away
[2:01:42] you see they run into the perfect storm
[2:01:44] go back study the scriptures
[2:01:46] when the rains fell
[2:01:50] this house never fell because it was
[2:01:52] built on the rock
[2:01:54] this house right here from the very
[2:01:55] beginning of the storm it started to
[2:01:57] wash under the foundation
[2:01:59] and then that storm was over but the
[2:02:01] foundation was never done right so it
[2:02:03] never changed another storm comes and
[2:02:05] washes a little more
[2:02:07] but this foundation that you were
[2:02:10] anointed
[2:02:11] to dig can you say amen to that
[2:02:14] i was anointed it wasn't me i i didn't
[2:02:17] have the energy i didn't have the
[2:02:18] ability
[2:02:19] i didn't have the understanding i was
[2:02:20] anointed to just keep digging
[2:02:23] until i got to the place that i realized
[2:02:26] this is what it's all about here's the
[2:02:30] rock
[2:02:31] oh we could say look i built my house on
[2:02:34] the rock
[2:02:34] but my brother and sister without the
[2:02:36] holy ghost anointing you
[2:02:37] you would have never persevered to dig
[2:02:40] that deep
[2:02:43] some people are like you believe god
[2:02:44] sent a prophet oh that's ridiculous
[2:02:47] you know what they did they took one
[2:02:48] shovel full of sand
[2:02:50] threw it away and built a house
[2:02:54] they didn't persevere to dig or they
[2:02:56] would figure it out
[2:02:59] okay let me hurry on i'm starting to get
[2:03:01] hungry
[2:03:04] amen when this happens see satan will be
[2:03:06] powerless before you'll be definitely
[2:03:08] thwarted today is when christ
[2:03:09] withstood his every effort to gain power
[2:03:11] over him in the desert yes
[2:03:13] satan hates revelation oh hallelujah can
[2:03:17] somebody agree with those next words
[2:03:19] but we love it with true revelation in
[2:03:22] our lives the gates of hell cannot
[2:03:24] prevail against us
[2:03:25] but we will prevail over them amen
[2:03:29] it's not our understanding it's not our
[2:03:31] intellect
[2:03:32] it's because we have followed the word
[2:03:35] and what the word said do
[2:03:36] we did it and when satan comes in like a
[2:03:39] storm
[2:03:40] i love that it's sad brother trevor's
[2:03:41] not here this morning brother trevor

[2:04:08] but god raises up his standard
[2:04:13] and then he went right back in that
[2:04:14] voice and then the devil comes right
[2:04:17] back
[2:04:17] in but god raises up his standard
[2:04:23] but then the devil comes right back in

[2:04:30] more into this than you did i'm telling
[2:04:33] you and he repeated that about five
[2:04:35] times you know
[2:04:37] the devil comes but god raised up
[2:04:39] standard
[2:04:40] amen it don't matter my brother or
[2:04:42] sister how many times the devil comes
[2:04:43] the standard is still being raised and
[2:04:46] you are the standard
[2:04:47] the word in you is the standard
[2:04:50] of this age
[2:04:56] well praise the lord it's in the bible
[2:04:57] they don't need you well i'm sorry it's
[2:04:59] just written words if it's in the bible
[2:05:01] but our bible is a living bible

[2:05:05] to have someone to live in
[2:05:07] it's living in you and i today oh
[2:05:10] hallelujah
[2:05:12] with true revelation in our lives the
[2:05:14] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[2:05:16] but we will prevail over them
[2:05:18] now look i'm getting really close here
[2:05:19] to quitting sister emmy will you come
[2:05:21] you'll recall that i mentioned at the
[2:05:23] beginning of this message that the book
[2:05:25] we are studying is the
[2:05:26] actual revelation of jesus
[2:05:29] himself in the church and his work
[2:05:34] in the future ages my brother and sister
[2:05:37] we are the future ages
[2:05:39] you realize my brother and sister that
[2:05:41] this word has been stored up
[2:05:43] and the doors of the storehouse have
[2:05:45] been unlocked
[2:05:46] amen it is not some time in the future
[2:05:49] that we're going to access
[2:05:50] this storehouse some people act like
[2:05:52] whoa no we got to keep this for another
[2:05:54] day
[2:05:54] my brother and sister eat to your hearts
[2:05:56] content don't stop until you are
[2:05:58] satisfied
[2:05:59] because he said that he would quench
[2:06:01] your hunger he would satisfy you
[2:06:04] he said he would do this for you and i
[2:06:06] and you take a hold of that word
[2:06:08] and you just keep eating on it keep
[2:06:10] eating on it keep eating on it and i
[2:06:12] don't care how you feel
[2:06:15] i don't care how you feel i don't feel
[2:06:18] like praying
[2:06:19] pray anyhow i don't feel like reading my
[2:06:23] bible
[2:06:23] read it anyhow i don't feel like going
[2:06:26] to church
[2:06:27] go to church anyhow
[2:06:34] oh hallelujah excuse me for getting
[2:06:37] excited today
[2:06:40] then i mentioned oh this is the future
[2:06:43] age
[2:06:45] sure oh my brother and sister this is a
[2:06:46] future age
[2:06:49] then i mentioned that it takes the holy
[2:06:51] spirit to give us revelation or we will
[2:06:53] fail to get it
[2:06:58] come on i've said some direct things
[2:06:59] today i'll try and finish on this one
[2:07:03] that's why we have people right around
[2:07:06] our belief system
[2:07:09] have no revelation that's
[2:07:13] not my word saints
[2:07:17] it takes the holy spirit to give us
[2:07:20] revelation
[2:07:22] or we'll fail to get it intellectualism
[2:07:27] [Music]
[2:07:29] i met a brother one time pardon me for
[2:07:32] sharing this but i just want to drive it
[2:07:33] home to you
[2:07:34] i met her brother one time me dumb as a
[2:07:38] rock
[2:07:41] i'm not tearing myself down i'm just i'm
[2:07:43] just some average old guy
[2:07:45] maybe a notch or two below average
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:50] i mean i passed most of my classes in
[2:07:52] high school if you want to understand i
[2:07:54] passed him you can still pass with a
[2:07:55] d-minus
[2:07:56] [Music]
[2:08:01] and you start to speak quote
[2:08:07] this man would just gone of this ebill
[2:08:10] age page 22 paragraph 351
[2:08:14] i'm like okay
[2:08:22] but don't you dare disagree with that
[2:08:24] man
[2:08:27] don't you dare disagree with a man
[2:08:30] or he just rip you up
[2:08:34] i'll tell you what saints i'd rather be
[2:08:37] as dumb as a rock
[2:08:39] and god in control of my life be so
[2:08:43] intellectual that i can tell you this
[2:08:45] that and the other
[2:08:48] and not have his spirit amen
[2:08:51] it's not about what we know it's about
[2:08:53] knowing him
[2:08:55] it's all about that relationship and i
[2:08:57] mentioned it takes the holy spirit to
[2:08:59] give us revelation or we will fail to
[2:09:01] get it
[2:09:02] bringing these two thoughts together you
[2:09:04] will see that it won't take just
[2:09:05] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[2:09:06] book real
[2:09:07] it's going to take an operation of the
[2:09:09] holy ghost
[2:09:10] could somebody lift a hand and say lord
[2:09:12] come and operate in our midst
[2:09:14] come today lord and operate in our life
[2:09:16] in our midst lord change us
[2:09:19] change us lord mold this into your image
[2:09:22] father
[2:09:25] now some people would say this is
[2:09:26] arrogant in fact i could get you the
[2:09:27] quotation it's right on
[2:09:29] on a recording where a man says that
[2:09:31] we're just arrogant
[2:09:34] means this book can't be revealed to
[2:09:36] anyone but a special class of people
[2:09:39] i never drew the lines on that that's
[2:09:41] right
[2:09:42] come on saints don't go drawing the
[2:09:44] lines
[2:09:46] don't go saying i think they're out and
[2:09:48] you're in
[2:09:50] no sir don't draw the lines just
[2:09:52] recognize the fact that you can believe
[2:09:55] and this word is real to you and you
[2:09:57] hunger after this word
[2:09:59] that this word stimulates you and you
[2:10:02] read
[2:10:02] something and you get excited i tell you
[2:10:05] there's many a time not to sound
[2:10:06] boastful
[2:10:07] but my wife will come busting out there
[2:10:09] paul you've got to read this
[2:10:10] and there'll be days i know she'll be
[2:10:12] listening a certain sermon i know
[2:10:14] because my phone all day long goes ding
[2:10:16] ding ding ding ding quotes out of that
[2:10:18] message
[2:10:19] what is it stimulation she's not doing
[2:10:23] it to prove some point she's like look
[2:10:25] look look what it says praise the lord
[2:10:28] look at this oh
[2:10:32] i want to live in that kind of
[2:10:33] inspiration she does that partly because
[2:10:36] she knows i'm out there with my lip
[2:10:37] hanging down because i preached
[2:10:40] yesterday
[2:10:45] this ought to encourage you this ought
[2:10:47] to encourage you pretty soon please
[2:10:49] don't send me any more text
[2:10:51] my phone's going ding ding ding and the
[2:10:53] battery's almost dead
[2:10:57] it's going to take operation of the holy
[2:10:59] ghost i mean this book can't be revealed
[2:11:01] to anyone
[2:11:03] but a special class of people
[2:11:06] hallelujah i thank the lord today we can
[2:11:08] claim to be a special class of people
[2:11:11] amen we were designed we were built
[2:11:14] we were our operating system was
[2:11:16] programmed in such a fashion
[2:11:18] that when we hear the word the word in
[2:11:21] you
[2:11:22] says hallelujah that's a part of me
[2:11:26] i'm a part of it praise the lord
[2:11:29] it will take one with prophetic insight
[2:11:31] it require the ability
[2:11:33] to hear from god wait everybody in
[2:11:37] christendom hears from god don't they
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:41] it will require supernatural instruction
[2:11:43] not just a student comparing verse
[2:11:45] with verse though that is good
[2:11:53] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[2:11:56] the spirit
[2:11:57] or it never becomes clear how
[2:12:00] we need to hear from god and lay
[2:12:03] ourselves hope
[2:12:04] we're back to another action look at
[2:12:07] this god's put another
[2:12:08] quantifier here another quantifier
[2:12:11] saints
[2:12:12] we need to hear from god and we need to
[2:12:15] lay ourselves
[2:12:16] open and become yielded to the
[2:12:19] spirit to hear and know amen
[2:12:23] oh hallelujah you say brother paul
[2:12:26] that's what we're doing
[2:12:27] that's right i was just here to stir up
[2:12:28] your pure minds today

[2:12:33] good
[2:12:34] but don't you love it i didn't i don't
[2:12:35] think i hit any of you with my stir
[2:12:37] stick did i
[2:12:40] come on
[2:12:43] it's not many how many quotes you know
[2:12:46] it's not what continent you live on
[2:12:49] it's whether or not you know him it is
[2:12:52] right
[2:12:53] and if you know him you can live in
[2:12:54] poverty or you can live in riches
[2:12:57] and it won't matter if you know him
[2:13:01] you'll never find yourself with an
[2:13:02] arrogant spirit
[2:13:04] but you're reminded daily that i
[2:13:08] am nothing without christ hallelujah

[2:13:54] lord
[2:13:56] amen that's the unity my brother and
[2:13:58] sister that some people are trying to do
[2:14:00] by gathering together and having single
[2:14:03] thought longs and sing-a-thons and
[2:14:05] and do all these things that we because
[2:14:06] we need to have unity but the prophet of
[2:14:08] god said that the
[2:14:09] unity is in the word of god so i
[2:14:12] say we are here today in the spirit of
[2:14:14] unity because i believe we're here today
[2:14:17] in the word of god where we're desiring
[2:14:19] the word we want the word give me the
[2:14:21] word all i want is the word

[2:14:43] devil's going to come along my brother
[2:14:44] and sister
[2:14:45] and we can say you know where is this in
[2:14:47] the church and where is this in the
[2:14:49] church and what's happening over here
