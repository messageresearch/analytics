[41:31] think he skipped my household
[41:33] but it's good to see it in the body of
[41:36] believers amen to enjoy that
[41:39] we want to talk this morning we're going
[41:41] to just pull
[41:42] a little farther into our thought this
[41:45] title
[41:46] steadfast in the faith realizing my
[41:49] brother and sister that we've been given
[41:51] something very very special that we
[41:54] are able as sons and daughters of god
[41:59] wouldn't it be wonderful if every day
[42:00] was just a beautiful day with no worries
[42:06] but it's not so that's right and yet
[42:09] in all that satan can do
[42:12] we've been anointed with the spirit i
[42:14] want you to understand it's not
[42:16] us we would have given up
[42:20] let me change that we have given up
[42:24] but god has anointed us with a spirit
[42:28] that has kept us steadfast in the faith
[42:32] it was not us it was him
[42:35] it will always be him and we have to
[42:37] recognize
[42:39] that the strength and the courage that
[42:40] we have to stand in the day that we
[42:43] stand
[42:44] is christ in you the hope of glory
[42:47] this the prophet of god said god's
[42:50] desire
[42:51] is to manifest himself in you
[42:55] oh hallelujah just that god would come
[42:58] down
[42:59] and just strengthen us and we realize
[43:02] it's him the same power
[43:06] that led him to the cross amen
[43:09] is in you oh my how beautiful
[43:14] let's just start uh first peter
[43:17] 5 1 and this
[43:21] scripture i i could have cut it off and
[43:24] just taken the
[43:25] portion out of it that i wanted but i
[43:27] just felt led to start in verse one
[43:30] because you see maybe i'm a product of
[43:32] the environment i was raised in
[43:34] but i believe it's very important saints
[43:37] that
[43:38] let me just put it in this context we
[43:40] understand the plan of god the
[43:42] leadership of god and and his program
[43:45] how he put it together
[43:47] that we understand that to realize that
[43:49] god has put
[43:50] men in authority but to realize as we'll
[43:53] go into the scripture
[43:55] that the reason that he put that men in
[43:58] authority he chose the men i tell you
[44:00] from my heart
[44:01] if it was just in the man realm i would
[44:03] not be standing here
[44:06] but we do that but god puts
[44:09] this lovely balance oh brother george
[44:13] thank you even if our natural pulpit
[44:16] needs to lean this way a little bit
[44:19] amen thank you lord for balance
[44:22] in our lives because without that
[44:25] balance we would go off in an
[44:27] is or a tangent we would go off in a way
[44:30] we would come to a place that would
[44:31] derail us
[44:33] but god puts balance in the body
[44:36] and we'll we'll touch on that amen i'll
[44:38] try not preach my sermon while you're
[44:39] standing
[44:40] amen first peter 5 1 elders
[44:44] which are among you i exhort who am
[44:47] also an elder and a witness of the
[44:50] sufferings of christ and also a partaker
[44:52] of the glory
[44:54] that shall be revealed feed the flock of
[44:57] god which is among you
[44:59] taking oversight thereof not by
[45:01] constraint
[45:02] but willingly not for filthy lucr
[45:05] but of a ready mind neither as being
[45:09] lords
[45:09] over god's heritage but being in samples
[45:12] to the flock and all i can say is lord
[45:14] help me
[45:16] and when the chief shepherd shall appear
[45:18] ye shall receive a clown
[45:20] of glory that fadeth not away likewise
[45:23] ye younger submit yourselves unto the
[45:26] elder
[45:27] yay see i love balance yea all of you
[45:31] be subject one to another and be clothed
[45:34] with humility
[45:35] for god resisteth the proud and giveth
[45:38] grace
[45:39] to the humble humble yourselves
[45:41] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[45:44] that he may exalt you in due time
[45:48] casting all your care upon him
[45:52] for he careth for you can we say amen
[45:56] be sober be vigilant because your
[45:58] adversary the devil
[46:00] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[46:03] whom
[46:03] he may devour whom resists steadfast
[46:08] in the faith knowing that the same
[46:10] afflictions are accomplished in your
[46:12] brethren
[46:12] that are in the world but the god of all
[46:16] grace
[46:16] who hath called us see i love my brother
[46:19] and sister
[46:20] when the word remind us we didn't just
[46:23] show up
[46:24] we didn't just decide i'm going to be a
[46:26] believer
[46:27] we didn't decide i'm going to this i'm
[46:29] going to that
[46:30] god called and that calling is so strong
[46:34] now let me just interject this in the
[46:36] tree by god's grace we
[46:38] will just try to invite to have a
[46:41] housewarming something
[46:43] uh share the blessing that god has given
[46:46] us and
[46:47] the house that we just moved into
[46:49] there's a giant tree there
[46:50] and there is a tremendous size
[46:53] red-tailed hawk there
[46:55] and and uh you can tell this
[46:58] hawk says this is my kingdom
[47:02] and when other birds come around other
[47:04] smaller hawks and whatever
[47:06] he gets up above there and circles
[47:08] around over that tree
[47:09] and this is just a hawk this is not even
[47:11] an eagle
[47:13] he circles around over that tree and he
[47:15] has a cry
[47:16] a scream
[47:19] and you can hear it afar off
[47:25] what is it that's in you and i
[47:29] that we respond to this call
[47:33] of this age
[47:37] you have to be an eagle to understand
[47:41] the eagle you have to be a sheep
[47:46] to understand the shepherd
[47:50] what a blessing it is this is not a
[47:52] foreign call to us this is not
[47:54] something that is confusion or clutter
[47:57] it is not something that falls upon deaf
[47:59] ears but
[48:00] it is something that we uh in a
[48:03] within us just say yes i
[48:06] understand that that's me
[48:09] when he said i'd call those in the last
[48:11] day that would respond to my word
[48:14] where one stands up and says i heard it
[48:17] thank you lord i heard that call oh how
[48:20] beautiful it is saints it stirs my heart
[48:24] but the god of all grace who hath called
[48:26] us unto his
[48:27] eternal glory by christ jesus after that
[48:30] you have suffered
[48:31] a while this scripture right here just
[48:34] lays it all out
[48:36] after that you have suffered a while
[48:38] make you perfect
[48:39] establish strengthen and settle you
[48:43] to him be glory in dominion forever and
[48:45] ever
[48:46] amen lord we just ask for your blessings
[48:49] upon the word of god today
[48:51] touch the hearts of your saints father
[48:52] set me aside lord speak
[48:54] we ask in the name of jesus christ amen
[48:58] you may be seated saints
[49:04] as we look at this i just want to come
[49:07] down through these scriptures
[49:08] for just a minute and just to touch upon
[49:11] some things that stirred my heart
[49:13] as we were studying you know as we look
[49:16] at these
[49:16] first four verses we'll see that they're
[49:19] very much
[49:20] uh pointed towards giving an insight to
[49:23] the ministry's responsibility and reward
[49:26] and
[49:26] you know as we look at this it is not
[49:28] for the ministry to stand up and say
[49:31] look how important i
[49:32] am but i trust that through the years
[49:34] it's been my heart's desire and if i
[49:36] have failed forgive me
[49:38] but you see the ministry is called to be
[49:40] a servant to the people
[49:42] now that's not necessarily the guy who
[49:43] runs around and grabs your dessert for
[49:46] you
[49:46] and and does all these little things but
[49:48] simply that he subjects himself to the
[49:51] holy spirit
[49:52] for the benefit of the people it is not
[49:54] there to raise him up of
[49:56] making him a great man but would be that
[49:59] god by his grace and mercy would allow
[50:01] that man to then be
[50:03] as brother branham speaks he talks about
[50:05] oral roberts and how that they
[50:07] would be on the radio or television and
[50:09] say you know oral roberts was
[50:10] very known for this uh you know reach
[50:12] out touch your radio touch your
[50:14] television
[50:15] as a point of contact well that's really
[50:17] all that a minister a pastor is
[50:20] is just a point of contact that would be
[50:22] a place that
[50:23] we could receive and you know imagine
[50:25] saints that you know i don't know if
[50:27] you're like me then there's certain
[50:28] little weaknesses things of the flesh
[50:30] little afflictions and
[50:32] satan you know he pretty much has it
[50:33] dialed in to keep shooting the flaming
[50:35] arrow
[50:36] at your weakness and so what we don't
[50:39] want is to have
[50:40] it where we get to control the dial of
[50:42] what we hear
[50:43] because if not we would never listen to
[50:46] those things that struck us deep in our
[50:48] own weakness
[50:49] but it's by god's grace that we have
[50:52] another channel that i would say is the
[50:55] holy spirit
[50:56] and it comes down and speaks to our
[50:58] needs
[50:59] beyond our control hallelujah and i
[51:02] can't tell you how many times i'm here
[51:04] ministering and i
[51:05] speak something and the afterthought is
[51:08] oh lord
[51:08] that's me you see so we're not exempt
[51:12] from that but by god's grace we have a
[51:14] channel by which
[51:15] it comes and and god gets to deal with
[51:17] us and i believe you would say amen to
[51:19] that
[51:20] i know sitting on the pew myself that
[51:23] you hear things preached and you're like
[51:24] oh
[51:25] my lord i needed to hear that amen
[51:29] so as we look at this we see these first
[51:31] four verses uh
[51:32] you know kind of uh giving a direction
[51:35] or insight to the ministry is
[51:36] responsible
[51:37] and responsibility you know uh just to
[51:40] touch on that
[51:41] um you know the job feed the flock
[51:44] not control the flock not meddle with
[51:47] the flock
[51:48] but to feed the flock because verse 3
[51:51] says we're not supposed to be a lord
[51:53] over
[51:53] god's heritage and as long as we
[51:56] remember that it's god's heritage and
[51:58] not ours
[51:58] that makes that job you might say fairly
[52:00] simple but you look at this
[52:02] now that when the chief shepherd now you
[52:05] know we all
[52:06] uh would work you might say for someone
[52:09] when i say well i'm self-employed but
[52:10] you're still working for someone
[52:12] and we are here under the chief shepherd
[52:15] so as
[52:16] when the chief shepherd shall appear
[52:18] that is the whole goal what would a man
[52:20] labor his whole life to be judged
[52:22] unworthy
[52:24] of the gospel my brother and sister we
[52:26] want to labor
[52:27] that we would come and receive a crown
[52:29] of glory
[52:30] that fadeth not away so we we look at
[52:33] this and realize how that
[52:35] these things uh touch upon our life uh
[52:38] because
[52:39] now i'm this is not my subject today but
[52:41] it's just part of these scriptures felt
[52:42] led to
[52:43] do that my brother and sister the
[52:45] prophet of god now this will scare you
[52:47] brother adam i i just had to laugh and
[52:49] laugh and laugh about that because
[52:51] they visited a church on their vacation
[52:53] and he's like brother paul would like it
[52:55] here
[52:56] and uh then as the people's behavior he
[52:58] says i bet we'll see what the
[53:00] the minister's like the prophet of god
[53:02] made that statement he says you know
[53:03] that the people
[53:04] will take on if they're not careful the
[53:06] spirit of the pastor
[53:08] well unto you saints woe unto you
[53:12] you take on the spirit of christ amen
[53:16] don't take on the spirit of the pastor
[53:18] because you're going to be in trouble
[53:22] because you see i'm that guy when the
[53:23] prophet of god says you need to repent
[53:25] every day
[53:26] i'm that guy amen
[53:29] so you look at that and realize that the
[53:32] influence that there is
[53:34] there there is a realm of influence and
[53:37] we want that influence to be the holy
[53:38] ghost
[53:39] we don't want it to be a man influence
[53:41] and we don't want it to be a man's
[53:42] direction but we want it to be the mind
[53:44] of god
[53:45] expressed through the word to us now
[53:47] brother branham says here in the
[53:49] uh message influence he said
[53:53] when a man or a woman no matter whether
[53:55] he's a bishop or a cardinal or whatever
[53:58] he might be
[53:59] when you begin to feel that you are
[54:01] self-reliant
[54:02] then you better begin to watch and take
[54:05] heed because god
[54:06] went won't let you go like that because
[54:09] he will not share his glory with anyone
[54:12] no sir god takes glory alone
[54:15] so i just put that in there as a context
[54:18] of where we stand amen those first four
[54:20] verses
[54:21] how there is authority there is
[54:23] direction one to take charge as it were
[54:26] but ultimately it comes down there's
[54:28] only one that receives the glory and we
[54:30] give that church to jesus christ today
[54:33] amen
[54:34] and him alone hallelujah now as we go on
[54:37] here i want to touch on verse 5
[54:39] we'll see my brother and sister that to
[54:41] him be glory in dominion
[54:43] uh uh forever and oh i'm on the wrong
[54:46] verse
[54:47] excuse me hallelujah
[54:50] likewise you're younger submit
[54:52] yourselves unto the elder yea
[54:54] all of you be subject one to another see
[54:56] look at the beautiful balance that is
[54:58] there that there is no great ones
[55:00] amongst us but
[55:01] we are submitting one to another and you
[55:04] know that means my brother and sister if
[55:06] i could just open this up for a minute
[55:08] that means we don't sit back and just
[55:10] witness the issues and the state of life
[55:12] for those around us
[55:13] but we enter into that because we're
[55:15] submitting to them
[55:17] so if one has a trouble we all have a
[55:19] trouble
[55:20] one has a blessing we all have a
[55:22] blessing amen we don't want to amen now
[55:24] i tell you saints this is hard
[55:26] because we as humans have a human nature
[55:28] to deal with
[55:30] and oftentimes we'll internalize our
[55:33] problems
[55:33] in other words i want to kind of spank
[55:36] you church
[55:37] that we will talk in the foyer of
[55:39] afflictions and troubles and
[55:40] circumstances
[55:41] and there will not be a prayer request
[55:43] touch this pulpit
[55:46] why will we not submit one to another
[55:50] and say this
[55:50] is my body this is my family this
[55:54] is the word of god made manifest amongst
[55:56] a group of people
[55:57] but we won't even share our needs
[56:00] but we'll talk about our afflictions did
[56:04] you catch that
[56:05] amen we won't share the need that i have
[56:08] a need of prayer
[56:09] i have a need for work i have a need for
[56:11] this i have a need for family uh
[56:13] for marriage situations i have needs for
[56:15] all these things
[56:16] but we won't share that we won't ask the
[56:19] body
[56:20] to pray for that but we'll stand in the
[56:22] foyer and tell one another our problems
[56:24] that ought not be sold if it's personal
[56:27] and you don't want to share it at least
[56:29] turn in
[56:30] i have an unspoken request and let the
[56:32] body of christ then start lifting
[56:34] that need up we weren't meant to go this
[56:38] alone
[56:40] are you familiar with shrek
[56:45] shrek is a sheep that got lost from the
[56:47] flock
[56:49] and was found living in the wilderness
[56:53] shrek survived the wolf the cougar
[56:56] the coyote the winter
[56:59] and everything but shrek
[57:03] being a good sheep had grown so much
[57:05] wool
[57:06] that it had become almost impossible for
[57:09] shrek
[57:10] to put his face to the ground to eat and
[57:13] to drink
[57:15] i'm such a good christian i'm such a
[57:17] good christian i'm such a good christian
[57:19] shrek was not meant shrek was meant to
[57:22] go with the rest of the flock
[57:24] and be sheared every once in a while
[57:26] shrek was meant to go
[57:28] and feed amongst the other sheep to have
[57:31] care
[57:32] but when shrek got lost for whatever
[57:34] reason
[57:36] shrek didn't just dry up and blow away
[57:39] but the shepherd or the those that found
[57:41] shrek says you know what
[57:43] we don't believe he would have survived
[57:45] much longer he was carrying such a
[57:47] burden
[57:53] shrek could not lay down because shrek
[57:55] could not get back up
[57:57] shrek stood 24 hours a day
[58:03] yay though i walk
[58:06] through the valley of the shadow of
[58:09] death
[58:10] i will fear no evil i've been led
[58:14] to the still waters i've been led
[58:17] to the green pastures says nothing about
[58:20] leading yourself
[58:26] we're not called as christians to stand
[58:28] alone and say i can do this on my own i
[58:30] can do this on my own
[58:32] we're called to be part of a body
[58:34] hallelujah
[58:36] do you know that sharing your burdens is
[58:39] not a weakness
[58:40] it's actually a strength
[58:45] the weak internalize it the strong
[58:49] confess it because the word says confess
[58:52] your faults
[58:54] false doesn't mean your mistakes
[58:58] false actually interprets out into your
[59:02] weakness
[59:04] to one another i ain't doing that
[59:07] they're going to judge me
[59:08] well you get judged now you get judged
[59:09] later
[59:11] you get judged for not wanting to be
[59:12] judged
[59:14] turns out you're actually judging when
[59:17] you say i don't want to be judged
[59:18] because you're judging them not worthy
[59:20] to hear
[59:20] your case gets complicated doesn't it
[59:25] lord help us this is what is called
[59:28] unity in the body saints when we stand
[59:30] together
[59:31] hallelujah oh my how did we get on that
[59:35] subject
[59:41] yeah we subject one to another and be
[59:45] clothed with humility
[59:47] for god resisteth the proud and giveth
[59:50] grace to the humble humble yourselves
[59:51] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[59:54] you see my brother and sister if we're
[59:56] not careful we actually can get an
[59:58] arrogant spirit you say how can that be
[1:00:01] brother paul how can that be an arrogant
[1:00:03] spirit
[1:00:03] because we judge god not worthy to
[1:00:06] handle
[1:00:07] our problem when we don't take our needs
[1:00:10] to the lord we're judging him
[1:00:12] unworthy or unable to deal with
[1:00:16] our situation i will deal with my
[1:00:19] situation because i don't think god is
[1:00:21] capable
[1:00:22] you say that isn't my mentality my
[1:00:24] brother paul but that is your action
[1:00:27] we're meant my brother and sister
[1:00:32] we're meant to be part of a body
[1:00:36] we're meant to be submitted to the lord
[1:00:40] amen you know as you look at this i like
[1:00:43] this verse here
[1:00:45] that uh humble yourselves therefore unto
[1:00:47] the mighty hand of god so
[1:00:49] so you look at this when we recognize
[1:00:51] the great
[1:00:52] supreme being of god and his ability
[1:00:55] amen
[1:00:56] we just submit to that and then
[1:01:00] he exalts you in due time you know
[1:01:03] saints there's been times in my life
[1:01:05] i'll just use myself for an example so
[1:01:06] that i don't have to
[1:01:08] trying to break this habit of pointing
[1:01:10] out people
[1:01:13] then i thought that god owed me an
[1:01:14] answer
[1:01:16] now
[1:01:21] i need an answer by friday lord
[1:01:24] friday comes you have no answer
[1:01:31] did we ever recognize the fact that the
[1:01:33] scriptures taught us
[1:01:36] to cast our burden
[1:01:39] to the lord
[1:01:44] well i didn't get an answer from the
[1:01:45] lord so i'm just going to do what i
[1:01:46] think is right
[1:01:48] you didn't cast the burden off
[1:01:52] you've held onto the burden saying lord
[1:01:54] give me an answer while i hold on to the
[1:01:56] problem
[1:01:58] cast the burden i won't even this is
[1:02:01] something i haven't even
[1:02:02] my wife doesn't even know it was just a
[1:02:03] course of a natural thing of business
[1:02:05] and
[1:02:06] etc but you know you have a situation
[1:02:09] you don't know what to do you don't know
[1:02:10] what to do you know what to do and i
[1:02:11] finally
[1:02:11] in almost exasperation to myself said
[1:02:14] lord i'm done
[1:02:15] i don't care whether it turns out good
[1:02:17] bad and different i'm just done i can't
[1:02:19] deal with it
[1:02:20] and you know when friday come my phone
[1:02:22] rings and the person says i've changed
[1:02:23] my mind i'm not doing this
[1:02:27] there was my answer
[1:02:31] i didn't have to put myself in a bad
[1:02:35] situation
[1:02:36] they themselves says this is not good
[1:02:38] i'm sorry i offered this to you
[1:02:40] i retract the offer some might say well
[1:02:43] that was bad no it was good it was an
[1:02:45] answer to prayer lord do i or do i not
[1:02:47] and the prophet of god said if you have
[1:02:49] a question don't
[1:02:52] not if you have a question just press
[1:02:54] forward till you get an answer
[1:02:57] he says if you have a question don't
[1:03:00] let the lord be in control if it's meant
[1:03:03] to happen it will happen
[1:03:05] now i'm not talking about whether you go
[1:03:07] down the road and say should i put gas
[1:03:09] in the car or not it's going ding ding
[1:03:11] ding and the lights on
[1:03:12] we're not talking about those kind of
[1:03:14] things we're talking about those events
[1:03:16] of our life
[1:03:17] that we recognize make a major
[1:03:20] difference
[1:03:20] in our life do we really cast them to
[1:03:24] the lord
[1:03:26] you know it's kind of funny i i just
[1:03:28] read this little article the guy was
[1:03:29] being
[1:03:30] humorous he said you know he said when
[1:03:33] we
[1:03:34] go fishing he said it it's a lot
[1:03:37] like the christian experience we're
[1:03:40] offering
[1:03:40] something but there's a string attached
[1:03:47] lord i give you my life i want to serve
[1:03:50] you i'm going to give myself into your
[1:03:52] complete control but there is a string
[1:03:53] attached
[1:03:56] that if i don't like your answer i spoke
[1:03:59] to the the children
[1:04:00] and and grace kids the other night amen
[1:04:03] i'll just share this with the parents so
[1:04:05] if the kids didn't come home and share
[1:04:06] it with you
[1:04:08] we were talking about honoring hebrews 6
[1:04:10] i mean not hebrews 6 ephesians 6
[1:04:13] talking about honoring your parents and
[1:04:15] i was speaking to the kids to the
[1:04:16] children
[1:04:17] that when you ask mom and mom says no
[1:04:22] and you go to dad and say hey dad
[1:04:27] can i and you get a different answer
[1:04:29] you're just honoring your parents
[1:04:32] because when parents are married husband
[1:04:34] and wife the scripture says they're now
[1:04:36] one
[1:04:37] and we were just speaking to the
[1:04:39] children about no means no if mom said
[1:04:41] no
[1:04:42] then you ought to spank your kid for
[1:04:44] asking dad
[1:04:45] now this is let me let me get back up
[1:04:47] some of you don't believe in spanking
[1:04:49] so let me just back up you you should
[1:04:52] punish
[1:04:52] your child in some form or fashion you
[1:04:55] can ground him like electricity
[1:04:56] you can put a hat and shove him in the
[1:04:58] corner whatever your method is
[1:05:02] but if your kid asks mom and gets a no
[1:05:04] and goes and asks dad and gets a yes the
[1:05:06] parents ought to look at each other and
[1:05:08] say we stand together and they ought to
[1:05:09] punish that child
[1:05:11] because they're dishonoring
[1:05:12] disrespecting because they've now tried
[1:05:14] to separate
[1:05:15] mom and dad from being one back into two
[1:05:18] again with different opinions
[1:05:25] all those who kids are grown up or don't
[1:05:27] have kids are like amen and all those
[1:05:29] who have kids are like well
[1:05:34] but you see there comes a time we we've
[1:05:37] got to set a boundary
[1:05:38] and a no from mom ought to be as good
[1:05:42] as a no from dad and the prophet of god
[1:05:44] teaches
[1:05:45] us a no from god ought to be just as
[1:05:48] good to a son or daughter of god
[1:05:50] as yes is because what happens when we
[1:05:54] set a culture where no is not good
[1:05:56] enough
[1:05:57] our child will then go and we'll just
[1:05:59] take it this way our child will go from
[1:06:01] mom
[1:06:01] seek an answer from dad and when they
[1:06:03] don't like the answer from dad
[1:06:05] and as they're growing up remember these
[1:06:06] are all potential teenagers
[1:06:09] and you're training them their teenage
[1:06:11] behavior is
[1:06:12] actually settled when they're this tall
[1:06:15] and so when they don't like mom's answer
[1:06:17] they go to dad they don't like
[1:06:19] dad's answer they go and they'll find a
[1:06:21] boy or a girl that will tell them the
[1:06:23] answer they want
[1:06:25] and then that boy or girl will have more
[1:06:26] authority in their life than the parents
[1:06:28] will
[1:06:29] just look in the world around us i'm
[1:06:31] speaking from experience from witnessing
[1:06:33] to see these things we need to come to
[1:06:35] the place now what happens is why are
[1:06:37] you bringing this out brother paul
[1:06:38] because when god tells us yes then we
[1:06:41] should stand on that yes
[1:06:43] and let no one convince us of no and
[1:06:45] when god says no don't let anyone come
[1:06:48] and say god's answer should have been
[1:06:49] yes
[1:06:50] amen we ought to stand on the word of
[1:06:53] god and the
[1:06:54] no is no that's what we were teaching
[1:06:56] the kids the other night
[1:06:57] no means no it shouldn't matter which
[1:07:01] parent it comes from
[1:07:02] amen and now if i'm meddling in your
[1:07:04] families plea forgive me
[1:07:06] but we need to teach our children that
[1:07:08] mom and dad are not two with different
[1:07:10] opinions mom and dad
[1:07:11] are one and that when you have the
[1:07:13] answer yes then yes means yes and if you
[1:07:15] have the answer no
[1:07:16] no means no because otherwise we'll come
[1:07:19] and we'll constantly second guess
[1:07:21] god amen i don't like the no lord there
[1:07:24] must be another answer forgive me for
[1:07:28] meddling
[1:07:33] i feel so much better that's off my
[1:07:34] chest
[1:07:36] so if nobody's happy when we leave
[1:07:38] church today brother paul will be
[1:07:41] amen yeah
[1:07:44] yeah so you see we have to cast our care
[1:07:48] upon him before
[1:07:49] because he cares for us so we can't put
[1:07:52] a string to that care we just got to
[1:07:54] cast it
[1:07:55] you know you got to just toss that out
[1:07:57] there and say lord you're in control
[1:07:59] whatever is going to happen in the
[1:08:00] future lord i know that you have
[1:08:02] my best interest in mind
[1:08:05] problem is oftentimes we think god
[1:08:07] doesn't have our best interest in mind
[1:08:09] you say no
[1:08:10] i would never say that brother paul you
[1:08:11] wouldn't say it but your actions say it
[1:08:14] hallelujah amen now he tells us here to
[1:08:17] be sober
[1:08:18] to be vigilant because your adversary
[1:08:20] the devil
[1:08:21] as a roaring lion walketh bowel seeking
[1:08:23] whom he may devour
[1:08:25] we know that scripture do we not let's
[1:08:27] get get over here we know that scripture
[1:08:29] we've heard it we've heard it we've
[1:08:30] heard it we've heard it right
[1:08:31] satan's going around of who he can
[1:08:33] devour he's looking to devour
[1:08:35] be careful young people satan's gonna
[1:08:38] devour you
[1:08:40] be careful teenagers satan's gonna
[1:08:43] devour you i heard that a lot when i was
[1:08:45] a kid
[1:08:45] it was like the the stick you know that
[1:08:47] was like get back in line get back in
[1:08:49] line get back in line who's lying
[1:08:53] who's lying because i'm talking to sons
[1:08:56] and daughters of god
[1:08:57] amen we're not talking to those that are
[1:09:00] wavering tossed about with every wind of
[1:09:02] doctrine
[1:09:03] and unsteady in their thinking and
[1:09:05] unsteady in their lives we're talking to
[1:09:07] sons and daughters of god
[1:09:08] that have heard the call they know who
[1:09:10] they are and the next verse that we
[1:09:12] don't often hear
[1:09:13] uh uh uh uh read or connected to this
[1:09:18] amen let's speak this in continuity be
[1:09:20] sober be vigilant
[1:09:21] because your adversary the devil we know
[1:09:23] who the devil is amen we know he's our
[1:09:25] adversary as a roaring lion walkers
[1:09:27] about seeking whom he may devour
[1:09:30] whom who's he trying to devour those
[1:09:34] who resist steadfast in the faith
[1:09:38] now i didn't mean to set you up i mean
[1:09:40] it that way but we've already
[1:09:41] acknowledged we've already said amen
[1:09:42] we've already lifted a hand
[1:09:44] to know that it's god that's holding us
[1:09:46] steadfast in the faith
[1:09:48] it is not us in the flesh it is not our
[1:09:50] ability it's not our power
[1:09:52] amen so when we come my brother and
[1:09:54] sister have
[1:09:55] confidence that you will not be consumed
[1:09:58] by this roaring lion because you're
[1:10:01] gonna be one
[1:10:02] who stands steadfast lord your yes is
[1:10:04] good your no is good
[1:10:06] what you say lord everything about the
[1:10:08] whole picture
[1:10:09] i submit to that and i'm gonna give you
[1:10:11] my cares my problems
[1:10:13] i'll stand on this word lord and there
[1:10:15] it is the one he wants to devour
[1:10:18] he don't need to devour this one out
[1:10:19] here he don't need to devour this one
[1:10:21] out here he's already got him
[1:10:24] amen what he's seeking is you but i tell
[1:10:27] you you are identified right here in
[1:10:28] this scripture in the very next verse
[1:10:30] take the punctuation out take the
[1:10:32] numbers out it's one in continuity
[1:10:34] it comes down the one he wants is the
[1:10:37] one who's standing steadfast in the
[1:10:39] faith
[1:10:39] and he knows he can't have them he knows
[1:10:43] when it's all over
[1:10:44] that he won't get them but it won't stop
[1:10:47] him from trying
[1:10:48] he will try every way he'll make you
[1:10:51] rich he'll make you poor
[1:10:52] he'll make you healthy he'll make you
[1:10:53] sick he'll do whatever he can do
[1:10:56] but remember god gave and opened the
[1:10:58] hedge and gave
[1:10:59] satan that opportunity with job and job
[1:11:02] looked like he was sliding right out and
[1:11:04] failing
[1:11:04] but one day oh hallelujah one day god
[1:11:07] come down and said hey
[1:11:09] job where were you where were you when i
[1:11:13] hung the stars into heaven
[1:11:15] where were you when they sung for joy
[1:11:18] where were you
[1:11:19] job and job recognized oh i've always
[1:11:22] been in you
[1:11:23] i've not been in me i've been in you
[1:11:26] and so it's you it's you it's you it's
[1:11:29] you
[1:11:31] oh excuse me for getting excited this
[1:11:33] morning amen
[1:11:35] but you look at this oh you know the
[1:11:37] scripture tells us
[1:11:38] that we ought to give praise for the
[1:11:40] fiery trials
[1:11:41] now come on let's be honest saints
[1:11:42] when's the last time you got all excited
[1:11:44] running around the house praise the lord
[1:11:46] the world is falling apart and so is my
[1:11:49] finances
[1:11:51] no it's against human nature
[1:11:54] it's against human nature you know what
[1:11:57] i'm going to do
[1:11:59] finances are tough i'm going to get the
[1:12:00] wife a job
[1:12:03] i'm going to go put my wife right out
[1:12:05] here amongst the lions and the wolves
[1:12:12] really what you ought to be doing is
[1:12:14] saying lord
[1:12:15] according to your word i got a hole in
[1:12:18] this pocket
[1:12:20] and lord i'm going to submit this pocket
[1:12:22] to you the great seamstress
[1:12:24] to sew it up hope there's no lint falls
[1:12:26] out here
[1:12:28] sew up this pocket lord
[1:12:33] now if the need is there i'm not
[1:12:35] condemning anyone that has a job
[1:12:37] don't misunderstand me i'm telling you
[1:12:41] that our solution
[1:12:44] is not to go to god our solution
[1:12:49] is natural carnal that's what we're
[1:12:52] we just need more money no we need more
[1:12:55] god that's
[1:12:55] it we don't need more money we need more
[1:12:58] god
[1:13:00] hallelujah because god will stretch your
[1:13:03] dollar farther than even dave ramsey
[1:13:05] could dream of
[1:13:09] yeah come on i'm i agree with dave
[1:13:11] ramsey i don't think i've ever heard
[1:13:13] anything
[1:13:13] he said you know uh then i i and
[1:13:17] didn't agree with have a budget
[1:13:20] live on less than you make we don't make
[1:13:23] much brother paul live on less
[1:13:27] god feed the widow woman surely he feed
[1:13:29] you the bride of this last day
[1:13:32] hallelujah now i know some people don't
[1:13:35] like dave ramsey but
[1:13:37] hey he's just a man who's trying to get
[1:13:39] people out of debt he's just trying to
[1:13:41] help him
[1:13:41] that's his way you can listen to whoever
[1:13:43] you want do whatever program you want
[1:13:45] but if you live on more than you make
[1:13:50] i don't care whether you say you're the
[1:13:51] bride of christ or not you've got a
[1:13:53] problem
[1:13:55] yeah that's right but look at this how
[1:13:58] beautiful this is
[1:14:00] those that resist steadfast in the faith
[1:14:03] knowing that the same afflictions
[1:14:05] that are accomplished in your brethren
[1:14:07] that are in the world
[1:14:08] you see my brother and sister within
[1:14:11] this body of believers we call the bride
[1:14:12] of christ
[1:14:14] we look real close
[1:14:18] a guy down the road that confesses
[1:14:20] nothing you might have just the same
[1:14:23] worrisome things happen in your life
[1:14:25] just like him that's right when the
[1:14:28] battery dies in your car
[1:14:30] unless god chooses to come
[1:14:32] supernaturally your car
[1:14:34] is not running he has that same problem
[1:14:38] he goes to the doctor the doctor says
[1:14:40] well you have this issue in your body
[1:14:42] you go to the doctor the
[1:14:44] doctor says you have this issue in your
[1:14:45] body but what they don't have
[1:14:48] is a promise they don't have christ
[1:14:51] himself the holy ghost who said i'm
[1:14:53] going to manifest the prophet of god
[1:14:55] said
[1:14:55] what this seventh seal what it was about
[1:14:58] i'm just paraphrasing this what this was
[1:15:00] about
[1:15:00] was god uh manifesting himself
[1:15:05] in the people that's what the whole plan
[1:15:08] was
[1:15:08] amen that is the whole issue that's the
[1:15:11] whole
[1:15:12] sum total of it is god said i'm going to
[1:15:14] come down and i'm going to manifest
[1:15:15] myself in you
[1:15:16] not just that god is present but the
[1:15:19] bride anointing
[1:15:21] the anointing of this last day is going
[1:15:23] to be manifested in you and i
[1:15:25] yeah we won't just read about it we
[1:15:27] won't just talk about it that's right
[1:15:28] we will be it that's right in fact uh my
[1:15:31] sister jerry and i talked about this i
[1:15:33] can't remember now the sermon because
[1:15:34] we've been in several
[1:15:35] lately but uh the prophet of god says
[1:15:38] you you are the rapture it's taking
[1:15:39] place right now
[1:15:42] i'm waiting for the rapture in that
[1:15:44] blessing
[1:15:45] oh no it's happening right now
[1:15:48] my some people just get all up tight
[1:15:50] they'll get in a sweat over this
[1:15:51] they probably aren't listening so it
[1:15:52] won't matter but you know what
[1:15:55] i am the rapture and i am taking place
[1:15:58] right now
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:00] it's not this man in the flesh it's
[1:16:02] christ in me
[1:16:04] and it's taking place right now don't
[1:16:07] don't go looking off in another day and
[1:16:09] say you know when the rapture happens
[1:16:10] or when we see certain signs they're
[1:16:12] happening
[1:16:14] the sign we ought to be looking for is
[1:16:17] christ manifested in you and i that's
[1:16:19] the sign
[1:16:20] that fullness of christ poured into the
[1:16:23] church
[1:16:24] all that was in christ was poured into
[1:16:28] what
[1:16:29] the church who's the church
[1:16:34] the bride who's the bride
[1:16:37] amen amen
[1:16:43] okay now we've got to get on to our
[1:16:45] subject
[1:16:47] hallelujah now look at this my brother
[1:16:50] and sister
[1:16:52] verse 10 the god of all grace who hath
[1:16:54] called us into his eternal glory by
[1:16:56] christ jesus
[1:16:57] after you have suffered for a while amen
[1:17:00] aren't you glad
[1:17:00] for a while means that the suffering
[1:17:02] comes to an end
[1:17:04] amen you suffered for a while make you
[1:17:07] perfect
[1:17:08] in that beautiful i have a promise to be
[1:17:10] perfect it's taking place right now it's
[1:17:13] being manifested right
[1:17:14] as we speak this perfection of the word
[1:17:18] is bringing us into a state of
[1:17:20] perfection you say but brother paul i
[1:17:22] don't feel perfect well don't ask what
[1:17:24] you feel my brother and sister
[1:17:25] talk to god and god will reveal to you
[1:17:28] how he views perfect
[1:17:30] do you know what he views perfect as can
[1:17:31] i give you just a glimpse real quick you
[1:17:33] know it already
[1:17:34] but he views perfect as that one who
[1:17:37] submits himself
[1:17:38] with no string attached and says lord
[1:17:42] i'm yours
[1:17:43] i'm yours that's perfect because then he
[1:17:44] gets to mold
[1:17:46] in any form or fashion that he wants
[1:17:50] you know i learned a lesson in school
[1:17:51] can you imagine brother paul is an
[1:17:53] artist
[1:17:55] you're all stunned and no we can't
[1:18:01] so i took art class i think it was in
[1:18:03] ninth grade
[1:18:05] the class i really wanted to take was
[1:18:07] full class everybody wanted to take it
[1:18:09] was full
[1:18:09] so it's like what's left to do that'd be
[1:18:11] fun art class
[1:18:13] the teacher my sister knew her well was
[1:18:15] actually very very close friends with
[1:18:17] this teacher miss braden
[1:18:19] she's a lovely lady i don't know what
[1:18:21] did she have
[1:18:22] emma polio she walked with braces
[1:18:26] looked like such an unlikely person
[1:18:30] to be so gifted
[1:18:34] paint a flower sister nadia you would
[1:18:37] have been impressed
[1:18:40] i turned my flower in and the teacher's
[1:18:42] like what's this
[1:18:45] we're going to do this and the teacher
[1:18:47] would be like paul
[1:18:49] don't ever try to be that we got to
[1:18:53] pottery
[1:18:54] you're supposed to take the clay and you
[1:18:57] start to knead it
[1:18:59] you start to push it out and you fold it
[1:19:01] over and you push it out
[1:19:02] and you fold it over and you push it out
[1:19:05] you know what you're doing
[1:19:07] you're eliminating all the hard hearts
[1:19:08] i'm in the hard spots
[1:19:14] come on saints some of us sit here in
[1:19:15] church maybe even today
[1:19:17] you've got a hard spot in your heart and
[1:19:20] you will not
[1:19:22] ever become what god called you to be
[1:19:24] because when you put that lump of clay
[1:19:26] on the wheel and start to mold it on
[1:19:29] that pottery wheel
[1:19:30] and you get to the place you hit that
[1:19:32] big hard
[1:19:33] lump of clay your little deal you're
[1:19:36] making on the wheel
[1:19:38] is garbage and that'll be the same thing
[1:19:42] you hold a hard spot
[1:19:43] in your heart to anyone or anything
[1:19:46] as it were you cannot be molded into
[1:19:50] what god called you
[1:19:51] what you need to do instead of holding
[1:19:53] on to the hard spots
[1:19:54] and saying i'm not going to go there i
[1:19:56] don't want to deal with that that is
[1:19:58] painful
[1:19:59] what you do is go through the pain
[1:20:00] either now or you will go through the
[1:20:03] pain later
[1:20:05] you know paul was lazy in art class and
[1:20:08] i just fold my clay around a couple
[1:20:10] times and when my time
[1:20:11] come to go on the potter's wheel and i
[1:20:13] poked my finger in there and miss braden
[1:20:15] would be saying paul you don't even have
[1:20:16] your clay centered
[1:20:19] i can make a pot out of this
[1:20:24] yeah i'll just follow how i feel
[1:20:27] i'll just follow what i think i'll just
[1:20:29] follow this
[1:20:31] it works good when you first start to
[1:20:33] mold it
[1:20:34] but when it comes to actually molding
[1:20:37] something
[1:20:38] that has form of beauty it is not
[1:20:42] perfectly
[1:20:42] centered on the word that's it you
[1:20:45] cannot
[1:20:46] bring it out into the very finesse
[1:20:50] to create something of beauty amen
[1:20:55] are you with me got down to the end of
[1:21:00] my ninth grade
[1:21:02] my sister susan actually is pretty
[1:21:04] accomplished artist i think
[1:21:05] time and life has kind of took that away
[1:21:07] from her i don't know if she spends time
[1:21:09] but
[1:21:10] maybe as a hobby she should go back to
[1:21:12] that
[1:21:15] miss braden said paul can i talk to you
[1:21:19] miss brayden i love you she was a
[1:21:20] wonderful lady we sit down she pats me
[1:21:23] on the arm
[1:21:24] she tells me she thinks i'm going to be
[1:21:26] a fine young man when i grow up
[1:21:29] implying that you aren't right now
[1:21:34] and she said going into the 10th grade
[1:21:36] will you please take any class
[1:21:38] but mine
[1:21:45] you see there was no innate
[1:21:48] nature in me to be an artist
[1:21:57] somehow the flower i saw here
[1:22:01] transfer transferred through my thinking
[1:22:04] never
[1:22:04] made it to here
[1:22:07] no nature i hope you follow this
[1:22:11] no nature in me to be an
[1:22:14] artist and there was no nature in you
[1:22:19] or i to be brought into the perfection
[1:22:22] as sons and daughters of god
[1:22:25] but god said just stop i don't need your
[1:22:28] nature brother trevor
[1:22:29] i want you to just empty out your nature
[1:22:32] and i'll pour my nature into you and my
[1:22:36] nature will allow you to be molded by
[1:22:38] the word
[1:22:39] and you will become this thing of beauty
[1:22:42] and it will be looked upon and then the
[1:22:45] lord says that was the perfect son or
[1:22:47] daughter of god
[1:22:48] he's the one who submitted and said lord
[1:22:51] mold me
[1:22:52] however you want me to be i don't need
[1:22:54] to be me
[1:22:55] lord i need to be you i need to be you
[1:22:58] expressed
[1:22:59] see that's perfection to god is when we
[1:23:02] surrender ourself
[1:23:04] completely to his will
[1:23:07] to be molded by the word of god
[1:23:10] hallelujah
[1:23:11] hallelujah you got to love the lord now
[1:23:14] look
[1:23:15] brother branham says here oh
[1:23:18] pardon me i think that's it right there
[1:23:22] i don't know you know here recently i
[1:23:24] feel so bad about not having church that
[1:23:25] day the weather totally turned and
[1:23:27] warmed up and by noon everything was
[1:23:29] melting and i i just felt
[1:23:31] i felt really foolish
[1:23:35] but we listen my brother and sister if
[1:23:39] you haven't please go listen to lean not
[1:23:41] to down
[1:23:41] unto thy own understanding it's an
[1:23:43] incredible sermon
[1:23:44] it is just straightforward and it fits
[1:23:47] today perfectly
[1:23:49] now jesus said in saint john 10 my sheep
[1:23:51] know my voice
[1:23:52] a voice of course is his word when he is
[1:23:55] speaking my sheep know my voice my voice
[1:23:57] has been proven to them
[1:23:59] to be true it's been vindicated that it
[1:24:02] is
[1:24:02] my voice amen can we say amen to that
[1:24:06] that's the day that we live in if we're
[1:24:08] sitting here today and we have a
[1:24:09] question whether it's truth or not
[1:24:11] you will never receive the full blessing
[1:24:14] or benefit of that
[1:24:16] because in the background is always a
[1:24:18] nagging doubt
[1:24:19] did i miss something is this not right
[1:24:21] you have to my brother and sister
[1:24:23] if you're going to be a hair christian
[1:24:24] and be the best hair krishna you can be
[1:24:27] if you're going to be catholic be the
[1:24:28] best catholic you can be the prophet of
[1:24:30] god i always humored that when i was a
[1:24:31] kid i was like dad i think i'm going to
[1:24:33] follow this quote right here and my
[1:24:34] dad's like not as long as i'm alive
[1:24:36] and that was if you're going to be a bum
[1:24:38] be the best mom you can be
[1:24:40] hallelujah i lived in my pickup i slept
[1:24:43] in my pickup
[1:24:44] i skied i went here i went there i did
[1:24:47] all kinds of things because i wasn't
[1:24:48] going to be bound down to nothing
[1:24:50] i just was going to do my best at the
[1:24:52] bum but i found out that being a bum
[1:24:54] i was a different nature than the bums
[1:24:56] that you would see on the
[1:24:57] exits on the interchange i was a bum who
[1:24:59] liked to spend money
[1:25:01] and so i had to go to work and then i
[1:25:03] did finally you know decided if i'm
[1:25:04] going to go to work i might as well
[1:25:06] submit to the system i'm talking about
[1:25:07] just the natural course of life
[1:25:09] and the profit of god one day my dad
[1:25:11] gave me another quote and it says there
[1:25:13] he says you don't work you don't eat
[1:25:17] wow i like to eat too so
[1:25:20] i'm gonna have to get a job
[1:25:23] but it's been proven to us saints it's
[1:25:26] been proven to us we're not sitting here
[1:25:27] today with a doubt a nagging doubt that
[1:25:29] we could be being deceived
[1:25:32] this is truth oh let me just throw this
[1:25:36] out brother christian i've discussed
[1:25:38] this deal you can look at this what was
[1:25:40] said right here i don't understand
[1:25:41] what's right here now
[1:25:42] this was said right here i don't
[1:25:43] understand what was said right here i
[1:25:45] don't understand these things that was
[1:25:46] there
[1:25:46] there's things that you can look at and
[1:25:48] you can start putting question marks
[1:25:49] over it but i want to ask you
[1:25:51] are there things about salvation they
[1:25:54] have question marks attached to them
[1:25:56] absolutely not absolutely not
[1:26:01] you see what the devil's trying to do is
[1:26:03] trying to get you
[1:26:05] from your position of standing steadfast
[1:26:08] in the faith i don't know if i can take
[1:26:11] that promise i don't know if that's real
[1:26:13] i don't know that
[1:26:14] i think it's so funny my brother and
[1:26:15] sister let me just interject this so
[1:26:17] some little studies i've just come
[1:26:18] across now we're over here and you look
[1:26:21] in the pentecostal world and some of you
[1:26:22] will freak out and say brother paul's
[1:26:23] listening to some of these pentecostal
[1:26:25] preachers well
[1:26:26] my brother and sister they preached
[1:26:27] truth too and i'm not basing my doctrine
[1:26:29] and my thoughts
[1:26:30] there's just a few of them i just judge
[1:26:32] where they're at by hearing what they're
[1:26:34] preaching
[1:26:35] and i sit there and say sister jerry
[1:26:37] look at this
[1:26:38] that is almost an absolute word for word
[1:26:41] quote of brother branham
[1:26:44] brother brown says when they start
[1:26:45] coming for the oil look out
[1:26:49] so now you've got pentecostal preachers
[1:26:51] standing in their pulpit saying i was
[1:26:52] reading uh some writings of a minister
[1:26:54] the other day
[1:26:55] and he said blah blah blah blah blah
[1:26:57] blah blah blah
[1:26:58] and i'm like that's brother branham he
[1:27:00] just quoted
[1:27:03] they're not going to admit it
[1:27:06] they're not going to admit it saints but
[1:27:09] i'm telling you here's these pentecostal
[1:27:11] preachers
[1:27:12] they are just digging in heard one of
[1:27:16] them
[1:27:16] i ain't gonna tell you the name guys
[1:27:19] guy's an interesting guy
[1:27:23] stands in the pulpit i might just share
[1:27:25] this while back stands in the pulpit
[1:27:27] at a recent convention
[1:27:30] and says the problem with us
[1:27:31] pentecostals we all spoke in tongues
[1:27:33] everybody's like
[1:27:34] i spoke in tongues
[1:27:38] and he says but your problem is you've
[1:27:40] got no life
[1:27:42] to back it up
[1:27:47] dead quiet
[1:27:50] and i don't want to hear about you
[1:27:52] speaking in tongues until you've got a
[1:27:54] life
[1:27:55] to back it up
[1:28:00] i apply that
[1:28:04] we're not having a special election
[1:28:05] today you're not going to throw me out
[1:28:07] today
[1:28:09] but why don't we quit walking around i
[1:28:11] believe the message i believe the
[1:28:12] message i believe the message
[1:28:14] that's our version of speaking in
[1:28:16] tongues i believe the message i believe
[1:28:18] the message
[1:28:19] what i want to see saints is a life
[1:28:23] there's got to be a life this word of
[1:28:25] god is a life amen
[1:28:29] but back to my original thoughts so you
[1:28:30] got these guys that are over here and
[1:28:31] they say well
[1:28:32] william branham said
[1:28:36] see what he's doing
[1:28:40] and the other half of christendom is
[1:28:42] quoting the prophet
[1:28:44] incognito
[1:28:48] from thousands of pulpits
[1:28:51] and they're not chasing them down
[1:28:53] criticizing them
[1:28:55] you know why it's real simple saints
[1:28:59] i'm not going to bother defending what
[1:29:01] the prophet said he said this here now
[1:29:02] we have to prove that
[1:29:03] we have to prove this he told me to go
[1:29:05] back to my bible
[1:29:07] that's where i went i said okay i'm
[1:29:08] going to listen to the prophet i went
[1:29:10] back to my bible and the bible says it i
[1:29:13] don't care what anybody else thinks
[1:29:14] about it
[1:29:15] the bible says it i believe it
[1:29:19] while they're all arguing over whether
[1:29:23] there was this many blanket natives or
[1:29:25] that many blanket natives
[1:29:26] or another one pipes in and says who
[1:29:28] counted
[1:29:31] no go ahead do what you want to do god's
[1:29:34] real in my household
[1:29:35] god's real in my life god's real in my
[1:29:37] church
[1:29:39] amen i know i don't have to go prove it
[1:29:41] by something else
[1:29:42] i proved it by him here present today i
[1:29:45] proved it by the word of the hour
[1:29:47] and it isn't because brother branham
[1:29:49] said it and i will quote him
[1:29:50] my brother and sister as long as it is
[1:29:53] truth
[1:29:54] wait he it's not changing is it nobody
[1:29:56] snuck in and pulled the page out of our
[1:29:58] church age book
[1:29:59] and reprinted it and come and stuck
[1:30:01] another page into our church age book
[1:30:02] so what he preached is already anchored
[1:30:05] and if it was truth then
[1:30:07] it's truth now i don't care where the
[1:30:10] church has went
[1:30:11] i don't care where the message has went
[1:30:15] the word doesn't change jesus christ the
[1:30:18] same yesterday today
[1:30:20] and forever and everybody's like well
[1:30:22] compared to this
[1:30:23] and compared to that read a little
[1:30:24] comment the other day well the message
[1:30:26] reason i left the message
[1:30:27] it is so old-fashioned well thank you
[1:30:30] lord
[1:30:31] because i tell you what i don't need no
[1:30:33] new modern made out of plastic message
[1:30:36] give me a good old-fashioned anchored in
[1:30:38] the rock word of god
[1:30:40] it don't need to be modern it don't need
[1:30:42] to have a whatever and we had a visitor
[1:30:44] one time right here in this church and
[1:30:45] said it was so refreshing to be here
[1:30:47] the lights were on i'm not a mushroom to
[1:30:50] live in the dark
[1:30:52] but everywhere you go and even some
[1:30:54] message churches
[1:30:56] let's put bright lights and dim
[1:31:01] you realize the symbolism of that
[1:31:04] the prophet of god touched on that
[1:31:07] anointed ministry
[1:31:09] and the people sitting in darkness
[1:31:14] no let's get the lights off we're
[1:31:17] children of light
[1:31:18] hallelujah and we're going to stand
[1:31:20] steadfast
[1:31:21] on this word of god we're not moving
[1:31:24] from it
[1:31:24] amen oh it's not about this quote it's
[1:31:27] not about that quote
[1:31:28] i quote the quote saints because i
[1:31:30] believe what i'm reading
[1:31:31] i've saw it with my own eyes it came
[1:31:33] alive it's not something i'm hoping for
[1:31:36] it's something i've already seen
[1:31:39] and by god's grace i don't have to look
[1:31:41] backwards because he said
[1:31:43] you're gonna go forward into this
[1:31:45] rapture
[1:31:46] and i am listening and i said yes lord i
[1:31:49] am going forward into this rapture
[1:31:52] because
[1:31:53] i am the rapture amen and it can't take
[1:31:56] place without me
[1:31:57] hallelujah so therefore i've got to go
[1:32:00] fill my position
[1:32:01] and move forward and claim that
[1:32:03] hallelujah
[1:32:05] oh it's not about what was wrong my
[1:32:07] brother and sister the prophet of god
[1:32:09] said right there
[1:32:10] he says you know oh how was that brother
[1:32:13] george and i was just talking about that
[1:32:14] reminds me brother george sends
[1:32:16] greetings to everyone he loves you very
[1:32:18] much
[1:32:19] hallelujah but he says if they pass this
[1:32:22] covert vaccination or you don't fly
[1:32:24] thing he says then he might not see you
[1:32:25] again
[1:32:26] for a long time so just pray that the
[1:32:29] anointing of the devil doesn't doesn't
[1:32:31] do that
[1:32:33] but you look at that my brother says
[1:32:34] where was i oh my where was i
[1:32:39] oh probably wasn't important
[1:32:44] hey
[1:32:48] now notice they're not subject
[1:32:51] to following any other voice can i just
[1:32:54] put in real blunt terms
[1:32:56] i don't care about all them why i left
[1:32:58] the message people that are on youtube
[1:33:04] well praise the lord the prophet told me
[1:33:06] it's for believers only
[1:33:12] why i left the message well that's good
[1:33:20] maybe i should make a youtube video
[1:33:23] why i
[1:33:27] why i why i
[1:33:31] imagine we can make it about almost
[1:33:34] anything
[1:33:36] i was going to say why i don't eat ice
[1:33:37] cream but i do and hopefully nobody's
[1:33:39] looking
[1:33:43] but look it's not about why i don't
[1:33:49] amen i don't i don't live out here like
[1:33:51] they do because
[1:33:53] there's nothing calling me out there
[1:33:57] i live here because there's a voice
[1:34:01] that come down and screamed and i said
[1:34:03] that's a voice i recognize
[1:34:05] that's who i am i've been walking with
[1:34:08] the chickens
[1:34:09] and trying to understand that i was what
[1:34:11] is that uh
[1:34:12] there's several different one but i
[1:34:13] think one that's really popular is
[1:34:14] called babylon to learn new language
[1:34:17] or babble something like that you know
[1:34:19] learn a new language in just
[1:34:20] uh just uh you know few weeks or
[1:34:22] whatever my brother and sister the bride
[1:34:24] of christ is not down here
[1:34:26] walking with the chickens with a babble
[1:34:28] deal going okay
[1:34:38] then they look at you oh i didn't get
[1:34:41] that right
[1:34:44] clock
[1:34:49] still didn't get it right
[1:34:54] yeah yes yes yes
[1:35:01] forgive me for being dramatic my brother
[1:35:03] and sister but that's what separated you
[1:35:04] why you're not baptist
[1:35:06] nazarene methodist mormon catholic is
[1:35:09] because
[1:35:09] you were going along repeating out of
[1:35:12] some kind of a book
[1:35:13] and then one day you were able to come
[1:35:16] to a place
[1:35:16] you could speak from the heart you could
[1:35:19] speak from your soul
[1:35:20] and your soul said i love you lord and
[1:35:23] your word
[1:35:24] is so real to me it feeds my soul
[1:35:27] and you can rejoice and shout and dance
[1:35:30] in the lord
[1:35:30] because everything that's coming
[1:35:32] speaking to your soul
[1:35:34] and the thing that's important you can
[1:35:37] speak
[1:35:38] back it's not a one-sided conversation
[1:35:43] we're gonna take communion tonight
[1:35:45] that's what it's about my brother and
[1:35:47] sister
[1:35:48] not a one-sided conversation you're not
[1:35:51] speaking to god and he's ignoring you
[1:35:53] he's not speaking to you and you're
[1:35:55] ignoring him
[1:35:56] but you got a conversation
[1:36:00] hallelujah oh my
[1:36:04] hallelujah you know i had a whole nother
[1:36:07] section of this
[1:36:09] amen i don't think we'll go on with that
[1:36:11] but look at this now let's just finish
[1:36:12] this right here
[1:36:14] now notice they're not subject to
[1:36:15] following any other voice
[1:36:17] now look i'm kind of hitting on this but
[1:36:19] my brother and sister because these
[1:36:20] things make a little surge every once in
[1:36:22] a while kind of like the tide they go
[1:36:24] away and they're quiet for a little bit
[1:36:25] and then they make a whole bunch of new
[1:36:27] videos and a whole bunch of new
[1:36:28] recordings and they edit them all out
[1:36:30] and make them sound just right
[1:36:31] and it's so from their heart that
[1:36:33] sometimes they do it three or four times
[1:36:35] until
[1:36:35] they feel like it's just perfect
[1:36:40] i like that song says listen to my heart
[1:36:42] lord
[1:36:44] you see sometimes this don't get it all
[1:36:45] spoke just quite right with my heart
[1:36:48] my heart's speaking a different language
[1:36:50] but no what we do we set up a
[1:36:52] studio and we edit it and we do this and
[1:36:55] do that until we feel like our version
[1:36:57] is perfect really why don't you speak to
[1:37:01] me from your heart
[1:37:03] i was here this happened that's us i got
[1:37:06] discouraged i left
[1:37:08] good good let me tell you my version
[1:37:12] i would have left with you but some
[1:37:15] anointing come down on my heart
[1:37:17] come down in my life and something said
[1:37:19] just stand
[1:37:21] just stand let this storm blow around
[1:37:24] you
[1:37:25] let all of the tumbleweeds and all of
[1:37:27] the thistles and all the trash
[1:37:29] blow beyond you and just stand
[1:37:32] be steadfast in the faith and i will be
[1:37:35] there with you and when it's all over i
[1:37:37] have a reward for you because you stood
[1:37:39] faithful and everybody's like i'm afraid
[1:37:42] of the devil i'm afraid of him taking
[1:37:44] our children i'm not afraid of this i'm
[1:37:45] afraid of marriages i'm afraid this this
[1:37:47] this
[1:37:48] i'm sorry i'm not i'm not everyone that
[1:37:50] said
[1:37:51] fast on the word will stand every single
[1:37:53] storm of laodicea
[1:37:55] there's nothing can come in here and
[1:37:56] destroy us because it's the
[1:37:58] faith the word of god that is holding us
[1:38:02] amen stand fast in the faith
[1:38:06] oh wow whereby you've been set free
[1:38:10] hallelujah anybody free this morning
[1:38:12] hallelujah
[1:38:13] and look i speak this thing saints not
[1:38:15] because i just read this and i'm trying
[1:38:17] to be a puppet
[1:38:18] this is something i have personally
[1:38:20] witnessed and i get to witness it every
[1:38:22] single day of my life
[1:38:23] that when i veer away i start to pull
[1:38:26] back and i start to say woe is me
[1:38:28] and the problem gets worse after a while
[1:38:30] you get tired of making your own problem
[1:38:32] worse and so you quit the woe as me and
[1:38:34] say
[1:38:34] lord help me not woe is me but lord help
[1:38:38] me
[1:38:39] oh hallelujah now look let me wrap this
[1:38:42] up
[1:38:42] sister emmy musicians if you'd come that
[1:38:44] will certainly help me
[1:38:47] how are we resisting saints
[1:38:50] by standing steadfast we can we can name
[1:38:52] dozens of things that we're doing
[1:38:55] to resist but the truth of it is
[1:38:58] the one sum total that wraps around it
[1:39:01] all
[1:39:01] we're resisting by standing steadfast
[1:39:05] take your bible read your bible every
[1:39:08] day
[1:39:09] pray every day sometimes we don't feel
[1:39:12] like it lord i just don't feel like it
[1:39:13] this
[1:39:13] is i'm so down i'm so out i'm so
[1:39:16] whatever well
[1:39:17] stand steadfast amen don't get blown by
[1:39:20] every wind
[1:39:21] just stand steadfast the devil won't be
[1:39:24] able
[1:39:25] to touch you now i'm going to skip over
[1:39:27] a whole bunch of stuff so hopefully
[1:39:30] i'll make a reference here in numbers
[1:39:34] not going to go through all the
[1:39:35] scripture for the sake of time
[1:39:37] but we see in numbers where moses a man
[1:39:39] whose mistakes
[1:39:41] and weaknesses were glaringly obvious
[1:39:44] don't you love that
[1:39:46] come on i just i i just love it myself
[1:39:50] well most of us won't walk around
[1:39:52] talking about our weaknesses
[1:39:54] and glaring mistakes and we do all kinds
[1:39:57] of things but god made moses in such a
[1:39:59] way that all of his
[1:40:00] weaknesses and mistakes were glaringly
[1:40:03] obvious
[1:40:06] i hope i don't offend anybody
[1:40:09] but god sent a prophet to our day whose
[1:40:12] weaknesses and mistakes
[1:40:14] were glaringly obvious
[1:40:18] just listen to a man the other day says
[1:40:20] well i don't know about william
[1:40:22] branham there was all kinds of
[1:40:24] supernatural events took place in his
[1:40:25] ministry
[1:40:26] we believe he was a man of god and was
[1:40:28] anointed of god
[1:40:30] but you know there has to be something
[1:40:32] that was hidden because he was audited
[1:40:34] by the irs
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:38] praise the lord i find in hosea
[1:40:42] chapter 1 any man audited by the irs
[1:40:47] cannot be a man of god
[1:40:53] we saw supernatural events this won't be
[1:40:55] word for word but it's close
[1:40:56] we saw supernatural events and we saw
[1:40:59] god move
[1:41:00] god blessed him beyond measure but when
[1:41:03] he stepped
[1:41:04] out of his calling
[1:41:13] what was his calling
[1:41:18] thank you brother tim
[1:41:22] i'm going to restore you
[1:41:26] according to the word
[1:41:29] but you see their interpretation was his
[1:41:32] calling was praying for the sick
[1:41:38] elijah prophet to the day
[1:41:42] condemned ahab jezebel
[1:41:46] spoke to clouds commanded great things
[1:41:50] to happen
[1:41:50] was god's mouthpiece
[1:41:54] but when he became a cafeteria or
[1:41:58] restaurant he must have been out of his
[1:41:59] calling
[1:42:02] why would god send a prophet to one
[1:42:05] woman and a child
[1:42:07] in a whole city of hungry people
[1:42:11] god wouldn't do that god would have
[1:42:14] showed up with a caravan
[1:42:15] full of food for the whole city
[1:42:20] elijah must have been out of his calling
[1:42:24] you know what it tells me there was one
[1:42:27] woman in that city
[1:42:29] that had totally
[1:42:33] surrendered that doesn't mean she was
[1:42:36] above despair
[1:42:38] her own word says i'm going to fix this
[1:42:40] one last meal
[1:42:42] for my child and i then we will die
[1:42:46] it doesn't mean she didn't have might
[1:42:48] call it depression
[1:42:49] the terms of this day didn't see any
[1:42:52] hope in sight
[1:42:55] but god said it doesn't matter how she
[1:42:56] feels at the moment
[1:42:58] i'm god she's mine and i will answer the
[1:43:02] prayers
[1:43:03] she already spoke
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:06] and god comes down into one city why in
[1:43:09] a whole city
[1:43:11] in a time in an age when people children
[1:43:14] were taken off into bondage for deaths
[1:43:17] of not even their own but of
[1:43:19] parents and other relatives taken into
[1:43:22] bondage
[1:43:22] why would god speak to a woman and tell
[1:43:25] her you go to your neighbor and you get
[1:43:27] you get vessels not just a one not just
[1:43:30] a few i want you to get everyone you go
[1:43:32] through the whole community
[1:43:33] you get every empty vessel you can and
[1:43:35] when you come and when you start
[1:43:37] the doors have to be closed in other
[1:43:40] words you can't say well praise the lord
[1:43:42] god's doing more i think i better go get
[1:43:43] more vessels you better get it now
[1:43:46] get it now because when the door closes
[1:43:48] there's not going to be any more pouring
[1:43:49] out
[1:43:50] why did god do that
[1:43:54] because that was his chosen
[1:43:58] that was his children that's where he
[1:44:01] wanted to place himself
[1:44:02] right there look at the day we're living
[1:44:05] in
[1:44:08] let me close this out right here
[1:44:11] in other words oh let me go back up here
[1:44:15] it's vindicated it's my voice now notice
[1:44:17] they're not subject to following any
[1:44:18] other voice
[1:44:19] they won't my sheep know my voice and a
[1:44:21] stranger
[1:44:22] they will not follow me ever wondered
[1:44:24] why we're not talking about preachers
[1:44:26] saints we're not talking about who's the
[1:44:27] pastor of grace tabernacle
[1:44:28] that could change tomorrow
[1:44:34] two are following jesus christ in other
[1:44:38] words they will not understand
[1:44:39] a theological voice that's teaching
[1:44:42] contrary to the word
[1:44:44] the sheep don't understand that no more
[1:44:46] than the eagle last night
[1:44:48] could understand the clocking of the hen
[1:44:50] they don't understand it because he was
[1:44:52] an eagle
[1:44:52] and that's the same thing with a genuine
[1:44:54] born-again child of god
[1:44:56] they only understand the things that are
[1:44:58] of
[1:45:00] god you wonder why you're not happy to
[1:45:03] be a denominational christian
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:08] come on so much i could say but you're
[1:45:10] believers you read you study
[1:45:12] amen prophet of god said the minute you
[1:45:14] take on
[1:45:15] the spirit of denomination
[1:45:18] he said you round it and it's done
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] hallelujah come on saints that don't
[1:45:27] work no better than grounding your
[1:45:29] children
[1:45:31] you see it was housea the second chapter
[1:45:34] that says he who will not ground his
[1:45:36] child will spoil him
[1:45:40] now you guys have read that haven't you
[1:45:43] come on saints it's time we get back
[1:45:46] well we just don't live in a day brother
[1:45:47] paul of corporate punishment i don't
[1:45:49] care what you live in the day of my
[1:45:50] brother and sister the bible says
[1:45:52] if you don't uh you spare the rod
[1:45:55] amen you're gonna spoil that child that
[1:45:58] doesn't mean that we use the
[1:45:59] old-fashioned you know we were a kid of
[1:46:01] the 60s and
[1:46:02] dad's idea of of you know
[1:46:06] the rod happened to look like a two
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:10] before
[1:46:12] but come on let's put the principles i'm
[1:46:14] not trying to tell you how to discipline
[1:46:15] your children but the principles
[1:46:16] we can't depart the principles and
[1:46:18] expect to get the results
[1:46:20] hallelujah okay i want to quit here amen
[1:46:24] now praise the lord i thought i'd get an
[1:46:26] amen on the quitting part
[1:46:28] hallelujah let me say it this way saints
[1:46:32] in that time that we look in the
[1:46:34] scripture we see that moses with all of
[1:46:37] his
[1:46:37] heirs all of his problems all of his
[1:46:39] whatever god stood with him
[1:46:41] and he just go study his little homework
[1:46:44] numbers the 16th chapter
[1:46:46] i have right here on my uh notes uh
[1:46:49] verse 27 through 34.
[1:46:51] we'll see how that dayton they come to
[1:46:54] moses and they tell them you know what
[1:46:55] we're just as spiritual as you
[1:46:57] it doesn't matter how spiritual you are
[1:46:59] if god didn't call you to that position
[1:47:01] yes we're going back tying this to the
[1:47:03] start of the service
[1:47:04] if you're not called to that position
[1:47:05] then don't try and occupy what it's
[1:47:07] called has nothing to do with how
[1:47:08] spiritual you are
[1:47:09] you saints i'll just put it this way
[1:47:12] there's many of you here no doubt are
[1:47:13] more spiritual than me
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:21] but did god call you to be a pastor
[1:47:25] did god call you you see what i'm saying
[1:47:28] how spiritual we are and how god speaks
[1:47:30] to us shouldn't be
[1:47:32] based on that guy that guy
[1:47:36] say thank you lord that you open my eyes
[1:47:38] to see what i see
[1:47:40] but they came and said you know what
[1:47:41] we're just as spiritual as you and
[1:47:43] you're in control and
[1:47:44] because we're just as spiritual or more
[1:47:46] so than you we should be in control we
[1:47:48] should have a voice
[1:47:53] in numbers there god speaks to moses and
[1:47:56] tells him you know what
[1:48:00] hallelujah now look at this let's just
[1:48:02] go here
[1:48:03] i had it right here on this screen and
[1:48:05] and they got up from the tabernacle of
[1:48:06] court nathan and barum on every side and
[1:48:08] dathan and barron came out and stood in
[1:48:10] the doors of their tents and their wives
[1:48:11] their sons their little children
[1:48:13] and moses said hereby shall know that
[1:48:15] the lord has sent me to do all these
[1:48:17] works for i have not done them of my own
[1:48:19] mind
[1:48:20] if these men die the common death of all
[1:48:23] men or if they be visited after the
[1:48:24] visitation of all men then the lord hath
[1:48:26] not sent me
[1:48:28] put himself in a supernatural judgment
[1:48:30] right here moses put himself right out
[1:48:31] there where
[1:48:32] he himself would be judged what he is
[1:48:34] judging
[1:48:36] but if the lord make a new thing and the
[1:48:38] earth open her mouth and swallow them up
[1:48:40] with all that are pain to them
[1:48:42] appertained to them
[1:48:44] and they go down quick and to the pit ye
[1:48:46] shall understand that these men
[1:48:48] have provoked the lord and it came to
[1:48:49] pass as they had made an end
[1:48:51] of speaking all these words that the
[1:48:52] ground clave asunder that was
[1:48:54] under them and the earth opened her
[1:48:57] mouth
[1:48:58] and swallowed them up and their houses
[1:49:00] and all the men that appertained the
[1:49:01] decorah and all their goods
[1:49:03] they and all that appertained to them
[1:49:06] went down alive into the pit
[1:49:08] and the earth closed upon them and they
[1:49:10] perished from among the congregation
[1:49:12] and all israel that was round about them
[1:49:14] fled at the cry of them for they said
[1:49:16] lest the earth swallow
[1:49:17] us up also now let's just interpret this
[1:49:21] to the day we have my brother and sister
[1:49:23] you think brother paul you're speaking
[1:49:24] kind of harsh on them it is because it's
[1:49:26] a seducing spirit
[1:49:29] it's a seducing spirit but i want you to
[1:49:33] just recognize this
[1:49:34] these people are taking their position
[1:49:38] and we're watching them one by one being
[1:49:41] swallowed up
[1:49:42] by the earth them their wife
[1:49:46] their children their closest friends
[1:49:49] all of this being swallowed up
[1:49:53] by the earth now look what it says here
[1:49:57] they perished from among the
[1:50:00] congregation
[1:50:03] now let's just look at this very
[1:50:04] carefully
[1:50:08] it lays the groundwork that they're
[1:50:10] still out there living breathing
[1:50:12] that's right but they perished from the
[1:50:14] congregation
[1:50:16] gone from the house of god why because
[1:50:19] they made god angry
[1:50:20] amen verse 34. i stopped right there
[1:50:23] saints
[1:50:25] it'd do us good to have a little bit of
[1:50:26] fear and flee
[1:50:29] from that bless the word worse come upon
[1:50:33] us
[1:50:34] the earth swallow us up i don't want to
[1:50:37] be swallowed up by laodicea
[1:50:39] i want to stand strong on the word of
[1:50:41] god there's things i don't understand
[1:50:43] there's things i can't explain there's
[1:50:45] things that baffle me
[1:50:46] amen but one thing i do know i'm not
[1:50:49] going to try to take a position god
[1:50:51] didn't call me too
[1:50:52] i'm not going to try and be what god
[1:50:54] didn't call me to be
[1:50:55] he called me just to be a son of god
[1:50:57] that's why the prophet of god's own
[1:50:58] words
[1:50:59] his theme only believe amen
[1:51:05] reminds me of a brother by god's grace i
[1:51:08] could speak real direct to him
[1:51:10] he said well brother paul i i think you
[1:51:12] know one of the problems we have around
[1:51:13] the message is we're ignorant
[1:51:14] i was like i agree i'm ignorant
[1:51:20] he said unless we could understand the
[1:51:23] greek and all of these things i said
[1:51:24] brother
[1:51:25] brother brown dealt with that brother
[1:51:28] what are you gonna do i mean there's
[1:51:29] there's only 14
[1:51:31] 15 different dialects of a certain
[1:51:33] dialect
[1:51:36] you're going to go learn them all spend
[1:51:37] your whole life learning that
[1:51:39] it won't do it he said well i think we
[1:51:42] need to understand that he said i
[1:51:43] believe
[1:51:44] brother ryan was a prophet but i believe
[1:51:46] there are certain things he didn't
[1:51:47] understand about
[1:51:48] what he was preaching okay
[1:51:53] i don't understand how corn grows
[1:51:56] i've just witnessed it for 30 years grow
[1:52:00] hallelujah i can't explain to you why
[1:52:02] what certain roots do
[1:52:03] what certain things in a corn plant but
[1:52:06] what i want to know is in the end of the
[1:52:07] year when that's all harvested
[1:52:09] and there's big oil ears on there and i
[1:52:11] dig it up and all these roots are out
[1:52:12] there
[1:52:13] i i don't know the scientist says this
[1:52:16] root did this and this root did this and
[1:52:18] this root was designed to take up this
[1:52:20] mineral in this mineral but not this one
[1:52:23] okay cool
[1:52:26] what root is that i don't know
[1:52:30] but it doesn't
[1:52:34] and i don't know the greek now i don't
[1:52:38] know the
[1:52:38] arab and i don't know the hebrew
[1:52:41] and i don't know all the signs and
[1:52:43] wonders that are taking on
[1:52:45] but i do know the ones that i've
[1:52:46] witnessed
[1:52:48] and i got to see them take place in my
[1:52:50] own life
[1:52:51] and i've got to come to the place that
[1:52:54] i've had people i called friends
[1:52:57] i've watched them get swallowed up
[1:53:01] and disappear from the congregation
[1:53:07] sorry to close on this kind of a note
[1:53:10] that maybe we ought to have a little
[1:53:12] godly fear that we would flee from those
[1:53:15] things
[1:53:16] so we don't have to worry about being
[1:53:18] swallowed up our own self
[1:53:20] amen stand steadfast in the word
[1:53:25] satan cannot that roaring lion cannot
[1:53:27] defeat you
[1:53:28] if you stand stead fast in
[1:53:32] the word hallelujah
[1:53:35] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:53:38] i i will close i'm sorry i took way more
[1:53:41] than five minutes there
[1:53:43] hey man i i do you know brother brown
[1:53:45] did have a sense of humor
[1:53:46] he gets up starts i i believe that is
[1:53:49] lean not
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:52] but brown says well you know billy told
[1:53:54] me i'll just paraphrase this down billy
[1:53:56] told me i only had about
[1:53:58] 15 minutes tonight because i used it all
[1:54:00] up last night
[1:54:03] well hallelujah i just borrowed from
[1:54:06] brother chris and brother david
[1:54:08] i know they're kind enough to loan me
[1:54:10] some time hallelujah
[1:54:12] oh let me say this again my brother and
[1:54:14] sister
[1:54:16] might not be exactly right but we see
[1:54:19] the earth consuming we see people
[1:54:22] falling away
[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:24] it won't hurt us come on let me just
[1:54:26] share this with you from the depths of
[1:54:28] my heart it won't hurt us to have a
[1:54:29] little godly fear
[1:54:31] of being consumed by this present fear
[1:54:33] i'm not talking about being deceived oh
[1:54:35] i'm afraid of being deceived now the
[1:54:36] word says you can't be deceived
[1:54:38] but i'll tell you what it would be that
[1:54:40] little bit of godly fear that
[1:54:41] lord it would be the seducing spirits of
[1:54:44] of this and that whatever weakness it
[1:54:46] would be
[1:54:47] the lord i don't even want to go there
[1:54:48] i'm going to flee from it flee from the
[1:54:50] very appearance of evil
[1:54:52] amen because i see it consuming what
[1:54:54] you're doing is
[1:54:55] acknowledging that satan when he gets
[1:54:58] his hands on people
[1:54:59] can make them disappear from the
[1:55:01] congregation
[1:55:03] some reappear some never do i'm a son of
[1:55:06] god i heard the call
[1:55:08] i'm not leaving the congregation
[1:55:11] hallelujah yep we got two options today
[1:55:14] saints we're either going to be taken up
[1:55:15] or swallowed up
[1:55:17] hallelujah i'm gonna be taken up
[1:55:19] hallelujah
[1:55:21] now you know sister emmy started the
[1:55:23] service off there the pre-service music
[1:55:26] and
[1:55:26] it wasn't really in my thoughts but it
[1:55:28] struck me so strong just felt like the
[1:55:30] holy spirit moved right in the office
[1:55:32] just tears in my eyes he hath forgiven
[1:55:34] me
[1:55:35] oh to think about that my brother and
