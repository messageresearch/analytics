[36:51] of that
[36:53] and we have known and believed the love
[36:56] we have known we have known hallelujah
[37:00] and believe the love that god hath
[37:02] that god hath to us
[37:04] god
[37:06] is love
[37:08] and he that dwelleth in love
[37:11] dwelleth in god or we could say he that
[37:13] dwelleth in god dwelleth in love
[37:16] amen herein is our love made perfect
[37:19] complete mature
[37:21] in here in what here in him here in god
[37:24] in us
[37:25] herein is our love made perfect that we
[37:28] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[37:30] and that's our day because as he is
[37:34] hallelujah as he is
[37:37] and here in his love again as he is so
[37:40] are we
[37:42] in this world
[37:43] amen
[37:45] amen now just read verse 18 with it
[37:47] there's no fear in love but perfect love
[37:51] casteth out fear because fear hath
[37:53] torment he that feareth is not made
[37:55] perfect in love we love him because he
[37:58] first loved us
[38:00] you may be seated
[38:01] i'd like you to turn with me to matthew
[38:03] 24.
[38:11] and begin reading we'll read the 35th
[38:13] verse very familiar scripture
[38:15] but it's not how familiar the scripture
[38:18] is but
[38:19] is it revealed to us
[38:20] right and then he reveals it again
[38:23] and then he reveals it again
[38:25] we're glad we're familiar we can quote a
[38:27] lot of things by heart but that doesn't
[38:29] mean necessarily it's revealed to us
[38:32] amen amen but when it's quickened to us
[38:34] it's yours you're a part of that that's
[38:36] part of you
[38:37] amen amen
[38:39] so brother braham said whatever god can
[38:41] reveal is yours whatever reveals to you
[38:44] that's yours he said
[38:47] amen all right heaven and earth
[38:50] shall pass away
[38:53] so you might as well try to quit
[38:54] fighting trying to hold the earth in
[38:55] this place
[38:58] but realize that
[39:00] excuse me
[39:02] 35th
[39:03] 24 35 matthew 24 35 i'm sorry heaven or
[39:06] earth shall pass away but my
[39:09] words you notice that's in plural yeah
[39:13] but my words
[39:15] of course that's more than one word
[39:16] that's his words
[39:18] but it's also a great deeper meaning
[39:20] than that
[39:22] because his word is a thought expressed
[39:25] his words has to be his thought first to
[39:27] be expressed we'll come to that in just
[39:29] a moment
[39:31] but my word shall not pass away brother
[39:33] branham said this about that scripture
[39:34] and if you be that word
[39:38] you cannot pass away either
[39:40] amen so so it goes deeper than
[39:44] than on the letter
[39:46] the letter has to become alive
[39:49] has to come from letter to flesh
[39:52] amen
[39:53] because when it becomes that way you are
[39:56] always a part of it and god's obligated
[39:58] to his word
[40:01] amen you say well god's not obligated me
[40:03] he is
[40:04] to the word
[40:06] he will not leave you he's got to take
[40:09] you
[40:10] amen because you're a part of him
[40:14] he's not complete without you
[40:16] amen love's not complete without you
[40:19] amen are you hearing me god is not
[40:21] complete love is not complete without
[40:23] you
[40:26] amen so where is the complete revelation
[40:28] of love laying
[40:30] amen in the house
[40:33] in his house what's his house his body
[40:37] where he placed his name
[40:39] where he's worshipped
[40:41] you can't worship him in any other body
[40:43] any other church but his church
[40:45] you can't worship anywhere else
[40:48] amen
[40:49] you have to be in him to worship him
[40:52] to give him proper worship and true
[40:54] worshipper is the word quickened or the
[40:56] dynamics upon the word mechanics and
[40:59] bringing the two together as a true
[41:00] worshiper
[41:02] amen because that brings and produces
[41:04] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[41:07] and forever amen
[41:10] now i want you to go with one more
[41:12] scripture for me just for we got a few
[41:15] more but philippians 2
[41:18] philippians 2 verse
[41:20] chapter 2 verse 13.
[41:24] very familiar scripture again
[41:26] but i want to read verse 12 with it
[41:27] wherefore my beloved as you have always
[41:29] obeyed not in my presence only but now
[41:32] much more in my absence work out your
[41:35] own salvation with fear and trembling
[41:38] amen we could we could spend time on
[41:40] that but if you want to make a reference
[41:42] to work out you can go to john 6 27 and
[41:45] 29 29 said to do that what must we do to
[41:49] do your works believe on him who god has
[41:51] sent
[41:52] so if we're going to work out then we
[41:54] got to believe on him whom god has sent
[41:57] amen believe the word promise for the
[41:59] hour the message of the hour amen the
[42:02] word for the hour then
[42:04] then work out your own salvation with
[42:06] fear and trembling for it is
[42:09] not will be or has been but it is god
[42:12] which worketh in you
[42:15] for it is god which worketh in you both
[42:18] to will
[42:20] and to do
[42:22] you so you see
[42:23] david's out of the question
[42:26] not david's ideas not david's thoughts
[42:28] not david's thinking about it it's his
[42:31] will of himself living in me work
[42:33] speaking and doing his will through me
[42:37] so he's in control or he isn't
[42:40] amen is that right then so therefore
[42:44] for it is god which worketh in you both
[42:47] to will and to do of
[42:49] his
[42:50] good pleasure
[42:52] amen
[42:54] amen all right
[42:56] now
[43:02] going back to this
[43:04] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[43:06] word shall not pass away
[43:09] here's what the prophet said in the
[43:10] beginning was god he wasn't even god
[43:12] then no god is an object of worship
[43:16] only thing was
[43:18] only thing he was was the eternal and in
[43:20] him were attributes and those attributes
[43:23] were thoughts
[43:25] all right and those thoughts was
[43:27] expressed to words
[43:30] amen
[43:32] now the prophet said and we know that
[43:34] you were existing in his thoughts
[43:37] you had to be in his thinking of himself
[43:39] the prophet you were in the thinking of
[43:41] himself
[43:44] and therefore that makes you eternal
[43:46] right
[43:48] amen so yeah
[43:50] if you if you think i'm too bold in this
[43:52] but i am eternal life because i've
[43:53] raised from the dead
[43:56] already
[43:58] i raised with him when he raised
[44:00] amen oh i'm still in this body
[44:03] this will be changed but i'm passed from
[44:05] death to life
[44:07] how do i know that because of his spirit
[44:09] that is in me keeping the word
[44:12] i'm identified by that spirit keeping
[44:14] that word believing that word and seeing
[44:17] the word and performing the word through
[44:19] me
[44:20] it's the same thing through you
[44:22] amen all right so
[44:26] you was in he said those thoughts were
[44:28] expressed the word and the word was made
[44:30] manifest
[44:32] amen now he said what is it it's all god
[44:36] becoming tangible amen
[44:38] he said you are a part of god
[44:43] amen i have these other quotes here but
[44:45] i but i could well just a moment
[44:48] i'll just just tell you right here
[44:51] he said
[44:55] you christians
[44:56] as i said before but here's where you
[44:58] christians were his thoughts
[45:02] all right
[45:03] okay
[45:04] you were in christ
[45:06] amen
[45:07] and if you are eternal the only way you
[45:09] could have eternal life because you
[45:10] always was
[45:13] amen hallelujah go tell that to some of
[45:16] the seminaries
[45:17] tell him i always was
[45:20] so what are you talking about he said
[45:22] how can you be always was when we know
[45:24] you're a man jesus said i don't judge as
[45:26] a man
[45:27] i don't judge the outward i i you you
[45:29] judge me as a man i judge no person by
[45:32] the flesh he said you judged by the
[45:33] flesh i'm not judging by the flesh
[45:37] amen
[45:38] someday i'm going to preach on
[45:39] emotionalism versus emotion
[45:43] there's a difference
[45:45] amen you can't base your salvation upon
[45:48] any emotion
[45:49] because if you do it's emotionalism
[45:52] i'll just drop that in
[45:55] amen
[45:56] we don't want the denominational
[45:58] emotionalism
[46:01] we want the pure word to have its way
[46:04] we are made to have emotion but you
[46:06] can't base your salvation and your
[46:08] eternal security and the and being
[46:10] filled with the holy ghost upon any
[46:12] emotion
[46:16] hallelujah
[46:17] amen even the new birth brother branham
[46:19] said the revelation of the new birth
[46:21] without sensation
[46:25] hello
[46:26] did you know that amen
[46:29] so see it's it's not based and there's
[46:31] emotion with it i'm not saying you get
[46:32] filled the holy ghost would be some
[46:33] emotion around you but that's not the
[46:35] evidence it's the revelation of his word
[46:37] in you it's a knowing not a not an
[46:40] emotion
[46:42] brother abraham said when you're seeking
[46:44] the holy ghost look for something
[46:46] that is that he said that is true
[46:51] amen a knowing he said look for that
[46:54] knowing
[46:55] all right now i'm off my subject but
[46:57] let's come back here it was god's
[46:59] thoughts he becoming tangible you are a
[47:01] part of god jesus came to redeem those
[47:03] that was put on the lamb's book of life
[47:05] before the foundation of the world i
[47:08] like what brother said i am that book
[47:11] exactly who we are that's exactly who we
[47:13] are because that's our revelation of
[47:16] christ the mystery
[47:18] of himself
[47:19] was sealed in that book it was hidden
[47:21] until this day
[47:23] what for so we could go home in a
[47:25] rapture
[47:27] so he kept it away from satan see he'd
[47:29] done great damage with he got a hold of
[47:31] that but he can't get a hold of it now
[47:34] amen
[47:36] because he has no right he can't get
[47:37] into it see he can try to pervert it but
[47:39] it's too late
[47:41] amen all right
[47:43] now
[47:44] and he said but he redeemed those that
[47:46] were put on the lamb's book of life
[47:48] before the foundation of the world
[47:50] it was in god's thoughts
[47:53] it was in god's thoughts and that's what
[47:56] he come to redeem
[47:58] what did he come to redeem god's
[47:59] thoughts
[48:01] you
[48:02] the thought of god
[48:05] amen all right he come to redeem them as
[48:08] soon as that strikes them
[48:10] amen what's it striking is striking that
[48:13] thought is striking that thought that's
[48:15] made word is striking the seed
[48:18] yes amen all right so it strikes them
[48:22] soon as it strikes them they see it
[48:25] he said because the life
[48:28] the life
[48:29] is in there
[48:32] amen all right all right now
[48:36] so
[48:41] his words can never pass away now
[48:45] let's go over here to saint john 14 20 a
[48:47] moment
[48:48] very familiar scripture again
[48:52] but we're speaking of
[48:56] herein
[48:57] we're speaking of bride coming
[49:00] of christ
[49:03] the word the living word
[49:06] is in our midst
[49:08] the living word is in our midst
[49:11] the living word has been made flesh
[49:13] today
[49:14] is in flesh today
[49:16] amen i'm not saying these would be
[49:18] cliche it has to be a revelation
[49:22] you can speak it but you can't explain
[49:23] it to somebody
[49:26] there's no way i can explain that
[49:28] but it's it's either revelation reality
[49:31] or it isn't i thought you're on the road
[49:32] sergey here you are sitting here
[49:35] god bless you
[49:36] good to see you brother
[49:39] amen
[49:40] now
[49:42] he must have stepped out and come back
[49:44] travels like a thought you know
[49:48] all right now
[49:50] where was i
[49:51] sorry all right 14
[49:53] chapter 14 of john
[49:55] verse 20 at that day
[49:59] this is the day when the seals the
[50:01] sealed men tore off
[50:03] amen and
[50:04] and the and what hasn't been written in
[50:06] the word that john was forbidden to
[50:08] write
[50:09] has now made revealed to you personally
[50:13] that's why it's still in mystery because
[50:15] it's not to everybody it's to you
[50:19] that's the seventh seal
[50:21] all right now he said
[50:24] he said
[50:25] at that day you shall know
[50:29] that i am in my father
[50:31] and ye and me
[50:34] and i
[50:35] in you
[50:37] now we don't see there are two or three
[50:38] gods we only see one god god above us
[50:41] god with us god in us
[50:44] it's right there in that scripture it
[50:46] testifies of who you are
[50:50] when you see that by revelation there's
[50:52] nothing can take that from you
[50:54] i don't care how many times you fall or
[50:56] fail that cannot be removed
[51:01] amen a true revelation is always and let
[51:03] just make this statement a true
[51:05] revelation is always vindicated by the
[51:07] word
[51:09] you get a true revelation of the word
[51:10] it's got to tie in with the rest of the
[51:12] word
[51:14] and it won't leave what the prophet said
[51:18] all right okay now so you can have
[51:21] prophecies and all those things and
[51:22] that's fine to be true
[51:24] balaam had a true prophecy but he was a
[51:26] false prophet
[51:28] why because the word wasn't in him to
[51:30] recognize the season or the time
[51:34] so he worked contrary the word and yet
[51:36] and yet and yet said things and
[51:38] prophesied things that came to pass
[51:40] because he was anointed in his spirit
[51:42] but in his soul he was false
[51:46] amen that's exactly where it lays today
[51:51] amen the bible said try the spirits
[51:55] amen see if they be of god or not for
[51:57] every true spirit every true holy spirit
[52:01] if he dwells in you will bear witness
[52:03] with your spirit
[52:07] how will that holy ghost who is the word
[52:08] bear witness to anything but the word
[52:13] see you can't you can't make it lie
[52:15] if he's in you the words in you it's the
[52:18] holy spirit it's the word in spirit form
[52:22] amen so it's got to be in the soul
[52:26] amen so the words got to be laying there
[52:29] and you can't make it you didn't make it
[52:30] happen you had nothing to do with it
[52:33] you didn't have anything to do with
[52:34] coming in this world you have a choice
[52:35] of parents you have a choice of where
[52:37] you'd be born you had none of that but
[52:39] god had the choice
[52:41] and he predestinated us
[52:44] that's right amen that's right
[52:47] amen all right
[52:49] so it takes all the work and strain out
[52:51] of it
[52:53] and that's what god wants us to do
[52:55] to recognize ourselves as weaklings and
[52:57] by recognizing that we can surrender to
[53:00] one the strong amen
[53:02] and that's our lord
[53:04] amen
[53:06] amen that's why god wants us to depend
[53:08] upon him
[53:10] not to be independent but dependent upon
[53:13] him
[53:14] all right
[53:16] to about too many times we fear because
[53:19] reasoning comes in well if i'm dependent
[53:21] upon him how will this be in this being
[53:23] butted butt and butt butt button but
[53:27] there's no buts about it just do what
[53:28] god tells you to do
[53:30] don't have fear something's going to
[53:31] happen
[53:32] just do what he says do
[53:37] amen
[53:38] all right
[53:39] now
[53:45] so we are his thoughts that were
[53:47] redeemed all right everybody get that
[53:51] okay
[53:52] now
[53:56] there's some things here i want to share
[53:57] with you
[53:59] he said now brother branham is speaking
[54:01] here he says now maybe you
[54:03] you mean
[54:05] you mean with all the intelligence you
[54:07] know to speak it you believe it now he
[54:10] says you can he says with all the
[54:11] intelligence you have
[54:13] you can you can speak the word
[54:17] you believe it
[54:19] that's in your head
[54:21] but remember
[54:22] there's a subconscious down there that's
[54:24] got to say the same thing
[54:28] you can think about it in your head but
[54:29] if the soul doesn't speak back the same
[54:31] thing
[54:33] the amen
[54:36] you just got an intellectual conception
[54:38] of the message
[54:39] it takes the holy spirit in you to get a
[54:42] real revelation of the message
[54:46] or other words of the word it takes the
[54:48] holy spirit in you to make the word come
[54:50] alive
[54:54] the message isn't isn't a man's message
[54:56] the message is the son of man's message
[54:59] it's his word
[55:01] all right
[55:02] now he said but he said remember there's
[55:06] a subconscious you say i believe it i
[55:07] believe the word but to remember the
[55:09] subconscious now that's got to say the
[55:11] same thing if it doesn't you'll never
[55:12] get nowhere
[55:15] you might read the bible say well here
[55:17] brother brown the bible says that's true
[55:19] that's exactly right nobody's denying
[55:21] what the bible said
[55:23] okay that's true that's right that's
[55:25] where people say well i believe jesus
[55:27] christ is the son of god and i'm saved i
[55:29] just read it here
[55:32] they say well i believe that jesus
[55:34] christ is son of god and i'm saved
[55:35] that's an intellectual
[55:37] speaking
[55:39] it doesn't do you any good unless that
[55:41] becomes real in you
[55:44] then you speak it the bible said it's a
[55:46] confession of faith not the confession
[55:48] of your your
[55:50] your intellects
[55:52] it's got to be revealed to you it's got
[55:54] to be real in you you've got to be a
[55:56] real believer
[55:59] and something's revealed it's not you
[56:01] speaking it it's him speaking it's that
[56:03] faith speaking
[56:08] amen all right so he says how do you
[56:10] know he's the son of god
[56:14] he said well a son of god and i'm saying
[56:16] but brother brahm said how do you know
[56:18] he's the son of god
[56:19] well the bible said so see and i say
[56:21] well how do you know he's the son of god
[56:23] mother said so
[56:25] the preacher said so
[56:27] well they're right
[56:28] but how do you know
[56:30] the bible said that you cannot know
[56:32] until you have received the holy ghost
[56:35] you're only taking somebody else's word
[56:40] now i don't have to i'm talking to
[56:42] everybody here including young people
[56:44] you'll never go anywhere on your mother
[56:46] and father's religion or their or their
[56:49] salvation or their revelation
[56:52] i was raised the message therefore i'm
[56:53] going into rapture no you're not you're
[56:55] not going anywhere until you're born
[56:56] again
[57:00] and the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[57:02] new birth
[57:03] and you can't even start growing into
[57:05] his stature until that happens
[57:09] that's right
[57:11] you've got to receive the holy ghost
[57:13] you've got to receive the seal of god

[58:22] or you're only taking what the minister
[58:24] says the minister's right or some other
[58:26] good person said they're right but you
[58:28] and his individual has to know that
[58:30] jesus is the christ until the holy ghost
[58:33] has brought it to you that's right
[58:37] you won't know it until he brings it to
[58:38] you

[1:00:15] the first thing you know

[1:00:19] in where right the soul
[1:00:23] that whole post isn't in your spirit
[1:00:26] you know you know there's you know
[1:00:28] you've seen the three circles
[1:00:30] flesh
[1:00:31] second circle spirit
[1:00:33] heart but in that heart
[1:00:36] is a soul
[1:00:38] your spirit
[1:00:39] can can be anointed with the genuine
[1:00:42] holy spirit but if that soul doesn't
[1:00:44] have that whole post there
[1:00:47] if it's not born again or if it's or if
[1:00:49] it can't or well it will or can't be
[1:00:51] born again if that whole post isn't
[1:00:53] there
[1:00:56] amen there's no keeping power right
[1:01:00] all right so if there's no hold post
[1:01:03] there she'll say hello
[1:01:07] and he's got curly hair and pretty nice
[1:01:10] looking maybe athletic bodybuilder
[1:01:12] whatever it may be
[1:01:15] okay he's a nice looking fellow you know
[1:01:18] curly hair nice kind nice looking
[1:01:20] straight shouldered young man maybe
[1:01:22] tried to live right she started walking
[1:01:24] up to him even a preacher
[1:01:27] we see a lot of preachers fall
[1:01:31] because of women in message churches
[1:01:35] all right even a preacher and the first
[1:01:37] thing you know what is it
[1:01:39] this out here the flesh is desire flesh
[1:01:42] desire and the spirit down here yet
[1:01:45] anointed
[1:01:47] what's it anointed with the genuine holy
[1:01:49] spirit
[1:01:50] your spirit can be anointed with the
[1:01:52] genuine holy spirit
[1:01:56] but if there's no hope post in the soul
[1:02:00] all right because the rain falls on the
[1:02:01] just and the unjust
[1:02:04] bring the rain the same rain brings the
[1:02:07] weed up
[1:02:08] or the wild wheat and the same rain
[1:02:10] brings the
[1:02:12] the real wheat
[1:02:14] to its maturity
[1:02:17] think of that
[1:02:19] all right now it's not another rain that
[1:02:22] does that not another sun
[1:02:26] you ask any farmer how'd that weed get
[1:02:28] there
[1:02:29] oh there was a seed
[1:02:30] well do you mean the same rain brought
[1:02:32] the weed up
[1:02:33] yeah it was ordained to be a weed
[1:02:36] but the other was ordained and planted
[1:02:38] by the farmer
[1:02:40] by the husband is that right
[1:02:42] all right now you know i won't go any
[1:02:43] further than that you know how the
[1:02:44] prophet seen that vision and i seen one
[1:02:46] in white going sowing seed and one
[1:02:48] behind him coming in black sowing seed
[1:02:51] and the rains come and they both shouted
[1:02:53] and they both hallelujah and they both
[1:02:56] rejoiced in the rain
[1:02:57] the falling of the spirit but one could
[1:02:59] receive the word and be the word and the
[1:03:01] other couldn't
[1:03:03] that's a great mystery in this hour and
[1:03:05] brother branham said that's a mystery
[1:03:06] that had to be opened after the opening
[1:03:08] of those seals
[1:03:10] he said because you're going to need it
[1:03:11] someday
[1:03:12] because those two spirits can be so
[1:03:14] close because they're both anointed
[1:03:18] amen are you with me one that the word
[1:03:21] the spirit of the word the word being in
[1:03:23] you and those that don't have that word
[1:03:25] and yet anointed with the same holy
[1:03:26] ghost that you're anointed with
[1:03:28] and we believe in the anointing
[1:03:31] oh absolutely
[1:03:32] remember the soul controls the spirit
[1:03:36] and the spirit controls the body so if
[1:03:38] the whole post isn't there no matter
[1:03:40] what happens eventually it's come come
[1:03:41] around to what's in that soul
[1:03:46] that's exactly right all right now okay
[1:03:49] i don't want to spend a lot of time
[1:03:50] because i got just a limited amount so
[1:03:51] let me just go through this pretty quick
[1:03:55] now
[1:03:56] what is it out here the flesh desire the
[1:03:58] spirit down here yet anointed that's a
[1:04:00] little spirit second realm the spirit
[1:04:03] down here anointed it's anointed and
[1:04:05] it's saying don't do it don't do it
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:11] don't do it don't do it but what will it
[1:04:13] do it'll move right around there
[1:04:16] and there it goes
[1:04:20] but a genuine listen to the prophet now
[1:04:23] genuine born again son of god
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:29] watch that love in that soul
[1:04:32] christ the holy spirit in you but a
[1:04:34] genuine born again son of god amen you
[1:04:36] can't do it in yourself it's totally
[1:04:38] impossible for a red-blooded male to
[1:04:40] walk before a female like that without
[1:04:42] something taking place but when there is
[1:04:45] something on the inside that little born
[1:04:47] again something is here he said though
[1:04:50] that man might have shouted spoken
[1:04:52] tongues jump up and down and everything
[1:04:53] else anointed with the spirit done all
[1:04:56] the signs and wonders that god said in
[1:04:58] there by his spirit jesus said many will
[1:05:01] come to me in that day now i want to
[1:05:02] stop here a minute just because you jump
[1:05:04] up and down doesn't mean you're
[1:05:06] lost
[1:05:09] because you may baptize the holy ghost
[1:05:11] and jump up and down speak in tongues or
[1:05:13] whatever and have a genuine baptism
[1:05:17] so what's the prophet trying to say you
[1:05:18] can have that without the other
[1:05:21] so don't don't think you're if you say
[1:05:22] well i'm afraid to jump up and down i'm
[1:05:24] afraid to say amen hallelujah nonsense
[1:05:30] you understand
[1:05:33] amen i'm talking about the word on the
[1:05:35] inside of the soul
[1:05:36] when that when that holy ghost comes and
[1:05:38] anoints you and that quickens that word
[1:05:41] in there that's a birth that's a real
[1:05:42] true baptism in the soul on that word
[1:05:46] it takes the baptism upon the word seed
[1:05:49] planted there by god and when you have a
[1:05:51] desire for him it's a it's a deep
[1:05:53] calling to the deep there's got to be a
[1:05:55] deep to respond to that call
[1:05:58] you have a desire for him then god put
[1:06:00] that desire in you
[1:06:03] amen it's not religion this message is
[1:06:06] not religion
[1:06:08] this message is eternal life
[1:06:11] it's not religion
[1:06:13] it's not a works it's not a religion
[1:06:15] it's not a church-going affair we
[1:06:17] believe in going to church we believe
[1:06:18] and assemble together but it's a love
[1:06:20] affair
[1:06:21] with christ
[1:06:23] it's having christ in you alive in you
[1:06:27] amen and you say i want that i want that
[1:06:30] then that's for you god put that in your
[1:06:32] heart i don't care how it comes or how
[1:06:34] it happens when it comes just so you get
[1:06:37] it
[1:06:38] i mean they were pretty steamed up in
[1:06:40] the pentecost when they they threw the
[1:06:41] doors open they come out there drunk
[1:06:43] like drunk men
[1:06:44] but what happened they had the truth for
[1:06:47] that hour revealed in them
[1:06:50] promised
[1:06:51] i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[1:06:53] your sons and daughters etc etc see
[1:06:56] they had that they had that genuine
[1:06:59] filling of the holy ghost where the
[1:07:01] anointed you bet they were by the same
[1:07:03] holy spirit that that others can be
[1:07:05] anointed see see that's why the bible
[1:07:07] said when when brother brown preached
[1:07:09] anointed ones the end time
[1:07:12] he said what the bible say there'd be
[1:07:14] false prophets false teachers
[1:07:19] false christs
[1:07:22] that right false anointed ones what made
[1:07:24] them false they didn't have the word and
[1:07:26] the soul the anointing wasn't false
[1:07:30] when it said false it means that they
[1:07:32] didn't have the word for the hour there
[1:07:34] and because the anointing was real but
[1:07:37] it can only anoint them to do what's
[1:07:38] wrong
[1:07:40] but yet they could shout and dance and
[1:07:42] cast out devils by that spirit
[1:07:45] satan can't cast out himself
[1:07:49] amen there's only one thing cast out the
[1:07:50] devil and that's the holy ghost so
[1:07:52] nobody's speaking against the works part
[1:07:54] of it but can you receive the word for
[1:07:56] the hour can you see the message for the
[1:07:58] season
[1:08:01] amen that's what lives out of it
[1:08:04] all right now
[1:08:05] all right so
[1:08:08] i mean you could take a whole message
[1:08:09] just on that and i don't want to spend
[1:08:11] too much more time but i've got to go
[1:08:12] through this
[1:08:14] but down on the inside of that man
[1:08:16] see
[1:08:19] anointed with the spirit done all the
[1:08:20] works signs and wonders there is many
[1:08:22] will come to me in that day lord haven't
[1:08:24] i prophesied in your name haven't i cast
[1:08:26] out devils in your name and many good
[1:08:28] works and a lot of things see but he
[1:08:30] said depart from me you worker of
[1:08:31] iniquity i never knew you
[1:08:36] knowing
[1:08:37] is something he knew before the world
[1:08:39] began he didn't know you
[1:08:41] in other words knowing is like a
[1:08:42] marriage
[1:08:45] you weren't in me
[1:08:47] i wasn't in you
[1:08:50] you did all these things but you turned
[1:08:52] my word down
[1:08:55] amen all right you you chose to take a
[1:08:58] religion and chose to take that instead
[1:09:00] of my of the truth instead of let me
[1:09:03] fill you see you denied that filling you
[1:09:06] wouldn't proceed any further when you're
[1:09:08] told you must be filled
[1:09:10] and if you're telling you must be filled
[1:09:11] we pointed out in the scripture you
[1:09:13] should be doing everything you can in
[1:09:14] desperation to get that
[1:09:19] that's right and i say well i'm okay
[1:09:20] because the devil will reason with it
[1:09:22] he'll tell you well you're all right you
[1:09:24] know you go to church and and you wear
[1:09:26] long dresses and have long hair and and
[1:09:28] you do this and you do that
[1:09:31] why you're okay
[1:09:33] you sweet little thing
[1:09:36] without the holy ghost you're nothing
[1:09:38] you've got to have him in you you've got
[1:09:41] to have the token
[1:09:43] or you're not going home in a rapture
[1:09:46] all right
[1:09:49] all right now
[1:09:51] so but down on the inside of that man if
[1:09:53] that little thai post is there that seed
[1:09:55] of god that thai post there that seed of
[1:09:58] god that was predestinated before the
[1:10:00] foundation world i don't care what takes
[1:10:02] place it holds him it's there to stay
[1:10:05] so the word then becomes in you it's
[1:10:07] your ultimate the word is the ultimate
[1:10:09] it's the last word it's the ultimate
[1:10:11] it's the amen
[1:10:14] amen all right
[1:10:16] because
[1:10:17] we go beyond reasoning we don't lean to
[1:10:19] our own understanding faith
[1:10:21] doesn't reason at all
[1:10:24] faith believes it faith
[1:10:26] faith is revelation and revelation is
[1:10:28] the substance of things hoped for and
[1:10:32] the evidence of things not seen
[1:10:34] you know it is something you know you
[1:10:36] something you have it's something
[1:10:37] tangible
[1:10:39] it's real it's just as real more real to
[1:10:41] you than anything else it's that real
[1:10:44] you have it you know it the promise
[1:10:46] gives it to you christ in you is the
[1:10:49] hope of glory christ in you is your
[1:10:51] assurance christ in you is substance
[1:10:55] it's a person
[1:10:57] eternal life is a person
[1:10:59] and when you have that person you're led
[1:11:01] and controlled by eternal life
[1:11:04] that's your head that's your control
[1:11:07] that's what leads you that's what guides
[1:11:08] you is eternal life the person of
[1:11:11] eternal life which is jesus christ and
[1:11:13] he hasn't changed
[1:11:15] he doesn't come down here and do
[1:11:17] something different he keeps what he did
[1:11:20] did to someone else he does to another
[1:11:22] when the same conditions met
[1:11:25] amen
[1:11:26] he can't he's not a respecter of person
[1:11:29] amen so
[1:11:31] so he said it's faith is just as
[1:11:34] positive as your eyesight see and faith
[1:11:36] works by love you could go to galatians
[1:11:38] 5 6 we don't have time to go there
[1:11:40] but
[1:11:41] faith works by love and you can't have
[1:11:42] faith without love
[1:11:46] amen because
[1:11:47] faith is love's incentive
[1:11:49] that's faith
[1:11:51] i mean that's love express it expresses
[1:11:54] itself through
[1:11:56] revelation through
[1:11:58] faith
[1:12:01] all right
[1:12:03] so nothing can take it out i don't care
[1:12:05] if god says you're healed and it's
[1:12:07] revealed to your heel doctors can stand
[1:12:08] there and say you're dying you can just
[1:12:11] go on with a smile on your face because
[1:12:13] you know you can
[1:12:14] that's how positive faith is
[1:12:16] wherefore brother and be of good courage
[1:12:18] i believe that god what he said it'll be
[1:12:20] just as he showed me paul said nobody be
[1:12:23] lost in this ship god revealed that to
[1:12:25] me
[1:12:26] amen and and it's and it's known to me
[1:12:30] and he showed me brother braham said
[1:12:31] he'll show his bride
[1:12:34] amen that's what he said i'll show the
[1:12:36] bride and she'll follow it she'll do it
[1:12:39] i show her and she she ha and she does
[1:12:41] it in my name what is it it's faith
[1:12:46] he said the same harmony was to exist
[1:12:48] it's revelation to paul revelation to
[1:12:50] brother branham it's a revelation to the
[1:12:52] bride you live by faith the things you
[1:12:54] do is by faith
[1:12:58] amen that's right and anything contrary
[1:13:01] to that word because that's where god's
[1:13:03] faith comes from is out of the word so
[1:13:06] anything contrary to that word
[1:13:08] leave it alone
[1:13:11] see
[1:13:12] it's not for you don't reason with the
[1:13:14] word take him at his word
[1:13:16] ask god to reveal the word to you make
[1:13:18] it real to you
[1:13:22] all right now
[1:13:26] he says it's that inside man see
[1:13:29] he said the real generating question
[1:13:31] christian will cope with that inside man
[1:13:34] all right because you've now you're
[1:13:35] setting because you've accepted now
[1:13:37] you're sitting in heavenly places in
[1:13:39] christ jesus you see where your position
[1:13:41] is in heavenly places satan has a right
[1:13:44] to come up there and accuse but he can't
[1:13:46] move you off your place
[1:13:48] how many have been accused by the devil
[1:13:50] he can't move you off your position your
[1:13:52] position is in heavenly places in christ
[1:13:56] jesus
[1:13:57] the believer's position
[1:13:59] and he's going to come up there as long
[1:14:00] as he can until the bride goes up he's
[1:14:02] cast out
[1:14:03] we read the scripture right in
[1:14:04] revelations 12 i think it was sunday
[1:14:07] when he when the when the holy ghost
[1:14:09] goes up he's cast out he has no more
[1:14:12] right to that spot but until then he has
[1:14:15] a right to come before the very throne
[1:14:16] of god and make the accusing of the
[1:14:18] other side but remember
[1:14:20] the judgments come forth the judgment
[1:14:23] has judged you pure in christ
[1:14:25] so nothing can take you out of that like
[1:14:28] like the devil comes up they did this
[1:14:29] they did that but god says i have no
[1:14:31] record of that
[1:14:32] i'm the judge and i say case is
[1:14:34] dismissed it's been dismissed since the
[1:14:36] foundation of the world
[1:14:39] amen because i knew they would accept it
[1:14:41] when they received it it was all clean
[1:14:43] nothing there nothing against them
[1:14:45] there's no record
[1:14:47] you're justified
[1:14:50] amen brother jason justified
[1:14:53] yeah
[1:14:54] that's right as though you never did it
[1:14:56] in the first place and you didn't
[1:14:58] you were in christ
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:01] amen so
[1:15:03] christ and you identifies your perfect
[1:15:05] you're in the sinless one how can you be
[1:15:08] how you're sinless how can you not be
[1:15:10] sinless if you're in the sinless one
[1:15:13] that's your position
[1:15:16] amen all right now
[1:15:18] the lord shall never fail little triumph
[1:15:20] no matter what it is
[1:15:22] then i know there's something inside of
[1:15:25] all reasoning something inside of all
[1:15:27] emotions something else like it there
[1:15:29] was an inside man that held in that hour
[1:15:31] he's talking about his own test
[1:15:33] when he's when his daughter his son
[1:15:35] brother
[1:15:37] wife their daughter laid there and he
[1:15:39] said there was something inside of all
[1:15:41] emotion there's something beyond that
[1:15:44] something that inside of reasoning
[1:15:46] because the devil gave him a good reason
[1:15:47] and spoke 99 percent
[1:15:50] right that's truth is that right all
[1:15:53] right then he said but there was
[1:15:55] something else there there was an inside
[1:15:57] man that held in that hour
[1:16:00] notice he did not hold it
[1:16:02] it held him
[1:16:07] amen it held in that hour nothing else
[1:16:09] could have done it every reason
[1:16:11] everything could be showed everything
[1:16:12] could prove that it was wrong and i was
[1:16:14] in the wrong but the word of god that
[1:16:17] was predestinated before the foundation
[1:16:19] of the world held on the inside amen
[1:16:23] amen that's it
[1:16:25] all right
[1:16:26] brother sister let me tell you the only
[1:16:28] thing don't try to reason it out don't
[1:16:30] try to do it just kind of cope up but
[1:16:33] just wait before the lord tell something
[1:16:35] way down on the inside
[1:16:39] amen
[1:16:40] on the inside of that man
[1:16:43] now brother brahm said i went into those
[1:16:45] cycles those five senses outer realm
[1:16:48] inner realm and the inside of the inside
[1:16:50] he said we know that's the holiest of
[1:16:52] holies
[1:16:53] you'll never see who you really are
[1:16:54] until you enter there
[1:16:56] when you enter there you're face to face
[1:16:58] with who you are
[1:17:00] the shekinah himself the glory of god
[1:17:02] himself god himself
[1:17:07] amen you've got to go in that little
[1:17:09] room
[1:17:10] you've got to go all the way in not just
[1:17:12] hang out here in the second realm of
[1:17:14] sanctification you can shout under
[1:17:15] sanctification the old methodist shout
[1:17:17] thought they had the holy ghost i saw my
[1:17:19] grandmother shout the storm up and fall
[1:17:21] on the floor and and
[1:17:24] they had to put water on them and
[1:17:26] everything else to wake him up
[1:17:29] but she went on believe the message too
[1:17:33] you see
[1:17:35] but they thought well we do that we got
[1:17:36] the holy ghost there was more to come
[1:17:38] there was a holy ghost but then the holy
[1:17:39] ghost made way for something else
[1:17:41] for himself
[1:17:43] we'll get into that in part four
[1:17:45] amen so that's what we want to go into
[1:17:47] but here look
[1:17:49] then on the inside of that man
[1:17:52] is a man called spirit on the inside of
[1:17:54] the outer realm flesh is a man called
[1:17:56] spirit
[1:17:57] all right that's what you are that's
[1:17:58] what you were before you came into flesh
[1:18:00] you were made in the image of god
[1:18:05] see
[1:18:06] all right then that's then that fell
[1:18:09] are you with me
[1:18:11] then
[1:18:13] that spirit that come from sexual
[1:18:15] was allowed by god
[1:18:19] someday you'd be totally changed see
[1:18:22] all right we'll get into all that right
[1:18:24] now on the inside of that man is a man
[1:18:26] called spirit and he has five senses and
[1:18:28] what is it it's reasoning memory
[1:18:30] conscious affection
[1:18:32] and imagination
[1:18:34] that's those five senses
[1:18:37] and brother brahms said think thought
[1:18:39] thought love and he says it in other
[1:18:40] places right down the line so you know
[1:18:42] he's talking about now you can't think
[1:18:44] with your body you think with your mind
[1:18:46] that's the spirit realm and there is
[1:18:48] where too many christians only stop
[1:18:53] they can they can just like the corn in
[1:18:55] the field or the weed in the field
[1:18:58] they can be anointed with the same holy
[1:19:00] spirit that the real believers anointed
[1:19:02] with but down on the inside of that next
[1:19:05] realm the third realm is the soul
[1:19:07] that's predestinated of god and there is
[1:19:11] where the real seed germ lays in there
[1:19:14] the real seed germ
[1:19:16] there is the real gift
[1:19:20] you with me now watch what he says the
[1:19:22] real gift is in your soul down there see
[1:19:26] that was born of god
[1:19:30] and that controls the whole thing to the
[1:19:32] word of god
[1:19:34] and the will of god and there you grow
[1:19:37] up that's what i want to go into later
[1:19:39] i'm kind of hitting this high point i'm
[1:19:41] going to go back and pick it up from
[1:19:42] your birth
[1:19:44] because we have to come in this hour the
[1:19:46] message is the coming of the headstone
[1:19:50] the capstone
[1:19:53] amen
[1:19:54] all right
[1:19:55] which is himself
[1:19:58] all right so he said
[1:20:01] so there's where the real seed germ lays
[1:20:04] and the whole thing keeps the whole
[1:20:05] thing to the word of god the will of god
[1:20:07] and there you grow up see then you're a
[1:20:09] son and daughter of god
[1:20:12] then he said see then you're a son and
[1:20:15] daughter of god you're a child of god
[1:20:17] when you're birthed
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:22] god isn't gonna he has to take his son
[1:20:24] i'm getting a little ahead of myself but
[1:20:26] god has to take his son and purr and
[1:20:27] purr and correct him and chastise him
[1:20:30] and go through all kinds of tests and
[1:20:32] trials just to bring the virtues forward
[1:20:35] hello
[1:20:36] because he's got to grow into one
[1:20:38] stature that's christ in him
[1:20:41] he the word christ in you the birth
[1:20:45] remember prophet said before the seals
[1:20:47] were opened the astronomic of heavens
[1:20:49] five stars lined up you notice recently
[1:20:51] they said five stars are lining up
[1:20:55] amen
[1:20:56] all right and he said it's grace to what
[1:20:58] the bride he said it was an infant bride
[1:21:00] coming forth
[1:21:02] the astronomic of heaven is announcing
[1:21:03] her approach 62
[1:21:07] an infant bride coming forth well what
[1:21:09] had to open up to bring her to maturity
[1:21:11] the seals
[1:21:13] the message of the seventh angel
[1:21:17] everything would point at catching your
[1:21:18] attention for that voice
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:22] all right the message of the hour
[1:21:26] all right now because you can't mature
[1:21:28] without that
[1:21:30] everything can be brought up to it's
[1:21:32] it's it's restoration but there's one
[1:21:34] thing still lacking
[1:21:37] there can be no rapturing faith without
[1:21:39] the opening of those seals
[1:21:42] amen all right so he said
[1:21:46] he said well i belong to church
[1:21:48] he said what are you you're a child of
[1:21:50] god you're growing up you're a son
[1:21:52] you're son of god coming forth and you
[1:21:54] see the word says i should do this i
[1:21:56] should be born again well i belong to
[1:21:58] church that don't mean one thing right
[1:22:01] well i'm ma i'm uh i'm uh i'll just i'll
[1:22:03] just put it where we are today i'm a
[1:22:05] message
[1:22:06] my mother's a messy believer i'm i'm a
[1:22:08] message believer that's good for your
[1:22:09] mother and i'm not i'm not i'm not
[1:22:12] denying a believer but are you a real
[1:22:14] believer you can profess the message you
[1:22:16] can say you believe it i just i just
[1:22:18] told you you can have a head knowledge
[1:22:20] of that
[1:22:21] but until you meet the message himself
[1:22:26] did you catch that till you meet the
[1:22:27] message until you meet love himself
[1:22:30] how are you going to have agape love
[1:22:32] without him living in you
[1:22:34] you can have feeling you love you can
[1:22:35] you do good works you can do work works
[1:22:37] works works and outwork any message
[1:22:39] believer here
[1:22:40] but that don't tell me that you're a
[1:22:42] message believer a real believer
[1:22:45] a real message believer is that like i
[1:22:47] said the dynamics coming upon the seed
[1:22:49] germ in there and bringing the word
[1:22:51] forth and resurrection in you
[1:22:53] then you're a partaker
[1:22:55] then you're a possessor
[1:22:59] amen now
[1:23:01] well i'm a pentecostal or whatever i
[1:23:04] belong then if you don't line with that
[1:23:07] word there's something wrong then you
[1:23:08] see your real father is in god because
[1:23:10] that real start in your soul the real
[1:23:13] start in your soul before there was even
[1:23:14] a spirit it was your soul
[1:23:18] see he said that soul didn't if it
[1:23:20] didn't come from god it wasn't a germ of
[1:23:22] god to begin with you're deceived
[1:23:25] so see he's really bringing us down
[1:23:28] god searched me it ought to be your
[1:23:30] prayer
[1:23:31] god search me
[1:23:33] show me i want to know you
[1:23:37] i genuinely in my heart i must know you
[1:23:41] i can't go on just thinking i'm okay
[1:23:44] i've got to know you
[1:23:47] i don't want just imagine i hope i'm
[1:23:49] okay
[1:23:50] you've got to have the substance of that
[1:23:52] promise
[1:23:55] that's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:23:58] because faith is the substance of things
[1:24:00] hoped for
[1:24:03] amen when you have the substance you
[1:24:05] have the evidence yes
[1:24:07] well i need an evidence i gotta i gotta
[1:24:09] see it happen no you've already seen it
[1:24:11] happen in faith and that that faith will
[1:24:13] bring it to a manifestation that's why
[1:24:16] you can't you can't have even a marriage
[1:24:19] i mean we're in a marriage but the
[1:24:20] marriage and the and the union has to be
[1:24:23] spiritual before it becomes physical
[1:24:27] are you with me
[1:24:28] before we meet the lord in the air
[1:24:30] you're bearing that son to meet him
[1:24:32] and who's bearing it the bride is
[1:24:34] bearing it it's the revelation of the
[1:24:36] word
[1:24:37] she has his name she's bearing his life
[1:24:39] she's burying his his himself just like
[1:24:42] sarah bore the sun in order to meet the
[1:24:45] sun it had to come to sarah
[1:24:49] are you with me the faith has to be
[1:24:51] there before the reality of that if you
[1:24:53] have to have faith for healing before
[1:24:55] healing season manifested
[1:24:58] amen
[1:25:00] it's pretty simple you have to have that
[1:25:02] revelation first
[1:25:06] before the manifestation will follow
[1:25:08] that see the revelation's got to be
[1:25:10] there
[1:25:12] amen we're going to we're going to a
[1:25:14] wedding supper yet we're feasting at a
[1:25:16] table right now
[1:25:18] in faith
[1:25:19] revelation we're eating of it
[1:25:22] i'm union to it but i'm going to a great
[1:25:24] union
[1:25:26] i'm going to a union where i'll meet him
[1:25:28] but i've got to meet him now i've got to
[1:25:30] have him now i've got to see him now
[1:25:31] i've got to have a spiritual union of
[1:25:33] faith now
[1:25:35] in me that's a reality it isn't a hope
[1:25:37] so it's real and he testifies of it real
[1:25:40] by living that life through me to the
[1:25:42] word
[1:25:44] amen amen i don't know how you say it
[1:25:46] any clearer
[1:25:48] amen all right
[1:25:51] see
[1:25:53] you're if you're if you're deceived
[1:25:54] you're in a patch of weeds bearing the
[1:25:56] world's record of weeds coming forth
[1:25:58] acting like the world loving the world
[1:25:59] don't you realize see we don't want that
[1:26:03] the bible said that before
[1:26:07] all that christ was he poured in all
[1:26:09] that christ was was poured into
[1:26:12] the church
[1:26:13] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:26:15] god above us then god was with us in
[1:26:18] some form
[1:26:19] now where is it
[1:26:21] god is in bride form in us
[1:26:23] god above us god with us god in us
[1:26:28] amen what is it another christ no the
[1:26:30] same christ it's the mystery of god
[1:26:32] revealed in you he takes and opens that
[1:26:35] mystery to you personally it was hid in
[1:26:37] you
[1:26:40] amen and he opens it up of himself it's
[1:26:42] the unveiling of himself
[1:26:45] all right
[1:26:47] now
[1:26:48] he said brother david i've heard you say
[1:26:49] that every time you preach and i'll say
[1:26:51] it and i'll continue to say it because
[1:26:53] it's the message of the hour that's
[1:26:55] what's putting a bride in a body change
[1:27:00] amen it's not it's not just the new
[1:27:03] birth and you stop you grow you grow
[1:27:05] into the very headstone you grow into
[1:27:07] very headship you unite with him it's
[1:27:09] the person you become the same person
[1:27:12] you're one it's not twain you're one
[1:27:14] you're one you're no longer twain
[1:27:16] the seal didn't open to bring us keep us
[1:27:18] twain it came to bring us one
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:25] amen
[1:27:26] yeah we preach new birth we have to
[1:27:28] preach new birth but there's something
[1:27:29] beyond the new birth because the new
[1:27:31] birth made way
[1:27:32] for the holy ghost himself to come right
[1:27:34] down in perfection
[1:27:36] that's the capstone what's the
[1:27:38] perfection when that comes down upon
[1:27:40] that upon the individual or upon the
[1:27:42] church that's a capstone
[1:27:45] it seals it in this is myself it unites
[1:27:49] it as one the same person
[1:27:51] amen
[1:27:52] you positioned you it places you brother
[1:27:54] brown said i'm so glad that we can see
[1:27:56] ourselves positionally placed
[1:27:59] in christ when would that happen in this
[1:28:01] day it couldn't happen until this day
[1:28:05] now i'm way ahead of myself
[1:28:08] let's drop back here so i can close
[1:28:12] now the same spirit was in christ is in
[1:28:16] the bride his body unites them together
[1:28:18] with all the word and god living in
[1:28:20] there himself manifesting it
[1:28:23] amen so
[1:28:27] the whole thing is god himself
[1:28:29] materializing it's god himself
[1:28:33] what is it in you it's god himself
[1:28:34] materializing who are you god himself
[1:28:37] materializing tangible made flesh in you
[1:28:43] the word who is it the word
[1:28:46] amen amen amen
[1:28:49] amen all right
[1:28:51] now
[1:28:54] you're the manifestation of his thinking
[1:28:57] all right i won't get into all our acts
[1:28:58] to declare him i said that but it's
[1:28:59] going to follow up later on with that
[1:29:02] all right so
[1:29:06] i'm taking these out of different why
[1:29:08] i'm moving so many papers here but
[1:29:10] anyway now
[1:29:16] if you're acting like the world desiring
[1:29:18] the world loving the things of the world
[1:29:20] because the love of god is not in you
[1:29:28] when jesus became the fullness of the
[1:29:30] word then we were in him germ foreign
[1:29:33] form then
[1:29:35] not human form then
[1:29:37] we bypassed the theophany but we were in
[1:29:39] him germ form we were in him
[1:29:42] when he would met when he met in that
[1:29:44] theophany form when he met not the man
[1:29:47] jesus but the theophany when he met
[1:29:49] abraham
[1:29:51] you were in him
[1:29:54] germ form amen
[1:29:56] you never entered into the word form of
[1:29:57] your own body when our earthly
[1:29:59] tabernacle be dissolved we enter into
[1:30:01] that
[1:30:02] if
[1:30:03] it's before the rapture we enter into
[1:30:05] that if it is that will come one with
[1:30:07] the glorified
[1:30:11] you read who is this melchizedek
[1:30:14] are we feeding like we should
[1:30:16] you see that's the thing are we feeding
[1:30:18] sometimes these things are said and it's
[1:30:19] like i never heard that before
[1:30:22] why because you're not feeding you
[1:30:24] you're too busy on other things
[1:30:28] amen
[1:30:29] you say that hurts i didn't tend it to
[1:30:31] hurt it's the truth it ought to wake us
[1:30:33] up to the fact that we need to be
[1:30:35] redeeming the time
[1:30:37] because the days are evil
[1:30:39] how do you redeem it buy it back take it
[1:30:41] out of the devil's hands
[1:30:44] take a little more time with the word
[1:30:46] you can make time because i can't make
[1:30:47] time you can make time you're letting
[1:30:49] your reasoning and your flesh stand in
[1:30:51] your way and it becomes an idol before
[1:30:53] you
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:58] i don't mean to shout at you but i can't
[1:31:00] preach it any other way
[1:31:05] i probably wouldn't like john the
[1:31:06] baptist very well when he stood
[1:31:07] and then and shouted
[1:31:09] scream to the top as long as you allah
[1:31:12] will go there
[1:31:14] it takes the time you know what i mean
[1:31:16] though
[1:31:17] and now since you've recognized it now
[1:31:19] we sit together when you rose from the
[1:31:22] dead we rose with him when he rose now
[1:31:24] we sit together in heavenly places sons
[1:31:26] and daughters then we were attributes of
[1:31:28] god
[1:31:29] god eternal life and god is the only
[1:31:31] eternal life thing there is
[1:31:33] then we are in him from the beginning
[1:31:34] and when jesus became all the word then
[1:31:37] we were part of him then amen there you
[1:31:39] are
[1:31:40] you see he was finished he lived the
[1:31:42] life that was acceptable for you
[1:31:44] you are accepted in the beloved the holy
[1:31:47] ghost in you identifies you are accepted
[1:31:50] in the beloved amen
[1:31:54] amen therefore you have no confidence in
[1:31:57] this flesh
[1:32:02] doesn't deal with you that way
[1:32:04] not dealing with you by the way of the
[1:32:06] flesh
[1:32:08] if that's the case he's dealing with you
[1:32:10] according to the law he's putting you
[1:32:12] under condemnation of the law
[1:32:13] because not a one of us can keep it but
[1:32:16] grace holds it right
[1:32:17] and man
[1:32:18] and and made way and and fulfilled the
[1:32:21] law
[1:32:22] now you're not under the law you're
[1:32:24] under grace
[1:32:27] you're under the word it's not saying
[1:32:28] you don't keep the word you keep the
[1:32:29] word but if you fail to keep the word
[1:32:31] grace holds it
[1:32:34] are you with me
[1:32:36] all right all right so
[1:32:38] he said you can be anointed out here in
[1:32:41] this spirit hear what prophet said you
[1:32:43] could be anointed in this second realm
[1:32:45] the spirit and have desires and and do
[1:32:47] all these other things imagination
[1:32:49] raising memory conscious when it comes
[1:32:51] to that thai post that word you'll never
[1:32:53] move from there
[1:32:56] he said it'll hold right steady and true
[1:32:58] to that word as it can be and you have a
[1:33:01] word for the hour and where the word for
[1:33:03] the season is present the blood's
[1:33:05] present
[1:33:07] did you know that if we walk in the
[1:33:08] light as he is in the light we have
[1:33:10] fellowship together with him and the
[1:33:12] blood of jesus christ cleanses us from
[1:33:14] all sin but you've got to be walking in
[1:33:16] the light as he is in that light
[1:33:19] amen because though you're what you're
[1:33:22] sitting right here hearing the light of
[1:33:24] the hour and the blood is right here at
[1:33:25] the cleanse
[1:33:29] amen if we can recognize he's in our
[1:33:31] midst
[1:33:34] his life is in our midst his name which
[1:33:36] is his life is in her midst his spirit
[1:33:38] which is the word is in our midst
[1:33:41] everything we have need of for this
[1:33:43] journey is provided for us in the holy
[1:33:46] ghost in you
[1:33:48] even the rapture
[1:33:51] even the body change
[1:33:53] when you receive the holy ghost he comes
[1:33:55] and dwells in you everything you need
[1:33:56] for this journey is in you
[1:34:01] amen all he wants you to do you just
[1:34:04] wait on me i'll reveal what you need
[1:34:06] i'll make it known what you need and
[1:34:08] walk in it
[1:34:10] as i reveal my word walk in it as i
[1:34:12] review my words speak it now let's let's
[1:34:15] close this off
[1:34:17] real quick here let me see how far i can
[1:34:19] go here
[1:34:20] okay i think that some of this i'll just
[1:34:22] bypass
[1:34:25] the word can never pass away what is
[1:34:27] christianity brother brahm said
[1:34:29] christianity you wanna know what
[1:34:30] christianity is everybody uses that word
[1:34:32] i'm a christian i'm a christian but what
[1:34:34] is it
[1:34:34] christianity is when the holy ghost has
[1:34:36] taken full possession of you and you're
[1:34:38] led by the holy ghost by the holy spirit
[1:34:44] think of that
[1:34:46] when the holy ghost has full possession
[1:34:48] of you
[1:34:51] and you're led by the holy spirit no
[1:34:53] matter how good you know what and it's
[1:34:55] going to be some hard going until the
[1:34:57] holy ghost gets full possession of you a
[1:34:59] lot of us
[1:35:00] many years many trials many many things
[1:35:03] but god will achieve it nothing going to
[1:35:05] stop him he's obligated to that word
[1:35:10] you can't stop it
[1:35:12] it may take a while but until he gets
[1:35:14] you to let go and let him have his way
[1:35:18] because always something else will come
[1:35:19] before you and you bother that instead
[1:35:21] of the promise instead of what he said
[1:35:23] why that's fear
[1:35:27] amen
[1:35:28] a lot of things could be said on that
[1:35:29] couldn't it
[1:35:32] amen
[1:35:33] because there's a lot of things that
[1:35:34] maybe
[1:35:35] he wants you to realize and let go of
[1:35:40] to fulfill what he called in your life
[1:35:42] you've got to let go of it oh brother i
[1:35:44] can't let go because if i do this will
[1:35:46] happen that who says this and that will
[1:35:48] happen
[1:35:49] isn't god able to keep his word
[1:35:53] and he said he'd provide all of your
[1:35:55] needs
[1:36:01] i can say amen
[1:36:04] amen i can say amen
[1:36:07] but you have now watch we can preach the
[1:36:09] word explain the word but you have to
[1:36:11] receive the word
[1:36:13] you have to hear it
[1:36:15] that's see and you don't hear it with
[1:36:16] these ears
[1:36:17] you hear it with your heart
[1:36:19] there's something in your heart that has
[1:36:21] the ability to hear the word receive it
[1:36:25] amen that's called
[1:36:29] seed
[1:36:30] of god
[1:36:32] amen
[1:36:33] all right let's let's close that off
[1:36:36] let's get down here to my closing
[1:36:51] i wonder i want to i want to cover this
[1:36:55] just
[1:36:56] quickly as i can right here
[1:36:58] i wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:37:01] impressed i want you to hear this
[1:37:04] i
[1:37:04] wonder
[1:37:06] if we are sufficiently impressed with
[1:37:09] the word
[1:37:10] in our midst
[1:37:14] now think of that deeply
[1:37:17] because sufficience means adequate
[1:37:20] fully
[1:37:21] are we adequately impressed
[1:37:25] are we fully impressed
[1:37:27] do we really are we really sufficiently
[1:37:30] impressed
[1:37:32] i tell you if you knew if that was the
[1:37:35] case you would recognize his presence
[1:37:37] and if you recognize his presence it's
[1:37:39] going to change the way you talk and
[1:37:40] walk and speak
[1:37:44] how you
[1:37:45] take things what you do your reactions
[1:37:48] when you recognize you're in his
[1:37:50] presence
[1:37:52] he's walking in you
[1:37:54] he's living in you
[1:37:56] brother braham said we recognize it
[1:37:58] recognize that we'd have a different
[1:38:00] attitude towards
[1:38:05] we'd have a different outlook we
[1:38:07] wouldn't be letting so many things
[1:38:08] become in our way
[1:38:10] that we worship and bow to instead of
[1:38:12] him it comes between us
[1:38:15] i can say some strong words right here
[1:38:18] but paul said it flee idolatry
[1:38:21] flee that spirit because that spirit is
[1:38:23] a strong spirit
[1:38:25] he'll present everything he can and put
[1:38:27] it between you and the word
[1:38:29] you don't need to add to or take
[1:38:30] anything from the word the word is
[1:38:32] absolutely fully flawless and perfect
[1:38:35] it doesn't need anything added to it and
[1:38:37] faith will say it's so just like he said
[1:38:39] it
[1:38:40] and claim it and walk in it and act on
[1:38:43] it
[1:38:44] amen that's what faith does
[1:38:48] all right
[1:38:50] now
[1:38:51] so i wonder if we're sufficiently or
[1:38:52] adequate to an adequate degree fully
[1:38:55] impressed with the word in our midst let
[1:38:58] me give you a thought here
[1:39:00] how
[1:39:01] do you pray who's the word in our midst
[1:39:03] it's jesus
[1:39:05] the word
[1:39:06] god the word
[1:39:08] your husband the word
[1:39:13] let me give you a thought here how do we
[1:39:14] pray
[1:39:16] and that's interesting how we said
[1:39:18] prayer the song was sung i was that a
[1:39:20] recording with somebody singing that in
[1:39:21] here
[1:39:23] recording
[1:39:24] yeah do we pray
[1:39:27] we pray in jesus name don't we
[1:39:32] look at all watch how this spreads
[1:39:35] then what is jesus name
[1:39:38] what is life
[1:39:41] the prophet said this what is the life
[1:39:43] the name
[1:39:46] all right so that name has to be in you
[1:39:53] this is a real christian
[1:39:54] that name is in you because we have his
[1:39:57] name in us his life his self
[1:40:02] we pray in jesus name
[1:40:06] amen he said every prayer is in his name
[1:40:10] or there isn't any answer
[1:40:15] all right
[1:40:17] the word impressed are we sufficiently
[1:40:19] impressed impressed means
[1:40:22] showing admiration or respect
[1:40:28] for
[1:40:30] the word in our midst
[1:40:33] are we are we are we
[1:40:35] admiring and respecting
[1:40:39] the word in our midst
[1:40:42] amen
[1:40:44] are we are we do we have an admiration
[1:40:47] for it
[1:40:48] do we have a genuine respect for it
[1:40:54] it's quiet in here isn't it
[1:40:57] it's the truth it is the truth
[1:41:00] all right
[1:41:04] we
[1:41:06] then we ask would be careful how we ask
[1:41:09] what we ask
[1:41:12] because you realize that saint john 15 7
[1:41:14] said if you abide in me
[1:41:16] and my word in you
[1:41:18] you carry that word you're carrying that
[1:41:20] life it's in you the name is in you
[1:41:24] the person's in you
[1:41:28] he said this is the confidence that we
[1:41:30] have in him that if we ask anything
[1:41:33] according to his will he heareth us if
[1:41:35] you abide in me in my word
[1:41:37] my word is the will if you abide in me
[1:41:39] and my word abides in you
[1:41:42] ask what you will is it you asking no
[1:41:46] it's my lips it's my voice but who's
[1:41:48] asking
[1:41:52] he's the one speaking
[1:41:53] he's the one asking because i have him i
[1:41:56] carry him he's in me if my word and you
[1:41:59] if you abide in me in my word and you
[1:42:01] ask what you will because why because
[1:42:04] it's me in you
[1:42:07] you're not going to ask contrary the
[1:42:08] word if you ask contrary to the word you
[1:42:10] won't get what you asked for
[1:42:12] are you with me all right so it's him
[1:42:14] doing the speaking
[1:42:16] now watch how we unfold this just just
[1:42:18] i'm i'm closing
[1:42:22] now
[1:42:23] he said this is the confidence we have
[1:42:24] in him see the confidence we haven't if
[1:42:26] we ask anything according to his will he
[1:42:29] heareth us
[1:42:30] if we know that he hear us
[1:42:32] whatever we ask we know that we have the
[1:42:34] petitions that we desired of him
[1:42:37] okay lamentations 337 said who is he
[1:42:41] that saith
[1:42:42] speaks ask
[1:42:44] who is he that sayeth
[1:42:46] and it cometh to pass when the lord
[1:42:49] commanded it not
[1:42:52] so who's doing the inspiration
[1:42:55] who's giving you the go-ahead to speak
[1:42:57] it
[1:42:58] if you abide in me and my word in you
[1:43:00] it's him in you doing the speaking
[1:43:02] asking it's him and you doing the
[1:43:04] leading it's him and you inspiring
[1:43:08] you have the mind of christ
[1:43:11] remember she has come ahead of myself
[1:43:14] here she has
[1:43:16] thus saith the lord
[1:43:21] all right
[1:43:22] so you see he said now we ask what is
[1:43:25] the will of god the only way you would
[1:43:27] know his will
[1:43:29] and that is by the word of god
[1:43:33] right
[1:43:34] he said
[1:43:35] there it is
[1:43:37] he said
[1:43:38] the word jesus the name is the word the
[1:43:41] will so jesus is the word jesus is the
[1:43:44] revel revealed word in you
[1:43:46] is the word
[1:43:48] the will
[1:43:49] are you with
[1:43:50] me that's the will
[1:43:53] all right said you can't separate god
[1:43:55] and the word they are one now look at
[1:43:58] how he brings this out
[1:44:01] now then this word he is left behind on
[1:44:04] the printed page is a part of him when
[1:44:07] you accept it by faith
[1:44:11] are you with me
[1:44:13] what is faith
[1:44:15] revelation
[1:44:16] the believer the real believer
[1:44:19] in you
[1:44:20] is that faith
[1:44:24] amen that's
[1:44:26] that faith in you is the believer
[1:44:29] brother brahm said don't you like that
[1:44:30] he said he made that say don't you like
[1:44:32] that let that come alive to you
[1:44:34] see
[1:44:35] the real believer is the faith
[1:44:38] all right he said he said
[1:44:42] then the word he said now
[1:44:45] is a part of him the word is left behind
[1:44:47] on the printed page is part of him when
[1:44:49] you accept it by faith into a
[1:44:51] spirit-filled life
[1:44:54] that makes the difference
[1:44:57] now he said that his word was life is
[1:45:00] that right his word is life so his will
[1:45:02] is his word and his word is life and the
[1:45:04] life the word is in you and that's his
[1:45:06] name
[1:45:08] the name is the name of a person
[1:45:13] all right
[1:45:14] now he said he said that his word was
[1:45:17] life
[1:45:20] that's exactly what it is i am the way
[1:45:24] the truth
[1:45:25] the life
[1:45:27] if any man have not the spirit of christ
[1:45:30] he is none of his
[1:45:32] all right now closing there it is
[1:45:36] he is spirit
[1:45:38] and he is life yes
[1:45:43] so he the word is spirit
[1:45:45] and life
[1:45:46] in you
[1:45:47] his spirit and his life
[1:45:50] but that's in you
[1:45:51] how do we pray we pray in jesus name
[1:45:54] don't we yes
[1:45:56] all right that's exactly what the word
[1:45:58] is see what is it doing it's bringing
[1:46:00] you face to face with the revelation
[1:46:04] this is yourself this is you this is you
[1:46:08] the real you
[1:46:10] the holy spirit in you
[1:46:12] the word the life the truth
[1:46:15] ask what you will
[1:46:17] what are you asking the revealed word
[1:46:20] watch what watch it now he said
[1:46:22] that is exactly what jesus is he is the
[1:46:25] word
[1:46:27] that's what the word is that's exactly
[1:46:29] what jesus is
[1:46:30] is the revealed word brother brown said
[1:46:32] your husband jesus your husband is the
[1:46:35] revealed word
[1:46:37] all right
[1:46:38] he said so when a spirit born
[1:46:41] watch this he is the word so when a
[1:46:43] spirit-born spirit-filled man in
[1:46:47] faith
[1:46:49] the big statement
[1:46:52] in
[1:46:53] faith who's going to direct that
[1:46:55] you can't pump it up you can't work it
[1:46:56] up he sovereignly gives it is that right
[1:46:59] but he said i'll meet every need i'll
[1:47:00] bring it to you when you have need of it
[1:47:02] i'll reveal my word as you have need of
[1:47:04] it
[1:47:06] see this is a consolation you don't have
[1:47:08] to work it up at all watch what a
[1:47:10] spirit-filled believer will do with it
[1:47:12] he said when a spirit born spirit-filled
[1:47:14] man in faith takes that word into his
[1:47:18] heart and places it now watch now watch
[1:47:21] what brother brown said in the seals
[1:47:23] he reveals his thought to you
[1:47:26] just like he did to moses
[1:47:28] he revealed his thought he reveals his
[1:47:30] thought he said that's the word he then
[1:47:33] faith takes the word into his heart
[1:47:37] now it's a word
[1:47:38] that's right
[1:47:40] but it's not a word out of you yet but
[1:47:42] it's a revealed thought
[1:47:45] that's hid in the word
[1:47:46] so we call it the revelation of the word
[1:47:52] watch what a real believer will do
[1:47:55] he said he said when you take it in
[1:47:57] faith into his heart so the word the
[1:47:59] thought is revealed to you it's still a
[1:48:01] thought until what happens something's
[1:48:03] got to happen
[1:48:05] because that's god's way and god doesn't
[1:48:07] change his way he re it was in his heart
[1:48:09] it was in his thought in revelation and
[1:48:11] he spoke the worlds into existence
[1:48:14] and he speaks you into existence how
[1:48:17] were you brought to birth by a spoken
[1:48:19] word
[1:48:20] it's always been god's way of doing it
[1:48:23] amen
[1:48:24] are you with me
[1:48:25] and so he said he said when a spirit
[1:48:27] born spirit-filled man in faith takes
[1:48:29] that word into his heart and places it
[1:48:31] upon his lips
[1:48:34] he said it's still a thought until you
[1:48:36] speak it then it becomes a word
[1:48:43] now you're seeing saint john 15 7. he
[1:48:45] said if you really see saint john 57
[1:48:47] then you know who you are
[1:48:52] all right then he said he said when he
[1:48:54] takes it and places it on his lips why
[1:48:57] that is the same as deity
[1:48:59] or god
[1:49:01] jesus the life the name
[1:49:04] speaking amen
[1:49:08] it's the same as deity speaking where's
[1:49:10] the speaking out of your lips
[1:49:13] your heart
[1:49:16] you see the oneness here
[1:49:19] you see who the real you is
[1:49:21] he's got the same ability as god as
[1:49:23] father only god the father is above him
[1:49:26] bringing the word to him revealing it to
[1:49:29] him
[1:49:30] and he speaks faith hold fast the
[1:49:32] confession of your
[1:49:34] imagination reasoning memory conscience
[1:49:36] feelings no faith
[1:49:40] hallelujah hallelujah do you love him
[1:49:45] every mountain has to go
[1:49:48] satan cannot stand before that man now
[1:49:51] you know satan not afraid of a man but
[1:49:53] what's he speaking of that man christ
[1:49:57] that man that's inside of you veil
[1:49:58] behind your skin he's scared the death
[1:50:01] of that because you'll take him back to
[1:50:03] the word it's written it's written of me
[1:50:05] go back and tell the devil what's
[1:50:07] written of you
[1:50:09] go attack and tech back to the father's
[1:50:11] word and said this is where my faith
[1:50:13] rests this is what's revealed to me
[1:50:15] i come from god and i'm returning to him
[1:50:21] amen
[1:50:23] that's exactly where we came from
[1:50:25] and you're going right back to where you
[1:50:27] should have been in the beginning
[1:50:29] let me come down here to be tested and
[1:50:31] tried but
