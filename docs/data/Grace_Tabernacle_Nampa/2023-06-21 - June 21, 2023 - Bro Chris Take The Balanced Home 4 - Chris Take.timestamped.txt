[37:59] sometimes Lord when you call us up
[38:02] to a higher Place Lord we
[38:05] find more of ourselves that has to be
[38:08] surrendered
[38:10] and Lord we want to find ourselves in

[38:34] that place you have called us to Lord
[38:37] following at the end of the road Lord as
[38:40] children of God will look back and see
[38:42] that
[38:42] even when the times that we went astray

[39:14] amen thank you brother Alex and
[39:16] musicians
[39:18] man why don't we stand tonight
[39:20] it's just been um you know there's a
[39:22] peace in my heart but it's been hectic
[39:24] long day of work and I'm apologize for
[39:27] being a bad example and showing up past
[39:29] 7 30.
[39:31] but I had a few things I just had to get
[39:34] written down and so um
[39:38] then we came out and we didn't have
[39:39] batteries for the microphone so
[39:43] but uh
[39:45] you know the devil knows he he's lost
[39:50] he's just too uh stubborn to give up
[39:54] and we know we've won and we have too
[39:57] much faith in God to give up
[39:59] amen
[40:01] let's start this here
[40:03] so I wanted to take tonight
[40:05] um a continue on the balanced home uh
[40:08] this is part four and um if you have
[40:12] your Bibles turn with me to Ephesians
[40:13] chapter 6 verse 1.
[40:20] you know I've been um
[40:22] trying to keep
[40:25] keep open to the Lord's leadership you
[40:27] know give you give yourself a title like
[40:29] the balanced home I could just go any
[40:32] direction the Lord wants and not
[40:34] confined to a box and
[40:37] last time we talked on kind of Economics
[40:40] of the home and you know each one of
[40:42] these topics that we go through we might
[40:44] come back and do some more on them
[40:46] however the Lord leads us and I
[40:48] appreciate your your patience and and
[40:50] your attentiveness you know
[40:52] um I don't know it all
[40:54] um I'm I'm ministering it as the Lord
[40:57] shows it to me so it's it's fresh fresh
[41:00] from our lives and we're living this and
[41:02] and so if there's anything that comes up
[41:05] and you say well that I don't know if
[41:07] that sounds just right or what please
[41:09] let's have a conversation because you
[41:11] know what I have a lot to learn
[41:13] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 1. the
[41:16] children obey your parents and the Lord
[41:18] for this is right honor thy father and
[41:20] mother which is the first commandment
[41:22] with promise that it may be well with
[41:24] thee and thou mayest live long on the
[41:26] Earth
[41:30] some would do well to read this
[41:32] scripture instead of paying thousands of
[41:34] dollars for Botox and faceless
[41:37] and your fathers provoke not your
[41:38] children to wrath but bring them up in
[41:40] the nurture and admonition of the Lord
[41:43] now we could we could stop there
[41:46] do I still have the mic
[41:48] we could stop there
[41:50] um
[41:50] and we can say okay let's let's talk
[41:52] about let's talk about the children and
[41:54] obedience but as I was studying I I read
[41:57] on
[41:59] it says servants be obedient to them
[42:01] that are your Masters according to the
[42:02] flesh with fear and trembling in
[42:06] singleness of your heart as unto Christ
[42:09] in in this chapter and the chapter
[42:11] before Paul always says as unto Christ
[42:14] be submitted to Christ it's all about
[42:17] Christ okay verse six not with eye
[42:20] Service as men Pleasers but as the
[42:22] Servants of Christ doing the will of God
[42:24] from the heart so you're serving God
[42:27] because you love God
[42:29] with Goodwill doing as doing Service as
[42:32] to the Lord
[42:34] and not to men knowing that whatsoever
[42:37] good thing any men doeth the same shall
[42:39] he receive of the Lord whether he be
[42:41] Bond or free
[42:43] and your Masters do the same things unto
[42:46] them for bearing
[42:47] threatening knowing that your master
[42:49] also is in heaven neither is their
[42:51] respect of persons with him may the Lord
[42:54] blessed reading of the word you can be
[42:55] seated tonight
[42:59] so I know it's Wednesday night
[43:02] and everyone's fresh back from camp and
[43:04] back to work and probably still
[43:06] recovering so I'll try to keep this
[43:09] within an hour
[43:10] um Lord willing
[43:13] so
[43:16] I'm beginning to think about I was
[43:17] thinking about okay well feeling led to
[43:20] talk about
[43:21] um the direction of chapter six which
[43:23] goes over the children and obeying your
[43:25] parents and everything in which is the
[43:27] complete the complete picture
[43:30] of a balanced home and and I as I read
[43:33] this chapter I realized there was one
[43:35] there was one um
[43:39] foundational
[43:42] that um actually goes through
[43:45] I can switch to a handheld if I need to
[43:47] actually goes to
[43:49] um through the entire Bible and that is
[43:52] obedience
[43:54] and you start with the parents you know
[43:56] children obey your parents and honor
[43:57] their father and thy mother and then it
[44:00] and then it says servants be obedient to
[44:02] them now we can take that to today and
[44:04] say well we'll be obedient at work and
[44:06] and uh whoever whoever we are serving
[44:10] underneath because we're all Servants of
[44:12] the Lord
[44:14] so we all have a master
[44:16] now we all have the our our Master which
[44:20] is Christ we all have Masters lowercase
[44:23] M here on Earth all of us answer to
[44:27] somebody
[44:29] and
[44:30] you know whether it be the the
[44:31] government with your taxes or different
[44:34] things like that but we all we all
[44:35] answer to the law we always we always
[44:38] have a mess or where where are we going
[44:40] and um we may not all be husbands and we
[44:43] may not all be wives we might not all be
[44:45] fathers or mothers but we were all
[44:48] children
[44:49] every single one of us
[44:51] has a father and a mother even if
[44:53] they're not living today you are still
[44:55] their son or their daughter
[44:57] so we're all children so when we read
[44:59] the chapter that verse 6 honored thy
[45:01] father and thy mother obey your parents
[45:03] that applies even to me that applies to
[45:06] Brother David
[45:07] that applies to brother sister Joy
[45:10] because you do honor unto your father
[45:13] you and we can transfer that into to
[45:17] Christ we can we honor Christ Our Father
[45:20] but I mean but look at this one
[45:22] principle that goes through the
[45:23] scriptures on obedience and um
[45:27] in a first Samuel chapter 15 very
[45:30] familiar part of scripture and think I
[45:32] think whenever obedience comes up we
[45:34] kind of tend towards um this story but
[45:37] this is the story of Samuel or excuse me
[45:40] Saul and and the moment that he lost the
[45:45] Kingdom to David
[45:48] or the the Lord took the Kingdom from
[45:51] him
[45:53] uh first Samuel chapter 15 verse 10.
[45:59] says then the
[46:01] then came the word of the Lord unto
[46:03] Samuel saying it repenteth me that I
[46:05] have set up Saul to be king for he has
[46:08] turned back from following me and hath
[46:10] not performed my Commandments and it
[46:13] Grieves Samuel and he cried unto the
[46:15] Lord all night
[46:17] and when Samuel Rose early to meet Saul
[46:20] in the morning it was told Samuel saying
[46:23] Saul came to Carmel and behold he set
[46:25] him up a place and is gone about and
[46:28] passed on and gone down to gilgal
[46:34] and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said
[46:36] unto him blessed be thou of the Lord I
[46:39] have performed the Commandment of the
[46:40] Lord
[46:45] you know
[46:46] um Saul was guilty and he knew it
[46:51] and so one of the things
[46:55] there's a scuffle in the bedroom and you
[46:57] go in there okay kids what happened
[47:03] they know they're guilty so first off
[47:05] Saul says you know I did what I was
[47:06] supposed to do I I obeyed and Samuel
[47:09] says well what what why do I why then do
[47:12] I hear sheep
[47:14] and oxen
[47:16] cows why do I hear these and so I said
[47:18] well they have brought me from the
[47:19] amalekites the people spared the best of
[47:21] the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice
[47:23] unto the Lord thy God and the rest we
[47:26] have utterly destroyed
[47:28] then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I
[47:30] will tell thee what the Lord hath said
[47:32] to me this night
[47:34] and he said unto him say on
[47:36] and Samuel said when thou little in
[47:38] thine own sight was thou not made the
[47:40] head of the tribes of Israel and the
[47:43] Lord Anointed The King over Israel and
[47:45] the Lord sent me on a journey and said
[47:46] go and early destroy the Sinners the
[47:48] amalekites and fight against them until
[47:50] they be consumed wherefore then did US
[47:53] thou not obey the voice of the Lord but
[47:55] did his fly upon spoil unto this evil in
[47:58] the sight of the Lord and Saul said unto
[48:00] Samuel I have obeyed the voice of the
[48:02] Lord and have gone the way which the
[48:03] Lord sent me
[48:05] have utterly destroyed the amalekites so
[48:08] he for the sake of time will skip ahead
[48:10] he he reads it in his mind he said that
[48:12] I he reasoned away
[48:14] and he found a loop
[48:16] and he said well you know what
[48:19] um give me to switch
[48:22] he said you know what
[48:24] um we're gonna say that we're gonna save
[48:27] the sheep and we're gonna save the The
[48:28] Oxen We're Gonna Save the King and and
[48:30] he had this plan in place and Samuel
[48:33] says something that that's very profound
[48:36] in verse
[48:39] 23.
[48:41] verse 22 and Samuel said hath the Lord
[48:43] has great delight and burnt offerings
[48:45] and sacrifices as in obeying the voice
[48:47] of the Lord behold to obey is better
[48:50] than sacrifice and to hearken than the
[48:52] fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the sin
[48:55] of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[48:57] iniquity and idolatry because thou has
[49:00] rejected the word of the Lord he hath
[49:01] also rejected thee from being King
[49:04] so it's better to obey the word of God
[49:08] than to sacrifice
[49:11] so
[49:13] it's better to obey the word of God
[49:17] so God God has a has a basis for how we
[49:20] we should live our lives he has a
[49:22] foundation that he gives us
[49:24] the nuances and the details is different
[49:26] for every person
[49:28] but obedience to that
[49:31] the Lord prefers that
[49:33] then sacrifice
[49:36] so what so you know you could sacrifice
[49:38] say well I'm sacrificing you don't want
[49:40] to you don't want to sacrifice your
[49:42] family
[49:46] you say well well I gotta you know we
[49:48] have to go do this and and it could be
[49:50] something that you're saying well you
[49:51] know this is um
[49:53] this is this is part of the church this
[49:56] is part of of spreading the gospel this
[49:58] is part of Christianity
[50:01] but just because it is doesn't mean
[50:04] you're the ones to do it okay
[50:07] so then you do this and you sacrifice
[50:09] the time you should be with your family
[50:13] because and you're disobeying the word
[50:15] of God
[50:16] so just because you should doesn't just
[50:18] because you can doesn't mean you should
[50:19] that when God calls you to something he
[50:22] also causes calls your family and your
[50:25] wife
[50:25] God has called me in the season that
[50:27] we're in to travel and I have the
[50:29] support of my wife and my children but I
[50:31] do not sacrifice my children because I'm
[50:34] traveling to preach
[50:37] that's very specific example because
[50:39] this is what I'm living in but this can
[50:40] be applied to anything in your life just
[50:42] because it fellowship with the Believers
[50:44] is good but not at the expense of your
[50:47] family not at the sacrifice of your
[50:50] family unless it's what God has called
[50:52] to you specifically to do but just
[50:53] because it's fellowship with the
[50:55] Believers doesn't mean you give up your
[50:57] family now
[50:58] you have a job when you have to take
[51:00] care of your job and take care of your
[51:02] home this is the basis of serving God
[51:05] just because it's it has to do with with
[51:07] the church and it has to do with with
[51:09] with with with the kingdom of God
[51:12] right because he was going to sacrifice
[51:14] animals on the altar that's a good thing
[51:17] but it was not an obedience to the word
[51:19] of God
[51:20] so he he would say hey we're going to
[51:22] sacrifice we're gonna we're gonna do
[51:24] this worship which is part of serving
[51:26] God
[51:27] but it wasn't what God told them to do
[51:28] he was in disobedience
[51:31] so we they have to keep what a balance
[51:35] it's the balanced home right and
[51:38] so many times I've seen in in the circle
[51:40] that I grew up in the circle that I've
[51:42] been a part of I've seen people
[51:44] sacrifice their family sacrifice their
[51:47] job because there was meetings to go to
[51:50] and fellowship to be had
[51:55] but God says hey
[51:56] obedience to the word of God
[52:00] so now now God Can Say Hey I want you to
[52:02] go here I want you to do this and you do
[52:04] this but you do everything and with
[52:06] wisdom the wisdom of God
[52:10] so
[52:12] you don't want to you don't want to you
[52:14] to take your family hither and young you
[52:16] know brother the brother Paula Fontaine
[52:18] whether John and his wife forget his
[52:20] name but Brother Paul's parents you know
[52:22] God called brother John to travel and
[52:24] and sister and his wife they did
[52:26] homeschool on the road and the kids
[52:28] everyone just right there United with
[52:30] Mom Dad because God called them to do
[52:31] that
[52:34] so it was if he was being you know
[52:35] direct obedience to the word of God so
[52:38] God might call one family to do one
[52:40] thank God another family to do something
[52:42] else but both things have to do with the
[52:45] kingdom of God
[52:46] but one is not your calling one is their
[52:48] calling so obedience is better than
[52:51] sacrifice I hope that that kind of makes
[52:53] sense
[52:54] so
[52:56] we have to kind of look at obedience for
[52:59] a moment
[53:00] first by one man's Disobedience well
[53:03] we'll get to Disobedience first but by
[53:06] one man's Disobedience many were made
[53:07] Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall
[53:10] many be made righteous
[53:12] so look at the power of obedience
[53:14] because Christ had the Christ was Jesus
[53:17] was given the choice
[53:19] he said you know let this cup pass to me
[53:21] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[53:24] done so he in obedience
[53:27] to the word obedience to his father
[53:32] we Roman righteous
[53:34] because he died on the cross he took
[53:36] that he took that step forward by
[53:38] obedience
[53:39] and by one man's disobedience
[53:42] Adam and Eve many were made sinners so
[53:45] look at so just
[53:47] this is a fundamental a foundation
[53:51] for the gospel
[53:53] for the word of God is based on
[53:55] obedience
[53:57] Romans 6 verse 16. he says it says no ye
[54:00] not Paul says no ye not that to whom you
[54:02] yield yourselves servants to obey his
[54:05] servants you are to whom you obey
[54:08] whether of sin unto death or of
[54:10] obedience unto righteousness
[54:15] so when you when you disobey Christ you
[54:20] obey the devil and when you disobey the
[54:23] devil you obey Christ
[54:25] so there's types of obedience there's
[54:28] there's two types of obedience
[54:30] there are two types of servants servants
[54:33] to evil servants to good
[54:38] we don't we are not our we can't be you
[54:40] know the world says hey I'm My Own man
[54:42] you know do whatever whatever I want to
[54:44] well you're going to either follow
[54:46] Christ or the devil
[54:49] now you think well I thought this was
[54:51] about
[54:52] family
[54:54] well the family of God is the best
[54:56] example that I can think of
[54:58] and when you begin to look you begin to
[55:00] see how God treats the family how God
[55:02] structures the family of God
[55:05] there's great insight into our own
[55:08] families
[55:12] and uh though he were a son yet learned
[55:15] he obedience by the things which he
[55:17] suffered so
[55:18] we have two types of obedience
[55:21] obedience unto death obedience unto
[55:23] righteousness two types of servants
[55:25] Servants of good or Servants of evil now
[55:28] we always have we always carry the flesh
[55:31] man around with us the flesh man is a
[55:33] servant of evil
[55:35] but our obedience to the word of God
[55:38] brings which we have that scripture
[55:40] later on the Corinthians brings the
[55:42] flesh into subject to the word of God so
[55:46] we always have to war with disobedience
[55:51] now why do we have the flesh
[55:54] disobedience Adam and Eve disobeyed the
[55:58] word of God so we became imperfect and
[56:01] we needed Christ to redeem us so we
[56:04] could keep
[56:05] our home
[56:08] in obedience to the word of God so we
[56:11] keep our home our family our wife our
[56:13] children in obedience to the word of God
[56:17] so in the home just like Christ by his
[56:20] obedience
[56:25] he made many rights just like as the
[56:28] father of the home your obedience to
[56:30] Christ
[56:32] puts the token in your home
[56:36] shrouds your family in righteousness
[56:40] just like in in in the um
[56:43] during The Exodus the fathers you know
[56:45] they took the blood they put it on the
[56:47] doorpost
[56:50] by their obedience
[56:52] those of the household were made
[56:54] righteous because the blood the death
[56:56] angel passed them by
[57:01] so obedience
[57:04] with this scripture we could we could
[57:06] say oh well you know well we suffer and
[57:08] we learn obedience but we'll leave that
[57:10] for another sermon another time what I
[57:12] wanted to focus on is that obedience is
[57:14] something that has to be learned
[57:16] or taught
[57:18] you know one of the one of the things
[57:20] that's Paramount in my in my study right
[57:22] now is is how to answer modern culture
[57:25] and I think it might even come into the
[57:27] series of balanced home but young people
[57:29] raising up and even some
[57:31] um um adults even how do you answer
[57:33] modern culture how when your kids come
[57:35] to you say well what's wrong with being
[57:37] kind what's wrong with being tolerant
[57:38] what's wrong with being inclusive
[57:40] because these are all we're being nice
[57:41] and doesn't the Bible say doing to
[57:43] others as you'd have been doing to you
[57:45] be nice
[57:46] and we could just say well the words
[57:48] it's not against the word of God we
[57:49] don't accept them and uh as in their sin
[57:52] and everything and but you say well what
[57:54] about the love of God
[57:56] so it it's I think sometimes we we want
[57:58] to just shut down a question like that
[58:00] and just say oh well it's easy it's
[58:02] against the word of God but why you got
[58:04] you have to you have to break things
[58:06] down for for kids for your children kids
[58:09] is relevant I just mean living at home
[58:12] with Mom and Dad still
[58:14] and so
[58:16] so say well
[58:18] well
[58:18] um
[58:19] I remember I was going with that oh
[58:21] that's where I was going
[58:23] the world says oh well we all have
[58:25] goodness in us
[58:27] actually the Bible says you're born
[58:30] a heathen you're born with desires to
[58:34] tear the world apart
[58:36] so actually unless you have Christ there
[58:38] is no goodness within you
[58:41] one of the fundamental things of modern
[58:43] culture is well we all have somewhere
[58:46] inside of us there's good in everybody
[58:47] that's not true
[58:49] that's not true
[58:51] it's Christ that brings that goodness
[58:54] now they might have some behaviors that
[58:56] might a nice gesture but eat down inside
[58:59] everyone there is not goodness because
[59:02] that's contrary to the word of God
[59:04] another thing and I know this because I
[59:06] have to take courses at work on how to
[59:10] be like this
[59:12] and uh so they say well there's the
[59:14] Platinum rule because it's gold and then
[59:17] Platinum right Platinum is better than
[59:19] gold the Bible the Bible doesn't call it
[59:21] the Golden Rule but that's how it's been
[59:22] known doing to others as you had been
[59:24] doing to you that's the Golden Rule
[59:25] that's how the Bible defines being kind
[59:30] but the world says there's a platinum
[59:31] rule do unto others as they would want
[59:34] you to do to them
[59:36] they call that the Platinum rule
[59:39] which is just amazing because they say
[59:42] well we our rule our rule is better than
[59:44] God's but what that means is then if
[59:48] they want to be you know if they want to
[59:51] act out
[59:53] inappropriately we should let them
[59:56] because that's what they want to do
[59:59] so not to go all the way into that but
[1:00:01] to Simply make the statement that
[1:00:03] obedience in your children has to be
[1:00:04] taught you know this is the biggest
[1:00:05] thing that I have to learn with my
[1:00:06] children as I sometimes they do things
[1:00:08] and I'm thinking what in the world why
[1:00:11] would you do that
[1:00:13] and then it's okay
[1:00:15] I've never taught them otherwise
[1:00:18] so if your kids grow up and they get to
[1:00:21] be teenagers which mine are not yet they
[1:00:23] will be very shortly
[1:00:25] because just a few years is like a few
[1:00:27] minutes now huh
[1:00:29] you if you don't teach your children
[1:00:31] modesty if you don't teach your boys how
[1:00:33] to to to to to take care of of a of a
[1:00:36] lady teach them to be gentlemen they
[1:00:38] will not just grow up to be gentlemen
[1:00:40] you have to teach them that you have to
[1:00:43] teach young girls and young boys that
[1:00:44] they don't go off alone together that
[1:00:46] that that that they stay honorable you
[1:00:48] have to teach them that they don't just
[1:00:50] get that and guess what they don't just
[1:00:51] get that in church you have to teach
[1:00:54] that at home
[1:00:55] because remember obedience is the very
[1:00:57] fundamental anything bring bring me
[1:00:59] anything in the word of God and it all
[1:01:01] goes back to obedience
[1:01:04] it all goes back goes back to obedience
[1:01:06] so
[1:01:08] we'll start with we'll look at
[1:01:10] Disobedience and then we'll finish off
[1:01:11] with obedience
[1:01:19] children of Disobedience Disobedience
[1:01:21] this is in the god of the Civil age
[1:01:23] Disobedience means rebellion and look
[1:01:26] that up in the dictionary to be sure
[1:01:28] Rebellion rebelling against what the
[1:01:30] revealed word of God so disobedience is
[1:01:33] rebellion
[1:01:35] and Rebellion at its foundation is going
[1:01:39] against the word of God
[1:01:41] doesn't matter what it is when you
[1:01:43] disobey your parents you're rebelling
[1:01:45] against the word of God
[1:01:49] so when people in society disobey
[1:01:53] or Rebel
[1:01:59] it's the word against the word of God
[1:02:04] you know what you cannot separate morals
[1:02:07] from the word of God
[1:02:09] so when you teach when you teach your
[1:02:11] children
[1:02:12] you say um
[1:02:15] you know Jackson you can't hit Abe
[1:02:19] why
[1:02:21] well at some point you just when they're
[1:02:23] real little you say because you know dad
[1:02:24] said so but at some point you have to
[1:02:26] begin to teach them the moral reason the
[1:02:29] foundation why
[1:02:31] Titus how come you don't get your gun
[1:02:33] and shoot the windows out of the church
[1:02:36] because we'll beat you up or we'll we'll
[1:02:39] get upset with you no because in your
[1:02:41] heart this is the house of God and God
[1:02:43] says to respect the house of God why
[1:02:45] don't we sit at the Pew in church and
[1:02:47] chew gum because Dad said so no because
[1:02:49] you're respecting the house of God
[1:02:52] because you love God
[1:02:54] if we if you raise your children up to
[1:02:56] the age where they can leave and go do
[1:02:58] what they want
[1:02:59] and all the rules they obeyed simply
[1:03:01] because if they didn't they would get in
[1:03:04] trouble
[1:03:05] when they leave your house
[1:03:07] they will do all of those things
[1:03:10] because there is not a moral compass
[1:03:13] so the word of God is our moral compass
[1:03:15] so the other so Jackson can't hit a
[1:03:19] because the Bible says do unto others as
[1:03:21] you would have them do unto you you
[1:03:22] don't have to get complicated especially
[1:03:24] when they're Jackson's age
[1:03:26] you don't have to get complicated you'll
[1:03:27] lose them real quick
[1:03:30] a 30-minute dissertation on the word of
[1:03:32] God you're going to lose them in two
[1:03:33] minutes
[1:03:35] but as they grow up
[1:03:37] as they grow up you begin to you have to
[1:03:39] explain these things and whenever you
[1:03:40] explain a reason why as they grow you
[1:03:42] say the reason why is because the Bible
[1:03:44] says this
[1:03:46] this is why
[1:03:48] dad why don't you know why can't I cut
[1:03:51] my hair
[1:03:52] if it's just because Dad said so
[1:03:55] and and the thing of it is is that you
[1:03:57] have to have the relationship with your
[1:03:58] children that allow for that discussion
[1:04:01] so if you're too if you're a dictator
[1:04:03] and you're controlling of your children
[1:04:04] they will never ask you why can't I do
[1:04:08] this
[1:04:09] they're too afraid to
[1:04:11] so there has to be Trust
[1:04:13] it has to be trust so
[1:04:16] you say well the reason why is because
[1:04:18] of the scripture now as they grow up you
[1:04:20] see them begin because the word of God
[1:04:23] is a special thing
[1:04:25] and as someone begins to take hold of it
[1:04:27] and begin to apply it in their life even
[1:04:29] that even as a six seven year old
[1:04:31] five-year-old they begin to apply it to
[1:04:33] their life they say well Jesus doesn't
[1:04:34] want me to do this
[1:04:36] so I'm not going to it begins to grow
[1:04:39] and it compounds and then they begin to
[1:04:42] treat others around them with respect
[1:04:46] and do things you never even told them
[1:04:48] to do
[1:04:49] but they begin to understand how God
[1:04:52] wants them to live and it it compounds
[1:04:55] it's like compounding interest so you
[1:04:58] invest you invest at a young age you
[1:05:01] want your children to Res to to have a
[1:05:05] to understand how important it is to go
[1:05:07] to church
[1:05:09] take them to church
[1:05:11] snow rain ice fog the church doors are
[1:05:15] open and you're here your children will
[1:05:17] go up and go to church
[1:05:19] if you want your children to pay tithes
[1:05:21] you pay tithes
[1:05:24] if you want your children to respect
[1:05:25] devotions you do
[1:05:29] there was this there was this man and he
[1:05:31] made this statement he was a great I
[1:05:32] think he was a congressman or a senator
[1:05:34] I can't remember which state it was but
[1:05:36] a great man had done great things and he
[1:05:38] said the the fundamental thing that has
[1:05:41] given me my success in life was my
[1:05:42] father said
[1:05:44] do as I do not as I say
[1:05:51] what a responsibility
[1:05:53] because that's what Jesus did
[1:05:57] he lives at everything he preaches
[1:06:00] so they rebel against the revealed word
[1:06:02] of God like Cain rebelled against Abel's
[1:06:04] revealed Revelation you know brother
[1:06:05] Stephen mentioned
[1:06:07] Cain and Abel and all them that was the
[1:06:09] first family that was the first example
[1:06:11] we had
[1:06:12] and you see you see in in that in that
[1:06:15] right away right at the beginning of the
[1:06:17] world Rebellion
[1:06:20] now
[1:06:21] Cain rebelled against it and slew his
[1:06:23] brother the Pharisees with their own
[1:06:25] denominational knowledge of what the
[1:06:26] word of God was selected hand-picked men
[1:06:28] rebelled against the Vindicated word of
[1:06:31] God made manifest for the day Jesus
[1:06:33] Christ and killed him that's that right
[1:06:35] that's what the children of disobedience
[1:06:37] is a rebellion against the word of God
[1:06:40] now
[1:06:41] because of the Fall In the Garden of
[1:06:43] Eden children are born rebellious
[1:06:46] you have to teach them obedience
[1:06:50] and
[1:06:51] we could we look at this quote
[1:06:54] because it breaks down the problem in
[1:06:56] the family of God
[1:06:58] Disobedience to God's word
[1:07:02] the children of Disobedience so in the
[1:07:04] church in the in the in the in the
[1:07:05] church
[1:07:07] you have issues with churches themselves
[1:07:11] because
[1:07:13] there's Disobedience to the word of God
[1:07:15] it takes all the word for success in
[1:07:19] your life now you you none of us know
[1:07:21] all the word
[1:07:23] but we live all the word we know
[1:07:27] okay
[1:07:28] so as long as your desire is God show me
[1:07:30] more of your word so I can live more of
[1:07:33] your word you will always live all the
[1:07:36] word but to deny a portion of the word
[1:07:39] is to be a children of Disobedience and
[1:07:42] rebel against the word of God
[1:07:45] now this this we can go another we could
[1:07:47] go this direction and talk about the
[1:07:49] church and the message and different
[1:07:50] things but we're talking about the
[1:07:52] family so we'll take that example from
[1:07:54] the family of God and move it now into
[1:07:55] our homes
[1:07:58] where if we don't
[1:08:01] apply all the word
[1:08:04] we will find rebellion in our children
[1:08:10] but applying all the word to your family
[1:08:15] causes many to be righteous puts the
[1:08:18] token in your home
[1:08:20] you know the token comes to you
[1:08:24] the token comes to you
[1:08:26] and you because you by living the word
[1:08:28] of God
[1:08:29] so you live God live all the word in
[1:08:32] obedience to the word you want you want
[1:08:33] your family your children to obey you
[1:08:35] obey God
[1:08:37] you want your wife to to to to be uh
[1:08:40] your your helper and your and your and
[1:08:42] your companion and to Bear the burden
[1:08:44] with you you obey God
[1:08:48] and when you obey God you see back in
[1:08:51] the old days with the message
[1:08:52] obey God a pilot token was people were
[1:08:55] interpreting that as take the TV outside
[1:08:57] and shoot it with a shotgun throw your
[1:09:00] wife's Immortal clothes out the window
[1:09:01] throwers high heels out the window say
[1:09:04] we're applying but that's not it but for
[1:09:07] those households that just the husband
[1:09:09] just begin to live the word of God and
[1:09:11] live in obedience to the word of God
[1:09:14] what happened the house began to change
[1:09:17] because the atmosphere changed when
[1:09:20] you're in obedience to the word of God
[1:09:22] the atmosphere that you create in your
[1:09:24] home
[1:09:26] brings your home in line with the word
[1:09:28] of God
[1:09:32] now we we brought this scripture up
[1:09:36] um
[1:09:37] in the beginning Rebellion is the sin of
[1:09:39] Witchcraft so Disobedience this
[1:09:41] rebellion and Rebellion is as the sin of
[1:09:44] Witchcraft witchcraft could take that
[1:09:47] many different rays but it's Antichrist
[1:09:49] and in Christ's spirit so stubbornness
[1:09:51] is as iniquity and idolatry now you can
[1:09:53] be determined
[1:09:57] but stubbornness
[1:09:58] is the resistance to change
[1:10:02] resistance to change so you're you're
[1:10:05] refusing to surrender to the word of God
[1:10:09] what's the the
[1:10:13] big thing in modern culture today
[1:10:16] I think that's gonna I think we're gonna
[1:10:17] do that one coming up but the big thing
[1:10:20] in modern culture is oh yes stand for
[1:10:22] your rights rebel against the you know
[1:10:26] the rebel against well what's what what
[1:10:28] it is in the world
[1:10:30] be stubborn
[1:10:32] you starting you're starting to see that
[1:10:34] in the message
[1:10:37] the message culture
[1:10:39] stand with it you know well don't stand
[1:10:42] with it unless it's the word of God
[1:10:47] okay so disobedience is rebellion
[1:10:51] now I brought the scripture in here
[1:10:53] because it says o foolish Galatians this
[1:10:56] is in Galatians 3 1 who hath Bewitched
[1:10:58] you that ye should not obey the truth
[1:11:00] before whose eye Jesus Christ hath been
[1:11:03] evidently set forth crucified among you
[1:11:05] now Rebellion is as the sin of
[1:11:07] Witchcraft and Paul could use any word
[1:11:10] he wanted to use here but he uses the
[1:11:12] word Bewitched
[1:11:13] so you see the Galatians and the church
[1:11:16] begin to disobey the word of God
[1:11:19] because Disobedience to the word of God
[1:11:22] is is saying well well we'll take this
[1:11:24] part and leave this part out
[1:11:26] now you can be disobedient to all of it
[1:11:28] or a portion of it either way you're
[1:11:30] still disobedient to the word of God
[1:11:32] because it's all the word
[1:11:34] okay so the full the foolish Galatians
[1:11:36] begin to mix their the message of their
[1:11:39] hour with doctrines of men
[1:11:43] and bewitched the people through
[1:11:45] Rebellion which is Disobedience to God's
[1:11:48] word
[1:11:49] so you see you see problems begin to
[1:11:52] form in your children I'm not talking
[1:11:53] about little things like
[1:11:55] kids do I'm talking about habitual
[1:11:58] problems in your family of rebellion are
[1:12:02] you applying the whole word of God to
[1:12:04] your life
[1:12:05] are you applying all the word
[1:12:08] are you in obedience to Christ
[1:12:12] so because they they left The Obedience
[1:12:15] of the word of God the people
[1:12:18] were Bewitched
[1:12:20] Rebellion came into their midst and
[1:12:22] caused them all kinds of problems
[1:12:25] so when you have the word of God
[1:12:29] it's either all the word or it's nothing
[1:12:32] to deny one part is to deny the whole
[1:12:37] the problem with this is is I see people
[1:12:39] who pre who who who who profess who live
[1:12:43] this
[1:12:44] but you see little things in their homes
[1:12:48] little things in their lives
[1:12:51] that they refuse to change
[1:12:54] and the problem is what happens where I
[1:12:57] didn't expect this to come out so
[1:12:58] straight tonight the problem is however
[1:13:01] you
[1:13:03] whenever you begin to depart from Lord
[1:13:07] whenever you begin to depart from
[1:13:08] humility
[1:13:11] you fail to look at the word of God as a
[1:13:16] mirror
[1:13:19] you know you know the word of God can
[1:13:21] it's um
[1:13:25] your vision of the word of God can cause
[1:13:28] your mirror to fall you ever taken a
[1:13:30] taking a shower you get out can't see
[1:13:31] the mirror it's all fogged up
[1:13:35] you see the word of God is always the
[1:13:37] word of God
[1:13:39] but it's your vision that can fog up and
[1:13:42] whenever you depart from humility
[1:13:46] and pride takes over you fail you're
[1:13:50] looking at the word of God as a fogged
[1:13:52] mirror
[1:13:54] she said oh I kinda I kind of see myself
[1:13:56] yeah I'm a Christian yes I'm a Christian
[1:13:59] but things come in see the problem is
[1:14:02] not the problem is not mistakes the
[1:14:04] problem is not uh failures the problem
[1:14:06] is
[1:14:08] the losing the desire to grow
[1:14:12] and losing the inability to look at your
[1:14:16] own humanity and say God I need your
[1:14:18] grace
[1:14:19] we all have to grow
[1:14:23] always
[1:14:25] and whenever you serve God in that way
[1:14:27] of God show me what I'm show me what I'm
[1:14:29] doing wrong
[1:14:30] so that I can allow you to fix it
[1:14:33] guess what you will always grow
[1:14:37] and little things won't submit as long
[1:14:39] as you apply the word to your home and
[1:14:41] to your family little things won't slip
[1:14:43] in and when they do sometimes they do
[1:14:46] but when they do God shows you and you
[1:14:48] say okay
[1:14:49] and you go on you and you deal with it
[1:14:55] so here's the thing about Disobedience
[1:14:58] now we all want to be connected to
[1:15:00] Christ
[1:15:01] we'll have the desire to be one with God
[1:15:04] but when when we begin to to say well
[1:15:07] I'm not gonna
[1:15:08] I'm going to now here's here's the
[1:15:11] here's the thing
[1:15:12] I I just I struggle to put this
[1:15:14] correctly so the Lord just gonna have to
[1:15:16] say it to your heart
[1:15:20] this isn't blatant disobedience
[1:15:22] this is reason
[1:15:25] nobody sets out to blatantly no
[1:15:28] Christian sets out to sublately disobey
[1:15:30] God
[1:15:31] they just begin to
[1:15:33] to to spend less time with him
[1:15:37] and the world the world what is the
[1:15:39] world like
[1:15:40] a flood
[1:15:43] you ever seen you ever seen and in
[1:15:45] person or on a film when when there's
[1:15:47] rain torrential rain in the mountains
[1:15:49] and all of a sudden all the washes in
[1:15:51] the desert just boom they're a raging
[1:15:54] River that's the enemy
[1:15:55] and if you don't if you don't if you
[1:15:57] don't have the cross if you don't have
[1:15:58] Christ keeping the flood back
[1:16:01] it get it's it's always a flood okay so
[1:16:04] so you say well in Little Things little
[1:16:07] disobediences come in
[1:16:09] slowly over time
[1:16:12] you see
[1:16:14] something begins to push you from God
[1:16:17] now
[1:16:19] concrete walls are very sound resistant
[1:16:25] so as you as you say well I don't want
[1:16:27] that part and and now subconsciously
[1:16:30] you're still coming to church you're
[1:16:32] still serving God but little things here
[1:16:34] slipped in here slipping uh it was it
[1:16:38] was only clean movies and it was a few
[1:16:40] words here and then it was a few more
[1:16:42] words and and then it was well we'll
[1:16:44] just fast forward that part and and and
[1:16:46] and and the lord the devil just creeps
[1:16:48] in Brick by Brick by Brick till you're
[1:16:51] in a position where you have no
[1:16:53] connection with Christ you're going to
[1:16:54] church
[1:16:55] do you have no connection with Christ
[1:16:58] a wall has been built up slowly Brick by
[1:17:02] Brick because of your Disobedience to
[1:17:04] the word of God
[1:17:05] so now you're separated from Christ
[1:17:09] the cool thing is
[1:17:11] God has a giant sledgehammer
[1:17:15] and he can come and he can he can bring
[1:17:17] that wall right back down
[1:17:20] through the word of God but you know
[1:17:23] what with every brick that builds up
[1:17:26] that's a brick that has to be taken down
[1:17:30] so we humans we we have layers so so we
[1:17:35] have we have complexes in our life that
[1:17:37] build up
[1:17:38] and offenses that come along that build
[1:17:41] up
[1:17:42] all of this the all of that this does is
[1:17:44] this just limits your contact with
[1:17:47] Christ
[1:17:49] each block
[1:17:51] is what a block of unbelief
[1:17:54] Disobedience to the word of God is just
[1:17:56] unbelief and unbelief is sin
[1:18:00] little things come in and and the next
[1:18:02] thing you know you
[1:18:03] you can't even see Christ
[1:18:07] one of the one of the fundamentalist
[1:18:09] things in the word of God is go to
[1:18:11] church and read your Bible
[1:18:14] yet you see Christians
[1:18:16] who who moved to places or go to places
[1:18:19] where there's no church
[1:18:20] or they stay somewhere there's no church
[1:18:23] or you see young people who don't read
[1:18:25] their Bible
[1:18:26] adults who don't read their Bible but
[1:18:28] they still go to church
[1:18:31] but you see
[1:18:32] a wall has been built up and if a wall
[1:18:36] has been built up in your life and you
[1:18:37] can't see Christ your home will never be
[1:18:40] balanced
[1:18:41] because you cannot find balance in the
[1:18:43] home outside of obedience to the word of
[1:18:46] God and how can you obey something you
[1:18:49] can't even see
[1:18:52] but you gotta have
[1:18:54] but see God is rich in Mercy and God
[1:18:56] comes along
[1:18:58] now I wanted to just look at the
[1:19:00] attributes of rebellion
[1:19:03] I know this is this is heavy right but
[1:19:05] we're gonna we're gonna get to the
[1:19:07] positive side I'm not gonna let you go
[1:19:09] home
[1:19:09] like this because you know what
[1:19:15] we are more than conquerors
[1:19:20] so a few a few attributes of rebellion
[1:19:22] I'm not saying these are all of them but
[1:19:26] some of the attributes of rebellion or
[1:19:27] idolatry contempt and lying
[1:19:32] now idolatry
[1:19:33] Exodus 20 verse 3 says Thou shalt have
[1:19:35] no other gods before me now what I said
[1:19:37] earlier is the best example of what to
[1:19:40] do what not to do is just look at the
[1:19:42] family of God in the scriptures
[1:19:44] what do they do
[1:19:45] you know what did David do why did
[1:19:47] Absalom just completely rebel against
[1:19:50] David because David disobeyed the word
[1:19:53] and took Bathsheba
[1:19:56] that's an extreme example right
[1:19:59] hopefully none of us have sons who are
[1:20:02] taking our homes over
[1:20:04] kicking us out but that's an extreme
[1:20:06] example so
[1:20:09] the word says Thou shalt have no other
[1:20:11] gods before me now disobedience is
[1:20:13] rebellion okay so in Nehemiah 9 verse 17
[1:20:17] to 18 Nehemiah is is reiterating the
[1:20:19] history of Israel on their way to the
[1:20:22] promised land and they refused to obey
[1:20:25] neither were mindful of thy Wonders that
[1:20:27] thou didst among them but hardened their
[1:20:29] next and in their Rebellion appointed a
[1:20:32] captain to return to their bondage now
[1:20:36] what's up they're returned to their body
[1:20:40] who wants to go back to their bondage
[1:20:43] you see how the devil how the devil
[1:20:45] works it who wants to obey the word of
[1:20:48] God none of you are going to raise your
[1:20:49] hands disobey no no you want to disobey
[1:20:51] the word of God none of you're going to
[1:20:52] raise your hands none of the Egyptians
[1:20:54] wanted to go back to slavery
[1:20:57] but yet they raise the captain said take
[1:20:58] us back to Egypt
[1:21:00] what happened
[1:21:02] a disconnect a wall was built up they
[1:21:05] sat on the desert the desert for 40 days
[1:21:08] No Moses
[1:21:10] everything was quiet sometimes you sit
[1:21:12] in the desert of your life for 40 days
[1:21:14] no word from God what's going on
[1:21:18] see God wants to try our faith sometimes
[1:21:23] and um
[1:21:24] but thou art a God now here here's the
[1:21:27] thing you see this colon that's like
[1:21:31] that's a transition
[1:21:33] that's that
[1:21:34] that's the other side the paradigm shift
[1:21:38] says oh this is how the they were but
[1:21:41] God you are ready to pardon
[1:21:44] gracious you're merciful you're slow to
[1:21:47] anger you're of great kindness and you
[1:21:50] forsook them not
[1:21:52] what is the best example of a father or
[1:21:55] Heavenly Father
[1:21:59] yea when they had made them a molten cap
[1:22:03] excuse me and said this is thy God that
[1:22:06] brought thee up out of Egypt and had
[1:22:07] brought great provocations so they made
[1:22:10] themselves an image
[1:22:13] so you see they begin to rebel against
[1:22:15] God they say we're going to have a
[1:22:17] captain we're gonna go back we're gonna
[1:22:19] refuse to obey we're gonna go we're back
[1:22:20] to Egypt and the the the the you said we
[1:22:24] could look at it and say well well they
[1:22:26] built a golden calf and they rebelled no
[1:22:28] the golden calf was a byproduct of their
[1:22:31] Rebellion
[1:22:32] it was an attribute of their Rebellion
[1:22:35] idolatry now brother Stephen just put it
[1:22:37] beautifully when he brought about the
[1:22:38] Ark of the Covenant and how the children
[1:22:40] of Israel had made it idolatry and so if
[1:22:43] you're not careful in your hope you will
[1:22:44] make going to church an idol
[1:22:48] in your home
[1:22:50] you see well why why why you don't ever
[1:22:53] have conversations there's no you don't
[1:22:55] represent Christ to your family
[1:22:58] church becomes an idol
[1:23:00] and and and and I speak from experience
[1:23:03] having friends who whose families were
[1:23:05] like this none of them serve God none of
[1:23:08] the children serve God
[1:23:10] because church was an idol
[1:23:14] church was was hey we go and and and we
[1:23:17] do this because
[1:23:18] you know you want to go play you got to
[1:23:20] sit in your chair and read your Bible
[1:23:21] for 10 minutes that's that's Catholicism
[1:23:25] okay there never was the a heart there's
[1:23:28] always wherever you find God you find
[1:23:31] heart
[1:23:32] you find feeling emotion
[1:23:36] God is there you know we we say we don't
[1:23:39] trust God by his feelings and that is
[1:23:41] that is fundamentally true but she
[1:23:43] always you know he's there
[1:23:45] you have faith you know he's there
[1:23:49] there's heart if you want your children
[1:23:52] to love God you have to love them
[1:23:54] unconditionally
[1:23:56] because we're showing them an example of
[1:23:58] what a father should be
[1:24:03] yeah so
[1:24:06] they made the calf the idolatry was a
[1:24:08] byproduct of the Rebellion now another
[1:24:11] attribute of rebellion is contempt
[1:24:15] and and you see this in in in in
[1:24:17] especially in in
[1:24:19] um
[1:24:21] uh when someone when someone is
[1:24:23] rebellious
[1:24:24] they're an utter contempt
[1:24:26] they don't they could care less what you
[1:24:28] want
[1:24:29] what you ask them to do
[1:24:32] they want to do the opposite
[1:24:34] pick you know contempt of court right
[1:24:37] they're you're rebelling against
[1:24:39] Authority the judges The Authority in
[1:24:42] the courtroom representing the United
[1:24:43] States and you rebel against him you are
[1:24:47] what's called contempt of court
[1:24:49] so you the word of God comes and and you
[1:24:51] say you know what
[1:24:53] it but you see contempt
[1:24:56] is a byproduct of Disobedience to the
[1:25:00] word of God Saul look at the life of
[1:25:03] Saul after this moment with Samuel
[1:25:06] you had idolatry
[1:25:08] you had contempt
[1:25:10] trying to kill David
[1:25:14] trying to Slit calls calls his men to
[1:25:17] slay all the high Priests of the of the
[1:25:20] of God talk about rebellion to God he
[1:25:23] says well God then he says well God has
[1:25:25] left me
[1:25:26] yeah of course
[1:25:29] there was disobedience
[1:25:31] so content the scripture here when the
[1:25:34] wicked cometh then cometh also contempt
[1:25:36] and with with uh
[1:25:39] ignominy reproach and that's like oh
[1:25:42] open shame and and uh it's just shameful
[1:25:46] Behavior
[1:25:47] so
[1:25:48] the scripture here
[1:25:50] just to show
[1:25:52] uh contempt is
[1:25:54] of Disobedience the wicked wicked or
[1:25:57] disobedient
[1:25:58] uh lying
[1:26:00] um in in uh father the hour has come but
[1:26:02] the RAM says now he thought he had the
[1:26:05] spirit of God but it was a lying spirit
[1:26:07] because it was contrary to the word of
[1:26:10] God I remember remember what is
[1:26:11] disobedience
[1:26:13] it's rebelling against the word of God
[1:26:20] now if people say signs and wonders
[1:26:22] don't follow it's a lying Spirits
[1:26:24] contrary to the word though if the Bible
[1:26:25] says that people tells you the Holy
[1:26:27] Ghost ain't in this day the same as it
[1:26:29] was the other days it's a lying Spirit
[1:26:31] that's in false prophets they're telling
[1:26:33] you a lie
[1:26:35] it just okay all liberation of women and
[1:26:38] do all these other things and go out and
[1:26:40] act like the world it's a lying spirit
[1:26:41] it's not lined up with the word stay in
[1:26:43] the word right stay right there so so
[1:26:46] when you begin to disobey the word of
[1:26:49] God and find Disobedience to the word of
[1:26:51] God
[1:26:52] from that comes the lying spirit
[1:26:55] because because you're rebelling against
[1:26:57] the word of God and uh the Lord needed
[1:27:02] someone to cause Ahab to Rebel
[1:27:06] and go out and fight the battle anyway
[1:27:08] so he could die
[1:27:10] so to bring in the prophecy to pass so
[1:27:13] God didn't send down you know um what
[1:27:16] God chose to do was allow a lying spirit
[1:27:20] so Ahab was already in Rebellion to the
[1:27:22] word of God because he said well yeah
[1:27:24] there's one more but he never tells me
[1:27:25] what I want to hear
[1:27:27] so from that came this lying Spirit now
[1:27:31] now these are these are these are
[1:27:32] attributes of rebellion
[1:27:35] but
[1:27:38] you don't have to have
[1:27:40] a rebellious Spirit to to have problems
[1:27:43] with lying but you have
[1:27:45] you have all of these things then
[1:27:47] together
[1:27:50] now you you there's a problem you see
[1:27:52] whenever whenever there's there's a
[1:27:54] there's a problem in the home there's a
[1:27:56] problem with with your marriage or
[1:27:58] there's a problem with your children
[1:28:00] don't go after
[1:28:02] don't go after the surface
[1:28:05] find the cause
[1:28:08] if you got a weed in your in your yard
[1:28:10] you don't go out there and snip the
[1:28:11] leaves
[1:28:12] You Pull It by The Roots
[1:28:15] and and and pride and jealousy those
[1:28:19] things can come from bitterness
[1:28:23] lying flying it what does lying come
[1:28:25] from lying could come from somebody who
[1:28:27] was hurt
[1:28:29] so they have a deep wound that's never
[1:28:32] healed properly where somebody didn't
[1:28:35] treat them right or somebody laughed at
[1:28:37] them made fun of them so now
[1:28:39] Pride covers them with lies
[1:28:44] so we say well you can't be a liar you
[1:28:46] can't be a liar what maybe your behavior
[1:28:50] as a parent is causing them to be that
[1:28:54] way
[1:28:55] because if you're not loving your
[1:28:56] children unconditionally you are in
[1:28:59] Disobedience to the word of God
[1:29:02] because we are to love
[1:29:04] each other like Christ loved the church
[1:29:07] especially in the home as Christ gave
[1:29:10] himself for the church that's the duty
[1:29:13] of the husbands to love his wife in the
[1:29:14] same way so you see Rebellion you say a
[1:29:16] lying in your family are you treating
[1:29:19] them
[1:29:21] the way the word of God says or are you
[1:29:22] just applying rules to your home
[1:29:27] you got to put you got to put a heart
[1:29:29] you got to put feeling you got to put
[1:29:32] love into how you deal with them
[1:29:36] because the home is this now now let's
[1:29:39] lay this here the home is a sacred place
[1:29:42] and you're Duty bound to keep whatever
[1:29:45] like we heard it your duty bound to keep
[1:29:48] Sodom outside of the home
[1:29:51] but if you take that wickedness or that
[1:29:55] Sodom in front of your children you rip
[1:29:57] it up you break it up you throw it out
[1:30:00] you are doing it in love so you're being
[1:30:03] disobedient to the word of God you're
[1:30:05] going to cause your child to be
[1:30:07] rebellious
[1:30:09] you say you get that you know maybe it's
[1:30:11] a skirt that's not modest enough and you
[1:30:13] you come hard on them at that
[1:30:16] you're you're in no Disobedience of the
[1:30:18] word of God because you're not doing it
[1:30:19] through the love of Christ I can't get
[1:30:21] up here and preach to you in anger
[1:30:23] because you're not lining up with the
[1:30:25] word of God I have to get up here and
[1:30:26] show you the way show the error and do
[1:30:29] so in complete love when Jesus whipped
[1:30:32] them out of the temple the Bible
[1:30:34] he didn't do it he did it in love
[1:30:39] oh he was he was whipping them and he
[1:30:41] braided a whip and he did that but he
[1:30:42] was doing it in love he saw the sin and
[1:30:45] he saw you know what this is what they
[1:30:47] need to get the point across but it was
[1:30:50] in love and compassion
[1:30:53] I don't know how
[1:30:54] that's hard to do you have to be so then
[1:30:57] so then now in order for you to
[1:30:58] discipline your children and for you to
[1:31:00] raise them the way they should be
[1:31:02] that's you have us you have to live in a
[1:31:06] very special place in other words you
[1:31:07] have to live right next to Christ
[1:31:10] as close as possible because you will
[1:31:12] not be able to discipline in love unless
[1:31:14] you have the sweet softness of the holy
[1:31:17] spirit in your life and your home
[1:31:19] and if the holy if there's things in
[1:31:21] your home if Sodom is in your home the
[1:31:23] holy spirit will never feel welcome
[1:31:27] so then how can you discipline in love
[1:31:29] how can your home be lined up obedience
[1:31:31] to the word of God
[1:31:33] if Christ is not there
[1:31:37] you see it's it's not just you and okay
[1:31:39] I'm gonna serve God no now you gotta you
[1:31:42] gotta bring in you gotta bring it home
[1:31:46] you gotta bring that light into your
[1:31:49] home
[1:31:50] because if there's light guess what
[1:31:52] there's no Darkness
[1:32:04] so
[1:32:07] how do you deal with disobedience
[1:32:17] with obedience
[1:32:21] it's really that simple
[1:32:24] it it there's this quote right here
[1:32:28] there was a question asked and he says
[1:32:30] take exactly the best of that question
[1:32:31] was how do you change
[1:32:33] the summary of the questions
[1:32:36] take exactly the opposite if you're
[1:32:39] always wanting your way and that one
[1:32:41] little brat that wants to always have
[1:32:43] everything your way turn right back
[1:32:45] around and give everything you got the
[1:32:47] other way
[1:32:48] if you're selfish and you want to hold
[1:32:50] everything then start giving away what
[1:32:52] you got see just go the vice versa
[1:32:54] that's the way to overcome anything tell
[1:32:57] me what's left out of that word
[1:33:00] anything
[1:33:02] that's the way to overcome anything is
[1:33:04] an antidote
[1:33:05] do the opposite
[1:33:07] so if you if you find an Obe
[1:33:10] disobedience
[1:33:12] go the other way
[1:33:14] into obedience
[1:33:16] you see it's not about it's not about
[1:33:19] how do I how do I put this correctly
[1:33:21] it's not about well I need to I need to
[1:33:23] get rid of this problem
[1:33:25] no just do the opposite of it so don't
[1:33:28] put the focus you see you see a behavior
[1:33:30] in your your children
[1:33:32] and you don't you don't like it's not
[1:33:34] it's not good
[1:33:36] um find the root of that and begin to
[1:33:39] administer the opposite you know
[1:33:42] sometimes your children will lack act up
[1:33:44] simply because they're lacking the
[1:33:46] attention they need
[1:33:49] so say you say hey you need to
[1:33:50] straighten up knock it up now there's
[1:33:52] discipline for misbehavior there's
[1:33:54] disciplines
[1:33:56] but you wanna you know we're not there
[1:33:58] too we're not there to just discipline
[1:34:00] them to be good kids
[1:34:02] whether to show them the right way to go
[1:34:07] where they're to show them obedience
[1:34:11] so when you're when you're when you
[1:34:13] let's say you haven't you didn't you you
[1:34:16] missed breakfast busy morning you missed
[1:34:18] breakfast it's two o'clock in the
[1:34:19] afternoon you haven't had breakfast or
[1:34:21] lunch
[1:34:22] and you're hangry
[1:34:25] what good is it going to do for somebody
[1:34:27] to start yelling at you to straighten up
[1:34:29] knock it off
[1:34:30] no just go eat food and suddenly you're
[1:34:33] a sweet angel
[1:34:35] sometimes the antidote
[1:34:38] you have to look what's the root cause
[1:34:40] of this
[1:34:41] right now we're dealing with this with
[1:34:43] with my son he broke his collarbone and
[1:34:46] um
[1:34:47] I say well he you know he's acting up
[1:34:49] say what when's the last time you gave
[1:34:51] him some ibuprofen
[1:34:54] give it to him he's a sweet little angel
[1:34:55] again because he's in pain kids can't
[1:34:58] tell you my shoulder hurts that's why
[1:35:00] I'm grumpy
[1:35:04] so
[1:35:05] now there's misbehavior you correct that
[1:35:07] I'm not saying not to but what's the
[1:35:10] cause of it
[1:35:11] because we're trying to we're trying to
[1:35:13] mold them we we look at look how what a
[1:35:16] responsibility we have it's the gift
[1:35:17] that God has given us what a
[1:35:19] responsibility we have we want to raise
[1:35:22] them to be exactly how God wants them to
[1:35:24] be therefore we have to create an
[1:35:26] environment that puts pushes them
[1:35:30] pushes them to their absolute best
[1:35:34] you got a car and you wanted to perform
[1:35:36] to the max you're gonna do everything
[1:35:39] you're going to get better tires you're
[1:35:40] going to get you're going to get better
[1:35:42] you're gonna get the engine as best as
[1:35:44] you can get it you're gonna keep it
[1:35:45] oiled up and and you're gonna get the
[1:35:47] best brakes and you're gonna have the
[1:35:49] the best uh you know um
[1:35:51] air the most you need air to the engine
[1:35:55] you want it to be the biggest and the
[1:35:56] best right you're trying to put that car
[1:35:59] to the max that it can do
[1:36:01] well you that's the same with your
[1:36:03] children you invest and you invest and
[1:36:05] you invest so that they can be the best
[1:36:08] that they can be
[1:36:10] according to the word of God
[1:36:13] so sometimes our Focus gets off and we
[1:36:16] focus on correcting instead of
[1:36:20] instead we focus on correcting behavior
[1:36:23] on the defense instead of working the
[1:36:27] offense in our family
[1:36:29] what let me tell you this what good does
[1:36:32] the defense in a game of football do if
[1:36:34] the offense never scores a point
[1:36:38] it's the offense that wins the game it's
[1:36:41] the offense that that earns the points
[1:36:44] the defense assists the offense
[1:36:49] so if you're always on the defense and
[1:36:52] you're always making up for lost time
[1:36:53] and you're always you're just trying to
[1:36:56] to and you're just you're in this
[1:36:58] downward spiral of Defense you might be
[1:37:00] maintaining but you're never scoring
[1:37:03] points
[1:37:04] but it's significant to be on the
[1:37:06] offense take your wife out to dinner
[1:37:08] take your wife out on a date look when
[1:37:10] you got young kids
[1:37:12] I'm thinking from personal experience
[1:37:15] minimum once a week
[1:37:17] take take her out you don't have to go
[1:37:19] spend 75 or 120 it might be a four
[1:37:24] dollar Taco Tuesday
[1:37:26] at Del Taco
[1:37:29] but it's you and her alone now oh it's
[1:37:32] like
[1:37:34] but it's investing you say oh my wife
[1:37:37] she's just been acting up and now the
[1:37:39] the home and there's laundry everywhere
[1:37:42] and the dishes are dirty so what are you
[1:37:44] gonna do you're gonna say listen woman
[1:37:46] you need to do the dishes
[1:37:49] she's probably so strung out and
[1:37:52] stressed out because you have not
[1:37:53] invested anything in
[1:37:55] it's really hard
[1:37:58] again I'm speaking from experience it's
[1:38:00] really hard
[1:38:01] to emergency invest
[1:38:08] and put it this way
[1:38:10] you uh you own a commercial building
[1:38:12] and the sprinkler system
[1:38:15] isn't any good
[1:38:17] so you never invest in the sprinkler
[1:38:18] system and fix it and your billing
[1:38:21] catches on fire and it's burning to the
[1:38:22] ground
[1:38:23] you can't you
[1:38:25] you're gonna go fix the sprinkler system
[1:38:27] it's too late
[1:38:28] now you're calling a fire truck and now
[1:38:30] you have the new building it's expensive
[1:38:34] you got a problem with a leaky faucet so
[1:38:36] you neglect it
[1:38:38] and then it bursts in the middle of the
[1:38:39] night and now half your house is flooded
[1:38:43] it's expensive
[1:38:45] your wife your children are a leaking
[1:38:47] faucet and you don't quickly get on that
[1:38:50] and fix that and it explodes and you say
[1:38:52] well
[1:38:53] what will be will be
[1:38:56] no you missed your chance to offensively
[1:38:58] fix the problem
[1:39:00] to get in there while you had the time
[1:39:04] we all know
[1:39:06] we all know
[1:39:07] what we need to do what we need to do
[1:39:10] but we put it off
[1:39:12] you can't afford to put it off
[1:39:16] so when you're in obedience to the word
[1:39:18] of God you fix the leaky faucet
[1:39:22] naturally
[1:39:24] it's a byproduct it's it's by default
[1:39:27] because that's the spirit that's working
[1:39:29] inside of you because you're an
[1:39:31] obedience to the world you see you say
[1:39:33] wow Chris brother Chris I thought this
[1:39:34] was about the kids you're going to tell
[1:39:36] them how to obey I am
[1:39:38] you start obeying the word of God your
[1:39:40] kids will start obeying you
[1:39:44] you see it's not about control
[1:39:48] breeds Rebellion
[1:39:53] start going through history
[1:39:55] every Rebellion started with a dictator
[1:39:59] pretty much
[1:40:01] we rebelled from England because they
[1:40:04] started to be dictators
[1:40:07] we uh England rebelled you know the
[1:40:10] Scottish rebelled against whoever or the
[1:40:12] Ireland rebelled right because they
[1:40:13] started to control beyond what they sh
[1:40:16] right they went from being a king and a
[1:40:18] leader to control and a dictator it
[1:40:21] breeds Rebellion it's just that's a
[1:40:23] human principle
[1:40:27] so now
[1:40:29] I wanted to read this the rest of this
[1:40:31] passage here in Nehemiah you can turn if
[1:40:33] you want but it's Nehemiah 9 19.
[1:40:35] so he says they they made a golden a
[1:40:38] molten calf and said This is Our God you
[1:40:40] know read that scripture earlier talking
[1:40:41] about Disobedience but verse 19 it says
[1:40:43] he says this yet thou and thy manifold
[1:40:46] mercies forsookest them not in the
[1:40:48] wilderness the pillar of the cloud
[1:40:51] departed not from them by day to lead
[1:40:53] them in the way neither the pillar of
[1:40:55] Fire by night to show them light and the
[1:40:58] way wherein they should go so they were
[1:41:01] disobedient to God now he punished them
[1:41:05] he punished them but he gave them the
[1:41:07] choice first who's going to come stand
[1:41:09] with Moses even those that did wrong
[1:41:11] including Aaron came stood by Moses
[1:41:13] Aaron was the high priest
[1:41:15] he said well Aaron built the calf yes
[1:41:17] but God had mercy
[1:41:18] so you you say your children
[1:41:20] Disobedience you don't respond to
[1:41:23] disobedience in your family
[1:41:26] by shunning them
[1:41:28] and turning your back on them
[1:41:31] no you you come in you correct it
[1:41:34] however however that whatever that looks
[1:41:36] like for the situation every situation
[1:41:38] is a little bit different however it
[1:41:40] looks you know maybe it's okay I'm gonna
[1:41:41] take that toy for a few hours I'm gonna
[1:41:43] take that toy for a while depending on
[1:41:45] the age there's age-appropriate
[1:41:46] discipline
[1:41:47] but you correct the behavior but you're
[1:41:49] right there to say dad loves you
[1:41:52] you're discipline you pull them right in
[1:41:54] give them a big hug you don't you don't
[1:41:56] get to after them and they just walk
[1:41:58] away
[1:41:59] no you you show them hey I I'm with you
[1:42:01] I love you we're we're gonna figure this
[1:42:04] out together
[1:42:05] you're standing by look right in the
[1:42:07] middle of this third Disobedience God
[1:42:09] walks with them now you say well yeah
[1:42:11] but then they got to the promised land
[1:42:13] and they refused to obey the word of God
[1:42:15] and refuse to go into the promised land
[1:42:17] and his judgment was 40 years in the
[1:42:20] desert but guess what he did during that
[1:42:22] time verse 21.
[1:42:24] he's sustained them in the wilderness
[1:42:28] so that they lacked nothing
[1:42:30] their clothes waxed not old and their
[1:42:33] feet swelled not
[1:42:36] in their punishment
[1:42:39] God took care of them
[1:42:41] because at the end of the day we are
[1:42:43] always
[1:42:44] they were always God's children he
[1:42:48] punished them and sent them to Babylon
[1:42:50] and what did he do
[1:42:52] they all got rich
[1:42:54] they married they had communities they
[1:42:56] prospered
[1:42:58] even in their punishment
[1:43:01] God still took care of them
[1:43:05] so let's bring that home now
[1:43:08] mom and dad
[1:43:09] even in your discipline
[1:43:12] you know you make sure they know you
[1:43:14] love them and you're there to take care
[1:43:16] of them
[1:43:17] and you're disappointing them not
[1:43:19] because you don't like them not because
[1:43:24] you're mad at them
[1:43:26] don't ever tie your emotions
[1:43:30] to your correction
[1:43:34] your emotions need to be apart from that
[1:43:36] your children should never serve you
[1:43:37] because of your emotions
[1:43:40] you don't say now you do this because
[1:43:42] you you know you're going to make mom
[1:43:43] and dad feel good no
[1:43:46] never do that
[1:43:47] you do it because God says to do it
[1:43:51] that's your moral compass your parents
[1:43:53] emotions is not your moral compass
[1:43:54] otherwise you raise you raise children
[1:43:58] who are men Pleasers
[1:44:01] and they want to keep everybody happy so
[1:44:03] they'll do the wrong thing
[1:44:05] they'll they'll do something that's
[1:44:06] detrimental to their own health to their
[1:44:08] own family
[1:44:10] to make their boss happy
[1:44:12] no your parents your kids never listen
[1:44:14] to you to make you happy
[1:44:16] they listen to you because the Bible
[1:44:18] says obey mom and dad
[1:44:22] so when you correct them then you're you
[1:44:24] have to do a home man I got I got
[1:44:26] fingers point back at me
[1:44:28] all right I'm a passionate person
[1:44:30] my emotions and
[1:44:33] I have to sometimes I gotta say honey
[1:44:36] I need you to handle this one and I walk
[1:44:38] away
[1:44:40] otherwise my emotions are in my
[1:44:42] correction God corrects Us in his love
[1:44:45] his love is corrective his love is
[1:44:48] correct
[1:44:49] his love
[1:44:50] is corrective
[1:44:52] so again his love
[1:44:54] is corrected so if you're correcting
[1:44:56] outside of love you are in Disobedience
[1:44:58] to the word of God and what is
[1:45:00] disobedience
[1:45:03] Rebellion
[1:45:05] say yeah my kids I don't know they
[1:45:07] picked up an attitude at school or
[1:45:08] something hanging out with the wrong
[1:45:09] kids their rebellion and everything I
[1:45:11] say no you caused that
[1:45:18] thank you
[1:45:22] okay but even in that God took care of
[1:45:25] them he gave them Manna for their mouth
[1:45:28] and water for their thirst
[1:45:40] don't punish your children with food
[1:45:45] that's my opinion
[1:45:47] acts 5 29 then Peter and the other
[1:45:49] Apostles answered and said we ought to
[1:45:51] obey God rather than men now what is
[1:45:54] what is our subject the balanced home
[1:45:58] you do not have to obey
[1:46:02] your parents
[1:46:04] outside of the word of God
[1:46:10] you're still have to honor them
[1:46:14] but you don't have to obey them outside
[1:46:16] of the word of God
[1:46:18] now there's ways to handle this
[1:46:21] okay I have no I don't know no situation
[1:46:24] here in the Church of this so I'm just
[1:46:27] speaking maybe to somebody on the
[1:46:29] Internet or maybe a future situation but
[1:46:31] if you're if your dad says okay you're
[1:46:33] not allowed to go to church anymore you
[1:46:35] don't just say well I'll tell you what
[1:46:37] and you march out no you go to your
[1:46:39] pastor you say hey we have this problem
[1:46:41] pray with me on how to handle this
[1:46:43] because you're still have to honor your
[1:46:46] father and mother
[1:46:48] you have to show them that honor that's
[1:46:51] fundamental truth that's the Ten
[1:46:52] Commandments
[1:46:54] so when you apply the word of God to
[1:46:57] your your life you have to make sure you
[1:46:59] are doing it
[1:47:01] with unconditional love you have to make
[1:47:02] sure you're doing it according to the
[1:47:04] word of God
[1:47:05] so just to drop that in there
[1:47:08] and we are his Witnesses of these things
[1:47:10] and so is also the Holy Ghost now
[1:47:13] so this is the same sermon Peter's
[1:47:15] preaching to the Pharisees and the
[1:47:16] Sadducees and he's a couple verses later
[1:47:19] he says this
[1:47:20] so also is the Holy Ghost whom God hath
[1:47:23] given to them that obey him
[1:47:26] do you see our hope tonight you're
[1:47:28] seeing the how how foundational
[1:47:30] obedience is
[1:47:33] and it has to be taught and has to be
[1:47:35] learned
[1:47:37] so you you want to raise your children
[1:47:39] to understand obedience as Paramount in
[1:47:41] their relationship with Christ
[1:47:44] and that obedience to the word of God is
[1:47:47] what brings the Holy Ghost
[1:47:51] because the you know there's fundamental
[1:47:53] things God lays out repent people has
[1:47:55] the name of Jesus Christ when you obey
[1:47:56] those things you're you're preparing the
[1:48:00] way for the Holy Ghost to come
[1:48:03] obedience to the word of God it brings
[1:48:05] us blessing now
[1:48:09] so that's how important to God obedience
[1:48:12] is to God
[1:48:16] wow it's already 9 15. I am sorry okay
[1:48:19] well we'll finish this up casting down
[1:48:21] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:48:23] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[1:48:25] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:48:27] thought to The Obedience of Christ so we
[1:48:30] have to bring ourselves to The Obedience
[1:48:32] of Christ we have to bring our thoughts
[1:48:34] captivity to The Obedience of Christ how
[1:48:37] by applying the word in our lives and in
[1:48:40] our families I knew this was going to be
[1:48:42] a big topic and um and when I get
[1:48:45] through all of it tonight and so we'll
[1:48:47] see what the Lord has in the store but I
[1:48:48] just want to hit on a couple of things
[1:48:50] right here and then we'll close
[1:48:52] faith is the foundation of obedience
[1:48:55] Trust
[1:48:57] you want your kids to obey you
[1:49:00] you got to have you have to build that
[1:49:02] trust so they know no matter what no
[1:49:05] matter what
[1:49:08] dad loves me because unconditional love
[1:49:10] is the foundation of faith
[1:49:14] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[1:49:17] for us he burst he birthed our faith
[1:49:20] within us by his unconditional love it's
[1:49:24] not what we did
[1:49:25] it's Who We Are
[1:49:29] you can never you can't I forget I might
[1:49:34] say this wrong forgive me I think you
[1:49:35] get the point you can never not be your
[1:49:38] father's child I think I said that wrong
[1:49:41] but whatever you get the point
[1:49:42] you can't do anything to take that away
[1:49:46] it's because of who he is and who you
[1:49:49] are and then you have faith in him
[1:49:52] because he loves you
[1:49:59] so
[1:50:00] obedience fruits of the spirit is a
[1:50:02] great place to start
[1:50:05] in closing
[1:50:07] here not long ago I was in the west
[1:50:09] heard of an Indian got converted said
[1:50:10] how you feel it chief after a few days
[1:50:12] he said well pretty good pretty bad said
[1:50:14] what do you mean pretty good said well
[1:50:16] once I well since I got saved it said
[1:50:18] there's two dogs in me said one's black
[1:50:20] one's white they just fight all the time
[1:50:22] so the black dog wants me to do bad and
[1:50:25] the good dog wants me to do or the white
[1:50:27] dog wants me to do good said which one
[1:50:29] wins Chief said depends on which one
[1:50:31] Chief feeds the most
[1:50:34] right that's what it comes down to you
[1:50:37] want obedience in your home
[1:50:40] the word of God
[1:50:41] needs to be in your home
[1:50:44] let's bow our heads
[1:50:49] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus

[1:51:03] it's a big responsibility father to to
[1:51:06] at some points as I've said time and
[1:51:09] again while preaching this series it
[1:51:11] it's it would seem impossible sometimes
[1:51:13] but you love The Impossible
[1:51:17] because if it's impossible and it
[1:51:19] happens
[1:51:20] then all the glory goes to you because
[1:51:23] with God nothing is impossible
[1:51:26] for you to help us Lord to take take
[1:51:28] these things Lord begin to apply them in
[1:51:30] our homes and help us because the

[1:51:35] one in control
[1:51:36] and if we yield to you if we yield to
[1:51:40] the right side of the equation and we
[1:51:42] feed the spirit with the word of God the
[1:51:45] spirit man with the word of God this
[1:51:47] word of God is going to Prevail against
[1:51:49] every situation in our home
[1:51:51] forgive us Lord for the times we
[1:51:54] corrected outside of love
[1:51:55] that we got our emotions all caught up
[1:51:59] Lord I believe you can redeem the time
[1:52:01] that we've lost
[1:52:03] to our mistakes and raising our children
[1:52:05] Lord
