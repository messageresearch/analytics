praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god aren't you glad we're not constrained to a location or a certain time to praise the lord but we can get up in the morning and praise him we can be working praise him you can be sitting in traffic on the freeway and praise him amen well god bless you amen where's never a visitor as it were in the house of god but god bless you good to see you and uh god bless you brother and sister visitors here uh pray that the lord just bless you today and uh to worship with us amen now we don't want to forget uh communion tonight five o'clock so uh all that can make it we sure encourage you it's one of those things that was commanded by the scripture and um kind of taken this upon myself we made great progress the brothers have but we are going to not have church this coming wednesday so that brother david sister ruth were witnesses last night of the chaos that we had in the building and look how nice it looks this morning but we want to just press forward in this coming week again so all that are able to come and help you say i don't have a skill to do that we can give you a very quick tutorial and so anyway no wednesday night service as we press for finishing up the doors and baseboard and these kind of things that we're changing out in the church so communion at five o'clock let's stand and just go right into the word of god today uh once again just as the overview thought is the two sides of obedience uh there is my brother and sister the obvious side that we look in the scripture we'll try and expound or touch on this uh in the course of our thought today but um we really when you talk about obedience people have different ideas you know they say well are we following the church are we following a man but uh we place this above all else right this is the preeminence of what a christian follows it is not the church's point of view uh as far as a religion or denomination but the bible is our absolute and i hope today i can tie this together for you it seems as though it might be slightly disjointed in one sense but i i pray that uh you can catch this connection of mary's kind of faith uh you know it uh my brother and sister we often talk of mary you know the holiday season always brings about you know mary in some form fashion but um there's really much more to what happened in the life of mary and we won't even try to cover all of that today maybe in uh future services to do but to see the correlation or the connection uh of the very faith of the believer and mary it's just very much a very much a connection mary was not an isolated individual she was actually mainstream she was actually very much a representation of the effect of the gospel on humanity and so we'll just look today as we'll start here in 1st peter it will seem like we're going in a different direction but i want you to just remain with an open thought until we till we get to that and so as we start here first peter the first chapter verses one through nine peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithya elect according to the foreknowledge of god i just come across a little deal the other day and somebody arguing there's no such thing as predestination but when you take these back the scripture right here verse second is elect according to the foreknowledge of god so we would to to deny god the knowledge of who would serve him would be to deny this scripture and so we see elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through the sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied because we're not going to come back so much into this scripture i want to just bring in this small portion to you right now you see my brother and sister everything to do with the word of god and the christian life is centered around obedience you cannot say well i'm i do all of this but this part i disregard it is the sum of all parts that makes the whole so the scripture says that if you're guilty of the law in one small portion you're guilty of the whole law but we don't want to look at it that way we want to understand that we as sons and daughters of god have a desire to be obedient to all of the scripture not the portion that's convenient but all of it blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again into a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead amen lively hope can we emphasize that hey maybe we can even repeat that lively hope amen not old dead letter not a woe unto me but a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you now look um i don't mean to keep you standing but i just want to touch on these things because we're going to move on but it's reserved you know i mean i don't know how many of you have a favorite restaurant and you know it's busy and you know that uh if you call them there will be a table waiting for you now there are little things in the natural so don't hold me a hundred percent but you go there with the expectation now that they're not going to say who are you but they acknowledge are you mr and mrs yes your table is waiting reservation my brother and sister is very very incredible because you see this is reserved in heaven for you wow you're not going to get there you know the the figure they have of peter at the gate you're not going to get there and say sorry i can't find your name this is reserved they're going to come and because of the foreknowledge of god they're going to say welcome welcome hallelujah thank you lord who are kept by the power of god through faith into salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that pairs though it be tried with fire might be found into praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith come to worship you may we just enter into the word father claim our portion today apply it to our lives lord that we walk out happy and victorious in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated as we look at this scripture i want to use that to lay a foundation i've always liked this scripture for one it reminds me reminds us of the value of trials now if we just looked at trials for trials sake without a revelation of scripture we would look at that and say my my life is just full of all kinds of troubles and and uh why why is this befalling me but when we look through the scripture and realize how precious the scripture declares to us that trials are and we look at that and then it kind of changes our perspective uh because we as humans kind of tend to lean to things of intrinsic value we we recognize those and we hold to those and so when we look at trials in the uh face of the value and not of the present circumstance then we'll realize just how precious it is to us now clearly the believer right because we believe every word of god clearly the believer will embrace trials as a part of their christian experience we often joke sometimes you know when you find a young believer that they are there and they think that once they've come to the lord that their troubles are over and you know you want to just go ahead and leave them alone and let that be expressed in their life because otherwise you'd be going ha are you kidding me you have just started in your test you know that would discourage them right there but as it is you see as god is pouring faith and life and virtue into this new believer he's also pouring in this ability to accept the trials that come in life and and so it's there how beautiful that is but we always want to remain in the position of the will of god and not to you know come and be that be that individual that looks them in the face and says you better buckle down because all hell's gonna break loose in your life you know that that's not what it's about but you see my brother and sister we often times look at these as trials of the flesh in other words i i i i just have to admit as much as uh i desire a deliverance from this you know you you find yourself going through life and there's certain little struggles and if we don't let the pressure off they tend to build up you know as the little things start to happen in your life and and we we somehow get you might say charged with the stress of of these trials or these things in our life and you know all of a sudden we come and and uh you know we get a little cranky and we get a little stressful and we get a little grumpy and and quick to respond and and you know it's not that you don't love that person you care about them but the problem is is we're letting the stress on the cares of this life build up without releasing amen that's why we have to let off the pressure that's why we have to give these things to the lord because if we take them as trials in the flesh then everyone associated with that trial becomes part of the problem and that's what the devil would like he'd like to make a husband a part of the problem a wife a part of the problem the children the part of the problem and wait kids i didn't forget you your parents are part of the problem so you look at this and realize that if we view these troubles in the flesh we will look for a fleshly answer to the trouble but when we will come and we look at this and and uh say well i know this appears to be a trial of the flesh my husband came home from work and you know practically slammed the door i greeted him he grunted and walked off why my heap oh this and that and pretty soon the whole family reflects whatever but you know there's a nice story lovely little story about a man he had a lot of troubles and and uh you know this man noticed that every day when this man come home from work he stopped at this little tree and made the motions of hanging something in the tree and this individual asks him it says what are what are you doing he said well my family are not part of the problems i have at work and so i'm hanging my problems of work on the limb right here i'll pick it up in the morning when i go to work now he'd be doing much better if he could just leave it there and never pick it up again but at least he didn't take it in the door and subject the house to the troubles of work and so you know when we see these trials of the flesh or let me say this they seem to be trials of our flesh but really they're trials of our faith you see satan will disrupt he is a disrupter you know we have we have new titles that are coming out into our language and and uh you know things we never thought about before and you know you'll have people on social media and uh they become popular uh you know in some cases it's just because of personality maybe it's a subject matter they become popular and they have termed them to be influencers and so you know the world we live in today it's kind of scary you know i follow a couple couple interesting characters in the farm world on youtube and it's fun to see how they farm in the midwest and and whatnot and their influencers but it makes me sad when i figured out the man makes a couple hundred thousand a year talking to a a uh um a gopro and uh i i just like that's not fair that's not right that he can just talk to this thing and and people you know well people like myself watch him and then because i'm watching him something goes click somewhere and in the world everybody says we want to be on his little thing there and advertise because people are going to see our ads and they send him checks all because i was curious of what happens on a farm in minnesota but there's also a new term being brought in that's really actually an old term and so is influencer in reality disruptors and so in our society while we have a great preponderance to follow or look at the influencers we also find there's a negative out there where people like to follow the disrupters satan's the original disrupter and my when people get engrossed in following a disrupter it kind of makes you wonder if satan hasn't just tricked them into a spirit of instead of building up see now listen saints we can all get caught by that and find that when we should be lifting up we're pushing back or down but look at this now see these things are trials of our faith even though we don't really recognize it as a trial of our faith at that time but it truly is now example is is job and we'll look right here in this quote now remember when god has counted you worthy i'll catch you next time guys he told me my life has changed so radically okay but i love what he adds on the tail of this for the better what are we without discipline we're rebels we're rebels amen so you look at this now god given you a trial he's got confidence he don't have to baby you you're not a hotbed plant somebody lift a hand and say i'm not a hotbed plant you know i'm a real christian amen god giving you a test see what you'll do about it amen fiery trials why count it a joy it's more precious to you than gold and many times we hem and haw come on somebody say i do that oh well if i just well that well that's something god give you to overcome he knows you'll do it he's put his trust in you see i i love this because what it we see is a very thing that it is remember when you got saved we had all kinds of habits we had all kinds of things and some of them we deemed as not offensive but have you noticed as time has gone on that god has determined what's offensive and not and he's slowly taking these things out of our lives he doesn't come and say you know what if you don't get rid of that you're going to hell he just comes and just slowly removes these out of our life he just works on this to where we ourselves volunteer to give it up that's what i like amen sometimes it's cold turkey sometimes it's years that god slowly takes these things away from us now you look at that and i want to say today thank you lord for counting us worthy now i want to go into luke the first chapter in the 26th verse and i'm going to take a little direction change here and i just pray that you can follow me as we look at this so luke 1 and 26 is speaking of mary and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into the city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art despised highly favor now remember in scripture the woman speaks of the church which speaks of in the ultimate especially as we come in the book of revelation of the redeemed so here she is now the angel says to her thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she just being like you and i was trouble that is saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be what's going on here she had no benchmark or no reference point to go back and say oh yes i remember this happened to me before so in something entirely new now i want you to is is in his retirement speech one of his bosses says you know harvey has come to work every day for 32 years never missed a day now he wasn't always productive at work but he was here now what if that was said about us as christians going to church he was here every service but he wasn't always productive see that it's a compliment but not and so it's there that that we see now that she is stopped mary has stopped she's looking and pondering in her mind what manner is this salutation and the angel said unto here fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive if we don't get something beyond what the man shares with us then we haven't really achieved the goal so she says you know how shall i know this not knowing a man and the angel answered and said unto her see the perfect recipe for her is the perfect recipe for us in this day and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god now my brother and sister some people struggle over this and and certainly we don't want them to but my brother and sister the very word of god has come today and if jesus christ the son of god is not birthed in you and i we are just church attenders we are just there which means we can be influencers or interrupters without ever being truly saved i tell you if we just grasp that today the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee i'm telling you you can't go to church for 32 years or go to work for 32 years without being influenced when the holy ghost has come down upon you when the spirit of god has come and taken up residence in the soul amen it is a life-changing event amen and some people struggle with the idea that god is in them i know some churches don't teach that but it's right here in this scripture and my brother and sister if god is in you and i amen we have got him amen almighty god you can speak it in these terms i've got the holy ghost or the holy ghost has got me but it's there you know it's not just some little tickle in your toes it's a life-changing event hallelujah and so it's there that is he tells her you know as born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold that cousin elizabeth she shall also conceive a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren i like verse 37 we ought to post it look at it every day for with god nothing nothing somebody say that with me nothing shall be impossible now look i know these are hearts and i say this with love so please don't don't get discouraged by this but if you don't believe that's scripture right there with god nothing shall be impossible please don't even call yourself christian you have to accept the fact that god is in control and if we can't accept the fact that god's in control my brother and sister even when god allowed the hedge to be opened with job god was in control as i've told you before you see when it was there job just living life it's good he's living a prosperous life a happy life and then all of a sudden everything starts falling apart and if job had known that god had opened the hedge it might have discouraged him so much but you see god opened the hedge but he put a hedge around satan and satan now can only go so far and do so much everything he's doing if i could just give it to you an example and we see this happen our sons do this our daughters do this in life you know and you've told them now this is how sonia you operate the lawnmower and you know the boy is out there pushing or riding the lawnmower and what does he keep doing he keeps looking back to dad or he maybe even mom you know looking for that approval am i doing this right am i doing this right you see and so it's there the devil now with the hedge around him has to keep looking over his shoulder to see how's god reacting to what i'm doing right now he's contained amen some people think the devil well they say well well paul the scripture says he's going to and fro like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour just because he thinks he found someone to devour doesn't mean god opened the hedge to allow him to do it satan might identify you in your lowest moment have you ever noticed you ever notice husbands wives when there's friction between you things that would have never brought a reaction suddenly bring a reaction not even a hee-haw or yay or nay i must have hit close to home to you what happens is satan see he sees a weakness he sees something going on he sees a frustration maybe problems at work problems with a child whatever it might be and satan comes and becomes the irritant only he himself doesn't show up with pitchfork and horns to be the irritant he uses someone close to us or but last week when you were prayed up and you were on top of the mountain you'd have brushed that old devil off like nothing oh forgive me sisters you men sometimes you're just like well she's a woman unpredictable and cranky did you know when you say that it's usually you you thought all i was giving you men are pass but you see it's not because with the right spirit and the right attitude whatever friction was there is dealt with satan's pushed out but there's many a couple what started out as a simple thing led to divorce and you say how can that be because they let the irritation be the focus not reconciliation not finding out what and fixing it asking the lord to come in and move upon that but they started to focus focus on the irritation and you see that's what the devil's trying to do in all of these things of life he's trying to you know in your christian walk maybe you get sick and you're struggling you're in and out of the doctor's office at the hospital or many other examples could be used and after a while we say god's not a healer but i'm telling you my brother and sister my bible says he's a healer i don't care what some counsel of men have decided that that's for days gone by there was no expiration date put in the bible on the fact our god is a healer amen so people want to say well that applied to another day did it really show me the expiration date show me when god took it out we clearly know when he put it in but when did he take it out see that's the devil being the irritant to get you to look at something beside the word amen now look i've got to hurry up we got visitors this morning they'll never forgive me if i keep them too long for with god nothing shall be impossible i love this verse 38 mary's got a response you've got a response my brother and sister whatever is happening in your life you have a response it might be an angry response it might be a disappointed response it might be a critical response but we have a response oh god help us to put the right atmosphere and nature into our response and here is mary she's looking at something she's just now been you might say just blasted bombarded with this i'm gonna have a child i've never known a man and the angel says this child is going to be of the holy ghost i can see her go over there maybe grab her bible i mean we know it wasn't such in that day or at least we think we don't know or do know she didn't have an ipad siri has this ever happened before oh oh the bible says they'd come as angels the light i'm dismissing you she had that option but something down in her soul now let's tie this together let's tie this together her and joseph they're in spouse right they're engaged they did almost everything together joseph's building the house and they're doing this and doing that and maybe they were talking about the word of god maybe they were there in isaiah and it says you know what someday a virgin shall conceive and she turned to joseph and say this is strange how can this be joseph say i don't know i can't really explain it but it's in the scripture the prophet isaiah a tried and true proven prophet of god whose word has not failed he's vindicated said this would come to pass so you know what there is someday on the earth going to be a young woman who is going to have a child and his name shall be called jesus and he will be the prince of peace he will be the highest of the highest and the most glorified of all and this young woman will be the recipient of that anointing to have that child and now i can see it now saint because mary had a voice and she was a true believer she says you know what oh god could someone like me be maybe she felt a little something stir inside of her now she's standing there you see god never sends us into something without giving us preparation now whether preparation come and we didn't pay attention you know circa 8th grade teachers at the chalkboard next day pop quiz now what was that i put on the chalkboard i don't know but tarzan sure whipped up on that lion and then wrestled the python and i have no clue what she wrote on the board we don't always pay attention can someone say i i i know we don't always pay attention what the word's doing but see something in mary had responded and when now gabriel is speaking to her and says this will be of the holy ghost and she is there and she doesn't say now give me time to research this i need to go talk to the priest i need to go over here i want to go to the library but what is it something anointed her and she says behold now what is she doing she's giving her identification first right she's identifying she's speaking it out because you will obey your confession if you say i'm not i'm not much of a christian god wouldn't do this for me hey you're setting yourself up how about just speaking the words i am a son of god i'm a daughter of god i'll serve god all the days of my life and he promised that he would lead me and guide me to all truth so therefore i'm just going to believe it and what does she say behold i'm a handmaid behold the handmaid of the lord now look at this i'm not very good with this english amen i tell you you know you're not doing well when your teacher says i'm going to pass you because i don't want to deal with you again but you look at this now this semicolon or is that a colon semi that's what i thought you know what a semi is something large that carries a lot of faith with it not two wheels not four wheels but eighteen oh hallelujah behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me amen oh if we could just catch this revelation that it was on mary be it unto me according to thy word not my word not my thoughts not my theological understanding not what i learned in school but according to thy word let it be unto me oh hallelujah now see at that point right there because of her confession the angel you might could say he was successful in his mission and he didn't have to give her a whole bunch of coaching he didn't have to give her a whole bunch of reference points he didn't have to tell her to do this do that when she made that confession the angel departed now it didn't depart from her presence as it were like in a complete leaving but he didn't have to go she's already said i'll take that amen how about when we're in church and we can lift a hand or say amen to the word of god what are we telling god i accept that i claim a portion of that right there it's mine and sometimes it's quite incredible sometimes it's almost overwhelming but now you don't see mary going away from there saying well i i i'm gonna back up on this i don't know that was just you know under the uh emotion at the time you know i went to church with a friend and the preacher was preaching and something stirred in my heart and and i said lord i want to serve you forgive me of my sins and and then you go to work or school and you tell people i got saved over the weekend and they look at you in such a way and they act so awkward about this and then you start to back up but when someone says you know what from the depths of my heart be it unto me be it unto me i want to be a christian that's that's the life i will live now we'll get to this if i'll just hurry along here isn't this interesting you see god knew who he'd called now strangely enough my brother and sister i'll put this just as consideration there might well have been a girl down the street that lived just as godly life as mary that's why we never look over and say i'm just as good a christian as you brother jason i'm just as good a christian as you i'm just as good a christian as you you're not measuring yourself against that we're measuring to the word amen so it was god choosing who god wanted to choose right so it's there that he knew who he'd called and i want to say that he know who's called today my brother and sister when god come down and started stirring your heart amen he knew who he called he didn't make a mistake he's not like cupid we've all seen the cartoons you know where the couple's sitting on the park bench and cupid shoots and the arrow flies over and hits some old man on the swing set and he's over there smiling at this young woman no it don't work that way god knows who he has called and has provided the way for them to come into the calling now look my brother and sister this is a side we don't usually preach about mary and i hope this doesn't disrupt any thoughts you have here but look at what happened to mary after that she's just experienced a supernatural event then she goes to the market one day look at mary she's got a baby bump and she's not even married scratch her name off the tea party scratch her name out of the church social we always thought mary i hope this isn't too straight we always thought mary was a good girl but it's obvious it's either joseph or someone else oh my goodness but you know it's the spirit of the day it's just the way things go and mary's have come to it and and so while we thought she was this righteous holy little girl and she acts like a righteous holy little girl we now know better and as the baby bump got bigger mary was marked everywhere she went that's right pretty soon she wasn't even welcome in the market and she wasn't welcome in the square and she certainly wasn't welcome in our church you see there's a price make me cry there was a price that mary had to pay to bear jesus christ in her flesh this world we live in where everyone can behave any old way and say there's a christian something's wrong saints there is a price to be paid a reproach to be born to carry jesus christ in our flesh and look at mary now she's going on and on on and on and on and on now she gets married and we're not going to go into the whole you know story as it is but it's not a bed of roses she's just been visited by an angel saints pardon me for putting this way she's not been slipping out a bedroom window and running the streets she has been living a holy life and because god found favor she found favor in god's eyes my brother and sister she now has a reproach that she never never escaped her whole life she never escaped this reproach a lifelong mark i want to ask you a question would it have been easy to have been married brother timothy sean put it this way quit your whining and crying god called you just stand up and do what he called you to do don't don't be taking this position over one to me i'm a christian and that you know i'm like no come on come on if god marked you stand up and say thank you lord for marking me hallelujah see her hearts cry behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word what did that do it set a direction in her life now that doesn't mean she wasn't in the flesh and i'll just deviate just this little point she did things that confused the mind of people or reinforce the minds of some when she sees him your father and i we've been seeking you with tears people are like i knew it i knew it she said it was some supernatural event she said whoa come on she said she had the holy ghost and god changed her life but it sure sounds like it's just like all the rest of us now hallelujah now let's turn in romans the third chapter i need to hurry right along here today oh too far too fast paul romans 3 1 what advantage then hath the jew or what prophet is there of circumcision now you see some people want to question these things my brother and sister they they want to take it as oh you know i don't know i was just watching a little deal this young man claimed to be a christian he's talking to this guy doing street evangelism and he said now you know what if the language that this was uh interpreted or translated from was not what we thought it was what if it's this over there it would change the meaning of these scriptures to this here instead of this here and so therefore if it changed it to that then we could be wrong what if you get struck by lightning when you walk out of church today what if you know i joked the other day what if you win the lottery well unless it lands on your windshield and sticks to your windshield wiper the odds are pretty small as a christian and even then you probably have to go search for the rightful owner knowing it wasn't really yours he says much every way so it it does for the jew it matters right so the scripture clearly stated as gentiles we were not held into that same category as the jews and he says much every way chiefly because then unto them are committed to the oracles of god so for the word for their day they were obedient and god says but you gentiles i have another covenant for you i have another way i want you to come and then it says now for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect see this is the thing my brother and sister starting with our children we need to get them grounded in the gospel that when they get to school and some child tells your child that my daddy says and my daddy's been to college my daddy says that that's just a book of stories and it doesn't matter and if your child doesn't have a grounding he's going to be looking at that and saying oh okay so i it doesn't mean that i can't lie doesn't mean i can't steal doesn't mean i can't covet because just a book and if that seed ever gets implanted in there you have to root up half the garden to get rid of it that's how deep it gets for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written thou that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged now i want to take this my brother and sister and tie this right back whatever your confession is that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings it doesn't matter what kind of priest said doesn't matter but doctor whatever on the radio says or the guy that has you know 50 000 people come to church on sunday in his football coliseum it doesn't matter what they say what are you saying what are you saying so you look at that now now there's a key in here that i want to expound on for just a moment and that is right there in verse 3. what if you know you don't think about things in certain fashions sometimes people help you to think about them visitor we had said i so enjoyed the service i didn't have to sit in the dark and feel like a mushroom the whole church service but some are attracted to that some are not what if what if it was easy as saying i'm a christian and nothing more was required then most of the world would be saved what if let's go to romans 9. i haven't lost you yet have i we have just a few short more minutes amen not even a reply come on somebody say amen paul [Laughter] both of these are in romans so it's a very easy context to follow for he saith moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy wow you mean i i don't have anything to do with that now we'll have compassion on whom i will have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth come on a lot of people willeth a lot of people willeth my brother and sister nor of him that runeth but of god that showeth mercy oh my i'll tell you what ah we want to go into i got a few examples that fit perfect but for the scriptures saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose if i raise thee up seems strange god would allow a man to rise to the leadership highest leadership of a kingdom for a simple purpose for simple purpose is that but remember with god all things are possible god does what god wants to do purpose i've raised the up that i might show my power in thee that my name might be declared throughout all the earth therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will and whom he will he hardeneth thou will say then unto me what does he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will nay but o man who art thou that replies against god now look at the world we live in saints these scriptures are going to come to pass whether people get excited about it or not we have a whole generation of people rising up that will curse god willingly and with force so it tells you right here what it is who art thou the replest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel into honor and another unto dishonor what if what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endureth with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction so those people who don't even care about god he still has long suffering with him and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy come on saints god wants to make known his riches on you he wants to pour out blessings on you he he wants you oh no this is not the name claim it thing that people get nervous about oh he's preaching prosperity actually i am prosper preaching prosperity yes sir may you be rich in the things of god and if money happens to come your way then you will be led of the holy ghost on what to do with your money and you will be counted as a good steward in the day of judgment but this idea that god wants to just give me millions so i can live some borderline life my brother and sister that's utter nonsense it's a twisting of the scripture because the very nature of a real christian is to do the will of god and the scripture says if a man doesn't work he doesn't eat oh boy that's going to be rough on some people might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he hath before prepared unto glory even us don't you love how he identified who it was we're not talking about somebody out here that nobody even knows of he's talking even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles as he saith also in osea i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said of them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the living god hallelujah what a position to be moved into to be called the children of the living god hallelujah you're not going to know that i'm a christian because of the value of the house i live in or the car i drive or the quality of my clothes but of the nature of christ that is coming forth out of us that will be the testament of whether we are the sons and daughters of god that the scripture is talking about oh so much emphasis has been placed oh look god's blessing me well my brother and sister i can go today and introduce you to a man that's worth millions upon millions of dollars and would curse you and god in one breath and then we got people saying oh see i got proof i got proof god's blessed me i prayed for money well oh let's not go there that just gets complicated look at this now we'll close out right here on these thoughts remember israel the borderlines when god gave them a promise over in the holy land in the land it was good of milk and honey right so this is the promise that god gave them a land of milk and honey moses sent out caleb and joshua and the spies to go over and spy out the land and brought back the vindicated evidence the ten of them said we cannot do it we're unable look at the difficult there we'd be fanatics we got these little bitty things to fight with look what they got we can't do it we're not able to do it hallelujah hope this doesn't shock you mary didn't run home make love to joseph to make sure that come to pass she stood on the angel's words she had declared yea and amen to it and said that word be it unto me in that point right there she received amen i sure hope we've kicked them other ten spies out of the church i sure hope that we have blacklisted them and put them on you know blocked call remove their name off their social media because you see what they got right there is a bunch of people that says we can't do it now this was just a parable this scripture was talking about this is just a storyline this was just something to incite you to be good people no my brother and sister this was a promise of god he declared it and said i'm going to send you or take you to a land flowing with milk and honey my this might be representative of what will happen in the end of time here that we'll have a you know i'm not saying this is so don't misunderstand me but look at this we got 10 or it would be 5 to 1 wouldn't it it'd be five to one for every five negative preachers it'd be a positive one but it didn't matter that there was ten that said we can't do it god said now let's just take the little scale here and we're going to put all of our words and all of our deeds on this side and we're going to put god said on this side and let's see what happens on that scale amen the reason is people have become now i've said this before and i say this again it's very interesting day we live in that people are explaining god who can't even explain themselves well god meant and god this and god that they can't even explain themselves but you see joshua and caleb said we're more than able to do it why because they believe this bible just like mary believed they believed and took it down in the heart and said there's no giant too big there's no land too large there's no circumstance beyond our abilities god said it we're going to take this land we're going to possess it hallelujah a lot of what ifs my brother and sister what was mary's simple question she didn't say why this and that and whatever but she remember now it's okay to ask god a question don't question god too many people question god how are you going to make this happen what are you going to do here god doesn't mind if you as a believer say lord from my heart what do i do and where do i go and how will these things happen in my life look through your bible i should tally it i don't have quite that much time but over and over again through the bible there's been those who ask god a question but never question god mary would be one of those so we've got number one on the list amen how will this happen mary's simple question the holy ghost the holy ghost shall come upon you your question today be brother paul how things troubles in our life in the workplace and barely making the mortgage and bury this and barely that and troubles and questions in how do we let the holy ghost come upon you let god come in and take charge and bring it to pass without you trying to make it happen amen so just as it was to mary the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overcome overshadow thee amen that's what we want my brother and sister to come to the place that we can say be it unto me according to thy word amen will the musicians come i i believe this as i read this we're in bible days again if there was ever another book of acts written would our name be in it and if our name would be in it where would we be in it would be amongst the believer make believer the unbeliever the doubtful the questioners when people say well i just have a real struggle had a gentleman tell me this i have a real struggle having blind faith just believing something i have no evidence of hallelujah well i got a a lot of a lot of things i could say about that anybody want to sit around here my opinion oh not much of a response there but i'll tell you what it is there's a lot of things in this life that we have blind faith to a lot of things in this life [Music] if we would trust i'll give you one that i i find kind of humorous the advent of the automobile the originally determined it went over 18 miles an hour it would leave the earth then they raised that number to the low 30s and then they raised it to 40 and then they absolutely declared when it got somewhere around the 50 something mile an hour a car would just shoot off the face of the earth and yet many of you this morning depending on where you live in the city or out drove here 40 50 60. some of you probably even drove faster than that because you were late but you have blind faith in that you think nothing of getting in your car and you say but it's not blind i believe in gravity but what turns gravity on and off [Music] my god made heaven and earth [Music] gravity is his creation and if god decided well gravity's been around long enough click what would happen but you have faith in that that's a very silly example but i want to keep it simple for you my brothers and sisters today let's have mary's kind of faith let's simply hear the word of god and say be it unto me according to thy word let us just read our bible yes there's things in the bible you know i'm sorry i have all these gentlemen told me type things but i i try to keep in contact with those around me had a gentleman tell me says well i picked up my bible he said i i was encouraged by a relative to read the book of revelation and he said i started reading the book of revelation and he said i i didn't make one drop of sense i just quit how do you understand this [Music] you pray over it lord give me revelation i want to understand your word i don't want to look at it become confused and put it down i want to understand it because this is the book of the revelation of jesus christ and so there approach that and say lord i want to know you look think about it husbands wives maybe young people with these thoughts in mind you can't just walk out on the street and tell a girl i'm marrying you it might work occasionally i know a few people it worked with what do we do we get to know them and as we get to know them look all the ladies on the face of the earth why that one of all those of humanity on the face of the earth why you why you because god put something in you and you said i'm attracted i want to know you more hallelujah i can remember my own romance was a long time ago but i still remember things and [Music] you know of all them young ladies i don't know i'm not going to put their sister jerry on the spot and ask her if she's happy or not about that but that out of all those young ladies me i stop sometimes and say why me i pray sometimes in the midnight hour lord why me just all these people why me but i want to stop that i want to say lord you chose me my wife she chose me oh my those of you that would have known me back then you truly we hear people say oh that's a geek there is a stage beyond geek and you can still be loved [Music] because there's something there that attracts that's what god put in your heart today that attraction lord i want to know you more open your word to me i want to see you in your beauty i want to see you in your righteousness i want to see you in your holiness i want to walk with you i want to talk with you i want to as it were make love to you and i want you to make love to me and speak these things these sweet things to me [Music] because this is what god intended bear the reproach did you ever see mary give up never in fact mary had such a zealousness about her that as people viewed it her own son get what i'm saying pushed her back woman what have i to do with thee boy that should have how dare he [Music] but she knew who he was by revelation every mistake i'm finished now but every mistake in mary's life every mistake get this every mistake letter forward letter some should repeat it some she never but it led her to the place we view it as a mother she stood at calvary [Music] looked up i believe by then because she had received the baptism of the holy ghost herself she knew what the whole plan was she looked up there and thought oh god all that this has brought the reproach and the sufferings and all of the doubts and fears and all of the criticisms has come to this place right here [Music] you still didn't hear mary say i wish this hadn't happened in her heart she says this is what god's plan was thank you lord i'm asking you look god will show his plan to you [Music] hallelujah hope [Music] hope is in the lord let's stand saints [Music] is in the lord forevermore [Music] standing all within the presence of the lord in whom the wisdom of the age is life from whom the reaching of the seeds of sun a living sacrifice the only source of my life is in the lord from this time of evermore my hope is in the lord forevermore [Music] his tender mercies come every rising sun to me the sinner in his broken [Music] and those who trust in him will find their [Music] is in the lord forever blessing the first verse hallelujah i'm standing on within the presence of my lord in whom is a living sacrifice the only source of life my hope is in the lord from this time oh let this be your words is in the lord [Music] forever oh hallelujah hallelujah can you say amen to that amen no other hope we have as christians hallelujah let's sing that sword that chorus sing praises to his name amen let's just take a moment just lift your heart hands if you will just give praise to the king of kings hallelujah

constrained by my thoughts of time and space and you know something been happening to me saints and might think this is silly they say you're the preacher but you know when we bought the church they had that old battered big framed battered up deal of the ten commandments was hanging right there in the foyer it's pretty rough it's got nicks and scratches and somebody you know just as an unfolded piece of parchment you might say that's inside that frame it's heavy there were those that said well we don't want to fall on a child [Music] i took the liberty presumptuous maybe i took it home to the legalist i stole it from the church [Music] i hung it right by our garage door and when i walk in the house i read the ten commandments more in the last few weeks than i probably have in my whole life and it's speaking to me you ever really got down and focused on that maybe we need to hold a service on that come on it says you don't covet your neighbor's ox his house his plow his maidservant his manservant his wife you don't covet this you don't do this you don't speak ill you do and i read this and i'm like oh lord oh god have mercy on me have mercy on me lord [Music] we just read about
