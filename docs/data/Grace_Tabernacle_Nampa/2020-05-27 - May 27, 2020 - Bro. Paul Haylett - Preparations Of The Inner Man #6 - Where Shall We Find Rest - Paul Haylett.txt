you come are you playing guitar oh perfect um amen um pastor was preaching is this on orange okay our pastor was preaching on sunday um but the virgin word warning us that we're the virgin bride and that virgin word is coming inside and growing out on the inside amen and so this song was on my heart so i'll try singing tonight [Music] she was a virgin bride to be and one night as she lay quietly the spirit of the lord overshadowed her and said that you conceive a child whose sin cannot defile and she said lead on to me according to thy word and she kept this age and partnered them deep within her heart she believed in god when he said that something new was going to start [Music] that can certainly be born you and me now we're the urgent bride to be safe through the blood of calvary and in this time of darkness we have come received a vindicated word that we all have heard and i can see it be inborn in you and me because we've kept these stakes and pondered them deep within our hearts we stayed with the world every one time felt desire to depart oh yes the word has been born in mary [Music] them deep within our hearts we believed in god when he said that something new was [Music] and i can see it being born in you and me oh yes the word has been born and it certainly can be born in you and me [Music] oh cause we've kept these saints and palmer them deep within our hearts we stayed with the world every one time their desires to depart oh yes the word has been born in mary and i can see it being born in you and me oh yes the word has been born in mary and it certainly can be born in you and me [Applause] that word has been born and you and i tonight amen as we get ready to turn the service to brother paul let's sing number 1225 as brother chris this song i wanted to sing sunday he's in the house [Music] he's in the house death has to flee now there is life where darkness used to be now there is hope there's no more doubt name praise his name for he's in the house little girl was lying there people all were weeping they just laughed at jesus when he said she's only sleeping as he took her by the hand she began to live again some began to praise the lord some began to say oh he's in the house and has to please [Music] now there there is hope oh church there's no more doubt just praise his name praise his name for he's in the house [Music] we were like that little girl dead in all our sins jesus touched his heart of mine gave me life again [Music] i'm just a house of clay ever since that blessed day there's a light that shines on me for all the world to

there is hope there's no more doubt his name i'll praise his name for he's in my house he's in my house oh he's in now there is no more doubt i'll praise his name i'll praise his name for he's in my house now there is life where darkness used to be now there is hope i have no more doubt i'll praise his name i'll praise his name for he's in my heart can we say amen tonight he's in my house hallelujah he's not just in somebody he's in my house tonight hallelujah oh thank you lord jesus hallelujah where would we be without him oh my brother and sister full of fear full of doubt you know it's interesting we see the world that we live in today and people are still even with all this virus kind of supposedly winding down people still terrified i had a salesman come by and and i i know he just forgot himself for a moment and he come up and he stuck his hand out hey i know who i am i know there's not one thing the devil can do to me without god's permission and i just put my hand out and i shook his hand and then he's like i wasn't supposed to do that that's fine with me hallelujah my god is in control amen now tell you if we were buddhists or we were whatever it else we would need to have that kind of confidence for what we believe to work in our life we'd have to have that confidence to say you know buddha is in control but my brother and sister we've proven buddha is not in control amen jehovah amen our god hallelujah is in control hallelujah well i don't embarrass her but my lovely niece melody is here from alaska and uh going to be here for a few days i thought it was a couple more weeks but we're happy amen that she's come down to visit and uh so that's a very special time amen marvin god bless you good to see you again been a long time amen well let's just turn in our bibles tonight you know uh we we look uh in the word of god sometimes and we just kind of marvel at the way god brings things together uh but you know i felt like brother jason's uh songs this evening uh just fit right to our our thought uh amen uh where are we gonna find peace where are we gonna find all these things my brother and sister i didn't put a question mark on it i didn't brother isaac's like is this a statement or is this a question i had to stop i thought hmm i don't know let's just go ahead and put the question mark on it we'll be all right but you see my brother and sister where shall we find rest we need to as people find rest with the very creation of who we are how god created us we you know even even my former friends that that you know knowledge god is real but they're not religious is how they usually put it but most of them will acknowledge to you if you don't take a rest during the week my dad raised us when i first started farming i wasn't really serving the lord so serious at that time my dad admonished me and he said you know what if you work on sunday you will fix on monday and you know that got proven to me it got proven to the point that it's like lord unless the ox is in the ditch i won't work on sunday because i don't want to become a mechanic on monday amen it's true saints let's turn in our bibles this evening to exodus the fifth chapter and i originally kind of had these scriptures broke up but i think we'll just read uh exodus 5 1 through 18 might just have you be seated after after a portion here amen is god good i tell you what god is so good you know sometimes satan you know what he does he shows up with a short piece of rope you know if you're a cowboy you'd call it a pigeon string and what he's trying to do my brother and sister is to get us to offer to be bound well this didn't go like it was supposed to and this isn't like it was supposed to and this seems to be this way and he wants us to stand there if he can just let me be a little dramatic and we cross our ankles and we cross our hands and we just let him tie us up but what happens my brother and sister when a son or daughter of god has found liberty amen the devil might be trying to tie us up to bind us but we kick we scream we cry out to the lord amen we don't just sit still we don't volunteer for what satan's got to offer amen thank you lord exodus the fifth chapter starting with the first verse and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh now look i don't know about you guys but when i deal with people of high authority usually my adrenaline starts going to them and my brain goes you ever had that happen that's what usually happens when you come face to face with someone who can you know exercise some authority on you and and as it were approve or disapprove you know you just it's a human element the same thing happens when your wife hides behind the bathroom door and jumps out in the dark and yells boo but um amen look at this moses and aaron went in and they told pharaoh look this is a guy who could have just said haul him out and kill them except for god wouldn't allow that amen thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go man bad question i know not the lord neither will i let israel go now my brother and sister i'm going to get ahead of myself but i'm going to say this this sounds like a modern day politician right here amen and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron let the people from their works get ye unto your burdens and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and ye make them rest from their burdens and pharaoh commanded the same day that the task masters of the people in their office are saying he shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves and the tail of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them he shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice unto our god heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace your mercy for the word in the day father that would just keep our hearts on fire keep us tuned into you father lord constantly lord i know this is my prayer each and every day lord if there be something in me lord purge it from me wash it from me lord that i would be right before you for father it is not who i please on this earth lord but pleasing you is our goal father we love you we adore you ask you to come down in our midst this evening for father i offer myself father as a tabernacle a fire lord a testament and lord we have come together as many licks of fire tonight lord to lift this up before you and this world in the name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labor therein and let them not regard vain words and the task masters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh my we have a lot of these thus say us in this day my brother and sister i like thus saith the lord that's the one i want to listen to amen not what this person over here who thinks they have authority or this one over here but what did the lord say i will not give you straw go ye get ye straw from where you can find it ye yet not ought of your work shall be diminished so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt together stubble instead of straw and the task masters hasted them saying fulfill your works your daily task as when there was straw and the officers of the children of israel which pharaoh's task masters had said over them were beaten and demanded wherefore have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today as heretofore then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants there is no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is in thine own people but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore you say let us go and do sacrifices to the lord go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks oh my oh my asking god's blessings upon the word tonight now we look my brother and sister of what was happening with israel at this time there and you know part of this my brother and sister is the lord spoke and said that they would be 400 years in this bondage and yet my brother and sister it is that god did not just go down to deliver them because the time had ticked tick ticked away and 400 years had passed but it was in the prophecy of the time that the people's desire to be set free was rising up something rising up in them and as the word spoken put time to it the relevance of that time i believe was lost upon the people but the burdens upon them were so grievous and the world around them so grievous that it was in that time frame they started to cry out now my brother and sister if god was to have told us that at a certain time in the coming months or years that he was coming for us many people my brother and sister would not change at all they would not they would say well i know that he's going to come in the year you know 2027 i'll just wait till 2027 i'll get my life right but my brother and sister that's not how god works god puts burdens upon us things that start to work upon our lives uh things that have influence upon us and it's in there that he starts you might say the churning within our soul within our spirit that we start to say you know what i've got to have god i need the lord i just can't go another day without this you see god doesn't just give us a time table my brother and sister that we do because now i i'm gonna say that it's not you but people like me got you on that one that we are procrastinators now some of you are not some of your johnny on the spot needs to be done you do that amen that's like the guy who you know the people set their watch because saturday morning at 6 45 they hear his lawnmower start they don't like him but they can use him for a time piece because they're so punctual but most of us would say you know what if he's coming in the year 2027 then you know we wouldn't go out and just visit the world that's not who we are but we wouldn't be on fire but what god's turning something inside of us and i say thank you lord because otherwise we we would sit back and it isn't that we wouldn't get right or we wouldn't make a rapture or something would happen would be all the blessings that we would miss all all the answered prayers all of the things that that god would love that he wants to do for us and when we get sluggish and slaggered about all these things and then we just kind of set back and it's like we miss something really good amen so god knew what was happening but look at the tactics of the enemy this evening amen you know he said i hear moses and aaron tell them you know let my people go now they weren't speaking on their own behalf my brother and sister there is a thus saith the lord in front of this and i'm sure that moses well we know where moses stood on this lord i can't do this i stutter and i and all this and nobody understands me i get too nervous and you know my brother and sister they didn't really want to do that but god chose them to be his mouthpiece god could have come and just absolutely shaken the the uh uh the house of pharaoh he could have shaken the government buildings he his voice could have dominated everything but god chooses men to carry the voice amen and he's done that over and over again and i say my brother and sister what a privilege it is that we could stand today and not as prophets but yet we prophesy you say how do you prophesy brother paul because i get up every day and i say the lord is going to lead me and guide me today amen you say that's not really a prophecy well you know what i'm speaking what i want to see come to pass i could have got up and said you know what i'd just be happy to survive today well maybe then that's all you would do is survive the day but i don't want to be a survivor i want to be an overcomer i want to be one that says risen up got some some authority you might say to bind satan and say you know what satan uh you're not going to run rampant in this household today amen so they're there and and uh you know the people as moses and aaron are speaking to pharaoh the people had a desire now i want to just put this into our our day today if you would allow me that amen they're going to be some special meetings we're going to go out here there's a special place out here in the desert and we're going to have some special meetings got some special speakers we're going to have a good time in the lord now the devil will come and do everything he can do to keep the people from going and being blessed in the presence of god and so he would come my brother and sister in this time of worship and and you know he would say nope not going to happen i'm not going to allow it to do that and i've seen it through the years my brother and sister many many times that you'd have a desire to do something and satan throws his wrench out there now my brother and sister satan might be in control of that wrench but remember what the prophet of god said he said that satan has his push coming but god does some pushing also amen so i say thank you lord that my god's bigger than the devil amen so it's there now pharaoh is speaking now this reminds me and i won't name names tonight if i can help myself but you know we've had some politicians here in the united states that as this pandemic is winding down and different things have happened one of them uh come right on national news and basically said you know we've saved all these lives we've done this we've done that god had nothing to do with it oh my my brother and sister when i i heard this i was i was told by someone watch this clip and i did when i heard that i thought my goodness what a sorry state but you know what there'll be millions of people would have said that's right we did it by science we did it by our education we did it by our will and our work amen my brother and sister none of that consists without god amen so you know we got this same spirit right spirits don't die amen so just as these things are come along and and you say well okay this sure seems like this was this now i i don't mean to be funny for funny sake tonight but i always thought this was interesting that long before these kids were walking around their pants hanging off their bottom they did it in the early 70s hallelujah i know because i was in school and i did it i know that's hard to imagine and you know long before everybody wore a long sleeve shirt and turned up two cuffs it happened there's nothing new under the sun so every spirit has already made its appearance and will make its appearance again and we're living in the age which is the culmination so these spirits are all going to come together my brother and sister and so they just bunched together and now we have variations you might say of the same thing now you look at this and realize that we live in a day now i say this for a little bit of humor uh you know uh i was just in town the other day and i'm sorry but i i was looking at this individual and i thought he looks like a pirate from the caribbean all he needs is a boat now i don't know what the identity is my brother and sister i don't know where and i say this in center sincerity i don't know where the anointing is that would cause normally normal looking people to even have it on their forehead and tattoo within the insides and the backsides of their ears and all of these kind of things i i i'm it's just foreign to me i'm going to say it i see a man with a pearl earring in his ear my first thought is that's cute if his wife was wearing it you see we've lost these things these manly kind of things pharaoh says who is the lord then i should obey his voice to let israel go i know not the lord least he was honest and neither neither will i let israel go so you know we live in a day as i gave this example we live in a day where politicians will have influence on millions of people would stand up and say you know what what we're doing has nothing to do with god and you know my brother and sister the regardless of what they say it's very apparent they know not god and you know there is a certain you might say bondage that in the world we live in now my brother and sister if i could just delve into just a current event for just a moment to kind of touch upon this you see in the world we live in the restrictions that are placed upon humanity upon churches all of these things they're trying to present this with these words of this is the new normal now i'm sorry this was never the normal for the bride of jesus christ amen this world was never our normal amen now it might be a new normal for those who have now been drawn into a tighter scope of bondage while they are they're very dependent many people right now very dependent upon the government they would like to see the government give every one of us two thousand dollars a month for for whatever period of time and all these they would love to see the government raise this and extend that and all this they would love that my brother and sister but what they don't realize is they are actually just volunteering to come into the bondage they are bringing themselves into a deeper position a dependency as it were now my brother and sister i am a very dependent person i would tell you this evening that i am a completely dependent person just as dependent as a newborn baby because i have figured out every time that paul tries to do things on his own without the lord's guidance without his hand i mess it up very very bad so i'm completely dependent upon the leadership of the holy spirit to guide us amen my lord jesus he said i'll be with you even in you to the end so you see what we got to do is stop and come to the place that the turmoil ends that the questions in the doubts and the fears in and we can come into a place that we know that there is a rest there there is a peace there amen so the world today desires to keep every bondage that is in place in this world right now keep it in place he doesn't want that to change in fact he would like to increase that if at all possible amen so you know it's there that we see this playing out that the people are desiring they want to come and and look i'm telling you my brother and sister god if you're a son or daughter of god and i believe we're all sons and daughters tonight amen god's not going to leave you alone you might as well just plan on god whispering in your ear in the middle of the night in the middle of the day you might as well plan on god being on the bus to train the plane on the job whether you're a got a shovel in your hand or whether you're doing something cutting hair whatever it might be you might as well just plan on god being right there talking to you there's no escape amen there's no such thing as a great escape from god and so as you look at this and we'll realize now as it is that they are coming to this place that that there is a real struggle that is taking place here between this but look what they said in verse 3 they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us oh i tell you what my brother and sister that's no small thing to realize that they as a nation forsook god and went into bondage for 400 years and now their testimony is god has met with us and what we want to do after this meeting is we want to fulfill god's will we want to go out here into the the desert into uh for three days and we want to go out there and make a sacrifice as i put it to this modern time we want to have a revival out there we want to hear some good old preaching we want god to come down in our midst and the holy spirit to stir us up again because you see we have been away from god and god in his grace and mercy came down to us and spoke and you know what we're kind of afraid now i have to admit i've been down this road thank the lord as many years ago but i remember there was a stage in my life that i thought oh lord you know i know i got to get right but i don't know lord will i will will i get right i didn't get right that day i wanted to get right i knew i should get right but i didn't but there come a time stirred up within me i won't go into all the details some of them aren't very pretty but there come a day i said i'm getting right today today is the day because i kinda now i hope you understand where i'm coming from and this might be the day that a pestilence or a sword might fall upon me and i was troubled enough in my spirit i knew this is the day i'm gonna get everything straightened out amen hallelujah oh my you know god coming into their midst after 400 years there was a renewing taking place now as we look here in the sermon why are people so tossed about now remember this morning this evening today amen we are talking about where shall we find rest now this isn't going to do us any good my brother and sister if we're over here saying you know brother so-and-so sister so and so just seem to have such a peace and such a comfort and such a confidence there there just seemed to be so anchored my brother sister won't do you any good trying to hang on to their anchor amen every ship every vessel's got its own anchor amen i've never heard of somebody saying look let me pull up real close to you and use your anchor i don't think that'll work amen now look now our faith cannot rest upon nothing now i'm going to have to use something else because brother chris stole my bottle of water amen hallelujah now look the prophet of god is saying our faith cannot rest upon nothing now if i hold this bottle of olive oil out here and i just let go of it it's going to keep going until it finds something to rest upon right so i can't just say now look watch this saints i'm going to just put this bottle right here and i'll come back and get it in a few minutes it's got to have a resting place amen now you know the cool thing about it is if our god wants a bottle of olive oil to stand out in the open it will amen but look at this our faith cannot rest upon nothing a christian has to have his faith has to have a solid resting place can we say amen to that i'm not wanting something that's just the quote goes on and deals with it but i just want to expound it i don't want to put my faith on something that i get up in the morning and it's shifted over here i go tonight and it's shifted over here amen come down to a hard spot in my life and it's decided to take a vacation no amen solid resting place you know that and the only resting place that a christian a true born-again christian can rest his faith or hers is upon the unmovable word of god don't you just love that we know exactly where to place our faith we don't have to go bounce off the bushes and the cactus and everything else trying to figure out where we can anchor ourselves but we have the immovable infallible word of god to come and anchor that on now my brother and sister there'll be lots of ideas there's lots of ideas in the world of where we should be and how we should serve god there's lots of ideas around the message on what we should do and what we shouldn't do and how we should look at the word of god what we want to do is make it our daily prayer because he said this work i began in you amen he's going to finish that's his promise amen i love that it isn't built upon the shifting sands of man's theology now look what would be the shifting sand of men's theology that a man you might have confidence in would believe this today and believe that tomorrow amen what god has as a very steady faithful place we can anchor our soul and whether it's today tomorrow whether you got money in the bank or you don't whether you're healthy or you're not whether their circumstance in your family or not you can rest and say i know this is where i can anchor my soul amen so the shifting sand of a man's theology and doctrines they change too we look over time people will say well we believe this but it doesn't quite fit we'll shift it to this my brother and sister god's got one word it's a true word amen so upon some church affiliation look at that i mean ah we're i think we can be guilty of this i think that we have most of us been guilty of this people are like oh where do you live i live in idaho where do you go to church well they're not too impressed because they've never heard of us but let's shift to a big city with a very dynamic minister pastor and people now i know this for a fact i'm not just surmising this is not gossip i know people that have the mentality if you're not in our church you are not making the rapture my question to them is and i've asked it before can you give me a scripture for that hmm so it's not our church affiliation amen if there's any affiliation it'd be with our lord jesus christ but a true believer his faith rests solidly on shifting as he approaches the word of god amen so what the word said yesterday it will say the same to me today and it will say the same thing tomorrow amen so what god was pleased with yesterday or in ages gone by he will be pleased with today amen that's a lovely thing i think amen because when we saw god come and honor his word in days gone by as we would be privileged to look back through history we'll know those same things will please god so what that brings at least to me i can only speak for me tonight amen i don't want to be presumptuous but what it does to me is gives me a confidence now we brought this out we touched upon it the other day i'll touch on it just for a moment tonight my brother and sister when the word says it would deceive the very elect if it were possible now we don't run around i don't want anybody to misunderstand that we run around boasting that we can't be deceived anybody who thinks that is crazy but there is a confidence that comes knowing that as a son or daughter of god i recognize amen as we preach this last sunday on mary amen what did she declare i am a handmaiden of the lord she didn't say i hope to be a handmaiden of the lord and someday i might be a handmaiden of the lord but she had a confidence down within her soul of where she rested she didn't say well i'll be a handmaiden and tell proven differently or handmaiden until something weird puts me off my track she knew who she was and she declared that and i say god help us that we would just declare what we know satan might be trying to tell us that well you can't be a christian you couldn't be a part of the bride of christ not you not with this not with that my brother and sister the word called us now remember that man come i believe it was a man correct me if i'm wrong but that individual i'll just put it that way come to brother branham and they'd been searching whether they had the holy ghost and they'd went over here and they'd went over there and they'd seen a flyer and went over here and finally they end up there with brother branham and they're theirs pouring out their heart because they have this huge question about whether they have the holy ghost or not and brother branham asked him he says well when did this come upon you this desire this and they declare and they share what time it was and they declare that they ask the lord for the holy ghost and the prophet of god says that's where that come amen that's where you got the holy ghost all of this was just satan trying to bluff the individual to doubt who they were through all of this time and so if you think about that all of the frustration all of the worry all of the stress that it would be and my brother and sister you know that fear paralyzes amen it's a proven effect physical psychological fear will paralyze and that's what satan set out to do what they do put such a question mark am i a daughter of god am i son of god could this be could that be and the fear will come and paralyze and a paralyzed person doesn't move but the holy ghost will come in there and just put a person right where they belong amen but you see what god's wanting to do as we tie this back to this my brothers and sisters the egyptians amen the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron let the people from their works look at those words right there my brother and sister he tells them get you unto your burdens my i'll tell you what when the devil he comes right down he's so clever amen because every one of us got some burdens can we admit that every one of us has got something that just plagues us it's the thing that wakes you up at 2am and you fret over amen now what does the devil want you to do he wants you to go back now pardon me this evening but you want you to go back and lay a hold of your burden and say this is my problem this is something from my family something i've done some condition around me it's mine i guess i should own it oh but what did the word say the word says that we give our burdens to the lord jesus amen cast your burdens unto him amen so look at that the paradox that we have now because now we have to make the decision am i going to cast my burden away or am i going to own it well i'll tell you what my brother and sister you can own it for a long time but all it'll do is beat you to a frazzle amen what we need to do is stop yep there is now there's scripture that says you're going to own your burden now you need to understand what that scripture is really meaning it's telling you my brother and sister that we cannot uh live we cannot be angry we cannot uh uh do all of these kind of things and then think we can turn one day and just walk away from it like it never happened amen we got to deal with it it's got to be put under the blood we got to repent amen and boy the devil can make repenting into a really hard business can't he amen but what we got to do is just come to the place we are so humbled before god that we don't care what anyone thinks about you you know i mean you could be a pastor of a church for an example and you'd be worried about what other people in other places think about you and if you're not careful then you will adjust your life and your preaching and your church and everything about what somebody out there is going to do but the truth of it is like the money man dave ramsey says they could care less what kind of clothes you wear they could care less what kind of car you drive what kind of house you live in they could care less now my brother and sister we got one person to please and that's our lord jesus amen so everybody wants you to please them amen everybody wants somebody to please them but i tell you there's only one we're going to worry about pleasing and that's our lord jesus amen we do our work we take care of our things and we'll be fine amen so he tells them right here let your people from their works with question mark get you into your burdens see we're not going to give you a rest from the cares of life now look at this we're the bride of jesus christ if you got a mortgage you still got to make the payment you got a car you got to put gas and oil and tires and whatever you understand where i'm going i don't need to elaborate see so there's certain burdens that we we are under constantly now if we could live debt-free you know and you know whatever there's still you know the bills you still got to pay the bills you still got to pay them on time you still got to do all these things so we're living here uh no release from the cares of life amen that's why you know when people come around and started preaching that we were in the millennium some people got all excited we're in the millennium already it's all done it's all finished we don't do this i i said i won't go into details about it but i set one time in a restaurant with a man uh that that believe that and he was an old friend from years gone by and and he believed that and we're sitting in the restaurant and i thank the lord uh that this and i'll just be blunt with you tonight okay i'm not gonna pull any punches this this waitress uh was was quite quite beautiful young woman is quite beautiful and not dressed very good and i just one glimpse of it and i was like oh my but you know god was gracious because she always come from my right shoulder and put food and whatever on the table from right here and i didn't have to bother looking at it but i'm not speaking down on this man but but it was there and and i'm just saying that she was quite beautiful i mean like extraordinary beautiful i'm gonna drive that home to you did i say that she's really beautiful later we're sitting at his kitchen table and we're discussing these things and he's telling me we're already in the millennium and i said then why i wasn't very nice there's people that don't think i'm very nice did you guys know that there's some people don't think i'm very nice but i'm going to stand for this word even if it costs me my life i'm not going to put up with the nonsense i'm not going to put up with that we got this and we got that right i want to stand with the word god correct me if i'm wrong amen but i trust he'll correct me amen just listening well i won't go into that anyway so it was there i just made that simple statement it caught him off guard i said if we're in the millennium there'll be no longer any attraction that's right but you see what happened is we get caught up in the cares of life and we struggle with something now if somebody offers you a shortcut i'll take it back my brother and sister when our young people what is that called i for just had a brain wave the journey the play that we played out pilgrim's progress amen right wasn't there a section in there about a shortcut amen so they get offered the shortcut right now some said nope we were told to stay on this trail and we're staying on this trail but some said you mean i could save up i bypass all the struggle i bypass all of this i bypass whatever i i'm i don't want to bypass the rapture somebody says oh just put you right over here in the millennium no i've been laboring as a son or daughter of god we've been laboring we've been looking i want to be a part of that meeting in the air i want to be a part of coming of my lord jesus amen i want to be a part of the great celebration that it will be that the overcomer the real christian will have in that day i don't want a shortcut amen let me experience all the gods because he's going to take me through it i'm going to finish this race i'm not going to run right down to the end amen and just quit my brother and sister i sometimes feel like it maybe sometimes you feel like it but god's not gonna let us because the seed is in you and somebody's gonna be there and look you in the face and say it's in you it's in you keep pressing keep pressing we can do it hallelujah amen so no release from the cares of life did you know that the old phrase keep your nose to the grindstone there's something very profound about that i read a deal one time that broke that down and i wished i still had it as a lot of things i didn't keep you know when people come and they look in my office they're like brother paul you ought to clean some of this stuff out of here but in all of that that looks like junk to you is a lot of papers with a lot of sayings and a lot of things written down amen my brother jason i just throwed you under the bus how'd it feel amen brother jason's always like brother paul you need to do something serious here but you know what my brother and sister this man was writing he says you know there's more to it about than just sticking your nose to the grindstone everybody's like i understand that stick my nose of grindstone but he said when you stick your nose to the grindstone you're not looking up or away you're looking down into your present circumstance and it's always painful amen i don't know how many of you ever been around a real big grindstone you know peddle them and and you can sharpen things with it when that things are spinning and you got something like a hoe or something you're grinding an edge on that and your finger ever slips that grindstone don't care whether it's finger or metal amen it'll just chew it up so satan's trying to get us to get our head down and forget who we are could lose our vision of what we were called for and just get caught up in this is my present situation this is what's going on in my life and it's painful but let's look up my brother and sister we were called to stick our nose to the ground amen so here again i want to just do this now if you listen to the king of egypt he's going to tell you own your burden and you need to then take your burden back but my brother and sister reiterating back to you tonight there's a real focus of really what i'm speaking tonight amen we've been given a commandment of god to take our burden and cast it unto jesus amen we were not called we are not capable of day by day week by week year by year amen of carrying our burdens i've often joked with you about that you know imagine if you was in the airport you saw somebody coming towards you and they had a suitcase with about 25 other suitcases attached to it and dragging it through the airport now my brother and sister you'd say that's something weird here but that's what's happened to many of us we got so many burdens so many cares amen i'm guilty i'll just lift my hand for you tonight amen that we just drag them all along with you and the joy of our salvation has escaped us it has become fleeting to us we have momentary times that we feel liberty to worship and do that and then we're right back into the grindstone but we are not called to do that we were called to cast those burdens unto the lord and get up now does it make history go away if you went and buried your credit card you're not going to wake up in the morning and mysteriously it's empty or paid off but god will give you the strength to correct your life and get it back in order amen he'll give you now i used a credit card but let's go back to the more human element base of the human elements and go in there whatever the situation might be that we can then have the strength to press through that battle because we already have deliverance amen as a one brother preached many times years ago i remember the brother used to speak it often he says you go sow your wild oats and then run and pray for crop failure god might do that for you once in a while but he ain't gonna do it all the time amen plant the kind of seed you want to come up amen yep you know he says now the people of the land are many and you make them to rest from their burdens wow what a terrible thing you know i often wondered about that in in all different countries and different economies and different things even different churches why that they want the people to be under a burden all the time why wouldn't you want your people a church to be in liberty why wouldn't you want a church to be happy and and the people to be just like you know it's wednesday night i'm tired praise the lord i'm going to church i don't care how this old body feels i'll bring this body in subjection but you know sometimes now i'm not trying to poke anybody but sometimes we get in this realm that it's like i gotta work and i if i go to church on wednesday night i'll be too tired on thursday morning but i know the god of strength amen instead i set a question on whether you can find the strength why don't we stand up with a little authority and say lord i'm going to church on wednesday night brother paul is going to preach too long we just know it that's brother paul we're not going to get home till way past my bedtime but i'm going to get up in the morning and i'm going to have more energy than i had on tuesday morning and more energy than i had on any other morning because i've asked the lord and god answers prayer hallelujah oh what a mental concept but it's not mental it's the word of god amen so as we'll take that now look we come to a place you say well i just seem to struggle in certain things just ask god to come give me strength lord give me strength lord amen so as pharaoh says behold the people of the land now are many and you make them to rest from their burdens he's seeing that they need to this is just a foretaste my brother and sister of laodicea we just got to get these people to where mom's out of the house dad's out of the house kids are being raised by cable tv or a babysitter or some other kind of thing and you know we should have bought this house but we bought this house it was twice as big and now we're under this mortgage but you know we love our house more than we love anything else so we're gonna have to keep just doing this honey get a better job honey i'll get another job i'll deliver pizzas at night do we have children uh children i'm your dad look that's normal in america very normal in america now what is he doing don't give them no rest from their burden god give us wisdom my brother and sister i want to see i'll just be blunt tonight that'd be okay i want to see every one of you living in a nice house driving a nice car wearing nice clothes with money in the bank but i wish that you would be poor if it brings you from the house of god was that plain enough okay you see the reason that satan wants to put us into this burden my brother and sister is because he fears a multitude that is free from bondage let me say that again satan fears a multitude that is free from bondage now look grace here we are wednesday night as brother jason always says this is family night this is this is well i won't go in there offend somebody amen this is family night now my brother and sister if satan can keep us in bondage then wednesday night will be just another service we had at church but what if we are a people oh can someone say hallelujah amen what if we are a people with no bondage no bondage amen we'd be praying for for our our uh for our family you know for an aunt oh lord you need to come on the scene god hears it we pray for sister a conscious mama sister vemma lord lord we need you to come on the scene amen we've saw i'll interject this we've saw god move upon sister vimy now we won't fully understand where she sits in the economy of god it's not my problem i've seen her cry i've seen her cry out to god i've seen her praise the lord amen so i know that she is there and responding to it and i don't care some people can put a box around a picture frame around it she's a daughter of god we'll lift her up before god and we will expect god to come on the scene and we have to temper that though that lord thy will be done amen we don't ever want to push our will on god well you know i got a i got a son not serving the lord down in phoenix you all know that amen if it was me in the human element the angel of the lord would come rip his front door off tonight come on i say that in a humorous fashion but if it was left up to paul the angel of the lord would rip his front door off tonight and that family would turn back to serving god but you see sometimes it's not all about them sometimes it's god dealing with you and me sometimes god's gonna see are you gonna be faithful to lift them up in prayer are you going to be faithful to stand at your post of duty will you stand and have rest when the devil says you should be agitated when the devil said you should be nervous when the devil says you should be in doubt or fear can you stop and say i just rest in the precious word of my lord jesus i just rest upon the promises of god i'm not gonna get all shook up and all fuzzed up because i see this and i think this is going to happen my brother and sister they were given to god god claimed god gave them in the very beginning amen and we'll just leave it to god hallelujah and that might include your job your house your whatever you want to put right on that same list amen because if we are caught up my brother and sister and we have no rest and our burden then controls us then my brother and sister will look just like the rest of this world out here amen we'll look like the rats on the treadmill but i tell you he fears as i said i'm sorry to say it again but i just love this statement satan fears a multitude that is free from bondage because what happens he fears when you get out from underneath that yoke that he'll never can i say that never get you back underneath that yoke again oh my brother and sister that's something else right there it ain't nothing to be ashamed of that we got underneath the yoke come on are you with me nothing to be ashamed of that we were underneath the yoke but hallelujah when you get out from underneath that yoke there is no way the devil is ever going to drag you back because i have found the rest that i longed for i found the rest that i needed i found the rest that brought life to me and satan i'll tell you just like that man said i'll just chew on him or whatever and if i tell my teeth are gone and then i'll gum him to death hallelujah praise the lord you know they wanted the same amount of bricks they wanted to take something away from them see nothing's changed look at the world it is my brother and sister america i'll just put in natural terms more people than ever are sliding down the scale from middle class to lower class they readjusted the economy for poverty because they realized that whole families can't live on fifteen or sixteen thousand a year but more families are moving in that direction now that's just natural right but remember there's always a type to the spiritual you see what they're saying is well it's the economy it's the virus it's this we had to shut your church down some people say somebody just drove around our church anyway uh i see taillights um what was i saying we gotta shut your church down to control the virus really now some people say that was persecution on the church that's the start of it no my brother and sister it's the devil just trying to get you back in bondage the persecution hasn't started this is not the tribulation this is satan exercising his ability to get as many people as he can within his grip to get them in bondage because you see just oh i hope you follow this just see he's got to get them in the right atmosphere physically and mentally the right atmosphere for a tribulation but at the same time praise the lord don't you love this that god's always put a balance and at the same time satan's creating this atmosphere to get those people in a position for a tribulation there's a people over here getting in an atmosphere that their roots are being sawed off and sometimes we complain and whine and cry about our roots being sought off but god said look i'm not going to let you become bondage to this earth to laodicea to this world i won't let you i am your redeemer i'm your savior i'm your creator i'm your sacrifice i'm everything and i won't let you be bondage to this world i'm going to set you free from it oh hallelujah thank you lord and then when we finally catch that revelation what does it bring us rest amen when we stop and say you know what i see the hand of the lord in this amen i see god in it but look at this nothing's changed they'll say it's the economy oh it's the day that we live in it's just our morals it's a society it's just a new generation yes it's this yes it's that no my brother and sister it's not it's the devil amen it ain't just the economy it ain't just this it ain't just that it's the devil amen so look it's there the devil would come and he would give us now you say this sounds like this would apply to the preacher and it does but every one of you is a minister in your own home amen give us no time to study give us no time to worship now look my brother and sister i hope i don't skin anybody tonight i don't mean it but if you know a lot of times when people don't worship in church it's because they don't worship at home that's exactly right come on i'm just going to tell you the truth tonight okay and the reason we don't or can't worship in church is because we are not worshiping at home we're not worshiping in the car we're not worshiping in the kitchen the living room the garage the backyard whatever we're not doing that see satan's got some bondage on there and then we come to church and try to break through to enter into that no my brother and sister you'll break through and enter into that when you start worshiping in your private time amen when you start worshiping when no one's around you'll find you'll have liberty to worship when you're in church hallelujah amen and it won't be showing off it won't be i'm trying to get people to see me lift my hands and cry out to the lord it will be the natural response of the cycle of your life coming to pass that you won't be able to help yourself amen no time to read our bible now i won't go into this because it just seems like you get rough when you go into some of these things but my brother and sister i'll tell you well maybe i'll just go there kind of maybe i'll just kind of go kind of go there sort of half-heartedly go there do you know you can come home after a long day and you just get on social media and because you just kind of like to see what's going on the rest of the world and it goes from six to eight because somehow or another that thing on the ipad or whatever speeds up the clock now i'm not against that i i have made some pretty harsh statements about that kind of stuff but people have to do what they're going to do right i mean we're not nazis we're not going to go from house to house knock the door down see what you're doing but i'm telling you see satan will steal your time he'll wind that clock up faster than you ever thought and it'll be one moment it's there and next it's bedtime see he'll steal our time to read our bible but did you know i i have done this research me a great researcher when i don't read my bible all i see is what is wrong when i read my bible i see what is right even if it's wrong i recognize this must have come to pass amen we're not fighting against flesh and blood we're fighting against principalities and powers of darkness in what low places no high places in those in authority amen see it's what satan's trying to do but we don't come to a place that we read our bible then it it affects our life my brother and sister no time to pray now look there's no excuse there some of us are really busy okay i'm not i'm not digging on on on your lifestyle i'll let you deal with god on that some of us are really busy but the scripture says we can pray without ceasing amen now that i say this jokingly i remember brother saying this one time called everybody off guard said i just don't recommend you do that on the freeway well you know pray with your eyes closed but we can pray without ceasing things we can devote that time all day long lord i need you to speak to me lord i'm looking for this now look more they're wanting to lay upon it and he says let them not regard vain words in verse 9. you see what he was doing is trying to tell them that that these words have no real value they're idle they're worthless uh they're uh marked by futility ineffectiveness unsuccessful but my brother and sister what satan sees as vain words god sees a spoken word as prophecy when the word says this work that i have begun in you amen that was me i will finish i look at that it's done it's done i mean i might still have some problems in my life i might get a little bent out of shape here and whatever else but i look at that this work he began and me is finished praise the lord hallelujah i want to tie this together i i spoke last wednesday i just kind of from memory tried to give a little blip of a a quote talking about portions amen we'll tie that in on another wednesday my brother and sister you see god didn't just take us and take us out here as some old sinner and we say well god's working on me and i'm still working on this part and that part my brother and sister god does a complete deliverance amen we don't have to go for years settled well you know one of these days i'll be free of this god gives us liberty he sets us free when he washes a son or daughter of god he gets behind the ears behind the elbows whatever else he doesn't miss a single thing amen and he's kind of like my old grandma she'll say well it hurts today but it'll look better tomorrow i'm scrubbing your elbows amen now see the spoken word my brother and sister they're never vain words do you realize i've shared this story here in the church now my brother and sister there's a man i read a story about lives in the midwest i believe was oklahoma and the man doesn't go to church he believes in god but he just never goes to church and does whatever but somebody figured out that there's three churches in his small town that he gave tithe to all three of those churches somebody brings that up to him one day and says hey what is this that you do and the man says well here's the thing i was raised godly grandmother she belonged to this church over here and i seen how god stretched the economy of their household and she gave tithe even when they were poor and he said i grew up understanding that principle that you give to god god will give back to you and they said but you give money to all three churches he said that's right i don't belong to any one of the three but i figure if i give 10 to each one god will be good to me and there he was a multi-multi-millionaire and he attributed it entirely he didn't live a bad life he was talking about no i follow the premise of the bible i'm just not one of these guys that goes to a church but he he says my success is based on that right there because it's right here in the word took himself right back to the word he didn't take himself back to all of it but he took him back back to that portion and said you know what hey i want my barns to be full then i will give to god amen see satan sees it as vain's work amen but god sees it as prophetic word amen going to come to pass now look let me just jump ahead here a little further here the devil sure hates my brother and sister verse 17 he says you're idle you're idle therefore say let us go and do sacrifice to the lord see how the world looks differently we need time to serve god we need time saints can i say that again we need time to serve god you can't just throw a snippet of god in here and a snippet of god in there we need time to serve god god designed it that way from the very beginning the devil would say you're just a bunch of idol people and so therefore you're saying let's go and do sacrifice to the lord no the devil didn't figure that one out my brother and sister he figured out that a son or daughter of god will make time a son or daughter of god will make it so he can be in the house of god he'll make it so he can serve god hallelujah amen oh she sure hates it you know when you take time to pray he sure hates it when you take time to read your bible he sure hates it when you take time to ponder stop meditate on the word of god and he hates it my brother and sister when we don't have time to fellowship that's right sometimes we just need to rub shoulders with another son or daughter of god we need to have someone and find ourselves you know this is so funny at a pastor we're going to close here in just a second i had a pastor that called me here a while back and he's a little discouraged and he said brother paul how do you feel about this and we started talking and and you know i started speaking to him and and uh uh he goes man i've never thought about it that way brother paul thank you so much and god was good you know the week didn't pass out i had to apply the very words i spoke to him by inspiration right back to my own life and i had to stop and say now i either have to call him up and apologize for being a hypocrite or i've got to follow this and you know it was way easier just to follow it than it was to make a phone call and say i'm a hypocrite come on saints it's good we need that fellowship we weren't made to live alone now in the interval amen look at this i want to just close with this if you guys would be gracious enough give me that time amen amen i want this thing to appear there i think vika might need some help hallelujah i want you to read this awesome awesome a few nights ago i was called to an emergency call of a young lady dying at the clark county memorial hospital she'd had been a member up at a time the tabernacle where i used to pastor years ago and i went into this young lady to talk to her and she was under oxygen i said they tell me you used to come to the tabernacle she said yes brother branham i did i said do you realize you're dying she said i do brother branham said she was a mother of one child if she's 19 20 years old had a four-month baby adults can read between the lines understand she'd taken uremic poisoning and also many things there wasn't one thing that doctors could do but lay her back and wait for death that's all nothing could be done for her in the medical science and she was going out to meet god just a child and i said sister do you remember on the cradle roll you were baptized in the fellowship on the cradle roll i said what was the matter she said brother branham i tell you how many people are right here yes sir i still love the lord jesus but i find it so hard to serve him amen oh my god now that is what i find around most christian lives most i hate to say it that way but it's true most people can profess christianity they seem to have such a hard struggling time to hold on i believe oh get this now saints come on saints let's get this it wasn't the individual this is a prophet of god amen i believe we are message church aren't we believe god give him inspiration to speak these things it isn't this individual over here oh sometimes we're just like this person ain't got it right and it's too bad that's a shame over there but look what the prophet of god says i believe it's because of lack of correct teaching of the bible where does that come back that comes back right here amen might have come back to mama and daddy not taking time to to have an altar in their home and teach their child but still it comes back right here to a degree hallelujah lack of good teaching correct teaching of the bible there's no such thing as holding on he done the holding on hallelujah i don't care what age you are you say i've been serving the lord faithfully for 50 years you're not the one doing the holding on he's doing the holding on hallelujah amen the whole christian principle is based upon rest come unto me all ye that labor in heavy laden i will give you rest we won't find it saints he'll be there giving it to us hallelujah you don't have to worry and struggle you're just resting that's all given rest you enter in to peace look at the connection this is deeper my brother and sister he didn't put it in big bold letters he didn't shout it to the heavens but given rest you enter into peace no wonder satan's got us running here and worrying about this and running there and worrying about this and going and going and going and going what's happening with the church what's happening to this what's happening there my brother and sister it's time for us to stop and say lord you are in control amen i'm resting on the promise of your word lord you are in control amen and then all of a sudden you start to have some peace about your circumstance that's the whole thing's finished oh give and rest you enter into peace that the whole thing's finished them who he has called he has justified those he has justified he has already glorified brother brown then says scripture quoting hallelujah can i have just another moment or two amen i'm sorry i'm turning into a long-winded preacher or maybe i always was and it's just coming out now or sometime in the past why are people so tossed about that would be an interesting question wouldn't it why are people that's it so tossed about amen the christian faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a christian is not tossed about a christian doesn't run from place to place a christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at calvary that's right oh sickness may come in disappointments but the christian is at rest knowing this that god is able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is and how it looks there is neither sickness sorrow death there is neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of god that's in jesus christ we're at rest just let the old ship toss any way she wants to the anchor holds hallelujah hey look i don't have to get up do i make mistakes look i i like being out there on the farm all by myself because you guys don't get to see my mistakes you don't see me kicking the tire on the tractor and saying stupid tire why'd it go flat okay it's not that bad my brother and sister most of us don't want our mistakes advertised we make them get over it live with it we're human but i've got a god that began to work amen and he said i have already he didn't say i will finish this work he said it is already finished hallelujah that ought to bring some rest to us all we got to do amen is just say lord thank you i'm standing right here lord i'm going to rest on your word hallelujah because you see no matter how hard it blows if the anchor holds you got no worries had a friend today sister emmy would you come i had a friend today we were just

going back and forth and they were trying to fish for for steelhead the boat kept going back and forth and the guy who owned the boat said i'm going to drop an anchor off the stern to keep the boat from going back and forth my friend he's quite an experienced man he said you bill you don't want to do that and bill said no i'm i'm tired of this boat going back and forth we'll never catch a fish this way and he said don't do that bill but it's your boat bill he said i made sure my life jacket was all snugged up nice and tight and he said it wasn't 30 minutes that the guy that was in the front of the boat there's four of them on the boat the guy in the front of the boat goes the anchors let go and that guy's trying to climb up to the nose of the boat to get the anchor to start pulling it in just so they could throw it out again and he said there was another guy in the middle of the boat said well as soon as i get this lure in and he said i climbed right over the top of him and he said i grabbed that anchor in the back and he said it was burning my hands but i got it pulled loose but he said the water was already running in the boat and he said we come that close he said the waves were so big on the river he said we come that close to dying out there his friend all of that took place he's still reeling in his lure i can't lose this lure my brother and sister the anchor holds
