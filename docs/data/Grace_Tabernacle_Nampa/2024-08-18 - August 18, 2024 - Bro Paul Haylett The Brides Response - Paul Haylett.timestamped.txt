[20:45] to that
[20:46] land I was trust has been such a a thing
[20:51] for me lately and I was thinking the

[20:56] technology when you set up a trust
[20:58] relation relationship between two
[21:00] servers or
[21:04] whatever it doesn't matter anymore come
[21:07] what may once that relationship is
[21:13] set anything that goes between those two
[21:15] servers is
[21:18] trusted so you know it doesn't matter
[21:23] if what the other server understands
[21:26] what it sees what it feels
[21:29] it doesn't matter I I hope you
[21:31] understand what I'm trying to say but
[21:32] once that trust relationship is set come
[21:35] what may it does not matter what
[21:37] information has passed between there it
[21:39] trusts it
[21:40] 100% it says this is validated this is
[21:43] certified do you trust him this morning

[44:34] clothed and that shame of thy nakedness
[44:38] do not appear anoint mine eyes with isav
[44:41] that thou mayest see my as many as I
[44:46] love I rebuke and chasen be zealous
[44:48] therefore and repent behold I stand at
[44:51] the door and knock and if any man hear
[44:53] my voice and open the door I will come
[44:57] in to him and will Su with him and he
[45:00] with me to him that overcometh will I
[45:03] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[45:06] as I also overcame and and sat down with
[45:09] my father in his throne he that hath an
[45:13] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[45:16] unto the churches Heavenly Father we
[45:19] have come today Lord some not with us we
[45:22] just ask father that your Holy Spirit
[45:24] would be with them today Lord touch each
[45:27] and every life Lord we ask you let the
[45:29] word just uh speak deep in our spirit
[45:32] father deep in our hearts that father
[45:35] today we would recognize how privileged
[45:38] we are and what a blessing it is father
[45:41] to be amongst your chosen father we
[45:44] don't want to take that lightly we don't
[45:46] want to make it common father we want to
[45:49] lift it up each and every day father as
[45:52] one of the great blessings that you have
[45:54] poured out upon us bless this time
[45:56] together bless the Saints their needs
[45:58] their circumstance their family father
[46:01] most of all the opening of the word to
[46:03] them in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[46:06] you may be seated amen as we're looking
[46:09] at this I I want to uh kind of put this
[46:13] in the sense that uh touching every
[46:17] Church age Revelation 2 and three uh I I
[46:21] chose to go ahead and just take my
[46:24] thought or the foundation of my thought
[46:26] from Revelations 3 it is our age it is
[46:30] the time that we are living in and it
[46:32] would be the one that we could relate
[46:34] the closest to as we are literally
[46:37] living these scriptures right here and
[46:41] um as we look at this we see that this
[46:43] pattern is through all of the church
[46:45] ages all seven Church ages U the word
[46:49] identifies the age and then it
[46:52] identifies the condition of the age in
[46:55] other words we can look right here in
[46:57] Revelations 2 and recognize the
[47:00] spiritual atmosphere of every Church age
[47:03] from just what's right here in
[47:05] Revelation so it's there that we don't
[47:08] have to let it be a mystery to us we we
[47:11] have the ability to look back and
[47:15] because of our current experience in
[47:17] this day we can look back and say okay
[47:19] when it says this and it says the Deeds
[47:23] of the nicians and all of this we we see
[47:26] it very very readily it's very open to
[47:29] us and so he identifies the age he
[47:31] identifies the condition of the age and
[47:34] the word always identifies the people of
[47:37] the age and and this uh it'll be quite
[47:40] far down in the sermon here that will
[47:42] kind of come in this identification of
[47:45] the people just a little snippet of what
[47:47] the prophet said I think fits it
[47:49] perfectly it also identifies the
[47:51] Judgment of the age and uh as we'll look
[47:54] down through Revelations 2 and three
[47:57] we'll we'll see that every Church age
[47:59] has a a judgment that's been promised to
[48:02] them but it also has a reward that has
[48:05] been promised to them and so you all
[48:08] depends on what part of it you want to
[48:10] read my brother and sister I think that
[48:13] we don't ignore what the judgment is but
[48:16] we are looking at what the reward is
[48:18] amen just as the prophet of God said you
[48:20] know one man walks out of church and
[48:23] says he called me a buzzard he's looking
[48:25] at judgment another man walks out of
[48:27] church and says you know what he called
[48:29] me a saint uh he called me redeemed he
[48:32] called me the bride and and it's all how
[48:34] you look at the word and where you want
[48:36] to identify with that and so as we we uh
[48:41] identify the reward of the age uh it's
[48:44] very clear in every Church age amen then
[48:47] he gives a strong uh admonition at the
[48:51] end to hear what the spirit saith unto
[48:55] the church and so I put it in these
[48:57] words to hear what the spirit is saying
[49:00] in that age amen what is the word for
[49:03] the day amen and so we'll look at this
[49:07] and and uh we we'll follow this very
[49:09] carefully uh it starts off in the church
[49:12] ages there of Paul and and he is then
[49:15] the messenger to Ephesus and irus is
[49:19] there to Samia and Martin is to pergamus
[49:23] and Columbia to thyrus Luther to Sardis
[49:26] Wesley to to Philadelphia brother
[49:28] brandham to Le oysa and as we'll look at
[49:31] that we'll see very clearly how that
[49:34] those men were so suited for the the age
[49:37] that God placed them in God didn't just
[49:39] randomly grab someone and put it there
[49:42] we'll look at uh these each one of these
[49:45] men had something to offer that actually
[49:48] set them apart it wasn't just that they
[49:50] were God's messenger but even in the
[49:53] very natural personality that they had
[49:56] what They carried it set them apart from
[49:59] those around them their contemporaries
[50:01] you might say and and Paul you know uh
[50:04] he he had some disagreements with the
[50:07] brothers right and and uh you know the
[50:09] bin uh those who follow that teaching
[50:11] you know they're proud of the fact that
[50:13] the bines called Paul and and questioned
[50:16] him so strongly they're proud of that
[50:19] but you see my brother and sister if
[50:20] Paul needed set in order for that day it
[50:23] was God that did it it was not some kind
[50:25] of counsel or movement or sect or
[50:28] whatever it was God who set it in order
[50:32] and so we look down in every one of
[50:34] these ages and and we'll see how that
[50:36] irus he come and brother brandham says
[50:39] you know irius actually kind of was a
[50:41] little bit of a compromiser that there
[50:44] was certain things that he backed up on
[50:46] do you think that was because irius
[50:48] wasn't called to the job you think that
[50:50] possibly Iranians didn't have courage
[50:52] enough or God knew exactly what he was
[50:55] doing to leave that door open for those
[50:58] spirits to express themselves and then
[51:00] we see how that Martin one of the
[51:02] greatest examples of him is to take his
[51:05] own sword and cut his own cloak and to
[51:08] share that that was the very nature that
[51:11] that he had it was the very uh uh
[51:13] dispensation that God was pouring out
[51:16] for a man that actually would have
[51:18] compassion upon those around him but he
[51:20] was packing a sword amen so you don't
[51:22] want to think about him just being some
[51:24] kind of well you know I just Mr Nice Guy
[51:27] no my brother and sister I believe that
[51:29] he knew how to use that sword in the
[51:31] appropriate time and place he did use
[51:33] that sword and pergamus being a very
[51:36] unique age uh uh very much a a conflict
[51:39] a time of conflict and you know then we
[51:42] see Columba coming in fyra and and how
[51:46] he he really was a very interesting man
[51:48] if you go back and just refresh your
[51:50] your history on him a very interesting
[51:53] man uh very smart uh very you might
[51:56] intellectual man to come and still it
[52:00] shows that we can be very intelligent uh
[52:03] uh and uh still God deal with us God
[52:06] knowing exactly what it is to come to us
[52:09] and thyra being I I in my own mind kind
[52:13] of put it as a transitional time we see
[52:16] thyra that age as being a time that
[52:19] there's a shifting and we'll touch on
[52:21] these things in just a second but it
[52:23] still fell under that Ox anointing there
[52:26] was still still a lot of persecution a
[52:28] lot of uh uh trouble in the land for the
[52:31] Believers and in the foot uh the tail I
[52:34] mean of that comes Luther who has a
[52:37] great Revelation that uh the just shall
[52:40] live by faith but we know that the just
[52:43] need just more than
[52:46] Faith amen you can have a natural Faith
[52:49] right that's you going out in the
[52:51] morning putting the key in the ignition
[52:53] and turning it we need more than that so
[52:56] in that time as Luther said you know the
[52:58] just shall live by faith uh he he was
[53:02] actually just putting a key brother Bram
[53:04] puts it this way he was just putting a
[53:06] key in and unlocking something greater
[53:10] to come you see up to that point my
[53:12] brother and sister what had been Faith
[53:15] with with the Apostle Paul and uh those
[53:18] had slowly faded away they left their
[53:21] first love and they were cooling down
[53:23] and yet God comes along now and says you
[53:26] know what I'm going to put the key back
[53:28] in the lock and we're going to unlock
[53:30] this so that in future Generations my
[53:33] word can start to be completely uh
[53:36] revealed or unfolded to the people and
[53:39] so as Luther is there in Sardis uh a
[53:43] very you know outwardly uh Brave man but
[53:46] you know um I mean we kind of frown on
[53:50] drinking
[53:51] beer so there was some things you could
[53:54] find fault with him by modern standards
[53:58] but for that day he was on The Cutting
[54:01] Edge of
[54:02] Revelation and so we have to realize
[54:05] that in every age uh God is using that
[54:08] then Wesley comes along the Philadelphia
[54:11] age uh it it's a time of a great
[54:13] explosion of the word and how that it
[54:16] was just being opened up and the
[54:18] printing of the Bible and and uh the
[54:20] Zeal that uh brought the word or spread
[54:23] the word through the Nations and and
[54:25] amongst the people
[54:27] and so Philadelphia a great time and
[54:29] it's very easy if you'll sit and study
[54:32] it's very easy to see why it was hard
[54:35] for people to to shed the atmosphere of
[54:39] the Philadelphian anointing it was a
[54:41] great time of great expectation of word
[54:45] and you might say intellectual in a good
[54:47] sense intellectual approach to the word
[54:50] and and it had quite quite an influence
[54:52] the word being brought forth many things
[54:54] starting to be revealed
[54:56] and then we come out of that into the
[54:59] leodan church age and I just want to put
[55:02] this out to you not one of these
[55:06] Messengers was readily accepted in his
[55:11] day there was always a fault to be found
[55:16] as the word moved forward every age that
[55:21] preceded it looked at the new word
[55:24] coming forth revelation coming forth and
[55:28] found criticism with
[55:30] it they said now what do you mean just
[55:33] shall live by faith you go to church you
[55:36] do this you do that you pack your Rosary
[55:39] you do your indulgences you do all this
[55:41] what do you mean the just shall live by
[55:43] faith and they criticize that and it's
[55:45] been every age and sometimes even
[55:48] through history we'll see how that even
[55:51] amongst the The Messengers and the
[55:53] people ministers you might say of the
[55:55] day you you know Peter didn't always
[55:57] agree with Paul they had kind of a kind
[56:00] of a a little bit of of friction you
[56:02] might say between them but was uh Paul
[56:06] wrong was Peter wrong no it was God
[56:09] bringing his word right in line and
[56:11] fine-tuning or honing it and so as we'll
[56:15] come out of the Philadelphia age where
[56:17] manc come in such an intellectual
[56:19] approach to the word it was very hard
[56:22] for them to move from intellectual in
[56:25] other words the mind of man grasping and
[56:28] breaking it down so many scholars of
[56:30] that day learning the ancient text the
[56:33] ancient language because they believed
[56:36] that's what it would take to understand
[56:38] but we move into the leodan age and a
[56:41] prophet comes and says you in your
[56:44] studies in your uh your uh um schooling
[56:48] in your intellectualism will never
[56:50] figure out God this is the day of
[56:53] Revelation this is the day as the eagle
[56:57] anointing has come down and and the
[56:59] eagle my brother and sister the eagle
[57:01] does not have to go and research if it
[57:04] can fly it does not have to stop and say
[57:07] now if I get too high what will happen
[57:10] if I choose to fly low what will happen
[57:13] if I fly here and fly there what will
[57:16] happen the eagle it's born in them amen
[57:20] so they are not there my brother and
[57:22] sister by an intellectual concept we
[57:25] have the tree there in the yard and
[57:27] every year there is there is whatever
[57:29] you call it uh uh red tail hawk they
[57:33] live there and we get to watch this
[57:36] whole
[57:37] transition sometimes just uh in the
[57:40] springtime it just uh very blustery very
[57:43] cold windy uh hail rain and you'll see
[57:46] and now I I don't remember if it's the
[57:49] male or female that sits on the nest
[57:51] predominantly But whichever one it is my
[57:53] brother and sister you can see them up
[57:55] there the wind blowing so hard they're
[57:57] being battered but they know that their
[58:00] future lies in the Revelation and they
[58:03] know as it would be the principle God
[58:05] gave to Sons and Daughters of God we've
[58:07] been given our children amen and they're
[58:10] willing to set through thick and thin
[58:13] the hard times the easy times the sunny
[58:16] times because there's there uh we've got
[58:18] to watch these little fledglings be be
[58:21] hatched and see them chirp chirp and
[58:24] their little heads barely poking out of
[58:25] the nest and we see them as they trans
[58:29] you know transition into the these
[58:32] full-size Birds but they can't fly and
[58:35] now they're on the edge of the nest
[58:37] they've got their little claws sunk in
[58:39] there they've got their wings out and
[58:41] they they look like they they have no
[58:43] equilibrium because they're flapping
[58:44] their wings and almost falling this way
[58:46] and falling that way but then you see
[58:48] something's coming into them called
[58:50] maturity and there comes a day that
[58:53] literally uh you know you'll see them on
[58:55] the ground and you're thinking oh my it
[58:58] fell out of the nest but as you would
[59:00] walk closer to it you'll see it look at
[59:03] you with a sharp eye and hop up in the
[59:06] air and fly now we didn't see any um
[59:11] well we have drivers training right amen
[59:15] sister Vias graduated to the road and uh
[59:19] brother Sergey sister ulie are now the
[59:22] instructors or the terrified
[59:26] but there's you don't see a a hawk
[59:30] trainer showing up saying this is how
[59:33] you learn how to
[59:34] fly there's something changing in them
[59:38] day by day something that they are
[59:41] recognizing saying I am an eagle or a
[59:45] hawk whatever we'll prefer the eagle and
[59:48] it just comes to them they put their
[59:51] wings out Revelation comes to them These
[59:54] Wings weren't for us to just beat around
[59:56] the nest in these These Wings were given
[59:59] to us to fly they get to watch the
[1:00:02] example of their parents they get to
[1:00:04] watch those around them and it clicks
[1:00:07] one day aren't you glad it clicks one
[1:00:09] day amen that it's no longer brother
[1:00:12] bram's Revelation it's no longer this
[1:00:14] brother that brother's Revelation it's
[1:00:16] no longer the pastor's Revelation it's
[1:00:18] no longer Mom or Dad's Revelation it's
[1:00:21] your Revelation amen something clicks
[1:00:24] inside that God is real and I'm going to
[1:00:26] serve him and we're not going to get
[1:00:28] sidetracked on what happens amen many
[1:00:31] times we see it the ones we hold up too
[1:00:33] high as examples God allows them to make
[1:00:36] mistakes and fail so that we will get
[1:00:39] our eyes off of them and get them on him
[1:00:42] amen so our our view should be just
[1:00:45] simply upon Christ now I I want to come
[1:00:48] back and revisit this of the church ages
[1:00:51] here now how many of you would just love
[1:00:54] to have been as bold as a lion
[1:00:57] amen come on Saints just to be bold like
[1:01:00] a lion to go out in the face of the
[1:01:02] opposition and this is the word of the
[1:01:05] hour this is what God Said but you also
[1:01:08] have to remember in that day being as
[1:01:11] bold as a lion there were certain
[1:01:14] attributes of that day that you also had
[1:01:17] to deal with I want to be bold as a lion
[1:01:20] I don't want to have to deal with the
[1:01:23] rest are you with me
[1:01:26] amen so they were bold as a lion in that
[1:01:29] day you know the Apostle Paul he tells
[1:01:32] us all that happened he's been beaten
[1:01:34] Thrice he's been thrown in prison he's
[1:01:36] been starved he's me all of these things
[1:01:39] that has happened and if that's what it
[1:01:41] takes to get boldness that suddenly
[1:01:43] tempers are thought about being
[1:01:47] bold and God transitioned right out of
[1:01:50] being bold as a lion into another
[1:01:53] anointing and that was the off
[1:01:56] anointing and that one my brother and
[1:01:59] sister let's be honest with us this
[1:02:01] morning that one doesn't sound nearly as
[1:02:04] exciting if you're going to beat me I'm
[1:02:06] just going to bear with
[1:02:09] it if you're going to M mistreat us
[1:02:11] you're going to do all of this we we're
[1:02:13] just going to hunker down and we're just
[1:02:17] going to take it well I tell you there's
[1:02:19] something I I don't know if I should use
[1:02:21] myself for an example it's not a great
[1:02:23] example but I'm telling you my brother
[1:02:25] and sister in a great portion of
[1:02:27] humanity when someone comes to misuse
[1:02:29] you abuse you mistreat you most men
[1:02:33] something Rises up inside of them and
[1:02:35] you're not going to do that to
[1:02:38] me but you see when God deals with a son
[1:02:41] of God or daughter of God and under the
[1:02:44] anointing he's got them under it doesn't
[1:02:46] matter what's going on out there God is
[1:02:49] anointing them and so in that day there
[1:02:51] was many a man many a family many a
[1:02:54] mother subjected themselves to the
[1:02:57] persecution of the day but yet if it had
[1:02:59] been without the Holy Ghost which in
[1:03:02] those days wasn't necessarily term to
[1:03:04] those people they didn't fully have a
[1:03:06] grasp of that but without the presence
[1:03:09] of God in their life they would have
[1:03:11] fought back like Warriors they would
[1:03:12] have rebelled they would have had blood
[1:03:15] on their
[1:03:16] hands but God anointed
[1:03:19] them that's not what I called you to do
[1:03:22] I called you to stand here and bear the
[1:03:25] reproach to stand here and bear it even
[1:03:29] at the sacrifice of your
[1:03:33] life that one doesn't sound quite as
[1:03:35] exciting as the lion does
[1:03:38] it and we move out of that anointing
[1:03:40] into the man age the intellectual time
[1:03:44] and my brother and sister it would be
[1:03:46] wonderful now I'm not debasing myself so
[1:03:49] don't misunderstand it'd be wonderful to
[1:03:52] us live in that intellectual age unless
[1:03:54] you're not intellect
[1:03:58] ual and if you're not the one that can
[1:04:00] dig into the deep things and explain
[1:04:03] things and do that suddenly you would
[1:04:05] kind of feel like you are the one left
[1:04:07] out but that was an age that they dug
[1:04:09] into the word and they were able in
[1:04:12] digging into the word unar nuggets you
[1:04:15] might say that that are profound even to
[1:04:18] you and I today we hold to them as as
[1:04:22] truths and it's there but you see it was
[1:04:24] manage but man man wasn't able to keep
[1:04:26] that in balance and man started to move
[1:04:28] into the position of look how smart we
[1:04:31] are look how we can learn this look how
[1:04:33] we can explain this look how we can you
[1:04:36] know learn the languages and and I
[1:04:38] listened to a guy sometime back and he
[1:04:41] was talking about oh they've now and
[1:04:43] they've now found another sub dialect uh
[1:04:46] uh and and we're we need to explore the
[1:04:49] text uh in that dialect to see if it
[1:04:52] brings more Revelation or understanding
[1:04:54] of the meaning and you're sitting there
[1:04:56] thinking okay that's wonderful I still
[1:04:59] haven't mastered English I I'm probably
[1:05:01] not going to move on Beyond English my
[1:05:04] brother and sister because I don't need
[1:05:05] to move Beyond English what I need is a
[1:05:08] revelation of what God is saying not
[1:05:10] what the words were saying the words
[1:05:13] their
[1:05:15] words what's God's words manifested to
[1:05:18] you and I God promised he would open it
[1:05:20] to us you see now I'm not saying we
[1:05:22] disregard God's word but you have to
[1:05:25] understand when they come along there's
[1:05:27] only a half a dozen different things in
[1:05:29] the Bible where they're saying we we
[1:05:32] don't know if that was spoke in Greek we
[1:05:34] don't know if it was Aramaic we don't
[1:05:36] know this we don't know because if it
[1:05:37] means this if it's spoke that way it
[1:05:39] means if it's spoke this way my brother
[1:05:41] and sister they'll never figure that one
[1:05:43] out because they're still trying to open
[1:05:45] the word in the
[1:05:48] manage and we're not living in the man
[1:05:51] age so the intellectual still got to
[1:05:54] send these guys uh away to theology to
[1:05:57] to uh all of these schools and they're
[1:06:01] trying to teach them and and I remember
[1:06:04] coming across a little deal where a man
[1:06:06] says I can spot instantly a man who has
[1:06:09] been uh to a Theological
[1:06:11] Seminary how they make a sermon how they
[1:06:14] speak how they pronounce their words
[1:06:16] it's obvious so this guy's questioning
[1:06:19] were they trained by God or were they
[1:06:20] trained by man he said the Apostle Paul
[1:06:24] was trained by God and he was just fine
[1:06:26] amen amen see it all went to the
[1:06:29] backside of the desert and got knocked
[1:06:30] out of him amen and then God filled him
[1:06:33] up and then he was effective with the
[1:06:36] gospel and we come into this stage here
[1:06:39] which just touched me in the song
[1:06:41] service amen we're in the eagle age
[1:06:44] hallelujah we're in the time my brother
[1:06:46] and sister that we're no longer hopping
[1:06:48] around in the chicken yard but we're
[1:06:50] able by God's grace just to catch that
[1:06:52] little draft of the moving of the Holy
[1:06:54] Spirit and and just rise up into
[1:06:57] Revelation and be able to see what they
[1:06:59] cannot see see further than they can see
[1:07:01] and understand more now that almost
[1:07:04] sounds arrogant I've been told before
[1:07:05] that that is an arrogant approach but
[1:07:07] I'm sorry my brother and sister if you
[1:07:10] see more than they
[1:07:13] see you didn't do
[1:07:15] it that was God in you that was God
[1:07:19] opening the word to you God making it
[1:07:21] alive shining the light on it no man in
[1:07:24] and of himself
[1:07:26] can you might say revelate himself he
[1:07:29] can educate himself but he can't
[1:07:31] revelate himself and so we're now in
[1:07:33] that age of Revelation and uh this is
[1:07:37] all coming in a
[1:07:39] culmination this has come into a
[1:07:41] culmination but until the plan of God is
[1:07:43] completely finished the culmination is
[1:07:45] still unfolding itself so you know
[1:07:48] you'll alternate now I just bear with me
[1:07:50] if you would how many of you have been
[1:07:53] bold amen you've been bold you've put it
[1:07:57] right out there straight this is what
[1:07:59] the word of God says this what God has
[1:08:02] done very bold and then there's times
[1:08:04] that we have just settled in and we are
[1:08:07] the ax amen we are bearing with this you
[1:08:10] know uh uh uh just uh individuals share
[1:08:13] with you you know people they have
[1:08:15] working or business relationships with
[1:08:18] they just batter them all the time you
[1:08:21] know you have to be an a cult it takes
[1:08:23] an ox not to respond to that
[1:08:29] now if you don't experience that it's a
[1:08:32] little hard maybe to understand
[1:08:34] that but if you are bombarded with
[1:08:38] you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong
[1:08:40] it takes an ox anointing not to crumble
[1:08:43] under that kind of pressure amen but we
[1:08:46] have come here today I hope every one of
[1:08:48] us that's of age can read and write amen
[1:08:51] we should be able to amen and it's good
[1:08:54] to come in this day in in this man
[1:08:57] anointing to be able to pick up our
[1:08:59] Bible be able to read our Bible be able
[1:09:02] to correlate be able to go over here in
[1:09:04] the message now pardon me I I'm not
[1:09:07] wanting to sound like a any kind of
[1:09:09] anti- anointing but my brother and
[1:09:11] sister you should not blindly
[1:09:16] follow we have the greatest message on
[1:09:19] Earth but does it tell you blindly
[1:09:22] follow no it tells you search the
[1:09:24] scripture does Amen we should be
[1:09:27] searching the scripture we should be
[1:09:29] finding for our own self this is where
[1:09:33] it's at this is where it's anchored this
[1:09:35] is why I have such confidence in the
[1:09:38] word of the hour is because it's right
[1:09:41] here anchored in my Bible amen now my
[1:09:44] brother and sister we shouldn't become
[1:09:46] cynics we shouldn't come to where we
[1:09:48] question everything that comes around us
[1:09:51] we should know enough of the word of God
[1:09:53] by our studies amen to be able to
[1:09:56] understand and do that a brother years
[1:09:59] ago preaching down in Arizona I loved
[1:10:01] his approach uh he he's preaching and he
[1:10:05] just stops and he says now I'm not going
[1:10:08] to read any quotes to you today because
[1:10:11] if you know the message you know I'm
[1:10:15] quoting the message to
[1:10:18] you amen now it's only those who have no
[1:10:22] idea what they believe or what they
[1:10:23] follow blindly
[1:10:26] that would be able to go I have to have
[1:10:28] quote page paragraph I have to have all
[1:10:32] this my brother and sister that's not
[1:10:34] going to save us amen it's when the word
[1:10:37] becomes living to you and I when the
[1:10:39] word comes alive that we know what God
[1:10:43] is speaking we've read it we've heard it
[1:10:45] we've spoke it we've prayed over it amen
[1:10:48] we've sang about it we've testified of
[1:10:50] it and when those things come real to us
[1:10:53] and you hear it spoken you know it's the
[1:10:56] truth now my brother and sister I don't
[1:10:58] say this entirely in the natural but I
[1:11:00] tell you if you come and you have
[1:11:02] studyed the message like you should
[1:11:04] studied your Bible like you should and
[1:11:06] then you get an anointing of the Holy
[1:11:08] Spirit on top of that there's something
[1:11:10] in you that Rings true back to the back
[1:11:13] to the little tuning Forks amen anything
[1:11:16] added to that tuning fork changes its
[1:11:18] tune anything added to the word changes
[1:11:22] the word amen and when you know the word
[1:11:24] you'll know
[1:11:26] amen but if you're blindly
[1:11:29] following there's where the Deception
[1:11:31] comes you don't know and I say this kind
[1:11:35] of funny because even even as we're
[1:11:37] talking about this everybody says Paul
[1:11:39] you sing an F that's good I don't know
[1:11:41] what f is but I do know where I
[1:11:44] sing so if where I sing an F match then
[1:11:46] I guess I sing an F but my mind doesn't
[1:11:49] say Now sing an
[1:11:51] F my mind says Make a Joyful Noise and
[1:11:55] and I do my best to make the Joyful
[1:11:56] Noise whether it's an f a d a g or
[1:11:59] whatever it might be we could just put
[1:12:01] the whole alphabet out there amen now
[1:12:03] I'm telling you I say this humorously
[1:12:05] sometimes when our musicians are playing
[1:12:07] and brother Paul starts singing at the
[1:12:09] end of the service I know I'm not in any
[1:12:11] known key to
[1:12:14] man I've seen sister via look up kind of
[1:12:18] roll her eye like what is
[1:12:22] this but you see whatever it
[1:12:26] is God corrects that or sometimes our
[1:12:30] piano
[1:12:31] players correct
[1:12:33] that but you get the point amen so
[1:12:37] that's what we're doing we're searching
[1:12:39] for absolute truth because we don't want
[1:12:41] to create our own I don't want to I
[1:12:43] don't want to you know think that I've
[1:12:44] got Revelation to rewrite music amen now
[1:12:48] look at the culmination of the
[1:12:50] ages you are every one of these spirits
[1:12:55] brought down in this day every one of
[1:12:57] the attributes of those ages is right
[1:13:00] here today and every one of those
[1:13:03] Natures amen a lion an ox a man an eagle
[1:13:07] every bit of that lays in you today and
[1:13:10] you'll find yourself if you don't really
[1:13:13] understand you'll find yourself almost
[1:13:15] in a paradox cuz one day you'll be so
[1:13:18] bold and the next day you've turned into
[1:13:20] an
[1:13:22] ox one day you'll understand the
[1:13:26] word written
[1:13:28] words and the next something will come
[1:13:30] to you that is so real you know it's the
[1:13:33] truth and you don't even know where to
[1:13:35] go to prove
[1:13:36] it because that is in you that Spirit of
[1:13:40] the age all come together every one of
[1:13:42] these manifested in
[1:13:45] you I haven't put you to sleep yet have
[1:13:47] I okay let's go here in the 70th week of
[1:13:51] Daniel if you have not read amen uh
[1:13:55] these I I would encourage you to go read
[1:13:59] about 70 weeks of Daniel now we find out
[1:14:03] in this age there's a star as we have
[1:14:06] there we have a Star Messenger we have a
[1:14:09] person a message that goes forth to the
[1:14:12] age a
[1:14:14] people to reject it a people to receive
[1:14:20] it now if in the age there is this group
[1:14:24] of people that been sent forth my
[1:14:26] brother and sister if they're anointed
[1:14:28] to reject it can you change
[1:14:31] them you're still required to live it in
[1:14:35] front of them right none of this well
[1:14:38] I'll just be whatever because they're
[1:14:40] heathens anyhow no you're still required
[1:14:42] to live it in front of them but you must
[1:14:45] realize many of these people will never
[1:14:49] be able to receive it they're called
[1:14:52] they're under an anointing to reject it
[1:14:55] but I tell you what I like the fact that
[1:14:57] brother brandham put second place right
[1:14:59] there there's also a people in the land
[1:15:02] today that has been called to receive
[1:15:05] this amen I don't care how Wicked the
[1:15:07] world out here gets and everything that
[1:15:10] we see my brother and sister oh our
[1:15:12] nation falling apart of course it is the
[1:15:15] scripture has to be fulfilled amen the
[1:15:19] the whole nation the world you look at
[1:15:22] this go study in the message brother
[1:15:24] Bram doesn't say positive thing about
[1:15:26] the United
[1:15:28] Nations that was all the way back then
[1:15:31] that it was established for a purpose
[1:15:34] and that purpose is now being
[1:15:36] fulfilled and so you'll see it the
[1:15:39] people that are here that we care about
[1:15:41] the most as it were that doesn't really
[1:15:43] sound too right does it the ones we
[1:15:45] focus on the most are those that are
[1:15:47] here to receive it amen you see the
[1:15:51] movements where where people I just
[1:15:53] watched one in England the poor preacher
[1:15:55] got beat up amen he's out on a street
[1:15:57] corner and he's calling out these people
[1:16:00] telling them you're a sinner it's
[1:16:01] obvious how do you know I'm a sinner
[1:16:03] just look at you what you've done to
[1:16:05] your own body and look where you stand
[1:16:07] and what you protest for or against your
[1:16:10] unbeliever they ended up just beating
[1:16:12] the poor guy I feel sorry for him but
[1:16:15] you see now if God ordained that so be
[1:16:17] it but you see what he was doing was
[1:16:20] trying to preach the gospel to people
[1:16:22] not able to receive it
[1:16:25] so he had put the
[1:16:27] Pearl this sounds rough before a whole
[1:16:31] herd of
[1:16:32] swine and expected someone there to see
[1:16:35] the value of it but if it's not in them
[1:16:38] to see the value they'll never see the
[1:16:41] value and the scripture says don't cast
[1:16:44] your Pearl before the
[1:16:45] swine H
[1:16:52] amen the word is speaking my brother
[1:16:55] sister can someone agree with that amen
[1:16:57] the word is speaking in this hour amen
[1:17:00] it's not dried up Amen in fact it's
[1:17:02] getting condensed down it's more
[1:17:04] powerful than ever before and there's a
[1:17:06] called out people in the land that are
[1:17:08] hearing and I love that because when you
[1:17:11] think about what is going on in our
[1:17:13] world today where where it seems like uh
[1:17:16] I I just was listening to uh a little
[1:17:19] bit of um a sermon brother Ron Spencer
[1:17:21] preached up at the the camp I think
[1:17:23] brother Sergey sister Julia probably
[1:17:25] were there and and uh I I love the humor
[1:17:28] that brother Ron uh brought out cuz he
[1:17:31] said now uh there were these three
[1:17:34] brothers that could not
[1:17:37] receive the
[1:17:46] word of here I
[1:17:50] stand of believe the
[1:17:53] sign they just couldn't read receive
[1:17:57] it wasn't in them to receive
[1:18:01] it now he put that because he brought it
[1:18:04] into this
[1:18:06] day issues of this day then he reverts
[1:18:09] back to speaking about Shadrach mesach
[1:18:12] and Abednego but my brother and sister
[1:18:14] you look at this and just realize that
[1:18:16] there's no ability in you to believe the
[1:18:21] devil's
[1:18:22] message that ought to give us something
[1:18:25] to say Thank You Lord at the top of our
[1:18:27] voice there's no ability in me to even
[1:18:31] receive the Gospel of leoda Amen the
[1:18:35] word of the hour of leoda nothing in me
[1:18:38] to even take a halt of that and say
[1:18:41] maybe maybe not amen there's something
[1:18:43] in us that says this is not the original
[1:18:46] word this is not God speaking this is
[1:18:49] not God's language amen and it's not
[1:18:51] producing God's result amen I tell you I
[1:18:55] just get excited when I think about that
[1:18:57] amen it sounds a little boastful even
[1:18:59] message people sometimes stagger over
[1:19:02] the idea that you cannot fail you cannot
[1:19:07] fall amen you cannot turn back you say
[1:19:10] but but but but but no we're talking to
[1:19:12] real Believers amen we're not talking to
[1:19:15] churchgoers we're not talking to people
[1:19:17] that are just packing a Bible in a
[1:19:18] message book we're talking to those that
[1:19:21] know down in the depths of their soul
[1:19:24] that they were called before the
[1:19:25] foundation of the world to serve God and
[1:19:28] finish the race amen it's not for us to
[1:19:31] hope it's for us to know amen the
[1:19:34] Mysteries are finished we know who we
[1:19:38] are in Jesus Christ and if we don't we
[1:19:41] ought to stop and get real serious about
[1:19:43] sorting that out because if you don't
[1:19:45] know my brother and sister it can come
[1:19:47] so close the word says deceive the very
[1:19:52] elect thank you brother Trevor
[1:19:57] if come on let's say it together if it
[1:20:01] were possible amen but I tell you the
[1:20:04] devil can't make the impossible possible
[1:20:07] or the possible impossible amen he has
[1:20:10] no ability to establish the word in the
[1:20:14] heart of the believer he can establish
[1:20:16] the word in the heart of the people who
[1:20:19] are anointed to reject it but my brother
[1:20:21] and sister he cannot establish the word
[1:20:24] in the heart of the people that God said
[1:20:26] they are there predestinated to receive
[1:20:28] it oh thank you Lord so you know we have
[1:20:31] the parable of the SE amen this not the
[1:20:34] same in the soul my brother and sister
[1:20:36] of Sons and Daughters of God the devil's
[1:20:38] not going to come in and plant a seed
[1:20:40] that causes you to fall
[1:20:43] away that's why we're sealed by the holy
[1:20:45] spirit amen that's why it's got to be a
[1:20:48] personal
[1:20:49] relationship now my brother and sister
[1:20:51] when you think about that you think
[1:20:53] about how personal that is is it's not
[1:20:56] just we we've preached back and forth
[1:20:57] here in the church about the Holy Ghost
[1:21:00] and being anointed of the Holy Ghost man
[1:21:02] be anointed of the Holy Ghost all the
[1:21:03] days of his life still go to hell that's
[1:21:05] because it never became personal to him
[1:21:08] he had an intellectual understanding of
[1:21:10] the moving of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:21:13] anointing on the Holy Spirit moved them
[1:21:16] yeah but it never sealed
[1:21:19] them
[1:21:21] amen you know a brother one time in a
[1:21:26] land that has lots of water asked me if
[1:21:30] you didn't have any water not enough to
[1:21:33] immerse
[1:21:34] someone to baptize them would sprinkling
[1:21:38] them or splashing them be
[1:21:41] sufficient and I I'm just
[1:21:45] like just walked out of a service in
[1:21:47] fact we ended up
[1:21:48] down in a
[1:21:52] baptism I didn't understand what it
[1:21:57] was but you see if the devil can get us
[1:22:00] to clip our
[1:22:06] sentence just leave a little of it
[1:22:09] out I asked the brother I said is this
[1:22:12] figuratively spiritual or
[1:22:14] natural he wasn't sure how to answer
[1:22:17] that so he just chose
[1:22:19] natural and I says then you haven't
[1:22:21] searched far
[1:22:22] enough cuz in China
[1:22:25] some of those countries no most of us
[1:22:27] wouldn't fit in a 55 gallon barrel amen
[1:22:32] but you know our dear little Chinese
[1:22:33] Brothers they just have you know this
[1:22:35] little Barrel right there and I wouldn't
[1:22:39] even dare try it but you know they just
[1:22:42] go to baptize them and they just like
[1:22:44] accordion upon
[1:22:46] themselves till the waters over their
[1:22:49] head and they're baptized I told that
[1:22:52] brother at that time I says if you can't
[1:22:53] find a water to baptize somebody you
[1:22:56] haven't traveled far
[1:22:58] enough you haven't searched hard enough
[1:23:01] amen see the devil wants to make it
[1:23:06] convenient the Lord wants it to be his
[1:23:09] word amen amen hallelujah so the word is
[1:23:14] speaking calling out a people a called
[1:23:17] out people's hearing it see what's
[1:23:18] building up my brother and sister I want
[1:23:21] to ask you just very direct this might
[1:23:23] not be the most inspired service ever
[1:23:25] did but it's what's on my heart today
[1:23:27] amen I tell you my brother and sister as
[1:23:30] you ever come to a place that that you
[1:23:32] just feel like something's building up
[1:23:35] amen you've heard the word preached I I
[1:23:37] love it I have to admit I love it when
[1:23:39] when you preach and after church people
[1:23:42] say I I just was reading that sermon or
[1:23:44] just listen to that sermon or just
[1:23:46] finished that book and what it tells me
[1:23:49] is that God is building up a people and
[1:23:51] it's not about the preacher it's about
[1:23:53] God coming down and meeting a specific
[1:23:56] need and building us up getting us into
[1:23:58] a position where we're able not just for
[1:24:01] the moment but to receive what he's got
[1:24:03] coming to us you see God's not living in
[1:24:06] history in fact when this sermon is over
[1:24:09] here in a little while it will be
[1:24:11] history and God is preparing you for
[1:24:13] what he's got for you for maybe later
[1:24:15] today or tomorrow or the day or the week
[1:24:18] or the month or the year after God is
[1:24:20] preparing you for that future because
[1:24:22] we're coming into a Time of complete
[1:24:25] maturity amen now Revelation unfolding
[1:24:28] aren't you glad how Revelation unfolds
[1:24:31] amen it's never us having 400 pages of
[1:24:35] notes and suddenly having a aha
[1:24:39] moment you can have your 400 pages of
[1:24:41] notes I don't care about that but when
[1:24:43] you think it's because you studied out
[1:24:45] all those notes is the reason you got
[1:24:47] that you've missed it amen it's when you
[1:24:50] recognize my brother and sister that God
[1:24:53] is preparing you for something greater
[1:24:57] amen and what our preparation is today I
[1:24:59] want to ask you the prophet of God said
[1:25:02] the Rapture should take place any time
[1:25:04] and we are 50 60 years beyond that does
[1:25:07] that mean we've missed the
[1:25:14] boat well what if I brought you a few
[1:25:18] preachers that believe you missed the
[1:25:23] boat would you accept
[1:25:28] that no
[1:25:30] way God's timing is perfect his word is
[1:25:33] perfect and his people to receive the
[1:25:35] word are perfect amen he didn't call in
[1:25:39] a bunch of it's a cattle term we call
[1:25:41] them lepes you know the cats that never
[1:25:44] Thrive they're always the rough-haired
[1:25:46] scrawny you know just don't do very good
[1:25:49] you know lepes he didn't call lepes my
[1:25:52] brother and sister he called the finest
[1:25:54] people people on the face of the Earth
[1:25:55] to be a part of the Bride those amen we
[1:25:58] might not be great intellectually or or
[1:26:01] physical or looks or strength or
[1:26:03] whatever it is but in God's eyes you are
[1:26:06] the greatest people on the face of the
[1:26:08] Earth filled with the word amen and the
[1:26:10] life that he has poured into you is
[1:26:12] bringing forth the selfsame seed that
[1:26:16] was poured in amen not another seed
[1:26:20] hallelujah amen see what happens
[1:26:26] I don't know how to word this
[1:26:29] quite I definitely know there was a
[1:26:31] stage in my life that this happened very
[1:26:37] regularly there would be a little
[1:26:38] question
[1:26:41] mark and I would ponder it and I would
[1:26:44] look for it maybe you heard a minister
[1:26:49] speak and maybe you didn't understand it
[1:26:52] you might even be able to get a cassette
[1:26:54] you guys know what that is right
[1:26:57] um and listen to it again and still you
[1:27:01] realize something's missing I'm not
[1:27:02] getting this and literally a period of
[1:27:06] time this is why my brother and sister
[1:27:08] the prophet of God told us that if you
[1:27:10] don't understand it you don't Chuck it
[1:27:12] away you put it up on the shelf and you
[1:27:16] let that then In God's Time be revealed
[1:27:20] to you and I'm speaking from personal
[1:27:22] experience there was times there was
[1:27:24] questions I had I couldn't I searched
[1:27:26] for an answer I couldn't find an answer
[1:27:28] and one day I'm sitting there I pick up
[1:27:30] a message book and it just kind of opens
[1:27:33] to a certain Page by
[1:27:36] accident by accident and I look down on
[1:27:39] the page and right there on the page is
[1:27:42] my answer that's right amen God's timing
[1:27:45] is perfect the season is perfect one I
[1:27:48] needed to desire the answer not for
[1:27:50] intellectual concept but a yearning and
[1:27:53] a hunger of the Soul saying Lord I want
[1:27:55] that question answered for my own Soul's
[1:27:58] sake Lord I want that answered and then
[1:28:01] God says okay you come the day is the
[1:28:04] day and he lays the right message book
[1:28:06] now I told sister Jerry I probably
[1:28:09] shouldn't say this in public I told
[1:28:11] sister Jerry I'm turning over a new Leaf
[1:28:13] church I'm turning over a new Leaf I
[1:28:17] told sister Jerry I'm putting all the
[1:28:19] message books around our house
[1:28:22] away and I'm just going to read them one
[1:28:24] at a
[1:28:26] time if I sit in that chair I got a
[1:28:28] message book for that chair if I sit on
[1:28:30] the couch I got a message book for the
[1:28:32] couch I hate to say this in public if
[1:28:35] I'm in the restroom I have a message
[1:28:37] book for the
[1:28:39] restroom and then I never know where did
[1:28:42] I read
[1:28:43] that and I'm I'm solving that I'm
[1:28:46] putting everything away and I'm just
[1:28:48] going to have one book I mean I'm
[1:28:50] working on putting everything away
[1:28:56] but you see my brother and sister it
[1:28:58] doesn't matter if there's 10 books in
[1:28:59] the house 10 tapes one in your car one
[1:29:02] in your other car one in your other car
[1:29:04] one in your bedroom one in your it
[1:29:06] doesn't matter when God wants to answer
[1:29:08] the question he put you in the word
[1:29:10] together amen it's not a man it's not a
[1:29:13] program it's God putting you and the
[1:29:15] word together hallelujah amen
[1:29:22] amen you see
[1:29:26] we'll look at this let me Focus just a
[1:29:28] little on the negative we see the
[1:29:30] spirits of the day we see what's going
[1:29:32] on out
[1:29:34] here
[1:29:38] um I'm not looking my brother and sister
[1:29:40] at the barroom or the dance hall that's
[1:29:43] not what we canare for that really fits
[1:29:46] to those that in many cases have already
[1:29:49] rejected
[1:29:51] there but look at this now I'm not
[1:29:54] saying that there's not people there
[1:29:55] still to be gleaned amen don't
[1:29:57] misunderstand me but you see when you
[1:30:00] look more of a Time piece of the world
[1:30:03] today is the condition of the
[1:30:06] Church saints what condition is Grace
[1:30:10] Tabernacle
[1:30:16] in it doesn't matter what the nazarenes
[1:30:18] or Baptists or methodists are doing what
[1:30:22] condition
[1:30:24] is Grace Tabernacle
[1:30:26] in what is what is going on what is the
[1:30:30] cycle of the word is the word barely
[1:30:33] alive is it on you know life
[1:30:37] support or is it vibrant
[1:30:41] living amen got strength and Power
[1:30:45] Authority but I'm going to throw this
[1:30:47] out to you I hope you don't
[1:30:49] understand
[1:30:51] amen you see
[1:30:54] it takes
[1:30:57] Revelation to understand the depths of
[1:30:59] the spirit
[1:31:02] today and that's on both
[1:31:05] sides when you look out here and you see
[1:31:07] what's happening in the world it's
[1:31:08] really easy to say well they don't have
[1:31:09] the message they don't have this they're
[1:31:11] you know unless they change their loss
[1:31:13] but you see we really need to understand
[1:31:16] what's happening with these
[1:31:18] people CU that coworker
[1:31:24] well can I share a real quick testimony
[1:31:27] a brother shared with me how that he
[1:31:29] worked with a man that just had a
[1:31:30] terrible mouth and it just grieved him
[1:31:34] just to have to listen to this guy
[1:31:36] sometimes and and one day he's there
[1:31:39] working and the guy just started
[1:31:40] speaking these things and they were so
[1:31:42] horrendous finally he just reached a
[1:31:44] point he says I didn't realize till
[1:31:47] later God had his hand in it but to me I
[1:31:49] just thought I had a temper
[1:31:52] tantrum come on H you know anybody ever
[1:31:54] had a temper tantrum you know yeah no no
[1:31:57] okay good good yeah and the guy actually
[1:32:01] worked across like a double desk or
[1:32:03] table thing from him and he said I just
[1:32:06] told
[1:32:07] him you need to shut your mouth that's
[1:32:10] nothing but the devil
[1:32:11] speaking and the guy was just
[1:32:17] like few days go by he said
[1:32:21] hey was you serious
[1:32:25] and he said I was serious when you talk
[1:32:29] like that that's nothing but the devil
[1:32:31] this man says well I don't want to serve
[1:32:34] the devil this brother talk about bold
[1:32:38] then
[1:32:41] don't what do I do about it well he said
[1:32:45] my wording could have been better he
[1:32:47] said come to church with me and that'll
[1:32:50] solve your problem afterwards he thought
[1:32:53] well it ain't my Church
[1:32:55] uh but guess what God allowed a man with
[1:33:01] a filthy
[1:33:02] mouth his life to be radically
[1:33:07] changed because someone was anointed
[1:33:10] with a lion anointing
[1:33:13] amen my imagine what it'd be like even
[1:33:16] amongst us if sometimes at the right
[1:33:20] time the lion anointing raised up I'm
[1:33:23] not talking about you sister
[1:33:27] Jerry but when that lion anointing Rises
[1:33:30] up instead of us saying well that just
[1:33:33] ain't right that should be if we just be
[1:33:35] like
[1:33:36] nope look that ain't according to the
[1:33:38] word I love you but face up to the fact
[1:33:41] that's not God
[1:33:44] speaking but we're all politically
[1:33:47] correct and we feel warm and
[1:33:49] fuzzy and we don't want to hurt
[1:33:51] anybody's feelings
[1:33:54] but why don't we just go ahead and tie a
[1:33:56] ribbon around the quote where the
[1:33:57] prophet of God said paraphrased you
[1:34:01] cannot offend a son or daughter of God
[1:34:07] Amen well
[1:34:09] Hallelujah that's not us slapping their
[1:34:11] head off and embarrassing or shaming
[1:34:14] them but that would be
[1:34:17] us not taking the
[1:34:20] ox approach when we should be a lion
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:28] yeah anyway I I want to stay focused I
[1:34:31] want to stay
[1:34:32] focus so you have to understand the
[1:34:37] depth and the moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:40] to understand the things of God but for
[1:34:43] you to have compassion and understanding
[1:34:46] on what's going on in our our I say our
[1:34:48] nation it's in the world you have to
[1:34:51] have an understanding of the depth of
[1:34:54] the evil that is out here that anointing
[1:34:57] the depth of that evil you need to have
[1:34:59] an understanding in Genesis 6 and fif
[1:35:02] six and five I mean amen God saw that
[1:35:06] the wickedness of man was great in the
[1:35:08] earth and that every imagination of the
[1:35:10] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:35:14] continually see so right here in in
[1:35:17] Genesis we're we're seeing that God was
[1:35:20] giving a a view for us to understand
[1:35:22] what is happening we're coming to an age
[1:35:25] my brother and sister I I don't want to
[1:35:27] go in politics but it just fits into the
[1:35:29] world we're living in almost everything
[1:35:31] it's been revealed in the last few years
[1:35:33] almost everything about our government
[1:35:36] is
[1:35:37] corrupt and if people are innocent when
[1:35:39] they go in they're corrupt when they
[1:35:41] come out amen and we get all wound up
[1:35:44] not all of us but some get wound up
[1:35:47] about that but I want to tell you all
[1:35:49] that is is a Time piece amen it has to
[1:35:53] come to this stage that God is looking
[1:35:56] at this present age the same as he
[1:35:59] looked here in Genesis 6 and5 amen and
[1:36:02] we're coming there we're coming there
[1:36:04] quickly amen But realize even these
[1:36:07] Wicked people it's not them it's
[1:36:09] anointing upon
[1:36:13] them now you have to take that same
[1:36:16] approach my brother and sister and when
[1:36:18] you come in your trial and you feel like
[1:36:20] that you have come short but you are
[1:36:22] still there and you get down and repent
[1:36:24] over what you see as this great tragedy
[1:36:27] a a misfortune of your failure and
[1:36:30] you'll realize that the very thing that
[1:36:32] is motivating them on one side amen as
[1:36:36] the can't believe it there is on the
[1:36:38] other side causing you to come right
[1:36:41] back causing you to say I can't quit I
[1:36:44] won't quit I believe this it changed my
[1:36:48] life I did come short I did fall down
[1:36:51] but I got back up again by the grace of
[1:36:54] God and I will not stay down I will get
[1:36:57] back up and I will say Lord forgive me
[1:37:00] and give me the strength to press on
[1:37:03] that's a bride's response my brother and
[1:37:05] sister not to call it quit not to say
[1:37:08] I'm a failure I would do this but I'm a
[1:37:12] failure that's not the bride's response
[1:37:14] the bride says there's blood Lord
[1:37:17] forgive me but there is blood that is
[1:37:19] covering me right now and that blood is
[1:37:22] just as fresh right now as it was at
[1:37:25] Calvary and it's just as powerful right
[1:37:27] now as it was at Calvary I don't have to
[1:37:30] go and mope and crawl in a cave and hope
[1:37:33] that someday God forgives me but when we
[1:37:36] get that Revelation that's when we
[1:37:39] become Victorious that's when we rise up
[1:37:42] and there's joy in our heart to serve
[1:37:44] God in every
[1:37:46] situation amen oh Hallelujah we have by
[1:37:50] God's grace oh let me put it this way I
[1:37:53] study things so weird sometimes I even
[1:37:56] think it's
[1:38:00] weird but you got the world
[1:38:03] today people coming into
[1:38:07] church they like their
[1:38:11] baggage they don't really want
[1:38:14] Deliverance what they want is the church
[1:38:17] to accept them as they are
[1:38:25] well I'll tell you come to
[1:38:27] church amen if you're sinning come to
[1:38:31] church amen you've probably seen the
[1:38:35] deal if you're drinking come to church
[1:38:37] if you're doing all these got a whole
[1:38:38] list of things come to
[1:38:40] church but expect God to change you
[1:38:44] amen see there's the whole thing but the
[1:38:47] devil twist this around I lied I can't
[1:38:49] go to church I did this I can't go to
[1:38:51] church I did that I can't go to chur
[1:38:55] church so you just find a church that
[1:38:57] will accept you as you
[1:38:59] are no that's not God's
[1:39:02] recipe
[1:39:06] amen see we have to understand when we
[1:39:10] understand the depths of sin this might
[1:39:13] seem a little weird to you to say you
[1:39:14] need to understand the depths of sin but
[1:39:16] when you understand the depths of
[1:39:19] sin then you understand the depths of
[1:39:22] God's grace
[1:39:24] in your life here
[1:39:26] today amen when you realize where you
[1:39:29] could have been without him and you see
[1:39:32] where you are with him it gives you
[1:39:35] Revelation to understand the depth of
[1:39:38] the love of Christ amen and when we
[1:39:41] understand that depth it changes the way
[1:39:43] our lives are amen now look at this
[1:39:46] would you guys agree with me today that
[1:39:48] the signs if if you well Jerry and I
[1:39:51] used to take a newspaper
[1:39:55] until it just become trash this been
[1:39:59] many years back and we just gave up on
[1:40:01] it so we all get a little news in some
[1:40:04] form or fashion some way right um and
[1:40:09] when you look at the end is is the end
[1:40:12] not upon us
[1:40:15] yes I mean you take a tour to Israel I
[1:40:19] don't know I think you guys was standing
[1:40:21] right there at that time when we was up
[1:40:22] on the top top world the cave was and
[1:40:25] the uh horse carved and the metal horse
[1:40:28] and all these other things and the stone
[1:40:30] feed troughs and yeah and we're standing
[1:40:32] up there and looking down in this Valley
[1:40:34] and the guid's like yep right there
[1:40:38] between that point and that
[1:40:41] point is the biblical spot of the battle
[1:40:44] of
[1:40:45] Armageddon not even a question whether
[1:40:48] it's going to be a
[1:40:49] battle of Armageddon or
[1:40:51] not they have scripturally figured out
[1:40:54] it's going to take place right
[1:40:57] here oh but that's way off in the future
[1:40:59] we don't have to worry about
[1:41:02] that well I'm not worried about it I'm
[1:41:05] going to be prepared for it though amen
[1:41:08] because I didn't put it in quotations
[1:41:09] are here today but I just read this
[1:41:11] morning the prophet of God said I won't
[1:41:13] go in the whole context but prophet of
[1:41:15] God says you don't have to worry about
[1:41:17] that kind of shocking in a way he says
[1:41:18] you don't have to worry about Seven
[1:41:20] Seals you don't have to worry about the
[1:41:21] vials you don't have to worry about all
[1:41:22] this stuff cuz you're not going to be
[1:41:25] here oh you mean I don't have to tie
[1:41:28] this one together with a little string
[1:41:30] to that one and know how this is all
[1:41:32] going to come out no my brother and
[1:41:33] sister we're not going to sit on a hill
[1:41:35] with our binoculars and Mark one up for
[1:41:37] those on the left mark one up for those
[1:41:39] on the right battle Armageddon boy this
[1:41:42] is interesting look how this is playing
[1:41:43] out no sir we'll be long gone fact I
[1:41:47] think I know where we'll be we'll be
[1:41:48] standing Before the Throne saying oh
[1:41:50] Lord how we love you how we thank you
[1:41:52] Father you Grace your mercy your
[1:41:54] kindness to us oh in case you guys don't
[1:41:56] know I uh forgot my wrist watch this
[1:42:02] morning it's almost a perfect
[1:42:06] excuse let me cut through a little of
[1:42:08] this the prophet of God shows us very
[1:42:11] clearly that actually the messenger to
[1:42:13] the age comes at the end of the
[1:42:17] age now we can get into all kinds of
[1:42:20] things and and prove them we can say
[1:42:23] well okay we've moved from age to age
[1:42:26] right we're no longer in
[1:42:28] leoda you realize Sons and Daughters of
[1:42:30] God sealed with the Holy Ghost are no
[1:42:32] longer the victims of
[1:42:35] leoda Amen they're in the bride's
[1:42:38] Revival the bride's age they're in the
[1:42:40] presence we're in the presence of the
[1:42:43] sun getting all of that baked out of us
[1:42:48] amen we could probably start a Doctrine
[1:42:50] the baking
[1:42:53] but it's true Saints we're here come on
[1:42:57] think about this now I don't want to get
[1:43:00] too personal with you but how many of
[1:43:01] you feel like you made a mistake this
[1:43:03] last
[1:43:04] week and some of you know you made a
[1:43:06] mistake this last week yeah we won't go
[1:43:09] into detail sister Carrie sister car's
[1:43:12] going to pull her notebook up here in a
[1:43:16] minute and then the rest of us going to
[1:43:19] borrow it from her and say I got to put
[1:43:20] my page in there too
[1:43:23] but you see my brother and sister
[1:43:25] knowing we made a
[1:43:27] mistake is one thing knowing how we
[1:43:32] fixed and I say that past tense because
[1:43:34] it should be
[1:43:36] fixed how we fixed it is a greater
[1:43:40] Revelation than knowing how you made it
[1:43:43] that's
[1:43:45] right because without fixing it you have
[1:43:49] a
[1:43:51] problem but fixing it
[1:43:54] the problem is solved now those of you
[1:43:56] going through great
[1:43:58] trials you don't feel like it's fixed
[1:44:01] those of you that that you know things
[1:44:04] of the minds things of emotion things of
[1:44:06] finance things of children things of
[1:44:09] marriage all of these things you don't
[1:44:10] feel like it's fixed but I'm here to
[1:44:12] tell you when you gave it to Christ it's
[1:44:16] fixed it's fixed you don't look for a
[1:44:19] solution you look for the results amen
[1:44:22] if if he said it it's finished amen amen
[1:44:26] now look you know we see that he knocked
[1:44:29] on the door and what did you
[1:44:33] do opened it see that's what's
[1:44:36] separating the bride from the rest of
[1:44:39] the
[1:44:41] world have you guys
[1:44:44] ever ever done something like this you
[1:44:47] just live life houses were meant to be
[1:44:49] lived in right
[1:44:53] but they're never clean enough when the
[1:44:54] doorbell
[1:44:58] rings
[1:45:01] never so where do you put all that
[1:45:05] stuff anywhere that's out of sight is
[1:45:10] good
[1:45:11] enough vacuum
[1:45:13] cleaner behind the door in the laundry
[1:45:15] room how come we can't open the door in
[1:45:17] the laundry room the vacuum cleaner
[1:45:19] lives there now papers they go in the
[1:45:24] stool in the middle of the living room
[1:45:25] raise the
[1:45:31] lid that's the anointing of the
[1:45:34] age no one wants to deal with their
[1:45:39] housekeeping they want to find an
[1:45:41] alternate place to put
[1:45:45] it the bride her response I've got only
[1:45:49] one place I can put this and that is
[1:45:53] under the blood amen that's the bride's
[1:45:56] response I want to cut out a little bit
[1:45:57] of this amen there's a few things you
[1:46:01] know Galatians 51 and John 8 and
[1:46:04] 36 uh you know talking about Liberty but
[1:46:07] I I want to just focus on this real
[1:46:09] quick and then we'll be finished you see
[1:46:12] Saints sometimes we have reoccurring
[1:46:15] things that happen in our life we get
[1:46:17] Victory and Satan shows up on Monday
[1:46:19] morning does his very best to steal that
[1:46:21] from you
[1:46:25] because he wants to keep you where
[1:46:27] you've
[1:46:29] been not where the word said you're
[1:46:32] going he wants to landlock you amen so I
[1:46:38] I encourage you and I'm speaking to Paul
[1:46:40] here amen get free amen we we look at
[1:46:45] this you know Galatians 5 uh I I just
[1:46:48] have to read it stand fast therefore in
[1:46:50] the Liberty wherewith Christ is made us
[1:46:53] free and be not entangled again in the
[1:46:55] Yoke of bondage see this this is
[1:46:58] something that's a much stronger
[1:47:00] scripture than we give it credit for
[1:47:02] because when we come to the place that
[1:47:05] we are not entangled and we know that we
[1:47:08] are free that gives you the Liberty to
[1:47:10] step forward into the unknown when you
[1:47:14] have no Liberty my brother and sister
[1:47:16] you're not going to go out in the
[1:47:20] unknown come on amen John 8:36 if the
[1:47:25] son therefore shall make you free you
[1:47:27] shall be free indeed these are
[1:47:29] foundational scriptures that we need to
[1:47:32] get free enough and have confidence
[1:47:34] enough that your voice your voice starts
[1:47:37] to
[1:47:38] overpower negative thoughts amen when
[1:47:42] you stand and say you know what I'm a
[1:47:44] Son of God
[1:47:46] maybe thank God it's been a long
[1:47:49] time but have any of you ever I remember
[1:47:53] a situation many years
[1:47:56] ago somebody said something and the
[1:47:59] answer came out of me so fast I didn't
[1:48:01] even have brain cells to function on it
[1:48:04] it was just like no no it wasn't like
[1:48:07] that but what I answered was a
[1:48:12] lie how could it come out of us so
[1:48:15] quickly like they almost hadn't even
[1:48:17] finished
[1:48:19] speaking and we're speaking a lie
[1:48:26] you guys look awfully
[1:48:30] solemn am I out to lunch or am I too
[1:48:33] close to
[1:48:34] home no
[1:48:37] answer look my brother and sister beyond
[1:48:41] that your telephone will ring and
[1:48:44] somebody will say will you pray for
[1:48:46] me what kind of results can response can
[1:48:49] we give them no I can't pray for you
[1:48:53] I'm a liar oh that was inside our head
[1:48:56] wasn't
[1:48:58] it and Satan knows that and he sets the
[1:49:03] stage keep you
[1:49:06] bound but we're free the word says we're
[1:49:10] a free people let's live free let's act
[1:49:14] like we're free let's praise God like
[1:49:16] we're free amen worship like we're free
[1:49:18] my brother and sister take the promises
[1:49:21] of the word we're free
[1:49:23] we've been set free and we are not only
[1:49:26] free we're free indeed amen
[1:49:29] hallelujah oh Hallelujah I've got I've
[1:49:32] got quite a bit more but I want to just
[1:49:34] touch in Revelations
[1:49:36] 22 right here verse 10 because I want
[1:49:40] you to understand how protected we are
[1:49:42] as Sons and Daughters of God and he
[1:49:45] saith unto me seal not the sayings of
[1:49:47] the prophecy of this book for the time
[1:49:50] is at hand he that is unjust let be
[1:49:52] unjust still and he which is filthy let
[1:49:55] him be filthy still and he that is
[1:49:57] righteous let him be righteous still and
[1:49:59] he that is Holy let him be holy still
[1:50:02] amen I'm telling you I like the second
[1:50:05] half of verse 11 because we my brother
[1:50:08] and sister are righteous and we Are Holy
[1:50:11] and the word is telling us it will
[1:50:14] continue amen and behold I come quickly
[1:50:17] and my reward is with me to give every
[1:50:19] man according as his Works shall be I am
[1:50:21] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:50:23] end the first and the last blessed are
[1:50:26] they that do his Commandments that they
[1:50:28] may have right to the tree of life and
[1:50:31] may enter through the gates into the
[1:50:33] city so here once again just like it is
[1:50:36] in Revelations 2 and 3 he's giving us
[1:50:39] the reward he's telling us this is what
[1:50:42] I've got in store for you amen because
[1:50:45] he knew that we are not going to be
[1:50:48] filthy still amen he knew that we were
[1:50:51] going to be holy and he knew that we
[1:50:53] were going to be righteous and he's
[1:50:54] offered a great reward now look what's
[1:50:57] on the
[1:50:59] outside this out here my brother and
[1:51:02] sister that God has sealed you
[1:51:05] from we talk about being sealed oh I'm
[1:51:08] sealed with the Holy Spirit well you can
[1:51:10] put that to a natural tangible ceiling
[1:51:13] that is there to show you what he sealed
[1:51:16] you from are you with me amen amen so
[1:51:20] it's not just talk it's not just
[1:51:22] language or lingo that he's saying but
[1:51:24] he's he's pointing out for without our
[1:51:27] dogs and Sorcerers whoremongers and
[1:51:29] murderers and idolators and whosoever
[1:51:31] loveth and maketh a lie I Jesus have
[1:51:35] sent my angel to testify unto you these
[1:51:39] things in the churches I am the root and
[1:51:41] The Offspring of David and the bright
[1:51:43] and Morning
[1:51:45] Star and this is the result of Liberty
[1:51:51] in the word amen
[1:51:53] this is the result of overcoming life
[1:51:58] and he says the spirit and you say
[1:52:03] come without that confidence of the word
[1:52:06] Saints without the right
[1:52:09] response what could we
[1:52:13] say could we testify of overcoming power
[1:52:16] when we have no
[1:52:18] Victory we testify of potential
[1:52:25] when we don't see
[1:52:28] it surprisingly
[1:52:31] enough you
[1:52:35] should then remind your body that it's
[1:52:38] supposed to obey your
[1:52:45] confession but the battle that's in the
[1:52:48] mind tells us I can't witness to that
[1:52:55] am maybe I've just I always jokingly say
[1:52:59] this but then I see the looks on
[1:53:00] people's faces and you realize it's true
[1:53:03] you know really hard to come to church
[1:53:04] and worship when you fought with the
[1:53:06] wife or husband all the way to
[1:53:08] church you know hard to walk in the door
[1:53:11] and praise God I feel like praising the
[1:53:13] Lord
[1:53:15] today you know down in South America
[1:53:18] brother down there brother Elias got a
[1:53:20] great sense of humor he told me one
[1:53:26] day he says ' brother Paul you know why
[1:53:29] the altar is so full on our church on
[1:53:31] Sunday
[1:53:32] mornings and I was like no I don't know
[1:53:35] brother he gets this little grin he goes
[1:53:39] they're repenting of everything that
[1:53:40] happened between their house and the
[1:53:44] church I'm
[1:53:45] like
[1:53:47] H maybe we need to implement something
[1:53:50] like that
[1:53:52] oh I wished I could afford to bring him
[1:53:55] here you guys would love him but we'd
[1:53:57] have to bring an interpreter and then
[1:53:58] we'd have to bring his wife and then his
[1:54:00] kids would need to come
[1:54:02] and for without her dogs Sorcerers
[1:54:05] whoremongers murderers
[1:54:07] idolators those that love making a lie
[1:54:10] see that's why God wants you to
[1:54:12] recognize the spirits of the
[1:54:13] day he wants you to
[1:54:16] see what is happening what influence is
[1:54:20] on
[1:54:21] you
[1:54:24] hm can I be bold and ask you guys this
[1:54:28] question how well are you recognizing
[1:54:32] the spirits on
[1:54:35] you oh I I include
[1:54:39] myself I think sometimes we don't do a
[1:54:41] very good job or else we wouldn't have
[1:54:45] some of these
[1:54:47] issues Lord help us to be able to come
[1:54:50] and say no wrong spirit not going
[1:54:54] there what you don't do is say wrong
[1:54:56] Spirit on you
[1:54:57] wife that don't work very
[1:55:00] well but sometimes it literally is about
[1:55:03] that
[1:55:04] obvious somebody support me with an
[1:55:09] amen amen let's stand sister VI if you
[1:55:12] would
[1:55:15] come we may or may not preach the rest
[1:55:17] of this who
[1:55:19] knows but
[1:55:23] it's always interesting you know when
[1:55:24] you look at this and you
[1:55:27] see God sent a mighty Angel Gabriel to
[1:55:32] Daniel gave him clear Direction you see
[1:55:36] Daniel didn't have to wander in the
[1:55:38] dark and neither do we amen a mighty
[1:55:42] Angel's been sent to us in this day if
[1:55:46] we live by it amen take it as our
[1:55:50] counsel our lives would be a lot simpler
[1:55:54] amen
[1:55:55] hallelujah and
[1:56:03] um can
[1:56:07] I you're standing can
[1:56:09] I read one
[1:56:12] more proving his
[1:56:14] word I love this quote when I come
[1:56:16] across
[1:56:18] it notice it was by his
[1:56:21] Believers that he proves his word
[1:56:25] by Praise the Lord you're not here just
[1:56:27] to try and live the message you're not
[1:56:30] here just trying to be a good Christian
[1:56:32] you're here proving God's
[1:56:36] word he can only prove his word not by
[1:56:38] unbelievers it's only by the Believers
[1:56:41] that he can prove his word no matter how
[1:56:43] much the rest of them claim to be oh I
[1:56:45] believe brother see if you do God will
[1:56:48] prove it so because we look and see the
[1:56:50] others how can we say then see it's by
[1:56:53] True Believers that he proves his word
[1:56:55] not by those who say they believe but
[1:56:58] those who really believe it's by his
[1:57:01] believing children that he proves his
[1:57:05] word Lord I want to be your Proving
[1:57:07] Ground I want to be the very life I want
[1:57:11] when a man would pass away reminded me
[1:57:14] of a man that I knew as a young man I
[1:57:17] actually worked for them on their farm
[1:57:18] at one point in life he was a Bible
[1:57:21] missionary they believe the Trinity and
[1:57:23] different various things but this man
[1:57:26] Leroy was a real
[1:57:29] Christian real
[1:57:31] Christian this is rude but I'd say I'd
[1:57:33] question the rest of his family but
[1:57:35] Leroy himself real
[1:57:37] Christian and at his
[1:57:39] funeral it wasn't just words but people
[1:57:44] grown rugged men got up and said I've
[1:57:47] never known a man like this
[1:57:50] man and and it stuck with me Lord if I
[1:57:55] pass before your
[1:57:57] coming let there be a testimony that
[1:58:00] someone would be able to say I never met
[1:58:04] someone like this
[1:58:07] before help us to be those people
[1:58:13] amen
