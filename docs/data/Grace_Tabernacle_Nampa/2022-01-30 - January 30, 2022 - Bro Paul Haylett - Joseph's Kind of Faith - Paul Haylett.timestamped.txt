[35:48] go into the word of god but first i want
[35:51] to turn or take my original thought as i
[35:53] did on mary's kind of faith from first
[35:55] peter 1 1-9
[35:58] and
[35:59] we're looking at this my brother and
[36:00] sister and understanding that as time
[36:04] gets further and further along
[36:06] now when the prophet of god prophesied
[36:08] that america
[36:10] would be bankrupt you know he said that
[36:14] it already was
[36:16] but we can look now at the acceleration
[36:19] of time my brother and sister now the
[36:22] prophet of god
[36:24] brings us into the scripture and shows
[36:26] us very clearly that when the scripture
[36:28] is talking about time being shortened my
[36:32] brother and sister people sometimes get
[36:34] that idea that god had to shorten the
[36:36] time to save the people and the
[36:38] scripture puts it thus but remember this
[36:41] principle
[36:43] god will not take an immature bride
[36:46] so as time is shortened this bride
[36:50] under the light of the sun
[36:53] is maturing very quickly she is coming
[36:57] to this place of maturity where this
[36:59] relationship that she has with jesus
[37:03] christ
[37:04] is is coming to fruition
[37:07] now there are some things that you could
[37:09] as a farmer you could harvest
[37:12] and then you could you could find a way
[37:15] to deal with it in an immature state
[37:18] but my brother and sister
[37:20] wheat
[37:22] is something that lies in the sun
[37:25] until it's ready
[37:31] come on
[37:32] has to lie in the sun
[37:34] amen
[37:36] first peter 1 1
[37:38] peter an apostle of jesus christ to the
[37:41] strangers
[37:43] scattered throughout pontus galatia
[37:45] cappadocia asia and bithya
[37:48] elect
[37:50] according to the foreknowledge of god
[37:53] so these strangers my brother and sister
[37:56] are actually only strangers in the fact
[37:59] of an unnamed and uncounted
[38:02] number
[38:04] otherwise they're not strangers to the
[38:06] word
[38:09] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[38:10] god the father through sanctification of
[38:13] the spirit
[38:14] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[38:17] blood of jesus christ and now pardon me
[38:19] for interjecting a couple of these
[38:21] things
[38:22] but the prophet of god said that no
[38:24] person
[38:26] will make it there
[38:28] absent
[38:30] the blood
[38:35] so i want to dispel some myths that
[38:37] float around
[38:39] that god would
[38:40] just take this person because he was a
[38:42] good person
[38:44] no no
[38:46] the blood
[38:48] has to be present
[38:51] he clarifies it only takes one drop
[38:55] the power of the blood is not as it were
[38:57] in quantity as to be drenched or
[39:00] but just
[39:02] one drop
[39:06] thank you lord
[39:09] amen
[39:14] sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ
[39:16] grace unto you and peace be multiplying
[39:18] blessed be the god and father of our
[39:20] lord jesus christ which according to his
[39:23] abundant mercy hath begotten us again
[39:26] into a lively hope by the resurrection
[39:29] of jesus christ from the dead
[39:31] to an inheritance incorruptible
[39:34] now my brother and sister this
[39:36] inheritance doesn't become incorruptible
[39:39] over there it is incorruptible here now
[39:44] amen
[39:46] and undefiled
[39:48] that fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[39:50] for you who are kept by the power of god
[39:52] can someone say thank you lord
[39:54] who are kept by the power of god
[39:57] through faith
[39:59] unto salvation ready to be revealed in
[40:02] the last time and i want to take out of
[40:05] verse 5 right there if you'll just give
[40:06] me a little bit of grace here not to
[40:09] change the word of god but to change it
[40:11] in this fashion for you to understand
[40:13] who are kept by the power of god through
[40:15] faith into salvation betty ready to be
[40:18] revealed at the right
[40:21] time
[40:25] are you with me
[40:27] amen
[40:28] for you it might be in a certain
[40:29] situation here for me it might be
[40:31] entirely this different situation the
[40:34] seasons of our lives are different but
[40:36] we can say that in the last time in the
[40:39] right time for you and i it will be
[40:41] manifested
[40:47] you know some bloggers sometimes they'll
[40:49] say things like we are so sad at the
[40:51] current state of the message
[40:56] i see where they're coming from
[41:00] but i'm overjoyed
[41:03] i'm excited
[41:05] about the current stage
[41:07] or state of the message
[41:10] amen closer to jesus christ than ever
[41:13] before
[41:15] more faith in this word than ever
[41:18] before now my heart breaks that other
[41:21] people are slipping away
[41:24] but i'm telling you there's a bride
[41:25] who's been drawn closer and closer in
[41:28] fact she's so close she has went down to
[41:31] the threshing floor she has lifted the
[41:33] blanket and she has laid down at his
[41:36] feet and declared unto him do with me as
[41:39] you would
[41:45] hallelujah just waiting for the word you
[41:48] go
[41:49] don't you love that you go i'll take
[41:51] care of everything else
[41:54] she didn't have to go down there and say
[41:55] okay naomi i better run down get a
[41:58] marriage license and i better go make
[41:59] sure all the witnesses are going to be
[42:01] in the courtyard today and i better this
[42:03] and i better make sure he wears a pair
[42:04] of slip-on shoes
[42:08] no sir
[42:10] she just said he's got it all in control
[42:13] no sorry to keep you standing i'm just
[42:15] excited this morning so excited i fought
[42:18] with the wife before i come to church
[42:20] amen
[42:21] hallelujah
[42:22] amen i'm telling you the devil rared his
[42:25] head up and you know i got all bent out
[42:27] of shape over cat food
[42:31] come on i just want to be honest
[42:34] and then
[42:35] i got bent out of shape only that was me
[42:37] being bent over my father's knee and
[42:40] being corrected
[42:42] hallelujah
[42:44] so after i got bent out of shape i got
[42:46] bent out of shape
[42:48] amen
[42:49] to an inheritance let me re-read this
[42:51] because it just really means a lot to me
[42:53] this morning to an inheritance
[42:54] incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth
[42:56] not away reserved in heaven for everyone
[43:00] else
[43:01] for you
[43:02] who are kept by the power of god through
[43:04] faith into salvation ready to be
[43:06] revealed in the last time wherein ye
[43:09] greatly rejoice though now for a season
[43:12] if need be you're in heaviness through
[43:15] your
[43:16] manifold temptations of the cat food
[43:22] no
[43:23] the devil anoint anything he can anoint
[43:26] he don't care what it is
[43:31] that the trial
[43:33] of your faith
[43:35] being much more precious than of gold
[43:37] the paris
[43:38] though be tried with fire might be found
[43:40] into praise and honor and glory at the
[43:42] appearing of jesus christ
[43:44] oh my brother and sister and we're going
[43:46] to tie this appearing today together in
[43:48] a little bit different fashion
[43:50] amen whom having not seen ye love aren't
[43:54] you glad something in your heart is i
[43:56] love you lord
[43:58] in whom though now you see him not yet
[44:00] believing ye rejoice with joy
[44:03] unspeakable and full of glory receiving
[44:06] the end of your faith even the salvation
[44:08] of your souls i want to go back to verse
[44:11] 8 and read it again to make an emphasis
[44:14] whom having not seen ye love
[44:16] in whom though you now
[44:19] though now ye see him not yet
[44:22] believing
[44:25] amen you rejoice with joy and speakable
[44:28] and full of glory heavenly father i pray
[44:30] you just help us to articulate speak
[44:32] this today lord may you come down and
[44:35] anoint your word let us speak only thy
[44:37] word in the name of jesus christ amen
[44:40] you may be seated saints
[44:55] so as we look at this
[44:59] we realize that not one of us
[45:02] will finish this race without having our
[45:04] faith tried
[45:06] and
[45:07] it is something that we must grab or
[45:10] grasp the halts of with a steadfast
[45:12] conviction it must be something that we
[45:15] are gripped in our soul not just for a
[45:17] season many times and it breaks my heart
[45:20] but you'll see people serve god for
[45:22] seasons and then go away and we pray
[45:25] that the season will come again in their
[45:27] life will they'll come back in
[45:28] repentance to the word but we have to
[45:31] have a steadfast conviction and this
[45:34] steadfast conviction my brother and
[45:36] sister is necessary to unlock the power
[45:40] of the word amen to unlock uh the
[45:42] revelation of the word you can't just
[45:44] have a half-hearted approach uh to uh
[45:48] the word of god for this hour and say
[45:50] well if you know um there there are
[45:53] things i'll just save that a good
[45:55] analogy but i'll save it for a future
[45:57] service but you look at this and realize
[46:00] that
[46:00] you cannot truly serve god as a
[46:03] committed christian
[46:05] without having an absolute steadfast
[46:08] conviction
[46:09] that the word of god is for you
[46:12] if you just believe that it's well you
[46:14] know this is mom and dad's religion this
[46:17] is uh convenient uh this is what then it
[46:20] it will limit my brother and sister what
[46:23] you will gather from the word of god and
[46:26] as i said we we had a service uh just a
[46:29] few past speaking on mary's kind of
[46:31] faith and uh we want to speak more on
[46:34] that subject uh in the near future but
[46:37] we'll look at that and just to recap
[46:39] that a bit my brother and sister as mary
[46:42] is there now it was prophecy it would
[46:45] have been taught amongst the faithful uh
[46:48] of parents um mothers to their daughters
[46:51] that someday there will come a time when
[46:53] the messiah will come and he'll come
[46:56] through a virgin birth through a young
[46:58] girl and and you know it could be you
[47:01] sweetheart so live your life
[47:04] to uh be such that it could be you and
[47:07] so israel would have had a host of
[47:10] of young women young uh daughters that
[47:13] would have been saying you know could it
[47:15] be me and no doubt amongst those there
[47:18] would be some that would say no for sure
[47:20] it's not you daughter you got a little
[47:21] rebellious spirit you're this you're
[47:23] that you're not pretty enough whatever
[47:25] it might be as it is that people have
[47:27] misguided things of judging but you know
[47:30] you look at this and and see and then
[47:32] others would have been just actually on
[47:34] the other end of the scale honey there's
[47:36] no one in israel it compares to you
[47:38] you're the greatest daughter ever you're
[47:40] going to be the one but yet god had
[47:43] already if we believe in predestination
[47:45] god already knew mary he already knew
[47:48] everything about her and while no doubt
[47:51] a very humble family as history would
[47:53] say not a very well-off family but it
[47:56] was there that god was laying down
[47:58] inside of her little things of her life
[48:02] that was being anchored down to where
[48:04] she just knew if this word said it amen
[48:07] if the word said it it would come to
[48:09] pass we believe the prophecies of the
[48:12] prophets and and we hold to those things
[48:14] as being the word of god and so it was
[48:17] there that she had been you might say
[48:19] raised in such a fashion that she
[48:22] understood there would be a girl one day
[48:24] now my brother and sister i don't know
[48:26] if this has happened to you i know at
[48:28] the time that god healed my foot many
[48:30] years ago uh
[48:32] it was such that as i was standing there
[48:35] in the service i knew
[48:37] something was happening
[48:40] now i didn't know enough to stand up and
[48:42] say praise the lord saints god's just
[48:45] healed my foot but i knew something
[48:48] was happening
[48:50] now the manifestation of it was just a
[48:52] few short days later i knew god had
[48:54] healed my foot
[48:56] but you know i believe that mary must
[48:58] have known there was something something
[49:00] you might say tingling within her that
[49:03] that she had a purpose in life she
[49:05] wasn't just a common girl but maybe she
[49:08] didn't have direction of that maybe she
[49:11] just thought you know i'm going to live
[49:13] my life as a faithful wife and mother
[49:15] teaching my kids i'm going to raise them
[49:18] in the fear and admonition of the lord
[49:19] i'm going to be the best mother i can be
[49:22] and she had conviction of those things
[49:24] that she believed in and so it's there
[49:27] that she was committed
[49:29] and it is there certainly
[49:31] that something started to happen in her
[49:34] life and as we know this scripture we
[49:35] won't go back into it but then when the
[49:38] angel comes gabriel comes to her and
[49:41] tells her you know you have found
[49:42] exceeding favor
[49:50] saints do you realize the age that we
[49:52] live in when you look at the world
[49:53] around you
[49:56] we cannot deny
[50:00] we have received
[50:02] great favor
[50:03] in the eyes of god
[50:06] great favor
[50:14] and certainly she speaks those words
[50:17] that speak so strongly to me
[50:20] being unto me according to thy word and
[50:22] i believe that ought to be every one of
[50:24] us testimony that we could no matter
[50:26] what the circumstance is it's not being
[50:30] unto me according to the circumstance of
[50:32] laodicea
[50:33] don't be it unto me according to how i
[50:36] feel
[50:37] or what someone else has said to me or
[50:40] about me
[50:41] but be it unto me according to thy word
[50:46] you see my brother and sister that kicks
[50:48] out all the negative that kicks out all
[50:50] satan's influence it kicks all of the
[50:52] the prejudice and
[50:54] judicious favor of mankind and brings it
[50:58] right down to the very essence of what
[51:00] this is about and so it's there as as
[51:04] mary was speaking i believe those
[51:06] weren't just common words that she spoke
[51:08] out but they were anointed of the holy
[51:09] ghost and she declared that and that
[51:12] opened the door but you see god must
[51:14] speak from both sides
[51:17] you know there's there's times and and
[51:19] we see circumstances in life and you
[51:22] know it reminds me kind of a funny story
[51:25] young man
[51:26] he was just certain
[51:28] that this young sister was going to
[51:30] marry him
[51:32] and one day he got his courage
[51:34] and he comes and says you know
[51:37] sister so and so
[51:38] before the year's out
[51:41] you'll be my wife
[51:44] she just looked at him
[51:46] i can see it now maybe even raised her
[51:48] nose a little and said well that isn't
[51:50] what the lord told me
[51:54] see god works on both ends
[51:57] right the prophet of god preaching to us
[51:59] about deep calleth to the deep
[52:01] if there's a deep
[52:02] calling there has to be a deep there to
[52:06] respond
[52:09] you see what was the devil's anointing
[52:11] on israel when they come out of egypt
[52:14] you've led us here to the wilderness
[52:17] to die
[52:19] that's not how god works when god calls
[52:21] you out he calls you in
[52:23] amen god's never called the people out
[52:25] to just leave them in a wilderness of
[52:27] sin
[52:30] god never intended for israel to have
[52:33] the response at kadish that they had but
[52:35] they set themselves up to that response
[52:37] not god but yet they walk through the
[52:40] wilderness watching the elders die
[52:42] blaming god for their circumstance which
[52:45] only made the situation worse
[52:50] because they refused come on you know
[52:52] what i'm talking about
[52:53] we refuse to accept
[52:58] the responsibility
[53:01] because you see what happens when we
[53:03] accept the responsibility every son and
[53:05] daughter of god that accepts a
[53:06] responsibility repents
[53:11] you can have a situation and somebody
[53:13] says well this is this and this is that
[53:15] but my brother and sister you'll know
[53:17] whether they've caught the revelation of
[53:18] it whether or not they'll repent when
[53:20] the word is given to them
[53:22] we're not talking about being beaten
[53:24] with the word we're talking about the
[53:26] word coming in love and yet if they
[53:28] refuse to then be corrected the
[53:30] scripture is very blunt about where they
[53:33] stand
[53:34] so god always works on both sides of any
[53:36] situation
[53:37] now look how mary
[53:40] i'm going to just speak this uh don't
[53:42] get too spiritual on me because i'm
[53:43] going to just put this in blunt words uh
[53:45] that that uh would describe
[53:48] here is a prophecy
[53:52] and along comes mary and she fits
[53:55] the prophecy
[53:57] now
[53:58] there's always the old question did the
[54:00] egg or the chicken come first
[54:05] and i'm going to throw this at you just
[54:07] for you to ponder
[54:11] if god knew before the foundation of the
[54:13] world that mary
[54:15] would be the chosen one
[54:19] did mary come first or the prophecy
[54:26] the prophecy did
[54:29] god's speaking it see we think often
[54:31] times that it's the man speaking brings
[54:35] the prophecy but we'll touch it i
[54:37] believe if we get to it here today we'll
[54:39] touch on that you see it's always god's
[54:41] voice it's never the man
[54:43] it's never the man i want you to catch
[54:45] that it's never the man it's always
[54:47] god's voice
[54:49] amen when god chooses to use the man to
[54:52] speak that is the expression of the
[54:54] thoughts of god being brought forth in
[54:57] language as it were in whatever native
[54:59] tongue it might be being brought forth
[55:01] it's god's thought and god's thoughts
[55:03] are eternal so long before there was a
[55:06] mary there was a prophecy that there
[55:08] would be a mary
[55:12] but she fit so perfectly in the plan of
[55:15] god
[55:16] and so now what happens is actually the
[55:19] voice of the angel
[55:21] is the confirmation that it was mary
[55:24] that fit that place in the plan of god
[55:27] in other words mary had to be notified
[55:30] mary had to know that she had been now
[55:34] chosen to fulfill a prophecy that all of
[55:38] israel that was well taught
[55:40] knew
[55:42] every family had gathered around the
[55:45] torah and of the writings and they was
[55:47] there they knew that a virgin would
[55:50] conceive
[55:53] and so now it comes that mary
[55:57] has been notified
[55:59] in this day and age it might be like a
[56:01] knock on the door and
[56:02] here is your
[56:05] mailgram or whatever they call those
[56:06] things and you would open it up and be
[56:08] notified god's thought is so much
[56:10] important that he sends an angel
[56:13] comes down and he doesn't just hand her
[56:14] a letter
[56:17] i i want to get to that hopefully i will
[56:20] maybe i'll just get to it right now
[56:22] he doesn't handle it look my brother and
[56:23] sister we have been handed a letter
[56:29] i hope you get this we've been handed a
[56:31] letter
[56:33] notifying of who we are
[56:36] and we've been handed another letter
[56:37] which we would call the message
[56:39] notifying who we are but the message is
[56:42] not complete until you have met the
[56:45] messenger meeting jesus christ face to
[56:48] face
[56:50] there's where the true essence of the
[56:53] message lies in meeting face to face
[56:57] it is not a second or third hand message
[57:00] it is a personal message we've received
[57:03] the letter and god said i'll come and
[57:04] make that letter real to you we've
[57:06] received a message and god said i'll
[57:08] come and make that message real to you
[57:11] and we said here in faith saying be it
[57:14] unto me
[57:15] according to thy word because i want to
[57:18] receive a revelation of who i am i am
[57:22] not mary to bring forth the messiah but
[57:25] i am the bride to bring forth the very
[57:29] child or essence of the manifestation of
[57:32] the spirit of christ in you we call to
[57:35] bring that out
[57:37] hallelujah the letter my brother oh
[57:40] you're gonna say brother paul i argue
[57:41] with you but the letter alone won't do
[57:43] it
[57:47] the letter won't do it
[57:49] gabriel could have said to mary you are
[57:52] gonna bring forth the man-child you're
[57:54] going to bring forth the messiah but if
[57:57] the holy ghost had never anointed her
[58:02] she could have had all the writing
[58:05] all the writing she could have posted
[58:07] the prophecies on the walls of her house
[58:09] walls of her bedroom and it said yes yes
[58:12] yes but unless the holy ghost fell right
[58:15] because it said this that is within you
[58:17] is of the holy ghost
[58:19] so if the spirit never fell she would
[58:21] have never been pregnated
[58:23] oh my brother and sister we can have all
[58:25] the bible we can have all the message
[58:26] but unless the spirit falls we will
[58:28] never be pregnanted with the word of god
[58:30] in this hour
[58:32] hallelujah
[58:37] so mary fits so perfectly
[58:40] this confirmation comes from an angel
[58:43] now let's look at this as well just go
[58:45] forward here
[58:47] joseph we don't talk about joseph much
[58:49] do we
[58:53] he fit the plan of god just as perfectly
[58:54] as mary did
[59:00] now the word joseph means perfection
[59:04] so here was a man my brother and sister
[59:06] that come
[59:07] right down through the lineage
[59:09] it had to be the perfect lineage
[59:13] well it was perfect language because god
[59:14] made it so i mean i don't know i look at
[59:16] rahab and i kind of question whether
[59:19] that could possibly be good i don't know
[59:23] i mean
[59:24] look where she come from
[59:28] some of us are never going to forget
[59:30] where rahab come from
[59:32] i don't care who she married and whether
[59:34] they let her in the tabernacle to
[59:36] worship or not we know where she came
[59:40] from
[59:46] come on
[59:49] come on i i
[59:50] without really
[59:51] just diving in and hammering on i want
[59:53] you to understand my brother and sister
[59:55] some people have such elevated things of
[59:58] where they come from and who they knew
[1:00:00] and who they rubbed shoulders with and
[1:00:01] who baptized them and what church they
[1:00:04] were raised in my brother and sister it
[1:00:06] don't matter
[1:00:08] god said there's a little woman by the
[1:00:10] name of rahab and i'm going to run a
[1:00:13] scarlet thread not a brown one not a
[1:00:16] green one you know cause brown and green
[1:00:18] would match the rocks a little better
[1:00:21] camouflaging who she was and what was
[1:00:23] happening no god said i'm gonna have a
[1:00:24] scarlet thread it can't be hid it can be
[1:00:27] seen by anyone who will look but i'll
[1:00:29] blind the eyes of those who cannot
[1:00:32] understand
[1:00:34] and she's there
[1:00:37] oh my goodness i'll get off track here
[1:00:39] but just one moment you know there's so
[1:00:41] many crazy things out here in the world
[1:00:44] well those two spies knew rahab because
[1:00:46] they were customers
[1:00:53] come on
[1:00:54] what carnal minds
[1:00:57] can grasp at
[1:01:00] without catching a revelation
[1:01:03] that something
[1:01:05] was tingling
[1:01:07] in rahab
[1:01:13] we've heard of israel we've heard of you
[1:01:14] we've heard of your conquering and we've
[1:01:16] heard of all these things and the people
[1:01:18] are shaking with fear but i rahab am
[1:01:21] actually shaking with anticipation
[1:01:25] because i believe
[1:01:28] in jehovah
[1:01:34] i don't know bible doesn't show it that
[1:01:35] way but i'm telling you we see all
[1:01:37] through scriptures where god led by a
[1:01:39] pillar of fire i can see them two
[1:01:41] servants you know brother trevor they
[1:01:43] did their very best to camouflage
[1:01:45] themselves
[1:01:47] go back study the scripture
[1:01:50] and yet there were people that went
[1:01:52] they're strangers
[1:01:57] soon and very soon
[1:01:59] we are going to meet the king
[1:02:02] well hallelujah
[1:02:04] we don't belong here we don't look like
[1:02:06] them we don't act like them
[1:02:08] we don't think like them we don't sing
[1:02:10] like them we don't dress like them
[1:02:14] how are you going to hide
[1:02:17] you can't
[1:02:19] before i preach on rahab instead my
[1:02:21] thought this morning i just want you to
[1:02:22] know my brother and sister
[1:02:24] that when that touch of the blood
[1:02:27] touches
[1:02:29] it'll be more like what sin
[1:02:31] are you talking about
[1:02:33] what sin
[1:02:35] so joseph fits the plan of god and my
[1:02:37] brother and sister and we could look at
[1:02:40] this as though just about any man could
[1:02:42] fulfill this and and here would be mary
[1:02:44] as a young woman and we know that joseph
[1:02:47] was quite a few years older but mary as
[1:02:49] a young woman and no doubt in school and
[1:02:52] in the streets
[1:02:53] city or her neighborhood there'd be a
[1:02:55] young man who who liked her maybe even
[1:02:58] thought he loved her and one here one
[1:03:00] there whatever childhood friends but you
[1:03:02] see my brother and sister god so ordains
[1:03:05] things to detail together so perfectly
[1:03:08] one mind would say just about anyone
[1:03:10] because after all it was not joseph's
[1:03:13] seed amen so any man could have
[1:03:16] fulfilled that but you realize it could
[1:03:18] not have been any man it had to be a
[1:03:21] predestinated man who could step into
[1:03:24] the shoes and this position because i'm
[1:03:27] telling you i wouldn't want to been that
[1:03:28] man
[1:03:31] that was not a that was not an easy
[1:03:33] position to to fulfill to
[1:03:37] to walk in now let's go to matthew 1 18
[1:03:40] if we would and it goes here now the
[1:03:42] birth of jesus christ was on this wise
[1:03:45] when as his mother mary
[1:03:48] see how the word is written
[1:03:51] now as the incubator mary
[1:03:55] but you see god's going to stumble the
[1:03:58] wise
[1:04:01] he's going to stumble the intellectual
[1:04:03] it's going to stumble a lot of people
[1:04:07] espouse to joseph now i want you to
[1:04:09] understand this my brother and sister
[1:04:11] this word espoused in our mind see
[1:04:13] they're already married this is not an
[1:04:15] engagement because and young people
[1:04:16] listen to me please
[1:04:18] when you make a commitment to mary
[1:04:21] there's only one option to put a halt to
[1:04:23] that and that will be your father
[1:04:25] stopping it so you make promises of
[1:04:28] marriage
[1:04:31] you better know what you're doing
[1:04:33] it better not be just a game and if
[1:04:35] something changes we'll just sweep it
[1:04:37] all under a rug so see here
[1:04:40] joseph and mary were espoused together
[1:04:43] they'd never been together never had
[1:04:44] relationships they were espoused they
[1:04:46] were man and wife and it's in that
[1:04:49] position that god comes he chose the
[1:04:52] seas and i hope you get this he chose
[1:04:54] this season and put it in such a place
[1:04:57] joseph's natural love for mary had grown
[1:05:01] and come into a maturity that it was not
[1:05:04] just a fleeting boy whim of a cute girl
[1:05:07] but this was a deep enduring love of a
[1:05:10] man who knows this is the woman for me
[1:05:13] and so god allowed it to come into that
[1:05:16] maturity at that state because it would
[1:05:18] take that kind of commitment to
[1:05:20] withstand
[1:05:22] what's coming
[1:05:26] before they came together she was found
[1:05:28] with child now i'm going to just kind of
[1:05:29] tell you my brother and sister how it
[1:05:31] must have been and i hope this isn't too
[1:05:33] graphic or too strong but i'm telling
[1:05:36] you here's joseph looking forward at
[1:05:38] this beautiful young lady mary his
[1:05:40] espoused wife and you know the day the
[1:05:43] baby bump shows up and i mean this man
[1:05:46] is shaken to the very roots of his life
[1:05:49] because he thought this was the girl a
[1:05:52] godly girl a girl that prays she reads
[1:05:54] she studies she is just faithful how can
[1:05:58] this be and his world now has become
[1:06:01] shaken to a point that he does not know
[1:06:04] what will i do
[1:06:06] what will i do
[1:06:08] my brother and sister
[1:06:10] this
[1:06:11] was not without scandal
[1:06:15] this is not without scandal and here's
[1:06:17] joseph he's never been with her
[1:06:20] you understand the laws such it was in
[1:06:22] that day that a man step out of turn
[1:06:26] they were very harsh not this day and
[1:06:27] age we live in like oh hug them kiss
[1:06:30] them love them
[1:06:31] you know live them we'll live with them
[1:06:33] a while so you know what you who you're
[1:06:35] marrying
[1:06:36] uh it'll just be okay god understands
[1:06:38] none of this nonsense
[1:06:40] they had very strict rules
[1:06:42] and there was no exemptions
[1:06:46] look at this
[1:06:50] what am i gonna do
[1:06:54] now you see
[1:06:55] we can judge the character of joseph
[1:06:58] by the simple fact that god chose him
[1:07:01] to be that man
[1:07:03] to fulfill that position amen
[1:07:09] and the scripture says
[1:07:11] being a just man
[1:07:15] not willing to shame her publicly
[1:07:18] he knew what was happening
[1:07:21] was wrong
[1:07:24] she's with child she's been with someone
[1:07:26] else besides me and the timing of
[1:07:28] everything is wrong and and i i still
[1:07:31] love her
[1:07:32] but being a just man let me put it this
[1:07:34] way
[1:07:35] this was a man
[1:07:37] that knew
[1:07:38] what it was to judge and be judged
[1:07:42] he knew you know what
[1:07:44] i think we just very quietly
[1:07:47] we'll we'll go to another neighborhood
[1:07:49] we'll go to another
[1:07:50] we'll go on down over here we'll go down
[1:07:52] over here and
[1:07:54] then i'll just
[1:07:55] i'll just
[1:07:56] put her away
[1:07:58] she'll have a baby
[1:08:00] it'll be she'll go out of people's minds
[1:08:03] no one will know
[1:08:05] i don't want to shame her
[1:08:06] i want to destroy her in her own
[1:08:08] community
[1:08:16] so he's minded he's starting to think
[1:08:18] you know i probably just need to do it
[1:08:20] this quietly
[1:08:21] let's just do this this quietly
[1:08:29] but wally thought on these things
[1:08:34] while he's trying to figure it out
[1:08:36] himself
[1:08:38] god says i know the son i chose and i
[1:08:40] know what it chose him for and i know
[1:08:42] what he'll go through and i have made
[1:08:44] him just as i made a whale for jonah i
[1:08:47] have made joseph for mary for jesus
[1:08:55] and behold
[1:08:58] see the difference
[1:09:00] an angel come face to face with mary
[1:09:04] there was a commission my brother and
[1:09:05] sister
[1:09:06] that wouldn't even be done through a
[1:09:08] letter
[1:09:09] it wouldn't be done through any other
[1:09:11] fashion it was direct
[1:09:13] an angel which was the mouthpiece of god
[1:09:16] speaking to mary
[1:09:19] but now god comes now and chooses a
[1:09:22] slightly different fashion
[1:09:24] i believe my brother and sister now i
[1:09:26] want to deviate and i'm not speaking
[1:09:27] about me but i can relate to this in a
[1:09:29] certain fashion here many many years ago
[1:09:32] jerry and i attending a different church
[1:09:34] here in the valley certain things were
[1:09:36] happening
[1:09:37] and i i i i kind of wished in a way that
[1:09:40] it would still happen in my life
[1:09:44] but god come in a certain season
[1:09:46] and it's like a voice spoke to me and
[1:09:48] says when you go to church this sunday
[1:09:50] this and this will happen
[1:09:52] and i thought well it's just my yeah i
[1:09:54] gotta get my head screwed on straight
[1:09:57] here
[1:09:59] i never said a word to jerry the first
[1:10:01] time it ever happened but i went to
[1:10:02] church that next sunday
[1:10:04] and lo and behold exactly
[1:10:07] what that was spoke to me
[1:10:10] and the individuals
[1:10:11] they were trying to woo us
[1:10:14] and wind us into a circumstance
[1:10:19] and because of those thoughts my brother
[1:10:21] and sister and i put it as thoughts i
[1:10:23] don't want to call it discernment i
[1:10:25] don't want i don't want to make a
[1:10:26] something glorified i just know it was
[1:10:27] real to me and and it was there and i
[1:10:30] was like no no sorry i can't go
[1:10:32] and a little bit of time goes by two
[1:10:34] three weeks the boy speaks to me again
[1:10:36] says when you go this sunday you're
[1:10:37] going to be invited on a trip all
[1:10:39] expenses paid to go be in a certain deal
[1:10:41] don't go
[1:10:44] we get to church that sunday and they're
[1:10:46] there hey we're going to travel to here
[1:10:48] and we're going to do that and and our
[1:10:50] back seat is open we have room for
[1:10:52] luggage and we'll pay for everything
[1:10:54] come with us
[1:10:59] you know what happens
[1:11:01] the conversation replays itself
[1:11:04] and you're like
[1:11:06] this
[1:11:07] is exactly
[1:11:09] what that voice
[1:11:11] said
[1:11:12] and that happened about a half a dozen
[1:11:14] times saints
[1:11:16] and you know what i got to the place it
[1:11:18] i shouldn't say it doesn't happen too
[1:11:19] many more it happens in a different
[1:11:21] fashion let me correct that
[1:11:24] i trust that voice
[1:11:26] i trust that voice it never failed me
[1:11:28] i'm not making some great spiritual
[1:11:30] thing out of it often times it is simple
[1:11:32] everyday things of life don't do it
[1:11:36] and you listen to that voice i'm not
[1:11:38] gonna do it
[1:11:40] amen so now look at this here he is this
[1:11:44] is just the start saints
[1:11:48] of god
[1:11:49] speaking to joseph
[1:11:51] this is not the end all of it this is
[1:11:53] actually the start god starts speaking
[1:11:56] to him go down here go over here leave
[1:11:59] it this time leave now
[1:12:02] and what does he do he's trusting the
[1:12:04] voice
[1:12:05] he's trusting the voice for his hour
[1:12:07] that god used to speak to him he's
[1:12:09] trusting that voice
[1:12:13] while he fought on these things behold
[1:12:15] the angel of the lord appeared unto him
[1:12:18] in a dream
[1:12:23] why not in person
[1:12:29] because this was how god chose to
[1:12:31] communicate
[1:12:32] with
[1:12:33] joseph amen
[1:12:36] god's choice not joseph's
[1:12:41] saying joseph
[1:12:43] i love
[1:12:45] how god always identifies who you are
[1:12:49] joseph thou son of david
[1:12:52] joseph would have known yep i'm not just
[1:12:55] a son
[1:12:56] and the reference to david is not far
[1:12:59] off and distant but i
[1:13:01] am of his heritage
[1:13:04] i'm of the bloodline
[1:13:08] you know when the prophet of god speaks
[1:13:09] about bloodline talk about herefords
[1:13:11] going up in the mountains and all this
[1:13:12] stuff saints this is what he's really
[1:13:14] talking about in another language to you
[1:13:16] it's about the bloodline if the
[1:13:18] bloodline is not there then it don't
[1:13:21] matter what grass you're eating and
[1:13:23] where you're living it won't matter if
[1:13:26] the bloodline is not there
[1:13:29] amen joseph the son of david fear not
[1:13:33] see what he do identified it up here
[1:13:38] i'm kind of surmising forgive me
[1:13:41] but do you think joseph identified it as
[1:13:43] fear
[1:13:45] see what the devil's doing in this day
[1:13:47] and age we live in
[1:13:48] he's coming down we don't identify it as
[1:13:50] fear we identify it as issue this issue
[1:13:53] that issue something here something
[1:13:55] there but when the angel come he cuts
[1:13:57] right to the chase and he says
[1:13:59] joseph the son of david fear not
[1:14:03] to take unto thee mary thy wife for that
[1:14:06] which is conceived of her is of the holy
[1:14:09] ghost
[1:14:11] now you go prior to this saints
[1:14:15] little homework everybody for some
[1:14:16] homework
[1:14:20] how far prior to this do you find the
[1:14:23] scripture referring to the holy ghost
[1:14:30] this is not a legacy
[1:14:32] where joseph could go back
[1:14:33] and say well we'll just see what isaiah
[1:14:36] said about the holy ghost
[1:14:37] we'll go back and see what what is here
[1:14:40] what is here my brother and sister you
[1:14:42] see the holy ghost
[1:14:44] as terminology is concerned
[1:14:47] was a relatively new
[1:14:50] way of expressing right new covenant
[1:14:53] god expressing himself in a different
[1:14:54] fashion you don't see joseph saying now
[1:14:57] i don't get this holy ghost stuff you're
[1:14:59] talking about
[1:15:00] i don't know why can you give me some
[1:15:02] documentation which one of the prophets
[1:15:04] talked about that
[1:15:06] but if you have a discerning mind you
[1:15:08] can go back through the old testament
[1:15:09] there's the holy ghost there's the holy
[1:15:11] ghost there's the holy ghost there's the
[1:15:12] holy ghost there's the holy ghost you
[1:15:14] see they didn't know god by terminology
[1:15:17] only they knew god by experience
[1:15:20] amen so you have people in the day that
[1:15:22] we're living in saying well no brother
[1:15:25] meant this when he said this and he
[1:15:26] meant that when he said that my brother
[1:15:28] and sister ever get it by experience and
[1:15:31] you won't be there nitpicking away at
[1:15:33] all of these little details because
[1:15:35] you'll know what he's talking about
[1:15:38] hallelujah
[1:15:40] amen was conceived in her so he's
[1:15:43] telling her there's something growing
[1:15:46] there is something coming to life this
[1:15:48] baby bump is not of man it is not of
[1:15:52] this or of that don't be afraid of this
[1:15:55] this is of the holy ghost and i can
[1:15:58] assure you the godhead was real to
[1:16:01] joseph and he said okay this is of god
[1:16:05] himself
[1:16:10] will have to happen right then saints
[1:16:13] faith kicked in
[1:16:16] he didn't stop and say i need it proven
[1:16:17] to me you need to be able to defend that
[1:16:19] statement i need more documentation but
[1:16:22] faith rose up in the right season and in
[1:16:25] this as i emphasized earlier in the
[1:16:27] latter times in the last age it will be
[1:16:30] the season as you need it faith kicks in
[1:16:34] and takes the halts of it and you're
[1:16:36] able to grab the word and say that's
[1:16:39] nothing but the truth
[1:16:41] amen it's not some theological approach
[1:16:44] to the word of god but it's a living
[1:16:46] word
[1:16:49] in us
[1:16:50] growing
[1:16:52] and coming forth to produce
[1:16:55] a seed amen
[1:17:00] shall bring forth a son
[1:17:03] now shall call his name jesus for he
[1:17:05] shall save his people from their sins
[1:17:07] now all of this is done that it might be
[1:17:09] fulfilled
[1:17:11] which was spoken
[1:17:14] of the lord
[1:17:16] and you know we literally could
[1:17:18] cut that off right there
[1:17:20] and it would not change the context
[1:17:23] are you with me
[1:17:25] you could completely cut that off but
[1:17:27] god gives clarity
[1:17:29] he said i spoke it
[1:17:31] come on give me a little liberty this
[1:17:33] morning okay i spoke it but i used a
[1:17:36] prophet to
[1:17:37] say it
[1:17:40] hallelujah
[1:17:42] hallelujah i'll tell you i get excited
[1:17:44] about it it was god that spoke the word
[1:17:46] for our hour but he used a prophet
[1:17:50] to say it
[1:17:52] hallelujah so whose word is it
[1:17:56] amen it's god's word hallelujah just
[1:17:59] because a man spoke it my brother and
[1:18:00] sister didn't make it his word
[1:18:03] hallelujah
[1:18:06] this was done right all of this now he's
[1:18:08] declaring that all of this was done that
[1:18:11] it might fulfill the word that was
[1:18:14] prophesied
[1:18:15] we go right back to isaiah we go back to
[1:18:18] zechariah all these different
[1:18:19] testimonies that have put everything in
[1:18:21] its right place through this scripture
[1:18:23] and realized it was god testifying in
[1:18:25] advance so that there would be a people
[1:18:28] that would be prepared now it's still
[1:18:30] shocking look it had to be shocking to
[1:18:32] mary
[1:18:34] and it had to equally be shocking to
[1:18:36] joseph
[1:18:37] but they've been prepared
[1:18:39] what had happened
[1:18:40] a foundation
[1:18:42] a foundation had been laid
[1:18:45] and so then something had started to
[1:18:47] build upon that foundation and when
[1:18:50] those words struck mary she says that's
[1:18:53] what this is about amen be it unto me
[1:18:56] when joseph heard this oh hallelujah my
[1:19:00] brother and sister when he heard this
[1:19:06] he didn't have to say give me time to
[1:19:07] study the scrolls
[1:19:11] give me time to figure this out
[1:19:14] now look at this
[1:19:17] behold this is the prophecy behold
[1:19:20] a virgin shall be with child
[1:19:23] she already is
[1:19:26] and shall bring forth a son
[1:19:28] they shall call his name emmanuel being
[1:19:30] interpreted
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:34] god with us not god in the universe
[1:19:37] not god down the street
[1:19:39] not god in the attic not god in the
[1:19:41] basement god with us
[1:19:48] oh my my oh my you know
[1:19:51] luke and then bring out other accounts
[1:19:52] and just for the sake of time we won't
[1:19:54] go into all of them some of them
[1:19:55] actually expressed it a little bit
[1:19:56] better i think luke actually expresses
[1:19:58] part of this better than matthew does
[1:20:01] then joseph being raised from sleep did
[1:20:04] as the angel had bidden him and took
[1:20:06] unto him his wife
[1:20:08] and knew her not till she had brought
[1:20:09] forth firstborn son and called his name
[1:20:11] jesus luke describes this that he got up
[1:20:15] and went and did
[1:20:16] what the angel told him to do
[1:20:20] come on are you with me saints i'm
[1:20:22] telling you it's about time for some of
[1:20:24] us to get out of our chair
[1:20:26] amen get up on our own two feet and go
[1:20:28] do what the angel told us to do
[1:20:31] amen not sit here and discuss where the
[1:20:33] comma ought to be or the semicolon ought
[1:20:36] to be or who has a right to and who
[1:20:38] don't have a right to but it's time to
[1:20:40] get up and go do what the angels said do
[1:20:44] hallelujah that's what this little bribe
[1:20:46] this is why these voices that are saying
[1:20:48] oh no the message is in such a mess you
[1:20:51] know they use those terms critics do
[1:20:53] mess
[1:20:54] edge
[1:20:56] mess of the age
[1:20:59] i'm like oh that's that's cute
[1:21:02] you must be standing looking in a mirror
[1:21:03] right now
[1:21:07] because i tell you what
[1:21:10] well
[1:21:11] i'll just skip ahead and remind you that
[1:21:13] i already spoke it
[1:21:16] joseph
[1:21:17] he does what god calls him to do
[1:21:20] he goes
[1:21:22] now look i don't mean to be crass
[1:21:24] but you put a man and a woman in the
[1:21:25] house
[1:21:27] there's going to be some hugging
[1:21:29] going to be some kissing
[1:21:31] but joseph had heard the word
[1:21:35] and he didn't touch her
[1:21:39] until the baby was born
[1:21:43] prophet of god said
[1:21:45] this ministry of this age
[1:21:48] would not man handle
[1:21:51] the word of god the bride of christ
[1:21:53] would not manhandle her
[1:21:56] amen until she has brought forth christ
[1:21:59] again he will keep his hands off of the
[1:22:02] people he will tell them this is what
[1:22:05] god said this is what we've been called
[1:22:07] to do let's rise up and do it at once
[1:22:10] but he's not going to go and manhandle
[1:22:13] her to bring forth his idea
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:18] so here he is
[1:22:20] he goes
[1:22:24] and he starts
[1:22:26] to set a stage
[1:22:32] and the moment he did it
[1:22:35] he started burying
[1:22:37] mary's shame
[1:22:40] not when the baby was born
[1:22:44] not when the baby was crucified
[1:22:48] but the minute
[1:22:51] it started to come forth in her
[1:22:55] and be made evident that something had
[1:22:57] changed
[1:22:59] joseph
[1:23:00] bore
[1:23:01] that shame
[1:23:03] can you imagine saints his friends
[1:23:06] coming
[1:23:07] joseph are you serious
[1:23:10] are you serious
[1:23:12] we understand biology we understand
[1:23:15] human nature joseph she's been with
[1:23:18] someone
[1:23:19] and you're still going to take her
[1:23:21] what's wrong with you joseph
[1:23:25] and joseph would say you don't
[1:23:26] understand i had a dream
[1:23:28] come on i want you to think about how
[1:23:29] real this would come across i had a
[1:23:31] dream
[1:23:33] we all dream joseph it don't mean it's
[1:23:35] real no you don't understand i had a
[1:23:37] dream and an angel told me
[1:23:39] that this is of god amen
[1:23:44] god don't work that way anymore joseph
[1:23:48] we're beyond that
[1:23:50] you need to went down and talked to the
[1:23:52] priest he's got it all written right
[1:23:53] there in the message
[1:23:58] you don't understand
[1:24:00] yeah we don't joseph you've lost your
[1:24:01] mind
[1:24:03] what are you thinking
[1:24:06] what are you thinking or are you so so
[1:24:09] caught up in her
[1:24:11] that that you're you're just
[1:24:16] but remember where joseph's already been
[1:24:18] saints that's it
[1:24:20] he's already been there
[1:24:22] pardon me for just taking this he's
[1:24:24] already been there
[1:24:28] okay mary
[1:24:30] tell it to me one more time
[1:24:36] you mean to tell me you were here you
[1:24:38] went there and you were walking back
[1:24:39] here and at this corner of the stone
[1:24:41] wall in the garden
[1:24:43] an angel met you
[1:24:46] and said as a virgin you're going to
[1:24:49] bring forth the son of god
[1:24:52] and it's of the whole
[1:24:56] oh mary
[1:24:59] oh mary
[1:25:03] i've read about it mary i've heard about
[1:25:06] it mary
[1:25:08] but
[1:25:09] it can't be us
[1:25:13] it can't be us we know it was prophesied
[1:25:16] mary but this is you and i
[1:25:20] and you should hear what they're already
[1:25:22] saying about you
[1:25:25] this is supposed to be the son of god
[1:25:27] it's going to be so glorious people are
[1:25:29] going to worship mary and they're
[1:25:31] calling you words i can't even repeat
[1:25:34] mary
[1:25:39] tell me one more time mary i just can't
[1:25:40] grasp it
[1:25:45] and mary telling him
[1:25:48] an angel
[1:25:50] joseph believe me
[1:25:52] it's i
[1:25:53] mary
[1:25:56] you're betrothed
[1:25:58] you're espoused
[1:26:00] i wouldn't lie to you i promised you
[1:26:03] joseph i've not been with any man
[1:26:09] and he's pondering he's thinking
[1:26:12] do you catch that saints did i fly over
[1:26:14] your head or do you catch that
[1:26:16] when i got growing in me
[1:26:19] i never got that seed amen from any man
[1:26:24] no man gave me this
[1:26:27] no man revealed what's growing inside of
[1:26:30] me
[1:26:31] no man did this to me
[1:26:33] this is of the holy ghost
[1:26:37] oh
[1:26:39] joseph he's pondering he's like oh here
[1:26:41] i know she's a real christian i know
[1:26:44] she's a real child of god i know she
[1:26:47] wouldn't lie to me oh god i can just
[1:26:50] hear his saints i don't mean to be
[1:26:51] presumptuous but i can just hear him in
[1:26:54] the midnight hour oh god
[1:26:57] oh jehovah
[1:26:59] what do i do
[1:27:05] and he falls asleep
[1:27:08] and he has a dream
[1:27:11] a dream that is so real saints
[1:27:15] that if you could ask him today he would
[1:27:17] tell you a certainty that angel
[1:27:20] was standing
[1:27:21] in my room amen
[1:27:26] come on
[1:27:28] oh my brother and sister
[1:27:31] look at this now
[1:27:34] he knows the girl story's almost too
[1:27:37] much
[1:27:41] and all of joseph's friends what's wrong
[1:27:42] with you
[1:27:44] you used to smoke
[1:27:45] used to drink used to dance used to drag
[1:27:48] race you used to this used to that
[1:27:50] well
[1:27:53] you're not going to believe this the
[1:27:54] holy ghost came
[1:27:57] come on saints god's real same yesterday
[1:27:59] today and forever the holy ghost came
[1:28:03] and he touched me
[1:28:05] hallelujah i don't have that desire any
[1:28:08] longer
[1:28:11] whoa what's happening
[1:28:16] surely joseph
[1:28:18] you don't believe that
[1:28:22] but faith had kicked in
[1:28:24] and joseph would have told you
[1:28:26] almost recounting it see people looking
[1:28:28] with a critical eye don't see it
[1:28:30] correctly
[1:28:31] they would be like
[1:28:33] well he told it before like it was a
[1:28:35] dream
[1:28:37] now he's telling it
[1:28:39] like it was
[1:28:41] alive like he was awake
[1:28:48] do you know you've done the same thing
[1:28:50] absolutely
[1:28:51] everyone that's ever received the holy
[1:28:53] ghost tells that story that way the holy
[1:28:56] ghost came to me met me in a little
[1:28:58] church met me here and as time goes on
[1:29:01] it wasn't he met me there
[1:29:03] he came
[1:29:05] into me amen amen
[1:29:08] it goes from impersonal to personal
[1:29:11] oh you say well you're changing the
[1:29:13] facts no
[1:29:14] we're coming to reality
[1:29:16] we're coming to the realization it's not
[1:29:19] us walking with jesus through our life
[1:29:22] amen it's us walking with him because he
[1:29:26] has become us and we have become him
[1:29:29] hallelujah
[1:29:31] oh thank you lord
[1:29:34] hallelujah
[1:29:36] and i want to reiterate this i kind of
[1:29:37] touched on it earlier
[1:29:39] it's one thing my brother and sister
[1:29:40] read scripture
[1:29:48] behold
[1:29:50] i send a prophet before my face i send a
[1:29:53] messenger before my face i i send a word
[1:29:56] to you before my face
[1:29:59] oh come on saints
[1:30:01] i hope you can grasp also that it's one
[1:30:03] thing to read the scripture
[1:30:05] it's one thing to hear this scripture
[1:30:07] to hear the prophecies
[1:30:10] but it's an entirely different thing to
[1:30:12] be there and watch
[1:30:14] it unfold
[1:30:18] it's unfolding around us
[1:30:22] oh praise the lord the prophet of god
[1:30:24] said the united states to be bankrupt
[1:30:26] we're seeing that prophecy come to pass
[1:30:29] that's good
[1:30:30] that's good
[1:30:32] what about the one
[1:30:34] that's prophesied
[1:30:36] that in the time of trouble
[1:30:38] the time of despair
[1:30:40] the time when your hope should be
[1:30:42] faltering
[1:30:43] that you'll just have enough faith
[1:30:46] to look up
[1:30:48] and be able to declare my redemption
[1:30:51] draweth nigh
[1:30:53] oh the world's like uh it's coming to
[1:30:55] chaos i love that song
[1:30:57] our young sisters thank you for singing
[1:30:59] that beautiful amen it's getting ugly
[1:31:02] it's getting dark there's all kinds of
[1:31:04] nonsense here but i'm not worried about
[1:31:06] it because this is not my home
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:10] so look we see prophecy come to pass
[1:31:13] don't worry about it god's just
[1:31:14] interpreting his word
[1:31:16] you have revelation to see what is
[1:31:18] happening amen
[1:31:20] oh hallelujah now look at this god chose
[1:31:23] to come in a dream to him but it still
[1:31:25] left him on through scripture go study
[1:31:27] it don't study it i'll preach it for you
[1:31:29] later
[1:31:30] but you see as time comes on now
[1:31:33] he's able this voice has become audible
[1:31:36] to him
[1:31:37] i want to leave you with this thought
[1:31:38] maybe you'll do a little studying on
[1:31:40] this this voice my brother and sister
[1:31:42] wasn't meant for us to look back back
[1:31:44] back back the voice was meant to be
[1:31:46] audible today tomorrow and every day
[1:31:50] after becoming an audible voice of god
[1:31:52] telling us come go stop turn right turn
[1:31:55] left speak an audible voice
[1:32:01] oh hallelujah
[1:32:04] my oh my
[1:32:05] now look i want to jump back does we
[1:32:07] don't need to go on the screen but just
[1:32:09] to remind you uh first peter 1 2 elect
[1:32:12] according to the foreknowledge of god
[1:32:14] the father
[1:32:16] is that not
[1:32:17] an incredible thing
[1:32:20] when you think about it
[1:32:22] elect according to the foreknowledge i
[1:32:25] don't have to convince god
[1:32:27] amen i don't have to convince you
[1:32:30] amen i have to rest on the fact that my
[1:32:34] god the holy ghost coming down
[1:32:39] speaking
[1:32:41] in an audible voice
[1:32:45] reminds me years ago at a setting at a
[1:32:47] place questions and answers
[1:32:50] now i felt really bad for the pastor
[1:32:52] because the person that brought this
[1:32:54] up's pastor was sitting right there
[1:32:58] brother paul
[1:33:04] if our pastor only preaches the basics
[1:33:06] of the message
[1:33:09] is it possible for us to have more
[1:33:11] revelation
[1:33:16] beam me up scotty
[1:33:24] but did you know that god has mysterious
[1:33:26] ways
[1:33:30] by god's grace the answer just starts
[1:33:32] coming out
[1:33:34] your own brain's like going well slow
[1:33:35] down here huh
[1:33:37] uh
[1:33:39] what it did is it ultimately caused the
[1:33:41] pastor there was no shame there there
[1:33:42] was no guile on behalf of the person
[1:33:44] asking the question and the pastor was
[1:33:47] like
[1:33:48] i need to get deeper
[1:33:51] i need to get deeper i i i'm supposed to
[1:33:54] be leading
[1:33:55] amen
[1:33:57] still they had a little reconciliation
[1:33:59] out there on the edge of a driveway and
[1:34:02] pastor walked away not feeling real
[1:34:04] happy probably
[1:34:06] but i'd stand on the answer i gave amen
[1:34:08] because it was the word amen it was the
[1:34:11] prophet's words and
[1:34:13] you see my brother and sister we we're
[1:34:15] not here just eat chicken soup the rest
[1:34:17] of our life amen
[1:34:19] we're eagles aren't we
[1:34:21] amen can the eagles show me their claws
[1:34:24] hallelujah
[1:34:25] amen we're made to grab the meat of the
[1:34:28] word
[1:34:30] hallelujah and i pray all the time lord
[1:34:31] help me be able to dig deeper i'm not a
[1:34:33] real deep preacher
[1:34:35] but i tell you i want i want to get in
[1:34:37] there i want to at least be able by
[1:34:39] example if not by words by example show
[1:34:43] you how to dig these claws into that me
[1:34:45] and take a bite out of it
[1:34:48] hallelujah
[1:34:50] oh
[1:34:51] yes
[1:34:53] amen
[1:34:56] but look at this i need to hurry along
[1:34:58] in this an incredible little revelation
[1:35:00] here
[1:35:03] joseph
[1:35:05] met an angel in a dream
[1:35:07] i'm just going to say he met an angel
[1:35:09] because i'm telling you this wasn't some
[1:35:10] vague fuzzy dream this was a very
[1:35:13] specific right down to it and so joseph
[1:35:16] meets an angel
[1:35:19] but joseph
[1:35:20] had to come to the revelation saints
[1:35:22] just like you and i
[1:35:24] he
[1:35:26] he named me
[1:35:28] he named me this is not them over there
[1:35:32] this is not maybe them down there this
[1:35:35] is not maybe a back east where there's
[1:35:38] way way more message believers so there
[1:35:40] must be way more anointing
[1:35:45] this is me
[1:35:46] joseph
[1:35:48] and i'm called
[1:35:50] to take mary
[1:35:52] get this
[1:35:54] to protect her
[1:35:57] god gave me a commission to protect mary
[1:36:00] god gave me a commission
[1:36:02] to love mary
[1:36:04] gave me a commission to
[1:36:06] feed mary and clothe mary
[1:36:10] are you following me
[1:36:15] yeah
[1:36:17] somebody's got to do it amen
[1:36:19] and when you catch the revelation god's
[1:36:21] talking to you and says somebody's going
[1:36:23] to be the overcomer of this age
[1:36:25] ah he's talking about
[1:36:29] me
[1:36:32] he's not talking about them
[1:36:33] he might be talking about them but he's
[1:36:35] talking about me
[1:36:38] oh come on my brother and sister i hope
[1:36:39] you catch this analogy of mary amen
[1:36:42] she's the one carrying the seed and i'm
[1:36:43] here today to feed protect provide for
[1:36:47] and and be with and you know what
[1:36:49] another thing god anointed him oh i'm
[1:36:51] getting excited here excuse me but
[1:36:53] another thing that was so incredible
[1:36:55] that reaches out of the word of god
[1:36:57] that god anointed joseph to look at mary
[1:37:01] and see no shame amen
[1:37:04] the world is looking down on that all
[1:37:07] they see is shame amen you're a cult
[1:37:11] you're this you're following a man
[1:37:13] well good i i sprung this on a
[1:37:16] gentleman's way back
[1:37:18] he's like wow you guys follow this and i
[1:37:19] was like yeah okay you're a baptist
[1:37:23] do you know your baptist history i know
[1:37:24] my baptist history perfectly
[1:37:26] who started the baptist church
[1:37:32] that's right
[1:37:33] a man did
[1:37:38] i seen a little quotation
[1:37:41] in a farm magazine
[1:37:47] everybody driving too slow
[1:37:51] is a
[1:37:54] and everyone driving too fast
[1:37:57] is an idiot
[1:38:02] i alone
[1:38:04] have the correct balance
[1:38:11] come on saints
[1:38:13] yeah
[1:38:15] idiot more on internet perfect
[1:38:18] idiot perfect
[1:38:22] let it come to the place look at this
[1:38:23] now joseph looked
[1:38:26] at the chosen of god
[1:38:30] and didn't see any hinder most parts
[1:38:39] god help us
[1:38:40] hallelujah it'll change our lives saints
[1:38:43] oh the devil's got it rooted down into
[1:38:45] us so deep we justify it well i'm not
[1:38:47] really criticizing brother trevor i'm
[1:38:48] just pointing out facts
[1:38:53] yeah
[1:38:55] the same facts
[1:38:57] that are facts about you
[1:39:02] yeah
[1:39:04] is that how it works
[1:39:05] come on
[1:39:07] come on saints
[1:39:09] yes sir oh we do all these things about
[1:39:11] yes you're pointing you got three back
[1:39:13] at you well as bad as most of you aim
[1:39:15] the three back wouldn't even hit you
[1:39:16] because in your own mind you're perfect
[1:39:22] and you didn't get your facts right in
[1:39:24] the first place so the one you were
[1:39:25] pointing out didn't hit the mark either
[1:39:29] come on but look what god did
[1:39:31] he put into joseph
[1:39:33] a spirit of subjection
[1:39:36] and when he looked at mary
[1:39:39] he saw
[1:39:40] himself
[1:39:43] and christ amen
[1:39:45] you see my brother and sister i i don't
[1:39:47] have enough time we'll stall
[1:39:49] you see as the scripture talks about the
[1:39:50] coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:39:53] right there in the natural sense right
[1:39:55] in in that kind of a
[1:39:57] what would be the right word for that it
[1:39:59] hadn't taken place but you see that
[1:40:01] natural event of the birth of christ was
[1:40:04] represented spiritually at the coming of
[1:40:06] christ amen so as the coming of christ
[1:40:09] the baby as they saw him it was there
[1:40:12] manifested now in the spiritual coming
[1:40:15] of christ that all things were made
[1:40:17] perfect the the atmosphere the stage and
[1:40:20] the right people to worship
[1:40:22] everyone was in their right position you
[1:40:24] see god don't make no mistakes
[1:40:26] god doesn't say well you know there's
[1:40:27] only a manger left well why because
[1:40:29] we're dealing with sheep
[1:40:31] amen if he wanted to deal with a
[1:40:32] hierarchy they'd have had a hilton
[1:40:35] we would have had a room reserved for
[1:40:36] him
[1:40:37] but god said nope i want to set the
[1:40:39] pattern and i'll keep the pattern i'll
[1:40:40] maintain the pattern because my pattern
[1:40:42] will never be broken
[1:40:45] oh hallelujah now let's god in his
[1:40:47] people
[1:40:48] this is a mystery to some people
[1:40:51] they question about whether god's even
[1:40:52] in his people and prophet of god even
[1:40:55] saw fit to name a sermon that
[1:40:57] my
[1:40:59] the holy ghost dispensation come in and
[1:41:01] continued on and will continue on by the
[1:41:03] administration of angels to the church
[1:41:06] truly
[1:41:07] but there are ordained spirits of god
[1:41:09] sent from god to carry the things out
[1:41:12] every man has a special calling back all
[1:41:15] through the ages angels has visited men
[1:41:18] not a worship of angels that's wrong
[1:41:20] like brigham young and so forth and like
[1:41:21] some people do but an angel of god will
[1:41:25] testify to the truth of god that's right
[1:41:28] and it'll declare god it won't have some
[1:41:31] kind of mythical something and no one
[1:41:34] understands it'll speak of jesus christ
[1:41:36] and testify of jesus christ and
[1:41:39] produce jesus christ
[1:41:42] to the people
[1:41:45] oh hallelujah i'm telling you there is
[1:41:48] some prophecy my brother and sister that
[1:41:50] was spoken for our day by an angel
[1:41:54] messenger of god that said there'll be a
[1:41:56] people on the earth at the coming of our
[1:41:59] lord jesus christ that will be
[1:42:01] worshiping him in spirit and in truth
[1:42:04] and they can't be deceived according to
[1:42:06] the word of god and that not being
[1:42:08] deceived is just not seeing whether it's
[1:42:11] right or wrong but knowing him
[1:42:14] in his personal relationship
[1:42:18] oh hallelujah
[1:42:20] hallelujah
[1:42:22] you know i want to share this just silly
[1:42:24] thing that people do you know so they're
[1:42:26] like okay we're going to see if we can
[1:42:27] fool a family they take a professional
[1:42:29] makeup artist they take a man that is of
[1:42:31] the same stature has the same walk and
[1:42:34] everything and he sits down in a chair
[1:42:36] and the makeup man takes this complete
[1:42:38] stranger that
[1:42:40] fits him more or less physically and
[1:42:41] they take him over and they they do all
[1:42:44] this makeup stuff even to making the
[1:42:47] right wrinkles in the back of the hands
[1:42:49] and everything complexion is just right
[1:42:51] and the man drives a car in the garage
[1:42:54] you know and gets out and goes in the
[1:42:56] house and they've studied they've
[1:42:58] studied
[1:43:03] they study these things why would you
[1:43:05] study these things
[1:43:08] it's the devil studying
[1:43:13] and he walks in the house puts his
[1:43:15] briefcase right on the corner of the
[1:43:16] counter where the real husband
[1:43:19] father does and goes in and goes over
[1:43:21] the refrigerator and gets him a soda the
[1:43:24] wife comes in gives her a hug tickles
[1:43:27] the kids on the head just right and the
[1:43:29] little boy walks up to him and goes
[1:43:31] where's daddy
[1:43:39] amen some of them are going to get
[1:43:41] fooled
[1:43:43] oh but if you come as a little child
[1:43:46] amen you come in the humbleness
[1:43:50] of the anointing of the word in our hour
[1:43:52] you're gonna look at that and say you're
[1:43:54] not my daddy
[1:43:55] and the rest of the story goes on the
[1:43:57] dog come running in the room stop start
[1:43:59] growling at him and the woman who's
[1:44:01] already hugged the man is like going
[1:44:02] what is going on here
[1:44:05] anyway she was quite embarrassed and
[1:44:07] then quite mad
[1:44:11] but this bride can't be deceived
[1:44:14] the devil can throw the briefcase down
[1:44:16] he might have the code to the garage he
[1:44:18] might throw his briefcase in the right
[1:44:19] spot know just what soda to get and no
[1:44:22] just right every move to make but this
[1:44:24] bride of christ is going to say you're
[1:44:25] not my husband
[1:44:27] amen and in fact i'll give you about 32
[1:44:29] seconds to get out of this house before
[1:44:31] i'll help you out of here
[1:44:33] amen my brother and sister god didn't
[1:44:36] say now you know you worry about being
[1:44:38] deceived you find me a spot in the
[1:44:39] scripture where it says you worry about
[1:44:41] being deceived i'll tell you you find a
[1:44:43] place in the word of god where it tells
[1:44:45] you if you eat the book and you become
[1:44:47] the book that there's nothing going to
[1:44:49] deceive you
[1:44:51] oh hallelujah
[1:44:52] amen so
[1:44:54] what happens here
[1:44:55] it won't have some kind of
[1:44:57] mythical something no one understands
[1:45:00] that's a good example of the trinity
[1:45:04] as they teach it
[1:45:05] we don't even understand it but
[1:45:08] you should just blindly follow us
[1:45:10] oh look a ditch
[1:45:14] it'll speak of jesus christ and testify
[1:45:16] of jesus christ and here's the thing my
[1:45:18] brother and sister
[1:45:20] now i don't want to go hash into things
[1:45:22] but i've had people look me in the face
[1:45:24] and say why do we have to manifest
[1:45:28] this message
[1:45:31] well mostly because my prophet told me
[1:45:33] to
[1:45:34] well no i let me take that back
[1:45:37] the word told me to
[1:45:39] god told me to
[1:45:41] the prophet just said the words
[1:45:44] hallelujah
[1:45:46] produce christ to the people in the
[1:45:48] people
[1:45:49] let me hurry i i kind of bungled that up
[1:45:51] but you you know what i'm talking about
[1:45:53] amen
[1:45:56] yeah
[1:45:58] oh my
[1:45:59] look at this
[1:46:00] sorry to dig in on things chris but look
[1:46:03] we have to have a foundation saints
[1:46:05] amen the foundation that was there for
[1:46:07] mary and joseph both
[1:46:10] was laid long before the angel came to
[1:46:13] them
[1:46:15] long before they were asked to manifest
[1:46:18] this prophecy of god the foundation had
[1:46:20] been laid and they could settle back on
[1:46:22] that foundation and everything fit amen
[1:46:26] hallelujah
[1:46:28] amen
[1:46:29] allowed him to seem that his dream mos i
[1:46:32] mean joseph to see that his dream was
[1:46:34] not just a dream
[1:46:36] not just not just you know indigestion
[1:46:38] or something like that
[1:46:40] but to see that it was real
[1:46:42] able to recognize the presence of god in
[1:46:45] his life and we'll study this out some
[1:46:46] more and if you want to study it
[1:46:48] obviously do go study it but you'll see
[1:46:50] that god speaks to joseph
[1:46:52] here here here he's sending him over
[1:46:54] here he's telling him stop go over here
[1:46:57] sends them from there to here sends them
[1:46:58] from here to here
[1:47:00] see joseph hardly gets any recognition
[1:47:03] isn't that interesting
[1:47:05] but as the head of his
[1:47:06] home come on
[1:47:09] come on i hope this comes out right i
[1:47:11] got too much humor in me this morning
[1:47:13] look
[1:47:14] if nothing more
[1:47:17] joseph
[1:47:18] had a hold of the lead rope
[1:47:21] of the donkey
[1:47:23] and he's walking mary went
[1:47:28] where joseph
[1:47:29] took her
[1:47:32] oh in times of trouble
[1:47:36] let it be
[1:47:37] let it be
[1:47:39] no i'm sorry
[1:47:42] mary
[1:47:43] is not some mythical
[1:47:46] thing
[1:47:47] the prophet of god said mary had to have
[1:47:48] the holy ghost
[1:47:50] mary had to have a prayer life
[1:47:53] she had to submit to the word
[1:47:55] and when she kept coming to jesus and
[1:47:58] trying to exert her point i'm your
[1:48:00] mother he would say who are
[1:48:02] you who are you i don't know who you are
[1:48:06] but yet on the cross dying i'm getting
[1:48:08] ahead of myself on the cross dying
[1:48:11] he points out yay
[1:48:13] your mother
[1:48:15] your son
[1:48:18] and by revelation
[1:48:20] he knew i'm going to take care of her
[1:48:23] not because she was
[1:48:24] the mystical
[1:48:27] mary
[1:48:30] because she was a widow
[1:48:32] a daughter of god
[1:48:35] you see saints what god's doing
[1:48:38] but joseph
[1:48:40] amen
[1:48:41] the holy ghost had joseph's lead rope
[1:48:45] that's how the home ought to be let me
[1:48:46] just say this in closing
[1:48:48] the holy ghost had joseph's lead rope
[1:48:51] and joseph had you might say mary's lead
[1:48:54] rope
[1:48:55] and so where the holy ghost took joseph
[1:48:57] joseph took mary and in those formative
[1:49:00] years as you might say because they
[1:49:01] truly were formative years god used them
[1:49:04] to form a character in jesus christ amen
[1:49:06] the man the flesh and so wherever the
[1:49:09] angel took joseph joseph took mary mary
[1:49:12] took jesus
[1:49:16] hallelujah
[1:49:19] are you with me
[1:49:21] oh
[1:49:22] hallelujah
[1:49:23] i was sure i wouldn't have enough to
[1:49:25] preach this morning
[1:49:29] okay
[1:49:31] in the message influence
[1:49:33] and we're just basically right here to
[1:49:35] be done
[1:49:36] in fact sister emmy if you'd come please
[1:49:39] and that's the way many times that's
[1:49:41] that's what i think has got the world
[1:49:42] today in such confusion
[1:49:44] men go out and try to take those places
[1:49:47] which they're not ordained to do
[1:49:49] it gets to a spot where they try to
[1:49:51] fulfill this office and they're not
[1:49:53] called for that place
[1:49:55] and i included that because i want you
[1:49:57] to understand this
[1:49:58] the events of the time the events of the
[1:50:01] season
[1:50:03] requires a certain individual
[1:50:05] joseph had to have the character except
[1:50:07] the words of the angel
[1:50:09] the character to accept mary shame
[1:50:12] to bear reproach
[1:50:14] to protect
[1:50:16] feed clothe
[1:50:20] oh
[1:50:22] jesus was
[1:50:24] jesus was jesus he was the messiah
[1:50:28] john 1 it was god in flesh
[1:50:31] let me tell you saints
[1:50:34] mary and joseph
[1:50:36] still did devotions
[1:50:38] they still read the word of god to their
[1:50:40] son
[1:50:41] they still prayed with him amen
[1:50:44] why
[1:50:45] because god chose
[1:50:47] that kind of people
[1:50:49] to fill the
[1:50:50] role oh he's going to be the messiah
[1:50:53] he's going to save the world we don't
[1:50:54] need to do anything we just sit back and
[1:50:56] watch it happen
[1:50:57] no i'll tell you what parents with that
[1:50:59] kind of a spirit on them
[1:51:01] are the ones that are often amazed why i
[1:51:03] can't understand
[1:51:05] why my child walked out of church one
[1:51:06] day has never come back
[1:51:09] it's because you never laid a foundation
[1:51:12] they had nothing to build on
[1:51:14] the storm started raging
[1:51:17] and everything they thought
[1:51:20] do you know that we have a crisis in
[1:51:21] america
[1:51:26] christian young men and young women are
[1:51:28] going to college
[1:51:31] running face to face
[1:51:34] with this whole
[1:51:35] intellectual
[1:51:37] explanation
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:40] and young christian individuals are
[1:51:42] falling like flies
[1:51:44] and coming home went to college
[1:51:46] believing in god coming home agnostics
[1:51:48] and whatever else
[1:51:50] why
[1:51:51] no foundation
[1:51:53] no foundation no personal experience
[1:51:57] no understanding that i was called
[1:52:02] to fulfill this
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:04] you know we don't see in scripture where
[1:52:06] somebody else showed up and said joseph
[1:52:08] you're in the wrong place i'm supposed
[1:52:09] to be mary's husband
[1:52:12] [Music]
[1:52:14] you know why noah did that
[1:52:17] well i personally believe i'm just one
[1:52:19] of those crazy guys i think mary must
[1:52:20] have been a very very pretty girl
[1:52:23] i just i just believe that don't ask me
[1:52:25] why i can't prove it i just don't think
[1:52:27] that
[1:52:28] you know god chose a broomstick i think
[1:52:30] that
[1:52:31] he he dwelt in a
[1:52:33] beautiful lady
[1:52:35] just leave me to my delusion
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:40] would have been as i said earlier many
[1:52:42] young men
[1:52:43] would no doubt have wanted ben mary's
[1:52:45] husband
[1:52:47] because of mary and her character
[1:52:49] but no one
[1:52:52] no one
[1:52:54] wanted to bear
[1:52:56] mary's shame
[1:52:58] and disgrace
[1:53:01] now look at this
[1:53:03] this jesus called christ
[1:53:05] the prophet of god said what are you
[1:53:06] going to do with him
[1:53:08] you see my brother and sister at a
[1:53:09] distance he's beautiful
[1:53:12] and everybody wants to be married to him
[1:53:15] seven women
[1:53:18] everyone wants to be married
[1:53:20] they don't want to bear the shame and
[1:53:22] reproach they want to share the
[1:53:24] prosperity and the beauty and the joy
[1:53:27] and all of this and all of that they
[1:53:29] don't want to bear
[1:53:30] the shame
[1:53:32] but you've got to bear the shame to
[1:53:34] receive the glory
[1:53:36] oh hallelujah
[1:53:39] hallelujah my let's stand up and sing a
[1:53:41] song or two
[1:53:43] amen
[1:53:44] you see
[1:53:46] each one of us got to have faith not
[1:53:48] just for a moment saints we got to have
[1:53:50] faith enough to play out our part
[1:53:52] now i don't mean to put anybody on the
[1:53:54] spot but do you want to have faith
[1:53:55] enough to play your part that god called
[1:53:57] you

[2:06:57] hide it so well we don't even realize
[2:07:00] it's fear
[2:07:01] we think it's something else but the
[2:07:04] holy ghost come and says i'll shine my
[2:07:06] light on it

[2:07:40] like oh lord please and she says you
[2:07:43] know i have all these issues in my life
[2:07:46] and she just bounced over the couple
