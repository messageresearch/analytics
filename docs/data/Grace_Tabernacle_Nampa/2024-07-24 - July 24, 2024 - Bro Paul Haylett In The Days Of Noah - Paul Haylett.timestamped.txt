[37:49] amen
[37:51] hallelujah I want to speak to you
[37:54] tonight I'll speak to you tonight on on
[37:57] the subject of scarecrows revealed in
[38:00] the scripture and um we'll see all down
[38:04] Through the Ages how that the word has
[38:07] always taken that negative spirit that
[38:11] that doubting that fear that anxiety and
[38:13] it's always exposed it and uh I say
[38:17] thank you Lord for that that by God's
[38:19] grace and mercy that we uh we don't have
[38:22] to live with that we don't have to uh uh
[38:25] spend all the days of our Liv struggling
[38:28] to to overcome but we can by God's grace
[38:32] was that not plugged in or
[38:34] there's oh well okay probably operator
[38:39] air you'll notice I walked out and sat
[38:41] down and went to scratched my ear and
[38:44] went huh where's the mic and I had to
[38:46] get up and go get the anyway that kind
[38:49] of evening amen this reminds us all
[38:52] we're very human amen so we look at this
[38:57] uh uh scarecrow is revealed in the
[39:00] scripture and uh so as we look at as it
[39:03] was in the days of Noah we know the
[39:05] scripture we'll just start off and take
[39:07] part of this in Genesis the 6th chapter
[39:10] and um we'll take this and and uh just I
[39:15] hope enjoy this evening to realize the
[39:18] the beauty of what God is is uh given to
[39:21] us revealed to us but it's not just
[39:24] revealed to us it's revealed in US and
[39:27] uh so we're sitting here today the word
[39:30] being manifested and you know it's
[39:32] interesting in in my studies I I look at
[39:35] a little different things maybe a little
[39:38] different way than some because we're
[39:39] all individual but my brother and sister
[39:42] lately I've been digging into um how how
[39:45] is how is the rest of the world looking
[39:48] at the word for the hour uh looking at
[39:50] the word concerning themselves in this
[39:53] hour and uh what they believe God will
[39:56] and won't do
[39:57] and um it's kind of startling remember I
[40:00] read the quote where brother Brown says
[40:02] now uh the man was saying why why do
[40:05] they send uh them to Seminary to destroy
[40:08] the gospel and um we truly that is just
[40:12] coming to pass more and more and more I
[40:15] uh um uh was um looking at a little deal
[40:20] and in that the state of Oklahoma has
[40:23] actually passed a rule a law if you
[40:26] would call it uh that they need to
[40:28] reintroduce the Bible back into their
[40:31] public schools and the public schools
[40:33] are saying we absolutely refuse we won't
[40:37] do it and
[40:39] then this will sound harsh forgive me
[40:42] but I'm just telling you like I saw it
[40:44] then they interviewed Jezebel who
[40:47] happened to be pastoring a church in the
[40:50] town of one of those big schools and
[40:52] she's there dangling earrings bright red
[40:56] lips dressed to the nines as they might
[40:58] refer to it and she's like well I agree
[41:02] we shouldn't put the Bible back in the
[41:03] school cuz we don't know what version
[41:07] and the versions have erors and until we
[41:10] can understand and go back into the old
[41:13] Hebrew and the aramic and and figure out
[41:16] where they made their mistakes we
[41:18] wouldn't know what to teach the
[41:22] children M the word is coming to pass
[41:27] it's coming to the place that they don't
[41:30] really
[41:32] want they don't really want to they want
[41:34] the form of godliness and they're going
[41:37] to deny the absolute power of it
[41:39] scripture is coming to pass and I didn't
[41:42] share that as negative connotation but I
[41:45] I believe we should be somewhat aware of
[41:46] the signs of the times of what's
[41:48] happening around us uh we we don't want
[41:51] to you know be the one that's just
[41:53] blindsided I had no idea these things
[41:56] were happening but we don't focus on
[41:58] that right we're focused on the revealed
[42:00] word of God and and what it's a how it's
[42:02] affecting us because we have a word that
[42:06] we know what it means we know we were
[42:08] called to manifest it and we're not
[42:10] sitting here is spending our lives
[42:12] imagine now some of you would do well to
[42:14] learn aramic and Hebrew Brother David is
[42:18] a perfect example of
[42:20] that what about poor
[42:24] Paul I I I wouldn't get off first bace
[42:28] does that mean I should just quit
[42:29] serving God now cuz I don't know no
[42:32] that's not what it's about amen Genesis
[42:35] 6 the starting with the fifth
[42:38] verse and God saw that the wickedness of
[42:41] man was great in the earth and that
[42:43] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[42:45] heart was only evil continually and it
[42:48] repented the Lord that he might that he
[42:51] made man on the earth and it grieved him
[42:54] at his heart and the Lord said I will
[42:56] destroy man man whom I have created from
[42:59] the face of the Earth both man and Beast
[43:01] and the creeping thing the fowls of the
[43:03] air for it repenteth me that I have made
[43:06] them but Noah now my brother and sister
[43:09] we can come right down in this
[43:12] 2024 21st century and you'll put your
[43:16] name right here in verse
[43:19] eight amen but Noah found Grace I'll
[43:22] give you a moment just to put your your
[43:24] name in there amen but no Noah found
[43:27] Grace in the eyes of the Lord and these
[43:30] are the generations of Noah Noah was a
[43:33] just man and perfect in his generations
[43:35] and Noah walked with God if we could
[43:39] just absolutely focus on that right
[43:42] there Noah was just our brother how many
[43:47] times did Brother brandham declare I'm
[43:49] just your
[43:50] brother amen Noah was just our brother
[43:55] but he finding Grace in the eyes of the
[43:58] Lord walked with God was perfect in his
[44:02] Generations we can be such we are such
[44:06] not can be we are such amen and Noah
[44:10] begat Three Sons sham ham and japheth
[44:13] and the Earth was also was corrupt
[44:16] before God and the Earth was filled with
[44:19] violence and God looked upon the Earth
[44:21] and behold it was corrupt for All Flesh
[44:24] had corrupted his way upon the Earth and
[44:27] God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh
[44:29] has come before me for the Earth is
[44:31] filled with violence through them and
[44:34] behold I will destroy them with the
[44:37] Earth make thee an ark of gopher wood
[44:40] and rooms shalt thou make in the ark and
[44:43] shall pitch it within and without with
[44:45] pitch and this is the fashion which Thou
[44:48] shalt make it of the length of the Ark
[44:51] shall be 300 cubits and the breadth of
[44:53] it 50 cubits and the height of it 30
[44:56] cubits a window shalt thou make to the
[44:59] ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it
[45:01] above and the door of the Ark shalt thou
[45:04] set in the side thereof with the lower
[45:06] second and third stories shalt thou make
[45:10] it Heavenly Father we ask you Lord just
[45:12] to come bless our time together tonight
[45:15] in the word Lord we thank you for the
[45:18] opportunity and by your grace and mercy
[45:20] Lord we will be able to thoroughly
[45:22] identify with Noah tonight Lord we thank
[45:26] you and your precious name amen you may
[45:29] be
[45:31] seated and as we look at this we'll see
[45:34] uh not to do away with uh these other
[45:37] scriptures but uh it is declaring that
[45:40] he going to bring a flood and it's going
[45:43] to destroy and in that he's going to
[45:45] establish a covenant and in that
[45:48] Covenant my brother and sister now you
[45:51] can say the Lord promised not to to uh
[45:54] flood the Earth in that fashion again
[45:56] but let's just realize when God makes a
[45:58] covenant or a promise he he doesn't have
[46:01] to come down and make it so specific
[46:04] when he said that uh I I have called you
[46:07] he didn't need to name our names because
[46:09] our names are already in him amen so
[46:12] it's a part of the word coming forth and
[46:15] so it's going to be that every beast and
[46:18] everything that would come and you know
[46:21] it's interesting because the
[46:23] naysayers and we would like to think
[46:25] it's just simply uh uh uh within the
[46:28] realm of the naysayers but when you
[46:31] think about the size of the Ark and you
[46:33] think about all the animals there was
[46:36] something Supernatural took place at the
[46:39] ark amen it wasn't simply let's let's
[46:43] take dimensions and figure out uh Mast
[46:46] displaced and and there's no way you can
[46:48] fit it all inside the ark my brother and
[46:50] sister but when you serve a supernatural
[46:52] God and he says this is what I want it
[46:55] to be and you are going to all the
[46:57] animals and the animals are going to
[46:58] come and them animals walk through the
[47:00] door something Supernatural took place
[47:03] in every single one of those now if we
[47:06] have a God that can create Heaven and
[47:09] Earth he can fit the animals in an ark
[47:13] amen hallelujah cuz the greater mystery
[47:16] would be how that this planet hung in
[47:18] space can rotate and and all the mass
[47:22] and motion and everything so perfectly
[47:25] is much greater than the fact of how the
[47:28] animals fit in the ark amen but what we
[47:31] want to focus here just for a few
[47:33] minutes tonight is the fact that the
[47:36] Earth was corrupt before God and it was
[47:39] filled with violence it certainly sounds
[47:41] like the Earth today it sounds like a
[47:45] perfect uh picture uh of the day that
[47:48] we're looking and uh it was corrupt All
[47:51] Flesh was corrupted uh in his way on the
[47:54] earth and you know as it is God is is
[47:57] showing or speaking to Noah and uh we
[48:00] see how that uh Noah then starts he he
[48:04] proceeds forward he has a few doubts he
[48:06] has a little anxiety you know God's
[48:09] choice uh uh of uh the wood and
[48:12] everything in the hindsight Looks So
[48:15] Perfect up front it looked like a very
[48:18] poor choice of a wood that was so soft a
[48:21] wood that was so porous that water would
[48:23] flow right through it but God oh I hope
[48:26] you catch this God knows how to seal
[48:29] amen he knows how to seal he he doesn't
[48:32] have to worry about the sealing of it
[48:35] amen and when he come right down in this
[48:37] day amen they were worried about a
[48:39] little water but today we're worried
[48:41] about the spirits of the age and all of
[48:44] the things the schemes of Satan and God
[48:47] comes down says I know exactly what I
[48:49] have done because I know how to seal
[48:51] that I know how to make that to where
[48:53] they become as it were impervious to the
[48:56] world are we influenced my brother and
[48:58] sister we're influenced I I don't think
[49:00] any one of us could deny that we've had
[49:02] times of anxiety and times that maybe we
[49:05] woke up in the middle of the night and
[49:07] didn't go back to sleep because our mind
[49:09] is racing about how to deal with this
[49:11] and do this and do this and and trouble
[49:13] in the land and all of these things but
[49:16] I tell you one thing that we can stand
[49:18] solid on when God said I sealed you
[49:20] you're sealed amen we don't have to
[49:23] worry about whether this boat will float
[49:26] amen because he has sealed us amen now
[49:29] let's look at Noah for just a few
[49:31] minutes we know that Noah was a devout
[49:33] man we know that God would uh uh take
[49:37] him and use him in the way that God
[49:39] would because he had prepared Noah to be
[49:42] the man of the hour the man that he
[49:44] called to fulfill that he didn't he
[49:46] didn't just say look there's nobody in
[49:48] the land that that I can use there's no
[49:51] one who can fulfill this position so I
[49:54] guess I will settle for a second second
[49:57] best and I would like you just ponder
[49:59] that and apply it to your own life
[50:01] tonight God did not settle for a second
[50:03] best when he called his bride in this
[50:06] age amen he didn't say well I guess
[50:08] there's not the ones I really would like
[50:10] to you know call the ones that were
[50:12] really smart the ones that were really
[50:14] this or really that but God said I know
[50:17] exactly what I'm choosing and I will
[50:19] seal that vessel and it will take that
[50:22] soul to the other side amen I say thank
[50:25] you Lord am amen so a a devout man he
[50:29] applied the word now I I can speak with
[50:32] Liberty on this my brother and sister
[50:34] because uh God doesn't have two
[50:37] standards or three standards or four
[50:39] standards a standard for my I you know
[50:43] some of us would brother Trevor would
[50:44] just flunk out all the way the standard
[50:46] for the good-look standard for the smart
[50:48] good for the rich or you know for the
[50:50] what he he doesn't have a bunch of
[50:52] standard he's got one standard and he
[50:54] knows that we have the ability he put
[50:57] the ability in us to meet that standard
[51:01] amen so he he doesn't have to do it and
[51:03] that's why we should just kick away
[51:05] every excuse that we use that I'm not
[51:08] good enough I'm not spiritual enough I'm
[51:10] not smart enough I'm not whatever
[51:12] because God knew exactly what he was
[51:14] using cuz he didn't want to seal you
[51:16] with your flesh he wanted to seal you
[51:18] with his holy spirit amen he didn't want
[51:21] to seal uh seal the uh that uh sham wood
[51:25] or that gopher wood he didn't want to
[51:27] seal that with with something like you
[51:29] know Oak that swole up and so tight it
[51:32] wouldn't leak because it was a big storm
[51:34] my brother and sister there was a
[51:36] scientist did a little research
[51:38] considering those things and he he said
[51:41] I'm not making a point of this but by
[51:43] studying this engineering wise he said
[51:46] there may well have been waves 200 feet
[51:49] tall on the ocean on the sea when the
[51:52] ark was was there it wasn't just some
[51:55] little gentle ride it was a a wild ride
[51:58] a a great tumultous time and he wanted
[52:01] something amen that was flexible but
[52:04] sealed amen oh
[52:10] my Noah had applied the token amen no
[52:14] way short of
[52:16] it if God allowed Noah to get by not
[52:19] applying the token he would have to
[52:20] allow you and I to get by without
[52:22] applying the token so we know that no
[52:26] Noah had applied the token we know that
[52:30] the word was centermost of of their home
[52:34] and um they were living it he was living
[52:36] it amen God didn't come down and settle
[52:39] for second best and so you know as it is
[52:43] I can just see Noah I preached on Noah
[52:46] the brother the man you know just uh the
[52:49] whole thing before God anointed us to
[52:52] speak on that times past and you know he
[52:55] got up in the morning and you know maybe
[52:58] he was going down the street and a man
[53:00] who had been a scoffer had come along
[53:02] and now his wife or his child is sick
[53:04] and where he used to think Noah was just
[53:07] this overly religious man he's now in a
[53:09] state of desperation and Noah would you
[53:11] pray for my wife or my child Noah goes
[53:14] in lays hands on him prays for him and
[53:17] God comes on this scene but how many
[53:19] times did we see in the prophet's
[53:21] Ministry people come through the prayer
[53:23] line and they come there and pray for
[53:26] them and they are healed and they went
[53:28] out and never once looked back to the
[53:32] word they got what they wanted and they
[53:35] just moved on so you know that might
[53:38] have been the same effect I believe it
[53:40] would be he was testifying of the things
[53:43] of God to friends and to family because
[53:46] you see he was called to be the living
[53:48] Epistle of his day he was called to be
[53:51] Christ on display he was called to be
[53:53] the one that they would not be able to
[53:56] deny that they had been warned and they
[53:59] had seen Christ moving amen seen God
[54:02] moving whatever words you want to use uh
[54:05] in their midst they can't deny it it was
[54:08] real it was alive and they heard it what
[54:11] God was doing and you know uh just uh
[54:14] not to make too long a scenario but Noah
[54:17] it become very obvious brother Noah was
[54:20] not just a churchgoer there was
[54:22] something taking place in his life and
[54:25] this is all my brother and sister before
[54:27] God comes and says I want you to preach
[54:29] a
[54:33] message this is this is everyday life
[54:37] this is not just a special moment for a
[54:40] moment but it's him being called to that
[54:43] you see as the prophet has told us Noah
[54:47] was the word for that hour and we are
[54:51] here amen the spirit and the bride say
[54:55] come the bride has a Ministry has a
[54:57] voice she's alive she's speaking and
[55:00] it's real it's not just a serade it's
[55:03] not just a story it's real amen she's
[55:06] speaking in this generation in this time
[55:09] and as they would look at Noah they
[55:11] would be saying you know old Noah just
[55:13] used to go to church just like us he
[55:15] wasn't any different than us but
[55:17] something's changing with Noah and some
[55:20] would Marvel and some would scoff but it
[55:23] doesn't matter that's exactly what God
[55:25] was calling
[55:27] amen and I want to ask you this question
[55:29] does God change his
[55:31] pattern God does not change his word
[55:34] amen and I can say today praise the Lord
[55:37] he doesn't change cuz if he could change
[55:39] he could decide tomorrow it was
[55:42] mentioned right in the song service from
[55:44] before the foundation of the world if he
[55:46] could
[55:47] change we have no Assurance we'd wake up
[55:50] tomorrow morning and we were still
[55:52] called from the foundation of the world
[55:55] Amen God bless you Sister
[55:58] Carrie you see if if it was changeable
[56:02] we'd have no security at all we we would
[56:05] walk around the most nervous people we'd
[56:07] have a bad thought or a bad attitude and
[56:09] we'd be oh it's all over and we'd quit
[56:12] but we have a word in this hour that
[56:14] says when God called you he has prepared
[56:19] you and he will finish this work in you
[56:22] and there's no other alternative for us
[56:24] to stand on amen we know where we stand
[56:28] today now the Marvel that I find so
[56:31] wonderful about this and and here again
[56:34] I don't mean to sound critical but the
[56:35] world said oh no no there's a new
[56:37] covenant and it's all by Grace now so I
[56:40] can live however I want to and God's
[56:43] going to understand but I'm telling you
[56:45] my brother and sister the bride under
[56:47] the anointed word she's living and she
[56:50] makes a mistake and she knows what to do
[56:54] and she knows that God has placed the
[56:57] word in her and what does she do as the
[56:59] prophet of God said when you do wrong
[57:01] and the Holy Spirit speaks to you you
[57:04] stop right there and you make it
[57:07] right and then when we don't it's the
[57:10] devil that's there trying to keep you
[57:12] give you an
[57:13] excuse well they deserved it they
[57:17] started it it's their fault that's not
[57:21] what the prophet said he said the Holy
[57:22] Spirit speaks to you you go take care of
[57:25] that there is a separation line between
[57:28] the anointing on the denominational
[57:31] spirit and anointing on the bride spirit
[57:34] is the bride wants to be right at the
[57:36] moment she doesn't want Grace Grace
[57:38] Grace right off to fall off into
[57:40] disgrace so she's there and we see that
[57:43] Noah was living this word before those
[57:46] people in that hour and
[57:49] then God comes along and says no I've
[57:53] got a message I want you to speak
[57:56] they already maybe thought he was pretty
[58:00] zealous but something changes and Noah
[58:02] stands out amongst his brother amongst
[58:04] his friends the fellow church
[58:08] members God spoke to
[58:11] me you know in this day and
[58:14] age pardon me when I tell you sometimes
[58:17] I look very far and wide in my studies I
[58:20] I'm I'm serious I look far and wide do
[58:23] you know in this day and age God speaks
[58:25] to everybody
[58:31] I was looking at a deal this guy became
[58:33] a pastor of a church after he had an
[58:35] affair with the church secretary and
[58:37] divorced his wife and then he got
[58:39] married the the secretary and then they
[58:41] got along and this went this way and
[58:42] then they voted him in as the
[58:46] pastor cuz God told him
[58:49] to that's not the god of our
[58:53] Bible the prophet would no wonder they
[58:55] thought he was harsh he said that's the
[58:57] God of this evil
[58:58] age you you've got the you've got the
[59:01] gods mixed
[59:02] up and so it's there that we see how
[59:05] it's introduced to them and all of a
[59:07] sudden people that they used to sit down
[59:09] at the barbecue with are like you know
[59:13] Noah is going too
[59:16] far he now thinks that God told him it's
[59:21] going to
[59:23] rain I'm wondering if we should ask ask
[59:26] a doctor to get him
[59:29] evaluated but they didn't know really
[59:32] what to do because it was a
[59:34] supernatural element that came with
[59:37] Noah's ministry right amen have we seen
[59:41] a prophet with a supernatural element
[59:43] amen God does not change his ways my
[59:45] brother and sister so here is Noah with
[59:48] a supernatural element but he is now
[59:52] speaking things they can't hardly
[59:54] comprehend amen and so as it is that
[59:58] he's he's in this position of really
[1:00:00] honestly a living epistle before these
[1:00:03] people they can't really put a fault to
[1:00:05] his life he is a righteous man a holy
[1:00:08] man he's a caring man a praying man and
[1:00:11] they can't put a finger to his life but
[1:00:13] you know as God is speaking to him and
[1:00:15] says I've got a message for you go and
[1:00:18] preach it amen there was a change in
[1:00:21] Noah yes sir Noah didn't say I think
[1:00:23] I'll go change God's speaking to me I'll
[1:00:25] just change no the word the word himself
[1:00:29] speaking to Noah started to change him
[1:00:32] oh Hallelujah can somebody say thank you
[1:00:35] Lord when you spoke to me Lord it
[1:00:37] started to change my life I'm not who I
[1:00:40] used to be amen I don't even want to
[1:00:43] look back to what I used to be I want to
[1:00:46] be what the word says I am amen and so
[1:00:50] it's it's there this change taking place
[1:00:53] in Noah now my brother and sister let me
[1:00:55] put it to you this way people like
[1:00:58] religion until it interferes with their
[1:01:01] life and at that point they have a hard
[1:01:04] time dealing with
[1:01:08] religion now let's just be honest with
[1:01:10] ourselves there's been times since we
[1:01:12] come to the word that the
[1:01:16] word has cut
[1:01:19] us and we have said I don't like
[1:01:23] that but there was something inside of
[1:01:26] you that says that wasn't the preacher
[1:01:30] that wasn't this person that wasn't
[1:01:32] husband or wife it wasn't me that's
[1:01:37] right Supernatural
[1:01:39] element coming down now remember the
[1:01:42] quote we read to the other day brother
[1:01:44] Brown says they only put the Scarecrow
[1:01:46] up where the good fruit is amen so you
[1:01:49] can see now that here is Noah and the
[1:01:53] scarecrows start popping up Noah went
[1:01:56] too far he got into that reading his
[1:01:58] Bible and doing this stuff and praying
[1:02:01] way too much and he slipped over the
[1:02:03] edge if he had just settled down with
[1:02:05] going to
[1:02:07] church he already was on this board or
[1:02:10] that board or whatever if he to just
[1:02:12] been happy there but he went too far he
[1:02:15] got in too much he he thought God
[1:02:17] actually talked to him God doesn't talk
[1:02:20] to humans
[1:02:26] let's just settle for just a little
[1:02:28] religion amen we want to do that tonight
[1:02:31] if we were settling for a little bit of
[1:02:33] religion right now we could actually
[1:02:35] dismiss right now and we could meet at
[1:02:37] Dairy
[1:02:38] Queen and many would be satisfied with
[1:02:42] that oh it was good what did they preach
[1:02:46] on well I don't know I spent most of the
[1:02:48] time you know whatever but it was good
[1:02:53] so Noah becoming a Fanatic in the eyes
[1:02:55] of the people
[1:02:56] people they're starting to see something
[1:02:58] strange about his
[1:03:00] behavior and Noah is speaking to them
[1:03:03] and it is such an incredible message
[1:03:05] that Noah is speaking that the people
[1:03:07] cannot comprehend it they're like what
[1:03:10] what are you talking about God is
[1:03:12] speaking to you God is revealing to you
[1:03:14] God's gave you a personal message to
[1:03:17] give to us why didn't he speak to us
[1:03:19] we're just as spiritual as you are
[1:03:23] Noah and it comes down that they're
[1:03:26] looking at this and as he becomes a
[1:03:28] Fanatic in the eyes of the people so
[1:03:30] many people pull back we don't want to
[1:03:33] get caught up in
[1:03:34] fanaticism now I hope this doesn't
[1:03:36] offend anybody me putting it this way
[1:03:39] but when you hear people say well I'm
[1:03:41] afraid in this message I'm afraid of
[1:03:44] being deceived they're already
[1:03:47] deceived they have not come to the place
[1:03:49] to know who they are in Jesus Christ
[1:03:53] they're wavering on the boundary they've
[1:03:55] got religion not the Holy Ghost because
[1:03:59] when God speaks to you speaks to me
[1:04:02] speaks to us let's do it Collective
[1:04:05] speaks to us he gives us an assurance of
[1:04:08] who we are we're not going to go 20 30
[1:04:12] 40 years looking for a Rapture the whole
[1:04:15] time am I saved or not am I saved or not
[1:04:17] is the message true or not my brother
[1:04:19] and sister you don't have to go far out
[1:04:21] here in denomination to see the nonsense
[1:04:24] that's invaded the churches amen I I'm
[1:04:28] sorry I shouldn't even say some of this
[1:04:29] over the pulpit so maybe I should
[1:04:31] restrain myself but when you have people
[1:04:33] who can't even figure out their natural
[1:04:36] human identity teaching your children
[1:04:39] what they are they AR teaching them
[1:04:41] their sons and daughters of God they're
[1:04:43] teaching them pronouns amen what is it
[1:04:46] that Satan has come right down in the
[1:04:48] church and they hang the colors and they
[1:04:51] do all of this and they quote whatever I
[1:04:55] can't remember remember the guy's name
[1:04:56] probably he's good don't need to
[1:04:57] advertise him they quote that as much as
[1:05:00] they quote the scripture but when they
[1:05:02] quote the scripture they'll put a little
[1:05:03] addendum on there and we're not sure
[1:05:05] this is correct that's
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:10] right no his message was so incredible
[1:05:13] they're like this can't be
[1:05:16] true this just this can't be true we
[1:05:19] have
[1:05:21] history we have history going
[1:05:24] back that was in the old days now it
[1:05:28] seems kind of different for us right be
[1:05:30] talking about Noah and the old days when
[1:05:34] we would be looking back but isn't that
[1:05:37] the truth of the age oh God did that
[1:05:39] back
[1:05:41] then he doesn't do that
[1:05:44] now remember the spirits never die
[1:05:47] they've just morphed from age to age to
[1:05:49] age and so he's got this incredible
[1:05:52] message how God come spoke to him and it
[1:05:55] stunned the people now my brother and
[1:05:58] sister when you look at this as you
[1:06:00] study and you listen to the prophet
[1:06:02] you'll see my brother and sister that
[1:06:04] there were many people that shouted I I
[1:06:07] have little documentations here and
[1:06:09] there people that sit on the platform
[1:06:10] and brother bram's meeting and amen and
[1:06:13] walked out the door and criticized
[1:06:19] him come on the spirit doesn't
[1:06:23] change and when they went out and
[1:06:25] criticized look think about it wasn't
[1:06:27] that uh help me Brother David which one
[1:06:30] of was those meetings where brother
[1:06:31] Brown said now you guys talked about
[1:06:33] this in the back room and you and you
[1:06:34] and you were there Chicago that's what I
[1:06:37] first wanted to say but then I was
[1:06:38] thinking was that De Moine but you look
[1:06:40] at that my brother and sister see these
[1:06:41] men sat there and shouted under the
[1:06:44] anointing of the Holy Spirit and then
[1:06:46] they went out and cut brother Bram to
[1:06:50] shreds and brother Brenham just was
[1:06:53] there and he knew it
[1:06:56] that's one thing remarkable we'd
[1:06:57] probably most of us have to say look you
[1:07:00] lion cheating person brother Brown
[1:07:02] called him brother that's
[1:07:04] right because he knew what the word was
[1:07:08] and I say this a little direct he knew
[1:07:11] what they were
[1:07:15] amen imagine Jesus is there in the
[1:07:20] temple right in front of the religious
[1:07:24] leaders and they
[1:07:26] said you're
[1:07:30] be the greatest gift given to mankind is
[1:07:34] standing in their presence their
[1:07:36] discernment says you're be
[1:07:39] elub and you know it comes along I I
[1:07:43] just believe this firmly because the
[1:07:45] types I believe follow through Noah is
[1:07:47] there it got to a point they started to
[1:07:49] say you know what you've got an evil
[1:07:51] spirit on you you're deceiving the
[1:07:53] people trying to get them into your
[1:07:55] church this this Arc church that's it
[1:08:00] they you're you're trying to get them to
[1:08:01] join your group and then you're going to
[1:08:03] like hold them captive because you got a
[1:08:05] door on that
[1:08:10] place right so it's it's coming closer
[1:08:14] time is going on Noah never got
[1:08:17] discouraged Noah never questioned Noah
[1:08:19] I'm sorry my brother and sister it don't
[1:08:21] hold the type he was human and there had
[1:08:23] to be days that Noah was like Lord
[1:08:26] is I'm not sure I understood you am I
[1:08:29] doing this right come on aren't we human
[1:08:31] that's right Lord and I'm not talking
[1:08:33] about unbelief like Lord you're you're
[1:08:35] just messing with me no the days when
[1:08:38] when the masses come on we are humans my
[1:08:41] brother and sister you know if you're
[1:08:43] walking now I'm not saying this fits
[1:08:44] everyone you're walking through the
[1:08:46] woods just on a casual walk not hunting
[1:08:48] not trying to get away from every you're
[1:08:49] just on a walk it's human nature that we
[1:08:52] come to a a a a split in the trail
[1:08:56] and that one's just got a few footprints
[1:08:58] on
[1:08:59] it and we tend to follow the one that
[1:09:02] the masses have walked is that what
[1:09:06] we're
[1:09:10] doing I trust we're
[1:09:13] not you see the masses my brother and
[1:09:15] sister said Jesus was be
[1:09:18] elob the masses listened to the high
[1:09:21] priest and said this can't be true Our
[1:09:24] Father
[1:09:26] s they
[1:09:28] know and so it becomes a group a voice
[1:09:32] raising up Noah stop your preaching Noah
[1:09:37] be quiet you want to build an ark go
[1:09:39] build it around the corner out of sight
[1:09:42] but leave the people alone because
[1:09:44] you're confusing them and Noah he was
[1:09:48] following One Voice amen amen not the
[1:09:51] multitude of voices not a dozen voices
[1:09:54] not a group there
[1:09:56] he was there God told me to preach this
[1:09:59] message whether it's accepted or not and
[1:10:02] I I'm just sorry I just have to put it
[1:10:04] this way and we've all studied this and
[1:10:07] we've documented this and we all are in
[1:10:10] agreement he went off in the end who's
[1:10:15] we
[1:10:17] all who's the
[1:10:24] group I don't recommend you do this but
[1:10:26] I'll just State this as a fact to you a
[1:10:28] lot of research and people writing about
[1:10:30] brother brandham today quote the same
[1:10:35] resources over and over and over
[1:10:39] again in
[1:10:43] fact you won't go in the
[1:10:46] Rapture unless you accept brandom's
[1:10:52] teaching hope that doesn't shock you all
[1:10:57] not going in the Rapture unless you
[1:10:59] accept and I don't say this to
[1:11:01] disrespect but I'm saying what they say
[1:11:04] unless you accept brandom's
[1:11:07] teaching my goodness my goodness if they
[1:11:11] would ever pick this book up and they
[1:11:13] would ever say Lord open this book to me
[1:11:17] they would have to change that you're
[1:11:19] not going in the Rapture until you
[1:11:22] believe Jesus is teaching right God's
[1:11:25] teaching the holy spirit's teaching but
[1:11:28] they're quoting I hope you follow me
[1:11:30] here they're quoting the same reference
[1:11:33] over and over and over and over again
[1:11:36] and saying they must know they speak
[1:11:38] five languages they have LLS inde DED
[1:11:41] this and that and whatever and you know
[1:11:43] that's what we need to do so we're going
[1:11:45] to quote them and they're
[1:11:47] wrong those people were right there with
[1:11:50] Noah Noah is right there being battered
[1:11:53] with this and their many Ministry of the
[1:11:55] masses was so effective it come right
[1:11:59] down to just a little group now
[1:12:03] scripturally you can see it was Noah's
[1:12:05] family but we can enlarge that to
[1:12:06] realize what family we all belong to
[1:12:09] amen so it's there that that that
[1:12:11] Ministry anti- message Ministry was so
[1:12:15] effective that it just whittel the
[1:12:17] people one at a time Noah you know we've
[1:12:19] been friends I trust you with my life
[1:12:21] but this has went too far there's just
[1:12:23] no way it's going to rain amen I got a
[1:12:25] quote here I need to hurry along but you
[1:12:27] know brother Brown speaks about this
[1:12:29] we've already shot the instruments into
[1:12:32] space there's not enough moisture out
[1:12:35] there for it to
[1:12:39] rain you're wrong
[1:12:41] Noah and we have the science to prove
[1:12:48] it they had incredible doubt and they
[1:12:51] were anointed to dispute there's a push
[1:12:53] back
[1:12:55] you know it's hard to imagine when
[1:12:56] you're a
[1:12:58] Believer it's hard to imagine people
[1:13:00] anointed to disbelieve as much as you're
[1:13:03] anointed to
[1:13:04] belief I mean we come can't you see this
[1:13:07] here it is in the word but they're
[1:13:10] anointed and you're a supernatural
[1:13:12] anointed individual to take a hold of
[1:13:15] that word and there as a prophet of
[1:13:17] God's talking about reading between the
[1:13:19] lines that's not to become a
[1:13:21] professional oh there's got to be
[1:13:22] something right here something right
[1:13:24] here no that's when the word speaks to
[1:13:26] you and says this is connected to this
[1:13:29] and this is connected to this and this
[1:13:31] is connected to this and this is where
[1:13:33] it comes together and it takes a
[1:13:35] supernatural anointing to receive that
[1:13:37] and you did amen what does that tell you
[1:13:39] it means there's a supernatural
[1:13:41] anointing on your life amen and so as
[1:13:45] these these voices you know the doubts
[1:13:48] start to rise and they're able to put
[1:13:50] pieces
[1:13:52] together and then they get a spirit to
[1:13:56] dispute my brother and sister I don't
[1:13:58] want to dispute with anybody else I
[1:14:01] actually just want to live what God
[1:14:04] called me to live and you live what you
[1:14:07] were called to
[1:14:08] live and as brother George Smith says
[1:14:11] we'll meet you in the
[1:14:13] end that's really where I'm at but you
[1:14:16] see there's an anointing to
[1:14:20] dispute there's anointing to argue
[1:14:24] anointing to
[1:14:26] misconstrue the word of God that's right
[1:14:30] remember we went through that about
[1:14:31] misplacing
[1:14:32] misconstruing twisting it they're
[1:14:35] anointed to twist it to end up
[1:14:40] winning but they're losing while they're
[1:14:44] winning
[1:14:47] my oh how many
[1:14:50] voices how many voices Noah you're a
[1:14:54] false prophet
[1:14:56] it's not going to happen
[1:14:58] Noah and some never did their own
[1:15:01] research isn't it strange how that
[1:15:02] Spirit comes down well so and so
[1:15:07] said really did so and so study it till
[1:15:11] they hadn't well
[1:15:13] no this individual told them and where
[1:15:18] did they get
[1:15:20] it did they exhaustively study the word
[1:15:24] no this person told them and it gets
[1:15:27] down here and we can make a footnote in
[1:15:29] a book and say our reference point that
[1:15:31] he went off in the end is this person
[1:15:35] who never once had a personal
[1:15:39] relationship oh I was talking about
[1:15:41] Noah's day was there a
[1:15:44] similarity okay okay I just want to make
[1:15:46] sure you guys knew I was talking about
[1:15:48] Noah's day amen strange how that all
[1:15:51] comes down isn't it that it just fits so
[1:15:53] perfect through the scripture
[1:15:56] just
[1:15:57] comes and you know what every one of
[1:15:59] these had in
[1:16:01] common they were a scarecrow amen every
[1:16:05] one of them had an influence to cause
[1:16:08] someone to
[1:16:10] quit and if they didn't quit did you
[1:16:14] know that you can become so
[1:16:17] paralyzed that your body will not react
[1:16:20] so paralyzed that your thoughts congeal
[1:16:27] reminds me a little story I don't say
[1:16:29] this just for the deal but this this man
[1:16:33] had had been out
[1:16:35] hunting and when he come back he was all
[1:16:39] agitated all sweaty just All Shook Up
[1:16:42] and they're like what happened and he
[1:16:44] said I was out there on the trail and
[1:16:47] this Giant mountain lion jumped out in
[1:16:49] the trail in front of me and I emptied
[1:16:52] my rifle I fired every shell at him and
[1:16:55] then he ran off I I don't know he has to
[1:16:58] be wounded which means he'll probably
[1:17:00] you know attack somebody and they said
[1:17:02] okay take us back to the place this
[1:17:05] happened so maybe we can find blood or
[1:17:07] track this do you know what they were
[1:17:10] found when they got there they found his
[1:17:13] shoe prints all scuffed in the
[1:17:16] dirt and they found eight unfired rifle
[1:17:21] cartridges laying on the ground because
[1:17:25] in his paralysis he stood there and
[1:17:28] went and his mind said I shot over and
[1:17:32] over and
[1:17:35] over my you say how does that fit
[1:17:38] brother Paul well people under that
[1:17:41] anointing believe they've done so much
[1:17:44] for
[1:17:45] God and the reality of it is all the
[1:17:49] evidence right
[1:17:52] there they were spending their re tires
[1:17:55] whatever phrase you want to
[1:17:56] use and
[1:18:00] ultimately didn't we do many mighty
[1:18:04] works in your
[1:18:07] name and he says depart from me you
[1:18:11] worker of
[1:18:13] iniquity just like the man on the trail
[1:18:17] accomplishing
[1:18:19] nothing and this is the spirit Noah was
[1:18:23] dealing with they weren't doing anything
[1:18:27] at least Noah is building an ark they're
[1:18:30] all scarecrows right because they're
[1:18:33] trying to keep Noah and the people even
[1:18:37] his own family Noah himself from moving
[1:18:40] on doing what he called to do amen and
[1:18:44] it is in the age that we live in
[1:18:46] indecision is keeping many from the
[1:18:48] promise it's called spiritual
[1:18:50] paralysis amen now in Paradox amen let's
[1:18:53] just move forward on on this brother
[1:18:56] Alex I'm yeah
[1:19:00] oh okay I'll let you do the
[1:19:04] work look at
[1:19:06] this
[1:19:08] Noah got ready for it I'd imagine in his
[1:19:12] preparation times that the people said
[1:19:14] wonder what that old crank is having out
[1:19:17] there up there pounding away with an old
[1:19:19] wooden ship it's never rained there's no
[1:19:22] such thing I'd imagine science would
[1:19:24] come out to Noah and say lookie here we
[1:19:27] have instruments that we can shoot to
[1:19:29] the uh shoot the stars and there's no
[1:19:31] rain up there how in the world can your
[1:19:33] words be true when it's going to rain
[1:19:36] and there's no water up
[1:19:39] there we have no
[1:19:42] evidence that there was an
[1:19:44] angel stood right
[1:19:50] here until you read an account from
[1:19:54] someone who isn't even a message
[1:19:56] believer and said when they walked up
[1:19:59] they couldn't go any closer because
[1:20:02] there was something
[1:20:05] there but they're just old unbeliever
[1:20:07] that's so appreciative that they were
[1:20:09] prayed for and got healed that that that
[1:20:12] that's
[1:20:14] discounted because that spirit will walk
[1:20:18] how's that go now walk uh hob nail shoes
[1:20:22] I I was trying to grasp the they'll walk
[1:20:27] yeah yeah there it is thank you brother
[1:20:29] DAV my mind just couldn't quite grab a
[1:20:30] hold so walk H nail
[1:20:33] shoes the crudest form of shoes there
[1:20:37] are Where Angels won't even
[1:20:41] go they'd come and say No
[1:20:44] Nonsense
[1:20:46] nonsense Noah pushed back a lot my
[1:20:49] brother and sister I think we ought to
[1:20:50] have a little more respect for Noah amen
[1:20:53] there scarecrows all over over the place
[1:20:55] they surrounded that Ark amen and as
[1:20:57] he's putting the finished touches on the
[1:20:59] ark no doubt they are there like what
[1:21:01] are you talking about you you have
[1:21:04] wasted all this time all this resource
[1:21:06] if you had gave this to the church we
[1:21:09] could have had a great Mission program
[1:21:12] well that was a pretty awesome Mission
[1:21:14] program amen amen I'd imagine science
[1:21:18] come out Noah says look here we have
[1:21:20] instruments can shoot the moon the stars
[1:21:22] there's no rain up there how in the
[1:21:24] world can your words be true they just
[1:21:26] called him a liar now what when it's
[1:21:29] going to rain and there's no water up
[1:21:31] there but you see if God has said
[1:21:34] it said it was going to
[1:21:36] rain he can make
[1:21:40] rain if God says I'm your healer that's
[1:21:44] it you're healed that's it God says I'll
[1:21:48] deliver you you're delivered that's
[1:21:51] right and God says I'll bless you
[1:21:55] come on my brother and sister I think
[1:21:57] we've so limited God even though we have
[1:21:59] the word of the hour we've so limited
[1:22:01] God that we would be shocked out of our
[1:22:03] mind if our oil and our meal did never
[1:22:06] go away we'd be like going okay this is
[1:22:09] some kind of what my brother and sister
[1:22:11] I think Satan has pulled a quick one on
[1:22:14] us where we have an expectation that yes
[1:22:17] God can do this but it's almost like we
[1:22:20] need to add the deal will
[1:22:22] he he can but will he well we ought to
[1:22:26] be here tonight to say he can and he
[1:22:29] will amen if we have that need God would
[1:22:32] look down and say that's my son that's
[1:22:35] my daughter I can heal them and I want
[1:22:38] to heal them I can provide for them and
[1:22:41] I will provide for them amen it's no
[1:22:44] longer as stand here and say oh that
[1:22:47] happened over there but we are looking
[1:22:49] in the hour today that we are living my
[1:22:51] brother and sister and there is an ark
[1:22:54] that has been built in this generation
[1:22:57] amen calling us into his safety calling
[1:23:00] us into his Security will we get in that
[1:23:03] Ark Hallelujah I I'm not putting that as
[1:23:06] a question but it it's there my brother
[1:23:08] and sister it's the same thing that face
[1:23:11] Noah is facing you and I we've got a
[1:23:14] message to preach with our life if not
[1:23:17] with words but with our life and we've
[1:23:19] been called to give an offener ark to
[1:23:21] others Amen to offer it to our fam
[1:23:25] you see it was
[1:23:27] irrelevant what his children did after
[1:23:30] the
[1:23:32] fact God didn't say Noah you
[1:23:36] failed Noah did what God called him to
[1:23:40] do
[1:23:42] hallelujah
[1:23:44] amen it's so same today the message is
[1:23:47] too incredible for the
[1:23:50] masses even Mormons who believe in
[1:23:52] Prophets
[1:23:54] struggle a little bit God sent a prophet
[1:23:56] to you guys no he only sends them to
[1:23:59] us no no I'm sorry our Prophet fits
[1:24:02] within the Bible your Prophet had to
[1:24:04] write his own book to fit into
[1:24:08] it
[1:24:10] h and people sorry to be redundant but
[1:24:13] people think their worship is correct
[1:24:15] because it's well
[1:24:17] accepted amen just because there's a
[1:24:19] majority doesn't make it right that's
[1:24:21] right look this is a part that some
[1:24:24] people struggle I I've had friends turn
[1:24:26] back to the world from the message over
[1:24:28] this right here because a real
[1:24:30] relationship with Christ brings
[1:24:31] separation that's right now we're not
[1:24:34] talking about rejecting your neighbor
[1:24:36] acting like they don't exist your family
[1:24:38] members acting like they don't exist not
[1:24:41] talking about that kind of Separation
[1:24:43] it's from separation of the world now
[1:24:45] when the message was misconstrued many
[1:24:47] years ago that was preached in such that
[1:24:50] you reject your mama and your daddy cuz
[1:24:52] that's what the word says but they took
[1:24:54] it so far out of context they they
[1:24:56] brought it to a place that was so and
[1:24:59] and alienated families and then wondered
[1:25:01] why the families had animosity that's
[1:25:05] right instead of saying that's your mama
[1:25:08] your daddy that's right that's your
[1:25:11] children andun Uncle go live it in front
[1:25:14] of them amen go be Christ in the flesh
[1:25:19] that they can touch be Christ in the
[1:25:22] flesh that they'll sooner or later say
[1:25:24] what makes you tick amen and then you
[1:25:27] can say thank you for
[1:25:28] asking amen and then you can start to
[1:25:31] share this but instead it's like nope
[1:25:33] we're called to be
[1:25:35] separate you guys either believe this I
[1:25:39] can't tell you how many times this a kid
[1:25:41] I witness this now if you don't believe
[1:25:44] this your serpent
[1:25:47] seed you're going to
[1:25:50] hell I can remember the little town of
[1:25:52] green leaf the church is right there in
[1:25:53] Green Leaf
[1:25:55] I want to tell you Saints they did more
[1:25:57] damage to the message in that Community
[1:25:59] right there with that kind of
[1:26:02] nonsense so you believe God sent a
[1:26:04] prophet what do you mean God sent a
[1:26:05] prophet I don't understand what you're
[1:26:06] doing look either Believe it or don't
[1:26:08] because if you
[1:26:11] don't and people would be like they're
[1:26:16] crazy instead we should have been out
[1:26:19] there building an
[1:26:22] ark come on in
[1:26:25] come see what it
[1:26:26] is come see if it's real or not study it
[1:26:31] see if it fits the
[1:26:33] scripture instead they stood at the end
[1:26:35] of the
[1:26:36] ramp give them a word test that's it
[1:26:40] when they themselves didn't live the
[1:26:41] word they were giving
[1:26:44] word that would be like Paul teaching
[1:26:48] English H and
[1:26:52] algebra and Gi geography and
[1:26:57] history you imagine the wreck we would
[1:27:00] have and that's what happened they were
[1:27:03] teaching man's concept the church was
[1:27:06] saying
[1:27:08] denominational that's
[1:27:10] false and the people took it at face
[1:27:12] value because after all it's Noah who
[1:27:15] went off in the
[1:27:20] end and a real
[1:27:22] relationship bring real relationship
[1:27:25] with Christ brings preparation I'm going
[1:27:27] to close here Revelations 19:7 and 8 we
[1:27:31] know the scripture let us be glad and
[1:27:32] rejoice somebody rejoicing tonight amen
[1:27:36] and give honor amen for the marriage of
[1:27:38] the Lamb has come and his wife hath made
[1:27:41] herself ready this is what was happening
[1:27:43] it didn't matter what they said over
[1:27:45] here didn't matter what they said over
[1:27:46] there this little wife has come down and
[1:27:49] said I know this is the truth it's a
[1:27:51] revelation to me and I'm just going to
[1:27:53] be prepared just going to make myself
[1:27:55] ready and what do I have to
[1:27:58] lose what do I have to
[1:28:01] lose being ready for a Rapture and we
[1:28:04] get old and we get feeble and we pass to
[1:28:07] the
[1:28:08] grave and the Rapture never took place
[1:28:10] so is all our preparation for the
[1:28:12] Rapture
[1:28:13] wasted no sir because the Rapture is
[1:28:16] actually drawing us into the presence of
[1:28:18] Christ so whether we come and walk Amen
[1:28:21] Alive and remain or whether we pass from
[1:28:24] this life into the presence that
[1:28:26] preparation is what brings us into the
[1:28:28] presence of the Lord amen there's no
[1:28:32] wasted effort oh my let me hurry
[1:28:37] here now I'll just preach it real quick
[1:28:40] Matthew 24:34 through 38 it's talking
[1:28:43] about there the days of Noah so shall it
[1:28:45] be at the coming of the Sant of man and
[1:28:47] we we see this evidence around us my
[1:28:49] brother and sisters such violence such
[1:28:52] such perversion
[1:28:55] uh and I always used to think that the
[1:28:56] perversion would be restricted to the
[1:28:59] perverts sorry to put it that
[1:29:02] blunt but it's become wholesale now it's
[1:29:05] become
[1:29:06] accepted it's a way of
[1:29:11] life
[1:29:13] my my I listened to a
[1:29:17] policeman was in charge of a certain
[1:29:20] unit within a big city police deal and
[1:29:23] he said
[1:29:24] if we arrested all of the perverted
[1:29:28] people in this city we'd have to start
[1:29:31] at City
[1:29:36] Hall come
[1:29:38] on this is not a bottom up thing it's a
[1:29:41] top down thing amen it's
[1:29:45] there I I hope I'm not out of line with
[1:29:48] you now uh let's go to Ministry explain
[1:29:53] there brother Alex sorry move on on you
[1:29:57] I believe the coming of Jesus Christ is
[1:29:59] drawing nigh I believe that you if you
[1:30:01] want to call that fanaticism just go
[1:30:04] ahead and Mark me a fanatic and we say
[1:30:06] Amen because I believe in the literal
[1:30:08] physical coming of Jesus the second time
[1:30:11] and I believe it's drawing nigh and now
[1:30:14] and I believe we just have a short time
[1:30:15] to work and I believe that this
[1:30:17] Universal Revival that's sweeping the
[1:30:20] lands today is the indication of the
[1:30:22] message like it was in the days of of
[1:30:24] Noah while men and women were rioting in
[1:30:27] sin and Noah had a fanatic gospel that
[1:30:31] he preached but he called the people to
[1:30:34] an Ark of
[1:30:36] Safety to those rioting in sin it was
[1:30:40] fanaticism but to you it was life to you
[1:30:44] it was the word of personal relationship
[1:30:47] amen and and I believe that glorious
[1:30:50] Gospel of the Son of God manifested by
[1:30:52] the Holy Ghost is sweeping the country
[1:30:54] today bringing people into the ark which
[1:30:56] is Christ Jesus safely secured from all
[1:31:00] the judgments the ceiling amen safely
[1:31:03] secured from all the judgments that's
[1:31:04] going to come and when the Judgment
[1:31:06] strikes the earth and the atomic Powers
[1:31:08] Rock the Nations we'll ride above the
[1:31:11] waves into Glory I believe it and I'm
[1:31:14] here to say tonight I believe it and I
[1:31:17] believe that there's been a little
[1:31:18] church that's been called Fanatics for a
[1:31:20] long time and now I do realize there is
[1:31:24] Fanatics certainly there is there's
[1:31:27] plenty of them but a little church
[1:31:29] that's tried to struggle not to be a
[1:31:31] certain denomination or a certain name
[1:31:34] but I mean peoples who love God isn't
[1:31:37] this what it's coming down to my brother
[1:31:38] and sister oh we have the best pastor we
[1:31:41] have the best Choir The Best Song
[1:31:43] program the biggest church we have this
[1:31:45] that or the other no my brother and
[1:31:47] sisters coming down to a love affair
[1:31:49] with Jesus Christ amen and in that love
[1:31:52] affair you're not going to to burn that
[1:31:54] out of them you can chop their head off
[1:31:57] you can throw them off the cliff on the
[1:31:59] Rock none of that will change it because
[1:32:01] they know exactly who they are and where
[1:32:03] they stand
[1:32:06] hallelujah amen and it's held out amen
[1:32:09] but I mean people who love God and it's
[1:32:11] held out for the
[1:32:13] supernatural now bear with
[1:32:17] me right now I've preached almost too
[1:32:21] long it's a little bit warm in here at
[1:32:24] least it is up
[1:32:26] here do you
[1:32:30] feel Supernatural right
[1:32:36] now
[1:32:38] h
[1:32:40] no but you know that you are
[1:32:45] Supernatural there's the
[1:32:47] separation that's coming that's right I
[1:32:51] don't go by feel I go by revelation
[1:32:54] ation of the word that the Lord has
[1:32:57] showed me I am Supernatural from
[1:33:02] beginning I don't know how far back is
[1:33:06] before the foundation of the
[1:33:09] world interesting
[1:33:12] question but right into
[1:33:15] eternity we're
[1:33:17] Supernatural not what we feel not oh I
[1:33:21] feel so Supernatural today look I don't
[1:33:24] want to sound boastful but ministers
[1:33:26] here and and others too I've laid hands
[1:33:29] on people and witnessed God answer their
[1:33:32] prayer and heal them right in the laying
[1:33:35] of hands before your
[1:33:38] eyes and we have prayed for needs for
[1:33:42] years that's right and not saw them now
[1:33:45] which one are we going to say is
[1:33:47] Supernatural
[1:33:55] pray for somebody and they get healed
[1:33:56] and they back slide and go out in the
[1:33:58] world but living in this state that we
[1:34:01] think is sad their desperation serve God
[1:34:05] the Lord takes them
[1:34:08] home I talked to a brother the other day
[1:34:11] I won't give the whole scenario to you
[1:34:14] but he laid a scenario out he says now
[1:34:16] Paul if this and this
[1:34:19] happens and in this case it was actually
[1:34:22] a scenario of money
[1:34:24] and if they're a $5,000 person he was
[1:34:28] referring to
[1:34:29] monthly 5,000 a month that pays their
[1:34:32] bills they raise their family their
[1:34:34] clothes they they pay their ties they
[1:34:36] give their offerings and then we decide
[1:34:39] we're helping this man and we help him
[1:34:42] to earn $20,000 a
[1:34:47] month any
[1:34:50] backslides who is responsible
[1:34:59] you see if we
[1:35:01] did and not
[1:35:05] God if we tried to fix the
[1:35:08] problem and didn't leave it to the
[1:35:11] Lord we're
[1:35:13] responsible then the brother turned that
[1:35:16] and he says and if we have the word
[1:35:18] which is worth a
[1:35:20] million and we won't share it
[1:35:24] who's
[1:35:27] responsible you see this is not a game
[1:35:29] we're
[1:35:30] playing Noah he didn't play a game the
[1:35:33] day come God told him you call them
[1:35:36] they'll come imagine you call it and
[1:35:40] here comes two
[1:35:42] groundhogs and you realize there's no
[1:35:44] groundhogs live in your
[1:35:46] neighborhood and imagine you call for a
[1:35:49] zebra zebras are
[1:35:51] cool and zebras come and March right in
[1:35:54] there they don't Bonk they don't run
[1:35:56] sister Jerry and I have been in Africa
[1:35:58] we've seen zebra zebra mamas that even
[1:36:01] you looking at their baby we would try
[1:36:04] to nudge forward in the vehicle to look
[1:36:06] at the baby and the mama would be right
[1:36:08] there I can see her trigonometry taking
[1:36:11] place
[1:36:13] angle and she's a half a step forward
[1:36:16] you still can't see the baby you back up
[1:36:18] a little
[1:36:20] bit can't see the baby pull Way Forward
[1:36:25] can't see the
[1:36:26] baby now if God would put that in an
[1:36:30] animal imagine a
[1:36:32] zebra just coming here's my
[1:36:38] ticket imagine here's the bride brother
[1:36:41] Trevor here's my ticket it's called the
[1:36:44] word I'm out of here I've got an ark
[1:36:48] I've got a place of safety I don't have
[1:36:51] to worry about a balm shelter reminds me
[1:36:53] of a time I believe that was in Missouri
[1:36:56] these this family they had moved from
[1:36:58] out west southwest they moved to
[1:37:00] Missouri and and they were afraid of
[1:37:02] tornadoes and so they paid this company
[1:37:04] to build and bury this big tornado
[1:37:07] shelter underground and here comes a
[1:37:09] tornado coming right down the state
[1:37:11] highway looks like it's coming right to
[1:37:12] their house and they run out there and
[1:37:14] they go to go down the steps and here's
[1:37:16] a big old water
[1:37:18] mckas and they turned to each other they
[1:37:20] were Christians they turned to each
[1:37:21] other said well let's go stand stand in
[1:37:23] the bathroom doorway and
[1:37:26] pray no no my brother and sister we
[1:37:29] don't need what man can provide our Arc
[1:37:31] is here the door is open we've been
[1:37:34] called to enter in hallelujah amen well
[1:37:37] I hope yall didn't mind me me just
[1:37:39] having fun preaching tonight amen
[1:37:45] hallelujah brother Alex if you had
[1:37:50] come got one last quote if y'all don't
[1:37:53] mind
[1:37:55] amen modern events made
[1:37:59] clear been a lot of argument in the
[1:38:01] message in the last while I'm going to
[1:38:02] just be
[1:38:03] blunt is this Pentecostal move some are
[1:38:06] saying if you don't have this
[1:38:07] Pentecostal move your church is dead and
[1:38:10] others are saying if you're acting like
[1:38:12] Pentecostals you're kind of fanatic and
[1:38:14] there's a lot of little bickering in
[1:38:16] these circles that are out here and I'm
[1:38:19] not going to settle this argument
[1:38:20] tonight but I am going to take what the
[1:38:23] prophet said and stand on that amen he
[1:38:26] said we're not living in a Pentecostal
[1:38:28] age we're living in another age see
[1:38:30] we're not living in the Methodist age
[1:38:32] we're living in another age we're living
[1:38:34] on up here in the bride age the calling
[1:38:37] out of the church and getting it
[1:38:40] together for the Rapture that's the age
[1:38:42] that we're now living to my honest
[1:38:45] opinion that's exactly the truth and
[1:38:47] this book is a book of Prophecy its
[1:38:50] Believers are commanded to honor it and
[1:38:53] and to read it and believe its author
[1:38:56] for every word that's written in there
[1:38:58] must come to pass Can someone say Amen
[1:39:01] everything that's been promised has to
[1:39:03] come to pass because it is Jesus Christ
[1:39:07] in each age oh my amen the same
[1:39:13] yesterday it was Jesus Christ was in
[1:39:16] Noah it was Jesus Christ in Moses it was
[1:39:20] Jesus Christ in David it was Jesus
[1:39:23] Christ in Joseph it's Jesus Christ the
[1:39:26] same yesterday today and forever it's
[1:39:28] Jesus Christ among his people today amen
[1:39:33] doing the things that he promised he
[1:39:34] would do in this age it's Jesus Christ
[1:39:38] Hallelujah aren't you glad today you can
[1:39:40] lift a hand and say it's Jesus Christ in
[1:39:43] me amen I am in him and he is in me and
[1:39:49] there's no scarecrow that same scarecrow
[1:39:52] that tried to detour Noah has come right
[1:39:54] down Through the Ages and I don't know I
[1:39:56] might preach on every one of these
[1:39:57] scarecrows I've dug out of the scripture
[1:40:00] but I don't want it to become a
[1:40:01] redundant because it really is the same
[1:40:03] story all over again God coming on the
[1:40:06] scene God speaks and the scarecrows
[1:40:09] start popping up out of nowhere right
[1:40:11] you know they're like well it was Luther
[1:40:13] and it was Wesley no it was God it was
[1:40:15] our Lord Jesus Christ amen that was him
[1:40:18] speaking these men are just men they
[1:40:21] made such a thing of Thunders oh he's
[1:40:24] got it anointing anointing anointing
[1:40:27] well if God didn't speak to him it'll
[1:40:29] flop it'll fall on its face but when God
[1:40:33] speaks and who's he using I'm going to
[1:40:36] throw the spin on you right here he's
[1:40:38] using Brother Paul praise God he's such
[1:40:40] a well no actually I'm thinking he's
[1:40:42] using
[1:40:45] you it's
[1:40:47] himself using you you are a
[1:40:51] manifestation of the the Thunders in
[1:40:55] this day amen no $55,000 suits no
[1:40:59] Rolexes no big lifting up everybody woo
[1:41:04] no you humble unnoticed walking down the
[1:41:08] street
[1:41:10] living amen that's what they got in
[1:41:12] Noah's age the fact they couldn't accept
[1:41:14] it was their
[1:41:15] problem and that's what's happening in
[1:41:18] this age and the fact they can't accept
[1:41:20] it will be their problem but that
[1:41:23] doesn't give us permission to be
[1:41:24] arrogant or narcistic or all those other
[1:41:28] definitive words amen okay I'll stop
[1:41:34] amen let's just stand sing a couple
[1:41:36] songs if you don't mind amen I know it

[1:41:45] got here my brother and sister we we
[1:41:47] know what's brought us to this place in
[1:41:50] time amen they can say it's fanaticism
[1:41:53] well that's not going to affect me cuz
[1:41:55] it's not fanaticism to me it's reality
[1:42:00] Hallelujah I know it was the blood oh I
[1:42:04] know it was the
[1:42:06] blood I know it was the blood for
[1:42:13] me one day when Paul was lost he died
[1:42:18] upon the cross and I know it was the
[1:42:22] blood for
[1:42:25] me oh there's power in the
[1:42:29] blood Power in the Blood there's power
