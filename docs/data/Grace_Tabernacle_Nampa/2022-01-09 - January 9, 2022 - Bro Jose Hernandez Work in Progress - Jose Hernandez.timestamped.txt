[35:49] you know there's many stories
[35:53] in the world today
[35:55] aren't you glad that you can make that
[35:57] your story
[35:58] that
[35:59] being able to say that
[36:01] i serve a risen savior
[36:03] you know i
[36:05] have kind of a varied interest of things
[36:07] and curiosities and
[36:10] i was listening to a um
[36:13] a a man in a conversation as it were uh
[36:17] with an lds gentleman
[36:19] and they were discussing the differences
[36:22] and i thought you know isn't that
[36:23] interesting one of the things they
[36:25] question the lds faith on
[36:28] is that
[36:30] their personal close relationship in
[36:32] this lds gentleman is saying
[36:35] now we don't believe we're just saved
[36:38] we believe we are literally the sons and
[36:41] daughters of god
[36:43] and i thought isn't that interesting how
[36:45] that they articulate that
[36:48] because literally
[36:50] aren't you glad today you can say he's
[36:51] my father
[36:53] amen we're not just looking at somebody
[36:55] who come and paid a ransom for us and
[36:58] had no connection to us but the very
[37:00] fact we were in him before the
[37:02] foundation of the world amen brother
[37:05] ivan sister nadia you didn't make it
[37:07] very far
[37:11] amen well i was surprised sister nadia
[37:13] come walking in i'm like i've been
[37:15] telling everybody they've went away for
[37:16] the weekend
[37:18] so
[37:19] anyway
[37:20] hopefully i didn't bring up sore spot
[37:22] there
[37:23] i just wanted to take a moment
[37:26] i want to speak not only to the church
[37:28] but my brother jose
[37:30] saints ever since i met brother jose
[37:33] many years ago
[37:34] i felt a very kindred spirit with him
[37:38] and
[37:38] knowing that
[37:40] his very nature getting to know his
[37:43] family
[37:44] and
[37:46] so
[37:46] you know one i want to share i don't
[37:48] take any thunder away from brother jose
[37:50] but
[37:51] his son was recently
[37:53] went
[37:54] joey went to his um
[37:57] i think final checkup isn't it
[37:59] and
[38:00] they have
[38:02] declared him completely free
[38:05] from i guess you would call that
[38:06] leukemia wouldn't it be considered
[38:08] leukemia completely free
[38:10] not a sign of it
[38:12] in his body
[38:15] amen
[38:16] we serve an awesome god
[38:19] amen and we have a living testimony
[38:21] right in our midst this morning
[38:24] that our god is a healer
[38:26] amen
[38:27] and i just want to say this i love and i
[38:30] appreciate this family
[38:32] very very much
[38:34] and
[38:35] this morning i want
[38:36] us
[38:37] grace i want us
[38:39] to just pull
[38:41] really hard on the word
[38:43] and i want brother jose to say now i'm
[38:46] not a very good preacher
[38:49] i want him to eliminate that this
[38:50] morning
[38:52] and i want him to eliminate i'm hard to
[38:54] understand
[38:56] and i want him to preach this morning
[38:59] with absolute confidence that the lord
[39:02] divine
[39:03] divinely

[39:11] and then he says do you need help and i
[39:13] said yes you want to be a farmer

[39:22] hear a knock on the door yesterday
[39:24] afternoon
[39:26] and i go down to the door and i hear a
[39:28] little girl's voice
[39:30] and i open the door and their sweet
[39:32] little grace standing there looking up
[39:34] at me
[39:36] and i thought my
[39:38] that's interesting

[39:44] cephei on the other but you know i'd
[39:46] been praying yesterday afternoon

[39:54] kind of feel hesitant
[39:58] i don't know sister jerry and i discuss
[39:59] it might not be the right words but
[40:02] i didn't really share this completely
[40:04] with brother jose but

[40:21] kind of feeling a little bit down and i
[40:23] was praying lord you know just
[40:25] something special

[43:09] god bless brother dave and his family
[43:11] down there
[43:13] we uh
[43:14] brother jim
[43:16] went to uh
[43:18] him and his wife has have a business of
[43:20] rocks
[43:22] they buy and sell rocks sister makes
[43:25] little nice jewelry of
[43:27] rocks i mean
[43:31] you you see an ugly rock she turns into
[43:33] beautiful
[43:35] something there and
[43:36] you see an ugly car brother jim turns
[43:38] into a nice car worth of forty thousand
[43:41] dollars so i mean there's some some
[43:43] people they can do things right
[43:45] but uh
[43:46] he said we're i'm not gonna be here this
[43:48] weekend so uh uh i just need prayers
[43:51] traveling mercies and so my other sister
[43:56] was uh
[43:57] taking care of her mom
[43:59] sister connie and then i said well i'm
[44:01] gonna take my whole congregation with me
[44:03] and let's go visit brother paul
[44:06] so
[44:07] here we are
[44:09] and uh
[44:10] this is like my
[44:12] my second home church here so
[44:16] i uh like brother paul was saying i just
[44:18] feel the same way since i met him which
[44:20] is i think we shared this before but
[44:23] i uh
[44:24] um
[44:26] i just
[44:27] we got a
[44:29] some connection there and that's the
[44:31] grace of god you know
[44:33] i know
[44:34] then later found out that he is
[44:36] sagittarius as well so i'm saying oh
[44:38] there is
[44:40] so sagittarius people they're nice
[44:42] people
[44:45] just kidding just kidding ask my wife
[44:50] sometimes we trouble but you know
[44:54] uh
[44:55] there's got it was one guy says trouble
[44:58] is my last name
[45:00] but
[45:01] that's not my last name my last name is
[45:03] hernandez and i i belong from
[45:06] a lineage
[45:08] way
[45:09] beyond the hernandez
[45:11] so it's the blood of jesus christ and uh
[45:14] and that's where all
[45:16] uh
[45:16] so uh sagittarius or whatever
[45:20] is is nothing
[45:22] related to it but i mean when you love
[45:24] the lord you're gonna love his children
[45:27] and and uh
[45:29] you know just reading the bible i find
[45:32] out that
[45:33] and you know that too that
[45:35] we are the body of jesus christ
[45:38] and then
[45:41] it doesn't matter how
[45:42] small the member is is
[45:44] as important as the biggest one
[45:49] but
[45:51] uh we're just grateful to the lord
[45:53] because
[45:54] we've been
[45:56] i don't think she's speaking about me
[45:58] but i think all been through some
[46:01] valleys
[46:02] and some mountains and again valley
[46:06] and and sometimes the valley feels like
[46:08] it's longer than mountain you know it's
[46:09] just
[46:10] but
[46:11] uh
[46:12] just thinking about all these
[46:14] things that are
[46:16] um
[46:17] the the the christian
[46:19] faces in life
[46:21] but there is always like brother paul
[46:23] was saying
[46:24] help is on the way
[46:26] so it's always
[46:28] we're in trouble but you know help is in
[46:30] the way
[46:32] and it is uh i've been
[46:35] meditating on
[46:36] a lot on this uh
[46:39] thought is
[46:40] and i will call it a work in progress
[46:43] because i feel like i'm a work in
[46:44] progress
[46:46] so that's that's my thought for this
[46:48] warning if you bear with me i always aim
[46:50] to to speak like 30 40 minutes max
[46:53] and then all of a sudden i see my my son
[46:55] in the back with the paper says one hour
[46:58] so
[47:02] uh
[47:03] so i try not to do that here but
[47:06] i just

[47:11] uh i always like to uh start before i
[47:15] start i haven't started brother paul

[52:31] psalms
[52:33] psalms 34.
[52:37] psalms 34 and
[52:39] 17.

[52:44] hiding somewhere with grace
[52:48] but uh i
[52:50] happy to be here again with my
[52:53] wife and kids
[52:55] and uh it's just a blessing that
[52:58] i think when

[53:05] same business you're in

[53:11] and i don't know why but i always come
[53:13] here and i'll get emotional so forgive
[53:15] me for that
[53:17] so uh
[53:18] psalms 34.
[53:21] you know before we go there i i would
[53:23] like to back up a little go back a
[53:25] little bit verse six
[53:27] it says
[53:29] this poor man cried out and the lord
[53:32] hear him
[53:34] and save him
[53:35] out of all his troubles
[53:38] then 17 says the righteous cried out and
[53:40] to the lord
[53:42] cried out
[53:43] and the lord hears
[53:45] and delivers them out of all their
[53:47] troubles
[53:49] the lord is near to those who have
[53:51] broken heart
[53:53] and save such as
[53:55] contrite contrite spirit
[53:59] this is the part that i like
[54:02] and i enjoy most many are the
[54:04] afflictions of the righteous
[54:06] but the lord delivers him out of all of
[54:09] them
[54:11] can you repeat that with me please
[54:14] many are the afflictions of the
[54:16] righteous
[54:17] but the lord delivers him out
[54:20] of them all
[54:23] he he guards his bones
[54:25] now one of them is broken it says and if
[54:28] you go if you go to john 19 36 that's
[54:31] when when when the they were
[54:34] trying to break his bones
[54:35] and they found out that he was already
[54:37] dead so he didn't they didn't do it
[54:39] and i'm so glad that we got through many
[54:43] tribulations in life
[54:45] many hardships
[54:47] but you know what you'd be glad that his
[54:49] body never be broken
[54:51] that's amazing right
[54:53] then uh let's go to the book of second
[54:56] timothy
[55:04] uh
[55:04] 3
[55:06] verse 11.
[55:14] i'm reading the new james king james
[55:17] version so might sound different than
[55:19] yours
[55:23] second theme of 311 reads like this
[55:26] persecutions afflictions which happened
[55:29] to me in antioch and aquanium
[55:32] lystra
[55:34] what persecutions i endure
[55:36] and out of them
[55:38] all the lord deliver me yes
[55:40] and all who desire to live godly in
[55:43] christ jesus will suffer persecution
[55:46] but evil men and imposters will grow
[55:50] worse and worse deceiving and be
[55:53] being deceived
[55:57] let's pray heavenly father we thank you
[55:59] for this opportunity lord thank you for
[56:02] having us here lord
[56:05] have a wonderful trip yesterday father
[56:07] and
[56:08] father we just glad to be here in the
[56:11] house of the lord and
[56:13] and and
[56:14] just impart
[56:16] to this uh portion of the bride lord
[56:18] it's just a
[56:20] tremendous weight on over my shoulders
[56:23] father but i know that you can come and
[56:25] speak to them
[56:26] and push me away lord we ask you these
[56:28] things and help us lauren
[56:32] thank you for your love and mercy to us
[56:36] thank you and let me love jesus christ
[56:38] amen
[56:40] you may be seated
[56:41] i just want to say that appreciate
[56:43] brother paul's confidence again
[56:46] and uh
[56:47] i appreciate you for your patience and
[56:51] and uh
[56:54] if
[56:56] i'm just praying that
[57:00] um for for some reason i i see it coming
[57:04] that uh i was gonna be speaking today so
[57:07] i kind of
[57:08] back on my head i was
[57:10] preparing and
[57:15] honestly it's a privilege that someone
[57:17] can trust
[57:18] their pulpit
[57:20] and
[57:21] i appreciate that very much
[57:24] and uh like i said i feel this is like
[57:27] my second
[57:28] home church so i know that i'll be
[57:30] forgiven if i
[57:32] say something backwards or
[57:35] i i told a guy the other day you you
[57:38] build backwards and he says no
[57:40] not backwards different
[57:43] so
[57:43] if i say something different
[57:48] i was uh
[57:51] looking into this uh psalms here
[57:55] and it says many are the afflictions of
[57:57] the righteous but the lord is gonna
[57:59] deliver you know just thinking over and
[58:02] over of of uh
[58:04] this uh situation here and uh
[58:08] and uh
[58:09] remember my thought is a work in
[58:11] progress
[58:12] so uh
[58:13] you know for any
[58:15] anything
[58:17] whatever you do in life since since the
[58:19] day you were born
[58:21] you're born into uh
[58:24] you're getting into a challenge
[58:27] if a
[58:29] baby is born he is going to have a
[58:31] difficulty to
[58:34] find the breast of mom to start because
[58:36] that's the first thing they want to do
[58:38] and they find out that it's difficult so
[58:41] they just move their head and they don't
[58:44] know where to go so the mom has to help
[58:45] them and and put them in the right spot
[58:48] so
[58:48] you know since the day we we're born we
[58:51] have
[58:52] challenge in life
[58:54] and as we grow the challenges are
[58:57] heavier and heavier or more difficult
[58:59] right
[59:01] and
[59:02] it's
[59:03] it's the same way with the christian
[59:04] life
[59:06] we
[59:07] we're born
[59:08] we're a newborn creature and
[59:11] we're
[59:12] have the we still have the honey and the
[59:15] and then the calm and and oh everything
[59:17] is good and yeah but uh when the first
[59:23] trial comes
[59:25] we shake us all the honey that was left
[59:27] there
[59:29] so and then
[59:30] we have to
[59:32] grasp and whatever
[59:34] you you can to grab hold on and
[59:36] and if you want to make it you have to
[59:38] fight for it
[59:40] if even though jesus christ jesus christ
[59:42] came and paid the price for us
[59:44] we they had to pay a price for
[59:47] not for me
[59:48] but i had to pay a price to deliver the
[59:51] same
[59:53] uh salvation that i have we have to pay
[59:55] the price for the others
[59:57] because that's that's the reason we are
[59:59] christians
[1:00:00] what what's
[1:00:02] what is a christian is christ like
[1:00:05] what he did
[1:00:07] i i'm not i'm not asking you to to raise
[1:00:09] dead people or
[1:00:11] feed a thousand people 5 000 people with
[1:00:13] couple fishes but i'm just trying to
[1:00:16] let's just do the basics how's that
[1:00:18] i mean which is
[1:00:21] feel
[1:00:22] the need you see a need you go go for it
[1:00:24] and do whatever you can
[1:00:27] you don't need to give a million dollars
[1:00:29] but you just give them what they need
[1:00:30] maybe they just need a hug
[1:00:33] just give them a hug and that's it
[1:00:36] maybe they just they just need a
[1:00:38] glass of milk
[1:00:40] just give them a glass of milk doesn't
[1:00:41] cost any
[1:00:43] but
[1:00:44] we
[1:00:45] are in a
[1:00:46] in a world that we have trials
[1:00:49] we have temptations
[1:00:52] and we have a tough time
[1:00:55] but you know what
[1:00:57] when you go back
[1:01:00] and read the bible
[1:01:02] and we have this confidence this
[1:01:04] assurance brother jason's
[1:01:06] uh
[1:01:08] songs is blessed assurance
[1:01:11] and that we have assurance it doesn't
[1:01:14] matter how hard it is right now
[1:01:18] he made it
[1:01:20] possible
[1:01:22] so he's not going to let us fight alone
[1:01:26] as long we stay
[1:01:28] with the world
[1:01:30] because we
[1:01:32] want to be
[1:01:33] smart enough to say oh i can handle this
[1:01:34] on my own
[1:01:36] i'm sorry but you're gonna
[1:01:39] you're gonna go to
[1:01:42] a place where it's gonna be hard for you
[1:01:44] to come out alone
[1:01:46] then you go
[1:01:49] verse six says
[1:01:53] these poor man cry out and the lord here
[1:01:56] hurt him
[1:01:59] we have
[1:02:01] the proof
[1:02:02] we cry out to the lord
[1:02:05] he's gonna
[1:02:06] that's a promise
[1:02:08] now remember this
[1:02:10] the righteous man
[1:02:12] you're doing evil
[1:02:14] says the the bible says that
[1:02:17] god
[1:02:18] doesn't pay attention to the evil people
[1:02:21] he's
[1:02:23] focused on the righteous people
[1:02:26] looking out
[1:02:28] to do his will
[1:02:30] i know we're going to make mistakes he
[1:02:31] knows we're going to make mistakes
[1:02:33] but
[1:02:35] he's still there because
[1:02:37] we're righteous and we we do mistakes
[1:02:39] because
[1:02:40] we're just human beings
[1:02:43] and sometimes we we think we're smart
[1:02:45] enough but we're full
[1:02:46] and get to that
[1:02:49] but
[1:02:51] i was uh going to share with you
[1:02:56] something here that
[1:02:58] we we know that we
[1:03:00] we know affliction sometimes
[1:03:03] uh
[1:03:04] i'm not saying we need him
[1:03:07] but uh i think sometimes
[1:03:11] they have to be there for a purpose
[1:03:14] uh
[1:03:15] and uh if the lord says
[1:03:18] uh
[1:03:19] that
[1:03:20] he's gonna be
[1:03:22] he's gonna get out of something good out
[1:03:23] of us through the afflictions he's gonna
[1:03:25] let that happen
[1:03:27] because the affliction can be direct
[1:03:31] for a consequence of something
[1:03:33] affliction can be judge a judgment from
[1:03:35] the lord
[1:03:37] or
[1:03:38] to purify us from something
[1:03:42] but
[1:03:43] you know the the the very first thing
[1:03:45] when uh we go through uh affliction
[1:03:48] uh
[1:03:50] we don't we don't wanna wait till
[1:03:51] someone even the pastor or someone comes
[1:03:53] and
[1:03:54] uh uh because for that situation there
[1:03:56] is a lot of people
[1:03:59] righteous people to come and judge you
[1:04:03] because they don't know
[1:04:05] what you're going through
[1:04:06] and maybe they're
[1:04:08] the the
[1:04:09] the step you're going through is
[1:04:11] something that is not difficult for them
[1:04:13] to
[1:04:14] to overcome
[1:04:16] and there's a lot of people remember joe
[1:04:18] was uh was a righteous man
[1:04:22] god even god called him perfect
[1:04:27] i think god was very proud of job
[1:04:31] and
[1:04:32] and uh he uh
[1:04:35] he had these troubles in life
[1:04:38] and his friends came and said hey you
[1:04:40] must be a secret sinner you must be
[1:04:42] doing this you must be because we are
[1:04:44] good to come up with some conclusions
[1:04:48] and that's that's the human nature
[1:04:51] and uh
[1:04:52] but uh i'm glad um that's not happening
[1:04:55] here
[1:04:59] uh affliction this is a part of a living
[1:05:02] and fallen world
[1:05:04] affliction
[1:05:05] there is a bunch of scriptures here that
[1:05:07] if if i go through them is
[1:05:10] we're gonna be out of here by five
[1:05:12] o'clock
[1:05:13] um but
[1:05:15] i just want you to to remember this that
[1:05:19] when when you
[1:05:21] have
[1:05:22] going when you going through something
[1:05:24] that you can't handle on your own
[1:05:27] we always have someone can
[1:05:30] take care of that
[1:05:31] and we the the problem is that we don't
[1:05:34] know how how to let go our problem
[1:05:38] that's that's the
[1:05:39] i think that's the main thing here that
[1:05:42] that we want help
[1:05:43] but we don't really want help
[1:05:46] god help me with this problem here
[1:05:49] but i i
[1:05:50] i don't want to let it go because
[1:05:53] you you you
[1:05:54] you think that you have to supervise the
[1:05:57] process
[1:06:01] and no it's not that way
[1:06:03] god says you want my help let it go
[1:06:08] let it go
[1:06:10] because we have to let go
[1:06:12] our eggo
[1:06:14] and our everything
[1:06:17] we
[1:06:18] sometimes is it's hard but
[1:06:20] you know we have to
[1:06:23] learn how to trust yes
[1:06:27] god's plans
[1:06:29] we don't we we don't know his plans but
[1:06:32] he knows why he plans for us
[1:06:35] and he knows
[1:06:37] what do we need
[1:06:39] because if he wants us to put in a
[1:06:41] position where we need to be
[1:06:43] ready for service
[1:06:45] he's going to put us through a lot of
[1:06:48] hardships
[1:06:50] and not in the bad way
[1:06:52] but he's going to
[1:06:53] make sure that we're ready for a task he
[1:06:55] has
[1:06:57] for us
[1:06:59] just imagine david
[1:07:02] he was a kid he was called uh his
[1:07:05] father gave him the
[1:07:07] the job to be a pastor of the ship the
[1:07:10] flock there
[1:07:12] and uh reading some stories
[1:07:16] i heard that being a pastor was the
[1:07:20] the lowest job you can get
[1:07:24] because even in uh when the the children
[1:07:26] of israel got to egypt being a pastor
[1:07:30] was a
[1:07:31] not good
[1:07:32] it was not high society
[1:07:35] they were smelly
[1:07:37] and it wasn't
[1:07:39] but he was called to do
[1:07:41] to be a pastor of those
[1:07:44] ships
[1:07:45] and and
[1:07:47] he didn't complain about it
[1:07:49] and what i'm saying this because he was
[1:07:51] playing his harp and he was having fun
[1:07:55] when you like something or
[1:07:57] you have fun doing it
[1:07:59] like i saw brother paul yesterday he was
[1:08:01] having fun painting
[1:08:05] but you know david had to go through
[1:08:07] that
[1:08:08] he didn't complain
[1:08:11] and
[1:08:11] and while he was pastoring those uh
[1:08:14] lamps
[1:08:15] then a bear came that's the first trial
[1:08:18] or the lion i don't know why i came
[1:08:19] first i don't remember but
[1:08:22] it was his first test
[1:08:25] he never killed he was never trained to
[1:08:27] be a a bear killer or a lion killer
[1:08:31] in his mind
[1:08:33] he had no clue how to kill it
[1:08:35] but he had to act upon what he had in
[1:08:37] his hands
[1:08:39] what do you have in your hands
[1:08:43] what the lord give you in your hands
[1:08:47] when we got a first trial we're gonna go
[1:08:50] run and hide or we're gonna face it with
[1:08:52] what we have on our hands
[1:08:55] that's what i'm trying to
[1:08:58] i'm trying to to project here that
[1:09:00] we're not alone it doesn't matter how
[1:09:02] harsh
[1:09:04] heart looks how hard it feels we're not
[1:09:06] alone
[1:09:08] and david david knew
[1:09:10] that somehow he was gonna
[1:09:13] kill that animal
[1:09:15] so he had to act upon
[1:09:18] what he had
[1:09:19] on his hands so he killed it and then
[1:09:21] the other animal came he killed it
[1:09:25] and you think uh
[1:09:28] he was thinking oh i'm gonna be ready
[1:09:30] because
[1:09:31] there will be a giant coming and i have
[1:09:34] to train more i have to train harder
[1:09:36] nope
[1:09:38] but but the lord had
[1:09:41] that plan for him
[1:09:44] and the thing is
[1:09:46] what is god wants you to have in
[1:09:49] in you you have the assurance
[1:09:52] that if there is something you can do
[1:09:55] it's going to be there for you
[1:09:58] and we have uh
[1:10:00] many situations in life where uh
[1:10:04] even the doctors can do anything
[1:10:08] then what can you do
[1:10:14] oh yeah often times uh
[1:10:17] think about
[1:10:19] the
[1:10:21] uh joe's situation and
[1:10:25] in uh
[1:10:28] i say laura i i just came thank you
[1:10:30] enough
[1:10:31] and even if i give you my life
[1:10:35] 100 to the to the ministry i i will not
[1:10:39] be able to pay you for that
[1:10:41] because there is
[1:10:42] grace
[1:10:44] that moves
[1:10:46] and there was his grace that was
[1:10:49] able to remove everything
[1:10:53] we were there and the last check up and
[1:10:55] and i told the doctor say when is the
[1:10:57] next checkup he says
[1:11:00] you don't need to come back
[1:11:02] but if you want
[1:11:04] you we can do it
[1:11:07] i say
[1:11:09] i do whatever you want if you think he
[1:11:11] needs it
[1:11:13] he says i don't think he needs it but
[1:11:16] let's
[1:11:17] let's see him again in two years
[1:11:21] but uh the moment
[1:11:23] the moment we
[1:11:25] we are
[1:11:27] let go
[1:11:28] amen
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:31] that's the moment when he takes over
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:35] i i told the lord i say lord
[1:11:37] him is yours
[1:11:41] if you want him to stay with me for more
[1:11:44] years
[1:11:46] praise the lord if you want to take it
[1:11:47] with you praise the lord
[1:11:53] it's not easy
[1:11:58] but we have to learn how to let go
[1:12:01] when to let it go
[1:12:13] writer says god doesn't afflict us or
[1:12:15] allow us to be afflicted for no reason
[1:12:19] he has wonderful purpose for all the all
[1:12:22] he does in us
[1:12:23] god is
[1:12:25] the great artist
[1:12:26] who produces the ultimate masterpieces
[1:12:30] sons and daughters
[1:12:31] in the likeness of his son jesus christ
[1:12:34] so he makes us every stroke
[1:12:36] of the masters brush
[1:12:37] every top
[1:12:39] of the sculptures
[1:12:40] chisel count
[1:12:43] do you think the piece of wood is
[1:12:46] having fun when the
[1:12:47] is carving in there
[1:12:49] i mean obviously it's a dead wood but it
[1:12:51] might hurt
[1:12:54] just
[1:12:55] put your finger and smash it
[1:12:58] i mean it's a process
[1:13:01] and how many times we've been singing to
[1:13:03] be like jesus
[1:13:06] we sing that out loud
[1:13:09] but when the first
[1:13:10] trial comes we don't want to be like him
[1:13:16] i i take that back you know but when we
[1:13:19] see him
[1:13:20] sitting on the on the throne
[1:13:23] we want to be like jesus right even john
[1:13:26] says
[1:13:27] lord can you let me sit right next to
[1:13:29] you
[1:13:31] but when he when he saw him
[1:13:35] going through those hardships where he
[1:13:36] was
[1:13:39] even peter was i think peter was the
[1:13:41] closest and he'd deny him
[1:13:44] because they ran away you know we have
[1:13:47] to face or
[1:13:48] raise alone
[1:13:52] even jesus said lord
[1:13:55] why does forsaken me
[1:13:57] but you know what
[1:14:01] forgive me for what i'm going to say but
[1:14:02] he was a working process too
[1:14:05] he had to prove himself that he was
[1:14:07] worth what he was sent for
[1:14:10] he had to face it alone
[1:14:13] because god god knew that he was able to
[1:14:15] do it
[1:14:17] and that's the reason he left him alone
[1:14:19] because we had to go in some areas we
[1:14:22] have to go alone
[1:14:25] but god has
[1:14:26] the confidence in you
[1:14:28] that you're gonna make it over there
[1:14:32] he never
[1:14:34] he never complained obviously as human
[1:14:37] he he he cried he sweat he
[1:14:40] he bled
[1:14:41] but you know what he wasn't complaining
[1:14:42] what i'm doing today is why
[1:14:47] we have to go through a process
[1:14:50] if you want to become a lawyer you have
[1:14:52] to go to school and pass all the tests
[1:14:56] you want to be an accountant you have to
[1:14:58] pass all the tests
[1:15:02] you want to be a christ-like you have to
[1:15:03] pass all the tests
[1:15:08] that's the way it is
[1:15:11] we we
[1:15:13] it doesn't matter how rich is your dad
[1:15:14] so he can pay you the certificate
[1:15:19] no it doesn't count
[1:15:21] you know there was a story that
[1:15:24] it was two kids in the school
[1:15:27] one was rich that was poor
[1:15:30] and and the poor was had to
[1:15:33] they were pursuing
[1:15:35] the
[1:15:35] to be an architect
[1:15:38] and
[1:15:40] then
[1:15:41] years went by
[1:15:43] and all of a sudden
[1:15:44] they
[1:15:46] encount encountered themselves in a
[1:15:48] construction area
[1:15:50] and the rich guy
[1:15:53] bought the title of an architect
[1:15:56] and the poor guy he didn't have
[1:15:59] enough money to
[1:16:01] finish the course to become an architect
[1:16:04] but he put himself into work so he
[1:16:07] learned
[1:16:08] the hard way per se
[1:16:10] and then when this guy the rich guy came
[1:16:12] to him and say hi
[1:16:15] architect without title
[1:16:18] and the poor guy say hi
[1:16:20] title without architect
[1:16:27] that doesn't work here
[1:16:30] we're gonna make it
[1:16:32] we're gonna make it the way he wants us
[1:16:34] to make it
[1:16:37] david didn't ask to be a king
[1:16:41] he never in
[1:16:43] his wildest dream he never
[1:16:46] wanted to be a king
[1:16:48] to begin with
[1:16:50] he was bullied by his brother because he
[1:16:52] was tiny little boy
[1:16:56] and i'm the youngest of nine i know how
[1:16:59] hard it is
[1:17:01] so uh
[1:17:04] uh
[1:17:05] it's just a challenge
[1:17:07] in life
[1:17:08] when you get to
[1:17:10] when you you you're thinking you're
[1:17:12] getting over something and then all of a
[1:17:15] sudden there is another
[1:17:16] bump on the road
[1:17:21] it's like a non-ending
[1:17:23] cycle right
[1:17:25] but you know what
[1:17:27] we
[1:17:29] we have
[1:17:31] the proof here
[1:17:33] we have the proof
[1:17:35] that every time that a child of god was
[1:17:37] in trouble god came out of his rescue
[1:17:43] affliction deliver us from pride paul
[1:17:45] said god gave him his
[1:17:48] grievous thorn to keep him from becoming
[1:17:51] consented because of the surpassing
[1:17:54] greatness of revelations
[1:17:56] he was smart
[1:17:58] scholarship guy
[1:18:00] i mean
[1:18:02] if you are that smart i mean anyone can
[1:18:05] be puffed up
[1:18:06] yeah oh oh
[1:18:08] so and so and this and i'm
[1:18:11] but you know what god knows how to work
[1:18:13] everything
[1:18:16] he knows
[1:18:17] when to
[1:18:20] bring it up
[1:18:21] and how to keep you down
[1:18:25] why
[1:18:26] because he design us
[1:18:29] he knows what we need
[1:18:33] when we need it
[1:18:36] afflictions
[1:18:38] make us
[1:18:39] sympathetic
[1:18:40] merciful
[1:18:42] and slower to judge
[1:18:45] that's what i was saying earlier
[1:18:48] if you're suffered
[1:18:50] the fury of depression you won't assume
[1:18:52] that others were
[1:18:53] are depressed
[1:18:56] are in sin
[1:18:57] if you've been grieved by rebellious
[1:18:59] teen
[1:19:01] you'll be quick to sympathize with other
[1:19:04] struggling
[1:19:06] parents they're going through the same
[1:19:07] thing
[1:19:08] so you have that in mind oh i went
[1:19:10] through that
[1:19:12] oh i had depression oh i had this i had
[1:19:15] that
[1:19:17] you know when i went to my son's
[1:19:19] appointment last time the doctor said
[1:19:24] i want you to
[1:19:25] sign this form
[1:19:27] i said what's that for
[1:19:29] she said oh because i need to talk to
[1:19:31] him alone
[1:19:33] and make sure he doesn't have any uh
[1:19:36] uh like
[1:19:39] remember what was that
[1:19:43] not only the pressing thoughts but if uh
[1:19:46] like uh
[1:19:47] killing himself you know
[1:19:50] suicidal thoughts yeah thank you
[1:19:53] i say no
[1:19:55] because he doesn't have time for that
[1:20:01] if i know i need help i know where to go
[1:20:05] but
[1:20:06] no he doesn't
[1:20:07] have that
[1:20:09] i said now is this
[1:20:15] has to be
[1:20:16] like or is willingly
[1:20:21] i say he's a must or is willingly think
[1:20:23] to sciences no it's will anything okay
[1:20:26] no
[1:20:27] you know
[1:20:29] every time you go to a doctor
[1:20:32] there is a chance
[1:20:34] that you're gonna if you didn't feel
[1:20:36] anything you're gonna come feeling that
[1:20:37] symptom out of there
[1:20:41] that's
[1:20:42] i mean
[1:20:44] i'm not joking sounds like a joke but
[1:20:46] i'm not joking because
[1:20:47] is the human mind
[1:20:51] and i always ask myself how many times
[1:20:54] you have heard
[1:20:56] by his tribes we are healed
[1:21:00] and that
[1:21:02] goes away
[1:21:06] this is
[1:21:08] this is what we have to fight with
[1:21:11] this
[1:21:12] stinky body
[1:21:14] you don't take a shower for two days and
[1:21:16] you don't understand yourself
[1:21:19] is
[1:21:21] that's part of
[1:21:23] the price
[1:21:26] that we have to live in we have to
[1:21:29] struggle like i said in the beginning
[1:21:31] since the day we're born
[1:21:34] we are have facing some challenges in
[1:21:37] life
[1:21:39] afflictions remind us of
[1:21:43] of
[1:21:44] the bravery of his of this life and make
[1:21:47] us long
[1:21:48] longing for heaven amen
[1:21:51] i mean this this this afflictions here
[1:21:56] is a way how god is gonna work
[1:21:59] that you don't get too comfy
[1:22:02] you know how many
[1:22:03] how many israelites didn't make it out
[1:22:05] of egypt
[1:22:06] because they got comfy in egypt
[1:22:08] they got so comfy that they got used to
[1:22:11] uh not only worshipped the idols
[1:22:14] but they got used to their food
[1:22:17] yes
[1:22:20] eating a lot of lamb and
[1:22:24] i don't know what else
[1:22:26] when they came when they came out of
[1:22:28] egypt
[1:22:31] they had to eat only mana
[1:22:35] oh how much i miss all these onions and
[1:22:38] radishes and
[1:22:39] the
[1:22:40] chicken and
[1:22:42] tacos maybe
[1:22:44] but
[1:22:46] you know what that's part of the the the
[1:22:48] plan of god
[1:22:49] so he sends us some afflictions or allow
[1:22:52] us
[1:22:53] to have some afflictions so we don't get
[1:22:56] too comfy
[1:22:58] because the moment we get comfortable
[1:23:00] here
[1:23:01] that's the moment we're losing the
[1:23:03] vision
[1:23:05] that we are pilgrims here
[1:23:13] because in heaven is our treasure or
[1:23:15] true treasure
[1:23:17] when things go
[1:23:19] as much or wish our hearts are too prone
[1:23:21] to say
[1:23:23] it's good to be here
[1:23:25] but you know what
[1:23:28] when you
[1:23:30] if we have the chance that brother
[1:23:31] brennan had the chance to see a little
[1:23:34] bit over
[1:23:36] the curtain of time
[1:23:38] i can guarantee you you don't want to
[1:23:40] come back here
[1:23:42] painting baseboards and
[1:23:44] farming and
[1:23:46] dealing with customers here and there i
[1:23:48] mean it's
[1:23:51] is
[1:23:53] this is what we
[1:23:55] the reason we are
[1:23:57] serving the lord because we want to get
[1:23:59] out of here
[1:24:03] we want to get out of here
[1:24:05] uh i don't know if i told you this uh
[1:24:07] how many here's no sister connie in try
[1:24:09] cities
[1:24:10] not many but
[1:24:12] sister honey connie had uh
[1:24:15] her husband died a few
[1:24:18] months ago
[1:24:21] he was a heavy person
[1:24:23] and uh
[1:24:25] he wasn't that old but because his
[1:24:27] weight i mean put him into hardship
[1:24:29] there and uh
[1:24:31] one day he fell and had
[1:24:34] really bad concussion and he never made
[1:24:36] it out
[1:24:37] he was almost okay
[1:24:40] and then
[1:24:42] one day sister connie or an evening
[1:24:46] she sister connie went see him and uh
[1:24:49] and
[1:24:50] he told her say you know what
[1:24:52] i saw myself walking again
[1:24:56] she said wow
[1:24:57] when
[1:24:58] i said last night
[1:25:00] i saw myself walking again
[1:25:03] and sister connie was like oh and how do
[1:25:07] you see yourself
[1:25:09] like you are right now or when you were
[1:25:12] young no when i was young
[1:25:15] you know what next morning he passed
[1:25:20] so
[1:25:22] i
[1:25:24] uh i always wonder
[1:25:29] what
[1:25:30] will be
[1:25:32] the process the transition
[1:25:36] between
[1:25:37] life and death
[1:25:38] that moment
[1:25:40] when you're
[1:25:41] you know on that fine line
[1:25:44] but then
[1:25:47] somehow and i don't know i'm correct on
[1:25:49] this forgive me if i'm not but
[1:25:53] something told me
[1:25:55] that in that moment
[1:25:59] the body
[1:26:01] or or the spirit let go
[1:26:03] the body
[1:26:05] so we know that the spirit has
[1:26:08] a higher calling than the body you know
[1:26:11] and and
[1:26:12] so when the spirit
[1:26:14] sees the other side he doesn't care
[1:26:17] anymore about this
[1:26:19] old body that isn't here
[1:26:22] so
[1:26:23] i thought i always thought these people
[1:26:25] might be suffering
[1:26:27] they might be hard for them to leave
[1:26:29] their relatives and then
[1:26:31] and then i heard brother uh branham
[1:26:33] saying about brother bassman he wasn't
[1:26:35] his bedtime
[1:26:36] and asked him when is the best day
[1:26:39] brother brown this is my best day of my
[1:26:41] life
[1:26:43] because we're moving to a different
[1:26:44] realm
[1:26:45] where there is no pain
[1:26:48] we're not worried about wrinkles we're
[1:26:49] not worried about
[1:26:50] uh a straight hair ladies buying a tool
[1:26:53] to getting some curlies or or vice versa
[1:26:57] you know
[1:26:58] we don't worry about that stuff
[1:27:01] right now what we have to worry is about
[1:27:04] what can it do for you sir
[1:27:07] i'm here to serve the lord how i'm going
[1:27:09] to serve the lord
[1:27:12] there it is
[1:27:15] so we have to in other words we have to
[1:27:17] be grateful for the afflictions
[1:27:20] because the afflictions
[1:27:22] are turning us into a better person
[1:27:26] not all of them are punishment
[1:27:29] nope
[1:27:31] and and like i said before maybe someone
[1:27:33] is going to come to you and say hey god
[1:27:35] is punishing you for because
[1:27:37] but you know what the important thing
[1:27:38] here is
[1:27:39] you you and god know
[1:27:41] that you're right with him
[1:27:44] that's holy cares
[1:27:46] afflictions are opportunities
[1:27:49] opportunities for christ to display his
[1:27:51] power in us
[1:27:54] how how he's going to prove he's still
[1:27:56] alive
[1:27:57] if he's not in his body he came and did
[1:28:00] his part now we have to do ours
[1:28:05] as long as we can handle things in our
[1:28:07] own strength we won't see god's power
[1:28:11] because we always rely on our abilities
[1:28:18] is when the burden gets too massive for
[1:28:21] us to he to bear that christ comes along
[1:28:24] and says hey let me take it down from
[1:28:26] you
[1:28:27] but we don't want to let it go still
[1:28:30] oh i i can handle i
[1:28:32] no you can't
[1:28:34] let him
[1:28:35] handle it for you
[1:28:38] how we're gonna do that
[1:28:42] i think the only way to do that is to
[1:28:44] recognizing
[1:28:46] that we're nothing with christ
[1:28:50] say lord
[1:28:51] i really need you here
[1:28:57] and reveals his universe sustaining
[1:28:59] sustaining strength but he's he said to
[1:29:02] me my grace
[1:29:04] is sufficient paul
[1:29:10] afflictions drive us
[1:29:11] to god's word how many how many
[1:29:14] experience that yeah
[1:29:16] so sometimes we we we we're so relaxed
[1:29:19] and we start forgetting about oh
[1:29:22] what is the bible where i left it last
[1:29:24] week
[1:29:26] but then it comes on affliction we know
[1:29:27] where to run
[1:29:30] this is
[1:29:31] right
[1:29:33] i might be preaching to myself here this
[1:29:34] is
[1:29:39] any we go to the
[1:29:41] oh where where does she go
[1:29:45] oh yeah that's right
[1:29:48] many are the afflictions
[1:29:50] of the righteous
[1:29:53] that's the moment when you ask yourself
[1:29:55] am i righteous
[1:30:03] afflictions prove the reality of god's
[1:30:05] grace in our lives
[1:30:07] how does
[1:30:08] how does someone endure years of
[1:30:10] sickness and yet continue to be joyful
[1:30:13] how does a wife lose her husband to
[1:30:15] cancer yet join the saints follow
[1:30:17] following sunday
[1:30:19] and leave her hands in worship
[1:30:21] what makes us makes her husband care for
[1:30:23] his anxiety wife
[1:30:26] and continue to love god
[1:30:29] god's amazing grace
[1:30:34] and due to afflictions is evidence we
[1:30:37] haven't believed somewhat some empty
[1:30:39] philosophy
[1:30:42] we believe something real
[1:30:46] we have hardships yeah
[1:30:49] he never call us
[1:30:52] to be safe and relax
[1:30:56] that's not the point
[1:31:00] afflictions makes us thankful when god
[1:31:02] deliver us from them
[1:31:06] call upon me
[1:31:08] the day of trouble
[1:31:11] i will deliver you
[1:31:13] and you shall glorify me psalms 50
[1:31:17] 15.
[1:31:18] afflictions produce unique fruit that
[1:31:21] doesn't grow in other soil
[1:31:27] we want to produce fruit right yes
[1:31:31] get ready
[1:31:33] because we we need afflictions for
[1:31:36] to get to the
[1:31:39] point
[1:31:40] where god says
[1:31:41] i'm proud of you
[1:31:43] and he he
[1:31:45] and if the enemy comes in challenging
[1:31:46] god about you
[1:31:49] he's not going to say wait a minute let
[1:31:50] me get him ready
[1:31:52] no he's preparing you not right now
[1:31:56] now it's up to us
[1:31:58] if we quit
[1:32:01] because god ain't gonna quit until you
[1:32:03] quit
[1:32:05] he knows we're a work in progress
[1:32:08] he didn't save us yesterday to become
[1:32:10] perfect today
[1:32:12] no it's a work in progress
[1:32:15] but as a natural life is telling us or
[1:32:17] teaching us that a baby is not baby all
[1:32:20] these years
[1:32:22] he grows
[1:32:23] so as a christian we have to grow to
[1:32:28] that's that's that's the reality
[1:32:31] we don't we don't we
[1:32:33] we're not gonna
[1:32:35] stay
[1:32:36] baby
[1:32:37] diapers all these years maybe one day we
[1:32:40] need him but not right now
[1:32:42] i mean is is
[1:32:45] it's just the natural life is teaching
[1:32:47] us how the spiritual life
[1:32:50] has got to be
[1:32:51] because i heard a lot of people how are
[1:32:54] you doing brothers
[1:32:55] oh you know i'm hanging in there
[1:32:58] yeah
[1:32:59] i always complain oh this and that and
[1:33:02] that
[1:33:04] what good you got out of the complaining
[1:33:06] all the time
[1:33:07] what is he helping you
[1:33:09] because
[1:33:10] i saw you
[1:33:11] last month and you say the same thing
[1:33:13] you i'm asking you today are you still
[1:33:15] saying the same thing
[1:33:18] that tells me that he hasn't had an
[1:33:20] experience with the lord that's it
[1:33:25] amen
[1:33:28] i'm not here throwing stones to anybody
[1:33:32] i i said it already i might be preaching
[1:33:33] to myself this morning but
[1:33:36] when when
[1:33:37] when we
[1:33:40] when we face
[1:33:42] a challenge
[1:33:45] first
[1:33:46] we have to
[1:33:48] know
[1:33:49] how
[1:33:50] how we are spiritually
[1:33:52] we have to judge yourself you don't need
[1:33:54] to wait to someone come judge you
[1:33:58] we have the way how to
[1:34:01] compare your life to and okay lord
[1:34:04] if i have any made any mistake please
[1:34:08] forgive me lord but as far as i can see
[1:34:10] as far as i can remember i think i'm
[1:34:11] right with you lord
[1:34:14] so that's that's that's the first step
[1:34:16] we have to do because afflictions are
[1:34:19] going to come
[1:34:22] god is not going to stop him for you
[1:34:24] we have to go through those
[1:34:26] because he's preparing us
[1:34:32] afflictions produce unique fruit that
[1:34:34] doesn't grow another kind of soil
[1:34:38] fruits like there you go
[1:34:40] faith
[1:34:42] patience
[1:34:44] perseverance
[1:34:46] gentleness
[1:34:48] lung suffering
[1:34:51] how are we going to produce those fruits
[1:34:54] it's not going to come
[1:35:00] just hand it to you like this
[1:35:01] no
[1:35:04] it's gonna come through
[1:35:07] suffering
[1:35:11] suffering
[1:35:16] afflictions manifest god's
[1:35:19] faithfulness
[1:35:21] and may mighty sustaining power
[1:35:25] for i am sure that neither death or life
[1:35:29] nor angels no rulers no things present
[1:35:31] nor things to come nor powers and our
[1:35:34] high power not depth
[1:35:36] nor anything else in all creation will
[1:35:39] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:35:40] god
[1:35:46] are we
[1:35:50] part of those
[1:35:51] plants of god
[1:35:53] i mean we we we were called each and
[1:35:55] every one of us being called to do
[1:35:57] something
[1:36:01] and until
[1:36:04] today i haven't found out yet but
[1:36:06] here i am trying to do my best
[1:36:09] finally afflictions make us like christ
[1:36:13] god's ultimate goal is to conform
[1:36:16] conform us to his son
[1:36:18] so that we can enjoy
[1:36:20] enjoy him forever
[1:36:22] so ultimately afflictions are for
[1:36:24] eternal joy and gladness in jesus christ
[1:36:29] i was just thinking about
[1:36:31] the life
[1:36:32] of jesus
[1:36:34] when
[1:36:36] he
[1:36:38] he was
[1:36:40] feeding all the people he was
[1:36:43] healing
[1:36:45] the people
[1:36:47] and
[1:36:49] all of a sudden when he
[1:36:53] started
[1:36:54] sharing his
[1:36:57] high revelation to the people
[1:37:00] how the people start walking away from
[1:37:01] him
[1:37:04] so
[1:37:05] in other words
[1:37:08] having a church full of people doesn't
[1:37:10] mean love the lord
[1:37:14] doesn't mean
[1:37:15] they're
[1:37:19] 100 committed to the lord
[1:37:24] and
[1:37:27] the only ones who
[1:37:30] who stay with him even in a hiding place
[1:37:34] from time to time
[1:37:35] but they will they're always willing to
[1:37:38] pursue the his uh teachings
[1:37:42] he came back to them
[1:37:44] so as long as we stay put on the post of
[1:37:48] duty
[1:37:52] he's gonna
[1:37:54] sometimes you don't see it
[1:37:57] but you know what he he never leave us
[1:38:01] he's going to be there for you
[1:38:03] in time of trouble
[1:38:05] he's going to be there for you
[1:38:09] god
[1:38:11] god never
[1:38:14] never
[1:38:14] does something without
[1:38:17] seeing the finished product
[1:38:19] so he never
[1:38:22] create
[1:38:23] a bunch of people with a without purpose
[1:38:28] because we're members of his body
[1:38:32] and every body has different members and
[1:38:35] each member has an importance
[1:38:38] an important play a role to play
[1:38:43] and and sometimes i ask that myself lord
[1:38:46] what i'm doing here what do you want me
[1:38:48] to do
[1:38:50] but uh
[1:38:52] i know those are thoughts from the enemy
[1:38:55] because as long as
[1:38:57] i can do the best whatever i have to do
[1:39:00] the best way i can do it
[1:39:02] is just to
[1:39:05] let god
[1:39:07] do his thing amen
[1:39:12] i i just
[1:39:15] i just can't imagine my life without
[1:39:17] christ
[1:39:20] i tried
[1:39:22] didn't work out
[1:39:25] i think i'll give you that testimony the
[1:39:26] other day here
[1:39:31] and and
[1:39:32] and like the song says why me lord
[1:39:36] this is mercy
[1:39:38] it's his mercy that you're here in this
[1:39:40] place today
[1:39:43] because there is so many people out
[1:39:45] there
[1:39:46] that had the chance to hear the good
[1:39:49] news
[1:39:51] but they just ignore it
[1:39:53] they just want to commit themselves
[1:39:56] to the lord not to you not the pastor
[1:39:59] because many of them nowadays
[1:40:01] and thanks to those
[1:40:04] televangelistic
[1:40:05] programs
[1:40:07] every time you go to to
[1:40:09] talk about the lord someone said no
[1:40:11] because they you want me to help you to
[1:40:13] uh
[1:40:14] feed the pastor
[1:40:16] oh you want me to help you to get a new
[1:40:18] card to the pastor
[1:40:20] that's not a thing
[1:40:23] you know i i i met pastors in mexico
[1:40:26] they they didn't have a donkey
[1:40:29] and they were happy pastors
[1:40:33] because when
[1:40:34] that's that's a pastor because many can
[1:40:36] call themselves pastors because
[1:40:39] a good pastor
[1:40:41] shepherd
[1:40:43] he's not expecting anything out of the
[1:40:46] he is expecting from the lord he's doing
[1:40:48] the job for the lord now he's not
[1:40:50] working for you he's working for the
[1:40:52] lord
[1:40:56] so
[1:40:57] i think
[1:40:59] i think i said enough today
[1:41:01] but i want to say one more thing here
[1:41:04] that
[1:41:06] when
[1:41:08] when you
[1:41:11] when you come in
[1:41:13] in a
[1:41:14] position
[1:41:15] where you question yourself about
[1:41:19] should i quit
[1:41:23] just go back to the scriptures
[1:41:26] oh wait a minute satan you're talking to
[1:41:29] me now
[1:41:30] but you know what the bible says
[1:41:32] many are the afflictions
[1:41:35] but god is gonna deliver me
[1:41:38] and i know i'm gonna have more after
[1:41:40] this
[1:41:41] but i know god is gonna deliver me
[1:41:45] so
[1:41:48] i uh
[1:41:50] i would like i would like you to go out
[1:41:52] of this
[1:41:53] building today
[1:41:54] the way many people come out of the
[1:41:56] doctor's appointment
[1:41:58] the doctor said oh you have this
[1:42:00] headache you have that backache and then
[1:42:03] you're coming out of the dog
[1:42:07] why are you
[1:42:07] where you walking oh the doctor says i
[1:42:09] have a bad back
[1:42:11] okay
[1:42:14] you know
[1:42:14] the bible says we're gonna have
[1:42:18] tribulations
[1:42:20] yeah but
[1:42:22] guess what
[1:42:24] he already he paid the biggest price
[1:42:26] well we're gonna have to pay
[1:42:28] i think is meaningless
[1:42:31] we we we're
[1:42:36] there is no way we can match that
[1:42:39] i think we have a bargain
[1:42:41] right
[1:42:43] we just take what we have
[1:42:45] and give to the rest of the people
[1:42:49] we receive
[1:42:52] uh
[1:42:53] a freely
[1:42:55] gift
[1:42:57] salvation is free
[1:42:59] we're saved by grace not about works so
[1:43:03] he paid the price so you and i can be
[1:43:04] saved
[1:43:05] but now you pay the price to take the
[1:43:07] salvation you have
[1:43:09] to someone else
[1:43:13] and sometimes that is not going to be an
[1:43:14] easy task
[1:43:17] but
[1:43:19] hey
[1:43:23] we have
[1:43:28] a good
[1:43:30] good very very good
[1:43:32] uh example
[1:43:34] that he made it
[1:43:38] through the hardships
[1:43:40] he bled
[1:43:43] he sweat
[1:43:44] with blood
[1:43:47] a lot of tears
[1:43:48] a lot of agony
[1:43:50] so you and i can be free amen
[1:43:54] just just think about
[1:43:57] just think about uh
[1:44:00] the brother the story but brother martin
[1:44:02] said that
[1:44:03] this uh caller man was looking at
[1:44:05] abraham's lincoln's clothing
[1:44:07] he saw some blood stains in there
[1:44:10] and he was crying just because
[1:44:14] what that man did
[1:44:16] just imagine what jesus did for you and
[1:44:19] i
[1:44:20] and it was abraham lincoln just paying
[1:44:22] the price for the
[1:44:24] just to get him out of the slavery here
[1:44:27] but jesus christ paid the price so we
[1:44:29] can get out of the
[1:44:31] sinful life
[1:44:33] and go to
[1:44:34] spend the rest
[1:44:38] so we can have life
[1:44:42] just to be just to close with this
[1:44:45] a pastor was a interview with the news
[1:44:48] lady
[1:44:50] and this lady told the pastor to say
[1:44:52] pastor i've been hanging around with a
[1:44:54] lot of people that they're skeptic
[1:44:56] people and unbelievers and they
[1:44:58] just don't believe
[1:45:00] that there is a life after death
[1:45:03] and uh
[1:45:04] and she said let's pretend i don't
[1:45:06] believe in nothing
[1:45:08] let's pretend i
[1:45:10] don't know nothing and you come to me
[1:45:12] trying to
[1:45:15] preaching to me
[1:45:16] a life after death
[1:45:19] how how would you
[1:45:22] come up to me
[1:45:24] with such thing like that
[1:45:26] and this this is a very very calm
[1:45:29] baptist uh
[1:45:30] i think it's a adventist pastor very
[1:45:33] very calm
[1:45:34] he has seems to have nice spirit
[1:45:37] he's brazilian
[1:45:39] and he said let's pretend
[1:45:43] uh
[1:45:45] you and i
[1:45:47] get to the end of the road
[1:45:50] and
[1:45:51] you die i die
[1:45:55] and
[1:45:57] there is no heaven
[1:45:58] there is no god
[1:46:01] there is
[1:46:03] nothing
[1:46:04] else
[1:46:06] what did i lose
[1:46:11] i lose nothing
[1:46:13] but let's turn in the other way
[1:46:17] if i preach to you there's a heaven
[1:46:19] there is a god that is of life after
[1:46:21] this
[1:46:24] when you die and i die and if it is real
[1:46:27] what did you lose
[1:46:31] everything
[1:46:34] yeah
[1:46:36] you know what she said
[1:46:38] she shake her head and go like
[1:46:44] brother and sister
[1:46:47] it's no brainer because this building
[1:46:49] didn't build by itself
[1:46:52] it had to be a builder
[1:46:57] the bible says that god
[1:46:59] created heavens and earth
[1:47:03] in the beginning
[1:47:04] he created them all
[1:47:06] and an english version says that the the
[1:47:08] the earth was void right
[1:47:11] but the spanish version says was messy
[1:47:15] that's what the spanish version says
[1:47:20] and the earth was a mess
[1:47:25] and because
[1:47:27] god wasn't in this arab before
[1:47:31] god was up there
[1:47:33] so he created the heavens and earth
[1:47:36] and because god was coming down
[1:47:39] it was a mess
[1:47:41] and when you and i without christ we are
[1:47:43] a mess
[1:47:47] that's the truth
[1:47:48] amen i don't know if you get musicians
