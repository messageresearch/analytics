[34:35] all the more if you'll stand with me
[34:40] amen i'd like you to turn with me in
[34:42] your bibles to
[34:44] first john
[34:47] chapter 2.
[34:50] for one of the scriptures here i have i
[34:53] have a few here tonight but
[34:55] i don't plan to take too long i was had
[34:57] something i had in my heart to
[34:59] and i know a minister understands this
[35:01] but i had something in my heart i
[35:02] thought
[35:02] for sure the lord wanted me and what he
[35:04] gave me was beautiful
[35:06] but then right the last hour
[35:10] of studying there or less he turned me
[35:13] around to this so
[35:14] i've just got a few things just written
[35:16] on a piece of paper
[35:18] and then i had some had to grab some
[35:20] books here so
[35:21] you just forgive me if i go the
[35:23] old-fashioned way a little bit
[35:25] and read the message book
[35:29] and i just uh it's okay if we write it
[35:32] out on a
[35:32] on uh here to read i've got a few things
[35:35] right here i've got did get printed but
[35:38] but um i'm just thankful for the grace
[35:41] of god
[35:41] aren't you his grace is sufficient
[35:45] in first john
[35:48] chapter two and starting with verse
[35:51] three
[35:52] and hereby we
[35:55] do know that we know him isn't that
[35:59] lovely
[36:00] i mean he knows him this is more than an
[36:03] intellectual knowledge this is a
[36:05] relationship
[36:06] and hereby we do know that we know him
[36:10] if we keep his commandments
[36:14] he that saith i know him and keepeth not
[36:17] his commandments
[36:19] is a liar and the truth
[36:22] is not in him and the truth
[36:26] who is the truth jesus said i am the way
[36:29] i am the truth we know and the life and
[36:32] we know that he is truth
[36:34] and the truth or other words himself
[36:36] liveth not in you
[36:38] amen because you can't keep god's
[36:40] commandments
[36:41] in your own flesh the idea and thinking
[36:44] of your own power
[36:45] it takes the holy ghost who wrote this
[36:47] word to come in and live that word
[36:49] amen and keep it right and so let me
[36:52] read it again hereby we do know that we
[36:54] know him if we keep his commandments
[36:56] and he that saith i know him and keepeth
[36:59] not his commandments
[37:00] is a liar that's you say that's pretty
[37:01] strong well the word just
[37:03] goes right to point doesn't it amen we
[37:06] should talk plain too
[37:08] amen in love of course but how if you
[37:11] keep his commandments
[37:13] you have his love hallelujah amen
[37:16] all right so he's a liar and the truth
[37:19] is not in him but who so keepeth his
[37:21] word
[37:22] comma it's important you see that comma
[37:25] there
[37:26] he that saith i know him and
[37:30] keepeth not his commandment oh i'm sorry
[37:33] i had the wrong comma but anyway it's a
[37:34] good comma
[37:36] that's i want the next verse he that
[37:38] saith i know him
[37:39] and keepeth not his commandments is a
[37:42] liar excuse me i was on the right verse
[37:44] i just read that again didn't i
[37:46] verse 5 because it's just about but
[37:48] whoso
[37:49] keepeth his word comma
[37:52] in him verily is the love of god
[37:56] perfected amen hereby
[38:00] know we oh hallelujah
[38:03] hereby know we that we are in
[38:06] him then who are you okay
[38:10] hereby know we that we are in
[38:13] him let me read this again whoso keepeth
[38:16] his word
[38:17] in him verily is the love of god
[38:19] perfected
[38:21] hereby know we that we are in him he
[38:24] that
[38:24] saith he abideth this isn't this isn't
[38:27] just
[38:27] this isn't just out here in the in the
[38:30] sanctified realm of your spirit
[38:32] this is on the inside of the inside he
[38:34] that saith he abideth in him
[38:37] ought himself also to walk even
[38:40] as he walked why
[38:43] it's your life all right i'd like you to
[38:47] go with me over to philippians 2.
[38:50] philippians 2.
[39:08] chapter 2 and verse
[39:12] verse 13. for it
[39:15] is god which worketh
[39:19] in you both to will
[39:23] and to do
[39:27] of his good pleasure that's a powerful
[39:29] scripture
[39:32] for it is god which worketh in you
[39:35] let's look back to what we just read for
[39:37] it is god which worketh in you
[39:40] both to will and to do of his good
[39:43] pleasure and remember
[39:44] he's sovereign
[39:47] all right do all things
[39:51] without murmurings and
[39:54] disputings that we how can we have
[39:58] why should we have to murmur if we know
[40:00] god is working in us
[40:03] everything is controlled
[40:07] it's ordered of him amen how many
[40:10] believe that
[40:11] i believe god has that preeminence
[40:17] amen remember there is no fear in love
[40:22] all right do all things without
[40:24] murmurings and disputings
[40:28] that you may be blameless and harmless
[40:32] the sons of god
[40:35] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[40:37] and perverse
[40:38] nation in whom you shine
[40:41] as lights in the world
[40:45] holding forth the word of life
[40:50] that i may rejoice in the day of christ
[40:54] that i have not run in vain neither
[40:57] labored
[40:58] in vain you may be seated turn with me
[41:01] to one more scripture for the beginning
[41:02] here in galatians
[41:05] chapter five
[41:23] and we'll read here
[41:26] verse 1 first stand fast
[41:31] therefore in the liberty
[41:35] wherewith christ hath made us free
[41:38] and be not entangled again with the yoke
[41:41] of bondage i want to come down here to
[41:44] verse
[41:45] 5 for we through the spirit
[41:49] wait for the hope of righteousness by
[41:52] faith
[41:53] for in jesus christ neither
[41:56] circumcision availeth anything nor
[41:58] uncircumcision
[42:00] but faith which worketh
[42:03] by love let me say that again
[42:07] but faith
[42:11] that which worketh by love
[42:14] amen amen
[42:17] all right praise the lord
[42:20] in the church age book on page 118
[42:25] he said this
[42:29] let me just start up here just a little
[42:31] bit ahead of this
[42:32] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[42:35] no signs of god's disapproval
[42:43] the cloudy skies and storms of this life
[42:45] you're going to have storms and you're
[42:46] going to have cloudy skies
[42:52] you're going to have trials you're going
[42:54] to have tribulations
[42:56] you're going to have testings and life
[42:58] in this life is going to be a struggle
[43:04] but it depends on how you are
[43:07] what you do with them and that depends
[43:11] on what's
[43:11] in you in the soul
[43:15] amen all right all right so
[43:18] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[43:20] no signs of god's disapproval neither
[43:22] are bright skies and still water
[43:24] signs of his love and approval
[43:28] his approval of any of us is only in the
[43:31] beloved you
[43:32] have been accepted the bible said in
[43:35] christ
[43:36] you believe that amen
[43:39] right then what then where's the
[43:41] murmuring
[43:44] see you've been accepted you have been
[43:48] let's put it this way you've been
[43:49] pre-approved
[43:53] you have been approved in christ
[43:57] everything you need has been provided in
[43:59] him
[44:00] he with you in him was perfected by
[44:04] sufferings the prophet said
[44:05] amen he was perfected and because he was
[44:08] perfected what are you going to do
[44:10] you have to come to that perfection with
[44:12] him in you
[44:14] the same spirit that was is him is in
[44:16] you doing the same works because what
[44:19] was embodied in him working his work
[44:22] through him
[44:23] is now embodied in you
[44:26] is that right it's now embodied in you
[44:29] let me
[44:30] let me just get this right here real
[44:32] quick and just i'll just show it to you
[44:33] how the prophet
[44:34] said it so you'll understand
[44:37] and and i'm not just saying that because
[44:41] i believe
[44:42] but it becomes reality to an individual
[44:45] amen it's not a man it's not just a
[44:49] preacher it's not a certain congregation
[44:51] it's the holy spirit showing the same
[44:53] things it did when it was embodied in
[44:55] the body of jesus christ
[44:58] he said he said see the action of the
[45:00] great holy spirit see him come down
[45:02] visible before people even take
[45:04] pictures of it see it's working and
[45:07] showing it's not a man
[45:08] not a preacher not a congregation
[45:10] certain congregation it's the holy
[45:11] spirit
[45:12] the same thing it did it's the holy
[45:14] spirit showing the same thing it did
[45:16] when it was embodied in the body of
[45:18] jesus christ now
[45:19] it's embodied in the body of his bride
[45:23] it should showa throw us into
[45:25] desperation
[45:27] amen amen
[45:30] and so he goes on to say here his he
[45:32] said we're accepted
[45:34] where our approval is only in the
[45:36] beloved
[45:37] his love is elective which he had for us
[45:40] before the foundation of the world
[45:43] does he love us notice his love is
[45:45] elective
[45:47] jacob i loved
[45:50] he saw i hated he loved jacob before
[45:54] jacob did any works
[45:56] anything why did jacob want the
[45:59] birthright
[46:00] why did he desire the birthright more
[46:02] than anything it was god working in him
[46:05] it was the seed working in him
[46:08] he said i love jacob because jacob was
[46:10] in me before the foundation of the world
[46:12] jacob's my seed jacob held the seed
[46:17] all right so he said his love is
[46:20] elective when he
[46:21] which he had be for us before the
[46:23] foundation
[46:24] of the world does he love us
[46:27] oh yes but how shall we know we shall
[46:30] know because he said so
[46:32] amen and manifested that he did and
[46:35] manifested
[46:36] that he did love us for he brought us to
[46:38] himself
[46:40] amen he brought us to himself you didn't
[46:43] have that ability
[46:44] you did not have the ability to go out
[46:46] searching for god you weren't searching
[46:48] for god
[46:49] god searched for you and he found you
[46:55] amen remember how he gave the
[46:56] illustration of the eagle flying around
[46:58] he finally found the barnyard whereas
[47:00] where his genome where the gene of him
[47:02] of itself was right
[47:05] amen all right and he said and that gene
[47:08] that
[47:09] that that germ that was to be you he
[47:11] said before the foundation of the world
[47:13] find you so that germ that was to be you
[47:16] was
[47:16] eternal so that germ that was to be you
[47:18] was god
[47:19] so that germ comes and finds you you
[47:22] can't hide
[47:23] you can't run far enough he'll find you
[47:26] but he'll find you through the word of
[47:28] promise for this hour
[47:29] he'll find you through the ministering
[47:31] of that faith
[47:33] he'll lead you to that there you
[47:35] stumbled along brother branham said one
[47:37] day you've you
[47:38] stumbled along into a congregation you
[47:39] heard the word of your salvation
[47:41] and you accepted it he said not what led
[47:44] you to that
[47:45] you were just stumbling along you
[47:47] thought you were stumbling but your
[47:48] steps were ordered
[47:50] all right so he goes on to say he
[47:52] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[47:54] spirit
[47:55] proving he loved us placing us as sons
[48:00] and how that's what i want to get to
[48:01] right here and how
[48:03] shall i prove or project
[48:06] my subject tonight is love
[48:09] projected amen the love of god
[48:13] i'm not talking about an affiliate i'm
[48:15] talking about an agape love
[48:17] which i which we do a filial love and we
[48:20] believe there's a filial love
[48:22] but if it's not governed by agape love
[48:24] of filial love is in vain
[48:27] amen hey man you can have a feeling of
[48:31] love for your wife you have a feeling of
[48:33] love for one another
[48:34] but it's but if it's not backed up by
[48:35] agape love just like he said you can
[48:38] you can prophesy you can speak in
[48:39] tongues with men and angels you can know
[48:41] all
[48:41] you have all know all mysteries have all
[48:44] knowledge
[48:46] feed the poor give your body to be
[48:48] burned
[48:49] and have not charity that's godly divine
[48:53] love that's god's own love
[48:54] and have not charity it's all in vain
[49:00] amen i'm not saying god won't won't
[49:03] won't judge it someday at the white
[49:04] throne but we're not talking about us
[49:06] standing at
[49:07] before the judgment at the white throne
[49:09] we're talking about us standing
[49:11] next in his our position as queen at the
[49:14] white throne
[49:15] judging so we're talking about making
[49:19] the rapture
[49:21] amen amen you can't produce any sort of
[49:25] thing
[49:25] at all to break the rapture it takes god
[49:28] working in you
[49:29] and that's elective love he had that
[49:32] love for you and he said how do i prove
[49:34] my love to him
[49:36] watch this now by believing what he said
[49:39] faith and what he said by believing what
[49:42] he said
[49:44] and by conducting myself with joy
[49:47] watch the conduct here's the faith that
[49:50] believes what he says
[49:51] but if it's a real faith in believing
[49:53] what he said it'll act upon what he said
[49:57] amen because because of what because of
[50:00] the love of god
[50:01] in your hearts shed and put there by god
[50:04] himself
[50:05] you can't have the love of god in your
[50:07] soul without god being there
[50:12] amen all right so he said he said so
[50:16] to prove the love i believe what he said
[50:19] and by conducting myself with joy
[50:23] not poochy lips joy
[50:26] not murmuring joy you say well you just
[50:30] don't understand brother david all this
[50:31] stuff that come around it was my fault
[50:33] no god allowed it to be your fault then
[50:36] god allowed it
[50:39] i didn't get an amen on that
[50:42] but i've got a quote here i'm going to
[50:44] read you in a few minutes it'll
[50:45] it's absolutely send you exactly where
[50:48] you need to be in believing that
[50:50] god orders our way you may think you're
[50:54] ordering your way but if you're in
[50:55] christ dead to yourself
[50:57] god's alive in you and you may wonder
[50:59] why you're going through these things he
[51:01] allowed it for a purpose
[51:03] for you by those trials and tests to
[51:06] manifest and express his love
[51:11] amen all right how do i prove my love to
[51:14] him
[51:14] by believing what he said and by
[51:16] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[51:18] trials oh now the next
[51:20] now the next uh sentence that he
[51:25] the trials that he in his wisdom
[51:29] allows to come to pass
[51:35] hallelujah all right all right
[51:38] see we think we thought we thought
[51:43] he said we know that did you love jacob
[51:46] he did esau he said yet i love jacob and
[51:48] he said and lay and esau i hated i laid
[51:50] his mountains in heritage the waste the
[51:52] dragons the wilderness you see they
[51:53] could not figure out
[51:55] god's love they thought that love meant
[51:57] no suffering
[51:59] they thought love meant a baby with
[52:01] parental care
[52:02] but god said my love is elective love
[52:06] the proof of his love is election his
[52:07] love was proven by the truly by the fact
[52:10] that you were chosen of salvation
[52:12] because god had chosen you to salvation
[52:14] through the sanctification of the spirit
[52:16] and belief of the truth
[52:18] he may commit you to death as he did
[52:20] paul he may commit you to suffering as
[52:22] he did job
[52:23] that is his prerogative he is
[52:26] sovereign but it is all with a purpose
[52:30] hallelujah you cannot move out of his
[52:34] eternal purpose
[52:36] for you you can't get out of that when
[52:38] you're filled with him you're not going
[52:40] to get out of that eternal purpose
[52:42] i don't care what you think you might be
[52:44] going through
[52:45] he has ordered that by his wisdom and he
[52:47] wants you and it gives you that
[52:49] opportunity
[52:50] then to project that love by believing
[52:53] what he said
[52:54] and conducting yourself with joy amidst
[52:56] the trials that he and his wisdom has
[53:00] allowed to come to pass
[53:02] hallelujah if i yell at you like like a
[53:05] brother we were talking in there you
[53:06] know
[53:06] i sound like a lion roaring that's
[53:09] because my middle name is leon
[53:12] and leon means lion-like
[53:15] so i guess and then brother jason said
[53:17] you might as well let you in go out of
[53:19] the gate right now and go preaching
[53:21] because
[53:21] and i guess i was kind of roaring at him
[53:26] all right he goes like is he gone i
[53:29] thought well
[53:30] i am what i am by the grace of god
[53:34] and i said you are what you are i may
[53:36] not like what you are
[53:38] but
[53:41] but i'm happy that my brother is what he
[53:44] is
[53:45] and i may be different but i'm happy
[53:50] all right that's right you're not like
[53:54] brother david he's really different
[53:56] well that's all right i may be
[54:00] but i love you with all my heart and i
[54:02] know i love god and i can't love you
[54:04] unless i do love god
[54:05] and i know i love god
[54:09] so quit trying to judge me by the
[54:10] outward appearance
[54:13] no i'm not saying you are but but there
[54:16] are those we judge one another by
[54:18] how just that's not the fruit we're
[54:20] looking at
[54:22] although i believe the fruit is bore if
[54:23] it's an inside life it'll bear the fruit
[54:26] but part of that fruit is when you make
[54:28] a mistake forgive me
[54:35] i said when you make a mistake
[54:38] you're going to make mistakes you're
[54:40] going to have mistakes out here
[54:42] you're going to make it but this is not
[54:43] who god identified you to be
[54:46] who god identified you to be as that
[54:48] holy ghost that's down inside of you
[54:50] and that's changing you from glory to
[54:52] glory
[54:54] you're being changed into the same image
[54:56] that you see yourself in the mirror to
[54:58] be
[55:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[55:03] that's who you see you're looking in the
[55:05] mirror with an open face
[55:07] it's no longer the veils not hiding your
[55:09] face
[55:10] now you're seeing in clear view the
[55:12] glory of god and what are you seeing
[55:14] as in a mirror as in a mirror you're
[55:16] seeing yourself
[55:17] but what are you looking at the glory of
[55:19] god
[55:20] and the lord the word says that he would
[55:22] pour out his glory upon his bride
[55:25] his bride would be his glory but he said
[55:28] he wouldn't give his glory to another
[55:30] well she's not another
[55:34] so he said my light thy light has come
[55:36] and the glory of the lord is
[55:38] risen upon her
[55:42] so because we have a perfect
[55:44] interpretation of a perfect word in this
[55:46] hour
[55:46] with divine vindication what are we
[55:48] looking at we're looking at uh
[55:50] at the at the on with an unveiled face
[55:54] we're seeing exactly who we are he's
[55:56] brought us into the inside of the inside
[56:03] we've come into the inside of the inside
[56:06] all right well i'm a little ahead of
[56:07] myself here but
[56:08] let's we'll go on right from that just a
[56:10] moment
[56:11] all right so his love it's his
[56:14] prerogative
[56:15] he all has a purpose with it he doesn't
[56:18] do it he's not the author of frustration
[56:21] he has a plan he has a purpose in why he
[56:24] allows you to go through things he has a
[56:25] plan a purpose
[56:28] but what are you doing murmuring
[56:31] complaining that you have to go through
[56:32] it
[56:33] you just need a little more you need a
[56:35] little more love projected to you
[56:38] you need a little come in a little
[56:39] deeper come in a little deeper you say
[56:42] well
[56:42] brother david what are you trying to say
[56:44] come into the reality of who you
[56:46] are and then you won't have no for fear
[56:49] of your mistakes and your sufferings and
[56:51] your
[56:51] heart and these things that are against
[56:53] it against this the greatest enemy
[56:54] you've got is this man right here
[56:56] that man right there
[57:00] amen we have to die daily to this
[57:04] take up our cross to see jesus christ
[57:06] manifested
[57:10] amen
[57:12] where in your body
[57:15] where manifested where in your flesh
[57:19] you're bearing about the daddy dying of
[57:22] the of the lord daily
[57:24] that the life also of jesus might be
[57:28] made manifest
[57:28] in your mortal flesh your mortal body
[57:31] the scripture said is that right
[57:33] so how's that going to happen you have
[57:35] to dock to yourself
[57:36] daily take
[57:40] up your cross by love
[57:44] follow this word all right
[57:47] now see we know faith works by
[57:52] love
[57:56] brother brown said in the message why
[57:58] are people so tossed about he said
[58:00] the heart is the abode of god
[58:04] and he said and in the old testament god
[58:06] dwelt in his glory over the ark
[58:11] heart is the ark god dwells not in the
[58:13] head
[58:14] but in the heart
[58:17] god is not known by theology god is not
[58:19] known by mental conceptions god is known
[58:21] by an old-fashioned
[58:23] sanctified born-again experience that is
[58:25] in
[58:26] the human heart
[58:30] yet men and women haven't live a good
[58:32] life and love god by mental conception
[58:34] but the real hiding that watch they live
[58:37] a good life and even love
[58:38] god by mental conception brother branham
[58:41] said you could
[58:42] he said you could you could love god in
[58:43] your spirit
[58:46] even love god and he said and turn right
[58:50] around and be a devil on the inside of
[58:52] your soul
[58:56] that's what he said and he said you can
[58:58] have the genuine anointing of the holy
[59:00] ghost in that spirit realm
[59:02] and be exactly if it's a huckleberry in
[59:04] the soul you will live a huckleberry
[59:06] life
[59:07] by that power of the holy ghost
[59:11] because the rain come upon it what did
[59:14] what was it was sent for the wheat
[59:16] the word is that right it rain came upon
[59:19] that
[59:20] weed and that we'd live by the same life
[59:24] and could shout just as loud as any of
[59:26] us and i believe in shouting
[59:29] and can praise the lord and cast out
[59:31] devils and see miracles
[59:33] and i believe in every bit of that amen
[59:36] amen is that right you can do every bit
[59:39] of that
[59:40] you have every bit of that and that's
[59:42] fine but you know what the prophet said
[59:43] in the seventh seal
[59:44] he said i've seen he said i thank god
[59:47] for these opening of these seals
[59:48] he said this and he said that i'm just
[59:50] not saying verbatim but this is what he
[59:52] said
[59:53] he said he said i yeah thank god for the
[59:56] opening of those seals in the hour and
[59:57] this has been a tremendous blessing to
[59:59] me
[59:59] he said i've seen mighty miracles and
[1:00:02] signs and wonders
[1:00:03] he said but this is beyond that
[1:00:09] and you just stop and think about that
[1:00:10] have we done away with this not a bit
[1:00:12] not a bit we if you don't believe in
[1:00:14] signs miracles wonders there's something
[1:00:16] with your association with god something
[1:00:18] wrong
[1:00:19] is that right but he said this opening
[1:00:21] of the word
[1:00:22] brought us into a full complete
[1:00:24] revelation
[1:00:27] for the rapture amen a revelation
[1:00:30] of who we are when that book was opened
[1:00:34] it was a marriage certificate
[1:00:37] and god entered in with his wife into an
[1:00:41] invisible union
[1:00:44] and it had to be that invisible union
[1:00:46] before you could meet him in the air
[1:00:49] because that's going to the wedding
[1:00:51] supper so something happens
[1:00:53] before that wedding supper that brother
[1:00:55] branham identified in
[1:00:56] perfect love i mean proving his word and
[1:00:59] i don't know
[1:01:00] why i'm saying this because i'm entering
[1:01:03] into the thing that i had in my heart to
[1:01:05] say
[1:01:05] but i guess he's blending it into this
[1:01:09] amen
[1:01:10] all right so are you with me i haven't
[1:01:13] lost you
[1:01:15] when you enter into that that's that's
[1:01:17] an abiding place that's only an
[1:01:19] individual affair that's between you and
[1:01:22] god
[1:01:23] you don't go in there with anybody else
[1:01:25] you go in there with him
[1:01:27] you meet him you have for you have not
[1:01:30] knowing with him
[1:01:33] you have a union with him it's not done
[1:01:35] out in public
[1:01:36] it's not a public show it's not known to
[1:01:38] the public
[1:01:39] at all jesus said it doesn't come with
[1:01:42] observation
[1:01:45] and you look up that word observation it
[1:01:46] means outward show
[1:01:49] but that is beyond
[1:01:52] because it's seed time amen
[1:01:56] and we every bit of us don't you go away
[1:01:58] saying brother david doesn't believe in
[1:01:59] signs and wonders and miracles i
[1:02:01] absolutely believe it i've seen it
[1:02:03] happen our married
[1:02:04] our mary uh uh buckley here she does not
[1:02:08] go into surgery she's had surgery
[1:02:10] and she's gone through surgery and she
[1:02:13] god is really undertaken
[1:02:16] amen and so we thank god for that we
[1:02:18] several things this last few days
[1:02:20] we've seen god do i've seen god raise
[1:02:22] the dead i've seen god
[1:02:24] take take absolutely move a storm out of
[1:02:27] the way exactly by the word spoken
[1:02:30] you say i don't believe that i believe
[1:02:31] that absolutely believe that
[1:02:34] but when you enter into that inside of
[1:02:36] that inside and know that you are
[1:02:38] absolutely a seed of god
[1:02:40] and that you are and he god identifies
[1:02:42] you and you and him
[1:02:44] amen there love begins to project there
[1:02:48] you grow up there's what brother branham
[1:02:50] said is that
[1:02:52] is that is that gift the real gift
[1:02:55] that the holy ghost was sent to quicken
[1:02:57] and open up
[1:02:58] what is that what is that that's beyond
[1:03:01] that other he said what's beyond it that
[1:03:04] third poll
[1:03:06] the full opening of the word
[1:03:09] amen are you with me it opens up the
[1:03:11] word you be you see who you are
[1:03:13] you come to the reality of who you are
[1:03:18] and you couldn't deny yourself if you
[1:03:20] wanted to and god couldn't deny you
[1:03:24] you're in union with god amen
[1:03:27] all right i'm talking about love being
[1:03:30] projected
[1:03:31] all right now so and when christ
[1:03:35] when christ he says the real hiding
[1:03:37] place
[1:03:38] is in the heart hid with christ the
[1:03:41] bible said he shall hide me
[1:03:43] in the secret of his tabernacle
[1:03:47] you know in the midst the storm the ship
[1:03:48] was tossed oh they missed the storm and
[1:03:50] they were struggling against the wind
[1:03:52] oh they were struggling they were in the
[1:03:56] second realm you might say
[1:03:58] struggling against that ship that ship
[1:04:01] was tossed it was tossed this way it was
[1:04:03] tossed
[1:04:03] away but he was in the hinder part of
[1:04:06] the ship
[1:04:08] at rest on a pillow
[1:04:12] why you say how could he sleep in a time
[1:04:14] like that
[1:04:16] how could he rest in a time like that
[1:04:19] because he had entered into rest
[1:04:23] amen are you with me i kind of combined
[1:04:25] spiritual and natural there
[1:04:27] because he entered into rest and when
[1:04:29] you enter into rest
[1:04:33] when you've entered interest you cease
[1:04:35] from your own labors
[1:04:37] hallelujah and that ship can be tossed
[1:04:40] any way you want to
[1:04:41] but in there you come to realize
[1:04:43] absolutely by revelation
[1:04:45] you're growing into the very stature set
[1:04:47] of god that he said this
[1:04:49] is who you are and this is who you see
[1:04:54] hallelujah and you know who you are
[1:04:57] that's why the old ship out here can be
[1:04:59] tossed this way and that way and you're
[1:05:01] going to have
[1:05:01] tossing and the ship's going to be
[1:05:03] tossed but when you
[1:05:04] are in there
[1:05:09] you're at rest
[1:05:13] but he was in the scene and they were
[1:05:16] out there doing what
[1:05:18] they they were fighting and battling and
[1:05:20] couldn't figure out
[1:05:21] why i fight this i get up i go to a
[1:05:24] service and i'm built up tomorrow
[1:05:25] i have a struggle and i'm this and i'm
[1:05:27] dead and i can never seem to get the
[1:05:29] victory
[1:05:30] you just know to go a little farther in
[1:05:33] behind that interval
[1:05:37] let the because outside of when you're
[1:05:38] outside of there it's dark to you
[1:05:41] you can't see what's in there you can't
[1:05:44] see it it's a glass
[1:05:45] dark you still have a veil there
[1:05:48] but when you break through that veil
[1:05:51] then you see clearly who you are
[1:05:53] clearly then you grow up in christ
[1:05:56] clearly the word becomes unveiled to you
[1:05:59] and this is why the message of the
[1:06:01] opening of the seventh seal
[1:06:03] has opened to us to let us see that we
[1:06:06] are the mystery of god revealed
[1:06:08] [Applause]
[1:06:11] hallelujah that's it
[1:06:15] we are living in that revelation with
[1:06:17] that revelation in there
[1:06:18] that shekinah glory you are part of it
[1:06:22] glory to god you're not worried about
[1:06:25] this because this
[1:06:26] isn't who you are and by the revelation
[1:06:28] of who you are
[1:06:29] you control this
[1:06:32] by faith that worketh by
[1:06:35] love amen amen amen
[1:06:40] hallelujah and when christ the holy
[1:06:43] spirit comes into your heart
[1:06:44] he is in you
[1:06:47] you ready he is in you with your
[1:06:50] temperament
[1:06:55] he is in you with your temperament
[1:06:59] i don't like my temperament are you in
[1:07:01] christ
[1:07:07] well i know i've got you do have some
[1:07:09] control of your temperament
[1:07:10] if you yield it to the word that's right
[1:07:13] otherwise if you try to take it under
[1:07:14] your own hands you're just making a mess
[1:07:17] but when christ is in you know who you
[1:07:19] are and no this is not the real you
[1:07:22] but someday that real you inside will
[1:07:24] change this moral body
[1:07:26] hallelujah
[1:07:28] [Applause]
[1:07:30] he'll change it in the twinkling of an
[1:07:31] eye
[1:07:33] amen you'll be caught up and that's
[1:07:35] already working
[1:07:36] that's already begun started it's
[1:07:38] already working in you
[1:07:42] and he that has begun a good work and
[1:07:44] you
[1:07:45] will finish it boo devil
[1:07:51] he that started a good work in me will
[1:07:54] finish it
[1:07:58] because i've been ordained to those good
[1:08:00] works in me
[1:08:02] amen all right he's living
[1:08:06] his he is he is living his own life
[1:08:10] through his own will
[1:08:13] through you
[1:08:18] hallelujah i know it sounds awful
[1:08:22] but it's right that's what brother brown
[1:08:24] said i know it sounds awful but it's
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:26] what's he trying to say i know it seems
[1:08:28] contrary to the flesh
[1:08:30] but it's right he said he said
[1:08:34] but it's right christ christ he said so
[1:08:37] yielded you
[1:08:38] are that christ speaks the kinds of
[1:08:40] words he would speak
[1:08:41] he thinks the kind of thoughts he would
[1:08:43] think through you
[1:08:45] he does the kind of works he would do
[1:08:47] through you
[1:08:48] you are yielded and resting
[1:08:52] praise the lord
[1:08:56] hidden christ say all they want to about
[1:08:59] coven see all they want to about these
[1:09:00] things
[1:09:01] sell politicians they hate trump and
[1:09:03] trump hates the democrats and the
[1:09:05] democrats hate him and now of all the
[1:09:07] while everything controlled by rome
[1:09:09] anyway
[1:09:15] yes sir they're all fighting one another
[1:09:20] and they're all stirring it up to get
[1:09:22] your get your attention on that
[1:09:26] and their attention certainly is but
[1:09:28] that's not our attention
[1:09:31] that's not our attention our attention
[1:09:33] is not there
[1:09:34] our attention's on this lovely lord
[1:09:36] jesus that our focus is on
[1:09:38] listen to what he said when a man once
[1:09:41] catches the vision of the invisible god
[1:09:43] and know he's always present
[1:09:46] he said there's something that
[1:09:48] stabilizes that man's
[1:09:50] thinking
[1:09:53] does it matter what you think absolutely
[1:09:56] it matters what you think
[1:09:58] according to the word you know what i'm
[1:10:00] saying
[1:10:01] think on these things because it's a
[1:10:04] channel
[1:10:05] your thinking is a spirit realm and
[1:10:08] and god said i would manifest myself and
[1:10:10] it's a channel for his
[1:10:12] manifestation to come through because
[1:10:14] the spirit controls the body
[1:10:17] are you with me the soul controls the
[1:10:20] spirit
[1:10:20] so ultimately whatever you are in the
[1:10:23] soul will manifest itself through the
[1:10:25] body
[1:10:26] you can say what you want but the fruit
[1:10:29] of the
[1:10:29] season if the fruit of the season is not
[1:10:31] manifest
[1:10:32] it's a wrong it's a wrong spirit down in
[1:10:35] that
[1:10:36] soul say i love god
[1:10:39] and the love of god doesn't manifest
[1:10:40] what will the love of god be manifested
[1:10:43] it'll rejoice in the truth
[1:10:47] are you with me it'll rejoice in the
[1:10:49] message of the hour
[1:10:51] what else does charity do suffers long
[1:10:55] amen and his kind
[1:10:59] we could go on and on couldn't we but
[1:11:02] i'm bringing that in about suffering
[1:11:03] because people don't think that you
[1:11:05] should suffer
[1:11:06] and we don't ask for suffering and we're
[1:11:09] not out here begging some suffering
[1:11:11] we don't want suffering but its
[1:11:14] suffering is okay
[1:11:16] because it's going to glorify the lord
[1:11:18] he's got control of that
[1:11:22] amen but he's also going to see what
[1:11:26] you're going to do about it what you do
[1:11:27] about it
[1:11:29] is his love manifested because what are
[1:11:31] you going to do about it bring it
[1:11:33] under the headship of the word i don't
[1:11:36] care what the situation is
[1:11:38] okay i want to i wanna hurry along here
[1:11:40] all right now
[1:11:45] he said he said this that's there's
[1:11:47] something when a man catches a vision of
[1:11:49] visible god there's something that
[1:11:50] stabilizes a man's thinking
[1:11:52] it stabilizes his actions look at the
[1:11:55] stabilizing here
[1:11:57] who was the stabilizing of the ship that
[1:11:59] was tossed by the winds
[1:12:01] he was on the inside he was on the
[1:12:03] inside of the inside
[1:12:05] here's the waters out there all stirred
[1:12:07] up here's the little bark
[1:12:08] of your boat your spirit realm all being
[1:12:10] stirred around and fretful
[1:12:12] and here's the man on the inside of the
[1:12:14] inside controlling every bit of it
[1:12:17] and he said i said let's go over to the
[1:12:18] other side now who's going to say he
[1:12:20] can't get there
[1:12:23] he was in the boat wasn't he wasn't he
[1:12:25] not in the ship
[1:12:27] is he not in your ship has he not said
[1:12:30] you'll be there
[1:12:31] has he not promised you would be there
[1:12:33] did he not say you would be changed are
[1:12:35] you not identified and recognized as a
[1:12:37] part of the resurrection
[1:12:38] are you not going to be there
[1:12:43] how do you know he's in the ship
[1:12:49] hallelujah all he's waiting on is for
[1:12:53] you
[1:12:56] the uh the resurrected word
[1:12:59] to take control over the situation
[1:13:03] because you and him are one he's saying
[1:13:05] i've given you that authority
[1:13:08] then it project my love through
[1:13:11] faith and take possession
[1:13:15] did you get that how is faith how is
[1:13:18] faith projected
[1:13:20] through love through faith i mean how
[1:13:21] excuse me how is love projected
[1:13:24] through faith amen
[1:13:30] hallelujah
[1:13:33] all right and so it'll make him what
[1:13:35] will it cause this person to do that
[1:13:37] recognizes
[1:13:38] his his presence invisible god no
[1:13:40] catches the vision of the invisible god
[1:13:42] the vision
[1:13:43] it stabilizes action and in the time of
[1:13:46] distress
[1:13:47] and trouble it'll make him look upward
[1:13:55] make him look upward
[1:13:58] and above the things that are happening
[1:14:01] around him
[1:14:03] because he's looking at the unseen
[1:14:10] the unseen things are eternal
[1:14:15] he that hath the son
[1:14:18] hath life
[1:14:22] amen is that right then we can say jesus
[1:14:25] is
[1:14:26] not was or will be he was and will be
[1:14:29] but he
[1:14:30] is the son of god
[1:14:35] amen and he that will confess that
[1:14:39] is living confess that because because
[1:14:41] god will manifest and confess what he is
[1:14:44] and his
[1:14:44] love through you he'll use his spirit to
[1:14:47] do it your spirit to do it
[1:14:49] which is his spirit then i say his
[1:14:51] spirit
[1:14:53] the bible said that he would
[1:14:56] he would i he would use
[1:14:59] how's that scripture go let me just look
[1:15:02] right here real quick i know where it's

[1:18:46] and pleasant i just walk around the
[1:18:48] smile on my face all the time
[1:18:50] that's not what he's talking about he's
[1:18:52] talking about how sweet
[1:18:54] and pleasant where you're living
[1:18:59] on the inside of the inside you're
[1:19:01] living there

[1:19:24] he's going to work it all right amen the
[1:19:27] steps of a good man

[1:19:37] and are they called according to what
[1:19:40] and let me put one word in there his

[1:20:11] oh now brother david he's gone off the
[1:20:13] deep end
[1:20:16] everything perfect it just depends on
[1:20:19] what you're looking through
[1:20:20] what eyes you're looking at
[1:20:24] is that right because i sure don't look
[1:20:26] perfect in your eyes
[1:20:28] and you're not perfect in mine but i'm
[1:20:31] perfect in his
[1:20:34] so which would you rather see through
[1:20:35] his or through your own

[1:20:46] right now amen now i meant that
[1:20:50] i believe god meant it amen all right i
[1:20:52] believe the reason that we don't have
[1:20:54] desperation it's a lack of love
[1:20:58] the love of god i think that the love of
[1:21:00] god causes desperation
[1:21:03] if god is implied because you recognize
[1:21:05] you you recognize the hour
[1:21:07] you recognize how late it is you don't
[1:21:09] want to spend any of your little time
[1:21:11] foolish

[1:21:14] me your word
[1:21:15] reveal it to me take me off of these
[1:21:18] other things that get in the way and

[1:27:02] now if you got the token inside of you
[1:27:04] and you see the conditions of times and
[1:27:05] people's waiting in the way of sin they

[1:27:09] believe it will
[1:27:11] now the word plainly states if you want
[1:27:13] to put it down galatians 5
[1:27:14] 6 that faith worketh by love see faith
[1:27:16] worketh by love the only way you can
[1:27:19] have faith is to have love
[1:27:21] first because after all
[1:27:24] faith is love's incentive
[1:27:28] amen faith is love's incentive
[1:27:32] love's encouragement faith is love's
[1:27:35] encouragement

[1:28:08] amen we must have love
[1:28:12] we must have love before we can have
[1:28:13] faith
[1:28:16] when we when we have genuine love what
[1:28:19] does it do
[1:28:19] it pushes our faith out on the
[1:28:21] battlefront for god
[1:28:23] godly love for god and for his word for
[1:28:26] his people
[1:28:27] will push faith out there love just
[1:28:29] takes a hold

[1:29:03] you place the word you place
[1:29:04] you place faith in that word over that
[1:29:07] circumstance you're putting the word
[1:29:09] over the circumstance
[1:29:11] amen all right

[1:29:27] you'll keep his words
[1:29:28] how can now you can't keep his words
[1:29:32] without having faith in what he
[1:29:34] said if he loves if see
[1:29:37] if he loves god then he keeps god's word
[1:29:40] i am the lord that healeth thee he
[1:29:42] believes that love makes him believe
[1:29:44] that

[1:30:34] realm inside

[1:30:45] he said if you go into that inner veil
[1:30:48] inside of there you go into there he

[1:31:00] and you go in there and the world is
[1:31:02] shut off when the veil drops around him
[1:31:04] down under the locking wings of the
[1:31:05] cherubim the great shekinah glory
[1:31:07] under there that light there in there

[1:31:28] the
[1:31:28] the wise virgin had their lamps
[1:31:31] and their vessels with oil
[1:31:35] there's a difference the foolish virgin
[1:31:39] never had a vessel full of oil
[1:31:42] but the but the but the bride or the
[1:31:45] wise virgin
[1:31:47] had their lamp had their vessels with

[1:32:06] seems to bother them they have peace

[1:32:44] can't close this now
[1:32:50] on the message perfect faith
[1:32:53] let me just close it off with some of
[1:32:55] these things right here and we'll stop
[1:32:57] i'm just right about that time right now
[1:33:03] all right faith and love is relation do
[1:33:07] you wanna know where that's found page
[1:33:08] 22 perfect faith
[1:33:09] faith and love is relation because you
[1:33:13] can't have faith unless you got love
[1:33:15] because your faith is in a god who is
[1:33:16] the very essence of love
[1:33:18] faith and love works together
[1:33:22] amen then it talks about how that they
[1:33:24] when you fall in love when the young
[1:33:26] couple falls in love this is
[1:33:27] this is like us and god now and they
[1:33:30] love they fall in love with one another
[1:33:32] and as they go along and begin to know
[1:33:34] one another more their hearts just
[1:33:36] begin to beat as one
[1:33:39] there says their love begins to bind
[1:33:44] them together
[1:33:45] they have confidence in one another if
[1:33:47] you really love one another really
[1:33:50] love and you know that this girl loves
[1:33:52] you and she
[1:33:53] and she knows that your love you love
[1:33:55] her
[1:33:56] you've got confidence faith in one
[1:33:57] another
[1:34:00] and you've got faith and you separate
[1:34:03] them and put one extreme south and one
[1:34:05] extreme north there's still love that
[1:34:06] beats before one another
[1:34:08] no matter where they're at they're just
[1:34:10] as true to one another as they can be
[1:34:12] because they love one another and if you
[1:34:15] love the lord not just trying to dodge
[1:34:17] hell but you love the lord then you have
[1:34:19] faith in god see if you love him
[1:34:24] he said i'm going he's talked about the
[1:34:27] the young girl marrying the
[1:34:28] man he said now he said he was a young
[1:34:31] christian
[1:34:32] and said if you happen to fall into
[1:34:33] temptation and is overcome don't stay
[1:34:35] away from home

[1:34:38] here because i'm going to be right here
[1:34:40] waiting for you
[1:34:42] and i'm going to help you pray through
[1:34:44] again until you get the victory i'm
[1:34:46] going to stay
[1:34:47] with you because when i married you i
[1:34:49] married you because i loved you
[1:34:51] and no matter what you are i still love
[1:34:54] you
[1:34:55] oh hallelujah there you are now how
[1:34:58] could a man ever do anything wrong
[1:35:01] see when somebody loves you like that
[1:35:05] amen there you are how could you
[1:35:08] trespass that confidence
[1:35:10] and when we were sinners alienated
[1:35:12] without god in the world in the muck of
[1:35:14] mud
[1:35:15] as i talked about this this morning god
[1:35:18] come to us
[1:35:19] god sought you you never sought god no
[1:35:22] man can come to me except my father
[1:35:23] draws him first
[1:35:24] and god came down in the muck where you
[1:35:27] were
[1:35:28] god did and sought you out and brought
[1:35:31] you out
[1:35:32] that ought to that ought to create a
[1:35:35] perfect
[1:35:36] love look what you was
[1:35:40] and look what you are what did that
[1:35:43] somebody that loved you can't you have
[1:35:46] faith in what he promised you then
[1:35:51] real genuine love will create
[1:35:54] a confidence in his
[1:35:57] word he caught me when i was nothing i'm
[1:36:02] still nothing
[1:36:02] but i'm in his hand he caught me when he
[1:36:05] loved he caught me
[1:36:06] and he loved me when i was unlovable he
[1:36:08] loved you and you was unlovable but he
[1:36:10] changed you
[1:36:12] amen when i was an alien from him so he
[1:36:15] so loved me till he stooped down to get
[1:36:17] me and pick me up
[1:36:18] that gives me confidence and he wants
[1:36:20] that he wants to use me
[1:36:22] he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen
[1:36:25] something in me
[1:36:26] he's seen something in you he had a
[1:36:28] reason to save you
[1:36:30] look at the people that's unsaved today
[1:36:32] look at the millions he could have took
[1:36:33] beside you
[1:36:34] then i asked you brother sister what did
[1:36:36] he see in you
[1:36:38] himself
[1:36:44] amen he could have took others beside
[1:36:46] you but he took you
[1:36:48] amen and you didn't have anything to do
[1:36:50] with that
[1:36:52] amen look at the millions
[1:36:56] but he took you amen no one can take
[1:36:59] your place
[1:37:00] hallelujah i'm happy no one can take
[1:37:04] your place
[1:37:06] amen you're in god's economy no one can
[1:37:08] do it
[1:37:09] that's his love to you
[1:37:13] then won't your love reach right back to
[1:37:15] him and there's a love affair
[1:37:18] amen no matter what the situation
[1:37:22] is its circumstances is governed by
[1:37:26] this love amen
[1:37:30] that creates faith that god
[1:37:33] loves you and you love god and you love
[1:37:36] one another
[1:37:37] and that brings the faith
[1:37:40] perfect faith is pure and as pure as
[1:37:44] love is see and when you got perfect
[1:37:47] faith is pure
[1:37:48] that and as pure as that love is see and
[1:37:50] when you love somebody
[1:37:52] you love your husband you love your wife
[1:37:54] now there's no need of me telling you
[1:37:55] you don't
[1:37:56] because you know you do
[1:38:02] and how do i prove it
[1:38:05] by the way i live to him
[1:38:11] see i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal
[1:38:14] honest husband
[1:38:16] that proves that i love my wife i love

[1:38:29] what he's trying to say here
[1:38:31] talking about you and christ you and god
[1:38:34] they talk about husband and wife too but
[1:38:36] it's deeper than that
[1:38:38] all right see and there's something real
[1:38:41] he said your faith has confidence in one
[1:38:43] another it's pure and there's something
[1:38:45] real that you can't show it to somebody
[1:38:47] else what happened in that little room

[1:38:54] i can tell you but i can't explain it to
[1:38:56] you well give us some of your oil

[1:39:20] foolish virgins not a bad person in fact
[1:39:23] they're a help to the body of christ
[1:39:26] are you with me i'm not saying who is
[1:39:27] and who isn't i'm just saying that's
[1:39:29] what they are
[1:39:30] and they'll get eternal life at the
[1:39:31] judgment did you know that
[1:39:33] the bible makes that clear amen
[1:39:37] they were virgins they were sanctified
[1:39:40] good people
[1:39:41] loved god as far as they knew to love
[1:39:42] god but they never could enter
[1:39:44] in behind that veil the only ones that's
[1:39:46] going in the rapture is those that
[1:39:48] enter in
[1:39:51] and if you're in you bet you thank the
[1:39:54] lord because
[1:39:55] he placed you there
[1:40:00] and if he placed you there you're going
[1:40:02] to live that word
[1:40:05] and if there's something standing in
[1:40:07] your way you can't stand it
[1:40:09] until it's out of the way
[1:40:13] that's the action of god and if you just
[1:40:15] don't let it be out of the way and you
[1:40:16] want to hold on to that bitterness and
[1:40:18] that thing you did back in the past
[1:40:20] want to continue with it you're not
[1:40:21] going anywhere in god
[1:40:27] because god won't have nothing before
[1:40:29] him and if you want to bow to that thing
[1:40:31] and keep bowing to it you're an idolater
[1:40:34] it's idol worship that's exactly what it
[1:40:37] is
[1:40:38] amen because anything becomes between
[1:40:41] you and that fellowship with god
[1:40:43] and breaks that fellowship and you bow
[1:40:45] to that and you bow to that and you
[1:40:46] serve that
[1:40:47] and won't do anything about it it's an
[1:40:49] idolatrous spirit
[1:40:54] well you don't realize i asked god to
[1:40:55] forgive me that long ago but you don't
[1:40:57] need that you need to go to the one you
[1:40:58] did it to
[1:40:59] and ask god and that's forgiveness
[1:41:02] i don't god knows what's needed isn't he
[1:41:06] amen but you better you can't say you're
[1:41:09] in there with him and not do that
[1:41:12] because that's not the action of the
[1:41:13] holy ghost and when you enter in that
[1:41:15] you're one with him there
[1:41:18] his life is your life you're gonna i
[1:41:20] just read it to you in the scripture
[1:41:21] you're gonna live
[1:41:22] you'll live as he lived in fact first
[1:41:25] john four haven't even got to it
[1:41:27] as he is so are we in this present world
[1:41:30] amen
[1:41:32] you read first john 4 when you get back
[1:41:34] home
[1:41:36] because because god's manifested in our
[1:41:39] flesh
[1:41:40] in our life and if god's manifested in
[1:41:42] our life there's no fear in love
[1:41:45] and if god is in you and i you're not
[1:41:47] going to be afraid to go make anything
[1:41:49] right
[1:41:50] if you know you need to do it i wouldn't
[1:41:53] let that thing stand in your way
[1:41:55] and if something standing your way from
[1:41:57] forgiving a person that has wronged you
[1:41:59] you better make that
[1:42:00] right too you bury it right now and then
[1:42:04] amen amen if you from your heart can't
[1:42:07] forgive that person
[1:42:09] how can god forgive you
[1:42:12] if you from your heart don't forgive see
[1:42:15] all right
[1:42:16] from where i don't feel like it
[1:42:20] from the heart amen
[1:42:23] amen don't just stand there reasoning
[1:42:25] with it what god said you'll do
[1:42:28] because god's in you and if god's in you
[1:42:31] it'll keep the word praise the lord do
[1:42:34] you love him
[1:42:35] amen all right so so you're a christian
[1:42:38] you have a right to any redemptive
[1:42:40] blessing that jesus died for you it's
[1:42:42] all yours
[1:42:43] it's already paid for you just have to
[1:42:45] believe it not imagine it but believe it
[1:42:47] and know it's yours
[1:42:48] and go possess it
[1:42:52] amen praise the lord
[1:42:55] amen now is his grace sufficient
[1:42:58] amen saul
[1:43:01] paul my grace is sufficient for you
[1:43:04] when love projected grace takes over it
[1:43:08] always does brother ramsay it always
[1:43:09] does
[1:43:10] how many i've lived long enough to see
[1:43:12] that it always does
[1:43:14] when you don't think it's going to
[1:43:15] happen god's right there you just keep
[1:43:17] standing with the word
[1:43:18] lord i love you i don't understand it i
[1:43:20] don't have to understand it i just know

[1:43:26] completely to your leadership
[1:43:28] and i'm resting in you and lord as you
[1:43:30] lead me
[1:43:31] i'll follow david
[1:43:35] my grace is sufficient for you
[1:43:38] amen i believe that let's stand tonight
[1:43:41] amen his grace is sufficient for when
[1:43:44] love is projected grace takes over
[1:43:48] and what is brother branham said this
[1:43:50] about paul he said
[1:43:52] no wonder paul could stand in the face
[1:43:53] of death and say oh death where's your
[1:43:55] sting grave where's your victory
[1:43:57] through tribulations he had learned to
[1:43:59] love god

[1:48:03] and i believe that the holy ghost in me
[1:48:05] will always receive
[1:48:06] correction of the word
[1:48:10] what's the what's what'd you say how
[1:48:13] that

[1:48:59] god's eyes at each other
[1:49:03] amen how's god look at you through his
[1:49:06] word
[1:49:07] amen amen where's the voice of god today
[1:49:10] where is
[1:49:11] where is the world hearing direct from
[1:49:13] god in his bride
[1:49:16] amen the bride has become the final
[1:49:19] voice
[1:49:19] under her messenger
[1:49:22] amen you can't speak something contrary
[1:49:25] to what the messenger the messenger is
[1:49:27] the holy ghost himself
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:31] he used a prophet to bring the
[1:49:32] interpretation of this word to us
[1:49:35] you don't have and i don't have a right
[1:49:36] to add what i think to it
[1:49:39] if you don't understand it leave it
[1:49:40] alone let god quicken it to you
[1:49:43] because when he does he'll point it
[1:49:44] right directly into this word
[1:49:46] if you if you say what that prophet said
[1:49:49] it's going to line up with this
[1:49:52] i'm not saying the prophet was wrong he
[1:49:54] did say what this said
[1:49:56] but if you see what he said you're going
[1:49:58] to see it here
[1:50:01] amen so then it's not just our idea
[1:50:04] praise the lord but when the prophet
[1:50:06] said that scripture meant such and such
[1:50:09] how dare you try to put your thinking to
[1:50:11] it and say it means something else
[1:50:13] [Music]

[1:50:17] following some man this is a vindicated
[1:50:19] prophet

[1:50:22] about that
[1:50:24] good because i take another hour
[1:50:25] preaching
[1:50:29] if you had a question about that you
[1:50:31] need to go back to step one
[1:50:35] and believe god sent a prophet amen
[1:50:39] brother i'll stop preaching all right
