beside her husband and father we're not going to believe anything else we're standing on that on that promise father god we're expecting to see and any other needs lord that's here by uplifted hand

[Music] amen once again i want to greet you all precious name of our lord jesus christ as we get ready to turn the service to our pastor let's sing number 823 how many were in a battle this week told by the paul in the back i said yes i sang at least one happy birthday to the devil this week it was monday oh amen keep on the firing line if you're in the battle for the lord and right just keep on

even left behind just [Music] you know the song says for this call and my brother and sister what a beautiful call god has given us amen to call us into the service call us to labor for him and to labor in the word it's a beautiful thing aren't you glad the word still speaks amen well sister sarah i thought maybe once you made it down to that warm country you would just send like an iou back to idaho or something but uh welcome home god bless you each and every one of you tonight amen good to see you and we're just uh thinking about this praise the lord that um you know our our sister sharon uh her fiance uh brother yannick has made it to the states and uh i think that's a wonderful thing an answer to prayer we still have other needs when it comes to immigration you know uh brother sergey uh the paperwork for his mother amen we just put all these things in the hand of the lord just desire that we see these things according to god's perfect will and so just good to be here amen brother sergey i think this was a good week to be home amen uh you know there's nothing like waiting around in the snow you know to remind you how wonderful home is amen so well uh i want to apologize you know i might have overreacted this last sunday i i know that we got quite a bit more snow and weather out our way uh than here in town and it's kind of after the fact realized maybe we should have just had church and i just you know always ask the lord for leadership wisdom you know forgive me if i did overreact if you guys were looking out at bear asphalt saying what is brother paul thinking uh but uh you know i just i care about you saints and well you know we just uh sometimes you know just a little concerned about those that have to drive and the roads and it isn't you amen it's the others that i'm worried would what they would do to you uh watch people slide through intersections and do all kinds of crazy things and anyway if i was wrong lord forgive me we just want to do the right thing for the body of believers amen let's stand as we go into the word tonight i want to speak to you once again on age old proverbs and tonight just want to speak to you on the thought of the quest for wisdom now a quest my brother and sister is not something that just happens for a moment and goes away but a quest is something that is long-lasting and laborious and something that you press into and you know wisdom uh several different definitions of wisdom but you know i like that portion of where it speaks about a personal knowledge so we're looking we're searching for that personal knowledge of a relationship with jesus christ not something to talk about you know this brother was a very spiritual person this person very spiritual but we want to just press into not for our own personal relationship amen let's turn the book of proverbs once again here uh just taking a few verses uh trust that it will bless you tonight amen a false balance is abomination to the lord proverbs 11 1 i'm sorry a false balance is abomination to the lord but a just wait is his delight when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowly is wisdom you know just reading uh and my bad habit here again it's either in influence or um a couple other sermons i believe it's in the sermon influence where brother branham says the closer we get to god the more humble we become so we cannot have a hearty spirit and say we are have a close relationship with the lord it just doesn't work when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowly is wisdom the integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them riches profit not in the day of wrath but righteousness delivereth from death the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness the righteousness of the upright shall deliver them but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness when a wicked man dieth his expectation shall perish and the hope of the unjust men perisheth the righteous is delivered out of trouble oh can someone say amen the righteous is delivered out of trouble and the wicked cometh in his stead oh my a hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbor but through knowledge shall the just be delivered when it goeth well with the righteous the city i love these verses right here because i believe we can apply this to right into our cities where we live when it goes well with the righteous the city rejoices when the wicked perish there is shouting by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked he that is void of wisdom despise his neighbor but a man of understanding holdeth his peace a tale bearer revealeth secrets but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter where no counsel is the people fall but in the multitude of counselors there is safety heavenly father we just ask lord for your blessings tonight and lord just ask you to reach out father tonight i lift my mother lord having chosen to take this vaccine father it is struck her very hard lord and we just ask you lord jesus just to come and touch her tonight be her portion father give strength to her body encouragement to her soul lord ask you to be with each and every one father the the needs the requests unspoken of this body of believers we lift them before you tonight and those lord who would not be here tonight for whatever reason we just send your holy spirit out and ask you lord to be their portion be their strength be their comfort lord we love you and adore you father desire lord to walk so upright father lord that we could have lord the word spoken about us as it was lord about enoch father we come now with confidence in you tonight asking you to speak to us through your word in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated i want to just take a few minutes as it is to go through these scriptures as we have been doing i was joking with sister jerry tonight she was telling me paul it's time to go and i said you know honey i haven't preached in so long i've forgotten how to how to put all this together and uh so you know uh it certainly uh tonight seemed to be a little more difficult to to get my thoughts put out but as we look at this you know i believe a person could take a whole sermon or series on verse one a false balance is abomination to the lord but a just wait is his delight and we look at that and realize by a false balance my brother and sister will first start and put it in the deal of someone doing business and as they would uh maybe adjust the scale in their own favor that they would uh be able to uh take a portion uh un uh justified but take a portion from each and every person that they dealt business with and and you know that is just um you know even in the day that we live in uh the the law the government uh they certify scales to make sure that it has been checked out that it is a balanced scale a a accurate or fair scale and we would we would definitely want that you know in in the world i live in uh everything is done by weight and you don't want to uh find out that you know over time you had been defrauded because of something that was inaccurate but my brother and sister just to step out of this realm for just a moment i want to uh put this in a slightly different context if i may tonight for just a moment uh when we talk about the word of god we talk about a balanced message we talk about a balanced stand upon the word we don't want to veer uh hard to the left or hard to the right but we want to stay right in the center and you know if the word of god being presented uh is presented in such a way people having confidence in the leadership around them if that is presented with a false balance it will cause people to pull in a certain or go in a certain direction and they will believe that their outlook or their view of the word of god the the scripture and of the message they would believe that it was correct but yet if that balance upon the word is not correct if it has been skewered it will cause people to to lean or be pulled into certain directions and that's why uh you know a part of of you know a little humor in there brother george you know takes that little level with him everywhere he goes and you look at that and realize that it is a significance that he is trying to convey and uh i would say amen to and that is we need to preach a balanced message and we need to live balanced lives we don't want to be caught up in lives that are off in the fringes uh i remember many years ago brother donnie reagan put it this way he said you know people they they drive down the ditch and all the cans and the weeds and the trash is all flying out in front of their vehicle and then something comes along and shows them that they shouldn't be there but getting into the center of the road is actually more difficult and often times you come out of the ditch and you fly over into the other ditch and move from maybe you know as it would be too too liberal you become too legal or too legal become too liberal and you know what we want to do is just be able to go right down the center of the the road as it were the revealed word of the hour has been promised amen by the word of god it is promised to you and i my brother and sister that it will deliver us amen so the goods have been promised to be delivered to us as sons and daughters of god can we say amen to that and so we can stand upon that but we want to remain balanced and uh so you know i i just uh that struck me as i look at that you know and i think lord help us uh to remain balanced and you know pride cometh and then cometh shame and you know i think each one of us could uh just testify in our own life you know that we kind of think that we've got something figured out and uh we we think we're good at that or we've got it under control you know like well i i just decided you know i'm gonna do something and so it's no longer an issue in my life and then we we get raised up in that and think that we're quite the christian and then something happens in our life that reminds us that without christ we're nothing amen but with the lowly is wisdom and and you know i would rather be you know in the natural let me put it this way i'd rather be good at what i do and just let that be my testimony than to speak about how good i am i've done that a few times in my life of how how good i was and i i'll just share this bit of humor one time uh i was painting a a uh and these guys that were working with me and i'm spraying these uh stairwell shadow boxes you know they're like 12 feet off the off the floor and while i'm on top of a ladder spraying these i make a comment to one of the guys that says you know about the last 10 houses i've painted i didn't have a single run and so i'm spraying those deals and we get down and we shut all the lights off luck turn the heat up lock the house up and leave i come back in the morning and the paint had run so much it had actually dripped on the floor and created a little pyramid and and i i thought how could that be and i realized it was god reminding me that it doesn't pay to boast amen you know that last little bit that you just think you have accomplished it doesn't pay to boast so you know to take the position that i am who i am today by the grace of god it is not of my ability not of my strength my wisdom uh not my spirituality uh it's not my own righteousness because lots of filthy rags but to remember that god is why we are great and i will tell you tonight and that concept i will tell you tonight we are great by the grace of god the word poured out in our day has made a people that in the eyes of god a bride that in the eyes of god is the greatest wife that he could ever have amen this is not us boasting in our flesh but it is boasting in him and i say thank you lord that we can stand tonight and say we are the blood-washed bride of jesus christ amen and in our own humanness we know our failure but when we get into the vision of the word that vision my brother and sister is so much greater than we comprehend it that vision of the word is so much more so much more benefit and and so much more overcoming power and so much more glory than we even comprehend and if we step into that and realize who i am in jesus christ is not based upon a fleshly human element but it is based upon christ himself declaring this is my bride oh isn't that a wonderful thing to be able to stand on that and and to be able to accept the word of god and what it says about us today why my brother and sister do you realize that in the hour we're living and we we won't go into this i'm a little off track here but we won't go into this but you realize in the hour we're living the word of god says that there would be power poured out into the people of this hour now my brother and sister i say it's time for us to stand up and say lord i am being prepared and i believe i am prepared to receive and exhibit this power now it is not our power my brother and sister you understand that the prophet of god says we don't have power but we have authority in the word of god but the power is there and it's time for us to take the authority we've been given by god and take that and let that now work in our lives that we can realize that it is not us any longer it'll never be us from this point on you need to remind yourself it is not me it is christ in me and i'm standing on that because he said i will never leave you nor forsake you so here is his promise that whatever you walk through whatever you face he's right there with you oh thank you lord hallelujah riches prophets not in the day of wrath boy we understand that the story of the rich ruler but righteousness delivereth from death now we look all through the bible and understand that my brother and sister as jesus was speaking uh over the little girl he's talking about how she's not dead she just sleeps she's just sleeping amen you see we as christians don't have to worry about death isn't that interesting might throw dirt on top of our box but we're already gone hallelujah all you're doing is throwing dirt on top of our box because we are gone oh isn't that the beauty my brother and sister the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness you know my brother and sister look at this if we was just to wait it out tonight the benefits of being righteous now it's not our own righteousness we know that right it's nothing that we could achieve nothing that we could do but it's his righteousness manifested in us which is the very life of jesus christ there is no righteousness outside of him and so the righteousness of the perfect in other words god has declared that you are a righteous individual and this righteousness my brother and sister which is none other than the holy ghost is going to excuse me that frog just i didn't even think i brought him to church with me now righteousness which is the holy ghost in you my brother and sister is what's guiding us there's nothing that we have done you say well praise the lord i'm thankful for the good decisions that i have made well we could rephrase that and say thank you lord for the anointing to make the right decision because it is not within us as humans within our ability to actually guide our own life amen so we look at this uh righteousness verse 6 of the upright shall deliver them but the transgressor shall be taken in their own naughtiness and we look in the world today my brother and sister and and there is a great degree of naughtiness uh you look at that and realize that this naughtiness is a a as it were of a child i have a little granddaughter she has perfected the realm of naughtiness she can look at you and smile she'll say things like i love you grandpa and a minute later she's got her hand in the cookie jar now you know in her thinking that i love you grandpa is what paid for the cookie that she's taking a little bit of naughtiness and that is something that has invaded i believe in the christian world into the churches that the church itself while claiming christ claiming the blood claiming salvation has this anointing of naughtiness that they believe is kind of acceptable when you start to explain things my brother and sister i know i didn't do right but god understands that's naughtiness if the word speaks against it the word speaks to to hinder or or or sent that aside and and we are partakers of it and then we try to explain that god understands well let me agree with you god understands that you are being naughty that you are transgressing willfully knowing that what you're doing is not absolutely correct but if we have embraced a church doctrine of close is close enough are we going to embrace that no we're not the people called to live close enough we're the people that are called to live the word not as close as man can get remember as brother branham brings out the story about the men and the chariots uh going on the mountain and the cliff and one talking about how that he can run his horses as fast as they can go and and keep his wheel right there on the very edge another man talking about how that he would run it and the third man saying you know i like to stay just as close as i can to the inside you see that's where the real believer is the prophet of god lays that out to us that's where the real believer wants to stay we want to stay just as close as we can not out here in the realm of naughtiness but standing upon that we would look here you know i was thinking about by the blessing of the upper eye the city is exalted in verse 11 but it's overthrown by the mouth of the wicked you know i truly believe there is something about when there are real christians in a city that there is a blessing or something positive you remember when brother branham was holding services in iowa and the people were there and they were totally disrespectful unresponsive disrespectful people were laughing and talking and as though they were at some kind of sporting event and and just generally misbehaving and brother branham speaks and he says to the words that this city will never have anything of significance you can go back and study that and i know of brothers that live in those areas around those places and they say those cities are particularly ungodly cities very few churches very worldly behaviors even amongst what churches are there and you know you realize that it is the kind of effect you know cause and effect that in a city i believe this same thing myself personally for a business you say well maybe uh a certain business would would be uh not really a godly business they don't really have a godly culture but you know maybe we would pick on walmart um brother tim works there that store will prosper that store will will be a a store that they will say this store is blessed because it is supporting a son of god and and it would be in each and every one of you and the work that you do those things will be there because god said that he would take care of you and so they will be blessed because they then become the the grain the garner that is supplying the grain to a son or daughter of god and and you look at that and realize the effect that god because he promised he would take care of you that it has a tremendous effect even upon a whole city but you see whenever the wicked become the mouthpiece of the city then you'll see those cities have great problems i could go into a story of a city in california but we won't take the time about how that they basically at a point in time said we don't care if there's a single church left in this city and it was only a short time later that there was found that there was embezzlement and graft and all kinds of corrupt behaviors and the city filed for bankruptcy and all of the city government was had to be replaced and many of them were indicted my brother and sister you see when you would come boldly to stand against god the blessings of god would leave but to embrace that we'll see how that god will bless a city or a company to take care of their own hallelujah now i want to just uh hurry through this verse 12 he that is void of wisdom despises his neighbor but a man of understanding holdeth his peace see my brother and sister sometimes we'll find that our attitude to those around us is actually a direct reflection of our testimony and no matter what we say we are if what we speak and do doesn't match up they will go with what we speak and do and so you look at this we want to befriend right the scripture says to make friends of those of the mammon make friends of those around you now this might seem like a different approach make friends with your neighbors that maybe they'll have opportunity to bless you now that could be misunderstood as though we're looking for someone to give us something but we're not we're actually offering them opportunity to do something good that might affect their life and so we want to give them the opportunity to do something good for us and so you look at that and besides that i can tell you from personal experience even if they're not believers even if they're not christians your neighbors in many circumstances will of their heart do many good things for you amen hallelujah now i want to just come here and step down through my thoughts so i don't keep you too long tonight you see it's a very common theme through the proverbs to see the words wisdom and knowledge used they're they're they're very frequently over and over and over again in the proverbs speaking of wisdom and knowledge and and uh and the context that they're brought it's speaking of those that have wisdom and have knowledge are blessed and you can kind of go through it and read and find that it's talking about those that are lacking my brother and sister they have all kinds of maladies all kinds of things that afflict them because of the lacking of wisdom and knowledge and so you realize by reading this that the the stages set and the encouragement is made for one to seek wisdom and to seek knowledge and you know brother branham says here in the message god keeps his word he said lookie here the first gift in the line of gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge and if you don't have any wisdom how do you know what to do with knowledge so you see how that these two parallel with each other and even though if you would look in webster and they will interchange wisdom and knowledge but my brother and sister we understand as bible readers that this gift of wisdom is just exactly that in fact brother branham says the wisdom is a gift of god so this is not a worldly wisdom in the way that they would say it's not a worldly knowledge in the way that they would say but this would come into the realm of revelation this would come that when god gives us wisdom then we know to how to act upon the word that is revealed to us and when he gives us knowledge my brother and sister that is in essence the understanding of what has been revealed to you you can say i have a revelation but if you don't understand truly this is what happens many times brother branham talking about people with dreams how that they are they want to know what the dreams mean and brother branham talking about that how that when men in a carnal element would come just to discern your dream well let me just tell you how crazy dreams can be i had a dream one night here recently and it tormented me somehow i woke up in the morning i felt like i worked all night and it's because i had snuck out and i had bought a lottery ticket and in that lottery ticket i won 600 and some million dollars now this is quite a dream right wow i mean you guys had forgive me for buying the lottery ticket especially if i paid my tithe and took you all out for something well no there wasn't too many head shaking there but you see in this dream what happened was is i i i won all this money but everywhere i went and everything i did i would go and i would open the front door of my home and there would be hundreds of people there saying you have money give to me give to me give to me and in the dream sister jerry and i are on an airplane flying to arizona to see our grandchildren and we're sitting here they're very incognito on the airplane and suddenly someone sitting in front turns and goes you're that man and then pretty soon including the stewardesses were lined up asking for money in the airplane and in this dream it was this confused jumble of thoughts and in the end as it was half asleep half a week i was there saying no i don't want the money now interpret that for me well we could start shouldn't buy a lottery ticket well that doesn't have anything with dream we shouldn't be buying them anyhow but all the confusion you see somebody might say there's something spiritual in there we'll search till we find it but you see the prophet of god showed us that without the holy ghost discerning what that was all we could do is come up with a whole jumble of stuff i think this looks like this i think this looks like this this must mean that you see so we need wisdom to even understand what we uh would would have i guess you would say in normal life in everyday life we need the wisdom of god we need understanding and we need not to go venturing this one i'm talking about the balance we need to not go venturing out here trying to get spiritual unless god wants you to discern that god wants you to see or there is something but what if that was just something that some comment that was said and something lodged in your head and you went to bed and i mean this seriously you went to bed with a case of indigestion and your body's just not happy and everything's done and your thoughts are all jumbled and and and then we try to spiritualize it you see we have to let god do this work if we start to do this in our own then we have nothing but a problem lookie here the first gift in line of gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge and if you don't have any wisdom how do you know what to do with knowledge seek the best things first wisdom and if you ain't got wisdom what can you do with knowledge or speaking with tongue or these other things it takes wisdom it takes god's wisdom solomon said call it your mother now what would he call it your mother for because nurturing is the nature of a mother let wisdom nurture you nurture does not expect you to go from a baby and swaddling clothes to a job in a month you nurture you teach you let it come and i say god help us to to seek real true godly wisdom and let that guide our lives let that be what makes the decision of the job that i work where i live what i do let godly wisdom come and when the knowledge of what god wants you to do comes to you that we would have the understanding in how to interpret that you say well my brother and sister i i believe that this is offered to me i've shared this before in the church about how i was preaching at a church back east and god totally unbeknownst to me nothing spiritual on my side i just chose an analogy of a man taking a job and that is drawing him away from god and saying well praise the lord i'm getting you know a a better paycheck and i get this all i have to do is work sundays and wednesday little did i know there was a young man sitting on the very front row of the church that sunday morning that was supposed to call when church was over to his foreman and let him know whether he was going to accept a job that was going to cause him to work sundays and wednesdays and god in his infinite grace and mercy my brother and sister no man's input no man's understanding no man knowing why he's speaking those words but god knowing and god coming in what we would call wisdom and saying he's going to make a mistake if i don't intervene and god choosing then to let a complete stranger speak the words that comes as a word of knowledge if you want to put it that way to that young man and he's sitting in church and he's there going i believe i have an answer he'd been praying honestly praying god had an answer you know this is a great opportunity much more wages and a chance to go into management and oh lord i think this is from you but a word of knowledge if you want to put it that way comes it's god's wisdom speaking to him this is a trap of the devil what you believe is going to be a blessing from me is actually a trap of the devil it was kind of interesting because sister jerry was sitting with the pastor's wife and that sister was sitting farther down that same pew that's a mother i should say and she just jumps up and she's screaming and hollering and waving her arms around because she recognized this was something from god speaking right to this situation my brother and sister we have to be able to understand that that young man could have said well praise the lord i know this is of god i mean this is what i feel like the lord showed me that the young man told me he says i was going to call them i was going to accept that job because it came with a substantial pay raise and he was thinking all the good things that he could do in his life with the extra money but god come and give him wisdom through the preaching of the word here again remove me out of the picture clueless but it was god speaking bringing wisdom to this young man to recognize this is not of god this is from the devil amen so call it your mother let wisdom nurture you can i ask you a question when's the last time you prayed that wisdom would nurture you i don't think it's a common theme that we pray for am i on pointer off lord i need wisdom i don't need an answer lord like if you want me to buy a pickup let there be one for a good price on craigslist no that's that's not reason it's cheap on craigslist is because it has no oil pressure fixing to die he poured some of that bars oil in it you know the stuff that looks like molasses looks real good my brother and sister you see wisdom is what we really need you see let wisdom nurture you because when wisdom nurtures us my brother and sister we'll find that our decisions are much more solidified our decisions are anchored in the word of god our our decisions if i could put it this way are anchored in a blessing for you now blessings are not always monetary blessings can simply be the word being open to you because you allowed god to take you into the word instead of ourselves trying to push our way in you know that's how my brother and sister we get a lot of isms see the lack of wisdom is why there's a lot of isms around the message men have pressed into things they have set down and they have built great charts and graphs and they have taken the different meanings of words and all the different definitions and figured out at what point in the scripture this definition of this word applies and then we come and we come up with what we call logical conclusions that in god's eyes are completely illogical because man pressed into it you see it seems in the world we're living in that there's actually a lack of wisdom and knowledge we have ideas we press into them you know my brother and sister you can have what i would call a complete fabrication of a man's idea now i hope you're with me a complete fabrication of a man's idea and back it up with scripture and quotes and it be completely wrong isn't it amazing how god allowed that to happen that we can justify let me just say this way someone can justify their position by scripture and quotes and be completely wrong let me also put this to you satan did not seduce eve in one afternoon by the fabrication of his idea you've heard this preached go back just once again look in your bible you see satan removed the personal deity of god and it went from the lord god to god impersonal by the fabrication of the words by the approach the application of it he removed the personal side of god out of the equation now i'm telling you he still uses that tactic today he's still trying to make god an impersonal god to you and i that we start to think he doesn't care about little old me he doesn't care about my world he doesn't care about my problems and satan's there taking that but if you'll look in your bibles again there in genesis 3 i believe it is and you'll find that the minute he deceived eve he come right back with lord god because you see now the condemnation is personal see how tricky he is how he fabricates how he molds it how he presents it in his fashion for his benefit but we as sons and daughters of god my brother and sister we have come and i pray from this day on if you have not prayed for wisdom that you will pray for wisdom that at this point right now we'll have the wisdom to discern what is of god and what is of satan uh what is our position and what is the devil's position because we are the bride of jesus christ that means we were always in god and we are his very flesh the prophet of god said flesh of his flesh bone of his bone we are one with him amen and we need the wisdom to be able to apply that in our life and not allow satan to put this into an impersonal realm where when he turns the table our condemnation is personal but he wants an impersonal god when he's trying to trip you up let's just go in first corinthians for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wives so god's promised to take the wisdom of the wise and he's going to crush it now i don't mean to talk politics here tonight but all you have to do is turn on your computer and look at what they're talking about doing you know congress no longer has he's and she's there are a bunch of its and i'll agree with that they're a bunch of its idiots see they've lost all wisdom we are printing money out of thin air to stimulate you so that you'll be banked up later because you can't afford to live because of inflation but no problem you feel good now they have and i won't go into it because it just depresses me but you see my brother and sister you can look at what's happening in our nation and recognize a complete lack of wisdom so is this scripture fulfilled this day before our eyes i believe it is amen he's destroyed the wisdom of those that think they're wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe here again i'm just going to poke at a button and leave it be the foolishness of preaching you know the man come to brother branham and he said you know brother branham uh you know the days uh you know the apostolic gift you know those days are gone now brother branham doesn't even argue with the man he just simply says to him okay the apostolic age i can show you in the bible where god gave it to the church you show me where he took it away now i want to apply this to those who say we no longer need ministers that we don't know need pastors we don't need preachers and evangelists i can show you where god put it in this scripture you show me where he took it out you see that's just a spirit it's here to confuse people because it seems reasonable you know most of these false doctrines my brother and sister came from a preacher wait all of them did but does that take away what the word said see that's what's confusing and people are saying you know i got hurt by a preacher i got hurt by this situation these guys are not preaching it straight it's not matching up with what the prophet said we don't need them well i'm sorry when you step out of there and you throw them out you've actually stepped outside the word of god your own self because god never took it out of scripture and i don't say that as a a jab against anyone i say it's a spirit that is here in this day that is trying to get people to pull back for the jews require a sign the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified and unto jews a stumbling block under the greek's foolishness but unto them which are called hallelujah some of those here tonight got a calling praise the lord god by his grace and mercy called us just as sure as your phone goes ding-a-ling or or whatever it does for you amen just as sure as that would happen in the natural god has called us he says but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom see now the word is telling us that jesus christ himself is made wisdom to you and i he's also then declaring breaking this sentence down in this he is made righteousness to us there should be no question in our mind when we read this scripture that he has been made wisdom to us that he has been made righteousness to us he has made sanctification to us and he is redemption to us amen so the devil with all of his little tricks all of his little lies all these things my brother and sister is here now pinned to the wall listening happy birthday to him amen he's pinned to the wall because these words if we believe our bible amen we believe our bible these words are showing us clearly of what jesus christ is to you and i the position that has been given to us but see this is so wonderful but without wisdom on our part and understanding on our part and knowledge on our part we can read this and say yes to it and never ever apply it never ever go as it were and write that check that the prophet of god was talking about oh lord help me to write the check can you say amen to that tonight lord help me to write the check when i have a need i'm discouraged i have a greater need than that something of a husband of a wife of children of parents whatever it might be family or friends whatever it might need let's have the courage to not just say oh well we hope or we're doing but write the check claim what has been given to us amen it takes knowledge to do that right now it says you know sometimes you don't have because you ask not because our problem is is when we ask we're off base we're a miss lord give us wisdom one wisdom to ask one wisdom to ask correctly so that when we would ask we're not sitting back i think of your wife for the christian this is just i'm just expressing my heart to you when she'll come to the place you mentioned something never explained it i don't expect you to you don't have to but you see when she comes to the place she starts asking god for things herself not us coaching not us pushing not us suggesting but she herself starts asking god and god starts answering then no one will ever tell that young lady ever again in her life god's not real but you see if we push it to happen and we push it to be done and we try to fabricate it and we try to bring it about all it'll do is bring confusion but you see when we have real wisdom and realize that we as a body of believers just start praying for god to reveal himself that's all that will matter that's all that will matter because he'll come down and reveal himself and then they'll be understanding hallelujah where was i thank you that according as it was written he that glorieth led him glory in the lord you want something to glory in hallelujah honestly saints we ought to be saying lord i want something to glory in i don't want to sit here and just talk about well you know have a good life and i believe the message what we should be doing is moving beyond this you know i had someone at one time kind of make a little accusation to me you know paul you are leaving brother branham behind i won't present it tonight but i've got a quote yeah to those of you need a quote i've got a quote brother branham says you'll move beyond this hmm what are we going to do with this you know why he would say you're going to move beyond this because he said i come to point you to christ and so he was speaking with confidence that the day of the introduction of you and i to jesus christ that we would be moving beyond does that mean we leave the message absolutely not because this message is jesus christ but he will come and you'll realize what he's talking about and you know i say this there's other brothers that kind of feel this way so throw us all out with the bathwater if you want but my brother and sister i think we've come to a time it's time for us to move beyond this message brother branham preached what'd you just say out loud paul no that wasn't my inner voice that was my outer voice we need to move beyond what he preached into what he preached not standing here the prophet said this the prophet said this the prophet said this the prophet said this my brother and sister anybody can read these quotes but i want to be one of those oh do you want to be one of those that steps into that open book that steps into the open word steps into the life that was being revealed by the prophet and step into that not just sitting back here saying we believe quote this quote that quote this but i want to step into it that would someone would say what did this message produce it produced me and i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god this word their prophet come produce me but when we do that and when we say that we need to have a life that actually backs it up oh god help us god help us but you see i want to be the message that was preached manifested i don't want to just be a quotation i uh refuse i refuse to just be a quotation i am that word that was preached hallelujah did you understand me i don't want you to be confused on that hallelujah but it's time my brother and sister my the antis i was sharing a little bit little bit of a video it's kind of actually humorous in one sense uh heartbreaking in another this man is posting this deal about brother branham and so he speaks very positively of him in the sense yes he was a man sent of god and called for but just like all of these he goes off and starts quoting these other authors and these other people that he went off in the end and god took him because he got out of the will of god and and i thought you know this is interesting because this man in you know he he's talking and he's relating all these accounts and he's relating supernatural things he's relating all kinds of things and uh sister jerry just goes um paul do you realize he's not saying nothing that's right 20 minutes of nothing so that he could recount how that if brother branham had stayed just praying for the sick he would have lived longer that's his conclusion but god had to take him because he started preaching and got off of the correct things and started hitting against things like the trinity now who needs wisdom and understanding you see my brother and sister i'm not mocking the man but he felt led to make this whole video and to share it with the world and he's saying yes when he come against the trinity he left the word of god no no no no you missed wisdom knowledge no wisdom no real knowledge of the word you see my brother and sister because it's tied together very nicely now let me let me hurry up here yes let me definitely hurry up here see verse 30 again but of him where are we from but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us right so it's christ jesus who is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption hallelujah what was it now people that don't understand the godhead would then say well christ jesus would be separate from god because god made him unto us well i'm sorry this was god's avenue of saying i'm with you i'm in you i'm above you i'm beside you i was in you before a world and i'll be in you when there is no world and that god was made wisdom and righteousness sanctification and redemption unto you and i i'm telling you my brother and sister god's got a great gift much beyond what we are giving him credit for and credit for the fact that we are the word manifested now psalms 37 23-25 uh says that the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand now i want to ask you my brother and sister when we were singing happy birthday to the devil did we really feel like that or were we pushing back right victory is mine victory is my victory today is mine come on one of the days of the week the devil's going to decide it's your turn and god's going to decide it's your turn and you'll get a stand up and say you know what i am the manifested word of this day amen i am a son of god a daughter of god i am this word come to life in this generation because the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord now verse 25 is actually the one that i was seeking you see my brother and sister when we start out in life we have a perceived notion of wisdom now we wouldn't be against young men young women and their zeal and excitement life but my brother and sister we'll realize as we read this scripture here how wisdom and time temper us says i have been young and now am old so about half or better of you here tonight he's not talking to you because you're still young yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread amen and some of you might say we've been so poor before brother paul we've been in such dire straits there was nothing on our table to eat but god had it all in control god knew the beginning from the end and he knew every bit in the middle and you'll stand here today and in the end when we have wisdom of what god is speaking to you and i we will look at that scripture and say amen to him because the power of almighty god comes on the scene each and every time when we think it is of the dire we're in dire straits god says i need to wait till shannon rak meshach and abednego i need to wait till they go into the furnace that's what i want to do because you see if i come down in a mighty hand as it were an uprising or a defense in the physical form then we'll say it was man but i'm going to let their heroes their great war heroes their great mighty soldiers the hardened men of warfare i'm going to let them die on the threshold and then i'm going to burn the ropes off of it oh my brother and sister the fire that we are afraid of is what brings our deliverance and when they're in the fire it burns the bombs from them and they stand there and god brings them out of that fire and says not not even the smell of that fire let me put it this way to you tonight not even the smell of that fiery trial that you are facing will reside on you when you come through this you say oh i i just seem to fall on my face and i had such a great struggle and things were so hard for me and i felt so so low and you come through that and god starts to move you again he starts to stir your soul reminding you i was with you all the time you would have fallen but i've been holding you up and you come through that trial you don't go on the rest of your life or you shouldn't anyway saying oh i had this horrible time when i was this age and it was terrible and i just don't even know how i made it through let those things be history you to let the smell of that fiery trial fade from you because to god it never even happened it was there to mold your character he doesn't keep a record well they fell down i had to lift him up oh they fell down and had them lift up you realize if god kept a diary like that what my diary would look like he fell down i lifted him up he fell down i lifted him up and it would be page after page after page of he fell down i lifted him up but i tell you my brother and sister god don't want you and i walking around saying i fell down i fell down i fell down i fell down i'm a failure i fell down god wants you to look at this and say i went through a fiery trial but there's not even one bit of the odor of that trial on me because i have come through this battle victorious the bonds have burned from me i have been delivered from this i know that god is my provider he's my keeper he is my all in all and i don't have to worry about it because i will not be forsaken and he will not leave me begging bread now my brother and sister we can go and i don't want to get too caught up in this but we can also take that in this spiritual realm right back into the spiritual realm of the word of god bring bread of life to you and i we will not end up the bride of christ we'll not be begging the bread trying to find the mind of god the word of god understanding of the word god promised it to you god will deliver it hallelujah can someone say hallelujah oh forgive me for getting excited amen says this is wisdoms of god out of man you know paul says you know i didn't come to you speaking enticing words of man's wisdom i come speaking to you of the power of the word the power of the life that is behind it is what i come speaking to you not enticing words to draw you to an idea oh my goodness lord let us be focused on your word now look five definite identifications the true church of the living god now i just pulled this quote out of here because it it just hit my fancy but i plan on listening or reading this sermon let's let the bible say it then is that good enough for us let us turn now and read a while turn with me to revelation 17th chapter this is the revelation of jesus christ to his church church called out you wonder why the rest of the world don't put the significance that you put on this because they weren't called out they're called to stay right there in mystery babylon they're called to keep that connection open keep that relationship fresh well our relationship fresh is with our lord jesus christ not with a system amen i can take you right if it matters to you i can take you right where the prophet of god said the minute you even go back to that uh spirit of denomination it's dead dead right there oh my so we don't have to go spend years we don't have to form a denomination around this message we just have to get that spirit around and it'll kill the spirit of god church called out revelation 17 and we'll try to make this just quick as possible let that be prophetic but now watch as we read they're coming to me one of the seven angels which had seven vials and talked me saying come hither and i'll show you the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters now this is all symbolized because it is a revelation of jesus christ sealed up now if that remains sealed up how is it that you have wisdom of it now see this is the this is the tricky part to that man it's sealed to you it's open so the prophetic word could be placed in this manifestation the seventh seal is closed the seventh seal is opened because to this man i'm not pointing it to anyone in particular this man it's closed and he won't think of anything else so it being closed now affects his entire relationship with the word of god in fact it affects the entire prophetic relationship of the message of the hour with him and the man that is here saying god has given me wisdom god has given me knowledge and we're not talking about boastful uh claiming we're talking about the reality of it and a man standing there saying the word of god has been open to me the knowledge of god has been open to me and i am here and the seal which is jesus christ has been made real to me you see they're going to have two entirely different views of the message they're going to have two entirely different approaches to the word of the hour because one is declaring part of the word is closed and one is saying i am the bride of christ and he has held out the scepter and said anything you want to the half of my kingdom because you're my other half you fit into the half by half because you are the other half i claimed you and you claim me and you fit perfectly into me come hither i'll show you the judgment of the great horse sitting on many waters now this all symbolized because the revelation of jesus christ sealed up do you know that it is a hidden thing and only can be revealed not by the intellectual mind now look where this revelation my brother and sister people say well why do you think it's open to you read this now it is a hidden thing and only can be revealed not by the intellectual mind we can't build a chart we can't build a graph we can't take walls of paper and write it all out and make a call a logical conclusion because it is a revelation of jesus christ sealed up did you know that it is a hidden thing and only can be revealed not by the intellectual mind but revealed by the holy spirit through the gifts of the spirit this is my brother and sister if i can make this point tonight i hope by god's grace i can do you realize that god has come to you and i young people he's come to you and i bearing gifts we all know what it's like to have someone bearing gifts to us someone comes here's a gift for you it's got your name on it amen your sister your brother your cousin nephew uncle dad mom they got no right to claim that gift it's got your name on it so god is not coming and just throwing this gift out to the church god come to you individually bearing this gift of the revelation of himself oh hallelujah revealed by the holy spirit through the gifts of the spirit to him that has wisdom let him count the numbers of the beast now look my brother and sister this part here that is laying out is there in such a way look at this to him that has wisdom the gift of wisdom let him do this and let him do that and this is the revelation now any note one knows that when a woman is symbolized in the bible it pertains to a church christ church is called the bride paul said i espouse you to christ as a chaste virgin in other words not a church that's dabbled in this and dabbled in that not a church that holds to this off the word and holds to this on the word and comes and says but the balance of it we're christians no chaste virgin in other words she presents herself i've only been in your word i'm clothed in your word hallelujah i hope you i hope you're on board tonight espouse you to christ the chaste version now here we're speaking a great woman who is an ill feigned woman come hither and i'll show you said the angel to john the judgment of the great horror that sets upon many waters now a woman sitting upon many waters sounds very mystic but it's all here the bible explains it we have something like 12 000 recognized religions but the bible explains it somewhere along there there has to be some wisdom and knowledge come to understand what it's explaining hallelujah it takes a gift of the holy ghost to see the whole picture sister emmy would you come hallelujah let's just sing that little song the word is working mightily in me amen i'll tell you what my brother and sister it's a word that's going to change us it ain't going to be what church we belong to it ain't be what kind of friends we got you know by god's grace and i just say this to make a point by god's grace brother george and i have have a few things in common and you know brother braham said that brother george had the holy ghost so me knowing brother george must mean that i'm rubbing shoulders with the holy ghost that won't work it won't matter how good a friend i got to get it myself we have to hold on to this for ourself and that's what wisdom will do to us wisdom will show us of what we lack and what we need and and what is happening around us wisdom will give us revelation and we will not be the ones sitting there on that day saying please sell me your oil please sell of me please sell me please don't you love me please no sir wisdom and knowledge we'll give you a lamp that is trimmed and clear and will give you oil in your vessel and no matter of the midnight hour behold the bridegroom comes we can rise up with joy in our hearts and say thank you lord he's come my bridegroom is come oh there won't be confusion am i the bride or am i not is he talking to this beside me or talking to this one no it'll eliminate that knowledge that wisdom will eliminate all the doubts of who we are and we can lift a hand and say thank you lord that i've been called as the bride of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah well the word is working mindly no matter what my circumstances [Music] god's word is [Music] the word is when the redeemed are gathering in hallelujah i'm looking forward to that day hallelujah in fact i i kind of feel like i'm being a little bit gathered right now hallelujah you know i remember saints a lot of years ago when i first heard a brother preach that the rapture was taking place right now oh i remember i was so suspicious i i could have called scotland yard and the pinkertons and the fbi and said investigate this instead i wrote a big old note right on my notes right there and i put a great big check and that meant check this out and i realized that's it the rapture is a body change and thank you lord i'm being changed right here right now it's not an event to look out there somewhere but he is changing us oh hallelujah my i can only imagine how enoch must have felt that day when he was walking you know there's way too much of this marvel comic world we live in and they've got the uh what do they call them the avengers or the something like that and and you know he's a guy walking along and all of a sudden you know something pops out of the top of his head and this flops this way and that flops that way and he turns into some armor-plated guy to go fight for good or evil well my brother and sister i'm not being changed like that it's the same old me what you see is what you get don't start crying but the change is happening and there's days that i feel like i failed the lord and god comes along and says hmm i want you to look at this right here and you realize thank you lord thank you lord i am not the man i used to be thank you lord hallelujah i am thinking of a rapture in our blessed home on hand when the redeemed the foreign anthem in that city in the sky when the regimes of the lord are gathering in the rings [Music] i'll shout [Applause] [Music] gathering in oh [Applause] with their voices clear and strong when the regime are gathering in and the angels all will listen for they cannot join that song with so [Applause] [Music] our gathering in every false hand [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know sometimes you know you're probably getting old when you start to share something and then before you're done you forgot what you were trying to share [Music] you know i mentioned those avengers now it's kind of a crazy example but i just want you to get this you see they've changed to something but they'll go back to what they was we are changed by the word and we get to go back to what we was before the foundation of the world we get to stand right there in the presence of the lamb we're gonna stand right there the lion of the tribe of judah but when john looked up he didn't see a lion did he he saw a lamb that's us standing in the presence of god we know the lion of the tribe of judah has won the victory but we get to dwell in the presence of the lamb oh thank you lord you see i won't revert back to what i was on this earth by god's grace i will never go back to that man i am changing oh i've been changed i've been reborn can we sing that before we're dismissed can we say amen as we sing this amen i've been changed i've been reborn amen all my life has been rearranged and i say thank you lord for the rearranging oh hallelujah well i've been into the water and i've been bound in the blood of the lamb i've been changed from the creature that i once was [Music] has been rerained [Music] praise god has been changed [Music] i am free i was lost in the darkness but now i found i was blind but now i see ourselves oh [Music] his way all my light praise god has been changed when at last is present i stand up [Music] all my life has been really one more time oh i've been changed oh i've been reborn all my life has been reigns what can we just give him a little praise oh hallelujah lord thank you father your word is changing us oh lord you're giving us wisdom you're giving us knowledge lord we're no longer deceived by the devil no matter how many times he tries how long he tries lord you have given us the wisdom and the prophet of god ties this right back to discernment you've given us the discernment lord to see the wiles of the devil and to know who we are and stand against it oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus lord i ask your blessing old people tonight lord take these lord these little words father lord just put some life in them put some lord something important in them lord may we realize the significance lord we've been taught to pray for patience even though that is so hard now lord i pray that the the saints lord would just grasp father that we should pray for one another lord for the body of believers that we would have wisdom and that we would have knowledge we would have understanding of your word lord and father we just ask you to move in our midst lord may we as a group a body of believers father not be separated but come into a greater unity than ever before i ask this from my heart in the name of jesus christ god bless you saints amen take the presence of the lord with you now remember you've got a checkbook [Music] start using it start writing those checks start claiming what god has promised you we love you in the lord we'll see you this sunday amen [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so you
