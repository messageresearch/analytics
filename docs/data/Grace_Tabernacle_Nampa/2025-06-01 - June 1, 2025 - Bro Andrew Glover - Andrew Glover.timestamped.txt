[7:19] lovelujah. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let
[7:23] the hallelujah roll. Help me ring my
[7:27] Savior's praises far and
[7:31] wide. For I've opened up towards heaven
[7:35] all the windows of my soul. And I'm
[7:39] living on the hallelujah
[7:42] side. And here the sun is always
[7:46] shining. Here the sky is always bright.
[7:50] There's no place for gloomy Christians
[7:52] to abide.
[7:55] For my soul is filled with music in my
[7:59] heart with great delight. And I'm living
[8:03] on the hallelujah
[8:07] side. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[8:11] hallelujah rule. Help me ring my
[8:15] savior's praises far and
[8:18] wide. For I've opened up towards heaven
[8:22] all the windows of my soul. And I'm
[8:26] living on the hallelujah
[8:30] side and upon the streets of glory when
[8:34] we reach the other shore and have safely
[8:38] crossed the Jordan's rolling tide.
[8:43] You will find me shouting glory just
[8:46] outside my mansion door where I'm living
[8:50] on the hallelujah
[8:54] side. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[8:58] hallelujah roll. Help me ring my
[9:02] savior's praises far and
[9:05] wide. For I've opened up towards heaven
[9:09] all the windows of my soul. And I'm
[9:13] living on the hallelujah side. Let's
[9:17] stand together. And upon the streets of
[9:20] glory, we reach the other shore. And
[9:24] have safely crossed the Jordan's rolling
[9:29] tide. You will find me shouting glory
[9:33] just outside my mansion door where I'm
[9:37] living on the hallelujah side.
[9:42] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[9:46] hallelujah roll. Help me ring my
[9:49] Savior's praises far and
[9:53] wide. For I've opened up towards heaven
[9:57] all the windows of my soul. And I'm
[10:00] living on the hallelujah side.

[10:09] over a wall.

[29:47] uh, we will be winding down Sunday
[29:49] school for the summer. And I know this
[29:51] kind of short notice because nobody
[29:53] reminded Brother Paul to announce it.
[29:56] And, uh, so um, it it really really it
[30:01] should have been announced earlier, but
[30:02] we just been a little preoccupied. I'm
[30:04] sorry. Um, Brother Andy, Sister Hannah,
[30:08] God bless you. Uh, Sister Sarah's, uh,

[31:01] So we can all have a little time of

[31:05] uh just take a moment uh of brother
[31:08] Thomas Cross. I met him at the wedding
[31:11] first time. This wedding is just doing
[31:12] wonderful things for us. And um I just
[31:15] really had some lovely conversation with
[31:18] brother Thomas. Uh just uh uh got to
[31:21] talking about things and perspective and
[31:24] how we feel about it, our outlook and
[31:26] and I I just really was impressed. And
[31:28] so, uh, this morning I just, uh, young
[31:31] man, he's just started, uh, uh, uh, you
[31:34] know, not not been in the ministry for a
[31:37] real long time, but, um, you know, uh,
[31:39] just God's placed a call on his life,
[31:42] and he's doing his very best to be
[31:43] faithful to that call to study and be
[31:46] prepared. And, uh, it just come on my
[31:49] heart last night as we were driving back
[31:51] down to the valley. I thought, you know,
[31:54] supposed to be instant in season, out of
[31:56] season. So, we're just going to ask our
[31:58] brother Thomas uh cross uh to come and
[32:01] just greet you today and uh uh we just
[32:05] trust that each and every one of you uh
[32:07] just have a wonderful time today and the
[32:09] Lord blesses you, brother Thomas. Amen.
[32:13] Let's welcome him. Amen. God bless you.
[32:16] Amen. God bless you. It's so good to be
[32:18] here this morning with you. And I just
[32:20] say I came out here for the wedding and
[32:23] uh I came out here, my cousin was
[32:24] getting married and you always get
[32:26] nervous cuz I'm a shy person. I'm uh not
[32:28] always great at meeting people, but I
[32:30] came out here and just met some
[32:31] beautiful people. Everyone's so nice and
[32:33] even brother Paul sitting there
[32:34] fellowshipping with him and it was just
[32:36] incredible and I appreciate uh everyone.
[32:38] But it's just uh I guess I I came out
[32:40] here really to keep brother Andrew
[32:42] straight, keep him in line because he's
[32:43] troubled sometimes. But no, I'm only
[32:46] kidding. But it's just uh I appreciate
[32:48] everyone just uh I'll introduce myself.
[32:50] I'm uh Thomas Cross. I'm out from uh
[32:52] North Carolina out on the east coast.
[32:54] We're southern, but uh it's just I go to
[32:57] uh Brother Josh Bennett's church. And uh
[32:59] which is not Josh Bennett's church. It's
[33:01] the Lord's church. We're led by the Holy
[33:02] Spirit. We're one church, one body.
[33:04] We're baptized. Amen. And uh you know, I
[33:08] told the Lord many years ago, anytime he
[33:09] gave me an opportunity to speak in front
[33:11] of people, I want to do one thing. And I
[33:13] want to lift up this me this message cuz
[33:15] to me I believe this message I it's
[33:17] Jesus Christ to me and that's what the
[33:18] prophet would say. And you know I just I
[33:21] I'm so proud for you know I'm so
[33:24] thankful God sent a prophet because you
[33:26] know I I've seen the denominations and
[33:28] I've heard what they've got to say and
[33:29] that there's nothing out there. I think
[33:30] like the disciples you remember Jesus
[33:32] was speaking to a big old crowd and he
[33:34] he got to saying stuff they didn't like.
[33:36] He said drink my blood and eat my flesh.
[33:37] And I'm just like them disciples. you
[33:39] know, everyone left. But he said he I
[33:41] believe Jesus might have got a little
[33:42] discouraged. He said, "What are you
[33:43] going to do?" And they said, "Lord, to
[33:45] whom else shall we go? What else is
[33:46] there out there? What you know, what do
[33:48] the denominations have? What do they
[33:49] have? They've got nothing." But yeah, I
[33:51] even the prophet would say, I I love the
[33:53] statement he made. He said that the
[33:55] disciples found something in Jesus
[33:57] Christ. They found something in him that
[33:58] they couldn't find in any other man. And
[34:00] I believe that's exactly what we have
[34:02] found in this message right here. You
[34:04] know, you think of Paul. Remember in the
[34:05] Bible, he was on Mars Hill and he said
[34:07] that they're superstitious. They've got
[34:08] an unknown God, but we know our God.
[34:10] He's been unveiled through the message.
[34:12] And you know, you meet somebody new and
[34:14] here I stand. You say, "Well, what are
[34:16] his intentions?" Well, I'll just say it
[34:18] like this. The prophet said, "We do have
[34:20] today by God's help the perfect
[34:22] interpretation of the word with divine
[34:25] revelation." I believe that's what this
[34:26] message came to do was to reveal Christ
[34:29] to us. And it was the restoration of the
[34:31] word that unveiled him because you know
[34:33] Jesus has been or God Christ has been
[34:35] veiled all through the Old Testament to
[34:37] through the New Testament. But you even
[34:38] think in uh uh second Corinthians Paul
[34:41] would say that when the heart shall turn
[34:43] the veil would be taken away. And you
[34:46] look in the Bible that it even uh uh
[34:48] Wesley in his notes in Scopia would say
[34:49] that it was when the heart would turn.
[34:52] And I believe that we've had a message
[34:53] to turn the heart of the children back
[34:55] to the father. And that veil's been
[34:57] taken away. And I believe that he's been
[34:59] unveiled as our healer. He's our
[35:00] redeemer. Any need that we have is all
[35:03] found in Jesus Christ. And I believe
[35:05] that if you have a need this morning,
[35:07] God has sent a man. You would think he
[35:09] might have came for a wedding, but
[35:10] brother Andrew came to minister to the
[35:12] hearts this morning. And you know, even
[35:14] as me and brother Paul talked, you know,
[35:16] just outstanding about brother Andrew is
[35:18] he he's he's a young man, 20 27, not
[35:21] even 30 years old yet. And his knowledge
[35:23] of this message is beyond any other.
[35:25] with I say that in all humility and
[35:27] respect, but that's not it. It's brother
[35:29] Andrew, he lives this message with all
[35:30] his heart, Brother Paul. And that's
[35:32] what's outstanding. You know, Brother
[35:33] Andrew, he'll he'll preach to thousands
[35:35] in Africa or or the big meetings. But
[35:37] one thing about Brother Andrew, he's
[35:39] humble. And he'll preach to I've been in
[35:40] services with 10 people or 20 or 30. And
[35:43] you know, God honors that and he lives
[35:45] this message and he believes the
[35:47] message. And at the preaching of the
[35:49] word, that's when the needs are met. And
[35:50] I believe that we're going to see that
[35:52] this morning. So, amen. And I just thank
[35:54] you all for the warm welcome. Appreciate
[35:56] all you guys. You know, it's just it's
[35:58] always great to be with believers of
[35:59] like precious faith who believe in one
[36:02] message and you know, one God who's uh
[36:05] we're all just brothers and sisters and
[36:06] I appreciate you all and I appreciate
[36:07] your pastor here and the beautiful
[36:09] singing and all the music. You're just
[36:10] great people. So, God bless you. Love
[36:12] you guys.
[36:14] Amen. Amen.
[36:17] Definitely was born to be a preacher.
[36:19] Amen. Well, let's stand. I I didn't
[36:21] realize brother Alex was gonna um go,
[36:24] but um this song's just been on my
[36:26] heart. Maybe it'd be a better closing
[36:28] song than an opening song, but I want to
[36:30] sing a There's a New Testament church
[36:32] rising up. Amen. That's what I see this
[36:34] morning. I see the bride of Christ.
[36:37] She's come. The word is so real to her
[36:40] that she can't just stay set down. She
[36:42] can't be sitting there just saying,
[36:44] "Well, someday, someday." But she
[36:46] realizes the words come alive in her.
[36:49] And if it's alive, it's growing. Amen.
[36:52] So we just thank the Lord for that.
[36:54] Amen.
[36:56] [Music]
[37:04] Hallelujah. Rising up is what the title
[37:07] is, brothers.
[37:11] [Music]
[37:19] As I look out across the land, see God's
[37:24] mighty
[37:25] hand, the bride of Christ adorned in her
[37:29] wedding
[37:32] gown. Just like in the days of old, they
[37:37] stood in a courage bowl. They turned the
[37:42] whole world upside down.
[37:45] [Music]
[37:46] Rising
[37:48] up. Rising
[37:50] [Music]
[37:51] up. There's a New Testament church
[37:55] rising
[37:57] up. Rising
[38:00] up. Rising
[38:03] up. There's a New Testament church
[38:07] rising
[38:09] up. Now the Bible plainly tells how the
[38:14] Holy Ghost
[38:16] fell. Signs and wonders were done by the
[38:19] apostles
[38:22] hands. Demon spirits were cast out. In
[38:26] the jail they sang and shout while
[38:29] surrounded by a holy angel
[38:34] band. Rising up.
[38:38] Rising
[38:40] up. The New Testament church rising
[38:46] up. Oh, rising
[38:49] up. Rising
[38:52] up. There's a New Testament church
[38:56] rising up.
[38:59] Well, if you think it's all long gone
[39:03] and the miracles are done, I have some
[39:07] good news to bring to
[39:11] you. In the last days, he'll pour of his
[39:15] spirit more and more. Like a mighty
[39:19] eagle, your strength he'll renew.
[39:25] We're We're rising
[39:29] up. I'm a New Testament church rising
[39:35] up. Oh, rising
[39:38] up. Rising
[39:42] up. We're New Testament church. Rising
[39:46] up. Now make it personal. I'm rising
[39:50] up. I'm rising up.
[39:55] I'm the New Testament church rising
[39:59] up. I'm rising
[40:02] up. I'm rising
[40:04] [Music]
[40:06] up. I'm the New Testament church rising
[40:11] up. Can you say amen this morning?
[40:14] Hallelujah. Amen. We just want to give
[40:17] liberty time. Brother Andrew, take your
[40:20] liberty. preach what God's laid upon
[40:22] your heart. He's always his ministry's
[40:25] always blessed us and you know just
[40:27] consider it a privilege today to have
[40:29] him here with us. Amen. God bless you,
[40:32] brother Andrew. God bless
[40:35] [Music]
[40:38] you morning. Amen. Amen. It is a a real
[40:42] honor to be in his house this morning
[40:44] and to be gathered in his presence. We
[40:47] we know that we're two or three are
[40:48] gathered together in his name. Amen. and
[40:50] he made a promise that he would come and
[40:52] be in our midst. Amen. And we look
[40:54] around this morning and there's there's
[40:56] more than two or three here, but there's
[40:57] a a whole house full of believers here
[40:59] today that believe the Lord and love
[41:01] him. How many loves the Lord this
[41:03] morning? Amen. You're thankful to be a
[41:05] Christian and to be Amen. numbered among
[41:07] the living this morning. Amen. Amen. It
[41:09] is a real honor to be here with you all
[41:11] once again. And as brother Paul was
[41:13] saying, we um we came out for the for
[41:15] the wedding there yesterday, but Amen. I
[41:17] was um thinking one day of brother
[41:19] getting and invite us to the wedding and
[41:21] I was thinking of some way to um to make
[41:24] it to make it work and I was trying to
[41:25] get back home for for service this
[41:27] morning and amen I realized that wasn't
[41:30] going to work and brother Paul and I had
[41:31] seen each other recently in Canada and
[41:33] so amen we're just happy to be here this
[41:35] morning and thankful that we were able
[41:36] to come by and see you all and amen I
[41:39] tell you um I think we were in Saskatoon
[41:41] there in November and uh walked
[41:43] downstairs one morning and there was
[41:44] brother Paul in the in the lobby eating
[41:46] breakfast at the hotel. So, I just said,
[41:48] "Well, the Lord had to bring us all the
[41:50] way to Canada, amen, to see each other.
[41:52] But we we sure love Brother Paul and
[41:54] Sister Jerry. God bless you all and just
[41:56] become real friends of ours." And Amen.
[41:58] We're honored to have Brother Thomas
[41:59] here with us this morning and come out
[42:01] for the wedding as well. But as brother
[42:04] Paul was saying, I believe we're here
[42:06] for for more than just a natural
[42:08] wedding. Amen. But I believe we're here
[42:10] for for the spiritual wedding, the
[42:12] marriage of the lamb that's taking
[42:13] place. And Amen. It is a real honor to
[42:15] be here with you today. And amen. We
[42:17] want to bring a greetings from our
[42:18] church there at home. Our pastor, uh,
[42:20] brother Matt Morris and the saints there
[42:22] at Grace Tabernacle in Black Rockck,
[42:24] Arkansas, uh, sends their greetings to
[42:26] you. So, I pulled up this morning and I
[42:28] said, "Well, I'm at Grace Tabernacle
[42:30] either way." Amen. So, amen. Let's just
[42:33] bow our hearts together this morning for
[42:34] a word of prayer. I wonder how many have
[42:36] a special need upon your heart,
[42:38] something you would just desire from the
[42:40] Lord. I know he's mindful and I know he
[42:42] is he is here this morning to meet the
[42:44] needs of his children. Heavenly Father,
[42:47] Lord, as your believers have gathered
[42:49] here on this resurrection Sunday,
[42:51] Father, Lord, we've not gathered here
[42:53] this morning to be seen or to be heard,
[42:56] Lord, we've not gathered here for just
[42:58] another service or just another
[43:00] gathering, Lord. But, Father, we've
[43:02] gathered here this morning under divine
[43:04] purpose, Lord. For your word said that
[43:07] wherever two or three would gather in my
[43:09] name, you said there, I will be in their
[43:12] midst. And Lord, as I look around this
[43:15] morning, there's believers here that
[43:17] have gathered not in the name of a
[43:19] church or in the name of a man, but
[43:21] we've gathered in the mighty powerful
[43:23] name of our savior, the Lord Jesus
[43:25] Christ. Now, Lord, as we look to you
[43:28] this morning, the songs of Zion have
[43:30] been sung. And Lord, the atmosphere has
[43:32] been created by the by the believers
[43:34] that your word could find a a rightway,
[43:37] could find access into our hearts. And
[43:40] Lord, this morning we're endeavoring to
[43:42] look into your word. But Lord, we know
[43:44] that if you would send spiritual
[43:46] strength among us, then it would be more
[43:48] than just a physical strength of opening
[43:50] this book we call the Bible. But Lord,
[43:53] it would be a spiritual strength opening
[43:55] our understanding. Now, Father, we
[43:57] invite you this morning, be the speaker
[43:59] among us today. Lord, as these believers
[44:02] have gathered here, Lord, I pray they
[44:04] would turn their attention now, Lord,
[44:06] from the things of life and the cares of
[44:08] life and the situations and problems, oh
[44:10] God. And Lord, may your word just come
[44:12] among us and minister this morning. Bind
[44:15] the hand of Satan, I pray, Lord, may
[44:17] deliverances take place here this
[44:19] morning, Father. Lord, if there be any
[44:21] sick among us, Lord, may this be the end
[44:23] of their suffering, Father. Lord, if
[44:25] there be any bound among us, may this be
[44:27] the end of bondage, oh God. Lord,
[44:29] whatever the the desires of the heart
[44:32] may be here this morning, I am
[44:33] confident, Lord, that your word is still
[44:35] a discerner of the thoughts and the
[44:37] intents of the heart. And Lord, it can
[44:40] pierce and it can go right direct to the
[44:42] need. So Lord, we surrender ourselves
[44:44] into your control this morning. Father,
[44:46] may you speak through me, Lord. May you
[44:48] hear through the believer. And Lord,
[44:50] when we would leave this meeting today,
[44:52] may we be able to say like those on the
[44:54] road to Emmas, did not our hearts burn
[44:57] within us, Lord. Not as brother Andrew
[44:59] came and talked to us or any other
[45:01] preacher, but Lord, as you came and
[45:03] talked to us along the way, and we'll be
[45:05] sure to give thee all the praise, all
[45:07] the honor, and all the glory in the
[45:09] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[45:12] Jesus Christ. We do pray. And all the
[45:14] believers says, "Amen." Amen. And amen.
[45:18] God richly bless you this morning. If
[45:19] you have your Bibles, we want to turn to
[45:21] the book of Psalms, the 65th chapter.
[45:24] The book of Psalms, the 65th chapter,
[45:27] and then we're also going to turn to
[45:28] Hebrews, chapter 4.
[45:31] Amen. It's so uh so nice to see everyone
[45:34] here again this morning. God bless you
[45:36] all. And I was just just telling brother
[45:38] Paul there in the in the back room, I
[45:39] was thinking this morning, I think every
[45:41] time we've ever been here to to minister
[45:43] to you has been in the month of June,
[45:45] around the first or second weekend of
[45:47] June. So, amen. Amen. I It's just good
[45:50] to be here with you all again. Amen.
[45:53] Psalms chapter
[45:54] 65 and verse number four. You love the
[45:58] Lord this morning. Amen. David here
[46:00] writing, he says, "Blessed is the man
[46:04] whom thou choostest and causest to
[46:07] approach unto thee, that he may dwell in
[46:10] thy courts, and we shall be satisfied
[46:14] with the goodness of thy house, even of
[46:18] thy holy temple." Amen. Blessed is the
[46:21] man whom thou choostest and causes to
[46:24] approach unto thee. Now in the book of
[46:27] Hebrews chapter 4, Hebrews chapter 4,
[46:30] it's a it's a very very familiar
[46:32] scripture to the believers. Brother
[46:34] Brandham uses it many many times uh in
[46:37] the message in Hebrews chapter 4 and
[46:40] verse number
[46:42] 12. Here he's uh Paul is writing in
[46:45] Hebrews 4:12. And he says, "Now for the
[46:48] word of God is quick and it is powerful
[46:51] and it is sharper than any two-edged
[46:53] sword. It pierces even to the dividing a
[46:56] sunder of the soul and of the spirit and
[47:00] of the joints and marrow and is a
[47:03] discerner of the thoughts and the
[47:05] intents of the heart. Now I love what
[47:07] Paul here is saying. It's not that it
[47:09] was a discerner of the thoughts and
[47:12] intents of the heart or it will be a
[47:14] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[47:16] the heart. But Paul calls this a present
[47:19] day promise that the word is a discerner
[47:22] of the thoughts and intent of the heart.
[47:25] Now in verse 13, neither is there any
[47:27] creature that is not manifest in his
[47:30] sight, but all things are naked and open
[47:33] under the eyes of him with whom we have
[47:35] to do. Seeing then that we have a great
[47:39] high priest. Now there again, not that
[47:41] we had or we will have, but we have
[47:45] right now a great high priest that is
[47:48] passed into the heavens, Jesus the son
[47:51] of God. Let us hold fast our profession.
[47:54] For we have not a high priest, which
[47:57] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[48:00] our infirmity, but was in all points
[48:02] tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
[48:07] So let us therefore come boldly unto the
[48:11] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[48:14] and find grace to help in the time of
[48:18] need. Amen. We ask the Lord this morning
[48:20] to add the blessing to the reading of
[48:21] his word as you can have your seats here
[48:23] this morning. I I want you by the help
[48:25] of the Lord for just a few moments if I
[48:27] could uh speak to you here of something
[48:29] that's just been burning on my heart
[48:31] here recently. And if I would if I would
[48:33] take a title this morning, I want to
[48:35] speak to you on this. A divine approach
[48:38] produces divine results. Amen. A divine
[48:43] approach produces divine results. You
[48:46] know, when you look there in the in the
[48:48] dictionary, Webster's dictionary, he
[48:51] will speak there of the word approach
[48:52] and he'll say this, it means to draw
[48:55] closer to. It means uh to make advances
[48:59] to especially in order to create a
[49:02] desired result. It is a means of access.
[49:06] So when you are approaching something,
[49:08] what you're desiring to do is you're
[49:10] desiring to receive something or you're
[49:13] desiring to to to partake of something.
[49:16] Amen. From that which you're
[49:17] approaching. Now in 1955 in Melzdc, the
[49:20] great prince and king, brother Ram said,
[49:22] "Now we found salvation that will save
[49:24] us from sin. It'll take the vilest woman
[49:27] or man, the drunker, the prostitute, and
[49:29] it will make them a child of God. He
[49:32] said, "Now, well, that same faith, the
[49:34] same power that will lift up a fallen
[49:37] man or woman with that." Amen. It'll
[49:39] work for us in many different ways.
[49:42] It'll heal our bodies. Amen. If you can
[49:44] just find the right approach, amen,
[49:47] you've got to find out how to do it. So,
[49:50] amen. The same faith that has operated
[49:52] underneath the administration of
[49:54] salvation, amen, has the same power,
[49:57] amen, to hail our bodies in the time of
[50:00] great need. Again, 1960, the Queen of
[50:02] Sheba, he says, you'll only get from
[50:04] God, Amen, the things that you're
[50:07] expecting from God in the way that you
[50:10] approach God. Now, now, this is
[50:12] something that you only get the things
[50:13] from God that you're expecting from God
[50:16] in the way that you approach God. He
[50:19] said, "So you've got to approach him,
[50:21] Amen, with reverence, with faith and
[50:24] believing that every word is true."
[50:26] Amen. When you approach God, you've got
[50:28] to approach him with reverence, amen,
[50:31] and with faith and a and believing,
[50:34] amen, that every word is true. Now, I'll
[50:37] just say this. I find, Amen, this
[50:39] studying, Brother Brandham, that our
[50:41] approach to God, Amen, it really
[50:43] matters, folks. Amen. And and and I find
[50:46] that when brother will talk about this,
[50:48] he'll say, "Now there is a right
[50:49] approach." Amen. And then there is a
[50:51] wrong approach. And he'll he'll preach
[50:53] an entire sermon on the approach to God.
[50:56] And I find it amazing what he does
[50:58] there. Amen. Is he makes a connection,
[51:01] amen, between our approach and our
[51:04] speech, amen, the words we use and the
[51:06] things that we say. He said, now in
[51:08] paragraph 7, notice the approach to God.
[51:11] He said, God has a way of approach. He
[51:14] said, 'You know, if you're going to
[51:15] visit a king, Amen, there's a way that
[51:18] you approach a king. He said, now let's
[51:20] make it more simpler. Amen. If you're
[51:22] going to approach a young lady to get
[51:23] acquainted with her, Amen. There is a
[51:26] certain approach. How many knows that?
[51:29] Amen. You married folks ought to know
[51:30] that there's a certain approach. See?
[51:33] Amen. He said, you don't just walk up
[51:35] there and say, "Hey there, like to meet
[51:36] you and shake your hand." Amen. And she
[51:39] isn't very much of a lady. Amen. She'll
[51:41] let you know where to get on and where
[51:42] to get off at. Amen. But there's a
[51:45] certain way you approach it. Amen.
[51:47] You've got to come up with respects,
[51:49] amen, to the lady and so forth. He said,
[51:51] now there's a way to approach all
[51:54] things. He said, there's a way to
[51:56] approach God. And if we don't know the
[51:58] approach to God, Amen. then we'll never
[52:00] be able to get an audience with God.
[52:03] Amen. See, in a court, you don't just
[52:05] walk up and the judge is on the stand.
[52:07] Now watch how he's saying this and walk
[52:09] up there and say, "Hey, judge." Amen. I
[52:11] want to talk to you a little bit. Amen.
[52:13] Somebody throw you out of the courtroom,
[52:15] lock you up. See? Amen. For disorderly
[52:17] conduct. Amen. See, there's a way. Amen.
[52:20] You have to approach the judge. He said,
[52:22] "Now, we must find the way of approach."
[52:25] Amen. To the great divine judge, amen,
[52:28] which is God himself. Now, now notice
[52:30] this. There's a way you approach a young
[52:32] lady. Amen. And there's a way that you
[52:35] speak to her. Amen. There's a way that
[52:37] you approach a judge. Amen. And there's
[52:39] a way that you speak to him. He said,
[52:42] "Now, there's a way that you approach
[52:43] God." And he said, "The way that you
[52:46] speak to him determines on whether
[52:48] you're going to get an audience with
[52:50] him, amen, or not." He said, "Now, when
[52:53] one time man through angelic beings
[52:55] perhaps when he came before the presence
[52:57] of his majesty, amen, the great king of
[53:00] heaven, Amen, perhaps approached in some
[53:02] other way, Amen. But since sin, amen,
[53:06] separated the relationship. Amen. Now
[53:09] sin separated the relationship. He said,
[53:12] "Now what you do, Amen. is you come
[53:14] God's provided approach." Amen. Just one
[53:18] time. Amen. And see what will happen.
[53:21] Amen. I'll say this. We as believers,
[53:24] amen, we do not approach God under fear.
[53:27] Amen. But rather we approach God under
[53:29] faith. And how many knows that faith is
[53:32] a revelation? Amen. It's a revelation of
[53:35] the will of God. Amen. So we do not
[53:37] approach God based on our feelings. We
[53:39] we do not approach God based on emotions
[53:42] or sensations. Amen. Or our education or
[53:45] our intellectual ability. Amen. But
[53:47] rather we approach God, amen, upon the
[53:50] basis of divine, amen, spiritual
[53:53] revelation. He said, "Now we find
[53:55] salvation." Amen. He said, "See, faith
[53:57] is not that loose." Amen. It's got to be
[54:00] based upon some noted fact.
[54:04] Amen. Faith has got to be based upon
[54:07] some noted fact. Amen. If you can if you
[54:09] can give me as much in my ear, I'll
[54:11] control it on my side. Thank you,
[54:12] brother. He said, you got to know
[54:14] something about what you're having faith
[54:15] in. Amen. Before you can have faith in
[54:18] it. Thank you, brother. Amen. So, we
[54:20] first must know, Amen, how and what
[54:23] God's desire is. He said, now what God's
[54:26] plan is and how to approach it. Amen.
[54:29] God by that plan. He said, "Then we can
[54:32] walk up boldly." Amen. To the throne of
[54:34] grace. Amen. Now, watch this. We can
[54:36] walk up boldly to the throne of grace.
[54:39] Amen. And we can plead what the plan is
[54:42] promised us. Amen. We can walk up
[54:45] boldly. Amen. To the throne of grace.
[54:48] Amen. And we can plead what the plan is
[54:51] promised us. Amen. Amen. I'm sorry.
[54:53] You're going to have to back it back
[54:54] down. I think it's compressing it on me.
[54:56] Amen. Amen. And I've been struggling
[54:58] heavy with my voice. So y'all pray for
[54:59] us this morning. So we first must know,
[55:02] amen, what God's desire is. How many
[55:04] wants to know, amen, what God's desire
[55:07] is. He said, what God's plan is and how
[55:10] to approach God by that plan. He said,
[55:13] then we can walk up boldly to the throne
[55:15] of grace and we can plead, Amen, what
[55:18] the plan is promised us. Now in the
[55:21] Garden of Eden, we find then, amen, that
[55:23] Adam knew the plan of God, right? Amen.
[55:26] He had he he knew what God desired.
[55:28] Amen. But then sin came in, which is
[55:31] unbelief. Amen. And it separated God and
[55:34] man. And we find then that what Adam did
[55:37] was he realized that he he had gotten in
[55:39] trouble. Amen. So he went and tried to
[55:41] make his own approach. Amen. But we find
[55:44] that God refused it. Amen. But I love
[55:47] this. Amen. When God refused Adam's
[55:49] approach, he did not leave him without
[55:52] an approach. Amen. But he provided Amen.
[55:55] an approach for Adam. And the provot
[55:58] approach he provided, amen, was through
[56:01] the shed blood. That's why Paul comes
[56:03] along in Hebrews 9:22 and says, "Almost
[56:06] all things, amen, are by the law purged
[56:10] with blood, amen, and without the
[56:12] shedding of blood, amen, is no remission
[56:16] of sin." Rebraham said, "Now Paul here
[56:19] in speaking the Hebrews, amen, was
[56:21] trying to tell the people that the
[56:23] approach to God, Amen, was through the
[56:26] bleeding sacrifice of the Lord Jesus
[56:29] Christ." He said, "That's how you
[56:30] approach him, Amen, is through Jesus.
[56:33] For he is, Amen, the lamb that takes
[56:36] away, Amen, the sin of the world." Amen.
[56:39] I love what the prophet said, Brother
[56:41] David. He said, "From that day until
[56:44] this day, it remains the same." Amen. It
[56:47] is still the blood. He said in Job there
[56:50] he offered the shed blood as he
[56:52] approached Jehovah. Amen. Knowing that
[56:55] God, Amen, would receive him upon
[56:58] nothing else. So when God when Job
[57:01] approached God, Job did not approach him
[57:03] by his education. He did not approach
[57:06] him by his by his intellectual ability,
[57:09] but he approached him by revelation.
[57:11] Amen. knowing this is the only thing
[57:14] that God will accept as a sacrifice. He
[57:18] said, "Now, if you approach him today in
[57:20] the name of a good man, I pay my debts.
[57:23] I don't cheat the government. I pay my
[57:25] tax. I do all these things. I'm a good
[57:27] neighbor." See, yet God will never hear
[57:29] you. That's right. Amen. Now, think
[57:32] about that, friends. God will never hear
[57:34] you. If you come approach and saying,
[57:36] "I'm a loyal church member. I tithe my
[57:39] money. I give good offerings in the
[57:40] church." Amen. God will never receive
[57:43] you. He said, you say, "Well, my mother
[57:45] was a good woman and my father was a
[57:47] good man and my grandfather was a
[57:49] preacher and all that I do. I never did
[57:51] this. I never stealed. I never drank. I
[57:54] never smoked. I never robbed. I never
[57:56] done any of these things." He said, "Yet
[57:58] God will never hear you. No matter who
[58:00] you are, how bad you been if you come
[58:03] God's provided way." Amen. Through the
[58:06] sacrificial blood. Amen. breaking and
[58:09] laying your hand upon the head of a dead
[58:12] of a dead of a dying lamb and confess
[58:14] your wrong and accept him. Amen. Then
[58:18] God will fill your soul with a holy
[58:21] spirit and he will burn out all the
[58:23] iniquity. He will burn out all the
[58:26] carnality and he will make you a new
[58:28] creature. There is no other way that sin
[58:32] can be remitted outside of the reproach
[58:35] that God has ordained by his way. Amen.
[58:38] I'll say this. Brother said it very
[58:40] beautiful. He said, "Either come God's
[58:42] provided approach." Amen. Or don't come
[58:44] at all. Amen. Don't either come God's
[58:47] provided approach. Amen. Or don't come
[58:49] at all. Now, we we read there in Psalm
[58:52] 65 and verse4. And I love it because
[58:54] David, Amen, being the psalmist. I love
[58:56] how he writes things, brother Paul. You
[58:58] know, he'll he he'll write one verse and
[59:00] pack it full, amen, of golden nuggets.
[59:03] And there in Psalm 65:4, he said,
[59:06] "Blessed is the man whom thou
[59:08] choostest."
[59:10] Amen. And cause us to approach unto
[59:13] thee. Now look at this word chooses. It
[59:15] means to choose, to elect, to decide
[59:18] for. Amen. To be selected. Look at this
[59:21] word approach. It means to come near. It
[59:24] means to enter into. It means to be
[59:26] brought near. It means to be present.
[59:29] Amen. So blessed is the man whom thou
[59:32] choosest, whom thou selected, whom thou
[59:35] decided for, amen, to enter into. I I
[59:38] heard Reb say something very beautiful
[59:39] this morning, the Revelation series in
[59:41] the Pat vision. He said, "Do you realize
[59:43] your name was put on the lamb's book of
[59:46] life from before the foundation of the
[59:48] world?" He said, "Then God chose you to
[59:51] receive the Holy Ghost in this age."
[59:54] Amen. Listen, folks. You didn't choose
[59:56] yourself. Amen. But God chose you. and
[59:59] Peter come along and said, "Ye are a
[1:00:01] chosen generation. You are a royal
[1:00:04] priesthood. You're a holy nation. You're
[1:00:07] a peculiar people that you should show
[1:00:09] forth the praises, amen, of him who hath
[1:00:13] called you out of darkness into
[1:00:15] marvelous light." Amen. Show me one
[1:00:18] thing, amen, that you did to get to
[1:00:20] where you are. Amen. If there's one
[1:00:22] thing you can do, Amen. then the blood
[1:00:25] was shed in vain and Christ died in
[1:00:27] vain. But I happen to believe it this
[1:00:30] morning that my Lord did not die in
[1:00:32] vain. And he did not shed his blood in
[1:00:34] vain, but he did it for a purpose. And
[1:00:37] that was to break the power of unbelief
[1:00:40] that was brought upon the human race
[1:00:41] through the fall in the garden and to
[1:00:43] establish a covenant between his seed
[1:00:46] and himself as believers. Amen. I
[1:00:49] believe it. I I love that word chosen
[1:00:51] generation. It means you're a choice.
[1:00:54] Amen. You're God's choice. You You are
[1:00:56] selected. Amen. It's the best of its
[1:00:59] kind or class. Amen. Amen. Oh my. Amen.
[1:01:03] It is excellence. It is preeminent.
[1:01:06] Listen. And it is applied. Amen. To
[1:01:08] certain individual Christians. Paul or
[1:01:11] Peter rather goes on to say in 1 Peter
[1:01:13] 2:10, he said, "Which in time past,
[1:01:16] Amen, were not a people, amen, but are
[1:01:19] now the people of God." Look here. Which
[1:01:23] had not obtained mercy, but now have
[1:01:26] obtained mercy. I'll say this, a chosen
[1:01:29] generation, amen, is a chosen people
[1:01:32] that has been chosen by God to be here
[1:01:36] at this time. Can I say this? You're not
[1:01:38] here by accident.
[1:01:41] You're not here by mistake. You're
[1:01:43] you're not here by some haphazard
[1:01:45] happening and you just happen to show
[1:01:47] up. No. My Bible says in Revelation 2:9,
[1:01:50] he says, "I know thy works and and the
[1:01:53] tribulation, the poverty, but thou art
[1:01:55] rich." Amen. And I know the blasphemy of
[1:01:57] them which are Jews and they're not, but
[1:02:00] are of the synagogue of Satan. He says
[1:02:03] in the church age book, the word Jews,
[1:02:06] amen, does not describe the religion of
[1:02:09] the Jewish people. It only refers to the
[1:02:12] people of Judah. He said, now it has the
[1:02:14] same precise meaning. if I were to say I
[1:02:17] am Irish born. He said these people were
[1:02:20] saying that they were actually Jews that
[1:02:22] they were real Jews by birth. He said
[1:02:24] but they were liars. Amen. They were not
[1:02:27] Jews by birth and they were not Jews by
[1:02:30] religion. Amen. If all this is true,
[1:02:32] what were they? They were a deceived
[1:02:34] people who were already part of the
[1:02:37] church. He said they belong to the false
[1:02:40] thine. They were not of the true church
[1:02:42] but of the false church because God said
[1:02:45] they were of the synagogue of Satan. He
[1:02:48] said now the word for synagogue is not
[1:02:51] the same word we use for church in the
[1:02:53] Bible. The church amen means the called
[1:02:56] out ones. It means the summoned ones.
[1:02:59] Amen. The psalmist said in Psalm 65:4,
[1:03:02] he said, "Blessed is the man whom thou
[1:03:05] choostest and causest to approach unto
[1:03:08] thee, that he may dwell in thy courts."
[1:03:11] Amen. See, the meaning of synagogue is
[1:03:14] assembly or gathering. Amen. This can be
[1:03:16] good or bad, but in this case, it's bad.
[1:03:19] Amen. For these are they who themselves
[1:03:22] are assembling, but their assembling is
[1:03:25] not of God. Amen. But their assembling
[1:03:27] is of their own selves. Amen. So, in
[1:03:30] other words, they're not there because
[1:03:32] God called them to be there. They're not
[1:03:34] there because God chose them to be there
[1:03:36] or God selected them or God summoned
[1:03:39] them to be there, but they're there
[1:03:41] because they put himself there. But I
[1:03:43] can say this morning, I am preaching to
[1:03:45] a people who is not where you are
[1:03:48] because you put yourself there. A but
[1:03:50] God who is rich in mercy. Amen. Where he
[1:03:54] loved us. Amen. He predestinated us and
[1:03:57] he elected us and he called us and
[1:03:59] summoned us and chose us and put us
[1:04:02] where we are this morning. Isaiah 54:15
[1:04:06] said, "Amen. Behold, they shall surely
[1:04:08] gather together, but not by me." Amen.
[1:04:11] They'll surely gather together. Amen.
[1:04:13] But not by me. Amen. Now watch here.
[1:04:16] Whosoever shall gather together against
[1:04:18] thee, Amen, shall fall for thy sake. Now
[1:04:21] I love it because Amen. There was a
[1:04:23] there was a prophet come in the land.
[1:04:26] Yeah. Amen. The seventh angel in
[1:04:28] Revelation 10:7, what he does, Amen. as
[1:04:31] a prophet of God. How many knows the
[1:04:33] word of the Lord comes to the prophet?
[1:04:34] Amen. Is it okay to preach a little bit
[1:04:36] this morning? Amen. The word of the Lord
[1:04:38] comes to the prophet, right? Amen. Now
[1:04:41] watch this. Amen. And that prophet
[1:04:43] brings the word and he identifies things
[1:04:45] by the word. He don't identify things by
[1:04:48] the way he feels. He don't identify
[1:04:50] things by the way somebody else thinks
[1:04:51] it ought to be identified. He identifies
[1:04:54] it by the word. So what he done was he
[1:04:56] identified the provided approach to God.
[1:05:00] Amen. By the word. And the first thing
[1:05:02] he did was he said denomination. Amen.
[1:05:05] Does not know the approach to God. Amen.
[1:05:08] I'll say this because the approach to
[1:05:11] God, Amen, is through Christ. Amen. And
[1:05:14] and and Christ is the spirit and he is
[1:05:18] the truth. In St. John 4:22, they Jesus
[1:05:21] says, "Amen. You worship, but you know
[1:05:23] not what." Amen. We know what we
[1:05:26] worship. Amen. For salvation is of the
[1:05:28] Jews. But the hour cometh and now.
[1:05:31] Somebody say, "Now."
[1:05:33] The hour cometh and now is, when the
[1:05:36] true worshippers, amen, shall worship
[1:05:39] the father in spirit and in truth. Look
[1:05:42] here. For the father seeketh such, amen,
[1:05:45] to worship him. Amen. Can I show you
[1:05:47] something? Amen. The woman at the well,
[1:05:50] Amen, did not put herself in the
[1:05:52] position she was in when she met the
[1:05:55] Messiah. As a matter of fact, amen, she
[1:05:57] didn't even go to the well when others
[1:05:59] went to the well. She went at a specific
[1:06:02] time. But what put her there was there
[1:06:04] was a seed on the inside of her soul
[1:06:07] that was ordained from almighty God.
[1:06:10] Amen. To stand at the feet of the
[1:06:12] Messiah and to receive the promise of
[1:06:14] the hour. He said, "Now God is a spirit
[1:06:17] and they that worship him," Amen, they
[1:06:20] must worship him in spirit
[1:06:25] and in truth. Now, I love what the
[1:06:28] prophet says in the church age book of
[1:06:29] the Patmas vision. He said, "Then most
[1:06:31] of them go to church on Sunday." That is
[1:06:33] good. But even there, they have no idea
[1:06:36] of how to approach God and how to
[1:06:38] worship him. Jesus said the true worship
[1:06:41] was in spirit and in truth. He said, '
[1:06:44] But what kind of worship can you get in
[1:06:46] a church that knows so little of God?
[1:06:48] Amen. That it puts up a Santa Claus at
[1:06:50] Christmas and bunnies at Easter. He
[1:06:53] said, "Where did they get that?" Amen.
[1:06:55] They got it from the pagans. That's
[1:06:57] right. That's right. And they made it a
[1:07:00] part of the church doctrine. But when
[1:07:03] one turns to the Lord and is filled with
[1:07:07] the Holy Ghost, he ceases from all such
[1:07:10] things. He has a rest in his soul and he
[1:07:14] really begins to live and love God and
[1:07:18] worship him. Now, I'll just say this.
[1:07:20] Amen. I believe that brother Brandham,
[1:07:22] Amen, was so strong on this area of
[1:07:25] approach to God because he knew what it
[1:07:28] was like to be unaware of the divine
[1:07:31] approach to God. Amen. Remember he says
[1:07:34] there uh to to to and and he's speaking
[1:07:37] there he says in the power of decision
[1:07:40] he said now uh just step in the light
[1:07:42] one time and he said oh he said you
[1:07:44] outside of Christ the winds will come
[1:07:46] back again like they was on the day of
[1:07:48] Pentecost. Amen. Just keep walking in
[1:07:50] the light. See and it'll separate the
[1:07:52] thing that was hindering you from one
[1:07:54] side to the other. Now brother Bam you
[1:07:56] you all heard the story. Amen. Brother
[1:07:57] Bam said I went down there to pray and
[1:07:59] he said I didn't know how to pray. He
[1:08:01] said, "I didn't know how to read my
[1:08:03] Bible." He said, "I didn't know how to
[1:08:04] shout or didn't know how." He said, "I
[1:08:06] didn't know anything." He said, "But I
[1:08:08] went down there and I took a piece of
[1:08:09] paper." And he said, "I wrote a note to
[1:08:11] God." And he said, "I am Emy's heard
[1:08:13] that." He said, "I tacked it on the
[1:08:15] tree." Right? And he said, I said,
[1:08:16] "Well, Lord," Amen. Here I am. Just come
[1:08:18] down. I want to talk to you a
[1:08:20] minute. He said, "But here's the thing."
[1:08:23] Amen. The main thing is he came. Now, I
[1:08:26] find this amazing. Amen. He said, "Now,
[1:08:28] what happened was, Amen. was he was so
[1:08:31] unworthy in himself. Amen. But he was
[1:08:33] willing to become humble. Now, I'll just
[1:08:35] say this. Amen. The divine channel of
[1:08:38] approach to a divine God is through
[1:08:41] humility. That's why Peter said,
[1:08:43] "Likewise, Amen, ye younger, submit
[1:08:45] yourselves to the elder." Amen. Yay, all
[1:08:47] of you be subject one to another and be
[1:08:50] clothed with humility. Amen. For God
[1:08:54] resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to
[1:08:57] the humble. Amen. God resisteth the
[1:09:00] proud, but he give grace to the humble.
[1:09:02] He says, "So humble yourselves therefore
[1:09:06] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[1:09:09] exalt you in due time." You all know
[1:09:12] that the hand of God is mighty. You know
[1:09:14] the hand of God is powerful. Do you know
[1:09:16] the same hand that exalts is the same
[1:09:19] hand that humbles?
[1:09:21] That's right. Amen. The same hand that
[1:09:24] brings down is the same hand that brings
[1:09:27] up. Reb said, "As we humble ourselves,
[1:09:29] amen, under the hand and the moving of
[1:09:32] the mighty living God," he said, "I
[1:09:34] pray, Lord," Amen. "I pray, Lord, that
[1:09:37] you'll provide to the people, that you
[1:09:39] are the great Jehovah. You are the great
[1:09:41] God of heaven. That you'll show your
[1:09:44] power to save and your power to heal and
[1:09:46] your power to perform miracles. Amen. To
[1:09:49] do that which is unknown to man." Now,
[1:09:51] you all remember said it very beautiful.
[1:09:53] He said, "Always remember that the way
[1:09:55] up is down." Right. Amen. The way up is
[1:09:58] down. He said, "See, like you see people
[1:10:01] and
[1:10:02] they they really want power." He said,
[1:10:05] "But they don't know what power is."
[1:10:06] See, he said, "They really don't know
[1:10:08] what goes with it." Amen. The way up is
[1:10:11] down. He said, "If you want power, Amen.
[1:10:14] then see how humble you can get." Amen.
[1:10:16] Just get away from all your worldly
[1:10:18] thinking and humble yourself before God.
[1:10:21] And then you've got more power than the
[1:10:23] man that runs all over the building,
[1:10:25] makes a big lot of noise. Amen. See,
[1:10:27] because you have been able to conquer
[1:10:30] yourself and commit yourself to Christ.
[1:10:33] Amen. To humble yourself before him. He
[1:10:35] said, "Now that's really power." Amen.
[1:10:38] Show me a church that's humble. Amen.
[1:10:41] Real humble. Not an arrogancy. A church
[1:10:43] just a sweet humble church. He said,
[1:10:46] "I'll show you." Amen. a church that has
[1:10:48] the favor and the power of God in it.
[1:10:51] Amen. That's the thing. Amen. The
[1:10:53] humility, humbling ourselves before God
[1:10:56] and letting God just work through us.
[1:10:59] Amen. I love this. He said, "I've always
[1:11:01] found out that the man that humbles
[1:11:04] himself is the man that God exalts."
[1:11:07] Y'all remember Burbam talked about that
[1:11:09] preacher went up there to preach. He
[1:11:10] said he went up there with his chest
[1:11:11] stuck out and his head held high. And he
[1:11:13] said he went up there and he preached a
[1:11:15] little bit and he got done and he said
[1:11:16] he come down with his head down and his
[1:11:18] chest all tucked in. He said, "Now what
[1:11:21] happened was, Amen." He said he went up.
[1:11:23] He said if he would have went up the way
[1:11:25] he come down, he would have come down
[1:11:27] the way he went up. Amen. See what he's
[1:11:29] showing you is, Amen. When something in
[1:11:31] your presence comes that is greater than
[1:11:34] you are, you've got to humble yourself
[1:11:36] to it if you're going to be used of it.
[1:11:39] Amen. When Moses seen the pillar of
[1:11:41] fire, he did not exalt himself above the
[1:11:44] pillar of fire, but he approached the
[1:11:46] pillar of fire. And the prophet of God
[1:11:48] said, "What did he do?" He took his
[1:11:50] shoes off.
[1:11:52] Amen. He took his shoes off. Amen.
[1:11:54] Because the voice said, "Amen. You're on
[1:11:57] holy ground." He said, "That's what it
[1:11:59] is today." Amen. The reason people don't
[1:12:01] get get very much today is because it's
[1:12:03] an irreverent approach. Amen. You've got
[1:12:06] to come with a full surrendered madeup
[1:12:09] mind when you come to God. Don't just
[1:12:11] come haphazardly. Come up and beat on
[1:12:14] the altar and chew the chew and gum.
[1:12:16] Amen. That's not the way to come to God.
[1:12:18] You come just as sane as you can come
[1:12:22] and mean what you're talking about.
[1:12:24] Amen. There it is again, brother Paul.
[1:12:26] The connection, Amen, between our
[1:12:28] approach and our speech.
[1:12:32] When you come to God, you come as sane
[1:12:36] and solid as can, but you come reverent
[1:12:39] and know and mean what you're talking
[1:12:41] about. He said, "And God showed Moses's
[1:12:44] glory." Amen. All 40 years of training
[1:12:47] of his dear mother. Amen. Give him on
[1:12:49] theology and all he had learned out in
[1:12:51] the textbooks and made a failure out of
[1:12:52] it. Amen. But in five minutes time,
[1:12:55] Amen. He surrendered in the presence of
[1:12:57] the fire of God. He was better equipped
[1:13:00] than all the equipment in the world
[1:13:02] could make him. And I say today, what
[1:13:04] our seminaries and preachers need is not
[1:13:06] a great long education. Amen. Several
[1:13:09] years of schooling. Amen. They need to
[1:13:12] come in the presence of the living God.
[1:13:15] Now, watch this. And get a revelation of
[1:13:18] his divine will and his power and
[1:13:22] approach. And not in a critical
[1:13:24] standpoint. Well, my church don't
[1:13:26] believe it. Amen. But take off your
[1:13:28] shoes when you approach it and come
[1:13:31] reverence. Amen. You've got to come
[1:13:34] under a power and a revelation of the
[1:13:37] divine will of God. Listen folks, this
[1:13:39] is not a divine approach. Amen. And I'll
[1:13:42] say this, if we would change the way we
[1:13:44] approach our services, we would leave
[1:13:46] with different results. Amen. We
[1:13:48] approach supernatural services under a
[1:13:51] natural Amen. mindset. Well, this is
[1:13:53] just Sunday morning. It's just brother
[1:13:55] Paul or it's just brother David or it's
[1:13:58] just some other preacher. Amen. And
[1:14:00] that's why you leave with nothing is
[1:14:02] because you come under a critical
[1:14:04] standpoint. But if you would come like
[1:14:06] Moses come and take off your shoes and
[1:14:09] say this is the house of the living God.
[1:14:12] It is the breaking of the bread of his
[1:14:14] presence. It is the revealing of the son
[1:14:17] of man. It is the shout of the king.
[1:14:20] Amen. Coming in the camp. You would
[1:14:22] leave with a different result.
[1:14:25] Come on, folks. Amen. I think we ought
[1:14:27] to start putting more in our services.
[1:14:30] I guess it's just the evangelist coming
[1:14:32] out, but are you hearing me? Amen.
[1:14:34] Sometimes we'd get more out
[1:14:37] if we would put more in.
[1:14:40] Now, y'all y'all remember, I'm sure
[1:14:42] you've heard that story of the of the
[1:14:43] the father and his son went to church
[1:14:45] and they passed the offering bucket
[1:14:47] around and his father just reached in
[1:14:49] there and pulled out a dollar and threw
[1:14:50] in the offering bucket, sat through the
[1:14:52] service and got up and went home and on
[1:14:54] the way home he was riding down the road
[1:14:56] and he just started complaining, you
[1:14:57] know. He said, "Well, the music was too
[1:14:59] loud and the preacher was too loud and
[1:15:02] it was too hard on the bench and it was
[1:15:04] too quiet in here." He just complained
[1:15:06] it was too hot, it was too cold. And
[1:15:08] after about five minutes of complaining,
[1:15:10] his son looked over and he said, "Well,
[1:15:11] dad," he said, "you know, I thought it's
[1:15:13] pretty good for a
[1:15:15] dollar." See, amen. What you put in it
[1:15:19] is what you're going to get out of it.
[1:15:21] Amen. Now, you say, "Well, that's
[1:15:22] money." Well, let's move from money from
[1:15:24] from from from from from a from money
[1:15:27] standpoint to the spiritual standpoint.
[1:15:29] I could care less about your money.
[1:15:31] Amen. But what are you putting in this
[1:15:33] service? Are you putting your best amen
[1:15:35] in it? Are you putting your best
[1:15:37] hallelujah? Amen. Are you putting your
[1:15:39] best song in it? Are you putting your
[1:15:41] best attitude in it? Are you approaching
[1:15:43] it as just another Sunday? Or are you
[1:15:45] approaching it as an audience with God
[1:15:48] who is the King of Kings? He is the Lord
[1:15:50] of Lords. I say we ought to change our
[1:15:53] approach. We ought to change the way we
[1:15:55] approach the things of God. Amen. We
[1:15:57] don't need to come under a natural
[1:15:59] approach. We need to come under a divine
[1:16:01] approach because divine I love this.
[1:16:04] Amen. divine. It means of God. It means
[1:16:08] from God or like God. Amen. Or a God.
[1:16:12] Can I say this? Our God is the divine
[1:16:16] God.
[1:16:17] And I'll say this, we are the manifested
[1:16:20] divine attributes of the divine God. You
[1:16:24] can find that in future home. He said
[1:16:26] the divine architect has prepared it and
[1:16:29] designed it. He said, 'Now what a place
[1:16:32] it must be when a divine nature, a
[1:16:35] divine architect has designed it for a
[1:16:38] divine attribute that has been divinely
[1:16:41] predestinated by a divine God who is the
[1:16:45] author of divine life. There is a divine
[1:16:49] God who has predestinated Amen. a
[1:16:53] divinely predestinated attribute. Amen.
[1:16:56] Who is the author of divine life? Can I
[1:16:59] say this? You're not just a church.
[1:17:02] Amen. You're not just a group of people.
[1:17:04] Amen. Gathered in a building this
[1:17:06] morning. You are the divine bride who
[1:17:09] has been elected by divine
[1:17:11] predestination to approach the divine
[1:17:14] God. I love what says in the church age
[1:17:17] book. He said, "If you can see the truth
[1:17:20] on the election of God, then you can see
[1:17:23] many things." He said, I know I'll just
[1:17:26] add this in here, brother Paul. There's
[1:17:28] no wonder that Satan hates, Amen. the
[1:17:30] teaching of election. Amen. In the
[1:17:33] church age, brother said this. He said
[1:17:35] the teaching of election will cause
[1:17:38] emotions to rise. Amen. Can I say it
[1:17:41] like this? From Genesis to Revelation.
[1:17:43] Amen. God has established, Amen. his
[1:17:46] covenant upon the basis of election.
[1:17:50] Amen. In the book of Genesis, we find,
[1:17:52] Amen, that it was never God, man seeking
[1:17:54] God. Amen. It was God seeking man. Amen.
[1:17:58] Adam ran from God and God went seeking
[1:18:02] Adam. Right. Amen. Breaks it up in the
[1:18:06] church age book in St. John 6:37. He
[1:18:08] says, "All the Father giveth me shall
[1:18:10] come to me. And he and and him that
[1:18:12] cometh to me I shall in no wise cast
[1:18:14] out." Now look in verse 44. "And no man
[1:18:18] come to me except the Father draws him.
[1:18:20] And I will raise him up in the last
[1:18:23] day." In John 1:12, as many as received
[1:18:26] him, amen, to them gave he power to
[1:18:29] become the sons of God. Amen. Even to
[1:18:32] them that believe on his name. Now, let
[1:18:34] me let me drop something to you. That's
[1:18:37] not making yourself a son of God. But
[1:18:39] that's power to recognize that you
[1:18:42] always were a son of God. From before
[1:18:45] the foundation of the world, if your
[1:18:48] name was on the lamb's book of life, you
[1:18:50] always were a son and daughter of God.
[1:18:54] That's exactly Ephesians 1:4, according
[1:18:56] as he had chosen us in him before the
[1:18:58] foundation of the world that we should
[1:19:00] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:19:03] love. Look here, having predestinated us
[1:19:06] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:19:08] Christ himself, according to the good
[1:19:11] pleasure of his will. Now let me ask you
[1:19:13] something. What is his will? His will is
[1:19:17] his word. And what is his word? His word
[1:19:20] is himself. So it was God's desire to
[1:19:24] choose you to be here at this time. Oh
[1:19:28] God. Amen. And the only thing that could
[1:19:30] bring you to that understanding was a
[1:19:33] divine revelation from a divine God. He
[1:19:36] said, "Now Jesus Christ is choosing his
[1:19:39] own bride just the same as men choose
[1:19:42] their brides today." Always remember
[1:19:44] this. Ye did not choose me, but I have
[1:19:47] chosen you. Amen. Remember said, "Then
[1:19:50] that's according to the word of God."
[1:19:52] That the bride was chosen before the
[1:19:56] foundation of the world. So the choosing
[1:19:58] of the bride was purposed in himself.
[1:20:01] Amen. Romans 9:11 says that the purpose
[1:20:04] of God according to election might
[1:20:08] stand. He said now you cannot read it
[1:20:10] any other way that the heart purpose the
[1:20:13] eternal purpose of God was to take of
[1:20:16] his bride a bride of his own choosing
[1:20:19] and that purpose was in himself and
[1:20:22] being eternal was decreed before the
[1:20:26] foundation of the world. Amen. Let me
[1:20:29] say this to you. The reason that you're
[1:20:31] here this morning is because you were
[1:20:34] there before the foundation of the
[1:20:37] world. And because you was there is why
[1:20:40] you're here. And why you know you'll be
[1:20:42] there is because you're here. Listen
[1:20:45] folks, it's not in your ability. It's
[1:20:48] not in your family bloodline. It's not
[1:20:50] in a human genealogology. It's in the
[1:20:52] purpose of God which comes by the
[1:20:55] election of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:59] You didn't choose yourself. You didn't
[1:21:01] make yourself bride. Amen. If you ever
[1:21:03] was bride, it's because God before the
[1:21:06] foundation of the world chose you. Amen.
[1:21:10] Amen. He chose you to be the bride. Now,
[1:21:13] now I'll say this. At one time, this
[1:21:16] divine God we're speaking of, he was
[1:21:18] unapproachable. That's right.
[1:21:21] Y'all ever heard that before? Amen.
[1:21:24] Unapproachable. You know, Amen. And I've
[1:21:26] had people say, "Well, you're just
[1:21:27] unapproachable." Well, the funny thing
[1:21:29] is they never even tried to approach me,
[1:21:31] you know, but I'm all of a sudden
[1:21:33] unapproachable, you know. But but here,
[1:21:36] I'll move on. That's a sermon for
[1:21:37] another day. That the but but the
[1:21:39] unapproachable God, Amen, at one time
[1:21:42] was un this divine God at one time was
[1:21:46] unapproachable because you cannot
[1:21:48] approach him based on who you are. You
[1:21:51] cannot approach him based on based on
[1:21:53] what you think about who he is. You
[1:21:55] cannot approach him based on what some
[1:21:57] denomination taught you that God is. You
[1:22:00] cannot approach him based on the money
[1:22:01] in your bank account or the clothes on
[1:22:03] your body or the car that you drive or
[1:22:06] the house that you live in or the
[1:22:07] education that you hold. There's got to
[1:22:10] be a divine approach to a divine God if
[1:22:13] you're going to get an audience with
[1:22:14] him. In John chapter 1 verse one, it
[1:22:17] says, "In the beginning was the word."
[1:22:19] Now, I want I want to take a moment here
[1:22:21] and lay this down, okay? In the
[1:22:23] beginning was the word and the root from
[1:22:25] which we get our translation for word is
[1:22:28] logos which logos means thought or
[1:22:31] concept. It has the double meaning of
[1:22:34] thought and speech. Amen. It has the
[1:22:37] double meaning of thought and speech. He
[1:22:40] said now a thought expressed is a word
[1:22:44] or words. So when you think something
[1:22:46] about something you express it in words.
[1:22:49] Isn't that wonderful and beautiful that
[1:22:52] John says, "Amen, that the concept of
[1:22:55] God was expressed in Jesus."
[1:23:00] Again, Hebrews 1:1, you can read it when
[1:23:01] you get home through verse three. Now,
[1:23:03] look here, that God became expressed in
[1:23:07] the person of Jesus Christ. He said,
[1:23:10] "Now Jesus was the expressed image of
[1:23:13] God." Amen. again in John 1:14, "And the
[1:23:16] word, the expressed image, the the
[1:23:18] thought of God, the word was made flesh
[1:23:21] and dwelt among us." Now look here, the
[1:23:24] very substance of God was made flesh and
[1:23:27] dwelt among us. Now the great spirit God
[1:23:31] unto which no man could approach, which
[1:23:33] no man had seen or could behold, but was
[1:23:37] now. Somebody say now. Amen. I'm I' I've
[1:23:40] not lost my mind. Okay. Now has come the
[1:23:43] hour of true worship. Amen. Here he
[1:23:46] says, "But now tabernacled in flesh and
[1:23:49] dwelt among men, expressing the fullness
[1:23:52] of God to men." If you wanted to know
[1:23:55] what God was thinking, you just looked
[1:23:58] at Jesus because Jesus was the concept
[1:24:01] of God. Oh God. Hey, Jesus was the
[1:24:05] expressed image of God. In John 1:18,
[1:24:07] "No man has seen God at any time, the
[1:24:09] only begotten Son, which is in the bosom
[1:24:12] of the Father. He hath declared him."
[1:24:16] Come on, folks. Jesus was doing more
[1:24:18] than just walking around performing
[1:24:20] miracles. He was doing more than just
[1:24:22] causing trouble at the local temple. He
[1:24:25] was expressing the power of God. He was
[1:24:28] declaring what God was thinking in
[1:24:31] flesh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now he says the
[1:24:35] word declare is taken from the Greek
[1:24:37] root word which we often interpret as
[1:24:40] exagus which means to thoroughly explain
[1:24:44] and make clear.
[1:24:46] Oh mercy. When you seen Jesus you seen
[1:24:50] that God was thoroughly explained and
[1:24:54] made clear. He said that is what the
[1:24:56] living word Jesus did. Listen, he
[1:25:00] brought God to us for he was God.
[1:25:05] Now, come on, church. He wasn't bringing
[1:25:07] a thought from God. He was God. Amen. He
[1:25:11] said, see, he revealed God to us with
[1:25:14] such perfect clarity that John could say
[1:25:17] this about him in 1 John 1:1. That which
[1:25:20] was from the beginning, which we have
[1:25:21] heard. Logos means speech, which we have
[1:25:24] seen with our eyes, which we've looked
[1:25:25] upon, and our hands have handled of the
[1:25:28] word of life. For the life was
[1:25:30] manifested, and we have seen it, and
[1:25:32] bear witness, and show unto you, that
[1:25:35] eternal life which was with the Father,
[1:25:38] and was manifested unto us, that which
[1:25:40] we have seen, and heard, declare we unto
[1:25:44] you, that ye also may have fellowship
[1:25:46] with us. And truly our fellowship is
[1:25:51] with the father and with his son Jesus
[1:25:54] Christ. Yes sir. Now brother says it
[1:25:57] beautiful. He says when God was truly
[1:26:00] revealed he was manifested in the flesh.
[1:26:04] Amen. Woo brother. When God was truly
[1:26:08] revealed he was manifested in the flesh.
[1:26:11] Now watch this. He that has seen me
[1:26:15] hath seen the father. So God was
[1:26:18] manifested in the flesh to desire to
[1:26:20] satisfy. Amen. The desire to see God.
[1:26:24] Let me say this. If there's a desire,
[1:26:27] there has to be a satisfaction to that
[1:26:29] desire. That's why David said, "Whom
[1:26:32] thou causest and chooses to approach of
[1:26:34] thee, and we will be satisfied."
[1:26:38] Amen. I love 2 Chronicles 15:15. All
[1:26:41] that Judah rejoiced at the oath, for
[1:26:43] they had sworn with their heart and
[1:26:45] sought him with their whole desire, and
[1:26:48] he was found of them. Look here. And the
[1:26:52] Lord gave them rest round about in 1
[1:26:54] Peter 2:2, as newborn babes, amen,
[1:26:57] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[1:27:00] you may grow thereby. Brother said it
[1:27:03] like this. He said, 'We ought to be
[1:27:04] great giants in God today,
[1:27:08] not little bitty children. As long as
[1:27:10] Christ has been with us and blessing us
[1:27:13] and doing the things he has and we see
[1:27:15] his great works and still babies. Paul
[1:27:17] said when we ought to be able to give
[1:27:19] meat, we're not able to take meat
[1:27:21] because we're still giving milk. Amen.
[1:27:25] Amen. Still have to take the milk, the
[1:27:27] sincere milk of the gospel, then you
[1:27:30] should be strong and eating meat. Now,
[1:27:33] now you should be strong and eating
[1:27:35] meat.
[1:27:37] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:27:41] Y'all forgive me for drinking on the
[1:27:42] job. Still have to take the milk, the
[1:27:45] sincere milk of the gospel. Now, look
[1:27:47] here. When we see what God does, his
[1:27:50] great mighty works, his word vindicated.
[1:27:53] He said we should be big and burly.
[1:27:55] Right now, that's what Abraham said.
[1:27:58] That's what Abraham saw when El Shadai
[1:28:00] come to him. He said, "I'm the strong
[1:28:02] one. I'm the allsufficient one." In
[1:28:05] other words, what he's saying is we
[1:28:08] don't have to take a substitutionary
[1:28:11] satisfaction because a
[1:28:14] substitutionary satisfaction is a false
[1:28:16] satisfaction. Bur said it very
[1:28:18] beautiful. He said, "That's what the
[1:28:20] Holy Ghost is to the church today."
[1:28:21] Amen. Silver and gold have I none, but I
[1:28:25] have a satisfying portion. He said,
[1:28:28] "Now, we're always talking about our
[1:28:29] insurance today." Amen. To give the
[1:28:31] undertaker. He said, "But let's get
[1:28:33] God's satisfying portion and get the
[1:28:37] uptaker instead of the undertaker." Now,
[1:28:39] now, now I want to I want to I want to
[1:28:41] show you something here because this is
[1:28:43] not milk, folks. That's right. That's
[1:28:45] exactly right.
[1:28:47] Amen. Amen. Predestination is not milk.
[1:28:50] No, sir. It's called meat. In Jeremiah
[1:28:54] 1:5, Amen. God told Jeremiah, he said,
[1:28:58] "Before you was formed in the womb of
[1:29:00] your mother," he says, "I knew thee."
[1:29:02] And now, now, now, now, folks, I just
[1:29:04] got to preach here for a second. What
[1:29:06] he's saying is all the way back at the
[1:29:09] time of
[1:29:10] conception before the child was
[1:29:12] conceived in the womb of the mother. He
[1:29:15] says, "I already knew you and I claimed
[1:29:18] you as my people." That's right. Amen.
[1:29:21] What did Peter say? You are a chosen
[1:29:24] generation. That's right. Amen. You are
[1:29:27] a royal priesthood. You are a holy
[1:29:30] nation. But what brought you from not
[1:29:32] being a people to being the people. I'll
[1:29:35] tell you what done it was the election
[1:29:37] of almighty God. Look what David said in
[1:29:39] Psalms 125:1. He says, "They that trust
[1:29:42] in the Lord shall be as mount Zion,
[1:29:45] which cannot be removed, but abideth
[1:29:48] forever as the mountains are round about
[1:29:51] Jerusalem." Listen. So the Lord is
[1:29:55] around about his people from henceforth
[1:29:59] even forever. Listen. Amen. That people
[1:30:03] that was not a people but is now the
[1:30:06] people of God. The Lord is around about
[1:30:09] his people. Amen. I love this. Amen.
[1:30:11] It's it's from a commentary. It's not
[1:30:13] from a vindicated prophet. So take it or
[1:30:15] leave it. It's not of authority. But I I
[1:30:16] just thought it was good. So the Lord is
[1:30:19] around about his people as Jerusalem is
[1:30:23] thus protected by the hills around.
[1:30:26] Amen. So the people of God are protected
[1:30:29] by Yahweh. He surrounds the church. He
[1:30:32] is exalted far above the church. Now
[1:30:35] listen, he guards the approaches to the
[1:30:38] church. He can defend it from all its
[1:30:40] foes. Under his protection, the church
[1:30:44] is safe. As Jerusalem is surrounded by
[1:30:48] hills and mountains and has thus become
[1:30:50] an emblem of the church at all times,
[1:30:53] its security was an emblem of the
[1:30:57] security of all who trust in the Lord.
[1:31:01] You say, "Who is Yahweh?" 1954, Reb
[1:31:04] said, Yahweh is God. Amen. So God Oh,
[1:31:07] God. Amen. So there is an approach to
[1:31:10] God but God has an approach to the
[1:31:13] church as Abraham had an approach
[1:31:16] through a name. Amen. We have an
[1:31:18] approach to the name of God. Abraham was
[1:31:20] called. He was justified. He was
[1:31:23] sanctified. He said there the word in
[1:31:25] Hebrew L means almighty means El Shadai
[1:31:28] which means the almighty one or L means
[1:31:31] God and shad means breath uh breast
[1:31:34] rather and Shadi in the plural I am the
[1:31:39] almighty amen I'm the strong one I'm the
[1:31:43] allsufficient one he said now see when
[1:31:46] that little baby is sick and he's
[1:31:48] fretting he got a tummy ache as long as
[1:31:51] he's laying on his mother's arms
[1:31:55] and he's nursing. It satisfies him. He
[1:31:59] said, "Now look here. Abraham believed
[1:32:00] God then cuz he had an approach to a
[1:32:02] symbol through a name. So have we an
[1:32:06] approach through a name and it's Jesus."
[1:32:10] It said, "And he shall save his people."
[1:32:14] Amen. He shall save his people from
[1:32:18] their sins. What does Jesus mean to us?
[1:32:21] Savior, El Shadai, to Abraham, the
[1:32:25] satisfier, the strong one, the salvation
[1:32:28] giver, the strength giver. Now listen,
[1:32:31] the same thing El Shadai was to Abraham,
[1:32:35] Jesus is to the believer. The same thing
[1:32:39] that El Shadi was to Abraham. Amen.
[1:32:42] Jesus is the belie to the believer. Let
[1:32:45] me say this. Jesus, Amen, is God's gift
[1:32:48] to the believer. And a true gift from
[1:32:50] God has a voice. Amen. I'll say this.
[1:32:53] Amen. We are the family of God. We We
[1:32:55] are the house of God. We are the temple
[1:32:58] of God.
[1:33:00] Brother said, "I've chose to put my name
[1:33:02] at the door of the house of my worship
[1:33:03] for my family will be gathered in there
[1:33:05] under the blood like it was in Egypt.
[1:33:07] Anything outside died in there. There's
[1:33:09] no unleaven bread. There's no leaven
[1:33:11] bread rather." He said, "There's no
[1:33:12] denominational mixture in it anywhere."
[1:33:15] Now look here. There's no denominational
[1:33:18] mixture
[1:33:20] in it anywhere. No, it's my house.
[1:33:24] That's it. That's what a prophet said.
[1:33:27] Amen. It's my
[1:33:29] children and they are born of my genes.
[1:33:32] Now look here. Glory to God. My genes
[1:33:36] are in them.
[1:33:38] That's it. Come on folks. My genes are
[1:33:42] in them.
[1:33:44] Who else stood on a platform outside of
[1:33:47] the seventh angel and said, "You are a
[1:33:49] gene of almighty God."
[1:33:52] Who else stood on a platform and said,
[1:33:54] "The same Elohim that was at Abraham and
[1:33:58] Sarah's tent door is right here in this
[1:34:01] building today." That's it. Absolutely
[1:34:05] right. What other preachers stood and
[1:34:08] said, "Elohim is materializing and
[1:34:11] making himself tangible." Look what he's
[1:34:14] saying here. They're my children. I put
[1:34:16] my word in them. My genes are in them.
[1:34:19] And I'll write them up on the tables of
[1:34:21] their heart. That's my family. Oh God,
[1:34:25] that's my family. It's the body of Jesus
[1:34:28] Christ. Now look here. I'll only meet
[1:34:31] you in the door that I have ordained.
[1:34:35] That's it. Now look here. It ain't a
[1:34:37] Methodist door. No, it ain't a Baptist
[1:34:41] door. It ain't a Pentecostal door. God's
[1:34:44] name ain't Catholic. He said, "So stay
[1:34:48] out of those doors then."
[1:34:52] That's right. Now, now, now I just I I
[1:34:54] just say this in Revelation 3:8. I love
[1:34:56] it. He says, "I know thy works, and
[1:34:59] behold, I have set before thee an open
[1:35:03] door. Amen. Okay. So, there's a divine
[1:35:07] approach to the divine God. Okay. That's
[1:35:10] it. But there's also, Brother David, an
[1:35:13] approach of God. Yes, sir. Now, oh,
[1:35:18] God. Is this okay?
[1:35:21] Amen. Amen. There's a there's a divine
[1:35:24] approach to a divine God, and that's
[1:35:26] through the channel of humility and
[1:35:30] revelation. That's right. Right. There's
[1:35:32] a channel. But look, but if you're a
[1:35:34] divine attribute, then a divine God has
[1:35:38] got to approach you under the right way,
[1:35:40] too. So, he does not approach you under
[1:35:43] some man-made denominational mixture. He
[1:35:46] approaches you, Amen, under the
[1:35:49] revelation of his name. Look here, an
[1:35:52] open door. Rebraham says, "What was it?"
[1:35:54] It was the revelation of the supreme
[1:35:57] deity of Jesus Christ. Amen. Not being a
[1:36:01] second person of a trinity, but being
[1:36:03] God himself made flesh and dwelling
[1:36:07] among us. Oh, if that revelation would
[1:36:10] ever drop in your heart, it'd make you
[1:36:12] say amen in church.
[1:36:15] If that revelation ever dropped in your
[1:36:18] heart, it'd make you back the word of
[1:36:20] God. If that revelation ever dropped in
[1:36:23] your heart, it would put joy back in
[1:36:25] your singing. It would put a It would
[1:36:27] put a heart back in your church
[1:36:28] attendance. Yeah.
[1:36:31] And then I I'm not going to back up to
[1:36:33] that devil. Revelation is not coming.
[1:36:35] Revelation is here. I'm not looking for
[1:36:38] a revelation. I'm in possession of the
[1:36:42] divine. Revelation of the power and the
[1:36:45] will of God. Look here. Revelation has
[1:36:48] come. Amen. Let me say this. Revelation
[1:36:51] of who is in our midst. Preach it now.
[1:36:55] Come on. That's it. That's good.
[1:36:58] Revelation of who? Yes sir. Is sir in
[1:37:02] our midst has come. Yes sir. Absolutely
[1:37:07] right. Absolutely right.
[1:37:10] Revelation Yes sir. of who is in our
[1:37:15] midst has come. Look what Paul said.
[1:37:19] Seeen then we have a great high priest
[1:37:23] that is passed into the heavens. Jesus
[1:37:26] the son of God. Let us hold fast hold
[1:37:29] fast our profession for we have not a
[1:37:32] high priest. Amen.
[1:37:36] Now somebody say, "Well, you know,
[1:37:37] brother Andrew, I just I just ain't into
[1:37:39] all this. I ain't into all this freedom
[1:37:40] and liberty and worship God and amen and
[1:37:42] the word of God and praising God and I
[1:37:44] ain't into all that." Well, well, you
[1:37:46] ain't got a revelation of who's in your
[1:37:47] midst.
[1:37:49] Well, brother Andrew, you see, I kind of
[1:37:51] like things a little formal and quiet
[1:37:52] and tight and intellectual approach.
[1:37:54] Well, you ain't got a revelation of
[1:37:55] who's in your midst, right?
[1:37:58] Because if you had a revelation of who
[1:38:01] was in your midst, you would do what
[1:38:03] Paul said. He can be touched. Amen. Look
[1:38:06] at this word touch. It means to be
[1:38:08] affected with the same feeling as
[1:38:10] another. Look here with the feeling of
[1:38:13] our infirmity, but was in all points
[1:38:16] tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
[1:38:20] When the revelation of the open door,
[1:38:23] the supreme deity of Jesus Christ, Amen,
[1:38:26] drops into your heart, can I say this to
[1:38:29] you? It's an open door in front of you.
[1:38:31] That's it. Amen. That's exactly right.
[1:38:34] There you are. If you want to get out of
[1:38:37] something, you got to have a door to go
[1:38:39] through. That's exactly right. Amen.
[1:38:42] Amen. I'm not gonna hold you all day. I
[1:38:43] don't want to bore you to death all day.
[1:38:45] That's all right. But can I say
[1:38:47] something to you? You've got to have a
[1:38:49] revelation. You can't just work your way
[1:38:51] out of it. Come on. You got to have a
[1:38:54] door to go through to get out of the
[1:38:56] situation. Listen, folks. We will not
[1:38:58] teach our way out. Come on. I believe in
[1:39:01] good family counseling, but there's
[1:39:03] situations you will not counsel people
[1:39:04] out of. It'll take a revelation of Jesus
[1:39:08] Christ, the power of God to open a door
[1:39:11] in front of a believer and give them a
[1:39:13] strength to walk through that door.
[1:39:15] Right. Amen. Look what he says. When
[1:39:18] that revelation drops in your heart, he
[1:39:20] said, "Let us therefore come boldly."
[1:39:22] There you are. That's it. There you are.
[1:39:25] Did I read that right, Brother David?
[1:39:27] Let us therefore come boldly unto the
[1:39:30] throne of grace. Yes, sir.
[1:39:34] Now, now, am I reading this right? Yes,
[1:39:37] sir. That we may obtain mercy. Amen. and
[1:39:41] we might find grace to help in the time
[1:39:45] of need. Let us therefore come boldly.
[1:39:49] Boldly.
[1:39:51] Well, I guarantee you that word boldly
[1:39:53] means getting up on your feet and
[1:39:54] stomping. Hallelujah. And and and
[1:39:58] kicking the pews out of your way and
[1:40:00] slinging devils out of your way.
[1:40:03] And sure, that's what it means, right?
[1:40:06] Paul says, "Let us therefore come
[1:40:07] boldly." Look at this word boldly. It's
[1:40:10] a freedom in speaking. That's right.
[1:40:12] It's
[1:40:14] unreservedness in speech. It means to
[1:40:17] speak openly without concealment,
[1:40:20] without ambiguity, without the use of
[1:40:23] figures and comparisons.
[1:40:26] Amen. Oh, mercy. It is to speak free and
[1:40:30] fearless with confidence. It is to speak
[1:40:32] of assurance. Listen what G listen at
[1:40:35] St. Matthew 13:34. And all these things
[1:40:38] spake Jesus unto the multitude in
[1:40:41] parables, and without a parable spake he
[1:40:44] not unto them. Look in verse 35. That it
[1:40:48] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:40:51] the prophet, saying, I will open up my
[1:40:54] mouth in parables. I will utter things
[1:40:57] which have been kept secret. Oh God,
[1:41:00] church, are you hearing me? I will speak
[1:41:03] things. I will utter things which have
[1:41:06] been kept secret from where? From the
[1:41:09] foundation of the world. So when the
[1:41:13] thunders thundered, when the thunders
[1:41:15] uttered their voices, it was more than
[1:41:17] just a preacher. It was God speaking and
[1:41:21] bringing revelation to symbols to give
[1:41:23] you a boldness. Amen. To give you a
[1:41:26] strong confession. Because you're not
[1:41:28] going to approach God by the way you
[1:41:30] think. You're not going to approach God
[1:41:33] by the way you dance. You're not going
[1:41:35] to approach God by the way you sing.
[1:41:38] You're going to approach God by the
[1:41:40] things you say if you're going to get an
[1:41:43] audience with him. Amen.
[1:41:46] Amen. Brother Andrew, what are you
[1:41:48] saying? I'm saying what the brother
[1:41:49] said. He said on earth he was a prophet.
[1:41:51] In heaven, he's the priest. Amen. Coming
[1:41:54] and coming back to earth, he is the king
[1:41:56] of kings. He that was that is Jesus the
[1:41:59] prophet. He that is, he's the high
[1:42:02] priest making
[1:42:05] intercession. Yes, sir. He is one who
[1:42:08] can be touched.
[1:42:13] Come on, folks. How many more times you
[1:42:15] going to sit there and not touch him and
[1:42:18] let opportunities pass you? Amen. To
[1:42:20] touch
[1:42:21] him. Now, now, now y'all ever heard
[1:42:24] Brother Brim tell that story? He said,
[1:42:26] "There's that man sitting in the prison
[1:42:27] cell and he said he's sitting there and
[1:42:30] he said he's got his back to the door
[1:42:32] and he said all of a sudden a man walks
[1:42:33] down
[1:42:34] there and he starts knocking on the
[1:42:37] door." And the man just sits there with
[1:42:38] his back turned and he said, "Hey, would
[1:42:41] you turn around? I want to talk to you."
[1:42:43] He said, "Would you look at me? I want
[1:42:44] to talk to you." And the man sit there
[1:42:46] with his back to him. He said, "Leave me
[1:42:48] alone. Come down here to torment me in
[1:42:50] this prison cell. Leave me alone. I'm
[1:42:52] fine down here." He said, "No." He kept
[1:42:54] knocking on the door, brother Paul. He
[1:42:56] said, "I just want to talk to you."
[1:42:58] Amen. I just want to talk to you. And
[1:43:00] the man kept his back to him. So all of
[1:43:02] a sudden, the man that was knocking on
[1:43:04] the door, Brother Thomas, he just turned
[1:43:06] and he walked off. And the and and the
[1:43:09] man in the prison cell, he looked to
[1:43:10] another inmate and he said, "Who was
[1:43:12] that?" Yeah.
[1:43:15] Who was that? You know what he said? He
[1:43:18] said, "Sir," he said, "you just made the
[1:43:20] most foolish mistake of your life." He
[1:43:22] said that was the governor who came down
[1:43:24] here to pardon you and you wouldn't even
[1:43:27] turn around and say I mean you wouldn't
[1:43:29] even turn around and look at him. That's
[1:43:30] it. Well, I'll just preach an amen
[1:43:33] myself if I got to. Are you hearing me?
[1:43:35] When there's a knock on the door, you've
[1:43:38] only got a small amount of time to make
[1:43:40] a reaction. Come on. Amen, brother Paul.
[1:43:43] You ever been sitting at the house?
[1:43:44] Amen. And somebody knock on the door.
[1:43:47] You know when somebody's knocking, what
[1:43:48] you say? You say this. Who is it? Yeah.
[1:43:52] Yeah. Who is it? Who is it? But you let
[1:43:56] him knock for a little bit and you never
[1:43:59] respond to the knock on the door. Amen.
[1:44:02] After a while, you'll get up and go to
[1:44:04] the door and open it and you won't be
[1:44:05] able to say, "Who is it?" You'll have to
[1:44:08] say, "Who was it?"
[1:44:10] Come on, church. You won't be able to
[1:44:12] say, "Who is in our service this
[1:44:14] morning?" Amen. Trying to open up our
[1:44:16] hearts and trying to impart his word.
[1:44:19] But if you sit there before long, he'll
[1:44:21] leave and you'll have to say, "Who was
[1:44:23] it?" All right. I say, "God, never let
[1:44:26] the day come that we have to say, who
[1:44:28] was it?" Let us respond to the
[1:44:30] revelation that is knocking at our door.
[1:44:33] Who is it?
[1:44:35] Hallelujah.
[1:44:37] He that is, he that is, that is he. I
[1:44:43] love that. He that is, that is he the
[1:44:47] high priest.
[1:44:50] making
[1:44:52] intercession and he is
[1:44:55] one who can be touched. Yes sir. That is
[1:44:59] exactly right with the
[1:45:02] feeling of our
[1:45:04] infirmities.
[1:45:06] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:45:10] today and forever. Brother said he is
[1:45:13] the same in every way except the
[1:45:16] corporal body. Rather, he's the same
[1:45:20] Christ. Look in Acts 199, Acts 3:19.
[1:45:23] Repent you therefore, and be converted
[1:45:26] that your sins may be blotted out. For
[1:45:29] when the times of refreshing,
[1:45:32] my shall come from the presence of the
[1:45:36] Lord. Now, now look in verse 20, folks.
[1:45:38] This is a promise. And he shall send.
[1:45:43] There he is. He shall send Jesus Christ
[1:45:48] which before was preached unto you. Can
[1:45:52] I say this? Jesus Christ is the high
[1:45:55] priest and the message of the hour is
[1:45:59] the announcing. The high priest has
[1:46:03] returned to the church. Amen. It's the
[1:46:08] revelation of true predestination.
[1:46:11] It's the revelation of election coming
[1:46:14] into your heart. Listen, the message of
[1:46:17] the hour, Amen, is the announcing. Yes.
[1:46:21] You can now rightly approach him. Amen.
[1:46:25] Amen. Right. Amen.
[1:46:30] You now know what to say. Oh my. That's
[1:46:34] it.
[1:46:35] To get an audience with him.
[1:46:40] Thank you, Lord. Look at look here,
[1:46:43] brother B stands there. He says, he
[1:46:45] says, "Now remember that that now I'll
[1:46:47] just prove it to you in Matthew chapter
[1:46:49] nine. The Bible says this, behold, a
[1:46:51] woman with disease with an issue of
[1:46:53] blood for 12 years came behind him and
[1:46:55] touched him of his garment." Now, now,
[1:46:57] now
[1:46:59] folks, she came boldly.
[1:47:03] She came boldly.
[1:47:06] You know how she came boldly? For she
[1:47:09] said within herself,
[1:47:12] "If I may but touch his garment,
[1:47:18] I shall be whole." And Jesus turned him
[1:47:22] about and went and he saw her and he
[1:47:24] said, "Daughter, be of good comfort. Thy
[1:47:27] faith may be whole." Amen. Brother said,
[1:47:30] "There's a color lady sitting there with
[1:47:32] a red hat on, praying for a stomach
[1:47:33] condition. You can receive your healing.
[1:47:36] See that did it. I don't know the lady.
[1:47:38] I've never seen her. You say, "How'd
[1:47:40] that happen, brother Brandham? I don't
[1:47:41] know." That woman was sitting there
[1:47:43] praying. Ask her and something she
[1:47:45] touched. And when it did, I seen the
[1:47:47] light go over and break. And there was a
[1:47:48] vision and the woman with a stomach
[1:47:50] trouble backing away. He said, "Now rich
[1:47:52] foods make her sick and nausea and acids
[1:47:55] on her teeth and things. It's a peptic
[1:47:57] ulcer."
[1:48:00] Can I say
[1:48:01] this? But she's going to be well now.
[1:48:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:08] Now he's been made approachable. That's
[1:48:11] right. Now the hour of worship has come.
[1:48:16] Amen. He said, "Well, look at her. She's
[1:48:18] 20 to 15 20. She's 15 yards from me. We
[1:48:22] don't know each other." What happened?
[1:48:25] She touched something that's present
[1:48:29] to fulfill the Bible that the high
[1:48:31] priest can be touched by the feeling of
[1:48:35] our infirmities. Amen. Now, the same
[1:48:40] Jesus, not me. She touched him. I'm a
[1:48:44] man. I don't know her. Now, now folks,
[1:48:48] this is this is beyond religion. Brother
[1:48:51] Brandham, he said, "Now look here. You
[1:48:53] say, "Who did they touch?" He said, "Not
[1:48:56] brother Brandham, the same yesterday,
[1:48:58] today, and forever."
[1:49:01] But Jesus Christ, the same yesterday,
[1:49:04] today, and forever. Y'all, y'all
[1:49:07] remember in those prayer lines, Brother
[1:49:09] would stand there and he'd be preaching
[1:49:10] and he'd say, "Now, now, who did they
[1:49:13] touch?" That's exactly who did he touch?
[1:49:15] Who did she touch? He said, "See, I want
[1:49:17] to ask somebody. Question the woman.
[1:49:19] Report her, whoever you wish. See if
[1:49:21] I've ever seen her. What did she touch?
[1:49:25] She never touched me. She's 20 ft away
[1:49:28] from me or 30. What did she touch? Are
[1:49:31] you ready for this? The high priest.
[1:49:35] Christ. This one who has his picture
[1:49:39] here. Amen. We're not approaching the
[1:49:42] high priest that is a million miles
[1:49:44] away. We're approaching the living
[1:49:47] omnipotent. Christ is present now to
[1:49:51] heal every person in here. Can I say
[1:49:54] this to you? He's the God of heaven.
[1:49:56] Brother Bram says, "And he's present
[1:50:00] now." Amen. Another one. How could you
[1:50:02] doubt when Jesus Christ, the son of the
[1:50:05] living God is present here now, his
[1:50:08] great Holy Spirit in this building?
[1:50:12] Hallelujah. He said, "See what it is?
[1:50:14] It's a divine approach." Let me say that
[1:50:18] same God that was in the days gone by
[1:50:20] that we speak so much of, he is present
[1:50:24] here now. Not by some theological
[1:50:28] understanding, but by a personal
[1:50:30] knowledge of his vindication that he
[1:50:32] would pour out in the last days, the
[1:50:34] Holy Spirit upon his church. He is not
[1:50:38] an I was. He is still the I am. Remember
[1:50:43] folks, your approach determines your
[1:50:47] results. He said those who thought he
[1:50:50] was beyond smacked him in the mouth and
[1:50:52] felt no virtue. But the woman who
[1:50:54] touched him, the hem of his garment run
[1:50:57] out and she got healed. He said, "If you
[1:50:59] think it's the devil, then you get a
[1:51:01] devil's reward. If you think it's God,
[1:51:03] then you get God's reward." He said,
[1:51:05] "You get the son of God's reward." Amen.
[1:51:11] Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:13] Hey, judge. I'd like to talk to you
[1:51:15] sometime. You'll never get an audience
[1:51:18] with him.
[1:51:21] Hey, young lady. Like to talk to you
[1:51:22] sometime. How you doing? You'll never
[1:51:25] get an audience with her. Right. Hey,
[1:51:28] king. What's happening, pal? How's
[1:51:30] things going in your kingdom? You'll
[1:51:33] never get an audience with the king.
[1:51:36] That's right. Amen.
[1:51:38] I'm Methodist. I'm Baptist. Yeah. You'll
[1:51:41] never get an audience with a God right
[1:51:44] of this Bible
[1:51:46] but when you approach him Amen with the
[1:51:50] right speech
[1:51:52] with the right words you say what are
[1:51:54] you getting at I'm I'm going to close on
[1:51:56] this Mark 7 the Bible talks about that
[1:51:58] Saraphene woman whose daughter was
[1:52:00] grievously she vexed with the devil
[1:52:02] remember that and remember she come up
[1:52:04] there and she and she besought him that
[1:52:06] he would cast forth the devil out of her
[1:52:08] daughter but Jesus said unto hurt
[1:52:10] brother Paul. He said, "Let the children
[1:52:12] first be
[1:52:14] filled." Well, what was she? He said,
[1:52:18] "For it's not meat to take the
[1:52:21] children's bread and cast it unto the
[1:52:23] dogs." And she answered and said unto
[1:52:25] him, "Yes, Lord."
[1:52:29] Her approach.
[1:52:32] Yes, Lord. Yet the dogs under the table,
[1:52:36] that's it. Eat of the children's crumbs.
[1:52:40] Can can Can I show you how powerful this
[1:52:42] is? And he said unto her, for this
[1:52:46] saint, it
[1:52:49] go thy way.
[1:52:52] The devil is gone out of thy daughter.
[1:52:55] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. She never even
[1:52:59] got home and told her daughter what
[1:53:01] happened.
[1:53:04] Jesus never went by the daughter's
[1:53:07] house. Yeah. But when she got home,
[1:53:13] her daughter was delivered. Look at that
[1:53:16] word saying it's of a speech. It's of a
[1:53:19] word and it's uttered by a living voice.
[1:53:22] That's it. And it embodies a conception.
[1:53:25] Amen. Or idea. Rebraham said, "See what
[1:53:28] happened?" He said, "Jesus himself tried
[1:53:31] to discourage her." He said, "Oh, but
[1:53:33] Christ himself stand there trying to
[1:53:34] discourage her." But she held on. He
[1:53:37] said, "If you approach the Holy Ghost,
[1:53:39] the gift of God, in the right way,
[1:53:41] you'll not only get crumbs, you'll get a
[1:53:44] plate full." Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:49] If you'll just approach it in the right
[1:53:53] way.
[1:53:54] For this saying, thy daughter is healed.
[1:53:59] Amen. I love it. Reb said, "Listen." He
[1:54:01] said, said, "That's the truth, Lord, but
[1:54:03] the dogs eat the scraps from under the
[1:54:04] master's table." He said, "For this
[1:54:06] saying, because look, because you said
[1:54:09] it." He said, "That high blood pressure
[1:54:12] you've gotten, heart trouble, if you'll
[1:54:14] believe it with all your heart, it'll
[1:54:16] leave you. Will you accept it?" See,
[1:54:19] that was your trouble, wasn't it? It's
[1:54:21] true. Just believe it. Now, now, now,
[1:54:24] folks, I can go from the woman with the
[1:54:26] issue of blood. I can come down to the
[1:54:29] sire Phoenician woman. I can come down
[1:54:31] to Martha when she ran out to meet
[1:54:33] Jesus. And the Bible said she didn't
[1:54:36] upgrade him. She didn't go out there and
[1:54:37] let him have it and give her a piece of
[1:54:39] his mind and or a piece of her mind and
[1:54:40] tell him everything he done wrong. But
[1:54:42] she went out there because she was
[1:54:44] looking for a divine result. Amen. She
[1:54:47] knew that this was the divine God
[1:54:50] manifested in flesh because she had read
[1:54:52] where Elisha and the Shounomite woman
[1:54:55] were God was in his servant Elijah. And
[1:54:57] she knew that if God was in Elijah,
[1:55:00] he had to be in his son Jesus.
[1:55:03] So when she approached him, she didn't
[1:55:05] approach him by saying, "Lord, if you'd
[1:55:06] have been here, I'll tell you right now,
[1:55:07] Lazarus wouldn't be dead and things
[1:55:09] wouldn't have been this way." No. When
[1:55:10] she approached him, she she reverenced
[1:55:13] him. Amen. And she said, "Lord, even
[1:55:16] now." That's right.
[1:55:19] Amen. Her approach
[1:55:22] created a divine
[1:55:25] result. Yes, sir. Look at Hattie, right?
[1:55:28] She didn't ask for nothing. She was just
[1:55:31] sitting there. Now, now notice this,
[1:55:33] brother David. It don't say she did the
[1:55:35] right thing.
[1:55:38] She said the right thing which pleased
[1:55:42] the Holy Spirit.
[1:55:45] Sister Jerry, when she heard Brother
[1:55:47] Bram telling about those
[1:55:48] squirrels and she said, "That ain't
[1:55:50] nothing but the truth." That saying has
[1:55:54] went around the world. Come on, folks.
[1:55:57] That saying is is impacting churches and
[1:56:01] people and mothers all over this world.
[1:56:05] Right. I've been in Africa. I've been in
[1:56:08] India. I've been in Europe. I've been in
[1:56:10] Canada, Australia. I've been the Lord's
[1:56:12] given me the grace to go around the
[1:56:13] world preaching this gospel all across
[1:56:15] America. And I've never I've never
[1:56:17] preached a testimony of Hatty Wright one
[1:56:20] time. But what the power of God didn't
[1:56:22] drop in the building and take over a
[1:56:25] mother's heart because she said the
[1:56:28] right thing
[1:56:31] for this saying had amen.
[1:56:35] When she said that ain't nothing but the
[1:56:37] truth. That was the
[1:56:40] conception. That saying was her
[1:56:43] conception of God. Oh God. Amen. I I
[1:56:47] wish I had the ability to bring it to
[1:56:49] you the way the Lord's been putting it
[1:56:50] on my heart. That that saying was the
[1:56:54] embodiment of the conception of what she
[1:56:58] thought. That's right. About what she
[1:56:59] was hearing right and the Holy Spirit
[1:57:03] spoke back and said, "Hatty, ask
[1:57:04] anything you will." And I'll give it to
[1:57:07] you right now. Amen. Folks, let me say
[1:57:11] this to you. Brother Brand preached it
[1:57:13] for many years. Behold, a greater than
[1:57:15] Solomon is here. The Queen of Sheba, a
[1:57:18] greater than Solomon is here. Behold, a
[1:57:20] greater than Solomon is here. But he
[1:57:22] come to the end of his ministry and
[1:57:23] said, "Behold, a greater than Solomon is
[1:57:26] here now."
[1:57:30] And showed you that this word is putting
[1:57:34] you back. Amen. In the presence of the
[1:57:37] divine judge himself. And there's a
[1:57:40] people on the earth now
[1:57:43] who have obtained mercy. Amen. Through
[1:57:46] the blood, Amen. The grace of God is
[1:57:50] upon your hearts. And if anybody's got a
[1:57:54] right to come boldly to the throne this
[1:57:57] morning is the divinely
[1:58:00] predestinated attribute of the divine
[1:58:03] God.
[1:58:06] And you'll find help. Amen. You'll find
[1:58:09] help. Amen. In the time of need, and
[1:58:12] you'll obtain mercy. Yes, sir. And
[1:58:14] grace. Amen. Do you love him this
[1:58:16] morning? Yes, sir. Let our musicians
[1:58:18] come. Amen.
[1:58:20] Reverend said, "Depends on how you
[1:58:21] approach it. Depends on what you're
[1:58:24] looking for. When you go to church, it
[1:58:27] depends on what that's you're looking
[1:58:30] for,
[1:58:32] folks. The revelation is not coming.
[1:58:36] The revelation has come. That's right.
[1:58:39] That's right. That's exactly right. The
[1:58:41] revelation is not coming. That's right.
[1:58:43] The revelation has come. Amen. Reb said,
[1:58:47] "See," he said, "look, Jesus said, "Say
[1:58:50] to this mountain and you heard what had
[1:58:51] taken place." Amen. Look here. Jesus
[1:58:53] said, "Say to this mountain and you've
[1:58:55] heard what's taking place." He said,
[1:58:57] "Now listen." He
[1:59:00] said, "That's the ministry that we're
[1:59:02] entering into." He said, "We're way up
[1:59:05] the road now. Soon the coming of the
[1:59:07] Lord Jesus, and we've got to have
[1:59:09] rapturing faith in a church that can be
[1:59:12] changed in a moment, in a twinkling of
[1:59:14] an eye to go out or will not
[1:59:17] go. But don't worry, it'll be there."
[1:59:22] Ain't that powerful? Don't worry, it'll
[1:59:25] be there. And when the power of this
[1:59:28] church rises, it'll bring its brethren.
[1:59:31] The power of that church rises will
[1:59:33] bring its brethren. The power of that
[1:59:35] church will bring the other brethren.
[1:59:37] There will be a general resurrection.
[1:59:43] Now folks,
[1:59:45] faith is a revelation. Amen. I got to
[1:59:49] looking at that the other day, brother
[1:59:50] Paul in Mark 7. And Jesus looked at her
[1:59:53] and he said, "For this saying, thy
[1:59:56] daughter is made whole."
[1:59:59] I looked that up in the Amplified Bible
[2:00:01] and I love the the translation there
[2:00:04] when it said for this sane. It said her
[2:00:07] saying reflected her humility. That's
[2:00:10] it. And her faith. Amen.
[2:00:13] Look, humility brings power. Amen. Can I
[2:00:18] Can I just say this to
[2:00:20] you? These the message of the hour, it's
[2:00:24] not just quotes, folks. No, sir.
[2:00:27] Can I? No sir. C can can I take you a
[2:00:30] step further? Yes, sir. There's things
[2:00:32] we say in the message that you can say
[2:00:35] to message believers and they're and
[2:00:37] they're and they're commonly repeated
[2:00:39] sayings.
[2:00:41] They're commonly repeated
[2:00:43] phrases and you you ever say them and
[2:00:46] just watch faith rise in the
[2:00:50] building. Brother Paul, you've been
[2:00:51] around the world preaching. You ever
[2:00:53] just say certain things, Brother Bam
[2:00:54] said, and then just watch the watch the
[2:00:57] faith of God's people just just go so
[2:00:59] high. Amen.
[2:01:02] You know what's doing
[2:01:03] that? It's because the Bible said,
[2:01:06] "Unseal the saints of God." Amen.
[2:01:11] Don't seal the saints of God. Unseal
[2:01:13] them. That's right. Because now is the
[2:01:17] time to say them. Amen. That's it. If
[2:01:21] there's ever been a time to say you're
[2:01:23] the sinless, spotless bride of Jesus
[2:01:27] Christ, now's the time to say it.
[2:01:32] If there's ever been a time to say some
[2:01:33] morning between 6 and 9, there's going
[2:01:36] to come a cold sweep over the church and
[2:01:38] we're going to be changed. Now is the
[2:01:41] time to say it.
[2:01:44] If there's ever been a time to say, "You
[2:01:46] are the invincible army." That's right.
[2:01:48] Now is the time to say it. If there's
[2:01:52] ever been a time to
[2:01:54] say you can live so close to God that
[2:01:58] the devil don't know what to do with
[2:01:59] you. That's right.
[2:02:01] Now is the time to say it
[2:02:05] for this
[2:02:06] sane. Listen folks, I don't know about
[2:02:08] you, but I've been been meditating on
[2:02:10] this for a few days and I just say,
[2:02:12] "Lord, change my speech." Amen. Give me
[2:02:16] the right speech.
[2:02:18] to approach you in the right way that I
[2:02:21] might receive a divine result.
[2:02:25] Do you love him this morning? Won't you
[2:02:28] stand to your feet with us?
[2:02:30] Amen.
[2:02:33] Faith is a revelation.
[2:02:37] Brother said it very beautiful. He said
[2:02:40] made known only by revelation of words
[2:02:43] through the prophets.
[2:02:45] He said, "But now has become
[2:02:48] Emmanuel, God with us." I love what he
[2:02:51] says. He said, he says,
[2:02:53] "Now, if you open your
[2:02:56] mouth," Brother Paul, God promised he
[2:02:59] would feel it. Amen. You know what else
[2:03:02] he said? He said, "When a son of God
[2:03:05] takes the word of God and places it upon
[2:03:08] his
[2:03:09] lips, it's the same as deity speaking.
[2:03:15] If I could but touch the hem of his
[2:03:17] garment, I know I'll be made whole.
[2:03:20] Amen.
[2:03:22] Lord, even the dogs eat the crumbs that
[2:03:26] fall from the master's
[2:03:29] table. Lord, if you would have been
[2:03:30] here, our brother would not have died.
[2:03:32] But even now, yes,
[2:03:35] see those had it right. That ain't
[2:03:39] nothing but the truth. Those
[2:03:43] saints was their approach to God. Amen.
[2:03:46] They approached him. They approached him
[2:03:49] by
[2:03:50] th I'm sorry. I'm trying to get it out
[2:03:52] the best way I know how. Those
[2:03:55] saints declared
[2:03:58] what they believed about him.
[2:04:00] [Music]
[2:04:01] Can I ask you something this morning?
[2:04:03] What are you
[2:04:05] saying right there? Can I tell you
[2:04:07] something? What you say about your
[2:04:09] church declares what you think about it.
[2:04:14] What you say about the services you come
[2:04:16] to declares what you think about them.
[2:04:19] Right. That's right. Come on, folks.
[2:04:22] What you say about the pastor and the
[2:04:24] man of God declares what you think about
[2:04:25] him. That's right.
[2:04:29] That's it. Our
[2:04:31] saints determine the results. Yeah.
[2:04:35] I say, God, this
[2:04:37] morning, change my speech, Lord.
[2:04:41] Change my speech, Lord.
[2:04:44] Lord, I want to say the right
[2:04:47] thing. I want the works of righteousness
[2:04:49] to follow my
[2:04:51] life. I want to be a
[2:04:54] believer. You love him this morning.
[2:04:56] Let's bow our hearts. Almighty
[2:04:58] God, we bow our hearts in your presence
[2:05:00] this
[2:05:01] morning. Father, knowing that your word
[2:05:04] is
[2:05:05] true, knowing that your spirit is
[2:05:08] real. And Lord, knowing that we're not
[2:05:11] just approaching a Sunday morning
[2:05:12] service or we're not just approaching a
[2:05:15] a Wednesday night service,
[2:05:17] Lord. Father, I as a preacher, Brother
[2:05:20] Paul, Brother David, Brother Thomas, and
[2:05:22] these are the men of God in the
[2:05:23] building, Lord. Father, when we approach
[2:05:25] the pullpit, we're not just approaching
[2:05:28] another time to
[2:05:29] preach, but Lord, change our speech,
[2:05:33] Lord.
[2:05:35] [Music]
[2:05:36] Lord, Lord, bring our speech underneath
[2:05:38] the control of revelation.
[2:05:42] Lord, that we would
[2:05:43] [Music]
[2:05:44] say, Lord, we would say that which would
[2:05:47] be pleasing unto
[2:05:48] you.
[2:05:50] Lord, you've sent a prophet in this day.
[2:05:54] and he's taught
[2:05:56] us. He's instructed us. He's showed us
[2:05:58] and revealed to us the saints of God.
[2:06:02] Now,
[2:06:03] Father, may your spirit this
[2:06:06] morning overshadow this congregation,
[2:06:09] Lord. Father, I think of Mary. She said
[2:06:12] the right thing,
[2:06:14] Lord. She said, "Be it unto
[2:06:17] me according to thy word." Lord, we
[2:06:21] could we could spend hours combing
[2:06:22] through the Bible and the message,
[2:06:24] pulling and collecting those sayings of
[2:06:26] God.
[2:06:28] Lord, this is the time to say them.
[2:06:32] You've unsealed it.
[2:06:34] Lord, you've unsealed it so somebody
[2:06:36] could say it.
[2:06:38] And we are the chosen generation. Thank
[2:06:41] you, Lord. Hallelujah. Yes. Thank you,
[2:06:44] Lord. We are that royal people, that
[2:06:46] royal nation, that Lord, that people
[2:06:49] that was not a people but is now a
[2:06:52] people having obtained mercy, Lord. And
[2:06:55] your prophet said, "What is mercy?" It's
[2:06:57] the word of the age. Hallelujah. The
[2:07:00] mercy of the age is the word of the age.
[2:07:06] Father, you unsealed it, Lord, so a
[2:07:10] people could say it.
[2:07:12] Now, Father, may these things settle in
[2:07:14] the hearts of your children. Lord, if
[2:07:17] the burdens and the pressures and the
[2:07:19] heaviness of life is so weighed them
[2:07:22] down that they don't know how to
[2:07:23] approach you properly anymore, Father,
[2:07:26] may you bring a change in their heart.
[2:07:28] Oh
[2:07:30] God, may you bring a change in their
[2:07:32] approach, Lord.
[2:07:34] Father, for every believer here this
[2:07:37] morning, Lord, may you teach us your
[2:07:41] approach by your word. In Jesus name we
[2:07:47] pray.
[2:07:49] Amen.

[2:07:53] morning. Amen. I I pray something has

[2:13:44] "Usually when you're unhappy with
[2:13:48] others, you were unhappy with yourself
[2:13:52] first."
[2:13:53] And I thought,
[2:13:56] Lord, I want to have a different
[2:14:01] confession. Amen.
