get turned in but I guess regardless of those that were not turned in there has been overwhelming support of uh for the votes of confidence uh so we counted all the results and there's overwhelming support for every position on that ballot as as well as brother Sergey uh as a new trustee there was overwhelming support for that and even if some of the ballots were not turned in there wouldn't be enough votes to offset that in any way shape or form um also I'd like to ask you Saints to continue to pray for each position in the church that the Lord would just give us um Supernatural wisdom Amen

touch but it's the same touch amen hallelujah it's good sister Carri good to see you I was going to make a joke about a visitor uh but um it's good to see you back amen and uh our visitors there God bless you amen uh to each and every one uh it's just uh you know lovely lovely to be a Christian it just so lovely to be a Christian how blessed we are you know uh we've been in the harvest season we have a lot of seasonal help that we hire and um you know you just realize sometimes you know Lord I live a sheltered life all of a sudden you have't I'm not picking on the truck drivers we have several in the church but you know all of a sudden you have all these hired people and they have a language of their own and you just realize Lord thank you that we are not of this Earth We're Not of this world this is not our language it's not our thoughts and and what a blessing amen I also want to remember our sister April I don't know why I'm a little out of touch I thought maybe we'd see her today but God bless you Sister April when you listen in and um I just want to bring you greetings from Brother Stan and sister Merlene uh and um we were just giving greetings to each other this morning and he just desired uh they desired to be uh uh their greeting to to the church today and so um I'm going to you know I wasn't sure what was going to do but I think we just take a moment we don't even need to be seated I just want to invite all those officers with their vote of confidence U uh brother Ivan Isaac um Adam brother Sergey now being part of the trusty board uh and um each one of you just come and we're going to just ask for a blessing because uh these are those you know I think I was looking through pictures and uh you know Saints I always forget I looked at the date and I forgot it already but what's it been seven years we've been here yeah roughly seven years we've been here do you remember brother Trevor that day when we walked in here with the realtor we were shocked back in time we were shocked back into the 70s or 60s or something and and uh while we haven't ultr modernized the church you know it's just been this continual effort continual Labor uh that the brothers ha have done and uh you know I had I won't mention who it was was a visitor they said well brother Paul you guys only have one Deacon I I and I I throw this out not a guilt trip but anybody that qualifies you know we would love you to step forward if you would want to be and uh the brother says you only have one Deacon but he's as big as any other three deacons I've ever met and so you know it's there that we do that so Brothers if you'd come uh and um we just want to have a little blessing uh over you that God give you all wisdom uh in in uh the decisions and The Business of the church uh you know uh just thankful uh we're not a complicated Church we don't have a lot of drama in our church aren't you glad unless you're a student of drama and then you might say there's not enough but we don't have drama and for me that is just a real blessing that we as Christians just reading studying and and what it is is God's put a heart's desire in us to just simply want to do his will and live the word and that is really what defines a Christian just want to love him serve him him amen be obedient to the word Brothers come you can face the audience here uh they they have cast their votes of confidence for you and I want to say that I have my vote of confidence amen besides that little check on the piece of paper uh have voted confidence in these men their heart's desires and uh we just ask that God would just bless them give them wisdom Heavenly Father Lord as I stand here my brother Adam my brother Sergey brother Isaac brother Ivan father that Lord they have come and they give freely of themselves father to the service of the body of Believers Lord they are here father Lord not for any gain it's more like what they give up father it's not about an office with Prestige or position for father there is very little praise but father I ask for your blessings father upon these men Lord as they serve you father as they serve this body of Believers just give them Supernatural wisdom give them unction father Lord just to make the house of God presentable to take this building father that was wore out when you got it for us father we recognize that it was because of its condition that it made it affordable for us and father through this continual effort lord it's being restored into a house of God father we thank you for the gifts that you have placed in this body for the believer who are faithful to be in the house of God and we ask you father now just to bless them bless their families bless this assembly in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you Brothers [Music] hallelujah amen let's just turn in our Bibles this morning I want to speak to you uh for a little while today it might seem that I'm speaking on current events but it's actually the end of the service is where my real focus is but there is sometimes a parallel or a context we need to measure now you know one time I was working with a young man doing construction work and he was just uh as they called them he was a newbie or a uh Beaver is what they call them sometimes because to get the boards right they cut up a lot of wood and uh so it was there that that um you know you you just sometimes people ask questions and you're a little dumbfounded you don't have an answer and this young man's question was who invented the tape measure and then I said well no doubt some he goes no no what I meant was where' an inch become an inch from and you stop and it's like well where did it come from you know a little hard to to do that but we in contrast have to as humans have something to measure against now when the word talks about holy Hess well what are we measuring that against righteousness what are we measuring that against or worldliness what are we measuring that against and so it is here that in the word of God God has given us clear instruction as it were the measurement for you and I to come and be able to say this is where I stand now in the mirror of God's word every one of us is given a position to stand in the mirror of the word and while you would say there's no image in that mirror unless I'm standing there but you know there's those people who are very contrary in their thinking and they will tell you that your image was already in the mirror and it's now looking out at you and that kind of logic is hard to argue against because you can't argue against people with that kind of logic and so it's there but my brother and sister the image of The Godly the image image of the Christian of the believer is already in the word the image of who you are in Jesus Christ is already in the word man did not put it in there amen God put that in there and so today I want to talk to you on the overall title of uniting time and uh as a subject it would be manifesting time and let's just turn for a quick look in our Bibles in Genesis the 16th chapter and uh verses 7- 12 and you'll say well brother Paul you are you're just looking into current events but you see my brother and sister these current events have been very current for a long time it's not just something that appeared a few days ago while it burst into the open as it were to the world uh view uh but my brother and sister it's an ongoing struggle that goes all the way back to the book of gen Genesis the 16th chapter verses 7-2 and this is a story of hegar and we find out my brother and sister well I'll expound on that in just a moment and the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to Shure and he said Hagar sar's maid when comest thou and with wilt thou go and she said I flee from the face of my mistress Seri and the angel of the Lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands we have all been in a situation where we felt like we were unjustly treated and we desire to to get away to escape from that but God says to her I want you to go back to the very countenance now we can't justify saria's Behavior after all where she could not conceive a child it was her you might say presented idea just take my maid now obviously she become quite jealous we won't get into the whole dynamic of it but when this maid goes to her husband and is found with child it would be upsetting let's face that and she didn't really act like a proper Christian because the human element is always present with us and God says go back and submit yourself and the angel of the Lord said unto her I will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel of the Lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shall bear a son and shall call his name Ishmael because the Lord hath heard thy Affliction and he will be a wild man and that's something people who never had children are like I wish they would correct their children and then they have children and their children are just as bad imagine though Angel of the lord your child's going to be wild man that must have been so encouraging his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his Brethren Heavenly Father we just ask you to bless this time lord as we look father lord it's not about wars between uh these people father and what is happening father but it is of the fulfilling of your word and father I ask ask today Lord you would come touch each and every one of us let your word be fulfilled in our lives father that we can stand with confidence and look to the day of your coming Lord and not be afraid but with that confidence be able to stand in the day that we live in in the test of time and be able to rejoice as Sons and Daughters of God bless this service today I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now I think it's safe to say that we can look through the track record of the word of God and find that every time that man tries to bring something to pass I don't know if you would agree with me or not but I know that every time I've tried to make things happen tried to facilitate things to be in a certain fashion they very rarely turn out like we as humans anticipate it and so here it is that in Siri's idea that um this maid is is going to bring forth a child and I'm going to take this child and I'm going to rear it as my own but you see there was no uh word in the promise concerning this uh promised Seed of Abraham that said that that child would come now my brother and sister it's a little uh Stark to put it this way but um uh you know Hagar being an Egyptian actually what happened was uh with Abraham uh coming and taking her and bringing forth a child he has now produced as you might say a hybrid it's not it's not of his bloodline not of his lineage not of his faith and so he's produced something that was outside of the spoken word of God and so it's there that whenever uh man's uh efforts to bring things to pass uh come God takes our misguided efforts and uh it's there that I can say just thinking without going into it today many times that I have have put the effort out to try to bring about a certain uh result and only toine that uh to be a misguided effort but yet God's will will be done amen amen in spite of our left turns right turns our stumbling whatever it is God's will will be done whatever he has promised to Sons and Daughters of God will come to pass whatever is promised to those who blaspheme his name will come to pass amen and so it is my brother and sister that we have to be careful that uh as Christians that someone doesn't try to uh marry us to some kind of a system to bring things to pass that that hey you want your church to grow I've often joked about that uh correspondence that we received you know for just these monthly payments we will give you this secret on how to make your your church grow well we as a body of Believers want this church to grow organically we want it to grow because the word of God has led someone to be a part of Assembly not because we have now created a program it's not because we're attracting them because we have presented Something Beautiful the beauty in worship goes back to Cain amen the real beauty of worship is when we living the word of God and our life reflecting that and God is pleased and there's where he pours out his Blessing not our effort amen so even in our misguided efforts God's will will be done and so it's promise that we have today that if we stay true to the word of God and stand upon on the promise of God God said I will bring it to pass and I say Amen to that amen so we see that God's words to Hagar uh show us that this was uh uh all fitting in the plan of God when when you look at what the angel of the Lord speaks to her he is not telling her because of this act that you participated in uh because of this being outside of my original promise that you know there's a curse upon you but he actually makes the Declaration to Hagar that uh this is going to fit perfectly in my plan that I'm going to make your son a great nation now my brother and sister without going into all the time and the history I debated on it but it's there we'll look at this and realize that he was blessed with many sons and daughters had princes they had their kingdoms they had great things he wasn't some popper cast to the backside of the desert because God's promise to Hagar the word spoken must come to pass amen now as we look at this we realize just touching back on the scripture we'll see my brother and sister that this promise that was spoken in that day is that he is going to be a wild man he is going to be H very indecisive and uh very unreliable going to be prone to fits and you know I I just the other day as I was studying sitting there in the Harvester and just thinking about this and it just come out and it's like ishmail your sons are misbehaving again but you see it was prophesied that they would and so this must be brought about and you know my brother and sister that sometimes God uses things that confound you and I to cause us to shift our position so we don't like what happened this happens and why did this happen what God is using is a very in many cases subtle Direction in our life to get us to just change just a little bit and that little bit of change will chart a course into your future and so it is is that God was doing this my brother and sister to bring about a time a season is to bring about without going off into a lot of other uh uh things we look at this and realize that Israel's own behavior set a stage for these things Israel's own Behavior Uh would cause that an on again off again relationship with God and unable to take the promise and simply stand on the promise until they saw it come to pass now if we sit here and you know I've heard people make comments like well I've been praying about this for so long it's celebrating birthdays well you know birthdays mean nothing to God we can say it's been years been praying for healing or praying for a lost loved one uh it's it's been years my brother and sister time means nothing to God and in reality if we are fully submitted to God time would mean nothing for us because he has given us the promise of the word amen and when he gives the promise it can take e on of time but it will come to pass and if you say I I don't know about that well then what can you trust that's right you know if we come to the place that the devil robs us from the very Simplicity of trust then we have no firm foundation to stand on Amen so as it is my brother and sister we'll look at this and he he's showing Hagar you know what I'm going to bless him and he's going to be a father of great nation and this is all going to come and and you see this as you look at this you recognize that that God is giving in essence a stamp that this fits into the plan now look my brother and sister um this uh Ishmael and the ishmaelites there is a time that they are in direct conflict it's not just about fighting over Palestine it's not fighting over the it goes all the way back my brother and sister you can find if you want to study it reference in scripture about how that uh uh uh Israel amen Judah killing the Israelites that's right amen so this has been an ongoing thing it wasn't just a little HOA disruption in the neighborhood uh it it has been taking place forever and so it is they are no friends to Isaac seed and Isaac seed has maybe looked with a little disdain upon them now when we went to Israel this last uh late fall about a year ago really it's getting close a amen my brother and sister you can you can sense a little bit of disdain many many Jews friendly we met very very many friendly but but we're sitting in a restaurant there on on the Dead Sea a and uh there was a family come in and I don't want to sound judgmental but I want to make a point there's family come in and sat right down by our table and uh and and it's there that they're doing and I can just remember the look as the man is seating his family and he just looked over and I think I know what a look of disdain is he just looked at me like H and I was like well praise God you know you you look at me like I I'm nothing but I'm going to look at you as being in the scripture and therefore I cannot look against you but I don't necessarily have to stand for you because not all that's Israel is Israel and so just because you're a Jew and you are standing with your little book and you're reading to your family and and you're doing all of this ceremonial thing my brother and sister you realize it is tradition that's right it is not from their heart they're going through the motion I don't want to go through the motion I want to serve God from my heart I want to just be totally sold out to him that people would would say there's a passion in that person there's a passion in that church there's a passion in them not not simply yeah they go through it because by roach my brother and sister we can repeat anything so look at this both of these had a promise to be great Nations so now you got two Nations rising up go study it it's good homework it's interesting reading go study it you see no wonder ishmail really felt like he had something that Isaac didn't because you see ishmail is growing up now as a Young Man already in the favor of his father before Isaac ever shows up great conflict the Palestinians saying we've been on this land forever but who did God declare the land belong to so it doesn't matter when they show up my brother and sister it's what God promised it to be and ishmail saying we were here first and he had a he had a strong argument there I was here first I was even raised up and had been circumcised before Isaac even come you might say in significance upon the scene and so there I was already committed already uh uh uh dedicated and it's all there to fulfilling the word of God but my brother and sister that promise had been given to Abraham a long time before it was man who brought that about and so both claiming to have the word amen that's right you know I did a little reading not that I'm overall interested in the whole thing but I did a little reading and my brother and sister you know they they both claim to have the word this is the word that come and God spoke these words over our father ishmail and it's there that that this is our promise and yet my brother and sister having those claim to the word does not mean you have the word that's right amen a lot of people claim that today amen but both have their own profits and their own message and their own vindications you know it's interesting as you study Islam my brother and sister they are not a religion without results right now you might be thinking I'm promoting that I'm not but the scripture says it'd be so close to deceive the very elect and many people believe everything else is nothing we've got it brother Chris preached Wednesday night you see it's much closer than that it's not even the four walls of this church not four walls of our faith it's right down at the soul level that's right it's right down at the very committing my brother and sister Judas was empowered to cast out demons Amen to give blessings upon the people but come to the place that God asked for one more sacrifice Judas and Judas says I've give all I'm going to give I'm looking for some other result I'm looking for more with for less but my brother and sister God wants us you and I to be complete sold out can we say today Lord I want to be completely sold out I'm not just looking to put my name on a book but I'm looking for that kind of relationship with Jesus Christ amen so they got their prophets and they've got their message they've got their Vindication amen my brother and sister these things happen in the natural world where people are just committed committed completely so sold out you know it happens in the spiritual world people completely sold out and you say well if someone's completely sold out then they must have it my brother and sister I was just reading about a man that the the Gospel of Jesus Christ met him in Nepal he was in a monastery and he was there completely committed in this life actually come from a family that was somewhat affluent and had been raised in in a a Pampered life and and uh could not find any satisfaction ction because at that day as ad doed child he just asked for it his parents gave it to him don't do that you'll build a character all right but it'll be a bad one that's right and so it's there that he decided I need to go find what truth is oh my the path that God will send us on to find truth the path that God would lead us down we say well why didn't you just take me from where I was at right to truth but sometimes God's got to condition you and I to bring us to a place that we can recognize what he does does is doing in our life and here's this man he says I'm going to go become a Buddhist monk and here he is I want you to understand this this particular sect had an open window he lived in basically a castle an open window all four seasons sometimes the snow would reach the level of the bottom of his window but you're being selfish there was some words in there I can't remember big words but how that you are thinking of yourself if you was to try to block the cold and he slept on a stone bed a thin blanket no pillow and they interpreted that as a reasonable service to God I wouldn't make a Buddhist monk I would have invented Windows I would have invented a fireplace something but the whole time he never stopped crying out Lord I want truth and one day he's walking down the street in this little I don't they call it there little village and he sees a scrap of paper blowing and he's picking it up because it's litter and that's kind of a duty and but he broke the rules and he looked at it and it was talking about how Jesus Christ died for your sins and it referenced the Apostle Paul saying I died daily something in his heart that's it and he says so it's not about how much physical suffering I can endure but it's about what Christ has done for me an incredible story my brother and sister because you don't just walk in and tell them H here's my resignation I'm leaving because you took a vow that they own you you're their possession that's right and the tentacles of sin are very very grippy like an octopus so you see what happens my brother and sister these happenings that's taking place we'll look at the deal I look on the internet there at the news and and you read this of what is happening and I I found it very interesting I'm not being judgmental but I want to lay a platform for you so there is a man interviewing this Palestinian uh doctor he's a surgeon and uh it's from his home that he is uh Skyping or whatever you call that this day and age and and uh you can tell he lives in a very very beautiful house mahogany and fine tapestries and and uh this man asked him very directly so there's evidence hard evidence of of these uh people taking the life of mother and small child uh multiple times being shot and and would you condemn that and the man very articulate works his way around that and his final defense is they've did it but you see that defense is no defense others have sinned that's my justification others have done this and done that but my brother and sister that's not what God's looking at God is looking at the personal accountability of men and women and you look at this and realize in this whole interview taking place the man was very articulate he lays this out and you realize what is happening my brother and sister is there's a side being taken and it's because of ancestry and family ties and religion and all of these things is pulling even men who you can sense don't agree but they're stepping over to that side because there's something anointing them to be pulled into this to be unit Ed because what would a man living in those circumstances that would come on a on a a national news thing and and say no they were horrible they were beasts they were this they were that his life would be finished everything would come to a halt immediately and they recognize that so whether they like it or not they're being drawn to a certain side and this is happening in our natural world but let's not get caught on just the natural world it's happening in the spiritual it's happening in the spiritual when people are like our fam's always been this they've always went to church here this is what we've always believe but what does God draw you to now amen it's not about grandfather it's not about great grandfather my brother and sister it's about what God's personal dealing with you and I amen and so it's there this uniting that's taking place there is a manifesting taking place in the day that we live in amen we know my brother and sister as the word of God clearly shows us that every seed brings forth of its own kind and so what we're seeing now is this manifestation that is coming forth and as the seeds are being come now the seed that was spoken there of the Angel of the Lord to Hagar says that your son is going to be a wild man now if you're father is a wild man what is he passing down to you amen he has a great nation my look at this it's everywhere but my brother and sister it's based on the relationship of the father every seed my brother and sister that brings forth is based on the relationship of the father and so it's there that there is a a deeply rooted Spirit there that's this wild man amen and as I said what do you expect the sons to be you raise your kids as wild men there's a family they visited us a little bit years ago in the other church amen they live in the woods of Montana and they live a very unique I would say lifestyle amen and um you know uh the the the young man he come it was it was summer time and he showed up at the church in in in snow boots and he showed up in insulated pants and and all this stuff and he's sitting in church and he's sweating and I'm thinking what is what's going on here we got to visit with him ultimately he came to the church cuz he wanted baptized some of you might remember we took him out to the lake and we baptized him there in the park but my brother and sister it was there he goes well he says you you got to understand the the lifestyle we live I might go hiking and then just decide to sleep under a tree for the night I'm like that's interesting how long you been doing that I was raised that way see he doesn't know any different see what's happening when the word of God said train up a child in the way he should go and when he is older he will not depart from it that's a two-edged sword my brother and sister that they will not depart from it until the wooing of the Holy Spirit deals with them amen and so there is this wild nature but when you feed on a message that is division and chaos and anger once again referring back when we was there I I don't remember have to ask sister Jerry but these young men I thought it was so ironic I just laughed at them and said sure sure but we were we were there Bethlehem and and these young Arab children Palestinian children run up to me yell in my face allahar and I was just like yep right sure they're wearing Nikes Adidas shirt everything they profess to hate so the hate they're expressing isn't really real to them do you follow me cuz if it was real they would not dress in anything from the Western world but it's not real to them it's taught to them it's superficial it's on the surface and if taken in a different world and raised in a different deal that child could have very well turned up to believe in Jesus Christ but train that way now look what's happening my brother and sister we train our children do this and do that and you're saved then what will they expect when they grow up if I do this and I do that I'm saved but the word says it's a personal relationship with Jesus Christ amen there's nothing else that will get us there and so what what happens the difference is is when we go with God's word or we go with man's plan see that can be implemented right here in this church we could decide to go with our own plan or we could take it right back to the word of God and decide that we are going to hold this word in such value that we will not be pulled away from it we will not be wooed away from it my brother and sister reminds me of a story I was reading in the Cold War of a man who originally started out to be absolutely faithful to his his country and yet he was being offered more and more money until finally they reached a number that he couldn't resist and I just remember reading one time about a man who was a Christian amen and he was talking about the things of the world and how Satan would woo and he makes a statement that is stuck with me and he says Every Man Has a price I pray that my price is too high for Satan to pay oh my brother and sister let that s into us that we have a price but it's already been paid for us amen I'll tell you what see so what happens is is you follow this natural plan and you look at this and and you see that God said this would happen a wild man possessing the land would be there constantly a butting of heads a constant friction and we get to see it daily in the news but let's turn this another way the word of God said that Satan would come and he would afflict you with his fiery darts we're here today now those fiery darts can become personal of fronts to you or you as a son or daughter of God can stand and say I've been warned that the devil's got this opportunity I've been warned that the devil's going to have his punch I'm going to stand on the word of God and no matter what happens in my life I'm going to stand with the word amen you know the word gets compromised so easily we we won't even go into those subjects but we know that we see what's happening how the word becomes compromised so easily it starts with just a little word well the scripture says one can start with just one and so it's there that we find amen that it's there and we're following often times I got a good friend when you talk to him he'll in conversation tell you I think he's the seventh generation of Baptists in his family pretty impressive really nothing gets Baptist he's a good man him and his wife wonderful people but is that what we base our Salvation on is how many generations that we have been of a certain religion so you see in that we realize God is gracious to break the bond of the natural to be able today to say Thank You Lord that I am as my father is and my father is not a wild man my father is a savior he's a Healer he's a provider he's willing to give his life for me that's the kind of father I serve and I say thank you Lord that uh you broke the natural bonds amen cuz I can look and that no doubt my own children grandchildren would say say well we see these things in you grandpa but and and Dad and whatever but my brother and sister we recognize how strong the element of our natural is in our life and you know it's kind of scary because I used to laugh when I would hear people say it and they'd be like Oh I'm 50 years old and I'm starting to act like my dad and I used to think that was so funny until I turned 50 and realized I don't want to be my dad and then every year that goes by another dad trait pops up and you just finally resign yourself but I tell you what God brought a change amen he broke the bond of the natural and poured in the spiritual and as every day goes by I find myself acting more and more like my father Amen to realize oh those heavenly traits that Heavenly genetics coming down into Sons and Daughters of God that we're not of this world we're not of the cares of this world we're not of the desires of this world but it is the nature of Christ and he said I poured myself into you and I say thank you Lord fill me to the top Fill Me To The Top up hallelujah amen now in the sermon God keeps his word it says right here 1957 it said and here the gospel come and give a mercy call throughout the Nations for years we've turned it down and now working the devil taking his seat is turning the hearts of these political men against Israel they're hooking up Over Yonder with the Arabs brother we're as good as gone that's right we'll sink as sure as the world now my brother and sister you can't tell me that God hasn't kept his word there's two great Nations the nation of Israel is not as many people but I'm telling you my brother and sister there is a certain I I for lack of a better word I'm sorry but there's a certain Vibe when you go there amen we had a tour guide the man had been which war was that do you remember Six Day War amen been shot been wounded wed had scars to prove this and he is there is an old man saying if war broke out tomorrow I would fight for my nation and you realize there's a fire burning inside there but he said we're not here to destroy anybody we've tried to open the borders with them right not an ecumenical movement not that kind of open borders but just to live as one country next to another which brings about a very interesting time when we were right there amen and uh at the Crossing of the Jordan is that Syrian Syrian guard on the other side do you guys remember Jordan Jordan do you guys remember that when he saw all of us over there looking across it's not very wide right there all of a sudden he's got his gun it was interesting you know and then basically when somebody come to relieve his duty he's halfway up the steps and he turns and he's like and walks off how many tourists has he looked at he's probably like oh those are Americans I'll show them but my brother and sister you see the conflict that's there they could live in that kind of Peace you can drive a few miles well I say a few miles few hours cross the Border go right into Jordan right there was some on the tour did that you know lost a phone lost glasses said the trip wasn't worth it but anyway amen but you see it's there that you look at this now it's given this Mercy call my brother and sister and and people didn't respond God dealt with Israel over and over and over again and they respond for a season and then they would cool right back off and go right back to their thing and what about America we got more churches than ever and the attendance amongst churches is declining rapidly and so it's not about the big buildings we built millions of dollars of buildings and no one wants to make the commitment to serve God it's too much work H but you can't tell me God doesn't keep his word now let's look at the other side of this story real quick here time getting away from us we'll tell as Paul Harvey used to say the rest of the story Abraham's spiritual seed now look my brother and sister Isaac and ishmail half Brothers there has to be some traits that they shared mannerisms both of them spiritual men that's right one Wild One calm their offspring the traits of their amount of children they have all these parallels that run through there but you look at this now the law of nature says that every seed must bring forth of its own kind aren't you glad you don't think you're planting an apple tree and you get a cactus amen every seed has to bring forth of its own kind and the promise has a continuation you realize that every promise God ever made in the Bible had a continuation to it you would see something fulfilled in the season but it will come and the pattern will repeat itself it's not as it is a complete Continuum but my brother and sister it's not a finality either so the promise of God is an unfolding that comes from generation to generation and it's that he made a promise unto your children and to your children's children and so God's allowing that Continuum to go on down but my brother and sister there's no guarantee that because your parents had the holy ghost that you're going to have the Holy Ghost you've got to get down in that private chamber and you've got to get in there with God Amen and it's not some old cold dry-eyed relationship but it's a passionate relationship that Lord You're My Savior and I love you and I want to serve you and I will amen Hallelujah and so as it's coming forth this continuation of fulfillment of it now in in this sermon we have seen his star and have come to worship him I I like this because of how this lays it out that it gives it very clear and when the Holy Ghost comes to you and reveals the word and makes it live just exact then it's a revelation to you you see it it's unfolded it's a promise for the hour now I can talk to you my brother and sister about what I have experience but if you never experience it all you have is second hand that's right and too many times we have as it is Anointed men or women sharing what they experienced in their life and people get excited and they say I like that that's good but they never actually experience it for themselves we need to have that kind of experience that it is my brother and sister my there's no no recorded history of ishmail laying on the altar with a knife at his chest and being there and God staying his hand so there will never be a time that ishmail will be able to say I've experienced God creating the ram in the bush I have experienced that my own father so obedient to God would be willing to sacrifice me to fulfill the word of God but I also saw that God respected my father's Comm commitment so much that he stayed his hand and I am here as a witness to that he had a blindfold he didn't have a gag on he witnessed this that was something he took with him all of his life but I tell you what they do have is they have ishmael's own experiences of being there without water in the desert and God guiding directly to the water and to say God's my provider also me too remember when we we spoke on that me too I did exactly what God showed me I heard God's voice but you see my brother and sister no promise to ishmail of eternal life that's right you see the multitudes joining together isn't this interesting I'm want to shorten this up just a little bit I knew I was just getting too much here there's a certain Aura do you remember because I've been reading about these things I get confused I believe it was a Six Day War um there was a known name in Israel of a war hero had been shot I believe it was in the hip or upper leg he's laying there bleeding profusely can't walk can't move an Egyptian's coming with a banet fixing to ban at him and he looks up in utter astonishment this man's witnessing he's laying on the ground looking at this man and the man's about to banet him in an utter astonishment drops his gun and turns and runs and that is experience that they share in that Nation how God came on the scene that was God they left weapons trucks idling tanks idling guns with a shell in the breach and they turned and ran God coming on the scene are you going to fight your battle or you going to let God Amen that's what it comes down to my brother and sister we either going to fight or God's going to fight and God won't fight until you quit fighting and give him the fight amen but look at this now the multitudes joining together I walk watched the other day an interview this might sound harsh visitors I'm sorry I'm just a blunt Country Boy raised in the farm and the Corell it's amazing how the UN can just choose such authentic people for their spokesman here's this guy with just the most gorgeous ponytail you've ever seen wearing just the right I don't know I'm sorry I'm not politically correct but all I got out of his whole thing about Israel needs to do what's right and you know everyone need to respect each other and they need to listen to the UN World memo no one in the world gives any credibility to the UN except for the people like the spokesman and then asked him well what about the UN demanding of Israel a a humanitarian access and the man blew me away when he says the UN is afraid of Israel yeah they're not afraid of Israel my brother and sister the truth of it is they're afraid of the god of Israel amen and the man is there talking about well we said we were going to do this and Israel told us no and we believed them how about we come to the place my brother and sister that when the devil says this this and this that we tell him no and he would believe us amen no devil you don't get our children no devil you don't get us no devil you don't get to control our life no devil you don't get to give this influence no devil and he will believe us my brother and sister you look at that but these multitudes are joining together and Egypt is over there I'm sorry to tie all this news together but to me I saw this whole context and hopefully I'm not out on on the limb but my brother and sister they're saying Egypt Egypt Egypt you ought to do this and Egypt says um we're going to just stay home we're going to mind our own business here last time we did what we did we got thrashed on and we're in no better position right now than we was then and Iran said well if that Israel keeps doing that we'll send our fighter jets and we'll destroy them and when the Jets met the Jets the Iranians turned and flew home my brother and sister can you see what God is doing it's not oh praise Israel they got their problems but this word of God will be fulfilled nothing no politics no things of this Earth will stop it but the word of God will be fulfilled and if the word of God declared that you as Sons and Daughters of God would be Overcomers and be Victorious and receive a healing amen the bomb of Gilead and when he said I'll give you back Sons and Daughters when he said I will anoint you to prophesy and dream dream that he meant it it wasn't just a hopeful or just a little word here but God said it would come to pass and when the word said that there would be a great catching away that would be there there's going to be a people my brother and sister that read that word and say God said it it will come to pass I'll be a part of that I'm going to be a participant in that Hallelujah amen it don't matter how many multitudes join together against the Bride of Jesus Christ it won't matter how many Devils just listen to a preacher the other day I respect the man's Ministry but I didn't quite see his point and he was talking about oh my what we have to fear the multitude of those demons been released out of the river Euphrates all the Christians in for a rough time well I'm telling you my brother and sister I've got Christ on my side and there's more that are with me than are against me and I don't have to sit and be afraid of what the world's going to my country over in Europe I won't even name a name has just made a little uh promotion to pass a law that making it mandatory that every child start their education at three years old the opponents right there in their own countries are like don't you mean start their indoctrination oh bam bam bam on the gaffle you're out of order why because the devil's exposed yeah yeah Hallelujah lovely old California you can't teach your own kids unless you got a teaching degree wait by the time you got your teaching degree your kids will be out of school well why because they want want to start young amen so you see when these multitudes are gathering together I'm using this whole thing with Hamas and Palestine and whatever as as the pattern you might say they're all joining together how long will it be we already see these other countries they they've got their own guys firing missiles over the Border in the north and they act like they can't do anything about it Jordan oh sorry Syria yeah what are we going to do about it one guy that I was looking he said I I would just like to ask a simple question if no one's involved where do all the missiles come from Gaza doesn't even have enough food and gasoline run generation plants and feed their people and they're building hypersonic pinpoint accurate missiles no see there's others joining behind other ones and if a spirit be cast out and return and find it cleaned and garnished but unoccupied that's right he goes and gets seven of his friends because they're all willing to come and serve with him you see the parallels my brother and sister natural spiritual coming this is not a war of geopolitics this is a war for men and women's Souls this is a war for control and Satan as he tempts Jesus he says look if you'll just bow down to me I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world he wasn't just bowing smoke at him Saints he literally was the prince that had possession when Jesus said H don't matter I'll get it all anyway the day will come it's mine anyhow you're just a temporary occupier you see as these multitudes are joining together and all this evil and and I find this I hope this doesn't offend any of our friends that that come from that part of the world but I thought it was so interesting uh Putin on the news rebuking Israel for their behavior man who has destroyed a big chunk of eastern Ukraine and even amongst his own people just chaos happening and and he's so I'm just stunned when I watched this it's Israel's fault they shouldn't behave this way and ultimately it's United States's fault okay okay good but what foot would he have to stand on but you see the word must be fulfilled they're joining together now do you realize this is all about parallels do you realize everything is a parallel in the parallel they're joining together it's got to be something else taking place there's got to be something else taking place amen now look at this in this amongst the p parallel it's uniting time yes sir now uniting time in sign goes like this notice they're right now uniting you say brother brandham is that true they're coming to the battle of Armageddon exactly what will they do see and they're uniting for that right now see this is a lot of years before amen a lot of years six years they're uniting for that right now and that's why we got the un and everything we have the Western world's uniting against the Eastern World communism so forth It's all uniting together the churches are uniting together everything seems to be uniting together and if you don't think that church is uniting together I I'm still stunned about that video that come out a few years ago of those ecumenical uh minded uh ecclesiastical minded uh apos not Apostolic uh Pentecostal and the guy's there and he's went in had an audience with the Pope and he comes out and they're like what was this and he's telling oh the most glorious thing we're all coming home to Mama right I'm sorry not my mama ex no sir Babylon is not my mama amen that Spirit of Babylon not my mama no but see anointed they're saying well this is where it all come from I'm sorry my brother and sister they got not one shred that Peter was the pope not one shred they repeated it enough times that the world believes them and not one shred of Hard Evidence but it's been repeated so much that it's become Doctrine yeah I was going to say a universal lie but yeah I know that's pretty pretty straightforward so what's happening they're uniting together so you have people United under that that once their forefather fought gave their lives and praise God at the Revelation that by faith that's it by faith my brother and sister no other thing by faith now it's come back made the full circle we got the UN and everything we have the Western World against the Eastern World communist so forth It's all uniting together churches un uned together everything seems to be uniting uniting themselves together we see that and um so you look here that's I actually had that's where I had the note about the UN it was interesting because the guy sitting there saying well we're actually afraid of them we're afraid of what they'll do little tinge of wild man right there right they don't know what they'll do but wait Hamas almost killed the UN observers that were in Gaza little you wild man there go find that story no selective selective also while this uniting of the nation these signs n National signs we see out here in the world earthquakes in diverse places different things uniting bringing the world together bringing the people people together all the churches together all these things and while this uniting has been going on there's another uniting going on amen that's what I want to point to you now God is uniting his bride she is coming together from east and west and north and south there's a uniting time that's on right now what is she uniting for the Rapture amen God's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with the word amen we don't have a church Dogma over here a book that we refer to page whatever my brother and sister we have a book all right amen and you don't even have to buy it from the church you can just get it just about anywhere amen and it's there that God has made this his his uh Cornerstone for us to build from yes sir uniting what's uniting with with the word for all heavens and earth will pass away but my word will shall never pass away she's uniting herself with thus sayith the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she is the bride now that seems like an aous statement my brother and sister but in a minute we'll take it right back to scripture that in in that uniting my brother and sister she is there for one reason that's motivated one reason that has brought her well to say one reason is not quite accurate but Follow Me One Reason that's there and that is because she's the bride and the bride has to be there for the bridegroom she's not the bride if she won't submit to the bridegroom oh forget about modern societal things my brother and sister of we're equal here and we're equal there even a man like Dave Ramsey given Financial advice these people call in and say well my husband and I we got everything split down the middle we did this and did this and da Ramsey is like so you say you have one boy yeah we have one little boy did you split him what is it he is the perfect union of a man and a woman and that could never come to pass if we were living like we should without there being a husband and a wife a bridegroom and a bride and the world my brother and sister caught up in their well we have accepted this and we have accepted that you accept what you want to this is what I accepted amen that's what I accepted Hallelujah some loose notes hallelujah look at this she is the bride that's right she's uniting herself with her bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the church and the bride and the word becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom have you ever noted in a good marriage and some people offended that I would put it that way I'm sorry be offended but in a good marriage my brother and sister the wife can answer for the husband in a good marriage in other words let's share it this way people owed us a pretty good chunk of money for some hay that we sold them and I told them I I'm I'm gone I'm over here on a tractor way away and they're like well I'll come back later I said no just go over and give that to my wife I can give this to your wife yeah yeah any money issues we have in our house are just between me and her he goes but um will you get it yeah look let me explain this to you my wife knows me so well yeah I can walk in the house and she go you got a smirk on your face I can walk right over to the mirror and there's nothing on my face but I was smirking in here and she'll be blah blah blah and I'm like and she's going to then say da da and lo and behold it happens that's when two have become one amen now how in the church with the title of brine have a different opinion than her husband how can she speak something that's not the word and stand on that and say that's what we believe you don't believe the word amen because our husband the Lord Jesus Christ he spoke and this bride has become one with her husband and she only wants to speak it's it's not a matter of conforming I I'll speak what my husband wants me to speak no she wants to she wants to speak his word she wants to be identified in him she wants to lay claim to him and to have him lay claim to her amen amen oh she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she is the bride and she's uniting herself for their bridegroom and the bridegroom is a word amen I'm I'm repeating myself I'm sorry lost myself there and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell amongst us in the church and the bride and the word becoming so one until the very word itself is working the works of the bridegroom you see it a uniting amen not no more join the church that's it where is it my brother and sister there's no join the church amen we don't need to stamp a brand that says Grace Tabernacle on you we need to stamp the Briand of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen to be identified with him amen amen amen you see a uniting not no more join the church not no more of this but flee from everything and tied to Jesus Christ see it's uniting time God uniting his bride together bringing it back just exactly uniting the words of his promise That's What's happen and you know what this is I'm going to use this paper as a little example here pick it off the floor at the same time amen you know what's happening in the promise of God's word my brother and sister the promise has always been there that's it it's always been there just like we were in him right the lamb slain before the foundation of the world we always was in him but here's the promise and in all of life the promise comes and one day we are not just by chance but a un uniting taking place and This Promise becomes our promise sir and when that promise actually becomes our promise well there ain't no taking it away that's right I'm not going to let go of this I'm not going to let go of the promise that the blood washed away every sin that I had I'm not going to let the promise that he is my healer be taken away from me I'm not going to let the promise you can name it my brother and sister in the word we're Christians we read our Bibles I'm not going to let that be taken away from me I believe it it's become me amen I have become it amen I believe it so much it's a very fiber of my bones that this word of God is who I am amen not just a person out here with religion but a son or daughter of God and if Christ is in you that means the word is in you and if the word is in you you manifest the life of Jesus Christ [Music] Hallelujah because the seed that's right has been planted I want to close with this Sister Sarah would you come amen hallelujah Revelations 19:7 one of my favorite scriptures all of Revelation 19 sir really stirs my heart yes sir amen Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice amen okay that's right no pouty faces no sir no whines no amen life is tough oh I I have to admit I'll make a confession to you church I I was whining the other day and it took a little word sharp word of rebuke from my wife well it wasn't real sharp it felt like like it was sharp can we go by feelings you know how she did it she just sent me a scripture I sitting there in the machine she just knew my face was probably this giant frowny face she just sends me a scripture and I read it and I was like first thought you know the devil's on the job easy for you to [Music] say second thought Chopper guiding itself down the field capital letters amen amen CU that was the truth amen and then I just felt the whole burden lift off of me when I said amen to the word I felt this burden just lift off not to sound carnal or whatever but it's like H the Lord set my table right there who am I to say Lord you made a mistake where you set my table his ways are perfect and I want to be a perfect Son of God Amen you know how you become a perfect son or daughter of God say Amen to the word let the word be manifested so be it Lord so be it lord it's painful but so be it Hallelujah let us

want to ask you a blunt question do you feel ready okay let's talk about the flesh first flesh don't feel ready but there is a deep rooted confidence that if God called me God called you that he's not going to leave you unprepared if we just have religion then well it's going to be what it's going to be but if you have a deep Abiding Love and embracing the word of God embracing his life and letting that seed come to life then don't have fear don't listen to the devil don't find yourself blown Every Which Way and always in a turmoil settle down and say if God called me he's never lost a one he finishes everything he begins and he began this work in me I didn't begin the work in me he began it and I'm going to have confidence in you Lord that you're finishing this same work oh let's just stand Hallelujah I could just go on and on and on Saints amen yeah I think any Minister would be able to say that the part of the reason we sometimes get so long is cuz we don't preach enough and then

Presence let the enemy hear my voice yes am amen I'm going to say even though all hell ass sail me I'll praise you Lord hallelujah hallelujah oh oh cuz you realize 197 doesn't say let us be glad and
