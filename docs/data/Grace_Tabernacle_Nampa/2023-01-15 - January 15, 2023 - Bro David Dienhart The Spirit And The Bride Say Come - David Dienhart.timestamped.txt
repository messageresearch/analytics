[40:38] let's just start with 22. this woman at
[40:41] the well
[40:42] a predestinated seed at the well I
[40:45] wonder are you at the well this morning

[41:18] Jew outwardly that was Jew inwardly
[41:21] I'm taking that for a day
[41:23] amen but the hour cometh and now is
[41:29] that the when the true worshipers

[42:33] God verse 24 God is a spirit
[42:37] and they that worship Him must

[42:47] so I want you to notice something here
[42:50] that
[42:52] they must
[42:54] worship Him
[42:56] in spirit
[42:58] and in truth amen and there's only one
[43:01] place of worship
[43:03] where he put his name

[43:30] until you realize you're in him and
[43:32] submit your life completely to him until
[43:35] you know him
[43:37] how you're going to worship Him
[43:39] and how you're going to know him except
[43:42] the Holy Spirit come upon the word to

[44:09] and verse 17.
[44:15] if you haven't done all of his
[44:17] Commandments
[44:21] how are you going to enter into the Tree
[44:23] of Life
[44:24] if you know what to do and don't do it
[44:26] it's to you it's sin
[44:29] and there's only three physical
[44:30] ordinances that left us I'll leave it
[44:33] there
[44:35] you say well I've done two but not the
[44:37] other
[44:39] all right let's look at verse 17. I just
[44:43] read that because just above that
[44:44] blessed are they that do his
[44:45] Commandments have the right to the Tree
[44:47] of Life
[44:49] all right verse 17 and the spirit

[45:41] and let him that heareth receiveth other
[45:44] words has an ear to hear say come and
[45:48] him and let him that is a thirst come
[45:53] and what are they what do they ask you
[45:55] to come to

[46:03] what they're asking you to come to the
[46:05] place of worship
[46:07] come
[46:10] on where's it how's it going to be
[46:11] spoken
[46:13] today through him
[46:15] in Bride form
[46:18] who is the bride him the most Sublime
[46:21] words in the whole message is that she
[46:23] is him

[46:28] amen
[46:31] and whosoever will let him take the
[46:34] Water of Life freely
[46:36] amen you may be seated turn with me to
[46:39] the scriptures also in Saint John 6.
[46:46] so who is this one she's the final voice
[46:49] to the final Age The Bride is the final
[46:52] voice what is the voice the word
[46:58] amen
[46:59] you say well Brother David
[47:01] how do you know that because in first
[47:03] John
[47:04] before we go to John 6 here in first
[47:06] John
[47:08] chapter 4 it says in verse 6 we are of
[47:12] God
[47:13] who's that speaking to
[47:15] as speaking to his bride
[47:19] that's bride testifying back we are of
[47:22] God
[47:23] how many know that you are of God
[47:28] you were in the root
[47:30] you are the branch
[47:32] bearing the energy
[47:36] from the Vine
[47:38] the vine was in the root you were in the
[47:40] root and the Vine
[47:42] bearing the fruit of the season the hour
[47:45] the time you're in
[47:47] what is the season of the hour of time
[47:48] we're in Bride time seed time the grain
[47:52] again son of man again
[47:56] himself again
[47:58] in the complete mystery of himself
[48:02] amen you say well who would be the
[48:06] complete mystery himself he's he's
[48:07] completing himself Adam was too but
[48:10] until Eve came forth
[48:13] revealed what was hidden in Adam
[48:15] and when the book was opened it revealed
[48:17] what was hidden in himself that's you
[48:23] you're the message right I just might as
[48:26] well come right down I'm not afraid to
[48:27] pull both barrels immediately because
[48:29] you are the message
[48:32] you are the light he said I am the light
[48:34] and ye are the light
[48:37] how can we walk in the light and not be
[48:39] the light
[48:41] how could we be washed by the blood of
[48:43] Jesus Christ and not walk in the light
[48:46] if we walk in the light we have
[48:48] Fellowship one with another with him and
[48:50] the blood cleanses us from all sin what
[48:53] is a light The Word of Promise The Word
[48:55] of Promise is the seed The Word of
[48:58] Promise is the light
[49:02] amen
[49:04] that word made manifest is light
[49:09] all right so we see here let's go back
[49:12] here to let's see oh yes he said we're
[49:14] of God verse of first John 4 6 and he
[49:19] that knoweth God I'm coming back to this
[49:21] revelation 22 I just read and he that
[49:24] knoweth God heareth us
[49:27] the spirit of the Bride say come and he
[49:29] that heareth saith come
[49:34] is that right
[49:35] and he that heareth happens to be my
[49:37] brother my True Blood Brother
[49:41] and sister
[49:43] is that right because because why same
[49:47] father
[49:50] same body
[49:52] same Christ
[49:54] it's not another Christ it's all that
[49:56] Christ was he poured into his body his
[49:58] church his bride where is his name
[50:04] it's in her
[50:07] that's it
[50:09] that's it now we're coming into spirit
[50:11] and Truth
[50:15] that's right
[50:18] amen so so we say here see now we're
[50:21] coming here he says there that he that
[50:23] heareth us he that knoweth God heareth
[50:26] us
[50:27] why because we're the word living we're
[50:29] the word speaking where the word himself
[50:32] we have the mind of God
[50:34] to know what he wants done with his word
[50:36] and we know that it's him working in and
[50:39] through us then he that heareth us he
[50:41] that knoweth God heareth us
[50:46] okay and so he said he that is not of
[50:49] God heareth not us
[50:52] it's not hearing with the ears it's
[50:54] hearing with your heart
[50:57] then what is your heart speaking back
[50:58] lord hear my heart
[51:02] I wonder is it communion
[51:06] that's why we take communion
[51:08] that's why we take the Lord's Supper we
[51:11] do this in remembrance of what he has
[51:13] done for us what did he do for us he
[51:15] poured out his life to us what is the
[51:17] life in us our defecation that we were
[51:19] in him
[51:20] always were in him
[51:23] that's what we testify that's why a new
[51:25] birth is the reason we come to take
[51:27] communion without the new birth you
[51:28] can't hear how can you take communion
[51:30] you're not in communion
[51:33] boy that was strong but that's the truth
[51:36] go back to go back to Future Hope and
[51:38] see if that's not what the prophet said
[51:39] about the Lord's Supper
[51:41] who's who could take it and who couldn't
[51:46] amen
[51:49] that's powerful I know but that's the
[51:51] truth
[51:53] amen it's I'm not playing around if I'm
[51:56] gonna I don't have much time left upon
[51:58] this Earth and I might as well just say
[51:59] it like it is and bring the word the
[52:01] message I'm going to preach to you Faith
[52:03] because the revelation of the word that
[52:06] you're hearing through this word will
[52:07] bring Faith
[52:08] if the faith isn't preached how are you
[52:11] going to get Faith Faith cometh by
[52:13] hearing the word what are you hearing
[52:15] the letter no you're hearing you're
[52:16] hearing the faith or the Revelation or
[52:19] the mind of God that's in the letter
[52:22] that's right if you hear that Minister
[52:24] then Faith cometh by hearing that word
[52:27] because Faith lays in that word
[52:32] I hope you got that
[52:34] that spirit and Truth coming together
[52:37] that's what the bride is she is that
[52:42] she is spirit and Truth
[52:46] because why he is spirit and Truth
[52:51] it's the word living
[52:55] and in action
[52:57] amen
[52:59] all right so we see here that he he that
[53:01] is not of God heareth not us hereby no
[53:04] we hereby no we the spirit of truth and
[53:08] the spirit of error he that can receive
[53:09] can hear the word is of God
[53:13] you want to know what the evidence is
[53:14] there it is if you want to note the
[53:16] evidence of the whole of the indwelling
[53:18] of the holy spirit is there it is you're
[53:21] able to hear and to receive the word for
[53:23] your season
[53:25] that spirit and word coming together to
[53:28] manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[53:31] today and forever
[53:34] amen
[53:37] all right so if we know that they can't
[53:40] hear that then we know hereby and it's
[53:42] not us judging anybody the word's
[53:45] judging you you judge yourself by the
[53:47] word
[53:48] he is the word
[53:51] if we change his position anything from
[53:54] being that then we've missed it we're
[53:57] not we're not Ministers of the letter we
[53:59] are ministers of the spirit for the
[54:01] spirit giveth life to the letter
[54:04] the spirit is the spirit is him in the
[54:07] letter
[54:08] under the letter
[54:11] you see what I mean
[54:15] yes amen and there's going to be a bride
[54:17] that will be that word living
[54:20] the life of that word living she'll be a
[54:22] living manifestation she'll be a living
[54:24] Bible she's a living letter
[54:28] Amen in the promised word for this hour
[54:30] she's got to be because she is that
[54:33] promised word that's the seed that's the
[54:35] promised seed
[54:38] that's not he that's born of the flesh
[54:40] that's he that's born of the spirit
[54:44] amen
[54:46] all right
[54:47] so hereby know we the spirit of truth
[54:49] and the spirit of error
[54:52] they can't hear the word then they're
[54:55] not they can't be of God if they can't
[54:56] hear the word now that isn't judging
[54:58] immediately you may come to hear it
[55:00] ponder it hear it God will Quicken it to
[55:02] you we're not standing here judging
[55:03] you're in and you're out and you're in
[55:05] and you're out but by their fruit they
[55:07] are known because the fruit is not
[55:10] emotion the fruit is the word living for
[55:12] the season to receive the word for the
[55:15] season
[55:16] right
[55:18] and how are you going to do that without
[55:19] the spirit coming on that word
[55:23] amen that's what sets the bride apart
[55:26] from the church
[55:28] as she's the word living and in action
[55:30] she's the living and operative word
[55:35] hallelujah what caught our attention was
[55:38] that the word come on the scene knowing
[55:39] the secrets of the heart what caught the
[55:41] attention of the woman at the well we
[55:43] know that when Messiah cometh he'll say
[55:45] and speak these things that know these
[55:47] things but who are you
[55:50] and brother Brad said when that word
[55:51] comes down in you it's a messiah again
[55:53] it's a messiah in action it's Christ the
[55:56] anointed word living in action
[56:00] to the season to the time
[56:04] you have the substance you were the
[56:06] thought in him now the substances become
[56:09] life because it was spoken by a word
[56:11] it's always the word coming forth It's
[56:14] the opening of the word that will put
[56:16] you in a body change
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] Hallelujah amen
[56:23] amen now
[56:27] I'm just starting all right
[56:35] let me just before we go to St John well
[56:38] let's read Saint John 6.
[56:40] I told you to turn over there so let's
[56:42] go to Saint John 6.
[56:45] and see here
[56:47] and let's start with the 63rd verse
[56:51] this is when the 70 had left demon this
[56:54] is a hard saying and
[56:56] what if you say he come from God and he
[56:58] said well that's a hard saying he we
[56:59] know him as a man we know where he lived
[57:01] we know he's born they were judging by
[57:03] the outside Jesus said I don't judge by
[57:05] the outside you judge by the outside I
[57:07] judge no man Paul said himself I we
[57:10] don't know
[57:11] a man by the flesh
[57:13] we don't know
[57:15] we knew Jesus by the flesh but
[57:16] henceforth no we him no more
[57:22] amen so quit your judging by the outside
[57:25] let's start judging what is being lived
[57:29] out
[57:30] from the inside
[57:32] amen all right now so Saint John 8
[57:38] or no six I'm sorry Saint John 6.
[57:42] 63rd verse it is the spirit that
[57:45] quickeneth
[57:47] our our pastor brought this last time
[57:50] you're talking about the spirit without
[57:51] the word without the spirit no good
[57:57] all right he said it is the spirit that
[57:59] quickeneth so you can have the word but
[58:02] without the spirit
[58:05] you just got a letter
[58:08] you don't have the thought
[58:11] you don't have the substance
[58:14] of that word
[58:19] amen all right it is the spirit that
[58:21] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[58:26] well that's a good one
[58:29] the flesh profiteth nothing
[58:35] the words
[58:36] here it is the words that I speak
[58:41] unto you they are Spirit
[58:44] and they are life
[58:46] they are Spirit The Words the words are
[58:49] spirit and life
[58:52] amen
[58:54] all right
[58:57] for Jesus but there but there are some
[59:00] of you that believe not for Jesus knew
[59:03] from the beginning who were they were
[59:04] that believe not and who should betray
[59:06] him
[59:10] amen all right Genesis 5 24 very
[59:14] familiar scripture but let's go back
[59:16] there Enoch was a type
[59:18] of our day seventh from Adam
[59:21] Enoch typed our day the emphasis on
[59:24] Enoch is that he walked with God the
[59:27] emphasis today for a bride today is that
[59:29] she's walking with God
[59:34] oh they do great exploits Enoch built a
[59:36] pyramid which was the word
[59:38] the Revelation he had the full complete
[59:40] revelation of that word
[59:42] amen but the head Capstone couldn't be
[59:45] put on it until this hour
[59:49] so he had the Revelation that he needs
[59:51] to leave it off of there until the
[59:53] fullness of that Revelation comes forth
[59:55] and the stone within that pyramid is
[59:58] made known as the Capstone
[1:00:02] and that is yours and my
[1:00:05] adoption or perfection
[1:00:09] amen because our message today is the
[1:00:12] Capstone
[1:00:15] that's our message today is the Capstone
[1:00:18] and it's Jesus Christ
[1:00:21] himself revealed
[1:00:23] in the form of
[1:00:25] his word bride because he said this
[1:00:28] messenger pick up your pen and write
[1:00:29] this messenger would point the people to
[1:00:32] a word born bride
[1:00:34] and then he would point that word he
[1:00:37] said and that word born bride will be
[1:00:38] pointed to the land in the sky and the
[1:00:41] Bible and the prophet said in Rising of
[1:00:43] the Sun and that's our Lord up there
[1:00:46] we saw him we seen his picture and that
[1:00:49] was The Headstone coming to the bride
[1:00:51] for Unity to receive her to bring her to
[1:00:55] where he is
[1:00:57] the climax of this whole coming the
[1:01:00] Revelation is his coming the Revelation
[1:01:02] to the bride is his coming and the
[1:01:05] coming of the Lord will be climaxed in
[1:01:07] our meeting in the air and our body
[1:01:09] change
[1:01:13] the bride knows her husband
[1:01:17] her name was in that book in fact that
[1:01:19] whole book contained her name because
[1:01:21] her that book was the another record in
[1:01:24] the in the in the book of life but
[1:01:26] another record was the eternal life
[1:01:29] record of Christ himself and that was he
[1:01:31] said that's the bride's book
[1:01:36] yeah you know I've just been through
[1:01:37] that series
[1:01:38] the white Throne judgment
[1:01:40] amen all right
[1:01:43] that's not another book is another
[1:01:45] record in the book
[1:01:47] and this is the record that he's given
[1:01:49] to us eternal life and that life is a
[1:01:52] son and he that hath the son Hallelujah
[1:01:54] he that hath the seed half life because
[1:01:57] the spirit that quickeneth was sent to
[1:02:00] Quicken that word quickened that life
[1:02:06] and if that word of that life is
[1:02:07] quickened what would it be it would be
[1:02:09] Jesus Christ himself again manifested in
[1:02:12] flesh
[1:02:13] Eve was the mystery of Adam revealed
[1:02:17] he was Mrs Adam
[1:02:19] yeah amen that's correct amen amen
[1:02:23] amen it was an unveiling an unveiling a
[1:02:26] complete unveiling of himself
[1:02:29] but she always already the mystery in
[1:02:31] him but when the rock beneath the rock
[1:02:33] was unveiled we come to ourselves face
[1:02:36] to face with him Hallelujah
[1:02:39] because it called our name
[1:02:45] it opened up the word the word is
[1:02:47] unveiled to us
[1:02:51] now we become and are the very
[1:02:53] revelation of himself
[1:02:57] you want the prophet's word for it he
[1:02:59] said the bride is the Revelation is
[1:03:01] himself revealed

[1:03:34] and have a bunch of nonsense called fear
[1:03:38] there's no fear in Walking with God
[1:03:40] he's already ordered the steps we take
[1:03:42] in fact Psalm 32 8 let's let's turn
[1:03:45] before I before I read that scripture
[1:03:46] there let's turn to Psalm 32 8 a minute
[1:03:48] I didn't know how I was coming this
[1:03:50] together I just it's going to be just
[1:03:51] Way Beyond what I thought
[1:03:54] but I knew God would bring it
[1:03:56] if you believe that Brother David
[1:03:57] absolutely I don't have my own ideas

[1:04:18] nothing but an instrument data is
[1:04:20] nothing but a vessel a flesh vessel
[1:04:24] that's not my identification
[1:04:30] my identification is in Christ
[1:04:33] in me is the identification showing that
[1:04:35] I was in his thought I was the thinking
[1:04:38] of himself and I was his eternal thought
[1:04:40] of himself before the foundation of the
[1:04:42] world I was his heart purpose he chose
[1:04:45] me sovereignly before the world began
[1:04:50] it was his own choosing
[1:04:52] I had nothing to do with it
[1:04:55] but I'm not ashamed of it
[1:04:58] and I glorify him in it because he's
[1:05:01] given me the record the record that I
[1:05:03] have he's given me is unveiled to me

[1:09:50] worship was and I'm in that place of
[1:09:52] worship and his name is revealed in me

[1:12:36] yeah now somebody kind of go around
[1:12:38] boasting themselves it's the word
[1:12:41] of Truth
[1:12:43] living
[1:12:47] he's the word
[1:12:49] all right now so Genesis I'm sorry not
[1:12:53] Genesis
[1:12:54] um yeah Genesis 5. and Enoch walked with
[1:12:57] God
[1:12:59] and he was not now if Enoch walked with
[1:13:02] God and was not what's the bride going
[1:13:04] to end up being
[1:13:06] she'll become a was not
[1:13:10] she's already spiritually or was not
[1:13:13] because she's already raptured
[1:13:14] Revelations 4 1 we've already raptured
[1:13:17] up caught up above laodicea the bride is
[1:13:19] not in laodicea I just might as well say
[1:13:22] it like it is right now brother Branham
[1:13:24] said that bride we've gone into a bride
[1:13:27] age we've turned the corner
[1:13:29] the Corner's been turned
[1:13:31] Hallelujah that's our Lord up there
[1:13:33] quickening pop lets us see his coming
[1:13:35] the Corner's been turned we're not we're
[1:13:37] not up here we're in the grain time
[1:13:39] brother Ram said don't you realize this
[1:13:41] is bright time
[1:13:43] this is seed time this isn't the
[1:13:45] Pentecostal time you had your
[1:13:47] Pentecostal but Pentecostal true baptism
[1:13:49] brought you to the maturity of this word
[1:13:51] and now you're the bride you're in the
[1:13:54] bride age you're in a raptured age
[1:13:57] Rapture brother sister goodness sakes
[1:13:59] we've undone Rapture spiritually we've
[1:14:02] already raptured and it's that Faith
[1:14:04] that'll change our mortal bodies
[1:14:08] how can communion then have how can
[1:14:11] light have communion with Darkness if
[1:14:13] you can't discern that darkness that you
[1:14:15] have and you've befriended and have
[1:14:16] influence over then you need a baptism
[1:14:19] you need a true spiritual birth
[1:14:22] because that word inside of you is a
[1:14:25] discerner and he said I'll live in them
[1:14:27] and I'll walk in them and I'll instruct
[1:14:29] them and I'll teach them and I'll lead
[1:14:31] them into all truth Saint John 16 13.
[1:14:35] I'll lead them unto all truth and I will
[1:14:38] hear the word and I will live it
[1:14:43] amen who will hear the word he and you
[1:14:47] hears the word it's not David trying to
[1:14:50] figure it out David this and David that
[1:14:52] David had nothing to do about hearing
[1:14:53] the word it's that Soul inside of me
[1:14:56] that has that seed laying there it has
[1:14:58] that ultimate land there that God sent
[1:15:00] and went out for By His spirit and found
[1:15:02] and quickened to life
[1:15:06] then what is it among us today
[1:15:08] it's Jesus Christ Among Us friends who
[1:15:12] do you say this is who is this
[1:15:14] Melchizedek
[1:15:17] yeah
[1:15:18] it's the son of man in Bride form
[1:15:22] I've heard from that theophany that's
[1:15:24] who I am is Melchizedek yes
[1:15:29] amen a lot of time could be spent on
[1:15:33] those little statements
[1:15:35] as the minister would know you could
[1:15:36] take that and just preach a whole sermon
[1:15:38] many sermons on it
[1:15:40] amen
[1:15:43] all right
[1:15:44] so but Hebrews 11 let's go over there he
[1:15:47] walked with God and he was not
[1:15:49] for God who took him
[1:15:51] I just think I'll just take myself no he
[1:15:53] didn't take himself anywhere God took
[1:15:55] him
[1:15:56] it was God's achievement it was God's
[1:15:58] work it was God's doing it was God
[1:16:00] revealing he walked from Faith to Faith
[1:16:02] brother Brown said he lived from Faith
[1:16:03] to Faith he walked a little higher each
[1:16:05] step he was a little higher each step a
[1:16:07] little higher and how the prophet said
[1:16:09] he walked with raptured faith
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:16] so a Hebrews 11 if you go over here to
[1:16:18] Hebrews 11 then you'll find out that
[1:16:20] about more little more about Enoch
[1:16:22] remember he's our type
[1:16:24] if Enoch walked with God this bride's
[1:16:26] got to be walking with God
[1:16:28] it's just before the destruction
[1:16:33] amen all right
[1:16:36] he's no special man he was a man but he
[1:16:38] caught revelation God revealed himself
[1:16:41] sovereignly to Enoch one man
[1:16:45] showing it would be an individual walk
[1:16:50] amen amen all right it's uh
[1:16:54] Hebrews
[1:16:57] 5 11 5 by faith
[1:17:00] by what
[1:17:02] Revelation hello revelation of the word
[1:17:05] is that right what God hid is revealed
[1:17:08] to you
[1:17:09] he said it's never revealed to a group
[1:17:10] it's an individual go back and see what
[1:17:12] the prophet said about that over and
[1:17:14] over and over again especially in Christ
[1:17:16] The Mystery of God revealed over and
[1:17:18] over it's an individual it's an
[1:17:19] individual that he vindicates himself
[1:17:21] proves himself to us an individual
[1:17:25] never a group he said it's individual
[1:17:29] don't try to perfect your church your
[1:17:31] church won't get perfected but you will
[1:17:37] I'm not saying there isn't perfect ones
[1:17:39] perfect ones walking in among them
[1:17:40] certainly there is but there's three
[1:17:42] kinds of Believers in every congregation
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:49] you say you're ashamed you ought to be
[1:17:51] ashamed to say that I'm not ashamed of
[1:17:52] it he just wasn't ashamed to say it I'm
[1:17:54] not saying who is and who isn't but I am
[1:17:56] telling you what the bride is
[1:17:59] Soul you have to match there has to be a
[1:18:01] match
[1:18:03] you're the peace
[1:18:05] has to come back has to come with the
[1:18:08] word
[1:18:09] it's not your understanding it's not
[1:18:11] your ideas not David's ideas
[1:18:14] it's Christ in you
[1:18:17] Christ in you Christ The Mystery of God
[1:18:20] revealed in you
[1:18:25] okay
[1:18:27] so by faith Enoch was translated
[1:18:30] so how do you get there from from the
[1:18:33] from when he how he met God and always
[1:18:35] was with God and always was God and God
[1:18:37] just revealed himself to Enoch
[1:18:40] talk about A peculiar character
[1:18:44] walked with God
[1:18:48] showing the bride would be separated
[1:18:50] from everything else
[1:18:52] no Organization no dominating female
[1:18:54] spirit
[1:18:58] with God Alone
[1:19:00] amen with God Alone
[1:19:02] let that go of that denominational
[1:19:04] feeling and sensation and high don't you
[1:19:08] let that thing swallow you up
[1:19:10] that dominating female will never come
[1:19:13] under the headship of the word
[1:19:17] amen and in fact it assurps the word
[1:19:20] it's the very seed of the Catholic
[1:19:22] Church
[1:19:24] God will have nothing to do with that
[1:19:27] amen
[1:19:29] I don't care where it shows up
[1:19:32] the bridal chop his head off
[1:19:34] because she will not put up with that
[1:19:36] spirit
[1:19:39] won't come around her and have influence
[1:19:41] over her she won't allow it
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:47] if they don't speak according to the law
[1:19:49] and Prophets there's no life in them
[1:19:52] brother Brandon said you don't he said
[1:19:54] you don't receive the word like that
[1:19:56] just by reading the word he said you
[1:19:58] read between the lines
[1:20:00] he said you just don't receive the word
[1:20:02] verbatim well he said it and this is the
[1:20:04] way no no he said it's a love letter and
[1:20:06] it was sent to the bride and only the
[1:20:08] bride can read it right
[1:20:11] apparently yes amen he hid his mystery
[1:20:17] amen but he reveals it to his own
[1:20:21] his own that's himself
[1:20:24] he planned all this he made it possible
[1:20:26] it's his achievement not yours
[1:20:30] all right so by faith Enoch was
[1:20:32] translated that he should not translate
[1:20:34] his changed he was translated that he
[1:20:36] should not see death and was not found
[1:20:39] because God had translated him for
[1:20:42] before his translation he had this
[1:20:44] testimony that he pleased God
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:50] I was just going to get back here to
[1:20:52] where
[1:20:53] well I'll come to it possibly but
[1:20:56] Brother Brad said he pleased God
[1:20:58] with raptured faith
[1:21:01] amen that's perfect Faith he had this
[1:21:04] testimony
[1:21:06] and there's a people today through who
[1:21:08] through the blood of the Lamb
[1:21:10] and the testimony which they held
[1:21:13] overcomes
[1:21:14] is that right
[1:21:16] through their testimony
[1:21:17] I wonder if that testimony would happen
[1:21:19] to be the same testimony in a cat yes
[1:21:24] that's right it was this is my husband
[1:21:27] this is the word this is who I am
[1:21:31] that's a testimony you overcome by the
[1:21:33] word of your testimony
[1:21:35] Revelations 12 11.
[1:21:38] amen is that right absolutely
[1:21:41] okay then
[1:21:44] because he said he had this testimony
[1:21:46] that he pleased God and the next verse
[1:21:48] says but without faith
[1:21:51] but without revelation
[1:21:55] and came to everybody and said we
[1:21:57] denounce all Revelations we don't
[1:21:58] believe in it then he said you can't
[1:21:59] believe in Jesus Christ because Jesus
[1:22:01] Christ is the revelation of the word
[1:22:07] amen he was God in son form is that
[1:22:09] right then who's the bride
[1:22:11] it's the same God
[1:22:13] in Bride form
[1:22:17] we were in him the fullness of what
[1:22:19] godhead was in him and we were in him
[1:22:22] so the same mystery the same God the
[1:22:24] same Revelation would thou be passed
[1:22:26] down to a many-membered body which is
[1:22:28] still him
[1:22:29] it's him
[1:22:31] father son Holy Ghost father son bride
[1:22:37] which is himself
[1:22:40] amen the word himself Spirit form the
[1:22:43] word in you
[1:22:45] who fleshes it in now
[1:22:49] then that makes us in the sun won that
[1:22:51] makes us and God absolutely won
[1:22:56] amen
[1:22:59] then I and you are absolutely this the
[1:23:02] attribute of God
[1:23:04] promise for this day the promised word
[1:23:06] of God for this day made manifest
[1:23:10] that's what the prophet said we'd be she
[1:23:12] said he said the bride would be
[1:23:13] absolutely the revelation of the son of
[1:23:15] man again
[1:23:18] amen all right now
[1:23:22] so let's go to Saint John
[1:23:25] eight
[1:23:30] Saint John 8
[1:23:38] and let's look here at verse 31.
[1:23:41] then said Jesus to those Jews which
[1:23:43] believed on notice he spoke to the
[1:23:45] Believers here if you continue in my
[1:23:48] word then are ye my disciples indeed
[1:23:54] why he was the word all right then it
[1:23:57] goes down here and it says
[1:23:59] 32 and ye shall
[1:24:02] say the next word for me
[1:24:04] no
[1:24:08] I didn't get how much amen out of that
[1:24:11] you know what no means
[1:24:13] it's not hit anymore all right
[1:24:15] it's revealed to you
[1:24:18] brother Branham always came back to
[1:24:19] Faith the Revelation is being annoying
[1:24:21] it's not something you imagine not
[1:24:23] something you hope for it's something
[1:24:24] you know right it's substance
[1:24:28] all right then right here it says
[1:24:31] and you shall know
[1:24:33] the truth Jesus said Saint John's Saint
[1:24:36] John 14 I am the way
[1:24:40] the truth
[1:24:41] and the life
[1:24:43] and you shall know the truth and the
[1:24:46] truth shall make you free then you're no
[1:24:53] more under bondage
[1:24:54] there's nothing here in bondage under
[1:24:56] you're a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:25:01] this is a love walk
[1:25:06] amen but that love perfect love the love
[1:25:10] charity is not the evidence of the
[1:25:12] indwelling of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:15] brother Brown thought it was until he
[1:25:18] said the angel of the Lord corrected me
[1:25:19] and it says being able to hear and
[1:25:21] receive the word for your season
[1:25:24] by revelation
[1:25:28] amen he said there's the genuine
[1:25:30] evidence
[1:25:31] that you're a genuine seed of God
[1:25:37] Hallelujah
[1:25:39] amen
[1:25:41] that's something and yet you got to have
[1:25:43] love
[1:25:44] because God is love
[1:25:47] but see Satan can pervert that
[1:25:50] he can copy it but he can't copy the
[1:25:52] third pull
[1:25:57] he can't copy the opened of the World
[1:25:58] opening of the word and it's the opening
[1:26:00] of the word
[1:26:02] that absolutely ignite you with him in
[1:26:04] communion and fellowship and Oneness
[1:26:06] it's that opening of the word that puts
[1:26:09] you in a rapture
[1:26:10] it's the opening of the word that sets
[1:26:12] you in Rapture already it's the opening
[1:26:14] of the word that that you're walking
[1:26:16] with
[1:26:17] God opens himself God reveals himself
[1:26:20] and you apply that token and you apply
[1:26:22] that token and you apply that token and
[1:26:24] apply it so it's on display it must be
[1:26:27] applied
[1:26:29] you're not walking with just nobody
[1:26:30] you're walking with the literal life of
[1:26:33] Jesus Christ himself in you a person
[1:26:37] you've accepted the leadership of
[1:26:39] eternal life Leadership of eternal life
[1:26:41] is Christ the person yes
[1:26:43] you've accepted that leadership you've
[1:26:45] given yourself over to that leadership
[1:26:47] you've let go you've abandoned yourself
[1:26:50] you have depended completely now upon
[1:26:52] his leadership
[1:26:54] if you really mean that and really want
[1:26:56] that then watch God go into action and
[1:26:58] display and manifest himself through you
[1:27:00] to the Word of Promise for the season
[1:27:07] amen
[1:27:09] amen
[1:27:10] all right so
[1:27:12] verse 30 we'll jump to verse 36.
[1:27:16] and if the sun shall make you free
[1:27:19] you shall be free indeed he that hath
[1:27:22] the son hath
[1:27:24] life
[1:27:27] and he said and Upon This Rock of
[1:27:28] Revelation I'll build my church
[1:27:32] what was it not to every Young Blood he
[1:27:34] said that who do you say that I am
[1:27:37] you say
[1:27:40] Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:27:42] of the Living God and I say to you not
[1:27:44] the rest of them
[1:27:45] I say to you Peter individually I say to
[1:27:49] you
[1:27:50] you have not received that by
[1:27:52] intellectual study and learning you
[1:27:54] don't receive that be some somebody told
[1:27:56] you that he said you didn't receive a
[1:27:58] secondary a second-hand religion or
[1:28:00] Revelation he said My Father which is in
[1:28:03] heaven has revealed that to you
[1:28:06] and Upon This Rock Revelation I'll build
[1:28:08] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[1:28:10] never ever ever able never able ever
[1:28:13] able to withstand it
[1:28:16] and brother Brad said what's the Gates
[1:28:17] of Hell against today is the personal
[1:28:19] revelation in your soul of Christ being
[1:28:22] here now
[1:28:25] that's exactly what he said that's what
[1:28:27] all hell's against
[1:28:29] he said because the hell wouldn't be
[1:28:30] prevailed against it shows that the
[1:28:32] gates of hell would be against it
[1:28:34] and good people
[1:28:36] doing Mighty works
[1:28:38] casting out devils preaching under
[1:28:41] anointing and go to hell
[1:28:44] because Jesus said I don't know you
[1:28:49] who is he the word the spirit and the
[1:28:54] word never came together
[1:28:57] I don't know you
[1:28:59] I don't know you I'm not married to you
[1:29:02] you are not my thinking
[1:29:04] though you've done all these Mighty
[1:29:06] works
[1:29:08] that was the works of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:09] doing it
[1:29:11] but he said and we all believe in
[1:29:13] casting out Devils we all believe in
[1:29:15] that I dance and I've shouted under the
[1:29:17] Revelation that I'm free
[1:29:21] that I have Victory right now I've got
[1:29:23] Victory you know what my victory is my
[1:29:25] faith
[1:29:26] his faith
[1:29:28] if you hold that Faith you already got
[1:29:30] victory in the delicate you don't have
[1:29:32] Victory look at you look at how you feel
[1:29:33] look at what you're doing
[1:29:35] it's nothing to it my our faith is the
[1:29:38] victory
[1:29:39] what is our faith the revelation of
[1:29:42] himself in you that is my faith that is
[1:29:45] the Revelation that's my testimony he's
[1:29:48] present tense walking in this body
[1:29:54] and every member of the Bride will have
[1:29:57] the same revelation
[1:29:59] a different positioning in the body but
[1:30:01] the same Revelation the same head
[1:30:03] they're United to one head they are one
[1:30:06] person
[1:30:10] and because I hold the token and he's
[1:30:12] the token I walk with then I apply the
[1:30:14] token and the situation Rises up I place
[1:30:16] God another situation Rises up I place
[1:30:19] God when the wife gets a little angry
[1:30:21] with me I place God when this situation
[1:30:23] doesn't go just right I play Scott Place
[1:30:25] God Place God play the word apply the
[1:30:28] token apply the token there's no fear
[1:30:30] you're walking with God
[1:30:33] put it in his hands and watch him work
[1:30:36] commit it to him and watch him work
[1:30:38] why because he's made flesh in you
[1:30:43] Hallelujah Walking In You
[1:30:46] amen you say it says no story Brother
[1:30:48] David no it's a new story it's a brand
[1:30:50] new
[1:30:51] it has to be the word for the season
[1:30:54] it's the bride coming of Christ
[1:30:59] we've come out of Leo to see a dark
[1:31:01] denominationalism we raptured up and now
[1:31:05] when we raptured up we begin to see
[1:31:06] things that were hidden things in the
[1:31:08] book The Mystery of himself and it's
[1:31:10] open to us
[1:31:14] amen
[1:31:15] Revelation 4 1 is exactly what it is we
[1:31:19] say what is it you talk about a climax
[1:31:20] if I don't have that I won't have the
[1:31:22] climax
[1:31:23] if I don't have this revelation of his
[1:31:26] coming now I will miss the Rapture and
[1:31:29] the other change in my body
[1:31:34] because Sarah conceived
[1:31:38] and bear a son the very son they were
[1:31:40] looking for
[1:31:42] I'll let you chew on that a while
[1:31:46] she was a changed person and so are you
[1:31:48] spiritually you've been changed you are
[1:31:50] a new creation
[1:31:56] amen you're a new creation you've been
[1:31:58] through your Pentecost
[1:32:00] the Pentecost made way for
[1:32:03] the maturity of the word
[1:32:05] for Rapture for body change
[1:32:09] so don't get hung up back here just go
[1:32:11] through it keep walking
[1:32:15] amen amen you'll put those things right
[1:32:19] in order where they need to be in you
[1:32:20] and bring you to your head and reveal to
[1:32:23] you that you and the head are one
[1:32:25] that
[1:32:27] is perfection
[1:32:30] that's
[1:32:31] the stature of a perfect man
[1:32:35] matured
[1:32:37] amen and that's the message for the
[1:32:40] bride today while you lay in the
[1:32:42] presence of the sun you ripen amen
[1:32:46] Hallelujah
[1:32:48] don't put that as a seal you were sealed
[1:32:50] when you received the Holy Ghost inside
[1:32:51] of you and it come to dwelling in you
[1:32:53] and you knew it because the word became
[1:32:55] a living word to you and began to reveal
[1:32:57] itself to you
[1:32:59] you're growing who's growing he's
[1:33:01] growing
[1:33:05] Christ is growing it's not this man
[1:33:07] growing this man's getting old
[1:33:11] that word inside of me has never got any
[1:33:14] older
[1:33:15] it's an eternal life Resurrection what a
[1:33:18] resurrection that was and what a
[1:33:20] resurrection this is
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:25] amen
[1:33:27] all right so we find in verse 30
[1:33:30] 6 that we find then the half the sun
[1:33:32] this is what he's given you eternal life
[1:33:35] and this is the record eternal life he's
[1:33:37] given to you that record
[1:33:39] he's revealed that record
[1:33:41] there's no more fear
[1:33:43] all right 36 37 and I know that you're
[1:33:46] Abraham's seed natural seed talking to
[1:33:48] the Pharisees Sadducees you seek to kill
[1:33:50] me because my word hath no place in you
[1:33:59] well
[1:34:00] who do you say you are we believe Moses
[1:34:02] is messy well I mean brother rather's
[1:34:04] message
[1:34:08] but why are you seeking to don't play
[1:34:11] and and put a black check mark against
[1:34:14] the word that's reveal right in front of
[1:34:15] you
[1:34:17] in the bride form the revelations given
[1:34:21] because you are no place your by word
[1:34:23] has no place in you I'm not saying it's
[1:34:25] in this assembly but it's in the message
[1:34:27] around the message
[1:34:29] right it's the same thing it's repeated
[1:34:31] right back the devil didn't stay out
[1:34:33] there in denomination he just brought
[1:34:35] denominationalism right over here
[1:34:39] but without the Holy Ghost you'll never
[1:34:41] discern that spirit
[1:34:43] and it'll swallow you up
[1:34:46] because this devil will come along and
[1:34:48] say well you should love them I can't
[1:34:51] love that
[1:34:52] sorry I can't love unbelief
[1:34:56] I can love the unbeliever but I can't
[1:34:59] love unbelief
[1:35:00] so quit compromising with it
[1:35:03] and take your stand and separate
[1:35:05] yourself from it
[1:35:07] amen be ye separate saith the Lord amen
[1:35:11] and I'll receive you
[1:35:17] see the devil wants to come back all
[1:35:19] your feelings your feelings
[1:35:21] let go of your feelings
[1:35:24] what's the word say
[1:35:26] about you
[1:35:28] I don't know what it says they've been
[1:35:30] digging the open word then
[1:35:33] amen
[1:35:34] amen because this message speaks of you
[1:35:41] amen all right now
[1:35:44] I know
[1:35:45] some people don't like what's being said
[1:35:47] here this morning you think it's this
[1:35:48] old I'm just so tired I should go home
[1:35:52] I don't want to really be here anyway
[1:35:54] nobody loves me woe was me nobody shakes
[1:35:58] my hand
[1:36:02] you think I'm sorry for you
[1:36:07] no I'm not I'm sorry it's a Pity it's
[1:36:09] really a pity
[1:36:11] but there's somebody's going to receive
[1:36:13] the word
[1:36:15] and you don't realize what love is
[1:36:16] because love will give you the truth
[1:36:21] amen
[1:36:23] right that's exactly right
[1:36:25] and you can't have love you can't even
[1:36:27] know love until that word himself is
[1:36:30] living a living reality living in you
[1:36:33] abiding in you
[1:36:37] you don't know love
[1:36:39] you may have some ophelial friendship
[1:36:41] love that's okay I have that for my own
[1:36:43] wife but if that's not backed up by
[1:36:45] agape love
[1:36:47] it'll never come back to the right
[1:36:49] positioning of the word
[1:36:51] a wife won't truly love her husband and
[1:36:53] let him be the head and a husband will
[1:36:56] never know how to truly love his wife as
[1:36:58] Christ loved the church without God in
[1:37:00] them
[1:37:03] exactly right
[1:37:05] you just say what you want to say but
[1:37:06] that's the truth and I'm not ashamed to
[1:37:09] say that you say oh you hurt your
[1:37:10] feelings I'm sorry
[1:37:13] your feelings were hurt but I'm not
[1:37:16] ashamed to say it and if your feelings
[1:37:17] are hurt I'm sorry I'm not here to say
[1:37:19] it to your feelings I'm here to say it
[1:37:21] to your soul
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:28] amen
[1:37:29] and that's what we want that's what the
[1:37:31] bride wants
[1:37:33] now
[1:37:36] I'm not off of page one and I have eight
[1:37:41] a lot of it's been said
[1:37:43] but I'll just continue on here
[1:37:45] just until we can't go any further not
[1:37:47] to take it up again
[1:37:49] if the Lord allowed me to
[1:37:51] okay
[1:37:57] he said I speak that which I have seen
[1:37:59] with my father and you do that which you
[1:38:01] have seen with your father
[1:38:04] two natures
[1:38:06] to a different seed
[1:38:09] both religious
[1:38:10] one extremely religious more religious
[1:38:13] than Jesus was
[1:38:16] actually Jesus what we call religion he
[1:38:19] was life living the word living
[1:38:23] amen
[1:38:25] but we could go right down we could take
[1:38:27] verse 45 and because I tell you the
[1:38:30] truth you believe me not
[1:38:32] amen and he said 3 47 he that is of God
[1:38:36] heareth God's words
[1:38:38] you therefore hear them not because
[1:38:40] you're not of God now that's exactly
[1:38:42] first John 4 6.
[1:38:45] all right
[1:38:48] now he's standing in the midst of the
[1:38:50] church Revelation 3 14 said he's the
[1:38:52] beginning of the creation of God what's
[1:38:55] the message of our hour the beginning
[1:38:56] the amen the beginning of the creation
[1:38:58] of God

[1:39:44] calls himself the author of the creation
[1:39:45] of God this is another creation this has
[1:39:48] to do with the church this is a special
[1:39:50] designation of himself
[1:39:56] I can't spend all that time on those
[1:39:59] words I'd like to say some things about
[1:40:00] that but anyway I have already

[1:41:56] he said he is the creator or yeah no I'm
[1:42:00] sorry yeah it was a God man he was the
[1:42:03] son of God or God in son form he was of
[1:42:07] the new creation
[1:42:09] man and God met and joined
[1:42:13] he was the first of this this you can
[1:42:17] underline this today new race
[1:42:21] he is the head of this new race
[1:42:26] This Is Us now the opened word will take
[1:42:30] will take and is taking us to our body
[1:42:32] change in the meeting of our bridegroom
[1:42:34] in the air we are walking with God the
[1:42:36] seventh seal is is who we are is we are
[1:42:41] that seventh seal revealed
[1:42:45] all right
[1:42:47] now we see the what is the seventh
[1:42:49] completion completion of what himself
[1:42:53] what was Eve the complete revelation of
[1:42:55] Adam
[1:42:57] of God
[1:43:02] what's he got to do he's got to bring
[1:43:03] that back into manifestation again
[1:43:05] before we can step together into Eden
[1:43:09] do you see what I'm saying it's got to
[1:43:11] be there
[1:43:12] and that Revelation is what sets upon
[1:43:14] the people apart because they got the
[1:43:17] revelation of his coming
[1:43:20] they see Christ
[1:43:23] they don't see an organization some
[1:43:25] system of church they see Christ
[1:43:31] all right
[1:43:32] now he said now we see the Promise now
[1:43:36] he said we're walking with God he said
[1:43:38] now and I take paragraph 578 of the
[1:43:41] Church of the Christ the mystery of God
[1:43:42] revealed he's he's
[1:43:46] now brother Brown said now not will be
[1:43:48] now we see the Promise being fulfilled
[1:43:51] in other words we see the scriptures
[1:43:54] being fulfilled this day these
[1:43:57] scriptures this scripture of his promise
[1:43:59] of his return to take her to himself is
[1:44:03] become revealed this day this scripture
[1:44:06] is revealed
[1:44:07] revealed to who unveiled to who
[1:44:11] she had to have that in her to be opened
[1:44:16] you had to have it already
[1:44:21] I hope you see that
[1:44:23] now
[1:44:25] when now we see the Promise being
[1:44:27] fulfilled just like just like a promised
[1:44:30] son
[1:44:31] Sarah neighbor and and Abraham were to
[1:44:33] have a promised son
[1:44:37] it was a promise
[1:44:39] the seed was of the promise
[1:44:42] wasn't Isaac natural it was the seed of
[1:44:44] promise
[1:44:47] amen
[1:44:49] are you with me the natural typing the
[1:44:51] spiritual they were changed bodily we're
[1:44:53] changed spiritually for a body change
[1:44:56] we're taking that son to the change amen
[1:44:59] they took it she took it in herself had
[1:45:02] the seed of her own husband so do we
[1:45:05] and it was after that that the
[1:45:07] Revelation come to her and the
[1:45:09] Fulfillment of Faith the fulfilling and
[1:45:11] the manifestation brought her to a
[1:45:13] position where she could conceive
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:23] she had to grow into that position
[1:45:26] amen are you with me
[1:45:28] she was a young woman when she went down
[1:45:30] to abimelech she hadn't conceived seed
[1:45:32] yet
[1:45:35] is that right so now what are we seeing
[1:45:37] we're seeing we're seeing the promise
[1:45:40] being fulfilled
[1:45:42] Christ The Promise is Christ
[1:45:47] seed
[1:45:48] the promise is Christ the true headship
[1:45:51] going in
[1:45:54] now not going to be going in
[1:45:58] where are you going brother David where
[1:46:00] are you going where are you people
[1:46:01] marching to anyway
[1:46:03] in step with the word where are you
[1:46:06] marching
[1:46:07] home
[1:46:09] body change
[1:46:11] we're being caught up
[1:46:13] caught up caught up into Heavenly places
[1:46:16] now seated now in Heavenly places now
[1:46:19] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:46:21] Jesus now
[1:46:24] Christ in US
[1:46:26] defies who I am
[1:46:29] right I don't have any other
[1:46:30] identification anywhere else I know my
[1:46:32] name I can show my name in the scripture
[1:46:34] I can show who I am in the scripture I
[1:46:36] have it it's written of me I have the
[1:46:39] identification I have a photo
[1:46:41] identification
[1:46:43] open face beholding him in a glass the
[1:46:47] glory of the Lord
[1:46:49] brother bam said who did who do you see
[1:46:51] in that glass you see Jesus Christ he
[1:46:53] said and he says who is it you he said
[1:47:00] all right and it's now promises now
[1:47:03] being fulfilled he's going in who's he
[1:47:06] going in where's he going who's he and
[1:47:08] he is here now going in the revelation
[1:47:11] of Christ being here now all hell's
[1:47:13] against it going in the next statement
[1:47:16] coming in
[1:47:19] coming in well I thought it was supposed
[1:47:22] to be this way well forget your thinking
[1:47:24] that's what the Pharisees saw that's why
[1:47:25] they missed his coming
[1:47:30] they had it figured out another way
[1:47:33] they wouldn't receive the Vindicated
[1:47:35] manifested Vindicated message of their
[1:47:38] day they wouldn't receive a Vindicated
[1:47:40] message
[1:47:42] they had their own they had their own
[1:47:44] agenda I'll do my own thing
[1:47:47] well then my husband likes it or not
[1:47:48] I'll just do my own thing I know how to
[1:47:50] deceive him I had how to make him think
[1:47:51] he's this and this and this be careful
[1:47:53] that's no far off the truth
[1:47:57] what your motives and objectives are as
[1:48:00] you serve your husband you serve God
[1:48:05] and your husband's no more than a man
[1:48:07] like I am
[1:48:08] but he represents
[1:48:11] amen
[1:48:12] Christ to you
[1:48:15] and you represent Christ to her
[1:48:20] and he gave himself
[1:48:23] that doesn't mean to give to every
[1:48:24] little women have fear of whatever
[1:48:26] reaction when you ask her to do
[1:48:28] something and I will bless God I don't
[1:48:29] have to do it yes dear
[1:48:32] no that's not what we're talking about
[1:48:34] but holding in line with that word
[1:48:37] and in love giving yourself for the
[1:48:39] basis of the word
[1:48:41] and take headship over your house and
[1:48:43] start applying the token to your home
[1:48:48] yeah amen
[1:48:49] oh you see I'm walking with God then
[1:48:51] apply the token
[1:48:53] kick the trash out of your house kick
[1:48:55] those things that are denominational
[1:48:56] dominating female Spirits out of your
[1:48:58] house and forget about it don't go out
[1:49:00] there trying to do something that's not
[1:49:02] even in the word and using some
[1:49:03] intellectual conception of a man to do
[1:49:05] it
[1:49:07] yeah
[1:49:09] that's all you've got is intellectual
[1:49:10] conception that'll never put you in the
[1:49:12] rapture
[1:49:16] and it won't put anybody else in the
[1:49:18] rapture
[1:49:19] but we ought to be giving ourselves over
[1:49:21] Christ and you is eternal life living
[1:49:24] I didn't say just your life I said
[1:49:26] eternal life that spirit and word
[1:49:28] together living for others
[1:49:32] so how are you going to help somebody
[1:49:34] along give them the word
[1:49:41] amen give them no hour give them the
[1:49:43] message live the life
[1:49:45] that's what sets free
[1:49:48] not psychology
[1:49:51] all right now
[1:49:54] then the head and the body we see him
[1:49:57] going in we see him coming in his bride
[1:49:59] do we he's doing the same Works he did
[1:50:02] at the beginning and making ready making
[1:50:04] ready and fulfilling his word as he did
[1:50:07] at the first
[1:50:10] he said
[1:50:12] Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on me
[1:50:16] the works what were the works Believing
[1:50:18] on him whom God hath sent is to do the
[1:50:21] works of God
[1:50:23] he said the works of God brother sister
[1:50:25] brother Brown said don't you don't you
[1:50:27] con don't you let
[1:50:30] don't judge yourself by how much power
[1:50:32] you have to cast out devils
[1:50:38] we have the authority if that's only
[1:50:41] part of that you've got you need more
[1:50:42] than that
[1:50:44] because Judas cast out devils
[1:50:49] by the same anointing it's the it's God
[1:50:52] to cast out a devil we believe that
[1:50:55] right that's an authority but don't you
[1:50:57] take as the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:58] dwelling in you
[1:51:01] I've got scripture on it if I can ever
[1:51:03] get to it I say I have to take it in
[1:51:05] different parts here
[1:51:06] but you go over to Saint First
[1:51:08] Corinthians 12 7. brother Brown said I
[1:51:10] wish I could say that these gifts of the
[1:51:12] Spirit
[1:51:13] were the evidence of the Holy Ghost but
[1:51:15] I can't
[1:51:16] it is the Holy Ghost doing it but it's
[1:51:18] not the evidence
[1:51:22] amen
[1:51:23] I think we made it pretty clear this
[1:51:25] morning what the evidence is
[1:51:29] what the true belief is
[1:51:33] faith
[1:51:36] his
[1:51:38] amen
[1:51:39] his
[1:51:41] amen now let's go back here if I just go
[1:51:44] as far as I can what time is it okay I
[1:51:45] got a little bit of time
[1:51:49] that's all right you say Amen or not
[1:51:51] I know I do
[1:51:55] notice I'm smiling
[1:52:00] all right
[1:52:01] I'll get to a place where we can close
[1:52:05] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:52:07] do shall he do also why because he's
[1:52:09] risen in you then whose works is it is
[1:52:12] it David's works or his
[1:52:16] because I live
[1:52:18] you live also
[1:52:21] then it's Christ Living in you he does
[1:52:23] the works without that revelation
[1:52:27] you're just beating the wind
[1:52:29] because he that believeth in me the
[1:52:32] works that I do
[1:52:36] when were you believe in any before the
[1:52:38] foundation of the world how do you know
[1:52:40] you're a believer in him well I believe
[1:52:42] in Jesus Christ how do you know
[1:52:45] that he is
[1:52:47] because the Lord God has revealed it to
[1:52:50] you
[1:52:51] it's not a say-so it's a no-so
[1:52:55] The Works that I do shall he do also and
[1:52:58] the same one that did The Works
[1:52:59] yesterday comes in you
[1:53:01] and we'll do the works today
[1:53:04] Jesus said I can in myself do nothing
[1:53:09] but what I see the father do and he said
[1:53:11] this same Harmony will exist between the
[1:53:14] bride and his groom he reveals it to her
[1:53:16] and she speaks he reveals it to her and
[1:53:19] she does my father worketh hitherto
[1:53:21] means right at this time and then I work
[1:53:26] it's faith brother sister
[1:53:30] amen
[1:53:32] amen it's revelation
[1:53:38] this is what the just shall live by
[1:53:42] what's Faith takes its resting place in
[1:53:44] the word
[1:53:46] amen is that right man shall not live by
[1:53:48] every word but I mean by bread alone but
[1:53:50] by every word
[1:53:52] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:53:56] is that right
[1:53:57] all right
[1:53:59] okay now
[1:54:00] then the head and the body are becoming
[1:54:02] one
[1:54:04] unit
[1:54:06] brother man said the head and the body
[1:54:07] are becoming one unit
[1:54:09] they are no longer Twain They Are One
[1:54:12] how could he say that because the seal
[1:54:14] opened
[1:54:16] foreign
[1:54:17] amen I say the seal the seven sealed not
[1:54:22] six seven that's right
[1:54:24] that's right hello seven
[1:54:26] opened
[1:54:28] and it was the opening of the word
[1:54:30] that puts us in the rapture
[1:54:36] amen we raptured by the opening of the
[1:54:39] word all right now
[1:54:41] he said the head and the body are
[1:54:43] becoming one unit he said another place
[1:54:45] the head and the body are becoming one
[1:54:46] in Works in sign and in life
[1:54:51] Vindicated by God himself through what
[1:54:54] his promised word what's the attraction
[1:54:57] on the mountain
[1:54:59] the promised word
[1:55:01] fulfilled
[1:55:04] amen fulfill we turn the corner you say
[1:55:08] all you want well we didn't turn the
[1:55:09] corner I beg your pardon if he could say
[1:55:11] in 1956 that this United States turned a
[1:55:14] corner he said in 63 we turn to corner
[1:55:17] too
[1:55:19] amen because a message came forth that
[1:55:21] was hidden
[1:55:23] and he said this book this Bible's
[1:55:25] become brand new to me
[1:55:29] amen the the Cornerstone has now become
[1:55:32] the head of the corner
[1:55:34] and it's being united with the bride
[1:55:38] amen
[1:55:40] and we were pointed to the skies Behold
[1:55:42] the Lamb

[1:56:18] churches dressed as a woman
[1:56:22] hello
[1:56:24] perhaps gird about the golden girdle
[1:56:26] around the paps brother Brown said you
[1:56:28] want that quote I got we got it for you
[1:56:30] he said that's Christ that's the son of
[1:56:32] man dressed as a bride a woman
[1:56:35] in the midst of those Seven Ages
[1:56:42] what would it be at the end when the
[1:56:43] seed is now manifesting in
[1:56:46] some some are counted as shaft some are
[1:56:50] given life at the white Throne judgment

[1:57:04] when the seals open what do you say he
[1:57:06] was calling for his Queen wasn't calling
[1:57:09] for everybody else he was calling for
[1:57:11] his Queen to come sit by his side in her
[1:57:15] position take your position and the
[1:57:17] prophet said isn't it wonderful to see
[1:57:18] ourselves positionally placed
[1:57:21] in Christ Jesus
[1:57:27] a body has thou prepared me a position a
[1:57:30] place of worship where I'm worshiped
[1:57:33] there's your true worshipers I'll tell
[1:57:35] you right now there's no other true
[1:57:36] worshipers but the bride
[1:57:38] she's the only true worshiper there is
[1:57:41] the rest of them say we got the word we
[1:57:43] got the word we believe the word but to
[1:57:45] say Jesus Christ is takes the revelation
[1:57:48] of God in you
[1:57:51] you can't say he is is his present tense
[1:57:54] is is right now
[1:57:56] that's right he that believeth that
[1:57:58] Jesus Christ is the Son of God is born
[1:57:59] of God well not everybody says we
[1:58:02] believe Jesus Christ the son of God born
[1:58:03] of God but everybody that catches the
[1:58:05] revelation of the Christ in them
[1:58:09] knows that he is
[1:58:11] because it's himself revealed in you
[1:58:13] Upon This Rock
[1:58:15] and what did he say to Peter I say unto
[1:58:18] you Flesh and Blood didn't reveal to you
[1:58:20] but your father is in heaven and what
[1:58:22] happened and then what was what was that
[1:58:24] that Jesus recognized that the father
[1:58:27] did it was Peter's confession of
[1:58:31] Revelation
[1:58:35] it was revealed to him and he confessed
[1:58:38] the faith
[1:58:39] and brother and Jesus said that's the
[1:58:41] rock I'll build my church on
[1:58:44] I'll build it upon the revelation of
[1:58:46] myself
[1:58:48] there's where I'll build my church
[1:58:53] amen and if he built you on the
[1:58:56] revelation of himself who are you
[1:59:00] we're not building a wall we're building
[1:59:01] a building and it has corners and we've
[1:59:04] turned the final Corner we're heading
[1:59:05] home
[1:59:07] we're not even lay able to see it you'll
[1:59:09] see it can be going on all around you it

[1:59:43] buffeted by Leo Messiah but what's that
[1:59:45] got to do with the revelation of Who You
[1:59:48] Are
[1:59:51] right we've turned the corner
[1:59:55] we're looking at one person here
[1:59:59] our Lord up there Our Savior quickening
[2:00:02] power lets us see his coming going in
[2:00:06] coming in his pride amen

[2:00:20] you and then I got to close I'm only on

[2:01:43] soul by the desire that it is and I'm
[2:01:46] telling you and given you this morning a
[2:01:48] filter to draw through
[2:01:52] it's already been given to us
[2:01:54] filter all you need to do is sit down
[2:01:57] and start drinking and start eating of
[2:02:01] that open word don't let nobody else
[2:02:03] it's you as an individual whether this
[2:02:06] one makes it that one makes it if you
[2:02:07] don't love me more than mother father
[2:02:09] sister brother if I'm not the head
[2:02:12] and who am I
[2:02:14] he's not the tale
[2:02:17] this is absolute truth this is the truth
[2:02:20] this is the truth and he's given life to
[2:02:23] Quicken it and he's seeking out his own
[2:02:25] and seeketh such to worship him in that
[2:02:28] Spirit of himself and in truth
[2:02:33] and let that become one in you okay I've
[2:02:36] got I've got to close but I want to
[2:02:38] close on just one other thing here Lord
[2:02:40] just brought to my remembrance but I've
[2:02:42] turned me to First Corinthians 2. now
[2:02:44] watch what he said
[2:02:46] God's vindicating himself through his
[2:02:48] promised word can you give me about five
[2:02:49] minutes okay
[2:02:51] thank you
[2:02:59] then it says through his promised word
[2:03:01] for the last days vindicating himself
[2:03:03] brother Branham said who would vindicate
[2:03:05] himself to it's an individual
[2:03:07] he promised this in the last day he
[2:03:09] promised this in the last days I just
[2:03:11] read it to you now if you're spiritual
[2:03:16] look at these words what would make you
[2:03:18] spiritual
[2:03:20] well he's I've had it said to me over
[2:03:22] the years David is just too spiritual
[2:03:29] yeah leave me alone
[2:03:32] because if this bride isn't spiritual
[2:03:34] she's natural yeah
[2:03:37] if she's spiritual she's carnal she's
[2:03:40] not spiritual she's carnal I'm not
[2:03:41] talking about just any Spirit I'm not
[2:03:43] talking about just Spirits I'm talking
[2:03:45] about the holy spirit being spiritual
[2:03:47] it's he that is spiritual
[2:03:51] if he's in you makes you spiritual
[2:03:54] did you get that
[2:03:56] all right it's not you that's holy it's
[2:03:58] he that's holy in you makes you holy
[2:04:00] it's it's not David that's the word it's
[2:04:02] the word that's in me makes me the word
[2:04:06] amen makes me the Living Word
[2:04:10] if my life doesn't match up what I say
[2:04:14] what I live
[2:04:16] if I can't live this word I have no
[2:04:18] right to even be up here preaching it
[2:04:20] and if I can't live this word I don't
[2:04:22] have him
[2:04:25] and I can't make me live the word
[2:04:28] he lives it
[2:04:30] he said Brother David I can't live it
[2:04:33] that's a lie of the devil if I ever
[2:04:35] heard one no you can't live it you
[2:04:37] Misses so and so and Mr so and so out
[2:04:39] here cannot live it no it takes him to
[2:04:42] come in and live it right
[2:04:44] but if he put in you that Faith to
[2:04:46] accept what he said he would give you
[2:04:48] then take what he gives you and claim it
[2:04:50] as your own
[2:04:53] say God you can't deny this to me
[2:04:56] because my desire is for you
[2:05:00] amen and you said you would give it to
[2:05:02] me and I met your requirements I've
[2:05:04] repented I've been baptized in the name
[2:05:05] of Jesus Christ now you said you would
[2:05:07] fill me with yourself
[2:05:09] and I have that desire I've took you at
[2:05:11] your word I believe what the blood did
[2:05:13] and I openly confess what I believed by
[2:05:15] the blood
[2:05:17] that's baptism
[2:05:19] you've got to have a genuine repentance
[2:05:21] yes
[2:05:22] that's the problem with most repentance
[2:05:24] it's not genuine
[2:05:25] it's not a genuine repentance of faith
[2:05:30] amen amen is that right you don't really
[2:05:33] know what he did for us but when you do
[2:05:36] and you said he'd paid the price you may
[2:05:37] not know all of it but you know he died
[2:05:39] at Calvary to save you and he poured out
[2:05:42] his life for you and he made he took
[2:05:44] your place and by faith in that you take
[2:05:47] his name in baptism testify that you
[2:05:49] died with him and you Rose with him
[2:05:51] outwardly and that will work
[2:05:54] righteousness in your life and he will
[2:05:56] give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:58] which is the new birth
[2:06:02] because why because there's a seat
[2:06:04] calling out for water there's a seat
[2:06:06] calling up for life and there's only one
[2:06:08] thing that'll come through the genuine
[2:06:09] filter of the word that's the Holy Ghost
[2:06:11] and we'll Quicken that seed in you to
[2:06:13] manifest the resurrection of Jesus
[2:06:15] Christ right now here today
[2:06:22] praise the Lord
[2:06:23] I say praise the Lord anybody can praise
[2:06:26] him with me
[2:06:28] my
[2:06:33] oh you're getting a little bit too
[2:06:35] spiritual Brother David you gotta be
[2:06:36] careful here
[2:06:37] I can be a spiritual I I won't jump as
[2:06:40] high as I live I gotta I can jump as
[2:06:42] high as I live
[2:06:44] that's getting higher and higher all the
[2:06:46] time
[2:06:49] you just don't want to jump any higher
[2:06:50] than you live
[2:06:54] amen is that right
[2:06:56] amen
[2:06:57] amen all right
[2:07:00] brother Brown said don't watch what God
[2:07:02] in demonstration so much watch him in
[2:07:04] action what he does according to the
[2:07:08] word
[2:07:12] it's not a demonstration
[2:07:14] it says watch to emit action he said you
[2:07:17] wonder why I don't preach on the Holy
[2:07:18] Ghost so much which he has all the time
[2:07:19] but he said why because it's the Holy
[2:07:22] Ghost is an action in you
[2:07:24] it's the word living
[2:07:27] you recognize the word and now he puts
[2:07:29] it in your hands and said what's your
[2:07:30] decision right
[2:07:36] right okay First Corinthians I've tried
[2:07:38] to get back to that several times okay
[2:07:40] First Corinthians 2 14 for our ten but
[2:07:44] God hath revealed them to us by his
[2:07:46] spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[2:07:48] things yea the Deep things of God and
[2:07:50] what man knoweth the things of man
[2:07:52] saving the spirit of man which is in him
[2:07:53] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[2:07:56] but the spirit of God
[2:07:59] how are you going to know the things of
[2:08:00] God except the spirit of God Lives in
[2:08:02] You
[2:08:03] okay
[2:08:04] now see how how clear the evidence
[2:08:06] becomes see he said for what man knoweth
[2:08:10] excuse me verse 12. now we receive not
[2:08:13] the spirit of the world but the spirit
[2:08:15] which is of god that we might know the
[2:08:18] things that are freely given to us of
[2:08:19] God which things also we speak hello
[2:08:24] not in The Words which means what are
[2:08:26] you speaking Faith Revelation he said
[2:08:29] not which which things also we speak not
[2:08:32] in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[2:08:34] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth he's
[2:08:36] an inside teacher I just read to you
[2:08:39] Psalm 32 8.
[2:08:43] I will instruct I will teach I will lead
[2:08:46] you in dull truth I will guide you by my
[2:08:48] eye I'll Quicken the word I'll show you
[2:08:51] how to go
[2:08:53] who wouldn't want to depend on him
[2:08:56] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not be
[2:08:58] lacking of anything
[2:09:01] though I walk through the valley of the
[2:09:02] shadow of death I walk in the light what
[2:09:04] do I have to fear the shadow for
[2:09:09] God oh I don't know if I don't if I
[2:09:11] don't do these things just right try to
[2:09:13] figure it out and Bill I'm just so
[2:09:14] afraid
[2:09:16] what are you fearing the shadow for
[2:09:22] hello
[2:09:25] who's your absolute The Shadow
[2:09:28] or the message
[2:09:30] God is light
[2:09:34] walk in the light the beautiful light
[2:09:37] the light has come unto you the glory of
[2:09:39] the Lord has risen upon you
[2:09:42] what do you mean Brother David the glory
[2:09:43] of the Lord has risen upon me he said he
[2:09:45] wouldn't share his glory with another he
[2:09:47] isn't he's sharing it with himself
[2:09:49] you're himself
[2:09:51] you are his glory
[2:09:55] in fact Jesus said May the glory that is
[2:09:58] that is upon me may it be upon them
[2:10:01] the glory which is seen to meet Saint
[2:10:03] John 17 may it be on them
[2:10:05] and the woman is the glory of the
[2:10:07] husband
[2:10:11] oh my don't live beneath your privileges
[2:10:14] brother
[2:10:15] rise up and forget what the devil's
[2:10:17] trying to reason with you don't accept
[2:10:19] his knowledge of a con intellectual
[2:10:21] conception this has got to be revealed
[2:10:25] you have a right to ask for did not he
[2:10:27] say ask for it yeah
[2:10:29] ask if you need Wisdom ask for Godly
[2:10:32] Wisdom ask for revelation
[2:10:37] I'll give it to you
[2:10:40] ask and I'll show it to you
[2:10:43] we have not because we
[2:10:46] ask not
[2:10:50] ask in faith nothing can stop amen all
[2:10:53] right so he said now
[2:10:56] which things we speak not in The Words
[2:10:58] which man's Wisdom teaches but with God
[2:10:59] Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual
[2:11:01] things with spiritual
[2:11:03] not trying to put mixed natural and
[2:11:05] spiritual together you don't mix natural
[2:11:06] and spiritual together spiritual things
[2:11:09] confirm spiritual things the word amen
[2:11:12] all right then he said but the natural
[2:11:15] man receiveth not the things of the
[2:11:17] spirit of God there it is
[2:11:19] not an intellectual conception not a
[2:11:21] study not made up study study study
[2:11:24] study it's not study that gives it to
[2:11:26] you
[2:11:29] amen all right it's feeding
[2:11:34] it's receiving
[2:11:36] it's drinking
[2:11:39] I tried to figure it out
[2:11:43] but the natural man receiveth not the
[2:11:45] spirit of God and they are foolishness
[2:11:46] unto him neither can he know them know
[2:11:48] them know them because they are
[2:11:51] spiritually spiritually
[2:11:54] discerned
[2:11:56] but he that is spiritual that's your
[2:11:58] bride that's Jesus Christ one that's
[2:12:01] spiritual
[2:12:02] and what are you saying Brother David we
[2:12:04] are saying that this spiritual
[2:12:06] Supernatural virgin birth of the Bride
[2:12:08] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:12:10] and forever
[2:12:12] she is him
[2:12:14] just amorphy another form
[2:12:19] to a mask a drama this is a drama today
[2:12:21] what is the promised word for the day
[2:12:24] it's now being fulfilled
[2:12:25] what is it Christ's coming in you
[2:12:31] boy that's good that's rich that's
[2:12:34] lovely that's yummy don't need any don't
[2:12:37] need any dressing on top of that
[2:12:43] that's the truth
[2:12:45] all right the truth for our day
[2:12:48] all right now
[2:12:50] and blessed are your eyes that they see
[2:12:52] and the things you hear
[2:12:54] for no man he said yet himself he said
[2:12:57] it's the spiritual judges all things
[2:12:59] discerns all things in other words he
[2:13:00] that is spiritual discerns all things
[2:13:02] yet he himself is judges of no man
[2:13:05] for who hath known the mind of the Lord
[2:13:07] that he may instruct him but we have the
[2:13:10] mind of Christ
[2:13:13] now there's a lot more that could be
[2:13:15] said on that and I'll just pick it up
[2:13:16] another time but let me go back here
[2:13:18] about something
[2:13:20] and brother Brown said this
[2:13:22] the new creation this
[2:13:24] eternal life word
[2:13:26] spoken word creation is what the bride
[2:13:28] is that's the new birth there's a spoken
[2:13:29] word creation
[2:13:32] no longer because of that no longer is
[2:13:35] he dealing by ways of the flesh
[2:13:37] brother Brown said
[2:13:39] no longer so quit looking at your
[2:13:41] mistakes and failures
[2:13:42] just make it right with the word
[2:13:44] amen
[2:13:47] you have the right
[2:13:51] you have the right to apply the blood
[2:13:54] amen you can apply the blood
[2:13:57] amen you have the blood you are the
[2:13:59] blood did you know you are the blood
[2:14:00] bride
[2:14:01] you are the blood by the spirit
[2:14:04] and you can apply the blood
[2:14:07] apply the token
[2:14:10] well that's a big statement
[2:14:12] amen that's walking with God though
[2:14:15] okay now
[2:14:18] he's the first of that creation you're
[2:14:20] another creation just like him he's the
[2:14:22] new race you are that race
[2:14:24] this he said is the true revelation of
[2:14:26] God that was his purpose Eternal purpose
[2:14:29] that's his heart purpose and this
[2:14:30] purpose took form through election
[2:14:33] seek as such to worship him that is why
[2:14:35] he looked down at the last stage when
[2:14:36] all would be over and see himself still
[2:14:38] in the midst of the church as the author
[2:14:40] of this new creation of God
[2:14:42] he saw himself in the midst of the
[2:14:44] church as the author of this new
[2:14:45] creation of God his Sovereign power
[2:14:48] brought it to pass by his own decree he
[2:14:50] elected the members of this new creation
[2:14:52] he predestinated them to adoption of
[2:14:54] children that's a maturity according to
[2:14:57] the good pleasure of his will by his
[2:15:00] omniscience and omnipotence he brought
[2:15:02] it to pass
[2:15:03] how else could he know he would be
[2:15:05] standing in the midst of the church
[2:15:06] receiving Glory from his brother if he
[2:15:08] did not make sure all things he knew and
[2:15:11] all things he worked out according to
[2:15:12] what he knew
[2:15:14] in order that his purpose and good
[2:15:17] pleasure be brought to pass now if you
[2:15:19] want to read that as Ephesians 2 11.
[2:15:22] Amen in whom also we have obtained an
[2:15:25] inheritance being predestinated
[2:15:27] according the purpose of him who worketh
[2:15:28] all things after the counsel of his own
[2:15:30] will he said Hallelujah aren't you glad
[2:15:32] you belonged to him
[2:15:34] now he that he that the Bible said and
[2:15:38] you shall know the truth how do you know
[2:15:39] the truth by you
[2:15:42] by Union with him
[2:15:44] that's how you know the truth you are
[2:15:46] his workmanship you're in Union with him
[2:15:48] see
[2:15:50] he that's a new creature has passed away
[2:15:53] all things have become new see
[2:15:55] If he if you're in Christ all right now
[2:15:58] so he's standing Among Us fertilizing
[2:16:01] himself okay I'm just getting down here
[2:16:03] I want to get to something
[2:16:04] hear the Bible the bride is the Living
[2:16:06] Word In Action she's Hebrews 4 12 the
[2:16:09] word living and operative
[2:16:11] all right
[2:16:13] then Enoch Walking with God just keep
[2:16:16] walking add a testimony you have a
[2:16:18] testimony
[2:16:21] and we could give you scriptures on on
[2:16:23] how do you say He is we can go to first
[2:16:26] John 4 15 first John 5 1.
[2:16:29] First Corinthians 12 3
[2:16:32] we believe that Jesus Christ is
[2:16:36] amen
[2:16:37] Isaiah 59 19 said when he when the when
[2:16:41] the pressure shall come on when the when
[2:16:44] the Satan shall come in like a flood
[2:16:48] he'll raise the standard against it you
[2:16:49] know what the prophet said about that he
[2:16:51] said are you one of them
[2:16:54] how many read that before
[2:16:56] okay are you one of them Isaiah 59 19
[2:16:59] you'll raise the standard are you one of
[2:17:01] them are you the standard
[2:17:04] what is the standard the revealing of
[2:17:06] the word the revealing of the word
[2:17:08] you're a little there a little
[2:17:10] more and more more and more Revelation
[2:17:13] upon top of Revelation upon Revelation
[2:17:15] upon revelation
[2:17:17] all right are you the standard are you
[2:17:19] one of them
[2:17:21] see resisting what do you have to do
[2:17:24] first to resist him
[2:17:25] resistance is in two parts did you know
[2:17:28] that James 4 you know resistance is in
[2:17:30] two parts first what's the Bible say
[2:17:33] submit yourself to him
[2:17:37] submit yourself to God
[2:17:39] then what's it say and resist then
[2:17:41] resist the devil
[2:17:45] yo okay I'll read it
[2:17:48] okay James
[2:17:50] 4.
[2:17:52] verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to
[2:17:55] God
[2:17:56] period
[2:17:58] who is he he's the word
[2:18:00] so you submit yourself to the word how
[2:18:03] do you resist the devil it's written
[2:18:06] okay turn him down turn him down with
[2:18:09] what the word submit yourself to the
[2:18:11] word to God then the Bible says and then
[2:18:13] the in the same verse resist the devil
[2:18:16] and he will flee from you
[2:18:20] amen somebody seems to forget about that
[2:18:24] submitting yourself to God they just try
[2:18:25] to resist the devil you wonder why he
[2:18:27] doesn't go anywhere
[2:18:30] because you resist him
[2:18:32] by the word
[2:18:33] how did Jesus resist him
[2:18:36] it is written
[2:18:38] he was given himself completely to God
[2:18:40] and then resisted the devil
[2:18:44] okay now I'm just running over this
[2:18:48] I met talked about Matthew 16 confession
[2:18:50] Peter's confession
[2:18:52] what's your confession
[2:18:54] amen when you confess it see you confess
[2:18:57] the revelation
[2:18:59] confession of faith
[2:19:01] amen

[2:19:05] kingdom of God is within you
[2:19:07] the kingdom we are not a denomination we
[2:19:09] belong to a kingdom and the kingdom of
[2:19:11] is the word of God made Spirit listen
[2:19:13] and life in your own life

[2:19:20] in you
[2:19:23] there
[2:19:25] is the true worshiper
[2:19:28] all right now and the word of God is one
[2:19:31] in this church today
[2:19:33] in that day it was the word in God one
[2:19:35] and today it's the word in God word and
[2:19:37] God is one in his church today making it
[2:19:41] the headship of the body that is
[2:19:43] redeemed to bring the message who's
[2:19:45] redeemed the bride is the redeemed to
[2:19:47] make bring the message in the last day
[2:19:50] the voice and be taken up from the dead
[2:19:52] in the resurrection

[2:19:56] Eve in the beginning in the garden the
[2:19:58] threefold mystery of God his body
[2:20:03] all right
[2:20:05] now we could read 14 Jesus said if you
[2:20:08] see me you've seen the father
[2:20:10] all right
[2:20:11] brother Brandon said a woman come to him
[2:20:13] and said why I can't I catch it brother
[2:20:14] Branham he said you and your wife are
[2:20:17] one just a minute brother Madam you and
[2:20:19] your wife were one
[2:20:21] and and because Philip well you know
[2:20:23] what
[2:20:25] let me just say this I'm not going to go
[2:20:26] into that because it takes too much
[2:20:30] I'll come I'll bring it to another time
[2:20:32] but he said do you see my wife no do you
[2:20:34] see me yes that's not what Jesus said
[2:20:37] when you see me you've seen the father
[2:20:40] so that is the Oneness is a different
[2:20:43] kind he said when you see me you've seen
[2:20:45] the father when you see the bride
[2:20:49] you see him when you see him
[2:20:53] you see the bride
[2:20:57] who are you seeing when you see him
[2:20:59] you're seeing the father
[2:21:02] who are the people seeing when they see
[2:21:04] you
[2:21:06] as the revelation of the hour
[2:21:08] they're seeing
[2:21:10] your salvation your father
[2:21:13] you're so your savior
[2:21:17] exactly same thing all right now
[2:21:21] so that's Saint John 14.
[2:21:24] it's a little wheel in the middle of the
[2:21:26] wheel I'm getting down to something I've
[2:21:27] got to get to before we leave
[2:21:32] okay
[2:21:34] now remember what brother Brown said and
[2:21:35] the message
[2:21:38] I can't read all this to you because it
[2:21:40] takes too much
[2:21:41] but on the message it is the rising of
[2:21:43] the sun he talked about Dynamics and
[2:21:45] mechanics
[2:21:47] okay he said you can have everything
[2:21:50] that Cadillac brand new seats out of
[2:21:53] dough skin soft leather soft and easy to
[2:21:55] set in leather and floorboards and plush
[2:21:57] and steering wheel nickel plated and
[2:21:59] diamond studs all over it and the were
[2:22:01] and the engine was mechanically tested
[2:22:03] be exactly in the right engine and the
[2:22:05] wheels and all the bed bearings greased
[2:22:07] up and the tires were puncture proof and
[2:22:09] blowout free and all have been tested
[2:22:10] scientifically or theologically or
[2:22:15] seminarily
[2:22:18] oh we got the word yeah the word oh oh
[2:22:20] the word's perfect yeah
[2:22:23] it is
[2:22:24] it is we acknowledge that is yeah
[2:22:29] but without the spark
[2:22:33] and look at what he said
[2:22:35] they had been pushed off the assembly
[2:22:37] line both of them both of them filled up
[2:22:38] with gasoline
[2:22:42] you know gasoline is a part of the
[2:22:43] mechanics
[2:22:49] it's the word
[2:22:50] but the brand makes it very clear the
[2:22:52] gasoline was the word the whole thing
[2:22:53] was the word but the gas is part of it
[2:22:55] fill it up with gas
[2:22:57] unless there's a spark there to manifest
[2:22:59] that power unless there's a power there
[2:23:02] to confirm that it's gasoline it might
[2:23:04] as well be water
[2:23:07] right all right now
[2:23:09] I'm not finished with it yet you say
[2:23:11] yeah about that all right brother I
[2:23:12] believe the spirit of God yes sir that's
[2:23:15] right and I do too
[2:23:18] we're both anointed
[2:23:19] the wheat and the seed are both Anointed
[2:23:21] with the same anointing
[2:23:23] no question about the Holy Ghost
[2:23:26] amen no question that's why you better
[2:23:28] be careful what you speak about the Holy
[2:23:30] Ghost
[2:23:31] because it can be on a weed don't you
[2:23:34] say nothing about that anointing
[2:23:36] and it can be absolutely the truth
[2:23:39] but they themselves are not the word and
[2:23:41] they're lost yet having the anointing
[2:23:47] you don't think that's the truth you
[2:23:48] need to go back and read annoyed once
[2:23:50] the end time and others that follow that
[2:23:52] yeah
[2:23:54] okay
[2:23:55] now he said we have put too much stress
[2:23:58] on the mechanics
[2:24:00] without the spirit it won't move it's
[2:24:02] the truth the word is the truth see see
[2:24:05] you how well you got your church set how
[2:24:07] much education you got how much Bible
[2:24:09] you uh Bible until that wave sheath
[2:24:12] until that Holy Ghost comes upon that
[2:24:13] person to make that word live the
[2:24:16] gasoline represents a word it's the
[2:24:17] truth but without the spirit it won't
[2:24:19] move
[2:24:21] okay I think we we have too much we put
[2:24:23] too much stress in the mechanics and
[2:24:24] nothing on Dynamics it needs the dynamic
[2:24:27] power of God the resurrection power of
[2:24:29] Jesus Christ in the church to manifest
[2:24:31] and bring to pass that that's gasoline
[2:24:33] it might be in a gasoline can it could
[2:24:35] be still be water see but the only proof
[2:24:37] is it put the life on it it'll prove
[2:24:39] whether it's gasoline or not and when
[2:24:41] you try to put the holy spirit in a
[2:24:43] denomination or in a old skin
[2:24:48] amen old bottle then it's going to burst
[2:24:51] the bottle see see
[2:24:54] as much as you are trying you can get a
[2:24:56] splutter you'll ruin your engine by
[2:24:57] getting it full of carbon
[2:24:59] now I said oh I'm glad there's a ten
[2:25:01] thousand power octane power the word of
[2:25:03] God and the Holy Ghost to light it up
[2:25:07] spirit and Truth the resurrection
[2:25:09] resurrect the power of God into a man's
[2:25:11] life or woman's life you know or into a
[2:25:13] church that shoved that catalyte down
[2:25:15] the Cadillac down the road Yonder with a
[2:25:17] dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which
[2:25:19] came back and was waved over the people
[2:25:21] the day of Pentecost making him the same
[2:25:22] yesterday today and forever
[2:25:25] but there has got to come now remember
[2:25:27] Pentecost is not
[2:25:30] I'm not talking about Pentecostal
[2:25:31] denomination here
[2:25:36] I'm talking about the Pentecostal
[2:25:37] experience
[2:25:39] you've got to have that
[2:25:40] but you don't go back and still trying
[2:25:42] to get it you've got it you just need to
[2:25:44] start feeding on the word promise that
[2:25:46] came beyond that
[2:25:48] amen into the seed itself
[2:25:53] the ends when you conceive
[2:25:56] all right now
[2:25:59] he said but now watch now you say well
[2:26:01] that's good Hallelujah I got the Holy
[2:26:02] Spirit that's good that's good
[2:26:04] brother Brown said
[2:26:07] he said now
[2:26:08] it was waived over the people okay it's
[2:26:10] been waived over us again today you know
[2:26:12] that I can't I don't have time to read
[2:26:13] all the rising of the Sun but there's
[2:26:15] got to come one there has to come a real
[2:26:17] bride
[2:26:18] there must come one brother Brown
[2:26:20] remember that messenger pointed to the
[2:26:22] point of the people to a word-born bride
[2:26:25] why because it was the promised word for
[2:26:27] this hour
[2:26:29] foreign
[2:26:31] then he pointed that bride what how did
[2:26:33] it happen because he pointed the bride
[2:26:35] remember it's word born he pointed the
[2:26:37] bride to the said there's the lamb
[2:26:39] John was on Earth at the time of his
[2:26:42] coming
[2:26:43] what about this messenger
[2:26:45] he also is on Earth that time is coming
[2:26:47] and said I've I've introduced you to him
[2:26:51] I must decrease he must increase say
[2:26:54] well brother Dave what's the Turning of
[2:26:55] the corner it turned from his Prophecy
[2:26:57] from the prophet excuse me to his
[2:26:59] prophecy
[2:27:01] foreign
[2:27:03] so we are his prophecy
[2:27:06] manifested
[2:27:09] amen now he said now he said
[2:27:12] one that one then this bride has not
[2:27:15] only the mechanics but the Dynamics of
[2:27:16] it makes that church live and move in
[2:27:18] the power of the Resurrection until we
[2:27:20] come to that place until we find that
[2:27:22] place what good does it do to polish the
[2:27:25] hubs what good does it do to have her a
[2:27:27] facelift or a simonized job when there's
[2:27:29] no Dynamic Senate no matter how much
[2:27:31] mechanics prove to be right there's got
[2:27:33] to be Dynamics to make it work
[2:27:41] okay I'm coming to something I'm closing
[2:27:45] okay
[2:27:46] I didn't say I'm closing this right now
[2:27:48] but I'm closing
[2:27:50] I know I'm way over time excuse me but I
[2:27:53] only have about every well I won't go
[2:27:54] there okay
[2:27:58] If he if he wasn't only the word but he
[2:28:01] was God himself the Dynamics in the word
[2:28:05] that made the body of Jesus Christ
[2:28:07] stiff cold stiff and dead in the grave
[2:28:09] shaken to life and rise again because I
[2:28:11] live you live also and do it take away
[2:28:14] the stone I am he that was dead so dead
[2:28:17] the son said good dead the moon said he
[2:28:18] was dead the star said his dead all
[2:28:20] nature said he was dead and now the
[2:28:21] whole world has to recognize he's alive
[2:28:23] again he was only the he was only he not
[2:28:27] only the mechanics God's word he was a
[2:28:29] Dynamics to prove it so is the bride not
[2:28:32] only is she the mechanics of God's word
[2:28:34] but she is the Dynamics to prove it
[2:28:37] okay now watch I'm coming down here now
[2:28:41] be ready
[2:28:44] and he being the groom the bride has to
[2:28:46] come forth It's a part of him
[2:28:49] it can only be the manifestation of the
[2:28:51] fulfilling of revelation of all others
[2:28:54] that spoke of the Bride she could be
[2:28:55] only the manifestation it can only
[2:28:57] manifest if it does something different
[2:28:59] from the groom it isn't the bride
[2:29:03] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[2:29:05] of his bone life of his life power is
[2:29:08] power she is him
[2:29:10] as men and women are one and woman taken
[2:29:12] the from his side she had taken the
[2:29:14] spirit not another Spirit his spirit
[2:29:17] from him a flesh from his side made her
[2:29:20] both mechanics and Dynamics
[2:29:23] the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh
[2:29:26] of him and put it together put it
[2:29:28] together made mechanics and Dynamics now
[2:29:31] watch this until that church becomes
[2:29:33] both Dynamics and mechanics
[2:29:37] and the spirit of God that moved him to
[2:29:39] do the things that he did if he hit on
[2:29:41] 16 cylinders so will the bride amen John
[2:29:44] he said if
[2:29:46] said I'll give him a charge of my
[2:29:48] Dynamics in this mechanics and the world
[2:29:50] will not be able to withstand it I'll
[2:29:52] raise him up again in the last day now
[2:29:54] watch
[2:29:55] that's the Easter message the Dynamics
[2:29:58] and mechanics together
[2:30:01] watch what he said right here you say
[2:30:03] yeah brother David we have to have the
[2:30:05] spirit on the word but you can have the
[2:30:07] spirit and not the word also
[2:30:13] okay watch what he says the mechanics
[2:30:15] without the Dynamics
[2:30:17] no good
[2:30:20] neither is the Dynamics without the
[2:30:23] mechanics
[2:30:25] no good
[2:30:28] okay
[2:30:30] I'm closing
[2:30:32] he said you can scream and shout and
[2:30:34] jump up and down all you want to and
[2:30:36] deny this word it won't do any good
[2:30:38] you're just cranking around the Pistons
[2:30:40] are just cranking
[2:30:42] got the spirit there but no gasoline to
[2:30:45] fire it off
[2:30:47] you see what he just said you've got the
[2:30:49] spark
[2:30:51] brother said now that was Pentecost they
[2:30:53] had the spark the Baptist had the word
[2:30:55] but if you ever get the two together
[2:30:57] is that what he said okay he said a bit
[2:31:00] if you can have the spark you can have
[2:31:02] the gasoline but no fire but you can
[2:31:04] have the fire
[2:31:06] and no gas
[2:31:09] you if you have the fire but if the
[2:31:11] gasoline isn't there Nothing's Gonna
[2:31:13] fire off
[2:31:18] now
[2:31:20] you see how it balanced
[2:31:22] you're not over balancing it over here
[2:31:24] you're taking both the word without the
[2:31:26] Dynamics no good
[2:31:28] and the Dynamics without the word no
[2:31:30] good
[2:31:32] now you see what he's seeking himself
[2:31:36] to live
[2:31:37] it's himself that he quickens
[2:31:41] okay
[2:31:42] now
[2:31:48] all right it'll only work as they come
[2:31:50] together
[2:31:52] so one will set still and the other one
[2:31:54] will go up
[2:31:56] right now even
[2:31:57] one setting still the others in Heavenly
[2:32:00] places
[2:32:01] one's going to set still and the other
[2:32:03] will be changed and the body changed and
[2:32:05] still be the other left here you see
[2:32:06] what I mean
[2:32:07] that's what he's saying okay because if
[2:32:11] the spirit that raised Jesus from the
[2:32:12] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[2:32:14] Christ shall also Quicken your mortal
[2:32:17] Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[2:32:20] Jesus the word all right if Jesus the
[2:32:24] word was raised from the dead if that
[2:32:26] spirit's in you now what brother Brown
[2:32:28] say not only will he take you out of the
[2:32:30] grave and Quicken your body then but he
[2:32:32] said now he said it'll bring your body
[2:32:35] mortal flesh subject to his word if that
[2:32:40] word and Spirit Come Together he's going
[2:32:41] to bring your body subject to that word
[2:32:44] now
[2:32:46] right
[2:32:47] amen
[2:32:48] that's Romans 8 11.
[2:32:53] I'm thankful for your patience just
[2:32:54] listen
[2:32:56] and I'm closing I am really truly
[2:33:00] oh you say brother Branham
[2:33:02] false prophets the Bible said in the
[2:33:04] last days there'd be false prophets
[2:33:06] Jesus said be false Christ okay I want
[2:33:09] to go here
[2:33:16] um
[2:33:18] yeah I'm sorry yeah this is in the
[2:33:21] message this is in the message
[2:33:26] uh leadership
[2:33:27] 1965 first one
[2:33:29] next to the last communion was the last
[2:33:31] message all right
[2:33:33] he said they cannot stand chastisement
[2:33:36] our bastard David cannot stand
[2:33:38] chastisement or bastard children why
[2:33:40] don't you stand with me and I'll just
[2:33:42] I'll let me finish right here they
[2:33:44] cannot stand chastise they that cannot
[2:33:46] stand correction or chastisement are
[2:33:49] bastard children remember those that he
[2:33:51] loves he corrects but you that can't
[2:33:54] stand that correction are bastard
[2:33:56] children and not the children of God
[2:33:58] seed
[2:33:59] see they are worked up on the emotion
[2:34:03] see the seed that I talked about a while
[2:34:05] ago
[2:34:06] that Soul watch what he says now listen
[2:34:09] carefully I know it's at the end but
[2:34:11] listen the seed that I talked about a
[2:34:13] while ago that Soul wasn't there to
[2:34:16] start with
[2:34:18] it was anointed with the spirit
[2:34:21] now watch what he's saying what was
[2:34:23] anointed he done all kinds of of signs
[2:34:26] or you say and then he stops he says
[2:34:29] when your spirit's anointed
[2:34:32] he said and it's the real genuine Holy
[2:34:35] Spirit now there's many other quotes on
[2:34:37] this
[2:34:37] where brother Brown said your spirit can
[2:34:39] be Anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit
[2:34:42] but that soul is not the seed
[2:34:45] okay he said he said now he said when
[2:34:49] your spirit little s Spirits anointed he
[2:34:53] said it's a real genuine Holy Ghost and
[2:34:56] you could still be a devil
[2:35:00] see I'm bringing this to the climax
[2:35:02] where these two have to come together
[2:35:05] okay if you don't see that in your life
[2:35:07] you're missing something
[2:35:10] you're missing one to the other
[2:35:13] amen I believe the word I believe the
[2:35:16] word
[2:35:17] and be genuinely a a fundamental
[2:35:21] believer
[2:35:24] like Balaam
[2:35:27] and Anointed with the spirit
[2:35:30] genuine holy ghost in your spirit can
[2:35:33] miss the truth
[2:35:34] and you can have the spirit in your
[2:35:37] spirit and not have any word
[2:35:40] no word at all
[2:35:42] and prophesy and cast out devils and
[2:35:44] shout and dance and and just as
[2:35:46] religious as you can be in all the kinds
[2:35:48] of emotions and actions but no
[2:35:50] revelation of the word
[2:35:52] for the season
[2:35:54] can't see your position
[2:35:57] amen now
[2:35:59] false prophets in the last days will be
[2:36:01] see he's false prophets the Bible said
[2:36:03] in the last days there'd be false
[2:36:05] prophets Jesus said there'd be false
[2:36:07] Christ now what do you mean by false
[2:36:09] Christ false
[2:36:10] they're Anointed with the genuine Holy
[2:36:12] Ghost but their faults on the inside
[2:36:16] okay false teachers false Christ not
[2:36:19] false jesuses
[2:36:21] would say I I'm anointed I'm anointed no
[2:36:25] question about being the anointing but
[2:36:26] we know you're not Jesus you can't say
[2:36:28] I'm Jesus
[2:36:29] because that was the very Temple
[2:36:32] are you with me yeah all right now not
[2:36:35] false jesuses
[2:36:37] now nobody stands still for that false
[2:36:39] Christ means the anointed one
[2:36:42] anointed ones excuse me once plural
[2:36:45] he said they are anointed but they are
[2:36:47] false at the bottom of it
[2:36:50] and do great signs and wonders speak in
[2:36:52] tongues that's the spirit preach the
[2:36:53] gospel Judas Iscariot did it caiaphasis
[2:36:56] prophesied Balaam the hypocrite done
[2:36:58] signs
[2:37:00] prophesied it was true star shall rise
[2:37:02] out of Jacob yep see see everything all
[2:37:06] the religious moves but you see but see
[2:37:09] you put a kuckleberry seed in a wheat
[2:37:11] seed in the same bed and pour water down
[2:37:13] on them and anoint them they'll both
[2:37:15] rejoice
[2:37:16] they'll both grow and brother sister
[2:37:18] don't you even think for a minute I
[2:37:19] don't believe in dancing and shouting I
[2:37:21] don't but you better have the word there
[2:37:26] amen that's all you want shout as the
[2:37:29] holy spirit moves on to shouting I
[2:37:30] believe you'll amen you don't have to
[2:37:32] pump you up to say Amen we don't have to
[2:37:33] pump you up pump you up
[2:37:40] I'm going to pump you up to get you to
[2:37:41] shout we have to pump you up to say Amen
[2:37:43] we have to pump you up to get revelation
[2:37:45] if we do that we got Pentecostal
[2:37:47] denomination
[2:37:53] all right
[2:37:55] The Sun Shines on the just the unjust
[2:37:58] and the rain falls under just the unjust
