for a moment and i asked jay what is the songs you're singing tonight he says i'm not going to let you see because you're going to tell me hot that's what i'm preaching on well whether i saw him or not we've talked about we and we've talked about manifested with oh anyway i'll just preach it to you amen good to be here tonight hallelujah love the lord thank him for his grace and mercy amen let's just stand as we go into the word it's been actually almost exactly a month since i speak i spoke the first part of we are witnesses but uh just uh in reading my bible my daily readings i just um you know come across these scripture and it just stirred my heart made me so happy i got to thinking as i as i read this what a personal gospel this is not an impersonal blanket that's been just thrown over the people and but this has become a personal gospel and people might say no now we we question this and we question that and you know if we didn't have anything but a universal understanding we might stop and say oh yeah okay but when it's personal and someone says there's no power in this message and you're like this changed my life people say well we wonder if god's still a healer and you're standing there saying he healed me and people say well you know i've just been bothered by spirits my whole life and you're there god's delivered me a personal gospel how beautiful that is that god didn't say i'm just gonna throw out something kind of with lots of little voids and little holes and you're gonna have to surmise and you're gonna have to try and put this together but he said no i'm gonna create a personal message let's turn in our bibles this morning this evening tonight i'll get on the right page first john the first chapter now as we're looking at these scriptures saints i i hope you don't mind i'm kind of happy in my heart today i've got to sit on a tractor all day and there's not much better than that for a job and um you know you look at this and and uh there's a whole bunch more verses that were there and i was like hallelujah preach it all to him little voice says just give them a little bit because a little bit is sufficient so anyway i i cut the other half a dozen verses off and i trust that tonight this will speak to your heart first john 1 1 that which was from the beginning and feel free to say amen and oh my and whatever else that you feel like saying that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled not of silver not of gold not of other precious treasure but of the word of life no greater treasure on this earth and god has allowed us to handle it for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us so it's not saints still something that we're grasping out into the future and i say to those tonight if there's things that you look at and say i don't have an answer for you just keep praying our god is an on he is not leaving this as it were as a myth for us a vapor for us to just keep trying to grasp but he wants to make it a personal gospel stick to your words paul hallelujah for the life was manifested and we have seen it i love that and now to just add words in there because it is in a context we bear witness so it's no longer we look back and say the apostle paul was faithful john was faithful brother branham was faithful we are faithful and showing to you that eternal life which was with the father was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full heavenly father we ask you lord just to speak through your word to us tonight make this so real father we walk out tonight with the joy just bubbling up within us lord to realize how blessed we are in the day that we live father not lord just sitting here tonight with religion the father we're sitting here tonight with you and father the very spirit lord that you said you would pour out upon your people father has been poured out and we are the recipients and i say tonight thank you lord thank you father we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now i want to just take just a moment tonight and and just go down through this um and just kind of the things that reached out and spoke to my heart and i trust that they would now some of the songs that we sang tonight um you know yes i would be cherry-picking to say oh oh manifested was in this song and and we here and this here and but i'm telling you it did speak to my heart and i'll look at this as we go into the first verse that which was from the beginning which we have heard my brother and sister when we look at this we realize that the word that we are living in today and we are living in the word right it's not just in an age of the word we are living in the word and if we're not in the word saints then we need to stop and ponder what it is we are doing because we don't want to spend our time in this age just under an anointing of a cloak of religion many people live under the cloak of religion and they're comfortable there because there's not much sacrifice required to live under the cloak now remember if you do this and i'm sorry i kind of that my own studies have done this but my brother and sister there's a lot of a lot of stuff that goes back into the old roman catholic church and and i say the old roman is still prevalent here today but many times my brother and sister the symbolic side of it was that a priest you know living a life that they lived and you know what they did is they put on this cloak or this gown this robe or whatever you want to call it when they went to preach and symbolically it was covering them in the flesh so therefore they could come as a holy man to the people but you see i thank god in the hour we live in that he's come and the holy ghost is what is cloaking this flesh it is not some robe it is not some other thing but it is christ himself covering this flesh he says i have covered you with my blood amen and my own precious blood is sufficient that i think is a new niv but you look at that and realize the beauty of that my brother and sister not a garment that we put on with everything being a symbolism but the holy ghost takes all symbolism away and is reality amen and that's the life i like that's the life i want to live it's a life of reality amen so we have from the beginning now my brother and sister is i speak on these things i i talking uh talking with brother david for just a moment today uh he'll be ministering for you this coming sunday but uh my brother and sister look at the spirits of the day we have a cancel culture we have a woke culture we have all these cultures now i want you to take and not get too crazy about this but i want you to just take and ponder this and realize how each one of these things that's happening is symbolistic of what is happening in the bride i'm telling you as never before in our generation the bride is waking up she is woke amen she is coming to a reality of who she is and the fact that the word is the prophet of god says when you catch that revelation the bible will be a brand new book to you and i believe it's happening i know so many people that are like coming out of a fog coming out of a i don't know what you would say just a days as it were and getting sincere and talking with brothers and they're talking about hey there's people that were part of this church 25 years ago and they just walked in the door this last sunday and sat down and said i've been miserable for 25 years and i just have to turn my heart back to the lord and we're seeing an awakening taking place and we see a cancel culture my brother and sister where they're on all this social media stuff and maybe it has its place it just don't have a place in my life so much but you look at this and you see my brother and sister this cancel culture and satan is there saying these people are speaking truth cancel them but i'm telling you it's exactly the opposite it's the holy ghost coming down on this same bride that is waking up and she's cancelling satan's voice in her life she's saying that voice no longer has an influence it no longer has a place his behavior has no longer a place in my life and his spirit has no place in my life and there it is but satan comes verbalizes it vocalizes it blows it up and the world's all caught up in the canceled culture my brother and sister the bride is caught up in this canceled culture she is there saying i am finished with the voices of laodicea i'm finished with the spirit of laodicea and i'm going to move forward and serve the lord with all of my heart amen so you see as we look at this what was from the beginning was the original word and so all in the original word my brother and sister that is encapsulated if you would say in the original word has been manifested and has been given back to the bride of christ in our generation all put in order you might say pardon me for putting it this way but god even delivered it with a nice little ribbon around it you know who it came from the signature the card the words all are identified hallelujah i would sure hope that a young man courting a girl she wouldn't open a card and be like i wonder who this is from he's cute blue eyes blond hair curly he's this he's that you see courting is not a random affair are you with me it's serious business you ought to know who's courting you and who you're courting amen the lord jesus christ has been courting the bride of this age for centuries now would you participate with me tonight who has seen with their own eyes hallelujah we don't have to say now pastor is this true we've seen it with our own eyes which we've looked upon my brother and sister we are as the scripture says a chosen generation we're a special people we're the we're the apple of his eye and and he has come and revealed himself now understand the opening of the word is the revelation of jesus christ himself it is not just another religious deal this is why people say well why what is so important about the seventh seal being open my brother and sister that's his love letter to the bride in our day and we ought to know who wrote the love letter to us and we don't want it to be a church or some ministry or some person here we need to know who wrote that love letter to us and the seventh seal was the opening of the plan of redemption where he said i've come oh i hope you're with me i've come not just to redeem your soul but i've come to give you my name oh my brother and sister that that stirs my heart when he said i love you enough i'm going to give you my name hallelujah and our hands of handle of the word of life believe or not still the top-selling book in the world but how many read this book and it means almost nothing to them do you realize how special you are because you see the love letter that i wrote to jerry is universal in one sense she's got a box or two full of them i don't know this younger generation how they're going to store their love texts maybe maybe we'll have to have some courtship classes and remind the young men young women when you're serious about that boy or that girl that nothing replaces a pen and a paper yeah somewhere on a zip file i have all my love text god said i'm going to write it down you can handle it every single day in fact i actually want to commission you to pull it out every single day and read my love letter see how beautiful it is so if you need an example of why you should write a letter god started off writing a love letter to you and i hallelujah so you look at this and realize my brother and sister god loved us so much that he just let us lay our hands directly to the word of life and we can take that back into luther's day and people would say you know now where was luther out in all of this and he still smoked and drank beer and did whatever but my brother and sister you understand but part of the significance of what god did was god said i am going to use him to put this word into the letter form that every man could handle amen i've just knocked my mic off and it won't let go of my belt and i'm sorry but look at this how it is to be able to handle the word of life it should should be such a thrill to us to know that god loved us enough to literally lay this love letter right down into our hands that we could possess it hold it cry over it worship with it amen be strengthened encouraged and corrected how beautiful is that yes brother chris come help me i'm suffering from old men's eyes and i can't see and so you look at this now i in verse 2 i want to just hurry along for the life was manifested now my brother and sister i've had folks kind of get up to me you know and say well you you just overdo this manifested but my brother and sister i want you to think about this thank you brother chris i want you to think about this if we talk about how that there is a word of god for our day there is a life an opening of the word but if we can't really see the evidence of it how long before we get discouraged how long before we're hearing about a healer but we never see anyone healed we're hearing about a deliverance but there's never seemingly a deliverance see we as humans were designed in such a fashion that god said i know that you will need the evidence i know that you will need the tangible to be able as humans right this is not believer unbeliever this is humans and so we need to see god move in our midst and so when you see my brother and sister as it were in the world we're living in today and and being toned down toned down toned down to where you know we're a christian if we acknowledge there's a god but where's the other side see even that's a two-headed sword because if we don't accept the freedom it may as well be supposed to but we should be able to declare i have been set free the chains are broken amen see a very personal gospel hallelujah might not mean much to somebody who's lived a very tame life but it's a little homework go see what the scripture says about imaginations they never robbed the bank or threatened the life or done anything ridiculous outside there but the scripture looks at what our mind conjures we have to be able to take a hold of that and say mind as much as it seems difficult i am putting you under subjection to the word oh i can hear the birds fluttering now no problem we'll just keep swatting them away they're not going to make a nest see a personal gospel you say well my my mind goes this way another person say my mind goes this way but it doesn't matter god's in control for the life was manifested and we've never had an evidence of it and no no my brother and sister it's very evident in the day that we live in and if you'll be honest with yourself it's very evident in your life that you're not the same individual that you were in the past so all of this comes and what does it bring us to in the second verse is that god my brother and sister let me if you'll give me liberty with the word god said i didn't do all of this for you then to walk around under your little personal cloud of woe is me but i did all of this for you i opened your eyes i took you to walk in the light i've healed you i saved you i have given you peace i've done all of this now i have a requirement from you and that is that you'll stand up and bear witness you see the witness my brother and sister is very important because the case cannot be compelled without witnesses and whether the witness is true or false must be brought forth been amazing how that we can have god do so much in our life and i'm not chiding you church but i'm just saying god can do so much in our life and we can so carefully hide that that you can be healed and no one knows you can be delivered and no one knows you can have prayers answered and no one knows that's bearing witness but not it should be a vocal gospel that the world knows god healed me you don't have to give the gritty details go on answering a prayer about how i and pretty soon people are like look like they've been nuclear okay brother wonderful but you see if it's that person's experience it's that person's life he's thrilled that god's delivered him from a murdering spirit or whatever spirit it might be to him see so we have to have a little judgment but my brother and sister i tell you you get around the world and you get to talk to people and you'll find out that life's a little grittier under the surface than many of us experience the brother back east i've mentioned him here before heard the message in prison north carolina maximum maximum security prison for taking a man's life wow how can that be it's a personal gospel and god brought word truth life right down into the maximum maximum security placed it in his hand and he read it and said this is truth amen and then god i'm going to use the word manufactured his way out of prison god come and took it from life plus to we have seen such a change in you and your case has been brought before a parole board and they are going to release you now tell me my brother and sister does our god not want to make this personal it's not a blanket gospel he just threw out i want you to realize tonight that no matter what maybe the preaching of the word maybe brother paul preached something and it kind of went ouch with you and you look at that now look erase paul out of there now and put in there god cares enough about me to speak to these little things in my life that maybe aren't quite lining up it isn't paul it isn't paul come on because every list of faults i could prepare on you you could prepare one just as great greater on me it is not about that it's the personal gospel of jesus christ coming to you and i say i am leading you i am guiding you all the things i spoke in my word concerning you i will fulfill them and it must become personal i hope you catch that personal can be everything the way we do our hair uh the clothes we wear our language our attitudes and god will come and deal with that because he's a personal god can you imagine now off track just a little bit but these are thoughts that i deal with you show up to peter at the gates and peter says hey you know you've got everything else right and i feel really bad i feel really really bad because i wanted to talk to you about your attitude but i was afraid i would offend you and um anyway because of your attitude i can't let you in did i make my point you would say lord or peter whatever why didn't somebody deal with my attitude i would have changed my attitude but it never got dealt with see that would be an unjust god wouldn't an unjust god but our god's not just but he's also a god that doesn't have excuses amen see we bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was the father was manifested unto us in other words my brother and sister taken in the right context it was manifested unto us it was actually deposited in you and i it wasn't just an example put on the wall that you can read that and hopefully you'll understand and hope you'll do that but god manifested this life by depositing it right into you and i amen it's not a surface thing it is something deep down within our soul now look at this what the definition of manifest is it's able to be seen clearly shown or visible easy to understand or recognize now my brother and sister you know just talking to people you know and they're like yeah this whole uh this whole serpent seed thing that that's just nonsense that's just that's just well how how did it happen then give us your take how did it happen we don't know how it happened it's a mystery we can't see it but to the bride of christ they look at that and they say it makes perfect sense here is this here's this this come this word said this this word said that coming all the way back down and jesus said you're of your father the devil and they can't recognize that my brother and sister and they think you're strange well i won't use the word strange on them but you have to wonder when people say i don't see it i don't see it i don't see it but the word says it was manifested to us so that means it had to be brought to a place that it was able to be seen first off right the word has to be able to be seen amen and then it is clearly shown and clearly made visible amen that's the revelation that comes in the hour we live in a personal gospel where god says i'm going to open your eyes you're going to see my word and i'm going to manifest or bring to fruition this word that's in you and we get to be the recipients of that now in the sermon it is the rising of the sun now i keep finding myself coming back to this sermon amen it's been a while since i've kind of touched on it but i find myself coming back to it and he says here the trinity of the devil death hell and the grave for satan is the author of death he is a possessor of hell and also the grave that was the trinity of satan being caused by one thing and that was death death you go at the grave being a sinner you go to hell all the very one thing the trinity of satan which was death that had held man in captivity all these years now i want to make my emphasis for everything satan's got he had to draw it from god he cannot create anything can he amen he is not a creator he is not the originator amen so we have the trinity of the devil which is death uh death hell in the grave now we come down here but now the true trinity of god being one manifested in christ who was life and had broke the seals and conquered the enemy and rose up the one true and living god i am he that was dead and am alive forevermore and have the keys of death and hell so here is the trinity of god where he is life but truly in reality he possesses the keys now you can claim you own something little thing i just saw the other day in certain cities uh they're having huge issues with this where people wait till someone goes on vacation they break into the house and then the laws in those communities which tend to be liberal communities are such that when these people come home from their vacation or travels someone's living in their house they can't even kick them out they have to go through an eviction process because we need to be fair and equitable one of the comments on that was their first mistake was they called the police and the second mistake was they asked them to leave when they should have told them now i say that i share that with you my brother and sister because sometimes we go about evicting the devil from our life in entirely the wrong fashion the devil will you please leave will you please clean up the floors and the trash and the damage you've done in my life when we should come on the authority of the word and say satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ and then make up your mind that you're going to back up what you have spoken right this is the thing brother brown talks about this i'm getting a little sidelined but maybe it's necessary people are there and they say oh praise the lord i was prayed for and i'm healed and they go home and go oh my i feel sicker than ever shouldn't even come from our mouth we should declare no matter what i'm healed i'm healed i'm healed but you're doubled over in pain i don't care i'm healed amen so you look at this now oh very one thing the trinity of satan which was death it held man captive in captivity all these years but now the true trinity of god being one manifested in christ who was life and had broke the seals and conquered the enemy and rose up the one true and living god i am he that was dead and i'm alive forevermore i have the keys of death and hell god in one made man and dwelt among us and conquered every can we say that every enemy and had proved that the trinity of satan was conquered and that the trinity of god was made known because only god alone had the power to bring life back again he was at emmanuel god had been manifested in flesh now look at this no wonder he could claim there matthew the 27th chapter all powers in heaven and earth is given into my hand i send you to be my witnesses to all the world now if he sent them to be witnesses my brother and sister they had to have something to testify on he couldn't he wouldn't send forth an empty witness i'm a christian what does that mean well i believe there is a god and i go to church now i don't recommend you guys go dig through all this stuff sometimes i feel compelled to there's things that i'm studying i want to know the counter type of this and i i dig through these things my brother and sister this is what a lot of the denominational churches have come to in the day that we live in i believe there is a god and i go to church that's not christianity there's supposed to be a christ-like life in other words something had to be manifested had to be brought forth where it could be seen visibly i have a good friend i really appreciate the man very successful farmer i've tried witnessing to him several times and he always tells me paul paul faith is a very personal and private thing not to be discussed and i'm not judging my friend but i'm like you've never had a real experience because if you ever have a real experience and somebody talks to you about god talk to you about jesus christ about the holy ghost there's got to be something there to respond back and say i identify with that now that doesn't mean we have to go get on the corner of shinden and whatever but practically stand in the street and wave a sign and scream that's not manifesting either amen all powers in heaven earth is given unto me everything else is powerless he'd conquered it now and then not only that he sent the word to his disciples his believing fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and i have the keys to death and hell i've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every foreordained predestinated seed of god shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth now that ought to give us hope for loved ones amen whether they're our children our parents whatever kind of relative it might be a husband or wife to know that every predestined seed of god must come to life when that light shines on that and we are a people who believe the light is shining don't we amen of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that god ordained to do he had raised from the dead that's quite a lengthy quote so bear with me amen oh what a wonderful thing that is i am alive or quickened the word means the word quicken the greek word means it's something that's made alive after death that's me like the seed that goes into the earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rot every bit of the seed every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again he was quickened not only that and will send the same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you we're not a powerless church saints we're a personalized church we are a body of believers that every affliction and every need has already been identified and he says i've already sent the answer hallelujah amen so the power that brought him from the grave he sent it to you to quicken you that where i am you will be also see there's this personal gospel god didn't just blanket my brother and sister not nor did he take the seed and we look at these things and sometimes we wonder how is it that predestinated works but god knew that each one of you would be here tonight and god knew what i would be speaking tonight and he knew the situation of every one of our lives tonight amen can't we trust a god to guide us when he has that much knowledge of our own life and we don't even know our own mind always amazed i shared this many times but i am amazed we have people explaining god who can't even explain themselves but you see god has sent this down personally to you and i you know amen and i'm going to say something that's just going to shake some people right to their heels and i'm sorry it will but this message it's right there amen that's the message right there god himself see now don't get me wrong you know what i believe i've given my life to this and i'll continue to give my life to this but my brother and sister do we get this we often times say the message the message the message this is the message right here the same life that raised me up our lord jesus speaking that same life that raised me up i have sent it unto you that you would be quickened also that's the message of this hour my brother and sister the very spirit and life of our lord jesus christ coming down to you and i bringing life in us in a dark dying ugly world amen that's the message right here hallelujah you can go a little farther down in my scriptures and you'll find what it says there it says the message is amen but we'll just continue to move forward here now look don't fear anymore i'm going back in the quote here don't fear anymore for every foreordained predestinated seed of god shall come to life when the light spreads across the earth now once you understand that the context in the word shall is a strong assertion or declaration so this is not might maybe could possible this is an absolute so what we have is an absolute that this very life that he is talking about will come can we all have confidence tonight and just simply put it behind us and say has come we don't need to just look off over here looking for some day when god's going to come now the prophet of god talks about a quick powerful work my brother and sister and i know people around this message identifying in that sense around this message that are waiting they're sitting on their hands waiting for this quick powerful work i think it's taking place because we're gonna understand what's quick in god's eyes is not maybe quick in our eyes we can't uh interpret this and through our thinking we have to interpret this through god's thinking and god comes and what does he do with his own word he confirms it amen his own word by what making it come to pass and people are sitting on their hands waiting for some kind of quick powerful work and i can tell you around my house oh i'm not talking about the address and the brick or whatever i'm talking about my house god's doing a powerful work amen god's dealing with me saints in ways i never ever thought and all i can do is say lord forgive me for this and forgive me for that and what it is you know what god's doing you see have any of you ever refined anything so if you haven't it's not a novel concept you take gold silver lead brass you get it hot enough to melt it but really what you still have even though it's hot enough to melt now you still have any any dipper that you would take from that and go you'll find it's contaminated still we're precious we're gold are you with me so god's drawing you out and we're saying praise the lord i'm gold but god just put you over here in another kettle and then depending on what material that they're refining they'll shave a flux into that you know what the flux does it causes all this let's use lead we used to reload a lot of bullets with lead it will draw all this stuff to the surface you can scrape that off are you done no you do it again and depending on how pure you want the bullets to be it's how many times that you have the flux thrown in and the refiner's fire lit underneath now i have a simple question for you tonight saints how pure do we want to be you see if we don't want to be very pure we could just call it good but as i preach to you obedience brings some mission and what we're doing we're coming and we keep coming back to him it's not him forcing his will on us we keep coming back to him purify me lord cleanse me lord give me a clean heart and he says okay here's a little flux turn up the heat and then it seems as though we forgot the prayer in the midnight hours of asking the lord to purify us and then we're here going i don't know what's going on in my life but it feels like everything's going wrong don't worry it's all part of the process because it's a personal gospel and you see we can't just purify the church as one whole because the church is made up of you the individual now as we look at this my brother and sister we realize that god's making a strong assertion and um really if god declares it to be so it's just done that's it i'm sorry i want to speak to you like a farmer sitting in a tractor here but uh you know it's just tough luck if if if you want to make a rapture and your hearts cry as lord purify me and then the lord turns the heat up in your life and seems like everything is just going wrong quit complaining okay i just quit whining quit quit all the sniveling and and quit all this woe is me stuff oh no don't worry about his saints i'm preaching at paul tonight and if it hits you too that's good but you see we can't ask to be purified and cleansed and then complain about the process so when you say in that midnight hour lord give me a pure heart cleanse my heart lord then just buckle down just buckle down and say lord also give me a stiff back you know not not a stubborn one but just a stiff one to just maintain and press forward because you ask from the depths of your heart that midnight hour god says okay i'll do that i'll purify him now think about it my brother and sister to hear those words well done my good and faithful servant compared to something like you know you came so close to making the rapture if you had just submitted yourself one last time instead you quit i know we all preach real politically correct or most the time don't we but i don't want to hear no sniveling if you're quitting if you ask god to carry you through and take you in a rapture and present you as that beautiful gorgeous oh can i just close my eyes and imagine for a minute that absolute gorgeous bride she is like nothing you have ever seen just she's so regal she's so beautiful she's she's just oh everything that you could ever imagine that you quit because it got too hard because to purify us god had to turn the heat up a little bit more from what it was last time we asked the lord to make us rapture ready but we'd like to do it with bunny slippers and popcorn in a recliner and god says i've got some rugged christians the reason i know they're rugged is because i've actually talked to them one-on-one i've dealt with them and i know what their heart is and i know what they've gone through and i know what they believe and they're worthy to bear my name amen reminds me of a true story in nebraska history pioneer this lady was the very example of pioneer spirit outlived three husbands her family still exists today covering a vast expanse of the black hills and and nebraska there and and account some 300 or something descendants and you know what saints somehow this rugged spirit now i hope you follow me here somehow this rugged spirit that was in some of them's great great whatever it is however far goes back grandma that spirit still exists in that family today and that family will tell you we start something we finish it i would love to have her for a grandmother but then again maybe i wouldn't have because maybe she just said get your hide over here you little and get back to work i don't know but it always struck me when i read that story because that pioneer spirit in her and it wasn't that she outlived her husband's every one of them died in some kind of incident one of them indians that's not racist one was a horse one was some other i don't remember and she just kept going forward see she once told one of her children if i had ever looked back i would have went to missouri where i come from but i never once looked back because this was my life saints that's what god's trying to do today amen we've got to come if we start looking back my goodness egypt's going to look good hallelujah except for all the rivers over there drying up which is prophetic think about it amen so let me let me hurry along here amen so we've seen it in verse three we've heard it and we declare it that we can have fellowship and truly our fellowships with the father and of the son jesus christ and these things we write unto you that your joy would be full he's not trying to just give us a portion to come to another day to get another little portion in other words it's not subsistence or a subsistence to a mere existence but my brother and sister he said i'm gonna make your joy full and in the good days it's full and in the bad days it should be full and whether the sun is shining it should be full so we can stand here and say yes a frown might be upon my face but i'm telling you my heart is full because i know who i am in jesus christ and he has come and has given me it's not a future 10th saint where we are at today we can stand and say he has given us his name we walk under his name today we claim the promises today under his name remember when that woman come to jesus her approach in the heart was good thou son of david didn't even seems like he wasn't very kind doesn't it the whole time he knows her heart but what she had to do was take we're not talking about calling ourselves dogs let's not get into some kind of crazy ideas but she had to come and take one last step of submission and says yay master but even the dogs even the dogs eat the scraps she no longer come in some spiritual position claiming something she had no right to she came in the right way now look my brother and sister i used that example unless you would dwell on that and think okay i've got to do no my brother sister the word of god has showed us that we are the bride of jesus christ ask what you will ask anything in my name and it shall be given you what is this that's very personal hallelujah to be the bride of the lord jesus christ how much more personal can that be how much more now look i kind of skipped over this but let me just jump backwards real quick if you don't mind amen let's look at this here hopefully i didn't cut that out i might have no here we are now look when we read these scriptures and and this is why i got excited in the song we were singing because it's here talking about we we now look at this my brother and sister we is a personal pronoun in the first person plural so when john is speaking well when all the apostles are speaking and they are speaking of these things when they say we my brother and sister they are then making an inclusive group and declaring it's us we speak as one we're plural but it's a personal pronoun you realize what that means don't you i hope you do brother jason was joking with me joking with me in the back that there's a reason that there's only certain keys that i like in music and those because those letters were reflected on my report card that just cut me right to the heart i like f but look even i in my state of education can grasp what it means to be a personal pronoun in the plural which means you and i are equal we're included together in this we can speak for one another so when one stands and the apostle paul makes a claim when john makes a claim when all of these apostles make a claim my brother and sister they were speaking it was inclusive to you and i it drew us right into their speech their position their authority their declaration that we included right into it and now i want to bring it closer to home when the prophet of god speaks these things go study the message there is not enough quotes not enough pages to print not enough screen that you can do and he speaks in these terms he's speaking in this into an inclusive and drawing us in it wasn't me the prophet me with revelation me with this he drew this bride of this day into this word of this hour and said you are this word you are this life you are the overcomer hallelujah oh my brother and sister how the gospel has come and been so personal but yet we are so connected people are like oh we're looking for unity to come into the bride i'm telling you unity has come into the bride and it's called the holy ghost amen and though nothing will draw us closer together than us under the anointing of the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen because here it is i'm glad this quote's still up i'll send the same life that quickened me these are the prophets words but i believe it just as though my brother and sister that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you to quicken you now how many of you believe that so that means we believe that we as a body of believers a real body of believers believe that but yet it's a personal gospel to us amen now let's just go into christ the mystery of god revealed and then we'll just hurry it's only about three paragraphs i think amen excuse me i just was sure i'd be done by now i'm sorry saint no i'm not sorry justified in his sight why are we justified come on saints enter in with me i gotta already got my dancing out of the way so i don't have to embarrass you all by me dancing around out here amen we are his victory what is the victory identified in my brother and sister the victor is where victory is always identified do you know if you're on a nfl team and i'm not much into sports but if you're on an nfl team and your team wins the super bowl and you're just the ball boy you get a ring amen imagine now it's not the ring that's worth fifty five thousand dollars but it forever identifies you as being on a winning team yeah some people say the scripture said leave houses lands father mother sister brother whatever that you're supposed to be a loner that's not what it's talking about we're identified now and have always been identified as sheep sheep like each other except for when they don't the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory come on saints look at him if there ever was a sign that god could have chose that he had overcome the world he could have chose the sun the moon the stars he could have raised a mountain up as a memorial he could have done his and he chose you and i wow now okay maybe somebody needs this i love you first if you say you represent jesus christ and therefore by this quote represent his victory and you walk around and your attitude and your behavior and your words are defeated something's wrong well i'm just telling you like it is brother paul no you're not you're telling me what you see you're telling me what you feel you're not telling me the reality this is the reality he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory look saints tonight would can i can i just be over exuberant over confidence tonight we have the evidence of his victory and it's right here on this wednesday night sitting right here in these chairs hallelujah we're not just going to church we're here as celebrating his victory amen a testimony of his victory well brother paul i don't feel so victorious we're not celebrating you you're supposed to be dead he's the one that's living when we see is coming down and living among the church that's his victory so that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us now my brother and sister i want to put this to a spiritual realm some of us are living lives like they've already tossed our bones in the grave well god of prayer now if this is something that hits you i'm not mocking you i'm speaking to you to change your approach brother paul i've got prayers i've prayed for seven years and god's not answered it well you ought to be pretty close to purified by now god just keeps throwing some flux in there and keeps turning up the heat and the devil is trying to get you to deny your very claim but why don't you turn around and say hallelujah if nothing ever changed in my life if i'm a if i have a disease if i have this issue i have this of thorn in my flesh and i go all the way to a natural grave with that i'm still the victory i am still the evidence of the victory and i got something to shout about because i'm on the winning team and we'll always be on the winning team hallelujah oh my so he couldn't keep him in the grave neither to keep us that's right we're bound right and we're already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word my that actually is a pretty big thing do you know that saints well i could go on do we have another couple hours come on i'll tell you what i've got some notes that just take me down this avenue and looking my brother and sister what unbelief has done to us it's the erosion of the moral of our spiritual bones eroded it away where we can't run we can't jump we can't shout we can't praise god because the erosion has taken away the underpinning of the relationship but we're not pentecostals brother paul no but that pentecostal anointing come from god and he never rescinded it he never took it back but i can show you oh how many quotes i won't even try to quote it because i'll mess it up and then somebody will say i twisted the message look how many times go study it how many times brother brown talks about the old cold formal spirit see what satan's trying to do he's trying to erode that so that we just get to the place i'm not preaching that way to your saints i'm not trying to get you to jump and shout and scream but there will be something bubbling up in the heart and soul that satan can't quench he can't stop it he can't quiet it because we've been raised from dead unbelief in his word from denomination creeds to an eternal word of the eternal god which is him himself working hallelujah look saints let me tell you i'm gonna boast just a little bit tonight when god was looking for somebody to do a job and there was a whole whatever however many millions and millions of people on the earth and i tell you how special i am tonight god looked down on the earth and said i'm going to choose you you you you you you to do this work for me why us come on why didn't he do it himself snap of the fingers a voice he said no i'm gonna come down and i'm gonna live in you and you are gonna do this and so i'm going to manifest myself in you because this is my plan now if we're going to write god a letter or send him a voicemail telling him his plan doesn't work please let me know because i want to be on the other side of the county from you i want to be on the other side of town at the least when you start telling god you're wrong you're wrong you should have done it this way eternal word of the eternal god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and then the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it this same word nothing can be added or taken from it so the same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating they are one hallelujah they are husband and wife they are flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit see amen how do you know it bears the same record the same fruit the same word see manifest christ same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same signs things that i do shall also amen well we're waiting for you to walk on water i haven't had any need to walk on water yet but when the day comes and i need to the word of god says i will amen i have never had to cast a demon out of a crazy man among the tombs but i tell you what i have been i've been there with a little girl with his spirit on here i've been there when that little girl with spirit who thought it would be good i'll just speak it blunt to you sounded fun to go be a prostitute declaring to her parents when the day is right i'm gone and i'll have the money to do anything i want to do are we playing game saints to see the power of god come down and that little girl is now mother of at least two children serving god because we serve an awesome the counter of that if you would say as a young man climb out the bedroom window part of a gang coming to the day that the initiate initiation of that gang is to murder somebody needs to be done on a public street in daylight and if you want you become the one that they use and someone else is willing and to see god change an atmosphere where this young man hid for a while and finally said i can't hide my whole life people said move to another part of the country and he says isn't that the same as running went to his pastor they prayed through and he got up one morning and said lord live or die i'm going to serve you openly and he walked right out in the streets and he's there and he's meeting his fellow gang members that he walked away from first time ever in this game well the most violent gangs in santiago chile counted for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of murders and he says lord if that's what it takes i can't leave you god so change the spirit of a whole gang of saints they see him on the street and they're like oh we love you buddy so good to see you we miss you what is it a personal savior a personal god amen amen hallelujah sorry to keep you sister ruth would you come i will stop just start playing when you get to the piano notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell amen oh where are we you know okay went to hell and preached souls in prison that right his flesh only died then he raised it up again and quickened it quicken means made a lie i already read that okay their flesh is flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit see amen how do you know it bears all those same signs sayings now i'm telling you this personal god doesn't want you i hope you're not offended with this this personal god that you serve this personal message is coming this hour he's not wanting i believe god sent a prophet out of you what he's wanting is for you to say you know what the very life my office is not a prophet but the life that was in that prophet is the very life that was promised to me and to you and he wants you to stand up and say you know what i'm claiming this i'm claiming this i'm not called to preach to to tens of thousands around the world i'm not called to do this but the very word that spoke to the wasp and the very word that spoke to the bull and the very word that spoke to the angry man my brother and sister that is the same god here says i am here with you and i am the victory and i am in you so therefore you are victory can we lift a hand tonight and say i'm the victory of jesus christ i am the very victory of jesus christ hallelujah now look let me just catch this right down here at the bottom not right his flesh only died then he raised it up again and quickened it quickened means made alive his flesh which was his body that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in reformation and now how much do we believe this message now she is standing on her feet and the word says the spirit who's the spirit [Music] boy there's so many answers to that question and there it's a holy ghost it's a spirit of god it's a shady eye it's an oh we could just keep going and going and going right down but the word is god himself so the word has come and the word says in the spirit and the bride you see how you've come to that lofty position god has poured victory into you and the bride's not going to stab you imagine this last hour this last age this bride of christ around the world which i include us in if we all just put our head down and said no it's just too hard it's too much it's been too long [Music] we just were defeated this message had crumbled almost as fast as all the rest of these are but you see what the difference is saints sorry to belabor this but i'm just excited my heart's just bubbling you see what's what's holding this bride this true bride it's what's holding her up against the the very force the gale force of hell you say well brother paul no i'm telling you i'm here to tell you it's the gale force of hell that's blowing against you and how are you able to stand in this day because the victory of jesus christ himself is in you and he poured it in there and now she's caught a revelation and she's standing on her own feet come on you know how i'm a firm believer in rugged christians amen just like that grandma smith nebraska amen she'd tell her kids when they were about four years old it's time for you to take care of yourself now most of you mamas would just roll over and go i couldn't do that to my baby but she had 11 of them to take care of you're four years old you can hold a fork you can walk you can sit at the table it's time for you to take care of yourself saints we've heard the message preached week after week year after year amen don't be draping yourself oh pastor oh evangelist oh brother special so-and-so now it's time stand on your feet stand up claim the victory because god said i will be with the pastor who could then counsel you don't you remember that scripture neither do i i'll be with come on help me i'll be with you even in you hallelujah sorry for those who got to work tomorrow i just have to sit on a tractor but look at this since it's time let's be rugged christians supposed to be a rugged church i'd boast on you but some of you go home feeling too good well i'll boast on you anyway i'll tell you there's people they boast you up to me brother paul what have you done with that church i got out of their way they have such kind heart they're so there's just have a welcoming spirit a warm spirit there's such nice people brother paul surely you've done something special no i did literally i got out of the way i got out of the way why because you are she you are she amen the bride of this last day hallelujah oh my can we sing a song or two light of the world shining in darkness brother jason please help me hallelujah i feel like i ate a whole bag of cotton balls amen
