[43:13] thank you musicians jeremiah chapter
[43:24] four
[43:26] amen it's good to be in the house of god
[43:28] again
[43:37] like jason was saying um
[43:40] the devil fought my day too
[43:45] and i knew i told my wife i said well
[43:47] just
[43:49] then we just switch to a handheld
[43:52] probably okay praise the lord
[43:56] the red one okay
[44:00] i gotta take the jacket off anyways
[44:09] i stole a line from brother jewel forney
[44:13] he takes his jacket off and says he
[44:14] can't fight
[44:16] and preach with a jacket on and i'm
[44:17] doing both tonight
[44:20] praise the lord and coming out swinging
[44:21] at the devil because he's defeated foe
[44:24] and uh when he's fighting it just gives
[44:27] me more confidence that god's placed
[44:29] the right thing upon my heart amen
[44:31] jeremiah chapter 4
[44:33] verse 1 bible reads if thou wilt return
[44:37] o israel saith the lord
[44:39] return unto me and if thou will put away
[44:42] thy abominations
[44:43] out of thy my sight then shalt thou not
[44:46] remove
[44:47] and thou shalt swear the lord liveth in
[44:49] truth in judgment and in righteousness
[44:52] and the nations shall bless themselves
[44:54] in him and in him
[44:56] shall they glory for thus saith the lord
[44:58] to the men of judah and jerusalem break
[45:00] up your fallow ground
[45:01] and sow not among thorns circumcise
[45:05] yourselves to the lord and take away the
[45:06] foreskins of your heart
[45:08] ye men of judah inhabitants of jerusalem
[45:11] thus my fury come forth like fire
[45:13] and burn that none can quench it because
[45:15] of the evil of your doings
[45:17] amen we believe that we want to
[45:19] circumcise our hearts
[45:20] with the holy spirit amen deuteronomy
[45:23] chapter 30
[45:24] had to add i felt led to add this one in
[45:26] here because that
[45:28] verse in jeremiah ends kind of doomly
[45:32] but um we are children of the promise
[45:36] and i believe that as children of god we
[45:40] look to the positive we know what will
[45:42] happen if we disobey or if we don't
[45:44] follow god but as christians if our eyes
[45:46] are on
[45:47] the positive and what god will do if we
[45:49] serve him
[45:50] amen that is what we will fulfill in our
[45:52] lives so deuteronomy chapter 30 says
[45:54] verse one and it shall come to pass when
[45:57] all these things are come upon thee and
[45:58] the blessed the blessing
[46:00] and the curse which i have set before
[46:01] thee and thou shalt call them to mind
[46:04] among
[46:04] all the nations whither the lord thy god
[46:07] hath driven thee
[46:09] and shalt return unto the lord thy god
[46:12] and shalt obey his voice according to
[46:14] all that i command thee this day
[46:16] thou and thy children with all thine
[46:17] heart and with all thy soul
[46:20] that then the lord thy god will turn thy
[46:22] captivity and have compassion upon thee
[46:24] and will return and gather thee from all
[46:26] the nations whether the lord thy god
[46:27] hath
[46:28] gathered thee if any of thine be driven
[46:30] out
[46:31] unto the outmost parts of heaven from
[46:33] thence with the lord thy god gather thee
[46:35] and from thence will he fetch thee in
[46:37] the lord thy god
[46:39] amen there's some loved ones in the that
[46:42] have been driven out
[46:43] the outmost parts of heaven and the lord
[46:45] thy god will bring thee into the land
[46:47] which thy fathers
[46:48] possessed and thou shalt possess it and
[46:50] he will do the good
[46:52] and multiply thee above thy fathers and
[46:54] the lord thy god will circumcise thine
[46:56] heart
[46:57] and the heart of thy seed to love the
[46:59] lord thy god with all thine heart and
[47:01] with all thy soul
[47:02] that thou mayest live and the lord thy
[47:04] god this is the part i wanted to get to
[47:06] that
[47:07] verse six there and then onward and the
[47:10] lord thy god will put all these curses
[47:12] upon thine enemies
[47:13] and on them that hate thee in which
[47:15] persecuted thee
[47:16] and thou shalt return and obey the voice
[47:18] of the lord and do all his commandments
[47:20] which i command thee this day
[47:22] and the lord thy god will make thee
[47:23] plenteous in every work of thine hand
[47:25] and the fruit of thy body and the fruit
[47:27] of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land
[47:28] for good
[47:29] for the lord will again rejoice over
[47:31] thee for good as he rejoiced over thy
[47:33] fathers
[47:34] if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of
[47:36] the lord thy god to keep his
[47:37] commandments and his statutes which are
[47:39] written in this book of the law
[47:40] and if thou turn unto the lord thy god
[47:42] with all thine heart
[47:43] and with all thy soul let's bow our
[47:46] heads

[48:20] stand upon that standing upon your word

[48:27] already been given the victory lord god
[48:30] it says it in the end of the book lord
[48:32] jesus and father i pray that you would

[48:50] lord we desire one thing only tonight is
[48:53] that that is to meet face to face with
[48:55] you lord jesus
[48:56] commit these words into your hands in
[48:58] jesus christ's name we pray
[49:00] amen you may be seated tonight
[49:03] amen my title is kadesh barnea
[49:06] controversy
[49:08] there's a lot of controversies in the
[49:10] world today a lot of conspiracies
[49:16] but the kadesh barney controversy and um
[49:19] my wife was like you're going to put
[49:21] that in there my subtitle is the hill of
[49:23] foreskins
[49:26] praise the lord that offends you
[49:29] i'll go back to the bible praise the
[49:31] lord numbers chapter 13
[49:33] so the cadis barnett controversy so we
[49:36] read here and
[49:37] if you want to turn to numbers 13 verse
[49:39] 16 you read here
[49:41] in um that god is is calling israel
[49:44] in the book of jeremiah calling them
[49:46] back and in
[49:48] deuteronomy saying if you will follow my
[49:50] words and you will
[49:52] he's desiring that that you return that
[49:55] they return to the lord and they keep
[49:57] with with christ and
[49:58] and i think just really speaks to my
[50:00] heart because it shows the heart
[50:02] of the father it shows the very the very
[50:04] inward parts of christ and that is he's
[50:06] longing
[50:07] to pull you in to himself numbers
[50:10] chapter 13
[50:11] verse 16. so here we have israel and
[50:13] i'll set a back story
[50:15] a little bit to bring to your
[50:16] remembrance they've come out of egypt
[50:18] and they've
[50:18] reached the promised land brother
[50:20] branham says in a quote he says they
[50:22] would marry him and moses were dancing
[50:23] it on the on the other side of the red
[50:25] sea
[50:26] little did they know they were about 10
[50:27] days from the promised land but they
[50:29] wandered for another 40 years
[50:31] in the wilderness and so it wasn't that
[50:33] far of a journey from egypt to the
[50:35] promised land
[50:36] and they get to the river jordan and
[50:40] moses sends out these spies from kadesh
[50:43] and they go across the river and to spy
[50:45] out the land and so we picked this up in
[50:46] numbers
[50:47] 13 verse 16 and these are the names of
[50:49] the men which moses sent to spy out the
[50:52] lamb
[50:52] and moses called oshia the son of
[50:54] non-jehosha
[50:56] and moses sent them to spy out the land
[50:59] of canaan
[51:00] and said unto them get you up this way
[51:02] southward and go
[51:03] up into the mountain and see the land
[51:06] what it is and the people that dwelleth
[51:08] therein
[51:08] whether they be strong or weak few or
[51:11] many
[51:12] and what the land is that they dwell in
[51:14] whether it be good or bad
[51:15] and what cities they be that they dwell
[51:18] in whether intense or in strongholds and
[51:20] what the land is whether it be fat or
[51:22] lean
[51:22] whether there be wood therein or not and
[51:25] be of good courage and bring of the
[51:26] fruit of the land
[51:28] now the time was a time of the first
[51:32] ripe grape so they went up and searched
[51:33] the land from the wilderness of zinn
[51:36] amen so they went through the land verse
[51:39] 25 and they returned from searching of
[51:41] the land after forty days
[51:43] and they went and came to moses and to
[51:45] aaron and to all the congregation
[51:47] of the children of israel under the
[51:49] wilderness of quran to kadish
[51:51] and brought back word unto them and unto
[51:53] all the congregation
[51:54] and showed them the fruit of the land
[51:56] and they told him and said we came unto
[51:58] the land
[51:59] wither thou sentest us and surely it
[52:01] flows with milk and honey
[52:03] and this is the fruit of it
[52:06] so we'll continue reading in a minute
[52:09] so moses picks these 12 men and he
[52:12] doesn't just pick
[52:13] any old fly by night these are solid men
[52:16] in the community
[52:17] these are men that are well respected by
[52:20] those around them
[52:21] these are men that are looked up to as
[52:23] leadership and so their word
[52:26] held a lot of weight their word held a
[52:28] lot of moving power and so
[52:32] we've we continue here in 28
[52:34] nevertheless the people be strong that
[52:36] dwell in the land so here they come with
[52:37] a report of yes
[52:39] the promises are true and the promises
[52:41] are there but
[52:44] and the cities are walled and very great
[52:46] and moreover we saw the children of
[52:48] ainak there do you know they did no need
[52:49] whatsoever to tell
[52:51] to give this portion of their report i
[52:53] don't need to hear you tell me about the
[52:55] devil's strengths
[52:57] he has none because i have christ
[53:00] i'm fighting against the devil i'm
[53:02] fighting against we are the bride of
[53:03] christ fighting against the enemy
[53:06] we want to know how to fight him better
[53:08] we don't want to know how he fights us
[53:10] better
[53:11] amen we want to know his tactics and we
[53:14] want to know his
[53:15] the how he moves right you understand
[53:16] what i'm saying but we're not going
[53:18] around preaching the devil's gospel
[53:20] and that's what they're doing here
[53:21] they're talking about defeat
[53:23] they're they're they're they're there
[53:25] and you you you get this with some
[53:28] and i feel to say tonight i am not
[53:30] preaching tonight to any man or against
[53:33] any man or against any people
[53:35] but tonight we're preaching against
[53:36] those spirits that are behind what
[53:38] they're doing
[53:39] and so tonight i'm going to push aside
[53:41] my desires to
[53:42] to and in my self and just speak what
[53:45] god has laid upon my heart and so
[53:47] many times you have preachers and
[53:49] they'll preach and they talk about the
[53:50] promises of god but they always
[53:52] end it on the negative they always end
[53:54] it in defeat
[53:55] and you find a people in their church
[53:57] are full of defeat
[53:58] but if you can preach the victory of
[54:00] christ you find the people in the church
[54:03] in victory in christ because guess what
[54:05] the story doesn't end here in verse 28
[54:08] nevertheless the people will be strong
[54:10] that dwell in the land doesn't end there
[54:12] we see god brings them through even
[54:14] their own mistakes as we'll find out
[54:16] they wandered in the wilderness god even
[54:18] brought them through that
[54:20] and joshua and caleb they lived through
[54:22] that and they come through and they
[54:23] still laid whole to your promise
[54:25] so just because you came from a bad
[54:27] church or you came from a bad situation
[54:29] or you grew up in a bad situation
[54:31] god can bring you through the wilderness
[54:33] in your life unto your promise
[54:36] why because there's something in your
[54:37] heart amen there's a token there's that
[54:40] seed in your heart that says i'm
[54:41] identified with the land on the other
[54:43] side of jordan
[54:44] amen verse 29 the malachites dwell in
[54:47] the land of the south
[54:48] and the hittites and the jebusites and
[54:50] the amorites dwell
[54:51] in the mountains and canaanites dwell by
[54:53] the sea by the coast of jordan
[54:56] they just blew the wind out of
[54:57] everybody's sails
[54:59] but verse 30 and caleb stilled the
[55:01] people before moses in other words
[55:03] everyone started
[55:04] shouting arguing probably you know how
[55:06] it is when you have a crowd of people
[55:07] everyone's quiet
[55:08] then you give the news you know say it's
[55:10] a big group of uh maybe it's a factory
[55:12] say we're gonna have to lay off 50
[55:14] people i got the whole
[55:15] crew there we're going to have to lay
[55:17] off 50 people everyone's quiet listening
[55:19] and as soon as it says that everyone
[55:20] starts fighting and arguing
[55:21] and yelling and trying to point this guy
[55:23] down and and so here's the children of
[55:25] israel
[55:25] right you get under stress you've been
[55:27] here you ever been under stress
[55:29] stress am i speaking to real people
[55:30] tonight amen you get under stress
[55:34] you yell don't lie
[55:39] i know you do so here they are they're
[55:42] yelling
[55:43] they're shouting i i thought tonight
[55:44] when i read the scripture kayla must
[55:46] have had a big voice
[55:48] because he's still the people so he
[55:50] shouted louder than them
[55:52] let us go up at once and possess it for
[55:55] we are well able to
[55:56] overcome it
[56:00] and that's the message tonight that is
[56:02] what
[56:03] you want to focus on you will overcome
[56:06] it
[56:07] verse 31 but the men that went up with
[56:10] him
[56:11] said we be not able to go up against the
[56:13] people for they are stronger than we
[56:17] why are they arguing against the promise
[56:22] there's something wrong in their hearts
[56:24] verse 32 and they brought
[56:26] up an evil report evil what is evil evil
[56:29] is of the enemy
[56:30] evil is of the devil so what were they
[56:32] doing they were preaching the devil's
[56:33] gospel
[56:35] underneath the pretense of the ministry
[56:37] of moses
[56:39] they were sent by moses to spy out the
[56:42] land and here they come back giving a
[56:43] report
[56:44] as a message believer saying we can't do
[56:48] it
[56:49] they gave they spoke whatever you want
[56:52] to call it they
[56:53] preached an evil report you say how can
[56:56] that be the man behind the pulpit
[56:58] you know i don't understand why can he
[56:59] preach this and
[57:01] and then all those years or this out of
[57:03] the other you sat underneath that
[57:05] and you say how can someone get up there
[57:07] preaching the message
[57:08] but preaching it under an evil report
[57:12] there's something wrong in their heart
[57:13] and we're going to find that out tonight
[57:14] by the grace of god
[57:16] and saying they searched under the
[57:17] children of israel saying the land
[57:19] through which we have gone to search it
[57:21] is the land that eateth up the
[57:22] inhabitants thereof
[57:24] and all the people that we saw in it are
[57:26] men of great statue
[57:27] basically they said the promise is good
[57:29] the promise is there
[57:31] but if we go after the promise we're
[57:33] going to be devoured by the enemy
[57:37] i'm here tonight to say that we're going
[57:39] to go after the promise we're going to
[57:41] be attacked
[57:42] by the enemy but by the grace of god
[57:44] he's a defeated foe
[57:47] and there we saw the giants and the sons
[57:49] of anac which come
[57:50] of the giants and we were in our own
[57:52] sight as grasshoppers
[57:54] and so we were in their sights
[57:58] praise the lord
[58:01] the circumcised children of israel
[58:03] turned down
[58:05] the promise out of fear and
[58:08] died in the wilderness but god
[58:11] always has men like caleb and joshua
[58:15] and these men lived on through that 40
[58:17] years
[58:20] there's always the other part of the
[58:23] story
[58:26] here we are we see these israelites 10
[58:29] out of 12 say there's no way we can make
[58:31] it there's no way we can go across
[58:33] and take the promise it's too big for us
[58:38] i have a question for for them them
[58:40] israelites if they were standing here
[58:42] today and i had each of them lined up in
[58:43] front of me and i could speak to them i
[58:45] said i have a question for you gentlemen
[58:48] what is the alternative
[58:52] what do you have that is better than
[58:55] that
[58:56] what can you give me that is better than
[58:59] the promised land
[59:00] a new captain to take me back to egypt
[59:03] to bondage
[59:05] because that's what they say if you read
[59:06] on in the next chapter let us make a
[59:08] captain let us return to egypt
[59:09] return to egypt so that's funny
[59:13] two weeks ago you couldn't wait to get
[59:16] out of egypt
[59:17] now you get to where you belong because
[59:19] moses has told us and moses has been
[59:21] vindicated by god and his message has
[59:23] brought us to this place
[59:24] of crossing and now you say moses is
[59:27] wrong
[59:28] what were you saying two weeks ago
[59:31] everybody followed moses out of egypt
[59:34] [Music]
[59:36] it's not the men it's the spirit behind
[59:38] the man
[59:40] joshua chapter 5.
[59:46] i couldn't hardly contain myself
[59:48] studying this out
[59:53] as i i just wanted to stop writing
[59:56] it's good and i said no no no i gotta
[59:59] write the notes down
[1:00:00] because you get up here and you think
[1:00:01] you're all inspired and you get up here
[1:00:02] and you're like
[1:00:03] what was i gonna say praise god
[1:00:07] joshua chapter i'm sorry there's lengthy
[1:00:09] reading tonight but hey
[1:00:10] maybe some of you needed some extra
[1:00:12] reading today
[1:00:18] all right so that we discussed and we
[1:00:20] talked about the refusal at kadish
[1:00:23] they refused to follow god's promise
[1:00:25] they refused to act upon
[1:00:27] god's word we have a thing in in the
[1:00:29] business called an action item
[1:00:31] you have a meeting it's great you talk
[1:00:32] about a bunch of stuff
[1:00:34] but if you never decide on any action
[1:00:36] items everyone just goes away and does
[1:00:37] nothing
[1:00:39] but in the meeting you say okay paul
[1:00:42] haylett
[1:00:42] what action item are you going to take
[1:00:44] okay we write it down
[1:00:46] this thing paul haley says he'll have
[1:00:48] this done in a week
[1:00:49] right then there's accountability
[1:00:56] i'm sorry
[1:01:00] kristen
[1:01:06] i lost my train of thought praise god
[1:01:14] joshua chapter five so they refused to
[1:01:17] go across jordan and refuse to take
[1:01:20] their inheritance that's
[1:01:24] that's the crazy thing is it's like if
[1:01:26] if if i have
[1:01:27] this is my watch and sean has my watch
[1:01:30] and sean is six foot five
[1:01:34] 235 pounds lean as a whistle
[1:01:40] and i'm afraid of him sean's like that
[1:01:43] ain't out of that already
[1:01:46] i love you man and he has my watch and
[1:01:49] but it's mine
[1:01:54] and i have the ability to take it back
[1:01:56] regardless because it's mine
[1:01:59] he can be as big and bad as he wants but
[1:02:01] it's mine
[1:02:03] right you have ever desired to get it
[1:02:05] maybe i'll go get a few friends
[1:02:08] right but i'm going to find a way to get
[1:02:10] my watch back
[1:02:12] if someone steals your car you don't go
[1:02:13] oh bummer i lost my car
[1:02:16] i guess i'll have to walk to church i
[1:02:17] guess i won't get go go to work
[1:02:20] someone lost no you go to the police you
[1:02:23] start asking you start showing pictures
[1:02:24] you know like someone loses a dog have
[1:02:26] you seen my dog you see those pictures
[1:02:27] all over the place
[1:02:29] you're singing well maybe it's a good
[1:02:30] thing that dog disappeared
[1:02:34] you're going to look for it because it's
[1:02:36] what you lost
[1:02:38] that's what caleb and joshua had a
[1:02:39] revelation of this is something they
[1:02:41] lost
[1:02:42] this was theirs to begin with
[1:02:45] it was their promise it wasn't just
[1:02:47] something that oh if you want you can go
[1:02:49] and you can have this no it was
[1:02:51] already theirs and that's the way it is
[1:02:54] with you and
[1:02:55] i it's already ours
[1:02:59] and when and when you wanna when you
[1:03:01] listen and you and you take in
[1:03:03] and you feed on that message of well
[1:03:06] but the giants but
[1:03:10] you're you're you're the same thing as
[1:03:12] saying oh i guess my car's stolen
[1:03:16] chapter 5 so now we see the israelites
[1:03:19] the in the return to the river after 40
[1:03:22] years of wandering in the wilderness and
[1:03:24] it came to pass when all the kings of
[1:03:25] the amorites
[1:03:26] which are on the side of jordan westward
[1:03:28] and all the kings of the canaanites
[1:03:30] which were by the sea
[1:03:32] heard that the lord had dried up the
[1:03:33] waters of jordan
[1:03:35] from before the children of israel until
[1:03:37] we were passed over
[1:03:38] that their heart melted neither was
[1:03:41] their spirit in them
[1:03:42] anymore because of the children of
[1:03:44] israel let me tell let me ask you
[1:03:45] something the bible says jesus christ is
[1:03:47] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:03:49] do you think the same thing would have
[1:03:50] happened to them 40 years prior to this
[1:03:52] when they crossed the river jordan yes
[1:03:54] absolutely see what you what you do is
[1:03:56] you look at it with your
[1:03:58] unnatural eye and you say i can't do
[1:04:00] this because
[1:04:01] because this will happen and this will
[1:04:03] happen and this will happen and i might
[1:04:05] lose my house or i might lose my friends
[1:04:07] or this over here you you look at it
[1:04:10] with the natural eye but you don't
[1:04:12] know what's around the bend only god
[1:04:15] knows what's around the bin
[1:04:16] and he's trying to tell you listen he
[1:04:18] can't he can't get up there and say
[1:04:21] okay listen if you go
[1:04:24] and you do this and this and this
[1:04:28] i will give you this and this and this
[1:04:31] there's no faith but what
[1:04:34] faith does is faith testifies to your
[1:04:38] revelation of
[1:04:39] christ and that's what god's looking for
[1:04:41] in his bride
[1:04:42] it's as simple as that
[1:04:45] although not so simple to im to him
[1:04:48] apply
[1:04:50] but god is gracious there i go preaching
[1:04:52] the evil report
[1:04:56] praise the lord
[1:05:02] god will teach us and he will teach us
[1:05:03] like a little child you can't tell them
[1:05:05] one time
[1:05:05] don't touch the hot stove and that's
[1:05:08] that
[1:05:10] you have to tell them and then you tell
[1:05:12] them again
[1:05:13] and you say okay now there's a
[1:05:15] consequence now when they go
[1:05:17] up to see the wood stove the hot stove
[1:05:19] they remember the consequence and they
[1:05:21] said i better not touch that
[1:05:24] okay if there might take a few more
[1:05:26] consequences so for some kids
[1:05:28] right praise the lord
[1:05:33] and that's what god does with us
[1:05:36] we have to we have to go day in and day
[1:05:38] out sometimes
[1:05:40] a long time doing the same dumb thing
[1:05:42] over and over again
[1:05:43] until we finally get it through our
[1:05:45] thick skulls what god is trying to show
[1:05:47] us
[1:05:48] but i believe that all things are done
[1:05:50] in god's timing
[1:05:52] and though the children of israel turn
[1:05:54] and walked away we wouldn't be able to
[1:05:56] use this example if they hadn't wandered
[1:05:57] in the wilderness for 40 years
[1:06:00] and god's done many great things praise
[1:06:02] the lord chapter five and it came to
[1:06:04] pass
[1:06:04] okay verse two and at that at that time
[1:06:07] the lord said unto joshua make these
[1:06:09] sharp knives and circumcise again the
[1:06:11] children of
[1:06:12] israel the second time and joshua made
[1:06:14] him sharp knives and circumcised the
[1:06:16] children of israel at the hill of
[1:06:17] foreskins
[1:06:20] and this is the cause why joshua did
[1:06:22] circumcise all the people that came out
[1:06:24] of egypt that were males even all the
[1:06:26] men of war
[1:06:27] died in the wilderness by the way after
[1:06:30] they came out of
[1:06:31] egypt now all the people that came
[1:06:34] out were circumcised but all the people
[1:06:37] that were born
[1:06:38] in the wilderness by the way as they
[1:06:40] came forth out of egypt
[1:06:42] them they had not circumcised
[1:06:46] the children of israel walked 40 years
[1:06:47] in the wilderness till all the people
[1:06:49] that were men of war which came out of
[1:06:51] egypt
[1:06:52] were consumed because they obeyed not
[1:06:54] the voice of the lord unto whom the lord
[1:06:56] swear that he would not show them
[1:06:58] the land which the lord swear unto their
[1:07:00] fathers that he would give us a land
[1:07:02] that floweth
[1:07:03] with milk and honey and their children
[1:07:05] whom he raised up in their stead
[1:07:07] then joshua circumcised so they were
[1:07:09] uncircumcised because they had not
[1:07:10] circumcised circumcised them by the way
[1:07:15] here we have these children growing up
[1:07:19] uncircumcised in other words not so much
[1:07:22] that
[1:07:23] you know there's coming a younger
[1:07:24] generation in the message that's going
[1:07:26] to take over that's not
[1:07:27] what i'm saying rather it's the fact
[1:07:30] that
[1:07:31] those circumcised israelites that came
[1:07:34] out of
[1:07:35] egypt you see you kind of begin to see
[1:07:38] why they refuse the promise because they
[1:07:39] didn't take the word
[1:07:41] and act upon it circumcision was
[1:07:46] as obvious to them as water baptism is
[1:07:48] to us
[1:07:50] it was what you did it was a covenant
[1:07:52] and in the wilderness
[1:07:53] moses lays it into the law in the book
[1:07:56] of leviticus
[1:07:57] on the eighth day the child will be
[1:07:59] circumcised
[1:08:00] they were given the law but many of them
[1:08:03] failed to read it
[1:08:04] surprise surprise so now you have
[1:08:08] and now they have these people that they
[1:08:10] knew the law they knew of the message of
[1:08:12] moses the ministry of moses and they
[1:08:14] followed him
[1:08:15] and then and they went across the river
[1:08:17] jordan
[1:08:18] but they never applied the word in their
[1:08:21] life
[1:08:22] had they done that their children would
[1:08:24] have been circumcised
[1:08:26] amen praise the lord
[1:08:30] verse 8 and it came to pass when they
[1:08:32] had done circumcising all of people that
[1:08:33] they abode in their places in the camp
[1:08:35] till they were whole and the lord said
[1:08:37] unto joshua this day i have rolled away
[1:08:39] the reproach of
[1:08:40] egypt from off you wherefore the name of
[1:08:43] the place is called gilgal
[1:08:44] unto this day
[1:08:48] so there was no victory in the promised
[1:08:51] land
[1:08:52] until the circumcision amen all those
[1:08:55] born in the wilderness were left
[1:08:57] uncircumcised the lord
[1:09:00] raised up the old men of war's children
[1:09:02] to inherit the promise in their stand
[1:09:04] the bible says so god kept to his word
[1:09:07] because he had to have a group of
[1:09:10] he had to have israelites
[1:09:14] to invade and inhabit the promised land
[1:09:17] so even though there was
[1:09:18] error in their upbringing god came down
[1:09:21] and used that
[1:09:22] and brought them across into the land
[1:09:24] because his word
[1:09:25] has to come to pass
[1:09:29] praise the lord amen and the lord and
[1:09:32] the lord
[1:09:33] is raising up a bride so here it is it's
[1:09:36] not it's not that
[1:09:37] you know this guy had his ch his kill
[1:09:39] children and they grew up in the message
[1:09:41] so they're going to take over and that
[1:09:42] guy is bad
[1:09:43] no that's not what i'm saying god is
[1:09:46] raising up a bride
[1:09:48] to tear down the ideology and traditions
[1:09:52] of the message or religion from those
[1:09:55] who came out of egypt with moses
[1:09:58] am i am i preaching against men no no
[1:10:00] i'm talking about the spirit
[1:10:02] the spirit of let's organize the spirit
[1:10:06] of
[1:10:06] taking this thing and it now becomes it
[1:10:08] becomes just like the lutherans and it
[1:10:10] becomes just like the methodist now
[1:10:12] the word of god says it will will not
[1:10:14] denominate
[1:10:15] but that spirit still is trying to
[1:10:17] infiltrate and god is raising up a bride
[1:10:19] like we heard on sunday to push back
[1:10:21] and take down that antichrist spirit
[1:10:25] and in verse 9 we read here that it says
[1:10:27] i have rolled away the reproach of egypt
[1:10:29] from off you
[1:10:30] and gilgal means a wheel rolling
[1:10:33] and christ we know is the wheel in the
[1:10:36] middle of the wheel
[1:10:38] the center of our purpose the very heart
[1:10:41] of the matter the very reason we
[1:10:43] are who we are today and why we do what
[1:10:46] we do in him
[1:10:47] hebrews 4 12 says for now this is
[1:10:50] interesting because god is
[1:10:51] he's the very center of it right and he
[1:10:54] he moved that reproach he rolled that
[1:10:57] wheel of reproach
[1:10:59] off of them from egypt just like the
[1:11:02] stone rolled away
[1:11:03] and um and and god's always moving
[1:11:08] god's always moving god doesn't stand
[1:11:10] still god's always moving
[1:11:13] you know some of the when when when the
[1:11:15] um the british came over to america to
[1:11:17] fight
[1:11:18] the revolutionaries they stood up in
[1:11:20] lines in a field
[1:11:22] and were waiting for us to come out and
[1:11:24] fight against them instead
[1:11:26] we ran around in the trees shooting from
[1:11:29] different positions and we ran around
[1:11:30] behind them and we were hiding we were
[1:11:32] constantly moving and some
[1:11:33] as a kid we played hide and seek we
[1:11:35] played paintball we played airsoft and
[1:11:37] if you stayed in one spot you were bound
[1:11:39] and determined to get found and shot
[1:11:41] but if you kept moving no one could find
[1:11:44] you as well because
[1:11:45] right they already looked there so god
[1:11:47] right he keeps on moving and and
[1:11:49] brother brahm says you know everyone's
[1:11:51] looking to what god did yesterday and
[1:11:52] what god's gonna do tomorrow
[1:11:54] but they fail to do what he's doing felt
[1:11:56] against what he's doing today
[1:11:57] amen because what happens is you stop
[1:12:01] and god moves on past you
[1:12:04] but here we see that that god calls him
[1:12:06] across the river jordan and he says okay
[1:12:08] now it's time to circumcise them
[1:12:10] and the word of god the very center the
[1:12:12] very the very who of dividing of the
[1:12:15] joint
[1:12:15] and the marrow hebrews 4 12 for the word
[1:12:19] of god is quick and powerful and sharper
[1:12:21] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[1:12:22] to the dividing asunder of soul and
[1:12:24] spirit
[1:12:25] and of the joints and moral and as a
[1:12:27] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:12:29] the heart
[1:12:30] amen christ the wheel in the middle of
[1:12:32] the wheel
[1:12:33] amen praise the lord and then
[1:12:37] amen sorry am i clearing mine
[1:12:47] verse 10 of the children of israel
[1:12:48] encamped in gilgal and kept the passover
[1:12:50] on the 14th day of the month at even in
[1:12:52] the plains of jericho
[1:12:53] and they did eat of the old corn of the
[1:12:56] land
[1:12:57] and on the morrow after the passover
[1:12:59] unleaded unleavened cakes and parched
[1:13:01] corn
[1:13:02] in the cell same day and the manna
[1:13:04] ceased on the morrow after they had
[1:13:06] eaten of the old corn of the land
[1:13:08] neither had the children of israel manna
[1:13:10] anymore but they did eat of the fruit of
[1:13:12] the land of canaan that year
[1:13:15] after the circumcision they ate of the
[1:13:18] old corn of the land
[1:13:20] they ate of the fruit of the promise
[1:13:22] they were like john in the book of
[1:13:24] revelations
[1:13:25] eat the book sweet what milk and honey
[1:13:28] the land flowing with
[1:13:29] honey sweet in your mouth but bitter in
[1:13:31] your belly
[1:13:32] revelation only comes once you've
[1:13:34] crossed over into
[1:13:36] the promise which is christ
[1:13:39] there was no old corn wandering in the
[1:13:41] wilderness
[1:13:42] there was manna from heaven which was
[1:13:46] sustaining
[1:13:48] which wasn't very exciting
[1:13:51] adoption 1960 brother mum says how
[1:13:54] many's received the promise of the holy
[1:13:56] ghost
[1:13:56] oh aren't you glad that you're in the
[1:13:58] land over here now
[1:14:00] eating the old corn eating the strong
[1:14:02] things of god and got a
[1:14:03] clear understanding your spiritual mind
[1:14:07] is all
[1:14:08] unmuddled up you know exactly i love
[1:14:11] this
[1:14:12] i might even pin this on my wall you
[1:14:13] know exactly who he
[1:14:15] is you know exactly what he is
[1:14:18] you know exactly where you're going
[1:14:21] you know exactly all about it you know
[1:14:23] in whom you have believed and persuaded
[1:14:25] he's able to keep that which you've
[1:14:26] committed to him
[1:14:28] against that day amen they had the faith
[1:14:31] under the ministry of joshua which is a
[1:14:33] type of christ
[1:14:34] the children of israel had the faith to
[1:14:36] cross the river jordan
[1:14:38] amen and because of that faith god
[1:14:40] recognized that faith in their
[1:14:42] heart and god recognized the faith in
[1:14:43] your heart when you crossed over and he
[1:14:46] gave you the holy spirit
[1:14:47] he gave you to circumcise your heart
[1:14:50] amen because that's what the holy ghost
[1:14:52] is that's what
[1:14:53] circumcision is there's a covenant with
[1:14:55] abraham saying god
[1:14:56] identified his faith god has identified
[1:15:00] your faith and he's given you the holy
[1:15:01] spirit
[1:15:03] crossing over means intimately knowing
[1:15:06] christ
[1:15:07] and your womb is sealed you couldn't
[1:15:10] tell those children of israel that
[1:15:11] crossed over jordan and begin to fight
[1:15:12] that it was too hard to cross the river
[1:15:14] they'd already done that
[1:15:16] they'd already crossed over
[1:15:20] anyone with a cl without anyone without
[1:15:22] a clear understanding
[1:15:24] and without a desire to change
[1:15:27] because we're growing in christ and
[1:15:30] without a desire to change
[1:15:33] there's no one a clear understanding of
[1:15:34] the open word is not eating the old corn
[1:15:37] of the land
[1:15:39] well that's pretty straight but that's
[1:15:41] the word of god
[1:15:43] how can you be eating the old corner of
[1:15:45] the land and you don't have a desire to
[1:15:47] move anywhere with christ you're a
[1:15:50] statue to old traditions
[1:15:54] you're a statue representing the
[1:15:56] antichrist spirit that's coming to
[1:15:58] divide
[1:15:59] and and conquer but it never will
[1:16:03] they're still wandering in the
[1:16:05] wilderness
[1:16:11] they have the wilderness version
[1:16:14] but i don't want the wilderness version
[1:16:16] because the wilderness version says i
[1:16:18] can't i can't i can't
[1:16:20] but christ is the cantor amen and now i
[1:16:22] preach the virgin i can
[1:16:24] i can i can
[1:16:28] praise the lord you see what happened
[1:16:30] moses
[1:16:31] introduced israel to joshua
[1:16:34] joshua to israel and then he passed off
[1:16:37] the scene
[1:16:40] joshua's a type of christ moses brought
[1:16:42] the children of israel to the place to
[1:16:44] cross
[1:16:44] and then he goes off the scene and it
[1:16:47] was christ or joshua that took the
[1:16:49] children of israel
[1:16:50] into their promise
[1:16:55] moses just brought them to the place to
[1:16:57] cross
[1:16:58] says this is what we know this is this
[1:17:01] is what it is
[1:17:02] the message of brother branham brought
[1:17:03] us to the place to cross
[1:17:06] he brought us the word he bro he tied up
[1:17:09] the other the
[1:17:10] loose ends he didn't but god used him
[1:17:13] his ministry and he's brought us to the
[1:17:16] place but now
[1:17:17] if you stay because here's the thing in
[1:17:19] this story
[1:17:20] we have the ending but this story is not
[1:17:23] completed yet
[1:17:25] yeah so now we have a little bit of a
[1:17:27] different version we have those
[1:17:28] in the promised land just like and those
[1:17:31] outside of it in the wilderness
[1:17:32] just like the the children of israel
[1:17:35] said we want to stay on this side
[1:17:38] we want to stay on this side and so you
[1:17:41] have people still in the wilderness
[1:17:43] and you over here in the promised land
[1:17:45] and that's why you know by god's grace
[1:17:46] we we
[1:17:47] we pray and we ask god to give
[1:17:51] those that we know more revelation but
[1:17:53] we're standing here looking across the
[1:17:55] river saying
[1:17:56] why take a bite of a grape this big
[1:18:01] why you don't want this right
[1:18:04] and bro praise god we're going to get to
[1:18:07] this part
[1:18:08] because you're eating it i'm not gonna
[1:18:11] get ahead of myself
[1:18:12] remember this big whole grape now
[1:18:15] circumcision was preached by moses
[1:18:19] but no israelite was circumcised under
[1:18:21] his ministry in the wilderness
[1:18:24] underneath that because no one can be
[1:18:27] can be can be circumcised underneath the
[1:18:29] ministry of a man it's not his
[1:18:31] his words it's not his preaching that
[1:18:34] circumcise you it's the revelation
[1:18:36] of christ through what you hear that
[1:18:39] circumcises your heart
[1:18:41] amen circumcision came under the
[1:18:44] ministry of joshua or christ
[1:18:46] right but you had to have the ministry
[1:18:47] of moses to bring you
[1:18:49] to that place
[1:18:53] the ministry of brother branham per se
[1:18:55] won't circumcise you
[1:18:57] that's why you have people that listen
[1:18:58] to it and they preach something
[1:19:00] completely contrary to it
[1:19:02] right because they're hearing words
[1:19:05] you say well you're making this up for
[1:19:07] the chris go back
[1:19:09] to the gospels and read about jesus and
[1:19:10] him him preaching on the shores of
[1:19:12] galilee and says them saying you're
[1:19:14] beelzebub
[1:19:16] i'm sorry he was in their midst he was
[1:19:18] christ
[1:19:20] brother branham was just a
[1:19:20] representation preaching christ
[1:19:23] just like you and me are but here you
[1:19:26] have jesus on the shores of galilee and
[1:19:28] these people are saying to his face
[1:19:30] you're beelzebub
[1:19:35] praise the lord but it was god but god's
[1:19:38] ministry amen began to bring out and
[1:19:41] call out those people
[1:19:43] right and then and then on the in the
[1:19:46] upper room god finished the work that he
[1:19:48] started amen his ministry
[1:19:51] or message will take you to the place of
[1:19:53] circumcision in christ i
[1:19:54] it's quiet tonight i hope you understand
[1:19:56] what i'm saying i'm not preaching
[1:19:57] anything new
[1:19:58] amen false teachings come from a heart
[1:20:01] that has
[1:20:01] never met christ face to face
[1:20:05] because guess what every word of god in
[1:20:08] the bible
[1:20:09] every word in the message together
[1:20:11] preached together
[1:20:12] every part every single part of that is
[1:20:15] christ and so if you've never met christ
[1:20:19] face to face
[1:20:21] say well my goodness i was at a camp
[1:20:23] meeting
[1:20:24] and i cried for 38 hours sorry
[1:20:29] did you meet christ that's nice did you
[1:20:32] meet christ
[1:20:34] and that's where we have a false
[1:20:36] representation
[1:20:38] of this and that's where god give me
[1:20:40] grace i believe with all my heart
[1:20:43] that the bride of christ is moving into
[1:20:46] a position
[1:20:47] where she can stand up and say that and
[1:20:49] not feel guilty because she didn't get
[1:20:51] all moved in the flesh
[1:20:52] but there's something in her heart and
[1:20:54] that's going to manifest into the
[1:20:56] emotion
[1:20:57] but there's something in her heart that
[1:20:58] says okay you look like you got it you
[1:21:00] act like you got it
[1:21:02] now tell me where'd you get it
[1:21:05] well you know this and and that and you
[1:21:07] watch their life and time will tell
[1:21:10] time will tell a lot of things and you
[1:21:12] see well they never met christ
[1:21:14] because we're not going to stand the
[1:21:15] bride of christ is
[1:21:17] it oh glory to god the bride of christ
[1:21:21] is christ to this world
[1:21:25] she's not going to stand and hide and
[1:21:26] say you're wrong
[1:21:29] she's gonna stand up and say prove it by
[1:21:31] the word
[1:21:32] you have an idea you have something in
[1:21:34] your life that you're doing that you
[1:21:35] think is okay
[1:21:36] prove it by the word of god amen
[1:21:41] praise god i don't care where you gate
[1:21:44] got this
[1:21:46] and i don't care how good it sounds and
[1:21:48] how many people believe you
[1:21:51] i don't care how many people believe you
[1:21:53] if 400 people walk
[1:21:55] off a cliff guess what you're going to
[1:21:56] say that was really dumb i can't believe
[1:21:58] they all did that i'm not going to walk
[1:21:59] off a cliff
[1:22:00] but yet you walk off a cliff in spirit
[1:22:02] in the spiritual
[1:22:03] because you say well this is him this is
[1:22:07] that guy this look at all these people
[1:22:10] all these people can't be fooled
[1:22:11] yes they can yes they
[1:22:15] can you uh you know you say well this
[1:22:18] this this great man of god
[1:22:19] told me this guess what if it's contrary
[1:22:21] to the word i don't care who he is it's
[1:22:23] wrong
[1:22:25] god calls us to check all things by the
[1:22:28] scripture
[1:22:29] all things by the word and if you get an
[1:22:31] idea
[1:22:32] i'm yelling because i'm excited if you
[1:22:33] get an idea from from listening to a
[1:22:35] tape
[1:22:36] as a preacher i do this all the time i
[1:22:38] hear that oh that's a great idea
[1:22:40] i go back doesn't line up with the word
[1:22:41] i throw it in the trash can because
[1:22:43] you're a human
[1:22:45] you're a human you're going i've had to
[1:22:48] get up and say look
[1:22:49] church sorry i said this doesn't line up
[1:22:51] made a mistake i'm sorry i
[1:22:53] read it wrong because i'm a human being
[1:22:55] but what happens is you get people full
[1:22:56] of pride that says well i'm a preacher i
[1:22:58] can't make a mistake
[1:23:00] or i'm a deacon i can't make a mistake
[1:23:02] i'm a song leader i can't make a mistake
[1:23:04] everybody knows the sound guys make lots
[1:23:06] of mistakes
[1:23:09] it's all their fault
[1:23:14] just kidding i'm just kidding
[1:23:17] that's just what everyone thinks
[1:23:21] praise the lord amen but it doesn't
[1:23:24] matter who they are
[1:23:26] you check it by the word and where you
[1:23:28] fall as you begin to follow man
[1:23:30] what did the children of israel do they
[1:23:32] they followed those 10 men
[1:23:36] they followed those 10 men praise the
[1:23:39] lord
[1:23:42] wandering in the wilderness will lead to
[1:23:44] death
[1:23:45] and death is total separation from god
[1:23:48] being blown about by every wind of
[1:23:51] doctrine
[1:23:52] there's always something new exciting
[1:23:55] oh did you see wow did you hear
[1:23:59] i heard it but i never read it
[1:24:03] not that i'm saying i hear something new
[1:24:05] and i don't go in my bible
[1:24:07] you know because i've already read it no
[1:24:09] you kidding me you read one verse
[1:24:12] five times a day for the next 20 to 50
[1:24:15] years
[1:24:16] and it will be different every single
[1:24:18] day
[1:24:19] but not we are not we're not the bride
[1:24:21] of christ is not blown about by every
[1:24:23] wind of doctrine
[1:24:26] amen those wandering in the wilderness
[1:24:29] are refusing to accept
[1:24:30] the their promise those israelites that
[1:24:34] stayed on the other side and settled in
[1:24:35] on the other side were refusing to
[1:24:37] accept their promise
[1:24:41] because there was something missing
[1:24:42] remember i said the big grape
[1:24:46] you take a bite out of it you look
[1:24:48] across the river and you go out why i
[1:24:50] don't understand
[1:24:51] don't you see this grape john chapter 6
[1:24:54] verse 41.
[1:24:59] i don't know if my wife heard me but i
[1:25:01] read this scripture and then i
[1:25:02] read verse 44 or something like that and
[1:25:06] i went up a couple verses and i
[1:25:08] got so excited i almost put a hole in my
[1:25:09] desk
[1:25:11] i slammed down on and i jumped up and i
[1:25:13] said oh god
[1:25:15] your word is amazing amen john chapter 6
[1:25:20] verse 41 the jews then murmured at him
[1:25:22] because he said i am the bread
[1:25:24] which came down from heaven and they
[1:25:26] said is not this
[1:25:27] jesus the son of joseph whose father and
[1:25:30] mother we know
[1:25:31] how is it then that he saith i came down
[1:25:33] from heaven
[1:25:34] jesus therefore answered and said unto
[1:25:36] them murmur not among yourselves no man
[1:25:38] can come to me except the father which
[1:25:39] hath sent me draw him
[1:25:41] and i will raise him up at the last day
[1:25:43] it is written in the prophets and they
[1:25:45] shall all be taught of god every man
[1:25:47] therefore that hath heard
[1:25:48] and hath learned of the father cometh
[1:25:50] unto me not that any man hath seen the
[1:25:52] father save he which is of god
[1:25:54] he hath seen the father verily verily i
[1:25:56] say unto you he that believeth on me
[1:25:58] hath everlasting life i am the bread of
[1:26:01] life
[1:26:01] your fathers did he man in the
[1:26:03] wilderness and are dead
[1:26:05] this is the bread which cometh down from
[1:26:07] heaven that a man may eat thereof
[1:26:08] and not die i am the living bread which
[1:26:11] came down from heaven if any man
[1:26:13] eat of this bread he shall live forever
[1:26:16] and the bread that i will give
[1:26:17] is my flesh which i will give for the
[1:26:19] life of the world
[1:26:20] they he was unrecognized christ
[1:26:24] right in their midst we know this man
[1:26:26] he's the son of joseph
[1:26:28] we know this guy he can't be christ he
[1:26:30] can't be the messiah
[1:26:32] he was the unrecognized christ they're
[1:26:34] standing on the other side of the river
[1:26:35] saying no no no
[1:26:37] that can't be a grape that that big
[1:26:39] because it's too hard to take the
[1:26:40] promised land
[1:26:41] that can't be it because it's too hard
[1:26:43] to go over there's
[1:26:45] that you know that's a small kind of
[1:26:47] what are you eating what is that
[1:26:49] a rotten gore they don't even
[1:26:52] see it right it's unrecognized christ
[1:26:56] right in their midst
[1:26:59] if you go down farther in that same
[1:27:00] chapter in this bout when we jump out of
[1:27:02] my skin
[1:27:02] god okay in the same chapter jesus
[1:27:05] identifies the pharisees as children of
[1:27:07] those who eat manna in the wilderness
[1:27:09] and died children of
[1:27:13] in the same chapter he spoke those words
[1:27:16] of separation to them
[1:27:17] and to the seventy that walked away
[1:27:22] two types of people the same spirit
[1:27:25] the inability to recognize christ in
[1:27:27] their midst
[1:27:29] the inability they saw it they walked
[1:27:31] with him they argued with him
[1:27:33] as there were the pharisees these
[1:27:35] disciples walked with him but when he
[1:27:37] preached the word
[1:27:39] the two-edged sword when he began to
[1:27:41] introduce the word unless you eat my
[1:27:43] flesh and drink my blood it that came
[1:27:45] the time
[1:27:46] of separation guess what 12 of them
[1:27:48] crossed the river jordan the 70s stayed
[1:27:50] in the wilderness and died
[1:27:52] they manifested that of their fathers
[1:27:54] well another place he says you are of
[1:27:56] your father the devil
[1:27:58] it's the same spirit and god was in this
[1:28:00] chapter god was exposing those spirits
[1:28:03] because guess what a devil is just like
[1:28:04] a cockroach you walk into a dark room
[1:28:07] you can hear him scurrying around all
[1:28:08] free will he
[1:28:09] but you turn on the light they freeze
[1:28:12] and then when they think you're not
[1:28:12] looking they run and hide
[1:28:14] well guess what tonight here i'm kicking
[1:28:16] all the lights in the house on i'm
[1:28:18] turning the attic light on i'm turning
[1:28:19] the crawl space line out i'm turning the
[1:28:21] floodlights on all around the house
[1:28:22] why because it's jesus christ in our
[1:28:24] midst and it's time we stopped
[1:28:26] bowing down to the little cockroach
[1:28:28] because guess what all you gotta do is
[1:28:29] go like that
[1:28:30] and squish him but instead you stand the
[1:28:32] other side of the door i can
[1:28:34] hear him it's really dark in there i
[1:28:36] can't go in there there's too many of
[1:28:37] them just turn on the light they'll run
[1:28:39] and hide
[1:28:42] amen christ in their midst unrecognized
[1:28:44] yet he was the very
[1:28:46] thing oh my the very thing these
[1:28:49] pharisees had
[1:28:50] labored for
[1:28:54] but what happened oh i hope you take
[1:28:56] this the right way
[1:28:59] what happened god turned things upside
[1:29:01] down
[1:29:02] sometimes god does things right in your
[1:29:05] midst that looks so
[1:29:06] odd and so off from what you think it
[1:29:10] should be
[1:29:11] somebody comes up or something happens
[1:29:13] or you get a uh
[1:29:14] the word or you hear something god does
[1:29:16] something
[1:29:18] you're just like no there's absolutely
[1:29:19] no way that could be god it's too
[1:29:21] it's too different but see
[1:29:24] what happened and this is probably
[1:29:27] farther on but whatever
[1:29:28] what happened was they listened to men
[1:29:31] but the twelve listened to god because
[1:29:34] that's the only way you can tell is this
[1:29:35] god
[1:29:36] or is it not you come face to face with
[1:29:38] christ
[1:29:40] and someone brings you something false
[1:29:42] you're gonna know it
[1:29:43] are you gonna know it right then maybe
[1:29:46] maybe later on when you go to your word
[1:29:48] but because you know christ you'll say
[1:29:50] okay
[1:29:52] i know i know my wife if someone stole
[1:29:55] her phone and
[1:29:56] texted me i know this is not my wife
[1:30:00] you know give me your social what what's
[1:30:03] your bank info
[1:30:05] right i'm gonna say i don't know who
[1:30:07] this is but this isn't my wife
[1:30:08] that's not how she talks you're gonna
[1:30:10] hear somebody talking
[1:30:13] the message oh it's so easy it's so easy
[1:30:16] to sound right
[1:30:18] but you can tell when you meet christ
[1:30:20] you can tell when you hear somebody just
[1:30:22] sounding right
[1:30:23] because why the word of god divides
[1:30:25] asunder to the very
[1:30:26] what why does the scripture say the
[1:30:28] joints and the marrow because it goes to
[1:30:30] the very
[1:30:31] deepest inner parts and says this is
[1:30:34] this and this is that
[1:30:36] brother branham says in god hiding
[1:30:38] himself in simplicity
[1:30:40] now notice moses in the day that god was
[1:30:42] going to deliver the children of israel
[1:30:44] according to his word
[1:30:46] what did he do he chose a simple family
[1:30:49] right this is what i'm talking about god
[1:30:51] is doing something a little bit
[1:30:52] different
[1:30:55] we have no record of them see just the
[1:30:57] son of levi is all we know see but it
[1:30:58] doesn't matter he doesn't say this but
[1:31:00] this is my words
[1:31:01] it doesn't matter if they're preaching
[1:31:04] christ
[1:31:04] if their life is displaying christ who
[1:31:06] cares where they came from
[1:31:09] if their life lines up with christ who
[1:31:11] cares what they did
[1:31:15] their life lines up with christ that's
[1:31:18] an important part because sometimes what
[1:31:19] you did before
[1:31:20] can affect today
[1:31:24] see and so we and his wife just an ordin
[1:31:27] just a ordinary probably a mud dauber as
[1:31:29] the world would think
[1:31:30] out there making bricks for the enemy he
[1:31:32] was just an ordinary slave in israel
[1:31:36] oh praise god god can take you
[1:31:39] from a place of making bricks for the
[1:31:41] enemy to being
[1:31:43] a leader in god's presence because each
[1:31:46] and every one of you
[1:31:47] is a king and a queen in christ we're
[1:31:51] all
[1:31:52] going to go over there on the other side
[1:31:53] and be leaders because god brought you
[1:31:55] from a place of making bricks for the
[1:31:57] enemy in egypt
[1:31:58] he brought you through the wilderness
[1:31:59] and across the river jordan and now you
[1:32:01] stand as a king
[1:32:03] and as a queen for christ your
[1:32:06] your past where you came from
[1:32:09] is gone but god chose that family to
[1:32:13] bring forth to deliver just an ordinary
[1:32:15] jewish family
[1:32:16] he never went and got royalty and
[1:32:18] celebrity or something or even got some
[1:32:20] priest he took a common ordinary family
[1:32:22] see simplicity
[1:32:23] notice what he done then he brought
[1:32:24] forth a child a simple human being
[1:32:27] he could he could have ordained the sun
[1:32:29] if he wanted to to deliver them he could
[1:32:31] have ordained to see but the sun can't
[1:32:33] relate with you
[1:32:35] he could have ordained the wind to
[1:32:36] deliver them but the wind can't relate
[1:32:38] with you
[1:32:39] and you can't relate with the wind
[1:32:41] that's why
[1:32:42] christ had to come down in a body just
[1:32:44] like ours he could have ordained an
[1:32:46] angel to deliver them oh hallelujah god
[1:32:47] can do whatever he wants to do well how
[1:32:49] do you know then brother branham
[1:32:51] see they were questioning him then god
[1:32:53] won't leave his program that's the
[1:32:54] reason we know that this day it's got to
[1:32:56] be simple see
[1:32:57] now he always works in simplicity but
[1:32:59] god in the beginning that could have
[1:33:01] made the son preach the gospel or the
[1:33:02] winds
[1:33:03] preached the gospel or an angel preached
[1:33:05] the gospel but he ordained
[1:33:07] men for that purpose and he never
[1:33:09] changes it
[1:33:10] he never ordained him he never ordained
[1:33:12] denominations he never ordained groups
[1:33:14] of men he ordained
[1:33:15] men to preach the gospel not machinery
[1:33:18] mechanical
[1:33:20] mechanical devices or any angelic being
[1:33:22] it was man
[1:33:23] god chose man i'm not preaching against
[1:33:25] anybody tonight i'm preaching against
[1:33:26] those spirits
[1:33:27] that we see working in our midst they
[1:33:29] meant god chose
[1:33:30] god called men but but you see the thing
[1:33:32] of it is these men had to be harnessed
[1:33:34] by god or god was going to school them
[1:33:36] for them to see everyone in the in in in
[1:33:39] israeli camp knew moses wasn't allowed
[1:33:41] to see the promised land because he
[1:33:42] smote the rock
[1:33:44] they saw that they saw his humanness and
[1:33:47] they followed him because of his message
[1:33:48] they followed him because what he said
[1:33:50] and how he lived lined up with christ i
[1:33:52] mean what we have
[1:33:53] sometimes is we have people who just
[1:33:55] blindly follow men because they're
[1:33:57] preachers
[1:33:58] or blindly follow men because of who
[1:34:00] their family is or where or
[1:34:01] who their daddy is that we have people
[1:34:03] that blindly follow men without saying
[1:34:05] does this man
[1:34:07] preach christ and guess what no no no
[1:34:10] but no man
[1:34:11] anointed truly anointed of christ is
[1:34:13] going to make himself something
[1:34:15] he's going to get smaller so christ can
[1:34:17] get bigger
[1:34:18] and that's the thing if he's not
[1:34:20] introducing you to christ but he's
[1:34:21] setting up himself a dominion
[1:34:23] and the kingdom you need to find
[1:34:25] somewhere else to go to church
[1:34:26] if that's the scenario this can happen
[1:34:28] with just people you know in your life
[1:34:31] mentors that you know in your life can
[1:34:33] lead you astray even though they're not
[1:34:34] a preacher even though they're not a
[1:34:35] deacon even though they're not a pastor
[1:34:37] you always have to check everything back
[1:34:40] to the word of god
[1:34:41] but the bible says and behold the
[1:34:42] greater than solomon is here in 1962 god
[1:34:44] never used idols
[1:34:46] he always used man god don't use
[1:34:48] machinery mechanical devices he uses men
[1:34:51] individuals excuse me i didn't mean to
[1:34:54] hauler that loud
[1:34:55] i left that part in there on purpose
[1:34:57] notice i'm not excite
[1:34:58] i'm not excited though i know right
[1:35:00] where i am that's right i just feel good
[1:35:02] guess what if you know right where you
[1:35:03] are you're just going to feel good
[1:35:06] praise the lord joshua chapter 3 verse
[1:35:12] 14.
[1:35:26] and it came to pass when the people
[1:35:28] removed from their tents to pass over
[1:35:30] jordan
[1:35:31] the priests bearing the ark of the
[1:35:33] covenant before the lord
[1:35:34] and as they that bear the ark were come
[1:35:37] unto jordan the feet of the priests that
[1:35:39] bear the ark were dipped in the brim of
[1:35:41] the water
[1:35:42] for jordan overfloweth all his banks all
[1:35:44] the time of the hardest
[1:35:46] that the waters which come down from
[1:35:47] above stood and rose up upon a heap far
[1:35:50] away from the city adam that is beside
[1:35:51] zaraton
[1:35:52] and those that came down toward the sea
[1:35:54] of the plain even the salt sea
[1:35:56] failed and were cut off and the people
[1:35:57] passed over right against jericho
[1:35:59] and the priests that bear the ark of the
[1:36:01] covenant of the lord stood firm on the
[1:36:02] dry ground
[1:36:03] in the midst of jordan and all the
[1:36:06] israelites passed over on dry god until
[1:36:08] all the people were passed
[1:36:09] clean over jordan just before this god
[1:36:12] tells joshua the priests will lead the
[1:36:14] way
[1:36:14] have them step into the water and when
[1:36:17] they do
[1:36:17] the waters will part and the children of
[1:36:20] israel can walk across
[1:36:21] into into the dry land now am i saying
[1:36:24] well preachers wow they're a special
[1:36:26] they're they're there's something above
[1:36:28] you
[1:36:28] absolutely not i'm showing you god's
[1:36:31] plan
[1:36:32] god's program is that a faithful
[1:36:34] ministry would bring the message
[1:36:36] bring the word amen god has ordained
[1:36:39] that to step
[1:36:40] into the river jordan but there's some
[1:36:42] that are
[1:36:43] out there wandering in the wilderness
[1:36:44] because they can't bring themselves to
[1:36:46] cat
[1:36:47] to bring themselves to accept the word
[1:36:49] and accept the
[1:36:50] the preaching of the word through a
[1:36:52] five-fold ministry so instead they sit
[1:36:54] and they dry up in the wilderness
[1:36:56] listening to just the tapes
[1:36:59] but god has provided a way now
[1:37:02] again this is not lifting myself up at
[1:37:05] all but god has provided a way
[1:37:07] for crossing into the promise for
[1:37:09] crossing into christ
[1:37:11] and that is behind the levitical
[1:37:13] priesthood
[1:37:14] not even behind they'll step into the
[1:37:16] river then the water parts and they were
[1:37:18] the last ones to follow right
[1:37:19] showing showing that they were just but
[1:37:21] servants
[1:37:23] preaching the gospel just a servant
[1:37:25] preaching the gospel
[1:37:26] it's nothing i don't get lifted up i
[1:37:28] don't get you know i
[1:37:29] anyways praise the lord the levitical
[1:37:31] priesthood those men
[1:37:33] preaching the truth
[1:37:36] those were anointed levitical priests
[1:37:39] so when they set into the river jordan
[1:37:41] when they picked up the ark they weren't
[1:37:42] killed
[1:37:43] because they were truth they had truth
[1:37:47] but the battle says in the patmos vision
[1:37:48] he says all right voice
[1:37:50] horrible what a horrible thing for a
[1:37:52] drifting soul on the sea of life no
[1:37:54] pilate to guide him loose floating with
[1:37:56] the tides
[1:37:57] to hear the roar of the great cataracts
[1:37:59] the faults what a horrible thing it
[1:38:00] would be to a soul drifting
[1:38:02] voice the minis of many waters what is
[1:38:05] his voice it's the judgment the voice
[1:38:07] of the ministers through the holy spirit
[1:38:08] that's cried out to the people
[1:38:10] in every age standing there the voice of
[1:38:12] many waters cried out
[1:38:14] thickness and multitudes the voice of
[1:38:15] those seven stars in his hand
[1:38:17] every church age preaching the baptism
[1:38:19] of the holy ghost the baptism in jesus
[1:38:21] name speaking in tongues
[1:38:23] the power of god the resurrection of
[1:38:25] christ the second coming
[1:38:26] divine judgment the voice of many waters
[1:38:29] came forth from this one that looked
[1:38:30] like the son of man
[1:38:32] many waters what it'll be to know that
[1:38:34] you set
[1:38:35] in meetings and heard that you should
[1:38:37] get right with god and receive the holy
[1:38:39] ghost
[1:38:40] and a drifting soul to hear that voice
[1:38:42] speak out in that meeting that you
[1:38:44] said in and heard the judgments of god
[1:38:46] preached and refused it
[1:38:47] that's part of the problem with just
[1:38:49] listening to the tapes
[1:38:51] because that that that you don't get
[1:38:53] that because guess what believe it or
[1:38:55] not they pick and choose
[1:38:56] praise the lord amen judges chapter 6
[1:39:01] so we're tearing down the idols of
[1:39:03] tradition
[1:39:04] the bride of christ is raising up the
[1:39:06] bride of christ is rising up
[1:39:08] with a revelation of who christ is and
[1:39:10] they're beginning to identify things in
[1:39:12] their life
[1:39:13] they're beginning to identify things
[1:39:14] around them that don't line up
[1:39:16] and by the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:39:19] they're tearing those things down
[1:39:21] even as we heard on sunday they're
[1:39:22] tearing those things down because
[1:39:24] because guess what anti-christ anything
[1:39:27] contrary to christ
[1:39:28] is antichrist doesn't have to be the
[1:39:30] pope and
[1:39:31] you know all that although he is because
[1:39:33] he's antichrist amen don't complicate it
[1:39:36] praise the lord chris come on
[1:39:37] amen so judges chapter 6 verse 25
[1:39:41] i overthink things sometimes
[1:39:46] but not anymore i'm delivered judges
[1:39:49] chapter 6
[1:39:53] praise the lord see you can preach a
[1:39:55] message like this
[1:39:56] as a child of god and all you want to do
[1:39:58] is shout but there's always somebody
[1:40:00] just
[1:40:01] squirming in their seat collar's getting
[1:40:04] sticky
[1:40:04] right because you're preaching right now
[1:40:06] i'm not saying there's anybody here i'm
[1:40:08] just saying in general right
[1:40:10] you know you think about it you say well
[1:40:11] you know if the preaching doesn't matter
[1:40:13] what the topic is if the preaching's hot
[1:40:16] go get whatever it was that was making
[1:40:18] you feel that way dealt with
[1:40:20] praise god judges chapter six and then
[1:40:23] it will just feel so
[1:40:24] good but then tomorrow morning at 4 am
[1:40:27] it'll be bitter in your belly josh
[1:40:30] chapter 6
[1:40:31] 25 and it came to pass the same night
[1:40:34] that the lord said unto him talking to
[1:40:36] gideon
[1:40:36] take thy father's young bullock even the
[1:40:38] second bullock of seven years old and
[1:40:40] throw down the altar of baal
[1:40:42] that thy father hath and cut down the
[1:40:44] grove that is by him
[1:40:45] and build a altar upon alter unto the
[1:40:48] lord thy god upon the top of this rock
[1:40:50] in the ordered place
[1:40:51] and take the second bullock and offer a
[1:40:53] burnt sacrifice with the wood of the
[1:40:55] grove which thou shalt cut down
[1:40:57] then gideon took ten men of his servants
[1:41:00] and did as the lord had said unto him
[1:41:02] and so it was because he feared his
[1:41:04] father's household and the men of the
[1:41:05] city that he could not do it by day
[1:41:07] that he did it by night
[1:41:11] gideon grew up following this idol if
[1:41:14] you will
[1:41:16] because why gideon because we do
[1:41:20] and
[1:41:23] it's it's it's a bit of a it's a it okay
[1:41:27] just gonna say you have to you don't
[1:41:30] want to take it in the context of the
[1:41:31] world
[1:41:32] because they take this asking why i
[1:41:33] think way too far
[1:41:36] they want you to know you just go to
[1:41:37] church you live in a bathtub you need to
[1:41:39] be asking why well
[1:41:40] they're right you need to know that you
[1:41:43] know that you know
[1:41:44] that you're following the truth
[1:41:47] and so i had someone tell me one time
[1:41:49] when this was working
[1:41:51] at work and he was like well why do you
[1:41:52] do that and i was like just because
[1:41:53] that's what we do and he goes that's
[1:41:55] really dumb
[1:41:56] don't ever do things just because you do
[1:41:58] it ask why find out because either
[1:42:00] there's either a good reason or you'll
[1:42:01] find out there's a better way to do it
[1:42:04] and so here we have gideon never asked
[1:42:07] why do we follow baal
[1:42:09] well we don't know that maybe he was and
[1:42:10] that's why the lord came to him when he
[1:42:12] did
[1:42:12] but god called him out of that okay so
[1:42:14] here we are we're going to take gideon
[1:42:15] like this
[1:42:15] he grows up worshipping the idol baal
[1:42:18] yet he's a
[1:42:19] israelite living in the promised land
[1:42:22] but here it is
[1:42:23] is this virgin this religion that his
[1:42:26] father raised up
[1:42:27] and now he's serving it and he's he he's
[1:42:29] helping his you know his dad out and he
[1:42:31] and he's refreshing the wheat
[1:42:32] and everything and he never stops and
[1:42:34] says well why
[1:42:36] why are we doing this why why why why
[1:42:39] we're christians why are we worshiping
[1:42:41] an idol like this
[1:42:42] and then god calls him up and god says
[1:42:46] get rid of that thing so now we have
[1:42:49] him tearing down the traditions of his
[1:42:53] fathers the pharisees guess what jesus
[1:42:57] says ministry when he came to the shores
[1:42:58] of galilee did it tore down the
[1:43:00] traditions and the religion
[1:43:01] of the fathers
[1:43:05] and restored that and so instead of
[1:43:08] instead and what happened is gideon just
[1:43:11] just takes the word
[1:43:12] he doesn't argue with god doesn't say
[1:43:13] hang on let me go get oh this is really
[1:43:15] good let me go get let me he doesn't say
[1:43:17] let me go get another sheepskin and put
[1:43:18] it down and i'm gonna i'm gonna make
[1:43:19] sure you really want me to go do this no
[1:43:21] he'd already met christ
[1:43:24] he'd already proven god by his word
[1:43:26] that's what you have to do you have a
[1:43:28] question in your heart
[1:43:29] prove god by his word don't just sit
[1:43:31] there and think well maybe everyone's
[1:43:32] lying to me because i don't understand
[1:43:34] this and i've had no one explain it to
[1:43:35] me properly
[1:43:36] search it and search it and search it
[1:43:39] and pray and pray and pray do i mean do
[1:43:41] i mean spend hours
[1:43:42] combing page by no i mean search it in
[1:43:46] your heart with prayer
[1:43:48] and god will identify if you're not
[1:43:50] doing that
[1:43:51] you're wasting my time
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:54] because that's what this is about this
[1:43:55] isn't about you just swallowing
[1:43:57] everything i've said tonight
[1:43:59] this is about you swallowing what you
[1:44:01] know
[1:44:02] is christ and going back if there's
[1:44:04] anything you don't know
[1:44:06] and double checking it and that's not
[1:44:09] wrong
[1:44:10] that is what you're called to do praise
[1:44:12] the lord i'm preaching to the choir
[1:44:14] tonight
[1:44:15] i hope praise the lord
[1:44:19] if you view christ through the eyes of
[1:44:22] tradition
[1:44:23] there is a good chance you'll miss him
[1:44:25] completely
[1:44:27] that's what happened with the pharisees
[1:44:29] god didn't come up and line up with
[1:44:31] their
[1:44:32] version of religion with their version
[1:44:34] of the message
[1:44:38] the will of god is to be searched out
[1:44:41] within the word
[1:44:44] you go to your pastor you go you get
[1:44:47] advice
[1:44:48] from men from god god called men
[1:44:51] anointed men
[1:44:52] but if that doesn't line up with the
[1:44:54] word it's contrary it's wrong
[1:44:58] don't say this man
[1:45:02] is anointed he must know the will of god
[1:45:04] for my life i'm going to accept
[1:45:05] everything he says and i'm not going to
[1:45:07] pray
[1:45:07] and i'm not going to search the word and
[1:45:09] what happens is sometimes you
[1:45:11] god calls you to do something and he put
[1:45:13] something in your heart to do
[1:45:15] and you pray about it and you search the
[1:45:16] word and then you go
[1:45:18] and people fight against that you see
[1:45:22] you need to know you need to know in
[1:45:26] your heart
[1:45:27] that what you're doing is god wants you
[1:45:29] to do otherwise you'll crumble right
[1:45:31] before that
[1:45:33] and then you sit and god makes your life
[1:45:36] miserable
[1:45:36] amen until you again
[1:45:40] come to that place where you separate
[1:45:42] yourself
[1:45:45] never let what never let what you think
[1:45:48] is your
[1:45:49] duty keep you from following christ
[1:45:52] all the way well i have to
[1:45:56] i have to do this
[1:46:00] because it's my duty so therefore it's
[1:46:03] the will of god no it's not
[1:46:06] no it's not everything you do in your
[1:46:10] life
[1:46:11] you need to ask yourself is this what
[1:46:12] god wants me to do
[1:46:15] you say see well it's my duty to provide
[1:46:17] for my family so i need to keep going to
[1:46:18] this job
[1:46:19] that takes me out of church for two
[1:46:22] three weeks
[1:46:25] no maybe you should quit your job
[1:46:29] and watch god give you one amen i i
[1:46:32] lord bless our pastor i've never heard
[1:46:34] that before well maybe you should quit
[1:46:36] your job
[1:46:39] god calls us to do crazy things can i
[1:46:41] share a quick testimony
[1:46:42] amen the other night and this is not to
[1:46:44] lift myself up in any way whatsoever but
[1:46:46] to testify of god
[1:46:48] god said chris give all the cash in your
[1:46:51] wallet
[1:46:52] so i gave part of it and throughout the
[1:46:56] service
[1:46:57] i thought well now now that wouldn't be
[1:47:00] from the devil
[1:47:03] and that wouldn't be for me and the
[1:47:05] devil started bringing up all the
[1:47:06] reasons i needed that cash
[1:47:09] and so i pulled it on my wall and i get
[1:47:11] i haven't put an offering for me
[1:47:15] i didn't and i felt god was saying again
[1:47:18] prove me
[1:47:18] amen prove it prove me
[1:47:23] do something that allows me the space to
[1:47:25] prove to you who i
[1:47:26] am that's what you have to do in your
[1:47:28] life you have to do stuff sometimes
[1:47:30] that sounds totally crazy just so god
[1:47:33] has room
[1:47:35] to move and do something for you
[1:47:38] and that sometimes it doesn't happen
[1:47:41] right away sometimes it takes years
[1:47:43] maybe you
[1:47:43] never see that return but god was
[1:47:45] teaching me an important lesson and just
[1:47:47] after that
[1:47:49] at work there was a situation and um
[1:47:52] i had there was i was underneath a
[1:47:53] certain what what i thought was an
[1:47:55] agreement with
[1:47:56] something prior to where we are now and
[1:47:58] and they are coming and they're asking
[1:48:00] for
[1:48:00] this thing back and and and and i really
[1:48:03] you know something that we needed that
[1:48:04] we were using and um
[1:48:07] the very next day i got a message you
[1:48:10] can keep it
[1:48:11] we're going to honor your previous
[1:48:12] agreement
[1:48:14] don't tell me that wasn't god don't tell
[1:48:18] me that wasn't god and then
[1:48:19] and then you watch god begin to to to
[1:48:21] move and so you've got to give
[1:48:23] god room to do things and you've got to
[1:48:25] do things that are crazy sometimes
[1:48:28] throughout the ages god has called men
[1:48:30] to do things that went against the
[1:48:32] accepted norm
[1:48:35] god is a disrupter
[1:48:38] you see natural always types of
[1:48:41] spiritual
[1:48:42] you have these things out in the world
[1:48:43] you know you know we go to i don't know
[1:48:45] if everybody if you've been to blaze
[1:48:46] pizza
[1:48:47] but the big thing you know go against
[1:48:49] the break all the rules
[1:48:51] unfollow the rules is their slogan
[1:48:56] natural types are spiritual christ is
[1:48:58] calling you to unfollow
[1:49:00] the rules of
[1:49:03] man and follow him
[1:49:06] i don't take that wrong praise god i
[1:49:08] just trust him that he
[1:49:09] he may have made that point the right
[1:49:11] way but sometimes god asks you to do
[1:49:13] things
[1:49:13] that go against what you know listen you
[1:49:15] only know so much you're in a little
[1:49:16] bubble
[1:49:18] some people's bubbles are bigger some
[1:49:20] people bubbles are smaller
[1:49:23] right you think you got it all figured
[1:49:26] out man
[1:49:28] hey this is what the world is everybody
[1:49:30] thinks this
[1:49:32] everybody over here thinks this okay
[1:49:33] let's figure it out man i don't need to
[1:49:35] i don't need you to tell me anything
[1:49:36] different because guess what my bubble
[1:49:38] encompasses the entire
[1:49:41] i'm sorry it especially doesn't if you
[1:49:44] were born and raised you know
[1:49:48] i'm kidding i'm okay right but if
[1:49:50] somebody grows up in a little corner of
[1:49:53] i don't know somewhere i'm not to pick
[1:49:55] any place because i don't want to offend
[1:49:56] anybody
[1:49:57] and that's all they ever know and they
[1:50:00] that they based on what they hear
[1:50:02] off of that my goodness
[1:50:06] help them lord but see we have christ
[1:50:10] and so god can can say that's why you
[1:50:12] can find somebody in a little corner of
[1:50:14] the jungle
[1:50:15] preaching about the open word because
[1:50:17] it's christ
[1:50:20] you don't need to go out there and and
[1:50:21] then google and read everything and
[1:50:24] travel to this church and this church
[1:50:26] and this church
[1:50:27] to gather and expand your bubble god
[1:50:31] will do that for you
[1:50:32] if you let him let me say let me say
[1:50:35] something this is
[1:50:36] just god put this on my heart you have
[1:50:38] to there's only
[1:50:39] if if you will say say what you have is
[1:50:43] a box
[1:50:45] if you will bear with me please because
[1:50:47] we're eternal being so
[1:50:48] but this is just to make a point god
[1:50:51] only has so much room
[1:50:54] in there if you will bear with me
[1:50:57] if you've got something in there guess
[1:50:59] what it's getting in the way
[1:51:03] god has so much he wants to give you
[1:51:07] god isn't out there it's not like you
[1:51:08] come to church and you feel condemned
[1:51:10] and
[1:51:10] and then you feel bad about yourself he
[1:51:12] goes oh i wish i could change it was
[1:51:13] like a change
[1:51:14] stop looking at that and look at it this
[1:51:18] way god has something he wants to give
[1:51:19] you that's even
[1:51:20] better amen and god is god is true to
[1:51:23] his word and he will
[1:51:25] and and he'll take
[1:51:28] and you'll get rid of all that stuff and
[1:51:31] then
[1:51:32] your box will get a little bigger and a
[1:51:34] little bigger
[1:51:35] right because your revelation is
[1:51:37] expanding praise the lord
[1:51:39] amen if the musicians would come tonight
[1:51:44] throughout the ages i'm repeating myself
[1:51:46] i know god has called men to do things
[1:51:48] that went against the accepted norm of
[1:51:50] religion
[1:51:51] the difference between them that
[1:51:55] disrupted like martin luther
[1:51:58] and countless others that disrupt the
[1:51:59] difference between them and those that
[1:52:02] missed their calling
[1:52:06] because they were too afraid the
[1:52:08] difference between those two people
[1:52:10] is the first is listening to god the
[1:52:13] second
[1:52:13] was listening to man and that's what it
[1:52:17] is
[1:52:19] and that's what guess what that man can
[1:52:21] be yourself
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:25] you say it is the biggest one you say i
[1:52:26] can't do that
[1:52:29] i can't brother richard talk about that
[1:52:31] guy that was a drunk for
[1:52:34] 80 years or whatever it was 60 years i
[1:52:36] can't do it
[1:52:37] the guy says okay but i can so get out
[1:52:40] of the way and that's what it comes down
[1:52:44] to saints
[1:52:46] that's what it comes down to i think
[1:52:48] about this all the time i don't know if
[1:52:50] it's just
[1:52:51] you know everybody has their little
[1:52:53] niche
[1:52:54] if you will it's christ
[1:52:59] that's all it is stop worrying about
[1:53:02] you know am i in the right place am i do
[1:53:05] i have the right job
[1:53:06] you know stop worrying about all that
[1:53:09] and just follow christ
[1:53:12] because guess what all of that that's
[1:53:14] why i'm here to testify i did that
[1:53:18] i just follow christ i'm not here to
[1:53:21] boast
[1:53:22] i'm here to say anything of myself i'm
[1:53:25] here to testify
[1:53:27] god does keep his word and when you say
[1:53:31] i don't care what they say
[1:53:35] i don't care what they do i'm going to
[1:53:37] follow christ
