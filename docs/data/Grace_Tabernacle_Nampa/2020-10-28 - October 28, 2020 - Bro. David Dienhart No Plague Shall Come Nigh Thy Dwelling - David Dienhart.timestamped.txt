[28:30] amen so if you'll stand with me I'd like
[28:34] to turn to the word I'd like you to turn
[28:37] with me to Psalm
[28:38] 91 start with a verse
[28:42] verse and I think I'll read Psalm 90 to
[28:46] actually to begin with and if you have a
[28:47] scull field Bible it's just right across
[28:49] the page but I'll just read Psalm 9990
[28:53] verse1 and that's a beautiful Psalm if
[28:56] you can read that sometime it's the
[28:58] prayer of Moses the man of
[29:01] God and uh Psalm 90:1 said Lord is he
[29:06] your Lord amen thou Hast been our
[29:09] Dwelling
[29:10] Place in all ver chapter 90 verse one
[29:15] chapter 90 I'm reading that first then
[29:17] 91 I'll go to 91 just after
[29:21] Lord thou Hast been our dwelling place I
[29:25] want to emphasize Dwelling Place
[29:29] in all
[29:31] generations Psalm
[29:34] 911 he that's the individual that
[29:37] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[29:41] high shall abide abide that's not in and
[29:45] out now that's live there abide there
[29:48] shall abide under the shadow of the
[29:52] Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my
[29:55] refuge and my Fortress
[29:58] my God in him will I
[30:04] trust surely he shall deliver thee From
[30:07] The Snare of the
[30:11] Fowler and from the noisome pestilence
[30:15] now those are
[30:17] plagues and those are those are F the
[30:20] Fowler one that sets a
[30:22] trap you know who that is the Trap
[30:25] Setter the thief
[30:28] he shall cover theee I want you to catch
[30:32] these words now we're talking about
[30:34] where you're dwelling he shall cover
[30:37] thee with his feathers right and under
[30:40] his wings shalt thou
[30:42] trust his truth shall be thy shield and
[30:48] buckler you know what this truth is
[30:52] that's the word that ought to be you
[30:54] ought to be grown up enough now to know
[30:57] if you're born again that that's your
[30:59] absolute there's no adding to that or
[31:01] taking from it the truth is our absolute
[31:05] all right shall come and and and see let
[31:10] me catch my where I was yeah Thou shalt
[31:12] not be afraid for the tear by
[31:15] night nor for the arrow that flyth by
[31:19] day see it's kind of speaking of our day
[31:22] isn't
[31:23] it nor the
[31:25] pestilence right Allelujah let that soak
[31:29] them in it nor for the pestilence that
[31:32] walketh in darkness notice where they're
[31:35] walking right but you're not walking
[31:38] there bride you're in the
[31:42] light for you are the child a children
[31:45] of light you're the child of God in him
[31:49] is no Darkness so if you're in God
[31:51] you're in light and light doth make
[31:53] manifest the darkness so you have
[31:55] nothing to
[31:56] fear all right
[31:58] so he shall he said nor for the
[32:01] pestilence that walketh in darkness nor
[32:03] for the destruction that
[32:05] wasteth you ever see a waster the Bible
[32:07] speaks of a waser that wasteth at
[32:14] Noonday A thousand shall fall at thy
[32:17] side 10,000 at thy right hand but it
[32:20] shall not come nigh thee why because of
[32:26] where you're dwelling right
[32:29] amen I'm making that emphasis because of
[32:31] where you're dwelling it can't come nigh
[32:33] thee it can't come nigh your dwelling
[32:37] place so you've got to know that's
[32:40] something different this old flesh
[32:41] carnal man out
[32:43] here okay we're coming down to Brass tax
[32:47] tonight get you to see your place where
[32:50] you dwell all right and then see and a
[32:54] thousand shall fall at thy side let me
[32:56] read that again 10,000 in the right hand
[32:58] but shall not come nigh thee Only With
[33:00] Thine Eyes shalt thou behold and see the
[33:03] reward of the
[33:06] wicked because thou Hast made the Lord
[33:10] which is my
[33:12] refuge the most high watch because thou
[33:16] Hast made the Lord none of these things
[33:19] because because verse n because thou
[33:22] Hast made the Lord which is my refuge
[33:25] even the most high thy
[33:29] habitation thy
[33:32] habitation all right there shall be no
[33:35] evil now why because of verse 9 because
[33:38] of verse one because of what we just
[33:40] read here for there shall no evil befall
[33:45] thee
[33:46] right neither shall any plague come nigh
[33:51] thy
[33:54] habitation Hallelujah dwelling
[34:00] kind of puts a little different picture
[34:02] I trust that you'll catch the picture
[34:05] tonight thy dwelling for he shall give
[34:08] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[34:11] in all thy
[34:13] ways now remember nothing can come upon
[34:16] your flesh but what your Shepherd
[34:20] allowed
[34:23] it but I want to reiterate no plague or
[34:28] evil can come nigh thy dwelling that's
[34:30] that's right so it sounds like it's
[34:33] contradictory but it isn't all right all
[34:37] right thou said bear thee up and they
[34:40] shall bear thee up these angels shall
[34:42] bear thee up in their hands lest thou
[34:44] Dash thy foot against the stone Thou
[34:46] shalt tread upon the lion and the adder
[34:49] the Young Lion and the dragon Thou shalt
[34:51] trample under thy feet well you know
[34:53] what thy feet is the body of Christ
[34:55] because he has set his love upon
[34:59] me therefore will I deliver him and see
[35:03] if you're in the body of Christ every
[35:04] every demon every devil every sickness
[35:07] every evil is under your feet
[35:11] already cuz that's where you
[35:13] dwell you're dwelling in the body that's
[35:16] your dwelling place we get there by one
[35:19] Spirit baptism one birthing we are
[35:22] birthed into that body whose birth the
[35:25] seed the seed is birthed amen
[35:28] the seed is quickened the seed comes to
[35:30] life remember don't forget this as we go
[35:33] on the bride is the word
[35:36] living and in action all right so you
[35:40] see for he shall give his angels charge
[35:43] they'll keep pick thee up your feet will
[35:45] cover will trample under feet the
[35:48] dragon amen amen all right Thou shalt
[35:54] said because he has set his love upon me
[35:57] therefore deliver him I will set him on
[35:59] high because he hath known my name we're
[36:03] coming down to a different scripture in
[36:04] a minute about that name known my name
[36:07] known
[36:08] it okay he shall not just just not
[36:11] mentioning a name but you know it
[36:13] because because that happens to be your
[36:16] name also that's right Hallelujah
[36:19] wherever you dwell you're one with who
[36:22] you where you're dwelling right that

[45:36] God well brother brandham happened to
[45:38] say on the on the uh the uh mighty God
[45:41] unveiled he said that's not so far off
[45:43] the truth is it it just depends on which
[45:45] side you're looking at of the veil right
[45:50] said why you make these people you make
[45:51] yourself God he said that's not so far
[45:53] off the truth is it
[45:55] brother we are minor Gods we are the
[45:58] little God we are Adam was a god Eve was
[46:02] a god they were God they were under
[46:04] their God they were who he was just in a
[46:07] smaller form as
[46:10] children all right I got to stop going
[46:13] off of these and get to the message here

[46:20] tower the righteous runneth into it and

[46:45] lifeall your dwelling
[46:47] place no plague can come nigh that
[46:50] dwelling the Lord Satan's afraid to
[46:52] touch that that's right but he can touch
[46:54] the outer man trying to get you away
[46:57] from your position get you off of it and
[46:59] God said okay go ahead I'll let you
[47:01] touch them they'll go through pressures
[47:04] outside they'll go through
[47:06] trials but where they dwell you can't
[47:08] touch that you can't hold that and
[47:11] brother sister that means everything to
[47:13] us if we'd get the revelation of who we
[47:15] are and where we dwell we wouldn't fear
[47:17] what's coming around or maybe so and
[47:19] hope so and maybe so and not
[47:21] so but but
[47:23] but but if I have to go through this if
[47:25] I have to go through that
[47:30] you went through it because God allowed
[47:31] you and ordained for you to pass through
[47:34] that but it can't touch that Dwelling
[47:41] Place amen this is only a temporary tent

[48:31] because you said it in the name of Jesus
[48:33] Christ what do you expect to get then
[48:36] the manifestation of his promise because

[49:26] nothing going to stop that word from
[49:27] being
[49:28] manifest amen now that's a whole another

[1:08:18] you come down here in a body of clay
[1:08:19] that you needed to have a birth again a
[1:08:22] new birth but you when the birth when
[1:08:23] the promised word for the season come
[1:08:25] forth and you've seen it manifested it's
[1:08:27] like that little voice on the inside of
[1:08:29] that eagle something responded to that
[1:08:31] voice because you came in contact with
[1:08:33] the voice you saw the voice manifested
[1:08:36] the word manifested through a bride
[1:08:40] Hallelujah all right I may not get
[1:08:42] through this message but I'm pretty well
[1:08:43] getting through it I'm just not reading
[1:08:45] some of the
[1:08:49] quotes now you say how do we know we're
[1:08:52] dwelling in him let's go to 1 John 4:13
[1:08:57] 1 John
[1:09:04] 4:13 chapter 4 1 John
[1:09:08] 4 and
[1:09:10] 13 hereby know
[1:09:15] we that we dwell in
[1:09:18] him and he in us because he ha given us
[1:09:23] his token
[1:09:25] that's right right that's right his
[1:09:28] Spirit that's how we know the Lord
[1:09:31] because that spirit will receive the
[1:09:32] word that Spirit has a clear
[1:09:35] understanding that spirit will lead you
[1:09:36] into all truth when you see that
[1:09:38] manifesting in you and seeing that
[1:09:40] working not something you pump up and
[1:09:42] work up and have to say Glory Hallelujah
[1:09:45] all the time to get it to
[1:09:47] operate I'm not against that please
[1:09:49] forgive me I I'm not against saying
[1:09:50] Glory Hallelujah I'm probably very
[1:09:53] vocal because I love the I love the word
[1:09:56] right but that that's not your evidence
[1:10:00] your evidence is being able to receive I
[1:10:02] already brought that forth in the last
[1:10:04] meeting the genuine EV or the meeting
[1:10:06] before that I guess genuine evidence of
[1:10:09] the Holy Ghost in you was being able to
[1:10:11] receive the word for your day and our
[1:10:14] because it's revealed to you personally
[1:10:17] and it operates and it's working
[1:10:22] right amen amen so how do we we know
[1:10:25] we're in him by his spirit that he given
[1:10:27] us we know we dwell dwell dwell dwell
[1:10:32] that's right dwell right that's your
[1:10:34] house that's your home that's your
[1:10:36] dwelling all right all
[1:10:40] right see so let's go over real quick to
[1:10:44] 2 Corinthians
[1:10:47] 4 2 Corinthians
[1:10:53] 4 and verse s but we have this treasure
[1:10:57] in Earth and vessels that the Excellency
[1:11:00] of the power may be of God and not of us
[1:11:03] you see you got to realize you're a
[1:11:06] weakling that's right God has put Talent
[1:11:09] inside of you when you were born you
[1:11:10] need to just give it to God not use it
[1:11:14] the wrong way but give it back to God
[1:11:15] put it in the bank put it in his
[1:11:18] hands but now there's talents that are
[1:11:21] you that are that are man-made talents
[1:11:23] brother Bram said God can't use those
[1:11:25] man-made
[1:11:28] talents that's right man-made
[1:11:32] intellectually made right God doesn't
[1:11:35] need he said brother Bram said God
[1:11:36] doesn't
[1:11:40] need I don't want to discourage anybody
[1:11:43] you say I could be pretty discouraging
[1:11:45] Brother David you just keep right on if
[1:11:47] you're feeling led to do what you're
[1:11:48] doing keep going
[1:11:51] right but if you're trying to produce
[1:11:53] something just remember just just
[1:11:55] remember you've got to come to this
[1:11:56] place that you're nothing and nothing
[1:11:59] plus nothing equals
[1:12:02] nothing
[1:12:04] right you're nothing without him you're
[1:12:08] nothing you can do
[1:12:11] nothing you're a nobody and nothing and
[1:12:14] and Moses had to come to that place and
[1:12:16] every one of us have to come to that
[1:12:17] place so that you can yield to him as
[1:12:21] long as you think you're something and
[1:12:23] have an ability a man made ability I
[1:12:26] know I can do this and I'll do it for
[1:12:28] him brother say he don't need that what
[1:12:30] he needs is your submission to him
[1:12:34] amen then let him guide you to do it
[1:12:37] because you know in yourself see
[1:12:39] sometimes you get so upset with yourself
[1:12:40] because you can't do it praise the lord
[1:12:44] well then just give it to God give it to
[1:12:47] God just let go and give it to God put a
[1:12:51] gift in your life give it to God and let
[1:12:53] go to it and let God use
[1:12:56] it
[1:13:01] amen well I just know I could study this
[1:13:03] and it would be usable of God no I I'm
[1:13:06] I'm
[1:13:07] sorry didn't come that
[1:13:09] way well I can take some psychology and
[1:13:12] bring it out to the people no no just
[1:13:14] leave your own psychology put it in the
[1:13:16] basket we don't need that we need
[1:13:18] revealed truth you need the word living
[1:13:21] in you'll take care of every one of your
[1:13:22] needs and your struggles and your strife
[1:13:26] let God do it we get in a hurry and
[1:13:27] think we've got to do it we've got to
[1:13:29] produce something we've got to do it
[1:13:31] that's denominationalism right am boy
[1:13:34] I'm saying some hard things tonight and
[1:13:36] I'm not afraid to offend
[1:13:38] anybody amen I don't I'm not saying that
[1:13:41] to be mean I'm not saying it to offend
[1:13:43] I'm saying it because I'm inspired to
[1:13:45] say it right amen it's the truth it's
[1:13:47] the truth then just line up with the
[1:13:49] truth say God I can't line up with the
[1:13:51] truth lord I can't that's where I want
[1:13:53] you yeah
[1:13:56] right that's where I want you I want you
[1:13:59] to let go of your cans and realize you
[1:14:01] can't and then give yourself to God and
[1:14:03] let me do it and do it the way I want to
[1:14:06] do it let me do it the sovereignly the
[1:14:08] way I want to do but Lord it might be
[1:14:09] contrary to what people think and what
[1:14:11] they how I feel in my reasoning nonsense
[1:14:14] right that's not your confidence is in
[1:14:17] your ability yourself or yourself or
[1:14:20] your reasoning or your feelings you have
[1:14:22] no confidence in that therefore we have
[1:14:24] no confidence in man amen Philippians
[1:14:30] 3:3 but we got all kinds of confidence
[1:14:33] where we dwell because we're dwelling in
[1:14:35] Christ now let me just quickly hurry
[1:14:37] through
[1:14:40] this I know you're letting me I'm just
[1:14:42] taking it all
[1:14:44] right when God and His word becomes one

[1:14:50] because I was born of Charles and Ella
[1:14:52] Branham Charlie and Ella they made me a
[1:14:54] Branham because of their seed their two
[1:14:58] agreements with their sperm Together
[1:15:00] made a seed and that made
[1:15:03] me that's natural right there had to be
[1:15:07] a ground to receive the germ from the
[1:15:09] man you understand that all right now to
[1:15:13] put it in the spiritual there had to be
[1:15:15] something there to receive right in
[1:15:19] uride and brother Bram said actually he
[1:15:21] said that seed was planted in you before
[1:15:23] the foundation of the world
[1:15:25] I've got the quote right here if you
[1:15:27] want it all right he said here he said
[1:15:30] then when God and His word becomes one
[1:15:33] God and His word becomes one when God's
[1:15:36] spirit Waters the seed of God the word
[1:15:38] of God it produces God it's not the
[1:15:44] individual
[1:15:46] wooo Glory I'm glad I'm out of the
[1:15:51] picture but the picture I'm in the
[1:15:53] picture amen

[1:16:03] and His word becomes one when God's
[1:16:05] spirit Waters the seed of God the word
[1:16:07] of God it produces God and it's not the
[1:16:09] individual it's God for what you are
[1:16:11] dead you're not yourself no more you
[1:16:13] reckon Yourself Dead hollowed out
[1:16:15] waiting for the seed germ then what is
[1:16:17] it it isn't you no more it isn't the man
[1:16:20] it's God in the man
[1:16:23] amen right
[1:16:25] right see it's the seed germ like the
[1:16:27] beginning spoken word it's God's word
[1:16:30] made manifest in the man brother Chris

[1:16:35] quote
[1:16:37] confession yeah but it wasn't just your
[1:16:42] quote I have as
[1:16:45] much hold on that as you

[1:37:56] authority over him all right now now but
[1:38:00] if you're born again you're alive in
[1:38:02] Christ you're part of him your
[1:38:05] affections are on things above and not

[1:38:12] word see flesh in you the church as it
[1:38:14] was in
[1:38:16] him what's the secret of this I won't
[1:38:18] read when he what he said and pick up
[1:38:21] your pen and write except this portion
[1:38:23] you know about the harmony you can read
[1:38:24] that Harmony to exist all right watch
[1:38:27] what he said but here's the secret of
[1:38:30] this here's the
[1:38:33] secret of this harmony here's the secret
[1:38:37] see his word the bride's going to
[1:38:38] receive it she never doubts it but
[1:38:40] here's the secret of this the word is in
[1:38:43] the
[1:38:45] bride as it was in Mary but now I want
[1:38:49] to point you to something I'm pointing
[1:38:52] this to who you are you're the word in
[1:38:55] there who is in
[1:38:58] Mary right the creative spoken creative
[1:39:01] word is that right that's you he's
[1:39:04] talking about here right Mary was the
[1:39:09] Shu he had to come out of the Shu now
[1:39:12] you see what day you're in he had to
[1:39:14] come out of the Shu but you were the
[1:39:17] word that was in that Shu you were that
[1:39:21] predestinated here's the secret the word
[1:39:23] was laying there waiting for the light
[1:39:25] to shine on it just like he said it was
[1:39:28] laying there it was birthed in there
[1:39:30] excuse me the light shined on it it was
[1:39:32] given a birth now it's still laying it
[1:39:34] may be laying in That Shook but
[1:39:38] watch he had to come out of that so he's
[1:39:41] pointing to this fact that you are that
[1:39:43] word in there the bride has the mind of
[1:39:46] Christ for she knows what he wants done
[1:39:48] with the word she performs a command of
[1:39:50] the word in his
[1:39:51] name see
[1:39:55] then when she commands the word in his
[1:39:58] name she has thus sayeth the Lord then
[1:40:00] the word is quickened by the spirit and
[1:40:01] it comes to pass like a seed that's
[1:40:04] planted and watered it comes to harvest
[1:40:06] full Harvest serving its
[1:40:09] purpose
[1:40:11] now I am closing but I've got to close
[1:40:14] with this
[1:40:16] quote I know it's
[1:40:20] 9006 you're overtime Brother David
[1:40:26] don't you know your overtime
[1:40:30] no because I got to read this one more

[1:40:37] and I this is in the message
[1:40:42] um well I I won't say what it you can
[1:40:44] look it up because I don't have the name
[1:40:47] of it right in front of me look here
[1:40:49] here's a little lady twisting herself
[1:40:51] down the street the reason I'm blaming
[1:40:53] this in here because there's a lot more
[1:40:55] plagues than just your feeling and
[1:40:57] sickness and look at the plagues of
[1:40:59] nudity oh Absolut and what's sad is
[1:41:03] walking down message
[1:41:06] aisles tight dress is so tight it shows
[1:41:08] every move they make don't tell me
[1:41:11] that's of
[1:41:12] God you're taking on The Same Spirit
[1:41:15] you're trying to compromise with the
[1:41:18] world you're trying to live between
[1:41:20] those two Realms right
[1:41:25] that's a plague that's hit a lot of the
[1:41:28] message
[1:41:29] churches but it can't come nigh your
[1:41:34] dwelling and if it can't come nigh your
[1:41:36] dwelling then take authority over that
[1:41:38] they I won't give you that place because
[1:41:39] that inside of you will stop
[1:41:42] it it won't let you do
[1:41:46] it amen it's a holy God okay now
[1:41:50] watch but here goes this lady twisting
[1:41:52] down the street Street this is for young
[1:41:54] fellows now here's a young man his eyes
[1:41:57] catches it he's a member of the church
[1:41:59] he's a Pentecostal he's whatever he is
[1:42:01] I'm glad he said that because he
[1:42:03] couldn't be a
[1:42:04] message
[1:42:07] follower therefore no now he says
[1:42:10] whatever he is but the first thing you
[1:42:12] know there's no hold poost in there
[1:42:14] what's he talking about in there the
[1:42:17] soul she'll say hello he's got her curly
[1:42:20] hair and kind of nice looking straight
[1:42:22] shouldered young man maybe tried to
[1:42:24] tried to live right she started walking
[1:42:27] up to him even a
[1:42:31] preacher the first thing you know what
[1:42:33] is it this out here this flesh desire
[1:42:36] and the spirit Little Spirit second
[1:42:38] realm the spirit down there yet
[1:42:41] anointed saying don't do it don't do it
[1:42:44] but what will it do it'll move right
[1:42:46] around there hold there it goes first
[1:42:49] thing you know he's trying to make a
[1:42:50] date with her he's com guilty of
[1:42:52] committing adultery whether he touches
[1:42:54] her or
[1:42:55] not but a genuine listen to these words
[1:42:58] I'm not going to try to preach on this I
[1:43:00] just want to read it but a genuine Born
[1:43:03] Again Son of God Amen you can't do it
[1:43:07] yourself it's totally impossible for a
[1:43:10] red-blooded male to walk before a female
[1:43:12] like that without something taking place
[1:43:14] I don't care you've got that that thing
[1:43:17] will walk there if you're not careful
[1:43:19] even a genuine child of God a Son of God
[1:43:22] there's an effect
[1:43:23] that if you gaze upon that that's going
[1:43:27] to affect your body it's going to do
[1:43:29] something you got to take your eyes off
[1:43:32] of that and the Holy Ghost in you will
[1:43:33] take your eyes off of that and don't
[1:43:36] take the second
[1:43:38] look all right are you with me okay
[1:43:41] because you know you're meeting that
[1:43:43] every single day absolutely absolutely
[1:43:50] nudity painted on us
[1:43:54] basically all right now first thing now
[1:43:57] you move around okay there it goes and a
[1:43:59] red blooded male okay without something
[1:44:01] taking place but when but when there is
[1:44:04] something on the inside he's going down
[1:44:06] the soul again that little born against
[1:44:09] something
[1:44:10] here though that man might have shouted
[1:44:13] spoken tongues jumped dance everything
[1:44:15] else Anointed with the spirit done all
[1:44:18] of the one signs and wonders that God
[1:44:20] said in here by his spirit
[1:44:23] Jesus said because why he's anointed do
[1:44:25] you see how the two Spirits can be so
[1:44:29] close you can't judge
[1:44:31] people that's not the fruit the fruit is
[1:44:35] the word for the
[1:44:37] season their teaching is what is in air
[1:44:39] these false prophets their teaching is
[1:44:42] what is in air not their not their signs
[1:44:44] and wonders not their miracles not their
[1:44:47] faith for healing it's their teaching
[1:44:49] they do not recognize the word for the
[1:44:51] season so so their teaching is false and
[1:44:54] they are false prophets they're trying
[1:44:56] to teach a season past and not the
[1:44:58] season
[1:45:01] now you don't judge the man by his signs
[1:45:04] and wonders and how much he can cast out
[1:45:05] Devils you judge him by what he lives is
[1:45:09] it the word and what he teaches if he's
[1:45:10] a preacher what he's preaching is a word
[1:45:13] for the
[1:45:16] season amen and the life he lives is the
[1:45:20] word for the season
[1:45:24] that's the fruit the fruit for the
[1:45:28] season if there's be oranges this season
[1:45:30] it'll be oranges not grapefruit not
[1:45:34] lemons not
[1:45:37] tangelos because the tree at the top has
[1:45:39] put forth another limb from the root and
[1:45:42] it's genuine orange because it's an
[1:45:44] orange
[1:45:46] tree and it's genuine Christ in you the
[1:45:50] flesh is becoming word and the word's
[1:45:52] becoming the flesh what is he saying
[1:45:54] it's coming to a body
[1:45:56] change
[1:45:57] amen all right now quickly I didn't mean
[1:46:00] to say all that many of you will come in
[1:46:03] my name saying Lord see they do all that
[1:46:06] by the same anointing the anointing is
[1:46:08] all
[1:46:10] right nothing wrong with the
[1:46:12] anointing the false is not the anointing
[1:46:14] the false is what they are in the
[1:46:17] soul it's not the word it's not the word
[1:46:20] it's not the seed right the seed is what
[1:46:24] makes the
[1:46:31] difference why couldn't Cain receive the
[1:46:34] Vindicated word right before him because
[1:46:37] he was not God's
[1:46:39] seed he wasn't Adam
[1:46:43] seed all right see you can't put that in
[1:46:48] there but if there's a call in your
[1:46:50] heart I've got to have God as a young
[1:46:53] person I want him you didn't put that
[1:46:55] there you couldn't put the desire there
[1:46:58] there's something in you working that
[1:46:59] you as a young man don't know nothing
[1:47:01] about and it's working despite
[1:47:05] yourself it's working in you there's
[1:47:08] something that keeps drawing you to the
[1:47:09] word well I don't understand it you said
[1:47:11] you didn't say you had to understand it
[1:47:13] do you believe
[1:47:15] it God will take care of the revealing
[1:47:18] of
[1:47:20] it amen there's something in you I can't
[1:47:23] get away from this this is right I know
[1:47:25] this is
[1:47:28] truth you didn't put that there you
[1:47:31] didn't put the desire for God in
[1:47:33] you though you're pressured out here to
[1:47:36] try to do this and that and reason with
[1:47:38] it okay I know I'm
[1:47:40] late not too
[1:47:42] late right on
[1:47:45] time I only heard one amen that's all
[1:47:48] right all right many of you will come in
[1:47:51] that day and say Lord haven't I Prof
[1:47:52] prophesied in your name haven't I cast
[1:47:55] out devils in your name it's all true
[1:47:58] nobody can cast out a devil but God you
[1:48:01] know Satan can't cast out
[1:48:06] Satan nobody can heal but
[1:48:10] God but what are those false prophets
[1:48:12] and teachers working under that
[1:48:15] Spirit right but false in their teaching
[1:48:19] do you understand see how close the two
[1:48:21] Spirits are see one's a denominational
[1:48:24] Affair an organizational Affair that won
[1:48:26] not and cannot and will not receive the
[1:48:28] word for the hour and the time that's
[1:48:30] right and take offense to it and the
[1:48:33] other is a pure word and loves
[1:48:37] it because it's
[1:48:39] Christ
[1:48:43] again okay I'm
[1:48:45] closing that's that's I'm closing but
[1:48:48] down the inside of that man see depart
[1:48:50] from me I don't know you you've done all
[1:48:52] this but I don't know you workers of
[1:48:54] iniquity you know something you should
[1:48:56] do and you don't do it see just like
[1:48:58] Cain just like Esau just like on and on
[1:49:00] and on but down on the inside of that
[1:49:03] man Soul realm is that little TI poost
[1:49:06] in there that seat of God that was
[1:49:08] predestinated before the foundational
[1:49:09] world I don't care what takes place it
[1:49:12] holds him it's there to
[1:49:17] stay praise the Lord how many say praise
[1:49:19] the lord it's there to stay is that
[1:49:24] wonderful you hold that
[1:49:26] revelation of Christ in you it's there
[1:49:29] to stay there enough not enough devils
[1:49:32] in Hell could get you to stop that or
[1:49:35] get you even out of your
[1:49:40] position all
[1:49:44] right it's there to stay praise the
[1:49:49] Lord and when God hides anything
[1:49:52] it's act it's really
[1:49:55] hid listen to David and I'm closing on
[1:49:58] this listen to David here what he said
[1:50:00] in Psalms
[1:50:05] 27 when God hides anything it's hid
[1:50:08] that's all there is to it when God hides
[1:50:11] anything it's
[1:50:12] hid Tim I didn't mean I understand if
[1:50:16] you got to go I was goofing with you but
[1:50:20] I think you took a little offense to it
[1:50:21] and I don't blame you for doing it okay
[1:50:24] but but I think it doesn't hurt you and
[1:50:26] I just I I felt enough for you that I
[1:50:29] think you need to hear the rest of it as
[1:50:31] with myself I'm not talking about just
[1:50:33] you Psalm 27 but I know God will take
[1:50:37] care of that boy's
[1:50:38] sleep you watch and see if he doesn't
[1:50:41] you honor his word he'll honor you all
[1:50:44] right Psalm
[1:50:46] 27 verse four one thing I desired of the
[1:50:50] Lord that will I seek after that I may
[1:50:51] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[1:50:54] days of my
[1:50:58] life now we could go right on the what
[1:51:01] is the house Body of Christ yes sir
[1:51:03] that's right you're birth in there what
[1:51:06] is the body of Christ it's all Christ
[1:51:07] every member is all Christ all
[1:51:10] right all the days of my life to behold
[1:51:13] the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in
[1:51:15] his Temple who' we say that who brother
[1:51:17] BR say the temple your temple
[1:51:19] was for in the time of trouble is this
[1:51:22] the time of trouble he shall hide me in
[1:51:24] his Pavilion hide me in his
[1:51:28] [Music]

[1:51:36] shall he hide me he's not going to hide
[1:51:37] me just out the open going hide me in
[1:51:39] the secret he shall hide me the revealed
[1:51:41] word is a secret He Shall Set me upon a
[1:51:45] revealed word
[1:51:46] Rock
[1:51:49] okay now when God hides anything it's
[1:51:51] really hid that's reason you're so hid
[1:51:53] if you're a Christian you're so dead and
[1:51:55] your life is so hid in God through Jesus
