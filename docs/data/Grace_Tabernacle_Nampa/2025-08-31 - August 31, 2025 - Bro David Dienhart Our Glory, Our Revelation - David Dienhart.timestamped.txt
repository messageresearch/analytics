[9:56] only for
[9:59] heavenly father.
[10:02] I appreciate
[10:05] you.
[10:10] Heavenly Father,
[10:12] I appreciate
[10:16] you.
[10:21] Heavenly Father,
[10:23] I appreciate
[10:27] you.
[10:32] I love you.
[10:35] Adore you.
[10:37] I bow down
[10:40] before you. Heavenly Father,
[10:45] I appreciate
[10:49] you.
[10:50] [Music]
[10:53] Holy Spirit,
[10:56] you're a comfort
[10:58] to me.
[11:04] Holy Spirit,
[11:07] you're a comfort
[11:09] to me.
[11:15] You lead me.
[11:18] You guide me.
[11:20] You're dwelling
[11:23] inside me. Holy Spirit,
[11:28] you're a comfort
[11:31] to me.
[11:35] Amen.
[11:37] You say that this morning. See your
[11:39] comfort. You appreciate him. Praise God.
[11:42] It's good to be here. Good to see each
[11:44] one here this morning. Amen.
[11:48] I'd like to start with number 447. He
[11:50] abides.
[11:57] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[12:02] the pilgrim way for the hand of God in
[12:06] all my life I see.
[12:10] And the reason of my bliss, yes, the
[12:14] secret is this, that the comforter
[12:18] abides with me.
[12:22] He abides.
[12:25] He abides.
[12:28] Halleluah. He abides with me.
[12:34] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[12:38] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[12:43] with me.
[12:46] Once my heart was full of sin. Once I
[12:50] had no peace within, till I heard how
[12:54] Jesus died upon the tree.
[12:58] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[13:02] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[13:06] abides with me.
[13:10] He abides.
[13:13] He abides.
[13:16] Halleluah. He abides with me.
[13:22] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[13:26] the pilgrim way. And comfort abides with
[13:32] me.
[13:34] He is with me everywhere and he knows my
[13:39] every care. I'm as happy as a bird and
[13:43] just as free.
[13:46] For the spirit has control. Jesus
[13:50] satisfies my soul since a comforter
[13:54] abides with me.
[13:58] He abides.
[14:01] He abides.
[14:04] Halleluah. He abides with me.
[14:10] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[14:14] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[14:19] with me.
[14:22] There's no thirsting for the things of
[14:26] the world. They've taken wings. Long ago
[14:29] I gave them up and instantly.
[14:34] All my night was turned to day. All my
[14:38] burdens rolled away. Now the comforter
[14:42] abides with me.
[14:46] He abides.
[14:49] He abides.
[14:52] Halleluah. He abides with me.
[14:58] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[15:02] the pilgrim way. Oh, the comforter
[15:06] abides with me.
[15:11] Amen.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know that last
[15:15] verse?
[15:17] Go jump to that real quick. I get the
[15:19] words messed up here.
[15:23] Long ago, I gave them up and instantly,
[15:26] you know, when we turn it over to God,
[15:28] we quit trying to do it. You commit it
[15:31] to him. He's going to take it away. He's
[15:32] going to take care of that for you. And
[15:34] I was just the reason I don't know this
[15:36] song popped into my head because I was
[15:38] just for some reason thinking about I
[15:40] used to have a smoking and drinking
[15:42] problem and I remember my mom was like
[15:46] you know she she raised me right and uh
[15:50] I tried I remember one time in my car I
[15:52] was like I'm done smoking I threw him
[15:54] out the window you guess what I was
[15:55] doing the next day but when I gave it to
[15:58] God amen he took care of that for me it
[16:00] I have no desire whatsoever for those
[16:03] things Amen. Praise the Lord for that.
[16:06] Amen.
[16:08] Amen. Number 441.
[16:10] So now I know where I'm headed.
[16:13] [Laughter]
[16:15] [Music]
[16:18] On Jordan's stormy banks I stand and
[16:24] cast a wishful eye
[16:29] toward Canaan's fair and happy land
[16:34] where my possessions
[16:38] lie.
[16:40] I am bound for the promised land.
[16:45] [Music]
[16:46] bound for the promised land.
[16:51] Oh, who will come and go with me? I am
[16:57] bound for the promised land.
[17:02] For all those wide extended
[17:07] plains shine one eternal day.
[17:14] There God the sun forever
[17:18] rains and scatters night of way.
[17:24] I am bound for the promised land.
[17:30] I am bound for the promised land.
[17:35] Oh who will come and go with me? I am
[17:41] bound for the promise land.
[17:46] No chilling winds nor poisonous breath
[17:52] can reach that healthful shore.
[17:57] Sickness and sorrow. Pain and death are
[18:03] feared and felt no more.
[18:08] I am bound for the prois land.
[18:14] I'm bound for the prois land.
[18:19] Oh, who will come and go with me? I am
[18:25] bound for the promised land.
[18:30] When shall I reach that happy place and
[18:36] be forever
[18:39] bless?
[18:41] When shall I see my father's face and in
[18:48] his bosom
[18:52] I am bound for the promised land.
[18:58] bound for the promised land.
[19:03] Oh, who will come and go with me? I am
[19:09] bound for the promised land. One more
[19:12] time.
[19:14] I am bound for the promised land.
[19:19] Am bound for the promised land.
[19:24] Oh, who will come and go with me? I am
[19:30] bound for the promised land.
[19:36] Amen.
[19:38] Amen. Praise God.
[19:41] Amen. Number 497,

[21:21] A wonderful
[21:24] Savior
[21:26] is Jesus
[21:28] my Lord.
[21:31] He taketh my burden
[21:36] away.
[21:40] He holdeth me up and I shall not be
[21:48] moved.
[21:50] He giveth
[21:52] me strength as my day.
[21:59] He hideth
[22:01] my soul
[22:03] in the cliff
[22:06] of the rock
[22:08] that shadows
[22:10] a dry thirsty
[22:13] land.

[22:55] and filled with his fullness
[23:00] divine.
[23:04] I sing in my rapture.
[23:09] Oh, glory
[23:11] to God
[23:13] for such
[23:16] a redeemer
[23:18] as mine.
[23:22] He hideth
[23:25] my soul
[23:27] in the cl
[23:29] of the rock

[28:21] more than able.
[28:23] [Music]
[28:29] Lord bless you guys, saints.
[28:31] [Music]
[28:33] Heavenly Father, thank you Lord Jesus
[28:36] for this morning, this lovely morning.
[28:38] Lord, not just because the sun is
[28:40] shining, Lord Jesus, because but because
[28:43] the sun s o n is shining in our hearts.
[28:48] I trust each one of us, Lord,
[28:51] has been drawn here by inspiration,
[28:53] Father.
[28:56] And so we come here hungry. We come here
[29:00] needy,
[29:02] asking for you to meet us, Lord Jesus.
[29:04] And we believe that you will,
[29:08] Lord Jesus, you've heard the
[29:10] requests that were spoken here, Father.
[29:12] And we just ask that for each one, that
[29:14] you be gracious to each one,
[29:18] Father. Brother Paul preaching, I pray
[29:20] that you just be with him this morning
[29:21] and the saints there in Salt Lake.
[29:22] Father, just have your way with them.
[29:25] Speak to their hearts, Lord. Speak to
[29:26] every need. We pray, Lord Jesus.
[29:30] Lord, and these who are not feeling
[29:32] well, Father, we just ask that you be
[29:34] with them or who are needing a touch
[29:37] &gt;&gt; in their hearts for their health, Lord.
[29:42] You know who they are, Father. You know
[29:44] the hearts of the children that have
[29:46] these petitions on their hearts, Father.
[29:48] And we just lift them up before you,
[29:50] Father, and ask for your grace, for your
[29:52] mercy, Lord, for your healing power,
[29:57] for every unspoken request. and I have
[30:00] my own, Father. And for every uplifted
[30:02] hand, Father, we just commit those to
[30:04] you, Lord Jesus. And give us hearts to
[30:07] receive the answer when you give it,
[30:09] Lord. And perhaps it's not what we
[30:11] expect, but Lord, we know that you will
[30:13] answer.
[30:16] We bless the remainder of this service,
[30:18] Father. Just ask that you'd be with our

[32:00] How much torment
[32:04] suffering

[32:10] My beloved
[32:12] Jesus Christ gave his life on the cross.
[32:19] He accepted
[32:22] all the pain and grief.
[32:29] I could never
[32:32] forget
[32:33] that old rugged cross.
[32:38] It stands
[32:41] between heaven
[32:44] and the earth.
[32:48] By his death, Christ reconiled
[32:54] us to the creatator
[32:57] and redeemed
[33:00] us by his precious blood.
[33:07] Make me Lord to know the mystery
[33:14] of your love which you brought to us on

[33:31] and firmly
[33:33] on the earth midst the storm
[33:40] among tears.

[39:18] is filling my heart as I sing. How great
[39:23] are you Lord?
[39:27] How great is your love

[41:15] how great and kindness
[41:21] is filling my heart as I sing. How great
[41:26] are you, Lord?
[41:33] God bless you this morning.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to see everyone with us. More
[41:39] came out than I thought would,
[41:42] but we're grateful. God bless you,
[41:44] brother, sister, from up there around
[41:47] Sandp Point. And we're thankful for
[41:49] everything that God has given us. And
[41:51] we're here happy to be in the house of
[41:53] the Lord this morning. But the greater
[41:56] revelation is we are in the house of the
[41:59] Lord.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; We are his house.
[42:02] and that we have come here as an example
[42:05] of assembling together. And I believe
[42:08] the portion of the body is right here
[42:10] this morning assembled together. But
[42:12] we're in his house. His house
[42:16] is the bride.
[42:18] The Bible said, "You are his house."
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're thankful for that and
[42:24] thankful for the mercy of God to reveal
[42:26] himself to us. I had quite a intensive
[42:29] battle bringing this getting this
[42:31] together and still don't know how it's
[42:32] going to come out. I'm depending and I
[42:35] have depended and always depend on the
[42:37] Lord. He's always on time.
[42:39] And uh God knows exactly what you need.
[42:43] If you've come here to focus on a man,
[42:46] you'll go away disappointed. But if
[42:48] you'll take your focus off of me and
[42:50] bring your focus on the word that's here
[42:52] in your midst, you won't go away
[42:54] disappointed. If you'll pull on him, God
[42:57] will speak back to you.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm nothing but just a servant to
[43:03] serve God, to serve the people. And I
[43:06] have nothing in myself as a man to do
[43:08] anything. And but I know God's on time.
[43:12] And I
[43:16] I know he's willing to speak to our
[43:18] hearts.
[43:19] So God bless you this morning. Musicians
[43:22] can thank you for the song service.
[43:25] appreciate it. Thank you for this
[43:27] special.
[43:29] It certainly was the blood that redeemed
[43:30] us.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that?
[43:35] &gt;&gt; But there's another part of redemption
[43:38] and that's coming to claim what he
[43:40] redeemed.
[43:42] You know, he he didn't do the claiming
[43:43] then. He paid the price for your
[43:45] redemption then as a mediator through
[43:47] the ages. But in the end here,
[43:51] the book had to be opened. Amen.
[43:55] And that was his book.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; And that was our book.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That had to be opened
[44:03] &gt;&gt; in this day. He had to claim what he
[44:06] purchased.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; And that's the great mystery of our day
[44:10] and our hour
[44:12] is those people that he claimed
[44:15] are coming alive and maturing
[44:18] &gt;&gt; in himself.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because it had to be he had to come
[44:24] forth a headstone which we see the
[44:27] picture made of him in 1963
[44:31] in Sunset Mountain. Who was that? It was
[44:35] a sign in the heaven. The headstone
[44:37] coming to unite with his bride. The
[44:39] ministry of himself would be opened
[44:42] &gt;&gt; in bride form.
[44:44] And so this is a great a great thing
[44:49] &gt;&gt; to be assembled today in our day and to
[44:52] see a message like this of his coming
[44:55] &gt;&gt; and no brother sister don't know I can
[44:58] stand here before you I don't know who's
[44:59] making it and who don't but there's one
[45:01] thing I'm certain of and can know and
[45:03] you too personally you can know
[45:07] &gt;&gt; and God can reveal this to you and you
[45:10] know that you know
[45:13] &gt;&gt; and you become I'm burdened for the
[45:14] people because you don't know. And let
[45:16] me say this right off the get-go. Only
[45:18] the predestinated seed can know
[45:22] &gt;&gt; and have the revelation of this hour.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Only the predestinated seed because they
[45:28] were in him
[45:30] before the foundation of the world.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; They were in him when he came to give
[45:36] his life for you and I.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me say this. Everything
[45:41] you and I have need of being that seed.
[45:44] Everything is in that seed.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Everything that that you will that will
[45:50] be manifest. Everything the bride is to
[45:52] manifest. Everything you are to manifest
[45:54] personally in that body is in that seed
[45:57] already.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; You see, you don't realize the bride
[46:00] realizing it though she'd done made it.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; She's already risen with him.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[46:10] That's why she's certain of the
[46:11] resurrection
[46:13] &gt;&gt; because that rapture is in her to be
[46:16] manifested.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; So, thanks be to God. Stand with me if
[46:21] you will this morning. And I hope you
[46:23] prayed for me because remember, I'm not
[46:26] up here to tell you what I think. I pray
[46:29] God will just speak his word, speak his
[46:31] will, and it will move your heart
[46:36] because this isn't a group affair. This
[46:38] is an individual affair,
[46:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do assemble in a group here, but
[46:42] it's an individual affair.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; God is pulling out himself,
[46:47] making himself known.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; That's what the seals were about.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's to make himself known.
[46:56] He unveiled himself.
[46:58] And only the bride, only his wife can
[47:00] come to that unveiling, can see that
[47:04] unveiling.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when he unveils himself,
[47:07] he don't unveil himself to everybody.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; He unveils himself to his bride, his
[47:12] wife. That's right.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what she's a partaker of in
[47:15] this hour day. I know that seems strange
[47:18] to some people, very radical. You think,
[47:20] "Well, brother David, you speak too
[47:22] deep." No, it's just speaking too too
[47:25] simple.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Because the deepness of God is
[47:30] simplicity.
[47:33] It's so simple that you and your
[47:35] intellects cannot know it.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; It takes the divine revelation given by
[47:39] God for you to see it. That's what God
[47:42] has preserved.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; That he would make himself known to his
[47:48] people.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; And what is it? He's making himself
[47:52] known to himself.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Our heavenly father, how
[47:59] grateful we are to stand and to me
[48:03] standing, quivering, shaking, but
[48:05] knowing that anointing is coming upon
[48:07] me. Lord, I just receive it. I pray that
[48:12] you would take the words that are spoken
[48:14] this morning and bring them real, Lord,
[48:17] to such a reality,
[48:20] to such a realization
[48:23] to your little bride of her position,
[48:26] her positive position in this hour, to
[48:29] let her see where she's standing, Lord,
[48:32] because the seals were open. The mystery
[48:35] of who she was, the mystery of himself
[48:37] in bride form, the mystery was made
[48:40] known. Those seals held that mystery.
[48:44] That seventh seal was the mystery
[48:47] Lord revealed. And Lord, that little
[48:50] bride is that mystery.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Her names were in that book. That
[48:57] mystery unlocked who she is. And Lord,
[49:00] your prophet said that on page two,
[49:02] paragraph 12 of Rising of the Sun. He
[49:05] said he's the one that opened that
[49:07] mystery. And what is it? It's the bride
[49:09] seeing where she come from, who she was
[49:11] in, how she would be manifest, and how
[49:14] she would be known in the end.
[49:17] Oh God, what a great revelation. What
[49:21] does it do for your little bride,
[49:22] Father? Oh, what it gives us is such an
[49:24] expectation. We don't know, but what's
[49:27] right here this morning? Loved ones
[49:29] could walk into this room.
[49:31] Who would see them? Your bride would see
[49:34] them. We don't know how they're going to
[49:36] meet. We don't know when they're going
[49:37] to meet, but Lord, we know we're going
[49:38] to meet them.
[49:41] May this revelation come to every
[49:42] individual, Father, to realize they are
[49:45] a part of you, always was, and that they
[49:49] are the logos revealed beneath the rema.
[49:53] They are the unveiled word in the word.
[49:56] Yeah.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray that you'd grant it
[49:59] as I ask this in thy name, the Lord
[50:01] Jesus Christ, giving this myself fully
[50:04] to you to say things that David knows
[50:06] nothing about,
[50:09] Lord, and realize it's the seed of God
[50:11] among us. It's Jesus Christ among us,
[50:14] friends,
[50:16] unveiling his word to his people.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; We give you praise for this reality in
[50:22] Jesus' name. Amen.
[50:25] Wow.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; All right. I'd like you to turn with you
[50:29] me in your Bibles to Psalm 62.
[50:33] Just start a scripture here.
[50:40] And I just go on in the word as we feel
[50:42] like the Lord would have us to read. And
[50:46] this has been a very unusual time for me
[50:48] the last couple two or three days. And
[50:50] yet out in prayer two or three days ago,
[50:52] this was revealed so simple.
[50:55] It's so clear when you go to bring it,
[50:57] it's like you're telling a story.
[51:01] It's strange,
[51:03] but it's there. And God knows how to
[51:06] speak it, knows how to reveal it, knows
[51:09] how to give it to you. How many will
[51:10] trust him?
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; That you're not here by chance this
[51:13] morning. you're here because God brought
[51:15] you here and he give you and will open
[51:19] his word to you if you're willing to
[51:21] receive him. But you've got to let go of
[51:23] yourself.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure this out. You can't
[51:27] figure it out. I'm going to tell you
[51:28] right now, the message of the hour
[51:31] cannot be figured out.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; There's not enough study to give it to
[51:35] you.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; But there's a hunger in your heart and
[51:38] there's a pull towards God. There's an
[51:40] answer to that pull
[51:42] &gt;&gt; and we have the answer to it.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; How many believe we've had a we have a
[51:47] perfect interpretation of the word by a
[51:49] vindicated prophet.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Then don't you try to add to that or
[51:53] take from it.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; This message is the perfect
[51:57] interpretation of the word. These seven
[52:00] thunders could not be made known. We
[52:02] need to know, the prophet said, but
[52:03] it'll take a vindicated prophet to bring
[52:06] it out.
[52:07] Then who's it going to be revealed to?
[52:10] Those that are in him, his seed.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying who is and who isn't. I
[52:16] don't know. I'm just thankful for the
[52:18] revelation to know that I am his seed.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; And his seed will conquer every gate of
[52:25] the enemy.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; They're already more than conquerors.
[52:28] You don't fight a battle. We're fighting
[52:29] a battle. I fought a tremendous battle
[52:31] to be here this morning. But you're not
[52:34] fighting a battle to get victory. You
[52:37] already have victory.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; You're just here to manifest victory
[52:45] &gt;&gt; because our victory is our faith
[52:49] &gt;&gt; and our faith in us. The believer is the
[52:52] faith of God
[52:54] &gt;&gt; in you moving.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 68, perfect faith. He said,
[52:59] "The believer is the faith of God moving
[53:02] in you."
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. So
[53:08] Psalm 62, we could read the whole
[53:11] chapter. Beautiful chapter. I've gone to
[53:13] this many, many times. But verse seven,
[53:16] in God is my salvation
[53:21] and my glory,
[53:24] the rock of my strength
[53:27] and my refuge is in God.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Let me read it one more time. In God is
[53:36] my salvation.
[53:39] You believe that this morning?
[53:42] I ought to hear an amen from everybody
[53:44] this morning. In God is your salvation.
[53:46] What are you looking for for salvation?
[53:48] Who are you looking to?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's your salvation.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; He was manifested in some form. He was
[53:57] the one that died for you. He was the
[53:59] one that bled for you. Amen. Is that
[54:01] right? He's the one that paid the
[54:03] penalty of death. He paid the penalty of
[54:05] the law. He fulfilled the law. Amen. In
[54:08] his son. What was this son? Himself. The
[54:12] fullness of himself.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Then where were you then?
[54:17] You're his seed. Where were you? He's
[54:19] the seed.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Then you had to be in him.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Then when he died, you died with him.
[54:24] When he rose, you rose with him.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; You've already risen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "What do you mean
[54:35] by that? You've done pass from death to
[54:38] life.
[54:40] So in God is my salvation and my glory.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; My glory. Who's my glory?
[54:48] The Lord is my glory. Amen. Who's his
[54:52] glory?
[54:54] You are his glory.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; You say prove that. The Bible said the h
[54:59] the wife is the glory of her husband.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Jesus said, "I give them
[55:04] my glory." Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Chapter 17 of John said, "I give you I
[55:08] give them my glory. I give to you my
[55:10] glory. My glory is given to them."
[55:13] &gt;&gt; And he said he wouldn't share his glory
[55:15] with another. But the bride is not
[55:17] another.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; She's himself. She's the word. She's the
[55:23] seed. She's Christ manifested.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And if Christ be in you, I make it
[55:28] through this message quicker than I
[55:30] thought. If Christ be in you,
[55:33] I'm going to have you be seated just a
[55:35] second. It won't hurt you to stand. If
[55:37] Christ be in you, then the revelation of
[55:39] God is manifested in you.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Christ in you is God great revelation.
[55:44] Christ in you is who you are.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; That's the new birth.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; That's the birth word. Christ is the
[55:55] mystery of God revealed. So Christ in
[55:58] you would be the mystery of God revealed
[56:00] in you.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; All right. So, you may be seated. I want
[56:10] you to turn with me to Revelation 10.
[56:18] Herein
[56:22] is our message.
[56:27] You know that there do you realize that
[56:29] there's a little book in the book?
[56:34] &gt;&gt; That's called the bride book.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; There's a little book in the book in
[56:39] there's a little book within the lamb's
[56:41] book of life.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that steady because
[56:45] because we we've been through it. I took
[56:47] a whole series on that.
[56:49] about two years ago. But there's a
[56:51] little book within that book and that
[56:55] little book is only it's the it's the
[56:58] wedding or marriage certificate. The
[57:01] prophet said it's the marriage
[57:02] certificate.
[57:04] It show it reveals who he marries.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; It reveals the names of his bride
[57:13] &gt;&gt; by revealing the mystery of himself. The
[57:16] full mystery. It's the full mystery of
[57:18] God. It was sealed on the backside. So,
[57:20] let's read this before I go too far.
[57:22] Revelations chapter 10.
[57:25] No, let let me just read this first.
[57:27] Revelations 5 51. And I
[57:34] Yes. No, I'm just going to read. I'll
[57:36] come back to that. Revelations 10. I'm
[57:38] sorry. I'm just I've got to follow.
[57:42] It may seem like it's a little jerky in
[57:44] this, but I just want to follow what he
[57:45] does here. Revelation 10 verse one. I
[57:49] saw another mighty angel come down from
[57:51] heaven clothed with a cloud. Amen. How
[57:53] many would say amen?
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many would realize that that's
[57:59] what he said would happen in Acts 1
[58:01] verse 9-11.
[58:04] He would return again the way the same
[58:06] way he left.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Clothed in a cloud, hidden in a cloud.
[58:10] He would come again that same way.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Then what are we beholding?
[58:16] We are being prepared to meet him in the
[58:18] air.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; How are we being prepared? Because the
[58:23] the head is uniting with the body.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; It's an invisible union. It's a
[58:27] marriage.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; And we're growing into that maturity of
[58:34] himself.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; This is the message of the hour. This is
[58:37] the opening of the seals. This is that
[58:41] latter rain.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We grow, we drink, we drink, we
[58:46] drink. Where are we growing into? The
[58:48] full stature of himself.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Because in order to finish the mystery,
[58:53] Jesus Christ had to be manifest in bride
[58:55] form.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; And there you are. So now we know that
[59:03] Revelation 10, I seen this mighty angel
[59:06] come down from heaven clothed with the
[59:08] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head.
[59:10] We find that in Revelations 1, John
[59:14] speaking, giving the oversight of the
[59:16] whole revelation. Then begins in the
[59:18] church ages, he's seeing, he's writing
[59:20] what he sees. But notice he said, "I was
[59:22] in the spirit on the Lord's day and
[59:25] turned to look, turned to see the voice
[59:27] that spoke with me. And having been
[59:29] turned, I see seven candlesticks.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I see seven church ages. And then
[59:35] one in the midst of those seven church
[59:37] ages, clothed in a garment like a woman.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the prophet said.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; He said she he was clothed not in a
[59:46] man's garment, clothed in a woman's
[59:48] garment because the son of man was being
[59:50] manifest mediating mediatorial through
[59:53] those seven ages. Amen. I'm going to
[59:56] come to that down here in just a minute.
[59:57] He had to mediate for what he purchased.
[1:00:00] He had to be an intercessor for what he
[1:00:02] purchased. He had to be on the throne of
[1:00:04] his purchase. But here's John seeing
[1:00:06] him. He was he had a white wig on. He He
[1:00:09] was a sun shining in its strength. Amen.
[1:00:12] Is that right? And when John, the type
[1:00:14] of the bride, saw him, he fell as a dead
[1:00:15] man.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; That's a good place to begin right
[1:00:18] there. Let it let yourself die to
[1:00:21] yourself and die to the fact of what you
[1:00:23] are and see him.
[1:00:26] see him manifested. See him. Amen. All
[1:00:29] right. So, so he he we I just we bring
[1:00:33] that in. Then at right at the end, he
[1:00:34] begins to say what the seven stars were,
[1:00:37] what the seven candlesticks are, and
[1:00:38] then he begins right into the message of
[1:00:40] the church ages. Is that right?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; But at the end of the church at the
[1:00:45] seventh church age, he now has another
[1:00:47] turn
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; and he calls the bridegroom has made
[1:00:50] himself known and caught the attention.
[1:00:53] Now it comes to that third pull of the
[1:00:55] opening of the word.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. First pull, second pull was to get
[1:00:59] the attention of the bride. Is that
[1:01:01] right?
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; But the third pull would catch the
[1:01:03] bride.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; And that's the opening of that hidden
[1:01:07] sealed word.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; I'll go that any further than that
[1:01:12] because I'm going to tell you that word
[1:01:14] who that word was that was sealed.
[1:01:18] The Bible makes it very clear. And that
[1:01:20] word would be sealed up to the end. But
[1:01:22] at the message of the seventh angel of
[1:01:25] Revelation 10, his message was the
[1:01:27] seventh seal made known. Made known.
[1:01:30] Amen. That's exactly what it was.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; And it's it's one mystery. Mysteries
[1:01:35] revealing a mystery.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Because notice in Revelation 10:7, it
[1:01:42] said the mystery of God would be
[1:01:44] finished.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Not mysteries, mystery. But it took
[1:01:48] those seven mysteries in every one of
[1:01:50] those ages. A mystery, a me a mystery
[1:01:53] coming forth. What? To do what? To bring
[1:01:55] to full maturity, a headship. God and
[1:01:59] his bride is one.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. So, there was a sealed
[1:02:06] book. We know we know the the whole book
[1:02:09] was sealed, but there's a there's a
[1:02:11] there's there's a Well, let me just I'm
[1:02:14] trying to get ahead of myself. Let me
[1:02:16] hold back here.
[1:02:18] All right. Verse two. No. and and and in
[1:02:22] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow in
[1:02:24] his head and his face that were the sun
[1:02:26] and his feet as pillars of fire. Same
[1:02:28] thing John saw in Revelations 1.
[1:02:32] All right. Then because what was he
[1:02:35] speaking of? That which was which is and
[1:02:37] shall come.
[1:02:40] Amen. John was witness of that.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; The bride is witness of that.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. All right. So we see
[1:02:50] here in verse
[1:02:53] two, and he had in his hand a little
[1:02:56] book open.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Verse five was closed until he took the
[1:03:01] book.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; And when he took the book, what was
[1:03:05] written in that book now opened.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And he cried. He said he had a little
[1:03:11] book in his hand. He said, "Behold, in
[1:03:13] his hand, he had a little book open. And
[1:03:16] he set his right foot upon the sea, and
[1:03:19] his left foot upon the earth, and cried
[1:03:21] with a loud voice, as when a lion roar,
[1:03:23] and when he had cried, seven thunders
[1:03:25] uttered their voices.
[1:03:27] Amen. And the revelation of the seventh
[1:03:30] seal went to those seven thunders. So,
[1:03:32] brother Ram said, see, it's connected
[1:03:33] together.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; And John was forbidden to write. We can
[1:03:38] go to the scripture. We know he was
[1:03:39] forbidden to write what those thunders
[1:03:41] said.
[1:03:43] And it couldn't be known until the
[1:03:44] message of the seventh angel.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. What they said, but what they
[1:03:51] said, Satan can't get.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; If they said it, if he written before
[1:03:56] that, he would try to pervert it.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Try to put his own interpretation to it.
[1:04:02] But this is one thing he can't get.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Because he can't know it,
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] Only the elect seed can know this.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; All right. So, just hold that in mind.
[1:04:17] Only the predestinated seed is going to
[1:04:20] know the secret of Revelation 8:1.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a mystery, but when it's
[1:04:28] revealed, it's now a secret that the
[1:04:30] public doesn't know. And the public, you
[1:04:33] say, "Well, who's the public?" The
[1:04:35] public is everyone that's not bride.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm not saying who's bride and
[1:04:41] who isn't. I'm telling you that's the
[1:04:44] scripture.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; I hope every one of us are in here.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; I'm believing that with all my heart.
[1:04:50] I'm not putting anybody in. I can't put
[1:04:52] anybody out. I couldn't even put my own
[1:04:54] self in.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Or out.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; But because he revealed and is revealed
[1:05:02] to individuals that they always were in
[1:05:04] him.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no way to get out of him.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; There's nothing can take you out of him.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; When he rose, you rose with him.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; You have nothing to grumble, nothing to
[1:05:17] murmur about, nothing. Because God in
[1:05:19] all thing, I don't care how how hot the
[1:05:22] battle is, how great the battle is, God
[1:05:24] has control absolutely of every bit of
[1:05:27] that and has a purpose in you going
[1:05:29] through it.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; He's got an eternal purpose. You're not
[1:05:34] by here by chance. God has made has a
[1:05:37] purpose for you, an eternal purpose.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And he's going to he's going to fulfill
[1:05:46] that purpose.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; You can't be anything but what that seat
[1:05:51] is.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's exactly
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; there's been two seeds all along,
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; but Abel by revelation knew to do
[1:06:02] something different than the other seed.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Abel was the seed of God.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which was the seed of his father
[1:06:10] Adam.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Cain Adam was not Cain, excuse me, was
[1:06:17] Adam was not Cain's father.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Now, that shouldn't be a question here
[1:06:21] about anybody. Right.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Because because if because he's not even
[1:06:26] found in the lineage of Adam at all.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; That's correct. Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; If he was the firstborn of Adam, he'd be
[1:06:34] in the lineage, but it wasn't the
[1:06:36] lineage. Abel, Seth replaced Abel.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Cain killed Abel.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Because of the revelation he had. He had
[1:06:45] a true revelation of what God wanted.
[1:06:47] And God vindicated it to Cain. and he
[1:06:50] saw it vindicated, but he couldn't
[1:06:51] receive it nor accept it
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; because he was a different seed.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Eve was the mother of all living, but
[1:06:58] Adam was not the father of all living.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's scripture.
[1:07:06] You say, "I've never heard that before."
[1:07:08] Well, I'll tell you. It wasn't eating an
[1:07:10] apricot, and it wasn't eating an apple
[1:07:12] that made Eve see she was naked or Adam.
[1:07:14] Right.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; It was an it was an an adultery affair.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; You know that. We know the scripture and
[1:07:22] that clearly places it out here. And
[1:07:24] there's not a denomination in the
[1:07:26] country that'll accept it.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it exposes that
[1:07:31] denominational system.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Because because Cain built his own
[1:07:36] little system and brought the fruits of
[1:07:38] the field thinking that's what God would
[1:07:40] respect, the works of his own hand. And
[1:07:42] God said, "I want nothing to do with
[1:07:44] your works. It's my works that I'm going
[1:07:46] to express."
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to reveal it to Abel so
[1:07:51] he'll do my works.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; You know that Bible said that you're
[1:07:54] God's workmanship created in in union
[1:07:57] with him.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are his workmanship created in
[1:08:03] union with Jesus Christ. You are his
[1:08:05] workmanship created in Jesus Christ unto
[1:08:08] good works
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; which I have to pump up and work up and
[1:08:11] do every day. Absolutely not. What you
[1:08:14] need to do, you've already been ordained
[1:08:16] to do it.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Which he hath before ordained that you
[1:08:24] would walk in them.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. There you are.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Now, where are we standing?
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:33] Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; See, so it has nothing to do with your
[1:08:38] affairs of and it's not that you don't
[1:08:40] have your desire is to please him, but
[1:08:42] you're going to make mistakes right up
[1:08:43] to the time you have a body change.
[1:08:45] You're going to fail and make mistakes.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; God is not judging you by your mistakes.
[1:08:49] He's judging you by the revelation of
[1:08:51] himself in you.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; That's the blood. He already covered it.
[1:08:57] The blood's there. Covers every sin.
[1:09:00] He's looking through the blood and see
[1:09:01] you perfect.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Satan's there pounding at your
[1:09:04] door saying, "Oh, you can't make it. You
[1:09:06] can't have this."
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Who says you can't have it when the
[1:09:10] Bible said it's yours?
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Now, it's whether you can believe it or
[1:09:14] not.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; The seed cannot deny the scriptural
[1:09:21] promises given to them.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. They can't They can't deny that.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; That's got it. All right. Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; That's certainly got it.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Because with that, you can't f Listen,
[1:09:36] the seed of God cannot fail.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; The seed of God is an eternal thought
[1:09:42] made manifest, spoken by a word.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; The seed is the word.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; And the word can never fail.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; The letter will pass away,
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; but not the word. right here.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; This Bible right here, the letter,
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; the letter will pass away.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; But this word that can contained in this
[1:10:08] letter can never pass away because it's
[1:10:10] God's thoughts expressed.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; It's God's thought. We already been
[1:10:17] through it here. Two or three meetings
[1:10:18] ago, I preached on the logos. You
[1:10:20] remember that? The voice of my beloved
[1:10:22] calling us.
[1:10:24] Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; So, we're looking at So, let's go. Let's
[1:10:28] go here over here now to Ezekiel chapter
[1:10:31] 2.
[1:10:33] Ezekiel chapter 2
[1:10:39] verse 9 and 10.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:10:45] Amen.
[1:10:57] And when I looked, behold, a hand was
[1:11:00] sent unto me. Ezekiel the prophet. And
[1:11:02] when I looked, behold, a hand was sent
[1:11:04] unto me. And lo, a roll of a book was
[1:11:06] therein.
[1:11:08] Now remember,
[1:11:10] this book was not, brother Bram said,
[1:11:12] this book is not like this book. Talking
[1:11:15] of in Revelation there, it's a roll.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. sealed but seven seals on the
[1:11:22] backside. Meaning at the end.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Meaning our day.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Because we know we've come to the end.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. That's right.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; We have it identified. We can we can
[1:11:37] spend a whole sermon on how that end is
[1:11:39] identified. But we know we've arrived.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Time is running out.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Time is being swallowed up under
[1:11:46] eternity.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Time and eternity are blending. Who's
[1:11:49] going to win?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Eternity.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Eternity.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Swallows up time. Isn't that right?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; So, what is our walking? We're walking
[1:11:59] right in eternal life to a body eternal
[1:12:03] change.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:12:10] in verse 10, and he spread it before me.
[1:12:12] I like that. He spread it before me. And
[1:12:15] it was written within and without.
[1:12:22] It was written within.
[1:12:24] Something in the book was written. It
[1:12:26] was in the book. Now, we find over in
[1:12:28] Jeremiah that there was he purchased the
[1:12:30] land, paid the price, redeemed a land.
[1:12:33] Is that right? The brother said, "You
[1:12:35] buy the land and when we're coming back,
[1:12:37] because we'll be back in 70 years
[1:12:39] according to prophecy, and you can you
[1:12:41] have a right and you can show the
[1:12:43] evidence that you own the land."
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That you own the land.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, I want the bride to
[1:12:53] know you own something.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; And he owns something
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; and he's purchased it.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; And he's calling now. Calling. The
[1:13:03] message the hour is calling for his
[1:13:05] bride to come sit where she belongs in
[1:13:07] position by his side in his throne.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. So,
[1:13:19] so this is what we're doing.
[1:13:25] Listen, you may have laughed at that.
[1:13:26] Let me just tell you something. I don't
[1:13:29] not talking about any person. We're not
[1:13:30] laughing. But look it, when you say, "I
[1:13:33] got it."
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that just comes out of a
[1:13:36] happen chance.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; You say you got something, it's going to
[1:13:39] live through you.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; It's going to be manifested.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just something you
[1:13:48] guessed at. Something when you say you
[1:13:50] got it, something's quickened inside of
[1:13:52] you.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; And there's still more to get.
[1:14:01] Amen. As he reveals his word, there's
[1:14:02] still more to get. Brother, sister,
[1:14:04] there's still more of him I need.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; But the word is be continuing being
[1:14:10] opened. Opened. Opened. One step at a
[1:14:13] time. We're walking with God.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so and the spread before
[1:14:21] me. It was written within and without.
[1:14:23] And there was written therein
[1:14:24] lamentations, mourning, and woe.
[1:14:28] All right. Now, we're in a tremendous
[1:14:31] day.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; We're in the second coming of Christ.
[1:14:36] I'm not pulling any punches.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is not fully
[1:14:41] fulfilled fully yet, but it's where when
[1:14:44] is it? You say, "Brother David, what is
[1:14:45] the fulfillment of that?" The meeting of
[1:14:47] him in the air, but he's come right now.
[1:14:49] He's here and he's unveiling himself to
[1:14:52] his bride
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; and he has to make manifest himself in
[1:14:56] bride form to fulfill the prophecy of
[1:14:58] Genesis 2.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Again,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; I say the prophecy because why did Adam
[1:15:05] take his wife to redeem her? Keep her
[1:15:08] from death. Is that right?
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; What did Christ do at the cross? He took
[1:15:13] you. You were in him and he took you in
[1:15:17] himself
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; and paid the penalty
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; of your heir
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; and paid the penalty of death.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; He paid the penalty of the law.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Which which to transgress the law was
[1:15:30] death. You had no way it out. It put you
[1:15:32] in jail, but he got us out.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, there was grace
[1:15:37] before the law, during the law, and
[1:15:39] after the law. It was grace.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:43] Amen. All right. Now, I don't have I
[1:15:46] won't go any further with that, but it
[1:15:48] was a book written. I want to emphasize
[1:15:50] it was written within
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; and without. Jeremiah, as I said,
[1:15:55] purchased land. He put the evidence. He
[1:15:57] sealed there was an evidence that he
[1:15:59] left open. And Revelation 6:1, we can
[1:16:03] read the evidence open.
[1:16:07] John said, "I I saw these seals opened."
[1:16:09] Amen. I seen a white horse. But but but
[1:16:12] there's something written within that
[1:16:15] those seals.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That it took the seventh angel to
[1:16:21] reveal.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't William Brandham revealing
[1:16:26] anything the man. It was the son of man.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; It was the king
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; put the sword in his hand.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And sent it down and and sent the word
[1:16:37] down to his seventh angel to open it.
[1:16:41] That's why I That's why I don't like
[1:16:43] anybody that'll water down this message.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; It's not to be watered down.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; It's to be lived. And you can't live it
[1:16:51] in yourself. It takes the one who
[1:16:53] brought the message to unveil himself in
[1:16:55] you who is the message.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so we see here then that
[1:17:04] in and let's go over here now to
[1:17:07] Revelations 5.
[1:17:12] Revelations chapter 5. And I saw in the
[1:17:16] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:17:18] a book written within and on the
[1:17:21] backside sealed with seven seals.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; So there's something written within. Now
[1:17:27] remember those that evidence that
[1:17:30] Jeremiah put within was the revelation
[1:17:33] in the time that it was to be made
[1:17:35] known.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was sealed where? in an earthn
[1:17:39] vessel.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; We were sealed in an earthn vessel.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; The word the word that was to come in
[1:17:49] our day went to Calvary.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Sealed. We were that mystery of himself.
[1:17:54] Just like Eve was sealed in Adam.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Before Eve could be manifest, she was
[1:18:01] sealed in Adam.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Are you Are you with me?
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; She was a mystery of Adam. Mhm.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Christ. Now, the there's a three-fold
[1:18:12] purpose of God, a three-fold mystery
[1:18:14] that he unveils this seventh seal. First
[1:18:16] of all, the first fold that all that God
[1:18:18] was, he poured into Christ.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So, God in Christ was the
[1:18:24] fullness of the Godhead bodily. You were
[1:18:27] a mystery in him then.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; He was the full book.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; He was all the book.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was, it was in him. And he went
[1:18:38] to Calvary and he died and he rose
[1:18:40] again. And now he mediates because he
[1:18:43] has to build a bride. He has to have a
[1:18:45] bride. And that bride he poured out his
[1:18:47] life for her. And by the elements that
[1:18:50] were poured out of him, he would create
[1:18:51] and make his own bride.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; And the the church ages were as a wheat
[1:18:58] plant. The life starts out as a seed.
[1:19:01] That's where you began. I'm talking to
[1:19:03] the bride now. You were that seed. In
[1:19:06] that seed was a mystery.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And that that seed began to grow and it
[1:19:10] grew first age, second age, all the way
[1:19:12] down until it come and went into the
[1:19:15] ground again because it had to die.
[1:19:16] Unless it died, it couldn't be made
[1:19:19] known or manifest.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Except a seed died. John 12. Except it
[1:19:24] died, it can't rise again.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Hallelujah.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; But to show the resurrection, it started
[1:19:31] coming out in Luther as a little blade.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; What did the life the life of the seed
[1:19:39] the life of Christ was manifest in a
[1:19:42] blade? Then it then those that followed
[1:19:45] denominated that word and it passed that
[1:19:48] life passed from that over into Wesley.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Sanctification. Are you with me?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; What is that? Tossel.
[1:19:56] Then it went from that tossle and they
[1:19:58] denominated and then life kept moving
[1:20:00] on. You can't shut the life out. The
[1:20:02] life has got to come back to what
[1:20:04] originally was.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't miss that. The life has
[1:20:09] got to come back to what it originally
[1:20:11] was.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; So then the life went out from that went
[1:20:17] into Wesley out of Wesley into
[1:20:20] Pentecost.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Now remember those three are under a man
[1:20:24] age.
[1:20:26] Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, still under a
[1:20:28] man age, under reformation.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; And they were carriers of one life.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; It came out of one, went into the other,
[1:20:36] went the other until it come to a shuck.
[1:20:38] And the shuck was so close to looking
[1:20:40] like the real seed, but you opened it
[1:20:42] up. We've heard brother Bram preach this
[1:20:44] many time, but you open it up and
[1:20:46] there's no seed there. But there is a
[1:20:48] little bud way back in there, but you
[1:20:50] think that was the seed because it was
[1:20:51] in the formation of a seed,
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; but it was a shuck,
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:55] But the seed is still coming up
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; because the seed had to come back to an
[1:21:00] original seed. And the original seed is
[1:21:03] spoken word.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Spoken word is the original seed.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; And this little bride being the thought
[1:21:13] of himself is a spoken word seed bride.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; It's not some fly by night. She's a
[1:21:23] spoken word seed
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; of himself
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; to be presented here as it was in God
[1:21:31] taking Eve out of Adam.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't take another spirit. He took
[1:21:36] the feminine spirit which was Adam.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Put it himself Adam
[1:21:43] into another form.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Iorphied. It was Adam. He morphed in
[1:21:48] another form taking on another mask.
[1:21:51] Right.
[1:21:53] Amen.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; All right. And so I'll I'll hold it
[1:21:59] right there and then we'll come back to
[1:22:00] 51. And so you seen a book written
[1:22:03] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:22:06] seven sealed. Then we see in verse eight
[1:22:08] we saw who had conquered who had the
[1:22:10] right to take the book who had the right
[1:22:12] to re to take that and it was the lion
[1:22:15] coming forth.
[1:22:17] Amen. It was a lion because he was the
[1:22:19] king. And he came forth as a simple lamb
[1:22:23] because it was the lamb in the form of
[1:22:25] the lamb. He paid for our penalty of
[1:22:27] sin. And he's the one that conquered.
[1:22:29] Who did? God did.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; It's not another brother, sister. It's
[1:22:33] not two, three gods here. It's one God
[1:22:36] coming down in three offices. God in
[1:22:39] Christ. Christ in you.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; There's your three second fold. God in
[1:22:45] Christ. Christ. Now where in you?
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's Christ now? Where's the
[1:22:53] revelation of God now? Where is it being
[1:22:55] manifest now? In the bride.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then who's among us, friends?
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon made a statement on a
[1:23:04] message. Who do you say this is? He
[1:23:06] said, it's Jesus Christ among us,
[1:23:08] friends.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Who do you say it is?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram wasn't pointing to the
[1:23:15] man saying, "Who do you say it is?" He
[1:23:17] was pointing to the revelation of the
[1:23:18] son of man coming through him and
[1:23:20] saying, "Who do you say this is that
[1:23:21] knows the secrets of the heart, can tell
[1:23:23] your thoughts, can tell your address,
[1:23:25] can tell you who you are, and now comes
[1:23:27] along and takes the book in his hand. He
[1:23:29] was the one that conquered for it. And
[1:23:31] now he opens it up."
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; And reveals a sealed secret.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go on with our message.
[1:23:43] Daniel 12.
[1:23:46] Daniel 12. We see over here in in
[1:23:49] Daniel.
[1:23:54] Thought I had that marked.
[1:24:00] Okay. Daniel 12:9.
[1:24:06] And I heard, but I understood or excuse
[1:24:08] me, I'll just read verse eight. and I
[1:24:11] heard but I understood not. Then said I,
[1:24:14] oh my Lord, what shall then said I, oh
[1:24:17] my Lord, what shall be the end of these
[1:24:19] things?
[1:24:22] And he said, Go thy way, Daniel, for the
[1:24:25] words are closed up and sealed till the
[1:24:29] time of the end.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The words are closed up.
[1:24:36] In the beginning was the word
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; and the word was with God.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; How was it with God? It was in the
[1:24:44] thinking of the eternal.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Those thoughts of God are eternal
[1:24:48] thoughts and they were in the in the in
[1:24:50] the secret. It was his secret. It was in
[1:24:53] him
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; to be expressed in word and he expressed
[1:24:57] it in word and the word was God.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; All right. So the so you see now there's
[1:25:05] this it comes down here and he said and
[1:25:08] go thy way Daniel for the words are
[1:25:10] closed up and sealed to the time of the
[1:25:14] end.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. Paragraph 524 of Christ the
[1:25:22] mystery. But he had to redeem her which
[1:25:24] is his body. She has to be redeemed in
[1:25:27] order to come to him.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] Unless you're redeemed, how you going to
[1:25:35] come to him?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; So, the great thing, the song sung by
[1:25:40] the blood of the cross,
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; we're redeemed.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; We'll just take a side note right here
[1:25:45] and go over here to Peter and see what
[1:25:48] Peter said
[1:25:51] in First Peter 1 19.
[1:25:56] But with the precious blood of Christ,
[1:25:58] as a lamb without blemish and without
[1:26:00] spot, who verily was fore orained before
[1:26:02] the foundation of the world, but was
[1:26:05] manifest in these last day and last
[1:26:07] times for you by who by him do believe
[1:26:11] who by him you who by him believe in God
[1:26:14] that raised him from the dead and gave
[1:26:17] him glory and faith and hope
[1:26:21] and your hope you and excuse me and gave
[1:26:23] him glory that your faith and hope might
[1:26:26] be in God.
[1:26:28] Seeing that we purified our souls in
[1:26:30] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:26:32] with unfeign love of the brethren, see
[1:26:35] that you love one another with a pure
[1:26:37] heart fervently, being born again, not
[1:26:39] of corruptible seed, but that but of
[1:26:41] incorruptible seed by the word of God.
[1:26:46] Amen. That liveth and abideth forever.
[1:26:49] Verse 18, I I left that out. For so much
[1:26:51] as you know, this is I for Excuse me.
[1:26:54] Verse 18. For so much as you know that
[1:26:56] you were not redeemed with corruptible
[1:26:58] things.
[1:27:00] Amen.
[1:27:01] As silver and gold from your vain
[1:27:03] conversation, received by tradition from
[1:27:05] your brethren, but with the precious
[1:27:07] blood of Christ as a lamb without
[1:27:10] blemish and without spot.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's redeemed it. And so he has
[1:27:17] redeemed her. He had redeemed her which
[1:27:20] is his body. She has to be redeemed in
[1:27:23] order to come to him. Do you see it? Oh
[1:27:26] my. See, it couldn't have happened then.
[1:27:33] What couldn't have happened then? What
[1:27:36] we're talking about this morning,
[1:27:39] the words were still sealed. Though he
[1:27:42] paid them. Paid for them. Are you Are
[1:27:45] you with me?
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; It was his property. Those words in that
[1:27:48] book were his property. Mhm.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Where were the book? In the hand of the
[1:27:54] original owner. Cuz because it was
[1:27:57] forfeited. It came back to the original
[1:27:59] owner. Is that right? What was that
[1:28:01] book? An abstract deed.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abstract mean it was searched all
[1:28:09] the way back.
[1:28:11] All the way back. And it was original.
[1:28:14] And it was the original seed word.
[1:28:22] You recognize then I trust that you'll
[1:28:25] see what what you've what God has
[1:28:27] purchased for you.
[1:28:30] Brother, sister, let me just say this.
[1:28:32] Everything he purchased for you is
[1:28:33] absolutely yours.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; He purchased everything that Adam lost
[1:28:38] and gave it back to us.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; He purchased it. He paid for it. And now
[1:28:44] he comes to claim and make known what he
[1:28:47] purchased and his rights of purchase.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; And that you are his eternal property.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; And whatever property he owns, you own.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, so he said now, so
[1:29:04] you see now that he he couldn't have
[1:29:07] happened then the redemption. He
[1:29:09] couldn't. In other words, he couldn't
[1:29:10] have opened the book then because the
[1:29:14] redemption is going on. Going on through
[1:29:16] what? Seven ages.
[1:29:19] Amen. So, the redemption's going on.
[1:29:22] Now, you see the seals. See, the
[1:29:25] redemption is not fully completed until
[1:29:27] he comes to claim his possession.
[1:29:30] He's got to claim his rights.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; He's got to claim the book. He's got to
[1:29:35] open it. He's got to bring her to
[1:29:37] himself. You remember Eve could not come
[1:29:40] to Adam by herself. God brought her to
[1:29:43] Adam,
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; right? Go back in Genesis. See if that's
[1:29:49] not what he God brought her to Adam. And
[1:29:51] he's carried us on eagle's wings to
[1:29:53] himself.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; He brought us to recognize who we were
[1:30:00] and where we come from.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; That's what the seals opened.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's now we're beginning
[1:30:09] to understand and see what the thunder
[1:30:11] said.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; But see, it's not open. You say, "Why?
[1:30:16] Everybody could." No. No. It's not open
[1:30:18] to the public. It's open to the bride.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is the word of God
[1:30:24] made manifest in flesh. And that can be
[1:30:27] only Jesus Christ, the same yesterday
[1:30:30] and today in bride form and forever.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:30:36] What he was, he is
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; only in another form.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Wonderful.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; see, it's time to get out of this fear
[1:30:48] and scare.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; You don't know who you are.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; You don't know what's present here. Many
[1:30:55] don't know it.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; There's something happening. The world
[1:30:57] knows nothing about it. Church entities
[1:30:59] knows nothing about it. And a majority
[1:31:01] of the message people don't know about
[1:31:03] it.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say that?" because
[1:31:05] it's a little group that comes out of it
[1:31:07] at the last.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; So, what are we going to do? He's given
[1:31:11] you a book to feed on. He's given you
[1:31:13] the word to feed on. Why aren't we?
[1:31:16] Because Satan's keeping you too busy
[1:31:17] with other things.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; You know what? He hates the revelation
[1:31:23] of this because he knows that by the
[1:31:25] word
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; in that word in that seed is your body
[1:31:29] changed.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; And if you go to believing that, what's
[1:31:34] going to happen?
[1:31:35] That's right.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; If that's quickened to you, there's a
[1:31:38] people out here that won't listen to his
[1:31:40] garbly goop and trash. See, you're
[1:31:44] you're too busy to go out. You're too
[1:31:45] busy to feed on the word. You're too
[1:31:47] busy to feed on an open book. You're too
[1:31:49] busy.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; That's his business today.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; We need to stop and and realize and take
[1:31:55] note and give preeminence to the one
[1:31:57] that means something.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; All these other things are passing away.
[1:32:01] Everything you see is temporal. But we
[1:32:04] look not at the things which are seen,
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; but the things which are not seen, for
[1:32:08] the things which are not seen are
[1:32:10] eternal.
[1:32:11] [Applause]
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:32:24] so we go on. Now you see the seals when
[1:32:27] he was in his mediatorial work back
[1:32:29] there redeeming.
[1:32:31] But someday, and someday isn't yet,
[1:32:34] someday is this day. This scripture is
[1:32:37] fulfilled. The someday is on us.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; The someday is when he took the book,
[1:32:42] put it in the hands of the seventh angel
[1:32:44] to reveal it. That was the someday.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; And the someday is when it's revealed in
[1:32:50] you.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; You come to your someday.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? And someday he
[1:32:57] comes forth to get this book that he's
[1:33:00] redeemed.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you what, he's still
[1:33:03] getting the book.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; If there's still someone else that's got
[1:33:07] to be redeemed and has been redeemed,
[1:33:09] excuse me, has to recognize who they
[1:33:11] are, then he has to make that known to
[1:33:13] them.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; But when that last one is made known,
[1:33:17] there still may be a little period of
[1:33:18] time, but the door is shut. When the
[1:33:20] last one that was ready went into the
[1:33:22] marriage, the door was shut.
[1:33:26] I don't know when that day is.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; We don't know when that moment is that
[1:33:29] we're going to meet our loved ones. I
[1:33:30] don't know that moment, but I know I'm
[1:33:32] in the day of the moment.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; And the hour of the time of the moment.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; So, we shouldn't we should be giving our
[1:33:44] whole self. You have a choice to make.
[1:33:46] It's either give yourself to self or
[1:33:48] give yourself to the word
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; and let it live through you.
[1:33:54] Amen. One has to have preeminence over
[1:33:56] the other one.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; I know it it makes you seem radical,
[1:34:02] makes you odd, makes you different, but
[1:34:05] we're meant to be different. We're not
[1:34:06] somebody that's not different. If our if
[1:34:09] our husband was different, we're going
[1:34:11] to be different.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; If that seed was different, the seed
[1:34:14] today, which is himself in the bride
[1:34:16] form, is different. There's no beauty we
[1:34:18] would desire her outwardly.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that inward beauty of the
[1:34:24] revealed word manifested in the
[1:34:26] simplicity of him of the word himself. A
[1:34:28] word bride.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; He's the word groom. What would the
[1:34:31] bride be? The word bride.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Not another word. Himself.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not getting to a lot of things I had
[1:34:44] in here, but I don't care. It doesn't
[1:34:46] matter as the Lord leads. But look what
[1:34:48] he said. His church is himself revealed.
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 250. Christ the mystery of God
[1:34:59] revealed. And the only way you're saved
[1:35:01] is to know him by revelation.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; You can't pump it up. You can't work it
[1:35:07] up. But you can give yourself and yield
[1:35:09] yourself and let him work through you
[1:35:12] and open his word to you.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Who's standing in the way? You're
[1:35:15] standing in the way.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he's going to do everything he
[1:35:19] can to get you out of the way. I don't
[1:35:21] care if it means breaking everything you
[1:35:23] have. He's going to waken you up on the
[1:35:24] day that you're in the way.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? How many say amen to
[1:35:30] that? Know that that's what's happened
[1:35:31] and it's happening.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; He'll turn things upside down to get you
[1:35:37] to realize that he alone
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; is your salvation. He alone is your
[1:35:42] revelation rock. He is my rock. He is my
[1:35:46] revelation. Yes,
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; he is my glory.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; There is no other glory. I I I am his
[1:35:54] glory. He is my glory.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; The church is himself revealed. Do you
[1:36:05] see it? What is the church? It's the
[1:36:07] expressed word made manifest.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Glory. That's her position. That's who
[1:36:14] she is. Amen.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; She's a wife of the word. Her husband is
[1:36:18] the word.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Her husband is the creator of heaven and
[1:36:21] earth. Her husband is the deity. Her
[1:36:24] husband is is eternal. Her husband is
[1:36:26] the word living.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; That makes her everything her husband
[1:36:34] is. She is.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; She's under headship. She's sovereign.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; She's a sovereign like him under
[1:36:40] headship.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] My
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; we have his mind. What am I saying when
[1:36:49] I say that? I don't have my I'm not led
[1:36:51] by my own carnal mind. I'm led by his
[1:36:53] mind.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; This little bride has the mind of
[1:36:56] Christ.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; So what so what's he say here? He said
[1:37:01] now you see mediatorial but someday he
[1:37:03] comes forth to get this book. He's
[1:37:05] redeemed and all that's in this book
[1:37:07] would be him. For that's the believer
[1:37:11] the words in the book.
[1:37:14] Now tell me what was sealed up. The
[1:37:16] words in the book.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Then who's the words in the book? The
[1:37:21] believer. You, me, the believer is the
[1:37:24] words in the book.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; So it's see it's you can it's written
[1:37:29] within.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; You're the word written within and
[1:37:32] without. Everybody has the word.
[1:37:35] Everybody has the letter. But he has not
[1:37:37] made us the ministers of the letter.
[1:37:39] He's made us ministers of the logos, the
[1:37:42] spirit, the voice.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that logos means a
[1:37:49] thought or concept put into word. So he
[1:37:52] expressed his eternal thoughts of you
[1:37:54] and I and man the thoughts of himself
[1:37:57] and put it into word and hid it in the
[1:37:59] word in the back part of his mind and
[1:38:01] would not let it out and make it known
[1:38:03] they were sealed up until this day when
[1:38:06] he would open those seals and would
[1:38:08] loose himself and the little book she in
[1:38:11] that book would come to the realization
[1:38:13] this is my positive position and place.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; That's why there's a book within the
[1:38:25] book.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; It's sealed. It's written within and
[1:38:31] without.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; We are not ministers of the letter. The
[1:38:35] letter's here. I'm not doing away with
[1:38:37] the letter. I believe the letter, but
[1:38:39] there's a secret behind this letter.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; And this letter wasn't sent to everybody
[1:38:43] else. This letter was sent to the bride
[1:38:46] and the bride will read between the
[1:38:47] lines and know what he said in the
[1:38:49] letter.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; She's going to know what he said in the
[1:38:56] letter.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; And your life being an outward portrayal
[1:39:01] is going to manifest something that's
[1:39:03] inside having the mind of Christ.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; It's just like a marriage on the
[1:39:08] outside. There's a revelation of a
[1:39:10] marriage that's spiritual.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; That's reflecting the bride and Christ.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; And as the bride is subject to her
[1:39:17] husband,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; so will the bride be subject to the
[1:39:20] word. And they're one. They're not
[1:39:22] divided.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; You see, we thought marriage and divorce
[1:39:28] was something. It was something all
[1:39:30] outward. Oh, it's all outward. That's
[1:39:31] great thing. It's something inward
[1:39:33] that's a reality. And the outward is
[1:39:35] revealing a mystery inside.
[1:39:38] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; I trust you can see that.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. All right. And the
[1:39:54] words in the book and the word, you are
[1:39:55] the believer. The words and the word is
[1:39:57] him.
[1:39:59] And all that's in that and all that's in
[1:40:02] that
[1:40:03] he come forth for this book of
[1:40:06] redemption whose names are written in
[1:40:08] the book before the foundation of the
[1:40:10] world. He was slain as a lamb. And today
[1:40:14] his word manifesting the same thing he
[1:40:16] did there. She can't recognize another
[1:40:18] headship. No sir. There's no bishop, no
[1:40:20] nothing. She recognizes one headship.
[1:40:23] That's Christ. And Christ is the word.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Now
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; he said over here he said God fully
[1:40:37] manifest in Jesus Christ. First fold
[1:40:41] fully manifest in Jesus Christ. God
[1:40:43] fully manifest.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Then the bride was there in him.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; How many say amen?
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; If God's fully he was fully manifested.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; And what was he? It was God's great
[1:40:57] secret of his revelation in Jesus
[1:41:00] Christ.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said Christ in you is
[1:41:05] God's great revelation.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; So you are God's great revelation in
[1:41:14] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:41:17] [Applause]
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:41:23] Boy, that that seals it forever for us.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; You talk about a seal
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; to the day of your body change. That
[1:41:31] seals it.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; When you recognize your place in Christ.
[1:41:35] Amen. All right. God's great secret,
[1:41:39] great light of revelation, it's always
[1:41:42] blinded the wisdom of this world.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's always blinded them.
[1:41:47] The light will do one of two things.
[1:41:48] It'll either open your eyes or blind
[1:41:50] you.
[1:41:52] Yeah,
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; It was sent. It was sent. The the
[1:41:59] Pharisees, Sadducees, when he was
[1:42:00] manifested, he's be elub. The little
[1:42:03] woman at the well said, "He's Messiah."
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; What made the difference?
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; She was a predestinated seed waiting for
[1:42:13] the light of that word to fall and and
[1:42:15] the and the water of the word to come
[1:42:17] upon her and it struck that seed and
[1:42:20] brought out what that seed was. And what
[1:42:22] it was was Jesus Christ. The same
[1:42:24] yesterday, today, and forever. It wasn't
[1:42:26] some other person. It was her glory.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; It was her rock.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Rock means revelation in the Bible. Go
[1:42:36] back and shalom and see if the prophet
[1:42:38] didn't say that. God is my revelation.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the scripture 62 of of Psalms,
[1:42:47] he said, "God is my rock." God is my
[1:42:50] revelation. God is my rock. Twice he
[1:42:52] said that in there. My refuge, my
[1:42:54] strength, my my my peace. Everything
[1:42:58] about everything he is.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; we have and are.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; You can't trust this outer man. As has
[1:43:07] been said right here by pastor. You
[1:43:08] can't put any trust in the outer man.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; God don't put any trust in it. Why would
[1:43:13] you put trust in it?
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; God trusts his own word.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; And if you be in him, you're going to
[1:43:18] trust the word. You're going to you're
[1:43:20] going to fulfill the scripture no matter
[1:43:22] what it feels like, no matter what your
[1:43:24] reasoning says, no matter how unusual it
[1:43:26] means.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; How much of a death it causes you to die
[1:43:29] to your own ideas and your own self and
[1:43:32] come under the headship of the word.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Whether it's in marriage, whether it's
[1:43:37] in our walk, whether it's in our house,
[1:43:39] whether it's in our home, whether it's
[1:43:41] out in the public,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; we have one thing we're manifesting.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; That's Jesus Christ. That's present
[1:43:47] tense here. taking a bride out of here,
[1:43:49] but turning a bride in himself, taking
[1:43:51] her to a home, taking her to a rapture.
[1:43:53] The because and in order for that to
[1:43:55] happen, the rapture's got to be in you
[1:43:57] already.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; How is it in you?
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Revealed in you.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. Now,
[1:44:11] so she can't recognize another headship.
[1:44:14] Her headship is Christ, and Christ is
[1:44:16] the word. Yes, sir.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Church age book, page 332. If any man
[1:44:21] eats of that bread, now Paul, Brother
[1:44:23] Bram's talking about partial realization
[1:44:26] and perfect realization.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; You find what he said in there. He said
[1:44:30] like they fed mana in the wilderness,
[1:44:31] but then the next day they were hungry.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; So they had partial, it meant something,
[1:44:35] but partial realization. But when he,
[1:44:38] the true bread, came, now watch what he
[1:44:40] said. He said, "And here he is today in
[1:44:44] his word." Here he is today in his word.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; See, as I said, the whole church systems
[1:44:53] have the letter.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; But unless they're the mystery in that
[1:45:01] Bible, unless they're the word opened,
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; as I said, the letter wasn't sent to
[1:45:06] them. The letter was sent to us.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; The whole Bible is sent to the bride.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; The letter sent to us. We have the
[1:45:13] ability by God to read the letter. We
[1:45:17] know because we have his mind
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; what he's saying.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, sister.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Goodness sakes.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, if any man eats of that
[1:45:29] bread that came from heaven, he will
[1:45:30] never hunger again. Talk about
[1:45:32] realization.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; He said, he said he does not need to
[1:45:37] come back and eat again. Now, just stop
[1:45:39] and think about that. He said once other
[1:45:42] words brother Brham's not saying don't
[1:45:44] feed on the word
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; right
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; how many gets hungry and wants more of
[1:45:47] the word certainly
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; but that is a satisfying that word now
[1:45:51] watch what else he goes on to say with
[1:45:53] it he said he said the moment he
[1:45:57] parttook he had eternal life here indeed
[1:46:00] was reality no need any longer for a
[1:46:04] shadow no need for a partial salvation
[1:46:07] he is the whole of it
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; yeah Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Well, he's the whole of it.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Just like Jesus isn't a part of God, he
[1:46:19] is God.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Not just a part of God, he is God.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Veil behind skin. Is that right?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Right. He came through a woman.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; How'd you come?
[1:46:36] You didn't come virgin born through
[1:46:38] woman, but you came through a woman.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there is a virgin birth.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; And this little bride is virgin born.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; The word birth, she's a wordborn bride.
[1:46:51] Virginborn bride. She's not touched by
[1:46:55] manhandling.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; All right. She is a She is She She go
[1:47:03] back to seat is not of her shuck. She is
[1:47:06] Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today,
[1:47:08] and forever.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; A virgin word bride.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; All right. Virgin born. She's virgin
[1:47:18] born. Birth, spiritual birth, not
[1:47:21] natural.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; And the promise, Brother Brandham said
[1:47:24] in the message
[1:47:26] um
[1:47:28] this this day the scripture fulfilled.
[1:47:30] He said, "What's come on the scene and
[1:47:32] what was promised to come on the scene
[1:47:34] is a royal bride."
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? He said she's to
[1:47:39] come on the scene. The promise is that
[1:47:41] she'd be here on the scene. Then who is
[1:47:43] she? She's himself.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. The See, we didn't we didn't
[1:47:48] visualize the second coming that way
[1:47:51] because the bride coming forth is the
[1:47:53] bride coming of Christ.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. What for? Back to Eden. Because
[1:47:58] when she steps back into Eden, it's it's
[1:48:00] the family again.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Perfectly brought back. Right back to
[1:48:05] Eden. What's the next step? The on the
[1:48:07] three-fold. Christ in you,
[1:48:11] ready for the garden again.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Right here. Back to
[1:48:17] Eden. You see where we're at? All right.
[1:48:19] So, now we're ready to step over. We're
[1:48:22] coming ready. Every member of the bride
[1:48:24] has to be ready. She'll be absolutely
[1:48:27] under perfection of his word.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Not perfection physically. Perfect word.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Perfect. Because he's already said
[1:48:39] she's perfect and complete.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; And she said there's no sin against her.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; The blood has cleansed her and she
[1:48:48] stands there perfect.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. See? So it so you can't you can't
[1:48:53] make something imperfect when he said
[1:48:55] it's perfect. And if you're in Jesus
[1:48:57] Christ, you're perfect.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your outer man isn't perfect, but
[1:49:04] your outer man isn't
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; isn't who I am.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; It's this inside of the inside. The
[1:49:10] third pull is who I am.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; First pull was was flesh in the hand.
[1:49:16] Second pull was spirit. Third pull was
[1:49:18] the opening of the word in the soul.
[1:49:20] Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Now, nobody can touch that unless that
[1:49:25] seed laying there to be opened.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; And that was a mystery until it was
[1:49:30] opened. And it was sealed in this book.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; And this and this book, there's a book
[1:49:34] that little book. You notice the Bible
[1:49:36] said in Revelation 10, it said they
[1:49:37] called it little.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, it's not it's not
[1:49:44] something else. It's still the book. But
[1:49:47] brother Brandham made it very clear that
[1:49:49] the book of life, the book of life, the
[1:49:51] lamb book of life, the book of of of
[1:49:53] life or the or the or the there's
[1:49:55] another name, two or three other names
[1:49:57] named for it is the same book
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; titled each one of them.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; See, they're they're the same book.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; But but he said in a section of that
[1:50:06] book,
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; there's another record.
[1:50:13] And he said those names in that record
[1:50:16] could never be removed
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; for they are the names of his bride.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Now I've got I know I've got to hurry.
[1:50:27] My time flies. All right. So the whole
[1:50:30] of it Jesus isn't a part of God. He is
[1:50:32] God. Now it's the same thing in the
[1:50:34] bride.
[1:50:37] She is him.
[1:50:39] Now, I'm going to bypass a lot because
[1:50:41] I' I've got to, but let me just bring
[1:50:42] out these things right here. God's great
[1:50:45] secret has always blinded the wisdom of
[1:50:47] the world. They can't get it. They just
[1:50:49] don't understand it. Satan don't
[1:50:51] understand it. None of the rest of them
[1:50:52] understand it. And those who are but
[1:50:55] just those who are predestinated to
[1:50:57] understand it. How God and Christ are
[1:50:59] one. They make him three every time.
[1:51:01] They certainly will. Notice next.
[1:51:03] Secondly, the manifested Christ in you.
[1:51:06] Christ. God in Christ. Christ in you,
[1:51:09] the hope of glory, the great manifested
[1:51:11] God in Christ, now Christ manifested in
[1:51:14] you. Look, this is what I want to get
[1:51:16] to. What was once God's great secret,
[1:51:19] mis great mysterious secret in his mind,
[1:51:23] how many know he had it in his mind. He
[1:51:25] didn't let it out. He kept he said he
[1:51:27] kept it was in there in the word. It was
[1:51:29] constantly being manifest, but he didn't
[1:51:31] let it out. Other words, he didn't
[1:51:33] reveal it yet.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's in the word. You can't take you
[1:51:38] can't take this secret out of the word.
[1:51:40] Even though John was forbidden to write
[1:51:41] it. It's not something Brother Aram said
[1:51:45] it's not something outside the word. He
[1:51:46] said it's and it's not something written
[1:51:48] in the word. It's something it wasn't
[1:51:50] written in the word. But he said you
[1:51:52] can't take it out of the word because
[1:51:53] it's hid in the word.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; So it's hid there.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; So you are the hidden secret.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Boy, if that don't set it on fire,
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; I don't know what will. You're the
[1:52:05] hidden secret of You are the hidden
[1:52:08] secret of himself.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; So you are the whole
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; fully revealed manifestation of himself
[1:52:17] here at the end. The complete
[1:52:19] revelation.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; I said a mouthful there.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; The complete revelation. The whole of
[1:52:28] it.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:34] Amen.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; You know what that means?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; So be it.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Christ in you makes the complete revel
[1:52:46] makes you the complete revelation of the
[1:52:48] whole thing.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; He you tell me. Just tell me what the
[1:52:54] prophet said. He interpreted it. Isn't
[1:52:56] that what he said? Christ the mystery of
[1:52:58] God revealed. Christ in you is the
[1:53:00] center of the revelation. Christ is the
[1:53:02] center of the revelation. He's the
[1:53:05] little wheel. Christ in you makes him
[1:53:07] the center. And and and I mean Christ in
[1:53:10] the Bible makes the Bible a complete
[1:53:12] revelation of Christ. And he said Christ
[1:53:14] in you makes you the complete revelation
[1:53:17] of his of the whole thing.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; You tell me what denomination's
[1:53:24] preaching that.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; No denomination. Right?
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about denominational
[1:53:30] spirits amongst this message people.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; They aren't preaching this.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; They can't preach this. They can preach
[1:53:36] a Pentecost, but that's not our message.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; We believe in Pentecost. We must come
[1:53:42] through Pentecost, but Pentecost made
[1:53:44] way for himself
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; to come down in manifestation. And so,
[1:53:48] we turned the corner and raised higher.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now we're following what
[1:53:55] heaven opened.
[1:53:57] We're following him right out of heaven.
[1:53:59] Riding on the same power
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; because heaven opened.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly what it is.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we follow the word that
[1:54:13] proceeded out of his mouth.
[1:54:16] That's our absolute.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so I'm going to hurry
[1:54:23] here with this. I hate to bypass some of
[1:54:26] this. But Christ in you makes you the
[1:54:28] complete revelation of the whole thing.
[1:54:30] You want to know what word complete
[1:54:31] means?
[1:54:33] Complete means finished.
[1:54:35] Complete means ended. And complete means
[1:54:39] concluded.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; So you are the complete. You are the
[1:54:43] finish. You are the conclusion. And
[1:54:45] you're the ending of the whole thing.
[1:54:55] And so see what God's trying to do.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; He makes you the complete revelation the
[1:55:00] whole thing. And brother Bram said, "See
[1:55:01] what God is trying to do."
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; If this isn't preached, that's not
[1:55:08] feeding the bride.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; I That's the truth.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; That's got to be preached. If you're
[1:55:15] going to preach the word for the season,
[1:55:17] what I'm telling you is the promised
[1:55:18] word for this season manifested.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. This me this day,
[1:55:24] these scriptures are fulfilled. The
[1:55:26] hidden word is now opened.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; The book has been opened. The marriage
[1:55:32] certificate is open. I know that I'm his
[1:55:36] wife.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you know, but I'm
[1:55:41] telling you what I know, and I'm a
[1:55:42] witness of that. Do I need more of him?
[1:55:44] Yes, because I haven't come to a body
[1:55:46] change. Maybe it's just waiting for
[1:55:47] other. I don't know. But one thing I do
[1:55:50] know, I can't get enough of him.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; I got to have him every day. He's
[1:56:00] brighter, clearer, just as clear, more
[1:56:02] clear all the time. Clearer and clearer
[1:56:04] and clearer. And it just seemed like
[1:56:06] it's just a perfect message with a
[1:56:08] perfect word. It's a perfect and when
[1:56:10] that which is perfect is come here.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; That which is in part is done away.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; We are part of we are the whole of
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; glory. That was good. Boy, I got a lot
[1:56:23] out of that one right then.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's the truth.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Right there. Right there it is.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; I think we can close the book and say
[1:56:33] amen and go home.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But look, what was once God's
[1:56:37] great secret, mysterious secret in his
[1:56:39] mind is now, now, now, now put in the
[1:56:43] hearts of the believer. That is the body
[1:56:45] of Christ. What once God's great secret
[1:56:47] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:56:49] world is now made manifest. Think of it.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; But God's great mystery, what the
[1:56:57] eternal God had as a mystery has now
[1:57:00] been unfolded
[1:57:02] in Jesus Christ.
[1:57:05] Hallelujah.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; And then given and then given. Not have
[1:57:10] to do a work for it. And then given. How
[1:57:13] many's willing to receive it? Let go of
[1:57:15] yourself. Give up yourself and live for
[1:57:17] him.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; No matter how much of a height it takes
[1:57:19] off you, how much contrary it is to your
[1:57:21] thinking? Just lay yourself down. Say,
[1:57:24] "God, I'm here not for any other purpose
[1:57:26] but submitting myself to you."
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not here willing to live for self.
[1:57:32] We got a choice. Every day you die
[1:57:35] daily. You take up your cross and follow
[1:57:37] him.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Do what the word said do and quit trying
[1:57:44] to interpret it some other way than what
[1:57:46] the word said for you to do. That's all
[1:57:47] there is to it.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; And don't you put your thinking to this
[1:57:52] message and say, "Well, Brother Brown
[1:57:53] didn't mean that
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; or he meant something else. He meant
[1:57:58] just this message is a perfect
[1:57:59] interpretation of the word.
[1:58:02] And when that which is perfect has come,
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; it's going to set you in the condition
[1:58:08] and the in the right position and the
[1:58:10] place for a body change.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; And we're looking for the third coming
[1:58:14] of Christ.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Brother, how you going
[1:58:18] to figure that one?" Why? The second
[1:58:19] coming is what we're seeing. He come
[1:58:21] again to do what? Receive you unto
[1:58:23] himself.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Didn't he say he would come again? Did
[1:58:27] not he say he would come again and
[1:58:29] receive you that where I am, you may be
[1:58:31] also? How's that going to happen unless
[1:58:33] the word's unveiled to you?
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; And the secret of the books opened up.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm not saying you won't meet him
[1:58:40] in the air. Yes, we'll meet him in the
[1:58:42] air. But without this revelation, this
[1:58:44] invisible union spiritually unveiled in
[1:58:47] you, you will never be there.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the truth. Yeah,
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; that's exactly right.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; So, see that word, that secret, that
[1:59:00] word in there is something beyond what
[1:59:01] you see written.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; There's a revelation contained in there
[1:59:06] that only the bride can read.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; See, they everybody saw the seals. John
[1:59:15] saw them, but there was a revelation
[1:59:17] contained in what he saw outward
[1:59:19] written.
[1:59:21] There was inveiled in there. was hidden
[1:59:23] from
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; everybody
[1:59:27] and open to the bride.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; You see, we need to know it.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now let me just
[1:59:36] I got to find a place to quit here. I
[1:59:38] got to close.
[1:59:48] All right.
[1:59:51] Okay. We know what the new birth is.
[1:59:53] It's Christ revealed in you.
[1:59:56] Amen. That's Jesus Christ, the new birth
[2:00:00] revealed in you.
[2:00:06] And if you have and if and if he hasn't
[2:00:08] been revealed in you, there's no birth
[2:00:09] yet.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; And listen, revelation is not something
[2:00:15] you hope you have. It's something you
[2:00:17] know you have.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. It's a knowing, not a
[2:00:20] hoping.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; It's the It's the evidence of things
[2:00:25] hoped for.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. It's the substance of things
[2:00:29] hoped for.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; What was God's thinking? Was it
[2:00:34] substance or wasn't it?
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Sure, it was substance. He thought it
[2:00:39] wasn't just happen chance. He created by
[2:00:41] what he knew.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you were substance. You
[2:00:46] were real. You were existing in his
[2:00:48] thinking.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; It was substance.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; All right?
[2:00:54] And evidence. Faith is the evidence of
[2:00:56] things hoped for.
[2:00:58] So, it's got to be faith first.
[2:01:01] It's got to be revealed first. That's
[2:01:03] why Brother Brandham said there's an
[2:01:05] invisible union taking place.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a marriage. We're going to
[2:01:11] a full marriage at the wedding supper.
[2:01:14] We understand what he said there. We're
[2:01:15] going to that full celebration of a
[2:01:18] union.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Then we step right back out and that
[2:01:22] third coming is stepping with his bride
[2:01:24] right back out of the millennium.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; So see where we're at.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; We're further than you think.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; We just go on living and we should be
[2:01:37] living just every day. But brother,
[2:01:39] sister, if you're God's predestinated
[2:01:41] seed, everything that he ever was,
[2:01:43] everything you ever will be, everything
[2:01:45] that he was is in that seed.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. When that seed's opened,
[2:01:55] it's going to be everything he he was,
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; everything he is, and everything he ever
[2:02:01] will be.
[2:02:11] It isn't something written. Now, I could
[2:02:14] we'll just I'll just have to take a part
[2:02:15] two on this because I can't finish it.
[2:02:18] But he said,
[2:02:21] and I've got many things I wanted to
[2:02:23] bring out in the first seal, a few
[2:02:24] quotes in there, but I'll just leave it.
[2:02:30] He said, 'I always thought that it was
[2:02:32] something sealed on the back of the book
[2:02:34] and it wasn't something wrote in the
[2:02:35] book, but it turned out that it it was
[2:02:38] made known that he cannot do that. It
[2:02:39] isn't something that's written in the
[2:02:41] book. It's something that's been hid in
[2:02:43] the book.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall take one word from
[2:02:48] it or add to it. So, it's a mystery
[2:02:50] that's been in the book in these seven
[2:02:51] church ages.
[2:02:54] Amen. All right. Now, now remember the
[2:02:58] old testament is not complete without
[2:03:00] the new.
[2:03:02] What did he say? And masterpiece the old
[2:03:05] testament and the new testament is
[2:03:07] husband and wife.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; You have two halves make a whole.
[2:03:13] All right. Now he said so it's and new
[2:03:16] could not be complete without the old.
[2:03:19] So we could not be complete without the
[2:03:21] old
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; and he can't be complete without the
[2:03:25] new.
[2:03:28] That's right.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what watch. See, if
[2:03:32] you were for if you were in the
[2:03:33] fornowledge of God, his thoughts of
[2:03:35] himself, then you are becoming a part of
[2:03:37] God. And the only way you can be a son
[2:03:40] of God or a daughter of God, you had to
[2:03:42] be a part of God. And God isn't complete
[2:03:45] without you.
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Okay, there it is. So, he's not complete
[2:03:53] without you. It has to be. So what was
[2:03:55] in the back part of his mind that he
[2:03:57] would reserve
[2:03:59] to the end?
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Just like in Eden, he created had all
[2:04:06] the creation. There it was. There was
[2:04:07] the man and look at the woman had to
[2:04:09] come forth. She was the capstone
[2:04:11] revelation of the whole creation.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. She was the capstone of it.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Everything was complete in Adam.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But she but he was not
[2:04:23] complete until that portion of himself
[2:04:25] was made manifest.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; So she was the capstone. Other words,
[2:04:30] Jesus Christ the capstone or headstone
[2:04:32] in the bride form. It's got to be in
[2:04:35] this hour.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; We don't have another message to
[2:04:38] manifest. We have the headstone to
[2:04:40] manifest.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Of the whole body. For without us they
[2:04:46] couldn't be made perfect.
[2:04:50] The whole weight of the thing lays right
[2:04:51] here. Unless that book was open. John
[2:04:54] wept. If there's no man worthy,
[2:04:57] how could there be a rapture? Even
[2:04:58] though he paid the price of redemption
[2:05:02] without the claiming of the book,
[2:05:04] there'd be no body change.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; So, you see, the book's already been
[2:05:09] claimed
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; because we're looking for a body change.
[2:05:15] We're looking for a meeting in the air.
[2:05:16] Now, I'm going to finish up right here.
[2:05:18] I'm just going to keep closing this off.
[2:05:20] I'm sorry to take so much time. I
[2:05:21] thought maybe well I never mind what I
[2:05:23] thought. All right.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; See, if you were in the fornowledge, you
[2:05:28] are the complete revel. He's not
[2:05:29] complete without you. Okay. Now, that's
[2:05:32] right. Because there's only one only one
[2:05:34] resource of eternal life, and that is
[2:05:37] God. And him alone has eternal life.
[2:05:39] Now, and you were a part of him in so
[2:05:41] much that you were an attribute or his
[2:05:43] thinking of himself in the beginning.
[2:05:48] Amen. So how did he bring you out? How
[2:05:51] did he bring you forth? Through a spoken
[2:05:53] word.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; So the spoken word was the original
[2:05:57] seed,
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; not the written word.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Not the rema.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; No. The Bible didn't say that. It said
[2:06:07] in the beginning was the word
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; and the word was with God
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; and the word was God. Yeah,
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; it was a spoken word seed.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the Bible was put into
[2:06:20] written form.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And did not he come in written
[2:06:25] form? I mean, did not he come outwardly
[2:06:28] and took on a form as a son? Is that
[2:06:31] right? He comes and takes on the form of
[2:06:33] a bride. But there's a mystery in there
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; that's unveiled.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; You see the outward.
[2:06:40] God sees what's inside. And what's
[2:06:43] inside will be worked out because I've
[2:06:45] already ordained the works you should
[2:06:46] do.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; There it is. All right.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; So, it's going to be his works through
[2:06:56] you.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; And his works through you is to believe
[2:06:59] on him whom God has sent.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; And if you believe on him whom God has
[2:07:05] sent, the works of Christ will be
[2:07:07] manifest through you because it's his
[2:07:09] life living through you.
[2:07:12] And you're going to hear and you're
[2:07:14] going to receive the word of promise for
[2:07:16] this age,
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; for this time
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; and this season.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; You're going to receive the revelation
[2:07:24] of it.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; You have to see it.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now because he thought of you in
[2:07:38] the beginning, it gives that little tug
[2:07:39] towards him. That's what has to be
[2:07:41] quickened because he he he because he
[2:07:46] thought of you in the beginning. Where'd
[2:07:47] he think of you in himself? The eternal
[2:07:49] thought of himself.
[2:07:51] He said he said and that because he
[2:07:53] thought of you in the beginning, it
[2:07:55] gives that little tug toward him.
[2:07:57] Anybody have a little tug toward him?
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; That's the part that has to be
[2:08:02] quickened.
[2:08:05] Amen. If you're looking for God in
[2:08:07] simplicity, there it is.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's simple,
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; but it takes revelation to see it.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; That's what it takes.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Abel saw him in simplicity.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Cain did not.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; You see, the children of God see him in
[2:08:29] simplicity. Yeah.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Because it's revealed to them.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; They have his mind.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; That's what has to be quickened.
[2:08:45] Some of them will never be quickened.
[2:08:47] They just don't have it. That's all.
[2:08:50] What don't they have? That tug.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; That that that representation in them.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; That seed to be quickened, be brought
[2:08:57] alive.
[2:08:59] So you see if so so just like if you put
[2:09:03] a grain of a corn of in the grain of
[2:09:05] corn in the ground know how however
[2:09:07] pretty it is if it don't have the germ
[2:09:08] of life in it can never be quickened but
[2:09:10] the germ of life has to be there first
[2:09:13] and he said when he come forth in the
[2:09:15] morning because I live you live also not
[2:09:17] only see watch what did he tell he
[2:09:20] brother Brandham said when he quoted
[2:09:21] that scripture the prophet said he was
[2:09:23] speaking to his bride because I live you
[2:09:26] live also
[2:09:28] Not only was he the beneficiary of the
[2:09:30] resurrection, but all those seed that
[2:09:32] was resting in God's great promise was a
[2:09:35] benefactor of that resurrection of life.
[2:09:37] Because he said, "Because I live, you
[2:09:38] live also." That was the breaking of the
[2:09:41] seal. Because he was brought up, so will
[2:09:44] everyone that's in Christ be brought up
[2:09:46] with him. I'm sure this morning, did you
[2:09:48] catch that? I I don't have time to go
[2:09:50] back on these things. I'm sure this
[2:09:52] morning that even we who believe it
[2:09:54] cannot comprehend what a great thing
[2:09:56] that was. Because he raised from the
[2:09:58] dead, we also have raised from the dead
[2:10:01] for we were in him.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Because he raised from the dead, we also
[2:10:06] have raised from the dead because we
[2:10:08] were in him.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; The revealing of himself in you is the
[2:10:13] identification that you've come through
[2:10:15] the blood.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; There's not one sin that can be brought
[2:10:18] against you. Not one accusation.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; God is not going to accuse you when
[2:10:25] you're in himself.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; You're freed from the law.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; The spirit of life hath made me free
[2:10:32] from the law of sin and death.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're ministers of the spirit, not
[2:10:37] of the letter.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:42] [Applause]
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; I wish I could just have time to
[2:10:44] reiterate that, but that's it. All
[2:10:46] right. Now
[2:10:49] I'm coming to a close here. Just just
[2:10:51] hold on. I know that's not this the
[2:10:54] second time. That's not the third
[2:10:55] closure. All right. That right now.
[2:11:11] Let this mind be in you which was also
[2:11:13] in Christ Jesus. We know what the
[2:11:15] scripture said on that. And so we won't
[2:11:18] take that time. We will in another time
[2:11:20] maybe come back to that. Your life is
[2:11:22] gone and you are dead and your life is
[2:11:24] dead and you are hid in God through
[2:11:26] Christ and sealed in there by the Holy
[2:11:27] Spirit. The mind that was in Christ is
[2:11:29] in you and Christ in the Bible and the
[2:11:31] word is the same. Christ the Bible the
[2:11:34] word is the same.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; So if you be Christ, the prophet
[2:11:40] identified Christ the bride, the bride
[2:11:43] is Christ. Yeah.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you So everything he said
[2:11:50] in the beginning, okay, then you and the
[2:11:52] word and God and Christ are the same. If
[2:11:54] you abide in me and my word in you, ask
[2:11:57] what you will, it'll be done.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you are planted in his
[2:12:03] death, burial, and resurrection, planted
[2:12:05] in Christ and receive his Holy Spirit
[2:12:07] life in you. Everything that you ever
[2:12:09] need, all everything that you have,
[2:12:12] you've got need of all the way through
[2:12:14] the journey is in you right then. For
[2:12:17] you are the seed. You become the seed.
[2:12:21] You are the seed. See God in his word.
[2:12:25] Now, what does a tree have to do when
[2:12:26] you plant it? The only thing you have to
[2:12:28] do, and I'm closing on these statements,
[2:12:30] the only thing you have to do is water
[2:12:32] it. And then it's got to drink. The
[2:12:35] leaves in it, the apples are in it.
[2:12:37] Everything's right in that tree. If it
[2:12:39] be an apple tree, if it's got it's got
[2:12:41] to drink. It's got to drink more than
[2:12:43] its portion. There is a great statement.
[2:12:47] Well, I read I read a few I've read a
[2:12:50] couple few verses here this morning, and
[2:12:52] I've done my job.
[2:12:55] You got to drink a little more than
[2:12:57] portion.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Other words, it's pressing in. We press
[2:13:01] toward the mark for the prize of the
[2:13:03] high calling.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; As it drinks, it's got to drink. As it
[2:13:08] drinks, it pushes out. Pushes out
[2:13:10] leaves, pushes out blossom, pushes out
[2:13:12] apples. It's got to keep drinking,
[2:13:15] drinking, drinking in order to push out.
[2:13:17] Now we're and when we take a promise of
[2:13:19] God, drop it into our heart, we keep
[2:13:22] watering it with faith and it keeps
[2:13:24] pushing out, pushing out. Hallelujah.
[2:13:26] When Christ is planted in our heart, the
[2:13:28] Holy Ghost, the only thing you we do is
[2:13:30] drink in the word of God. And it pushes
[2:13:32] out salvation, pushes out divine
[2:13:34] healing, pushes out glory, it pushes out
[2:13:37] everything that we have need of is right
[2:13:39] in us when we're planted in Christ
[2:13:42] Jesus.
[2:13:45] All right. That's the seed.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Everything that seed is has to be come
[2:13:50] manifest. Amen. Because why? It fell
[2:13:52] into good ground. He he he he
[2:13:56] broadcast the seed, spoke the seed, fell
[2:14:00] on this type of ground, fell on this
[2:14:01] type of ground, fell over here and
[2:14:03] thorns and fell over here. But it some
[2:14:05] fell on good ground.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; What ground? Predestinated ground.
[2:14:09] Planted ground. germ the weed he planted
[2:14:13] remember the farmer planted his seed
[2:14:15] good seed in the field
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; and the waters came down but the waters
[2:14:19] fell on weeds
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; it fell on hybrids
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; right
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; one called him be elsub one called him
[2:14:24] this one called him something else to
[2:14:26] call you but what about
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; those that fell on good ground
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; what are they going to manifest
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; see so so the life the word the sun will
[2:14:37] bring up both seeds
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; that's right
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; that's Right? It falls the spirit or or
[2:14:43] does the body. If I if you were to kill
[2:14:45] me and I lay down here, you could pour
[2:14:47] all kinds of water on me. You put all
[2:14:48] the Holy Spirit on me. This body will do
[2:14:50] nothing. So the spirit is or is
[2:14:53] anointing your spirit realm, your spirit
[2:14:56] man, not the soul. Now it it it's it can
[2:14:59] be anointed. The spirit can be anointed.
[2:15:02] The anointing was for that seed in the
[2:15:04] soul.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; But it can fall on the spirit, which it
[2:15:07] does. Amen. Are you with me? Yeah. Amen.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; And it can make you do signs and
[2:15:10] wonders, but never be able to see the
[2:15:12] word for the season.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; And keep you from it.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; I won't say anymore. You know what the
[2:15:21] Bible said, the rain falls on the just
[2:15:22] and the unjust.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; It brings them to maturity, both of
[2:15:26] them.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; But one is able to receive and hear and
[2:15:30] manifest the word for the season.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; All right. Now
[2:15:38] you take that tree, plant it in the
[2:15:39] ground, okay? Water pushes out leaves,
[2:15:42] blossom, push out apples. And that's the
[2:15:44] way a Christian is. We are planted
[2:15:45] together in Christ Jesus who is the
[2:15:47] inexhaustible fountain of life. We are
[2:15:49] planted in Christ and we just drink,
[2:15:51] drink, and drink and push out and
[2:15:54] everything we have need of for the
[2:15:56] earthly journey, divine healing, the
[2:15:58] power of God, and all these other things
[2:16:00] is in every individual that's received
[2:16:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. For you
[2:16:04] are planted in Christ. Hallelujah. The
[2:16:07] Holy Ghost baptism. Yes, sir. Everything
[2:16:09] you have need of in this journey. Even
[2:16:11] the rapture is right in you then. The
[2:16:15] rapture is in us now. I'll prove it by
[2:16:17] the gospel. Those that he called, he
[2:16:19] justified. Those that he justified, he
[2:16:21] glorified. Those that he justified, he
[2:16:24] hath glorified. There's your answer.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Then in heaven today, we are glorified
[2:16:30] in the presence of God. right now. I'm
[2:16:33] just pushing out to it. Amen. Glory. God
[2:16:36] in his word. You believe it? All right.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Stand with me and then don't play
[2:16:43] anything yet. I just want to read a
[2:16:45] couple things more. This is what we're
[2:16:48] looking for now. Now, just bear with me.
[2:16:51] This is the closure right here. What a
[2:16:53] great thing it is today, Lord, to know
[2:16:55] that we are now united with one spirit.
[2:16:57] One spirit, the Holy Spirit has got the
[2:17:00] word in his grip comes in us.
[2:17:04] And what a great thing it is, what a
[2:17:06] privilege to cut loose from the world,
[2:17:08] to unite ourselves to Jesus Christ. And
[2:17:11] to think that someday in a physical form
[2:17:14] with a body like his own glorious body,
[2:17:16] we will sit down at the table at the
[2:17:19] wedding supper and there be united and
[2:17:21] wed in marriage to him. to live as a
[2:17:24] bride and bridegroom through all times.
[2:17:26] That is to come through a ceaseless
[2:17:29] eternity.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Lord God, may this not be a mythical
[2:17:33] thought to the people. And let me say
[2:17:35] this morning, but may it become such a
[2:17:38] reality till such hunger and thirst will
[2:17:40] set in the people that that they'll read
[2:17:43] their newspapers looking upon listening
[2:17:45] at the radio and the news and see its
[2:17:47] uniting time.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; The signs. What is uniting? We see the
[2:17:53] uniting of these other things. But what
[2:17:54] about the bride and the word uniting?
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; All right. But but seeing it's uniting
[2:17:59] time. The signs are flashing. And to
[2:18:02] think of us standing to think of us now,
[2:18:05] now he's turned it to the bride. To
[2:18:07] think of us standing in a moment in a
[2:18:10] twinkling of an eye when the world won't
[2:18:12] even know what's going on. Won't know
[2:18:14] what's going on. But all of a sudden,
[2:18:16] you you'll see appear before you your
[2:18:19] loved ones that's gone on has come to
[2:18:21] unite with you again. And we'll be
[2:18:24] changed in a moment, in a twinkling of
[2:18:26] an eye, and be caught up together to
[2:18:28] meet our Lord in the air.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; You tell me if that's not what we're
[2:18:32] looking for right now.
[2:18:35] I look for it every day. I look for my
[2:18:38] loved ones to appear before me.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right.
[2:18:44] My loved ones is everyone there in that
[2:18:46] theophony body is my loved ones.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It can be my loved ones relations,
[2:18:51] but they'll tell you every one of them
[2:18:53] are my loved ones.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; That's my family.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; And I'm looking for that appearing.
[2:18:58] Brother, sister, we're so close to that
[2:19:00] you can almost taste it.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's just a word to speak it,
[2:19:03] but I mean, it's that close.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Because why? A bride's coming to her
[2:19:09] maturity.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; She knows who she is. She sees what she
[2:19:12] is. She sees her position and lining up
[2:19:15] with every word because she is the word.
[2:19:20] Her husband is the word.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, won't that be a time then to unite
[2:19:29] with him to be there forever and never
[2:19:31] have to be out of his presence again.
[2:19:33] Oh, won't that be a time? Just walking
[2:19:35] along someday and here appears somebody.
[2:19:39] Who is it? Mother. Amen.
[2:19:42] it. And that means a lot to me and
[2:19:45] probably a lot to others here that have
[2:19:47] lost a mother that was a real believer.
[2:19:50] See?
[2:19:52] All right. Amen. It ain't going to be
[2:19:54] long now. Just a few minutes, you're
[2:19:57] changed when you meet him. And we'll
[2:20:00] meet them. Then be caught up together
[2:20:02] with them to meet the Lord in the air.
[2:20:03] Oh, what a Oh, in a moment. In the
[2:20:06] twinkling of an eye. Say, "Here is
[2:20:07] brother Seard, the old brother that used
[2:20:09] to be at the church here. Why? Here's
[2:20:11] brother Dark. Why? Here's brother so and
[2:20:13] why lookucky here. They're all around
[2:20:15] me. What's the matter? Just in a few
[2:20:18] minutes. I know they've done appeared to
[2:20:20] me. It ain't going to be long now. I'm
[2:20:22] going to be changed now. Just in a
[2:20:24] moment. Just in a moment. Oh yes. In the
[2:20:28] And the morning breaks eternal, bright,
[2:20:30] and fair.
[2:20:34] I said that because that's what's ahead
[2:20:37] right now. That's where we're at.
[2:20:42] God has brought us up to date.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; We know where we're standing. This is
[2:20:48] our day.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Thy light has come.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Arise, bride.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Thy light has come.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; You'll be sitting here one of these days
[2:20:59] all consumed in your little place and
[2:21:01] too busy to feed upon the opened word.
[2:21:05] and say, "I thought we were I thought
[2:21:08] there was to be a rapture happen before
[2:21:11] this tribulation."
[2:21:14] What are we seeing happening? We're
[2:21:15] seeing the fulfilling of the word,
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; judgment.
[2:21:21] The judge has already took his stand.
[2:21:24] Amen. Amen. White-wigged.
[2:21:27] We see judgment's already struck the
[2:21:29] West Coast.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; We see judgment has already struck. He
[2:21:33] said, "It's already begun.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; It's heading right out into the full
[2:21:37] manifestation of those. We It's got to
[2:21:40] rapture out of here, brother, sister.
[2:21:41] We've got to leave."
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before before that, before Israel
[2:21:48] even gets their message, we've got to be
[2:21:50] out. We got to be gone. They're waiting
[2:21:51] for us to leave.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Just think of that. They're over there
[2:21:55] just waiting for us to get out of the
[2:21:57] way.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Two witnesses to come to them. Bring to
[2:22:01] them what happened. redemption than
[2:22:03] sealing.
[2:22:06] What a beautiful promise. We see so many
[2:22:08] things. There's so many things that we
[2:22:10] could speak of happening in the nation,
[2:22:12] happening here, happening there.
[2:22:14] Everything just times and seasons
[2:22:16] perfectly put together through all these
[2:22:19] years.
[2:22:21] You see, I don't know, brother, sister.
[2:22:23] I may I may not be here. I I trust that
[2:22:25] I am I can be here and alive and remain
[2:22:27] to be changed and see my loved one. But
[2:22:29] if I'm not, look for me.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; Because I'm gonna come out. I'll be one
[2:22:36] of those.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe my wife will be late sitting here.
[2:22:42] I'll appear to her. I don't know. I
[2:22:45] don't know. But I know we're close. You
[2:22:48] must make yourself ready.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; If there's even a tug in your heart,
[2:22:52] then why not surrender? Why are you
[2:22:54] willing to keep living for self?
[2:22:57] yourself hadn't taken you nowhere.
[2:23:00] This old self man corrupted as it was,
[2:23:02] it is. God in his mercy has sanctified
[2:23:05] it and cleansed it and called it his own
[2:23:08] and come down and live inside of you and
[2:23:10] said, "I'll quicken your mortal body and
[2:23:12] bring it subject to my word." Now, how
[2:23:14] much better do you want it?
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me when I said that?
[2:23:21] If the spirit that raised Jesus from the
[2:23:23] dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[2:23:25] Christ shall also quicken your mortal
[2:23:27] body. Other words, I'll bring it subject
[2:23:29] to my word.
[2:23:32] Amen.
[2:23:33] Heavenly Father, as we stand here this
[2:23:36] morning, my heart's trembling. I know
[2:23:39] I've taken time, Lord, and it's not my
[2:23:41] will to do that. You know that.
[2:23:44] But Lord, I believe it's your will.
[2:23:47] Father, if Lord, help us. Just help us
[2:23:50] to realize the importance
[2:23:54] of what's taking place in this hour. I
[2:23:56] know you'll give revelation. Open your
[2:23:58] little bride's heart to these things. If
[2:24:01] some have been slack, some have been
[2:24:03] slothful. Lord, put something in that
[2:24:06] something that they need to said, "No
[2:24:08] more. I made a decision.
[2:24:11] I'm going all the way with my Lord. I'm
[2:24:14] going to press in
[2:24:16] toward that mark, for that goal, for the
[2:24:18] prize of the high calling. Listen, this
[2:24:21] bride has a very high calling.
[2:24:25] Wonder, do you hear him calling?
[2:24:28] Do you hear him calling to you this
[2:24:29] morning to let go and let that little
[2:24:32] tug in your heart be quickened?
[2:24:36] You said, "Well, Brother David, I've
[2:24:38] I've I've repented. I've been baptized."
[2:24:40] Yes, many have.
[2:24:42] they've aimed at but then they got
[2:24:44] relaxed. They didn't go any further.
[2:24:48] Oh God, let there be a true baptism. If
[2:24:51] there's any seed here yet that have not
[2:24:53] been truly born again, let there come a
[2:24:56] true baptism upon the seed in their
[2:24:58] soul.
[2:25:01] But Lord, if that pull is there and as
[2:25:04] they feed on that word, they're drawing
[2:25:05] life to quicken that seed within them.
[2:25:07] Quicken that seed, Lord. They keep
[2:25:09] drinking, drinking, drawing.
[2:25:12] Let's keep drawing. Lord, help us to
[2:25:14] keep drawing.
[2:25:16] Lord, I pray for everyone. I don't want
[2:25:17] a one in here to miss that rapture.
[2:25:21] I'm asking you to become so alive in
[2:25:23] them and the person of Christ to be
[2:25:25] known to them and made alive. That seed
[2:25:27] in them quickened and made alive. And
[2:25:30] they know you, the person, the word, not
[2:25:33] a feeling, not an emotion, not a coming
[2:25:36] to church. And we believe in coming to
[2:25:38] church. we but these things won't save
[2:25:40] us.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; It's knowing you.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; It's knowing you, Lord. And submitting
[2:25:47] ourselves completely to you. A lot's
[2:25:50] been said this morning. A lot could be
[2:25:53] said further. And if it be your will,
[2:25:55] maybe we could come back and take a part
[2:25:57] two on this. I don't know, Lord. There's
[2:25:59] so much more. But Father, I commit every
[2:26:02] individual here, every individual on the
[2:26:05] internet, everyone that's hearing this
[2:26:06] voice, may they truly hear the voice,
[2:26:13] Lord. May they truly realize they're the
[2:26:16] mystery hidden in the word.
[2:26:18] And when you said you opened that book,
[2:26:20] you opened everyone. Who was the book?
[2:26:23] The book was given to the bride. She is
[2:26:25] the book. She is the living book. She is
[2:26:28] the living word.
[2:26:31] That book, her name, that mystery in
[2:26:34] there called her name and she's in
[2:26:36] there. The mystery of yourself made
[2:26:38] fully manifest the complete revelation
[2:26:40] of the whole thing. Lord God, have your
[2:26:43] way. Have your way with every
[2:26:45] individual.
[2:26:47] And Lord, I ask this now in thy name,
[2:26:49] the Lord Jesus Christ. Let him make that
[2:26:52] decision right now. Decide it. Decide
[2:26:55] it. Die. Just die completely. Die to
[2:26:58] yourself.
[2:27:00] and say, "I'm not going to live for self
[2:27:01] anymore. I made the decision, Lord. I'm
[2:27:04] going to feed and water that seed in my
[2:27:06] heart.
[2:27:08] Fill me, Lord. Fill me and refill me.
[2:27:10] Fill me and refill me till I'm changed
[2:27:13] in the moment. Till I'm changed. Change.
[2:27:16] Not only inward change, but the inward
[2:27:18] change for the outward change.
[2:27:21] Grant it, Lord, for your glory and
[2:27:23] honor. I pray in Jesus name I pray."
[2:27:26] Amen.
[2:27:28] Amen.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister.

[2:27:51] everything to him and I'm proclaiming in
[2:27:54] public that he is my Lord and Savior and
[2:27:58] I love him.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. We're going to
[2:28:01] come upon yours your confession in the
[2:28:05] name of Jesus Christ. Father, may this
[2:28:08] little sister be filled completely with
[2:28:10] your word for she's confessed publicly,
[2:28:14] Lord, that you are her savior, you are
[2:28:16] her salvation. She loves you and wants
[2:28:19] more of you. Then I say upon the ful
[2:28:22] upon her confession, I give to her the
[2:28:25] desire of her heart in the name of Jesus
[2:28:27] Christ. Amen.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Feed on his word.
[2:28:32] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:28:36] Oh, I'd like to see a few more come up
[2:28:37] here and start confessing that.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; I know there's some in here that need to
[2:28:42] turn around and say, you know what the
[2:28:44] Bible said? He that will confess me
[2:28:45] before men, I will confess before my
[2:28:48] father which is in heaven.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Don't you think little of her doing
[2:28:51] that. That was right.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; That took the Holy Ghost, sister. That
[2:28:55] wasn't just a That wasn't a That wasn't
[2:28:58] you. That was God in you.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; I believe him.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; I may not understand everything was
[2:29:05] said. I'm not asking her to. But one
[2:29:07] thing I do ask it touched her heart.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; How many of you has it touched?
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See what I'm saying this
[2:29:14] morning? What happened here?
[2:29:17] What you seen? This little sister
[2:29:20] confessed what she did. According to
[2:29:22] God's word, God has saved her.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; And I say, God, fill her.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Fill it overflowing.

[2:29:36] love him with all my heart.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; I was a very young boy, but I didn't
[2:29:40] stop there. I went on. God filled me and
[2:29:43] he's refilled me and filled me.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Filled me. He's still filling me
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; with revelation himself revealing
[2:29:50] himself.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Where are we standing today?
[2:29:56] [Music]
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; God bless that little sister for
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; not ashamed to stand up and say, "I love
[2:30:02] him and he's my savior."
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; How many raise your hands just as a sign
[2:30:08] say he's my savior.
[2:30:11] He's my salvation. He's my redemption.
[2:30:14] He's my my King. Amen. He's my Lord.
[2:30:18] He's calling for me for him to come me.
[2:30:21] Lay down everything else and give
[2:30:23] yourself over to me and let me work
[2:30:25] through you.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, with all of our hearts,
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; you see these hands.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; There's nothing hid behind those hands.
[2:30:35] But what you know
[2:30:40] [Music]
[2:30:41] God be with you.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; I couldn't raise your hand.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; I say God help you to raise it
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; and make it known.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking. This message is not a
[2:30:53] certain class of people.
[2:30:55] It's for you. Every one of you here.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not I can preach the gospel.
[2:31:01] You know what? I can be anointed to
[2:31:04] preach this gospel. But what am I
[2:31:06] preaching?
[2:31:08] The anointing doesn't save a preacher.
[2:31:12] Many preachers will preach will preach
[2:31:14] the word. But don't preach the word for
[2:31:16] the season.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it wasn't their
[2:31:18] miracles, signs, and wonders. It was
[2:31:20] their teaching on the word. What were
[2:31:22] they saying?
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; What are they preaching to you? Yeah.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; Is it the word for the season or some
[2:31:32] other season?
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, every one of you,
[2:31:39] if you aren't born again, you must be
[2:31:42] born again.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to get in by
[2:31:44] your good works and your merits. They're
[2:31:46] not going to they're not doing a thing
[2:31:48] for you. You must have a true baptism of
[2:31:51] the Holy Ghost in your soul.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; And if you're hungry for God and there's
[2:31:55] a tug in your heart, I say give up and
[2:31:57] give way to him right now. you go out
[2:32:00] that door, it may be too late.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to make it point blank to
[2:32:04] you. I don't know, but I know we're very
[2:32:07] close. You may not even make it home.
[2:32:09] You tell me where are you spending
[2:32:11] eternity.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Well, you tell brother David, I got an
[2:32:15] education. I'm not talking about your
[2:32:16] education. I'm talking about your soul.
[2:32:19] I'm talking about who's in that soul.
[2:32:21] Who are you feeding on? What is your
[2:32:23] motive? What's your objective? Where's
[2:32:24] your ambition today?
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; What's your preeminence? Oh my god.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Who Who is your absolute
[2:32:32] [Music]
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; What's you playing that?
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; I
[2:32:45] surren I say let it be a time of
[2:32:48] surrender this morning.
[2:32:51] I
[2:32:53] surrender
[2:32:55] all.
[2:32:57] You see these hands, Lord? I couldn't
[2:33:00] raise them unless there's something in
[2:33:01] me to raise my hands and to defy
[2:33:04] gravity. Lord, you made me raise my
[2:33:07] hands.
[2:33:08] Surrender
[2:33:10] all.
[2:33:13] You say, "Brother David, I don't have to
[2:33:15] surrender my hand." Answer that to him.
[2:33:17] You're not answering it to me. You're
[2:33:19] answering to him.
[2:33:23] He knows your motive. He knows your
[2:33:24] objective. I say let's surrender to him.
[2:33:27] Let's have it a time of surrender. Do
[2:33:30] you love him?
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; Let's give ourselves aresh to him then.

[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; do you. All means all.

[2:33:55] redeemer,
[2:33:57] redeemer,
[2:33:58] [Music]
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; my husband, girl.
[2:34:02] You remember in Ruth where he took his
[2:34:05] shoe in a public witness that I've
[2:34:06] redeemed Ruth and Naomi.
[2:34:09] You remember the next the next chapter,
[2:34:11] I think it is, or maybe the same
[2:34:12] chapter. What was next? He took the
[2:34:15] book.
[2:34:17] He took Ruth
[2:34:19] to be his wife.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; He'd done the work of redemption. Then
[2:34:24] he took Ruth to be his wife.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; He laid claim on what he purchased.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; That's what God's doing with the bride
[2:34:33] this morning.
[2:34:34] [Music]

[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; Sorry about the little commotion, but
[2:36:54] when the Lord says you need to do
[2:36:56] something, you better be obedient. Amen.
[2:36:58] You don't want to miss the vision. And
[2:37:00] if the angel is stirring the waters, you
[2:37:02] need to jump in there. Amen.

[2:37:06] such a word that we have that we heard
[2:37:08] today. And uh the Lord just pressed upon

[2:37:18] Amen.

[2:37:39] up your pen and write.

[2:37:47] must bring.

[2:38:10] she's a super church.
[2:38:15] She will do the gater works.
[2:38:21] She is filled with the mind of Christ.
[2:38:25] Now carried away by the serpent's lies.
[2:38:31] She cannot be deceived.
[2:38:36] She has thus sayeth the Lord or she
[2:38:40] keeps still.
[2:38:43] She's in love with him and she'll only
