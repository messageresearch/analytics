you from brother daniel fryho he'll be coming next month but he just sent greetings and uh i have right here second line of my notes brother trevor god rich in mercy amen saints let's not forget and let those things fade from our memory satan would say i'm going to fill up your time i'm going to fill up your mind i'm going to do this so you will forget what i have done for you god speaking to israel said why i'm paraphrasing it why have you so soon forgotten the miracles because they were busy just like you and i but god rich in mercy oh thank you lord tonight let's just give another handclap of praise to the lord hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah i should have just put this as a regular prayer request but just continue to remember the ongoing needs in the ukraine and russia brother sergey kind of keeps me filled in and my brother and sister people are like oh the great press is over no it's just started it's just started so don't forget to remember each one let's turn our bibles i want to speak to you tonight um you know sometimes saints i hear people say well well you know brother paul it's just you were in our car with us or you're at your kitchen table but um i think brother trevor is in my notes i mean brother trevor i'm sorry brother jason is in my notes amen brother jason's in my notes and i'm just like wow thank you lord but i'm going to find the camera amen hallelujah let's turn in the book of ephesians i want to talk to you this evening on the ability to withstand now my brother and sister uh you know the great oak tree amen the reason that oak tree can withstand every storm that has ever come its way is not because it says i am a mighty oak but it has taken the time in its life to sink its roots and the prophet of god shared with us and said it's in those storms of life that's shaking that that loosens the roots which gives them room to press deeper so i say today this evening sometimes we'll look at our circumstance and we say lord why stop and say thank you lord for shaking me that my roots can go deeper amen because my brother and sister there'll be many in this day the word promises that will be shaken loose but god is shaking you and we come to the time we think i'm being shaken like they're being shaken but god's shaking you in a different fashion because he's going to use your present circumstance to cause you to dig deeper you're going to cry out more you're going to get in the word more you're going to say lord i need you more than i did yesterday even then i did this morning and so while we say lord please make the test easy god says i'll give you the test that's necessary not what's easy hallelujah ephesians the sixth chapter just pray the lord would just help me to bring out this thought it's been rattling around in my head for a while amen finally now let's let's stop for a minute i just do a little homework you're familiar with the scripture the scripture is laying out about masters and servants and how to treat each other and what you do in these circumstances and it comes now and finally and says finally my brethren so it's including masters and servants it's not talking to a segregated class but it's talking to each and every one finally my brethren whether you're a master or you're a servant be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world now remember when satan was there on the pinnacle of the temple and he told jesus i'll give all of this world to you he was not bluffing god had deposited that into his hand now look what he's doing to people in this day here he's still i hope you catch this offering them the world so he's still using the same tactic the same approach again spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all pause to stand stand therefore we're standing tonight saints don't think about quitting don't turn about giving up don't i'm weary i'm struggled i this i that just come take the word of god and he says now that you've come to this place to stand then stand having your loins gert about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet sawed with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all now look at this i think you guys have caught this have you noticed a trend i was busy and i feel bad but i don't have to preach every service in this church brother david in his various topics that he was tying together tied faith in there brother chris comes along here a wednesday ago drives faith home hard and when i had this thought i didn't even make the correlation or it didn't strike me i didn't choose this because it had about faith in it but i even today was sitting there going hey wait just a second this actually fits i'm glad i fit with you guys above all take the shade the shield of faith don't forget your shield oh no i need a shield to block this and to block that you do it's called faith there's the shield it's faith it's not that we can defend ourselves well i can defend my position with the bible i can defend my position with the message why don't you defend your position with faith let faith faith is what has been given to us amen above take the shield of faith wherewith all ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god heavenly father we ask for your blessings tonight lord open your word to us make it so alive the lord we walk out of here tonight not saying brother paul preached a good sermon but thank you lord that you spoke to me lord i want to hear from you father and i desire for you to speak to the saints in your precious name we ask this amen and amen you may be seated now i want to just drop back a little bit brothers if you'll take me back i guess i can do that here as we'll look at this my brother i want to go back to verse 11. it says put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil now this word may is expressing possibility and just follow along with me if you would tonight this possibility is declaring that you guys may or have this possibility to actually stand against the wiles of the devil now if we were talking about possibilities maybe we would have to put percentages and say well you know 50 of the time i'll feel like a successful christian if 50 percent of the time i can stand against the wiles of the devil and various people some would say no i would be 75 some might be having a bad day and so well for me it's probably 10 percent but my brother and sister we want to follow the correlation of the word and then do we we believe the prophet brought clarity to the word right amen he didn't come to change the word as some want to do but he come to bring clarity in the word and so as we look at this that he may amen this is expressing possibility be able in other words i have a possibility of standing against the wiles of the devil but you see god makes possibilities realities he's not just there as brother chris spoke to us the other night says you know if god said it he meant it amen so god isn't saying well you know i'll be happy you know you can make you can play major league baseball and only hit 300. that's one out of three balls my brother and sister i don't want to win just one out of three trials i want to come to a place that i am so into the presence of god so into his word that i can stand up as a soldier of the cross not representing myself but representing him right we don't want to be shoddy we want to express ourselves we want to be able to present ourselves as a godly people and so you know it is there in verse 13 that he tells you that you may be able once again expressing possibility to withstand in the evil day and having all done having done all to stand so it's here again expressing this possibility that you would be able to withstand the evil of our day now i'm telling you as as a man i hope this doesn't come across wrong but as a man i i i have had my own struggles through the years you know something that you know happened in my teens it took me a lot of years 21 years in fact to really be able to kind of overcome and step beyond those things and my brother and sister there was a time in my life that i thought nope this is what it is god's given me a godly wife but i'll never be able to to live this or be able to do this and as a minister as a pastor i've heard many people say brother paul i would serve god but i'm just not able to live it well let me express there's possibility and where there is a chance of life my brother and sister we do not give up we keep pressing amen i had a man ask me one time said well you know we got this certain circumstance i got a wife she's got cancer i don't know what the will of god is i said brother i can answer that for you not because i am smart not because i am some super spiritual guy but the word of god always expresses life so you need to pray for something you pray for life there's a sinner out here you don't say well lord if they could be you claim them in the name of jesus christ because you're claiming life amen and when you come into that atmosphere that your first instinct is not to say oh that's too bad but your first instinct is to say lord as the prophet did to that young lady i believe it's a sermon choosing of a bride that that young lady got up in the service and she walks out and i know brothers have personal testimony sitting there in that service and they walked out that young lady did and and you could tell she was disagreeing with the prophet and he stops and i don't even know if it's actually on tape but he speaks enough that people heard he says i send the holy spirit after that young lady she goes out the door in about 10 minutes or so rough estimate of time she comes back in sits through the rest of the service now i'm telling you my brother and sister if god would send a prophet to express those words then why can't we why can't we send the holy spirit out i've got a son we might say i've got a son or a daughter i've got a husband i've got a wife i've got a brother i've got a sister send the holy spirit after them don't sit back and say whoa unto us i think they're lost but sinned amen but i'm telling you when you start sending the holy ghost you better have yourself presentable your own self because god doesn't like to use vessels that are tarnished so let's get ourselves amen let's get on fire let's get our and start sending the holy ghost now amen because you see my brother and sister i'm going to come and counter dick myself later if you don't mind but you see we should be taking the position of expressing possibility amen all tatted up pierced come on the flesh says no it can't be them let's express possibility lord there's a soul inside that that body there lord it might be tarnished but lord there's a soul in there i'm claiming life for that soul but the devil gets us down sometimes saints we can't even claim life for our own family you would think amongst all that we would want life for our own family but the devil gets us into such a place so we look and my i should have rearranged these notes differently you know that above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench some of the fiery darts of the wicked can somebody say that really loud oh amen let's not settle for some people say well i've been hurt in church well i'm sorry to hear that but let's get in a position to quench that not to carry that burden for years and years and decades saying i was hurt a bad pastor about a judgmental church or a false doctrines or whatever let's get in a position to quench that once and for all to put that under the blood and just wipe all the power to control our life right out of that because otherwise satan will just keep pouring gasoline on the fiery dart or send another one to strike in the same position not for years my brother and sister of a church carrying on burdens of something that is so bygone so far behind them but still so fresh that as though they lived it yesterday now we're human right i don't make that as an excuse but see we'll say but you don't understand what i went through but you saying you don't understand what you went through is telling you telling me that you don't understand what quenching all the fiery darts is i don't say that judgmental i just say that let's go to the place of quenching the dart and let the past go away and let's look to the mark of the high calling in christ jesus let that become our focus not what happened to me here or what happened to me there but let the mark of the high calling become our focus that nothing else matters but moving forward in jesus christ now paul is speaking to the ephesians and if i could put it this way he gave them kind of you might say a recipe on how to withstand now the word withstand is to be undamaged or unaffected now those of you who went through trials church splits problems and families problems with ministries you would say but this has affected me so deeply let's get out of the carnal realm step into the spiritual god's telling you i'll quench that that you will be unaffected but we got to get out of this flesh my brother and sister to understand what paul was speaking to the ephesians because paul was not concerned about their emotion i read you the quote the other day the prophet of god said i'm not concerned your emotions not my problem so paul's not speaking to their emotion and he's not preach speaking or preaching to their present physical circumstance paul was preaching to the soul he was there to tell them look what i want to do is i want you to be able to withstand all the fiery darts of the enemy and in the spiritual realm my brother and sister is where are where well warfare excuse me our warfare is not physical right it's too spiritual we've covered that it's a spiritual side and you know we say well i'm not undamaged if we were to be honest tonight looking back in church and family and et cetera experience we'd say no i am not undamaged i am damaged in in a sense but i want you to get out of that initial overlapping of the carnal and look at this are you in the same place you was five years ago amen we have moved forward and satan has tried to stop you but if the soul is growing amen if the spirit in you is growing if the spirit has more control of your life today than it did a year ago my brother and sister you're not damaged you're growing but we look at this in the hurt and the pain and satan tries to overlap that and make that the thing that you see but god's trying to uncover that and tell you can't you see you're growing spiritually you're growing spiritually you've got more holy spirit living in you controlling you than you did last year then you did five years or ten years i am with you i am even in you to the end of the world and this work i have begun in you i will finish and god's not going to create you as a limping dragging whatever going through the gates we are overcomers we are the representation or the manifestation of the power of god on the earth today we're not a bunch of spiritual cripples we're not a bunch of people that are just barely getting by we are the bride of christ and he did not clothe us in some defeated spirit he did not clothe us with the spirit of i might make it he has come and declared you're my wife and i have chosen you and i have made the way before you and i made the rough places smooth for you and we say oh life is so hard i just sometimes struggle with the idea that god's made it smooth well imagine what it would be if he wasn't in your life oh my brother and sister some people would be like oh you're just trying to scare us no i'm not i'm just telling you in reality our lives we would be there amongst our midst today without god we would be drunks we'd be street walkers we'd be living in alleys we'd be alcoholics we'd be dialect in the world we live in but he gives this recipe how to be undamaged or unaffected now we would say you know what my life has been altered by this struggle i face and on the surface saints that would be right isn't it we have faced sicknesses heartbreak but let me throw something a little curveball as it were to you your life has not been altered by your struggle because the struggle is what god is using to move you from where your flesh thinks you ought to be to where his word said you will be oh come on we ought to be able to say thank you lord for the struggle i i you know it's a bad analogy to say i'm that little chicken but in the story the prophet of god is talking about how if you try to help that little chicken break out of that shell you'll kill it now look what god's doing my brother and sister it's not an ecumenical move out here it's not some great denomination or some great preacher it's christ himself the holy ghost moving and breaking the shell of your life so that you can come out victorious and glorious to express who you are hallelujah i want to change that story to an eagle hallelujah i'm not a chicken neither are you but you see we think all my life has been changed it's been altered by this struggle no as i want to repeat the reality is the lord is moving us into our correct position now i'm not talking to stubborn people i'm not talking to you i mean i'm talking to stubborn people but the more we hang on are you with me i'm not talking about the hanging on to the word as a son or daughter of god i'm talking about hanging on to opinions and emotions and positions and things that we think and the more we hang on the more pressure god's got to apply to move us oh that he should just go throw our hands up say lord i'm letting go you've got to move me you've got to carry me you've got to make it happen lord i don't need to be crushed to dust i want to just yield to you hallelujah because you see this struggle is just a tool have you ever noticed there's people now maybe you don't deal in this realm but i know brother david for certain will know what i'm talking about i'm not sure if chris has experienced this but you'll find people and they'll talk about why they're not in church they'll talk about why they're not doing this and then they pin it out and they say well i'm not in church because of brother david but did you know the reason they're not in church is because they're actually angry at god this man right here how can a man a minister who gets just a few hours you know all the ministry together only gets a few hours in a week to captivate your time how can they control your life come on and especially seeing how us being a con cult we have such control over you yeah we are the worst managed cult on the face of the earth you guys appear at church but even to them it sounds wrong to start blaming god so they find i know none of you have ever blamed anybody else for something you did now multiply that many times over in influence of satan trying to get you i mean look at the devil he's going to rejoice that people are angry at god they won't talk to god don't won't listen to him the devil's out there i've got it figured out if i can get them so disappointed so angry so whatever that they won't even talk to god won't listen to him then i don't even have to i don't care how much of the message they have on the shelf we realize the struggle is just a tool that god uses and when the bride of christ submitted to god to the holy spirit recognizes i didn't look circumspectly at that i just went out and did this and this i never even prayed about it i didn't even seek the mind of god while jackson wouldn't even take a drink of water but what he stopped and gave thanks to the lord i just make that as a point saints so our present circumstance we'd say well you know i don't know how i got in this and you know i feel that way myself sometimes saints you know i just like you know i i could i could do this and this but i made this decision now i have an obligation here i must do this to keep my own word or take care of it and you realize you didn't think it through in the beginning and now we have to pay a price and if we're not careful that price can be a separator or a wedge that the devil will use to keep us out of the house of god to keep us from a prayer life keep us from reading the bible keep us from fellowship now when you see people start to forsake fellowship people say well they're just they're just not social my brother and sister we are not human in the sense the rest of the world is the scripture says that we should associate with one another that it is fellowship that is something that is necessary for us and the devil comes and people get the idea hey i can i can do this without fellowship well i want you to go back and take the bible and i want you to prove to me that you segregating yourself away from fellowship of the body is scriptural i'm pretty bold to make that challenge because it's not there there's nothing encouraging that to recognize this struggle is just a tool god uses now look i need to hurry right along here see where a wrestle is now see we've been looking at this whole struggle we're talking about struggle and and we're looking at this and see where our wrestle is today i gotta love this english i just love it so much see what the death angel is it's spiritual power wickedness in high places great places big places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand the evil day i say we're there i fought years ago that we were in sodom my brother and sister i'll tell you how naive i was it is so so so much worse right now than it was when i was sure we were in sodom it just eclipses it but look at this now the word of god is coming to tell us you may be able to withstand the evil day and having done all to stand to stand stand stand therefore having your loins girded about you with truth now i'll just hit that one because i want to get back to my subject see this made me feel good brother brown just gets off watch him he goes ahead and says the breastplate and the helmet and everything else wish we could dress that soldier up for you here but we haven't got the time imagine as it would be that we literally spent all the time and delved into this and realized what god is trying to convey to us what the apostle paul is trying to convey it is not just a matter of us going okay i'm going to try for this but this is a matter oh i'm going to spill the beans before i get there this is a matter of completely dressing ourselves this is not i'll just put on a breastplate and that ought to be good enough well they'll just cut your leg off my brother and sister no it's not a matter about covering your head and saying my knowledge or my understanding is good enough it's not a matter of these little pieces it takes the whole armor of god let's not settle for intellectual conception let's not settle for having 90 percent let's not settle for 75 we have to put on the whole armor of god amen amen brother brown says well we ain't got time let's just take the loins right that's here not to be crass but that's where our strength and that's where life lies is in the loins girded about with a girdle that's the belt that holds the rest of it amen all together you realize if we do not have the life of christ we can have all kinds of head knowledge we can do everything just right we can say the right things we can think the right things but if we haven't protected the life of christ which is the strength of the believer then we have not done anything amen so it's there gerd your loins what we're girding it with not intellectualism not with popularities or these kind of things but gird your loins with truth in the day brother when there's all kinds of isms and fanaticism it's time to gird yourself with the truth oh look at this i don't mean to be too bold tonight but we're coming that we're not much different saints than the rest of the religious world we've got all kinds of isms and schisms we've got all kinds of voices saying if you're not following our way you won't have eternal life well i'll tell you what i'll do my brother and sister i'm going to come and i'm a little ahead of myself but i'm going to stick with it is written i'm going to stick with what god put down and said this is what you need this will do it this will get you through the battle this will get you into victory this will get you into the kingdom this will do it so i don't need a man that needs my money i don't need a man that needs my accolades i don't need a man that's trying to boost me up i need the word i need truth and when i've got truth what is it when my loins are girded with truth i can go forth and i can declare on my worst day i am victorious i can declare on my worst day i have withstood the devil i have withstood the enemy and the work that god began in me he promised he would finish it and the devil's not going to convince me any different because he spends a lot of time does he not convincing us or trying to so there's all kinds of isms and fanaticism it's time and i want to just say saints tonight not judging anyone i don't mean it that way but it is time for us to gird ourselves with truth not little somethings they're hanging on the edge and we kind of brush them aside because we've we've decided or maybe someone decided for us that happens you know that's not important don't worry about it it doesn't apply to you if it is written it applies it's time to gird yourself with the truth hallelujah jesus said i am the truth i love that hallelujah amen now look i tell you when people say what about this and what about that it's good to see the old truth hallelujah i know this kind of seems silly but it's just good to see that old truth around us you've all seen that little picture you know that shows the bride and she's wrapped in the word and it's all trailing around her what she didn't just throw on uh what what they call that a veil she didn't throw on a veil that's the word right she just didn't you know i don't know i'll get myself in trouble here i haven't ate my shoe in a while so maybe tonight's just good a night to shoot eat some shoe leather but you know she didn't just gird herself with the undergarment of truth you know what the undergarment of truth is the secret believer the one would never know that they really believed because all you see on the outside testifies of something different but i'll cut through all of this for the sake of time she's the one that started pardon me it's referenced to a sister but she's the one who her undergarments are truth her outer garments are truth her veil is truth amen she walks in truth she talks in truth she lives in truth and she expresses or manifests truth that's one that has been girded with truth amen she's not a sunday christian she's not a wednesday christian she is a christian seven days a week 24 hours a day amen that's what the king saw in esther that's why he loved her she was real she wasn't some fake or an imitation she was a real thing amen there stand there let them say well you have this that or the other you know where you're standing can someone say amen to that we know where we're standing tonight we're not waiting for the next excuse to hit the message to walk away we're here because we are going to withstand every buffeting every wind of false doctrine and everything that comes we're going to live through that because we read the word and we said he's talking about me he's not talking about someone else the pastor the pastor's wife this person that person is talking about me and i might be the lowest and the most lowly of all that he's talking about me hallelujah because i have buckled the whole armor on and gird around and buckled down good and tight and pulled down with the truth of god's word anchored i'm going to change this not in tents out there anchored in my hallelujah if the pastor don't go in the rapture i'm going song leader don't go i'm going elders of the church don't go i'm going there's nothing going to detour me nothing's going to stop me i'm going come for me lord jesus come quickly look that little girl that was there with the armored meat packers and all them daughters and whatever it was she didn't go out there and say now if you guys want to take my place no sir somebody thought brother trevor she wasn't very spiritual because when that wagon started coming some of them other girls might have said well i'll just step in there kind of flounce my way up and catch his attention what did she do she had that suitcase she had her wedding garment on and she said he's not coming for you i am prepared i have the wedding garment i have all that he asked me to do and you get out of my way because this has come for me this is my rapture this is my calling away this is my fulfilling of the word for the hour i am the one that god called to be the bride to take the rapture it's not this worldly daughter it's not this worldly niece or cousin i'm the one that he spoke the words to i'm the one that he met out on the backside of the building separated from the spirit of the world in the quietness and said i like you amen i love you oh how could god love me i'm such a rat and i am oh i'm just a dish girl but god said i see your character i see your nature i see your desire and i knew you before the foundation of the world you're mine oh hallelujah oh my you're right brother david that's the seventh seal look at that pulled down with the truth of god's word anchored anchored saints anchor now that's not some chunk of metal you threw in the water and then the boat just keeps blowing with the wind that's not an anchor definitively on the deck of the boat you could call it an anchor but an anchor is something that hooked into something that's right and then it holds in the time of the storm people say well i'm i'm anchored i'm anchored in my church i'm anchored in this i'm anchored that they're blown that way and they're blown that way and you have to just stop and say what what i don't understand i'm still working on this part right after paragraph 96 hope you all don't mind if i make that confession and i see a storm cloud come over the mountains i stop and i say lord please please lord i've done this so many times saints you'd probably think oh my goodness brother paul why would you confess this in public because i believe the word amen it says it's good for my soul i've stopped in the corner of a hayfield so many times and said lord please let this storm pass then i felt selfish because it would be somebody else's hay field and to watch the storm go way out there and say thank you lord to see it turn around amen and come right back and then as i'm sitting there in a tractor watching sheets of water run off of the tractor and i'm like why lord why and then the prophet of god says everything god does are you with me everything what is outside of everything everything god does is for your edification amen lord i guess we needed rain in my flesh i feel huh and i think we call them ten thousand dollar rainstorms because many times that's exactly what it costs us but he's never left his children begging bread oh what about this and what about that i've never had to beg for bread god is in control saints and you come to the time you have to decide i will trust him or i won't because i can't straddle the fence i've got to trust you lord because i can't disbelieve you i can't walk away from what you have done for me i have to trust you yeah all the devils in hell can't upset you and that's really in a spiritual connotation that's right now look at this this is what got me really excited you can meet satan and say it is written i am a child of god i have been called i have been sanctified i've been filled with the holy ghost i stand here on the word i know my identity it's written right here so devil you're just a liar and get out of my face as brother ron spencer says poor old devil poor old devil would come and try and kill me and all it did is make me dig deeper in the word of god all he did is make me confess more god is my healer poor old dumb devil oh hallelujah i got excited watching him preach that amen poor old dumb devil some people would say oh that's disrespectful talking the house of god that way well i'll tell you what my brother and sister our lord jesus just laid some pretty strong words on the devil amen amen maybe it's time oh come on maybe it's time we ought to practice up on saying it is written amen amen amen no we get on the pinnacle of our temple and we start to explain ourselves well i this and i that and i felt like this um and i you know this and they said this and the preacher preached that and yeah how about we just back up and say you know what my lord jesus christ my bridegroom told me it is written amen it is written i recorded it in the heavens i recorded it in the earth i recorded it in my written word you're the one you're my bride you're the chosen you're the one out of all that i picked it is written your name is in the book somebody ought to be able to rejoice my name is in the book it is written oh hallelujah well how do you know your name is in the book i can't really explain it to you but there's something down inside of me that i know that i know that i know my name is in that book and he called me he wrote it in his blood and i'm not going to doubt him amen amen hallelujah oh is it all right to be excited amen now look here and a greater than solomon is here now brother branham is referring to the little syrophoenician woman and he's talking about her circumstance and i want to take tonight and just kind of overlay or interface this of our circumstance most of you tonight have a circumstance don't you you're not living if you don't somebody check their pulse because every one of us that's living has a circumstance something is going on either with us or those around us in our world hallelujah and you realize that the devil has a voice in every circumstance he does not set mute my brother and sister you can even have this is an interesting testimony that was shared because god knows the faith that really resides in the heart and soul i believe it was a sister going through a prayer line and even as she's coming up to have holy ghost-filled godly men pray for her the devil's telling her going echoing in her head this is not for you you imagine you'd be thinking the lord's not going to touch me i'm i'm thinking all these negative thoughts this is not for me but down in the soul right brother trevor in the fleshly table of the heart not the stony table the mind is saying it's not for you but something had already been written on the heart god had already before a foundation written down in that heart this word is for you and she's up there with these thoughts coming in a prayer line it's not for me it's not for me she goes over there she's there it's all she could do her testimony was just to bow her head because she almost felt like crying out this is not for me but the brothers laid hands on her and as i spoke to you here recently how we are in such a turmoil and we can come to church and our thoughts are scattered and we don't even know if we're saved maybe we fought with a family or something on the way to church and you walk in the door and you almost feel like a hypocrite because you find yourself in the first or second song hands lifted worshipping the lord and the devil's like you hypocrite but we came in the presence of the prince of peace and that just flows over us and all of the devil's voice and all his accusation all of his crying out saying oh there's no one there's no one can help you in your circumstance the doctor can't do nothing for you and this and this and this and this and this and it's there my brother and sister and then we come into the presence can someone say hallelujah we come in the presence of the prince of peace and it all changes and in our flesh we almost feel i'm a hypocrite i don't know but you see what it is is the bombarding of the spirit of the day amen and god says i'm not worried even about the thoughts right the prophet of god says you know don't let the bird build the nest but the thoughts are still going to ping off of you and it is they don't just ping off of you one a day they praying off of you one a second or whatever it might be but the prince of peace comes and says don't worry about it i wrote it on your soul i wrote it in your heart and it will last it will take you through this storm oh my amen there's always boy i would sure turn that first sentence into a long one didn't i amen look there's always difficulties in the way satan throws everything everything in the way he can when he sees you trying to get religious when he sees you just quoting scripture quoting quotes no sir he said when he sees a real move of god come on saints we've walked out of this church i can assure you you're not much different than me we felt the presence of god moving here you walk out of church and before you get home to your dinner table these spirits satan attacking you because you're defeated that would be a really dumb army to attack an army that's already defeated amen so look what the prophet saying when he sees a real move of god get started he'll do it to you he'll put everything all the hindrances he can in your way remember the woman talking about the syrophoenician woman had oh i love this those of you the read ahead you're naughty but look at this look at this remember the woman had a lot of hindrance but her faith oh hallelujah her faith didn't have any hindrance that's why we got to separate ourselves it sounds like we're double-minded it sounds like we're some kind of confused people but my flesh says there's hindrances but the soul inside me says christ in me there is no hindrance amen but her faith didn't have any faith has no hindrance there is nothing going to stop it no matter what anybody says if you've got that right hold on god amen when i read this i had to read it again i had to read it again to make sure i was really reading it when you've got that hold on god wait god did i i didn't call god god called me but you see there's an element that god placed down in you why didn't the woman at the well tell them to go mind your business pardon me for being so bold but why didn't rahab just go ahead and turn on the light because they couldn't because they couldn't saints they couldn't quit they couldn't walk away they couldn't deny what had been brought to life in them it was unable to turn their back on that right oh and we were talking about that brother terry and i amen is there right in the lineage of jesus christ god didn't choose the perfect purity whatever god chose those to prove that his blood is more than sufficient hallelujah amen nothing going to stop her no matter what anybody says if you've got that right hold on god and god has got the right hold on you there can be 40 doctors standing here telling you he was dying telling you you was dying and you wouldn't believe one word of it no sir no sir because there's something inside of you that has already declared he is my healer and i received him the person of jesus christ and what he has said i believe and i believe that it will be oh can someone say i believe it will be amen we're not here just guessing we're not here hoping we are here with a steadfast confidence that what god said he meant for me amen there could be 40 clergymen standing here like ahab's 400 withstand if you're a machaya and you've got a hold of god and god has got a hold of you and you see it vindicated in the word come on what is it it's written it's written saints everything i need to make the rapture the prophet said is already in me is that me with an intellectual understanding of the message no it is a living word written in the very depths of my soul upon the table of my heart this word is true and this word is who i am i'm sorry i'm just a little excited tonight hallelujah my cane got a hold of god and god's got a hold of you you see it vindicated in the word that's why there's people like we just don't understand i mean the message is so outdated excuse me a minute i just had a flash i should look for an expiration date right brother branham's answer to the man that said the apostolic age is over brother brown says i can show you where god put it in can you show me where he took it out right no expiration date hallelujah this living word has been written on the table of my heart on the table of your heart and there is no expiration there is no exceptions and as i have spoke to you often enough there is no but amen right that negates everything in front of it god's got to hold to you you see it vindicated in the word there's nothing going to stop you you're going to stand there anyhow because something has got a hold of you oh hallelujah isn't that beautiful oh my oh my i i love that i'll just want to go back to that portion right there the more remember the woman had a lot of hindrance we could be bold tonight couldn't we we're not too we're not too high and mighty to lift a hand and say i've got a lot of hindrances but the faith amen this is why you've got to separate your flesh from your faith as long as your flesh is controlling your faith then your faith can never be activated but when you'll separate your flesh from the faith that's not saying two souls in any of this other nonsense that is you recognizing that god didn't come to redeem this vessel here he put inside of you a rapturing faith that will put you to meet your theophany and stand in his presence on that day oh hallelujah hallelujah her faith didn't have any because faith has no hindrance now look i already touched on this got all excited earlier going back to ephesians 6 verse 14. it says stand there for having your loins bout with truth my brother and sister i believe this right here even though brother branham doesn't bring it out in quite this fashion i believe this right here is part of the foundational uh move that god had of why we see all the way through his ministry and i would pray all the way through our ministry is it's always truth go back to truth amen you know how much more comfortable we would feel if we just fudged it just a little bit come on we could fill grace up have to build us a new church we could have all kinds of programs we might even be able to buy you choir gowns we might be able to publish a newsletter with your picture in it but we wouldn't have truth and the truth is more precious than even our very life that's why a prophet come back in the simplicity of the message and said take you back to the word back to the word back to the word and people are like such a boring topic that's right because the word is not in you you are not girded in the word because when you're girded in the word now i was going to use analogy that most sisters would never come to church and the first word somebody say oh nice no it's a rag i'm just wearing a rag to church today no sir i haven't beat up on sister jerry in quite a while but you know the other day she wore a dress to church i thought was quite charming and i had a couple other minor criticisms she gets in the car on the way home from church sister so-and-so and sister so-and-so complimented my dress she didn't really care what i thought sisters you don't know how much sway that you have more than i do of course but you see the devil's trying to tell you this message you don't have to dress this way you don't have to live this way you don't have to be that you can be this but then there's one that comes and says you are beautiful today you're my beloved you're my bride i'm so happy that's the voice that matters to us now i'm not saying that my voice don't matter to my wife that didn't come out quite right but you see we have to have our loin skirt about with truth and we have to have on this breastplate of righteousness amen there's no way we have to come then and walk see look at this the reason your feet have to be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace is that's the way you have to walk we can't walk in bitterness and anger frustration and all of these other spirits of the day oh i said oh that i'm sorry i was sister april was telling me that in atlanta can't even walk down the sidewalk and look at people and they're angry you looked at me be like okay no you see because there but we're here oh let the world look at us not who we are in the flesh but look who we are in jesus christ let them look we ought to say look at me look at me and i'm not boasting i'm boasting on my lord jesus he changed me from a drunk he changed me from this he changed me from that took me from a street put me in the middle of his word he took me out of this place put me right here i can walk in righteousness i can have my feet shod in this preparation of the gospel oh my brother and sister we ought to be able to say tonight thank you lord for what you're doing thank you lord for all that you've done for us now can i just read just a little further we're kind at the time i said i was going to close but please please amen let's go right down here see there's a reason my brother and sister there's a reason i kind of jumped away from that quicker because i just decided i need to reiterate that my brother and sister we need to come to a place that you quiet the voice of the devil you've got to quiet that voice because the word said that you would have christ and that would quench all and somebody say it with me again all the fiery darts of the enemy amen we don't have to live a life tormented we don't have to live a life of defeat we don't have to live a life of unfulfilled expectation as christian because we have a word that if we will apply it we'll quench that dart it will snuff the life right out of satan's voice it will snuff every accusation and everything that he would try to afflict you it will snuff it because we'll stand on the word and we will confess it and maybe we should just stand in our closet or wherever there is that you would find a quiet place and start repeating this scripture to yourself that it will quench all the fiery darts until you believe it amen come on kind of a little story a little joke of a preacher once challenged his church he says maybe you shouldn't even come back to church until you guys can believe all the word of god and next sunday there was nobody there because the people actually acknowledged they had a void but where does the word say we deal with the void in the house of god not in our basement not in our boohoo in the house of god amen now look at this exposition seven church ages revelation you guys know this quote probably know it could many of you could quote it right off let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of revelation of jesus christ in the church he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 of the theologians he knows that since god is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways i hope you're catching this amen because god's not going to come along and change his mind midstream but i this and i that and i'm no the prophet of god said don't don't speak those negative things don't talk the devil's language don't do that thus satan knows assuredly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church people say how do you know the message is true well by god's grace see what they expect you to do is to say well in this sermon and in this work sermon this quote that but you see what god has done to the true bride of christ he took you back to the book and said i want you to go and prove every thing this is actually brother brown's words i want you to prove everything by the bible well hallelujah i have confidence in that amen satan knows assuredly that the original so that's the true church that jesus claims is his own all else is false it has to be now remember this christ i just love this because i'm just arrogant i'm just arrogant enough to he was talking about me i'm sorry i don't know any of you feel that way you don't have to have arrogant but that's what the the distractors want to call you you're arrogant to think you are the bride of christ no i just read the book and the book spoke and the book told me you are my own you're my child you're my bride the book spoke not me speaking the book spoke amen all else is false it has to be now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts i think that's one of the reasons why i love that song a new testament church rising up it's not a new testament church imitating it's the real thing hallelujah but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal powerless oh can i just be bold enough to say tonight just as long as god would give me voice and i could stand in the position of your pastor we will defeat the spirit of lukewarm laodicea we won't compromise with it we won't lower the standard to fill the church up in fact i'm kind of feeling like we ought to maybe raise a standard one more notch amen and move to the mark of the high calling amen it's a real challenger my brother and sister that presses into it it's not the one that says hey can you guys lower that that's not the one you want to be on the same team amen can you just lower the qualifications so that i can kind of as it were sleep in and not do anything and i could still make it my brother and sister that's called the denominational spirit amen but god said no no i'm not going to do that what is it it exposes satan who wants to be an exposer yeah i want my life to expose the devil amen it exposes satan revealing his works what is he trying to do destruct amen the destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word now do you realize when the prophet of god spoke this most of the dissenters of our day knew nothing about what god was doing but this right here as the old phrase is hit the nail on the head and clenched it it identifies there's ways if you disagree i've told you guys about that time there in in north carolina where brother jewell took me to breakfast remember that sat down in that little cafe and caught me so off guard when that little lady probably 70 years old hair all done up and all this rouge and she had just the you know the bright red cheeks and and let you come in there in honest sincerity brothers my husband's back in the hospital the doctor said he's dying you prayed for him before and god came on this scene and i'm asking you to pray again i don't know about the outward side of her how god will judge all this but there was a woman that said i have seen results and i'm going to go right back where the results were in the beginning because i believe god will answer your prayers and those brothers prayed as earnest as they ever prayed for anybody i believe ever in their life and that little old lady with tears just running down it's really sad you see this i'm not trying to be funny but you see this probably have to go with the bathroom and straighten it all up again they ought to just let their tears wash it right off and be done with it but he's trying to discredit see how hard he's worked discredited he doesn't have to defeat you saints if he's discredited your life that's why the scripture says not even the appearance of evil let that be a governing factor for us not even the appearance okay i'm hurrying sister ruth come that'll really work it on me here amen right down to the time he's cast in lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she what stands for so it's not just one part it's multiple what she is and what she stands for and that come on do you know half the battle brother sisters pardon me i'm just so excited here half the battle in our life sometime is figuring out we can do it look from our childhood going forward hallelujah every young person i've seen it through the years my own children included okay dad's gonna teach you how to drive oh dad i can't do this give him just a few weeks dad can i take the car out [Music] why they figured out they can do it that's why by god's grace i pray our young people in this church and families and others in this church recognize i can do this i can live this i don't have to compromise i can do it i can do the greater works she will be an invincible army and if they get true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand right amen look this was standing my brother and sister this is what we're preaching on tonight a time that satan comes in like a flood and we have it in our mind god's gonna raise up a standard over here a big wall is gonna no that's already in you satan buffets you and faith in you which doesn't know any hindrance rises up and says no i'm not much but i am a child of god and i am not walking away look i had a man one time i shared this with you brother paul you oh you owe it to your church to get them away from the messenger you're a good pastor and they're good people you owe it to them and i said you're right i owe it to him really yeah so when you find something greater than this message i'll be gone in a heartbeat but don't plan on it [Music] silence them why they've quit and they're wandering around from pillar to post they don't know what they even want what they desire they can't find anything to satisfy the soul but yet they want you come join us come join us come be miserable no come get filled with a true revelation then recognize the spirits that's there and by god's spirit discern and withstand that spirit amen hallelujah what's the prophet say here people say well you know he didn't really write the church age book okay forget your nonsense just just if you don't believe it don't believe it but i believe it not because this person wrote it or that person wrote it i believe it because it is a perfect description of the believer in this hour and the unbeliever in this hour it is a perfect description of the spirit of the age and i can read that book and say well you care about it or not it's accurate it's real it's alive amen we're coming to a place saints whether you really feel it this evening or not i would ask you just to lift your hand and declare this spirit of the age is powerless before me this spirit has been bound by the holy ghost it is not me it is him it's always been him it'll never be about me it is always will be about him hallelujah hallelujah and he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ would withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation satan hates revelation come on saints these spirits are invading our realm where people are saying revelations overrated well i'm sorry that you're underrated and i don't mean that derogatory but you're underrated because revelation's not overrated to me revelation is life revelation is who i am revelation is the seventh seal open to us that we recognize that we are the very vessel that christ said i will come down in flesh in this day and i will manifest myself to all men oh hallelujah yeah satan hates it we love it true revelation our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them oh hallelujah let's just stand and worship the lord for a minute or two i i'm just gonna i'll tell you what excuse me i'm just overwrought tonight i know i'm just over the edge but i'm gonna lift both hands right here myself and i'm going to say lord thank you thank you lord for revelation because without revelation lord i would be simply some person caught up in some kind of theology i would have some kind of man-made idea i would have some kind of criticism or some kind of skepticism but by your grace i can hang my very soul on the word of god and knowing that it's good enough to take me and a rapture good enough to take you and a rapture good enough to take our children in a rapture hallelujah without a doubt without a doubt without one doubt oh brother jay please help me hallelujah hallelujah [Music] in the blood of christ my lord hallelujah is it okay to be excited in the house of god saints i'm telling you what i find it such a paradox you know i feel tired i feel this i feel that i come to church i somehow just get energized i come through the door and i turn into the energizer bunny or something like that amen i can't help myself there is just something amen the stimulation of revelation you're right hallelujah in the blood of christ my lord in the blood of christ my lord in the blood of christ my lord we have the victory we have the victory we have the victory in the blood of christ my lord we have the victory in the blood of christ my lord in the blood of christ my lord in the blood of christ my lord we have the victory we have the victory i have the victory in the blood of christ my lord i have the victory oh i have the victory i had a victory in the blood of christ my lord i have the victory hallelujah

more second please thank you uh look we were in chile youth services in the gymnasium by the ocean what was the name of that town conception an open more or less open gymnasium had walls down low open area above [Music] young brother from mexico utterly amazing that young man can preach he can go on for like 10 minutes before he stops for a breath [Music] and i have to admit i thought why why these i'm looking through these young people been there when they were baptized been there when they gave their heart to the lord i saw god work there saw that i thought why is he preaching so hard at these young people just laying it down and then out this doorway of the gymnasium come a man from the street come to the altar bent down gave his heart to the lord and then here come a man and a woman off the street walking in coming then he make it to the altar kneel down on the floor start crying out to god here comes a young man almost looked like a hood had that sweatshirt pulled way down over his face hands in his pockets the deacons were right there at their post of duty they were right on him walking right behind him and he comes up there and he doesn't stop till he gets to the altar and he kneels down at the altar and one of the deacons just pull this deal off his head the young man starts crying out to the lord there's another man sister jerry and i got to visit with him he was walking in the market so some trouble in his life a problem in marriage and all separation and all this and he was literally walking into the corner market that was right there going to get him some beer and he stopped at the door that little market something took him back in time and he come across the street come in there went to the altar and started crying out god works god works in mysterious ways god works in mighty ways let's not go there and say well we're just going to have a good time for camp maybe the owner might be listening instead of a drunken party where there's a bunch of woo hoo
