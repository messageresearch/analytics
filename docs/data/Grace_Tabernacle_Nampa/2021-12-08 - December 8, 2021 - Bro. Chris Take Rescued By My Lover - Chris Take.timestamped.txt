[33:51] so i said well i guess i'm i'm in the
[33:53] right channel
[33:55] praise the lord
[33:56] just lining up so perfectly his title
[33:59] was the greatest love story
[34:03] praise the lord
[34:04] isaiah chapter four
[34:25] and in that day seven women shall take
[34:27] hold of verse one what one man saying we
[34:30] will eat our own bread and wear our own
[34:31] apparel only let us be called by thy
[34:34] name to take away our reproach
[34:37] and that day shall the branch of the
[34:39] lord be beautiful and glorious and the
[34:41] fruit of the earth shall be excellent
[34:43] and comely for them that are escaped of
[34:45] israel and it shall come to pass that he
[34:47] that is left in zion and he that
[34:49] remaineth in jerusalem shall be called
[34:51] holy
[34:52] even everyone that is written among the
[34:54] living in jerusalem
[34:56] when the lord shall have washed away the
[34:58] filth of the daughters of zion and shall
[35:00] have purged the blood of jerusalem
[35:02] from the midst thereof by the spirit of
[35:04] judgment by the spirit of burning
[35:07] and the lord will create upon every
[35:09] dwelling place of mount zion and upon
[35:11] our assemblies a cloud and smoke by day
[35:14] and the shining of a flaming fire by
[35:16] night for upon all the glory shall be a
[35:18] defense
[35:20] and there shall be a tabernacle for a
[35:22] shadow in the daytime from the heat and
[35:24] for a place of refuge and for a covert
[35:28] from storm and from rain
[35:30] amen
[35:32] psalms 57 verse 1.
[35:44] so
[35:59] psalms 57
[36:04] be merciful unto me o god be merciful
[36:06] unto me for my soul trusted in thee yea
[36:10] in the shadow of thy wings will i make
[36:12] my refuge until these calamities be
[36:15] overpassed i will cry unto god most high
[36:18] unto god that performeth all things for
[36:20] me
[36:21] he shall send from heaven and save me
[36:24] from the reproach of him that should
[36:26] that would swallow me up
[36:28] say law
[36:29] god shall send forth his mercy and his
[36:32] truth
[36:33] so he says he shall sin from heaven and
[36:35] save me
[36:36] and he's going to do that saving with
[36:39] his mercy and his truth
[36:41] mark chapter 13
[36:47] save
[36:48] us from the reproach of him that would
[36:50] swallow not that dead
[37:07] verse 20
[37:11] and except that the lord had shortened
[37:12] those days no flesh should be saved but
[37:16] for the elect's sake whom he had chosen
[37:19] he had shortened the days and then if
[37:22] any man shall say to you lo here is
[37:24] christ or lo he is there believe him not
[37:28] for false christs and false prophets
[37:30] shall rise now brother branham's talking
[37:33] about prophets at one point he said
[37:34] prophets is a preacher as well
[37:36] [Music]
[37:37] shall rise and shall show signs and
[37:39] wonders to seduce if it were possible
[37:41] even the elect
[37:43] they have the uh
[37:46] they have the appearance
[37:48] of the truth that's right
[37:50] but it's a facade but take ye heed
[37:53] behold i have foretold
[37:55] you all
[37:56] things
[37:58] so uh we are not abandoned
[38:01] because it's deceiving
[38:03] may lord add a blessing to the reading
[38:04] of his word you may be seated tonight
[38:07] so
[38:07] this uh tonight i just uh
[38:11] you know it's not sure which direction
[38:13] this would this was would go um
[38:16] sometimes i have an idea but then the
[38:19] whatever your hearts are in need of
[38:21] whatever god's real desire is maybe a
[38:23] little bit different than what i
[38:25] forethought
[38:27] that being said
[38:28] tonight my title is rescued by my lover
[38:32] bringing that personal the title's for
[38:34] you your i could have said
[38:36] part of me wanted to stay rescued by our
[38:38] lover to make it a little bit less
[38:40] personal
[38:41] and um
[38:43] but that was the flesh because he's my
[38:46] lover
[38:48] and you each one of us can say that
[38:50] tonight that we've been rescued by my
[38:52] lover
[38:53] and you can go and and we can talk about
[38:56] our life
[38:57] and how god gave us the holy ghost and
[38:59] he gave us revelation of his word and
[39:01] that he rescued us
[39:04] looking at a broader sense of the bride
[39:07] and and it's so much more
[39:11] than being saved from our sins
[39:13] there's so much more that god has in
[39:15] store for us
[39:17] he doesn't just want to
[39:19] you know just save us and then
[39:21] take us because
[39:22] no he has so much he wants to give to us
[39:25] so much he wants us to know about him a
[39:27] relationship that's what he's looking
[39:29] for he doesn't want to just just be the
[39:33] the fireman that pulls you from the fire
[39:34] and then that's it never sees you again
[39:36] never talks to you again he wants to
[39:38] pull you from the fire and get to know
[39:40] you
[39:41] he wants to have a relationship with you
[39:43] and that's too full because the
[39:44] relationship with christ gives you the
[39:47] ability to live for christ
[39:50] and relationship is such a such a strong
[39:52] thing and the world that we live in
[39:55] what's lacking is relationship
[39:58] they think they have it figured out you
[40:00] know hey
[40:01] just put in all your your stats and how
[40:04] tall you are what you like the things
[40:06] you like to do and we'll match you with
[40:08] the perfect
[40:09] woman or the perfect man
[40:11] and we see the success rate of those but
[40:14] uh
[40:14] they haven't figured out relationships
[40:16] and they got a lot of books on
[40:18] relationships and and uh people say oh
[40:20] you know don't put up with that guy or
[40:22] don't put up with that woman you know be
[40:23] your own person and then and um there's
[40:26] a separation with uh being quarantined
[40:29] and in everything there's a separation
[40:32] um not saying that's a bad thing at some
[40:34] times but
[40:35] pulling away we have you know 575
[40:38] friends on facebook but how many of
[40:39] those people do we actually know
[40:41] and have a relationship so what the
[40:43] devil is doing is he's progressing the
[40:45] thought that relationships is just
[40:47] simply an acquaintance
[40:49] so then when people get to actually know
[40:52] that person
[40:53] they say whoa what's their problem
[40:56] because all of their relationships are
[40:58] on the surface
[41:00] and if you're a person who has been hurt
[41:03] deeply bypass relationships you have a
[41:05] hard time going beyond the surface
[41:09] and that's what god wants you to do so
[41:12] sometimes the very the sometimes what
[41:14] you're what you're struggling with in
[41:15] your relationship with god with christ
[41:18] is that there's a barrier you raised up
[41:20] because of relationships in the past
[41:23] that you
[41:24] are struggling to push past because god
[41:26] wants an intimate relationship with you
[41:31] but that's what he came to do
[41:32] rescue you
[41:35] it's a love story
[41:37] it's a love story it's not
[41:39] a
[41:42] god is not a harsh god
[41:45] god is not a god who beats us
[41:48] that's not his position right now
[41:51] before the dispensation of grace it was
[41:52] the law
[41:54] but now god with underneath the
[41:56] dispensation of grace his desire is love
[41:59] and a relationship with us and that love
[42:02] is corrective
[42:03] but there's disciplining your child in
[42:06] love and then there's not
[42:08] and that not part is it not who god is
[42:11] not who christ is and don't let somebody
[42:13] tell you or
[42:14] bring to you
[42:15] that
[42:17] portray christ to you in that way
[42:18] because that's not according to his word
[42:21] brother says in god making his promise
[42:23] 1956 god is a lover god is love god so
[42:27] loved the world when they were unlovable
[42:30] that he gave his son to make them
[42:32] lovable
[42:34] and god here it is god wants to come
[42:36] down and make love to you
[42:38] he's seeking
[42:39] thirsting hungering trying to get to
[42:42] some of your starchy hearts to make love
[42:45] to you
[42:47] as a love affair not a law but a love
[42:49] it's all in love god so loved
[42:54] do you realize christ is not complete
[42:56] without his bride
[42:59] i sent that studying the other night i
[43:02] sent that quote to my wife
[43:04] because i was just blown away
[43:06] he is seeking thirsting and hungering
[43:10] for
[43:11] our for for us to receive
[43:14] and share that love relationship
[43:18] and he rescued us
[43:21] so that we could do that
[43:24] now um
[43:25] amen
[43:26] he's seeking and thirsting brother adam
[43:28] says in the second coming of the lord
[43:31] 1957
[43:33] he's praying and and um
[43:35] we skip down a little bit a little ways
[43:37] here but um i want to be a real lover
[43:40] he's praying and he's he's saying um
[43:43] god spoke to to your maybe you're saying
[43:46] maybe he's hugging the congregation
[43:47] maybe god spoke to your heart and you're
[43:48] saying i want to be a real lover that
[43:51] when i go to my lord
[43:53] kneel on my knees i want him to embrace
[43:55] me in his arms say o my lover you
[43:58] remember solomon how he spake of it he
[44:00] said come my love let us walk through
[44:02] the pomegranates let us walk through the
[44:03] garden of spices
[44:05] how he said her lips looked like
[44:07] rosebuds and so forth how he loved his
[44:09] little wife said come let us go and take
[44:12] our fill of love when you get down to
[44:14] your altar to pray
[44:17] is your heart so true and your soul so
[44:20] unadulterated that you say lord god let
[44:23] us take our love
[44:25] and you say yes my lover i love you
[44:28] or have you been committing fornication
[44:31] have you been flirting with the world
[44:33] and the hour of the lord is at hand when
[44:35] all these signs and wonders with tens of
[44:37] thousands of other things that's taking
[44:39] place pointing every marker is pointing
[44:42] it's getting darker it's getting dark
[44:44] there's a cooling off in the church
[44:49] god he's seeking
[44:52] he's seeking thirsting and hungering
[44:56] and the opposite of that love
[44:58] relationship is cooling off
[45:01] starchy
[45:05] people sometimes
[45:08] i say people but that's because that
[45:10] comes from
[45:11] that that opinion i guess you would say
[45:13] is formed from the people i have
[45:15] interacted with
[45:16] so maybe that's not what you've
[45:18] experienced and when i say people please
[45:20] if you've never experienced that
[45:22] that's just the people that i have come
[45:24] in contact with in the world and just in
[45:26] my life
[45:27] the circle i guess
[45:29] and um i said all that and i don't
[45:30] remember what i was talking about
[45:33] praise the lord
[45:34] should have done that
[45:36] just got to preach it
[45:38] um
[45:40] starchy
[45:42] so they get to a place where where
[45:44] you you've arrived
[45:47] and now
[45:49] the lord can't deal with your heart
[45:52] because you're there and there and you
[45:54] i'm sure you've seen him in church
[45:56] they just man they've got it together
[45:59] they're experienced christians
[46:02] completely unmovable
[46:04] they've lost their relationship
[46:07] with christ
[46:09] that's because it's not about
[46:12] that's where
[46:14] that's where the the the movement of
[46:17] of um
[46:21] the movement
[46:23] i'm just trying to choose my words
[46:25] correctly here
[46:26] the movement of um it's all about
[46:29] brother branham it's all about the
[46:31] prophet
[46:32] that movement removes that relationship
[46:35] with christ
[46:38] that's why they don't have any victory
[46:39] in their lives
[46:44] cooling off in the church the revival
[46:46] seems to be over
[46:48] the last bit is about finish and here we
[46:50] find ourselves in our self in adultery
[46:52] what will he do he'll shove us from his
[46:54] lap and say depart from me you workers
[46:56] of iniquity unless your heart is so true
[46:59] and your soul so unadulterated that you
[47:02] can say lord god let us take our love
[47:05] that is my horse desire and i believe
[47:06] that's your heart's desire tonight
[47:11] what you're worshiping
[47:13] is what you are loving
[47:18] in other words what are you putting your
[47:20] time and attention into
[47:23] you know what i was talking with my wife
[47:25] the other day and now and um
[47:27] uh husband and wife relationships we
[47:29] listening to the radio and you know some
[47:31] gals like oh we've been married for 23
[47:33] years but we just grew distance so we
[47:35] divorced
[47:37] and you don't just grow distant
[47:40] you stop trying to growing close
[47:44] you don't just grow distant with the
[47:45] lord you stop trying to stay close with
[47:47] him
[47:49] if you want a good relationship with
[47:50] your with your spouse you have to put
[47:53] effort
[47:54] forward you have to keep the fire alive
[47:57] you have to work at that it doesn't just
[48:00] happen
[48:01] same with your relationship with christ
[48:03] it doesn't just
[48:04] happen god doesn't always just go
[48:09] sometimes he says look i'm going to show
[48:12] you
[48:13] this path
[48:15] to your healing
[48:16] deliverance
[48:18] successful relationship renewing of your
[48:20] relationship i'm going to show you this
[48:22] path and i want to see you step by faith
[48:25] through
[48:26] that process
[48:28] and then i will reward you at the end of
[48:31] that
[48:34] but james says
[48:36] ah show me
[48:37] forgive me in misquoting but he says you
[48:39] know i'll show you my faith by my works
[48:44] i believe we're mature enough to know
[48:46] what i'm talking about i'm not saying
[48:48] we're catholics
[48:50] no love now this is straight and i know
[48:52] we probably don't deal with this and i
[48:54] don't i don't
[48:56] whatever i'm not gonna give it oh
[48:58] asterix no love affair with the prophet
[49:02] that would be fornication
[49:06] falling in love with christ
[49:09] wait i got my notes in wrong order so
[49:12] no love affair with the prophet that
[49:14] will be fornication if your focus is the
[49:16] prophet
[49:19] you're committing adultery
[49:22] if your focus is
[49:24] the word brought through the prophet
[49:27] well now you're in the love affair with
[49:29] christ
[49:32] so here
[49:33] amen
[49:35] christ is wooing his bride
[49:38] while the deceived remember we read that
[49:40] scripture the deceased the very elect if
[49:42] it were possible they say lo there's
[49:44] there's christ is here what are they
[49:46] saying
[49:46] i don't recommend you go reading it but
[49:48] i've read it a few times just to kind of
[49:50] know what's going on
[49:52] they're saying this is christ
[49:54] go read it
[49:56] verbatim they're saying this is christ
[49:58] completely out of balance and twisting
[50:01] the words
[50:02] to say this is christ
[50:05] exactly how the scripture said
[50:08] now you want to know where christ is
[50:11] find the thing that lines up closest
[50:14] with his word that lines up excuse me
[50:16] perfectly with his word
[50:18] and you will find christ
[50:21] so the christ is wooing his
[50:24] bride while the deceived gaze into the
[50:28] eyes of the messenger looking for a love
[50:31] they'll never find
[50:35] looking into the eyes of the messenger
[50:37] for a love they'll never find they're
[50:39] trying to find something to appease
[50:42] their heart's desire
[50:44] but they'll never find it in another man
[50:48] they'll never find it in a man talk
[50:50] about how awkward that would be if
[50:52] rebecca saw isaac and she
[50:55] just oh and then just standing eliza
[50:58] come on
[51:00] wouldn't it just be weird
[51:02] if you were there in person that would
[51:03] just be awkward right say okay
[51:05] something's wrong here there's been a
[51:07] miscommunication
[51:09] isaac's like rebecca you're my wife
[51:12] but that's what they're doing
[51:14] that's what they're doing
[51:17] but
[51:18] and this is the point but
[51:21] even some people in that
[51:23] okay
[51:25] can be rescued by my lover
[51:28] we every day that we take in or we hear
[51:32] stuff from that and we have to
[51:34] we have to hear it or or see it
[51:38] we have to fight with those thoughts
[51:41] of that maybe not
[51:44] maybe some more than others
[51:46] but in this day that we live in we are
[51:49] being rescued by our lover because all
[51:53] around us
[51:55] things to break that relationship
[51:58] are coming down hard
[52:02] what is the world what's the one of the
[52:03] biggest things love not hate
[52:06] that's what the world you know there's a
[52:08] sign i don't know if you've seen it if
[52:09] you go to idaho city it's on the left
[52:10] big billboard says report hate speech
[52:13] and it's by the fbi
[52:15] it's a big deal hate speech no don't
[52:17] hate on on this that's just their
[52:19] interpretation of love and don't speak
[52:21] against it
[52:24] while you look at the natural what is it
[52:26] it's a perversion of what god's doing in
[52:29] the bride
[52:30] a bonding a relationship
[52:34] an intimacy that brings forth
[52:38] the life of christ
[52:41] okay
[52:43] falling in love with christ
[52:45] is the bride's revival amen
[52:50] praise the lord to turn aside god's word
[52:54] is to deny his love remember he's
[52:56] seeking and thirsting and hungering
[53:01] i hope i by god's help will portray this
[53:03] picture of christ longing for you but
[53:06] you say
[53:07] i'm gonna take this man's word
[53:10] you are turning down his love it's not
[53:13] about whether i'm right or brother
[53:14] david's right or our pastor is right
[53:16] that's not what it's about it's not
[53:18] about the quotes that we have to prove
[53:20] our point
[53:21] it's about that love affair that we have
[53:24] with christ
[53:26] and that is where you will find your
[53:28] greatest victory and we'll get to a
[53:30] quote here it's agape love
[53:32] that is where you find your victory in
[53:34] your life your victory in in everything
[53:38] is is is
[53:39] accepting god's word
[53:42] to accept his love
[53:44] but
[53:45] nobody who lives a life according to the
[53:47] message
[53:49] whose
[53:50] doesn't have a love affair with god with
[53:52] christ will it will
[53:54] none of them are going to say oh i don't
[53:56] love the lord
[53:58] no one no one will admit to denying
[54:01] god's love
[54:02] but you watch their life amen you watch
[54:05] their life it's like you talk to
[54:07] somebody
[54:08] and they're not listening
[54:10] you can see it they're just not there
[54:13] when you finish talking they talk about
[54:14] something else they're not listening
[54:16] there's no connection that's how some
[54:18] people are in church with god or in
[54:20] their life every day with god oh they're
[54:22] there they're they're reading but
[54:24] they're not listening
[54:26] they're not they're praying they're
[54:27] making their demands
[54:29] but there's no relationship so they say
[54:32] oh i'm following god
[54:35] i'm following the message listen to a
[54:37] tape while they brush their teeth and do
[54:39] this and do that and it just goes
[54:42] now there's times that's okay right you
[54:43] just put a tape on
[54:45] but if you're not feeding
[54:47] taking in the word
[54:51] where are you going to find a life that
[54:54] lines up with the word of god there's no
[54:56] victory you see when you line up with
[54:57] the word of god you have victory in your
[54:59] life and i'm not talking about just the
[55:01] the the the foundations
[55:05] talking about victory in revelation
[55:08] understanding
[55:10] you know
[55:11] this is not according to god's word
[55:15] so i will step out what are you going to
[55:17] do if
[55:18] if uh
[55:20] let's say for example you were in the
[55:22] church
[55:23] for years
[55:25] and god began to deal with your heart
[55:28] if you don't have a relationship with
[55:30] god strong enough
[55:32] you could be sitting underneath false
[55:34] doctrine and not even know it
[55:36] but as soon because god's not going to
[55:38] let you stay there if you are seen
[55:39] that's the paradox of the whole
[55:40] situation
[55:42] you receive
[55:43] message from god in prayers and through
[55:46] the word and you realize
[55:48] this is off the word
[55:53] that if you have a strong relationship
[55:55] with christ and a love with christ
[55:57] you're going to be able to stand up
[55:59] and take your family uproot your life
[56:04] because it's not about
[56:06] the list of rules
[56:09] it's not about this and this point and
[56:11] this point and these quotes back up this
[56:13] point and this scripture backs up this
[56:14] point what is the point
[56:17] of all of that if you don't if that
[56:19] doesn't produce a love for god you see
[56:22] why the days had to be shortened
[56:24] do you see what what god's doing he's
[56:27] saying look stop
[56:29] it's not about that preacher
[56:31] and what he has to say or that church
[56:33] and and how oh we just appreciate that
[56:35] you know it's just he's the one for me
[56:37] that's not what it's about it's not
[56:39] about sitting in and now you know we
[56:41] have to play the tape and and all that
[56:44] stuff that removes relationship
[56:47] because the devil could care less if you
[56:49] do that every day of your life
[56:52] because there's no victory
[56:54] but a relationship with christ a love
[56:57] affair with christ is what produces that
[56:59] and we don't have to fear see
[57:02] it's not the end of the story we are
[57:04] rescued by
[57:05] my lover
[57:09] you see
[57:10] how could we do it say to god how could
[57:13] we go through this age without the love
[57:17] of our lover christ
[57:21] do you know because love
[57:23] the love of god is in revelation
[57:27] it's a revelation
[57:29] which you could see why the prophet in
[57:30] the beginning said that that's the holy
[57:32] ghost a sign of the holy ghost
[57:34] because that's how important a
[57:36] relationship with christ is
[57:42] the true word fed to the people will
[57:44] bring forth
[57:46] a bride completely in love
[57:49] with her husband jesus christ
[57:52] you don't have to worry about it
[57:54] i don't have to worry about
[57:57] you folks
[58:00] just keep praying just keep preaching
[58:01] the word
[58:03] and god will bring that to pass in all
[58:06] of our lives
[58:07] that's why i say you know and if you
[58:10] have a desire to serve god but you just
[58:11] can't seem to line up just keep coming
[58:13] to church because that word's coming
[58:15] down
[58:16] and finding its place in your life and
[58:18] will produce the true word every single
[58:21] time for the bible says the seed
[58:24] receiving the true word will bring forth
[58:26] a true word bride every single time
[58:30] in um corinthians book of correction
[58:33] 1957
[58:34] look friend god was so careful
[58:37] don't let it leave you god never got a
[58:39] handful of dust and made an eve
[58:42] she had a different creation
[58:48] on that note what's the big move for
[58:51] women to be independent
[58:54] it's it started back in the days of when
[58:56] brother branham was here but it's just
[58:58] gotten even worse
[59:00] everywhere you look it's all about you
[59:01] know they don't need i don't need no man
[59:05] not to
[59:07] get on that but that's a type
[59:09] spiritually
[59:14] spiritually because guess what whatever
[59:15] god's calling us to do is going to be
[59:18] super contrary to the rest of the world
[59:21] because he doesn't want to make it easy
[59:22] on you
[59:24] but it gives you everything you need
[59:27] it gives you everything you need you
[59:29] know it's like it's like boot camp right
[59:31] a sergeant is not making it easy on you
[59:34] he wants because he knows inside of you
[59:36] you have what it takes
[59:39] he's pulling it out
[59:41] that's why sometimes you got to just
[59:42] roll in the surf
[59:44] roll in the sand you got sand in your
[59:46] ears standing between your armpits and
[59:49] sand in all the worst places and you got
[59:51] to run four miles with a
[59:52] log on your shoulder or something like
[59:54] that you say why lord what's going on
[59:56] well it's just
[59:57] the lord saying look at that
[1:00:01] didn't i tell you the devil did not tell
[1:00:03] you
[1:00:05] but see a true relationship with christ
[1:00:08] doesn't breed
[1:00:10] doesn't breed rebellion in your heart
[1:00:13] that's why people say oh
[1:00:15] yeah one time i was i believed in god
[1:00:17] but then i prayed and
[1:00:20] didn't happen
[1:00:22] so
[1:00:24] that's because it was do this you get
[1:00:26] this do this you get this do this over
[1:00:28] here this scripture here you do this you
[1:00:29] get this it was not a relationship
[1:00:34] but you have to let down the bars in
[1:00:36] your life to christ
[1:00:38] to receive that relationship hey look if
[1:00:41] my wife refused to tell me anything
[1:00:43] about her would we have relationship
[1:00:45] i wouldn't be able to know i wouldn't
[1:00:47] know her who i don't know what's your
[1:00:48] favorite color i don't know
[1:00:50] she never tells me she won't talk to me
[1:00:52] do you think we'd be married
[1:00:54] no
[1:00:58] praise the lord so
[1:01:00] eve so
[1:01:01] god didn't grab never got a handful of
[1:01:03] dust and made an eve she had been a
[1:01:05] different creation and she's not a
[1:01:08] creation she's a byproduct
[1:01:10] and god goes over in the heart of adam
[1:01:13] this rib right under his heart
[1:01:16] and takes a rib and makes a wife
[1:01:20] and the very part of adam's spirit was
[1:01:22] in the woman
[1:01:24] and they too are one soul body spirit
[1:01:27] they are one they are perfect oneness
[1:01:31] now
[1:01:32] okay a real woman and a real husband a
[1:01:34] real wife they are one together
[1:01:38] what is it a type of christ from out of
[1:01:41] his bosom
[1:01:42] now let me ask you something
[1:01:45] how can something from the bosom of
[1:01:46] christ
[1:01:47] do anything contrary to the word
[1:01:51] now i'm not talking about
[1:01:53] mistakes and things we do you know yell
[1:01:55] at the wife or yell at the dog
[1:01:58] slam the door not talking about that
[1:02:00] because we got a flesh that we gotta
[1:02:01] deal with we gotta keep under subjection
[1:02:02] to the word of god talking about it
[1:02:05] someone without a desire to line up
[1:02:09] they say no
[1:02:10] this is how i see it
[1:02:12] this is
[1:02:13] no one's going to move me
[1:02:15] that's what i'm talking about
[1:02:17] um there how can there be a relationship
[1:02:19] when they're refusing to accept the word
[1:02:21] of god or even consider maybe their
[1:02:23] opinion is wrong
[1:02:27] that's why when i see something or
[1:02:28] someone says something maybe i'm wrong
[1:02:31] lord am i wrong show me forgive me let
[1:02:34] me line up with your word always press
[1:02:36] always our prayer line up with the word
[1:02:38] that's relationship saying to god that's
[1:02:40] relationship with christ
[1:02:43] christ from his bosom not a byproduct
[1:02:45] not a methodist or a baptist or a
[1:02:47] pentecostal hatchet no serb but out of
[1:02:50] his own heart he took a sweetheart
[1:02:53] that's as pure and loyal as she can be
[1:02:55] she's as loyal as a lily look back there
[1:02:58] at silence we can come my love let us
[1:03:00] walk in the pomegranates let us take our
[1:03:02] fill of love and when the real believer
[1:03:05] opens his arms with a pure heart
[1:03:08] and he holds up to christ
[1:03:11] that that affection of that lover of
[1:03:13] christ goes into his bosom it's his wife
[1:03:17] just like the husband does to a real
[1:03:20] wife
[1:03:22] a bride pulled from christ's bosom
[1:03:26] like i said how could she deny even a
[1:03:28] small portion of the word
[1:03:32] can't
[1:03:34] she can't
[1:03:35] but you see you can show somebody the
[1:03:38] scripture and they read it and they say
[1:03:39] oh it means this
[1:03:41] means a hat there's no relationship
[1:03:44] so you were predestinated to a
[1:03:47] relationship with christ that's why you
[1:03:50] see it
[1:03:52] so we've been rescued
[1:03:54] we've been rescued that predestination
[1:03:56] was your rescue
[1:04:00] so all this laid forth christ and his
[1:04:02] bride are inseparable
[1:04:04] therefore the winds of false doctrine
[1:04:07] assail he rescues her
[1:04:10] he comes along with the truth i know
[1:04:11] there were some things you know
[1:04:13] i heard when i was a teenager when the
[1:04:15] whole
[1:04:16] believe the sign and all that this is
[1:04:18] just as a testimony i heard a few things
[1:04:22] did i doubt the word no
[1:04:24] i knew it was the truth but i was like
[1:04:25] what are those
[1:04:26] god in his time answered those questions
[1:04:29] he rescued me amen amen
[1:04:34] when the messes of this age first begin
[1:04:36] to sink into the hearts of believers
[1:04:38] there was great support you had all
[1:04:40] these message churches start to pop up
[1:04:42] and there was some fellowship and
[1:04:44] support
[1:04:45] and uh there was a few odd ducks
[1:04:49] but there was this this supporters
[1:04:50] pastors and this preacher and great
[1:04:52] fellowship in these meetings support
[1:04:55] but by man
[1:04:58] then they begin to fall or pass away
[1:05:02] progression of the age suddenly there's
[1:05:05] no man to stand on there's still a few
[1:05:07] that people look to
[1:05:09] to stand on but you see what god's doing
[1:05:12] he's saying no no no it's not about
[1:05:15] brother brown
[1:05:16] no it's not about
[1:05:18] this preacher or this pastor or this
[1:05:20] church
[1:05:23] so he began to strip all that away
[1:05:26] but now this is the bride as a whole he
[1:05:27] does that he does that to us as
[1:05:29] individuals strip everything away if our
[1:05:31] focus is wrong
[1:05:33] because to pull all that away and now
[1:05:35] now the bride begins to set what is it's
[1:05:38] winnowing time separating of the seed
[1:05:40] from the shock
[1:05:42] but god begins to pull that away and
[1:05:43] says look
[1:05:45] no none of that
[1:05:47] me amen
[1:05:50] me
[1:05:51] that's what the message is
[1:05:53] is christ
[1:05:55] it started god sent a prophet but as god
[1:05:57] began to bring revelation to the bride
[1:06:00] she caught exactly what it was about it
[1:06:02] was
[1:06:05] christ came that's right christ came
[1:06:08] down
[1:06:10] now we can have relationship
[1:06:13] take please take this right god sent a
[1:06:14] prophet doesn't bring relationship
[1:06:16] it's the start
[1:06:19] of that relationship because rebecca had
[1:06:20] to find eliza and eliza had to take her
[1:06:22] to isaac
[1:06:23] but once that job is done now it's isaac
[1:06:27] now it's christ now it's falling in love
[1:06:30] with christ
[1:06:34] now as as as things you know we refuse
[1:06:37] to talk to you because you go to that
[1:06:39] church or all this just garbage that
[1:06:41] happens politics
[1:06:44] the real bride of christ needed to find
[1:06:46] protection and she needed it quick amen
[1:06:52] so god began to come down and reveal
[1:06:54] himself
[1:06:56] the people people begin to lay in the
[1:06:58] word go look for themselves what it says
[1:07:03] and god began to reveal himself like he
[1:07:06] already had set in motion
[1:07:08] and into the word
[1:07:11] we went
[1:07:13] because that's what it's about
[1:07:15] under the wings of jehovah
[1:07:18] then psalms 57 those that would swallow
[1:07:20] me up
[1:07:21] those that would want to say oh deny
[1:07:23] this and come to our church
[1:07:26] because of i don't i don't even know why
[1:07:27] i'm preaching this thing deny this and
[1:07:29] come to our church because this is the
[1:07:31] place to be
[1:07:33] but that's not what it's about it's
[1:07:35] about a relationship with christ
[1:07:38] and this bond between the bride and her
[1:07:41] lover brought about the great rescue
[1:07:45] revelation brings the union
[1:07:48] a visible union of the bride of christ
[1:07:51] that's what it is
[1:07:53] it's revelation
[1:07:55] because you see christ there's a
[1:07:57] beautiful example in the book of esther
[1:07:59] we can turn to it esther 4
[1:08:02] 12 if you want to
[1:08:05] join me there
[1:08:12] esther 4 12.
[1:08:16] then more uh
[1:08:17] and they told to mordecai esther's words
[1:08:20] then mordecai commanded to answer esther
[1:08:22] think not with thyself that thou shalt
[1:08:25] escape in the king's house more than all
[1:08:27] the jews for if thou all together hold
[1:08:29] us thy peace
[1:08:33] at this time then shall their
[1:08:35] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[1:08:37] jews from another place
[1:08:39] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[1:08:42] destroyed and who knoweth whether thou
[1:08:44] art come to the kingdom for such a time
[1:08:47] as this
[1:08:52] here is esther
[1:08:55] she
[1:08:57] she she lost her parents and mordecai
[1:08:59] took her in
[1:09:01] then
[1:09:02] suddenly she's pulled from her life to
[1:09:03] the kingdom because the king wants a new
[1:09:06] wife
[1:09:08] she finds favor with with hagai or
[1:09:10] harisaya
[1:09:12] and then she's chosen as queen now
[1:09:15] it would appear
[1:09:17] she's arrived
[1:09:19] she's the queen
[1:09:22] but
[1:09:24] haman had a different idea a different
[1:09:26] plan he didn't know esther was a jew
[1:09:29] because esther kept that a secret
[1:09:33] haman had no idea that when he went to
[1:09:35] talk to the queen the king and connived
[1:09:38] him into signing this declaration to
[1:09:40] annihilate the jews that he was
[1:09:42] inadvertently
[1:09:45] murdering the king's wife
[1:09:48] the queen
[1:09:49] so now mordecai gets wind of what's
[1:09:51] going on and he's in sackcloth and ashes
[1:09:53] and esther says sends someone down put
[1:09:55] some clothes on and tell them to stop
[1:09:58] mordecai refuses
[1:10:00] so then she says she said she sends word
[1:10:02] down to him
[1:10:04] and and mordecai hears esther's words
[1:10:06] and then mordecai says
[1:10:09] do you think you're going to escape
[1:10:12] you think you're going to be no
[1:10:14] god's gonna find somebody else
[1:10:17] to save his people if you don't do it
[1:10:21] who knows maybe this is your destiny
[1:10:24] esther's probably sitting there thinking
[1:10:25] things just calmed down
[1:10:28] things just smoothed out i'm the queen
[1:10:30] now
[1:10:32] you see but god was calling her to a
[1:10:35] position amen
[1:10:37] she was the wife of the king amen
[1:10:41] already this is jesus christ but god was
[1:10:44] calling her to make a stand
[1:10:49] she was destined for that position just
[1:10:51] because you serve god now doesn't mean
[1:10:54] it's all a flowery bed of ease
[1:10:57] you are now in a position
[1:11:01] you are now in a position to stand with
[1:11:04] the king's word
[1:11:06] to stand for something so esther perhaps
[1:11:09] this is what you're created for what you
[1:11:11] were destined to do so she puts the
[1:11:14] prayer
[1:11:15] fasting and praying
[1:11:17] and she says okay
[1:11:19] i'll go to the king now here's the
[1:11:20] paradox in order to go to the king she
[1:11:23] had to have faith that the king would
[1:11:25] accept her but what grows your faith in
[1:11:28] the king is when you go to him and he
[1:11:31] accepts you
[1:11:33] so it's a risk
[1:11:35] if you will in this situation esther had
[1:11:38] a risk to take and she said if i perish
[1:11:40] i perish what was the key there total
[1:11:42] surrender
[1:11:44] total surrender
[1:11:45] she was ready to take this relationship
[1:11:47] to the next level she already was the
[1:11:49] king's wife
[1:11:51] you're already the king's wife but god
[1:11:53] wants you to take it to the next level
[1:11:56] god wants you to say god's standing
[1:11:57] there saying look if you'll just step
[1:11:59] forward in faith
[1:12:01] i'm your lover and i will rescue you
[1:12:05] esther
[1:12:06] stepped into the king's chamber her life
[1:12:09] was in peril
[1:12:11] but the king
[1:12:13] put forth his scepter
[1:12:15] and in that moment saved her life
[1:12:19] she touched it he says sweetheart what
[1:12:22] would you have now first act of faith
[1:12:26] stepping into his presence unbidden
[1:12:29] just
[1:12:30] made him smitten
[1:12:33] wow she loves me that much
[1:12:36] she'd risk her life to see me
[1:12:40] and
[1:12:40] his acceptance just grew her faith
[1:12:45] in him you see with
[1:12:47] every step you take further into a
[1:12:50] loving relationship with christ
[1:12:52] increases your faith
[1:12:55] and then when a haman arises up you say
[1:12:58] no big deal and you go see the king
[1:13:02] she says hey i'm gonna have
[1:13:04] a little supper for you guys a little
[1:13:07] tea party or whatever i don't know a
[1:13:09] wine feast or something like that you
[1:13:12] can if you know it then you know it i
[1:13:14] can't remember it but um so oh sure and
[1:13:17] bring havon along
[1:13:19] sacrifice
[1:13:21] she lays before him a meal
[1:13:24] she sacrifices to the king
[1:13:28] she gives him of her labors
[1:13:31] she labored in love to create that meal
[1:13:34] for him
[1:13:35] you know when we would say he was but
[1:13:37] she was buttering him up
[1:13:40] it's just another step of expressing
[1:13:43] love to god
[1:13:45] expressing love to our king and she he
[1:13:49] says okay so what do you have a request
[1:13:50] for and she says why don't you come
[1:13:51] again tomorrow and then i will make my
[1:13:54] request
[1:13:56] so he comes again the next day
[1:13:59] but the night before
[1:14:00] or that night i guess after the first
[1:14:02] banquet
[1:14:04] the king couldn't sleep
[1:14:06] so he calls in the uh the um
[1:14:10] i don't know who he was but
[1:14:12] yeah the guy the recorder to to read to
[1:14:14] him the chronicles of the kingdom in
[1:14:16] other words you know uh kind of like
[1:14:18] minutes to a meeting
[1:14:19] very boring
[1:14:21] but he couldn't sleep so hey just you
[1:14:23] know bring that over here listen to it
[1:14:25] now what i find interesting is you know
[1:14:26] he couldn't sleep in mordecai
[1:14:28] and and all that stuff but you see
[1:14:33] when the bride's in peril do you think
[1:14:35] the king's sleeping
[1:14:39] jesus was asleep in the boat but he
[1:14:41] wasn't
[1:14:44] he was ready
[1:14:46] when you're in trouble or when the
[1:14:48] bride's in peril the king can't sleep
[1:14:51] that's how much he loves you
[1:14:54] he wants to make sure everything you
[1:14:57] have need of is taken care of
[1:14:59] when you extend your love to him it
[1:15:02] doesn't say why the king could not sleep
[1:15:04] but he knew his queen had a request
[1:15:08] big enough she couldn't just spit it out
[1:15:11] he was probably in turmoil just
[1:15:14] wondering what was
[1:15:15] hindering there what was there when
[1:15:17] there's a secret or is there something
[1:15:19] you know you want your wife just tell me
[1:15:21] what's wrong tell me what's wrong that's
[1:15:23] where the king use esther okay esther
[1:15:26] tomorrow he wants to know what's
[1:15:28] troubling my queen that is the
[1:15:31] love that our lover has for us
[1:15:35] so the next day she he goes and and and
[1:15:38] nester tells her i'm a jew
[1:15:42] now
[1:15:49] esther could have said sorry mordecai
[1:15:52] you know i was a jew by birth but
[1:15:56] whatever
[1:15:57] you all can die
[1:16:00] no i don't think casually king hazard
[1:16:01] would have chose her if that's who she
[1:16:03] was
[1:16:04] that's another sermon
[1:16:06] um
[1:16:07] but when she caught a revelation i am a
[1:16:11] jew
[1:16:13] esther's revelation of who she was
[1:16:15] brought her greatest deliverance
[1:16:18] i'm a jew and i need to go before the
[1:16:21] king and make a request
[1:16:22] the revelation of who you are
[1:16:25] brings about your greatest deliverance
[1:16:29] before her lover could rescue her she
[1:16:31] had to have a revelation that he would
[1:16:34] so she had a revelation of who she is
[1:16:39] in order to have a revelation
[1:16:43] that he would rescue her he she had
[1:16:46] excuse me she needed that revelation to
[1:16:48] step forward in faith if you know who
[1:16:50] you are you can step forward in faith in
[1:16:52] your s is serving
[1:16:55] god
[1:16:57] so
[1:16:57] she says hey
[1:16:59] haman's plot against our life i'm a jew
[1:17:02] oh he's in distress he steps outside now
[1:17:06] let's throw this in there this one's
[1:17:07] free he comes back in haman is is on top
[1:17:11] of esther begging for his life and i
[1:17:13] love this part he
[1:17:15] the king comes in and says oh now you're
[1:17:17] going to try to take my wife
[1:17:20] bind him
[1:17:22] just to show that god will go to fight
[1:17:24] for us
[1:17:26] god will go to all extents he needs to
[1:17:28] rescue you but you have to step forward
[1:17:31] in faith into his court
[1:17:34] and say
[1:17:35] i
[1:17:36] need you
[1:17:38] you have to express that back to him
[1:17:40] he's seeking thirsting and hungering he
[1:17:42] wants to be your great protector if
[1:17:45] you'll just build that relationship with
[1:17:48] him he is your lover and he desires to
[1:17:51] rescue you
[1:17:54] but the man says in marriage and divorce
[1:17:55] 1965 and that's the way it is with god
[1:17:59] affiliate love which is human love
[1:18:01] fellowship love
[1:18:04] oh excuse me he says that's the way it
[1:18:05] is with god
[1:18:07] if a filial love which is human love
[1:18:09] fellowship love can make a man feel that
[1:18:11] about his wife
[1:18:13] what about agape love
[1:18:15] the greek word meaning the love of god
[1:18:17] how would that make me
[1:18:20] do about
[1:18:22] christ jesus christ
[1:18:25] i as long as i want to go do it it's in
[1:18:27] my heart to do it i say as long as it's
[1:18:30] in my heart to do it i go do it legalism
[1:18:33] won't let me do it is because that i
[1:18:35] know not get punished for doing it
[1:18:38] but the real truth of it is is when the
[1:18:40] love of god comes into your heart till
[1:18:43] you
[1:18:44] want
[1:18:45] to do it in other words do the right
[1:18:46] thing that's the truth of it there is
[1:18:50] two schools not legalism or other or
[1:18:52] capitalism it's both so in other words
[1:18:54] it's not i don't
[1:18:56] not do that thing because i might get in
[1:18:58] trouble i don't do that because i love
[1:18:59] god so much
[1:19:01] i wouldn't want to hurt him
[1:19:03] that's how he wants you to look at
[1:19:05] serving him saying to god and that's
[1:19:07] what i'm
[1:19:08] trying to say tonight what i believe the
[1:19:09] lord is trying to say tonight is that he
[1:19:11] desires to rescue you he wants to be
[1:19:14] your lover and he wants to rescue you
[1:19:16] he's not looking to to to for for a
[1:19:19] relationship where it's just do's and
[1:19:21] don'ts because
[1:19:22] because you just that's you know you're
[1:19:24] gonna get punished or oh you know i did
[1:19:26] this now god's gonna strike no
[1:19:29] no because if you serve god that way
[1:19:32] you will walk away amen
[1:19:35] because that's not relationship with
[1:19:37] christ
[1:19:38] god wants
[1:19:40] to be your lover and he wants to rescue
[1:19:42] you
[1:19:44] so next time you're in need guess what
[1:19:46] every day we're in need of rescuing
[1:19:49] we are helpless without him
[1:19:52] we are completely helpless without him
[1:19:56] and the day that we live in there are
[1:19:58] seven women
[1:19:59] who desire to take hold of one man just
[1:20:01] to say give us your name.
[1:20:04] we want to wear our own apparel we want
[1:20:05] to do our own thing but we want your
[1:20:07] name in other words no relationship
[1:20:10] but in that day
[1:20:13] shall the branch of the lord be
[1:20:15] beautiful and glorious amen in other
[1:20:17] words today
[1:20:20] today
[1:20:22] they want the man
[1:20:24] the money the name
[1:20:27] but they don't want the relationship in
[1:20:30] the world and in the message ranks
[1:20:33] they want the name the tape the book
[1:20:37] but they don't want relationship with
[1:20:39] god
[1:20:40] and relationship is what brings your
[1:20:42] greatest victory but
[1:20:44] you
[1:20:45] have to be vulnerable with god
[1:20:49] so if there's something holding you back
[1:20:50] from being vulnerable pray that god
[1:20:52] shows you what's holding you back maybe
[1:20:54] there's something you just need to
[1:20:55] forgive someone in your life and say
[1:20:57] lord
[1:20:58] i want all the walls to be broken down
[1:21:01] so that i can have a relationship with
[1:21:03] you my lover
[1:21:05] praise the lord
[1:21:07] magicians want to come tonight
[1:21:13] praise the lord
[1:21:22] god wants a relationship with us
[1:21:27] you know
[1:21:29] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:21:31] um
[1:21:33] invisible union of the bride
[1:21:35] there's some another one
[1:21:39] towards the end of brother bannon's
[1:21:41] ministry
[1:21:42] that's what you have
[1:21:45] is
[1:21:46] christ
[1:21:48] in the relationship with the bride
[1:21:50] because that that's what it's all about
[1:21:52] saying to god
[1:21:54] that's what it's all about
[1:21:58] that relationship with god guess what
[1:22:01] you just that's how you speak the word
[1:22:04] i i know i my wife and i our
[1:22:06] relationship i trust her enough
[1:22:09] i don't tell her you can do this you can
[1:22:11] she just does it right
[1:22:13] because she knows my heart
[1:22:16] and when you know the heart of the
[1:22:18] savior
[1:22:19] you can step out and do things in
[1:22:21] confidence
[1:22:23] because
[1:22:24] you know the lord
[1:22:26] you have a relationship so when god says
[1:22:27] now this is maybe a little bit silly to
[1:22:29] some people but yesterday we were at the
[1:22:31] coffee shop and i just
[1:22:33] let's buy her coffee
[1:22:35] turned out she fell back in line and
[1:22:37] somebody else walked up and
[1:22:39] i looked at the guys and i was like it's
[1:22:40] okay whatever
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:42] maybe she needed it and i didn't know it
[1:22:45] but you see
[1:22:46] don't just brush things away the still
[1:22:48] small voice not to lift myself up
[1:22:50] there's still small voice be connected
[1:22:52] with your lover so when god says do
[1:22:54] something you hear
[1:22:56] and you act upon things
[1:22:58] you don't have to step aside and say you
[1:23:00] know should i do this should i do this
[1:23:01] read out your bible and pray no
[1:23:04] you know
[1:23:05] because you know god
[1:23:07] when someone comes to you with a
[1:23:08] question or someone comes to to to say
[1:23:11] odd uh or
[1:23:13] whatever a situation
[1:23:15] you just the word comes out of your
[1:23:16] mouth because you have a relationship
[1:23:18] with christ
[1:23:20] praise the lord
[1:23:23] amen this this song came on my heart and
[1:23:25] i have never seen it before but they've
[1:23:27] practiced it so hopefully they can make
[1:23:28] up for the part and i had to put the
[1:23:30] songs the words in the song thing
