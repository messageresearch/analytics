TRANSCRIPT
========================================
figured I'd share it with you here um it's about it was just an article I read and talked about the American buffalo I was talking about the American buffaloes kind of telling the different traits of the American buffalo and you know buffaloes stand like a male Buffalo stands like seven feet tall and you know they've got thick fur to make help them make it through the winters in North America and the planes there and um there but can get up to like three thousand pounds big big old huge things you know and they can they can run a pretty good clip but the most interesting thing I found about the buffalo was when the Buffalo looks up and it sees a mountain and the storm starts to roll over the mountain the Buffalo doesn't doesn't run away from the storm the Buffalo doesn't sit there the Buffalo turns and it runs directly into the storm and what I thought was interesting about this couple things but the Buffaloes takes off running as fast as it can into that storm to get through that storm wants to make it to the other side right the Buffalo doesn't sit there and look at its friends and say what should we do here or look at what the work what the people are doing around here what his family's doing the Buffaloes turns and runs it doesn't make a choice it does it has an instinct within it says this is what you do when a storm comes I thought that was pretty amazing I thought about us as Christians sometimes in the article it went on to talk about cattle and people and said people shelter in storms and cattle run from storms I thought but as Christians why not run into the storm why not embrace the storm right because in adversity we grow Our Roots go deeper we get closer to God right then I thought about it a little bit further I thought about imagine a herd a massive herd of buffalo that Rumble running across a plane just running into storm with everything they have praise God it got me a little excited amen right let's let's Embrace these things sometimes that that God brings our way because you know I bring storms our way right to clear the way on the other side amen just thought I'd share that with you I want to sing a master of the Wind [Music] [Music] ever there's a wind in myself but my heavenly father he watches over me when the breeze turns into again I know the master of the way I know the make of the rain he can calm the stone make the sun to shine again I know the master of the wind let's just stand sometimes I so like an eagle in the sky foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you I know the maker of the rain he can calm the storm and make the sun to shine again I know the Master of the Wind amen hallelujah [Music] I want to start I don't know if everyone anyone heard this but Paul just wrote it down for me I hadn't

Saturday night seven o'clock here at the church um just to get together it's not nothing no you don't have to stay till midnight or you come go when you please and then regular service will be Sunday at 2 p.m 2 P.M so just uh remember that for this weekend hey man I always forget you know the other thing I was going to say about the Buffalo there um you know we know we make it through the storm we have a whole book of promises that tell us Joshua 1 9 Isaiah 42 3 I could name promise after promise we have a whole book the whole Bible and a message that tell us so amen hallelujah and when I say run through the storm I mean get down on your knees and run through the storm if you know what I mean amen hallelujah hallelujah I'm amazed we'll sing the course there [Music] I'm Amazed that you love me I'm Amazed Through Your Precious Blood I found pardon and my sins are washed they're all washed away as my sins [Music] I'm amazed that you love me I'm a man amazed how you care Through Your Precious Blood I found and my sins are washed they're all washed away know my sins are washed away amen let me ask your brother Paul to come this evening I'd like to sing that little chorus Lord let your holy fit Spirit fall on me number 342. let's just stand and sing this amen [Music] Lord let your Holy Spirit fall on me like a cloak of calmness [Music] Restless soul is Longing To Be Free Lord let your Holy Spirit fall on me Hello Lord let your Holy Spirit fall on me like a cloak of calmness on a troubles see my Restless soul is Longing To Be Free oh let your Holy Spirit fall on me more time Lord won't let your Holy Spirit fall on me like a cloak of calmness [Music] Restless soul is Longing To Be Free let's just lift our hands and just Worship the Lord say this Holy Spirit for me beautiful life [Music] oh my rest was stronging to be free oh let your Holy Spirit fall you know this might seem like a paradox Saints but to get through this storm that Spirit of calmness goes to be on us you see you look around in the world today and you will see that the whole whole atmosphere of the world today is being put in a position of fear just had someone we got home from this trip and I had an individual say now now it's not safe it's not safe in self but why did you go there but you realize that as some Daughters of God we don't walk foolishly but we walk in the calm in the center of this storm that's overtaking this world and you know it's there that when the Holy Spirit comes down and moves you we do not look at the circumstance we do not look at distance we do not look at the height of the mountain we do not look at this storm because we're under this anointing to just trust and I got a thousand things to share we'll probably hear about Israel for months now but just to realize to make something so real to you we took a lovely boat ride out across the Sea of Galilee and it's really not that big 13 miles but I don't remember exactly how I forgotten the other measurement it's not really that big but it's big enough it's big enough and as the song says he's looking down on us scripture tells us how Jesus went to the mountain not just to watch the disciples he had business to take care of but he's just sitting up there the prophet of God said he's just looking and watching them you see they needed to go through that storm they needed to experience that but he had his eye on them and he knew right exactly there would be no finer if I could put it this way today not even the most finest of quality of a GPS could have pinpointed the spot that he knew he was going to meet them any better than it was and I'm telling you he knows exactly where to meet us to come right at that moment we just need to learn to trust him there is the greatest thing to learn to trust him thank you sister Ruth thank you brother Isaac I want to just this comes a little bit out of our our uh travels there and uh I just want to uh speak to you this evening on a Living Word living tradition and so we look at this and I would title it tonight let the book live and so let's just turn in our Bibles um to uh first Peter the first chapter 18th verse and we'll just take our thought there tonight from that it is good to be home um we had a lovely time there I appreciate your prayers we had a uh you know between brother George and um the guide uh we felt like we were almost on a marathon and uh so you know somebody said how was your vacation and I said we went on a vacation uh because from there we got on a plane we flew back to Johannesburg got in there late by the time everything's done got a motel room went to the airport bright and early in the morning got on a plane flew to Cape Town got there was treated like royalty but they sure worked their royalty hard and so we had a lovely time uh 172 young people that we had the privilege of of ministering to and uh just to see God working no altar calls but to see God move man it's the Holy Spirit not man and moving upon these young people to see a lovely response lovely testimonies and we thank the Lord for that got on a plane went back to Johannesburg had a few days I would say of leisure if you call being forced to get out of bed at 4am leisure brother Gideon's a Taskmaster but we had a lovely time and God blessed us and there we had about somewhere in the region of 125 30 young people in in those meetings and uh the Lord moved miraculously we won't go into it tonight but we saw the Lord come down and deal with young people to come and confess things that would not be of the natural for one to come and say this is what's happening in my life but the Holy Spirit dealing and we say thank you Lord tonight for that and then we got to go for the final night uh brother uh ask us to come and finish up uh their youth services and uh so we got to be a part of brother Reuben Daniels Church's final closing out of their youth camp services and so just a real blessing then hold to the airport bright and early and thrown on an airplane and a little wave goodbye and here we are so first Peter the first chapter verse 18. for as much as you know that ye were not redeemed with corruptable things isn't that wonderful there's no counterfeit there's no inferior there's nothing that would fade away not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold wait did you see where he placed the things that we worked so hard for as corruptable and it was not what we were redeemed with my thank you Lord from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreign before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you now my brother and sister he did not just say that in those words for us as a demonstration but it was the literal manifestation of the word in our hour Amen in our day which is what is what's bringing this in these last times and manifested it for us so that we can take it as a tangible object today amen people would say well religion's not tangible I'm here to tell you it is tangible it is a life-changing power that will be and you can see the evidence manifested in human flesh amen who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit and to unfeigned love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently Amen to me when I read this it is the same communication as it is to be hot or cold or lukewarm so this love is not something that we just say well I'll do my best to love the Brethren but it is something that we fervently we fervently pursue and you know what fervently pursuing that sometimes means we need to apologize and we need to repent sometimes it causes us to move beyond our justification of our situation and to a place that we are set free amen we sing the song my chains are gone amen what if that chain is just merely an attitude that we have towards someone and it's hindering the moving of the spirit amen amen being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever can we say Amen the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you amen Heavenly Father we thank you for this time to be home to be amongst the Saints Lord we just ask you father just come move in our lives Lord father if there be something in our life Lord that needs to be dealt with needs to be purged needs to be washed away then father I know I lift my hand tonight and say Lord Purge me father if there be something there Purge me Lord I want to be clean father wash us wider than snow is our heart's desire tonight we ask this in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now tonight I want to speak to you for just a few minutes of a living word or living tradition and as we look at this my brother and sister it might seem as though that when we talk of tradition that uh it would be something that would be kind of not good you might say something that that uh we should stay away from but as we'll look at this and the Lord really drove this home to me as we are there in Israel and in our time in Israel we saw uh uh the uh conservative or ultra-conservative Jewish man that is there and we saw the other end of the spectrum the very Ultra liberal Jew and so it's in there we see just as it is in America we see both ends of this spectrum and you know as brother George often preaches to us we need balance so somewhere between this ultra-conservative and this liberal has got to be the real Jew and I will tell you just from observation that I seen Jewish families now they were wearing the men were wearing their little cap and I forget the name of that I'm so bad with those things but it's there you see them but we see wives that look like they could be a message sister very conservative in their dress a very Godly looking long beautiful hair and it causes you to stop and think could this possibly now we're not trying to imply but we could this possibly be one of the 144 000 that God is already preparing them in such a fashion that all they need now is to receive the word and they already fit in the picture of the word and I don't know that but it's just something that stirs your heart and so one of the things and I hope you don't mind me being kind of direct with this tonight but you see that we see these these ultra-conservative Jewish men they they have their cap they have The Sideburns kind of curl that hang down and we see their coat and their dress and everything about them we see them standing at the corner of the table as they're there in the restaurant or whatever and they're reading their prayer they're not ashamed to stand there and read their prayers and to do this and it's there you look at that and say now there's a man who doesn't care he's standing boldly in the public and he's reading these prayers and reciting these things but the thing that is shocking is on the other side of the table is a woman dressed so horribly it's his wife what a paradox to see this a man who is standing here and he's doing this my brother and sister is I'm going to try and keep tonight kind of brief he's doing this because this is the tradition he has been taught and he's raising his children up his young sons in the same exact fashion but you see my brother and sister that is not a living tradition that is not a tradition that is full of life they are following as the word would be they're following by wrote they are just doing as they're taught and you see this and you look at this and you Marvel because when I'd say not dressed very good I mean just let your imagination not roam very far please but your imagination would be no not not a drop different then you could just go here in these places in America and see someone dressed high heels tight skirt lipstick huge earrings and something strikes you and you realize you know what we oftentimes look at tradition as well we don't want Traditions I preacher right here from this Pulpit the Traditions the traditions and traditions are coming in the message but my brother and sister there's some tradition that is good there's some tradition for us to hold on to and as the word of God has showed us how we should be we should hold to the tradition of reading our Bible we should hold to the tradition of praying we should hold to the tradition of being faithful in the house of God and if you want to study that further go dig into the definitions take the background these are things that have been laid down to us that we should hold to and follow daily so as we look at this and realize that there is a tradition that is uh living and there's tradition that is dead but we see my brother and sister that we have to find that balance by the word of God we have to find that balance we revealed out of the word not because we're just going to preach it nuts can be just called uh uh you know following or legalism or however it would be but this needs to be a word amen this needs to be a word that is touching Us in every aspect of our life every day of our life not because my family I was born in this message not because we this and because we that but something that has struck down in the soul and we say this word is alive today we don't need to teach it as a tradition because it's living hey man we don't have to go back and say now pardon me for saying it this way but we don't have to go back and say the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said this book is alive this book is speaking to us this book is preaching to us and the Very life that is in Christ is becoming as it were a tradition but it is a living tradition it is a living word that is having an impact Upon Our Life now my brother and sister our guide it's the first time brother George has worked with him because the guy that brother I believe his name was Reuben that brother George worked with for years uh elderly and he's passed away so now he's working with a new guide yair and and a nice man with an interesting life an interesting story but he's very bold to let you know that he is a secular Jew he is not religious but he knew the scripture very very well he he had a grasp of the scripture and could say well here in Isaiah or here in Jeremiah or here or here but you know what being a Jew he's not real fond of the New Testament so much so that there was a time we come to a certain place and it's interesting how these things are communicated there was a time that he's on the bus and he's there and there's a little deal there and he says now let me point out this is where the New Testament is wrong and there was this in the bus and he's like you didn't like that nope we didn't because the New Testament is not wrong and so he kind of threw another little deal out later about that and when he got a very cold shoulder I even felt a cold front just like the one that went through here the other day just kind of rolling along with some snowflakes and icicles in it I felt it Go by our seat in the Isle of the bus and he's up there and you can tell he's like uncomfortable but you see he's approaching it but I asked him you know you you know a lot of scripture and he says well whether you're secular family or not as a Jew you you are taught these things as a child it's just that in a secular family you you just can discard you just walk away from it after a point of time I I kind of wondered you know brother somebody else mentioned to brother George and it said how long before you have him converted brother George well I'm telling you my brother and sister God works in mysterious ways a nice man most the people I believe on the tour really enjoyed it but you know it's there that you know his explanation really centered around the fact that as a Jew he's just expected to learn some of these things and I think we could share that expectation tonight Saints message Believers this is not about dates this is not about us saying well this happened on this date and this happened on that day to be able to create some kind of a profile but my brother and sister I believe as our brother Steve Burson once said he said you know I'm not going to even read quotes to you uh he said because if you are a message believer you'll know what I'm talking about and I believe that we should have that kind of expectation as it were that we should dig in to the word of God and dig into the message that it is not something foreign to us but it is common it's on the in the tip of our tongue it's at our fingertips it is our very life and you see the very power of what it means to be a Jew we went to a military museum a very sweet young lady was there brother George picked it up in an instant and he says you talk with a a accent as it were with Spanish attached to it and the little girl was a little bit shocked brother George says where are you from and she said I'm from Argentina so he could pick up that and here's this young lady I talked to her quite a bit after the fact that it's there she's was eight years old when her family being Jewish made a decision and picked up and moved back to Israel but you can tell she's not religious she's a Jew I pray Saints I pray that we our families and those we know are not falling in the same kind of trap that we're here just because of a reason but let it be a real experience let it be a real life a real something that is down inside of us shaking us moving us and doing that but a lovely girl with a lovely spirit and I got to talk to her and she lived on the outskirts of Buenos Aires and I got to speak to her about life and that I had been there I've know that road and I know these places and seen this and just chatted with her for just a brief moment and and I said what do you think the future is and she says I don't know if they let me I might just stay in the military for a while it gives me structure it gives me something to do and just a really nice nice young lady but you see what attracted them my brother and sister that family was not that they're necessarily looking for the Messiah the same way as the older religious there but their their believe there's a promise there there's something even in their condition they believe there's a promise there and they believe that someday a messiah is going to come back back and your heart kind of bleeds it's not the time or the place to do this she's a guide in a military museum but it's there that you would like to somehow be able to explain to them that it's not just a fact a messiah is coming back but there has to be a life that goes with this what the word says and so it's there I kept finding myself in these comparisons correlating this together my brother and sister it's not just that Christ is coming but is he coming for us there's the difference it really breaks it down and unfortunately sometimes people get caught up in and Jesus is returning going to be a Rapture well there ought to be a fervent burning desire in us that at the Forefront of this Rapture you will find me at the Forefront of the coming of the Lord I will be there at the Forefront of the word being proclaimed in our day you will find me standing there proclaiming that Christ is my healer he's my savior he's my provider he is my king and he's also my bridegroom see there's the fervency that comes with this not just a messiah coming back you see it was the Messiah coming that caused them to miss it in the first place they had just put it as though it was going to be a public demonstration but I like how the prophet of God said you know that I'm going to paraphrase this that there's coming a time it will no longer be a public show what will be done will be done in secret and my brother and sister it's very interesting there's a young man that is a pastor in Hoffa has a nice little group but he's got a revelation that he is not there to try and convert the Jew because he knows it's God's time and it's there he is there he's preaching to Russians and ukrainians and and uh Filipinos and whatever that are laboring and working have jobs there and he almost shies away from trying to interact in a religious level with the Jews because he knows in God's time that this will be revealed and that takes me back before I move on when you're walking down the street and see a family that's obviously Jewish but they're not adorned even like those that are of the the oh I had a word for that and I've lost it there uh of that there there brother George uses the word and I thought those interests I'll get sidetracked for a moment we're in a place and and a man says to brother George he's looking at the sisters I watched him looking my wife on the sisters and he's looking you know kind of quizzically and finally he says so so what are you guys and brother George just steps up boldly and says we are of the Orthodox of Christians foreign and the individual just went okay because you see they have they have an image of what Christianity is and can we actually blame them for not liking that image people dressed in any old-fashioned using any old language acting in any old way and saying we're Christians no wonder they're not happy and don't want the association but brother George he's figured it out he prayed about it God showed him whatever however come but this is how he says I plan on expressing it from now on we are the Orthodox of Christianity we are the original we are the standard to be measured by can we say Amen to that tonight that's who I want to be not some kind of convoluted hybrid thing that gives them you know an imitation of Christianity but something that would they would be able to look it up and say you're different I overheard brother George in a little conversation trying to kind of put this out to somebody and somebody said something about Trinity and brother George says we're not trinitarians we're believers and so you look at this and oftentimes we get caught up as being message Believers that we forget what really the image is the image is not just necessarily dresses and hair in this but we are projecting we can I say that even more bold we are projecting Jesus Christ and it's not just about what I believe or I have a Doctrine or we no what are we projecting now I say God help us to be projectors of Jesus Christ amen so it's there it's we we share those expectations because we certainly desire for our children to learn we we don't want our children sitting in church and and coming out years later just void of any knowledge of the Bible void of the basic foundations of what it is to be a Christian in this day but we desire Amen to teach our children and some of that is tradition think about it we can get a real negative thought about tradition but there is a portion of tradition that is the word of God we could be described as traditional Christians because we have taken the words of our Lord Jesus Christ we have taken the teaching of the Apostles and we have followed it and we preach it and we believe it and we repeat it and we project it and so you could say oh you have a tradition and I would say yes and but there is another side even a deeper side I'll just want to bump against tonight I want to be the kind of Christian that has a tradition that I'm soft and I am tender and I can be moved by the spirit of God not be so hardened that I say well I'm a Christian and you're a heaven but to be able to say Lord this is a soul here and we would be there to take the gospel let that be a tradition that we have that we bring the gospel with us what the prophet of God say the gospel was the life behind the word let us have a tradition of taking the life with us not just simply putting the word in front of people and say here it is you either Believe it or your loss but let there be a life that we carry because we believe the life is important it's not all about Doctrine we need doctrine but it's really not about Doctrine we come as it were to some circumstances on this trip words being said and things happening and people say well that ought not be and another brother says oh one of those traditional clean them before you caught them we don't want to be that way Saints we want people to see Jesus Christ we want them to be here let them be welcome in Grace Tabernacle as they are that they could come and sit and hear the word of God and we're not there telling them everything that's wrong with them but we're projecting Jesus Christ to them and land that life that love of the Gospel come down and God if they are predestinated that will catch them and they will then be Washed by the Water of the word not by our words and so let the word of God come and let us project the love that is in the word and let the word catch them because when the word is catching them they are caught when the word catches a man or a woman they're caught so we look at this as I said we often speak of tradition as a negative but I'm telling you that my life my time in Israel uh something touched me and I realized you know what we actually need some tradition we need some tradition we need if you follow me we need the tradition of preaching pure unadulterated word of God let that become a tradition for us not something that wavers to the right or the left and as I look at this let me just share tradition a way of thinking behaving or doing something that has been used by the people in a particular group family Society for a long time under this context that I hope that you're catching tonight this right here is a tradition let it be used by a group real Christians Believers not for a little season but for a long time let it become the very standard of who we are and what we believe and stand on Amen stories and beliefs that have been a part of a culture of a group of people for a long time used to say that someone has qualities which are like the qualities of another well-known person or group from the past and inherited established and customary pattern of thought action or behavior tradition suddenly not looking so bad is it and I say myself I've preached often tradition is creeping into the message well with what God laid on my heart there in Israel I'd say God let tradition creep into the message let let the tradition of your word come in let the tradition of Acts 2 38 repent let that come in let these things take life in us and let it change us not man's Traditions now where I need to hurry along because I told you I wasn't going to keep you long amen second Thessalonians the third chapter verses one through six amen finally Brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord may have free course so what is he telling them he's pray for me because what we really want is not what I thought I should preach to you or what things I thought I should hold you to but we want to let the word of the Lord have free course and the word all right keep it in context the word be glorified even as it is with you see when Christ is in you and I my brother and sister then we can actually come to a place this is not boasting this is not us elevating ourselves but we actually can come to a place that we are lifted up with the word of God in us it is not a place we say well I did this or I did that but God coming and we are coming to a place it's God lifting us up when he answers prayer it's God lifting us up when he reveals the word to us it's God lifting us up my brother and sister when things come alive you get excited about the word it's there in your life is God doing the lifting not man man and can make his own boasts amen the prophet talks about how it is strange God uses a man to do something and he starts getting lifted up in his own mind but let us be lifted up in the mind of Christ Amen to be able to stand and somebody says oh now you know that was a really good service we don't need I this is something I I've been catching we don't need to stop and say well well you know I don't know my brother and sister I'm telling you if God LED you as a minister to preach a service that touches a people and someone comes and says that was powerful and it touched my life then say praise the Lord because it's not a man how can a man be thinking the thoughts or doing that I'm telling you my brother and sister it's time for us God moves in our life we find ourselves excited in the word and the word is changing our life don't apologize for that stand up and say thank you Lord then I'm a daughter of God thank you Lord I'm a Son of God thank you for the word that has come down and is changing my life because where are you going to go in the world today and actually find there's a lot of boasters a lot of boasters my brother and sister but not too many with the mind of Christ think how blessed we are think how blessed we are that God would give us his mind his nature that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not Faith but the Lord is faithful now who's going to establish us on the message saint Paul is the pastor of Grace am I establishing you in the message not a chance we'll preach the things God lays on our heart but I can't reach inside someone and establish the word it's Christ and Christ Alone but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil and we have confidence in the Lord touching you I tell you I believe in that probably every preacher ought to make sure that he has that as something that's anchored in his soul that we actually have confidence I don't care what position you see the person sitting in on the Pew what kind of shambles their life is what the outward man demonstrates or whatever we should be having confidence God's going to establish this in them and bring this to to the Lord touching them and changing them that ye both do and will do the things which we command you boy people have a real problem with that in church the other you know I was reading an article the other day and uh they were listing reasons why they would never go back to another church it wouldn't go back to a church we're going to move on and as I'm reading their deal caught my attention I'm reading it and I thought yeah I agree with you the problem is is you're not looking for a holy ghost-filled church you're looking for a church that will offer you the traditions of man they're going to offer something that validates my brother and sister are the only validation I want and I believe you want is the validation of having the very nature the mind and the spirit of God there's the validation we're looking for we're not looking for a church that validates us with the right kind of coffee and creamer and donuts and the right atmosphere the right lighting the right mood come on you realize there's now churches that have rooms they're mood rooms I just I just feel like I need to sleep this morning and I'll just receive something while I'm sleeping they've got a room for you come on this is not of God this is man this is man and they're they're creating a tradition follow this they're creating Traditions to attract the flesh I say grace we create a tradition that attracts real sons and daughters of God that are on fire to serve God let it not be based upon how I feel but what does the word say let it be a tradition that takes us back to scripture takes us back to word and makes the word living and while the word is judging us that leaves you and I we don't need to do the work of a judge let the word be the judge we create an atmosphere where the Holy Spirit comes I've shared this story about the brother preaching and the lady our sister because that's what she is today third row high heels mini skirt big hunk and hoop earrings and God's speaking to the brother telling him preach on that well I tell you that's really difficult because mostly As ministers we have preached in such fashion and offended people but the Holy Spirit just kept dealing with him preach on it and when she walked out of church that night he thought well that'll be the last of her but the next night she's on the second row and the Holy Spirit tells him preach on that and he thinks oh lord I can't preach on that then she's on the front row then she's in the altar then she's in the baptismal and then she's in the house of God but we have to be careful when we look at that and say well that is a Formula that works did God tell us to say that there's the difference otherwise we can be the one and that you see this has happened in many churches through the years they walk back to a Pew and drag somebody to the altar thinking this is going to work but you see we should have a moving of the holy spirit that brings the people to this so we have confidence in the Lord touching you that you both do and will do the things which we command you and the Lord directs your hearts into the love of God into a patient waiting for Christ now we command you see these are strong words but my brother and sister every time we read the Bible it is commanding us it is telling us what we need to do and I say this and I trust that you catch this tonight there is the tradition of the word the tradition of our Lord Jesus Christ is wooing a bride amen he's not forcing a bride he is wooing a bride let that be the tradition of wooing us amen because I tell you I've made mistakes in my life and I thought up stepped over the line there I whatever it might be and God come and God's wooing amen I experienced it from 15 years old until my mid-30s God constantly coming back as much as I pushed against it God coming back and wooing me back amen that's what we desire and we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us so here he is speaking now to them and saying I'm giving you tradition I'm giving you teaching I'm giving you Direction that you can go back to Time After Time but you notice while he says he received it of us who is actually doing the speaking see there's where the difference comes other scripture we won't touch it tonight speaks of the traditions of men totally separating from the leadership of the Holy Spirit but a tradition of man amen so here's this teaching that Paul is giving to them First Peter 1 18-25 amen going back to our original scripture for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers you see my brother and sister if we're not careful as I use that example of those Jewish boys being raised by a father to not be ashamed and to follow you know wearing everything that pertains to being a very Orthodox Jew and their father says you're a boy and we can take you back here in Moses and do that but do you realize much of what they're actually teaching those young people was not in Moses's teaching they added it here and they added it here and they added it here and then as Generations go by it is just as good as coming from the mouth of God there's the traditions we need to be careful of when we turn the teaching of men reminds me I don't say this negative but I just want to make this point reminds me one time a man said brother Branham said this this and this and it struck me so so in such a fashion I went home and that was back when it was Eagle Computing number two or something you know the second version and there was some things that were you couldn't find you you those of you used it back then you could type in phrases and it just wouldn't come up but you knew it was there but I remember this man brother Branham said I went home and I typed it in zero maybe I didn't type it in right type it in this way zero type it in this way zero put it on a Shelf time goes the search is refined come the conclusion no matter how you typed it in the prophet never said it what are they doing they're teaching the tradition of men that's how they saw it which kind of fits with the old phrase I heard what you said but that's not what I heard and so we look at this we have to be careful because it's that Traditions that steer people nothing wrong with this I actually I I don't have any problem with that other than the fact I'm wearing some whatever this color is shirt sister Jerry picked it out foreign churches that will hardly let you in the door if you have anything but a white shirt on reminds me of our Mormon heritage yes you want to be a para at a Mormon funeral walk in with a bright blue shirt on and a sea of white and black not only are they who are you but they look at you and it's obvious you're not one of them now my brother and sister when we come to the place of being one of them right we sing that song I'm one of them what are we talking about what are we talking about it's not one with this crowd it's not one with this great movement it's one with Christ it's one with the word that's what it should be in our tradition not the tradition of this I know of message church now I'm not speaking down but I just want to make a point I haven't had a habit of hanging out in Mormon churches or Catholic churches Message Church won't let you in the door with a short sleeve shirt on that's their idea of men showing too much flesh but what is it do you have a quote for me do you have scripture for me no it's our tradition they're teaching it have I made my point so as we look at this the conversation as it says vain conversation is being passed down by people that are not LED of the spirit right this is in First Peter 1 and 18. amen it's it's not by people led of the spirit because if they're LED of the spirit they have one absolute right we have enough quotes to know where the prophet of God stood on absolute we have one absolute amen so there's what we point back to it is not how we feel but what does the word say amen so it will produce a revelation of the word we'll produce the word a revelation of a man's tradition will preach will produce a people who have conformed to man now I want to ask you are we here to conform to men we're here to conform to the word of God to the holy ghost moving in our midst amen so what happens it seems as though you travel the world you will run into people placing their tradition or man-made idea above the word of God people placing their man-made things above the message and so then you realize in that realm that they are actually creating a tradition that is not designed as it were now when I use this word design I I say that man is used of God to put things in place right and God I just throw this out a little bit God's dealing with me of things I believe we need to do in this church and so it takes some form of leadership to say we need to start having prayer meeting it takes some form of leadership that says we need to have Bible study but my brother and sister it should not be that prayer meeting and bible study or the sole structure of man but it is man led by God to say we ought to implement this in our church and we ought to follow this but it won't be man controlling it will be the Holy Spirit controlling it it will be Christ putting a hunger that people and I just put this out here I'm not trying to imply anything but you'll come because it's God in you that's hungering not because you feel obligated are you with me so it's there in this place that we put our ideas higher than the word then all we do is produce our ideas you know in second Corinthians the third chapter verses 5 through 18 I'm not going to to read all of that I'll probably will end up reading all of it but anyway not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of or as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God you talk about a foundation for a tradition that the only sufficiency we have is of God amen what are you going to build on God what are you going to do with your life God where are you going to go God let him have complete because that's our sufficiency who hath also made us Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life now if we have a choice tonight Saints and we're going to come and we can give the letter which killeth or the spirit what would be our desire to give to those around us it should be the spirit amen we should be saying I want to give life to you and the spirit is in the life it is not as it was as it days that I come out of my childhood legalism didn't work my brother and sister it never worked and you know what's funny is just visiting with different brothers and we are there in our time in Israel getting to know some of the brothers there our time in South Africa and it's there and bumping and talking and whatever and it's strange you know legalism is legalism no matter what continent you're on it's legalism and no matter what church you're in and so it's there in that realm if we are got the option to give let's give the spirit to people encourage them by the word and let the spirit move them because otherwise what happens is is we can pick this up and say it says right here and we don't even realize we're killing them but it says right here we give them the spirit introduced them to Christ and the word of God gives life to them and as we look at this my brother and sister I'm not preaching this in any form or fashion I am preaching to Paul tonight that Paul needs to get into the spirit just like God dealt with me about tradition tradition tradition coming into the message God opens my eyes in Israel there and I'm looking and it strikes me there are certain traditions we need to embrace there are things we need to take a hold of and we need to let the word be the preeminent thing in our life and that let it become as it were I hope you're with me the tradition that we as a group of Believers stand on the word says the word says and we'll stand with the word I don't need to water it down amen I use these as simple examples son forgive me if they're just awkward but we don't need a coffee bar we don't need donuts we don't need some kind of meet and greet in the parking lot where they can't hardly come to a stop and and we've got their door open and we want their name and address and email because a pastor is going to want to greet you later this week and maybe invite you for tea no sir what we need to do is have the presence of Jesus Christ so palatable inside this building so palatable that people walk in and say I've never in my life experienced that could we accomplish that Saints or should we just give up now no sir I'm sorry I've come too far to give up now amen right it says the ministration of death written engraved Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not said fastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the menstruation of the spirit be rather glorious that's what we want to introduce people the administration of the spirit the most glorious thing could you agree with me tonight that meeting Jesus Christ face to face as it were is the most glorious thing that has ever happened to us amen there's not one thing amen you know it's oh my let me just move on here I find myself just gonna get carried away now I want to just go Brothers take me to the quote from Satan's Eden and we'll just wrap this up here I believe I've I believe I'm getting my point across am i saints amen Lord help me to not just be long and redundant but now I want you to get a clear understanding of this so if I could give you a little homework that you would just go either on a device or if you have the book readily available just to read before and after this to give absolute Clarity to you Now by unbelief and no now I think that no brother Brian might have said no but it would make more sense in the sentence if it said if not you follow me if no taking all of the word of God has brought a seed of unbelief so by not taking all the word of God it's brought a seed of unbelief Unholy sinful hatred and eternal death is in this sinful intellectual Church age he's talking about right now now you got it in this day that when the whole world is religious it's funny I seen the deal recently man using the lord's name in vain this man has got a Street Ministry just walks up and says are you a Christian the guy's like yes I am as a matter of fact and he says do you read your Bible and the guy says some the guy is pretty blunt had a personality to be blunt he says maybe you need to find the part about taking the lord's name in vain and read it then he asked the guy this kind of personality him do you want me to read it to you and the man said yes and he reads it to him and you can see the man is visibly shaken now Saints where do you go to church that you're not even taught scripture concerning how you use the name of the Lord I hope you're following me I hope I didn't lose you in there you're gonna in the whole world's religious you know that the whole world's religious and in this religious age big churches on every corner everything the whole thing winds up in Satan being worshiped here it is right here in the Bible that's right and in this intellectual theological seminaries that's brought out an intellectual person that's been trained how to speak what to do how to make their emotions in everything like psychology three or four years to know how to deal with a man's mind I tell you what we got some training how to deal with man's mind amen find an altar pray through continually praying through continually seeking the mind of God continually reading his word continually submitting yourself and then you will find God dealing with the mind not man dealing with the mind the house of God should not be a place man deals with your mind it is a place that we come submit ourselves that the Holy Spirit comes and deals with our mind that's right but you see it's easier to just approach it intellectually will you please change the play page brother Gideon I like this it's the whole reason I'll bring this quote to you right here the rest of that was just warming us up the spirit of God is not something that you it's schooled into you is something that's predestinated into you by the hand of almighty God amen not the preacher not the pastor not the Evangelist not that whatever my brother and sister this this understanding of the word this desire Amen to come and I've used this term tonight to bring it in this way but for this to come and become our tradition what is our tradition um oh Hallelujah a prophet of God said repent every single day let that be our tradition pray every day let that be our tradition seek the mind of God and worship him let that be our tradition oh if we used to ever have a tradition let that be our tradition let me start again the spirit of God is not something that you it's schooled into you it's something that's predestinated into you by the hand of almighty God your experiences cannot be schooled or taught into you brother Isaac this is why I just was thought that was so profound nothing in this world is going to train us to turn to the storm and say Lord I'm trusting you I'm going to continue to walk I'm going to continue to point to Calvary I don't care how big this storm is I'm not running from it I am pressing into it and I am a believer that I am an overcomer that you have given something into me and the prophet says it right here it's not been schooled or taught into you it's predestinated by God's hand and God's foreknowledge into you and I just say thank you Lord Jesus because if it could be taught into US it could be untaught but if it's revealed of the Holy Ghost of the Holy Spirit into you and I we stand and say this is the word you know I I just did this to make a point I've done it here at the church before but I used it as to make a point when we are in Africa and you know you're speaking on something a little bit strong and I just stopped and I asked them there was there was not there was hardly a response in the whole church I think they just weren't used to that approach and I is this a message Church people yeah good this is the message to the church amen sometimes it's not about let me just use your sister as an example okay is that okay not picking on any of you but certain things creep in and people would be like well they're really just they're just preaching at me or us or them but let's stop let's not be judgmental let's not say well okay you sisters I told the church there Cape Town let's just go back over here to the word right they they admitted their own admission or message charge let's just go to the message and just see what it says and let's just do what the message tells us to do if we were Catholics we would be looking in the literature and doing what it said if we were Baptist you see what we need to do is get people moved back to where the word in them that's predestinated is in the Forefront a place where the word becomes the direction of their life the Holy Spirit because otherwise we become a church of do's and don'ts we have a tradition we're LDS we don't do this but you know for every one of them we're LDS we don't do this we'll be a Baptist that says we would never dance in the middle of our church so now they get to Point their finger at the LDS and the LDS are here pointing their finger at them how about we sister Ruth if you'll come how about we don't bother doing any pointing but to Christ let's point to the word what does the word say we are message Believers we were called to the word let's point to the word let's live the word amen I hope I haven't been to abrupt to blunt or misstated anything tonight this is just what God laid on my heart while I was sitting in Israel amen so you look at that I love that last portion paragraph 101 spirit of God is not something that you it's schooled into you it's something that's predestinated into you amen so we can call the Swan and eagle as much as we want to we can as we sit there in Israel at some kind of a bird refuge the guide says you know just want you to see something of nature there's this bird refuge there that um oh they had a number that they estimated it was in the millions and millions and millions and millions of birds every year funnel through and land at this refuge on their way to the south of Africa they're just passing through Israel they're tourists it was kind of an incredible thing all kinds of birds there and you know is really interesting of all these beautiful exotic rare birds passing through here I look out there and Coots they just call them a black mud duck all right nothing doc about that thing that thing eats mud nothing wallers in mud that thing likes mud the dirtier the water is the happier they are isn't it amazing you can find a coot almost anywhere in the world now my brother and sister the fact that the coot is present shouldn't let us come to the place we don't see the eagle [Music] don't let all the mud Ducks of the world keep us from seeing Christ in our midst and moving let it be real to us Saints amen God bless you tonight Hallelujah amen [Music] do we have the song brother Alex let the book live you know [Music] let's just stand and let's just sing that let it be our prayer to the Lord tonight let the book live in me dear Lord show me myself within Thy Word see there's the greatest thing we can do my brother and sister to stir one another in Fellowship is to come and let the book be living in us let it be shown that we are in the word and then when we see ourselves there we can really really truly project Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah oh it's even enough and I still don't know how to start oh let the bulls live in me dear Lord oh show me myself with him [Music] oh show me myself and show me myself [Music] oh let the book live in me dear Lord oh show me myself within Thy word oh show me myself and show me my savior and let the book live in amen can we say Amen to that Hallelujah

the last minute he says I have something for you come over to this other computer and it comes over there and he prints us a ticket boarding pass and uh then he says your bags you didn't take your bags through the security check no we only come here for information about whether we can get a flight or not oh he runs over there tells the girl I'm sorry I know this is something but you have to check their bags now we're busy check their bags now now she checks puts the security thing on her bags he says your plane's leaving run [Music] okay we run through the little Corridor around the corner and there's 400 people in Security in front of us and Jerry's like let's not go behind them look at all them kids they got no that's the wrong Line Paul we need to move in a different line look
