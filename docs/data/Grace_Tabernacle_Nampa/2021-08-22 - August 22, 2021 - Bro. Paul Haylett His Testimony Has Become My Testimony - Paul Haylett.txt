devil's just trying to get my ipad to eat my sermon amen hallelujah good to be in the house of the lord today amen god bless you each and every one just pray this last week has been good to you amen i didn't say trial free or struggle free just good amen because it is the word that is making the difference in our life and the word has to be applied and when we come to circumstances in our life that causes us to dig deeper and apply the word than we grow and it's beneficial to us amen so i just have a couple things um that um would like to just bring up today uh question was brought to sue's sister jerry uh and you know sometimes we just don't think about things right things are happening in the world and we don't really focus but uh it was brought the question are there believers in afghanistan so i just reached out to um some brothers that i know that you know have you might say a kind of more worldwide footprint and it has been shared that they know of at least a hundred around a hundred believers ministers elders there's baptisms taking place conversions it was said that they would love to leave the country if they could but you know my brother and sister um it's interesting because just with that thought in mind i was reading and and uh you know people are asking brother branham now are we all supposed to move you know as it were to arizona to tucson and brother branham clarifies that and he says no this bride comes out of every nation not we all pick up and move to one spot but comes out of every nation so you know i would just encourage you let's not sit here and say lord let them escape their circumstance but lord meet them in their circumstance right daniel met the lion in the den amen shadrach meshach and abednego met the pillar of fire in the midst of the fire amen so we just want to just lift up our brothers and sisters there actually all of those countries you know it's actually by law punishable by death to be a christian in pakistan so you know just many circumstances of that world but god's going to bring that bride through amen going to deliver her out of the mouth of lions from the edge of the sword amen and raise the dead amen so we just want to just lift them up as we should be lifting every part of the bride of christ up before the lord amen so um just interesting thank you for those that you know brought that to light cause us to kind of look and think okay what is happening there i bring greetings to you from brother george he was kind enough to call me yesterday we had a lovely conversation just wanted us to know that he is doing very well in his recovery from covid uh gaining his strength back he said he's still you know just a little bit weak you know he lives in a house that they built many years ago and he says basically he says i find more and more reasons to not climb the stairs so but it is home to him and um you know holds many memories of of sister rebecca for him so just remember brother george he said he will come and visit us um just as soon as possible uh so we're we're proposing ideas to him when soon is and uh so we just asked the lord's blessings on him just wanted to make sure all of you would know that we're going to have a little 90th birthday party for mom at the heron place which is just what street is at comstock which is just one street back towards the boulevard and turn right so you need directions that's country boy directions we don't need streets or numbers you just drive up here one street turn right so invite all of you we put a time at basically two o'clock because sometimes the preachers here in the church go a little bit long and uh so we just wanted to give a little time there let's just uh go to the word of god today uh thank you good to see sister emmy and the children back home and um just asking that the lord would would just bless each one of you today uh and uh just looking forward to the word amen i want to speak to you once again over the overall title of redemption's manifestation uh his testimony has become my testimony amen and i believe that you know it'll be very self-explanatory here as we move forward today so we want to just go into john the fifth chapter starting with verse 24. um you know we have to remember now brother branham says and it just so clearly makes sense brother brown says you know that um we can't come preaching a gospel or message of another day right but the lovely thing saints is that we are here in the seventh church age as it is in scripture revelations two and three we see this but we're in this seventh church age we're in the culmination of the ages so we get to bring the message of every age into our age because it's applicable so it isn't that we will sit here today and say well we can't preach the message of moses or noah or enoch we can take all of the gospel that's been revealed or brought out in this day and and we can glean as it were or take part of that and so we just want to uh just look at the word not as in past tense amen don't always look at the word like oh that was spoke by john that was spoke by paul but take it and apply the word to our day which reminds me of two things we missed i see little vanessa is doing fine today she sprained her arm or something my such a tomboy so it's good to see her today and also um i want to i want to take brother sergey's mother take her from the obscure and to introduce her as it were into the body so she is no longer brother sergey's mother she she is sister nadia okay so if you have a reference you have a prayer request it is no longer brother sergey's mother the obscure it is sister nadia our sister in christ okay so um while she's not here yet to introduce in the in the physical realm um we have been introduced to our sister and uh so i for one uh want to move from just that vague reference to something personal amen i don't see our sister nadia today it's not feeling well yes um so um no more than we would want to refer to our sister nada as brother ivan's wife hey man she's our sister right okay amen john the fifth chapter starting with verse 24 verily verily i say unto you he heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me so a direct correlation between hearing what jesus is speaking is a direct correlation to believing on him that sent him hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death and to life verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that here shall live now is he talking about the dead in the grave for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man marvel not at this for the hours coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now many years ago i remember there was a little something stirred around where we were at and fellowshipping and and people wanted to know will those that are lost have a resurrection yes they will they will stand in a judgment they will have to stand at the white throne of judgment before god and be judged so they will be just as living as they was on the day they stood on the earth but i don't like the resurrection of damnation it doesn't there's nothing appealing to that there has to be saints an anointing on people to not care about the eternal there has to be a very very strong anointing to not care anything about the future i i we don't know that there's a god we don't know that there's eternity it doesn't matter because we're going to live in the now there's a very strong anointing because it isn't the very nature of man to worship and why would we worship if there's nothing there to worship satan is a very slippery character isn't he i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not my own will can we say lord we seek not our own will but the will of the father which hath sent me if i bear witness now this is a key scripture right here if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true he sent unto john and he bear witness unto the truth but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that you might be saved he was a burning and a shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father have given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me and the father himself which has sent me hath born witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape you have not his word abiding in you for whom he has sent him ye believe not search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and you will not come to me that you might have life i receive not honor from men but i know ye that you have not the love of god in you i am come in my father's name you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive how can you believe which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from god only heavenly father we just ask you lord jesus the blessings upon your word in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated i want to just go ahead and finish this last little scripture do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even moses and whom ye trust for had ye believed moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me but if you believe not his writings how shall you believe my words amen so as we look at this this morning my brother and sister i just want to come and just as the title uh has said his testimony has become my testimony and as we will look at the things of god we are not here my brother and sister by our knowledge by theology to try to define god would it not be amazing that the great hallow oh hallelujah just my heart just grips this the great almighty jehovah that made heavens and earth and we as finite humans are going to define him we are going to then put as it were a boundary a box whatever it would be describing who god is and how he operates and how he thinks and what he will do it shows us how you might say the very arrogance of mankind that we believe we could actually put god in a box and so as we would look at this today uh i want to just uh bring a little highlight before we move on amen verse 31 says if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true and i just want to make some sideline references i actually put these scriptures in and took them back out but the scripture says that every man is right in his own eyes so it's really hard for us to bear witness to come and and only under the humility or influence of the holy spirit can a man really stand up and say you know what i'm a weak and frail creature i am prone to do the wrong things i can do nothing without christ my brother and sister let that not just be vocabulary cliches but let those things be real that we recognize that no man have you ever noticed now you know it is it is interesting uh and i i have some examples in my mind but i probably won't go there this morning i don't want to even think about politics but you know if the sugar bowl gets set on the corner of the table and we walk by and knock the sugar bowl on the floor and it busts my brother and sister it's like the human nature not to acknowledge that it was our elbow or hand that knocked the bowl off but we turn and say well somebody left the sugar bowl because it is of our nature to go ahead and nudge that over oftentimes we will not uh uh give the full story you know i just read a deal here recently that said um you know uh when when uh men have disagreements i'll paraphrase this it's a little lengthy but when men have disagreements and find separation amongst themselves you will find that each man will tell the story in the light that makes him look good and so it's by that very nature of humanity when we start to bear witness of ourself we're never going to i shouldn't say never but it is not the human nature my brother and sister to put ourselves in the negative light and and jesus comes here and says you know if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true he's not really speaking of himself jesus christ the word made flesh but he's laying down a principle to you and i that we could understand that if jesus was to stand up and literally just as it were i wouldn't say arrogantly or boastfully but say i you know i am the messiah i am this i am that my brother and sister that would not be the fulfilling of the word it would be speaking of a man it would be speaking of the characterization of an individual and so he makes this acknowledgement if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true but there's another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true and i want to just put it this way this morning that we as sons and daughters of god have many frailties in our life many shortcomings in our life many things that we do that the moment we have done them or said them or whatever we're saying lord forgive me that's not who i am i didn't mean that thought or that action or do whatever lord just forgive me for that and so as we recognize my brother and sister that if we could just look at ourselves the way the devil looked at us you don't hear that preach very often just go ahead and look at yourself this morning in the way the devil looks at you he's been trying to tell you how to look at yourself for years and if you look at yourself in that you will find not one good thing in you you will not find one redeeming factor in you but my brother and sister there's one that bears witness of you and he's the one that says you've been redeemed before the foundation of the world my blood has covered every sin every failure every weakness you are my chosen ones amen so there's a witness that bears witness of us as sons and daughters of god and i say i'm not going to listen to what the devil said i'm going to listen to what the lord jesus said of us what the word says because i know that that witness that is witnessed of me witnessed of you is true can someone say amen this morning god's witness my brother and sister is the witness we care about amen so it's there you see if we receive not testimony of men testimony of men is good but the testimony that jesus christ was speaking of here in the word is a very testimony that was placed in the ark this was not jesus just making some vague reference my brother and sister but we can go right back into the book of exodus and we can come here in the 25th chapter and we can make a direct correlation and i shall put in the ark the testimony which i shall give thee amen so that testimony god does not draw random my brother sister god has a very very precise plan it is laid out very concisely and it's always on time and it always contains every element necessary to fulfill itself and so it's there that he says i'm going to put this testimony in the ark which i shall give thee and so now here is our lord jesus amen he is saying i receive not the testimony from man but these things i say that ye might be saved he's talking about this witness that has been given to him and this testimony now that he is coming forth to fulfill my brother and sister this is the very testimony that was in the ark this is the very word of god for fulfilled in the hour that it was necessary to be fulfilled and so he stands there right before those people a time a season that the word must be fulfilled you might say an anchor point in history and so this must come to pass and now he's speaking not a new testimony amen not another testimony but the testimony that was in the ark is now come it come right out of the holiest of holies that have been placed in the ark and now being brought and testified in the human form before the people you know it's a lot easier my brother and sister just to say every promise in this book is mine but how about us having enough courage and enough time and enough sincerity to dig through the book and find out what the promises really are it's one thing to just talk in a vague point of view and say oh praise the lord he's a healer well name what you need healed specifically not just a vague thing lord i know you're a healer i just picked up you know i have a blood sugar issue and i just have to be studying and i picked up a book and i just it kind of opened randomly and right there boldly before my eyes god heals diabetes thank you lord i claim that in the name of jesus christ amen we're not looking here for something vague so as we look here in the book of exodus so the very scripture verse 16 that is placing the testimony in the ark precedes the very testimony that declares the mercy seat you see my brother and sister there's a correlation between these what is in the ark and what is in on the mercy seat amen because you see the very blood had to be shed upon the mercy seat and upon the ark it was not a separate event not a separate blood not a separate promise not a separate dispensation but it was the same that sealed our mercy oh come on saints sealed our mercy and sealed our testimony the very blood that sealed you hallelujah put your sin in the sea of god forgetfulness is the very blood that brought you and said here will be the testimony that you shall live out hallelujah hallelujah so you see what is what is happening now is i've already kind of hit upon this but i want to come back jesus is now manifesting oftentimes does this seem loud to you is it just loud up here it's good okay i can deal with it you see some people struggle they they say well you sure are caught up on this manifesting yes i am because you see i want this word to come off this page and become alive in me i don't want it to be a forum of discussion i don't want it to be something as a reference i want it to be me i want it to be you i want the word to be a living word not not just something that we attain to a creed because i'm going to say a very bold statement if we're going to just settle for creed my brother and sister there's a religions that require a lot less of you if that's all we're going to do is find creed let's find creed you know google it find the easiest creed you can find it's not about creed it's about life it's about christ so jesus says now look my brother and sister jesus is now manifesting the testimony that had been placed in the ark we're not talking about men trying to be faithful to the word of god and men pressing forward and each year bringing the blood of bulls and goats to atone for their sin we're talking about now a day by day living word in a living people that the blood has now been sprinkled over us the goat doesn't matter no longer the bull doesn't matter no longer the lamb as it were in the physical form does not matter any longer because we have been given the lamb and the lamb's blood has not been sprinkled over an altar it's been sprinkled over us and it's that life-changing event of coming under that anointing amen of the living word manifested hallelujah you see what it was doing was bringing the life that was in the ark into the presence of the people now you see the priesthood experienced this in the old testament to a certain degree they were there once a year coming everything had to be perfect the thread the pomegranate the oil the right clothing everything done but you see there was as it were my brother and sister that slight margin of error let's call it that do any of you experience a margin of error in your life i will raise mine amen there's three four five amen i'm gonna lift my other hand for those of you that didn't have the energy to lift yours we have a margin of error satan would like to exploit the margin of error he would like to take the margin of error and show you because the air is there that you must not be it but you see my brother and sister in the human element we've never been able to do away with the margin of error i was just reading a poll that was being quoted by another group and they said well at the end of the whole thing about this poll they said well now this pollster is known to be a conservative christian and so we question their margin of error facts presented by a christian have a greater margin of error now i think they probably have a smaller margin of error because you see they haven't viewed it as being right in their own eyes they've viewed it from how does this compare to the bible to the word of god so as this comes now we will see how that this is causing us as sons and daughters of god this margin of error that is there my brother and sister is now covered by something other than ourself are you with me now what is sin unbelief brother branham also puts it in this sense sadness coming short or falling short of the mark well i'll tell you what we probably could use this more as a as a um altar called type of approach my brother and sister but can we be honest with ourselves we have that margin of error that we fall short of the mark more often than we actually would like to admit we have a little attitude we have a little something or we just simply fall down as it were and we can say well i i fell short of the mark but you see the prophet of god says what you do is you just stand up again and say lord forgive me and you move on you change from the direction who preached that here in the church i i brother christian okay brother chris sorry i forgot who preached it but i've always the principle of it is stuck with me you're going a certain direction and you realize that you're wrong you don't melt down you don't fall down you don't give up you turn around and go a different direction amen so there is my brother and sister what the word is doing to you and i it is manifesting the testimony that was in the ark and the testimony in the ark could be summed up brother branham speaks about this in the seals book it's all about redemption it's not about creating a church a religion a following it's about redemption and so we understand then a portion as it would be to be expressed of the testimony in the ark is the story and the manifestation of redemption oh can i say thank you lord let that testimony be in me now i want to put it this way i hope you follow me our testimony is not really our testimony because if we would leave it my brother and sister hey just in case you said wait just a second now how can that be well i'm talking to the redeemed am i not so if you say i'm a sinner that's not your testimony because your name being on the lamb's book of life says you're redeemed and if we say we're redeemed but we have nothing to manifest that then we might not be you know telling the truth either but if we say thank you lord i'm a bible believing christian i'm filled with the holy ghost that really is not your testimony either because it's christ in you that is fulfilling that bringing you to be able to stand and live the life manifest the life that you live this might be a little direct so be it lord forgive me if it would offend anybody but oftentimes that's why the devil makes things so appealing and he draws our attention he draws our minds to other things because if we ever realize what our testimony really is my brother and sister then satan will have lost you forever but if he can keep us on the fence you know that's the thing if he can keep us on the fence now you know i had a friend one time he had a horse really good horse you could do anything on this horse you could cut cattle on this horse you could rope cattle on this horse it was a good mountain horse it was a good child's horse and it did everything but it had one bad habit it was always walking up and down the fence looking over the fence it literally had a trail this wide and that deep war at the fence and he said well i don't know what it is it's causing his attention to do that he says so i took and put him in the next pasture in the next paddock and now huh get this what devil's what the devil does so here is the horse walking up and down the fence looking on the other side always looking on the other side always looking the other side back and forth looking on this side and he thought i don't know what's over there and you know he put the horse in the next pasture paddock expecting the horse to go to the next fence and look over the fence because there must be something over he's looking to but what did the horse do he turned around right on this side of the fence and just walked up and down the fence looking back where he came from well is that not what the devil does we're looking to change our life the little song that was sung this this morning we're looking to change our life god changes our life what do we do we just get on the other side of the fence and we're looking back now it's where we came from help us lord hallelujah because some people wear a trench so deep or rut so deep they can't get out of it and god's doing the supernatural around them and all they can do is walk back and forth looking over the fence the scripture says be content where you're at be content with what you have unless of course you not saved and then you shouldn't be content there so our testimony is not really our testimony if we're led by the holy spirit then we become a witness now i hope you find how close these correspond with what was shared here in the book of john you see our testimony is not really our testimony if we're led of the spirit then our testimony is really just a testimony or witness of christ and jesus was saying this testimony i have here is not a testimony of me but it's a testimony of the one who sent me you see the man see we got to understand that balance of the godhead the man that was standing there was flesh and blood tempted and tried in every like manner as us he knew we get this idea that jesus christ was just here and he was the supernatural i'm telling you brothers we live in a wicked day i'm telling you sisters we live in a wicked day young people we live in a wicked day and jesus christ knew every emotion feeling impulse and input that was ever in your life he knew that come on let's get let's get him off the balconies of heaven get his feet right down in the dirt walking right through this world that we walked in you see it's then by the leadership of the holy spirit this is why my brother and sister we cannot be successful let's just talk about success how do we measure success you can measure it in a lot of ways you can be the man who's worth 10 15 20 50 million dollars working on his fourth marriage and doesn't even know his kids from the first one some people will look at him and say he's successful is he really or the other end of the spectrum you might find a man and a woman we know this testimony coming out of the back east a man and a woman in their whole life raising a family and literally their children have to support them in their old age because they have nothing but they have 10 children spouses and i forget how many grandchildren serving god these people over here going to look at him and say man he really messed up he wasn't much of a success really it all depends on how we want to measure success come on saints some would say well if your church is not growing and bursting at the seams you're not successful some would say my brother and sister just give us a little handful filled with the holy ghost and we're satisfied how do we measure success now i want to bring it closer to home how are you measuring success where's your parameter of what you'll call a successful life i think of the song that says take this whole world amen not half of it not a portion of it take this whole world but give me jesus oh man that'll be a successful man right there amen so you see my brother and sister it's by the leadership of the holy ghost that we then manifest the same testimony that was in the ark you see the testimony that was in the ark was not hidden from us in our generation because the scripture says that the mystery of jesus christ would be revealed in these last days the very mystery that was placed in the ark in that day will be revealed once again was it revealed in the form of religion no it was revealed in the form of life your life my life now as we look at this you go back and study the scripture i don't want to revisit it for the sake of time but as we read these scriptures you'll see that jesus is actually speaking to a religious people do you catch that out of the scripture he's speaking to a religious people he's not speaking to the the whoremongers and the bombs and whatever else out here he's speaking to the religious people and what is happening he's speaking of a pushback there's a pushback coming he's telling them look if you knew you would know what i'm speaking as truth if you really knew we'll touch on that in a minute elaborate if you really knew you would understand you would recognize but he's then telling them you never knew how that must have hurt in the religious realm what if brother paul was preaching today and told you you think you know the message of the hour that you've never known it would you all say oh he's just grumpy today jesus was serious he wasn't he wasn't being polite to them he was telling them the truth right so he's dealing with these religious people and they're giving him pushback but you see what's happening is the pushback that they're giving they're believing that they're doing god a service these people believe that this man standing in their midst must have been beelzebub he is not he claims it that uh he's the son of god and and uh we should stone him for that this man is just everything that is against what we believe because he he's a a heretic he's a deceiver and they were doing that all in the name of believing that they were supporting the word of god now you think these spirits ever change also i've heard this i have let me i got it wrong somewhere here let's see the rapture is this true it's a question or should we sell our homes or did you ever say this no i never said this people are wanting to know did you tell us to sell and move to some spot i don't know if it's in this quote or another one he says i never proselyted anyone to move anywhere it's not my business imagine that i just had a wise crack but i'll keep it to myself no i never said it i never i've always advised people to stay where you are and keep on keeping on until jesus comes isn't that good advice amen to find a liberty to pray through yourself and know this is where god wants me to be or i need to move here or whatever if i've told you many time let this tape immemorial let this day be a memorial let my word be a memorial oh here we go i have never at one time ever told anybody ever proselyted ever tried to get somebody to come to this church imagine that the people could come with the liberty saints that have moved here you know what it's like to have someone say oh you've got to come here you've got to be part of our church our church is the best we've got all the answers we've got this and this and then you go and then just everything pardon me i don't normally like to use this language but all hell breaks loose and then you know what happens the preacher a pastor told me to move here i've seen it over and over again saints i've i've had many a person bring this up to me and and we never found uh you know anything never settled down in our life till we prayed through on this and we ended up moving again and people then are like oh they're double-minded but you see what they were doing is following somebody's mind not the mind of christ so brother brown says here no i never prosper i'd ever tried to get somebody to come to this church i've never as far as telling them to leave their own church and sell out their goods and things god knows that i've always advised people to remain a christian and stay where you are until god calls you oh boy hallelujah i can remember i'll just leave this very big but i can remember years ago being given advice that i should tell the little group here which it was only about i don't know 15 or 16 of us at the time and being told you know what you need to get up paul have the courage and tell them to quit their jobs sell their houses and move to our church well praise the lord i'm glad i didn't listen can you see these words to remain a christian who is the leadership of a christian the holy ghost jesus christ himself well i want to go over there i want to live over you go wherever you want to go that's all right i don't care where you go that's not my business for that that actually wasn't the quote i was really bringing but it was lovely because i can just share that you go where you want to go you go oh i do want to put one caveat you go where you have prayed through and god told you go don't just go for whatever reason reminds me of a brother i'll just throw this out reminds me of a brother moved halfway across the united states because there was a message church and this great job man i just two and a half times my income oh praise the lord we got church too he goes there the company goes bankrupt he's now unemployed he says worst mistake i ever made in my life i don't know what prompted me to say this to him i says well brother if that's the worst mistake you ever made in your life what was the second worst uh we won't go into that amen but you see you know you know they usually say that trouble travels in threes so i just naturally my curiosity was like i wonder what the other two and when i asked him what the next one was he looked at me and basically um well anyway let's we'll just let's leave that but now to think that see what does it it starts a cult and then i get in trouble they got a group out here now that's going to be on charity pretty soon in case if you guys are trying to figure this out there were people that had picked a specific spot and said this is where the rapture is going to take place this is where it's going to happen right here you all need to come to our little spot oh come on just say it paul brother brown's talking about sierra vista arizona said his biggest mistake they ever made wow lord forgive me but it's on tape i'm not saying anything new uh it's going to be on charity pretty soon and then what's it going to be we come out here for the rapture of the bride that's just what the newspapers are waiting for they're waiting to get it when they fall on charity and can't go back to their homes that's then what are they going to do well we followed brother branham out here supposed to be and i'm just as innocent of it as i can be the dear sweet people they know that i love them and even in their air they why i love them anyhow see i love them they're my children but they just won't listen to me is that what they're saying no they're saying he told us to come here he told us to do this he told us to do that but they won't listen to me when i'm trying to tell them i'm trying to work out something in the name of the lord and they won't let me do it see they're actually now we're talking about pushback they're actually going against me instead of for me see this is what jesus was experienced these were religious people they knew there was a messiah coming they knew there was a season and they were looking for the messiah and he's right in the midst trying to perform the word and they are pushing back because what they hear what they see what they understand what they interpret didn't fit but it made sense to them oh lord help us see in jesus day they were trying so hard to do something for god failed to recognize god was standing right in their midst while they're trying to do something for god in our day my brother and sister are trying to do something for god but in reality actually pushing against it that's why satan doesn't have to get us out saints dancing drinking misbehaving on the streets just has to get us in a position where our interpretation of the word for our day has us actually pushing against what god is doing see how slippery satan is he brings us to a place that we're actually doing his work for him he just gets to sit back under the umbrella and drink lemonade and we're out there just laboring away i hope that's not you oh forgive me saints forgive me saints can anybody say with me that's not me that's not me amen now jesus says here in verse 41 he says i receive not honor for men going back in the scripture and that's fine we don't have to go back there but i know you have not the love of god in you i come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive now this is very interesting because you see my brother and sister we know that god is the word right and the word is god so now they he comes jesus speaking this says i come in my father's name in other words i come in the representation of god almighty jehovah and i come in that and you won't receive me but there's others in your midst that have come and they have their own interpretation they have their own thing and they're speaking their interpretation of the word and you receive them you bring them in and you lift them up and you give them place and and it's doing and jesus is actually is that not the same spirit of our day amen we've gone to all of these things my brother and sister and if it don't work out right we always have a reason reminds me of a time many years ago i won't even name the state i don't want to to come back and roost somewhere home not on us but somewhere else but you know there was somebody and and they had uh um they had left their wife married a younger woman hey have you ever noticed that when these guys leave their wives they never go out if they're say 50 years old they never go out and find a 75 year old [Music] doesn't happen it's always if i could put it this way the young sister who was taught to idolize or pastor the reason i don't see him do anything wrong is because i'm just staring in the stars he's so wonderful and now well i mean come on saints maybe we should have the recording shut off but you know when you got a wife that gets up in the morning and goes oh my goodness ah okay give me 15 minutes i'll be able to make it to the kitchen cook you breakfast i think you get the point no they're not like oh she's 75 and beautiful and has a wonderful pension no i'm sorry they could care less about the money they're caught up in the pride of life and the lust of the flesh so this preacher he he gets rid of his wife marries a young woman a lot of things go on one day the spirit of the lord falls upon them and they prophesy the rapture's taking place on this day in this place and it's invitation only and people just clamored for the invitation but did you know that when the sun rose on that mountaintop on that day god didn't come was it false prophecy no sir it's because in the vision this man over here and his wife and his children were in the rapture and they didn't come to the mountaintop so god had the council the rapture it's not false prophecy it's their fault you know that brother you know what he said he said when i heard that prophecy he was a regular attendee of that church until that point right there he said when i heard that prophecy a voice spoke to me and said take it back to the word and he sat down around the table him his wife and his teenage children and they went through this scripture line by line and said this does not fit we're not going and so the whole rapture was cancelled because of them you see my brother and sister how these spirits work when a man would say i come in my father's name won't receive him at all but someone else comes now something more exciting who doesn't want to go in the rapture i want to go i say according to revelations lord come quickly come quickly before these insane people destroy everything around us verse 44 says how can you believe which receive honor one of another saint you ever wonder why paul always says do not say this is paul's church do not say this is paul's church do not say this is paul's church because this is not paul's church paul might keel over tomorrow my it's a talk about an awakening a a guy went to school with just the other day heart attack dead just like that one minute he's talking to somebody next minute he's dead scary my age how can you believe which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from god only you see saints this is a reason we're not looking for this great brother to this great sister this great family this great church we're looking to christ that's what we're holding up and we're drawing night unto him and he said when you draw an iron to me i'll draw an i unto you well i'll tell you the higher you lift men the harder it is to get to them so you're not going to be in their fellowship anyway you lift them up on that pedestal and then and then you're gonna find it's just gonna be really hard to even get a phone call out of them well you're the one that's lifting them up sending them all your money and giving all the adoration no brothers and sisters that's not what god wants god wants us to look to him and him alone amen do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you brother alex go ahead and please put verse 43 4 5 6 7 back up because i'm going to go ahead and just make a statement i was praying about it i wondered about it i was like hesitant to do it but i'm just going to have to say it i'm sorry come in my father's name you receive me not another shall come in his own name him will you receive how can you believe which receive honor one of another seek not honor that cometh from god only amen yeah let's move forward a little bit sorry maybe i quoted you wrong once do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even your prophet to your age hello in whom you trust in whom you trust we've put our life on this gospel but the very things it's preached is what's judging them oh don't think it's the preacher saints i would never judge you i would not judge you i don't i don't have it in my heart i don't have the courage but you see my brother and sister it's coming to the place and it's coming to the time that the very things i made this statement to the church some time back the reason that people think that the preacher is judging them is because they refuse to judge themselves they refuse to go into the word and when the word says it they refuse to respond to it and say i'm going to back up i'm going to repent i'm going to do different i'm going to turn around and go different direction they refuse to do that so he's telling them you think i'm accusing you to the father but there's one that accusing you it's even your prophet that you believe for had you believed moses do i have to go ahead and say it so that it will be plain enough probably should if you had believed the message of the hour you would believe these things because what was he doing he was writing of jesus christ if we had believed the message of the hour we wouldn't be arguing whether he meant that or not we had looked at the word and says yes he says this yes it fits the word it applies to me but if you believe not his writings how shall ye believe the word made manifest walking in your midst can't even believe the writing oh come on saints they don't believe it in their midst because they're reading the writing through their own understanding their own interpretation don't lean to your own understanding pray through on these things pick up your bible pray through on what you read pick up your message read pray through on that because my brother and sister they can come up with an entirely different conclusion and they didn't believe the very manifested word that moses was speaking about standing in their midst because they did not have any revelation of what he actually wrote they brought it down and created their own new church hallelujah i think verse 43 is coming to pass again i really do i think it's present in our day go ahead brother alex let's let's go back i'm come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive i think it's coming to pass all over again we've got a whole nether generation a whole other group of people i don't want you all leaving with bitter taste in your mouth this morning but i don't encourage actually him do the research i'll just put it this way every continent on earth today has a man who has risen up declaring he has a new word from the lord now the new word from the lord doesn't fit the old word from the lord because it's the new word and you're supposed to by the idea that the new word supersedes the old word because this is new revelation but the old word says if they come preaching any either major deviation is that what it says if they come preaching a major deviation don't believe them no sir it says if they come preaching one word differently you know why y'all having so many troubles right now oh you didn't know i knew you was having troubles did you you guys didn't know i visited your house last time and your lamp up there has that little dot that you didn't remember being there before it's just a microphone i wouldn't worry about it don't go home and tear it down no that sounds weird and sick and perverted and because we don't need that you know why i know that you're having troubles the devil's stirring up your house stirring up you because we are so close to the end we are so so so so close to the end and satan is running around doing everything within his power you say i i think oh brother paul i i just some days i just feel so some bombarded i just feel like i'm backslid just hold on that's what it feels like to have all hell turnless against you but you're still standing you're still overcoming you're still repenting you're still praising god you're still praying you're still reading your bible you're still getting up in the morning saying lord yesterday was just didn't go so well but today i'm trusting you lord and the devil's like wait i turned everything i got against them how can they still be standing so don't think brother paul had some special discernment i just happen to know that all hell has been turned loose against you because he's looking and he's seeing the same clock saints that is ticking down time right man one minute 30 seconds whatever it might be to midnight the same clock that is ticking down time for the believer is ticking down time for the demise of lucifer and his followers he can read the same clock he might even be able to read it a little bit better than we do and he's recognizing if i can't get him now i'll never get him i've got to i've got to do something i've got to stop him i've got to just come in like a flood but he forgot to read the word with understanding with the discernment of the holy spirit to realize no matter what he pours in the flood my brother and sister the standard has already been raised up and we will endure we will overcome we will stand triumphant because god said that i've already provided a way for you and the work i have begun in you i will finish oh hallelujah that ought to make a heart rejoice i want to make a heart repent if it's not right with god ought to make us say lord i felt like it was me i felt like i was the failure i felt like i had come short i didn't recognize that was what all hell felt like well praise the lord don't get comfortable with that don't get comfortable with that because you see the demons that are over here trying to destroy you are crying out for help and once they've destroyed someone up there'll be some more show up here and they'll want to come but don't worry about it you ever watch the standard raising i'll tell you i just speak my own life saints things i thought was just fine 15 20 years ago i'd cry out to the lord forgive me lord for doing it today back then i did it willfully the standard's raising god's doing his work for this age hallelujah amen but we believe to the saving of souls do we not now as you look at this you'll see in hebrews the 10th chapter amen cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience amen after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise and yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any many man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him verse 39 ought to be our triumphant trumpet to the lord amen but we're not of them who draw back into perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul hallelujah oh my amen now let's just take this little thing here this little quote we should go from here living different lives because of this a prayer because of your visit with us we will not try to be like pharisee we know that you are the king of prophets you're a god prophet that speaks in our hearts now and we pray that you'll discern our hearts could this be your prayer today saints come on young people old people i want you to look at this because see what will happen is as we come to a point in our life we either accept or reject it comes to every facet of our life whatever is offered to us in this whole facet of life we it really all comes down to what we accept and what we reject and we pray that you'll discern our hearts and i say lord discern my heart and reveal to us are causes that's hindering the great move of god what if what if god would be so gracious saints to come right down into your life and my life and reveal to us the cause of what hinders us is that possible i tell you i lift my hand to the lord and say lord reveal whatever cause would be the hindrance in my life see what's cause it's hindering the great move of god in this last day take that personal don't don't be saying i wonder what brother trevor and sister kerry's hindrances are i wonder what gabriella's hindrances is what is my hindrance what is my hindrance today reveal that to me lord that from here may go anointed ministers anointed men and women with such an inspiration on them of a loving lord jesus until they be a revival breakout all the way across our church before it moves to the county and the state and the continent can someone say grant it lord yes hallelujah we're closing sister emmy musicians would you come door's in a door he says but see it was to me it's absolute truth that's what we look for is truth jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free he is that truth he is jesus the son of god is the truth of the word because he was the word made flesh and in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us then that made him the truth because the word is the truth and he was the truth now when we see him return in these last days this great move of god moving across the nations of the world you know happy valley church had was that six pass away in a short time lord how can that be brother back east quite young by modern day standards and definitely as i get older i felt like he was quite young i think 57 seemingly to be healthy a few short days gone god moving across the face of the earth now saying this just i'm going to put it as my opinion you take it any way you please people are like oh this cove it's so horrible really you think cove it's in control sorry that would be anti-scriptural code's not in control saints god's in control and when god says you know what i'm calling you home he'll use any vehicle he wants to use probably i don't know maybe it's just forgive my terrible humor but i'm not sure covet or car wreck a car wreck or a heart attack this or that really we're not afraid of death death does not control us death has lost its sting amen people are like oh copeland oh comfort it's terrible no praise the lord i happen to know brother bap just a little bit i can't imagine brother bab saying no no lord please send me back no sir he's over on the shores of glory hallelujah singing praises to the king hallelujah hallelujah my brother and sister you see look at this because the word of truth and he was the truth and when we see him return in these last days the great move of god moving across the nations of the world gathering we think okay he's gathering them into church was that his goal was his goal was to gather into church no sir his goal was to gather into himself he is i i didn't put these quotes in because i just knew i'd be too long he's gathering him to himself he's he's not building a kingdom on earth he's building his kingdom which is his pride in him hallelujah see what's happening saints you're gonna ah there's no prophecy don't take it there but you're gonna see more and more saints going to their reward more and more and more and more and people are going to be going what's happening what's happening what's happening i'll tell you what's happening he's gathering them to himself oh i tell you
