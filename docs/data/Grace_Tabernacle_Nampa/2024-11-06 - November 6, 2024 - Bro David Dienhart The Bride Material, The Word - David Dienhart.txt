Christian glad to be here tonight it doesn't matter if there's how many if there's just two or three gathered together in his name see the the key is just not coming but gathered in his name yes he's in our midst God bless you let's bow our heads for a word of prayer our heavenly father certainly you are present you are here to anoint your word you're here to feed our souls you're here to do the exceeding and abundantly above all that we ask or think and now father may we lay aside the Affairs of today the worries the frustrations the discouragement and let us Focus Lord upon your presence upon what you've given us your word Lord Jesus we are not here just to be here we're here to meet you and so Lord that's our our desire and that's your will I pray that you would bring us into a greater unity and a fellowship with you individually and let us realize Lord what we are here to represent and who we are here to obey and what is our absolute we pray now that you would bless your word as it goes forth as you speak it forth through this vessel of clay this instrument is nothing until you pick it up and use it and so father as the word comes out of these lips may it go into your heart of your children their soul and may they walk out of here raised in a higher Plaine we pray for your glory and honor you be magnified and glorified in thy name we pray with Thanksgiving because we know that if we ask anything in your name it'll be done and so father we rejoice in this because your words cannot fail you cannot lie and we give you thanks in jesus' name amen amen amen I'd like you to turn with me in your Bibles to Matthew chapter 4 My Title tonight is the bride material the word the bride material the word my subject is she will only believe the word and it's a god-given quality so my title is the bride material the word and the subject she will only only I want you underline that in your mind only believe the word it's a god-given quality what's the god-given quality to believe Matthew 4 verse one then when Jesus was led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil now can you imagine and not imagine but realized that Jesus led him into the Wilderness to be tempted tried did he lead job yes is he leading us yes all right and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward hungered now we know what the prophet said about a fast you don't get hungry during a fast but then when you're hungry afterwards you're hungry but when you go into a fast you don't get hungry so if you want to know the difference between a real fast and one that's just some helpful thing but a real fast a Godly fast you won't be hungry all right verse three I thought I'd Dro that in for extra measure it's just a sideline and when the tempter came to him he said now listen to the tempter you meet him every single day don't tell me you don't because if you're a Christian you're you're meeting that tempter every day he'll try to reason with you speak to you and one purpose alone get you off of the word all right but when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made breads he were dealing with his physical being if you're the son you can speak to these stones and make him bread but watch Jesus's reply but he answered and said it is written all right I'm going to emphasize that in great big letters his answer was it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then he goes to the next Temptation Jesus answered and said him again verse seven I don't I won't read through those but it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God he offered him a supernatural element now brother Braham said that was real bait for the Pentecostals oh my just give us some Supernatural we know if we do the Supernatural That's the evidence that God's with us or God's in us no it isn't evidence God's with you but it's not the evidence that he's living in you listen let me tell you right now the anointing of the Holy Spirit upon you is no evidence that God's dwelling in your soul I didn't hear any mens on that I'm listen you can be Anointed with that same spirit and still be a devil in the Soul so the anointing isn't the evidence it's the word revealed to you personally by that spirit is the evidence because you recognize the word for your hour and time that's the evidence that you have the ability to hear the word amen that's exactly what it is you go back and see I I was going to cover some of that tonight out of the church age book but you can go back if you want to see it we can show it to you the evidence is here heing and receiving the word by Revelation all right now so let's get back to my I don't want to get on my sideline here now verse 10 he tempted him again showed him the kingdoms of the world the glory of them but Jesus saith unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written see it is written what Jesus stay with here the word the word we ought to be very thankful and to realize that God has given us his word everything we need is in the word everything and the word if you're a Believer Born Again believer the word is in your ship that's right and his way is perfect his leading is perfect and he made your way Perfect all right so Jesus again said for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve see he it's every time I'm making the emphasis that he went back to the word he said the the weakest of Christians can defeat the Devil anywhere at any time on any PL at any place by the word by the word I want you to notice before you're seated here before we read another scripture I want you to notice here as we go through this tonight that Jesus here did not reason with the Devil he went right to the word and that's where he stood now what are we to do if we're growing up maturity of himself we will do the same thing our Victory is the word and we are his victory because we are the word amen all right turn with me to Philippians Philippians 1 verse vers 20 and 21 Paul speaking according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ the word Christ is the anointed word amen amen all right Christ in you Christ the anointed word in all boldness as always so now Christ all shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death Paul has been ministering on the change of thought the change of thought is a right mental attitude toward the word that's in your heart and written here in the scriptures that's exactly what a change of thought is it's a attitude is a positioning and when you change your thought and bring it in line with the word the word's got to be manifest because just a right mental attitude toward the word will bring it to pass I may always said that over and over again the prophet said thus sayeth the Lord he said the angel told me that a right mental attitude toward the word of God will bring it to pass amen yeah we do need to change the thought we need to bring our thought mental con our thought our spirit realm our mental realm under obedience to the word and stand right there only believe now the next verse 21 because he wanted to see that the what what what for what for that the that God Christ will be magnified in my body what body whether it be by life or by Death Christ will be magnified yes amen all right verse 21 for me to live is Christ we're talking about our absolute here Paul was speaking about his absolute for me to live is the word for me to live is Christ everything I need in this life everything absolutely everything is the word I don't need to go off of it away from it reason with anybody about it it comes right back to this word if that word said so I believe it if it commanded something I want to do it that's all there's to it it's written all right okay so for me to live as Christ and to die as gain you may be seated God God bless you bride material here's something that brother Bram said he said you can't make yourself believe amen you can't make yourself believe he said you he said it's something it's a quality that's in you you can't make yourself you can't make you believe is what he's trying to say it's a it's something and it's a quality it's something that's a quality that's in you all right he said and and he and he he was referring now I'll just stop right there and I'll go back to here's something else there's brother Brandon speaking on the message perfect Faith now it's talking about the bride material material means substance it also means evidence so something that's material is a substance material is a substance of something and and also means an Evidence it can mean an Evidence you take a material of something it's an Evidence of something else it's an Evidence okay and so on paragraph 114 a perfect faith and so when a man lives by faith now we know that faith is a revelation and when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is Isola ated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ he's absolutely become isolated from the entire world now you know now you see what we're to walk by and we'll come into this more as we go he said there there now there now you're getting into bride material he said see he said you're getting into rapturing condition that means for each one of us not just the pastor the the trustees that means for the Ley every individual amen walks in a world with God alone I pray that that strikes your soul that you're walking with God alone you're not walking with God and the outer man you're walking with God Alone other words I said that because the the Bond woman will not be air with the free yeah amen that's right because you're the free woman you're the one that has come alive you're the new creature you're God's material amen and you're not and it's no evidence of what the outside feelings are is the evidence of what you have on the inside because it's not air with this free woman or the free word on the inside NE and plus the Elder is going to serve this quickening power this quickening spirit that is me on the inside amen that's right the second man was the Lord From Heaven is that right first man is Earthly the second man hello the New Birth the new creation is the word is the is a quickening spirit the Bible said and the prophet said you are the spirit of God that lives in you and that spirit of God is the quickener of the word it's a quickening spirit he said I'll also it will also Quicken your mortal body and bring it subject to what his word hallelujah his word all right so he said every individual walks in the world with God Alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God watch what he said he gives the orders he that loves me keeps my commandment he that loves me will keep my word he that does not keep my word does not love me amen all right he said he gives the orders and you the body you the vessel you amen the part of him the body member you pack them out whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere you walk right on whatever he says that ought to to be ultimate there's no adding to it there's no taking away from it there's no listening to anything contrary to it though the devil will try to reason you out of it and try to get you to give you a reason why you believe the word you don't have to give him a reason about why you believe it you don't have to explain it we cannot I don't have to explain at all to you why I believe what the word said he said it and that settles it amen that's the word you said it that settles it but the devil's going to ask you why you believe such and such I don't I don't even have to know why if he said it my soul says Amen to it and I believe it and it doesn't change it God's word is Flawless God's word is complete God's word is is absolutely perfect beyond our estimation of perfect he's perfect Hallelujah all right so whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt any nowhere you walk right on because why it's the word if there's a Shadow of Doubt there's something wrong with your experience with him if there's a Shadow of Doubt if your soul has a Shadow of Doubt you better get to the word real quick and ask for the shadow to be removed because in him there's no shadow of turning he is the light and he he that's walking in the light walks with God and God is the word and in him is no Darkness you can't add to the word and take away from it the original color is white you add anything to it it's perverted you have a shadow then the reason there's a shadow there's Light present but then there's a negative but in the word is no negative the word has no negative it's all positive all right now there's not a Shadow of Doubt anywhere you walk on the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it but how easy we are to be talked out of it how easy we are to have no patience to wait on it and we go out and try to accomplish what we think the word is trying to tell us to do we go on her own not under headship but on her own and that's exactly what Eve did hey Adam I found a way to fulfill God's word of bringing bringing reproduction here and she went out on her own without headship out of her out of her headship and that's exactly that dominating female Spirit rules this political realm in the world and the nation today is that dominating Spirit female Spirit which brother brandham said is the greatest curse in the world we don't have to have a woman president the woman's already president hello spiritually she already dominates this nation is number 13 I say don't get caught up in that political nonsense stay out of it stay with the word go back to the word everything you need is the word and the bride is the word and her Fellowship is the word and her word is her absolute nothing else you don't get caught up in their political moves stay out of their political moves there's a lot of things well we you don't believe in abortion yeah yeah we don't believe in abortion right we agree to those things but that is no R well why don't you join up with the sin because you're doing it out of the word you're doing it out of headship you're doing it wrong you're going about it you're not going about it according to the word you see the word is our head all right if there's nobody in the world can talk you there's nobody in the world talk yet you go right on just the same now you're Now That's What Makes You unusual and er radical to people around you because you're staying with the word and you can't explain it I don't care any preacher that and I say it I probably said it myself stand up say am I making any sense to you that is wrong it's not the word making sense to you that's reasoning it's the word whether you believe it or not it doesn't have to make sense no it doesn't have to make sense he said it that's all I need to know he said it I believe that it's written and the Holy Spirit will always go back to the word can't lead you off of the word away from the word it always leads you right back to the word and all you must do with the word is only believe what's only mean alone the word alone you don't have to reason with it figure it out don't go back to your feelings don't go back to your feelings then you've made yourself an idol you've made yourself your feelings become what you're bowing to instead of the word nothing will if that's the case your feelings are your absolute then all right you go on you're just coming see what are you doing now you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect Faith what is perfect Faith God's Own Faith perfect Perfection perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a Mystic to them with this perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect Faith are a Mystic other words they're a mystery to others they're unusual they're strange because all they go back to is the word it's written it's written it's the word and that's all you need to go back to right amen amen when you obey the word it puts God on the scene and that settles it amen you don't have to question the word if you question the word that's the spirit of unbelief amen all right now this man brother Braham talks about this father was getting brother Bram come in him and his wife was wanting to have prayer for their son dying of black diptheria and I'll just bypass a lot of that but finally he got in and the and the the doctor allowed him to come in you know wouldn't allow him to originally be and but now he allows him to dress him up like a Cooks clu Clan and you know as the prophet made it and so he said uh and they and they just said just a simple prayer and the and the father got up and said said he said just think honey our son is healed and they started rejoicing over his healing now look what they were standing on okay rejoicing over here remember they couldn't have believed like that without having given that quality okay it's got to be a revelation we do not walk by our senses we can say things all we want cuz confession wise but unless you believe it it's not a confession of your mind carnal it's a confession of Faith a confession of faith is what moves God to action and faith is a revelation and you don't move until God says move now that's the communion between a Believer and his and his Lord how do they operate by love which which works what faith faith works by love obedience brings absolutely God on the scene but he's Sovereign when he will manifest it but it's for you to wait because God is faithful he must keep his word so he's going to test you to see if you'll stay with it yeah the devil say well you know it's meant already 5 days and you haven't had a change or a month or two years or 5 years or 25 years and you know you know you must not have faith that's just the way the devil talks sure is but the word didn't say that your senses are telling you that he's using your senses brother Braham said reject him he said you don't have to accept anything he offers you through your senses amen all right now he said now he said I'm he's this fellow said just think he's healed well the little nurse I forget the man's old look his father-like fellow walked up the nurse said sir you don't understand your your son is dying oh no he said no he's not dying he said the old fellow walked up put his hand upon the little nurse's shoulder and said sister he she said see you're looking at that chart said that's all you know is look at that but said I'm looking at a Divine promise that's the difference stop a minute he's given you his word heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord do you believe that that's written right when's the last time you told the devil that when he question you're going and coming see but my steps are ordered of the Lord you always have the word for every answer you can come back to the word with the Enemy and the devil can't break through that word as long as you stay with the word all right that's your head now equality is a distinctive attribute or characteristic possessed by someone or something equality is a distinctive attribute are you a distinctive attribute of God okay other words a that quality is a standard it's your standard I Isaiah 59:19 said when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost will lift raise up a standard against him and then the prophet says quoting that scripture he said are you one of them are you one of those standard are you the word if you're the word where's your faith what's your faith in the standard is there there yes amen amen all right then he then he said are you one of them the word bride the word bride is one of them that's one of them and the word bride is yoked with him remember Jesus said take my yoke upon you become a prisoner as I am take my yoke take the word upon you take my yoke upon you said he said you're yolked with him your absolute is the word a prisoner to the word Deuteronomy 76 let's just read that we can go back to Deuteronomy a very um probably you already know what what it is but let's just read that Deuteronomy chapter 7 and verse 6 for thou art a holy people we're talking about this bride being a of a special quality now I want to say not only is she given that quality to believe but she is also a different quality the prophet said a Believer is of a different quality yes all right now he said but she said now thou art a holy people and what who's she speaking of a special class thou th art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people above all people that are upon the face of the Earth other words she's of a different material that's right quality now there's one material but but he takes out of that out of a certain section of that material and makes the bride the rest of it is good material still the good material but he takes out of a section of that material just like the book of life is all the word but there's an eternal life section in that book that's bride only and he takes out of that material and makes the bride the rest of it amen is foolish virgin which is a which is a uh Remnant yes of that seeden now she is not of the quality of the Bride number one she's not born again number two she never did get oil even though she tried to go to get it the prophet said she didn't get it several places the prophet said she did not get it yeah all right she she went to get it but she didn't get it if she got it she'd be in the Rapture that's right am I'm not saying she might not had an anointing to do what she did because she was a she was a certain class of people that were good to the people of the bride and would be saved and would receive eternal life at the Judgment white throne but the bride was already ready to go into the marriage they that were ready went in well why she was clothed in that Garment of righteousness the bride was why too because they took their lamps the foolish virgin but no no oil but the bride had oil in their vessel that's rightel that's the difference amen so she was a special class of people with a special quality and was and was material bride material that's taken out of that material a special class and put in the book into a section one book just a different section yes Hallelujah that's right it was called the eternal life section which is the Lamb's wife the lamb and the Lamb's wife the only things that H that are Eternal and always were well that was a good one amen that's right because he's Eternal and had in himself his own substance called The Bride that's right all right I'm getting off my line here let's go back all right now so she's chosen in him holy and without remember the Bible said Ephesians 1 we chose him he chose us in himself to be what holy did not Deuteronomy 7:6 said thou art a holy people all right Ephesians 1 said he chose us Ephesians 13 or 4 he chose us in himself before the foundation of the world to be holy and Without Blame before him in love who's love he is why would he choose us in love because he chose us in himself and so therefore we are his love today projected amen that's why we are also his love but we are also his victory because the word is our Victory amen and he is the victory therefore we are the victory what is the victory that overcometh the world our faith what's Faith do Faith takes its resting place in the unmovable Eternal Word of God that's what faith does amen amen he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches see he that hath it's a god-given quality to be able to hear and to hear is to receive the word for the season by Revelation that's the faith that's why the prophet said a real believer is the faith of God that moves in him in you amen all right so now coming back to this he said I mentioned this is out the church age book I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you'll see that it won't take ordinary study and thinking to make the book real that's carnal that's that's that's intellectual thinking God never did tell you to go out and learn it that way he said it would be revealed it's given to you as a quality he said I've chosen you in myself and you're going to know me because I knew you you'll know me it's exactly right all right now he said that means this book he said is he said it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost to make the book real what book the book of redemption all right all right see now he said this book that means this book can't be revealed to anyone or other words it can't be revealed to everyone everyone if they bride but not everyone public outside of bride all right it can't be revealed to just anyone but it's revealed to a special class of people yeah now I didn't say that he said it no you say brother brandham said it but brother brandham had the sword in his hand and when he had the sword in his hand God had it in his hand is that right then the word cames to it and we don't have to question whether this Prophet is a Vindicated prophet he was Vindicated by the word Vindicated by by the by The Works that he did Vindicated him it proved it was Messiah it proved it was God standing in flesh before us it proved that it was him God himself Among Us the son of man revealed and if he's revealed who's he revealed to and if he's revealed to you you are the manifestation of the son of man because today the promise is he would be revealed through the bride in the bride and through the bride he would work in and through her so the son of man is revealed field in Bride form amen because in you is not a different person it's him we see him in Revelation chapter 1 in the midst of the church as it looked at as he was the son of man but how was he dressed he was dressed in women's garment I'll leave that go drop it right there all right now it will require it'll take it'll take one a special class of people with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God it will require the quality ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction that's why the evidence is that instruction in you showing the teacher the inside teacher has come in you and leading you into all truth you don't have to question it believe it amen glory to God this bride this woman the bride is under submission to her head just as a wife is submitted to her husband she doesn't go out and run out of that and do and that's why the vote of the woman was wrong because at the same time she began to Bob her hair just to cut the ends is cutting your hair you're denying your head ship of the word or your husband if you're a married woman you're under headship God put her under headship amen is that right in the beginning because she went out on her own reasoning and tried to make something work and tried to do and and tried to bring about by knowledge the Fulfillment of the word and it wasn't she did it in the wrong way she should have waited on the word and the word would have come forth and spoke and inspired and it would have taken place by the word that's right all right a lot could be said right there all right now it will requir Supernatural instru not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear getting back how you're a Mystic to others a mystery to others didn't the didn't Paul say we we speak this mystery we speak a hidden Mystery but we speak to them that are perfect that can re other words them that can receive it and there's only one perfect that's Christ but if Christ be in you you're perfect you you the real you the you birth word you is perfect all right because why it's him okay now it'll require a teaching of the spirit never comes clear we need to hear from God and lay oursel look at lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know what's know Faith all right now notice long hair Nazarite vowed to the word I'll picture the bride of Christ now we'll PCT we picture the Antichrist where she is and it's two women today one's Antichrist the other's the word coming right to their head amen it's right there two of them all right he said now notice he said we picture that now where she is the Antichrist is religious and everything Science Now The Humble little bride of Christ just simply believes the word whoever she is it's individuals simply believes the word it's not groups right it's individuals amen yes the word can only recognize the word amen I hope you capture that it it can't recognize a denomination or a perversion why would it be a perversion they take something add something to it take something away from it operated under a different contrary to the word than what God Said Yes and it looks so reasonable so right but it's wrong it's anti- word all right right I all and I hope that I brought said every one of you said the word can only yeah it knows better it know the word knows better than that perversion it catches the per it's the word it can't recognize you can't recognize nothing but the word a wheat can't be nothing but a wheat it started a wheat it'll head up a wheat a weed can't be a wheat yet it's watered by the same anointing you see false anointed ones doesn't mean the anointing was false it means that one that's anointed is false do you understand all right the anointing is the Holy Ghost that's why you've got to be careful you don't speak against the anointing that's right because it'll anoint both of them make one shout make one cast just because see they'll cast out Devils Judas did just as well as the real seed did they C so casting out Devils is the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost dwelling in you although it's the Holy Ghost That cast out Devils right that's right and it's done by faith but was Judas a seed of God no he was a seed of Satan doing miracles signs wonders speaking tongues prophesy and be the truth what about balum what about cfas they were anointed by a genuine Holy Ghost anointing and that Holy Ghost can anoint your spirit not only the flesh the spirit the second realm but the soul realm the Third Realm isn't the word right amen that ought to be preached on brother Braham said it should be preached on and talked about in this age because that's one of the Mysteries when Jesus said there shall be false christs and false prophets false teachers well then brother brandham would you say the anointing would be a false no he said the anointing can be the Holy Ghost anointed anointing the genuine Holy Ghost now you've heard that spoken over and over again you go back in the scriptures and see if that's not true but what are we talking about today I'm not talking about the false ones that are anointed I'm talking about the true seed that's anointed it's Jesus Christ for the day revealed in Bride form other words the prophet said he's manifesting himself in the formation of the Bride things that are to be he said he's revealing himself in the formation of the bride and he said the revelation of Jesus Christ not for his day but for this day it's not another person being revealed but he said the revelation of Jesus Christ for this day is growing in a bride to the full stature but we had to have the full word to come into full stature that's why the seals opened amen because it was the full revelation of Jesus Christ and that's the secret of his coming because he's coming in a form they didn't expect him to come in he's coming for a body change he's picking up his people I could go a lot of I'll just save that because I'll probably hit that later on in the next meeting or two we have all right now now I'm I'm losing time here but I'm just going to try to watch my time very closely now her long hair a Nazarite vow showed that she is vowed to God and if you have hair long it shows your under headship amen and your husband's your head well he's not a Believer it doesn't matter he's still your head as long as he doesn't cause you or make you to do something contrary to the word you're still to honor him and serve him you're under headship you're vowed to him We're vowed to Christ is that right all right then he said and she is vowed to God her beautiful gown what is that referring to Revelations 198 to her was granted she should be raid and fine lenen clean and white with which are the right why righteousness of the Saints and what's that righteousness the Saints denoting that she's accepted she's received and that she's pure and God sees her as faultless and no sin she's recognized she has a purity and she was ready to go into the marriage and the marriage is come amen and there's a union taking place and and it's not a public show it's a mystery because it's the mystery of his coming now I'm I'm going to stop there because I'm not going to go any further on that all right let's get back I keep moving well no the Lord's moving this so he is the word and that's your absolute be true to Christ the word he'll V if you'll be true to Christ the word he'll vindicate it to be true no sir he said not even an of anything towards making love to the other man not join his ranks or anything to Satan or let him get you in his arms or in his care or talk you over to his way oh my I let's just go on here I was going to read something out of the church age book that can well let me just read a portion of it if I can because in paragraph or page one uh 355 paragraph 127 of the book of the new church age book we have it's quoting the scripture I will keep thee in the hour of from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go through the tribulation it meant that it would have said that but it said I will keep the from the hour of Temptation this temptation is exactly like the Temptation in Eden now we're facing that today all right he said it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded word and it's happening brother and sister and it's going to get worse so why is God trying to speak of something here today tonight to you like this because it's a warning you have been given his word that's all you need don't let the devil reason you into other things and proceed on your own amen listen to it now all right I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation okay I other words I'll keep thee out of tribulation out of Great Tribulation not out of of tribulation but out of Great Tribulation all right now so this this inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to the command of God's word and yet from the standpoint listen to this of human reasoning it will be very so very right so enlightening and lifegiving as to fool Eve the world the woman but not the bride but watch it's going to seem very reasonable so enlightening just like it was to Eve so reasonable so enlightening this man makes sense he's speaking knowledge and they were commanded not to partake of that tree of Good and Evil is that right but here Satan's telling her why if you partake of this tree you'll know good from evil see right back very thing contrary to the word if Eve would have said no no Satan no I'm going to stay with the word it's written I'm not talking to you brother Bram said she stopped and listened what he had to say is that right don't stop brother R said keep going you have nothing to question nothing to add to the word or take from it it is written that's your standard yes amen all right now it but it'll be light enlightening lifegiving as to fool that's why I said eve it's fooling EES today but it can't fool the bride because she's a part of the word if she should start to go off God will bring her back yeah it's always the word it's always the word but don't you go out knowing right and not do it because him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him is sin just take the word all you need everything is already provided for you to make a Rapture in this word all right now I'm not I don't know if I'll read any further only the elect brother Bram said well it sound like the bride but he says only the very elect will not be fooled why won't they be fooled brother brandom said why would those two Spirits be so close it would deceive the elect if possible if he said why can't they be deceived because they are the word and he just said the word comes to the word the word will receive the word they can't disbelieve no one can make them disbelief the word then you become aware by the word Satan is opposite he will do anything he can but you check it with the word don't you receive it and well you say how do I know if it's wor word or not if you got the Holy Ghost that's the discerner amen he'll show you that's right where's your confidence in your own ability to know right from wrong or God's ability working in you all right now the Temptation will be as follows this Ecom munical move that has started on what seems to be a blissful and blessed principle fulfilling God's prayer that we all might be one becom so strong politically today it's become strong and is becoming stronger politically what is this dominating female she's left the word and gone to politics she rejected the word God's way of doing things and works through politics that's why you stay out of it don't you get your mind all consumed with politics stay at the word Satan will use that if he can to get you away from that word and you be put your mind on that you begin to work through the same realm trying to CH they're trying to change the world oh we'll get the world back the very thing they're day we'll we will we will make America great again no they won't they left the word there's no way for it to be great again get your mind get your attitude get your mental attitude get your thought on the word and remain there and ask God to open that word to youen I say that pretty hard don't I that sounds like I'm pretty mad doesn't it but I'm not and I love you and I love this word and I'm not afraid to be what God made me to be amen and I'm not going to preach like this one or that one or somebody else I'll preach it just the way he wants to preach it but check it by the word all right and don't judge it by the outer man because if you judge the outer man John missed it John the John the Baptist missed it if he judge it by the outer man Jesus himself missed it it wasn't like the kind old priest he raided ropes and beat him out of the temple now if you judge him by that you would say he's not bearing fruit what's the fruit that bear the word for the season it's got to be the word we don't judge a man by the outward what is his inward saying what is he living what's his life what's he pointing you to Jesus when he did that pointed them to the word he was making correction by the word it's always the word and Jesus is in you what will he do he will keep his word Glory all right so she Bears political power she Bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or indirectly through adherence to principles enacted into law so that no people be recognized actual Church actual churches unless under direct or indirect Den domination of this Council that's coming to pass that will absolutely happen little groups will lose Charters and privileges they lose property and spiritual rights with the people as this pressure increases and it will it'll be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege where are you standing then when Satan comes along and says you know just just agree with them they'll let you preach about brother brandom and all about him and everything just agree with this if you agree with it you're going against the word okay you see why it it's a must that you must come to that Holy Spirit in you okay I've got to close now you listened only one voice amen see see so many will be tempted to go along for they'll feel that it's better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization and it's going to be very looks very right and real to do that all right reasonable then not to serve God at all publicly but they he to believe the devil's Li is to serve Satan I could go on and read more if you want to read it page 35 6 all right you listen to only one voice my sheep know my voice a stranger what's his voice the word it's the Bible just stay with that voice a stranger they won't follow see the two opposing Spirits at work in this evil age can't you see it each very religious Cain and Abel Spirits again among coming to their heads as they started one worshiping by Beauty and by knowledge by education and science and ethics and the other one by faith the revelation of the word of God there's the difference amen both of them standing right here in this building this morning he said when when that little woman that was about ready to die and only had one cake to make and one little bit of oil and the Elijah the word came to her and said bake me a cake first what the Bible say say Seek Ye the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things that go with that righteousness will be added unto you go with it see all right but put God first put his word first put his Spirit first put him first instead of that we put him last we put him under our feelings we put him under our emotions we put him under reasoning we put him under imagination and memory and Satan is the master with using any of that that's your mental that's your mind that's where the battles fought all right but will you have an Adam Bomb laying in the soul if you're born again just raise it up and apply the word it's written and Satan has to flee resist the devil and he will flee from you to resist him is to turn him down just what Jesus did turn him down don't reason with him you never saw Jesus in any one of those Temptations reasoning with the devil he did not reason with him he didn't discuss it he came back and said it's written that's the believer that's the bride that's his character yesterday that is his character today amen make me a little cake first Elijah told her what's what's she going now Elijah's testing her the word's testing her what's she going to do if she's obedient to the see to see if she's obedient to the word she turns and starts not knowing why she's doing it she couldn't explain it she just knew to obey okay don't let the devil come to you and say why don't you do this why don't you do that why is this happening why is that happening I thought you were a Believer don't you discuss it with him it's written greater is he that is in me than he that is of the world when your flesh wants to talk to you come back to it and speak to it it's written Satan want to use that it raises up all right but you must die daily take up your cross and follow the word follow the word word keep your focus on the word he's present he's not a he's not a history he is but he's not a historical God he's present tense right here in you amidst the storm amidst the trial he knew every bit of it and led you that way and if you'll obey him he'll get you out of it if he told the people that in the ship they're going to the other side they're going to the other side he was in the ship to fulfill it but as soon as they started popcorn testimony telling how great things he did great things he did great things he did and all of a sudden the storm comes upon him and then they turn and realize he's in the ship and say is it your will that we perish what care no he said care ye not that we perish can you can you imagine that here they're just exalting him the great things he did he's the word and then so don't you care that we perish he was in the ship just to be called just the word and the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians now I'm I'm coming to a close all right now so bring me a cake and when she obeyed the word then men and women who are led by the spirit of God sometimes do things they don't know why they're doing don't know they're doing what they're doing turned and started into the house and she heard the voice behind him voice again and the cruise of Wilds will not and the meal will not pass see when she obeyed Amen brother Brandon was in a storm coming out of that storm KN he had to get out of that storm in Colorado if he didn't get down there quite he'll never get out of there he knew that he was on his way down quite away number of yards down and the Holy Spirit spoke to him he said turn around and go back where you came from he knew in his reasoning that if he went back humanly he wouldn't get out again but did he consider it no he obeyed did you hear me yes he obeyed what the spirit said do taking no question he said I knew better than to not obey that voice I obeyed that voice I went back up there when he when God saw that he obeyed what happened God met him what's God looking for obedience obedience is better than sacrifice obey the word Jesus was taught Jesus learned obedience what did he learn obedience hear me he learned obedience by the things he suffered and being made perfect is that right he became our perpetuation he became our sacrifice the perfect lamb amen by what by testing trials suffering he learned obedience how you going to learn it all right the bride will only do his will nobody can make them do otherwise Revelation which is Faith makes no claims of knowledge the real true Christian it belongs to Christ it's his wife the real Christian belongs to him not a church wife but she's an obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith in obedience to him that's your bride amen and so this little bride is walking by what faith to Faith to Faith to Faith the just shall live by faith is that right all right then the Bible said and from glory to glory he's changing me all right now she has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spir then then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know they know but see what's the secret of this here's the secret the word is in the bride the word is in the bride that's the secret what's the secret of it what's the silence the word is in the bride where is he coming the word is in the bride there's a union taking place she was ready she went in amen that's it and the door was shut when at the last Trump the last one come in and the other standing outside let us in let us in and Jesus turned around and said I don't know you with me all right all right now so now we know God they know that God is in them fulfilling his own word so now he works in and through the bride I'm rushing through this just stay with me just a minute Christ the word is heading up also the Christ word bride excuse me is heading up also in her head the other is in an Ecclesia heading heading to an ecclesiastical head but the bride is coming to a head because she's going to be United back to the mate it's got to unite everything church and everything else has got to unite brother Bram said we are in the uniting time amen the wheat everything comes back to its head where it started from Canan Abel word bride heading up in the person look the word bride is heading up in the person of the word of God made manifest in this evil age that we're now living and I said the believer day is is of a different quality all right I'm I'm this is I'm closing oh could you compare a Christian today with them Christians of long ago how then disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the Holy Ghost just a prisoner as I preached on the other night a prisoner to the word and will of God he couldn't even even move until God moved him now there it is right there you're led by the spirit Faith leads all right the word's leading she can do nothing outside of the head leading think of that amen now because she's under headship she's not going to go out of headship would he said a prisoner to the word and will of God he couldn't even move till God moved me wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that it's going to it's got to come that's right it's on its road now and where are we now 60 years later where are we in the maturing of it amen I believe we're right at the maturity just think of that now yeah all right oh he said he said see Jesus knew who he was therefore he had Faith he had Faith could produce when he knowed what he was now I just chew on that he knew he was therefore he had faith faith could produce when he knowed what he was if he abide in me and my word in you you know what you are he says oh little flock do not fear this age is fast closed as it does those tears will be bound together as a three-fold cord is not easily broken they will have a tremendous now watch this is taking coming to pass they will have a tremendous three-fold strength of political physical satanical spiritual satanical power and they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will suffer suffer brings obedience she will suffer but she will endure now this is not just a man's mind speaking here this is your word said fear not those things which are coming upon the Earth fear not for he who loved his own loveth them unto the End Amen what did he say oh little flock do not fear now last quote now I'm going to have you stand we're dismissing all right after a couple songs Don't Fear John who's John bride don't fear Little Flock all that I am you are air to all my power is yours that's my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use why are we murmuring why are we complaining why are we always speaking about how bad we are when he's in the ship he's leading you you're not walking by chance God's allowing it for a purpose and Satan's right on your shoulder saying explain the purpose say I don't know the purpose but the word says it is written I don't have to negatively come on these negative things don't let a negative thought come in your mind you have nothing to complain about you have nothing to murmur about he's with you he's in you I will never leave you nor forsake you I will be with you even in you where is your confidence in your feelings or in the word help us that's right help every one of us amen three fingers are pointing back here at me we're all in it but what is where is our absolute to every situation to every feeling to everything it is written if he said it that's all I need to know I believe believe it that's your answer oh but you'll be strange you'll be unusual you'll be ER radical to people related to you and not related that's right to the government to everybody else because you stand upon the word but the word's unmovable the word's Eternal the word's never going to fail you've already failed the word can't that's right so which would you rather stand on you speak the word I will perform it that is my Covenant did God make a covenant he sure has here it is that's my Covenant and it can never fail what's he do never has never has the word failed in the mouths of believing Christians what's he do he Reveals His thought to you and you speak the thought what's he revealing to you the word and you speak the word which is a thought expressed and it's got to come to pass because when you speak that in Jesus Christ's name it's not David when I do that it's not David speaking it's he that is in me amen let's stand together thank you thank you for allowing me to go about
