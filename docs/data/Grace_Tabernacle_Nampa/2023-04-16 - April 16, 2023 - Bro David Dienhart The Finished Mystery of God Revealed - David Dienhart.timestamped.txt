[49:57] right
[49:58] you can't presume you have to know
[50:03] the new birth is not a presuming the new
[50:05] birth is annoying right
[50:07] it's Jesus Christ revealed in you
[50:10] amen
[50:11] and that is not a hearsay that's not an
[50:14] emotion that's not a feeling it's a
[50:17] revelation

[50:25] so let's not presume
[50:28] just because you you can you can do a
[50:31] lot of they have pictures of the Prophet
[50:33] you have messages in your home that
[50:34] doesn't save you come to church that
[50:36] doesn't save you being a part of a group
[50:38] doesn't save you
[50:41] but being born into the body of Christ
[50:43] does
[50:45] amen amen while you're standing you turn
[50:49] with me to Revelations 10. I'll just
[50:50] read something here I didn't
[50:53] this is towards the back of the service
[50:55] and sometimes the Lord will take it I
[50:56] mean to the all the way from the back
[50:58] now bring It Forward
[51:00] brother Branham and Samaritan Church age
[51:02] Church age book
[51:04] he was asked the question what is the
[51:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:09] it is the spirit baptizing you into the
[51:12] body of Christ it is the new birth
[51:16] it is the spirit of God coming in and
[51:19] filling you after you have repented
[51:21] having heard his word and been baptized
[51:23] in water as an answer of a good
[51:26] conscience toward God
[51:29] we are what we have set forth be much
[51:32] easier for all to understand if they
[51:34] believe the doctrine of the Oneness of
[51:36] the godhead without that Revelation
[51:38] brother sister remember what he told
[51:40] Peter he said Peter Thou Art Peter an
[51:42] individual and he says you this
[51:44] Revelation didn't come by intellectual
[51:46] learning it came from my father he
[51:48] revealed this to you and upon this
[51:50] revelation
[51:51] of who I am I'll build my church
[51:55] amen my body
[51:57] and he says he says for there are not
[52:00] three persons in the godhead but one
[52:03] thus we are not born again by the spirit
[52:06] of life of Jesus coming in and then
[52:08] subsequent to that the Holy Spirit
[52:10] coming in to give you us power
[52:14] he says there aren't two comings of the
[52:16] spirit just one the trouble is that
[52:19] people don't know the real truth and
[52:21] they simply believe in Jesus for
[52:23] remission of sin but never go on to
[52:25] receive the spirit
[52:31] you remember
[52:34] you remember that
[52:37] you got to you can't you've got to go
[52:40] further
[52:41] you've got to go all the way in who can
[52:43] go all the way in only the elect
[52:45] but I pray that we're all elect
[52:48] and who doesn't it's just that in the
[52:52] elect the seed is laying there The Germ
[52:53] was laying there to be quickened
[52:56] amen that's the only one that can be
[52:58] born again
[53:00] because the new birth is Christ in you
[53:01] revealed and it takes the water of the
[53:04] Holy the baptism to baptize that seed
[53:09] amen amen and then you move you're
[53:12] sealed into the body
[53:14] then you grow
[53:16] as you lay in the presence of the Sun
[53:18] the message of the hour you grow
[53:20] amen you're growing into a stature and
[53:23] that stature is Christ in you
[53:26] amen that's who you are now I said a lot
[53:28] in those statements
[53:30] a lot could be said about it and a lot
[53:32] more to be said about it but let's just
[53:35] go to our message now my title here is
[53:38] the finished mystery of God revealed
[53:41] the finished mystery of God revealed
[53:44] what is the mystery of God revealed who
[53:48] is it is Christ
[53:50] it's Christ
[53:51] the finished mystery of God revealed
[53:55] amen
[53:57] I'll give you my subject in just a
[53:59] moment I'd like you to turn with me to
[54:00] Revelations chapter 10.
[54:07] beginning with the first verse we'll
[54:09] read the whole chapter so it can be a
[54:10] little bit of reading here so bear with
[54:12] me just stick with me on this
[54:15] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[54:18] from heaven
[54:20] clothed with the cloud sounds like Acts
[54:23] chapter 1 verse 11.
[54:26] not only sounds like it it is
[54:31] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[54:33] from heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[54:36] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[54:38] as it were the Sun
[54:43] and his feet as pillars of Fire
[54:47] and he had in his hand a little book
[54:51] open
[54:53] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[54:55] and his left foot on Earth notice the
[54:57] little book he had in his hand was open
[55:03] and he and cried with a loud voice as
[55:06] when a lion roarth and when he had cried
[55:09] seven Thunders uttered their voices
[55:12] other words what was uttered was the
[55:13] Revelation contained in the seals
[55:15] because the book was a sealed book with
[55:18] Seven Seals
[55:21] and when the seven Thunders had uttered
[55:23] their voices I was about to write and I
[55:25] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[55:27] seal up those things which the seven
[55:29] Thunders uttered and write them not same
[55:32] thing it was told Daniel in chapter 12
[55:34] seal the book the book is sealed to the
[55:37] time of the end
[55:38] and we find here that we and I'll I'll
[55:41] just skip oh no I will read it and the
[55:43] angel which I saw upon the sea and upon
[55:46] the Earth lifted up his hand
[55:51] excuse me his hand to heaven and swear
[55:53] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[55:55] created heaven and the things that
[55:57] therein are
[55:59] and the Sea and the things which are
[56:01] therein that there should be time no
[56:02] longer so so he's declaring now he said
[56:06] that that
[56:07] this this time no longer is at the end
[56:10] but in the days of The Voice
[56:16] but in the days of the voice of the
[56:18] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[56:19] sound the mystery of God
[56:22] should be finished so told us when it
[56:24] would be done
[56:25] it was the time of the end
[56:28] or other words time no longer is delayed
[56:31] brother Branham said though sealed being
[56:33] open tell us that we've arrived it's the
[56:36] end time he said how long now before we
[56:38] meet in the air I don't know
[56:42] amen but he said this was to come at the
[56:45] time of the end
[56:46] all right
[56:48] but in the days of the voice of the
[56:50] seventh Angels this is message of the
[56:51] seventh angel and he shall begin to
[56:53] sound the mystery of God should be
[56:55] finished
[56:57] as the as he hath declared unto his
[57:00] servants the prophets
[57:02] and the voice which I heard what was
[57:07] John
[57:08] type bride and the voice which I heard
[57:11] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[57:14] go and take the little book which is
[57:17] open was closed it was the sealed now
[57:20] it's open it's unsealed
[57:23] brother Graham said our message is
[57:25] Revelations 10. the opening of The Seven
[57:28] Seals he said one place it's the opening
[57:31] of the seventh seal
[57:33] all right
[57:36] complete completion and the voice which
[57:39] I heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[57:41] and said go and take the little book
[57:42] that is which is open in the hand of the
[57:45] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[57:48] upon the Earth
[57:50] brother Branham spoke of a book within
[57:52] the book he said there is another record
[57:55] that pertains to the bride though
[57:57] contained in the Book of Life
[58:01] and it's a little book brother Brown
[58:03] said it was called it was the bride book
[58:06] and he said go and take the little book
[58:08] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[58:10] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[58:12] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[58:15] unto him give me
[58:18] unlike its ownership give me it was open
[58:21] to somebody give me the little book and
[58:24] he said unto me take it
[58:27] I wonder if you can hear him saying that
[58:29] this morning take it and eat it up and
[58:32] it shall make thy belly bitter
[58:34] in other words in other words you're
[58:36] going to have struggles your child
[58:37] people are going to misunderstand you're
[58:39] going to be persecuted they're they're
[58:40] going to think you're speaking a foreign
[58:42] language
[58:43] it is foreign
[58:45] but it's not unknown
[58:47] right it is another language it's the
[58:49] birth from above it's a Heavenly
[58:51] language
[58:52] it's the revelation of the hour the
[58:54] message of the hour
[58:57] and take it and make thy biller bitter
[58:59] thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[59:01] mouth sweet
[59:03] as honey
[59:04] amen and I took the little book out of
[59:08] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[59:12] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[59:14] soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[59:15] bitter and he said unto me thou
[59:19] must prophesy again
[59:22] gonna ride the trail again
[59:25] she the brother Brown said would ride
[59:27] this Trail again

[1:07:12] 11 1 now Revelation which is faith faith
[1:07:16] is a revelation now Revelation is the
[1:07:19] substance
[1:07:22] it's not an imagination it's not a
[1:07:24] presumption
[1:07:26] it is actual substance now Revelation is
[1:07:31] the substance of things for and it is
[1:07:34] the evidence
[1:07:39] of Things Not Seen

[1:08:03] with the word and you recognize your
[1:08:06] presence and your position by revelation
[1:08:10] it's all about Brother David if I could
[1:08:11] you just scuff twin to figure it out and
[1:08:13] get into the book and start reading it
[1:08:15] and asking God to reveal it to you
[1:08:18] without a new birth how can you say that
[1:08:21] Jesus is Lord
[1:08:25] you can't without a new birth
[1:08:34] because he's not a was he is it is
[1:08:38] Jesus Christ is
[1:08:46] he that believeth that Jesus Christ is
[1:08:48] the Son of God is born again
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:54] all right
[1:08:57] God so we're speaking this is my subject
[1:08:59] what is it God's Great revelation
[1:09:02] brother Adam said Christ revealed in you
[1:09:05] is God's Great Revelation he said the
[1:09:09] great he said the great Revelation the
[1:09:12] great event that we're dealing with
[1:09:14] today he said is his coming that's
[1:09:16] coming to take us home in a resurrection
[1:09:20] in a rapture
[1:09:22] he said that paid paragraph 33 invisible
[1:09:26] Union
[1:09:30] amen
[1:09:31] amen it's happening
[1:09:35] but it isn't known to everybody
[1:09:38] but is that my purpose no my purpose is
[1:09:41] here to spread the light and it's up to
[1:09:43] God to reveal it
[1:09:45] it's up God to reveal it
[1:09:48] but he gives us a way to come through
[1:09:50] and that's a message of the hour and
[1:09:52] there's a filter there to draw through
[1:09:54] life which will manifest and bring to
[1:09:56] pass the manifestation of Jesus Christ
[1:09:59] in the bride form in you
[1:10:05] because it was laying there the German
[1:10:08] life with the seed would laying there

[1:14:57] the thing is so simple it goes beyond
[1:14:59] human understanding that's exactly what
[1:15:00] it is
[1:15:02] he said you're trying to make her
[1:15:03] something I'm not making myself anybody

[1:15:18] man the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:15:20] was in Jesus Christ where was his house
[1:15:26] that's that Jesus Christ Our Lord is the
[1:15:29] full is the full Masterpiece a peace was
[1:15:34] taken from him that had to be brought
[1:15:36] back to his position and kept kid until
[1:15:38] this hour that's what produces a body
[1:15:41] chain that's what brings us to a rapture
[1:15:46] Hallelujah we ought to be feeding on
[1:15:49] this message if you really realize what
[1:15:51] it meant to have this message
[1:15:53] it's the going home it's the it's the
[1:15:56] Rapture of the Bride
[1:16:01] it's the resurrection voice being voiced
[1:16:04] out of you is there a resurrection voice
[1:16:06] this little bride is the resurrection he
[1:16:10] said I am the resurrection when he said
[1:16:12] I am the resurrection Martha got a hold
[1:16:15] of the Revelation and went calling for
[1:16:17] her sister and said he's calling for you
[1:16:19] he never said her name he didn't say go
[1:16:22] Martha go call for Mary
[1:16:24] but Martha got a hold of the Revelation
[1:16:26] and went to Mary and said he call it for
[1:16:29] you who's calling for you today this
[1:16:32] morning who's calling for you the
[1:16:34] revelation of the word for the season is
[1:16:36] calling for you Jesus Christ the same

[1:16:52] it's the resurrection in life
[1:16:58] right
[1:16:59] Hallelujah
[1:17:01] and it's becoming this materializing
[1:17:04] itself
[1:17:06] in the form he said it would have to
[1:17:08] come in in the form it was like capping
[1:17:11] the capping of Hall of Creation in in
[1:17:13] Chapter 2 of Genesis under the seventh
[1:17:16] day
[1:17:22] she was the Capstone revelation

[1:17:57] when you have the Holy Ghost you're
[1:17:58] sealed but that Holy Ghost grows and it
[1:18:01] grows and what's it going to grow into
[1:18:03] the very stature of himself what is the
[1:18:06] message in our it's himself coming to
[1:18:08] himself it's word coming to word it's
[1:18:11] the word coming to the predestinated
[1:18:13] word

[1:18:22] pretty certain I'm positive of that
[1:18:25] yeah
[1:18:27] it's an unusual voice Brother David how
[1:18:29] could you how to be careful brother you
[1:18:31] know you're speaking on the internet and
[1:18:33] you know there's people going to hear
[1:18:34] that and they're going to think you're a
[1:18:36] fanatic
[1:18:39] yes
[1:18:40] what has that got to do with us
[1:18:44] when this Revelation comes that I'm
[1:18:46] United with this bridegroom
[1:18:49] what difference does it make what flesh
[1:18:52] thinks

[1:19:15] who do you have confidence in
[1:19:19] I can't explain a thing I'm saying here
[1:19:23] to you I can't do it because it's
[1:19:25] revelation
[1:19:26] but I see it personally I see it and
[1:19:29] know it's the truth and I see it working
[1:19:31] in me day after day after day after day
[1:19:34] identifying himself
[1:19:41] well you just speak too loud you're mean
[1:19:45] just what they did with Jesus you being
[1:19:47] a man make yourself God

[1:26:25] yes sir and we see the Promise now he
[1:26:27] didn't say we're going to do he said now
[1:26:29] we do
[1:26:30] now we see the Promise being fulfilled
[1:26:34] Christ
[1:26:36] the true headship
[1:26:39] is there anything higher than the
[1:26:41] headship comes right down here to a
[1:26:43] point a fine point
[1:26:47] amen comes to a fine Razor Edge
[1:26:52] of difference
[1:26:54] the difference is revelation of the word
[1:27:00] not emotion nothing else can tell the
[1:27:02] difference
[1:27:04] if it's a true Revelation it'll speak
[1:27:07] from Revelation to the Book of Genesis
[1:27:09] to Revelation it's going to be he can't
[1:27:11] change
[1:27:16] it comes down to a fine Razor Edge
[1:27:22] why why is it so close it would deceive
[1:27:25] the elective possible because both are
[1:27:27] anointed by the same water
[1:27:32] same rain
[1:27:34] same Sons on both
[1:27:39] the seed that was planted
[1:27:42] hey many many many men when you catch

[1:27:47] True Believer quick hand the word

[1:27:52] season Quicken
[1:27:54] you see your position bride

[1:28:09] yeah amen it always was you were in him
[1:28:12] always that Revelation was to be
[1:28:14] unfolded in this hour the the fullness
[1:28:17] of that Revelation was here to be
[1:28:19] revealed in this hour the seventh Angels
[1:28:22] message
[1:28:23] let us be glad and rejoice the marriage
[1:28:26] of the Lamb is come
[1:28:33] marriage certificate can't be opened
[1:28:35] only at the marriage
[1:28:40] it's a sealed it's a sealed thing until
[1:28:43] the marriage
[1:28:44] then it's unveiled to the public this is
[1:28:47] she
[1:28:48] this is he
[1:28:52] how can she come and not be he and how
[1:28:54] can he come and not be she
[1:28:59] now that's not me saying that the
[1:29:01] prophet said that
[1:29:02] the same word that speaks of the groom
[1:29:04] speaks of the Bride then how can she
[1:29:07] come on the scene and not be he and how
[1:29:10] can he come on the scene and not be she
[1:29:18] amen
[1:29:24] it's another tongue yeah sure is yeah
[1:29:27] right
[1:29:28] it is another tongue
[1:29:30] but it's not unknown
[1:29:31] because the day of Penny costs 3 000 of
[1:29:33] them
[1:29:34] heard it
[1:29:37] the other said these are men of new wine
[1:29:41] they're drunken
[1:29:43] they think they are
[1:29:46] we don't know what they're saying
[1:29:50] the 3 000 of them did and said what must
[1:29:52] we do yeah
[1:29:55] and the prescription was given
[1:30:01] amen it wasn't an unknown talk
[1:30:05] it was known
[1:30:08] and the Nations heard it
[1:30:12] every man out of Egypt in Saudi Arabia
[1:30:16] Syria and up in Asia they were all
[1:30:19] assembled right there and they heard it
[1:30:20] speak in their own language
[1:30:24] and they were moved inside of here
[1:30:26] like the little Eagle in the barnyard
[1:30:28] when that mothered eagle screams
[1:30:30] something stirred inside of him and said
[1:30:32] that sounds real
[1:30:35] the rest of them didn't have the germ
[1:30:40] but you were a germ you were bribed to
[1:30:43] begin with brother sister you were Jesus
[1:30:45] Christ the son of the Living God to
[1:30:48] begin with that's your identification
[1:30:53] and everything he was you are oh my I'm
[1:30:55] getting ahead of myself
[1:30:57] all right I'll come to that in just a
[1:30:58] minute if I can get off the first page
[1:31:01] all right now we see the Promise being
[1:31:04] fulfilled Christ's going in headship
[1:31:06] going in going in coming in David when
[1:31:09] he heard the sound of it going he
[1:31:11] couldn't do anything against those
[1:31:12] Philistine until he heard the sound of
[1:31:13] the going then he raised up and come
[1:31:16] against them
[1:31:17] but David I imagine he sweated it out
[1:31:19] those Philistines are getting closer
[1:31:21] they're assembling more and more and his
[1:31:23] reasoning said oh God has reasoning just
[1:31:26] started kind of trying to take over take
[1:31:27] over but he remembered I hear the voice
[1:31:30] I hear the voice saying don't you go
[1:31:32] until you hear the sound of a GOI
[1:31:36] I wonder if we've heard the message of
[1:31:38] the going
[1:31:42] or if you've heard the message of the
[1:31:44] going
[1:31:45] and the coming in
[1:31:47] who's coming in
[1:31:49] what Advent is this
[1:31:52] he went away
[1:31:55] enveloped in the cloud he comes returns
[1:31:57] in the cloud
[1:31:59] amen
[1:32:01] turn it to the right
[1:32:03] who do you see
[1:32:06] who's he uniting with now
[1:32:08] what form will he be in
[1:32:10] he's here
[1:32:14] he's come the Bible said he would he had
[1:32:17] come again to receive you unto himself
[1:32:18] that where I am you may be also he's
[1:32:21] brother Bram said he's come to take you
[1:32:23] and to call you bring you bring you call
[1:32:25] you personally individually out here to
[1:32:28] for a resurrection
[1:32:33] it is the resurrection for a
[1:32:34] resurrection it is the rapture for a
[1:32:37] rapture
[1:32:39] amen are you with me
[1:32:42] if you have that faith that something
[1:32:44] got to happen in the in the in the full
[1:32:46] realization of it doesn't it but first
[1:32:48] it's faith
[1:32:49] first it's substance
[1:32:53] and what does God see what does God
[1:32:55] accept what is God receiving
[1:32:57] what does God see in Abraham his faith
[1:33:00] what did man see in Abraham his works
[1:33:02] that declared his faith
[1:33:06] is that right
[1:33:07] both Abraham both
[1:33:09] Paul and James were speaking of Faith he
[1:33:13] said one the man sees the manifestation
[1:33:15] of the faith and God sees the faith
[1:33:18] so there's got to be there's got to be a
[1:33:20] dynamic on the mechanics
[1:33:23] you can't worship him except you worship
[1:33:25] Him in spirit and in truth there's going
[1:33:27] to be Dynamics and mechanics come
[1:33:29] together you say I have the word I have
[1:33:32] the word but you don't have the Dynamics
[1:33:33] well I have the Dynamics I have the
[1:33:35] Dynamics and no word
[1:33:39] until the two come together
[1:33:41] you will not see Jesus Christ the same
[1:33:43] yesterday today ever and forever in you
[1:33:50] you won't see the message of the hour
[1:33:52] because the message the hour is she it's
[1:33:55] he manifested revealed as she
[1:34:00] for the meeting
[1:34:10] see it's just come so simple it just
[1:34:12] goes right through the people
[1:34:16] does that make me anybody make you
[1:34:18] anybody if you have the river not a
[1:34:19] thing
[1:34:21] it just makes me know
[1:34:23] I'm his
[1:34:28] always was
[1:34:30] I was this eternal thought existing
[1:34:34] substance is actual existence
[1:34:38] all right so the so we see the bride
[1:34:41] coming of now we see the Promise being
[1:34:43] doing the same Works what's the bride
[1:34:45] doing now Comes The Faith from Faith to
[1:34:48] works now we now he said doing the same
[1:34:51] works that he did at the beginning
[1:34:52] making ready and fulfilling his word as
[1:34:55] he did it first in Saint John 14 12.
[1:34:58] remember they both
[1:35:00] real wheat and weed and the wild wheat
[1:35:03] both have the same Reign and the same
[1:35:05] and they both believe in signs wonders
[1:35:07] and miracles
[1:35:10] but one is the word and the other isn't
[1:35:14] and they're shouting the same time do I
[1:35:17] believe in shouting you better believe I
[1:35:19] do I'm not speaking the thing against
[1:35:20] shouting I'm just telling you it's not
[1:35:22] the evidence that you're the word
[1:35:27] because you have any of those gifts
[1:35:29] brother Brown said I wish I could tell
[1:35:30] you that those gifts is the evidence and
[1:35:33] First Corinthians 12 he said it is not
[1:35:35] the evidence it's the evidence that the
[1:35:37] holy spirit's doing those great works
[1:35:39] but it's not the evidence that you are
[1:35:41] in filled and have him in you
[1:35:48] see that's a great Revelation that had
[1:35:50] to be opened under
[1:35:56] you see what it is
[1:35:58] so don't shoot your confidence in
[1:35:59] anything else but that word
[1:36:01] in you
[1:36:02] a substance
[1:36:04] the evidence
[1:36:06] of the Rapture the substance the
[1:36:09] evidence of your body change the
[1:36:12] substance and the evidence of Christ in
[1:36:14] you personalize you and he are one you
[1:36:17] have the substance
[1:36:21] you have the evidence
[1:36:25] I didn't I I certainly love good works
[1:36:28] but your good works without faith will
[1:36:30] never get you in the rapture
[1:36:32] unless you have the revelation of this
[1:36:36] message in you living moving
[1:36:40] that's the faith of God that's the True
[1:36:43] Believer
[1:36:45] the faith of God is the Revelation which
[1:36:47] is the substance of God revealed in you
[1:36:54] that's
[1:36:55] his body his bride
[1:36:58] can't be anything but himself revealed
[1:37:00] Jesus Christ is the revelation of the
[1:37:04] word
[1:37:05] well brother Brad and brother Baptist
[1:37:07] come bro brother man we don't believe in
[1:37:09] any Revelation then you cannot believe
[1:37:10] in Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is
[1:37:14] the revelation of the word in his season
[1:37:23] sometimes I wonder if we don't have a
[1:37:24] lot of Baptists around the message
[1:37:28] they're depending on baptism Baptist
[1:37:30] theology
[1:37:34] this message did away with all those
[1:37:35] theologies
[1:37:37] this message brought Jesus Christ face
[1:37:39] to face with you personally
[1:37:45] your absolute isn't resting
[1:37:48] and what you thinking about and what
[1:37:50] others think about it and what others
[1:37:51] well they do they'll think I'm offending
[1:37:53] it if I don't be this kind and this kind
[1:37:55] you can be kind all you want I'll never
[1:37:57] put you in the Rapture and I believe in
[1:37:59] being kind
[1:38:00] Jesus was kind but there's a difference
[1:38:03] between compassion and ophelial and
[1:38:05] compassion agape
[1:38:08] there's a difference between sympathy
[1:38:09] and compassion that's another message
[1:38:12] but I'll just drop that in compassion is
[1:38:14] doing the will of God
[1:38:16] in its season
[1:38:18] and that has to be a revelation to you
[1:38:20] or you're doing it outside of faith
[1:38:23] because if you if it's not a revelation
[1:38:25] and you have no right to speak it say
[1:38:27] it's going to happen because I spoke it
[1:38:29] without Revelation it's empty
[1:38:37] the just shall live by feelings Works no
[1:38:41] the just shall live by faith
[1:38:49] right amen now he said and so his word
[1:38:54] John 14 12 he that believeth in me the
[1:38:57] works that I do shall he Dulce did you
[1:38:59] notice that he that believeth in me when
[1:39:01] did you believe in him
[1:39:02] before the foundation of the world you
[1:39:04] believed in him if you weren't in there
[1:39:06] believing in him before the world began
[1:39:07] you're not a Believer now
[1:39:11] can't be
[1:39:13] because a real believer is born again
[1:39:15] born again again means from above his
[1:39:18] birth from above
[1:39:20] the real believer is birthed from above
[1:39:25] until your birth from above
[1:39:29] The Works of God cannot be made manifest
[1:39:32] that be manifesting that faith
[1:39:35] because that faith is not your faith
[1:39:37] it's not an intellectual Faith it's the
[1:39:40] faith of God which is perfect and it's
[1:39:42] his perfect love it's his love and how
[1:39:44] how do you know you love him because he
[1:39:47] first loved you
[1:39:48] how do you know you know him because he
[1:39:50] knew you
[1:39:52] he told others I didn't know you I will
[1:39:55] like all the works we did we prophesied
[1:39:56] in your name we've done Mighty many many
[1:39:58] works in your name why they're good
[1:40:00] people I'm not talking about bad people
[1:40:01] I'm talking about good people today but
[1:40:04] because you're a good person doesn't put
[1:40:06] you in the rapture
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:09] it's got to be the revelation of God's
[1:40:11] own faith in you
[1:40:13] that identifies the rapture
[1:40:20] what raised Jesus from the dead Same
[1:40:22] Spirit
[1:40:24] if it be in you
[1:40:25] as it was in him
[1:40:27] it'll Quicken your mortal body is that
[1:40:29] right all right then in not only a
[1:40:31] Quicken your mortal body to be changed
[1:40:33] someday it's quickening you right now
[1:40:35] bringing you subject to the word and if
[1:40:37] you don't see that Spirit swinging you
[1:40:39] sub to the word you do not have the Holy
[1:40:42] Ghost
[1:40:46] you see that your your desires and your
[1:40:48] Ambitions for the things of the world
[1:40:49] and the lover of the world and the lover
[1:40:51] of material and lover of these things
[1:40:53] you don't have the love of God even in
[1:40:55] you
[1:40:58] I see you say that's hard that's not
[1:41:00] hard that's the word
[1:41:02] you read as well as I do the problem is
[1:41:04] you're not reading it the problem is
[1:41:05] you're not feeding on it the problem is
[1:41:07] you're not laying in the presence of the
[1:41:09] word of the message of the hour and
[1:41:11] feeding on it your two took up with your
[1:41:13] iPhones and your iPads and your internet
[1:41:16] and yours and your social media
[1:41:19] that's ruining you is taking you off of
[1:41:22] the word
[1:41:23] killing the influence of the word
[1:41:26] you'll put that way over the other
[1:41:28] things of the word and what it is it
[1:41:30] idolatry
[1:41:36] you think
[1:41:37] Paul said I pre-charge you
[1:41:41] if that's what you call hard wait till
[1:41:44] it gets hard
[1:41:48] you're going to wish someday you heard
[1:41:49] it hard
[1:41:54] wake up
[1:41:55] you don't sleep in this time
[1:41:58] you have a message you ought to be you
[1:42:00] ought to be every sport every moment you
[1:42:02] can to get alone with God y'all take
[1:42:04] every moment you can to be in prayer you
[1:42:06] ought to take every moment you can to be
[1:42:07] in this word
[1:42:09] I'm not saying there's good things in
[1:42:10] this thing and that thing but it's
[1:42:12] taking the people over
[1:42:14] they're being influenced through that
[1:42:16] and they're picking up on that Spirit
[1:42:19] instead of the spirit of this word
[1:42:22] you can have that letter all you want
[1:42:24] God never made us a minister of the
[1:42:26] letter he made us a minister of the
[1:42:28] spirit amen in that letter he may he
[1:42:31] gave us his own mind
[1:42:34] you must be spiritual to no spiritual
[1:42:37] things you must be spiritual by
[1:42:39] revelation of the word and mind of God
[1:42:41] in you to even see and know the
[1:42:44] supernatural
[1:42:45] to even know Jesus Christ personally
[1:42:48] you must be born from above
[1:42:55] you could have you could have the
[1:42:57] compassion
[1:42:58] and I'm not against compassion but Jesus
[1:43:01] walked through a multitude of people
[1:43:02] lame hot blind children cripples
[1:43:05] everything and went to one man had a
[1:43:07] prostate trouble
[1:43:08] and he asked his question why'd you do
[1:43:10] that because he said the son can do
[1:43:12] nothing but what the father shows him
[1:43:14] and that same that same that same
[1:43:17] compassion that same spirit that he
[1:43:19] lived by that did the will of God that
[1:43:22] same thing will be among the bride and
[1:43:23] it will be that Unity between the bride
[1:43:26] and the groom
[1:43:27] it'll be that same Harmony
[1:43:30] she will do what she does by revelation
[1:43:33] of the word that's real compassion
[1:43:39] it's not human compassion
[1:43:42] feel your love is human agape love is
[1:43:44] God
[1:43:50] not against human compassion
[1:43:52] I wish all people could be good but
[1:43:54] that's not putting you in the message
[1:43:55] that doesn't mean you're in the message
[1:43:58] that doesn't mean I'm talking about the
[1:43:59] message being Jesus Christ
[1:44:01] doesn't mean you're in him
[1:44:05] until you're born from above
[1:44:07] and this word that he is this message
[1:44:10] that he is this Revelation that he is
[1:44:12] the hour the present tense hour that he
[1:44:14] is there's always brother Brown said a
[1:44:16] present tense hour that was the hour he
[1:44:19] spoke here it was always at present
[1:44:21] tense hour
[1:44:23] do you realize what you're seeing in
[1:44:26] Bride form
[1:44:28] is his appearing
[1:44:36] he has to appear to come
[1:44:38] and he has to come or he hasn't appeared
[1:44:44] all right
[1:44:45] then the head and the body are becoming
[1:44:47] one and brother Brown said they're no
[1:44:49] longer Twain they're one
[1:44:52] before the resurrection he said they are
[1:44:56] one
[1:44:57] okay let's go back here to this let me
[1:44:59] continue right here he said the marriage
[1:45:01] I said the bride coming of Christ that's
[1:45:03] the second Advent acts 1 11 culminates
[1:45:06] with the meeting in the air
[1:45:10] amen well people always put the second
[1:45:13] coming is only that meeting in the air
[1:45:15] oh brother
[1:45:17] unless you see that Union you'll never
[1:45:20] meet him in the air
[1:45:22] it's got to be he here or you can't lay
[1:45:24] in his presence
[1:45:26] it's got to be he that's come or you
[1:45:28] can't lay in his presence
[1:45:32] there's got to be a marriage an
[1:45:33] invisible Union you just don't go in
[1:45:35] there by yourself you're going to meet
[1:45:36] him it's him
[1:45:41] and the message the opening of the seals
[1:45:43] the opening of the seventh seal was the
[1:45:44] unveiling of himself
[1:45:46] to you bride
[1:45:50] you seem like no other woman can seem
[1:45:56] amen he's unveiled himself and you come
[1:45:59] to yourself
[1:46:01] why
[1:46:03] that's me
[1:46:07] the unveiling himself we look into that
[1:46:09] mirror of the message of the hour and
[1:46:12] what do you see you see his glory which
[1:46:14] is his bride
[1:46:15] which is himself
[1:46:17] he does not share his glory with another
[1:46:23] he can't Sherry Glory will not share his
[1:46:25] glory with another
[1:46:28] but you're not another scripture makes
[1:46:30] it very clear
[1:46:31] the same word that speaks of the groom
[1:46:33] speaks for the bride is the bride same
[1:46:36] word
[1:46:42] you're not another
[1:46:43] in fact the Bible said in Isaiah 60 thy
[1:46:45] light has come Rises I let it come in
[1:46:47] the glory the Lord is risen upon thee
[1:46:51] so you must be a part of him
[1:46:56] all right now let's look at this the
[1:46:58] marriage of the Lamb is come
[1:47:03] you must come through your real
[1:47:05] Pentecostal blessing but there's
[1:47:06] something beyond that
[1:47:09] is what I'm trying to get across to you
[1:47:11] today
[1:47:13] brother Brandon made it very clear we
[1:47:15] are not preaching the Pentecostal
[1:47:17] message
[1:47:19] he said we're in the bride age and this
[1:47:21] is the raptured age
[1:47:23] he said we've gone beyond that he didn't
[1:47:25] say we don't go through that if you
[1:47:26] don't come through that there will never
[1:47:28] be a bride age for you
[1:47:30] the corner had to be turned
[1:47:34] and you can't get the home unless you
[1:47:37] pass third base
[1:47:42] you can't stop at third and say I got it
[1:47:44] all you need to go round third and make
[1:47:46] the corner
[1:47:47] now you're on your way home
[1:47:52] amen amen
[1:47:55] there was justification sanctification
[1:47:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way
[1:48:00] for
[1:48:02] the Holy Ghost himself to come right
[1:48:05] down in Perfection back to the word
[1:48:09] again
[1:48:11] what's your position the word again
[1:48:18] the mystery of Christ revealed now you
[1:48:22] may be sitting right here disagreeing
[1:48:23] with me that's all right I'm not
[1:48:24] responsible whether you disagree with me
[1:48:26] or not
[1:48:29] I'm not looking at your reactions God
[1:48:31] will reveal his word to whom he will
[1:48:33] it's not my reactions I am commissioned
[1:48:36] by God to preach the message for the
[1:48:38] season
[1:48:41] right and I got to preach it in the way
[1:48:42] God gives it to me to preach you may not
[1:48:44] like it I may not like it very well but
[1:48:47] he does it
[1:48:48] I say I David
[1:48:50] and I David doesn't like much of
[1:48:52] anything he does
[1:48:55] that's my flesh man
[1:48:58] but that enemy is defeated
[1:49:00] by the opened word
[1:49:02] he took the seals off of my life
[1:49:10] and I see that I was in him before the
[1:49:12] foundation of the world existing
[1:49:15] in his thinking what is it that comes
[1:49:18] predestinated eternally from God the
[1:49:21] thought
[1:49:23] it being expressed is word so it's the
[1:49:27] thought or the seed that comes
[1:49:29] predestinated
[1:49:31] eternally from God
[1:49:33] wasn't Jacob
[1:49:35] Jacob was a seed is that right but Jacob
[1:49:39] was a shyster outwardly but what about
[1:49:41] the inside of him
[1:49:44] Esau was a better moral man
[1:49:47] Kinder man gentler man fed his daddy did
[1:49:51] Greater Works
[1:49:52] but he had no desire for the birthright
[1:49:54] he had no desire for the new birth
[1:49:59] he couldn't just as as as Judas could
[1:50:03] not come up to Pentecost to receive the
[1:50:06] Holy Ghost
[1:50:08] because if he did he'd had to come
[1:50:09] through the blood and Satan can't come
[1:50:11] through the blood and if he did he would
[1:50:13] be one of us he'd be my brother born
[1:50:15] from above
[1:50:20] and Peter started right there and said
[1:50:22] now
[1:50:23] take Faith and add virtue
[1:50:25] virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance
[1:50:28] tempered godliness patience patience
[1:50:31] godliness godliness brotherly love
[1:50:34] what are you growing into
[1:50:39] sealed by God you're going into an
[1:50:40] adoption a perfect placing and you've
[1:50:43] already received the spirit for that
[1:50:45] adoption the Bible said you have
[1:50:47] received the spirit of adoption
[1:50:52] amen
[1:50:53] and that spirit's got to take you right
[1:50:55] into Capstone material and that's why
[1:50:58] the message came to show you
[1:51:02] you are one with him the Capstone The
[1:51:05] Headstone
[1:51:08] this is who you are
[1:51:14] all right now the marriage of the Lamb
[1:51:17] has come it's an invisible Union amen
[1:51:20] we're really
[1:51:22] where were they that were ready
[1:51:25] had the Holy Ghost born again they that
[1:51:27] were ready
[1:51:29] they started really ex ready in the word
[1:51:32] getting ready in the word and they were
[1:51:33] ready went in with him to the marriage
[1:51:35] and when the last one come in the door
[1:51:38] was shut
[1:51:43] all right
[1:51:45] all right and brother Branham now I'm
[1:51:47] going to bring you a quote here I'm
[1:51:48] going to bring it to you what he said he
[1:51:50] said he said this invisible Union is a
[1:51:52] secret known only to the bride his wife
[1:51:54] his it's which is his wife is happening
[1:51:58] now we are in the bride's Revival which
[1:52:00] is seed time
[1:52:02] time of life it's a bride Revival he
[1:52:06] said the bride age
[1:52:07] bride time it's bride time it's bride
[1:52:10] age he said it's seed Time Is Here
[1:52:13] he said life
[1:52:17] I've got that quote here but I'll just
[1:52:18] say it life
[1:52:20] is back in the grain again
[1:52:25] What followed
[1:52:27] the Pentecostal experience the ripening
[1:52:30] of the Grain and it had to leave the
[1:52:33] shook
[1:52:34] because the shock denominational pain
[1:52:37] I'm not talking about denominational
[1:52:38] Pentecost but denominational Pentecost
[1:52:40] went to shuck
[1:52:42] amen and the life moved right out of it
[1:52:45] the same Pentecostal experience brother
[1:52:47] Ram said that same Pentecostal baptism
[1:52:49] of the Holy Ghost started without an
[1:52:51] ending but the point that people will
[1:52:52] get is it grows
[1:52:55] where's it girly it took a message to
[1:52:57] bring it to maturity
[1:52:59] it took a message beyond the Pentecost
[1:53:01] to bring what was birthed to maternity
[1:53:08] that's why the seals were open that's
[1:53:10] why God kept it shut
[1:53:11] until
[1:53:14] the message of the seventh angel which
[1:53:16] was Revelations 10 which was the seventh
[1:53:18] seal
[1:53:21] and brother man said the Revelation in
[1:53:23] the seventh seal is the mystery of his
[1:53:26] coming it's the revelation of his coming
[1:53:31] and he said that secret which was a
[1:53:32] secret wasn't a public show this Union
[1:53:35] is not a public show it's you as an
[1:53:37] individual I want that to stick home
[1:53:41] you could be one out of a family but
[1:53:43] it's you as an individual one out of a
[1:53:45] church
[1:53:49] but what do you have to feed upon the
[1:53:52] word for the season and how you're going
[1:53:53] to know the word for the season unless
[1:53:55] you're born again you'll never know the
[1:53:57] word for the season
[1:54:02] are you see see you say Brother David
[1:54:05] you're just making it too complicated
[1:54:07] really
[1:54:08] I think it's pretty simple
[1:54:13] all right now so we see the Promise
[1:54:15] being fulfilled then the head and the
[1:54:17] body are becoming one
[1:54:20] are becoming one
[1:54:22] in Works yes which is Faith Express and
[1:54:27] in sign and in life Vindicated by God
[1:54:31] himself through his promise word for the
[1:54:35] last days
[1:54:37] he promised this in the last days now he
[1:54:41] just got done telling you what the
[1:54:42] promise was she's come on the scene all
[1:54:45] right who's she he
[1:54:47] who's she he
[1:54:51] all right come on the scene in the last
[1:54:53] days he said now if you're spiritual
[1:54:56] you'll catch it
[1:55:00] First Corinthians
[1:55:04] and see I'm not going to get through
[1:55:05] this so I just helped me maybe Lord
[1:55:07] willing make it a part two
[1:55:10] okay because I started a little late
[1:55:11] here so I'm gonna I'm watching my time
[1:55:14] First Corinthians
[1:55:16] chapter 2.
[1:55:19] and verse 14 verse 13.
[1:55:22] which things we speak not in The Words
[1:55:24] which man's Wisdom teacheth but what the
[1:55:27] Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual
[1:55:29] things was spiritual but the natural man
[1:55:31] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:55:33] of God that's why you can't look at
[1:55:34] their flesh
[1:55:36] no confidence in it but the natural man
[1:55:39] receiveth not the spirit of God for they
[1:55:41] are foolishness unto him neither can he
[1:55:43] know them because they are spiritually
[1:55:47] discerned
[1:55:49] all right
[1:55:51] but he that is spiritual Oh you mean
[1:55:54] somebody you mean who are we talking
[1:55:56] about here Christ the bride
[1:55:59] Christ
[1:56:01] the bride
[1:56:02] until she be taken out of the way he who
[1:56:05] letteth will let
[1:56:09] all right you know the quote I'm at
[1:56:11] there
[1:56:12] back in Thessalonians he who letteth
[1:56:14] will let him till he be taken out of the
[1:56:16] way he's letting that Antichrist Spirit
[1:56:18] go out here running among the people
[1:56:20] rampant not in realizing what's
[1:56:22] happening and he who letteth will let
[1:56:23] until he Christ the bride that's exact
[1:56:27] words until he Christ the bride is taken
[1:56:30] out of the way
[1:56:35] all right what's where well what's
[1:56:37] happening what's happening she's going
[1:56:38] right off in a rapture
[1:56:40] it's only for her only
[1:56:44] you better not presume
[1:56:50] you can't presume this
[1:56:53] all right now but he that is spiritual
[1:56:56] judgeth all things desert that judging
[1:56:59] is discerning
[1:57:01] yet he himself is judged
[1:57:03] of no man
[1:57:05] the man can't judge it
[1:57:07] amen are you with me all right then for
[1:57:10] who hath known the mind of the Lord that
[1:57:13] he may instruct him but we have the mind
[1:57:15] of Christ
[1:57:18] there it is who's we
[1:57:21] how do you know
[1:57:23] you're identified
[1:57:27] the day is the day of identification
[1:57:30] okay
[1:57:31] only known to the wife is happening now
[1:57:33] it's seed time
[1:57:35] proving his word 1964 and Jesus said as
[1:57:38] it was in the days of Sodom now watch
[1:57:40] close in the days of Sodom so it will be
[1:57:43] the coming of the son of man when the
[1:57:45] son of man is being revealed not no more
[1:57:48] church as a church no not no more the
[1:57:50] bride is called see he is in that day
[1:57:53] the son of man will be revealed what to
[1:57:56] join the the bride or church to the Head
[1:57:59] unite the marriage of the Bride
[1:58:04] okay
[1:58:06] what's the message to do unite the bride
[1:58:09] to the Head unite the marriage of the
[1:58:13] Bride
[1:58:14] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:58:16] through this
[1:58:17] this what's this when the son of man
[1:58:20] will come down and come in human flesh
[1:58:22] to unite the two together when the son
[1:58:24] of man Jesus Christ will come down and
[1:58:27] come in human flesh to unite the two
[1:58:29] together the church has to be the word
[1:58:33] he is the word and the two unites
[1:58:36] together and to do that it'll take the
[1:58:38] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:58:40] son of man
[1:58:42] to do that it will take the
[1:58:44] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:58:46] son of man like it was to Sarah and
[1:58:49] Abraham
[1:58:51] I put that in there
[1:58:54] Jesus Christ not another Jesus Christ
[1:58:57] will come down in human flesh among us
[1:58:59] today and will make his word so real
[1:59:02] that it will unite the church the bride
[1:59:06] and him as one
[1:59:08] and then she and then she'll and then
[1:59:11] she'll go home to the wedding supper
[1:59:17] blessed are those that are called to the
[1:59:20] wedding supper
[1:59:23] you know the wedding suppers part of the
[1:59:25] marriage
[1:59:26] but the wedding supper is until after
[1:59:29] at the rapture
[1:59:31] three and a half years
[1:59:33] but the marriage is before that
[1:59:37] okay listen and he said he said I just
[1:59:41] see what I mean it's the son of man
[1:59:43] Jesus Christ not it's a revealing of the
[1:59:45] son of man not a clergyman see do you
[1:59:47] see what I mean it's the son of man
[1:59:49] Jesus Christ will come down in human
[1:59:51] flesh Among Us make his sword so real
[1:59:53] that it'll unite the bride in him as one
[1:59:56] then we'll go to the wedding supper amen
[1:59:58] she's already United when she goes to
[2:00:00] the wedding supper
[2:00:01] it's what she says right she's already
[2:00:03] United see he said we go to the wedding
[2:00:06] supper not the marriage
[2:00:10] we go to the wedding supper not the
[2:00:13] marriage
[2:00:15] fill yourself
[2:00:17] go referring to a scripture he said he
[2:00:20] said come the marriage suppers at hand
[2:00:23] fill yourself all the Flesh of Mighty
[2:00:25] Men He said why because the marriage of
[2:00:27] the Lamb has come but the Rapture is
[2:00:30] going to the wedding supper
[2:00:34] now you're not going to have a marriage
[2:00:36] without a celebration of a marriage
[2:00:38] and that's the wedding supper but first
[2:00:41] it's a union right
[2:00:45] right unless that faith of the real
[2:00:47] believer is inside of you the faith of
[2:00:49] God you won't go
[2:00:53] okay I want to I want to jump ahead here
[2:00:55] and I'm going to have to close
[2:00:58] paid number 64 of perfect faith I can do
[2:01:02] nothing of myself why he relied upon
[2:01:05] what he was
[2:01:09] amen
[2:01:10] see at this marriage this Union is where
[2:01:13] the two become one and then what does it
[2:01:15] do then it what does that Union do it
[2:01:18] manifests the son of man again
[2:01:21] what is the bride's position the
[2:01:23] manifestation of the son of man again
[2:01:25] this is her day that was not her day
[2:01:28] back there this is her day here
[2:01:33] that's exactly right
[2:01:35] I got the quote on that if you want it
[2:01:36] amen it's not yeah right here she's got
[2:01:40] to be the word not the word for his day
[2:01:43] she's the word of this day that he
[2:01:46] promised would be here in this do you
[2:01:49] see that you're the promise do you see
[2:01:52] that you're fulfilling scripture
[2:01:56] that ought to set your soul of fire that
[2:01:59] ought to set you beyond the point of of
[2:02:01] why why you have the fear
[2:02:04] it's identified you're identified you're
[2:02:07] identified in Christ if Christ fails you
[2:02:10] fail
[2:02:11] but you can't fail because you're in the
[2:02:13] unfailing one and there's no sin hell
[2:02:15] against you there is no failure you're
[2:02:17] sinless he that's born of God does not
[2:02:20] commit sin there is therefore now no
[2:02:23] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[2:02:25] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[2:02:27] after the spirit
[2:02:30] and the spirit of Life hath made me free
[2:02:33] from the law of sin and death
[2:02:37] you're no more serving law works
[2:02:40] you're serving God in his faith amen
[2:02:44] The Works were finished
[2:02:47] the law was fulfilled at Calvary
[2:02:50] now he comes forth to take the book that
[2:02:53] he redeemed and the lion roars out
[2:02:55] calling for his Queen to come sit with
[2:02:58] him by his side in his throne
[2:03:06] she's anointed such to be his Queen
[2:03:10] I'm not saying there's going to be more
[2:03:12] open to her in the Millennium we have to
[2:03:14] learn how to rule but we've got
[2:03:16] character on this side we're developing
[2:03:18] character fit to rule but we also rule
[2:03:21] on this side
[2:03:22] did you know that you rule over your own
[2:03:24] flesh
[2:03:26] you learn to rule over that taking every
[2:03:28] thought over your own thoughts taking
[2:03:30] every thought under obedience to Christ
[2:03:34] bring it subject to the word
[2:03:37] why you go through the struggle why is
[2:03:39] it bitter because your learning
[2:03:40] character fit to rule you've got to have
[2:03:42] the character and he will you will have
[2:03:45] the character you are already in him and
[2:03:47] his character is being developed
[2:03:51] but it takes a union to do it
[2:03:53] amen pouring in of himself
[2:03:57] she's carrying the Sun
[2:03:59] for the meeting
[2:04:02] I tell you
[2:04:05] it's the same word Same Spirit
[2:04:08] same word same Revelation Same Spirit in
[2:04:11] you it was the same spirit in him Same
[2:04:14] Spirit in him is the Same Spirit in you
[2:04:16] Same Spirit and Eve Was the Same Spirit
[2:04:18] of Adam
[2:04:21] all right
[2:04:22] now so we see the marriage suppers at
[2:04:24] hand remember
[2:04:26] the marriage suppers at Hammond and and
[2:04:29] they said the kingdom according to the
[2:04:30] promises ready to be issued in the great
[2:04:33] Millennium what's next what's his third
[2:04:35] coming after the wedding supper we
[2:04:37] return right back to the Millennium
[2:04:39] Bride and bridegroom right back to it
[2:04:41] was it was in Eden we pick up right
[2:04:43] there and for a thousand years
[2:04:45] set this Earth in its order
[2:04:48] amen are you with me what for a body
[2:04:52] change the Earth's body change the earth
[2:04:54] body change
[2:04:56] because we're going to have a new
[2:04:57] heavens and a new Earth
[2:04:59] but it's got to be cleansed first and
[2:05:02] you had to be cleansed for him to come
[2:05:03] in and live his life through you you had
[2:05:06] to be washed and you have to be washed
[2:05:08] every day washed and if you want to
[2:05:09] follow him then you're going to have to
[2:05:11] take up your cross deny yourself die to
[2:05:14] yourself die to your reasoning quit
[2:05:17] trying to quit trying to depend on I'll
[2:05:19] just say it myself I've quit trying to
[2:05:21] depend on David for anything
[2:05:23] it's not David that works in me it's
[2:05:25] Christ that works in you both to Will
[2:05:27] and to do of his good pleasure
[2:05:30] and his ways are perfect and because
[2:05:32] you're in him he made your way perfect
[2:05:34] now watch I'm closing now watch he said
[2:05:38] I can do nothing of myself he relied
[2:05:40] upon what he was the word knowing he
[2:05:43] relied upon knowing that he was the word
[2:05:47] he had faith in God who made him the
[2:05:51] word
[2:05:52] he was God the word and they was in him
[2:05:55] that give him Faith because he
[2:05:57] understood his position
[2:05:59] let me tell you that position is a
[2:06:01] positive position and that positive

[2:06:45] abide in him to begin with without the
[2:06:47] germ if my word of if you abide in me
[2:06:49] and my word abides in you

[2:06:54] just catch a revelation that you're a
[2:06:56] Believer rely upon what God made you as
[2:07:00] a believer
[2:07:01] the believer is the faith of God the
[2:07:04] believer is the faith of God rely upon
[2:07:06] that substance of what God said about
[2:07:08] you you were in his thinking you can't
[2:07:10] be taken out of his thinking you take
[2:07:12] out of his thinking God is no more
[2:07:14] complete
[2:07:15] he's not complete without you
[2:07:22] he understood his position
[2:07:24] that give him Faith because he
[2:07:26] understood he knew he was the word and
[2:07:28] that word was in him and that gave him
[2:07:30] Faith are you realizing what I just said
[2:07:32] John 15 7. he said in that word God he
[2:07:36] was the word
[2:07:37] God made him the word he was the word
[2:07:39] and they was in that word was in him and
[2:07:42] that gave him Faith because he
[2:07:43] understood his position he knowed what
[2:07:45] he was because the scripture said he was
[2:07:47] this
[2:07:49] does not the same scripture say you are
[2:07:51] this the same scripture that spoke of
[2:07:53] the group speaks of the Bride do you not
[2:07:55] realize brother sister
[2:07:58] if I could open their eyes I would
[2:08:03] but I don't have to
[2:08:05] God's already ordained whose eyes would
[2:08:06] be open
[2:08:08] amen all right
[2:08:11] therefore pay if you have 65 perfect
[2:08:13] Faith therefore he relied upon what God
[2:08:16] had made him
[2:08:19] and if he did that can't we rely upon
[2:08:21] what God made us as believers
[2:08:28] does that stand quoting again
[2:08:32] and if he did that can't we rely rely
[2:08:34] upon what God made us as Believers these
[2:08:38] signs shall follow them that believe he
[2:08:40] had faith in what he was
[2:08:43] do you realize what he's saying if he
[2:08:45] that believeth in me the works that I do
[2:08:48] if you really believe in him he's living
[2:08:50] him in you he didn't say the works you
[2:08:53] do he said that you'll do the works I do
[2:08:55] I will do he worketh hitherto and you
[2:08:59] work and without that Faith you can't
[2:09:01] work
[2:09:04] right he that believeth in me the works
[2:09:07] that I do I do he's there in you doing
[2:09:09] it he has to be the one doing it because
[2:09:12] you me as David can't do any of those
[2:09:14] works
[2:09:15] so it's him and me doing it right
[2:09:18] right why do you leave all the 2000 and
[2:09:21] go to one because I can't do anything
[2:09:22] until the father shows me my father
[2:09:25] worketh hitherto it means my father
[2:09:27] works at this moment he showed me what
[2:09:29] to do he's revealed it to me and I by
[2:09:31] confession a compassion go about to do
[2:09:34] what he Wills
[2:09:38] did the natural man misunderstood it
[2:09:40] yeah they did
[2:09:42] yeah he said have lift up he was God he
[2:09:44] was the god of Eternity Creator he
[2:09:46] should have healed every one of them and
[2:09:47] he could have said all be well but he
[2:09:49] didn't do it he became a man
[2:09:52] and he was subject to the word that was
[2:09:55] in him
[2:09:55] and so were we the same Harmony
[2:09:58] because we have the same Revelation
[2:10:00] unveiled in you and I it is that
[2:10:03] substance
[2:10:04] in him
[2:10:06] he is that substance all right now
[2:10:11] she's got to be the word the this bride
[2:10:13] is the virgin-born word of God
[2:10:14] manifested Jesus Christ the same
[2:10:16] yesterday today and forever I'll read it
[2:10:18] again who is this virgin word bride who
[2:10:21] is this virgin-born bride she is Jesus
[2:10:23] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:10:26] forever take that on internet

[2:10:44] when they want to put a gun that you
[2:10:45] said and denounce what you just said or
[2:10:47] we'll just shoot you you're you're a
[2:10:48] hindrance to society
[2:10:52] if it's a real Revelation you'll stand
[2:10:54] if it isn't you'll Bend
[2:10:59] if you're only pursuing that it's right
[2:11:03] it's not going to hold out you only have
[2:11:05] an intellectual conception you see what
[2:11:07] we ought to be praying for and
[2:11:08] Revelation cannot be overemphasized you
[2:11:10] ought to be asking for Revelation every
[2:11:12] day of your life

[2:11:16] his thoughts
[2:11:20] amen all right I'm going to get this

[2:11:25] more all right

[2:11:50] hearing his voice become aware of our
[2:11:52] father calling us amen what is the
[2:11:54] evidence brother Branham goes back the
[2:11:55] evidence it's nothing else but the
[2:11:57] revealing of the word in you
[2:11:59] I can show it to you right here he says
[2:12:01] what the genuine evidence is
[2:12:05] it was a thought that became expressed

[2:12:17] between Cain and Abel both religious
[2:12:19] both built the church both were trained
[2:12:21] in the worship God what made the
[2:12:22] difference
[2:12:23] revelation
[2:12:25] Abel had Revelation why because he was a
[2:12:29] different seed
[2:12:30] he was the seed of God
[2:12:34] he understood what God wanted yeah
[2:12:37] what the sacrifice meant he got the
[2:12:39] Revelation that it was not fruit

[2:12:59] book I didn't get to that but the word
[2:13:01] hidden in the book amen had to be
[2:13:04] unveiled
[2:13:07] she was the word in the book
[2:13:11] page two he says
[2:13:14] the only thing was he was eternal amen
[2:13:18] look to show you to show look to show
[2:13:21] it's the ones that he thought of his
[2:13:24] thoughts is the Christian of today

[2:13:30] the world he came as a redeemer to
[2:13:32] redeem anything bring it back bring it
[2:13:34] back it was God's thought of you
[2:13:36] little you little me no one else a word
[2:13:39] world can take my place nobody can take

[2:14:00] and God for
[2:14:02] if you've got eternal life he said and
[2:14:04] that's God for you as in the thought of
[2:14:06] from the Eternal and now it's expressed
[2:14:08] in a human being in your body for his
[2:14:10] glory we have this we have this
[2:14:14] treasure in Earthen vessels
[2:14:17] okay
[2:14:20] and we were his thoughts of God then
[2:14:23] expressed in flesh there had to come a
[2:14:25] day when we would hear his voice and
[2:14:27] hearing his voice become aware of our
[2:14:29] father calling us and recognizing we are
[2:14:32] the sons of God that ability to hear
[2:14:35] that word is the evidence that your
[2:14:37] bride that you is living in you
[2:14:43] all right and I'm not talking about I'm
[2:14:46] talking about you growing again

[2:14:53] just read it amen now
[2:14:58] you will receive the word for your day
[2:14:59] and age see how clear the true evidence
[2:15:01] becomes when the word is revealed to you
[2:15:04] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who
[2:15:05] can believe the word you can receive it
[2:15:10] he will show you things to come he will
[2:15:12] reveal you to these things that is to
[2:15:14] come and there is the genuine evidence
[2:15:17] of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:19] amen the spirit would re he said the
[2:15:22] evidence of the spirit with those who
[2:15:24] could receive the word neither love nor
[2:15:26] speaking in tongues it's receiving the
[2:15:28] word
[2:15:29] amen
[2:15:31] he will reveal these things to you that
[2:15:33] I've taught you and will show you things
[2:15:34] to come he said so there is the genuine
[2:15:37] evidence of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:40] amen
[2:15:43] she's got to be born of the same
[2:15:44] material the word made flesh because she
[2:15:47] is the female Tree of Life hope you get
[2:15:50] it it's the same life in this female
[2:15:52] tree
[2:15:53] amen
[2:15:55] all right
[2:15:58] so none will be picked up but them which
[2:16:01] was in his thoughts at the beginning
[2:16:02] that's what he come to redeem not the
[2:16:05] cannon fodder we see around professing
[2:16:07] to be Christians but that he came to
[2:16:09] redeem that which was in God's thinking
[2:16:12] at the beginning that's what he come to
[2:16:16] redeem
[2:16:17] amen do you love him stand with me
[2:16:20] God bless you
[2:16:23] there's a lot more I could go with here
[2:16:25] a lot more
[2:16:27] but I think we're catching the message
[2:16:30] I do want to leave two scriptures with
[2:16:32] you
[2:16:32] before we close Ephesians chapter 5 I
[2:16:35] wish you'd turn that with me
[2:16:39] Ephesians chapter 5
[2:16:41] and we'll start with verse 25 husbands
[2:16:44] love your wives even as Christ also
[2:16:47] loved the church watch and gave himself
[2:16:52] for it
[2:16:54] so that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[2:16:57] what's he speaking of here he's speaking
[2:16:59] typing he's typing what he's talking
[2:17:01] about and Paul says I'm showing you a
[2:17:03] mystery I'm showing you the Bride In
[2:17:05] Christ but I'm going to show you also
[2:17:08] that the husband and wife in the natural
[2:17:10] are typing or a shadow of this
[2:17:13] relationship okay but what I want you to
[2:17:16] keep the spiritual in mind here he said
[2:17:19] so he gave himself for it that he might
[2:17:22] sanctify it how does he do it with the
[2:17:24] washing of the Water by his word
[2:17:27] all right that he might present it to
[2:17:29] himself watch this he might present it
[2:17:31] to who
[2:17:32] himself
[2:17:34] as a glory as a glorious church not
[2:17:37] having any spot or wrinkle or any such
[2:17:40] thing how can there be spot or Wrinkle
[2:17:42] In the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[2:17:44] you
[2:17:45] or any such thing but what is happening
[2:17:47] it's the revealing of this you're coming
[2:17:50] closer and closer and closer in Union in
[2:17:53] Union until it's no different
[2:17:57] you and he are one
[2:17:59] you've entered to that headstone
[2:18:01] you recognize your position as the
[2:18:03] revealing of himself The Headstone
[2:18:06] The Headstone had to come in Bride form
[2:18:12] all right all right the full
[2:18:15] manifestation of himself had to come
[2:18:16] into bride form
[2:18:19] and what are we looking for the change
[2:18:21] of our body what's it going to take this
[2:18:23] adoption
[2:18:26] but we've already received the spirit of
[2:18:29] adoption so he said here then can't you
[2:18:32] have confidence in and what God Made You
[2:18:34] To Me
[2:18:35] just keep feeding on the open book
[2:18:39] will it not take you to what he said
[2:18:43] are you really interested are you just
[2:18:46] playing Church
[2:18:48] are we really interested are we just
[2:18:50] coming for a social time are we really
[2:18:53] interested
[2:18:55] in going home are you really interested
[2:18:58] in Christ are you really interested in
[2:19:00] being one with him are you really
[2:19:02] interested in that
[2:19:05] are you not only interested is it your
[2:19:07] hearts
[2:19:08] draw and purpose then God's given you a
[2:19:12] message to draw through
[2:19:15] and you can't draw anything through
[2:19:17] there but what is according and the will
[2:19:19] of God
[2:19:20] and according to his word you can't draw
[2:19:22] anything through that but it's the Holy
[2:19:24] Spirit
[2:19:31] so it all determines what's the drawing
[2:19:33] and the desire of the Soul
[2:19:37] amen all right so and he might present
[2:19:40] it to himself a glorious Church Without
[2:19:43] spot the blemish verse 28 so ought men
[2:19:45] to love their wives as their own
[2:19:51] bodies so who so what who's what's your
[2:19:56] body owned by
[2:19:58] is it not his body yes
[2:20:03] now
[2:20:04] then he'll change it
[2:20:07] is that right
[2:20:08] it's his body do you not know you're his
[2:20:11] house
[2:20:12] what's your Dwelling Place
[2:20:14] not this
[2:20:15] oh yeah we're in here
[2:20:18] but Christ is my Dwelling Place
[2:20:23] this is his house
[2:20:25] he said he would make it a habitation
[2:20:28] by the cleansing power of the blood he
[2:20:30] himself would come in you and live his
[2:20:31] life through it is that right and bring
[2:20:34] it subject to the word as we've already
[2:20:36] spoke of this morning
[2:20:38] all right now so so
[2:20:41] ottman to love their wives or ought God
[2:20:43] to love his wife is his own body he that
[2:20:45] loveth his wife loveth himself
[2:20:49] and no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[2:20:52] but nourisheth and cherisheth it how
[2:20:54] about God over you even as the Lord the
[2:20:56] church
[2:20:58] it's not up to you to keep the wolf Away
[2:21:00] by the way it's up to the shepherd not
[2:21:02] you
[2:21:03] I can't keep the wolf David can't keep
[2:21:05] that wolf away but David's Faith keeps
[2:21:08] the wolf away
[2:21:11] is that right which is Christ in me then
[2:21:14] can I rely upon what he made me as a
[2:21:17] genuine believer which is the faith of
[2:21:19] God can I not rely upon that substance
[2:21:22] that's revealed in me can it fail no can
[2:21:26] it pass away no
[2:21:30] have I been Justified yes
[2:21:34] I never did this in the first place I
[2:21:37] was married to him to begin with
[2:21:39] that old man is dead and it's eternally
[2:21:41] separated from me
[2:21:42] I'm not living by that old man anymore
[2:21:47] Hallelujah
[2:21:49] I'm living under the new ministry the
[2:21:50] new message
[2:21:52] the third poll the opening of the seals
[2:21:54] the revealing of the word the opening of
[2:21:56] the word I am the opening of the word

[2:22:09] father mother shall be joined unto his
[2:22:11] wife
[2:22:12] no it's verse 30. I'm sorry
[2:22:14] for we are members of his body of his
[2:22:18] flesh of his bones

[2:22:24] members of his body of his flesh of his
[2:22:27] bones for this cause still a man lead
[2:22:29] father and mother and shall be joined
[2:22:31] unto his wife why because the wife is
[2:22:33] the flesh the bones

[2:26:00] II Peter
[2:26:02] these precious promises we become
[2:26:04] partakers of his self
[2:26:06] I'm just paraphrasing you can go back
[2:26:08] and read it all right then then he said
[2:26:10] the same word sucked up through these
[2:26:13] through these
[2:26:15] and come out and come through these

[2:26:22] Head yeah The Headstone Ministry so as
[2:26:25] an individual
[2:26:27] okay all right without us it can't be
[2:26:29] made perfect
[2:26:31] so here he said the same word sucked up
[2:26:33] through these and come out here and come
[2:26:35] to a head here
[2:26:38] and all that life that come through
[2:26:39] there picked up its people now it's
[2:26:42] forming up into a head
[2:26:44] now it's forming up into a head for the
[2:26:48] Rapture let me just say this we have a
[2:26:51] seven-fold feast
[2:26:53] amen is that right certainly we do the
[2:26:56] message of the hour Was A Feast for the

[2:27:02] A Feast for his for his bride bridegroom
[2:27:04] made a feast we put that as a wedding
[2:27:06] supper but notice it doesn't come until
[2:27:08] after the Rapture so there's a marriage
[2:27:11] Feast going on and I'm preaching it to
[2:27:13] you this morning the open book it's a
[2:27:15] marriage Feast but somebody tried to get
[2:27:18] in not wearing a garment right
[2:27:20] he tried to get into that Rapture he
[2:27:23] tried not the Rapture because he
[2:27:24] wouldn't be in the rapture
[2:27:28] did you catch it he wouldn't be in the
[2:27:30] rapture
[2:27:33] right he couldn't come with the wrong
[2:27:34] garment on and be in the rapture
[2:27:36] so there's a feast going on right now he
[2:27:39] tried to get in another way except
[2:27:40] through the door
[2:27:42] he wasn't ready to go into marriage so
[2:27:44] what are you doing here you didn't come
[2:27:46] through the door and he was put out and
[2:27:48] cast out into outer darkness which is
[2:27:50] tribulation
[2:27:51] that isn't after the Rapture that's now
[2:27:58] we want to put that as a as a wedding
[2:27:59] supper it's not the wedding supper yet
