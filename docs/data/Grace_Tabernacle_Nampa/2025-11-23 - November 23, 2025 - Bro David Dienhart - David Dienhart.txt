Brother Trevor, I have been re I just been Psalms 139 has been on my heart so much lately. And that last comment you made, it's getting so dark.

Sorry, I didn't write the number down. We all know it though. &gt;&gt; Okay. More of you. More of you. I've had it all. But what I need is more of you. Of things I've had my fill.

I believe that's the desire of all our hearts this evening. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. As we ask our brother David to come, I'd like to sing that little song. L the chorus here. Hello here. How we long to worship you. Hello. Hello. How we long to worship you. Lord, we come to you in worship. No matter what the circumstance, no matter what the situation, we will lift up holy hands. Hello. Elohim, how we long to worship you. Hello. Elohim. How we long to worship you, Lord. We come to you in worship. No matter what the circumstance, no matter what the situation, we will lift up holy hands. Elheim, how we long to worship you. Elohheim, how we long to worship you. We long to worship you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I commit every angel to you now according to your will. this congregation into your hands. My salvation. Amen. Hallelujah. Do you long to worship him? I can tell you what it's going to take. It's going to take a dying to self to truly worship him. You can't worship yourself and him at the same time. We must surrender to him. I stand before you this evening with an urgency in my heart. In fact, I want to title this an urgency to surrender. I was out in prayer this morning early and the Lord laid in my heart a real urgency and believe that he's calling you and I to a complete surrender. I believe it's very urgent that we do that. We let go and we let him just absolutely take us over. And I it's an urgency. And I and I I speak of urgency as a desperation. We're at the end. Are you ready if the resurrection takes place in a few more moments? Are we ready if it should come in the morning? I don't know when it's going to be. That's how urgent we are right here. But God is calling you and I to a complete and total surrender. I cannot overstate that. I'm not just speaking to you. I'm speaking to myself. I'm including all of us. So, let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, it is my my soul is shaking. I'm I'm just totally Lord, may this same spirit of urgency settle on the heart of your bride. Lord, we're at the closure. We don't know. I don't know how much longer. We don't know but what we'll even make it home tonight. We step from here to there in faith. But Lord, let us completely release, let go, and give ourselves in full surrender because that's what it's going to take. That's what it's got to take to take that body change. And you're going to have your bride in that position. You will and it must. And she's here on the scene today. So Lord, here we are tonight. We haven't come here by chance. It isn't something we've come just because of what afraid of what others might think or what we think. But Lord, we've come with a love in our heart &gt;&gt; for more of you. more of you, Lord. Now, Father, we present ourselves entirely in your control and this service is in your control and purpose and hands tonight. speak to every individual heart to each one we pray and for thy glory bless your promised word for I believe there's the promised word is here that you said would be here in this hour Lord and that is in the formation of your bride and you are here among us because that's you and Lord we just release ourselves now to what you would have us to hear. Speak to us personally in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn with me in your Bibles to Psalm 139 and we're going to read verse five. We could read. You go home and read the whole psalm. Do you believe he knows you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Do you believe he's searching you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is what verse one says. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, thou hast searched me &gt;&gt; and known me. &gt;&gt; As I said, my title is an urgency to surrender. Surrender, don't take that lightly. Surrender is losing your whole self and putting yourself in the hands of your Lord. He is perfect in all of his ways. He makes no mistakes. He cannot fail. He cannot lead you astray. He's going to lead you perfectly. The Lord is my shepherd. &gt;&gt; How about your shepherd? What is it? And we're likened unto sheep. We can't lead ourselves. We cannot lead ourselves. And if and we we are heading toward a climax. We know that. We're seeing it everywhere. But the climax we're looking for is a meeting in the air. We're looking for the resurrection. I'm expecting it &gt;&gt; and I want to absolutely let go. &gt;&gt; No matter what the circumstance is, I have a promise. I have himself in me and I know that he d guides and directs absolutely perfect. &gt;&gt; So Psalm 139, let's take verse five. Thou hast beset me behind and before. Praise the Lord. And laid thy hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is high. I cannot in your own ability, your own thinking. You cannot attain it. So we need to let go of that &gt;&gt; and yield ourselves and abilities to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we in our own human ability can do nothing. We are nothing to begin with. We were born with come into the world defeated. That's exactly right. God is not asking you to depend upon your self and your knowledge. He's saying give yourself over to me. Without me, you cannot make it home. Without your surrendering me to me, that's the urgency of it. Verse 17, how precious also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of them. I'd like you to turn me Jeremiah 29. These are familiar scriptures. The Bible ought to become familiar, but not only familiar, but Lord, let it be revealed. &gt;&gt; Let the thought be revealed unto me. His thoughts, his thoughts concerning me is laying right here in this word. It says right here, verse 11, for I know the thoughts that I think toward you. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; saith the Lord. You believe you're in this word? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You believe you're the thinking of God &gt;&gt; in this word. &gt;&gt; God thought of you, put you in the word because the word is a complete revelation of himself. And without you, he cannot have a complete revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you're in this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're written here in this word. &gt;&gt; And so I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end. I say let's surrender to him. Let's surrender to him. There's so many places in the scripture we could read. Let's go over here to Philippians 2. Philippians 2 verse 13 through 16. For it is God which workketh in you, oh God, let us become desperate. &gt;&gt; Do we realize this? Do we understand this? That it's God that it is God &gt;&gt; which workketh in you. You don't need to to lean upon your thinking. Let go of that. Give yourself to God. Give yourself to the word unreservably. Only believe. &gt;&gt; Let go. See, for it is God which workketh in you to will. &gt;&gt; What's he asking for? Submission. Submission, brother, sister. Surrender. Surrender to this scripture right here. Surrender. It is God which workketh in you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Then let's start acting on it, shall we? Let's surrender ourselves to him. For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do. You don't have to make things happen. Let him do it. Put it in his hand. Put it in his hands. You put it in his hands. Let go. You put it in his hands. &gt;&gt; Don't take it back. &gt;&gt; Leave it in his hands. &gt;&gt; Leave it to the word. &gt;&gt; For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. according to his pleasure. Now we'll come back Sunday we have part two but remember in Ephesians so we made stress of that his pleasure it's his pleasure it's his purpose he's called you individually for his purpose he's moving through his purpose he's working out his purpose just surrender to him you're not going to make it home without him you cannot make it home without submitting to yourself to him I can't overstress I overemphasize that both to do of his good pleasure. Therefore, verse 14, do all things without murmurings and disputings. Because surrendering yourself fully to him there, how can there be anything to murmur about or complain? &gt;&gt; The word has given you everything you have need of. &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; He's He's provided the way out. He knows his thoughts. He's He's provided uh he he's given us peace, &gt;&gt; an expected end. &gt;&gt; He's provided it all. &gt;&gt; And yet we think there's something we have to do in it. There's nothing you can do in it. Just give yourself to the word &gt;&gt; and let him lead. He will never lead you contrary to his word. If you find a spirit leading you away from the word, that's not God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what station you're in, what you are, or who you are. He's not asking you for your abilities. He's asking you for your surrender. &gt;&gt; I cannot overemphasize that tonight. Verse 16. Let's just jump down here. Holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain nor labored in vain. St. John, one more scripture while you're standing. St. John 17 or 15. St. John 15 verse 5. Take this to yourself. Hold it tight. I am the vine. You are the branches. &gt;&gt; I am the vine. &gt;&gt; You can do nothing without being in the vine. The vine supplies the energy. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. What's the vine got to do? What's the branch got to do? I mean, submit to the vine. You can't bear your own fruit. He said right here, I'm the vine, you're the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit. For without me, you can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into fire and they are burned. &gt;&gt; If ye abide in me, I'm coming down to this this statement. I've got a little bit twofold here. If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, that's oneness. &gt;&gt; You shall ask what you will. That's the mind of God in you. You shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. Here is my father glorified that you bear much fruit and you shall ye so shall ye be my disciples. You may be seated. God bless his word. Amen. He has no hands but ours, no ears but ours, no tongue but ours, no feet but ours. So let's let him have everything. Let's let him have everything. &gt;&gt; Let's determine in our heart to release ourselves to him. &gt;&gt; Lord, I can do nothing without you. &gt;&gt; So, let's let him have everything. The secret of this is submitting yourself with godly love into the hands of a loving father and let him take you over. Ah, &gt;&gt; that's the key. Let him take you over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're certainly not going anywhere s surrendering to yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The song says, "All to thee I now surrender. All to thee I freely give." Let me read that again. All to thee I now surrender. All to thee I freely &gt;&gt; give. It's not a drudgery. He's not forcing you. He's just simply saying let go and let me have you my way. You're too busy in other things. We'll get to that in a minute. I'm not speaking of just you. I'm including myself, every one of us here under the same dominion of this word. All right? You must God, excuse me, God wants a complete surrender. Now, I'm quoting the word of God through a prophet. He said, "God wants a complete surrender." Are you willing to give to him what God wants? God wants a complete surrender. Surrender everything, all you are, every fiber. Give all to him. Let him rule. The Bible said, "Let the peace of God rule in your heart." What's that rule? umpire. It's an absolute. He's absolute. You can't put yourself up here as absolute. There's only one. &gt;&gt; There's You got to have an absolute. So, it's going to be either yourself or the word. &gt;&gt; That's what it's come down to. &gt;&gt; And this, and I'll say this, this message is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Let him rule. Remember, he is the word. He's the final word. He's the ultimate. &gt;&gt; That's the end of all strife. That's the end of all murmuring. &gt;&gt; That's the end of all complaining. &gt;&gt; That's the end of all you trying to do it. You just let go and let him do it. Well, he doesn't do it in the in the time period I think he ought to. That's the problem, isn't it? &gt;&gt; You need patience. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Exactly. You need patience. When you submit yourself to him, he's going to fulfill his word. But he works through faith. Right? &gt;&gt; You take his word in faith, believing what you don't see, you don't have, you don't feel, but she said so. And faith rests in that word. &gt;&gt; When you ask, you believe, you receive it. Not later. Now, not looking for something to happen immediately. Because he said so, you receive it. I've received it, Lord, and you shall have it. &gt;&gt; That's going to be in God's time. &gt;&gt; So, don't start flirting with something else. I want to say right now, God is not a mixer. &gt;&gt; That's what Eve did. She mixed her seed with another seed. You say her seed. Yes, she had a seed. Do you Oh, well, she didn't have a seed. Oh, yes, she did. She has God's word. &gt;&gt; That was her seed. She had the word of God, but she couldn't wait for the word to for God to fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. She had the seed &gt;&gt; and she mixed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. She She had the She had her husband's word. She had the word of the Lord. She was given seed. She had the seed and the prophet said she mixed that seed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; With another seed &gt;&gt; and it brought forth death. To mix anything with an original that original word is bringing death. It's not going to go anywhere. It just brings failure. You'll try. You'll try. You'll strive. You'll strive. Why? Because you're not completely giving over to the word and do what he said and act upon it. I speak of all of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what is God doing? He has a bride coming to the full for her full potential. She's coming up to her full headship. She's she's growing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you must She's growing to a to a complete stature of himself. You must be desperate or perish. Here again, here's the word. You must be desperate or perish. And if there's ever a time that we should be desperate, it's this day. It's this hour. We must be desperate or perish. the Lord is my shepherd. Then surrender to your shepherd. In order for a sheep to follow the shepherd, it must submit itself to the shepherd. And let me say again, you cannot lead yourself. You cannot even defend yourself. A sheep is helpless &gt;&gt; without the shepherd. &gt;&gt; So are we. &gt;&gt; Totally. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not talking about perfection of the flesh. I'm talking about the soul being perfected. The per the letting go, the soul submitting, surrendering. Then let God take and rule from within from the control room. Your emotions, your thoughts, your deeds, your actions. Let that be your absolute in the soul. In there in that little room is where you meet him. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's where you live from. That's where you talk from. That's where we should always move, live, talk from there. Right there. Surrendering to he that is in you. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you than your circumstance. &gt;&gt; How many times did we have to hear that? How many times will we have to hear that? Greater is he that is in you &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world? than he that is against you. Then your enemy of your own self. That's the greatest enemy you've got is your own self. So don't bow to that. You lift up an idol of yourself. Anything. Oh my. Let me not get quite get ahead of myself here. All right. Let's back a minute. Let's go to Luke 13. The prophet said this. We want now we want separation. And God's word calls for a total separation from all unbelief. God's word calls for a total separation from all unbelief. Separated to his headship alone, not mixers. We must be separated to his headship alone. God doesn't want a mixer. You can't mix anything with God's word. If you do, it's death. &gt;&gt; It's failure. Amen. &gt;&gt; That settles it. That ought to settle it. &gt;&gt; Luke Luke 13 verse 24. Strive to enter in at the straight gate. For many, I say unto you, will will seek to enter in and shall not be able. When once, now listen to this. When once the master of the house is risen up and has shut to the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us, and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not, whence you are. Then shall we begin to say, we have eaten and drunk in your presence. Why? We've gone to church our whole life. We were raised in the message. That's good. &gt;&gt; But the message has got to be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't be just out here as a religion. God help us. Don't ever make this message a religion. Your religion. It's not your religion. It's your life. &gt;&gt; It must be your life. Amen. All right. So, she I don't even know you. They've come knocking at the door. But I but I drank with you. I I walked with you. Many hunted with him. meant he did many things with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And still didn't know him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can come to church every day and still not know him. &gt;&gt; It's got to be him living in you. That ought to put a desperation in our hearts because either we're desperate for him or we're not desperate for him. We ought to be desperate for him seeing in the condition of the world and what's around us and every sign pointing that we're here. We've arrived. The seal have been open. Brother Bram said that denotes we're at the end. We've arrived. We're here. We're at the end. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be any more history written because there'll be nobody here to read it. &gt;&gt; That's right. We're We're This is where we are. And God is calling us to a complete and total surrender. This is an urgency. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to take this lightly tonight. There may be few of us here. I don't know who's online, but this is an urgency. &gt;&gt; God is calling for your complete surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's there's things powerfully moving right now completely. Judgment. Three blasts up on on Sunset Mountain 60 61 62 60 years ago. We've We've come down here 60 years. Where are we at? We're right here, right now, right ready to leave. There's a bride marching out of here. There's a bride on the march. The move is on for the bride. That ought to put enough desperation in you, seeing around, seeing the time, seeing where we're at. That ought to put a desperation and an urgency. Lord, I want give everything. I give all to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I close the book right now and go home, I've done what Lord laid in my heart to bring an urgency. &gt;&gt; May it strike your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us not let us not just I don't mean we are, but let us let us including me. Let us not lay around anymore waiting. Let's be active and acting on the word and believe it. Act upon it. Not hearers only, but a doer of the word. If you're a doer, then you've submitted yourself that his word is the absolute. His word is the amen. His word is leading you. It either is or isn't. &gt;&gt; Let God search our hearts. Let God go deep into our souls. Let's go beyond our emotion realm. &gt;&gt; This isn't emotion. This is the revealing of himself in you. That's what it has to be. In order for you to surrender, you must have and receive him. And then he works through you. And he's just simply calling you to a greater deeper love affair with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A deeper greater love affair with Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And here we see right here when once the master of the house is risen up and the prophet comes along and preaches a message, it is the rising of the sun. It is the rising of the master. Not will be, it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if it is and it's come to manifestation, where are we at? The bride is in a maturity. She's ready to leave. She's going. Brother, sister, let us surrender. Matthew 25:10. I could read further in those scriptures, but I'll just for saving of time here, I just make the point there. When the master of the house is risen up and shut to the door, other words, what is he saying? He's saying right here in Matthew 25, the 10th chapter, 10th verse, excuse me. Notice here, notice here that the that the that the sound went forth at midnight. There was a cry. A cry. Not look, brother, sister, we're not looking for a cry. We've heard the cry. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom cometh. &gt;&gt; This is the mystery of the of the message. This is the mystery. the prophet said is how he comes. Amen. What's he doing here? The cry has gone out. Behold, the bridegroom cometh. And they rose up to trim their lamps to make ready for his coming. And here he is. And he she and she realizes the foolish don't I don't have oil. And she goes to get oil. Brother Brandham before the seals were open said, "Don't you men realize here she is trying to get oil?" And at that time he came. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we had a we have and we've turned from a planting season, a a former rain, and the latter rain was being poured out to to to to rain upon that seed that been planted that begun to spring forth and bring it to maturity. And where are we at now? &gt;&gt; 60 years down the road. We're not here in 65. What's happening now? What's the promise now? what's being revealed now. God help us. You need to surrender completely to God and let him come in and show you and lead you and guide you and fill you. &gt;&gt; He's in his marriage. Verse 10 here, 2510. Here they are trying to get it. And he comes and while they went to buy the bridegroom came, do you realize what the opening of the seals was? Do we realize what we seen in the heavens? That's brother Brandham said when when when Rebecca was riding along following the message in the message growing, there's a silent time there. It was be revealed to her. Do you realize that that was taking place? What was taking place? The revealing of the message, preparing her to meet her bridegroom. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she said, "Who's that in the field?" And the messenger said, as as the prophet said on the message, invisible union, "That's our Lord." No, rising of the sun. That's our Lord up there. That's your Lord. And what was she riding on? The very thing, the very camel she watered was the power. Amen. The white, not the original seed, the original word. She was watering that and it took her to the word made flesh. I wonder where it's taking us today. What are we seeing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, the marriage has come. &gt;&gt; And while they were and while the bridegroom and while they were seek while they were went to buy, the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage. The prophet said, "We've already got the marriage." He said the rapture is a wedding supper. &gt;&gt; And the and the prophet said on page 27 of perfect faith, he said he's pouring himself into her. They are becoming one for not the marriage. That marriage is already there. They've already becoming one for the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; What is the wedding supper? A celebration &gt;&gt; of the marriage. A it's a consummating. It's the complete committing consummation of that marriage. What are we looking for? The fullness of redempt the fullness of adoption, which is our body change. &gt;&gt; There's something taking place that the majority are not getting and they can't. But the bride, this message, this urgency, it can only be seen and received by the bride. &gt;&gt; I don't know who the bride is. It's not my duty to know. &gt;&gt; My duty is to tell you what's taking place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, here we are. And they that already went in went in with him. Went in with him. &gt;&gt; He's already come to receive you. &gt;&gt; The opening of the seals was the performing of a marriage. He said the first duty, the first thing of duty I had to do before in the opening of seals was to marry a couple back in the little room. I performed a marriage. What were those seals doing? They were opening up, revealing, opening Christ to you. It's the It's what is it? It's the opening of the word. It's the third pull. And who's it going to be revealed to? What's the secret? Who's going to receive that secret? Only the bride. Amen. All right. He's in his people. The prophet said he's in his people. See, we're going to a wedding supper. He's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her. &gt;&gt; Not to all the women. To her. With a love affair to her. She's pregnantated with life. She's right now. She's here bearing his name, bearing his life. &gt;&gt; If you're going to see Christ today, you'll see him outside of meeting him in the air, which we're looking for. That is what we're looking for. We're looking for we're looking for the the uh the second Adam to appear. &gt;&gt; But you say, "What has he done?" He's already come. He said, "I'll prepare a place for you and I'll come again and receive you." Hallelujah. I'll receive you unto myself. &gt;&gt; And that surely that's a receiving of. But there's got to be a faith coming here right now to prepare you for that receiving. There's got to be a perfecting of the word. And God's calling for your surrender &gt;&gt; to what? To me? No. To a church? No. To the word present with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hid behind skin. &gt;&gt; God with skin on him today. &gt;&gt; Not another person. He's got skin on him. &gt;&gt; All right. They are become, he said, pouring in the love affair. Pouring out into her. He's pouring out into her himself. Then he had to be here to POUR OUT OF HIMSELF. THERE HAD TO BE there had to be a fountain open and you had to partake of that fountain. I hope you understand what I'm saying. There was a release of life or brother Brandham couldn't say couldn't say she's now pregnant with life bearing his name bearing his life &gt;&gt; bearing the sign bearing himself among the people because we see now he had to fulfill scripture. There had to be himself coming in a bride form in the bride form. In order to fulfill scripture, in orders to come back to Eden and back to the original Eden, he's come got to be a full restoration. And that's why the LATTER RAIN WAS POURED out because the the word is growing. The word is growing in the bride to a full stature. The revelation of Jesus Christ. I say this on things that are to be. He said the revelation of Jesus Christ today. Today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Is the same. He said it's himself again. The revelation of Jesus Christ. The same spirit that was in him is in us. The same man, the same person is here in another actor's garment. Just the actor's garment he promised would be. It's a royal bride to the royal promised son. It's not another seed. It's the same seed. It's the original word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the revelation of Jesus Christ today is growing in a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the full stature. And he's now he's calling because here we are. We've come to this place. We're now ready to be changed. And he's saying, "Submit yourself. Give yourself to me completely. &gt;&gt; Don't get out of step. Stay in line. Stay in line. Amen. Amen. It sounds like you say, "Brother David, you're desperate. You're upset." No, I'm not upset. I'm desperate. Yes, I'm I'm urgent. I'm I'm bringing an urgent message. This is maybe the last time. And your attitude toward this tonight will determine where you're going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not their attitude toward me. You may not like the way I minister the word. Not your attitude toward me. It's your attitude toward the word. It's toward him. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. All right. He's in his people. You believe he's in his people. Oh my. Not. It's the rising of the sun. Not will be. It is now the rising of the sun. Then he turned right around and said the sun is up. &gt;&gt; Right in the same message. She said, "The sun is up." All right. The bride is marching out. &gt;&gt; She's leaving. &gt;&gt; She's going. I wonder, are you on board of that? Are you marching? Where are you going? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you right now, it's going to take a complete surrender and submission to that word. &gt;&gt; You cannot be desperate until God speaks to you. Look at the widow woman. He He told Elijah, "Go to that town. I I have a widow woman in that town where there's nothing but poverty, where there's nothing but but uh uh no rain. There's nothing but uh uh famine, &gt;&gt; but I've commanded a widow woman &gt;&gt; to sustain you. &gt;&gt; And he had to believe that. He had to submit himself to the word to go there. And he went there expecting to find the widow woman. And the widow woman didn't know yet that God had commanded her to take care of that prophet. &gt;&gt; Take care of the word. Feed it. WATER IT. GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; And the power THAT WAS IN THAT WORD would sustain her and take her to her bridegroom. Now there is submission. &gt;&gt; There is surrender. And so, and so he come he he came and he said, "Bake me a cake while I've only got one left. Me and my boy are dying." This is the outward appearance of things. This is the situation. This is where we're at. &gt;&gt; But regardless, he said, "Bake me one first." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when she turned and had the right mental attitude and turned to surrender herself to the word, "And thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; The barrel of meal will not be empty and the and the cruise will not run die until there be rain again upon this earth. &gt;&gt; When she turned to surrender herself, GOD TOOK CARE OF IT. &gt;&gt; That's what he's asking us to do. &gt;&gt; Submit yourself to the word. I will take care of it. I will provide. I will take you. I will bring you to your change. Don't be weary. Don't be fear anymore. Just surrender. Submit yourself. Take me at my word. Let go of your fear. Let go of your anxiety. Regardless, I don't care how it feels. I don't care who says what this one says or that one says. &gt;&gt; My, you can't be desperate until he speaks to you. Oh, church, rise and shake yourself. Pinch your conscience. Wake up in this hour. We must be desperate to perish. There is coming forth something from the Lord. And he said, I know it as thus sayaeth the Lord. and we have it. &gt;&gt; It's the opening of that seventh seal. Those seals have been opened. It's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have it. And he said, "And now we don't say it's coming. It's still coming. It's arrived. It's here. And we've grown our EP in it. We're living in it. We're growing in it. &gt;&gt; The bride is coming to a a maturity. She knows what she is. She knows where she is. She knows what she is. And when she knows what she is, the rapture will go. Oh, brother, sister, submit yourself. &gt;&gt; Don't let me let me just read this quote. Let me finish this and let me get something to you if I don't get anywhere else. All right. Now, God in you, I think that the love of God causes desperation. See, I believe the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love. That God, the love of God, I think the love of God causes desperation. And that's exactly what the lack is. You've got so taken up over your affairs, your own affairs, your love has become cold. I say, God, restore that first love. Restore that zeal. Restore that desire that I had to surrender and completely yield myself to you out of love. Not out of Not out of your duty. How do you think your duty? God doesn't want your duty. He doesn't want anything you can produce. He wants your love. And your love is trust. AND YOU'LL OBEY his commandment. And in order to do so, you give yourself to him. Jesus himself learned obedience through the things he suffered. You're going to suffer. You're going to go through these things, but God has allowed it. And all you can do is say, "God, I rejoice in that because you are fulfilling a purpose that you've given to me in the body." Then I can say, "Hallelujah. So be it. I give myself to your word to fulfill what you desire. For your ways are perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you have said you made my way perfect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. We must be desperate to perish. It's coming from the Lord. I know it as thus sayith the Lord. We know it now as thus sayith the Lord. In fact, the bride has thus sayaith the Lord. Amen. I know it. There is coming forth something. There is, not there will be. There's coming forth something. We better get desperate. It's between life and death. It'll pass through us and we won't see it. And I want you to know it's passing through and many are not seeing it. I'm not saying how many, this one or that one. That's none of my business. I just know there's very few. Straight as the gate narrows away and few that find it. I don't care. But I want to be one of those few. How am I going to do it? Submission. Surrender. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Surrender to my will. Surrender to my word. Surrender to the words that I've spoken it. Surrender to thus, sayaith the Lord. Surrender to what's happening. It's moving right through us right now. It's not a public show. Amen. The bride has a hold of it. It's the secret that no one knows but her. And that's what we're preaching about. That mystery. &gt;&gt; It's not a hidden It's still not hidden. It's open. &gt;&gt; And there's a bride partaking of it. And the call is going out. The revelation's still going out. Why? Because there still may be one more. I don't know. But I know that he's risen up. And the next thing is a shutting of the door. It may be shut. I don't know. The ministry is going to still go on. It's going to still go on to the eternal lost, but it's still going to be for the brides who are still here. And there's still a perfecting through that word. There's a perfecting of that bride. There's a growth of that bride. Until everyone comes into that full growth. He's going to take her out of here. And it will, it's such a sudden thing, but it's already been happening. &gt;&gt; But those not expecting it can say, "Well, I thought the rapture was to take place before." And we already see we already see judgment struck the West Coast. Brother Bram said, "The wrath of God's belching right beneath you, LA. &gt;&gt; When and how long, I don't know. But this but you're going to sink." &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're under judgment. Listen, we see it all the time. Where's Where's the greatest point of judgment? LA. You see it over and over and over again. Three blasts said judgment striking West Coast. Amen. A great earthquake. Alaskan earthquake. I don't know if you were in that. No, you weren't. Too young. weren't born yet. Who was it that told me they Oh, yes. Sister Amy King that I was in that earthquake. You talk about talk about scary. Probably one of the if not the greatest earthquake that the earth has had. But brother Ram said it that earthquake didn't unbalance it, but the next one will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he said it was a a judgment sign because when Jesus died there was a great earthquake. And he said by that earthquake he told us it means that Jesus Christ has been officially put out. &gt;&gt; If you're going to be married to be here to be married to &gt;&gt; but he's here in spirit form. He's not here as a Calvary man. You're going to meet him. &gt;&gt; But his spirit is here in a bride form. He's taken up a position. The garment has changed. Why? Because the curtain is raised. &gt;&gt; Things are happening that hardly anybody knows about. Amen. And I don't know how many or how few. I don't care. But there's one thing I must know. That's who I know. &gt;&gt; And he never said it would be a group get it. He said it' be individuals. &gt;&gt; And they don't understand you no more. They understand him because they because they're like the wind. It goes where it listeth and returneth. And you don't know the circuit because you're not born again. Because everyone that's born again would understand where the wind moves and how it moves. And you see what I'm saying? You'd go back to St. John 3. I'm going off my way here, but I'll just leave it with you. He said, "I believe it'll throw us into desperation." When you see the conditions of times and people waiting in sin the way they are, it'll throw you into desperation. I believe it will. Desperation calls for a subject. And when that subject, no matter how faint it is, it's received. It's believed right then because faith catches catches when desperation is pushing it. Love in there mixes with it and brings it brings it to it. Desperation does it. Amen. in 1 Thessalonians 5. You don't have to if you'd like to turn 1 Thessalonians the 5th chapter and verse 20 through 24. Prove all things, hold fast to that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil. And the very God of peace sanctify you holy. And I pray God your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. Then let's go. Let go and let him do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faithful is he that calleth you. How many's been called? How many know he called you? &gt;&gt; Then he can't leave you. He's got to do it. What is he? What what's your Lord asking you to do? Surrender yourself to me and let me place you. Let me guide you. Let me bring you into that change. You cannot you cannot bring yourself. And here you're going through situation that you're trying in your own ability to take care of. You need to surrender. You need to submit yourself to God &gt;&gt; and act on the word. Forget Listen, I'm going to read this thing, okay? Calling you to oneness with him alone, one with your husband, the word in a perfect relationship with him alone. No flirting with another seed or another man. No mixing as Eve did. When you go to flirting with another man, what's happening? You're flirting with Satan. &gt;&gt; And that man can be this man right here. This man, you're that man. &gt;&gt; You're flirting with it. You're listening to two things. You're double-minded. You're not settled on one mind here. You're divided in interest. A double-minded man is unstable. Yeah, &gt;&gt; his ways are confusing because he's trying to divide himself between two interests &gt;&gt; instead of giving himself in total submission to the word. He's trying to divide himself, trying to live in between. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, brother, sister, religion is full of that. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't and it's not kept out of the message arena either. &gt;&gt; It's full of it. you're trying to divide yourself instead of giving yourself absolute completely fully to the word and let him lead you through your struggles and your trials and let him guide that. Let him take care of that. Let him guide where you are and not where you are. Amen. Let him do it. Give yourself to him and quit your complaining about it and rest in it. I don't care what it looks like and how it feels. Give yourself over to it. But the probably reason you don't is because you're afraid to. You might as well just hit the thing right in the head. You are fearful that God won't keep his word. &gt;&gt; That's the only reason you would stay because you're listening trying to hear another voice. Okay, I'm going to I'm going to have to Okay, listen to me. Christ the mystery of God revealed. Why do you hunger, church? &gt;&gt; How many's got a hunger? &gt;&gt; Why do you hunger, church? Why do you thirst? &gt;&gt; Good question. Why do you hunger? Why do you thirst? I'm not talking about natural. I'm talking about spiritual things of God. Why do you hunger? There's something in you hungry. There's got to be a deep to answer that call. &gt;&gt; Why do you thirst? There's got to be something to satisfy that thirst. Why do you hunger? Why do you thirst? It's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you. But you let May God just drive this home. But you let so many things get it out of you. That absolute so many things are getting it out of you. You let your job, you let your wife, you let your husband, you let your children. I am quoting what the prophet said here. It's not my thought. I say amen to it. Lord, I want to surrender myself to this. You let your job, your job is overcoming the word. There's no preeminence of the word. It's your job that has preeminence. It's your It's your It's your emotions that have preeminence. It's your children that have preeminence. You're listening to them instead of hearing the word. If you would turn and give yourself over to the word, God would take care of all of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But as long as you're trying, he moves his hand back and you can keep trying, but you'll never make it. &gt;&gt; You've got to yield completely to what the word said. Submit yourself. &gt;&gt; If the word said this and this and do this and this, then give yourself to it and submit yourself and quit trying to figure it out. Only believe. &gt;&gt; But you let so many things job, wife, husband, children, cares of the world, cares of money, cares of property, it's all happening. It's all taking premise. Satan saying, "Oh, but if you don't do this, you don't do that." I learned that a long time ago. I had a business and I never could write any business as long as I took it first and put it first. But as soon as I put God first, placed him first, put it first, I got more business written and got paperwork done. God was teaching me, you've got to put you first the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is his word made spirit in you. Then why don't you let him in you lead you and guide you? Why are you trying in your own spirit to do it? &gt;&gt; Don't lift up yourself as an idol &gt;&gt; and you place that before God. Anything that comes before God is an idol. There's only one thing and only one way you're going to make it and that's Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may not understand. He never asked you to understand. He asked you to trust. You don't have to understand how the shepherd leads. He said, "Trust me. Trust me. &gt;&gt; If you love me, trust me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you're not discerning the difference, you need a you need a birth &gt;&gt; because without the Holy Spirit in you, you will never discern the difference. These two spirits are not. There's these two seeds are so close in their manifestation because they're both and I'm I'm I'm leading into Sunday and I'll just speak this. They're both anointed of the genuine Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But one can't surren to the word and the other does because they are the word. &gt;&gt; And it would be so close it would deceive the elected if possible. &gt;&gt; Now I'm just going to say that in case somebody's missing. I'm going to stop it right there. I'm going to continue on what I'm saying here. Cares of the world. You let the pastor, you let a preacher, you let a minister, somebody else, friends, you let friends, you let relation, feelings, senses, and on and on we could go. Properties. &gt;&gt; Yes. Since when do any of these things you're going to leave them? You never got them. You never brought them into the earth. You're going to leave without them. Why don't we just submit ourselves to God and let go of it and let God handle these things &gt;&gt; and let the peace of God rule in your heart instead of you ruling? &gt;&gt; See how close that is between spirit and soul. That's why it took the word to show the difference. It would divide a sunder between spirit and soul, between who you are and who you aren't. Amen. Somebody else, friends, relation, feelings. Don't let self, as I already said this, become your idol, an idol or your idol between you and God. No mixing of the seed. You say, "That stung, brother David. You might as well just I'm preaching it to myself, too. You might as well just let it sting because it's going to do you good. It's going to separate you. And God calls for total separation from anyone, anything, anybody that would stand between you and that word. &gt;&gt; God's word, God's word. Do we believe God's word? God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not telling you don't go out and work. I'm not telling you don't you're not going to have struggles. I'm not telling you that. But you have the word. &gt;&gt; That ought to be your rest. We've entered. If you've entered into rest, you ceased from your labors. &gt;&gt; Then don't pick up your labors again. It's dead. That old man is dead. You're eternally separated from him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God shown you where you stand. God shows you who you are. God has already given you his spirit to show you that the work was finished. He's already predestinated everywhere you go, everything you'll do. Just yield to him and let him lead you by the word. He is the word. He's not going to lead you any other way. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad your situation is. Don't quit saying woe is me. Woe is me. You're just putting yourself in front of the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's no woe is you. &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God and a seed of God, there is no woe is you. &gt;&gt; Quit saying that. Oh, God help me to get to these. I had some things I wanted to bring in that and I don't know when I'm going to preach again. But anyway, let's Here's the question. Ask brother Brandham. I've read this before. I'm going to read it again. I feel very rich. He The question is, you can't surrender to Jesus. I can't give over over completely to Jesus. Have I an evil spirit? You can't surrender to Jesus. Why? What's the matter? If you are a woman, don't you have to surrender to your husband to be a wife? Surrender all you are. A little lady when you were married, virtuous, fought all your life to stay virtuous, but one day you found a man that you loved and you were his completely. You were his completely. Put it to the spiritual here. You were his completely. If you're a married woman, the way you serve your husband is the way you're serving God because it's going to reveal what what your condition is with God. All right. You were his completely. The things that you fought against all your life and tried to live queen, clean, and clear, and virtuous. Now you surrender every bit of it to one man. Oh, that's hard. Oh, that's hard. Brother David, my He's done so many things wrong. And I think he's wrong. And he said this. There you go. You're letting something else instead of the word lead you. I don't care if he's the dirtiest one alive. If you married him, you serve him and do everything he asked you to do and you submitted yourself to him. Unless he asks you to do something that's contrary to that word, &gt;&gt; then you take your stand for the word. &gt;&gt; But you are there to serve him. I don't care if you disagree with him. Then pray with him and pray for him and quit listening to this one and to that one and to the other one to imprint and listening to the devil to put you and bind you and separate you. That is not God. That's the enemy doing that. Amen. You put yourself completely in his hands. You are his. You You sell out. You surrender every bit of it to one man. All that you've stood for in decency and moral and everything like that. Now you turn it over to a man because you surrender yourself to the man. Can't you do the same thing to Jesus Christ? Just surrender yourself that way. All that I am, all my mind, all my thoughts, my hands, my feet, my ears, my eyes, everything. Surrender it. Give it over certainly. And quit thinking it's a drudgery to do it. &gt;&gt; Quit thinking the devil putting a reason in you and you like you're bound. Oh, I'm so bound. I could be freed. You're only free when you let Christ have his way. &gt;&gt; There's your freedom. who the Son sets free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; I don't think you possess of an evil spirit. I think the evil spirit anoints you with them kind of thoughts. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. Because what he's saying you and thinking you to believe is contrary to the word. Then just simply repent. Turn around and go the way of the word. Change. How do you change? Submit yourself to the word. Do what he said to do. Whether you feel like it, whether it looks radical to your thinking, you have committed yourself to God. Then let go and believe he's deleting you. Regardless of what you think, &gt;&gt; you either will believe what you've done or you don't believe it. You've either given him headship and rest in that whether the things happen the way you didn't think it would happen. Remember what he said? It's so good and so pleasant to say, "Here am I, Lord. Then lead me, guide me, direct me in what pleases you, and then don't murmur when it doesn't go the way you thought it should." &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; There you are. You're not the watchman over your house. &gt;&gt; He is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether it be husband, your husband, the Lord, he's the watchman. And he's got a duty to do to keep it lined with the word. And if you don't obey that word, he's not the blame. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Not easy, is it? It's hard. He said, "You cannot surrender yourself to God." Let me show you something. Why would you want to surrender to him? See, the lady's asking, "Do I have an evil spirit? I can't surrender to Jesus." And yet, she wants to. And you're sitting here, you want to Amen. All right. What's he saying then? Because there's Why would you want to surrender to him? Because there's something out there calling to you to surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a very good sign that you ought to surrender yourself. And now all you do, brother, sister, might be a young person or old, whatever it is, just find themselves. So they can, they just can't find themselves to completely surrender. Just give yourself over. to a loving father, to a loving husband, to a loving &gt;&gt; bridegroom. Just give yourself over. &gt;&gt; You see how that contra your humanness? &gt;&gt; Well, I know I can do it. If you go along and think you have an ability to do anything in your human ability, you need to lose that. In order to please God and fulfill his purpose, you must master the thought of any human ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God can't use your ability. You have to give it to him. &gt;&gt; Don't you go out thinking you have an ability to do such and such. Because as long, brother, as long as you're thinking of that, he said it will fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back. go back and listen to the message perfect strength by perfect weakness and see what he said. All right, I'm I'm just going to close here. Very close to it. All right, what do we need to do? Take up your cross daily. Deny yourself. Take up your cross and follow him. What are you doing when you take up your cross? You're crucifying self. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're submitting yourself to the word. It's either you're absolute or you're your absolute. Amen. While we look not at the things which are seen, but the things which are not seen, for the that's the look focus. While we look at the things that are seen are temporal, the things that are not seen are eternal. when he leads us to a life of complete surrender and service to him. I wonder if our spirits and something sometimes don't rebel and kind of showing the wonder if we are lambs. A lamb is obedient. Amen. And that's the way a real Christian is. Self-sacrifice themselves, caring nothing for this world, but giving they all they got to God. You see, that's all you have to do. Just give yourself to a loving father. Give all that you are &gt;&gt; and let go and quit your fredding. &gt;&gt; Quit your fearing that it won't work. &gt;&gt; Because as long as that's there, you haven't surrendered. You need to surren I'm not saying it won't come. Sure, it'll come. Satan's going to put all kinds of things out there to get you off of that. He doesn't want you on the word because he can't defeat it. That's right. &gt;&gt; As long as you stay in the word. Oh, he'll try. He'll try to bring this thought. He'll try to do this. He'll say this through somebody and that through somebody. But give yourself to the word. &gt;&gt; That's your place. That's Are you his wife? &gt;&gt; Amen. Then your position is give yourself to him &gt;&gt; all that you are &gt;&gt; and quit worrying about how it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Quit worrying about it when it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; And let him take care of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if there's a question about doing anything, listen to what your Lord is leading you to do. Don't do it. Because a question is not faith. Faith is knowing. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; This may question, &gt;&gt; but that soul won't question when it's led by God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, you're not living by this. You're living by this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You live by faith. You don't live from your head. What you think &gt;&gt; in your head. You're not living by what you think in your head. &gt;&gt; You're living by faith in the heart. &gt;&gt; Then you need to learn how to speak from the heart, act from the heart, do from the heart. do from that little room. Live that. If you walk in the spirit, you will not if you live in the spirit, you'll not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Then let's let us not only live in the spirit, let us walk in the spirit. Now we see the promise being fulfilled. Christ our headship is going in coming in his bride. Then the head and the body are becoming one in works in sign in life vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last day. Vindicated by God himself through the promised word for the last days. He promised this in the last days. Now if you're spiritual, that's to have the mind of Christ. If you're spiritual, God in you, you'll catch it. &gt;&gt; You're going to see it. You're going to see your day. You'll see your hour. The evidence is that you have the ability to receive his word for the season. The season back is not 1965. The season is 62 years later. &gt;&gt; That prophecy of that of that prophet we are now fulfilling. We see in it being fulfilled. What was what was prophecy modern events made clear by prophecy. Now we see the prophecy. I'm fulfilling it. You're fulfilling it. We see the prophecy fulfilled. &gt;&gt; What day are we in? How close are we? If he said it's close there and he brought the prophecy and the word could not fail. God will fulfill all his word. What about right now? We better get desperate. We better surrender. It's an urgency. One more thing and I'm closing because I can't fulfill all this. When the bride has been committed to the groom, a marriage has taken place. When the bride is committed to the groom, she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders. What's that signifying? That not only is she under his dominion? Are you listening? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Over his dominion. That she has transferred her rights to him. That he is the head. What is he the head of? He's the head of the body. Amen. What's our head? The head of the body. And who's his body? You. Who? He's the head of his house. &gt;&gt; And you are his house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then who has the preeminence over his house? The master, &gt;&gt; the Lord. &gt;&gt; The headship, the headstone. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We have a capstone message. Do you believe this message is a capstone message? Then let's follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The body is submitted to the head. &gt;&gt; Are they not becoming one for the wedding supper? &gt;&gt; Then she belongs to him and him alone. That he bears the responsibility. She transferred her right. She bears the responsibility and the care. And that he alone, no one else, no other man, no other seed, no other power has any right and responsibility. And that beloved is the key. That beloved is the key. Submission is the key. &gt;&gt; He is sovereign. God by divine decreed said who would be in his bride. He elected her. He chose her. She did not choose him. He called her. She did not come on her own. He died for her. He washed her in his own blood. He paid the price for she belongs to him and to him alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Him alone. No one else. She is wholly committed to him. Holy. Holy committed. Totally committed. Completely committed to him. And he accepts. This is the beautiful art. And he accepts the obligation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Rest in it. &gt;&gt; Rely on it. &gt;&gt; Trust him. He accepts it. He's accepted. You put his veil over his shoulders. Leave it there. Don't pick it up and say, "Well, it's my veil." &gt;&gt; No, you've given it to him. &gt;&gt; Then let him lead you contrary to your natural carnal reasoning of what you think is best. Let him lead you. This has to come to a complete surrender. It must come to a total trust. This is the urgency of the day. This is what it takes to meet the challenge of the day. &gt;&gt; Who's going to meet the challenge? They that believe the word. &gt;&gt; They that can take him at his word. So be it unto me according to thy word. Without murmuring, without any feeling, the angel said, "This is what's going to happen." The angel, the Holy Ghost, will overshadow you before you're married. And that holy one in you will be the word living. It's a word birth. It's a spoken word birth. So is it in you spiritually. It's a word birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. What are you going to do with him? Trust him. Live for him. Commit yourself to him. Quit trying to figure out what he meant than what he said. Let it go and trust your shepherd. &gt;&gt; Though it looks very dark where you're at, quit trying to figure out what you're hap what's happening. Trust him. Give yourself over to him. Let go. take him at his word and close the ears and close the eyes to everything contrary your feelings to that word &gt;&gt; and give it over into his hands and when you place it in his hand don't you dare take it back &gt;&gt; brother sister it's not a law I'm telling you you're going to make mistakes but you have a word to lean back on when you do right back right back to the word. And he'll show you. And when he shows you, that's his love projected to you, keeping you, holding you, keeping you in line. &gt;&gt; He's before me and he's standing behind me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows my thoughts. &gt;&gt; He's already predestinated where you'd be. So be it unto me, Lord, according to thy word. I've read you the word. Here's what he said. Now, so be it unto me. I say as an individual, so be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; The power lays in his word. &gt;&gt; You have the mind of Christ. If you have the mind of Christ, you will not disbelieve that word. You will submit yourself in total surrender. He's taken a bride out of here that's surrendered to him because it's a love affair. You don't love. You don't love anything else greater. Nothing. Nothing more. Believing nothing more. Nothing else can separate you. You're going to lay everything else. If you lose everything, you've got it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you lose everything, they take house, they take land, they take money. I don't know what they're going to take. But don't you weary and don't you fear of it because you have him. You have everything you need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you not realize that he's a creator and he creates through your lips? Amen. &gt;&gt; Surrender yourself to the word. &gt;&gt; I was going to go into that speaking sewing. I'll have to do that another time. What is the key? Full surrender to God. Amen. That's what it takes. A complete surrender. God wants to surrender. How can you show your realities before you surrender to him? You've got to surrender. How can you show his realities unless you surrender to him? &gt;&gt; He want How many want to see more of him, more manifestation? Then let go &gt;&gt; and submit yourself to him. God bless you. Let's stand. I know we're always wanting to do something and put our part in something we know we ought to do. But brother, sister, that's not the way it works. You can't do it that way. And no ability, I don't care whose it is, will never be usable in the sight of God. God has to get all of our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose. Now, I'm not saying God didn't give you an ability, then give it back to him. Quit trying through your ability. Let God take it. Let God take your hand. Let God take you and do what he wants through you. And quit trying to find fault with how he made you. Quit trying to find fault with what he's doing with you. Simply take him at his word. Let's so run that we may obtain. Okay, we got a goal to We got a goal. How'd that boy say on that platform or that panel riding that bike? Because he got this focus on the end. He quit looking around what was around him. Stay focused. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand. You've committed yourself to God. You've given yourself over to a service. Then let's start fulfilling it. And quit trying to put these other things in front of you. Quit letting so many things take it out of you. God wants to reveal himself in a closer relationship than he ever has. He's got to take you home. Then let's let go and let him take you. Let go. Let let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. Your sorrow will vanish. Your night turn to day when you let go and let God have his way. Let me just read something to you here. Proverbs 18:10 says, "The name of the Lord is a mighty tower. The righteous run into it and are saved. See, you're married. What's your name? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is his name? Where's his name revealed? In his house. In you. In that day, the son of man will be revealed. What will it be revealed for? To join the church to the head. Unite the marriage of the lamb. The bridegroom call will come right through this. When the son of man will come down and come in human flesh. Who's human flesh? The prophets. Just like he did to Sarah and Abraham. God has come in flesh again. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Turned his back to him to show that the same thing that happened to Abraham is happening to us. But who's going to conceive seed? Be the bride because she submits herself to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let him change you. Let him mold you. Let him do what he wants to do with you. And quit your complaining. Quit your murmuring. That's unbelief. &gt;&gt; You're you're sowing through your lips and you're going to reap that. And you're trapped. You're snared by your mouth. The Bible said, Proverbs 6:2, you're snared by the word you speak. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm not going to start in that. That would take another hour. But I had that. That's why I read to you St. John 15:7. If you abide in me and my word in you. Romans 10:8, the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth. What is the word of faith? The son of man will come down in human flesh to unite the two together. Has he? The church has to be the word. He is the word. The two unites together. And to do that, it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man. Then can then can we see the marriage supper is at hand? If I never see you again, remember the marriage supper is at hand. The rapture is the wedding supper. The opening of the seals. The wedding is performed. the opening of the word. Amen. All right. Is uniting the two together. See, it's the son of man, Jesus Christ, will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that he'll unite the church and him as one. The bride and then see that he said it'll unite the bride and him as one. Then they'll go home to the wedding supper. Amen. She's already united. See, we go to the wedding supper, not to the marriage. Let me declare unto you, he's here receiving his bride, uniting with her. They are becoming one for the rapture. Then so be it unto me according to thy word. Praise the Lord. Are you happy? You might have had some straight talk, but straight talk's good for you. Don't take it as a man. You know, the Bible said in Psalm 29, you give him strength, you give him prede preeminence, you give it to him. He's worthy of the best. What do you do for him? Give him the leftover. Oh yes, you can run around day and give him three minutes at night before you go to bed. deserves. He deserves your best. He deserves everything you got. Give him your best. Give him your best. Give him the best of your life. Give him the best of your songs. Give him the best of your talent. Give him everything you got. Give him your feet. Give him your hands. Give him your eyes. Give him your mouth. Give him your ears. Give him your soul. Give him your heart. Give him your praise. Give him everything you got. Hallelujah. He deserves the best. Surrender all you are. This is what it takes. This is the key. A full surrender. I had you stand, but can I read something to you and show you what it means when we say an urgency? I want you to stand with me. Bow your heads, won't you? I want you to bow your heads and focus on what's being said here. God told me to do this and I almost forgot it. Oh God, this is the prophet speaking and let it be your words. Oh God, let me go. Lord, let me go. Don't leave me behind. Jesus, let me go with you, Father. I don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on. I don't want to stay here in this insanity. I don't want to stand here with hideous sight when hideous sightes the people losing their mind. We look at men trying to act like beasts and look like beasts and women trying to look like animals with their paints on their face. Knowing these things are predicted to happen that the thing will they'll go insane till locusts will rise up with hair like women to haunt the women and teeth like lions and things that you said the mental condition of the people will go completely will be completely gone. We see it now. He said, "We see it in the making, Lord." But I say right now, we see it happening. Lord, help us. Restore to us the sane mind of Christ Jesus, our Lord. Oh, great leader of eternal life. We accept your promise tonight. Let this go deep in our hearts. I plead for this people. I plead for every one of them in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, I pray that Christ, the son of God, will come into the hearts of every one of us, Lord, and mold us and make us into new creatures in Jesus Christ. Grant it, Lord. We love you. We want your dispos our dispositions to be your disposition. Our change, we want it to come into us that we can be your children. Feel your spirit moving in our hearts, Lord, tendering us, bringing us to realization of this insane age that we're living in. Grantite, Lord, when we see young women so caught up in the web of the devil, young men, perverted minds, dope addicts, children, cigarette smoking, drinking, immoral, Satan's Eden, God had taken you 6,000 years according to the Bible, to build an Eden, and you put your son and your wife in there, his bride to rule over it. Then Satan come around and perverted it. He He's got 6,000 years and he's built his own intellectual Eden through science and education and so-called intelligence. And he's built it into a mess of death. Oh God, take us back to Eden again, Lord, where there's no death, where there's no sorrow. Grant it, Lord. We stand humbly waiting for the second Adam to come for his bride. Make us part of him, Father. We pray in Jesus' name. And we say again, "Oh God, don't leave us. Don't let me don't." He said, "Oh God, let me go. Don't leave me behind." What's the key? Surrender. Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads, the close of this service, you've taken your liberty. I don't believe your word can return void unto you. It'll go and accomplish what it's sent to do. I say, Lord, accomplish your word in me. You said you're going to live and move and have your way in a bride. You are here in bride form. You've put on another garment. It's a still you, the same person united with your bride. And Lord, we see the bride coming of Christ just as you promised that seed would come again. And the promise is here. And we see the promise being manifest. We see who we are. Lord Jesus, we thank you and praise you. I ask you to minister to every individual heart as you have. Continue to minister that word. And Lord, if there be a Sunday and we come together, let us come together expecting to receive. Not expecting upon a man, expecting upon you to feed us, to open your word to us, to reveal it. We pray now. We give you praise. Let our mouth give you praise. Let us give you thanksgiving in all things and give the thanksgiving and the sacrifice of praise continually rejoicing. We ask this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. So let go and let God have his wonderful way. Just let go and let God have his way. Your sorrow will vanish. Your night turn today. Walk in the light. Then rise up. Arise quickly, bride. Arise. Give yourself completely to him. Rise up. Thy light has come. Amen. Ah, I surrender all. I surrender all. Let's do that. Lord, I surrender all. All to thee my blessed savior I surren before the presence of angels and witnesses once again let's sing that portion I sder all mean it now mean it from your heart. Render all all to thee, my blessed savior. I surrender all. God bless you. God be with you. In the name of the Lord. You're dismissed. Six. Good everything.
