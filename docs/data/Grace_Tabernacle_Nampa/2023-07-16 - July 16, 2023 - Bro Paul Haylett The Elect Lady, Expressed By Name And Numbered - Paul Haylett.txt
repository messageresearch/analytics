lots of opinions amen lots of thoughts lots of ideas but we are a word people amen and I just praise God this morning you know we never lift up the man but uh God sure anointed our brother Alex just to sing songs that go right with what we're thinking about today and what we desire to express and I pray that I can express amen that in its entirety just want to greet our visitor sister Shannon happy to see you still here I guess I thought you were headed back home but still hear minding the parents your dad we need to pray for sister Shannon's dad Mark just uh extreme case of diabetes and has just killed the circulation in his legs and I serve you serve a miracle working God Amen and we don't want to put limits on God Amen how could we mere mortals put a limit on what God can do in our life amen sister Hannah God bless you and your friend amen beautiful little Ava what a gorgeous little girl that she's yep there I get the little winky face there yes amen what a darling girl so just uh good to have each one just thank you brother Alex and musicians amen sure appreciate them the talent that God has placed here in this assembly and we're seeing the talent coming to life and there's some of you I would dare to say are still hiding your talents and you don't want to do that you want to just dig your talents out get them out in the open let God bless your talents amen so I have something I want to speak on for just a moment here that um just uh something that has been long overdue but sometimes circumstances bring us into positions that for reasons we won't bother to explain this morning you kind of pull back from something but it's been a long time since we've had a vote in the church over the offices and while we are not here to have a vote to say um we're putting this person against this person which one do you want but we're looking to a vote of confidence and uh what we desire is is that as an assembly that your voice would be heard to express how you feel is the church the officers of the church leading in the right direction or they helping you in your spiritual walk so I would desire for you to pray we haven't set a vote date but it will be in the next few weeks uh and um if you're not here when the vote takes place you will still have your opportunity to vote regardless if if life draws you somewhere else at the time and to be able to speak that and along that line I've been speaking with our brother Sergey for quite a while uh on on different things I uh not lifting up brother Sergey but I have found that I I appreciate his perspective that he brings he he has you know one thing let me just interject this one thing I appreciate about the men of this church is they'll speak their mind the church our officers are Yes Men they're not saying yes to men they're saying yes to God and so as they say yes to what they feel the leadership is in their life and what God is dealing with them they're not afraid to speak their mind and I appreciate that you know sometimes it's just a human nature we would like everyone to agree with us but you realize what kind of a catastrophe we would have if everyone just agreed with us let's all run like lemmings oh yes let's do it brother where's the nearest cliff no we want men to stop and say brother think about it and so uh I have asked brother Sergey quite some time back and just kind of been dragging my feet just waiting and just Desiring for the Lord to put everything in the right order we've asked brother Sergey to join the trustee board and um the current trustees are all in favor of that and welcome brother Sergey on that so when it comes to the vote there will be for like the office of Pastor it will be a vote of confidence it will be yes we have confidence or no we don't and then as the offices are that's how that vote will also go for these brothers I have confidence or I don't and that's what the vote will be brother Sergey will be the only one that you are literally voting in because even if the vote of confidence said brother Paul we have no confidence as you as a pastor that is not voting me out of office we as a church would then have to resolve the circumstance of why and literally we put it this way that any man who wouldn't have the confidence of the people uh you don't really want them in that office because if one is preaching as it would be a minister and you not sure you can trust their leadership then you're not going to listen anyway you're not going to follow that so what we want is the mind of God we want the will of God so we'll be having this vote here in in probably a couple or three weeks I don't think we want to do it when brother George is here um you know brother George will tell you throw the bomb out and um I shouldn't have put brother George in the message I'm sorry so anyway uh brother George will be here we'll have a regular Services coming Saturday at seven o'clock and Sunday at 10 30 with a fellowship to follow I uh brother George has been very busy I have been very busy we have connected but only briefly and so there's a possibility that we will have an informal Friday service when I say informal it will be something that you as the church can have opportunity to speak up interact Etc probably take place in the basement so keep that in mind and please pray for that and once again we're happy to see each and every one of you here today and um so let's just uh turn in our Bibles will stand and turning our Bibles to the Book of Numbers the first chapter and um I don't want this to be confusing we're actually turning to numbers 1 16 through 19 but I want to make a quick reference here so you'll understand where this scripture is going in numbers 1 verses 1 through 3 God is speaking to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the Tabernacle of the congregation on the first day of the second month in the second year after they come out of the land of Egypt so some time has went by and God is now wanting to set certain things in order so he's speaking to Moses and giving them a giving him a direction for the people and he's telling them to take a Psalm or or add up or look at the congregation of the children of Israel and look at their families and look at the house of their fathers and the number of their names every young man and so it's there that we see that 20 years old and upward to go forth and he's calling them God is actually preparing Israel for Warfare and so I it struck my heart we have we have songs today that just went right along that line amen I was called to the army of God amen I wasn't called to be a bystander or just an observer and I don't want to read about it as a historical event like as it would be is the prophet of God says if there was a book of Acts written in this day my brother and sister I want to be written in that book amen amen I don't want it to be a history event of these brothers here this sister there this family there they pressed into the battle and they served God and my name's completely absent no sir I want to be found if there was another book of Acts written I want my name to be found as a person as a son or daughter of God that was called to stand up and fight for the gospel amen it's one thing to be an observer amen it's another thing to be a participant Hallelujah and let me just put it to the Natural I think most of us I won't try and make it inclusive most of us as kids if there was an impromptu ball game volleyball game something you didn't want to go there as they're picking teams and say I'll just stand here but really I come to be an observer as kids now when you get to be 60. you get to be 60 of being an observer is really cool I mean it's just like watch these young people jump and run and sweat and sprain their ankles and all of these things I can just watch that happen all day long but when you're young you want to be a part of what's Happening amen and so we were not called to be Observers we're called to be Warriors amen let's go to verse 16. these were the renowned of the congregation princes of the tribes of their fathers heads of thousands in Israel and Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by their names and they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month and declared their pedigrees after their families by the house of their fathers according to the number of the names from 20 years old and upward by their polls as the Lord commanded Moses so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai father we just ask you to come and bless this time together Lord as we just desire from a heart to express this to your Saints as an encouragement today Lord of what you really called us to do father not to just sit in the edge of the desert of Sinai of our day and just say whatever will be will be Lord we know that came from the devil when he tried to get the people to not recognize what their true calling was or is that they would just set back and whatever would unfold that they would be Anointed with a spirit of defeatism to just accept what happens around them but father you did not call us in this hour Lord to just accept Satan's verdict but you called us in this hour to see who we are to stand up and have our names announced and recorded and father to be numbered as Sons and Daughters of God we ask for your leadership today in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as we would look here in numbers I want to draw this forward into the day that we live in and draw thought from this as we'll see that brother Branham given the vision of the Bride going marching up into Glory now my brother and sister in that Vision we can look at that some people would say you're making quite an assumption well if I am then God help me that my assumption would be correct but as we look at this my brother and sister this was an honored analogy this was not a prophet seeing a people that just represented something but I personally many years ago it struck my heart so strongly that I was in that number amen when the prophet of God saw that vision of the Bride going into Glory I was in that number he saw a literal bride being called of God into the presence of God and my brother and sister I was represented there you were represented there and so it's there in that we realize that we can look at many things in the Bible would be figurative we can look at many things in the Bible that would be giving us a type and a shadow but I believe there are some things in the lives of Believers that we should stop and say I believe that was literal and it was for me amen because we're looking in a day as it is that Israel having come out of Egypt my brother and sister there was these struggles that they had right off the bat my brother and sister they come to the Red Sea and you know the greatest challenge that Israel had right at that moment let's forget the whole big picture sometimes when we come face to face the challenge we're facing right at that moment is the overwhelming a spirit of either Victory or defeat question mark a lack of confidence great confidence and we have to face that challenge of the moment we can stand there at that moment and say well I'm the bride of Christ but if you can't speak the word and act upon it then it's irrelevant to you what you have heard in the past what has been spoke to you it needs to take route where we could be and come down to the Red Sea we've all heard it preach but if Israel had come at that time and if that Spirit of doubt and fear had not been upon them the priests would have marched right out into the Red Sea they would have said if this is where God has brought us this is where I want to be amen not with the spirit of if God's going to force me but I want to be where God wants me to be I want to go where God has called me to be and sometimes we'll see and I don't want our guests today to feel like I'm speaking at you but I didn't know you were going to be here so just please Buckle that seat belt and bear with us my brother and sister if you have the attitude that God is forcing me to serve him you are in the wrong attitude you're in the wrong atmosphere God is trying to woo us and direct us to serve him but there's only two spirits amen so if God's not wooing us who is and so as we look at this and realize as it come down as the prophet sees a bride marching into Glory each one was identified now we'll understand here if you'll bear with me each one of those was identified but a prophet couldn't have said I see brother so and so sister so and so people he never met or people that never came to the Lord until he was gone from the scene God did not anoint him to be able to just run a roll call at that time not his job amen not what God called him to do was not to run a roll call amen so it's there each one's identified because this is not a random group it's not too hard to study the scriptures and realize that this bride of this last day is not a random group amen don't you love it when they have a pole you'll see that is President Biden is he doing a good job as president and it's a random poll but how random how random my brother and sister amen you know I I would I won't say that because it'll be misunderstood but you look at this my brother and sister you see this was not a random group of people that is making up the Bride of this last day it was not a random group of people that walked out of Egypt every one of them God knew who they were and he had numbered them amen amen and so it's here each one identified and they come now the word says if you can number the grains of dust or you can number the Sands of the sea then you could number God's people so that's in that's in Genesis 13 16 and Genesis 32 12. you can look those up if you want to that is speaking now my brother and sister we know that it would be humanly impossible to number the Sands of the the sand on the seashore amen it would be impossible to name or number the particles of dust upon the Earth so it is impossible for mankind to number the Bride of Jesus Christ Now isn't it interesting that um different things I just throw this out don't make much of it that um you know there's some people they're trying to decide if the message of the hour has any relevance in the world of religion and that one man says well you know it's not nothing it doesn't count as anything there's only a few hundred thousand of them on the whole Earth he must be able to number the sand and the Dust because contrary to the word of God God says unless you can do that you cannot number so they are there just making assumptions and their assumptions if they were for the Assumption should be no this is a great move of God that's gaining momentum but they're looking at it now they're inconsequential our our denomination has 17 million people there's maybe a hundred thousand of these my brother and sister I'm telling you God knows who are his and he's the only one that numbers should matter to amen and it should matter to us whether we're counted in that number or not it shouldn't be well if God wants me to be in that number then I guess I will be in that number no there's something inside of me says Lord count me in that number I want to be counted in that number and so as it is it strikes our heart isn't this amazing reminds me of a Story Once A man was pulled over speeding and when the the patrolman comes up gets his information comes back to right to man a ticket and the man says I'll have you to know I'm friends with the governor the officer stands there a minute looks at him and says you're friends with the governor yes sir I'm friends with the governor is the governor your friend you see my brother and sister it's one thing for us to say Hey you know he's my savior but does he look down on us and say I am their savior amen save us from our sin Lord I want you to look down on us today Lord and say I am their savior but you see if we don't accept salvation then we can't say he's our savior everyone personally known to God do you realize my brother and sister are even the unbeliever is personally known to God this is how awesome omnipotent our God is to say he knows my brother and sister who the scripture says who is his own he knows who is on that that means he can recognize each one amen and identify them because he knows who they are and I say this positive today please no one think that I'm going down a negative route here because when I was studying this my heart was just full of joy to know that I could be counted in that number to be knowing with confidence that God knows who I am God knows who I what my needs are he knows my weaknesses he knows my strength and that makes my heart Rejoice because you see it's not a guessing game I can stand here you can stand here today with confidence and say I know who my redeemer is and if we know who Our Redeemer is with a relationship then he also knows who he hath redeemed but you see it's Satan's job and he's done quite well with it amen he's the God of this age amen he's been through the ages the god of the age look of this you want verification go back when it's there what happened Satan offered Jesus the kingdoms of this world he couldn't offer something he didn't have control over amen but he's sitting here today knowing he's fixing to lose control amen it's slowly being rested from his hands my brother and sister you realize that Satan is desperate now we often get a mental idea that the devil is this great big omnipotent strong guy but my brother and sister he is completely controlled by the word amen there's not one thing that Satan can do that the word has not given him permission to do and so as we look at this when we come and realize that God having called you and I he has looked at our lineage he's looked at our pedigree aren't you glad he looked at the pedigree amen he knows where we come from and who we are and he looked at that and said I'm going to name them by name and I'm going to count them by number and these are mine that I have called to be the Warriors of 2023. in 2024 or whatever God is called we're not just randomly here but called to be Warriors I'll tell you what I'll never have I'll never have oh God forgive me if I'm wrong here but I will never have a wall branded to my name I will well I did it one time but the blood covered that amen but you know I won't ever be able to stand and say God didn't give me opportunity to rise up I have my brother and sister and you have accepted the opportunity to step into the calling that God has in your life hallelujah what to be the Warriors of laodicea amen not observers of laodicea not observers of Satan's games and gimmicks and things that he promises he promises a pleasure for a season but then as seasons pass he says all bets are off it's an acceptable phrase what I promised you there doesn't apply today people start out in the pleasures of life and end up in alleys lived in penthouses you know the story and end up in alleys looking at the penthouse they used to live in and there's always a reason my brother and sister they don't just move out of the penthouse one day and go live in an alley there's always something that happened amen one story there of a man amen as it was his world started to unravel his wife leaves him there's trouble he goes broke he went from living a lavish lifestyle to living in an alley looking up at the house he used to live in and what happened he said it all started and he names the place that it all started what if that place had been placed under the blood of Jesus Christ and God had stared you say well well why did God allow it to happen my brother and sister free moral agency is still here I get to choose to be a warrior today or I can be an observer today I can choose to stand on the word or I can compromise on the word I have that choice now God says he never lost a one so I'll probably get drugged through the dirt if I made that kind of a bad decision until I come to the place that I cry out and say Lord I need you I need you Lord I need you more than I need anything else in this world I need you amen Hallelujah everyone personally known to God as the song says he knows my name amen I want to sing that my brother and sister as he knows my name as a part of the bride of Christ of the redeemed I don't want him to know my name as one that saw the word and walked away one that said I'll compromise one that said I don't have time I don't want to be known by that I want to be known as one that says yes Lord yes Lord I want Yes Men I want to be a yes man yes Lord whatever you want me to do yes Lord I trust you sister Sue often buys me military history books not to throw sisters who under the bus but that's where they appear from and when you look at these stories that these men share about their time of combat not all these stories as men unscathed many of these stories men come home wounded in spirit and in the flesh missing legs and arms and eyes and in one book they asked this man how could you go and fight in such Fierce places like Afghanistan and ramadi in Iraq how could you do that because these other men had my back and I could completely trust my life to them now my brother and sister if we could trust a fellow man oh how we should be able to trust our Lord Jesus Christ men will go in one story if I could just recount it briefly to you a fellow Soldier is shot down in the middle of a street and the bullets are pucking around him because they're still trying to finish him off and a man a fellow shoulder Runs Out grabs him throws him older his shoulder and as he's running back to safety is shot in the back ultimately it destroyed his kidney damaged his spine his bladder and for years for years operation after operation after operation trying to fix it and here was this big robust Brave young man reduced to a hobbling morphine dependent individual and a reporter says I want your story and as he shares his story he finally comes to the Crux and says why would you do that he looks at the reporter in shock why would I do that because he would do it for me and when my dad got too big and I couldn't pay it he did it for me so I'll tell you I'm here today just to give my life to him to serve him do everything I can do do you know his fellow soldiers built him a house that his wheelchair capable or whatever you call it the counters everything is set up for him because they looked at that and said it wasn't just that man in the street if that had been me he would have come for me oh Hallelujah and he came for me he came for you I say thank you Lord I can serve a God Like That Hallelujah Hallelujah now in the identified Masterpiece of God you see sometimes we just think well okay I was born in a message family well remember this scripture says that Moses was to account them from their lineage from their ancestry from the house of their father to trace it all down it's not random my brother and sister or God knows who we are amen so here it is what God is speaking he's trying to show us that this is his plan not my plan you know Brother Paul's pretty good businessman you want me to run your life some of you aren't even shaking your head no does that mean there's possibility no sir you don't want Paul to run your life amen because wherever man has his hand man makes mistakes wherever God has his hand his plan is perfect the imperfection is our interpretation of what the plan is amen now he is making a bride yes sir and now some people would say pardon our guests this morning I I don't need to bring it up really I don't think I don't think that you would judge me on this but here we are amen sometimes we say why is my life went this way why is my life went that way you know I if God really cared this wouldn't have happened no he's hewing the chips amen he is molding us into who we are right now chopping off the world oh Church joining Creed's denomination Dogma all has to be cut away from the church their formal ideas their indifference their doctrines and things come back and let the master pick up the bow referring to the violin let the master pick you up in his hands strike the word and say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen Lord Make Me mold me make me Lord when I should be can we read that together Lord Make Me mold me make me Lord what I should be amen then there'll be a different thing we've got to come to that place that we're ready to say Lord if you want to knock this chip off of me amen that chip might be the chip of attitude amen it might be the chip of anointed of a spirit of depression or anxiety or fear or lust of the flesh or pride of life and God says I want to come and knock that chip off of you oh Lord have Liberty today just take the hammer and knowledge of your word Lord and knock that chip off of me amen have your way Lord then there'll be a different thing then if I be lifted up from Earth this is Jesus speaking I'll draw all men into me yes sir he is cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only down to his word only amen not I go to this church not of this opinion not of this education down to the word oh Hallelujah cutting all the Creeds Dogma everything away from you trying to get back to a bride for hit the sun another Masterpiece part of the word the word amen my brother and sister not Grace Tabernacle it's not going to get you anywhere the ministry of this church is not going to get you anywhere because even the ministry of this church could get staggering a little can get a little opinion can get a little something but God can correct that amen we don't just throw the baby out with the bath water because the baby cried all last night amen the baby's growing up the baby's Gonna Learn to say mama my throat hurts instead of just crying the baby's learning to do this sorry to put this this way but at Grace kids the other night amen I'll tell you what you just realize how fast kids are we're doing our little group there with the kids and a certain little blonde-haired young man he just piles out of his chair and next time I know he's standing on the kitchen counter and he's got the cabinet door open I I understand why he's standing on the kitchen counter it put that cabinet at eye level he wasn't standing here at the floor saying I'm thirsty and I need a glass he said I can go where the glass is at amen I'm like oh I know I'm just going to spill it what are you doing Sammy I'm thirsty well you know that's actually awesome because it wasn't long ago he would have went to the door and called out to his mom mom thirsty but he's maturing amen and now he's like I know where the glasses are at and I know how to operate that little deal in the refrigerator come on what are we doing we're growing up we're maturing we've heard a calling amen Jesus couldn't take the place you remember when they read that day in the book he just read part of the prophecy left the rest of it for the last days we're supposed to take that part now that's the reason I use Lil Sammy as the example my brother and sister he doesn't go over there and try and put he probably has but time put his mouth against the deal in the fridge he doesn't go over there with a plate to get water from the fridge he doesn't go over there with a knife fork or a spoon to get a drink of water he knows what it takes to get a drink of water and when this prophecy was spoken and Jesus cut that off he knew the pride of this last day would be able to come and pick that prophecy up and would know what to do with that prophecy it's not enough to say God sent a prophet good the devil knows that but that prophecy of this day was a fulfillment of the word amen aren't you glad you can lift a hand today and say I am the Fulfillment of the word for this hour I'm not just an individual that is going to a church I am an integral identified named part of this prophecy Hallelujah amen we're supposed to take that part so you see he is cut and wants to cut the church out just like he did the Sun out like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him not a part of the Creed not a part of the church not a part of denomination but a part of him hewed out go look up the word hude that is not kind words and soft music that is a force carving cutting chiseling away sometimes with excessive force I don't like how hard the preacher preaches well then healed because if God wants you you doubt he'll just keep getting a bigger hammer amen until we'll come to a place and say Lord I'm okay Lord I acknowledge I'm yours and I want to be yours amen now it's not hard-headed people you're not hard-headed people other people are hard-headed people well that's what I always hear hard-headed people saying if they weren't so hard-headed but God will bring us to a place that finally will say if I hadn't been so hard-headed if I hadn't pushed back against God's will I wouldn't have had the hand as a lamb my leg broken imagine the counter-type story of the Lamb with a broken leg as it is over his shoulder going by everyone he broke my leg my leg my leg egg but what's the true story the little lamb falls in love with the shepherd he's with the shepherd He Walks With A Shepherd he sleeps with the shepherd and when the cast comes from his leg he wants to be where the shepherd's at now let's not have any complaints about what God has done in your life amen he did that to get you to follow him be close to him never want to be separated from him amen not to go through life saying God did this to me what's wrong what's the struggle God no what's wrong and the struggle put your name there huh amen you got to be huge not huge from you mentioned God healing you from the word amen you know what that means Saints come on somebody let's get excited that means I was in there you were in there to be hewed from the word you had to be in the word otherwise you couldn't be hewed from the word God's not going to go out here and laodicea in this uh Satan's Eden and Hue something out bring it in sprinkle a little water on it and call it his you were in the word and God hewed you out of the word and identified by the word who you was oh my brother and sister have you ever noticed the world we live in now when Moses the statue of Moses was carved out you don't find any laminate lamination lines God carved that out of a rock amen who did that DaVinci Michelangelo I knew I wouldn't get that right you know I study them guys so often Michelangelo he didn't go down to the rock quarry and say I like the color of that Little Rock and I like this rock and I like that rock can somebody glue these all together no he went down there and here's this giant hunk of rock and he knew it was the right Rock because by Vision he saw Moses in that rock oh are you with me amen we don't need to laminate the word of God together God took his word and when he looked in his word and turned it every way he said I see you I see a bride in my word and I'm gonna chip here and I'm gonna chip there and I'm gonna carve away here and sand a little there and lo and behold after many moments no sir years and we get all impatient Lord why did I how did this happen I thought I was more better Christian I thought this I thought that years of polishing years of bringing it back but you know what happens we as humans with human reactions see the word coming and we know those things in our life need to be taken away but the words coming and we're like going God's trying to change me again well I'll tell you my brother and sister if your son or daughter of God you might as well and we'll get to a quote here if I get to the quote amen you've got to be hewed from the word the world cut off of you just leave the word only live in you the great sculptor is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires one of none of this cringing none of this Lord I want to do what I want to do but to come and say Lord you would not have called me you would not have put this in my life you were not a place of seed in here if you were gonna just chip my arm off amen if you were gonna just carve me into another image amen come on let's have confidence in God let's trust God and just stop and stand there and say Lord what it is you want me to be I'm Gonna Let You Lord I'm gonna stand here I'm not gonna run I'm not gonna hide I'm not gonna cringe I'm not gonna Rebel I'm going to stand brother Ivan I always refer to him as brother Ivan senior Amen to separate our brothers our brother Ivan shared for years story Believers there Iron Curtain I guess you would call it Bibles being thrown over the fence soldiers raking the sand to see any footprints and a young man caught soldiers appearing so suddenly he doesn't know where to go and he's caught now I'm telling you right now I consider myself to be a reasonably Brave person my first instinct what all they would be is like that smells like dust and that looks like dust but what did he do he's like Lord help me and it was though he was paralyzed he's standing by the fence with a box of Bibles Lord help me God doesn't send a mighty Angel and slay them in he doesn't send bolts of lightning he doesn't whatever what does he do he paralyzes the man for the man wants to run but he can't the man wants to flee for his life because that's the only thing is like fight fright and he doesn't have anything to fight with but he did because he was holding the very Living Word of God in his hands and God just caused him to stand there and these men if you don't think this isn't miraculous these men are under command back in those days our brothers and sisters that grew up in that world you know what that was like they enforced the rules they didn't care about the peasants as it were and these men with their rifles their automatic rifles are walking down the deal and they walk right by this man amen my brother and sister are we need God to help us it's no time for the bride of Christ to decide we need to run and find some other place of refuse it's time for us to say Lord help me and we have the very word of God the very flaming sword of almighty God is in our hands to defend ourselves and so sometimes God's defense is just to wait and she'll love that the song this morning Hallelujah I just Rejoice my brother and sister sometime God's answer for us is just wait oh help me move on Lord Hallelujah not part of a Creed not part of a church not part of a denomination but part of him hewed out of any other kind of form won't work you've got to be heed from the word the world cut off of you and I'll just tell you right now just be open God's still cutting the world off of me amen there's little things you know that we just have little things that are just you might say well that's just being human well my brother and sister I'm not just a human I'm a Son of God your sons and daughters of God not just humans otherwise that's our excuse to do everything from robbing banks to doing drugs amen I'm just human the world world cut off of you just leave the word only live in you the great sculptor counting on you hope you don't mind me reading this again willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires and the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh now Hallelujah your sons and daughters shall prophesy Christ is the identified Masterpiece of the word made flesh you're asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be a masterpiece for the bride he knows the prophet of God says your ask you'll find nowhere in this equation God forced you to be right that you'll find that people that are struggling will say well I just feel when I go to church I'm forced come on let's stop what spirit is telling you that God's trying to force you to serve him I remember a brother preaching one time and I've thought about plagiarizing his sermon God has no hostages I thought it was such a phenomenal title God has no hostages um praise the Lord amen now as we look at this my brother and sister I want you to catch this for a moment please just really focus I'm trying to hurry along the Lamb's Book of Life it's not a book containing every name are you with me it's not a book that contains every name and as men fail their name is scratched out of the book that's not what the Lamb's Book of Life is you fail look it up pick on the young people made a mistake sorry made a mistake the Lamb's Book of Life my brother and sister it's not a book with names scratched out of it until there's only a few names left because the scripture says None is perfect no not one so what would that do it would leave a book with every name scratched out but I love the fact that the Lamb's Book of Life is a book not of the perfect in themselves but the perfect in Christ how do I get perfect in Christ by standing and letting him Hew the world off of us it's the standing my brother and sisters that actually is what is making now take this in an overall context please it's the standing is what makes us perfect because he's not going to stop until he has made you into the perfect image God's not like us you know you're working I just did this a couple days ago working on something and I'm like I've got to finish this I got to finish this today I can't quit this day until I have this finished my phone rings you want to go do this yeah bye it was so important that I dropped it like a hot potato and ran that's not God said I've started to mold you into my perfect image and I'm not going to stop until you were there but we haven't the idea that it would be like the OCD compulsive worker he got this human and he could not stop until he just carved him into what he's supposed to be kept looking at the blueprint God says no problem I know your days I know you're beginning and I know your end and I'm not going to inflict as it is a pain upon you in this sense but I'm just going to mold you mold you mold you mold you heard the word when I was a little boy I don't know nine years old or something he's still molding amen thank you Lord he never gave up he never quit he said I know who you are I know you're lineage I know who your father is I know where you come from and I know where you're going and I'm just going to keep molding you until I bring you and not only that I put a name on you not my daddy giving me a name my mama giving me a name my God my Creator My Savior my heavenly father Alba father said I put my name on you that's how you'll be identified amen now look what is the Lamb's Book of Life well we can give all kinds of explanations can I give mine well I guess so as one told me once well you're the only one Speaking okay thank you for permission the Lamb's Book of Life is the name of the renowned of the congregation the renowned what is the renowned the incompetent incomplete unusable rejected no sir those that have excelled those that have risen up now we might never be recognized as renowned on the face of this Earth but your life and the desire of your heart is putting you in a position God looks down and says this is the renowned this is those that are famous in my house now I'll tell you what I might not be famous in your house but I like to be famous in my house amen I like it when my grandkids come in the door my daughter son-in-law come in the door amen and they're like hi Grandpa hi Dad hey how are you oh love you oh or I'm feeling now I don't expect to go to your house and have your grandkids run and throw their arms around my neck and say grandpa hmm be renowned well we're renowned in God's house in God's congregation my brother and sister we are renowned we are known amen amen he's common he's numbered us as Warriors of his kingdom and he has aligned us in our genealogy I've shared with the church you know and I just share it very briefly hear hope but you know I always thought I was German I blamed all kinds of behaviors on them poor Germans man I can see the whole nation of Germany just smarting under that false accusation you acted like that because you were a German no you acted like that because you had a stubborn Spirit on you and all the years and generations of the Germans are like they just painted us with a black brush well Germans are stubborn but anyway so we we look in this genealogy come on I just feel led to hit this because I just hear people I hear people still falling back on these things they fall back on these things we're Irish really I'm Welsh I'm artistic because I'm this I'm smart because I'm that well I tell you what I don't know about your genealogy but mine goes back before there ever was a foundation mind goes back before anybody cared about the value of Rembrandt and Van Gogh and of this and of that long before they invented the Corvette and the Lamborghini amen my lineage goes back amen I don't need to come from a family that attained great wealth my brother and sister because my father owns it all I don't gotta go identify with this world I can identify in my world and my world is my heavenly father amen the family of God is who I am amen not attend here not there Hallelujah you know I always love that Reddit deal sometime back there was a family had several sons and daughters and as the little girls were growing up they were pretty little girls every little girl is pretty amen but that was there and they were encouraged to marry a handsome man with money should we preach that here no because it begins the word amen prophet of God said Mary a mount's got the Holy Ghost and got character that was the two priorities he placed on top of the list I imagine that the prophet of God if he was standing here would say you know if that man young man with character in the Holy Ghost has some money young lady you have hit the gold mine but if they have money no character have money and don't have the Holy Ghost I think what the prophet say about that one couple he would make her life hell on Earth who wants to sign up today for hell on Earth anyway so this this family quite wealthy generational wealth encouraging their children young men you don't go shopping for a wife over here you go amongst those of the wealth of the class of your level well one day one of the sons appears at the house in midterm of a College semester the dad's like what's wrong son said dad you're not going to be happy with me in fact I kind of think I'll just collect my stuff up because you're probably just going to kick me out and he says what are you talking about did you do something illegal he said no dad I just decided after this great struggle I'm going to be me I want to be an artist the dad looked at him and stunned silence but true right out of the Bible the dad had a moment and said wait I don't agree with you but you are my son nothing will change that and I forgotten the name it's one of the American painters that um you know when the sun sold his first painting this is way back like I think in the early 1900s sold his first painting for fifty thousand dollars dad said my confidence was not misplaced and he went on to be an accomplice painter and the family was proud of him and hung his paintings all through their family homes you see my brother and sister it doesn't matter how we see ourself we've got to be ourself and I don't know about you but the only thing I really cherish any longer is being a son of God because this world's not my home I don't fit in here I don't fit in here I don't belong here I've been an oddball my whole childhood my whole teenage years my whole early married life I'm glad that God sent a young lady into my life that could accept me for being the weird guy that I am people are like you're confident you're confident I'm telling you I'm more insecure than most of you put together but how do you hide insecurity with a bold front but I'm glad I'm insecure I got no security in land I got no security and money I got no security and business ability I got no security and none of this my security is in Jesus Christ and Christ Alone Hallelujah amen see look what it is my brother and sister are heritage we can be aligned in our genealogy we can be aligned in our heritage in the natural and be proud of what family we come from unless you're not and uh you know it is but the thing is is this is what Satan's trying to do in this hour is to confuse who our father is and the minute we walk away from God we're saying I don't know who my father is and the devil walks in and says you know what I know you have this insecurity I'll step in I'll be a surrogate father to you you want pleasure here's pleasure you want this here it is you want to be your own person here it is I'll tell you what I I thank God I had Parents that corrected me amen parents that come along and says oh son I'll help you get your first pickup you will pay me back and you will make all the payments and the day you can't pay for your insurance or your payments or your gas it'll just park right there I thank God for that amen and I thank God that every time I've got an idea in a spiritual realm that I just thought well you know praise God I hope this don't offend none of you I can just stay home and be just as spiritual as everyone else and God says oh we'll see about that we'll see about that how you doing Paul doing great everything's just so wonderful and grown men cry themselves to sleep at night why because without him we're just empty shells oh we don't feel like empty shelves you know brother Brown kind of talked about that the clothes some of you are wearing is worth more than your body is especially your sisters wearing them nice shoes I couldn't help but say that see now there's gifts placed in the body there's gifts placed in the body but brother Brown shows us very clearly the greatest gift ever placed in the body was Jesus Christ amen but looking in this natural amen look what God's equipped you to do amen We've Got Musicians and we've got people who sing beautifully and we have gifts to to be doctors and you know smart mathematics to decorate you know just all these gifts that God's placed in the body amen sister Alice I still it was there in the fridge I still look at it Marvel amen she got more education above and beyond High School than I got in all my life amen what God give her that gift to be able and discipline the gifts no good without discipline to go with it so we can sit back and say I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God now Lord just pour blessings out no God says what I want you to do is get down and dig for those I want you to commit yourself I want you to be sincere I want you to press to the mark of the high golly you notice that's what the scripture says press it doesn't say Coast or fall or anything else it says press and press requires efforts amen press to the mark of the High Calling amen but look at this God knows what he's equipped you to do now the devil's going to tell you it's much better to take the pleasures of this Earth it's easier is it really I ask you is it really easier to settle for the pleasures of this world I want to get into any morbid stuff so I'll just leave this alone but I can tell you right now them rich people or more miserable than you think they are oh they're rich life must be so good okay but I'm here to tell you it's not true the devil has projected an image and the world loves the glossy image now so God knows what he's equipped you to do he knows what he's called you to do he knows where he's called you to go that's now I want to take a little example my brother and sister you see the world can't take you or God has called you to go I hope you grasp that the world this world cannot take you where God who to go amen and God I can assure you never called you to try and fail now we turn to Hebrews 11 and 29. don't you just love Hebrews 11 I find myself just reading this all the time and God's speaking to me from Hebrews 11. amen but look at this I want you to understand my brother and sister that as they have moved out of Egypt and they had dealt with all that was Egypt and they've come to a place that they are there and many murmured many complain what was it it was the seed that Satan desired to plant in them that plagued Israel to this very day that seed that was there that God said it but he hasn't fulfilled it you go to Israel they are there many of them will say God promised this but he has not fulfilled it what if the prophet of God tell you and I if God said you're healed you walk out saying I am healed if God says I've delivered you from this in your life anxiety depressions this that and the other then you go forward saying I am delivered in the name of Jesus Christ but look at this Spirit on Israel they're still declaring God hasn't fulfilled it well I'll stand here right now and whatever afflictions are in my body my God has already delivered he's already come on the scene he's already gave it to me and I claim it amen I'm not going to sit back and say when I see God move I'll move amen I'm going to move whether I see the outward expression of God moving or not and that's the difference between the Gentile and the Jew as we were called to take the word stand up declare it and go forward amen they were given that in principle footsteps or possession yes but Israel 17 percent they occupy 17 of the land God gave them I brought this up in the service before I'm going to speak it with strength I don't want to make it personal or definitely an insult but I want to know what portion of the promise God has given you are you occupying and there'll be none amongst us that can stand and say I've done it all none of us can stand and be boastful about this but I'll tell you what it does it calls to my attention Lord there's much more for me to possess I don't need to just settle down and say well praise God God sent a prophet no sir I am the recipient of an investment that God made and he said the return on that investment is you praise the Lord that's a whole nother sermon I scratched a whole chunk of that out today because it looked like an encyclopedia amen now look at this Hebrews 11 29. by faith they pass through the Red Sea as by dry land which Egyptians are saying to do were drowned you see they can't go where you can go in the day and age we live in Satan cannot go where you're called to go the world cannot go where Sons and Daughters of God are called to go aren't you glad you're a son or daughter of God Hallelujah is not to be taken boastfully my brother and sister this is to be taken because it is God's word amen amen so in the light we'll look at this my brother and sister they say we're walking in the light what light is that amen now in the seventh Church ages here uh says no one could deny that Israel had light they were the only people who had light as a nation it was as when Egypt was so dark that one could feel it I think we're in Egypt I think we're in Egypt Saints because I don't know about you I don't even like to go to the grocery store anymore you know it's almost as though maybe my attitude isn't always right is that okay for me to admit that I might be in the store I'm pushing a car sister Joe will be like just look straight ahead are we past yeah it's okay Darkness around us you go oh go over here let's go over here this seems like this would be no bad idea I think we'll just go back where we feel comfortable home it's a prophet of God says in Israel they had light in the house it was gross Darkness outside but there was light in the house we don't want to become homebody so we might just drop in on you okay because there'll be light in your house amen when the death angel was moving through Egypt amen what did he do you know my brother and sister I say this is just a type bear with me he didn't have to go along and say let's get over here and see if there's blood on that there was light and the gospel is our light brother Brown says Jesus Christ is the light of the world as the scripture says he's our light Hallelujah aren't you glad makes my heart amen but in the homes of the Israelite there was light and so now True light has come the light of the world is Jesus Moses and the prophets brought the light by means of the scripture relative to the Messiah thus Israel had light now I want to just here again I find myself kind of speaking a little strongly this morning maybe don't want no one to be offended but my brother and sister some are receiving a light but it's not complete light amen now I'm just going to go ahead and say it I hope it's not offensive to anyone God sent a prophet that's light amen but what did the prophet bring more light so it was like to recognize that God sent a prophet but the prophet was a carrier to show us more light so we have light when we stop there that God sent a prophet but we are not wanting to settle for a partial light as the prophet of God see this is all right attached to Wednesday night a partial realization amen that we don't I'm not going to settle for partial realism relation I want light I didn't say give me this much light Lord give me this much light Lord give me this much light I want light amen amen so there it is my brother and sister but now the true light has come the light of the world is Jesus Moses and the prophets I already read this amen lie about means the scripture relative to the Messiah thus Israel had light but now the Fulfillment of the light has come and what was but glowing word has now broken forth in the brightness of God manifested among his people as the pillar of fire gave light at night and that was wonderful now light and life were manifest in the fullness of the godhead bodily isn't that beautiful amen it was manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily and then you really are gonna like this amen you've got to stay with that word to be the bride if you're in the bride you're in the word and the word is in you and the word that reflected God through Christ reflects the same God through you amen amen be so be it so be it I believe it to be the truth you have to be identified with him amen sister vika will you come Hallelujah isn't it wonderful be identified in this body of Christ Amen to be counted it is his bride to be identified in his name Mrs Jesus Christ amen yet I remember one time and I don't say this negative but to make a point I'm talking along a certain line like that as a bride and a bridegroom husband and a wife in a relationship and I remember this lady one time going ooh that's icky really you have children and you can't draw this into a spiritual relationship to have a relationship with Jesus Christ my brother and sister don't let it be intellectual let it be real Let It Be life amen Hallelujah Mrs Jesus Christ amen not the Bride of Satan's Eden Satan's got a brine she's actually quite beautiful naturally she's quite beautiful amen she's also naked spiritually physically [Music] I just read a little deal a while back man's wealthy worth a few hundred million dollars somebody asked him he says so how is it man in your position influence and everything that you have in a world that there's so much turmoil how is it that you've been married for 30 years to your wife and you seem so happy [Music] and he said the first mistake you made is you attach money and happiness in the same sentence the second mistake you made was who I am in relationship to that money has nothing to do with the relationship with my wife I thought wow that's actually profound that he says that doesn't matter and that doesn't matter what matters is this relationship [Music] praise God praise God thank you Lord because you see my thoughts go to I didn't have to be some great person for my Lord to love me I didn't have to have some special ability a special gift be handsome or strong or any of these things that would put some intrinsic value to me that he could say I could love him but I just come just as I am he said I love you I love you I pay a price for you I've redeemed you I've called you my wife and truly I claim you Hallelujah is it good to be Sons and Daughters of God today amen let's just stand sing a song or two before we've been dismissed today amen I just my old Hearts Just jittering Right Now Praise the Lord I thank you Lord for your grace 236 brother Isaac amen yes thank you well Alex I'll probably need help we place you in the highest [Music] are the great High priests oh we place you high above always [Music] and

before we go on songs just as it will place ourselves At His Feet just to worship him for a minute just lift your hands in your heart let the Lord know how thankful you are that he plays such a value and that value my brother and sister as he placed his name in you and I he counted Us in that number declared us to the heavens the Earth it's under another anointing it didn't hear that voice my brother and sister when the Lord God called out your name to the heavens but the heavens heard that voice the heavens heard your name and the angels rejoice oh they rejoice when they see this body this group of believers they see Sons and Daughters of God worshiping all Heaven rejoices oh we thank you Lord Jesus your grace and mercy your kindness to us oh mercy father brought us out of darkness and your Grace has taken us into your presence oh God I say thank you Lord thank you Lord because if left in my own father I would have lost my direction long ago I would have come to an intellectualism I would have come to emotionalism I would have come to an ism but by your grace Lord we've come to you and we're found father in your lineage found in your presence Lord found with your mind with your nature [Music] thank you Lord Jesus thank you thank you Lord Jesus [Music] Hallelujah [Music] 276 brother Isaac [Music] amen that's where we come to the house of God hear the word
