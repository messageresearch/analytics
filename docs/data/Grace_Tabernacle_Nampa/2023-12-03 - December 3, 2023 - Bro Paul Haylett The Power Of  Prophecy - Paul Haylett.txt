good to see you in the house of God today I trust that you're feeling better amen keep sister ogan her prayers I I don't say this lightly but sister Olga is one of the most strong and durable ladies I've met in my life and when you see her in such pain that she's in tears that's pain let's let's remember her amen amen I bring greetings to you from Brother Eugene Brawn today uh brother Eugene the Saints are doing well and also uh brother Chris meritz and the Saints of Living Word uh send their greetings today uh just uh the church doing well there in uh British Columbia and uh have some other things here you know brother Tim's like I told him I got a couple things I I just my brain is not grasping them and one of those being brother Alex will be will be traveling home he's been helping as parents with their house enjoying a Thanksgiving time and sure appreciate that you know the scripture speaks very much of respecting our parents and and to show them that we love and care and to you know those that maybe have families that your parents are not Believers one of the greatest testimonies that can ever be projected about what God has done in your life is your love and respect to your parents amen you don't need to defend what God's revealed to you we just live it and let that light shine you know and we don't want to be a 15 watt refrigerator bulb we want to be that thousand watt hogen amen that lights up everything around us amen remember our sister Sue today you know sister Sue just just so Faithful driving traveling those miles the weather is not always conducive and and uh sister Sue won't like me for saying this but she is getting older and we know as you get older um we just get smarter remember that sister Sue I said you're smarter uh and to be that we would drive through a a blizzard for a pizza and can't get out of the house when we get older for a skiff and uh so just remember sister Sue sister April she's been uh you know Saints and I hope sister April don't mind that I say this I just feel compelled to um sister April if God would just open the door as it were would be sitting in church this morning it's not for lack of Desire it's not for uh lack of sincerity um I haven't heard the full report I don't know some may have heard some of the report but um she just has incredible burden and uh her job is demanding and when she takes the time they demand it returned and so those schedules you know uh I have many a time in the past been irrigating on a Sunday morning and when I got the point of no return you might say I just walked away from it but I don't think somebody laying on the op printing table want sister April just to say church starts in 20 minutes I'll catch you when church is out so just remember our sister April you know if the devil would put any question in your heart just remember I stand as a witness of her sincerity of this message and of the gospel and the life that she lives my sister Susan please remember her back and brother Titus not here today uh not feeling well amen so we want to remember all those that wouldn't be here today and I I'm going to this is a very broad thing and and I I I just need to put this out in such a way that sometimes respecting the individual but wanting to acknowledge the need leaves us you know we kind of sometimes have this joke about uh what's so special spoken but sometimes Saints um for the respect of the individuals uh we need to especially in in you might say delicate situations we need to just lift it up we don't always have to know the issue we don't always have to know the name what we do know is that we serve a god that is a prayer answering God that is a god that is here and says I will shake heaven and Earth for you and if he'll do it for you he will do it for them amen and he knows the need and we have several very very uh unspoken but very special needs and it's not just uh it is in our young people my brother and sister uh we want to see our young people saved can we say amen and we want to see our families saved we want to see restoration come in our families we want to see rebellious Spirits broken amen and we want to see the spirit of Christ filled in amen and and we should be standing there and holding fervent to that that Lord I want to see you come on the scene and I'm willing to do my part and lift them to the throne and just remember there's young families that have very very dire needs and young people with many very dire needs amen and let's remember those in prayer amen that we not just become slack uh that we don't become just like well I I don't know what's going on but we need to just hold them up let's just take a moment and lift a hand and just ask the Lord to come down Heavenly Father Lord you know every unspoken need father you know the needs of my life my insecurities Lord you know the needs and insecurities of every individual and Lord we just want to send your Holy Spirit out today Father Lord for those you know the ones on our hearts Lord Jesus and we're asking you to go out to young men and young women father confirming yourself in their hearts Lord confirming father who they are and where they stand in your economy Lord just ask you to come and deal mightily father there's churches father that have been slipping in the rung and we ask you father to go out and give them Father a backbone to stand for the word Lord let them not find off fence but let them find you father Lord we just ask you for guidance today in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen Hallelujah we'll turn I want to talk to you once again amen kind of the contrast of two Natures if we would just turn in our Bibles today uh we want to talk on the power of Prophecy now my brother and sister we must realize that prophecy holds the key to every one of our lives every aspect of every one of our lives and you say brother Paul uh how do you mean that prophecy holds that well I want you to understand that every word that come from the mouth of God is prophecy he's actually declaring what is and what will to uh come amen what is to be and so as he speaks that my brother and sister we realize that this is God declaring this is not a hope God's not saying I hope this happens that would not be prophecy but when God declares right now what we have to do is understand and under never underestimate the context of the words that's being spoken amen we read it and we read right on to the next verse and we don't realize contained in that verse right there is such power to shake heaven and earth power to rest as in wrestle rest those Souls that the devil thought he had put his mark on and to pull them right back to the position I remember one time brother Tim puit sharing a testimony of they were having a service and there was a young young sister I think about 15 years old 16 years old and she comes in the prayer line and her prayer was I want to see my brother saved now my brother and sister this young young lady was sincere she she had come into a state of desperation for her brother she didn't sit back and say well if it be God's will she stepped forward and said I want to see my brother saved and her brother who had got caught up in alcohol and drugs was in living in the parents home I believe I could be mistaken on that but anyway wherever he called home he was in bed and he was stirred out of bed and he got up and he shows up at the altar at the church in his pajamas come on don't tell me God don't move God's got power to shake heaven and earth amen and that young man repented gave his heart to the Lord amen God healed him from his addictions and put it and as brother Tim shares that testimony he still serving God today not a temporary salvation amen I like how brother Danny steeman says we don't need to save them again just get them saved the first time we don't need to try and save them again and again hallelujah hallelujah excuse me if I get excited today Isaiah 55: 6 through1 13 is it good to be in the house of the Lord today you know you can't even go into a store already the Christmas music is playing and uh one of them I just heard yesterday when we were in Home Depot the weather outside is frightful well I don't care how frightful it is the Sun's shining on the inside hallelujah amen seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near here now if we believe the word of Isaiah is present T my brother and sister that means he's here this morning amen yes and he can be found this morning let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts because remember the thoughts become Deeds that's right amen and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon amen for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts now I want to just interject this right here your thoughts might be good thoughts your thoughts may be thoughts on the goodness of God of all the virtues that he's poured out and his thoughts still higher than your thought we are the limiting factor I lift a hand and say Lord don't let me be the limiting factor let my faith rise up not to be my faith see often times we talk about my faith oh I have faith I'm sorry you really don't have faith we don't want our faith we want God's faith so what we got to do is say Lord I do believe and in my heart I do but I'm going to let go of how I view this and I'm going to reach up Lord and by your grace take a hold of your thoughts am it'll change our world it will change our world Amen that's right for as the rain cometh down in the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and make it bring forth in Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word be now this is a very key scripture this morning so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth this is God speaking it shall not can we say that it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sented amen you see now my brother and sister Isaiah 55 And1 just took it out of your hands amen amen you don't need to say well if I and if I can and if it should be or if it be God's will God said it it can not return void amen hallelujah got a lot of things I want to say here but I got too much to say so amen for ye shall go out with joy yes sir not sadness not sorrow not your head hanging down your shoulders slumped and be led forth with peace and the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands hallu I just want to put it this way I know this applies to many more but I'll tell you what I just want to ask Sister Sarah just want to ask you a question Sister Sarah do the hills Break Forth in singing I know they do because she has shared the beauty there's something there oh Lord my God amen amen when I in awesome Wonder yes consider all yes The Works the worlds thy hands have made and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fur tree and instead of the Brier shall come up the Myrtle tree and as shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless the word today lead us guide us strengthen us father Lord for you are our substance and you are our very life and we thank you for that Lord guide us I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints somebody about now say a prayer Lord keep brother Paul focused amen the Lord speaking through Isaiah isn't Isaiah such a wonderful prophecy that has been given to us it's just so incredible everything that God dealt through Isaiah uh I believe is just applicable right to our day it is such a a a very deep uh uh word that that come forth amen and as he's speaking sharing these things that God's dealing with him he lays out all through the book of Isaiah uh he lays out very clear and understandable guidelines you might say guidance to us and amen I love this it's very clear that the word cannot return void that's right and if we had no other Revelation or something to take home today if we just took home the simple fact that the word cannot return void then as we are living life day by day we would realize that what God has spoken is applicable in this moment right here the word for this moment is not going to return void so whatever is happening in my life if I'm in the word and the word is in me I'm holding on for dear life it can't return void there's no scribbling across the fa face Return to Sender my brother and sister so it's there that we have to catch that revelation yes amen that what God said about us and and I'll get ahead of myself but let me just throw this little quip out here that it is my brother and sister that we are coming these certain signs that we see in the world we live in today uh these certain things that somebody the other day just voiced how is it that all of a sudden one day it's not there the next day we wake up and we have Identity or gender problems and we have all kinds of these problems and that problems and suddenly it's though as it rose out of nowhere well I'll tell you why it rose out of nowhere the devil looked down and saw a bride who identity is being revealed and he said wait I need to confuse identity and so it's here that if he can't confuse a bride in her identity then he's just going to confuse a world in their identity because after all he doesn't know out there who is seed and not and so he just wants to confuse identity we could go on down that channel naming many things that are relevant of the day that we live in and how these things coming up my brother and sister are not just random this is Satan I like this can someone say Amen before you even hear it hallelujah amen I like this the devil is responding to us we are not responding to the devil amen as it is said we have the answer to the Devil's question and the devil's out here saying I got to preempt this because these people are starting to recognize who they are and I need to confuse the water because if the world catches a revelation that Christ is back in human flesh again then I've lost and he's a sore loser he doesn't give up easy he keeps fighting but what he doesn't like oh is the fact he's responding brother Trevor to Christ in you amen not you responding to him in you but it's Christ in you and he feels like he's got to put up a defense and the prophet of God showed us clearly you don't let yourself try to defend you don't stand up and say well praise God I'm a Christian I'm going to defend myself we run under the blood he's our defense he's what we need and without him we're defenseless oh we can't live a day without him Saints and I'm just going to speak this a little bold maybe a little blunt you know the days you walked out the door without him that's right you can't forget them very quickly because the devil slaps you around throws things in your mind throws things in your way our patience just gets dropped on a sidewalk somewhere all kinds of little factors and we know I've got to stop I've got to get back in his presence I've got to get back under that blood because the devil's Relentless and he wouldn't be relentless and L he saw something in you amen that's it he's brutal though the man addicted alcoholic Satan doesn't just tear his life down he keeps him tore down come on Amen right Bankers in New York on Skid Row once had everything they desired to lay their hands on and in a short while find themselves sleeping over a radiator vent in an alley skidrow how can that happen because money and influence and power is not our answer the blood is hallelujah amen so this word spoken must come to pass now if we was to take the time I I I don't know if In Our Lifetime we could actually digest the whole Bible to digest every scripture of every word of God that's been spoken concerning the bride of Christ I've heard people say well I I you know I'm going to live every word in this Bible Well they ought to put some clarity because not every word in this Bible is for you amen some of that is giving what it is my brother and sister the Judgment or the warning to judgment for another people the contrast of the two Natures amen God is is here and we're not here going to spend our life in this church as long as I guess I'm Pastor uh uh talking about how ugly and mean and watch out for the devil no my brother and sister I'm not called to watch out for the devil I'm called to watch out for Christ amen it doesn't give us anywhere that you know at the at the coming behold the bridegroom cometh to look and Beware of the devil amen this is a people no let me change that you are a people that has already judged yourself and already filled amen by the grace of God Amen the lamp is full of oil and you're not sitting here saying now I'm going to run real quick I know where someone's a merchant over here you know I can call him in any hour of the day and night and he'll pray for me that I'll get the Holy Ghost no my brother and sister that's not how this bride Works she read the word and it said something to her heart amen not to her intellect but to her heart and she said okay if the Lord's telling me to get oil I'm going to go get oil amen don't you like that hallelujah amen uh there's a story just popped in my mind it's pretty funny but I'll just leave with that but I'll tell you just a little word of everyday advice if it's winter time you're better off to make sure thatth the car is full of gas yeah you don't need to be out there driving around in a blizzard with no gas makes perfect sense doesn't it yeah now we're going to have a little pole whose gas tank is below a quarter tank this morning natural types the spiritual I won't go there let me just I'm backing up I'll move over here get back into my thought heyen only let me say this if you ever run out of gas you've got no one to to blame but yourself yeah okay it just begs to be how many of you ever run out of gas wow okay we'll go on to a different subject here I I honestly was like no nobody's going to raise their hand amen so look at this my brother and sister every word that is spoken according to the word of God must come to pass now did he put a quantifier of big prophecy medium prophecy or little prophecy little issue in your life or big issue in your life no every word that is spoken must come to pass and so it doesn't matter what position you're in life is good life is hard you have health or you don't have health you have money or you don't have money the word is the word and it cannot return turn void amen people say if my circumstance it'd be easier to serve God if my circumstance was better let me tell you usually Prosperity is a hindrance to serving God that's right am amen yes it is that's right but the revealed and if you don't mind I want to use the word revelated I don't think it's even in the dictionary might be maybe I didn't spell it correctly young people they laugh at me when I write on the board because they just when they start snickering I know I've misspelled it but my brother and sister this revealed word that has come now a word that is revealed I could hold something behind a cloth or a veil and open that up and say this is now revealed but there is a slight difference between something revealed and something that has been revelated revelated is a revelation brought to life amen and what we need is not just a revelation of a seventh seal we hear it all the seventh seal the seventh seal seventh seal and I believe the seven seal but there's life behind the seven seal and what we need is the life behind it not just that the seven seal had some importance but we need the Revelation that comes out of that seal amen and when we have that Revelation been revelated to us that is the very life to a Believer can you say Amen to that amen if we just want religion my brother and sisters sorry to put it this way you want religion let's go be Mormons they have baseball teams and basketball teams and they have all kinds of help programs and they have this and they have that and and my brother and sister it's wonderful they have their own bank they'll loan you money want to buy a farm they'll finance a farm for youen they will sounds like a great religion doesn't it but where does it fit where does it fit and I'm not being CTIC but we have family amen lineage that goes back of men relatives now becoming more and more distant but relatives who hold High positions in the Mormon church amen I have no doubt I could have piggybacked right on that and be somewhat important wow but lost does that make us importantly lost my brother and sister I don't want to be important I don't want to be lost I want revelation of who Jesus Christ is I want the word to come alive amen so look if this word has been spoken can can you interact with me today preach with me Saints is this word been spoken amen if it's been spoken let's look for the result that's right not even to say is it Vindicated or not it's the spoken word let's look for the result there's going to be something tangible that comes from this spoken word and I'm looking out today on some people who are the tangible evidence of a spoken word not returning void oh does that mean you'll never make a mistake no we will make a mistake amen we get baptized we repent get baptized we still make mistakes but what it is is as you have now handed the title amen of who you are to Jesus Christ and said here hold the title of who I am you sinned or you had a bad thought or a bad reaction or a bad word here's a title back tore up don't want you no sir he took the title he says you are mine and furthermore I can't even see what are you talking about what sin are you talking talking about amen his thoughts much higher than our thoughts amen his vision much greater than our vision his life is our life in an elevated position being called to right amen I like I you know this is just a denominational preacher a little quip thing I saw he saidou notice there's a Stairway to Heaven instead of an elevator that's right it was an elevator just any old bu would push the button and get that free ride but God makes you climb step amen by amen step amen there's been times in years past sister Jerry and I may be in somewhat midlife it's fading now we'd be somewhere at a building and walk walk in and Jerry with a wild look in her eye would say let's take the stairs and you know it's a bad idea but you get this yes let's do it and there's people standing at the elevator and we beat them to the fifth floor only when they stepped out of the elevator they saw these two people all bedraggled and they thought no doubt these people are crazy but you see if all we had to do is push a button to get to heaven everyone would make it they would find enough energy but God's going to make you nobody start crying okay God's going to make you oh this goes so contrary to our thinking so you guys are going to be just like wait brother Paul but God's going to make you work for it yes sir and we don't have a wor gospel that's right but he's still going to make you work for it he's still going to make you face the devil every single day and make the decision and as you would say promote the action of stepping into the blood into the presence of God because there's two Natures there and Satan has the opportunity to woo you every single day and you have the opportunity to reject him every single day amen and look at this here's the devil offering Jesus from the Pinnacle of the temple oh just fall down and serve me and all of this will be yours and Jesus never voiced these thoughts he never said it out loud it's already mine amen amen so the devil was coming under a false pretense to offer something that he couldn't offer and what is Satan offering today I'll give you life I'll give you life he blows up pictures my brother and sister I read a very in-depth deal about advertising and the subtle demonic undercurrent of advertising because they understand in an advertisement about things that don't even have anything relevance they throw in some girl or some car or some kind of this or or you know images of money and all of these things and it's not some accident they know the subliminal message and Satan's here offering subliminal messages to a bride that's already received a message she don't need the devil's message she's got a message amen and so she is holding on to it and she knows by Revelation this message will not return void this message is going back where it came from that's right but the other one is too that's exactly right right yes sir I've never had an urge to visit hell I think about heaven all the time amen quite a difference amen quite a difference sir amen the word's been spoken so why don't we look for the prophesied result that's exactly why are we looking at the negative I'm preaching to myself this morning why are we looking at the negative when we've got prophecy that has promised us eternal life it's promised us Health it's promised us security it's promised us strength wisdom Revelation it's promised all of it and we get anointed by the old devil come on preach with me we get anointed by the devil and we first thing start speaking negative things last night now I'm telling you I felt the physical symptom of this and and but I think it'll make a good example last night I almost picked up the phone and called a brother to say I will not be preaching tomorrow my stomach all in a turmoil I just started a few days ago this turmoil just going and and I I just so tired of it I just I can't even eat but what I keep beling it back and H this just it's terrible I'm sorry to I'm trying to I'm trying to be kosher and I was sitting there in my office and I was looking at this thought by God's grace trying to put it together and I'm sitting there and next thing I know Jerry's like Paul it's bedtime it's time you see that thought if I can't do this almost brought me to the place just to push a key on a phone and say I'm done but something keeps holding me that's right Hallelujah and I thought this has been on my heart a little too long to leave it on the plate another day or week or month or whatever you see my brother and sister we have to react to the influence that's right and when we know by Revelation that this word that has come to us cannot fail us then we can step forward and say I'm just going to claim my healing tonight I'm just going to claim that God I will wake up in the morning and I will feel good right amen not I hope so amen that's not my faith that's it but God said I'm your healer Paul just accept your healing Paul and you got to say Lord I accept my healing amen cuz without that portion my brother and sister we can read that scripture and declare it day after day year after year decade after decade and nothing happens without us reaching out and saying that's the word that was prophesied over this flesh and I receive it and it cannot return void amen oh Hallelujah yes sir amen not a hoping that's it but Faith that's exactly right that declares it already done hallelujah already accomplished yeah there it is my brother now look at the definition of accomplish Amen to succeed in doing yeah let me tell you about how successful my God is every business venture I hope you don't mind me calling you a business venture every business venture is successful amen amen Every Soul that he spoke before the foundation of the world Amen every son every daughter every little boy every little girl every teenager my brother and sister he spoke it and we can sit here today and say I declare my God is going to be successful in the lives of our teenagers amen he spoke it he gave it we gave them back we made the commitment but our commitment is only a reflection of his commitment that's right amen if he had no commitment we would have no commitment but he has commitment Amen to bring about a result here we go again my goodness you'd think brother Paul turned into a worksman but bring about a result by effort amen that's right Amen to bring to completion Amen to S succeed in reaching a stage of progression that's right Amen to equip thoroughly that's right that's it I want to know is anybody equipped thoroughly today amen has God come and laid the word down in our lives so strong anchored it so deep and made a revelation revelated it to us that I can sit here today and say I believe with all of my heart I'm making the Rapture because I'm already equipped for the faith for everything I need to make that Rapture already within me that was what the prophet was saying amen everything you need is already in you equipped oh hallelujah amen that's right now that doesn't mean that God's not going to make you climb the stairs that's right amen hallelujah amen perfect that's it a cinnamon a cinnamon cinnamon sorry I said that somebody say it for me synony synonym amen you know sometimes my brain is well I bought a truck one time Saints and when I took it to the dealer to get some work done on it the mechanic said I am thoroughly confused and I said why are you thoroughly confused he says the VIN number and the model year and everything your pickup should have this parts and this Parts but it's got Parts on it from Pickups that Chevrolet did didn't produce they quit producing that particular thing two years ago was I blessed or what somebody at the chevret factory started sweeping off shelves and goes oh look at this this alternator will fit oh look at this water pump still the same bolt holes but an old style put it on there oh this will work and he says look I'm sorry to tell you but you've got a lemon that runs now my brother and sister that's not who we are amen God didn't just drag something here and drag something there he said that we were thoroughly equipped amen so everything we need to make the Rapture is already in USL amen it's not the law but neither is it entirely just a New Covenant that's why the prophet of God said see these guys went this way too far these guys went this way too far you got to come back to the center of the lord it's law and Grace is the whole balance of what it is God gave the Ten Commandments didn't put an expiration date on them amen but then he turned around and told me my told us that our Grace is his grace is sufficient so we can look at that and realize okay we still don't want to lost and covet and murder and do all of these things but when the flesh trips us up there's Grace to cover it can someone say thank you Lord today amen hallelujah but we I I say this just rhetorically but do you believe this is the age of the coming of the Lord amen we're coming to the Fulfillment my brother and sister of This Promise of Isaiah that God spoke through Isaiah we're coming to the Fulfillment of that and it's not going to be a partial fulfillment amen it's going to be a complete fulfillment amen amen so if the word's coming to a complete fulfillment it must be something similar in this way of a perfect God can we say amen amen a perfect God speaking amen a perfect word that's it I believe the message of the hour but amen no no no don't let the devil trick you on that one my brother and sister there's no butts in this if God's word it's either perfect or it's not and if it's not it's not God's word h wow well I believe everything the prophet said but Ser you know what it is the devil got into their message with another language amen another ideology that's another version another voice another writing amen cuz you see sorry to be redundant but if we believe this is God's anointed word it simply can't return void amen amen you know a recent situation of someone because of certain circumstances said we've missed the Rapture this is all this is all done this is all a lie we've been deceived and I'm going to to just speak really blunt might sound like a a little hostile to this individual all they this is how delusional Satan can be all they had to do is rewind their own life a little ways and they'll see the supernatural hand of God come into their life but the devil well they've got Superior look back abilities the prophet said says this this and this and it never come to pass of course this is after they have researched every newspaper every database went to every village and went to every spot on earth and interviewed every single person that's doable isn't it if we Rec recruited 100,000 people we could not go touch every testimony of God on this Earth but let's face it you and I have had our disappointments I think I'll leave that one alone let me just put it this way the devil will anoint you to only look as far back as your last disappointment Hallelujah imagine sister Carrie coming out of Egypt and you've got all the way down close to the Red Sea and realize you left your favorite stew pot in the house in Goa if I was really supposed to have left the house I would not have forgot that I what am I doing here I'm out here in the dirt I'm out here in all of this and Pharaoh's up there wants to kill me what am I doing here totally forgetting 400 years in their family history totally forgetting every prayer that they cried Lord Deliver Us totally forgetting that God came with a powerful hand and touch their lives to take them from the oppressor and totally forgetting Devil's Sly old Fox but let me remind you the bride of Christ he's responding to you not you to him amen amen so that's right a perfect God speaking a perfect word bringing a perfect accomplishment to the spoken word amen so what's God's prophecy of you feel free if you want to speak out what's God's prophecy of you amen what's he got to say about you amen what did he testify of you amen come on all we got to do is just go a rudimentary Bible study and if you don't have a good grasp of the Bible use Google because Google will even show you the scripture yeah you know I've done that before literally have a scripture on my mind and I'm like man where is that okay yep there it is Philippians okay thank you devil well I don't know that Google is the devil it was just created probably by the devil so you look at this my brother and sister see he's bringing this but what is God's prophecy Brother David spoke out there said you're perfect he said you're righteous he said You Are Holy said you have his nature you are not a people but now you are a people amen he says all of these things that once you were lost but now you are redeemed amen and it said that our hearts would be turned back anybody's heart turned back today amen he said that we would eat the book anybody eating the book today oh praise God amen he said that this bride would be righteous and she would be holy and that's where the devil slips in and says I don't think that applies to you but devil I'm not asking your definition I ask God's definition he said I can't even see your sin I can't see your unbelief your unbelief at this moment will not stop the word from coming to pass hallu and then God will bring a revelation and the veil opens and we look back and say oh Lord how could I ever have thought that I could never be saved how could I ever have thought this and thought that and God says it's all right cuz I knew who you was you've got identity that's amen hallelujah now look at this first Peter I got to hurry along here amen first Peter 1:15 but as he which hath called you that's it is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy amen now I can't be holy that's it but God in Me that's it God in you the word amen that's coming to an accomplishment Hallelujah that's it that's right you know my son was getting his contractor's license in Arizona and it's actually quite an extensive thing and it's open book so when he called me and told me dad I failed it at first I was like what you took an open book test and failed it and I think there must have been something in my voice and says Dad I wonder how you would answering 400 questions they gave you two hours to answer 400 questions I hope you see where I'm going I've been given you've been given an open book test amen that's right can we be honest amen we failed yes sir but what you learned in this part of the book by real experience next time the devil's got a question you don't have to go look it up and when my son took the test the next time he's going through he got about 90% through the test and was well on his way would have passed the test but they hold you to the time literally when the timer goes D they come take your stuff the screen that you were typing it all in shuts down are you with me this is why this battle that we're in as I learn here that just shall live by faith am I going to have have to go back and find that again no I'm going to stand before God and be able to say I am just I will live by faith amen and then we move into another aspect of our life and something happens there and the Devil comes and throws it in your face and you say Lord forgive me and by faith in the word of God God's faith in God's word amen you come and pretty soon come on Saints preach with me today when we get far enough through the book we've got the answer to the devil's question without to go find something we're there every day learning learning learning what are we doing fulfilling the accomplishment of the word amen otherwise God would just go and I don't know maybe the port would be behind your ear and he'd just slip a little whatever you call them what do you call those dve thumb drive wake up one morning drunk yesterday wake up this morning a saint no sir you got to get on the first rung first step and then the next step then the next step then the next step Page by Page line upon line God changing us and the whole time the devil wants to say you're failure you're failure and you can look at that and say yeah but Satan time's not finished yet Hallelujah amen hallelujah let me get on let me get on somebody keep praying about Paul being focused amen what are we doing we're fulfilling these words that's right amen they were spoken of us can you say Amen to that this morning these words were spoken of us amen now there's a whole another category of language and words and whatever that applies to the devil right those that would fall under that year of your father the devil my brother and sister but we're not of the devil never was of the devil never will be of the devil we are Sons and Daughters of God from the foundation before the foundation of the world where names were written in that book and God verified that and said that's my handwriting amen you know you get a real good forger he can do such a good job but you get a real good investigative uh handwriting individual and he can take those signatures have the original and he can come and say now you'll see how this loop on the H or the I or the G or the J is this way and they don't match you wouldn't know it I wouldn't know it most people wouldn't know it God knows it am amen God knows who you are sir hallelujah amen now look at this in Mary's belief I just like this so we find out today that the message is a true Bible message I find I find this a little bit sorry my warped humor I find this a little bit humorous that the prophet who's speaking these words is turning around speaking to you saying so we find out that this message he's referring to the message he's bringing well the message he carried the message um he delivered amen yeah it's not claiming ownership it's not claiming originality so we find out today that the message is a true bible message can we say amen amen back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost back to the power of God back to Pentecost again now let's remember my brother and sister Pentecost was not necessarily what we reflected to be right they they were as under the influence of new wine they were under this they spoke in tongues they praise God but we'll look at this and realize this was not my brother and sister let me just give you an idea of modern Pentecost how the devil gets into it I I do my homework I please don't go there but I'm telling you my brother and sister that a bunch of women in pencil skirts with heels that are so tall up there singing is that Pentecost sir Pentecost was a cleansing fire it was not just an anointing on flesh Pentecost was a cleansing fire that come down and went right to the depths of hearts and souls and right to the depth of the Flesh and cleansed it and once it's been cleansed it can't look like anything but God it is God am amen so we're not talking about Pentecost of today not even Pentecost of the 50s or 60s we're talking about Pentecost of a cleansing fire that fell on that day and souls were burnt purified restoring the hearts of the fathers back to the children or the children back to the fathers rather in this last days we're looking for a Heavenly messenger and I believe he's here tonight that's it I don't want to change the prophet's words if you don't mind but I believe he's here today yes sir Hallelujah I believe he's here today my brother and sister we're not having to look back way way back oh you know people think that don't know the message they think it's a little weird we're quoting something from the 60s my brother and sister but let's go back here okay I I don't want to have to explain this but um it's the true Bible I don't really want to have to quote something that uh um 2500 years old really it's God's word and it's not 2500 years old it's before the foundation old that's it amen because God's worda has never changed that's right it is the original amen that's right amen so there is a restoring back to the fathers amen and he's here tonight that's exactly amen amen amen I believe he's here that's right amen what does he do that's it he Bears record amen so what does he do God offers up his own evidence amen right he doesn't go over here and ask this man now you'll hear men offer up evidence right but God himself says to get this started off right I'm going to offer up my evidence first now you'll notice in a court of law that the prosecutor offers his evidence and then he moves on to the witness over here's evidence and this policeman over here's evidence and that is but the prosecutor has to declare the foundation of the evidence first so everybody knows where they're going so what does he do he Bears record now some of you aren't praying hard enough amen amen now look at this what do he bear a record of his own word the only thing he could bear record of was his own word speaking of the future amen so he's bearing record of the word are you with me when Jesus was on the earth he says I can do nothing except the father shows me what was he doing he was bearing record of the word if we can use modern terms that was already archived that's it not make it up on the Fly already archived and what was this record he was sparing you that's it that's what it was all about that's exactly amen it wasn't about fire consuming uh sacrifices it wasn't about these things and about those things it wasn't about ishmail it wasn't about none of this it was about you Hallelujah Christ in you the hope of glory that's it am now now prophecy very simple for us to understand that it's a a statement that something will happen in the future a power ability to know what will happen in the future inspired utterance that's it the function of a prophet that's it prediction of something to come that's right you realize that you are a supernatural prediction that's exactly now have Grace on what we view the word prediction right because predictions can have error but you you understand Supernatural you huh brother Trevor you're close my Victim of the day you growing up where you grew up we won't go into the details you grew where you were at and you were here and there was a time let's see wait there's things we don't even want to discuss in public right and you were there yeah what did the prediction say Amen the pred addiction said Son God you are a son of God all of this the devil said you're a drummer you're a rock band person you're an alcoholic you're going to do some drugs you're going to be angry you're going to be that's the devil's language my brother and sister but before the foundation of the world God said he's my son and he is going to be my son and there's nothing can change the fact I said he will be my son come on apply that that to your lives today Saints don't be looking at your circumstance don't be looking at your failure don't be looking at anything around you look to the word and the word said by prophecy that we would be Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah boy I tell you what my brother and sister let's look for a moment at the contrast and I'll tell you the contrast every day is getting broader it's spreading out broader and broader amen amen in home Depot I see a man I'm sorry I'm just I'm a kind of observant that way I see a man and a woman walking down the aisle towards me in Home Depot he looked like just a normal everyday guy and and I looked and they both had a ring on and I'm assuming the Rings belong to each other amen but it's there and she's got spiky purple hair with hot pink laced in it and H well anyway I don't want to be too judgmental and I'm like man that just don't seem to make sense but was she always like that I'll put it this way I anchor this back just I know it's probably been said by a lot of people but many many many years ago brother Donnie rean and it got anchored in my brain and I Associated it back to brother Donnie Reagan you are either going forward that's it or you are going back backwards amen now we know the society we live in maybe in 6 weeks her hair will be brown again but see how tricky the devil is you get a little taste and sin will take you further than you want to go that's right yeah the Holy Ghost will take you further than this old flesh thinks it wants to go let go and let God let go and let God Amen let him take us into Heavenly places let him take us into the supernatural let him take us into the liberty of the word amen hallelujah let's not just get so hunkered down amen it's like a little cartoon I seen once you know Bob was an unwilling Christian it was almost like a far side car cartoon I hope you guys don't mind me being demonstrative and uh and it said says you know Bob was kind of an unwilling Christian and the Rapture is taking place and it shows Bob holding on to his chair going to heaven no no no no unwilling Christians but you see that's pervaded mentality enough that somebody even saw fit to mock it yeah that's it I'm going to take my boat my car my train my plane my house in heaven is going to be just like my 7,000 square foot house here on Earth no no no no no no no no you know I'm got a revelation amen your Mansion over there is not going to be some well anyway amen now okay can I at least get through this 42 Page quote here we are seven Church age book now I want you I want to skewer your thinking on this okay is it okay for me just to put a little twist on your thinking there to just cause you to make sure you look at this in a certain fashion usually we don't like that but I want you to understand this quote is dealing with contrast this is where it's at it's not who's right and who's wrong it's what contrast we are you're blind or naked is is that you no now this is really desperate how can anyone be blind and naked not know it yet it says that they were are blind and naked and can't perceive it the answer is they are spiritually blind and spiritually naked do you remember when Elisha and Gesa were surrounded by the army of the syrians and you recall that Elisha smoked them Blind by the power of God yet their eyes were wide open they could see where they were going the blindness was peculiar in that they could see certain things but other certain things such as Elisha and the servant and the camp of Israel they could not see you catch the full depth of that yes sir they can see certain things they see Jesus on a cross at Calvary but they don't see him living entirely in them amen they don't see them as actually the sacrifice that was on the cross are you with me they don't see themselves there but the word says he became sin so that we could become righteousness and so that was my sin hanging on that cross amen that's right and they talk about that but they don't see the real depth of it right they don't see that a holy God expects them to be holy now I'm going to just say this as a reference point not judgmentally but you know people have lost their respect for the word of God when you see them in the summertime parked in their church parking lot flip-flops shorts now this is going to be a little direct forgive me but Tops on that are so limited that you they might as well just be wearing their bikini Tong baggy arms cut out all this walking with their Bible into the house of God yeah I don't say that is a criticism those people I'm saying my brother and sister the word of God is coming to pass in our day it's happening that people being spiritually blind and spiritually naked amen they don't see a holy God they believe they're acceptable in the presence of a holy God that when the priests used to walk into the holiest of holies and everything wasn't perfect they pulled him out with a rope that's right my brother and sister I don't mean to be crashed today but I tell you what they'd be the mortuaries would be clear full of preachers yeah and there'd be some scared people of why are our preachers all dying that's right because they've lost their respect for the word of God and they don't see that it's important anymore so they just do what feels right you know I tell this as a joke I'm getting sidetracked forgive me but back in the days when we didn't have a pastor here and sister Jerry and I used to receive the VHS tapes of brother Donnie rean they they mail them to us real regular and and this is back a few years so I I put the VHS tapes in there so you'll recognize this back a few years and I'm telling you Saints hope you have a sense of humor this morning push play recliner feed up bowl of popcorn amen I believe that brother Donnie and some of you people won't even be in the house of God you sit there in your home with your bunny slippers on watching the preaching aren't even in the house of God sitting there in your jamas that's right but I believed what he said enough I've never watched preaching in my jamas again come on the word ought to change us that strong yes amen so he sploded him blind forgive me for that digression there it was particular they see certain things right they see certain things they see God sent a prophet yeah they can't see the part where he said you ought to be in a church with a pastor with the Holy Ghost I'm not promoting preachers I'm promoting what God told the prophet to speak that's exactly right amen cuz I'll tell you what there's a lot of rotten preachers out here amen amen and let's just face it there's a lot of rotten preachers out here but the word says amen the word says a prophet said see certain things anyway his army could not see was did not Avail for them what they did not see brought on their captivity now does uh what does this mean to us H it means exactly what it meant back there in the Earthly Ministry of Jesus he tried to to teach them truth but they would not listen John 9:40 and 41 and some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also Jesus said to them if ye were blind you should have no sin come on I want you to see where this is going he's not talking about flesh he's talking about spiritual eyes to see a spiritual word and my brother and sister I can say hallelujah this morning that God has not allowed you and I to be blind he has taken the scales from our eyes he's taken this away from us that we can see the word amen and Jesus speaking to them says no if you were blind you wouldn't have no accountability that's right you should have no sin but now you say we see Therefore your sin remaineth the attitude of this age is exactly what it was then people have it all they know it all they cannot be taught and if a point of truth from the word word comes up and a man tries to explain his view to one with an opposing view The Listener is not at all listening then he might learn but is listening only to refute what is being said I couldn't tell you how many times I've encountered that amen you can quote it from the Bible and they'll argue that that's not what it means come on my brother and sister that's not a Believer that's right I know I'm preaching a little straight but that's not a believer that's right h no the Bible they must have wrote that wrong when the prophet said it 101 times and they say that's not what it means he must have wrote it wrong no I'm telling you something's wrong your hard drives what's writing it wrong is it okay amen oh it cannot be taught point of Truth the word comes up man tries to explain his view one to another listeners and a at all listening might learn but listening only to refute now I want to ask a fair question can scripture fight scripture does the bible contradict the Bible can there be two doctrines of Truth in the word that say the opposite or opposed to the other no no no I don't want to I don't want to go too far into these things I have literally set in the presence of men that would tell you this brother was with the prophet and brother Brenham told him this directly opposed that's right to the word of God that's exactly right and expect you to believe it but they have churches full of hundreds of people amen who are able to accept something directly opposed to scripture you say why are you bringing that up brother Paul no I'm not bringing it up to criticize them if you think that you've missed the point I'm here to tell you the veil's been lifted for you I'm here to tell you that God and His Sovereign Grace has come and has revealed himself to you that the word is alive and the word is all important to you and it doesn't matter if brother Paul starts a venture to the right or to the left you guys here listen to me saying you guys are going to be courageous enough to say brother Paul you're off repent come back to the word that's the kind of men I want to serve god with that's the kind of sisters I want to serve god with that's going to stand and say look we're going to have to vote you out if you can't change the way you're going if you're going to keep going that way we maybe won't have to vote you out maybe God will bring judgment or bring you to correction or bring something but you see my brother and sister the immature tree is the one that can be blown flat to the ground amen you know the rule of Rome in the Dark Ages was bend them till they break then you know why they chose that because very few in that under that anointing would bend imagine some big tattooed mean looking guy with a mask with spikes on it big Rippling muscles a wicked look in his eye and there you are tied to the rack with a chain [Music] click reant I can't can't click reant no click until it took every drop of life out of them that's it my brother and sister I'm I'm going to get off this subject but in this day age we're like I know it doesn't line up the message but they're good people and out of respect we're going to let them preach here in the church because we don't want to offend anyone you realize it's not just individuals that God's putting or allowing ing the rack to be applied to it's whole churches whole mindsets we will not recant this message amen we will not step away we will not water it down we will not let it be abused we will not be my brother and sister and this has nothing people say well you're against these people no there is people in these conditions I love very much my brother and sister I love them enough I want to see them come to the full truth but I can't make them and you can't make them only God can make them and if there's no light shining in their life then where are they going to go that's it that's why you're there that's right it might be a son it might be a daughter it might be a parent it might be whatever it is you've got to shine the light no matter what is happening Hallelujah I'm getting sidetracked forgive me amen where was I amen amen they couldn't see certain things but was certain things such as Elisha the servant Camp of Israel they could not see what this Army could see did not Avail for them I was already here wasn't I well let me get down here um man where was I scripture fighting scripture Bible contradicting Bible it cannot be so oh thank you brother I was looking at that screen and I come back to this one and I realize I'm lost yeah how many of God's people have their eyes open to that truth not even 1% you thought I was hard brother brandham preached to tens of thousands and he says not even 1% I come across like a PTY cat right soft here have a sugar cube be happy lollipop amen come on Prophet wasn't no wimp he didn't water it down I in fact I'll tell you what my brother and sister if prophet of God come and preach to us today many people many many people would say man he's too harsh yeah yeah not even 1% as far as I know have learned that all scripture is given by God and all is profitable for Doctrine Repro correction Etc amen if all scripture is thus a given then every verse will dub tail if given a chance now yes sir but how many believe in predestination unto election and reprobation unto destruction those who don't will they listen no they will not ye are both uh you both yet both are in the word and nothing will change it that's it but to learn about it reconcile the truth of those doctrines with other truths that seem to oppose they will not take the time but they stop their ears Nash with their teeth and they lose out at the end of this age a prophet will come and they will be blind to all that he is doing and saying they are so sure they are right and in their blindness they will lose it all amen I tell you we should be coming Lord open my eyes open my heart open my ears Lord I if I'm wrong if I am wrong Lord move me over here to what is right I don't care if I'm even just a one footstep out of line amen The Prophet's vision of that bride going forward is telling her to get back in line get back in step now imagine in the modern version of the church they'd stop and pull out all kinds of references well brother brandham you even said over here in this sermon no sir what is the the bride do gets in Step amen she doesn't argue she doesn't argue that that I I I I think brother Brown must have must have plagiarized this from Arthur pink well so Arthur pink had a revelation of the word what's wrong with that what's wrong with Arthur pink or Martin Luther or or uh any of these others my brain just went dead on me any of these others that are quoted today so much John Wesley um Char Spurgeon oh brother Brown plagiarize no I'm sorry that was a word before Charles Spurgeon ever spoke it right it was a word before Arthur Pink ever spoke it or John Wesley over spoke it or Martin Luther ever spoke it's God's word there's no plagiarizing it shows you the carnal mind that they are approaching this from that those words belong to that man and that man alone no it's God's word amen hallelujah yes sir kind of like copyrighting the message that's right amen I'm
